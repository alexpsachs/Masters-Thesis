allText.py: Creates allText.json which is an aggregation {person:text} of all the conversations that Alex and Andrew BOTH marked (i.e. excluding those that were annotated by just
	one or the other but not both) for the oni project
personalities.py: The purpose of this module is to take the text from allText.json and turn it into personalities (Big 5 AND SYMLOG)
	and then throw that information into /home/a2sachs/Documents/Experiment1/Data/IBMWatson/personalities.ods
