SYMLOG_metrics.py: Calculates all of the symlog metrics from ../Data/ProcessedText_Sym 
    and puts it into SYMLOG_metrics
experiment_data.py: Aggregates all of the data for analysis

experiments:
    old: this is the original data without reorientation (the issue is this isn't really the best fit as most of the groups
        end up with everyone in the Opposite circle
    reorient: this is done with the inversion of the compass if the proportions are such that this makes sense
        (more greatest number of people in the ref circle instead of the opp circle)

ESEM - Final.ods	Is the aggregation of all the ESEM data into one spreadsheet

NOTE: altered /home/alex/Thesis/Experiment/Analysis/ESEM - Dataset.ods
	> changed the value for nicklockwood/iRate to TP (as per the email thread with Jailton)
