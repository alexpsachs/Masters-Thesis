    "KrauseFx": "Hi, thanks for reporting it. \nI added MLColorAdditions as a submodule with the last commit: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/ba1b4c206a83032fdaa694be7e4e61a37f647dfb\nWithin the next few days I'll upload the pod to cocoapods (right now it's only a local pod you can use in your project).\nFelix\n. Thanks for the pull request! It was a general problem with landscape mode, not only iPad. I haven't used TSMessages in an iPad app yet.\n. Thanks for this pull request. I didn't know that.\n. Hi Tobias,\nI haven't watched many users using the app. There are two ways to reveal the menu above the navigation bar: Dragging it down and just tapping on it. If dragging doesn't work, the user can just tap it as well.\nFelix\n. Which view controller do you pass to the message class? It works fine in my projects.\nThere was already a pull request that should add a workaround: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/pull/3\n. It's related to this pull request commit: https://github.com/iSkythe/TSMessages/commit/2c05670ae0272bde5c73b87605465560713a8e2f\nI'll look into it, in the meantime you can also just subclass TSMessage and implement + (CGFloat)navigationbarBottomOfViewController:(UIViewController *)viewController to correct the value. Sorry about the troubles.\nIs the status bar hidden in your app? Maybe that's the reason for the 20px\n. I just tried the following\n- Added it to a UITableViewController: It does not scroll with the tableView, it stays on the top as expected\n- Added it to the navigation controller with a regular navigation bar and the status bar shown: Position as expected. \n- Added it to the navigation controller with the In-Call Status bar: Position as expected\n\nI tested it with the latest code from develop, I'm going to merge that back to master now.\n. Make sure you have the latest version, this has already been fixed: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/bbe67cb023e77a6159531374ac13b8230bb49cec\nStill, when rotating the device the notification does not automatically resize the message, which should be fixed within the next days.\n. @brooly: That's strange. Could you checkout the example project of this repo. It works fine on the iPad in portrait and landscape mode. \nCurrently the width is set using `self.viewController.view.frame.size.width`. Do you pass the proper view controller?\n. That makes sense, I'll include that fix in the commit.\n. Okay, the fix is included here: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/1ac157c17eed2d2ce8e6fea12084e45988326325\nI have not yet released an update of the cocoapod podspec file.\n. Hi,\nThanks for your contribution. \nShouldn't it be possible to integrate this feature by using autoresizingMasks? (UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth)\nUpdating the width after the rotation works fine, only the labels and the height of the view have to be changed after/during the rotation. \nIf we moved the code that sets all label related properties into an own method, that is called after/before the rotation we would only update the height of the view and the width of the label.\nMaybe that would an easier approach.\n. Hi,\nYou're right, the view is created before it is added as a subview. Anyway, we could easily just init the width and the labels of the notification as soon as it is shown.\n. I have re-written the code that managed the auto resizing and the duration of each view. It should be much cleaner now: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/25b81953bea85e8f7e9bc1397c03a3d8a081d506\nI'm still struggling why the tap and swipe gestures don't work any more.\nAlso the first time the device is rotated from landscape to portrait (if the view was set up in landscape mode), layoutSubviews is not called for some reason.\n. Everything works perfectly now: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/4017d4b02be2d212aaf2fd320484f622aa290d81\nI'll just have to do some more testing before merging with master and updating the cocoapods version.\nCould you also try if it works for you?\nThanks\nFelix\n. That is a nice idea. Should the block be an optional parameter when creating a notification?\n. Check out my last commit in Develop: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/4ffeb451336871e1c46c18abe4b2145bce2b22b9\nIt's not entirely finished, but it should work. The block is only called, when the user manually dismisses the message by tapping on it or swiping it up.\nRight now, I still have problems with the gesture recognizer in the Develop branch. That's why you can't really test it right now.\n. Check out the latest version on the Develop branch, everything should work already: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commits/develop\nI'll merge it into master today.\n. Thanks for your contribution, I merged it to the current develop branch: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/c9140781144f2c4d8d8d30b4d097510d42639a7a\nI worked on the automatic adapting of the width when the device orientation changes in develop and merge it to master as soon as that is completely finished.\n. Thanks. It really wouldn't be complicated to implement. I'm not aware of any use case yet, maybe you can explain it? If there are more users, requesting this feature, I could easily implement it.\n. Looks good, yes. We could also add another initializer that takes a view as parameter, so you could easily add an \"Add\" button on the right side\n. Here we go: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/4e05fc8d499aa6af34d41dd16569633d1377589c\nJust use the new initializer to setup your notification and it will automatically be shown at the bottom of the view controller.\nThe gesture recognizer for dismissing the callout was also updated to use the other swiping direction.\n. This change is not yet available via cocoapods, so please clone or download the project and include it manually.\n. Does it affect only the notifications on the bottom?\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\nOn 26.04.2013, at 22:12, forward6 notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n@KrauseFx https://github.com/KrauseFx First, thanks for this enhancement!\nBut I think this might have introduced a new bug with device orientation.\nDo you need more details?\n\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on\nGitHubhttps://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/issues/12#issuecomment-17097506\n.\n. This problem is fixed now: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/620dcc585654da440ec84f4a8e3d1c8a0d0fa76c (Thanks Yann)\n. Thanks for reporting. Looks like I have to change it to readwrite: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4837565/objective-c-private-public-properties-making-a-property-readonly-for-outsi\nI'll update and test it with the next commit.\n. I don't get a warning  when analyzing the project. Where did you see the warning? Do you use the latest version of the code?\n. Hi, \nIf I understand you correctly, you just have to pass your UINavigationController instead of the view controller to get it to work.\nLet me know if that fixes your problem.\nFelix\n. Should be fixed now: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/3153a5fd43ad5d7c400d46dfa80fa01f83627a66\nThanks for the report\n. Thanks for reporting this crash. I've never experienced that nor got a crash report. I added the additional checks into the code in the last commit: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/c98c6cf6821830aae1fe1da4a3e2c6d504da91da \nCould you check if that solves the problem?\n. Okay, good to know, the issue was fixed. Thanks\n. Thanks Jercik, for this pull requests.\nI fixed the rotation issues with the new functionality.\nAlso I added automatic sizing of the button instead of using a fixed value.\nYou can take a look at the commit here: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/3e97969ed2ef81fb03daa9053cbc2e6402596e92\nFelix\n. Looks great, thank you. Have you tested it with two nil values?\n. Shouldn't we just add an initializer that takes an UIView instead of extending the button functionality. I'm with you, there should be an easy and fast way to add a button to the notification. Still, when we offer a way to pass an UIView object every developer can decide how much he wants to customize.\n. @Jercik Thanks for your contribution, it's merged now: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/7d6feabaa1c307cf4aad917f6bc12c2fcdfd135b\n. I guess that's a really good idea in the case of the missing network connection. In my apps I'm showing the internet error message whenever the user does anything that requires the internet connection.\n. How about passing -1 as duration to show a message with no limited duration which you can manually dismiss in your code? Adding another parameter just for that might be a bit too much. It would be a constant that contains the -1 value.\n. Oh yes, there is a way. It's not yet on Cocoapods but on the master branch: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/e5ab6fc48a779545b38ed917ccf56be936f94e8c\n. Here we go: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/967694472f2aa1b0564368c86cc4d73f9a3c01f2\nTake a look at the new example code that shows you how to add this kind of message. Let me know if it works as expected, I'll update the Podspec then.\n. Awesome. I'll create and release the Cocoapods update tomorrow.\n. Okay, I released the Cocoapods update. We have to wait until it gets approved by the Cocoapods Team\n. Dismissing the currently displayed message is easily possible\n\n``` objective-c\n[[[TSMessage sharedMessage].messages lastObject] fadeMeOut];\n```\n\nBut yes, I could provide a convenience method for that.\n\nWhy would you want to know when the message is hidden automatically?\n. Providing a - (BOOL)hideActiveMessage is a good idea, I'll implement this little feature now.\n. Dismissing the currently active notification by code is now possible: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/e5ab6fc48a779545b38ed917ccf56be936f94e8c\n. Dismissing the currently shown notification is now possible. \nCalling a block after the message is gone, no matter if triggered by user or the timeout is not yet implemented.\n. Thank you @interstateone ;)\n. So the dismissedBlock is triggered as well when tapping the UIButton? Does the current implementation without this fix cause any problems?\n. The behavior of the message when tapping on the button of the notification view is correct. The notification disappears and both the dismiss callback and the button callback are triggered.\n. This should be fixed now: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/81ead4c5d9311cd578af71376f5496be7b48ba4e (Thanks @fawkeswei)\n. Hi, thanks for contacting me. When I was looking for a light weight library that only parses Hex colors I found yours was the smallest and best version.\nAt first it was a submodule/pod dependency, but I removed it in this commit: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/3153a5fd43ad5d7c400d46dfa80fa01f83627a66\nSomehow it was duplicated for some users which then caused warnings in Xcode. \n\nWhat has changed in your 2.0 version?\n. Yes, if you want you can switch TSMessages to have a Cocoapods dependency instead. I wanted to avoid having to run 'pod update' before the example project would work. When cloning/downloading the repo, the example project should be instantly compilable.\n. I don't get any warnings when compiling or analyzing the project. \nYes, it should be a 'private' method.\n\nIf you want it would be great if you could provide a pull request for this issue.\n. Thanks for the contribution\n. Thanks for the contribution. Were you experiencing issues when using TSMessages in landscape/portrait mode?\n. Hi @TheCocoaNaut,\nAs mentioned in the AppleDocs comment:\n`@param callback The block that should be executed, when the user tapped on the message`\nis this callback only executed, when the user manually dismisses the messages, like tapping or swiping it.\n\nCalling a block after the message is gone, no matter if triggered by user or the timeout is not yet implemented, as mentioned in this issue: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/issues/21\n\nSince a few developers already requested this feature, I'll probably add this feature to the next Cocoapods release.\n. I'll close the issue. If you have any other questions feel free to post them here.\n. Hello,\nYou are right. My first thought were to just customize and change the values of design.json. This isn't possible when using Cocoapods.\nAssigning a custom file name before using this class like [TSMessage setDesignConfigurationFileName:@\"otherFile.json\"] would be a nice option I guess.\nWould that be a good solution?\n. Thanks for your great contribution. I merged it just now. I haven't yet tried loading a custom design file, the default one works fine.\n\nI used these files in my apps for a year already and it wasn't planned to release it in the beginning. That's why it may not be perfect to customize right now. One temporary solution would be to just copy the files into your project and change what you need.\n\nI have to come up with a more general solution for adding more designs in the future.\n. Hi,\nThis works pretty well for me. Have you tried passing the ViewController instead of the UINavigationController?\nHave you tried the example project? It should work fine there.\nFelix\n. I'll close the issue for now. Let me know if you have any further questions.\n. Thank you! That looks great. I'll take a look into it the next few days and test it. \nJust out of curiosity: could you show us a screenshot of your customized notification view?\n. Thanks for the contribution! \n. As you can see, it does work in the demo project which has a tab bar. I used the default Storyboard TabBarController template from Apple to setup the demo project. \n\nWhat's the problem when you use it in your application? 20px for the status bar?\n. Why did you close the pull request?\n. There should be no problem with the refresh control itself. I'm currently working on this issue and will update it in the next few hours.\n. A new way to set a custom vertical offset was added: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/e30c1fc46ab85e104b428283185faac464e8af8a\nYou can set a delegate which returns the top position you actually want to use. It's not a perfect solution yet, but it should work for now. \nLet me know if that fixes your problem.\n. Hello,\nYou only have to import TSMessages.h. I guess it has something to do with the passed ViewController. Have you tried passing the active navigation controller instead?\nYou could NSLog the exact location of the TSMessageView, by adding the breakpoint/NSLog statement in 'TSMessage.m' to - (void)fadeInCurrentNotification to the [UIView animateWithDuration....\nAlso you could try using recursive descriptions there to determine if the view was properly added as a subview.\n. I'll close the issue for, feel free to reopen it when you need help.\n. Oh yes, it works for me in my project.\nI use both the default view controller and the navigatoinBottomOfViewController. Have you tried setting a break point? If that won't help maybe you could provide a little example project that demonstrates this issue.\nThanks\n. You are right, I just tried it and it seems to not work. I have to fix it. Thanks a lot for reporting\n. Well yes, it's getting pretty large, but as long as it should be a \"one liner\" it has to be like that. \nThe other way would be:\n\n``` objectivec\nTSMessage *warningMessage = [TSMessage initWithType:... title:...];\nwarningMessage.duration = 3;\nwarningMessage.callback = ...\netc....\n[warningMessage show];\n```\n\nwhich is kind of annoying.\n. A new way to set a custom vertical offset was added: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/e30c1fc46ab85e104b428283185faac464e8af8a (I think that is your second account, right?)\n. Thanks for the contribution. I'll update the comments and work on some other issues before I'm going to release the next cocoapods update.\n. Is this still an issue? I think the behaviour has already changed\n. Thanks for the contribution. My apps don't support iOS 5, that's why I didn't notice the wrong behavior. \n. Thanks for the pull requests. Seems to be working fine now.\n. These delegate methods were added in this commit: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/81ead4c5d9311cd578af71376f5496be7b48ba4e\ndue to an issue with iOS 5: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/issues/40\n. Oh, that's right. Currently only - (BOOL)gestureRecognizer:(UIGestureRecognizer *)gestureRecognizer shouldReceiveTouch:(UITouch *)touch is implemented. My apps don't support iOS 5, which is why the fix is from someone else.\n\nWhen I merge your pull request, it will break iOS 5 again, right?\n. Thanks for your contribution :+1: \n. Could you set a break point for all exceptions to see which line is causing the problem?\n. I guess it's the NSJSON line, right?\nPlease check if the JSON file was properly included. Do you use the Cocoapods version of TSMessages?\nAs you can see, the library tries to load a file name after the constant 'TSDesignFileName', that was not properly included in the project.\nI hope that helps.\n. Glad it works now\n. Thanks for your contribution, but iOS 5 and iOS 6 are no longer supported by TSMessages.\n. Thanks for your contribution, your commit is merged: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/ae51dd39ef18a5c651d792e8e78e89cea934e7ae\n. Thanks for your contribution\n. That's right, currently the keyboard is not being taken into account to calculate the Y-position when the notification is displayed on the bottom.\n. I'm pretty sure it is still an issue. When shown from the bottom, we do not take the keyboard into account.\n. Thanks Matthias for your Pull Request. Merged (https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/acb1d9c7233f3faf3b03e76450f26bedc38665dd) and a little bug fix (https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/599ccb78cab9e5c35f37db5f1ababdd715561709)\n. Okay, I updated the way of setting up a notification view: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/3389c829bff8834f7765ffcaead6007b9b8e324f\n\nExample: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/#to-show-notifications-use-the-following-code\nWhat do you think?\n. Yes, that would be awesome. Right now, we haven't started redesigning all our apps for iOS 7. \n\n![687474703a2f2f7777772e746f7572737072756e672e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323031332f30342f694e6f74696669636174696f6e4572726f722e706e67](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/869950/916003/49fef672-fe7f-11e2-81c8-5bbe83f6af32.png)\n\nThat's the current style. What should be changed besides removing the gradient and adding the blur effect? Adding the blur effect should be done by using a UIToolbar, right?\n\nThe font shadow has to be removed as well?\n. I'm working on it right now\n. For some reason, the UINavigationBar subviews decide to be hidden. My current state: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/60be36140ef8d4a25dd00bbd6e70777c8509f3d4\nI'll try to fix it in the next view days. In the mean time, I just use a transparent layer for iOS 7 instead.\nUp until now I had no problems using the blur effect in my apps.\n@myell0w Maybe you could take a look at the toolbar?\n. Wow, thanks @myell0w! :+1: \nI added support for iOS 6 and iOS 7 in parallel based on the currently used Base SDK and the OS on the device: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/861e2ed540ac50939f4a298692aa2885a39ab0e7\n. Makes sense, thanks! :+1: \n. Sorry guys for the troubles. Yes, that's because of iOS 7\n. Hi Guys,\nSorry again for breaking the project. I fixed the iOS 7 related build error when using an old Base SDK: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/861e2ed540ac50939f4a298692aa2885a39ab0e7\nI'll take a look at the missing file.\n. When downloading this repository as zip, the project compiles perfectly.\nHexColor should be included automatically when you 'pod update'. Are you using Cocoapods?\n. Okay, when you use submodules, you also have to include a submodule for HexColor. \nCocoapods takes care of that dependency automatically.\n. Okay, I'll close the issue for now, since I think most people will use Cocoapods to include this library and it's easy to just drag in the required folder.\n. Thanks for your Pull Request, but I think there should be a more general solution. Like passing any UIView object and choosing the position (left or right side) and TSMessages will take care of positioning it properly.\nI'll implement this functionality in the future.\n. Great and easy fix, thanks for your contribution!\n. Looks great, thanks for your contribution :+1: \n. Thank you! :+1: \n. Thanks for your pull request. So your solution dismisses and removes the message view from the queue as soon as another view controller was pushed or the current one was popped from the navigation stack?\n. Looks great, thanks.\n. Yes, that's because you don't use Cocoapods. Is there a reason you don't use it?\nI haven't integrated TSMessages 'manually' yet. \n. I'll take a look into it when I have more time. Thanks for reporting this issue.\n. Looks good, thanks. @dennisreimann can you confirm it works for your project as well?\n. @mRs- Might that be related to this pull request or is it another issue?\n. Hi Marius,\nWith the latest 0.9.4 update I removed those initializers to clean up the available methods. I'm not entirely sure it's a good idea to offer any available combination of parameters, that's why I reduced them to the most important ones and a designated one.\n\nI wanted to work on something different: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/issues/54 but that was too much work with the current way notification views are created.\n. I'm really not sure. As mentioned at https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/issues/54 I think the best solution would be to create a simple messages view object and then customize the properties you want to change.\n. That's possible in the latest develop branch by setting the duration directly to the TSMessageView\n. I think this pull request probably broke notifications that are displayed on the bottom\n. Thanks for reporting.\nIt's really strange your notifications don't have a background in iOS 7. What base SDK did you use? It looks like it's an empty app/project, could you attach an example project?\nI can image what causes the wrong location on the bottom. It's related to this Pull Request: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/pull/66 commit: https://github.com/mRs-/TSMessages/commit/d00a3579df66aa857c6fbfb265f648d1f7d7b040\nI could image we have to check if the notification is displayed on the top.\n. Are you using the latest master or the latest Cococapods release? Maybe the wrong position has been around for a while.\n. Yes, you can customize the background. In iOS 7 it's a static color defined in the TSMessagesDefaultDesign.json file, on iOS 6 and below a gradient image file is used. \n. Yes, thanks. I'll look into it when I have more time.\n\nHave you tried using the latest release instead of the latest master?\n. Does this problem still exist? I'll close this issue for now, since we're dropping iOS 6 support.\n. @dimohamdy Sorry, if something doesn't work in iOS 6 can still use an older version (https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/releases)\n\nBut: TSMessages should work fine with iOS 5 and up: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/blob/master/TSMessages.podspec#L26\n\nIf not, the podspec file is wrong and needs to be updated. \n. Thanks for the pull request\n. Nice catch, thanks!\n. iOS 6 support will be dropped with the 1.0 release. Does this bug still exist with the today's release?\n. Thanks for the pull request\n. @getaaron Yes, that would make sense. TSMessages needs more updates for better iOS 7 support/design, like new icons and no font shadow.\n@jkrzemie The code does not work when I set a font family and no font size. Also the default values of the configuration file should match the default design.\n. When we change something in the font system, we should use the proper iOS 7 API as @getaaron mentioned. I have not yet tested how TSMessageView behaves when the text height changes. \n. Sorry about that, this is related to the last commit of my colleague: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/9587e8432e84f77094c3f90e4dba5c86468e8715 \nWe'll provide a fix in a minute.\n. Awesome, thanks @onato! :+1: \n@shams-ahmed Let us know if everything works fine now.\n. It seems like the becomeFirstResponder is executed before the textfield looses its focus. Have you tried using a dispatch_after?\n. That means it's not a problem of TSMessages itself ;)\n. How about not dismissing the keyboard when the user taps the 'Continue' button and first check if everything is valid? \n. Sorry, I'm not working on this issue.\n. Looks great. Have you tested the changes on iOS 6 and the old Xcode as well?\n\nThanks for your contribution\n. No, firstObject is available since a few major versions of iOS, it just wasn't public. \nYes, I guess we can drop Xcode 4 support of the example project now.\n. It was mentioned on Objc.io: http://www.objc.io/issue-5/iOS7-hidden-gems-and-workarounds.html in the first paragraph.\n. Makes sense.\nThanks for your contribution :+1: \n. Hi,\nThat's because the custom design file was not yet updated for iOS 7 with the new background color property, instead of the background image.\nThanks for reporting\n. As you mentioned, when you tap on the 'custom' button, it will load the AlternativeDesign.json file, which was not yet updated to support iOS 7. \nTSMessagesDefaultDesign.json is working fine.\n. This is fixed now on the develop branch: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/8d446be0a1bbdb584c78eb11997e71f4f2bbcef0\nWill be released with version 1.0\n. Hello, sure, just set the navigation controller as the default view controller.\n. Does it work as expected?\n. Have you tried running the Example project? Does the iOS 7 style work for you? \nI guess it's because of a wrong Base SDK\n. I haven't had time to update the code to using iOS_UIImageEffects. Pull Requests welcome.\n. Yes, I guess it's not clear when not reading the whole documentation of the project. I still want to possibility to pass a viewController instead. \nGlad it works now.\n. @PathonHauser sorry, closed it by mistake.\n. I'll close this issue and keep talking about this problem on this one: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/issues/109\nWith the 1.0 release, there will be a blur effect\n. Hi,\nThanks for the report. That's right, the iOS 7 style is currently broken (related: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/issues/82)\nHave you tried passing the navigationController as viewController when showing the message?\n. There is already a Cocoapod: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/blob/master/TSMessages.podspec.\nJust add pod 'TSMessages' to your Podfile.\n. Awesome, have fun :+1: \n. It sounds like most of your wished functionality is not possible with the current TSMessages \"API\".\nI guess the best solution for you would be a fork where you add the feature you need and hand in a pull request for each individual feature.\n. Sorry, there are a few things that need to be improved:\n- There is no animation when dismissing the message manually by tapping\n- It takes too long to display the message - it should be displayed very fast\n\nI couldn't test TSMessages in iOS 6. Have you tried it? Is it the exact same behaviour as before?\n. This seems to be an issue of your configuration file. It works fine in my project and in the examples: https://www.dropbox.com/s/bpfvhbexmr9i1m6/Screenshot%202013-12-03%2009.38.41.png\n. I'll close this issue for now.\n. Hello, I guess the calculations are wrong for your use case: it looks like TSMessages assume you have a statusbar. \nSince iOS 7, the message is also displayed behind the navigation bar, which looks great with a regular navigation bar.\nI guess it's currently not possible to have a navigation bar without an image or color. You can fork TSMessages to modify this behaviour for your use case.\n. That looks odd, seems to be related to this issue: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/issues/88\nDoes this work for the default TSMessage style as well? It just seems like there is no padding calculated for the icon.\n. Does this problem still exist?\n. Closed because of no activity. Let me know if you have this problem again.\n. You could always use [UIApplication sharedApplication].keyWindow.rootViewController\nThis is already used as default VC if you don't pass one on the latest version of master. Let me know if that works for you.\n. Hi Steven,\nThanks for your really great Pull Request. It's clear what you did and well documented, thank you for that!\nIt makes sense separating those two functionalities.\nGreetings\nFelix\n. This would definitely be a nice new feature.\n. Thanks for reporting. This is fixed already: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/blob/master/TSMessages/Views/TSBlurView.m#L46\nThere is no Cocoapods release yet, so you could just use the latest master or a specific commit which fixes this warning.\n. Hi,\nSorry, custom views are not yet supported, but I think this would be a very nice and flexible addition. Currently it's only possible to add a button to the message, which was not yet updated for iOS 7...\nCheers\n. That's right. A TSMessage can also be dismissed by tapping it, triggering the given block.\n. I agree with @getaaron here. It makes no sense to drag down a TSMessageView\n. Thanks for reporting the issue, a new Cocoapods release is really overdue.\nI don't understand: how did that take you a couple of hours? Don't you use the autocompletion of Xcode/AppCode?\n. The documentation will be updated with the 1.0 release\n. It was updated :) Thanks for reporting.\n. Sorry, I can't tell you what's causing this problem. Does it work when you display it on the top? Is the keyboard still shown when you call the TSMessage method?\n. Any updates on this?\n. Perfect, that's good to hear :) \n. Sorry, right now that's not planned.\n. Text Alignment will be possible very soon.\n. Custom subviews should allow you do implement all this: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/issues/97\nThis feature is not yet finished.\n. In the meantime you can use this fork: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/pull/108\n. Thanks @dennisreimann for answering.\n. This looks amazing! I'll take a look and test it! :+1: \n. I can't tell you. Have you tried setting up a clean project and including TSMessages in the Podfile? Also have you tried 'pod update' and 'pod install'?\n. I don't think that's a good and clean solution. Have you tried using the latest version from the master branch? The Cocoapods Release is pretty also and I didn't have the guts to release a new version yet. The 'head' has already a fix for the warning.\n. Currently that's not possible. \nYou can take a look at TSMessageView.m:340\nCurrently I'm using sizeToFit for the titleLabel. You'd have to change that to use the full width and set the textAlignment to center.\n. We'll merge this pull request with the 1.0 release. \n. When it crashes there, the color value seems to be empty. Check if the json file for the design was properly delivered with the app.\n. It's working fine over here... As @mafellows mentioned, it seems to have a naming conflict with other classes. \n. Yes, that's exactly what I'm concerned about. The designated initialiser grows and grows.\n\nThere is already an issue with some thoughts about that: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/issues/54\n\nI guess a major redesign of the TSMessages library would be necessary for this change.\n. Well, it's not something that's your fault or your job. It's something I've been unhappy with TSMessages for a long time now. @dennisreimann and me are working on a better solution, where we can add your great new option for text alignment as well.\nI'll keep this issue open, since it might be interesting for other users as well. \n\nThanks for your contribution :+1: \n. Yes, the blur implementation is still old and needs to be replaced.\n. @dennisreimann Another dependency is fine I guess. It's better than copying the files or implementing our own blur. Is there any big disadvantage of a new dependency?\n. Nice catches there, thanks :+1: \n. @dennisreimann Thanks for migrating the changes to the current develop branch. \n\nWe could merge this PR and release one last version before 1.0 that features this PR and also the default behaviour of tap to dismiss\n. You Sir, are amazing! Thanks for the great contribution. I'm taking a look at those changes right now :+1: \n. Points I noticed:\n- [x] Messages are not dismissible by tapping the message (by default). I think that's very important, since users tend to just ignore alerts/messages and try to get them out of their way\n- [x] Shouldn't userDimissEnabled be default? It was until now and would require a lot of work to change that.\n- [x] The Pull Request for Permanent messages is already in this one as well, right? (#112)\n- The button needs to be re-styled for iOS 7.\n\nI guess it would also be fine to merge the following pull requests into the develop branch here:\n- [x] #111 from you\n- [ ] #87 from @toco\n- [ ] #103 from @srekke \n- [ ] #108 (we might have to update it to not use a new initialiser) from @ricardopereira. In this case it would easily be possible to have a setTextAlignment before presenting the message.\n\nI guess that would be [a really nice 1.0 release](https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/issues?milestone=1&state=open):\n- [ ] iOS 7 only with improved iOS 7 style and UIKit Dynamics\n- [ ] Priorities for TSMessages\n- [ ] Text Alignment support\n- [ ] Easier setting up of TSMessages\n. Mh, it works fine for me. Which base SDK are you using? Which code base? (master? develop? Cocoapods Release?)\n. @mRs- Yes, that's task I opened. We should be using resource bundles for the assets: http://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podspec.html#resource_bundles\nWe'd have to replace the called [UIImage imageNamed:\"imageName\"] to [UIImage imageNamed:\"[BundleName]/imageName\"] and define that in the podspec.\n. This was implemented with this commit: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/5908e4ca00d5f0397549a18f9ff4d6502294c66d\n. When you want to overwrite the style/design, just use your JSON file with the updated colours.\n. Yes, Tweetbot implemented it so the user can't see how bad the reception after tweeting something :P \n\nI think that's not in the scope of TSMessages. There are some other projects that do that pretty well.\n. Awesome, thanks! I updated the README (https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/b9d9ee3dae97059733e87b5aa3d05594b294300d)\n. First of all: Think about if you really want to show a notification every time the connection is lost. Why not just display it, when the user executes an action that requires a working internet connection?\n\nTo your problem: What does the alpha of your labels have to do with TSMessages? What's exactly not working? \n. Probably TSMessages is not the right project then, sorry. \n. Maybe @NicHuang means: I want to show the **same** notification on all view controllers. \nI think what you want is a sticky notification, that can be created by setting a custom duration. \n\n```\n/** This enum can be passed to the duration parameter */\ntypedef NS_ENUM(NSInteger,TSMessageNotificationDuration) {\n    TSMessageNotificationDurationAutomatic = 0,\n    TSMessageNotificationDurationEndless = -1 // The notification is displayed until the user dismissed it or it is dismissed by calling dismissActiveNotification\n};\n```\n. That's easy: just pass your navigation controller. \n\nSent from my iPhone\n\n> On 13.03.2014, at 03:31, NicHuang notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> I'm sorry that I didn't make it clear and there was some typo in my post. \n> I use AFNetReachabilityManager to monitor the internet.

Thanks for letting us know to remove the image property, since it's not used any more.\nIt was used before for iOS 6 to create a gradient effect.\n. I'll leave the issue open, since we still have to remove the property from the JSON file.\n. @mRs- Nope, it's more of a clean up for 1.0\n. Makes no sense cleaning this up as long as we're supporting iOS 6 and below.\n. So the old version didn't have this problem?\nThat looks really odd. This is caused by TSMessages? \n\nAll TSMessages does is create a new view, add it as a subview of your given view(controller) and display it there.\n\n[currentView removeFromSuperView]; is a valid command: It is used to clean itself up and remove itself from the super view.\n\nAre you sure this problem is not caused by some of your code (e.g. hacky way to receive or modify an other view?)\n\nMaybe you could provide an example, it's difficult to guess.\n. Sorry, I had no time to look into it yet.\n. @cytryn Sorry, I don't completely understand the problem. \nWhen you pass TSMessageNotificationDurationEndless, the message will stay as long you don't call `[TSMessage dismissActiveNotification]`\nYou can easily call dismiss on viewWillDisappear\n. Could you please provide a little more details?\nCentering of the title is currently not possible AFAIK.\nWhen you want to change the background color I'd recommend duplicating the design file, rename it to your own and use this design file: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/blob/master/TSMessages/Classes/TSMessage.h#L154\n\n[TSMessage addCustomDesignFromFileWithName:@\"file_name\"]\n. Tap to dismiss is really important and should be back to TSMessages as soon as possible. @dennisreimann @mRs- What's the current status about that? Should we release an update just for tap to dismiss?\n. This fix does work for me and looks great. @cytryn What's the problem with this PR? I tried the updated example project and it works fine.\n\n@schystz Thanks for your contribution :+1: \n. I just submitted the new version https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs/pull/10572\n. @cytryn Sorry, mentioned you by mistake. \n@harshitgupta What's not working for you with this pull request?\n. Have you tried the example project? It works fine there. Which SDK are you using? Maybe it's some of your code in your project causing this issue? Are you using a fixed notification?  \n. @cytryn yes, that makes sense!\n. Thanks Marius :+1: \n. I just added a new version, where you have full control of the vertical position of your message view. \nAll you have to do is implement the delegate method and return the correct y position of your view.\n\nCheck out the commit here: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/36522b1bd5619e7331a6ca9c141562b7997df8db\nYou have to update to the latest version on master. When you're using Cocoapods, just add \n`pod \"TSMessages\", :head`\n\nI'll release a new update on cocoapods later today.\nPlease let me know if this fixes the problem.\n. I haven't had time to answer that yet. They is some method to get the current status bar height. \nLet me know if you can't find it. \n. This totally makes sense. I'd prefer to just offer an UIView as parameter instead to be fully flexible. What do you think?\n. Wow, this Pull Request is **huge**! Thanks a lot for your contribution. \nI hope I'll get to take a look at it in the next days.\n. @mRs- I think this should be in the 1.0 release. On the first glance, this PR looks really great and offers a nice way for developers to extend the functionality of TSMessages without touching the core.\nI still want to take a look at all changes in detail.\n\nHow about merging this PR into the develop branch and experiment with it a little?\n. That's difficult to reproduce. Could you provide an example project?\n. Check out the answer to this issue: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/issues/81\nYou can just pass the navigation controller to fix this issue.\n. Currently the TSMessages requires a view controller, which AFAIK does not make a lot of sense - it should be an UIView.\nAnyway, if you pass the UIWindow object as parameter, the message should be added as subview of the window and therefore covering the navigation bar. To make that work, you have to 'hack' a little bit by temporary adding the window as view of a view controller so TSMessage can access navController.view. I have no idea if this actually works, just some thoughts.\n\nAs you see in the screenshots in the README (https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages) there was never an implementation which covers the navigation bar.\n\nIs there any specific reason you want to do it? Don't you block the user from going back from the currently viewed view controller?\n. I just added a new version, where you have full control of the vertical position of your message view. \nAll you have to do is implement the delegate method and return the correct y position of your view.\n\nCheck out the commit here: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/36522b1bd5619e7331a6ca9c141562b7997df8db\nYou have to update to the latest version on master. When you're using Cocoapods, just add \n`pod \"TSMessages\", :head`\n\nI'll release a new update on cocoapods later today.\nPlease let me know if this fixes the problem.\n. Oh, I know what's causing that. I'll push an update in a minute. Sorry about that\n. Yep, it's working again: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/f3ae3ed40042bf21f5c3d3eb373a76721e5dda28\n. Yes, that's easily possible, just copy the content of the design JSON file, store it in another JSON file and call \n\n`[TSMessage addCustomDesignFromFileWithName:@\"AlternativeDesign.json\"];`\n\nTake a look at the example project to see a working implementation.\n. Ups, sounds like there is a major bug in the latest version which causes crashes. @mRs- can you release a hotfix for that?\n. Sorry, TSMessages was built to only show one message at a time. Checkout our \"competitor\", ALAlertBanner, who can do that: https://github.com/alobi/ALAlertBanner\n. Mh, I'm not sure about this. I thought we had no shadow on iOS 7... I guess someone must have put that in again.\nAnyway, could you fix the whitespace / tab of the pull request? https://github.com/Hotel-Reservation-Service/TSMessages/blob/b02c913da7381937da89be2de734667f1a4bdb7e/TSMessages/Views/TSMessageView.m\n. Thanks for the pull request. It makes no sense to name it the same. \nJust removing '2 *' is no great solution.\nAs you see on the screenshots: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages the icon should be a little bit on the right. There should be an own value for the left side padding\n. So, when you don't want a border on iOS 6 as well and set a custom height, a border will still be created, but shouldn't be visible, right?\nI guess your PR makes sense, but it should also check if it's iOS 7. I think we should display no border on iOS 7.\n. Easy solution: On viewWillDisappear you call `[TSMessage dismissActiveNotification]`\n. I just added a new version, where you have full control of the vertical position of your message view. \nAll you have to do is implement the delegate method and return the correct y position of your view.\n\nCheck out the commit here: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/36522b1bd5619e7331a6ca9c141562b7997df8db\nYou have to update to the latest version on master. When you're using Cocoapods, just add \n`pod \"TSMessages\", :head`\n\nI'll release a new update on cocoapods later today.\n. This is fixed already, thanks for reporting.\n. Yep, sorry for the late response! It's merged. You have to use the :head option in Cocoapods until the next release.\n\nThanks for the pull request :+1: \n. Thanks for this pull request.\n@mRs- @forgot I don't think the TSMessages library should required AVFoundation. Instead how about putting the sound support in a sub spec? What do you think?\n. @forgot Thanks, yep, the pod spec looks fine. But I guess the code also has to be adapted: you can not include or call AVFoundation related code.\n. Yes, I guess it's not that easy. Maybe it would be interesting to add a delegate protocol for the messages, which can also be used by developers to do something when the message was dismissed?\n. Wow, that looks amazing. Thanks for your great contribution. I wonder why there was never a request for sound for messages - it's kind of obvious.\n. Yes, there is a milestone for that, containing a few issues: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/issues/milestones/1/edit\n. Hi, \nAFAIK the background alpha is only used on iOS 6 and below and was replaced by a blur effect in iOS 7\n. @JanC Update, sorry, it's not used any more.\nBut there is a new method now to easily change the alpha value: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/d6c9fffda0d5b7287c6561b32cf4fbe8623b4ecc\nJust implement the delegate method.\nYou have to use the latest version on master. I'll probably release a new version later today.\n. I guess that would be something for @mRs-, who is the developer of HexColors\n. I agree with @mRs- here. It's an advantage to have a dependency to not pull the same code multiple times if it's already in the project\n. What alternative to Hex codes would you use in our JSON configuration?\n. I just added a new version, where you have full control of the vertical position of your message view. \nAll you have to do is implement the delegate method and return the correct y position of your view.\n\nCheck out the commit here: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/36522b1bd5619e7331a6ca9c141562b7997df8db\nYou have to update to the latest version on master.

Perfect, thanks for letting me know.\n. Thanks for your pull request. I'm pretty sure, having just one line of title and the default icon should work just fine.\nIt probably broke with a recent change. Are you using the latest version from master branch or the latest release?\n. Sorry for not replying to your submitted issue. We currently have no active maintainer of TSMessages who checks all the pull requests, reviews it and tests them. We had a few problems in the past, breaking TSMessages for many users. \nI'll take a look at this pull request, thanks for submitting! :+1: \n. Thanks for your contribution :+1: \nYou still have to use the :head option in Cocoapods to apply this change.\n. Can you check if all the required images + icons are in your .app folder? \n. Thanks, this is resolved now :+1: \n. Already merged with https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/pull/157\nThanks\n. Sorry, you're the first who asked. Personally I'd like to provide a way to provide a custom view to solve all those kinds of requests - unfortunately haven't got the time to implement it yet\n. Temporary solution for now: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/d6c9fffda0d5b7287c6561b32cf4fbe8623b4ecc\nYou can now provide a custom subview to a message.\n. Related (your own issue :)) https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/issues/97\nI'll close this one for now. \n. I just commited a new version, where you have full control of the vertical position of your message view. \nAll you have to do is implement the delegate method and return the correct y position of your view.\n\nCheck out the commit here: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/36522b1bd5619e7331a6ca9c141562b7997df8db\nYou have to update to the latest version on master. When you're using Cocoapods, just add \n`pod \"TSMessages\", :head`\n\nI'll release a new update on cocoapods later today.\n. Oh, that makes sense. I'll publish a fix for that.\n. Okay, fixed with https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/92fd1a9c3db64615c11aa8d04cab955624457845\n\nIt was only related to the example project. The method itself works in your project, right?\n. That usually means, the file cannot be found. Can you check your [appname].app bundle if your JSON file exists? Set an exception breakpoint and see what's causing the crash.\n. Well, TSMessages uses resource_bundles, like described here: http://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podspec.html#resource_bundles\n\nAre you using Cocoapods for integrating this library?\n. Can you check if the resource bundle was properly installed with your app in the simulator?\n. All this should be fixed with the latest version on master. I'll release a Cocoapods update later today\n. Implemented with https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/2b3d85dcedb768b735e77c2bc69f2edacf720a6a\n. It is possible to slide up using the position enum: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/blob/master/Pod/Classes/TSMessage.h#L42\n\nRight now, it's not officially possible to pass a custom view.\n\nHowever, as you can see here: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/blob/master/Pod/Classes/TSMessageView.m#L323\nTSMessages accesses the bottom of the view like this: \n\n```\nviewController.view.bounds.size.height\n```\n\nIt's not a super clean, but it should work when you pass a UIViewController with your view. \n\nLet me know if that works. \n. I'll close this issue for now. Let me know if you run into another problem.\n. Looks great, thanks for the pull request.\nCould you provide one example as well in the example project? You can just add another button for it\n. Thanks! :+1: \n. You need the 4 source files and the resources, added into a bundle.\nIs there a reason you don't use Cocoapods?\n\nMaybe it should be easier to integrate TSMessages without Cocoapods\n. I updated the README for manual installation: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages#manually\nAnd: I removed the need of a resource bundle with this commit: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/118e9f24d218ef00770c18dd93b8477c7a7ba75b\n\nDoes this fix your problem?\n. Hi,\nThere is no development team, just people who do that in their free time ;)\nCan you reproduce this issue on your development machine in your simulator?\n. Closed due to inactivity. \n. Thanks, I merged a pull request, can you make sure it solves your problem? (https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/pull/183)\n. Thanks for the pull request :+1: \n. Looks like quite a hack with the registerForRemoteNotifications\n. @ming517 Does this commit fix your problem? https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/b9ba02be0b936c30d12f85ed0e3dd2ee7eb4e1c6\nAre you using the latest version from the master branch?\n. Does everything work now with the current master branch?\n. Hi @Abeansits,\nYes, that is correct, the last release was in August: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/releases\nYou have to use the latest version from master using in your Podfile:\n`pod 'TSMessages', :head`\nwhich will always use the latest version from the master branch\n. That means, the configuration JSON file could not be found. Can you check your app bundle if it's containing a TSMessages bundle?\n. This whole bundle thing does not work as great as expected..\n. @Abeansits Thanks for your report. This seems to really cause many problems. I'll remove the resource bundle for now and release a new version today! :+1: \n. The latest version on master should work now: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/118e9f24d218ef00770c18dd93b8477c7a7ba75b\nI'll release a Cocoapods update later today.\n. I'm glad to hear that :+1: \n. Thank you @Abeansits!\n. Can you check your .app folder if it contains the TSMessages bundle with the containing this file: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/blob/master/Pod/Assets/TSMessagesDefaultDesign.json\n\nCan you set a breakpoint at https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/blob/master/Pod/Classes/TSMessageView.m#L76 and see if the values are set correctly or if it is nil.\n. Can you try the latest version on master? I refactored some things, it should work better now.\n. Well, yes, there hasn't been a new release yet: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/releases\nif you want to use the latest version, you can also just specify your Podfile like this\n\npod 'TSMessages', :head\n\nWe'll release a new version when it's necessary\n. Fixed with https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/c5e31696206a6586d618edc429156825fda7c68a\n. That totally makes sense! Good and clean solution. Thanks :+1: \n. Unfortunately this didn't make it into the last release...\n. Could you please briefly explain what you've changed and why?\n. This looks good. Pull requests are welcome :+1: \n. Looks great, thanks for the pull request :+1: \n\nCould you just fix the merge conflicts:\n\n> We can\u2019t automatically merge this pull request.\n\nThanks!\n. Thanks @diogomaximo for working on this! :+1: \n. And sorry it took so long :disappointed: \n. A method like this is already implemented: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/blob/master/Pod/Classes/TSMessage.m#L378\nAm I missing something? \n. Thanks for your pull request anyway :+1: \n. Ui, thanks for the warning. It seems like it's broken because the repository is now moved over to my account. I'll take a closer look.\n. Ha, you can still download the repository as zip and run the example there ;) \n. Thanks @kimar, looks good :+1: \n. Thanks, nice catch :+1: \n. Are you referring to https://github.com/KrauseFx/TSMessages/pull/196? If so, there was no new CocoaPods release in the mean time. You have to use the latest version from `:head`\n\nLet me know if it works.\n. @kiliankoe @davidrothera To be honest I'm afraid a new version introduces new errors, as the last release has been ages ago... I haven't had time to maintain TSMessages recently unfortunately. I'd like to bring TSMessages up to date again soon.\n\nIs there a reason you don't want to define the `:head` option in your `Podfile`?\n. Thanks :+1: \n. Thank you @hamin :+1: \n. @mRs- Shouldn't that be a major version bump as it breaks compatibility? \n. Thanks :+1: \n. Submitting of updates doesn't work via GitHub any more as far as I know.\n. Sorry, probably not.\n. > UP!!!!\n\nWhat do you mean? \n\nYou know you can always use the latest version from the master branch by specifying your dependency in your `Podfile`?\n. I like the idea, but TSMessages is not in active development unfortunately. Also, the method headers are a big pain, as there are so many parameters already. This would all be awesome in Swift :+1: \n. Sorry, I wanted to do that, but never found the time to. I don't know about good alternatives out of the top of my head.\n. Looks good, thanks :+1: \n. Duplicate of https://github.com/KrauseFx/TSMessages/issues/261\n. This repo is not active \n. I did search for a long time, but nobody wanted to take over. Let me know if you find someone.\n. Hey @lolgear, sorry I completely missed this. I have notifications turned off for most GitHub repos. I'd be more than happy to hand you over the TSMessages main repo itself. It's used by more than 10,000 apps via CocoaPods: https://cocoapods.org/pods/TSMessages\r\n\r\nI'll grant you commit access, and we can move the repo into its own org if you'd like \ud83d\udc4d \r\n\r\nOne key requirement is to not break any existing setups, it should stay backwards compatible. . Seems like you can :) https://github.com/KrauseFx/TSMessages/blob/e63f23304f781dcadbac31e6d338f3105fb3cd78/Example/TSMessages/TSDemoViewController.m#L106. Hi, thanks for reporting it. \nI added MLColorAdditions as a submodule with the last commit: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/ba1b4c206a83032fdaa694be7e4e61a37f647dfb\nWithin the next few days I'll upload the pod to cocoapods (right now it's only a local pod you can use in your project).\nFelix\n. Thanks for the pull request! It was a general problem with landscape mode, not only iPad. I haven't used TSMessages in an iPad app yet.\n. Thanks for this pull request. I didn't know that.\n. Hi Tobias,\nI haven't watched many users using the app. There are two ways to reveal the menu above the navigation bar: Dragging it down and just tapping on it. If dragging doesn't work, the user can just tap it as well.\nFelix\n. Which view controller do you pass to the message class? It works fine in my projects.\nThere was already a pull request that should add a workaround: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/pull/3\n. It's related to this pull request commit: https://github.com/iSkythe/TSMessages/commit/2c05670ae0272bde5c73b87605465560713a8e2f\nI'll look into it, in the meantime you can also just subclass TSMessage and implement + (CGFloat)navigationbarBottomOfViewController:(UIViewController *)viewController to correct the value. Sorry about the troubles.\nIs the status bar hidden in your app? Maybe that's the reason for the 20px\n. I just tried the following\n- Added it to a UITableViewController: It does not scroll with the tableView, it stays on the top as expected\n- Added it to the navigation controller with a regular navigation bar and the status bar shown: Position as expected. \n- Added it to the navigation controller with the In-Call Status bar: Position as expected\n\nI tested it with the latest code from develop, I'm going to merge that back to master now.\n. Make sure you have the latest version, this has already been fixed: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/bbe67cb023e77a6159531374ac13b8230bb49cec\nStill, when rotating the device the notification does not automatically resize the message, which should be fixed within the next days.\n. @brooly: That's strange. Could you checkout the example project of this repo. It works fine on the iPad in portrait and landscape mode. \nCurrently the width is set using `self.viewController.view.frame.size.width`. Do you pass the proper view controller?\n. That makes sense, I'll include that fix in the commit.\n. Okay, the fix is included here: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/1ac157c17eed2d2ce8e6fea12084e45988326325\nI have not yet released an update of the cocoapod podspec file.\n. Hi,\nThanks for your contribution. \nShouldn't it be possible to integrate this feature by using autoresizingMasks? (UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth)\nUpdating the width after the rotation works fine, only the labels and the height of the view have to be changed after/during the rotation. \nIf we moved the code that sets all label related properties into an own method, that is called after/before the rotation we would only update the height of the view and the width of the label.\nMaybe that would an easier approach.\n. Hi,\nYou're right, the view is created before it is added as a subview. Anyway, we could easily just init the width and the labels of the notification as soon as it is shown.\n. I have re-written the code that managed the auto resizing and the duration of each view. It should be much cleaner now: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/25b81953bea85e8f7e9bc1397c03a3d8a081d506\nI'm still struggling why the tap and swipe gestures don't work any more.\nAlso the first time the device is rotated from landscape to portrait (if the view was set up in landscape mode), layoutSubviews is not called for some reason.\n. Everything works perfectly now: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/4017d4b02be2d212aaf2fd320484f622aa290d81\nI'll just have to do some more testing before merging with master and updating the cocoapods version.\nCould you also try if it works for you?\nThanks\nFelix\n. That is a nice idea. Should the block be an optional parameter when creating a notification?\n. Check out my last commit in Develop: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/4ffeb451336871e1c46c18abe4b2145bce2b22b9\nIt's not entirely finished, but it should work. The block is only called, when the user manually dismisses the message by tapping on it or swiping it up.\nRight now, I still have problems with the gesture recognizer in the Develop branch. That's why you can't really test it right now.\n. Check out the latest version on the Develop branch, everything should work already: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commits/develop\nI'll merge it into master today.\n. Thanks for your contribution, I merged it to the current develop branch: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/c9140781144f2c4d8d8d30b4d097510d42639a7a\nI worked on the automatic adapting of the width when the device orientation changes in develop and merge it to master as soon as that is completely finished.\n. Thanks. It really wouldn't be complicated to implement. I'm not aware of any use case yet, maybe you can explain it? If there are more users, requesting this feature, I could easily implement it.\n. Looks good, yes. We could also add another initializer that takes a view as parameter, so you could easily add an \"Add\" button on the right side\n. Here we go: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/4e05fc8d499aa6af34d41dd16569633d1377589c\nJust use the new initializer to setup your notification and it will automatically be shown at the bottom of the view controller.\nThe gesture recognizer for dismissing the callout was also updated to use the other swiping direction.\n. This change is not yet available via cocoapods, so please clone or download the project and include it manually.\n. Does it affect only the notifications on the bottom?\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\nOn 26.04.2013, at 22:12, forward6 notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n@KrauseFx https://github.com/KrauseFx First, thanks for this enhancement!\nBut I think this might have introduced a new bug with device orientation.\nDo you need more details?\n\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on\nGitHubhttps://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/issues/12#issuecomment-17097506\n.\n. This problem is fixed now: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/620dcc585654da440ec84f4a8e3d1c8a0d0fa76c (Thanks Yann)\n. Thanks for reporting. Looks like I have to change it to readwrite: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4837565/objective-c-private-public-properties-making-a-property-readonly-for-outsi\nI'll update and test it with the next commit.\n. I don't get a warning  when analyzing the project. Where did you see the warning? Do you use the latest version of the code?\n. Hi, \nIf I understand you correctly, you just have to pass your UINavigationController instead of the view controller to get it to work.\nLet me know if that fixes your problem.\nFelix\n. Should be fixed now: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/3153a5fd43ad5d7c400d46dfa80fa01f83627a66\nThanks for the report\n. Thanks for reporting this crash. I've never experienced that nor got a crash report. I added the additional checks into the code in the last commit: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/c98c6cf6821830aae1fe1da4a3e2c6d504da91da \nCould you check if that solves the problem?\n. Okay, good to know, the issue was fixed. Thanks\n. Thanks Jercik, for this pull requests.\nI fixed the rotation issues with the new functionality.\nAlso I added automatic sizing of the button instead of using a fixed value.\nYou can take a look at the commit here: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/3e97969ed2ef81fb03daa9053cbc2e6402596e92\nFelix\n. Looks great, thank you. Have you tested it with two nil values?\n. Shouldn't we just add an initializer that takes an UIView instead of extending the button functionality. I'm with you, there should be an easy and fast way to add a button to the notification. Still, when we offer a way to pass an UIView object every developer can decide how much he wants to customize.\n. @Jercik Thanks for your contribution, it's merged now: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/7d6feabaa1c307cf4aad917f6bc12c2fcdfd135b\n. I guess that's a really good idea in the case of the missing network connection. In my apps I'm showing the internet error message whenever the user does anything that requires the internet connection.\n. How about passing -1 as duration to show a message with no limited duration which you can manually dismiss in your code? Adding another parameter just for that might be a bit too much. It would be a constant that contains the -1 value.\n. Oh yes, there is a way. It's not yet on Cocoapods but on the master branch: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/e5ab6fc48a779545b38ed917ccf56be936f94e8c\n. Here we go: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/967694472f2aa1b0564368c86cc4d73f9a3c01f2\nTake a look at the new example code that shows you how to add this kind of message. Let me know if it works as expected, I'll update the Podspec then.\n. Awesome. I'll create and release the Cocoapods update tomorrow.\n. Okay, I released the Cocoapods update. We have to wait until it gets approved by the Cocoapods Team\n. Dismissing the currently displayed message is easily possible\n\n``` objective-c\n[[[TSMessage sharedMessage].messages lastObject] fadeMeOut];\n```\n\nBut yes, I could provide a convenience method for that.\n\nWhy would you want to know when the message is hidden automatically?\n. Providing a - (BOOL)hideActiveMessage is a good idea, I'll implement this little feature now.\n. Dismissing the currently active notification by code is now possible: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/e5ab6fc48a779545b38ed917ccf56be936f94e8c\n. Dismissing the currently shown notification is now possible. \nCalling a block after the message is gone, no matter if triggered by user or the timeout is not yet implemented.\n. Thank you @interstateone ;)\n. So the dismissedBlock is triggered as well when tapping the UIButton? Does the current implementation without this fix cause any problems?\n. The behavior of the message when tapping on the button of the notification view is correct. The notification disappears and both the dismiss callback and the button callback are triggered.\n. This should be fixed now: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/81ead4c5d9311cd578af71376f5496be7b48ba4e (Thanks @fawkeswei)\n. Hi, thanks for contacting me. When I was looking for a light weight library that only parses Hex colors I found yours was the smallest and best version.\nAt first it was a submodule/pod dependency, but I removed it in this commit: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/3153a5fd43ad5d7c400d46dfa80fa01f83627a66\nSomehow it was duplicated for some users which then caused warnings in Xcode. \n\nWhat has changed in your 2.0 version?\n. Yes, if you want you can switch TSMessages to have a Cocoapods dependency instead. I wanted to avoid having to run 'pod update' before the example project would work. When cloning/downloading the repo, the example project should be instantly compilable.\n. I don't get any warnings when compiling or analyzing the project. \nYes, it should be a 'private' method.\n\nIf you want it would be great if you could provide a pull request for this issue.\n. Thanks for the contribution\n. Thanks for the contribution. Were you experiencing issues when using TSMessages in landscape/portrait mode?\n. Hi @TheCocoaNaut,\nAs mentioned in the AppleDocs comment:\n`@param callback The block that should be executed, when the user tapped on the message`\nis this callback only executed, when the user manually dismisses the messages, like tapping or swiping it.\n\nCalling a block after the message is gone, no matter if triggered by user or the timeout is not yet implemented, as mentioned in this issue: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/issues/21\n\nSince a few developers already requested this feature, I'll probably add this feature to the next Cocoapods release.\n. I'll close the issue. If you have any other questions feel free to post them here.\n. Hello,\nYou are right. My first thought were to just customize and change the values of design.json. This isn't possible when using Cocoapods.\nAssigning a custom file name before using this class like [TSMessage setDesignConfigurationFileName:@\"otherFile.json\"] would be a nice option I guess.\nWould that be a good solution?\n. Thanks for your great contribution. I merged it just now. I haven't yet tried loading a custom design file, the default one works fine.\n\nI used these files in my apps for a year already and it wasn't planned to release it in the beginning. That's why it may not be perfect to customize right now. One temporary solution would be to just copy the files into your project and change what you need.\n\nI have to come up with a more general solution for adding more designs in the future.\n. Hi,\nThis works pretty well for me. Have you tried passing the ViewController instead of the UINavigationController?\nHave you tried the example project? It should work fine there.\nFelix\n. I'll close the issue for now. Let me know if you have any further questions.\n. Thank you! That looks great. I'll take a look into it the next few days and test it. \nJust out of curiosity: could you show us a screenshot of your customized notification view?\n. Thanks for the contribution! \n. As you can see, it does work in the demo project which has a tab bar. I used the default Storyboard TabBarController template from Apple to setup the demo project. \n\nWhat's the problem when you use it in your application? 20px for the status bar?\n. Why did you close the pull request?\n. There should be no problem with the refresh control itself. I'm currently working on this issue and will update it in the next few hours.\n. A new way to set a custom vertical offset was added: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/e30c1fc46ab85e104b428283185faac464e8af8a\nYou can set a delegate which returns the top position you actually want to use. It's not a perfect solution yet, but it should work for now. \nLet me know if that fixes your problem.\n. Hello,\nYou only have to import TSMessages.h. I guess it has something to do with the passed ViewController. Have you tried passing the active navigation controller instead?\nYou could NSLog the exact location of the TSMessageView, by adding the breakpoint/NSLog statement in 'TSMessage.m' to - (void)fadeInCurrentNotification to the [UIView animateWithDuration....\nAlso you could try using recursive descriptions there to determine if the view was properly added as a subview.\n. I'll close the issue for, feel free to reopen it when you need help.\n. Oh yes, it works for me in my project.\nI use both the default view controller and the navigatoinBottomOfViewController. Have you tried setting a break point? If that won't help maybe you could provide a little example project that demonstrates this issue.\nThanks\n. You are right, I just tried it and it seems to not work. I have to fix it. Thanks a lot for reporting\n. Well yes, it's getting pretty large, but as long as it should be a \"one liner\" it has to be like that. \nThe other way would be:\n\n``` objectivec\nTSMessage *warningMessage = [TSMessage initWithType:... title:...];\nwarningMessage.duration = 3;\nwarningMessage.callback = ...\netc....\n[warningMessage show];\n```\n\nwhich is kind of annoying.\n. A new way to set a custom vertical offset was added: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/e30c1fc46ab85e104b428283185faac464e8af8a (I think that is your second account, right?)\n. Thanks for the contribution. I'll update the comments and work on some other issues before I'm going to release the next cocoapods update.\n. Is this still an issue? I think the behaviour has already changed\n. Thanks for the contribution. My apps don't support iOS 5, that's why I didn't notice the wrong behavior. \n. Thanks for the pull requests. Seems to be working fine now.\n. These delegate methods were added in this commit: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/81ead4c5d9311cd578af71376f5496be7b48ba4e\ndue to an issue with iOS 5: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/issues/40\n. Oh, that's right. Currently only - (BOOL)gestureRecognizer:(UIGestureRecognizer *)gestureRecognizer shouldReceiveTouch:(UITouch *)touch is implemented. My apps don't support iOS 5, which is why the fix is from someone else.\n\nWhen I merge your pull request, it will break iOS 5 again, right?\n. Thanks for your contribution :+1: \n. Could you set a break point for all exceptions to see which line is causing the problem?\n. I guess it's the NSJSON line, right?\nPlease check if the JSON file was properly included. Do you use the Cocoapods version of TSMessages?\nAs you can see, the library tries to load a file name after the constant 'TSDesignFileName', that was not properly included in the project.\nI hope that helps.\n. Glad it works now\n. Thanks for your contribution, but iOS 5 and iOS 6 are no longer supported by TSMessages.\n. Thanks for your contribution, your commit is merged: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/ae51dd39ef18a5c651d792e8e78e89cea934e7ae\n. Thanks for your contribution\n. That's right, currently the keyboard is not being taken into account to calculate the Y-position when the notification is displayed on the bottom.\n. I'm pretty sure it is still an issue. When shown from the bottom, we do not take the keyboard into account.\n. Thanks Matthias for your Pull Request. Merged (https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/acb1d9c7233f3faf3b03e76450f26bedc38665dd) and a little bug fix (https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/599ccb78cab9e5c35f37db5f1ababdd715561709)\n. Okay, I updated the way of setting up a notification view: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/3389c829bff8834f7765ffcaead6007b9b8e324f\n\nExample: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/#to-show-notifications-use-the-following-code\nWhat do you think?\n. Yes, that would be awesome. Right now, we haven't started redesigning all our apps for iOS 7. \n\n![687474703a2f2f7777772e746f7572737072756e672e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323031332f30342f694e6f74696669636174696f6e4572726f722e706e67](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/869950/916003/49fef672-fe7f-11e2-81c8-5bbe83f6af32.png)\n\nThat's the current style. What should be changed besides removing the gradient and adding the blur effect? Adding the blur effect should be done by using a UIToolbar, right?\n\nThe font shadow has to be removed as well?\n. I'm working on it right now\n. For some reason, the UINavigationBar subviews decide to be hidden. My current state: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/60be36140ef8d4a25dd00bbd6e70777c8509f3d4\nI'll try to fix it in the next view days. In the mean time, I just use a transparent layer for iOS 7 instead.\nUp until now I had no problems using the blur effect in my apps.\n@myell0w Maybe you could take a look at the toolbar?\n. Wow, thanks @myell0w! :+1: \nI added support for iOS 6 and iOS 7 in parallel based on the currently used Base SDK and the OS on the device: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/861e2ed540ac50939f4a298692aa2885a39ab0e7\n. Makes sense, thanks! :+1: \n. Sorry guys for the troubles. Yes, that's because of iOS 7\n. Hi Guys,\nSorry again for breaking the project. I fixed the iOS 7 related build error when using an old Base SDK: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/861e2ed540ac50939f4a298692aa2885a39ab0e7\nI'll take a look at the missing file.\n. When downloading this repository as zip, the project compiles perfectly.\nHexColor should be included automatically when you 'pod update'. Are you using Cocoapods?\n. Okay, when you use submodules, you also have to include a submodule for HexColor. \nCocoapods takes care of that dependency automatically.\n. Okay, I'll close the issue for now, since I think most people will use Cocoapods to include this library and it's easy to just drag in the required folder.\n. Thanks for your Pull Request, but I think there should be a more general solution. Like passing any UIView object and choosing the position (left or right side) and TSMessages will take care of positioning it properly.\nI'll implement this functionality in the future.\n. Great and easy fix, thanks for your contribution!\n. Looks great, thanks for your contribution :+1: \n. Thank you! :+1: \n. Thanks for your pull request. So your solution dismisses and removes the message view from the queue as soon as another view controller was pushed or the current one was popped from the navigation stack?\n. Looks great, thanks.\n. Yes, that's because you don't use Cocoapods. Is there a reason you don't use it?\nI haven't integrated TSMessages 'manually' yet. \n. I'll take a look into it when I have more time. Thanks for reporting this issue.\n. Looks good, thanks. @dennisreimann can you confirm it works for your project as well?\n. @mRs- Might that be related to this pull request or is it another issue?\n. Hi Marius,\nWith the latest 0.9.4 update I removed those initializers to clean up the available methods. I'm not entirely sure it's a good idea to offer any available combination of parameters, that's why I reduced them to the most important ones and a designated one.\n\nI wanted to work on something different: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/issues/54 but that was too much work with the current way notification views are created.\n. I'm really not sure. As mentioned at https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/issues/54 I think the best solution would be to create a simple messages view object and then customize the properties you want to change.\n. That's possible in the latest develop branch by setting the duration directly to the TSMessageView\n. I think this pull request probably broke notifications that are displayed on the bottom\n. Thanks for reporting.\nIt's really strange your notifications don't have a background in iOS 7. What base SDK did you use? It looks like it's an empty app/project, could you attach an example project?\nI can image what causes the wrong location on the bottom. It's related to this Pull Request: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/pull/66 commit: https://github.com/mRs-/TSMessages/commit/d00a3579df66aa857c6fbfb265f648d1f7d7b040\nI could image we have to check if the notification is displayed on the top.\n. Are you using the latest master or the latest Cococapods release? Maybe the wrong position has been around for a while.\n. Yes, you can customize the background. In iOS 7 it's a static color defined in the TSMessagesDefaultDesign.json file, on iOS 6 and below a gradient image file is used. \n. Yes, thanks. I'll look into it when I have more time.\n\nHave you tried using the latest release instead of the latest master?\n. Does this problem still exist? I'll close this issue for now, since we're dropping iOS 6 support.\n. @dimohamdy Sorry, if something doesn't work in iOS 6 can still use an older version (https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/releases)\n\nBut: TSMessages should work fine with iOS 5 and up: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/blob/master/TSMessages.podspec#L26\n\nIf not, the podspec file is wrong and needs to be updated. \n. Thanks for the pull request\n. Nice catch, thanks!\n. iOS 6 support will be dropped with the 1.0 release. Does this bug still exist with the today's release?\n. Thanks for the pull request\n. @getaaron Yes, that would make sense. TSMessages needs more updates for better iOS 7 support/design, like new icons and no font shadow.\n@jkrzemie The code does not work when I set a font family and no font size. Also the default values of the configuration file should match the default design.\n. When we change something in the font system, we should use the proper iOS 7 API as @getaaron mentioned. I have not yet tested how TSMessageView behaves when the text height changes. \n. Sorry about that, this is related to the last commit of my colleague: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/9587e8432e84f77094c3f90e4dba5c86468e8715 \nWe'll provide a fix in a minute.\n. Awesome, thanks @onato! :+1: \n@shams-ahmed Let us know if everything works fine now.\n. It seems like the becomeFirstResponder is executed before the textfield looses its focus. Have you tried using a dispatch_after?\n. That means it's not a problem of TSMessages itself ;)\n. How about not dismissing the keyboard when the user taps the 'Continue' button and first check if everything is valid? \n. Sorry, I'm not working on this issue.\n. Looks great. Have you tested the changes on iOS 6 and the old Xcode as well?\n\nThanks for your contribution\n. No, firstObject is available since a few major versions of iOS, it just wasn't public. \nYes, I guess we can drop Xcode 4 support of the example project now.\n. It was mentioned on Objc.io: http://www.objc.io/issue-5/iOS7-hidden-gems-and-workarounds.html in the first paragraph.\n. Makes sense.\nThanks for your contribution :+1: \n. Hi,\nThat's because the custom design file was not yet updated for iOS 7 with the new background color property, instead of the background image.\nThanks for reporting\n. As you mentioned, when you tap on the 'custom' button, it will load the AlternativeDesign.json file, which was not yet updated to support iOS 7. \nTSMessagesDefaultDesign.json is working fine.\n. This is fixed now on the develop branch: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/8d446be0a1bbdb584c78eb11997e71f4f2bbcef0\nWill be released with version 1.0\n. Hello, sure, just set the navigation controller as the default view controller.\n. Does it work as expected?\n. Have you tried running the Example project? Does the iOS 7 style work for you? \nI guess it's because of a wrong Base SDK\n. I haven't had time to update the code to using iOS_UIImageEffects. Pull Requests welcome.\n. Yes, I guess it's not clear when not reading the whole documentation of the project. I still want to possibility to pass a viewController instead. \nGlad it works now.\n. @PathonHauser sorry, closed it by mistake.\n. I'll close this issue and keep talking about this problem on this one: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/issues/109\nWith the 1.0 release, there will be a blur effect\n. Hi,\nThanks for the report. That's right, the iOS 7 style is currently broken (related: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/issues/82)\nHave you tried passing the navigationController as viewController when showing the message?\n. There is already a Cocoapod: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/blob/master/TSMessages.podspec.\nJust add pod 'TSMessages' to your Podfile.\n. Awesome, have fun :+1: \n. It sounds like most of your wished functionality is not possible with the current TSMessages \"API\".\nI guess the best solution for you would be a fork where you add the feature you need and hand in a pull request for each individual feature.\n. Sorry, there are a few things that need to be improved:\n- There is no animation when dismissing the message manually by tapping\n- It takes too long to display the message - it should be displayed very fast\n\nI couldn't test TSMessages in iOS 6. Have you tried it? Is it the exact same behaviour as before?\n. This seems to be an issue of your configuration file. It works fine in my project and in the examples: https://www.dropbox.com/s/bpfvhbexmr9i1m6/Screenshot%202013-12-03%2009.38.41.png\n. I'll close this issue for now.\n. Hello, I guess the calculations are wrong for your use case: it looks like TSMessages assume you have a statusbar. \nSince iOS 7, the message is also displayed behind the navigation bar, which looks great with a regular navigation bar.\nI guess it's currently not possible to have a navigation bar without an image or color. You can fork TSMessages to modify this behaviour for your use case.\n. That looks odd, seems to be related to this issue: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/issues/88\nDoes this work for the default TSMessage style as well? It just seems like there is no padding calculated for the icon.\n. Does this problem still exist?\n. Closed because of no activity. Let me know if you have this problem again.\n. You could always use [UIApplication sharedApplication].keyWindow.rootViewController\nThis is already used as default VC if you don't pass one on the latest version of master. Let me know if that works for you.\n. Hi Steven,\nThanks for your really great Pull Request. It's clear what you did and well documented, thank you for that!\nIt makes sense separating those two functionalities.\nGreetings\nFelix\n. This would definitely be a nice new feature.\n. Thanks for reporting. This is fixed already: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/blob/master/TSMessages/Views/TSBlurView.m#L46\nThere is no Cocoapods release yet, so you could just use the latest master or a specific commit which fixes this warning.\n. Hi,\nSorry, custom views are not yet supported, but I think this would be a very nice and flexible addition. Currently it's only possible to add a button to the message, which was not yet updated for iOS 7...\nCheers\n. That's right. A TSMessage can also be dismissed by tapping it, triggering the given block.\n. I agree with @getaaron here. It makes no sense to drag down a TSMessageView\n. Thanks for reporting the issue, a new Cocoapods release is really overdue.\nI don't understand: how did that take you a couple of hours? Don't you use the autocompletion of Xcode/AppCode?\n. The documentation will be updated with the 1.0 release\n. It was updated :) Thanks for reporting.\n. Sorry, I can't tell you what's causing this problem. Does it work when you display it on the top? Is the keyboard still shown when you call the TSMessage method?\n. Any updates on this?\n. Perfect, that's good to hear :) \n. Sorry, right now that's not planned.\n. Text Alignment will be possible very soon.\n. Custom subviews should allow you do implement all this: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/issues/97\nThis feature is not yet finished.\n. In the meantime you can use this fork: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/pull/108\n. Thanks @dennisreimann for answering.\n. This looks amazing! I'll take a look and test it! :+1: \n. I can't tell you. Have you tried setting up a clean project and including TSMessages in the Podfile? Also have you tried 'pod update' and 'pod install'?\n. I don't think that's a good and clean solution. Have you tried using the latest version from the master branch? The Cocoapods Release is pretty also and I didn't have the guts to release a new version yet. The 'head' has already a fix for the warning.\n. Currently that's not possible. \nYou can take a look at TSMessageView.m:340\nCurrently I'm using sizeToFit for the titleLabel. You'd have to change that to use the full width and set the textAlignment to center.\n. We'll merge this pull request with the 1.0 release. \n. When it crashes there, the color value seems to be empty. Check if the json file for the design was properly delivered with the app.\n. It's working fine over here... As @mafellows mentioned, it seems to have a naming conflict with other classes. \n. Yes, that's exactly what I'm concerned about. The designated initialiser grows and grows.\n\nThere is already an issue with some thoughts about that: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/issues/54\n\nI guess a major redesign of the TSMessages library would be necessary for this change.\n. Well, it's not something that's your fault or your job. It's something I've been unhappy with TSMessages for a long time now. @dennisreimann and me are working on a better solution, where we can add your great new option for text alignment as well.\nI'll keep this issue open, since it might be interesting for other users as well. \n\nThanks for your contribution :+1: \n. Yes, the blur implementation is still old and needs to be replaced.\n. @dennisreimann Another dependency is fine I guess. It's better than copying the files or implementing our own blur. Is there any big disadvantage of a new dependency?\n. Nice catches there, thanks :+1: \n. @dennisreimann Thanks for migrating the changes to the current develop branch. \n\nWe could merge this PR and release one last version before 1.0 that features this PR and also the default behaviour of tap to dismiss\n. You Sir, are amazing! Thanks for the great contribution. I'm taking a look at those changes right now :+1: \n. Points I noticed:\n- [x] Messages are not dismissible by tapping the message (by default). I think that's very important, since users tend to just ignore alerts/messages and try to get them out of their way\n- [x] Shouldn't userDimissEnabled be default? It was until now and would require a lot of work to change that.\n- [x] The Pull Request for Permanent messages is already in this one as well, right? (#112)\n- The button needs to be re-styled for iOS 7.\n\nI guess it would also be fine to merge the following pull requests into the develop branch here:\n- [x] #111 from you\n- [ ] #87 from @toco\n- [ ] #103 from @srekke \n- [ ] #108 (we might have to update it to not use a new initialiser) from @ricardopereira. In this case it would easily be possible to have a setTextAlignment before presenting the message.\n\nI guess that would be [a really nice 1.0 release](https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/issues?milestone=1&state=open):\n- [ ] iOS 7 only with improved iOS 7 style and UIKit Dynamics\n- [ ] Priorities for TSMessages\n- [ ] Text Alignment support\n- [ ] Easier setting up of TSMessages\n. Mh, it works fine for me. Which base SDK are you using? Which code base? (master? develop? Cocoapods Release?)\n. @mRs- Yes, that's task I opened. We should be using resource bundles for the assets: http://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podspec.html#resource_bundles\nWe'd have to replace the called [UIImage imageNamed:\"imageName\"] to [UIImage imageNamed:\"[BundleName]/imageName\"] and define that in the podspec.\n. This was implemented with this commit: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/5908e4ca00d5f0397549a18f9ff4d6502294c66d\n. When you want to overwrite the style/design, just use your JSON file with the updated colours.\n. Yes, Tweetbot implemented it so the user can't see how bad the reception after tweeting something :P \n\nI think that's not in the scope of TSMessages. There are some other projects that do that pretty well.\n. Awesome, thanks! I updated the README (https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/b9d9ee3dae97059733e87b5aa3d05594b294300d)\n. First of all: Think about if you really want to show a notification every time the connection is lost. Why not just display it, when the user executes an action that requires a working internet connection?\n\nTo your problem: What does the alpha of your labels have to do with TSMessages? What's exactly not working? \n. Probably TSMessages is not the right project then, sorry. \n. Maybe @NicHuang means: I want to show the **same** notification on all view controllers. \nI think what you want is a sticky notification, that can be created by setting a custom duration. \n\n```\n/** This enum can be passed to the duration parameter */\ntypedef NS_ENUM(NSInteger,TSMessageNotificationDuration) {\n    TSMessageNotificationDurationAutomatic = 0,\n    TSMessageNotificationDurationEndless = -1 // The notification is displayed until the user dismissed it or it is dismissed by calling dismissActiveNotification\n};\n```\n. That's easy: just pass your navigation controller. \n\nSent from my iPhone\n\n> On 13.03.2014, at 03:31, NicHuang notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> I'm sorry that I didn't make it clear and there was some typo in my post. \n> I use AFNetReachabilityManager to monitor the internet.

Thanks for letting us know to remove the image property, since it's not used any more.\nIt was used before for iOS 6 to create a gradient effect.\n. I'll leave the issue open, since we still have to remove the property from the JSON file.\n. @mRs- Nope, it's more of a clean up for 1.0\n. Makes no sense cleaning this up as long as we're supporting iOS 6 and below.\n. So the old version didn't have this problem?\nThat looks really odd. This is caused by TSMessages? \n\nAll TSMessages does is create a new view, add it as a subview of your given view(controller) and display it there.\n\n[currentView removeFromSuperView]; is a valid command: It is used to clean itself up and remove itself from the super view.\n\nAre you sure this problem is not caused by some of your code (e.g. hacky way to receive or modify an other view?)\n\nMaybe you could provide an example, it's difficult to guess.\n. Sorry, I had no time to look into it yet.\n. @cytryn Sorry, I don't completely understand the problem. \nWhen you pass TSMessageNotificationDurationEndless, the message will stay as long you don't call `[TSMessage dismissActiveNotification]`\nYou can easily call dismiss on viewWillDisappear\n. Could you please provide a little more details?\nCentering of the title is currently not possible AFAIK.\nWhen you want to change the background color I'd recommend duplicating the design file, rename it to your own and use this design file: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/blob/master/TSMessages/Classes/TSMessage.h#L154\n\n[TSMessage addCustomDesignFromFileWithName:@\"file_name\"]\n. Tap to dismiss is really important and should be back to TSMessages as soon as possible. @dennisreimann @mRs- What's the current status about that? Should we release an update just for tap to dismiss?\n. This fix does work for me and looks great. @cytryn What's the problem with this PR? I tried the updated example project and it works fine.\n\n@schystz Thanks for your contribution :+1: \n. I just submitted the new version https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs/pull/10572\n. @cytryn Sorry, mentioned you by mistake. \n@harshitgupta What's not working for you with this pull request?\n. Have you tried the example project? It works fine there. Which SDK are you using? Maybe it's some of your code in your project causing this issue? Are you using a fixed notification?  \n. @cytryn yes, that makes sense!\n. Thanks Marius :+1: \n. I just added a new version, where you have full control of the vertical position of your message view. \nAll you have to do is implement the delegate method and return the correct y position of your view.\n\nCheck out the commit here: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/36522b1bd5619e7331a6ca9c141562b7997df8db\nYou have to update to the latest version on master. When you're using Cocoapods, just add \n`pod \"TSMessages\", :head`\n\nI'll release a new update on cocoapods later today.\nPlease let me know if this fixes the problem.\n. I haven't had time to answer that yet. They is some method to get the current status bar height. \nLet me know if you can't find it. \n. This totally makes sense. I'd prefer to just offer an UIView as parameter instead to be fully flexible. What do you think?\n. Wow, this Pull Request is **huge**! Thanks a lot for your contribution. \nI hope I'll get to take a look at it in the next days.\n. @mRs- I think this should be in the 1.0 release. On the first glance, this PR looks really great and offers a nice way for developers to extend the functionality of TSMessages without touching the core.\nI still want to take a look at all changes in detail.\n\nHow about merging this PR into the develop branch and experiment with it a little?\n. That's difficult to reproduce. Could you provide an example project?\n. Check out the answer to this issue: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/issues/81\nYou can just pass the navigation controller to fix this issue.\n. Currently the TSMessages requires a view controller, which AFAIK does not make a lot of sense - it should be an UIView.\nAnyway, if you pass the UIWindow object as parameter, the message should be added as subview of the window and therefore covering the navigation bar. To make that work, you have to 'hack' a little bit by temporary adding the window as view of a view controller so TSMessage can access navController.view. I have no idea if this actually works, just some thoughts.\n\nAs you see in the screenshots in the README (https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages) there was never an implementation which covers the navigation bar.\n\nIs there any specific reason you want to do it? Don't you block the user from going back from the currently viewed view controller?\n. I just added a new version, where you have full control of the vertical position of your message view. \nAll you have to do is implement the delegate method and return the correct y position of your view.\n\nCheck out the commit here: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/36522b1bd5619e7331a6ca9c141562b7997df8db\nYou have to update to the latest version on master. When you're using Cocoapods, just add \n`pod \"TSMessages\", :head`\n\nI'll release a new update on cocoapods later today.\nPlease let me know if this fixes the problem.\n. Oh, I know what's causing that. I'll push an update in a minute. Sorry about that\n. Yep, it's working again: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/f3ae3ed40042bf21f5c3d3eb373a76721e5dda28\n. Yes, that's easily possible, just copy the content of the design JSON file, store it in another JSON file and call \n\n`[TSMessage addCustomDesignFromFileWithName:@\"AlternativeDesign.json\"];`\n\nTake a look at the example project to see a working implementation.\n. Ups, sounds like there is a major bug in the latest version which causes crashes. @mRs- can you release a hotfix for that?\n. Sorry, TSMessages was built to only show one message at a time. Checkout our \"competitor\", ALAlertBanner, who can do that: https://github.com/alobi/ALAlertBanner\n. Mh, I'm not sure about this. I thought we had no shadow on iOS 7... I guess someone must have put that in again.\nAnyway, could you fix the whitespace / tab of the pull request? https://github.com/Hotel-Reservation-Service/TSMessages/blob/b02c913da7381937da89be2de734667f1a4bdb7e/TSMessages/Views/TSMessageView.m\n. Thanks for the pull request. It makes no sense to name it the same. \nJust removing '2 *' is no great solution.\nAs you see on the screenshots: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages the icon should be a little bit on the right. There should be an own value for the left side padding\n. So, when you don't want a border on iOS 6 as well and set a custom height, a border will still be created, but shouldn't be visible, right?\nI guess your PR makes sense, but it should also check if it's iOS 7. I think we should display no border on iOS 7.\n. Easy solution: On viewWillDisappear you call `[TSMessage dismissActiveNotification]`\n. I just added a new version, where you have full control of the vertical position of your message view. \nAll you have to do is implement the delegate method and return the correct y position of your view.\n\nCheck out the commit here: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/36522b1bd5619e7331a6ca9c141562b7997df8db\nYou have to update to the latest version on master. When you're using Cocoapods, just add \n`pod \"TSMessages\", :head`\n\nI'll release a new update on cocoapods later today.\n. This is fixed already, thanks for reporting.\n. Yep, sorry for the late response! It's merged. You have to use the :head option in Cocoapods until the next release.\n\nThanks for the pull request :+1: \n. Thanks for this pull request.\n@mRs- @forgot I don't think the TSMessages library should required AVFoundation. Instead how about putting the sound support in a sub spec? What do you think?\n. @forgot Thanks, yep, the pod spec looks fine. But I guess the code also has to be adapted: you can not include or call AVFoundation related code.\n. Yes, I guess it's not that easy. Maybe it would be interesting to add a delegate protocol for the messages, which can also be used by developers to do something when the message was dismissed?\n. Wow, that looks amazing. Thanks for your great contribution. I wonder why there was never a request for sound for messages - it's kind of obvious.\n. Yes, there is a milestone for that, containing a few issues: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/issues/milestones/1/edit\n. Hi, \nAFAIK the background alpha is only used on iOS 6 and below and was replaced by a blur effect in iOS 7\n. @JanC Update, sorry, it's not used any more.\nBut there is a new method now to easily change the alpha value: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/d6c9fffda0d5b7287c6561b32cf4fbe8623b4ecc\nJust implement the delegate method.\nYou have to use the latest version on master. I'll probably release a new version later today.\n. I guess that would be something for @mRs-, who is the developer of HexColors\n. I agree with @mRs- here. It's an advantage to have a dependency to not pull the same code multiple times if it's already in the project\n. What alternative to Hex codes would you use in our JSON configuration?\n. I just added a new version, where you have full control of the vertical position of your message view. \nAll you have to do is implement the delegate method and return the correct y position of your view.\n\nCheck out the commit here: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/36522b1bd5619e7331a6ca9c141562b7997df8db\nYou have to update to the latest version on master.

Perfect, thanks for letting me know.\n. Thanks for your pull request. I'm pretty sure, having just one line of title and the default icon should work just fine.\nIt probably broke with a recent change. Are you using the latest version from master branch or the latest release?\n. Sorry for not replying to your submitted issue. We currently have no active maintainer of TSMessages who checks all the pull requests, reviews it and tests them. We had a few problems in the past, breaking TSMessages for many users. \nI'll take a look at this pull request, thanks for submitting! :+1: \n. Thanks for your contribution :+1: \nYou still have to use the :head option in Cocoapods to apply this change.\n. Can you check if all the required images + icons are in your .app folder? \n. Thanks, this is resolved now :+1: \n. Already merged with https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/pull/157\nThanks\n. Sorry, you're the first who asked. Personally I'd like to provide a way to provide a custom view to solve all those kinds of requests - unfortunately haven't got the time to implement it yet\n. Temporary solution for now: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/d6c9fffda0d5b7287c6561b32cf4fbe8623b4ecc\nYou can now provide a custom subview to a message.\n. Related (your own issue :)) https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/issues/97\nI'll close this one for now. \n. I just commited a new version, where you have full control of the vertical position of your message view. \nAll you have to do is implement the delegate method and return the correct y position of your view.\n\nCheck out the commit here: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/36522b1bd5619e7331a6ca9c141562b7997df8db\nYou have to update to the latest version on master. When you're using Cocoapods, just add \n`pod \"TSMessages\", :head`\n\nI'll release a new update on cocoapods later today.\n. Oh, that makes sense. I'll publish a fix for that.\n. Okay, fixed with https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/92fd1a9c3db64615c11aa8d04cab955624457845\n\nIt was only related to the example project. The method itself works in your project, right?\n. That usually means, the file cannot be found. Can you check your [appname].app bundle if your JSON file exists? Set an exception breakpoint and see what's causing the crash.\n. Well, TSMessages uses resource_bundles, like described here: http://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podspec.html#resource_bundles\n\nAre you using Cocoapods for integrating this library?\n. Can you check if the resource bundle was properly installed with your app in the simulator?\n. All this should be fixed with the latest version on master. I'll release a Cocoapods update later today\n. Implemented with https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/2b3d85dcedb768b735e77c2bc69f2edacf720a6a\n. It is possible to slide up using the position enum: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/blob/master/Pod/Classes/TSMessage.h#L42\n\nRight now, it's not officially possible to pass a custom view.\n\nHowever, as you can see here: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/blob/master/Pod/Classes/TSMessageView.m#L323\nTSMessages accesses the bottom of the view like this: \n\n```\nviewController.view.bounds.size.height\n```\n\nIt's not a super clean, but it should work when you pass a UIViewController with your view. \n\nLet me know if that works. \n. I'll close this issue for now. Let me know if you run into another problem.\n. Looks great, thanks for the pull request.\nCould you provide one example as well in the example project? You can just add another button for it\n. Thanks! :+1: \n. You need the 4 source files and the resources, added into a bundle.\nIs there a reason you don't use Cocoapods?\n\nMaybe it should be easier to integrate TSMessages without Cocoapods\n. I updated the README for manual installation: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages#manually\nAnd: I removed the need of a resource bundle with this commit: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/118e9f24d218ef00770c18dd93b8477c7a7ba75b\n\nDoes this fix your problem?\n. Hi,\nThere is no development team, just people who do that in their free time ;)\nCan you reproduce this issue on your development machine in your simulator?\n. Closed due to inactivity. \n. Thanks, I merged a pull request, can you make sure it solves your problem? (https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/pull/183)\n. Thanks for the pull request :+1: \n. Looks like quite a hack with the registerForRemoteNotifications\n. @ming517 Does this commit fix your problem? https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/b9ba02be0b936c30d12f85ed0e3dd2ee7eb4e1c6\nAre you using the latest version from the master branch?\n. Does everything work now with the current master branch?\n. Hi @Abeansits,\nYes, that is correct, the last release was in August: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/releases\nYou have to use the latest version from master using in your Podfile:\n`pod 'TSMessages', :head`\nwhich will always use the latest version from the master branch\n. That means, the configuration JSON file could not be found. Can you check your app bundle if it's containing a TSMessages bundle?\n. This whole bundle thing does not work as great as expected..\n. @Abeansits Thanks for your report. This seems to really cause many problems. I'll remove the resource bundle for now and release a new version today! :+1: \n. The latest version on master should work now: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/118e9f24d218ef00770c18dd93b8477c7a7ba75b\nI'll release a Cocoapods update later today.\n. I'm glad to hear that :+1: \n. Thank you @Abeansits!\n. Can you check your .app folder if it contains the TSMessages bundle with the containing this file: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/blob/master/Pod/Assets/TSMessagesDefaultDesign.json\n\nCan you set a breakpoint at https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/blob/master/Pod/Classes/TSMessageView.m#L76 and see if the values are set correctly or if it is nil.\n. Can you try the latest version on master? I refactored some things, it should work better now.\n. Well, yes, there hasn't been a new release yet: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/releases\nif you want to use the latest version, you can also just specify your Podfile like this\n\npod 'TSMessages', :head\n\nWe'll release a new version when it's necessary\n. Fixed with https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/commit/c5e31696206a6586d618edc429156825fda7c68a\n. That totally makes sense! Good and clean solution. Thanks :+1: \n. Unfortunately this didn't make it into the last release...\n. Could you please briefly explain what you've changed and why?\n. This looks good. Pull requests are welcome :+1: \n. Looks great, thanks for the pull request :+1: \n\nCould you just fix the merge conflicts:\n\n> We can\u2019t automatically merge this pull request.\n\nThanks!\n. Thanks @diogomaximo for working on this! :+1: \n. And sorry it took so long :disappointed: \n. A method like this is already implemented: https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/blob/master/Pod/Classes/TSMessage.m#L378\nAm I missing something? \n. Thanks for your pull request anyway :+1: \n. Ui, thanks for the warning. It seems like it's broken because the repository is now moved over to my account. I'll take a closer look.\n. Ha, you can still download the repository as zip and run the example there ;) \n. Thanks @kimar, looks good :+1: \n. Thanks, nice catch :+1: \n. Are you referring to https://github.com/KrauseFx/TSMessages/pull/196? If so, there was no new CocoaPods release in the mean time. You have to use the latest version from `:head`\n\nLet me know if it works.\n. @kiliankoe @davidrothera To be honest I'm afraid a new version introduces new errors, as the last release has been ages ago... I haven't had time to maintain TSMessages recently unfortunately. I'd like to bring TSMessages up to date again soon.\n\nIs there a reason you don't want to define the `:head` option in your `Podfile`?\n. Thanks :+1: \n. Thank you @hamin :+1: \n. @mRs- Shouldn't that be a major version bump as it breaks compatibility? \n. Thanks :+1: \n. Submitting of updates doesn't work via GitHub any more as far as I know.\n. Sorry, probably not.\n. > UP!!!!\n\nWhat do you mean? \n\nYou know you can always use the latest version from the master branch by specifying your dependency in your `Podfile`?\n. I like the idea, but TSMessages is not in active development unfortunately. Also, the method headers are a big pain, as there are so many parameters already. This would all be awesome in Swift :+1: \n. Sorry, I wanted to do that, but never found the time to. I don't know about good alternatives out of the top of my head.\n. Looks good, thanks :+1: \n. Duplicate of https://github.com/KrauseFx/TSMessages/issues/261\n. This repo is not active \n. I did search for a long time, but nobody wanted to take over. Let me know if you find someone.\n. Hey @lolgear, sorry I completely missed this. I have notifications turned off for most GitHub repos. I'd be more than happy to hand you over the TSMessages main repo itself. It's used by more than 10,000 apps via CocoaPods: https://cocoapods.org/pods/TSMessages\r\n\r\nI'll grant you commit access, and we can move the repo into its own org if you'd like \ud83d\udc4d \r\n\r\nOne key requirement is to not break any existing setups, it should stay backwards compatible. . Seems like you can :) https://github.com/KrauseFx/TSMessages/blob/e63f23304f781dcadbac31e6d338f3105fb3cd78/Example/TSMessages/TSDemoViewController.m#L106. ",

Narrowed down the issue to the following lines of code in fadeInCurrentNotification\n\nCGSize statusBarSize = [UIApplication sharedApplication].statusBarFrame.size;\n\nThe statusBarFrame.size returned in iOS 8 is different from the size value returned in iOS 7\nstatusBarSize = (width=20, height=1024) - iOS 7.0 \nstatusBarSize = (width=1024, height=20) - iOS 8.0\n\nLooks like apple is taking into consideration the device orientation in iOS 8.0 when returning the statusBarFrame value.\n\nFix:\n\nSet a static value for the offset  as 20.0f\n\nor the following\n\nReplace \n\n```\n    BOOL isPortrait = UIInterfaceOrientationIsPortrait([[UIApplication sharedApplication] statusBarOrientation]);\n    CGSize statusBarSize = [UIApplication sharedApplication].statusBarFrame.size;\n    CGFloat offset = isPortrait ? statusBarSize.height : statusBarSize.width;\n    verticalOffset += offset;\n```\n\nwith \n\n```\n    CGSize statusBarSize = [UIApplication sharedApplication].statusBarFrame.size;\n\n    #if __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED >= 80000\n            verticalOffset += statusBarSize.height;\n            return;\n    #endif\n\n    BOOL isPortrait = UIInterfaceOrientationIsPortrait([[UIApplication sharedApplication] statusBarOrientation]);\n    CGFloat offset = isPortrait ? statusBarSize.height : statusBarSize.width;\n    verticalOffset += offset; \n```\n. KrauseFx,\n\nMade a mistake and used compile time directives instead of runtime check, sent a new pull request with the changes.\n. Used registerForRemoteNotifications as it was the first depreciation that i had to work around in the project that i'm working on when using iOS 8 SDK.\n.

Narrowed down the issue to the following lines of code in fadeInCurrentNotification\n\nCGSize statusBarSize = [UIApplication sharedApplication].statusBarFrame.size;\n\nThe statusBarFrame.size returned in iOS 8 is different from the size value returned in iOS 7\nstatusBarSize = (width=20, height=1024) - iOS 7.0 \nstatusBarSize = (width=1024, height=20) - iOS 8.0\n\nLooks like apple is taking into consideration the device orientation in iOS 8.0 when returning the statusBarFrame value.\n\nFix:\n\nSet a static value for the offset  as 20.0f\n\nor the following\n\nReplace \n\n```\n    BOOL isPortrait = UIInterfaceOrientationIsPortrait([[UIApplication sharedApplication] statusBarOrientation]);\n    CGSize statusBarSize = [UIApplication sharedApplication].statusBarFrame.size;\n    CGFloat offset = isPortrait ? statusBarSize.height : statusBarSize.width;\n    verticalOffset += offset;\n```\n\nwith \n\n```\n    CGSize statusBarSize = [UIApplication sharedApplication].statusBarFrame.size;\n\n    #if __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED >= 80000\n            verticalOffset += statusBarSize.height;\n            return;\n    #endif\n\n    BOOL isPortrait = UIInterfaceOrientationIsPortrait([[UIApplication sharedApplication] statusBarOrientation]);\n    CGFloat offset = isPortrait ? statusBarSize.height : statusBarSize.width;\n    verticalOffset += offset; \n```\n. KrauseFx,\n\nMade a mistake and used compile time directives instead of runtime check, sent a new pull request with the changes.\n. Used registerForRemoteNotifications as it was the first depreciation that i had to work around in the project that i'm working on when using iOS 8 SDK.\n. This has been fixed with the commit => 'aec1871'.\n. Hmm I guess this is already supported! \n\n```\ncallback:^{\n     NSLog(@\"Message Clicked\");\n}\n```\n. Same issue here!\n. Same problem here:\n- \"HexColor.h\" file not found\n- \"TSBlurView.h\" file not found\n\nAdding these missing file and the build is then OK.\n. ",

Awesome Pull Request imho :+1: \n. At the Moment we have no public place to discuss the direction of 1.0.\n\nThe last status we were send of is a overall revamp of the code from @dennisreimann but at the moment the time of dennis is very limited. Maybe we should start creating a roadmap for 1.0 to create a direction in were we are heading with 1.0, especially with the announce of swift.\n. At this moment there is no way to add 2 buttons.\n. Why should we remove the pod? The Pod itself is just working fine. In all of my projects that are working with HexColors i would have doubled my code base\u2026\n. Hand in a Pull request :)\n.

An example project would be great\n. use  `+ (void)setDefaultViewController:(UIViewController *)defaultViewController`\n. is this relevant for version 0.X?\n. i will look into this.\n. just looked into this, can't find the bug so far :/\n. Can you hand in a Example of this ?\n. can you hand in an example project for this?\n. You can set a default ViewController for the whole library. If you are using the showNotification methods the default ViewController will be used.\n. I'm going to tailor a new version today.\n. this should be easy to fix. \n\ni will look into this.\n. I'm working on this bug as soon i'm hitting the implementation of TSMessages in my current project. \n\nThe ETA is one week.\n. This would be awesome!\n. this should be fixed if we implement https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/pull/134\n. please hand in a screenshot / video / example project.\n. we need more informations here. What Version of Xcode do you use? Which iPhone Simulator? Did you try to clean the build? Did you try to clean the build folder? Did you try to delete derive data?\n. Cannot reproduce\n. So what's the real deal here? Are we going to implement this in the 0.X Versions and rebuild this from the scratch in the 1.X develop branch?\n. I just created a fix for this in https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/pull/140\n. It's available in the newest version via cocoapods\n. Fix this tomorrow,\n\nmaybe we should create some unit tests ;)\n\nOn 06.05.2014, at 21:52, Felix Krause notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Ups, sounds like there is a major bug in the latest version which causes crashes. @mRs- can you release a hotfix for that?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n.

Awesome Pull Request imho :+1: \n. At the Moment we have no public place to discuss the direction of 1.0.\n\nThe last status we were send of is a overall revamp of the code from @dennisreimann but at the moment the time of dennis is very limited. Maybe we should start creating a roadmap for 1.0 to create a direction in were we are heading with 1.0, especially with the announce of swift.\n. At this moment there is no way to add 2 buttons.\n. Why should we remove the pod? The Pod itself is just working fine. In all of my projects that are working with HexColors i would have doubled my code base\u2026\n. Hand in a Pull request :)\n. I think the main problem was in the Podfile of TSMessages, because of the missing version number `s.dependency 'HexColors', '~> 2.3.0'`\n\nI will hand in a merge request today with the suggestion from @xavierjurado \n. For the old versions we need to fix the podspec file. \n. I'm on it right now\n. Pull request handed in https://github.com/KrauseFx/TSMessages/pull/235\n. If you don't have the time to wait for it you can modify your podfile like this:\n\n```\npod 'TSMessages', :git => 'https://github.com/mRs-/TSMessages.git', :commit => 'f76924c34475d5d9bda23da45540e6cdb57a98bd'\n```\n. handed in a pull request for the cocoapods specs https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs/pull/13260\n. I hand in a Pull Request with the changes to the pod specs. But I need a new Tag on the current master to lint it properly\n. pull request created on cocoapods spec https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs/pull/13260\n. I think it's something related to the new CocoaPods version\n. I got the same issue and it was caused by `use_frameworks!` in my pod file for a obj-c, swift bridging hell. \n\nI used first https://github.com/CocoaPods/cocoapods-deintegrate to deintegrate the complete cocoapods integration and afterwards i run `pod install` again. \n. @KrauseFx maybe we should search a new repo master for this. Unfortunately I don't have the time for this right now :(\n. Took a first look, seems fine to me. Do you have a full history of your changes?\n. ",

Sorry, didn't have the time to progress yet and I'm afraid I won't be able to implement this anytime soon.\n. @mRs- I think this is a pragmatic approach to handle it. I had my fair share of trying to make this work and couldn't find a solution I was content with.\n\nWith the changes that are on the current develop branches, users would at least get access to the message view, so they could implement a blurring solution themselves if they need to.\n. @KrauseFx I just noticed, that `buttonTapped:` automatically calls `fadeMeOut` [at the end](https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/blob/master/TSMessages/Views/TSMessageView.m#L472) - this makes it unnecessary to take care of dismissing the notification programmatically but also leads to being less flexible with what one can do with the button, as it will always dismiss the view.\n\nDo you think it would make sense to change the behaviour here?\n. @KrauseFx In case you want to release another pre-1.0 version this pull request can be merged. For 1.0 I added the functionality with a separate commit (4220b1e)\n. > Messages are not dismissible by tapping the message (by default).

I've added the latest two commits on develop so that we can progress from there. This pull request won't need merging as its commits will be merged into master when we reach 1.0 on the develop branch and merge it from there.\n. Hey @pengwynn, might this pull request be worth an Atom invite? :)\n. Just to clarify: What exactly do you mean with \"new\" version?\n. @wolffan Can you post the custom design JSON leading to the error?\n. Well, I think you answered it yourself with your first sentence ;)\n. What's the code you are using to display the notification? In particular, which view controller are you passing in for the message to be displayed in?\n. Yes, that's because you are using the selectedViewController. Did you try using the rootViewController (your UITabBarController) instead?\n. There is also the option to define a delegate which is then asked for the offset the message should be displayed with. I don't know whether or not this works in the current release, but it does work on the develop branch. \n\nHowever, this would still animate the notification above the nav bar, but it would arrive below it when the animation is done. \n. @KrauseFx please check whether or not it has any implications when we would later try to integrate this into the develop branch\n. @mxcl in that case you'd have to wrap your table view controller in a uiviewcontroller which you'd than specify as the one displaying the notification. \n. I'm not sure if I understand this correctly, but something like that is able on the current develop branch with the concept of permanent messages. \n. @forgot yeah, I'll have a look. Sorry for not chiming in earlier, I'm just pretty busy right now. Thanks for your contribution!\n. Was it a conscious decision to load the sounds beforehand and not lazily when they are needed for the first time?\n\nI'm a little concerned about the five variables needed for storing the AVAudioPlayers - maybe there's a better way to store and handle the sound references.\n\nI think this should also be wired up with the custom design JSON.\n\n@KrauseFx @mRs- reading up on the conversation I think that adding delegation methods for events like `willDisplayNotification:` and `didDismissNotification:` might be a good way to provide APIs to hook into TSMessages, so they could implement things like playing sounds themselves. I don't want to cancel this pull request as I think playing sounds might be a good addition, but I'm a bit worried about the weight of the added code.\n. Awesome, I like this way more than the previous state - the delegation methods offer good hooks and the sound option is a really nice example of how the delegation can be used :+1: \n\nI haven't had the time to check this out in Xcode and go it through in detail, but in general I think this fits good into where we are going with 1.0, so what do you think @KrauseFx and @mRs- ?\n. I think there's a 1.0 milestone created by @KrauseFx where Felix listed all the issues that should be worked on before we declare it 1.0 - let's just open a 1.0 issue where we discuss further. \n. >  I think the behaviour has already changed\n\nYes, it's fixed with the current develop state.\n. you are welcome :+1: \n.

I had my fair share of trying to make this work and couldn't find a solution I was content with.\n\nWith the changes that are on the current develop branches, users would at least get access to the message view, so they could implement a blurring solution themselves if they need to.\n. @KrauseFx I just noticed, that `buttonTapped:` automatically calls `fadeMeOut` [at the end](https://github.com/toursprung/TSMessages/blob/master/TSMessages/Views/TSMessageView.m#L472) - this makes it unnecessary to take care of dismissing the notification programmatically but also leads to being less flexible with what one can do with the button, as it will always dismiss the view.\n\nDo you think it would make sense to change the behaviour here?\n. @KrauseFx In case you want to release another pre-1.0 version this pull request can be merged. For 1.0 I added the functionality with a separate commit (4220b1e)\n. > Messages are not dismissible by tapping the message (by default). [...]\n> Shouldn't userDimissEnabled be default?\n\nYes, I'll take care of this.\n\n> The Pull Request for Permanent messages is already in this one as well, right? (#112)\n\nYep.\n. I've added the latest two commits on develop so that we can progress from there. This pull request won't need merging as its commits will be merged into master when we reach 1.0 on the develop branch and merge it from there.\n. Hey @pengwynn, might this pull request be worth an Atom invite? :)\n. Just to clarify: What exactly do you mean with \"new\" version?\n. @wolffan Can you post the custom design JSON leading to the error?\n. Well, I think you answered it yourself with your first sentence ;)\n. What's the code you are using to display the notification? In particular, which view controller are you passing in for the message to be displayed in?\n. Yes, that's because you are using the selectedViewController. Did you try using the rootViewController (your UITabBarController) instead?\n. There is also the option to define a delegate which is then asked for the offset the message should be displayed with. I don't know whether or not this works in the current release, but it does work on the develop branch. \n\nHowever, this would still animate the notification above the nav bar, but it would arrive below it when the animation is done. \n. @KrauseFx please check whether or not it has any implications when we would later try to integrate this into the develop branch\n. @mxcl in that case you'd have to wrap your table view controller in a uiviewcontroller which you'd than specify as the one displaying the notification. \n. I'm not sure if I understand this correctly, but something like that is able on the current develop branch with the concept of permanent messages. \n. @forgot yeah, I'll have a look. Sorry for not chiming in earlier, I'm just pretty busy right now. Thanks for your contribution!\n. Was it a conscious decision to load the sounds beforehand and not lazily when they are needed for the first time?\n\nI'm a little concerned about the five variables needed for storing the AVAudioPlayers - maybe there's a better way to store and handle the sound references.\n\nI think this should also be wired up with the custom design JSON.\n\n@KrauseFx @mRs- reading up on the conversation I think that adding delegation methods for events like `willDisplayNotification:` and `didDismissNotification:` might be a good way to provide APIs to hook into TSMessages, so they could implement things like playing sounds themselves. I don't want to cancel this pull request as I think playing sounds might be a good addition, but I'm a bit worried about the weight of the added code.\n. Awesome, I like this way more than the previous state - the delegation methods offer good hooks and the sound option is a really nice example of how the delegation can be used :+1: \n\nI haven't had the time to check this out in Xcode and go it through in detail, but in general I think this fits good into where we are going with 1.0, so what do you think @KrauseFx and @mRs- ?\n. I think there's a 1.0 milestone created by @KrauseFx where Felix listed all the issues that should be worked on before we declare it 1.0 - let's just open a 1.0 issue where we discuss further. \n. ",

Do you want me to make a pull request or do you have the time to fix it? :)\n. ``` objective-c\nif (!image && [[current valueForKey:@\"imageName\"] length]) { ... }\n```\n\nshould do it :)\n. Made a pull :) (sorry, pretty new to this stuff)\n. ",

When i set `callback` for the message like below:\n\n``` Obj-C\n[TSMessage showNotificationInViewController:yourViewController\n                                              title:@\"title\"\n                                           subtitle:@\"subtitle\"\n                                              image:nil\n                                               type:TSMessageNotificationTypeSuccess\n                                           duration:TSMessageNotificationDurationAutomatic\n                                           callback:^{\n                                               // here do whatever u want after user tapped the banner\n                                           }\n                                        buttonTitle:nil\n                                     buttonCallback:nil\n                                         atPosition:TSMessageNotificationPositionTop\n                               canBeDismissedByUser:YES];\n```\n\nthe tap action that generated by `canBeDismissedByUser:YES` will be overrode by callback's (which means, it'll invoke `-handleTap` instead of `-fadeMeOut` when user tapped on message), that'll leads the notification banner cannot dismiss. Because `-handleTap` has not implement fade out action.\n\n``` Obj-C\nif (dismissingEnabled) {\n    UISwipeGestureRecognizer *gestureRec = [[UISwipeGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTarget:self\n                                                                                     action:@selector(fadeMeOut)];\n    [gestureRec setDirection:(self.messagePosition == TSMessageNotificationPositionTop ?\n                                          UISwipeGestureRecognizerDirectionUp :\n                                          UISwipeGestureRecognizerDirectionDown)];\n    [self addGestureRecognizer:gestureRec];\n\n    UITapGestureRecognizer *tapRec = [[UITapGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTarget:self\n                                                                             action:@selector(fadeMeOut)];\n    [self addGestureRecognizer:tapRec];\n}\n\nif (self.callback) {\n    UITapGestureRecognizer *tapGesture = [[UITapGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTarget:self action:@selector(handleTap:)];\n    tapGesture.delegate = self;\n    [self addGestureRecognizer:tapGesture];\n}\n```\n\nHere, just invoke the callback block, no action to fade out the banner.\n\n``` Obj-C\n- (void)handleTap:(UITapGestureRecognizer *)tapGesture\n{\n    if (tapGesture.state == UIGestureRecognizerStateRecognized)\n    {\n        if (self.callback)\n        {\n            self.callback();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n.
