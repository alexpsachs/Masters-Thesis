Some of these commits seems really interesting and I would like to add them.. I am not familiar enough with github to pick some of them, will try during the day...\n\nThank a lot for your help!\n. Hello Ptototik, \n\nthe reason I cannot develop myself is simply a new house and some family life.\nI would be glad to add your HoloEverywhere fork and improve the lib. I just need to know if I can add it manually, and how I can I give you the credits you deserve (a link to your profile in the edit comment?)\n\nOr maybe you plan to create a pull request?\n\nThank a lot.\n. Awesome, thank a lot Sergey.\n. \"This pull request cannot be automatically merged.\"\nI will try to find what's wrong saturday or sunday and merge your changes, thank a lot for your help!\n. I have some issues: Caused by: org.apache.maven.shared.release.ReleaseFailureException: Cannot perform release - the preparation step was stopped mid-way. Please re-run release:prepare to continue, or perform the release from an SCM tag.\n\nCan you contact me by email? \n. I worked on the push of 1.3.1 today, but had serious issues.\nI have to leave now and will try again tomorrow (9AM Belgian time)\n\nThank a lot to neoasket for his precious help\n. As the main contributor to the lib, you will never be forgotten ;-)\n\nI really hope these problems are not too serious and you will be able to get over it!\n\nOnce again, thanks a lot and good luck.\n. I think level 16 is necessary:\n\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#setImportantForAccessibility(int)\n. With such a describtion, it won't be easy to help :-p\n\nHave you followed all the steps described here: https://github.com/ChristopheVersieux/HoloEverywhere/blob/master/README.md\n\nand are you using API level 14+ (16 seems even better)?\n. I am currently struggling with Java/Maven errors and cannot update to maven.\n. Thank a lot to all of you.\nThis was a great adventure, my first in the open source, and it was great\nto see people talking and using this project.\n\nSergey, thank a lot for taking the project and making it alive when I was\ngoing to drop it!\n\nCheers!\n\nOn Tue, May 13, 2014 at 7:14 PM, Sergey Shatunov\nnotifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> Hey guys.\n> It's very sad, but as you can seen HoloEverywhere is reached for the end.\n> End of development, end of using.

To\nconfigure your app to use the material theme on devices running the Android\nL Developer Preview and an older theme on devices running earlier versions\nof Android:\n\nDefine a theme that inherits from an older theme (like Holo)\nin res/values/styles.xml.Define a theme with the same name that inherits\nfrom the material theme in res/values-v21/styles.xml.Set this theme as your\napp's theme in the manifest file.\n\n_Note:_ If you do not provide an alternative theme in this manner, your app\nwill not run on earlier versions of Android\n\nBy the way, I totaly agree : let's forget 2.x and focus on API 14\n#holoyolo\n On Jun 28, 2014 7:24 PM, \"Henrique Rocha\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Material is supposed to work in Android 4.0+ but without all those neat\n> shadow effects?

Some of these commits seems really interesting and I would like to add them.. I am not familiar enough with github to pick some of them, will try during the day...\n\nThank a lot for your help!\n. Hello Ptototik, \n\nthe reason I cannot develop myself is simply a new house and some family life.\nI would be glad to add your HoloEverywhere fork and improve the lib. I just need to know if I can add it manually, and how I can I give you the credits you deserve (a link to your profile in the edit comment?)\n\nOr maybe you plan to create a pull request?\n\nThank a lot.\n. Awesome, thank a lot Sergey.\n. \"This pull request cannot be automatically merged.\"\nI will try to find what's wrong saturday or sunday and merge your changes, thank a lot for your help!\n. I have some issues: Caused by: org.apache.maven.shared.release.ReleaseFailureException: Cannot perform release - the preparation step was stopped mid-way. Please re-run release:prepare to continue, or perform the release from an SCM tag.\n\nCan you contact me by email? \n. I worked on the push of 1.3.1 today, but had serious issues.\nI have to leave now and will try again tomorrow (9AM Belgian time)\n\nThank a lot to neoasket for his precious help\n. As the main contributor to the lib, you will never be forgotten ;-)\n\nI really hope these problems are not too serious and you will be able to get over it!\n\nOnce again, thanks a lot and good luck.\n. I think level 16 is necessary:\n\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#setImportantForAccessibility(int)\n. With such a describtion, it won't be easy to help :-p\n\nHave you followed all the steps described here: https://github.com/ChristopheVersieux/HoloEverywhere/blob/master/README.md\n\nand are you using API level 14+ (16 seems even better)?\n. I am currently struggling with Java/Maven errors and cannot update to maven.\n. Thank a lot to all of you.\nThis was a great adventure, my first in the open source, and it was great\nto see people talking and using this project.\n\nSergey, thank a lot for taking the project and making it alive when I was\ngoing to drop it!\n\nCheers!\n\nOn Tue, May 13, 2014 at 7:14 PM, Sergey Shatunov\nnotifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> Hey guys.\n> It's very sad, but as you can seen HoloEverywhere is reached for the end.\n> End of development, end of using.

I was just looking at this issue myself. Did you check the logs? I believe (at least in my case) that the `FontLoader` is throwing an error \"Error: native typeface cannot be made\" which I guess is quietly breaking the `EditText`. The styling of the `EditText` comes from the theme so, as long as your application/activity is from one of the HoloEverywhere themes the `EditText` will look right. The `EditTextHolo` and other \"Holo\" classes try to load the Roboto typeface in as the typeface. \n. The problem is 1.2.0 is the version on Maven repository, hence if you try to add the dependency through Maven repository you're stuck with that bug. Can the repository be updated?\n.

Thanks for mentioning the JDK @Prototik \n. @Prototik do you have to do anything else when you use 1.7? I'm getting a runtime issue now, that Android can't find my Application class.\n.

There's a list of them in my logs\n. ...I'm completely at a loss of words. I set my maven-compiler-plugin back to 1.6 and updated the plugin (and android-maven-plugin) to the lastest versions. Somehow something there resolved the issue, it seems. I have HoloEverywhere compiling and the app launches without crashing.\n. Well, @CodingCrow, that's what I've been trying to do here. Try installing Java 7 (like @Prototik uses). Have your Maven > Runner use 1.7 (I had to do this through JAVA_HOME environment variable, details above). Leave you maven-compiler-plugin set for 1.6 (? not sure why I have to do it this way, but didn't work any other way for me), that's source and target. Maybe, check to make sure you're using android-maven-plugin 3.4.0 and maven-compiler-plugin 2.5.1. That's the best I can do to explain it.\n. Thanks for explaining that @Prototik.\n. I think it's safe to say this is a closed issue. Maybe how to avoid this problem should be documented in the instructions (if it is, I'm sorry I didn't see it anywhere). I will close the issue.\n. @zuecho The HoloEverywhere `Activity` class is programmed to throw that error when the `Application` class doesn't extend `org.holoeverywhere.app.Application`  (probably because it depends on the code in that class being executed to work properly). This means you can either implement an application class that extends that class, **OR** you can simply follow the recommendation and add '`android:name=\"org.holoeverywhere.app.Application\"`' to your `<application>` tag in the AndroidManifest.xml. The problem is that the default Android framework `Application` doesn't execute the proper HoloEverywhere code to allow the HoloEverywhere `Activity` to work.\n\n@Prototik maybe the error should say \"or use a class that extends org.holoeverywhere.app.Application\".\n. @Prototik I sent this toward Robolectric, but are you saying that those things should be done in our code, or changed in Robolectric? I don't completely follow your sentences.\n. Has the project been added to a maven repository yet? It looks like the [sonatype issue](https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/OSSRH-3390?focusedCommentId=156734&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-156734) was resolved\n. I was just looking at this issue myself. Did you check the logs? I believe (at least in my case) that the `FontLoader` is throwing an error \"Error: native typeface cannot be made\" which I guess is quietly breaking the `EditText`. The styling of the `EditText` comes from the theme so, as long as your application/activity is from one of the HoloEverywhere themes the `EditText` will look right. The `EditTextHolo` and other \"Holo\" classes try to load the Roboto typeface in as the typeface. \n. The problem is 1.2.0 is the version on Maven repository, hence if you try to add the dependency through Maven repository you're stuck with that bug. Can the repository be updated?\n. I know you can manually do it, but they just finally added it to Maven\nrepository so I thought I would try to switch. Then unfortunately I get let\ndown my the bug. Side note: I also have ABS dependency, what exactly has to\nchange for 1.2.3? I saw a note that seemed to say that you couldn't use\nnormal ABS with 1.2.3, but then it seemed to say you could, but something\nabout tabs.\n\nOn Tue, Sep 18, 2012 at 10:12 AM, Sergey notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Responsibility for Maven repo - Neoasket and Christophe.

Or will the release be pushed soon?\n. I'm using SActivity aren't I? It only has one fragment.\n. Yeah I was following the demo when I wrote my class.

Hello, Christophe!\n\nOkay, i'm create pull request in the near future, I think, today.\n\nThe link to the profile ... No, because this is a open-source, then everyone gives as much as can.\n. Oh, i'm yet prepare commit.\nIn brief: you should define custom theme with inheritance of the desired HoloEverywhere themes and also specify a couple of attributes.\n. Christophe, close this issue.\n. Try to place the content of dialogue dimensions WrapContent.\nAnd HoloAlertDialogBuilder not removed.\n. Strangely, my AlertDialog compresses to the size of the content.\nCan you show a layout for the dialog?\n. https://github.com/ChristopheVersieux/HoloEverywhere/pull/54\n. Why did you remove the constructor DialogButtonBar(Context context, AttributeSet attrs, int defStyle)?\n. Yes, the constructor View(Context, AttributeSet, int) appeared only in 2.2 (or 2.1, can not remember).\nBut that is no reason to remove it from the library.\nCode will be compiled under the target sdk > 11 and run on a 1.6 normally.\n. dbca48a6ac92ba049881f7260529ebd5b609bf6f\n.

I'm compiled dev version :D\nI am reluctant to switch between branches.\nhttp://ubuntuone.com/5V92aLdQkHyS40ndhwiMFo\n\nBefore install uninstall the older version, signed by different keys.\n. With 1.2.4 project will has a small web-page... And there may well be put demo APK... Everything is possible.\n. I don't can repeat this bug. You may make a video?\n. Which version of Android used?\n. DatePicker is very strange.\nI'll rewrite it to maintain compatibility with the old API.\n. Is autoCompleteTextViewStyle commented - than it don't supported in this moment.\nWait for full support.\n. @svenkapudija A couple of hours appears in dev branch, respectively, will be at Stable 1.2.4\n. 1. You should use theme Holo.Theme.*** in designer.\n2. Designer can't display the layout for custom elements (at least, that the layout that is in the dev branch.)\n. We are talking about exactly the same?\nIf so, I was like you did not understand. Can you take screenshots?\n. ![Screen](http://ubuntuone.com/31HVeso6iPb4nfD4xCUTih)\nAndroid 2.1.\n. ![Screen](http://ubuntuone.com/74Fc8pNzMqYpU68QAjV50i)\n. ThemeManager resolve theme to Holo.Theme.Sherlock.Light.Fullscreen\n. Also, it's dev version. May be, this bug only in 1.2.3?\n. Well, bug not confirmed. Close.\n. @PatteSMO LinearLayout already inflate <LinearLayout> as com.WazaBe.HoloEverywhere.widget.LinearLayout\n. Okay, I supplement the readme in next version, many people have some questions to highlight it.\n. Duplicate #89\nYou may upload framework-res.apk from device?\n. Also framework.jar, please :)\n. Try this build: http://ubuntuone.com/5V92aLdQkHyS40ndhwiMFo\n. It's standart behavior of AlertDialog.\nYou may create android.app.AlertDialog and sure.\n. FT: you compile HE demo with standart abs, should use fork.\nLisr: duplicate #98, already fixed\n. Standart ABS - from Jake repo. You should use fork from Christophe repo. When will be release 4.2.0 ABS - we are don't need to fork more.\n. Duplicate #100, #98\n. Full stacktrace, please.\n. Then I want to congratulate you - you are the master. To date, the library has a bug that makes it impossible to create a menu in fragments.\nBug confirmed.\n. android.R.layout.simple_spinner_dropdown_item - CheckedTextView, use another layout.\n. It's will be custom impl. If you have good numberpickerpreference - you may send pull request, of course. But not fact, what it will be accepted:)\n. No.\nUse default preference package. And name then as NumberPickerPreference.\n. When NPP in AOSP will be created - we a port new NPP with save compat. Only standart preference package.\n. Already exists :) And you impl don't support summary and icon.\n. Well, if you think that my implementation is not enough opportunities - you can still finish it.\n\n> This is important to be able to call getNumberPicker from activity or fragment.\n\nViews from preferences should be handled only in themselves preference, otherwise it would be violation of simplicity and strange state of prefs in adapter.\n. @prom85 spinner mode in XML does not work?\nSo do not lie.\nYou may change style with override spinner mode for all spinners, or only one spinner in layout:\n\n```\n<style name=\"MySpinner\" parent=\"@style/Holo.Spinner\">\n  <item name=\"spinnerMode\">dialog</item>\n</style>\n```\n\n```\n<Spinner ...\nholo:spinnerMode=\"dialog\" />\n```\n. Perhaps you used android:spinnerMode, which Spinner of HE does not work.\n. Why?  And why in master branch?\n. (S)Activity/(S)ListActivity/(S)ExpandableListActivity/(S)PreferenceActivity a = ...;\nLog.v(\"TAG\", (a instanceof FragmentActivity) + \"\");\n\n> true\n\nWell, MapActivity... I will be think :)\n.

Try to call replace() with fragment manager...\nI... I don't know. I haven't pc in this moment.\n. Fixed in 1.3, without reflection :)\n. It's fixed in dev version.\n. See #603 bug in ABS tracker\n. See demo, bro:)\nYou should use holo: prefix instead android:\n. Of course, listPrefferedItemPaddingLeft and other attrs avaiable since 3.0. Use it without android package prefix.\n. Fixed in 1.3\n. ... What? Window layout inflater (just PhoneLayoutInflater from internal android package) cannot be cast to HoloEverywhere.LayoutInflater, never. Try getLayoutInflater().setFactory(this) before calling super.onCreate in activity.\n. Test it with new version\n. Use SActivity, man.\n. Yes, it's bug. I know.\n. @ElArZ already fixed in dev version\n. ![Screenshot](http://imgur.com/JDYIK.png)\n\nI don't will be support 3 party impl.\n. Work on Android 4.0?\n. > I don't will be support 3 party impl.\n. Update abs to 4.2\n. Okay, accepted.\nYou may print content of /data/data/package/shared_prefs/package***.xml?\n. In 1.2.3 all work?\n. M, 1.2.4, sorry.\ngit reset --hard HEAD^\nAnd downgrade abs to 4.1\n. Which version of sdk you use? 14+? \n. Use standart ABS from Jake repo.\n\nTo Christophe: delete abs fork, not need more.\n. You may temporary change SharedPreferencs impl on xml:\n\n```\n    Settings.setPreferenceMode(PreferenceMode.XML);\n```\n. You apply Holo.Theme* on activity?\n. So, print you settings.xml and full activity code.\n.

If you create new clone, pull not need, only checkout.\n. Try mvn clean\n. Use only one: PreferenceFragment with (S)Activity or SPreferenceActivity.\n. Ops, yes, i'm sorry. Well, print stacktrace. Demo use SActivity and SPreferenceFragment, everything okay.\n. Constructor PreferenceScreen(Context, AttributeSet) declared, Moreover, it is only one.\n. It's 1.3.2 bug, fixed in current dev version\n. Ctrl + Space - popup helper. Replace android.view.LayoutInflater on com.WazaBe.HoloEverywhere.LayoutInflater. \n. Your SPreferenceActivity don't use holo theme (in manifest or setTheme before super.onCreate).\n. You must use Holo.Theme.Sherlock\\* theme.\n. Since 1.4.1 available Activity.getSupportActionBarContext/getSupportActionBarInflater. Use it for right theme in actionbar widgets.\n. This fix will be available only in 1.4 release, please wait, it soon.\n. Because DialogFragment does not have reference to any context. So it's crashs. And it's better to use replace (FragmentTransaction)\n. For hide dialog invoke dismiss(), hide() is deprecated and already removed in dev version.\n. git submodule update --init\n. I have no idea, only the console, only hardcore :)\nJust clone ABS repo to contrib/ActionBarSherlock\n. Feature request accepted :) tommorow.\n. Or not tommorow... :)\nWell, you mean MapActivity/MapFragment from Google Api with Google Maps?\n. I am sorry for necrophilia, but this bug is somehow fixed itself :)\n. Use @style/Holo.Theme.Dialog\n. [styles.xml, line 355](https://github.com/ChristopheVersieux/HoloEverywhere/blob/master/library/res/values/styles.xml#L355)\n. Try dev version.\n.

[See demo](https://github.com/ChristopheVersieux/HoloEverywhere/blob/dev/demo/src/org/holoeverywhere/demo/fragments/MainFragment.java#L106)\n. prepareMenu applies only to the demo, it just sets the checkbox on the menu item.\n. Yes.\n. Are there any problems? No? And why it should non-work?\n. Package changed from com.WazaBe.HoloEverywhere to org.holoeverywhere. And SActivity not exists more.\n. Once again: NetBeans tries to compile classes from com.WazaBe.HoloEverywhere, and they're there! But in dev branch all classes moved in the package org.holoeverywhere. As you switch a branch? `git checkout dev` or otherwise?\n. Now carefully remove the mess that you've do, and download the source code again.\n. Yes.\n. Nothing is true. With OpenSource power - everything is permitted. ;)\n. What is that to you?\n![Screen 1](http://i.imgur.com/5mUEE.png)\n![Screen 2](http://i.imgur.com/YF6bi.png)\n. > Also, in the dev package you pushed this morning, don\u2019t forget to update the README when you merge with Master, now that your package name has changed and the Activities no longer have the \u201cS\u201d\n\nNot quite clear why this is.\nYes, for the next release, I will try to do help more informatianoy. And help take care of the update to the new version. I do not have to comment on any function that has just appeared in the dev branch.\n. ![Screen](http://i.imgur.com/3j6Gw.png)\nDialogFragment. What's wrong? Android 2.1.\n. No. Use simple Activity from org.holoeverywhere.app package.\n. Reopen,  last fix is very bad, need to rewrite.\n. It's bug in system ListView when list data updates in background window.\nWhen you click on Spinner - showing popup window with spinner items, activity window has flag focus = false.\n\nTemp workaround:\nOverride method onWindowFocusChanged in Activity:\n\n``` java\n    @Override\n    public void onWindowFocusChanged(boolean hasFocus) {\n        super.onWindowFocusChanged(hasFocus);\n        if (hasFocus) {\n            listView.onWindowFocusChanged(true);\n            listView.invalidate();\n            listView.invalidateViews();\n        }\n    }\n```\n. No, I don't  have workaround for this. \n. @minioreo \n\n> As a temporary workaround, setting: `Application.config().setDisableContextMenu(true);`\n\nI'm working on it.\n. ``` java\n    @Override\n    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n        addPreferencesFromResource(R.xml.preferences);\n        final ListPreference p = (ListPreference) findPreference(\"list\");\n        p.setOnPreferenceChangeListener(new OnPreferenceChangeListener() {\n            @Override\n            public boolean onPreferenceChange(Preference preference, Object newValue) {\n                p.setSummary(\"My new value: \" + newValue);\n                return true;\n            }\n        });\n    }\n```\n\nAfter first launch:\n![Screen](http://i.imgur.com/W0Eih.png)\nAfter select entry:\n![Screen](http://i.imgur.com/E5KKM.png)\nAfter select another entry:\n![Screen](http://i.imgur.com/E3uZY.png)\n. ThemeManager now has a docs and you can see using custom themes in demo.\n. Which JDK are you use for compiling? I'm compile on JDK 1.7.0_09, everything ok.\n. It's bug in 1.6 jdk. 1.7 compile correctly, but dalvik work only with 1.6 classes. Because target for maven-compiler-plugin should be 1.6, but compiler should be 1.7.\n. @noguess Update to latest master, run `mvn clean install` in resbuilder folder and try again.\nIf no - run maven with `-e` key for print stacktrace.\n. [_HoloActivity.java line 360](https://github.com/ChristopheVersieux/HoloEverywhere/blob/dev/library/src/android/support/v4/app/_HoloActivity.java#L360)\n. Full stacktrace, please.\n.

OptionsMenu don't replaced by fragment, it's added to general menu, inflated into activity or other fragments. \n. Code. Or test it with only ActionBarSherlock.\n.

I don't have device for reproduce this bug. If you can fix it - send pull request. \n. @soarcn\n ![Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/ZUQXc.png)  \nWhere?\n. @bkhall Update to latest version from dev and use R.layout.simple_list_item_***\n. @soarcn i'm push fix for dialog theme, but i don't find original source code, when while processing windowMinWidthMajor/Minor, because i did so, i thought the right. Test please.\n. @bkhall fixed.\n. @soarcn fixed via b5e25f4\n@bkhall change imports on android.widget.AdapterView\n. Mmm, in ArrayAdapter uses android.widget.TextView - if view cannot be cast to it - view is generally something not textual.\n. List Preference use select dialog single choice layout.  You may show full stacktrace of crash? \n. Rejected.\n1. Old package com.WazaBe.HoloEverywhere.\n2. A lot of old code.\n3. Full copy of Activity.\n. Internal? android.widget.SearchView?\n\n``` java\npublic class SearchView extends LinearLayout implements CollapsibleActionView {\n...\n```\n. #213\n. No,  by default it's not clickable. If you call setOnClickListener  - then clickable flag will be setted.\n. Yea, use next layout:\n\n``` xml\n<PreferenceScreen xmlns:holo=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto\" \n   xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\" >\n\n<EditTextPreference\n    android:capitalize=\"words\"\n    holo:defaultValue=\"@string/pref_default_username\"\n    android:inputType=\"textCapWords\"\n    holo:key=\"usernamePref\"\n    android:maxLines=\"1\"\n    android:selectAllOnFocus=\"true\"\n    android:singleLine=\"true\"\n    holo:title=\"@string/pref_title_username\" />\n\n</PreferenceScreen>\n\n```\n. Fixed via 15432a98\n. @4nd3250n switch to dev branch\n. Closed #215 via 6ef2f13cb\n. Where stack trace? \n. ```\njava.lang.RuntimeException: android.view.InflateException: Binary XML file line #17: Error inflating class fragment\nat com.dome.android.LocationFragment.onCreateView(LocationFragment.java:148)\n```\n\nSupport of nested fragments available only since 11 revision of support library. You are sure that you use latest version of this?\n\nIf true - try to add line \n\n``` java\ninflater.setFactory(getSupportActivity());\n```\n\nbefore inflating of fragment view.\n. Thanks, but ...\n- Update command already fixed in dev branch.\n- Styles.xml compile with maven module, it's no edit by humans.\n- I'm not see something bad in hardcoded api version.\n- Incorrect branch for pull request.\n. It's impossible.\n. DialogFragment.setDialogType with AlertDialog arg.\n. Current impl of slidingmenu will be replaced by impl special writed for HE.\n. Create dimens.xml in your project and add next lines:\n\n``` xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<resources>\n<dimen name=\"preference_item_padding_side\">0dp</dimen>\n<dimen name=\"preference_item_padding_inner\">0dp</dimen>\n</resources>\n```\n. Mmm... than you need to enable jarsigner plugin for library, demo, builder and translator.\n. Use android.R.id.text1 for text view id.\n. @drawable/list_selector_holo_dark or @drawable/list_selector_holo_light, as attr reference - ?attr/listSelector.\n. Oh. Try ?selectableItemBackground\n. Fade effect only on long click. try `android:longClickable=\"true\"`\n. Try to use @drawable/list_selector_background_transition_holo_dark\n. In Assignments Fragment you use ListView with adapter which created with null context reference or incorrect id. Show fragment code. \n. android.R.id.text1\n. ?\norg.holoeverywhere.app.Activity has getSupportActionBar(), setSupportProgress**\\* and other methods from ABS.\n. In HoloEverywhere don't exists FragmentActivity. org.holoeverywhere.app.Activity already has a fragment impl.\nYou extend activities from android.support.v4.app.FragmentActivity. Change to org.holoeverywhere.app.Activity.\n. Use holo: namespace. See demo.\n. Not all attributes have been created in 7 API.

Put into static code block of your Application object next code:\n\n``` java\nLayoutInflater.remapHard(\"Internal.RecycleListView\", org.holoeverywhere.internal.AlertController.RecycleListView.class);\n```\n\nOr just add rules to disable renaming of classes that extend a View.\n. @Appstervan \n`LayoutInflater.remapHard(\"Internal.RecycleListView\", org.holoeverywhere.internal.AlertController.RecycleListView.class.getName());` maybe?\n\nAnd 1.4.1 don't have this issue, you sure?\n. > BTW there's no R.style.Holo_Theme_Dark ?\n\nNo need to multiply entities.\nSimply Holo.Theme.\n.

But it OnSharedPreference_Change_Listener, if you don't modify value - why need call the listener?\n\nSorry for the late reply.\n. Hm. Yea, you right. But which implementation you use? XML or JSON? \n. But xml impl only wrap a native impl and don't modify logic of listeners. \n. In 1.3 by default was be JSON impl. Change to it and report. \n. See demo for need release: in your application object in static block code:\nApplication.config().setPreferenceImpl(PreferenceImpl.JSON) for 1.4.0-1.4.2.\n. Since 1.4.1 HoloEverywhere support only maven-android type for the projects (required m2e and m2e-android).\nYou can remove .classpath files from project and add projects into eclipse from file - new - android project from exists code.\n. Adapter view use getadapter for some needs. If getadapter will be unwrap adapter - then fact of wrap of adapter meanless. \n\nAbout issue: fastscroll fixed. \n. Fixed via da13ec5d\n. Update support library to r11. By default HoloEverywhere using r7, where onViewStateRestored not exists.\n. You use android.view.Window instead actionbarsherlock Window. And he.progressbar already extend native pb in latest version. \n. This class cast exception already fixed in last version, but not in 1.4.1. Please wait 1.4.2 release. \n. ![he-abs-progress-test](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/77690/a78bd1b6-6154-11e2-868b-a79a094aa714.png)\n\nFull code of activity:\n\n``` java\npackage org.heabsprogresstest;\n\nimport org.holoeverywhere.app.Activity;\n\nimport android.os.Bundle;\nimport android.view.View;\n\nimport com.actionbarsherlock.view.Window;\n\npublic class MainActivity extends Activity {\n    @Override\n    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n        requestWindowFeature(Window.FEATURE_INDETERMINATE_PROGRESS);\n        setContentView(new View(this)); // dummy view\n        setSupportProgressBarIndeterminate(true);\n        setSupportProgressBarIndeterminateVisibility(true);\n    }\n}\n```\n.

ExpandableListView was be added in 1.4.2. I don't want to notify about every sneeze at .widget package. Crash - found the cause (wrong class) - changed - works.\n. Maybe you should be use DialogFragment.show(FragmentManager) instead of custom work with fm? You add fragment view in container, it's mean less. \n.

You can use exists keystore, but you cannot skip 2 step. \n. 1) Any keystore.  \n2) Yea, right, full path with C:/... \n. Just run build via Eclipse. \n. All correct, but install API 16 platform. \n. Check on javac in PATH. Run `HoloEverywhere Build` again.\nFurther discussion is meaningless - it does not refer to HoloEverywhere. Try StackOverflow or other QA resource.\n.

I could use it if it will be good.\n. @kkocel Mmm... internal package? org.holoeverywhere.internal? Even if it is, then what? The fact that there is should not be used directly by developers.\n@uKL I do not know, but pretty soon. I'm busy right now, but @ChristopheVersieux  promised to return soon,\n. @kkocel Yea, maybe, but i don't see reason for any usage NOA or embedded copy from ABS package in any class of HoloEverywhere. Code was there by my mistake, I admit.\n. Done in 62d21ac6.\n. We will not add support for third-party or system dialogs, it's just not possible. You can get a View of the dialog and create HoloEverywhere.Dialog with the desired view.\n. `GooglePlayServicesUtil.getErrorDialog().getView()` ?\n. `GooglePlayServicesUtil.getErrorDialog().getWindow().getDecorView().findViewById(android.R.id.content)`\n. Import resbuilder from root folder.\n. File - import - exists project into workspace. \n. Try to restart eclipse and again execute steps from Maven wiki page. \n. Are you try to follow instructions on 'Maven' wiki page? \n. Add into your layout for fragment any TextView-like widget with id @id/internalEmpty.\n. Attach PreferenceFramework from addons folder.\n. For religious and political reasons. Well why? I wanted to do this :P\n\nJust do not all need PreferenceFramework, well, I did split from the core of library. \n.

Duplicate #296\n. Yes, I think a little clarification of the situation can not hurt.\n\n`DialogFragment.show(FragmentManager, String)` and `DialogFragment.show(FragmentTransaction, String)` is deprecated because there were problems at 2.1-2.3 on restore instance state when tag == null. New methods simply generate tag name from class name and it's hashcode. But this methods also suggest that each DialogFragment's based class at any time will not be more than one instance. If this bothers you - you can use the old methods, it will not be deleted ever. But I recommend to use new methods, just in case ;)\n.

About this:\n\n> The PreferenceCheckBox items are ignoring my custom orange checkbox images\n\nYou should create custom theme extends from Holo.PreferenceTheme and Holo.PreferenceTheme.Light and remap Preference themes on yours:\n\n``` xml\n<style name=\"CustomPreferenceTheme\" parent=\"Holo.PreferenceTheme\">\n  <item name=\"checkBoxPreferenceStyle\">@style/CustomPreferenceCheckBox</item>\n</style>\n<style name=\"CustomPreferenceTheme.Light\" parent=\"Holo.PreferenceTheme.Light\">\n  <item name=\"checkBoxPreferenceStyle\">@style/CustomPreferenceCheckBox</item>\n</style>\n```\n\nIn static code block of your `Application` class:\n\n``` java\nPreferenceInit.map(R.style.CustomPreferenceTheme, R.style.CustomPreferenceTheme_Light);\n```\n. Show code. \n. You are specify theme in manifest. When theme manager resolve activity theme and try to determine color scheme (dark/light/mixed), it's cannot resolve it. And it apply default PreferenceTheme - Dark.\nUse ThemeManager: \n\nYou can apply theme before onCreate:\n\n``` java\nsetTheme(ThemeManager.MIXED);\nsuper.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n```\n\nOr define default application theme in Application class:\n\n``` java\npublic class MyApplication extends org.holoeverywhere.app.Application {\n  static {\n    ThemeManager.setDefaultTheme(ThemeManager.MIXED);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nScreenshots:\n![holoeverywhere_bug299_dark](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/147815/05d718ac-74d8-11e2-946b-6b1be7e6d38d.png)\n![holoeverywhere_bug299_light](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/147816/05d96c4c-74d8-11e2-98c0-bbedb5223e92.png)\n![holoeverywhere_bug299_mixed](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/147817/06172dca-74d8-11e2-936f-8da81ccc6448.png)\n. Now you can specify theme in manifest - theme manager also checking theme attribute for determine color scheme. \n. [Bug project](https://github.com/ChristopheVersieux/HoloEverywhere/blob/bugs/Bug299/AndroidManifest.xml)\n. @demartino88 With latest version from master you can specify any theme from manifest or code, even without ThemeManager. You are all good checked?\n. @mattprecious PreferenceTheme should be extends Holo.PreferenceTheme. \n. Okay, I'm make resolving preference theme also by activity theme attribute, but only tomorrow and only if my girlfriend allow me to run ide :P \n. Reject. Holo.PreferenceTheme(.Light) internal theme. You don't should be apply this themes on application or activity.\n. Thanks!\n. See DemoActivity#onCreateConfig \n. PreferenceFramework?\nYou application should be extends org.holoeverywhere.app.Application and it's should be specified in AndroidManifest.xml in `<application>` tag with `android:name` attr. Or disable `Named preferences` property in org.holoeverywhere.HoloEverywhere class.\n. [Project for Bug #299](https://github.com/ChristopheVersieux/HoloEverywhere/tree/bugs/Bug299), using headers.\n. Please test fix above.\n. Fully fixed via e41bb86c\n. If I'm going to do something in this direction - that is not exactly to the 1.5 release and a special profit will not be there. Do you really want that?\n. No, I meant that I could not improve the performance of even 20% without complete redesign of the architecture PreferenceFramework.\n. For Preference classes which located in org.holoeverywhere.preference already enabled reusage of views in lists. Even if it doesn't help...\n. This issue will be closed while I don't want make it. \n. Mmm... What is it? Why i'm should rollback from 1.5 to 1.4.0?\n. Yea-yea, it's bug of HE. Please wait - I don't have a free time now for fix it. \n. You owe me :D\n![crouton-bug-screenshot](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/175775/5b2f8f42-7b58-11e2-9946-bd34c8e40121.png)\n. Resbuilder generate styles and translations for library and demo. Uses android sdk.\n\nOfficially supported IDE - Eclipse. I'm don't want to support other IDE, really. You can try StackOverflow or other QA resource, and if you want - can supplement pages in Wiki.\n. How is \"why\"? If it writes - believe me, it is so necessary. Or write this attribute in the manifest, or extend your own class from org.holoeverywhere.app.Application (like DemoApplication in demo project).\n. NPE on\n\n> com.dmu.waiter.home.Waiter_Home_Screen.onCreateView(Waiter_Home_Screen.java:73)\n\nAre you try retrive ListView in onCreateView? No, just call getListView().addHeaderView(*) before setListAdapter() or call getListView().setForceHeaderListAdapter(true) and you can add/delete any header/footer views in any time.\n. Create bug project in bugs branch. \n. It's not HoloEverywhere bug. See [1](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10109072/android-listview-edittext-focus-issues) [2](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11414170/edittext-focus-in-a-listview) [3](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9527067/android-edittext-in-listview-loses-focus-on-calling-notifydatachanged) [4](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2679948/focusable-edittext-inside-listview)\n. ``` java\ngetListView().setDescendantFocusability(ListView.FOCUS_AFTER_DESCENDANTS);\n```\n\nThis bug fixed by this line. But still it is not a HE bug.\n. Like #317, we are cannot override any method for all View hierarchy, use api compatible code. \n. View#setBackground was be created only in 16 api. Use setBackgroundDrawable instead. \n. Duplicate #310 \n\nPS.\n\n> I'm using SherlockFragment\n> SherlockDialogFragment\n\nMaybe are you try `org.holoeverywhere.app.Fragment` and `org.holoeverywhere.app.DialogFragment`? :)\n. In the morning I said that you must use Preference.context(Context) to get the styled context.\nI take it back ;)\n\nI created a bug project that creates two nodes: from xml and in code. Both are displayed correctly.\n\nAs a bonus: change the checkbox button to orange, images grabbed from http://android-holo-colors.com.\n![bug319-screenshot](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/191108/dc5f5df4-7f27-11e2-9b1b-807990ccf233.png)\nBy the way, a rather interesting situation: more styles is not necessary for drawables from android-holo-colors.com. It's use standard names of files and if you place this images into your res folder - it's override default blue drawables from HoloEverywhere library.\n. ![he-maven](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/195700/35b62d18-7ffc-11e2-8d4f-25856dfba54e.png)\n[Wiki](https://github.com/ChristopheVersieux/HoloEverywhere/wiki/Maven)\n. ``` java\n@Override\npublic LayoutInflater getLayoutInflater() {\n  return LayoutInflater.from(this);\n}\n```\n\nWhy and how Robolectric to override methods _HoloActivity? Contact the developer of Robolectric.  \nOr extend com.xtremelabs.robolectric.shadows.ShadowLayoutInflater$LayoutInflaterAppSingletonizer$MyLayoutInflater from org.holoeverywhere.LayoutInflater.\n. Officially backport from 4.1 jellybean: [link](http://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/ext/com.google.android/android/4.1.1_r1/android/widget/Switch.java#Switch.onMeasure%28int%2Cint%29). You can fix it and send pull request.\n. Use [DialogFragment#setCancelable(boolean)](https://github.com/ChristopheVersieux/HoloEverywhere/blob/master/library/src/org/holoeverywhere/app/DialogFragment.java#L284)\n. setCanceledOnTouchOutside work, but you set it's value before DialogFragment, which call setCancelable(true) that call setCanceledOnTouchOutside(true) also.\n. Support roboguice still not complete, although most things should be working already. Please test holoeverywhere + roboguice to anything more than a demo project higher.\n\nDo not forget to add next line to your activity class, bug in roboguice.\n\n```\n@Inject ContentViewListener ignored;\n```\n. Now fragments extend activity config, like attaching roboguice. And if you attach fragment to activity which has roboguice addon - fragment also will be have roboguice addon. Just for reference :)\n. Library version? Are you try to update to latest version from master branch?\n. You want slide only content or make menu static on large screen?\n\nIf first:\nLatest master version:\n\n``` java\nAddonSlidingMenuA addon = addon(AddonSlidingMenu.class);\naddon.setSlidingActionBarEnabled(false);\n```\n\nStable version (1.4.2):\n\n``` java\nAddonSlidingMenuA addon = requireAddon(AddonSlidingMenu.class).activity(this);\naddon.setSlidingActionBarEnabled(false);\n```\n\nIf second: you can see example of demo project and in [SlidingMenu](https://github.com/jfeinstein10/SlidingMenu) repo by @jfeinstein10.  \nTwo layouts: in layout/ and layout-w***dp/.

HoloEverywhere's LayoutInflater use HE widgets instead system.\n. That you have two activities in back stack. Are you call ThemeManager.restart\\* or any other method, which _can_ recreate activity?\n. Accepted. \n. Fixed...\n\nAt least now i don't can reproduce this bug.\n. Not HoloEverywhere bug.\n. Duplicate #358\n. Om, No. It's absolutely right java code.\n. For my application it's work. But i'm use FragmentStatePagerAdapter, but i don't think that it's important.\n. ldpi qvga 240x320 256mb ram 4.1 - ok.\nmdpi qvga 320x480 256mb ram 2.3 - ok.\n. Screenshot? \n. Yea, more screenshots with device/os description, please. \n. Thanks, bug accepted. \n. You have a incorrect build. Decompile classes.dex with dex2jar tool and try to find class org.holoeverywhere.demo.DemoApplication \n. Not HE related, try stackoverflow or other qa resource. \n. You don't should apply any Holo.PreferenceTheme on activity or application. It's internal theme. Again: check you build and manifest: you simply haven't this classes in apk. \n. Would not be SearchView inside ActionBar and be Holo styled?\n![Screenshot](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/320062/a0499b68-9912-11e2-9ab5-9320a4c22d61.png)\n. It is screenshot of bug application #359.\n. onSearchRequested(), startSearch(), triggerSearch() and other don't supported by HoloEverywhere or ActionBarSherlock. You should change a behavior for correct handling of search feature.\n\nRemove _any_ handling of your search menu item on `onOptionsItemSelected`, override onKeyUp and make like this:\n\n``` java\n    private MenuItem mSearchMenuItem;\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {\n        getSupportMenuInflater().inflate(R.menu.myMenu, menu);\n        mSearchMenuItem = menu.findItem(R.id.search);\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean onKeyUp(int keyCode, KeyEvent event) {\n        switch (keyCode) {\n            case KeyEvent.KEYCODE_SEARCH:\n                return mSearchMenuItem != null ? mSearchMenuItem.expandActionView() : false;\n            default:\n                return super.onKeyUp(keyCode, event);\n        }\n    }\n```\n.

Rewrited for detaching (not removing) fragments from parent fragment only if child fragment was be inflated via xml.\n. Duplicate #358\n. Yea, related with #380, but... Holo.Theme.Dialog have android:windowContentOverlay=@null...\n. Stop... I know cause. Fix will be tomorrow. \n. Run `mvn clean` into support-library. This install artifact com.google.android:support-v4:r12 into local maven repository. By default this target runs when you are try to rebuild all repository.\nm2e-android have a bug with overriding of dependencies, that you _should_ replace jar into abs/libs.\n. Attach preference framework from addons folder. \n. [Preferences addon](https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/tree/master/addons/preferences)\n[Facebook sdk for HE](https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/tree/addon-facebook)\n. 1) No, only changes in library.\n2) Any applications\n3) You should provide full copy of license, not only link.\n. Yea, also you can simply write \"HoloEverywhere\" and text of license below.\n. My fucked English is very bad, no?\nAre you /really/ want to read my docs?\n. HoloEverywhere use a maven, yea, but you can build your project with internal ide tools (adt, idea and other).\nAbout error: re-run maven with -e key and show me full stacktrace.\n. Basic JavaDoc placed [here](http://prototik.github.io/HoloEverywhere/docs/)\n. In ICS it was be radial gradient, yea, thanks.\n. No, this breaks view overriding and support of nested fragments. You can try - 99% of code in demo will be throw ClassCastException. \n. Fixed via fa59aa35d0\n. Now HoloEverywhere simply don't add any custom layout for selector. If you find different in native and backported behavior - tell me.\n. See #298\n.

This action will be reset on next maven build, you should modify basemap in library/resbuilder folder.\n2. This reference provide a holo-styled options menu on pre-HC. If you want - you /can/ create custom style and override android:itemBackground to null. But you can just override selectableItemBackground and recolor it, this works and for overflow popup, and for menu.\n. Temporary solution: use themes Holo.Theme.Dialog.FixedSize and Holo.Theme.Dialog.Light.FixedSize.\n. Fixed via 536e0abee82f8b463392319d7683d7350deced48\n. For using in application context for creating preferences you should... F*ck, why are you use application context?\n\nSo, well, you should apply Holo.Theme\\* on application context. If it no will work - wrap context by PreferenceInit.context(Context) method, like this:\n\n``` java\n    private static Context context = PreferenceInit.context(ApplicationSubclass.getApplicationContext_());\n```\n. You couldn't be use any layout_\\* attributes in root view via inflating view without parent (like View.inflate or LayoutInflater.inflate(R.layout.bla, null)).\nYou can use android:minHeight instead.\n. HoloEverywhere uses ActionBarSherlock for backporting a ActionBar on older systems. Just create styles for ABS.\n![asd](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/424305/93369922-ad84-11e2-8c90-932cfd60a5d8.png)\n. Can't reproduce.\n.

It's default behavior of FragmentActivity: [link](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/app/FragmentActivity.html#onRetainNonConfigurationInstance%28%29)\n. Just i think that ssh setuped de-facto on all machines. Use URI `git://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere.git`.\n. Disable proguard?\n. Try this option:\n`-libraryjars ~/android-sdk/platforms/android-16/android.jar`\n. Any 14+.\n. Also specify support-library jar: `-libraryjars ~/android-sdk/extras/android/support/v4/android-support-v4.jar`\nOr keep class: `-keep com.actionbarsherlock.widget.SuggestionsAdapter { *; }`\n. No, i didn't use ProGuard. Never.\n. Full stacktrace, please.\n. Fixed in `org.holoeverywhere:addon-roboguice:2.0`\n. Not HE bug.\nOfficially supported tab navigation - [TabSwipeActivity](https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/blob/master/library/src/org/holoeverywhere/app/TabSwipeActivity.java)/[TabSwipeFragment](https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/blob/master/library/src/org/holoeverywhere/app/TabSwipeFragment.java). If this bug still occur in this case - post it.  \n[Usage example](https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/blob/master/demo/src/org/holoeverywhere/demo/fragments/DemoTabsFragment.java)\n. I'm not recommend use fragments while content view not created.\nAs a id `android.R.id.content`.\n\nCreate a simple layout:\n\n``` xml\n<FrameLayout xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n  android:id=\"@+id/content\"\n  android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n  android:layout_height=\"match_parent\" />\n```\n\nAnd in fragment manager use `R.id.content` instead of `android.R.id.content`.\n. For `<intent>` and `<category>` now you should use holo: namespace, like for other nodes in layout.\n\nDemo builded via maven works fine, it's problems in your build environment.\n. Spinner at top and left has default behavior. For third spinner was called setDropDownWidth with display width param.\nWorks fine on 2.1, 2.3, 4.2.\n![screenshot from 2013-05-22 15 31 04](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/546929/fffb388c-c2b1-11e2-9313-07aa814c3eda.png)\n[Bug APK for testing](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BxcxDFWRyauQMEp4cXFFb2xXeWc/edit?usp=sharing)\n. 1.6.0 release\n![device-2013-05-23-171947](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/553577/261086d4-c38a-11e2-95d2-6c60db27aba4.png)\n. Place your font in res/raw folder.\nUse method `HoloFont.makeFont(**)` for creating a new instance of font object.\nAlso you can provide four styles of fonts (regular, bold, italic, bolditalic) like this:\n\n``` java\n            ROBOTO = makeFont(\n                    ROBOTO_REGULAR = makeFont(R.raw.roboto_regular),\n                    ROBOTO_BOLD = makeFont(R.raw.roboto_bold),\n                    ROBOTO_ITALIC = makeFont(R.raw.roboto_italic),\n                    ROBOTO_BOLD_ITALIC = makeFont(R.raw.roboto_bolditalic)\n                    );\n```\n\nAnd finally call `FontLoader.setDefaultFont(HoloFont)` and this font will be everywhere in application.\nThis code should be placed in static `Application` codeblock, of course.\n. Just do it, man. I have no time for it.\n. `<intent>` \u0438 `<extras>` \u0442\u0435\u043f\u0435\u0440\u044c \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u0443\u044e\u0442 holo: \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0441, \u043d\u0435 android:.\n.

Make sure that env variable ANDROID_HOME correctly setted and `androidSdkPath/platforms/android-16/data/res` folder exists.\n. Just android-maven-plugin 3.5.3 yet not compatible with /pure/ android sdk r22.\nFallback solution:\n\n``` sh\nln -s ${ANDROID_HOME}/build-tools/17.0.0/aapt ${ANDROID_HOME}/platform-tools\nln -s ${ANDROID_HOME}/build-tools/17.0.0/lib/dx.jar ${ANDROID_HOME}/tools/lib\n```\n.

Update library, Application.Config doesn't exists since 1.4.\n. /Which/ problems are you have? In latest snapshot demo using DrawerLayout - second screenshot on mainpage.\n. Update ABS/libs/android-support-v4.jar by HoloEverywhere/android-support-v4-r13.jar.\nThis step described in `import in ide` guide.\n. [TabSwipeFragment example](https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/blob/master/demo/src/org/holoeverywhere/demo/fragments/TabsFragment.java)\n\nYou don't should call setContentView() in onCreate(). Keep only onHandleTabs():\n\n``` java\npublic class TabSwipe extends TabSwipeActivity {\n  @Override\n  protected void onHandleTabs() {\n    addTab(\"Main\", MainFragment.class, new Bundle());\n    addTab(\"Result\", ResultFragment.class, null);\n    addTab(\"Player\", PlayerFragment.class, null);\n  }\n}\n\n```\n. Android bug.\nIn FragmentStatePagerAdapter#getItem you can manually load this class:\n\n``` java\nClass.forName(ProgressBar.SavedState.class.getName(), true, context.getClassLoader())\n```\n. Original code of ProgressBar use a package visibility.\nOne moment.\n. Fixed :D\n\nNo, it's /really/ android bug.\nAny application have a two classloaders:\n- System classloader. This classloader can load classes only from /system/framework folder. eg `android.*`.\n- Application classloader. This can load classes from application apk. Activities, services and all others classes from apk. This classloader extend system classloader, and if use it everywhere - all ok.  \n  FragmentManager doesn't set any classloader for savedinstance bundle, thats it's use system classloader, which simply don't know about apk anything.\n. But we are use support library - potential, crashes in restore instance state (activity/fragment) /can/ be fixed, but...\nHardly.\n. You can load class by name like this:\n\n``` java\nClass.forName(\"org.holoeverywhere.widget.ProgressBar$SavedState\", true, context.getClassLoader())\n```\n\nwithout moving in org.holoeverywhere.widget package.\n. Fixed in latest commit... Damn...\n. @LukaszJarka anyway it's android bug. And i cannot fix it /fully/ without patching of support library. I don't want.\n\nAlso i see you don't use `org.holoeverywhere.app.Fragment`. Fix placed in it.\n. @kkocel mm, sorry? You just should extends fragments from `org.holoeverywhere.app.Fragment` (or `ListFragment`, or something else). FragmentManager always is standard `FragmentManagerImpl`.\n. Well, i can /totally/ fix this issue, but anyway it's one bike more in this bike-collection-library :D\nOne moment.\n. Damn, i write workaround for this, but i don't want see this terrible code in library. I'll write to android devs mail list and provide patch for support library instead this.\n. Wow i'm already find a patch by Steve Lhomme, but it's in [review stage](https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/40760/) :(\n. ![screenshot from 2013-05-29 19 38 01](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/578375/7b11136e-c854-11e2-8687-5c7e01e854cf.png)\n![screenshot from 2013-05-29 19 37 39](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/578376/7b16d24a-c854-11e2-8a55-3ad77eb3a777.png)\n![screenshot from 2013-05-29 19 38 17](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/578377/7b355a12-c854-11e2-9bbe-ed0d66f7e37c.png)\n\nAutoCompleteTextView with all 3 themes (Dark, Light, Mixed) in demo application.\nIssue with /your/ code.\n.

Update library, i'm push commit with this feature 10 minutes ago.\n. No.\n. Noooo.\n. Because I said so.  \nFor this it is necessary to alter the existing flawed implementation of Dialog.  \nTwo options:\n- You do it yourself.\n- You pay me for it, because I need to eat, rest, resources for developing. My girl too.\n\nAlertDialog looks absolutely like Dialog, why not it?\n. Nowhere. HoloEverywhere now doesn't patch dialog layout.  \nFunny, yea?\n. In 0a04b97 i'm fully rewrite a FontLoader.\nNow you can use `android:fontFamily=\"roboto-light\"` (or `sans-serif-light`, or even simply `light`, or `thin`, or ...) and all other roboto fonts even on 2.1+. But for it you should just place a ttf file in `project/res/raw` folder\nIn this comment i attach `HoloEverywhere Resource Palette` project, see `res/layout/activity_main.xml` and `res/raw` folder.\n![device-2013-06-05-203304](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/611702/912db1e2-cddc-11e2-9c0e-b2ebe3b2c50a.png)  \n[Sources on GDrive](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BxcxDFWRyauQQnhOR1p4cVdYSm8/edit?usp=sharing)  \n[APK](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BxcxDFWRyauQSEtRRzNlTjJwZmM/edit?usp=sharing)\n.

Text appearance for textview in layout present is two attrs:\ntextAppearanceSliderItem and textAppearanceSliderItemInverse. You can customize text appearance like this:\n\n``` xml\n<style name=\"CustomSliderTheme\" parent=\"Holo.Internal.SliderTheme\">\n  <item name=\"textAppearanceSliderItem\">@style/CustomTextAppearanceSliderItem</item>\n  <item name=\"textAppearanceSliderItemInverse\">@style/CustomTextAppearanceSliderItem.Inverse</item>\n</style>\n<style name=\"CustomSliderTheme.Light\" parent=\"Holo.Internal.SliderTheme.Light\">\n  <item name=\"textAppearanceSliderItem\">@style/CustomTextAppearanceSliderItem.Light</item>\n  <item name=\"textAppearanceSliderItemInverse\">@style/CustomTextAppearanceSliderItem.Inverse.Light</item>\n</style>\n```\n\nApplication static codeblock:\n\n``` java\nSliderMenu.map(R.style.CustomSliderTheme, R.style.CustomSliderTheme_Light);\n```\n. @domenicop if you want the fonts - do it! But this library too big for using it as a font engine.\nYou can manually cut off FontLoader from library or find a more suitable solution for your targets.\n\nAnd you cannot build HoloEverywhere with ABS via gradle, no one version of this library never support gradle+abs build variation. Only maven+abs and gradle+abc, choose one please.\n. Only one thing i can help - open android.support.v4.app._HoloFragment and modify method `public final View onCreateView(android.view.LayoutInflater, ViewGroup, Bundle` like this:\n\n``` java\n    @Override\n    public final View onCreateView(android.view.LayoutInflater inflater,\n            ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        return onCreateView(getLayoutInflater(), decorView, savedInstanceState);\n    }\n```\n\nThis remove ContextMenuDecorView from all fragments. 3-4 levels of depth.\n\nNot HoloEverywhere problem.\n. I can only try to merge NoSaveStateFrameLayout and ContextMenuDecorView, but it's hardly.\n. Ma... Maybe. I keep this issue opened.\nJRE: -Xss100500Mb\nAndroid: Fuuuuck. Again multiplue parts of undocumented api with different level of operability.\nVMRuntime should work on pre gingerbread devices. But on Ginger VMRuntime is broken...\n. @tkiela for handling a context menu into fragments. Code for removing a CMDV from fragments see above.\nAlso you can remove WindowDecorView (ActivityDecorView into latest snapshot) from activity, then you lose support activity with dialog theme and again support of context menu.\n. Well...\nFucked Sony.\nNo, i like Sony. Really.\nBut sometimes Sony make Android /very/ customized.\n\nI have only Sony U20i with stock 2.1, CM6-7 (2.2-2.3) and CM10 (4.2) - i also cannot reproduce bug.\nTomorrow i make some debug apk, this tester should run it once. Maybe. Or not once.\n. @tomekziel Only if donations will enough for Xperia device :) I have only one Sony device with 2.3.7/4.1 - and i cannot reproduce this bug on this versions.\n. Which your relations with testdroid?  Or you just provide link to me?)\nOkay, i'll see this tommorow.\n. @tomekziel \nTestroid cannot provide me a full access to devices (with debug, adb, etc).\nOnly tests not enough for solving this issue.\n. Well, you can connect to my vpn network (from phone) and allow remote access. Then i can try to fix it.\n.

It's default behavior of Android.\n. > light background and black text\n\n? How do you get dark background and dark color?\n. This. Bug. Is. Happens. On. Latest. Demo?\n. No, for switch you should use [setOnCheckedChangeListener](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/CompoundButton.html#setOnCheckedChangeListener%28android.widget.CompoundButton.OnCheckedChangeListener%29)\n. Wow. Two rules:\n- DO NOT USE APPLICATION CONTEXT FOR DIALOGS! NEVER!\n- AlertDialog doesn't accept activity theme. You should provide something from Holo.Theme.Dialog.Alert[.Light] for it.\n. You should copy fonts from `demo/res/raw` folder into your project. Article about FontLoader will be after next release iteration.\n. But we are can fix it! :)\n. Or we are can not fix it... Hardly.\n. New FontLoader yet not have stable codebase. After next release i'm provide detailed wiki pages about some parts of library, including FontLoader.\n\n> you'll notice\n\nAm I? Where?  \nIf I'm provide all roboto fonts in basic packaging of library then all projects increase size of apk ~1.5 MiB, even if you don't use this fonts. I don't want.\n. ... Are you provide correctly gradle config for assembling in one command?\nWithout many actions for installing abs and some cool things...\n. Commands for installing abs from `dev` into local maven repo?\n. Maybe are you provide support of [maven gradle plugin](http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/maven_plugin.html) for abs first?\n\nbtw thx for `gradle build`, i find solution two fucked days why `gradle assemble` not work :)\n. First: rebase your commits under `holoeverywhere-1.6.1` tag.\nSecond: make a pull request into master branch, after fix all bad places i'll merge it into need branch.\n. Also you don't should delete `android-support-v4-r13.jar`\n. Recreate a pull request into gradle branch.\n. /into `gradle` branch/...\n. You are not rebase commit under 1.6.1 version. Run `git rebase holoeverywhere-1.6.1 --autosquash` and `git push origin gradle_pr -f` for correct pull request.\n. ![device-2013-07-05-133644](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/752159/42e3ff12-e535-11e2-95a7-53d25e6b0b37.png)\nAndroid 4.2.\nFor the mixed theme result is similar, because for edittext we're provide context with light theme, not dark or mixed.\n.

TWICE before reporting a issue.\n. Well, i think you should /fully/ uninstall and install again application.\nAre you use `EditTextPreference` before? It's stored string value into preferences.\nAlso you can just use other key instead `refreshInterval`.\n. ![screenshot from 2013-11-02 11 52 22](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/1458454/4137f3c6-4372-11e3-9f0b-e2c38c7388ad.png)\n\n_It's randomly fixed, but it's fixed._\n.

Well...\n. Application haven't rights for the directory /data/data/package. This means uid/gid of directory not equals to uid of application. Re-installing application is should help.\n. Well, @OS-Chris - thank you for saving my time :)\n. Only list view has this bug? And show you tabs implementation please. \n. Wow. No, i mean code which switch content between tabs. MainActivity or something similar.\n. Argh. Hardware/software limitations. Like @tomekziel said, you can disable some animations or other hard things.\n. Mmm.. this works with native switch?\n. Well, try to specify size by `<size>` node in shape\n. More details. Is it options menu? Overflow menu? Library version, os version, device info? \n. Are you not want to try 1.6.0 version? \n. Not library bug. Definitely. Vendor or your issue. Seriously. And i don't want to find way how to fix this crap.\n. You shouldn't use id and key together. Choose only one.\n. Well, in 1.6.2-SNAPSHOT i'm fully rewrite a FontLoader. Are you try to use latest `master` version?\n. I'm already :D Bugged commit: c76856abdc1d085ee6b21a370b317e369ec46d9b\n. I don't think that it's HE bug... Library just provide holo style for pre-ics, it even not backport RadioButton behavior or something else... \n. In DrawableCompat was added fallback mode, this issue should fixed.\n. Fixed.\n. Brais, merge it please. \n. Cannot reproduce. I think you call isEnabled before calling notifyDataSetChanged, but after removing some rows from adapter.\n. _Very outdated_\n\nI also don't know how i can reproduce it, and i can not find other similar stacktraces, close it.\n. HE doesn't provide a dialog layout on pre-HC. Maybe in next release...\n. Doesn't use `android.R.id.content` for something in HoloEverywhere.\nNow library not fully implement a content view behavior, but...\nFirst you should set any content view. You can even set null content view, but only once and only after super.onCreate and in onCreate method. And use `R.id.contentView` instead `android.R.id.content`\n. Sony sucks. After migrating on ABC this bug shouldn't be happens. But you can report to this issue again.\n. Default behavior of AlertDialog.\n. @gordonpro Yea, you right :D\n. Dupe #484\n. Wiki updated.\n. After migrating on ABC this bug shouldn't occur again.\n.

Make a pull request.\n. It's backport from Jelly Bean.\nIf you can provide fix without breaking of old code - do it.\n\nAlso you can just post your code in handler for processing in next ui tick.\n.

Maybe later.\n. @ericps Even if you fork project - you cannot just remove ABS and make it available on 1.6+: HoloEverywhere itself use 2.1+ features.\n. @ericps Why? Are you think that new ActionBar Compat less buggy?\nGive me one real reason.\n. @janoliver see `abc` branch\n. /partially/\n. Use `com.actionbarsherlock.view.Menu` instead `android.view.Menu` and `getSupportMenuInflater()` instead `getMenuInflater()`\n. \u0410\u0437\u0430\u0437\u0430, fixed.\n. \u041d\u0435\u0442 \u0430\u0439\u0434\u0438 \u0443 edittext, \u0441\u0430\u043c \u0444\u0440\u0430\u0433\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u044b\u0437\u043e\u0432 onrestoreinstancestate, \u0442.\u0435. \u043e\u043d \u043b\u0438\u0431\u043e \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u043c \u0444\u0440\u0430\u0433\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432, \u043b\u0438\u0431\u043e \u0435\u0449\u0435 \u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e, \u043d\u0435 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0431\u0430\u0433 \u0431\u0438\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0438.\n. Use a project properties explorer and remove wrong source row in `buildpath` tab.\n. Use a [SliderMenu.replaceFragment()](https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/blob/master/addons/slider/src/org/holoeverywhere/slider/SliderMenu.java#L683)\n. You shouldn't create a addon instance by himself.\n\n``` java\nAddonSliderA addon = getSupportActivity().addon(AddonSlider.class);\nSliderMenu menu = addon.obtainSliderMenu();\nmenu.replaceFragment(myFragment);\n```\n. Now - no, you haven't standard way for this, but you can simply provide custom item layout and behavior.\n. More details, please. Code. Or something else. Also checkout new version of library in `abc` branch and report (and reopen this issue) if something wrong.\n. In build file in `abc` branch version of library is `1.6.2-SNAPSHOT`, not 1.6.2. Are you use correct version?\n. I shall be free in two weeks. Prior to that, I would not have even the possibility to help.\n. Rejected. Library compiles normally via Android Studio. Maven/Eclipse build i'll fix.\n. You don't should include appcompat with latest master branch. It already contain built-in appcompat with some fixes\n. No, some places in appcompat should be changed for full integration with HE\n. ProGuard remove all runtime annotations from classes. Ask PG don't do it :)\n. /Make/ a pull request, man.\n. I suggest that you improve the code, if you have updated your branch to Fix - I have accepted it.\n. `abc` branch not have a support of maven build yet, only gradle.\n. HoloEverywhere start's migration on ABC, checkout new version of library in `abc` branch and report if issue stayed.\n. Well, merged via 384a40e. Also I improved appearance of this preference and fix bug when switch doesn't process parent groupadapter refreshing after creating of groupadapter for childs.\n\n![device-2013-09-08-114745](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/1102611/e172bb00-1839-11e3-816d-979468ef1d81.png)\n![device-2013-09-08-114757](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/1102613/e461d2b0-1839-11e3-86a6-0b5d5d8193da.png)\n![device-2013-09-08-114816](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/1102614/e646827e-1839-11e3-8f7f-907c15053007.png)\n. Wow, yeah, of course this should be child fragment manager. Could you make a pull request?\n. You are should sometimes update a library. Eg once in half-year.\n. Well, i recommend you setup a [email](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git) and [username](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-username-in-git) for git.\n. Argh, i said 'close #584'\n. Fixed, i think :) If you can reproduce this bug again with new version of library - report here and reopen this issue.\n. Fixed.\n. It's not HoloEverywhere's NumberPicker, my NP doesn't draw arrows. Maybe you use NP by @SimonVT? Anyway it's not library bug.\n. DatePickerFragment - port from aosp. You can hide title manually or find workaround on stackoverflow/android devs mail list.\n. Library is too old.\n. Yes\n. SliderAddon - overlay for DrawerLayout in support library. You can obtain a DrawerLayout instance by AddonSlider.getDrawerLayout() and customize it like you want.\n. You should use holo: namespace, like in demo.\n. Squash your commits first. \n. You are use a standart version of ABS with old support library. HoloEverywhere provide a patched ABS and support library for max integration in the project. You can obtain this version of ABS (with bundled support library) by executing `git submodule update --init` or [download](/Prototik/ActionBarSherlock) it manually.\n. Fixed.\n. Merged into `abc` branch. Thanks!\n. SlidingMenu addon deprecated. You can use it only with library with same version (1.4.2)\nAll other errors with build via maven i'll fix as soon as possible.\n\nLeave open until maven build is broken.\n. I recommend use a `Slider` addon, see a demo source code (DemoActivity)\n. Maven build is come back.\n. Dupe #546\n. Am... Thanks. If you'll find some errors - report to this issue please.\n. Use a `spinnerStyle` without android: prefix.\n.

If you have a issues with it: bug in your code or platform, but not in in library,\n. Yeah, ListView control selected state for childs, you don't should to do it manually. End of story.\n. Feature :)\n. Dupe #605\n. You can disable DrawerLayout by invoking `addonSlider().getDrawerLayout().setDrawerLockMode(DrawerLayout.LOCK_MODE_LOCKED_CLOSED)`.\nAnd reenable again with `DrawerLayout.LOCK_MODE_UNLOCKED`.\n. Merged into `abc` branch. Thanks!\n. Only gradle build is working now as though hint... Yes, HE 2.0 will be in aar format and (maybe) not in maven central.\n. Eclipse build is broken now. Wait for official support.\n. Yes, Eclipse and maven build is broken now. Wait an official support of it.\n. This font is using a Editor in suggestion popup window. Just copy `demo/res/raw/roboto_condensed.ttf` in your project and rebuild it.\n. If he.listview will extend he.adapterview - break a lot of code in app and system level API.

If you are want to remove padding in preference fragment - create it own and override onCreateView like you want.\n. How i can reproduce this bug? Code? Or something?\n.

Well, yeah, use a power of git! :)\nSomething like this: `git clone https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere.git --branch holoeverywhere-1.6.8`\nAnd next by the manual...\n. HoloEverywhere contains a built-in patched version of abc. AB-PTR use a standard abc version by google. You should exclude a abc in extra-abc module and build it under HoloEverywhere library.\n. \u0413\u0440\u0443\u0431\u043e \u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u044f, \u043d\u0430\u0434\u043e \u0441\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0439\u043a\u0443 extra-abc \u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0435\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0445 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043b\u0438\u0448\u044c HE. \n. You should exclude any 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7' dependencies from all libraries which you are used. Like this:\n\n```\ndependencies {\n  compile 'com.github.chrisbanes.actionbarpulltorefresh:extra-abc:+' {\n    exclude group: 'com.android.support', module: 'appcompat-v7'\n  }\n}\n```\n. HE 1.6.8 use a ABS. ABS build with support library v4 r7. Nested fragments was added only in r11. You can patch a ABS manually or switch to latest version of HE library which build under appcompat, not ABS.\n. See JakeWharton/ActionBarSherlock#828\n. Well, /all/ other libraries not supported with HoloEverywhere. All closed-source libraries. You can ask crashlytics team for special version of library with bindings on HE library. I cannot help you anyway.\n. In latest versions of android-gradle plugin it's fixed.\n. Fixed via d908724678\n. {set,get}TargetFragment is [part of support library v4](http://bit.ly/16i2kca).

Hm... Yeah, for each rotation (or any other configuration change, like locale switch) activity is recreate all fragments (not only in TabSwipeActivity/Fragment). For saving state fragments respond a FragmentStatePagerAdapter, for saving a current position in tabs - ABC. If you have some issues with it - probably you're doing something wrong.\n.

No, -snapshot postfix should to warn you.\n. Duplicate #636\n. onSearchRequested and other hooks of SearchManager isn't part of HoloEverywhere. You can use SearchView backport and proceed search manually. I cannot help you with it.\n. No, stop.\nIn original code when any error occurred (and allowFileReusage = true) invoking loadTypeface again with allowFileReusage = false. If allowFileReusage already is false or it's second call after allowFileReusage = true then just try to unpack typeface and load it. I don't see any recursion in this algorithm.\n. /Then/ backport patch to 1.6.8 and don't disturb me anymore. I cannot support more than one version of library.\n. Holoeverywhere's ChooserActivity works only with IntentCompat.createChooser, nothing other (including Intent.createChooser and share providers).\n. Make a issue project at issues dir at master branch.\nOn Oct 30, 2013 6:55 AM, \"mspapant\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> I am using the holoeverywhere number picker & dialog (to display the\n> number picker).

Clone a repo (google is your friend) and add activity to `issues` project in root dir of repo. This project already contains some issue's projects and you can do simply copy-paste existing activity and modify it.\n. Argh, again new release of studio...\n. **Use a power, Luke!**\nOf course you can click `Change to org.holoeverywhere.demo.widget.WidgetContainer` and be happy. But for what?\nI do not even remember the last time I opened GUI editor.\n\nIn demo layout i'll keep WidgetContainer and nothing other, end of topic,\n. Yeah, thanks.\n. @tomekziel It's right for 1.6.8, 2.0.0 have other behavior for context menu and all things (like anonymous callback) works nice.\n. Like #677, this occurs only in 1.6.8.\n. HoloEverywhere already uses ABC instead ABS, just try it!\n. For HE + ABS use v1.6.8. That's end.\n. Use StackOverflow for questions about library, issue tracker - bad place for it. btw SM and HE using some hack which do this libraries is imcompatible, but I don't see any reasons for using SM instead Slider addon of HE library.\n. You incorrectly update library, without version control, just replacing a files. Fully remove library and try again.\n. Oh, something is broken on github...\nTry to replace repo url to `https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/raw/repo/`\n. Also you don't need more build library from sources, you can use aar from repo.\n. ```\n[prok@prok-pc ~]$ curl -I https://raw.github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/repo/android/android/4.3_r2/android-4.3_r2.jar\nHTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden\n[prok@prok-pc ~]$ curl -I https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/raw/repo/android/android/4.3_r2/android-4.3_r2.jar\nHTTP/1.1 302 Found\n```\n\nStrange...\n. You can use [maven-android-sdk-deployer](https://github.com/mosabua/maven-android-sdk-deployer) and install this artifact  to local maven repo manually by invoking `mvn install -P 4.3`\n. Try latest master with simplified LL\n\n\u0410\u043b\u0441\u043e: Android \u043d\u0435 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442 Erlang :P\n. Create a issue project. I cannot reproduce bug.\n. Rejected\n. incrementProgressBy/incrementSecondaryProgress is final. Use `incrementProgress` instead.\n. ... What? Now aar and apklib just hasn't android:android in dependencies list. Just nowhere.\nOnly in sources pom's, but in repo placed generated poms without this dependency.\n. *2.1.0\n2.1.0 requires com.android.support:support-v4:18.0.3\n. [repo](https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/tree/repo/com/android/support/support-v4/18.0.3)\nAlso please do `git checkout v2.1.0` :)\n. Please do `gradle dependencies`/`gradle androidDependencies`. I just now tested 2.1.0 aar and it doesn't require android:android artifact.\n. Pushed 18.0.4 with correct pom.\n. Not, i cannot modify already pushed artifacts. But something like this:\n\n```\ndependencies {\n  compile 'com.android.support:support-v4:18.0.4@jar'\n  compile 'org.holoeverywhere:library:2.1.0@aar'\n}\n```\n\nshould works.\n. Use android namespace instead.\n. Yeah, for tablets using static layout, without DrawerLayout (like a last screenshot on main page).\nYou should check that drawer layout not null, or use a custom layout with drawerlayout for any dimensions,\n. For HE 2.1 required support-v4 18.0.4. You can grab it [here](https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/blob/repo/com/android/support/support-v4/18.0.4/support-v4-18.0.4.jar) and replace all version of support library (in `libs` folder) by this version.\n. @nono240 Yeah, i know, sorry. (valid only for eclipse/ant build)\n. As you said it's bug of support lib v4 r18, after official migrating on r19 this issue will gone.\n. `latest stable demo` - downloaded from main page of the repo?\n. It's December 2013 version, in latest master branch this bug should be fixed. Please build a demo application from source code.\n. ![device-2013-12-18-224348](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/1774023/f08f6f62-67f2-11e3-8b2b-3d69d993e5a9.png)\n. With HoloEverywhere's support-library-v4 you should use only android namespace in menu xml (and for nodes showAsAction/actionViewClass/actionProviderClass/actionLayout too only android namespace). It will work on 2.1.\n. @4nd3250n some kind of magic. All new properties (included 5.x, 6.x specific) could be obtained on older version, but anyway some code should process this entries. HoloEverywhere processing some entires (like showAsAction, actionViewClass, /etc) and build proper menu in this case.\n. For appcompat you should use meta-data tag:\n\n``` xml\n<activity ... >\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<meta-data android:name=\"android.support.UI_OPTIONS\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0android:value=\"splitActionBarWhenNarrow\" />\n</activity>\n```\n\nYou should have both android:uiOptions and meta-data for supporting all platforms.\n. Which android-gradle version is used? With 0.6.3 and aar i haven't any issues.\n. Any standard way for setting-up shadow for DrawerLayout:\n\n``` java\nDrawerLayout drawerLayout = addonSlider.getDrawerLayout();\nif(drawerLayout != null) {\n  drawerLayout.setDrawerShadow(R.drawable.my_shadow, Gravity.LEFT)\n}\n```\n\n(so you should create a custom shadow drawable)\n. You can override `@dimen/menu_width` over project level.\nCreate a `project/res/values/dimes.xml` (or append to exists):\n\n``` xml\n  <dimen name=\"menu_width\">200dp</dimen>\n```\n\nAlso you can may need to override default menu width with modifiers `-land` and `-w720dp`\n. How to you attach PreferenceFramework? Did you setup an order/export properties? More info please.\n. Export settings?\n. I just now run eclipse and i found library dependencies only in `libraries` tab. In order & export tab you should have only two checked entries: Android Dependencies (which should contains your project's dependencies) and Android Private Libraries.\nPlease check out you project structure, try to create a new project or send this project on my email.\n![screenshot from 2013-12-02 21 35 39](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/1654871/bba105a2-5b56-11e3-9439-e82066e4b469.png)\n![screenshot from 2013-12-02 21 35 42](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/1654872/bba8c922-5b56-11e3-9c2d-8beb8b07259b.png)\n. Of course it have sense which context is used. Without HoloEverywhere's theme widgets cannot be initialized.\n. No, old-styled dialog was removed in 2.0.\n. Dupe #481\nPre-HC devices have a very small stack size, not enough for too many view. You can simplify layouts or do something other which decrease a stack usage.\n. 0xffffffff = -1. Make sure that you have valid references in style/code.\n. No, it's not broken. It will be dialogfragment and I wouldn't provide a pure-dialog variation.\n. It is `a known bug` of ICS. We cannot modify native (ICS+) behavior because... because it is native O_o\nOf course, we can force use of custom implementation of ActionBar, but it out of this library.\n. invalidateOptionsMenu() -> supportInvalidateOptionsMenu()\n\n``` java\nMenuItemCompat.setShowAsAction(menu.add(R.string.robo), MenuItem.SHOW_AS_ACTION_IF_ROOM)\n```\n\nIt's basic of support-v4 / appcompat-v7. Please read official android docs before reporting.\n. Works nicely:\n![device-2013-12-14-122809](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/1747803/5b847fd4-6478-11e3-8f2c-a60ff99907ec.png)![device-2013-12-14-122815](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/1747806/5c163366-6478-11e3-8fcc-a398843d2503.png)\n. Check your build environment. In latest support-v4 19.0.1 (and in all 18.0.*) this class exists and works as expected.\n. ProGuard problem?\n. Make sure that you use a support-v4 19.0.1. If you use gradle - please switch to HoloEverywhere Plugin instead of  raw handling. If maven - add holo repository to your pom.\n. [Wiki](https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/wiki/Gradle)\n. Oops, addons feature seems to broken...\n. You can use this syntax for workaround:\n\n```\nholoeverywhere {\n  addons {\n    'preferences'\n  }\n}\n```\n. Show you `build.gradle`\n. This viewpager indicator create a textview from code (and use android.widget.TextView), we can override only widgets in xml-layout (`<TextView>` tag). Use android.widget.TextView in imports or patch this library for using a holoeverywhere's widgets.\n. Great. What a f*cking shit is broken now?...\n. @josear Demo from [here](http://192.241.191.41/demo-latest.apk) also doesn't work?\n. Hey guys, are you can test [this build](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxcxDFWRyauQcDBkNjh1b25XbVU/edit?usp=sharing) of support-v4?\n. Now i'm a noob in the android development. Really.\n. Of course we can come back to v18, but it's not solution.\nGuys, can i ask for help? Please reboot your phone, install problem application and run it, after crash dialog please send me **full** logcat of phone. You can save full log by invoking something similar:\n`adb logcat > my_log.txt`\n. You should apply holoeverywhere plugin before android plugin. eg:\n\n```\napply plugin: 'holoeverywhere'\napply plugin: 'android'\napply plugin: 'crashlytics'\n```\n\nI'll add warn message to plugin about it.\n. Yeah, sorry, plugin is still in early alpha access, please use this syntax:\n\n```\nholoeverywhere {\n    addons {\n        create 'preferences'\n    }\n}\n```\n\nI'll fix it in next release of plugin.\n. I release plugin 0.2.4 just now, please wait for maven central sync (you can check sync state on [this](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.holoeverywhere%22%20AND%20a%3A%22plugin%22) page) and update your plugin `./gradlew(.bat) clean build --refresh-dependencies`\n. It's WIP,  you right, support for subitems will added later.\n. SupportContextMenu will exists, if you cannot use patched versions of libraries - it's not problem of this library.\n. Read external storage? Great. Just great.\n. You can use a dialog and any activity theme without actionbar (eg Holo.Theme.Light.NoActionBar).\n. See a [comment](https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/commit/a4b852202c6375d0170d6d3988c21cea6b49da2c#commitcomment-4975540). btw for tabs you can use a TabSwipeActivity with proper tab handling.\n. Wh, i plane to use a holoeverywhere plugin for deployment/packaging this (and other btw) library. I'll port current gradle config to plugin in short time.\n. You can provide tag for fragments like this:\n`sliderMenu.add(\"tab2\", Fragment2.class, SliderMenu.GREEN).setTag(\"mynavigation-2\");`\nAlso you can get current page number by `sliderMenu.getCurrentPage()`.\nYou have no way for obtaining current fragment directly, but you can combine this two methods and find fragment via fragment manager: `getSupportFragmentManager().findFragmentByTag(\"mynavigation-\" + sliderMenu.getCurrentPage())`\n. Please test this feature in latest master branch.\n. you don't use holoeverywhere's layoutinflater, which handle all widget overrides, including override switch - org.holoeverywhere.widget.switch. please use layoutinflater passed to oncreateview method.\n. It's limitation of support library. I can provide patch for this issue if you want.\n. Into HoloEverywhere's repo pushed artifact support-v4:19.0.3 (which based on Google's 19.0.1), please switch to this version in our build script.\n. I did send a [pull request](/jeromevdl/android-holo-colors/pull/77) which add holoeverywhere support to android-holo-colors.\nPlease wait for merging it into base repo and next release of android-holo-colors.\n. TabSwipeActivity should correctly process all config changes (including rotation). Make sure that you have no this bug? Could you repeat it with latest version or find a similar in issues project?\n. only  if it support ABC, that no.\n. It's not holoeverywhere bug, inherited behavior of pure android.\n\nNothing checks for selection changed over invalidates datasetobserver,\nBTW datasetobserver doesn't know about 'deletion' of items. He can only notify adapterview about items modification. Definitely you should delete rows via helper method which will be also uncheck needed items.\n. > ```\n>     compile files ('libs/support-v4-19.0.1.jar')\n> ```\n\nGradle doesn't know that this file - artifact com.android.support:support-v4, which provided by GMS as dependency. libs folder provided only for eclipse/ant build, not maven or gradle.\nPlease use a maven dependency notations everywhere.\n. Yes. For handling artifact support-v4 you should also attach holoeverywhere's repo. [Or just use a gradle plugin](/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/wiki/Gradle).\n. Hm, yeah, ABC in current master branch is 18.0.0.\n(btw it's a strange fix, on api > 13 this bug still present)\n. Duplicate #702.\nUse `android:showAsAction`\n. First you should enable snapshot repository:\n\n```\nholoeverywhere {\n  repository {\n    snapshot 'yes'\n  }\n  library {\n    version '2.1.1-SNAPSHOT'\n  }\n}\n```\n\nPlease describe here if it works.\n. mmm, yeah, you should also modify support version:\n\n```\nholoeverywhere {\n  ...\n  supportV4 {\n    version = '19.0.3'\n  }\n}\n```\n. In your buildscript above both repositories will attached to project.\nBut first repo doesn't have any snapshot artifacts, then if you force specify snapshot version of library will be using version from second repo.\nbtw gradle throw an exception if any unresolved dependency found, I sure that correct version of libraries using.\nYou can invoke `gradlew androidDependencies dependencies` and post output?\n. Shit. I forget `=`.\nI can success use a snapshot version for building with this config:\n\n```\nrepositories {\n     maven { url 'http://192.241.191.41/snapshot' }\n}\n\nholoeverywhere {\n  repository {\n    // Will fixed in 0.2.8 release\n    // snapshot 'yes'\n  }\n  supportV4 {\n    version = '19.0.3'\n  }\n  library {\n    version = '2.1.1-SNAPSHOT'\n  }\n  addons {\n    slider\n    preferences\n  }\n}\n```\n\nMy dependency tree looks like this:\n\n```\n:androidDependencies\ndebug\n+--- org.holoeverywhere:library:2.1.1-SNAPSHOT\n+--- org.holoeverywhere:addon-preferences:2.1.1-SNAPSHOT\n\\--- org.holoeverywhere:addon-slider:2.1.1-SNAPSHOT\n\ndebugTest\nNo dependencies\n\nrelease\n+--- org.holoeverywhere:library:2.1.1-SNAPSHOT\n+--- org.holoeverywhere:addon-preferences:2.1.1-SNAPSHOT\n\\--- org.holoeverywhere:addon-slider:2.1.1-SNAPSHOT\n```\n. btw with 0.2.8 you can safely remove custom maven repo notation and even not use a `snapshot 'yes'` option - snapshot repo active by default.\n. I did change some behavior and hadn't update wiki yet, sorry.\nReplace this:\n\n```\napply plugin: 'holoeverywhere'\napply plugin: 'android'\n```\n\nby this:\n\n```\napply plugin: 'holoeverywhere'\napply plugin: 'holoeverywhere-app'\n```\n. @8Duke8 as one more way: exclude appcompat library from your build lifecycle, HE already contains built-in appcompat variation.\n. In Plugin 0.2.10 (will available in maven central for couple hours) like this:\n\n```\nholoeverywhere {\n  signing.key 'myUniqueName'\n  // or split for build variants:\n  // signing {\n  //   release.key 'releaseName'\n  //   debug.key 'debugName'\n  // }\n}\n```\n\nThen put in ~/.gradle/gradle.properties (on Windows - C:\\Users\\<username>\\.gradle\\gradle.properties:\n\n```\nmyUniqueNameStoreFile=/full/path/to/keystore\nmyUniqueNameStorePassword=Password\nmyUniqueNameKeyAlias=Alias\nmyUniqueNameKeyPassword=Password\n```\n\nAlso you can provide this values directly in .gradle file:\n\n```\nholoeverywhere {\n  signing {\n    debug {\n      storeFile = ...\n      storePassword = ...\n      keyAlias = ...\n      keyPassword = ...\n    }\n    release {\n      ...\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n. Good news guys: you can use normal repositories:\nhttp://192.241.191.41/repo/\nhttp://192.241.191.41/snapshot/\n. Include _both_ repos for snapshot versions and _only first_ for release versions\n. Well, you can support server by donations :D Distribution of files - hard work :)\n. Artifact `android:android:4.3_r2` has been deployed to main repo.\n\n_btw holoeverywhere plugin include both repos by default_\n. Fixed with 0.2.16 release.\n.

No. Just you should use context with holoeverywhere's theme.\n. It's logical - you using appcompat theme, not holoeverywhere theme.\n. Then Robolectric does set theme for activity. HoloEverywhere's runtime do it only if no other theme was specified, eg you have only basic activity declaration in manifest (without theme attribute).\n\nI don't know exactly, how robolectric runs tests (i don't know even target platform for running, sorry), but it seems like robolectric's issue. \n. Did you try call supportRequestWindowFeature? And you should call it before super.onCreate, as I remember.\n. If you can find a way for doing it with DrawerLayout - then you implement this feature. If you can provide patches for this for support library - you are good guy and I'll merge it with pleasure.\n. Duplicate #704.\n. ```\nfinal Context context = this;\nint titleId = context.getResources().getIdentifier(\"action_bar_title\", \"id\", context.getPackageName());\n```\n\nAll library resources packed into application scope, so you should find resources in your application package.\n. It's feature \u00a9 someone\n\nYou can provide custom background for view with state_activated selector if you want, but currently library doesn't make it for you. End of story.\n. It's very strange - have a viewpager inside scrollview.\nHoloEverywhere hasn't modify touch behavior (only in viewpager with property swipeEnabled = false modified, but it's not related with this issue).\n\nTry to change a UX/UI of your application, I cannot help you more.\n. Bug confirmed.\n![screenshot from 2014-02-24 20 26 19](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/2245332/08bb5b32-9d4f-11e3-98e2-bc3ec69ec6f3.png)\n. O_o.\nDialogTitle extends org.holoeverywhere.widget.TextView exactly.\nWhich version of library you are using?\n. Yep, many thanks for additional info.\n. At least 70%... I'll try to finish impl in couple days.\n. I'm a lazy bastardo.\n![screenshot from 2014-03-03 16 08 41](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/2307486/2cb2ef26-a2ab-11e3-8293-51a75c7a8e83.png)\n\nBut I'll write it! :)\n. When I said basic - I mean really _basic_... I have not enough time for make it quickly, sorry.\n![screenshot from 2014-03-18 20 01 19](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/2447287/1123025a-ae95-11e3-8e94-e492abb79334.png)\n. @Alexwijn yep, listview's id should be `@+id/slider_menu`, not `@android:id/list`\n. ... oh shit. Of course, I forgot about subitems :-/\nTwo ways:\n- Replace ListView with ViewStubHolo (addon automatically replace it with needed view) (but then you lose support of layout attrs) (but you can avoid this by using FrameLayout)\n- Replace ListView with ExpandableListView\n. Which errors are present? Concretize please.\n\nAnd no, no one have a _complete tutorial_ by migrating.\n. > getApplicationContext()\n\nUse activity's context instead.\n. You forgot to include `nineoldandroids` library to your final apk file.\n. HoloEverywhere doesn't provide a DatePicker anymore. But this means that native version of this widget will be using. But native DatePicker using a NumberPicker, which is still provided by library. Dilemma.\n\nSo you should use a native layout inflater (which will not override a widgets) for inflating a datepicker. Something like this:\nmain.xml:\n\n``` xml\n<LinearLayout\n  xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n  android:id=\"@+id/delete_diary_layout\"\n  android:layout_height=\"fill_parent\" \n  android:minWidth=\"200dp\"\n  android:layout_width=\"fill_parent\" android:orientation=\"vertical\">\n    <FrameLayout\n        android:id=\"@+id/date_picker_panel\"\n        android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"\n        android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\" />\n</LinearLayout>\n```\n\nmain_datepicker.xml:\n\n``` xml\n<DatePicker\n    xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n    android:id=\"@+id/date_picker\"\n    android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"\n    android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\" />\n```\n\nIn your activity:\n\n``` java\n@Override\npublic void onCreate(Bundle savedState) {\n  super.onCreate(savedState);\n  setContentView(R.layout.main);\n  android.view.LayoutInfalter nativeInflater = (android.view.LayoutInfalter) superGetSystemService(Context.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE);\n  nativeInflater.inflate(R.layout.main_datepicker, (FrameLayout) findViewById(date_picker_panel), true);\n}\n```\n. _I'd started coming back a pickers in library as module, but @BraisGabin provide a cool solution_\n. not in /my/ project, in /your/ project.\n. Please read basic guides for support library before asking.\n\n``` java\nFragmentManager fm = activity.getSupportFragmentManager();\nFragmentTransaction ft = fm.beginTransaction();\nft.add(R.id.content, new MyFragment());\nft.commit();\n```\n. For ListView and GridView using android.widget.AdapterView.OnItemClickListener for backward compatibility.\n. So, make difference: \nListView/GridView uses android.widget.AdapterView.\nSpinner uses org.holoeverywhere.widget.AdapterView, which are incompatible with native version.\n\nLeave out a holoeverywhere's imports, but for ListView use this snippet:\n\n``` java\nlistview.setOnItemClickListener(new android.widget.AdapterView.OnItemClickListener() {\n  public void onItemClick(android.widget.AdapterView<?> adapterView, View view, int position, long id) {\n    ...\n  }\n});\n```\n. Mmm... If I understand you right...\nAs usual. As with any other library. Do you use some other 3rd party libraries with your IDE?\n. Which explanations you are need? I just now tried execute steps on `Gradle` page and build some application - that's work. If you need a manual for usage this library - sorry, I have no it :-/ But you can always see a demo implementation and make similarly in your app.\n. How you include library to your project?\n. Fuck, library working everywhere! Even on Android Wear (with broken skin in round variation, i know).\n![screenshot from 2014-04-05 16 01 33](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1416030/2622239/11d93756-bc9a-11e3-8536-654b4e75d59e.png)\nI even not too lazy for searching my first android phone (se u20i, 4.1.2, ldpi, 2010 year motherfucker!):\n![2014-04-05-160900](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1416030/2622241/604c90f4-bc9a-11e3-9a60-774387d53d64.jpg)\n![2014-04-05-160946](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1416030/2622242/604e2874-bc9a-11e3-888c-3b6b23d4bb5d.jpg)\n![device-2014-04-05-161050](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1416030/2622243/70f4f3ec-bc9a-11e3-8cea-e8f4b1b2e3c9.png)\n\n_btw genymotion is shit._\n. Gradle plugin 0.9.2\n\n> Aapt-based PNG processor is now default again while we investigate some issues with the old one.\n\nI think in new versions of plugin we can keep optical bounds.\n. Use app-scope id instead (R.id.content, not android.R.id.content)\n. You tried to cast ListAdapterWrapper to your own adapter impl.\nCause is ListView an automatically wrap any adapter to ListAdapterWrapper passed to.\nSo you can use `ListView.getAdapterSource()` instead of `getAdapter()`\n. It's feature of system-ui, not applications.\nImpossible.\n. Again: it's not possible to make a status bar a transparent. Action bar - yes, but not status.\n. Create your own theme and put attrs windowTranslucentNavigation/windowTranslucentStatus = true.\nHoloEverywhere is backward-compitablity library, all features should be available for all versions.\n. Plugin version?\n\nTry to invoke `./gradlew --refresh-dependencies clean build` first.\n. Did you read a [wiki](https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/wiki/Addon:-Preference-Framework)?\n. @kkocel okay, will released into couple hours.\n. @kkocel ... or not. Plugin seems to be incompatible with latest gradle/android plugin version.\n. @ChristopheVersieux yep, one my friend already suggest me this idea :D\n. MaterialEverywhere sounds cool - let's keep brand! :)\nI have plans to provide some compability support for custom inflaters for layouts/drawables and also backport shadow effects, but I'll begin work only after final L release. And I need to go to university for now, so not too much time available for work for me. But it's great idea and I really need to realize it.\n\nAnd yeah... Fuck 2.x!\n. @ChristopheVersieux good links, thanks :)\n\nAnyway I have some plans about MaterialEverywhere, it will not a fat library as HE. I have some interest concept for now, it's awesome for me :)\n. @kkocel we will support new drawables. Plus optional drawable inflater module.\n. @kkocel that's secret ;) Soon I'll publish sources and setup repositories. Then community (and I) can develop modules for library.\n. Yep, you right, it's `holoEveruwhere` project source code.\n\n... maybe some description need for this issue? Not sure...\n. Yep, you can change this behavior by providing custom slider layout.\nOr just delete `//addons/slider/res/layout-w720dp/slider_default_layout.xml` and rebuild your app, then drawer will have no difference between phone and tablet.\n. Sometimes [wiki](https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/wiki/Addon:-Preference-Framework#i-put-custom-preference-styles-in-the-activity-theme-but-nothing-happened) can be very useful...\n. Plugin 0.3.2 released with 0.12 support.\n. @william-ferguson-au \n- Because HE's version convention is MAJOR.MINOR+1.PATCH from official Google's version.  \n  eg. HE's 19.2.0 is Google's 19.1.0. HE's 19.1.0 is Google's 19.0.0.\n- Patchset available in `support-library` branch with name `holoeverywhere.patch`\n. @william-ferguson-au And has conflicts with all other libraries which uses support-library after it.\nYou could build anything with any other patches from any version of code and push it to your own repository or even local repo. I will not publish any other versions of any components into HE's repo.\n\nBtw you could specify version as `19.+` and has always fresh version of library.\n. @rkistner _No_ many releases of HoloEverywhere ever. You could be your own version with any dependencies - license allow it ;)\n. @boonkerz Nothing, repo is temporary down. You could bind plugin to your own repo with precompiled version of library.\n. Repo is up.\n. Dupe #843\n. @ratan12\nWell... yeah.\n![screenshot from 2014-08-21 22 53 42](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1416030/3996934/97716584-293a-11e4-97da-653e94be0986.png)\n\nAre you have any issues with new repo?\n. HoloEverywhere Plugin 0.3.3 released with correct repo address.\n. Just import LayoutInflater from org.HoloEverywhere, not from android.view.\n. And... Why this in HoloEverywhere's tracker?\n. Sorry, indeed HoloEverywhere's issue, will fix in couple hours.\n. Fixed.\n. @larrymeng AutoCompleteTextView is extended EditText, so all ways for styling basic EditText applicable for ACTV too. You can colorize default blue background and apply new background for widget via styles or layout.\n. Make sure that you have latest version of Android Studio (0.8.11 for now) and latest version of library sources (b870abb for now). I've been successfully import library into studio.\n. Bots should die.\n. On the core server hard disk damage happened. I have no repo backup and may not rebuild artifacts for re-uploading.\n. So... _source code_ of library and plugin available in this repo.\n. @josemando egh... I'll try to recompile artifacts.\n. Support library recreated at version 21.1.2 (based on google's 21.0.2), build plugin is updated... Please wait.\n. I didn't said that all infrastructure is restored, wait any news.\n. 890515f23ce744fc6957be19e9bef98c6367af80\n. If you use the TabHost/TabActivity - please do not do this. Use the tabs in the ABS and fragments.\n. 1a73ab0297138c0a701b390376c896cf26ec913b\n. 1a73ab0297138c0a701b390376c896cf26ec913b\n. The fonts were moved to the raw resources 1a73ab0297138c0a701b390376c896cf26ec913b, others removed\n. Test support of setItems: 3d20ab16f555740be3a30990bcf9b474fd96cba1\n. f77568910d379545b1d17cfebda6bff62145ef31\n. c3305f1d1da2e8ecffe60337e4495113566163f5\n. Decline\n. On Android >= 2.1 you should run ActionBarHoloDemoActivity instead HoloDemoActivity.\n. HoloAlertDialogBuilder is deprecated, use HoloEverywhere.AlertDialog instead\n\n1a73ab0297138c0a701b390376c896cf26ec913b\n. @ironjan AutoCompleteTextView already supported in dev version, in the future - version 1.2.2\n. 48d3fe01092a822feea3b997b83061b7284d8603\n. HoloAlertDialogBuilder still very raw, and for some reason do not want to develop.\nAs an alternative, I can offer you my fork HoloEverywhere, there AlertDialog rewritten, and everything looks correct.\n\nSorry for bad english:)\n. Hello, Christophe!\n\nOkay, i'm create pull request in the near future, I think, today.\n\nThe link to the profile ... No, because this is a open-source, then everyone gives as much as can.\n. Oh, i'm yet prepare commit.\nIn brief: you should define custom theme with inheritance of the desired HoloEverywhere themes and also specify a couple of attributes.\n. Christophe, close this issue.\n. Try to place the content of dialogue dimensions WrapContent.\nAnd HoloAlertDialogBuilder not removed.\n. Strangely, my AlertDialog compresses to the size of the content.\nCan you show a layout for the dialog?\n. https://github.com/ChristopheVersieux/HoloEverywhere/pull/54\n. Why did you remove the constructor DialogButtonBar(Context context, AttributeSet attrs, int defStyle)?\n. Yes, the constructor View(Context, AttributeSet, int) appeared only in 2.2 (or 2.1, can not remember).\nBut that is no reason to remove it from the library.\nCode will be compiled under the target sdk > 11 and run on a 1.6 normally.\n. dbca48a6ac92ba049881f7260529ebd5b609bf6f\n. Preference framework is not yet supported in HoloEverywhere.\nAdded to the TODO list.\n. Porting state: 80%.\nI has been push into my fork tommorow.\n\nThanks for idea:)\n. 95% ... it can be today :)\n. Please, test Preference Framework, his support is not full, but the main part is already working.\n. See a HoloDemo. [preferences.xml](https://github.com/ChristopheVersieux/HoloEverywhere/blob/master/HoloDemo/res/xml/preferences.xml)\nRequired XML NS holo.\n\nAnd Theme.HoloEverywhereLight.Sherlock a deprecated. Use Holo.Theme.Sherlock.Light\n. ListPreference (and MultiListPreference) temporary don't supported.\n. :D\nDonations in open-source projects a little strange.\nActually, everything depends on AlertDialog, it's almost ready, but there was one problem - he stretched to full screen, I'm trying to overcome it.\n. @StenaviN \u043a\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0438, \u043d\u0438\u0437\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0433\u0438\u0442\u0445\u0430\u0431\u0435, \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0443\u0448\u0430\u0442 \u0432\u0435\u0434\u044c :D\nAlertDialog \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0442 \u0432 \u043f\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0430\u0445 \u0441\u0438\u0434\u0438\u0442, \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443 \u0434\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442\u044c, \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0438 \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u044e :D \u0448\u0443\u0447\u0443.\n@otis23 I'm going to torture dialog.\n.

ListPreference and MultiSelectListPreference now supported.\n. Are you fast :D\nJust been corrected.\n. Damn, accidentally closed\n. @otis23 You VERY fast. Already fixed :)\n. @otis23 I have paypal, but I will not accept money. I work for the benefit of Open-Source, and not for money.\n. @alaney Show you xml and code. And see demo, of course.\n. Yes, you right.\n. I reject this pull request, stating:\n1. You did not use Builder\n2. This fix (even slightly improved) will soon be with my edits to support Preference Framework\n. Do you mean replacing the default images on Holo counterparts? No, it is not possible for this application must have the package 'android'.\n. HoloEverywhere has a new dependecy: KFramework-SW, porting Switch on Android 1.6.\nUpdate submodules and import a new project from contrib folder.\n. f77568910d379545b1d17cfebda6bff62145ef31\n. Okay, I porting native AlertDialog from jelly bean, please wait:)\n. f77568910d379545b1d17cfebda6bff62145ef31\n. f77568910d379545b1d17cfebda6bff62145ef31\n. Fixed in 1.2.1\n. E/AndroidRuntime( 7473):        at android.view.LayoutInflater.inflate(LayoutInflater.java:352)                                                                         \n\nIt's not correct, shoud use com.WazaBe.HoloEverywhere.LayoutInflater.\n\nYou have latest source?\n. #71, duplicate, close.\n. Rejected.\nThis is due to entanglement listChoiceIndicatorSingle and listChoiceIndicatorMultiple, it must be corrected. The consequences can be seen even in the preferences screenshot - there is also confused CheckBox and RadioButton. Today will be the first update to version 1.2.1, it's will fix.\n. Okay, i fix it in update to 1.2.2, tommorow.\n. 48d3fe01092a822feea3b997b83061b7284d8603\n. dialogButton(Border) and DialogButtonBar was a custom components. With porting AlertDialog from Jelly Bean DialogButtonBar no longer needed. DialogButtonBar and dialogButton attribute removed in 1.2.1. Completely. You do not have the latest version.\n. Yes, it is bug. Will be fixed in 1.2.2\n. 48d3fe01092a822feea3b997b83061b7284d8603\n. @jbellander Yes, you may see it on screenshots\n. Yes, light AlertDialog contains in screenshots to 1.2.2 release: https://github.com/ChristopheVersieux/HoloEverywhere/blob/48d3fe01092a822feea3b997b83061b7284d8603/website/screen6.png\n. Try to update: just now released 1.2.2\n. Oh, yes, in select_dialog_item_holo using attribute textColorAlertDialogListItem for text color, but it is available from 11 api. You may change text color in sources, or wait a 1.2.3 :)\n\nFixed in dev version\n. Yes, i know. I work on porting Spinner.\n. 6416ba54efd999c908399798428a37c056aa8934\n. Use dev version. Fragments began supported only in the dev version of just a couple of hours ago.\n. Version of library? 1.2.2?\n\nAnd: com.pocketwriters.widgets.ListPreferenceMultiSelect extends from com.WazaBe.HoloEverywhere.preference.MultiSelectListPreference?\n. http://i.imgur.com/CZf1c.png\n\nAndroid 4.0.4, arm6, 256 mb, this is work! :)\n\nPlease, full stack trace. You cropped it.\n. Like anything strange ... And what theme is activity?\n. ```\nE/AndroidRuntime( 1709): at android.view.LayoutInflater.inflate(LayoutInflater.java:396)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 1709): at com.WazaBe.HoloEverywhere.preference.Preference.onCreateView(Preference.java:473)\n```\n\nStop, why? Should use com.WazaBe.HoloEverywhere.LayoutInflater\n. @iNdieboyjeff differences in the library contains only one folder - values-v14. try to remove it and say the result.\n\nAnd another thing: open R.java your application and say that the resource is hidden by id 0x7f010067\n. yes, from library.\n. i forgot specify attributes selectableItemBackground, borderlessButtonStyle, segmentedButtonStyle for light styles :-/\n\nThanks for find bug! :D\n. You may update lib from dev branch, i fix it.\n. Say thank Christophe - if not for his project, something like that I would not do that.\nOh and one person from the 4pda forum, who showed me this project.\n. Okay, I'm tired today :D I'll sleep for a change...\n\n~~Good night!~~ Thanks everyone for help, test and development!\n. Fixed in dev version two days ago.\n. No, it's not fixed, i'm sorry:)\n. Fixed in current dev version\n. ## Notice for developers\n\nIf you make changes in styles.xml - use the Builder, otherwise pull request will not be accepted.\n. You should cast view to all contains in package com.WazaBe.HoloEverywhere.widget, exclude TextView and LinearLayout. For TV and LL you can use android.widget._, but com.WazaBe.HE.widget._ also has work;\n\nDatePicker - added to todo list.\n. @M1cha CalendarView - com.WazaBe.HoloEverywhere.widget.CalendarView or simply CalendarView. Included in 1.2.3. In 1.2.4 will DatePicker(Dialog)\n. 8cc4a920ec7716eabb7a966c83b901e17e3ed76e\n. Please wait... i'm update demo and fix a bug in DatePicker :) 1.2.4...\n. OMG... I find next bug: spinners on DatePicker is working... but drawing state not changing. Spinners a freezes. I will work on that:)\n. Fixed in current dev version\n. Nice.\n. yes, in 1.2.0 listChoiceIndicatorSingle defined twice. But 1.2.0 - old version, current stable 1.2.3 don't have this bug.\n. Responsibility for Maven repo - Neoasket and Christophe. Wait for their comments.\n\nWell, you can manually install the 1.2.3 version to the local repository.\n. Yes, if you use standart ABS - you lose support tabs.\nSee https://github.com/ChristopheVersieux/ActionBarSherlock/commit/0584a38a342b9bc95156c56c07304b04f8adedd4\n. @annoma getSupportActionBar().addTab().\nIn TabListener FragmentTransaction will be null.\n. Yes, 1.3.1 will be pushed to maven. Soon. Serious.\n. 1.3.3 pushed just now. Will be available in a couple of hours.\n. 0x12 - boolean type. AlertController$RecycleListView override only one method, don't modify styles. You may send framework-res.apk from device?\n\nIn AOSP AbsListView.java doesn't occur at the call getDimensionPixelSize\n. Tommorow, okay?\nI'm already sleeeeep....\n. It... it's bug in android framework.\nPreferenceGroupAdapter.\ngetItemViewType.\nHas:\n\n```\n        if (preference.hasSpecifiedLayout()) {\n            return IGNORE_ITEM_VIEW_TYPE;\n        }\n```\n\nShould:\n\n```\n        if (!preference.hasSpecifiedLayout()) {\n            return IGNORE_ITEM_VIEW_TYPE;\n        }\n```\n\nWill be fixed in 1.2.4\n. Well,. It's not HE bug.\nMay be, ABS or specify ROM...\nBut I try find root cause.\n. It bug shows only on light theme?\n. Well, may be alpha channel?\nTry to replace in background_holo_*.xml next content:\n\n```\n        android:endColor=\"#ff272D33\"\n        android:startColor=\"#ff020202\"\n```\n\non this:\n\n```\n        android:endColor=\"#272D33\"\n        android:startColor=\"#020202\"\n```\n. You may force set pixel format for window:\ngetWindow().getAttributes().format = PixelFormat.RGB_565; or other PixelFormat\n. May be... I will be think on this problem.\n. When @ChristopheVersieux has been return from vacation - he is update demo.\nBut version without ABS is not planned.\nMay be in future...\n. @kevsmt 1.2.3 or dev version? They're different like a chicken and a dinosaur.\n. ... I'm compiled dev version :D\nI am reluctant to switch between branches.\nhttp://ubuntuone.com/5V92aLdQkHyS40ndhwiMFo\n\nBefore install uninstall the older version, signed by different keys.\n. With 1.2.4 project will has a small web-page... And there may well be put demo APK... Everything is possible.\n. I don't can repeat this bug. You may make a video?\n. Which version of Android used?\n. DatePicker is very strange.\nI'll rewrite it to maintain compatibility with the old API.\n. Is autoCompleteTextViewStyle commented - than it don't supported in this moment.\nWait for full support.\n. @svenkapudija A couple of hours appears in dev branch, respectively, will be at Stable 1.2.4\n. 1. You should use theme Holo.Theme.*** in designer.\n2. Designer can't display the layout for custom elements (at least, that the layout that is in the dev branch.)\n. We are talking about exactly the same?\nIf so, I was like you did not understand. Can you take screenshots?\n. ![Screen](http://ubuntuone.com/31HVeso6iPb4nfD4xCUTih)\nAndroid 2.1.\n. ![Screen](http://ubuntuone.com/74Fc8pNzMqYpU68QAjV50i)\n. ThemeManager resolve theme to Holo.Theme.Sherlock.Light.Fullscreen\n. Also, it's dev version. May be, this bug only in 1.2.3?\n. Well, bug not confirmed. Close.\n. @PatteSMO LinearLayout already inflate <LinearLayout> as com.WazaBe.HoloEverywhere.widget.LinearLayout\n. Okay, I supplement the readme in next version, many people have some questions to highlight it.\n. Duplicate #89\nYou may upload framework-res.apk from device?\n. Also framework.jar, please :)\n. Try this build: http://ubuntuone.com/5V92aLdQkHyS40ndhwiMFo\n. It's standart behavior of AlertDialog.\nYou may create android.app.AlertDialog and sure.\n. FT: you compile HE demo with standart abs, should use fork.\nLisr: duplicate #98, already fixed\n. Standart ABS - from Jake repo. You should use fork from Christophe repo. When will be release 4.2.0 ABS - we are don't need to fork more.\n. Duplicate #100, #98\n. Full stacktrace, please.\n. Then I want to congratulate you - you are the master. To date, the library has a bug that makes it impossible to create a menu in fragments.\nBug confirmed.\n. android.R.layout.simple_spinner_dropdown_item - CheckedTextView, use another layout.\n. It's will be custom impl. If you have good numberpickerpreference - you may send pull request, of course. But not fact, what it will be accepted:)\n. No.\nUse default preference package. And name then as NumberPickerPreference.\n. When NPP in AOSP will be created - we a port new NPP with save compat. Only standart preference package.\n. Already exists :) And you impl don't support summary and icon.\n. Well, if you think that my implementation is not enough opportunities - you can still finish it.\n\n> This is important to be able to call getNumberPicker from activity or fragment.\n\nViews from preferences should be handled only in themselves preference, otherwise it would be violation of simplicity and strange state of prefs in adapter.\n. @prom85 spinner mode in XML does not work?\nSo do not lie.\nYou may change style with override spinner mode for all spinners, or only one spinner in layout:\n\n```\n<style name=\"MySpinner\" parent=\"@style/Holo.Spinner\">\n  <item name=\"spinnerMode\">dialog</item>\n</style>\n```\n\n```\n<Spinner ...\nholo:spinnerMode=\"dialog\" />\n```\n. Perhaps you used android:spinnerMode, which Spinner of HE does not work.\n. Why?  And why in master branch?\n. (S)Activity/(S)ListActivity/(S)ExpandableListActivity/(S)PreferenceActivity a = ...;\nLog.v(\"TAG\", (a instanceof FragmentActivity) + \"\");\n\n> true\n\nWell, MapActivity... I will be think :)\n.

Try to call replace() with fragment manager...\nI... I don't know. I haven't pc in this moment.\n. Fixed in 1.3, without reflection :)\n. It's fixed in dev version.\n. See #603 bug in ABS tracker\n. See demo, bro:)\nYou should use holo: prefix instead android:\n. Of course, listPrefferedItemPaddingLeft and other attrs avaiable since 3.0. Use it without android package prefix.\n. Fixed in 1.3\n. ... What? Window layout inflater (just PhoneLayoutInflater from internal android package) cannot be cast to HoloEverywhere.LayoutInflater, never. Try getLayoutInflater().setFactory(this) before calling super.onCreate in activity.\n. Test it with new version\n. Use SActivity, man.\n. Yes, it's bug.

See demo. setForceThemeApply in Activity, ThemeManager.modifyDefaultTheme, ThemeManager.modify for all themes used in ThemeManager. And sure restartWith(Dark/Light/LightWithDarkActionBar)Theme. But it's restart, don't call it in onCreate.\n. And Application.getConfig().setAlwaysUseParentTheme/setUseThemeManager\n. Let's start by defining: you need to set a theme on Activity or on all application?\nIf first: is not satisfied setTheme?\nIf second: then yes, you should use ThemeManager. But does not enable the everything, in the hope that everything will work out.\n\n`Application.getConfig().setUseThemeManager(true).setAlwaysUseParentTheme(true);` - as static block in your application class.\n\n`ThemeManager.setDefaultTheme(ThemeManager.DARK)` Or LIGHT, LIGHT_WITH_DARK_ACTION_BAR. There also.\n`ThemeManager.modify(ThemeManager.FULLSCREEN)` - if you want full screen theme.\n`ThemeManager.modify(ThemeManager.NO_ACTION_BAR)` - and if you want theme without action bar.\n\nOn launcher activity you should set @Holo annotation with attr forceThemeApply = true, or call setForceThemeApply(true) before call super.onCreate.\n\nFor restart activity with new theme use ThemeManager.restartWith***Theme.\n. With custom themes you should allow them to use. `ThemeManager.setOnlyBaseThemes(false)` before setting any themes.\n. Application sample with using custom themes: [download](http://ubuntuone.com/3xNlkx4ozSHnVOSOkIlJUZ)\n. About ListPreference: use getSupportSharedPreferences (or getDefaultPreferences), will be reverted to getSharedPreferences in next release.\n. Yes? i'm sorry: [download](http://ubuntuone.com/1WD9b60uH6z5CD9yfLZtvz)\n. Maybe you use android namespace in xml for preferences? HoloEverywhere work only with custom namespace (in demo them have name 'holo')\n. Show me here at least one class of HoloEverywhere.\n. No, ListView yet native.\n. It's bug in SeekBarDialogPreference, fixed in dev version, i think :)\n. \u041a\u0430\u043a-\u0431\u044d \u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0441\u044c \u0434\u043e 1.3.2, \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u0437-\u0437\u0430 4.1, \u0430 \u0438\u0437-\u0437\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0441\u044f\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043c\u0435\u0442\u043a\u0438 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u044d\u043a\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432.\n.

It's bug in system ListView when list data updates in background window.\nWhen you click on Spinner - showing popup window with spinner items, activity window has flag focus = false.\n\nTemp workaround:\nOverride method onWindowFocusChanged in Activity:\n\n``` java\n    @Override\n    public void onWindowFocusChanged(boolean hasFocus) {\n        super.onWindowFocusChanged(hasFocus);\n        if (hasFocus) {\n            listView.onWindowFocusChanged(true);\n            listView.invalidate();\n            listView.invalidateViews();\n        }\n    }\n```\n. No, I don't  have workaround for this. \n. @minioreo \n\n> As a temporary workaround, setting: `Application.config().setDisableContextMenu(true);`\n\nI'm working on it.\n. ``` java\n    @Override\n    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n        addPreferencesFromResource(R.xml.preferences);\n        final ListPreference p = (ListPreference) findPreference(\"list\");\n        p.setOnPreferenceChangeListener(new OnPreferenceChangeListener() {\n            @Override\n            public boolean onPreferenceChange(Preference preference, Object newValue) {\n                p.setSummary(\"My new value: \" + newValue);\n                return true;\n            }\n        });\n    }\n```\n\nAfter first launch:\n![Screen](http://i.imgur.com/W0Eih.png)\nAfter select entry:\n![Screen](http://i.imgur.com/E5KKM.png)\nAfter select another entry:\n![Screen](http://i.imgur.com/E3uZY.png)\n.

Test please.\n. @bkhall fixed.\n. @soarcn fixed via b5e25f4\n@bkhall change imports on android.widget.AdapterView\n. Mmm, in ArrayAdapter uses android.widget.TextView - if view cannot be cast to it - view is generally something not textual.\n. List Preference use select dialog single choice layout.

First: install m2e and m2e-android.\nSecond: fixed in latest commit.\nThird: Go to android and select any target (min 14)\n. Duplicate #255\n. But it OnSharedPreference_Change_Listener, if you don't modify value - why need call the listener?\n\nSorry for the late reply.\n. Hm. Yea, you right. But which implementation you use? XML or JSON? \n. But xml impl only wrap a native impl and don't modify logic of listeners. \n. In 1.3 by default was be JSON impl. Change to it and report. \n. See demo for need release: in your application object in static block code:\nApplication.config().setPreferenceImpl(PreferenceImpl.JSON) for 1.4.0-1.4.2.\n. Since 1.4.1 HoloEverywhere support only maven-android type for the projects (required m2e and m2e-android).\nYou can remove .classpath files from project and add projects into eclipse from file - new - android project from exists code.\n. Adapter view use getadapter for some needs. If getadapter will be unwrap adapter - then fact of wrap of adapter meanless. \n\nAbout issue: fastscroll fixed. \n. Fixed via da13ec5d\n. Update support library to r11. By default HoloEverywhere using r7, where onViewStateRestored not exists.\n. You use android.view.Window instead actionbarsherlock Window.

Oops, `android:listChoiceBackgroundIndicator`, i'm sorry :)\n. Try to set two attributes: android:listChoiceBackgroundIndicator and android:listSelector with equals values (your selector).\n. Duplicate attrs in theme.\n. Gm, I don't know) I will answer tomorrow. \n. Execute the step \"Rebuild library with Maven\" include keystore specify. \n. You can use exists keystore, but you cannot skip 2 step. \n. 1) Any keystore.  \n2) Yea, right, full path with C:/... \n. Just run build via Eclipse. \n. All correct, but install API 16 platform. \n. Check on javac in PATH. Run `HoloEverywhere Build` again.\nFurther discussion is meaningless - it does not refer to HoloEverywhere. Try StackOverflow or other QA resource.\n.

I don't can reproduce this bug. Modify project in `bugs` branch (above) for crash application after onRestoreInstanceState.\n. It's android bug, but this issue should be fixed in latest master branch, try it.\n. Refers #273.\n. @uKL you have more useful implementation of sliding drawer? I could use it if it will be good.\n. @kkocel Mmm... internal package? org.holoeverywhere.internal? Even if it is, then what? The fact that there is should not be used directly by developers.\n@uKL I do not know, but pretty soon. I'm busy right now, but @ChristopheVersieux  promised to return soon,\n. @kkocel Yea, maybe, but i don't see reason for any usage NOA or embedded copy from ABS package in any class of HoloEverywhere. Code was there by my mistake, I admit.\n. Done in 62d21ac6.\n. We will not add support for third-party or system dialogs, it's just not possible. You can get a View of the dialog and create HoloEverywhere.Dialog with the desired view.\n. `GooglePlayServicesUtil.getErrorDialog().getView()` ?\n. `GooglePlayServicesUtil.getErrorDialog().getWindow().getDecorView().findViewById(android.R.id.content)`\n.

Duplicate #296\n. Yes, I think a little clarification of the situation can not hurt.\n\n`DialogFragment.show(FragmentManager, String)` and `DialogFragment.show(FragmentTransaction, String)` is deprecated because there were problems at 2.1-2.3 on restore instance state when tag == null. New methods simply generate tag name from class name and it's hashcode. But this methods also suggest that each DialogFragment's based class at any time will not be more than one instance. If this bothers you - you can use the old methods, it will not be deleted ever. But I recommend to use new methods, just in case ;)\n.

About this:\n\n> The PreferenceCheckBox items are ignoring my custom orange checkbox images\n\nYou should create custom theme extends from Holo.PreferenceTheme and Holo.PreferenceTheme.Light and remap Preference themes on yours:\n\n``` xml\n<style name=\"CustomPreferenceTheme\" parent=\"Holo.PreferenceTheme\">\n  <item name=\"checkBoxPreferenceStyle\">@style/CustomPreferenceCheckBox</item>\n</style>\n<style name=\"CustomPreferenceTheme.Light\" parent=\"Holo.PreferenceTheme.Light\">\n  <item name=\"checkBoxPreferenceStyle\">@style/CustomPreferenceCheckBox</item>\n</style>\n```\n\nIn static code block of your `Application` class:\n\n``` java\nPreferenceInit.map(R.style.CustomPreferenceTheme, R.style.CustomPreferenceTheme_Light);\n```\n. Show code. \n. You are specify theme in manifest. When theme manager resolve activity theme and try to determine color scheme (dark/light/mixed), it's cannot resolve it. And it apply default PreferenceTheme - Dark.\nUse ThemeManager: \n\nYou can apply theme before onCreate:\n\n``` java\nsetTheme(ThemeManager.MIXED);\nsuper.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n```\n\nOr define default application theme in Application class:\n\n``` java\npublic class MyApplication extends org.holoeverywhere.app.Application {\n  static {\n    ThemeManager.setDefaultTheme(ThemeManager.MIXED);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nScreenshots:\n![holoeverywhere_bug299_dark](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/147815/05d718ac-74d8-11e2-946b-6b1be7e6d38d.png)\n![holoeverywhere_bug299_light](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/147816/05d96c4c-74d8-11e2-98c0-bbedb5223e92.png)\n![holoeverywhere_bug299_mixed](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/147817/06172dca-74d8-11e2-936f-8da81ccc6448.png)\n. Now you can specify theme in manifest - theme manager also checking theme attribute for determine color scheme. \n. [Bug project](https://github.com/ChristopheVersieux/HoloEverywhere/blob/bugs/Bug299/AndroidManifest.xml)\n. @demartino88 With latest version from master you can specify any theme from manifest or code, even without ThemeManager. You are all good checked?\n. @mattprecious PreferenceTheme should be extends Holo.PreferenceTheme. \n. Okay, I'm make resolving preference theme also by activity theme attribute, but only tomorrow and only if my girlfriend allow me to run ide :P \n. Reject. Holo.PreferenceTheme(.Light) internal theme. You don't should be apply this themes on application or activity.\n. Thanks!\n. See DemoActivity#onCreateConfig \n. PreferenceFramework?\nYou application should be extends org.holoeverywhere.app.Application and it's should be specified in AndroidManifest.xml in `<application>` tag with `android:name` attr. Or disable `Named preferences` property in org.holoeverywhere.HoloEverywhere class.\n. [Project for Bug #299](https://github.com/ChristopheVersieux/HoloEverywhere/tree/bugs/Bug299), using headers.\n. Please test fix above.\n. Fully fixed via e41bb86c\n. If I'm going to do something in this direction - that is not exactly to the 1.5 release and a special profit will not be there. Do you really want that?\n. No, I meant that I could not improve the performance of even 20% without complete redesign of the architecture PreferenceFramework.\n. For Preference classes which located in org.holoeverywhere.preference already enabled reusage of views in lists. Even if it doesn't help...\n. This issue will be closed while I don't want make it. \n. Mmm... What is it? Why i'm should rollback from 1.5 to 1.4.0?\n. Yea-yea, it's bug of HE. Please wait - I don't have a free time now for fix it. \n. You owe me :D\n![crouton-bug-screenshot](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/175775/5b2f8f42-7b58-11e2-9946-bd34c8e40121.png)\n. Resbuilder generate styles and translations for library and demo. Uses android sdk.\n\nOfficially supported IDE - Eclipse. I'm don't want to support other IDE, really. You can try StackOverflow or other QA resource, and if you want - can supplement pages in Wiki.\n. How is \"why\"? If it writes - believe me, it is so necessary. Or write this attribute in the manifest, or extend your own class from org.holoeverywhere.app.Application (like DemoApplication in demo project).\n. NPE on\n\n> com.dmu.waiter.home.Waiter_Home_Screen.onCreateView(Waiter_Home_Screen.java:73)\n\nAre you try retrive ListView in onCreateView? No, just call getListView().addHeaderView(*) before setListAdapter() or call getListView().setForceHeaderListAdapter(true) and you can add/delete any header/footer views in any time.\n. Create bug project in bugs branch. \n. It's not HoloEverywhere bug. See [1](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10109072/android-listview-edittext-focus-issues) [2](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11414170/edittext-focus-in-a-listview) [3](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9527067/android-edittext-in-listview-loses-focus-on-calling-notifydatachanged) [4](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2679948/focusable-edittext-inside-listview)\n. ``` java\ngetListView().setDescendantFocusability(ListView.FOCUS_AFTER_DESCENDANTS);\n```\n\nThis bug fixed by this line. But still it is not a HE bug.\n. Like #317, we are cannot override any method for all View hierarchy, use api compatible code. \n. View#setBackground was be created only in 16 api. Use setBackgroundDrawable instead. \n. Duplicate #310 \n\nPS.\n\n> I'm using SherlockFragment\n> SherlockDialogFragment\n\nMaybe are you try `org.holoeverywhere.app.Fragment` and `org.holoeverywhere.app.DialogFragment`? :)\n. In the morning I said that you must use Preference.context(Context) to get the styled context.\nI take it back ;)\n\nI created a bug project that creates two nodes: from xml and in code. Both are displayed correctly.\n\nAs a bonus: change the checkbox button to orange, images grabbed from http://android-holo-colors.com.\n![bug319-screenshot](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/191108/dc5f5df4-7f27-11e2-9b1b-807990ccf233.png)\nBy the way, a rather interesting situation: more styles is not necessary for drawables from android-holo-colors.com. It's use standard names of files and if you place this images into your res folder - it's override default blue drawables from HoloEverywhere library.\n. ![he-maven](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/195700/35b62d18-7ffc-11e2-8d4f-25856dfba54e.png)\n[Wiki](https://github.com/ChristopheVersieux/HoloEverywhere/wiki/Maven)\n. ``` java\n@Override\npublic LayoutInflater getLayoutInflater() {\n  return LayoutInflater.from(this);\n}\n```\n\nWhy and how Robolectric to override methods _HoloActivity? Contact the developer of Robolectric.  \nOr extend com.xtremelabs.robolectric.shadows.ShadowLayoutInflater$LayoutInflaterAppSingletonizer$MyLayoutInflater from org.holoeverywhere.LayoutInflater.\n. Officially backport from 4.1 jellybean: [link](http://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/ext/com.google.android/android/4.1.1_r1/android/widget/Switch.java#Switch.onMeasure%28int%2Cint%29). You can fix it and send pull request.\n. Use [DialogFragment#setCancelable(boolean)](https://github.com/ChristopheVersieux/HoloEverywhere/blob/master/library/src/org/holoeverywhere/app/DialogFragment.java#L284)\n. setCanceledOnTouchOutside work, but you set it's value before DialogFragment, which call setCancelable(true) that call setCanceledOnTouchOutside(true) also.\n. Support roboguice still not complete, although most things should be working already. Please test holoeverywhere + roboguice to anything more than a demo project higher.\n\nDo not forget to add next line to your activity class, bug in roboguice.\n\n```\n@Inject ContentViewListener ignored;\n```\n. Now fragments extend activity config, like attaching roboguice. And if you attach fragment to activity which has roboguice addon - fragment also will be have roboguice addon. Just for reference :)\n. Library version? Are you try to update to latest version from master branch?\n. You want slide only content or make menu static on large screen?\n\nIf first:\nLatest master version:\n\n``` java\nAddonSlidingMenuA addon = addon(AddonSlidingMenu.class);\naddon.setSlidingActionBarEnabled(false);\n```\n\nStable version (1.4.2):\n\n``` java\nAddonSlidingMenuA addon = requireAddon(AddonSlidingMenu.class).activity(this);\naddon.setSlidingActionBarEnabled(false);\n```\n\nIf second: you can see example of demo project and in [SlidingMenu](https://github.com/jfeinstein10/SlidingMenu) repo by @jfeinstein10.  \nTwo layouts: in layout/ and layout-w***dp/. First contains only frame for content, second splited by two frames: for menu and for content. Of course quite a bit of code in activity :)\n. Just apply .NoActionBar theme to activity.

Setting theme after super.onCreate _definitely_ bad idea. ThemeManager cannot check it, Or rather, it _can_, but not do it now.\n\nYou are try to get action bar before setting content - try to call getSupportActionBar() only after setting content.\n. Without custom theme get support action bar works normally? \n. In custom TextView you can override setTypeface:\n\n```\npublic class MyTextView extends TextView {\n / Constructors /\n  @Override\n  public void setTypeface(Typeface typeface) {\n\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn constructor obtain your Typeface instance and set it with super.setTypeface(typeface).\n\nBut i'm recommend just create custom HoloFont object and apply it on view with built-in tools, like FontLoader and LayoutInflater.\n. AddonSlider override findViewById and pass it to content view. Compatibility with old code is saved. It's all just working in the demo. Also after onPostCreate _any_ attached view to left/right/content to sliding menu will be into decorview of window.\n. Oops, yea, left/right view doesn't pass, sorry. One minute...\n. Fixed.\n.

Rewrited for detaching (not removing) fragments from parent fragment only if child fragment was be inflated via xml.\n. Duplicate #358\n. Yea, related with #380, but... Holo.Theme.Dialog have android:windowContentOverlay=@null...\n. Stop... I know cause. Fix will be tomorrow. \n. Run `mvn clean` into support-library. This install artifact com.google.android:support-v4:r12 into local maven repository. By default this target runs when you are try to rebuild all repository.\nm2e-android have a bug with overriding of dependencies, that you _should_ replace jar into abs/libs.\n. Attach preference framework from addons folder. \n. [Preferences addon](https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/tree/master/addons/preferences)\n[Facebook sdk for HE](https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/tree/addon-facebook)\n. 1) No, only changes in library.\n2) Any applications\n3) You should provide full copy of license, not only link.\n. Yea, also you can simply write \"HoloEverywhere\" and text of license below.\n. My fucked English is very bad, no?\nAre you /really/ want to read my docs?\n. HoloEverywhere use a maven, yea, but you can build your project with internal ide tools (adt, idea and other).\nAbout error: re-run maven with -e key and show me full stacktrace.\n. Basic JavaDoc placed [here](http://prototik.github.io/HoloEverywhere/docs/)\n. In ICS it was be radial gradient, yea, thanks.\n. No, this breaks view overriding and support of nested fragments. You can try - 99% of code in demo will be throw ClassCastException. \n. Fixed via fa59aa35d0\n. Now HoloEverywhere simply don't add any custom layout for selector. If you find different in native and backported behavior - tell me.\n. See #298\n.

This action will be reset on next maven build, you should modify basemap in library/resbuilder folder.\n2. This reference provide a holo-styled options menu on pre-HC. If you want - you /can/ create custom style and override android:itemBackground to null. But you can just override selectableItemBackground and recolor it, this works and for overflow popup, and for menu.\n. Temporary solution: use themes Holo.Theme.Dialog.FixedSize and Holo.Theme.Dialog.Light.FixedSize.\n. Fixed via 536e0abee82f8b463392319d7683d7350deced48\n. For using in application context for creating preferences you should... F*ck, why are you use application context?\n\nSo, well, you should apply Holo.Theme\\* on application context. If it no will work - wrap context by PreferenceInit.context(Context) method, like this:\n\n``` java\n    private static Context context = PreferenceInit.context(ApplicationSubclass.getApplicationContext_());\n```\n. You couldn't be use any layout_\\* attributes in root view via inflating view without parent (like View.inflate or LayoutInflater.inflate(R.layout.bla, null)).\nYou can use android:minHeight instead.\n. HoloEverywhere uses ActionBarSherlock for backporting a ActionBar on older systems. Just create styles for ABS.\n![asd](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/424305/93369922-ad84-11e2-8c90-932cfd60a5d8.png)\n. Can't reproduce.\n.

No, i didn't use ProGuard. Never.\n. Full stacktrace, please.\n. Fixed in `org.holoeverywhere:addon-roboguice:2.0`\n. Not HE bug.\nOfficially supported tab navigation - [TabSwipeActivity](https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/blob/master/library/src/org/holoeverywhere/app/TabSwipeActivity.java)/[TabSwipeFragment](https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/blob/master/library/src/org/holoeverywhere/app/TabSwipeFragment.java). If this bug still occur in this case - post it.  \n[Usage example](https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/blob/master/demo/src/org/holoeverywhere/demo/fragments/DemoTabsFragment.java)\n. I'm not recommend use fragments while content view not created.\nAs a id `android.R.id.content`.\n\nCreate a simple layout:\n\n``` xml\n<FrameLayout xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n  android:id=\"@+id/content\"\n  android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n  android:layout_height=\"match_parent\" />\n```\n\nAnd in fragment manager use `R.id.content` instead of `android.R.id.content`.\n. For `<intent>` and `<category>` now you should use holo: namespace, like for other nodes in layout.\n\nDemo builded via maven works fine, it's problems in your build environment.\n. Spinner at top and left has default behavior. For third spinner was called setDropDownWidth with display width param.\nWorks fine on 2.1, 2.3, 4.2.\n![screenshot from 2013-05-22 15 31 04](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/546929/fffb388c-c2b1-11e2-9313-07aa814c3eda.png)\n[Bug APK for testing](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BxcxDFWRyauQMEp4cXFFb2xXeWc/edit?usp=sharing)\n. 1.6.0 release\n![device-2013-05-23-171947](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/553577/261086d4-c38a-11e2-95d2-6c60db27aba4.png)\n. Place your font in res/raw folder.\nUse method `HoloFont.makeFont(**)` for creating a new instance of font object.\nAlso you can provide four styles of fonts (regular, bold, italic, bolditalic) like this:\n\n``` java\n            ROBOTO = makeFont(\n                    ROBOTO_REGULAR = makeFont(R.raw.roboto_regular),\n                    ROBOTO_BOLD = makeFont(R.raw.roboto_bold),\n                    ROBOTO_ITALIC = makeFont(R.raw.roboto_italic),\n                    ROBOTO_BOLD_ITALIC = makeFont(R.raw.roboto_bolditalic)\n                    );\n```\n\nAnd finally call `FontLoader.setDefaultFont(HoloFont)` and this font will be everywhere in application.\nThis code should be placed in static `Application` codeblock, of course.\n.

Update library, Application.Config doesn't exists since 1.4.\n. /Which/ problems are you have? In latest snapshot demo using DrawerLayout - second screenshot on mainpage.\n. Update ABS/libs/android-support-v4.jar by HoloEverywhere/android-support-v4-r13.jar.\nThis step described in `import in ide` guide.\n. [TabSwipeFragment example](https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/blob/master/demo/src/org/holoeverywhere/demo/fragments/TabsFragment.java)\n\nYou don't should call setContentView() in onCreate(). Keep only onHandleTabs():\n\n``` java\npublic class TabSwipe extends TabSwipeActivity {\n  @Override\n  protected void onHandleTabs() {\n    addTab(\"Main\", MainFragment.class, new Bundle());\n    addTab(\"Result\", ResultFragment.class, null);\n    addTab(\"Player\", PlayerFragment.class, null);\n  }\n}\n\n```\n. Android bug.\nIn FragmentStatePagerAdapter#getItem you can manually load this class:\n\n``` java\nClass.forName(ProgressBar.SavedState.class.getName(), true, context.getClassLoader())\n```\n. Original code of ProgressBar use a package visibility.\nOne moment.\n. Fixed :D\n\nNo, it's /really/ android bug.\nAny application have a two classloaders:\n- System classloader. This classloader can load classes only from /system/framework folder. eg `android.*`.\n- Application classloader. This can load classes from application apk. Activities, services and all others classes from apk. This classloader extend system classloader, and if use it everywhere - all ok.  \n  FragmentManager doesn't set any classloader for savedinstance bundle, thats it's use system classloader, which simply don't know about apk anything.\n. But we are use support library - potential, crashes in restore instance state (activity/fragment) /can/ be fixed, but...\nHardly.\n. You can load class by name like this:\n\n``` java\nClass.forName(\"org.holoeverywhere.widget.ProgressBar$SavedState\", true, context.getClassLoader())\n```\n\nwithout moving in org.holoeverywhere.widget package.\n. Fixed in latest commit... Damn...\n. @LukaszJarka anyway it's android bug. And i cannot fix it /fully/ without patching of support library. I don't want.\n\nAlso i see you don't use `org.holoeverywhere.app.Fragment`. Fix placed in it.\n. @kkocel mm, sorry? You just should extends fragments from `org.holoeverywhere.app.Fragment` (or `ListFragment`, or something else). FragmentManager always is standard `FragmentManagerImpl`.\n. Well, i can /totally/ fix this issue, but anyway it's one bike more in this bike-collection-library :D\nOne moment.\n. Damn, i write workaround for this, but i don't want see this terrible code in library. I'll write to android devs mail list and provide patch for support library instead this.\n.

Update library, i'm push commit with this feature 10 minutes ago.\n. No.\n. Noooo.\n. Because I said so.  \nFor this it is necessary to alter the existing flawed implementation of Dialog.  \nTwo options:\n- You do it yourself.\n- You pay me for it, because I need to eat, rest, resources for developing. My girl too.\n\nAlertDialog looks absolutely like Dialog, why not it?\n. Nowhere. HoloEverywhere now doesn't patch dialog layout.  \nFunny, yea?\n. In 0a04b97 i'm fully rewrite a FontLoader.\nNow you can use `android:fontFamily=\"roboto-light\"` (or `sans-serif-light`, or even simply `light`, or `thin`, or ...) and all other roboto fonts even on 2.1+. But for it you should just place a ttf file in `project/res/raw` folder\nIn this comment i attach `HoloEverywhere Resource Palette` project, see `res/layout/activity_main.xml` and `res/raw` folder.\n![device-2013-06-05-203304](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/611702/912db1e2-cddc-11e2-9c0e-b2ebe3b2c50a.png)  \n[Sources on GDrive](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BxcxDFWRyauQQnhOR1p4cVdYSm8/edit?usp=sharing)  \n[APK](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BxcxDFWRyauQSEtRRzNlTjJwZmM/edit?usp=sharing)\n.

Text appearance for textview in layout present is two attrs:\ntextAppearanceSliderItem and textAppearanceSliderItemInverse. You can customize text appearance like this:\n\n``` xml\n<style name=\"CustomSliderTheme\" parent=\"Holo.Internal.SliderTheme\">\n  <item name=\"textAppearanceSliderItem\">@style/CustomTextAppearanceSliderItem</item>\n  <item name=\"textAppearanceSliderItemInverse\">@style/CustomTextAppearanceSliderItem.Inverse</item>\n</style>\n<style name=\"CustomSliderTheme.Light\" parent=\"Holo.Internal.SliderTheme.Light\">\n  <item name=\"textAppearanceSliderItem\">@style/CustomTextAppearanceSliderItem.Light</item>\n  <item name=\"textAppearanceSliderItemInverse\">@style/CustomTextAppearanceSliderItem.Inverse.Light</item>\n</style>\n```\n\nApplication static codeblock:\n\n``` java\nSliderMenu.map(R.style.CustomSliderTheme, R.style.CustomSliderTheme_Light);\n```\n. @domenicop if you want the fonts - do it! But this library too big for using it as a font engine.\nYou can manually cut off FontLoader from library or find a more suitable solution for your targets.\n\nAnd you cannot build HoloEverywhere with ABS via gradle, no one version of this library never support gradle+abs build variation. Only maven+abs and gradle+abc, choose one please.\n. Only one thing i can help - open android.support.v4.app._HoloFragment and modify method `public final View onCreateView(android.view.LayoutInflater, ViewGroup, Bundle` like this:\n\n``` java\n    @Override\n    public final View onCreateView(android.view.LayoutInflater inflater,\n            ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        return onCreateView(getLayoutInflater(), decorView, savedInstanceState);\n    }\n```\n\nThis remove ContextMenuDecorView from all fragments. 3-4 levels of depth.\n\nNot HoloEverywhere problem.\n. I can only try to merge NoSaveStateFrameLayout and ContextMenuDecorView, but it's hardly.\n. Ma... Maybe. I keep this issue opened.\nJRE: -Xss100500Mb\nAndroid: Fuuuuck. Again multiplue parts of undocumented api with different level of operability.\nVMRuntime should work on pre gingerbread devices. But on Ginger VMRuntime is broken...\n. @tkiela for handling a context menu into fragments. Code for removing a CMDV from fragments see above.\nAlso you can remove WindowDecorView (ActivityDecorView into latest snapshot) from activity, then you lose support activity with dialog theme and again support of context menu.\n. Well...\nFucked Sony.\nNo, i like Sony. Really.\nBut sometimes Sony make Android /very/ customized.\n\nI have only Sony U20i with stock 2.1, CM6-7 (2.2-2.3) and CM10 (4.2) - i also cannot reproduce bug.\nTomorrow i make some debug apk, this tester should run it once. Maybe. Or not once.\n. @tomekziel Only if donations will enough for Xperia device :) I have only one Sony device with 2.3.7/4.1 - and i cannot reproduce this bug on this versions.\n. Which your relations with testdroid?  Or you just provide link to me?)\nOkay, i'll see this tommorow.\n. @tomekziel \nTestroid cannot provide me a full access to devices (with debug, adb, etc).\nOnly tests not enough for solving this issue.\n. Well, you can connect to my vpn network (from phone) and allow remote access. Then i can try to fix it.\n.

Wow. Two rules:\n- DO NOT USE APPLICATION CONTEXT FOR DIALOGS! NEVER!\n- AlertDialog doesn't accept activity theme. You should provide something from Holo.Theme.Dialog.Alert[.Light] for it.\n. You should copy fonts from `demo/res/raw` folder into your project. Article about FontLoader will be after next release iteration.\n. But we are can fix it! :)\n. Or we are can not fix it... Hardly.\n. New FontLoader yet not have stable codebase. After next release i'm provide detailed wiki pages about some parts of library, including FontLoader.\n\n> you'll notice\n\nAm I?

First: rebase your commits under `holoeverywhere-1.6.1` tag.\nSecond: make a pull request into master branch, after fix all bad places i'll merge it into need branch.\n.

Well, @OS-Chris - thank you for saving my time :)\n. Only list view has this bug? And show you tabs implementation please. \n. Wow. No, i mean code which switch content between tabs. MainActivity or something similar.\n. Argh. Hardware/software limitations. Like @tomekziel said, you can disable some animations or other hard things.\n. Mmm.. this works with native switch?\n. Well, try to specify size by `<size>` node in shape\n. More details. Is it options menu? Overflow menu? Library version, os version, device info? \n. Are you not want to try 1.6.0 version? \n. Not library bug. Definitely. Vendor or your issue. Seriously. And i don't want to find way how to fix this crap.\n. You shouldn't use id and key together. Choose only one.\n. Well, in 1.6.2-SNAPSHOT i'm fully rewrite a FontLoader. Are you try to use latest `master` version?\n. I'm already :D Bugged commit: c76856abdc1d085ee6b21a370b317e369ec46d9b\n. I don't think that it's HE bug... Library just provide holo style for pre-ics, it even not backport RadioButton behavior or something else... \n. In DrawableCompat was added fallback mode, this issue should fixed.\n. Fixed.\n. Brais, merge it please. \n. Cannot reproduce. I think you call isEnabled before calling notifyDataSetChanged, but after removing some rows from adapter.\n. _Very outdated_\n\nI also don't know how i can reproduce it, and i can not find other similar stacktraces, close it.\n. HE doesn't provide a dialog layout on pre-HC. Maybe in next release...\n. Doesn't use `android.R.id.content` for something in HoloEverywhere.\nNow library not fully implement a content view behavior, but...\nFirst you should set any content view. You can even set null content view, but only once and only after super.onCreate and in onCreate method. And use `R.id.contentView` instead `android.R.id.content`\n. Sony sucks.

Now - no, you haven't standard way for this, but you can simply provide custom item layout and behavior.\n. More details, please. Code. Or something else. Also checkout new version of library in `abc` branch and report (and reopen this issue) if something wrong.\n. In build file in `abc` branch version of library is `1.6.2-SNAPSHOT`, not 1.6.2. Are you use correct version?\n. I shall be free in two weeks. Prior to that, I would not have even the possibility to help.\n. Rejected. Library compiles normally via Android Studio. Maven/Eclipse build i'll fix.\n. You don't should include appcompat with latest master branch. It already contain built-in appcompat with some fixes\n. No, some places in appcompat should be changed for full integration with HE\n. ProGuard remove all runtime annotations from classes. Ask PG don't do it :)\n. /Make/ a pull request, man.\n. I suggest that you improve the code, if you have updated your branch to Fix - I have accepted it.\n. `abc` branch not have a support of maven build yet, only gradle.\n. HoloEverywhere start's migration on ABC, checkout new version of library in `abc` branch and report if issue stayed.\n. Well, merged via 384a40e.

Wow, yeah, of course this should be child fragment manager. Could you make a pull request?\n. You are should sometimes update a library. Eg once in half-year.\n. Well, i recommend you setup a [email](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git) and [username](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-username-in-git) for git.\n. Argh, i said 'close #584'\n. Fixed, i think :) If you can reproduce this bug again with new version of library - report here and reopen this issue.\n. Fixed.\n. It's not HoloEverywhere's NumberPicker, my NP doesn't draw arrows. Maybe you use NP by @SimonVT? Anyway it's not library bug.\n. DatePickerFragment - port from aosp. You can hide title manually or find workaround on stackoverflow/android devs mail list.\n. Library is too old.\n. Yes\n. SliderAddon - overlay for DrawerLayout in support library. You can obtain a DrawerLayout instance by AddonSlider.getDrawerLayout() and customize it like you want.\n. You should use holo: namespace, like in demo.\n. Squash your commits first. \n. You are use a standart version of ABS with old support library. HoloEverywhere provide a patched ABS and support library for max integration in the project. You can obtain this version of ABS (with bundled support library) by executing `git submodule update --init` or [download](/Prototik/ActionBarSherlock) it manually.\n. Fixed.\n. Merged into `abc` branch. Thanks!\n. SlidingMenu addon deprecated. You can use it only with library with same version (1.4.2)\nAll other errors with build via maven i'll fix as soon as possible.\n\nLeave open until maven build is broken.\n. I recommend use a `Slider` addon, see a demo source code (DemoActivity)\n. Maven build is come back.\n. Dupe #546\n. Am... Thanks. If you'll find some errors - report to this issue please.\n.

If you have a issues with it: bug in your code or platform, but not in in library,\n. Yeah, ListView control selected state for childs, you don't should to do it manually. End of story.\n. Feature :)\n. Dupe #605\n. You can disable DrawerLayout by invoking `addonSlider().getDrawerLayout().setDrawerLockMode(DrawerLayout.LOCK_MODE_LOCKED_CLOSED)`.\nAnd reenable again with `DrawerLayout.LOCK_MODE_UNLOCKED`.\n. Merged into `abc` branch. Thanks!\n. Only gradle build is working now as though hint... Yes, HE 2.0 will be in aar format and (maybe) not in maven central.\n. Eclipse build is broken now. Wait for official support.\n. Yes, Eclipse and maven build is broken now. Wait an official support of it.\n. This font is using a Editor in suggestion popup window. Just copy `demo/res/raw/roboto_condensed.ttf` in your project and rebuild it.\n. If he.listview will extend he.adapterview - break a lot of code in app and system level API.

HoloEverywhere contains a built-in patched version of abc. AB-PTR use a standard abc version by google. You should exclude a abc in extra-abc module and build it under HoloEverywhere library.\n. \u0413\u0440\u0443\u0431\u043e \u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u044f, \u043d\u0430\u0434\u043e \u0441\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0439\u043a\u0443 extra-abc \u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0435\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0445 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043b\u0438\u0448\u044c HE. \n. You should exclude any 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7' dependencies from all libraries which you are used. Like this:\n\n```\ndependencies {\n  compile 'com.github.chrisbanes.actionbarpulltorefresh:extra-abc:+' {\n    exclude group: 'com.android.support', module: 'appcompat-v7'\n  }\n}\n```\n. HE 1.6.8 use a ABS. ABS build with support library v4 r7. Nested fragments was added only in r11. You can patch a ABS manually or switch to latest version of HE library which build under appcompat, not ABS.\n. See JakeWharton/ActionBarSherlock#828\n. Well, /all/ other libraries not supported with HoloEverywhere. All closed-source libraries. You can ask crashlytics team for special version of library with bindings on HE library. I cannot help you anyway.\n. In latest versions of android-gradle plugin it's fixed.\n. Fixed via d908724678\n. {set,get}TargetFragment is [part of support library v4](http://bit.ly/16i2kca).

For org.holoeverywhere.widget.Spinner you should use imports from org.holoeverywhere.widget.AdapterView.\nFor org.holoeverywhere.widget.{List,Grid}View you should imports from android.widget.AdapterView (for the some technical reasons).\n. Hm... Yeah, for each rotation (or any other configuration change, like locale switch) activity is recreate all fragments (not only in TabSwipeActivity/Fragment). For saving state fragments respond a FragmentStatePagerAdapter, for saving a current position in tabs - ABC. If you have some issues with it - probably you're doing something wrong.\n.

No, -snapshot postfix should to warn you.\n. Duplicate #636\n. onSearchRequested and other hooks of SearchManager isn't part of HoloEverywhere. You can use SearchView backport and proceed search manually. I cannot help you with it.\n. No, stop.\nIn original code when any error occurred (and allowFileReusage = true) invoking loadTypeface again with allowFileReusage = false. If allowFileReusage already is false or it's second call after allowFileReusage = true then just try to unpack typeface and load it. I don't see any recursion in this algorithm.\n. /Then/ backport patch to 1.6.8 and don't disturb me anymore. I cannot support more than one version of library.\n. Holoeverywhere's ChooserActivity works only with IntentCompat.createChooser, nothing other (including Intent.createChooser and share providers).\n. Make a issue project at issues dir at master branch.\nOn Oct 30, 2013 6:55 AM, \"mspapant\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> I am using the holoeverywhere number picker & dialog (to display the\n> number picker).

Clone a repo (google is your friend) and add activity to `issues` project in root dir of repo. This project already contains some issue's projects and you can do simply copy-paste existing activity and modify it.\n. Argh, again new release of studio...\n. **Use a power, Luke!**\nOf course you can click `Change to org.holoeverywhere.demo.widget.WidgetContainer` and be happy. But for what?\nI do not even remember the last time I opened GUI editor.\n\nIn demo layout i'll keep WidgetContainer and nothing other, end of topic,\n. Yeah, thanks.\n. @tomekziel It's right for 1.6.8, 2.0.0 have other behavior for context menu and all things (like anonymous callback) works nice.\n. Like #677, this occurs only in 1.6.8.\n. HoloEverywhere already uses ABC instead ABS, just try it!\n. For HE + ABS use v1.6.8. That's end.\n. Use StackOverflow for questions about library, issue tracker - bad place for it. btw SM and HE using some hack which do this libraries is imcompatible, but I don't see any reasons for using SM instead Slider addon of HE library.\n. You incorrectly update library, without version control, just replacing a files. Fully remove library and try again.\n. Oh, something is broken on github...\nTry to replace repo url to `https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/raw/repo/`\n. Also you don't need more build library from sources, you can use aar from repo.\n. ```\n[prok@prok-pc ~]$ curl -I https://raw.github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/repo/android/android/4.3_r2/android-4.3_r2.jar\nHTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden\n[prok@prok-pc ~]$ curl -I https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/raw/repo/android/android/4.3_r2/android-4.3_r2.jar\nHTTP/1.1 302 Found\n```\n\nStrange...\n. You can use [maven-android-sdk-deployer](https://github.com/mosabua/maven-android-sdk-deployer) and install this artifact  to local maven repo manually by invoking `mvn install -P 4.3`\n. Try latest master with simplified LL\n\n\u0410\u043b\u0441\u043e: Android \u043d\u0435 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442 Erlang :P\n. Create a issue project. I cannot reproduce bug.\n. Rejected\n. incrementProgressBy/incrementSecondaryProgress is final. Use `incrementProgress` instead.\n. ... What? Now aar and apklib just hasn't android:android in dependencies list. Just nowhere.\nOnly in sources pom's, but in repo placed generated poms without this dependency.\n. *2.1.0\n2.1.0 requires com.android.support:support-v4:18.0.3\n. [repo](https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/tree/repo/com/android/support/support-v4/18.0.3)\nAlso please do `git checkout v2.1.0` :)\n. Please do `gradle dependencies`/`gradle androidDependencies`. I just now tested 2.1.0 aar and it doesn't require android:android artifact.\n. Pushed 18.0.4 with correct pom.\n. Not, i cannot modify already pushed artifacts. But something like this:\n\n```\ndependencies {\n  compile 'com.android.support:support-v4:18.0.4@jar'\n  compile 'org.holoeverywhere:library:2.1.0@aar'\n}\n```\n\nshould works.\n. Use android namespace instead.\n. Yeah, for tablets using static layout, without DrawerLayout (like a last screenshot on main page).\nYou should check that drawer layout not null, or use a custom layout with drawerlayout for any dimensions,\n. For HE 2.1 required support-v4 18.0.4. You can grab it [here](https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/blob/repo/com/android/support/support-v4/18.0.4/support-v4-18.0.4.jar) and replace all version of support library (in `libs` folder) by this version.\n. @nono240 Yeah, i know, sorry. (valid only for eclipse/ant build)\n. As you said it's bug of support lib v4 r18, after official migrating on r19 this issue will gone.\n. `latest stable demo` - downloaded from main page of the repo?\n. It's December 2013 version, in latest master branch this bug should be fixed. Please build a demo application from source code.\n. ![device-2013-12-18-224348](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/1774023/f08f6f62-67f2-11e3-8b2b-3d69d993e5a9.png)\n. With HoloEverywhere's support-library-v4 you should use only android namespace in menu xml (and for nodes showAsAction/actionViewClass/actionProviderClass/actionLayout too only android namespace). It will work on 2.1.\n. @4nd3250n some kind of magic. All new properties (included 5.x, 6.x specific) could be obtained on older version, but anyway some code should process this entries. HoloEverywhere processing some entires (like showAsAction, actionViewClass, /etc) and build proper menu in this case.\n. For appcompat you should use meta-data tag:\n\n``` xml\n<activity ... >\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<meta-data android:name=\"android.support.UI_OPTIONS\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0android:value=\"splitActionBarWhenNarrow\" />\n</activity>\n```\n\nYou should have both android:uiOptions and meta-data for supporting all platforms.\n. Which android-gradle version is used? With 0.6.3 and aar i haven't any issues.\n. Any standard way for setting-up shadow for DrawerLayout:\n\n``` java\nDrawerLayout drawerLayout = addonSlider.getDrawerLayout();\nif(drawerLayout != null) {\n  drawerLayout.setDrawerShadow(R.drawable.my_shadow, Gravity.LEFT)\n}\n```\n\n(so you should create a custom shadow drawable)\n. You can override `@dimen/menu_width` over project level.\nCreate a `project/res/values/dimes.xml` (or append to exists):\n\n``` xml\n  <dimen name=\"menu_width\">200dp</dimen>\n```\n\nAlso you can may need to override default menu width with modifiers `-land` and `-w720dp`\n. How to you attach PreferenceFramework? Did you setup an order/export properties? More info please.\n. Export settings?\n. I just now run eclipse and i found library dependencies only in `libraries` tab. In order & export tab you should have only two checked entries: Android Dependencies (which should contains your project's dependencies) and Android Private Libraries.\nPlease check out you project structure, try to create a new project or send this project on my email.\n![screenshot from 2013-12-02 21 35 39](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/1654871/bba105a2-5b56-11e3-9439-e82066e4b469.png)\n![screenshot from 2013-12-02 21 35 42](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/1654872/bba8c922-5b56-11e3-9c2d-8beb8b07259b.png)\n. Of course it have sense which context is used. Without HoloEverywhere's theme widgets cannot be initialized.\n. No, old-styled dialog was removed in 2.0.\n. Dupe #481\nPre-HC devices have a very small stack size, not enough for too many view. You can simplify layouts or do something other which decrease a stack usage.\n. 0xffffffff = -1. Make sure that you have valid references in style/code.\n. No, it's not broken. It will be dialogfragment and I wouldn't provide a pure-dialog variation.\n. It is `a known bug` of ICS. We cannot modify native (ICS+) behavior because... because it is native O_o\nOf course, we can force use of custom implementation of ActionBar, but it out of this library.\n. invalidateOptionsMenu() -> supportInvalidateOptionsMenu()\n\n``` java\nMenuItemCompat.setShowAsAction(menu.add(R.string.robo), MenuItem.SHOW_AS_ACTION_IF_ROOM)\n```\n\nIt's basic of support-v4 / appcompat-v7. Please read official android docs before reporting.\n. Works nicely:\n![device-2013-12-14-122809](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/1747803/5b847fd4-6478-11e3-8f2c-a60ff99907ec.png)![device-2013-12-14-122815](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/1747806/5c163366-6478-11e3-8fcc-a398843d2503.png)\n. Check your build environment. In latest support-v4 19.0.1 (and in all 18.0.*) this class exists and works as expected.\n. ProGuard problem?\n. Make sure that you use a support-v4 19.0.1. If you use gradle - please switch to HoloEverywhere Plugin instead of  raw handling. If maven - add holo repository to your pom.\n. [Wiki](https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/wiki/Gradle)\n. Oops, addons feature seems to broken...\n. You can use this syntax for workaround:\n\n```\nholoeverywhere {\n  addons {\n    'preferences'\n  }\n}\n```\n. Show you `build.gradle`\n. This viewpager indicator create a textview from code (and use android.widget.TextView), we can override only widgets in xml-layout (`<TextView>` tag). Use android.widget.TextView in imports or patch this library for using a holoeverywhere's widgets.\n. Great. What a f*cking shit is broken now?...\n. @josear Demo from [here](http://192.241.191.41/demo-latest.apk) also doesn't work?\n. Hey guys, are you can test [this build](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxcxDFWRyauQcDBkNjh1b25XbVU/edit?usp=sharing) of support-v4?\n. Now i'm a noob in the android development. Really.\n. Of course we can come back to v18, but it's not solution.\nGuys, can i ask for help? Please reboot your phone, install problem application and run it, after crash dialog please send me **full** logcat of phone. You can save full log by invoking something similar:\n`adb logcat > my_log.txt`\n. You should apply holoeverywhere plugin before android plugin. eg:\n\n```\napply plugin: 'holoeverywhere'\napply plugin: 'android'\napply plugin: 'crashlytics'\n```\n\nI'll add warn message to plugin about it.\n. Yeah, sorry, plugin is still in early alpha access, please use this syntax:\n\n```\nholoeverywhere {\n    addons {\n        create 'preferences'\n    }\n}\n```\n\nI'll fix it in next release of plugin.\n. I release plugin 0.2.4 just now, please wait for maven central sync (you can check sync state on [this](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.holoeverywhere%22%20AND%20a%3A%22plugin%22) page) and update your plugin `./gradlew(.bat) clean build --refresh-dependencies`\n. It's WIP,  you right, support for subitems will added later.\n. SupportContextMenu will exists, if you cannot use patched versions of libraries - it's not problem of this library.\n. Read external storage? Great. Just great.\n. You can use a dialog and any activity theme without actionbar (eg Holo.Theme.Light.NoActionBar).\n. See a [comment](https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/commit/a4b852202c6375d0170d6d3988c21cea6b49da2c#commitcomment-4975540). btw for tabs you can use a TabSwipeActivity with proper tab handling.\n. Wh, i plane to use a holoeverywhere plugin for deployment/packaging this (and other btw) library. I'll port current gradle config to plugin in short time.\n. You can provide tag for fragments like this:\n`sliderMenu.add(\"tab2\", Fragment2.class, SliderMenu.GREEN).setTag(\"mynavigation-2\");`\nAlso you can get current page number by `sliderMenu.getCurrentPage()`.\nYou have no way for obtaining current fragment directly, but you can combine this two methods and find fragment via fragment manager: `getSupportFragmentManager().findFragmentByTag(\"mynavigation-\" + sliderMenu.getCurrentPage())`\n. Please test this feature in latest master branch.\n. you don't use holoeverywhere's layoutinflater, which handle all widget overrides, including override switch - org.holoeverywhere.widget.switch. please use layoutinflater passed to oncreateview method.\n. It's limitation of support library. I can provide patch for this issue if you want.\n. Into HoloEverywhere's repo pushed artifact support-v4:19.0.3 (which based on Google's 19.0.1), please switch to this version in our build script.\n. I did send a [pull request](/jeromevdl/android-holo-colors/pull/77) which add holoeverywhere support to android-holo-colors.\nPlease wait for merging it into base repo and next release of android-holo-colors.\n. TabSwipeActivity should correctly process all config changes (including rotation). Make sure that you have no this bug? Could you repeat it with latest version or find a similar in issues project?\n. only  if it support ABC, that no.\n. It's not holoeverywhere bug, inherited behavior of pure android.\n\nNothing checks for selection changed over invalidates datasetobserver,\nBTW datasetobserver doesn't know about 'deletion' of items. He can only notify adapterview about items modification. Definitely you should delete rows via helper method which will be also uncheck needed items.\n. > ```\n>     compile files ('libs/support-v4-19.0.1.jar')\n> ```\n\nGradle doesn't know that this file - artifact com.android.support:support-v4, which provided by GMS as dependency. libs folder provided only for eclipse/ant build, not maven or gradle.\nPlease use a maven dependency notations everywhere.\n. Yes. For handling artifact support-v4 you should also attach holoeverywhere's repo. [Or just use a gradle plugin](/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/wiki/Gradle).\n. Hm, yeah, ABC in current master branch is 18.0.0.\n(btw it's a strange fix, on api > 13 this bug still present)\n. Duplicate #702.\nUse `android:showAsAction`\n. First you should enable snapshot repository:\n\n```\nholoeverywhere {\n  repository {\n    snapshot 'yes'\n  }\n  library {\n    version '2.1.1-SNAPSHOT'\n  }\n}\n```\n\nPlease describe here if it works.\n. mmm, yeah, you should also modify support version:\n\n```\nholoeverywhere {\n  ...\n  supportV4 {\n    version = '19.0.3'\n  }\n}\n```\n. In your buildscript above both repositories will attached to project.\nBut first repo doesn't have any snapshot artifacts, then if you force specify snapshot version of library will be using version from second repo.\nbtw gradle throw an exception if any unresolved dependency found, I sure that correct version of libraries using.\nYou can invoke `gradlew androidDependencies dependencies` and post output?\n. Shit. I forget `=`.\nI can success use a snapshot version for building with this config:\n\n```\nrepositories {\n     maven { url 'http://192.241.191.41/snapshot' }\n}\n\nholoeverywhere {\n  repository {\n    // Will fixed in 0.2.8 release\n    // snapshot 'yes'\n  }\n  supportV4 {\n    version = '19.0.3'\n  }\n  library {\n    version = '2.1.1-SNAPSHOT'\n  }\n  addons {\n    slider\n    preferences\n  }\n}\n```\n\nMy dependency tree looks like this:\n\n```\n:androidDependencies\ndebug\n+--- org.holoeverywhere:library:2.1.1-SNAPSHOT\n+--- org.holoeverywhere:addon-preferences:2.1.1-SNAPSHOT\n\\--- org.holoeverywhere:addon-slider:2.1.1-SNAPSHOT\n\ndebugTest\nNo dependencies\n\nrelease\n+--- org.holoeverywhere:library:2.1.1-SNAPSHOT\n+--- org.holoeverywhere:addon-preferences:2.1.1-SNAPSHOT\n\\--- org.holoeverywhere:addon-slider:2.1.1-SNAPSHOT\n```\n. btw with 0.2.8 you can safely remove custom maven repo notation and even not use a `snapshot 'yes'` option - snapshot repo active by default.\n. I did change some behavior and hadn't update wiki yet, sorry.\nReplace this:\n\n```\napply plugin: 'holoeverywhere'\napply plugin: 'android'\n```\n\nby this:\n\n```\napply plugin: 'holoeverywhere'\napply plugin: 'holoeverywhere-app'\n```\n. @8Duke8 as one more way: exclude appcompat library from your build lifecycle, HE already contains built-in appcompat variation.\n. In Plugin 0.2.10 (will available in maven central for couple hours) like this:\n\n```\nholoeverywhere {\n  signing.key 'myUniqueName'\n  // or split for build variants:\n  // signing {\n  //   release.key 'releaseName'\n  //   debug.key 'debugName'\n  // }\n}\n```\n\nThen put in ~/.gradle/gradle.properties (on Windows - C:\\Users\\<username>\\.gradle\\gradle.properties:\n\n```\nmyUniqueNameStoreFile=/full/path/to/keystore\nmyUniqueNameStorePassword=Password\nmyUniqueNameKeyAlias=Alias\nmyUniqueNameKeyPassword=Password\n```\n\nAlso you can provide this values directly in .gradle file:\n\n```\nholoeverywhere {\n  signing {\n    debug {\n      storeFile = ...\n      storePassword = ...\n      keyAlias = ...\n      keyPassword = ...\n    }\n    release {\n      ...\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n. Good news guys: you can use normal repositories:\nhttp://192.241.191.41/repo/\nhttp://192.241.191.41/snapshot/\n. Include _both_ repos for snapshot versions and _only first_ for release versions\n. Well, you can support server by donations :D Distribution of files - hard work :)\n. Artifact `android:android:4.3_r2` has been deployed to main repo.\n\n_btw holoeverywhere plugin include both repos by default_\n. Fixed with 0.2.16 release.\n. It's very funny, but holoeverywhere's widgets doesn't modify glow effect.\nAnyway I see that ViewRootImpl hold on ListView widget in internal containers, so I cannot fix this issue.\n. btw drop me apk with your backport at the end ;) \n.

No. Just you should use context with holoeverywhere's theme.\n. It's logical - you using appcompat theme, not holoeverywhere theme.\n. Then Robolectric does set theme for activity. HoloEverywhere's runtime do it only if no other theme was specified, eg you have only basic activity declaration in manifest (without theme attribute).\n\nI don't know exactly, how robolectric runs tests (i don't know even target platform for running, sorry), but it seems like robolectric's issue. \n. Did you try call supportRequestWindowFeature? And you should call it before super.onCreate, as I remember.\n. If you can find a way for doing it with DrawerLayout - then you implement this feature. If you can provide patches for this for support library - you are good guy and I'll merge it with pleasure.\n. Duplicate #704.\n. ```\nfinal Context context = this;\nint titleId = context.getResources().getIdentifier(\"action_bar_title\", \"id\", context.getPackageName());\n```\n\nAll library resources packed into application scope, so you should find resources in your application package.\n. It's feature \u00a9 someone\n\nYou can provide custom background for view with state_activated selector if you want, but currently library doesn't make it for you. End of story.\n. It's very strange - have a viewpager inside scrollview.\nHoloEverywhere hasn't modify touch behavior (only in viewpager with property swipeEnabled = false modified, but it's not related with this issue).\n\nTry to change a UX/UI of your application, I cannot help you more.\n. Bug confirmed.\n![screenshot from 2014-02-24 20 26 19](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/2245332/08bb5b32-9d4f-11e3-98e2-bc3ec69ec6f3.png)\n. O_o.\nDialogTitle extends org.holoeverywhere.widget.TextView exactly.\nWhich version of library you are using?\n. Yep, many thanks for additional info.\n. At least 70%... I'll try to finish impl in couple days.\n. I'm a lazy bastardo.\n![screenshot from 2014-03-03 16 08 41](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/2307486/2cb2ef26-a2ab-11e3-8293-51a75c7a8e83.png)\n\nBut I'll write it! :)\n. When I said basic - I mean really _basic_... I have not enough time for make it quickly, sorry.\n![screenshot from 2014-03-18 20 01 19](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1416030/2447287/1123025a-ae95-11e3-8e94-e492abb79334.png)\n. @Alexwijn yep, listview's id should be `@+id/slider_menu`, not `@android:id/list`\n. ... oh shit. Of course, I forgot about subitems :-/\nTwo ways:\n- Replace ListView with ViewStubHolo (addon automatically replace it with needed view) (but then you lose support of layout attrs) (but you can avoid this by using FrameLayout)\n- Replace ListView with ExpandableListView\n. Which errors are present? Concretize please.\n\nAnd no, no one have a _complete tutorial_ by migrating.\n. > getApplicationContext()\n\nUse activity's context instead.\n. You forgot to include `nineoldandroids` library to your final apk file.\n. HoloEverywhere doesn't provide a DatePicker anymore. But this means that native version of this widget will be using. But native DatePicker using a NumberPicker, which is still provided by library. Dilemma.\n\nSo you should use a native layout inflater (which will not override a widgets) for inflating a datepicker. Something like this:\nmain.xml:\n\n``` xml\n<LinearLayout\n  xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n  android:id=\"@+id/delete_diary_layout\"\n  android:layout_height=\"fill_parent\" \n  android:minWidth=\"200dp\"\n  android:layout_width=\"fill_parent\" android:orientation=\"vertical\">\n    <FrameLayout\n        android:id=\"@+id/date_picker_panel\"\n        android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"\n        android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\" />\n</LinearLayout>\n```\n\nmain_datepicker.xml:\n\n``` xml\n<DatePicker\n    xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n    android:id=\"@+id/date_picker\"\n    android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"\n    android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\" />\n```\n\nIn your activity:\n\n``` java\n@Override\npublic void onCreate(Bundle savedState) {\n  super.onCreate(savedState);\n  setContentView(R.layout.main);\n  android.view.LayoutInfalter nativeInflater = (android.view.LayoutInfalter) superGetSystemService(Context.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE);\n  nativeInflater.inflate(R.layout.main_datepicker, (FrameLayout) findViewById(date_picker_panel), true);\n}\n```\n. _I'd started coming back a pickers in library as module, but @BraisGabin provide a cool solution_\n. not in /my/ project, in /your/ project.\n. Please read basic guides for support library before asking.\n\n``` java\nFragmentManager fm = activity.getSupportFragmentManager();\nFragmentTransaction ft = fm.beginTransaction();\nft.add(R.id.content, new MyFragment());\nft.commit();\n```\n. For ListView and GridView using android.widget.AdapterView.OnItemClickListener for backward compatibility.\n. So, make difference: \nListView/GridView uses android.widget.AdapterView.\nSpinner uses org.holoeverywhere.widget.AdapterView, which are incompatible with native version.\n\nLeave out a holoeverywhere's imports, but for ListView use this snippet:\n\n``` java\nlistview.setOnItemClickListener(new android.widget.AdapterView.OnItemClickListener() {\n  public void onItemClick(android.widget.AdapterView<?> adapterView, View view, int position, long id) {\n    ...\n  }\n});\n```\n. Mmm... If I understand you right...\nAs usual. As with any other library. Do you use some other 3rd party libraries with your IDE?\n. Which explanations you are need? I just now tried execute steps on `Gradle` page and build some application - that's work. If you need a manual for usage this library - sorry, I have no it :-/ But you can always see a demo implementation and make similarly in your app.\n. How you include library to your project?\n. Fuck, library working everywhere! Even on Android Wear (with broken skin in round variation, i know).\n![screenshot from 2014-04-05 16 01 33](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1416030/2622239/11d93756-bc9a-11e3-8536-654b4e75d59e.png)\nI even not too lazy for searching my first android phone (se u20i, 4.1.2, ldpi, 2010 year motherfucker!):\n![2014-04-05-160900](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1416030/2622241/604c90f4-bc9a-11e3-9a60-774387d53d64.jpg)\n![2014-04-05-160946](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1416030/2622242/604e2874-bc9a-11e3-888c-3b6b23d4bb5d.jpg)\n![device-2014-04-05-161050](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1416030/2622243/70f4f3ec-bc9a-11e3-8cea-e8f4b1b2e3c9.png)\n\n_btw genymotion is shit._\n. Gradle plugin 0.9.2\n\n> Aapt-based PNG processor is now default again while we investigate some issues with the old one.\n\nI think in new versions of plugin we can keep optical bounds.\n. Use app-scope id instead (R.id.content, not android.R.id.content)\n. You tried to cast ListAdapterWrapper to your own adapter impl.\nCause is ListView an automatically wrap any adapter to ListAdapterWrapper passed to.\nSo you can use `ListView.getAdapterSource()` instead of `getAdapter()`\n. It's feature of system-ui, not applications.\nImpossible.\n. Again: it's not possible to make a status bar a transparent. Action bar - yes, but not status.\n. Create your own theme and put attrs windowTranslucentNavigation/windowTranslucentStatus = true.\nHoloEverywhere is backward-compitablity library, all features should be available for all versions.\n. Plugin version?\n\nTry to invoke `./gradlew --refresh-dependencies clean build` first.\n. Did you read a [wiki](https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/wiki/Addon:-Preference-Framework)?\n. @kkocel okay, will released into couple hours.\n. @kkocel ... or not. Plugin seems to be incompatible with latest gradle/android plugin version.\n. @ChristopheVersieux yep, one my friend already suggest me this idea :D\n. MaterialEverywhere sounds cool - let's keep brand! :)\nI have plans to provide some compability support for custom inflaters for layouts/drawables and also backport shadow effects, but I'll begin work only after final L release. And I need to go to university for now, so not too much time available for work for me. But it's great idea and I really need to realize it.\n\nAnd yeah... Fuck 2.x!\n. @ChristopheVersieux good links, thanks :)\n\nAnyway I have some plans about MaterialEverywhere, it will not a fat library as HE. I have some interest concept for now, it's awesome for me :)\n. @kkocel we will support new drawables. Plus optional drawable inflater module.\n. @kkocel that's secret ;) Soon I'll publish sources and setup repositories. Then community (and I) can develop modules for library.\n. Yep, you right, it's `holoEveruwhere` project source code.\n\n... maybe some description need for this issue? Not sure...\n. Yep, you can change this behavior by providing custom slider layout.\nOr just delete `//addons/slider/res/layout-w720dp/slider_default_layout.xml` and rebuild your app, then drawer will have no difference between phone and tablet.\n. Sometimes [wiki](https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/wiki/Addon:-Preference-Framework#i-put-custom-preference-styles-in-the-activity-theme-but-nothing-happened) can be very useful...\n. Plugin 0.3.2 released with 0.12 support.\n. @william-ferguson-au \n- Because HE's version convention is MAJOR.MINOR+1.PATCH from official Google's version.  \n  eg. HE's 19.2.0 is Google's 19.1.0. HE's 19.1.0 is Google's 19.0.0.\n- Patchset available in `support-library` branch with name `holoeverywhere.patch`\n. @william-ferguson-au And has conflicts with all other libraries which uses support-library after it.\nYou could build anything with any other patches from any version of code and push it to your own repository or even local repo. I will not publish any other versions of any components into HE's repo.\n\nBtw you could specify version as `19.+` and has always fresh version of library.\n. @rkistner _No_ many releases of HoloEverywhere ever. You could be your own version with any dependencies - license allow it ;)\n. @boonkerz Nothing, repo is temporary down. You could bind plugin to your own repo with precompiled version of library.\n. Repo is up.\n. Dupe #843\n. @ratan12\nWell... yeah.\n![screenshot from 2014-08-21 22 53 42](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1416030/3996934/97716584-293a-11e4-97da-653e94be0986.png)\n\nAre you have any issues with new repo?\n. HoloEverywhere Plugin 0.3.3 released with correct repo address.\n. Just import LayoutInflater from org.HoloEverywhere, not from android.view.\n. And... Why this in HoloEverywhere's tracker?\n. Sorry, indeed HoloEverywhere's issue, will fix in couple hours.\n. Fixed.\n. @larrymeng AutoCompleteTextView is extended EditText, so all ways for styling basic EditText applicable for ACTV too. You can colorize default blue background and apply new background for widget via styles or layout.\n. Make sure that you have latest version of Android Studio (0.8.11 for now) and latest version of library sources (b870abb for now). I've been successfully import library into studio.\n. Bots should die.\n. On the core server hard disk damage happened. I have no repo backup and may not rebuild artifacts for re-uploading.\n. So... _source code_ of library and plugin available in this repo.\n. @josemando egh... I'll try to recompile artifacts.\n. Support library recreated at version 21.1.2 (based on google's 21.0.2), build plugin is updated... Please wait.\n. I didn't said that all infrastructure is restored, wait any news.\n. ",

I have successfully migrated my app to version 1.4.\n\nDo not forget to remove any mention of the old theme from the manifest!\n. My main list activity has problems finding the \"fragment\" class. I tried the solutions that were posted here but they didn't work. https://github.com/ChristopheVersieux/HoloEverywhere/issues/127\n\nAnyone have anymore thoughts on this issue?\n. Here's one of my fragment's code.\n\n```\npackage com.example.sampleapp;\n\nimport org.holoeverywhere.ArrayAdapter;\nimport org.holoeverywhere.LayoutInflater;\nimport org.holoeverywhere.app.Fragment;\nimport org.holoeverywhere.widget.ListView;\n\nimport android.os.Bundle;\nimport android.view.View;\nimport android.view.ViewGroup;\n\npublic class Assignments extends Fragment {\n    View view;\n\n    @Override\n    public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,\n        Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        // TODO Auto-generated method stub\n        view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.assignfrag, container, false);\n        return view;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onViewCreated(View view) {\n        // TODO Auto-generated method stub\n        super.onViewCreated(view);\n        ListView listView = (ListView)  getView().findViewById(R.id.assignlist);\n        String[] values = new String[] { \"Android\", \"iPhone\", \"WindowsMobile\",\n      \"Blackberry\", \"WebOS\", \"Ubuntu\", \"Windows7\", \"Max OS X\",\n      \"Linux\", \"OS/2\" };\n\n        // First parameter - Context\n        // Second parameter - Layout for the row\n        // Third parameter - ID of the TextView to which the data is written\n        // Forth - the Array of data\n        ArrayAdapter<String> adapter = new ArrayAdapter<String>(getActivity(),\n      org.holoeverywhere.R.layout.simple_list_item_multiple_choice, org.holoeverywhere.R.id.text1, values);\n\n        // Assign adapter to ListView\n        listView.setAdapter(adapter);\n\n    }\n\n}\n```\n. nvm fixed it. they shouldn't be org.holoeverywhere.R. they should be android.R.\n. I have tried:\n-keep public class \\* extends android.view.View\n\nI have tried putting the following code in my Application class:\n    protected static void keep() {\n        LayoutInflater.remapHard(\"Internal.RecycleListView\", org.holoeverywhere.internal.AlertController.RecycleListView.class.toString());\n    }\n\nTried them both.\n\nTried  \n-keep public class \\* extends com.android.internal.app.\n\nNone worked.  Keep getting the same error as the poster.\n\nI have also tried the latest proguard statements found in the demo project, including:\n-keep public class \\* extends android.view.View {\n    public <init>(android.content.Context);\n    public <init>(android.content.Context, android.util.AttributeSet);\n    public <init>(android.content.Context, android.util.AttributeSet, int);\n    public void set_(...);\n    public void get_(...);\n}\n\nAny one get this to work?\n. I tried with class.GetName() earlier without success.\n\nI hadn't tried upgrading.  I was trying to avoid that as we are in final stages of testing.  However, when I tried, I received build errors and was unable to build the HoloEverwhere library with the following errors: \n\nPlugin execution not covered by lifecycle configuration: com.jayway.maven.plugins.android.generation2:android-maven-plugin:3.4.1:generate-sources (execution: default-generate-sources, phase: generate-sources)    pom.xml /HoloEverywhere line 58 Maven Project Build Lifecycle Mapping Problem\n\nProject 'HoloEverywhere' is missing required source folder: 'test'  HoloEverywhere      Build path  Build Path Problem\n\nSo instead of checking out 1.4.1, I left it on the Master and receive this error:\nProject build error: Non-resolvable parent POM: Failure to find org.holoeverywhere:parent:pom:1.4.2 in http://repo1.maven.org/maven2 was cached in the local repository, resolution will not be reattempted until the update interval of central has elapsed or updates are forced and 'parent.relativePath' points at wrong local POM  pom.xml /HoloEverywhere line 9  Maven pom Loading Problem\n. I got this to work with 1.4.1.  I had to delete HoloEverywhere/test from the project.  However, I still have a \"red\" x on the HoloEverywhere project as it is still has the following problem:\nPlugin execution not covered by lifecycle configuration: com.jayway.maven.plugins.android.generation2:android-maven-plugin:3.4.1:generate-sources (execution: default-generate-sources, phase: generate-sources) pom.xml /HoloEverywhere line 58 Maven Project Build Lifecycle Mapping Problem\n\nHowever, the code generates even though it looks like there is a severe error.\n. I had to use the latest master rather then the 1.4.1 branch.  As the 1.4.1 branch does not have the fix for RingTone in it.  While the master does.  As well the master project has an error:\nProject build error: Non-resolvable parent POM: Failure to find org.holoeverywhere:parent:pom:1.4.2 in http://repo1.maven.org/maven2 was cached in the local repository, resolution will not be reattempted until the update interval of central has elapsed or updates are forced and 'parent.relativePath' points at wrong local POM pom.xml /HoloEverywhere line 9 Maven pom Loading Problem\n\nWhich doesn't prevent a build.  So, everything works now...except for a strange X.  And hopefully the master is a stable version.\n. Yes, I'm using Eclipse.  And I've cleaned multiple times.  Without success.  I turned off auto-build.  And then cleaned and built.  I've left auto-build on.  Then cleaned.\n\nSame list of errors each time.\n\nI also tried to delete the Gen folder and have it rebuild.  Same errors.\n\nPeter Van Dyk\nAppstervan Software\n\npvd@Appstervan.commailto:pvd@Appstervan.com\n260-494-1760 (Work)\n260-494-5661 (Cell)\n\nhttp://www.Appstervan.com\nFollow us: @Appstervanhttp://twitter.com/@Appstervan\n\nFrom: Sergey <notifications@github.com<mailto:notifications@github.com>>\nReply-To: ChristopheVersieux/HoloEverywhere <reply@reply.github.com<mailto:reply@reply.github.com>>\nDate: Saturday, December 22, 2012 10:46 AM\nTo: ChristopheVersieux/HoloEverywhere <HoloEverywhere@noreply.github.com<mailto:HoloEverywhere@noreply.github.com>>\nCc: Peter Van Dyk <pvd@Appstervan.com<mailto:pvd@Appstervan.com>>\nSubject: Re: [HoloEverywhere] Unable to Build (#236)\n\nAre you try build in Eclipse?

Hi Sergey.\n\nNo problem, thanks for your reply, better late than never! :)\n\nFrom the <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/SharedPreferences.OnSharedPreferenceChangeListener.html\">Android Documentation:</a>\n\n```\nonSharedPreferenceChanged\nCalled when a shared preference is changed, added, or removed.\nThis may be called even if a preference is set to its existing value.\n```\n\nAs mentioned above, <b>onSharedPreferenceChanged may be called even if a preference is set to its existing value.</b> \n\nI need to call the listener in order to dynamically set the summaryOn (summary of the preference when it is checked) of a CheckBoxPreference while it is already checked.\n\nAlso, the summaryOn has to be set when something happens in another class. Therefore, first I need to commit the SharedPreferences value to true for the CheckBoxPreference in that class and then need the  OnSharedPreferenceChangeListener to be called so that the summaryOn can be set.\n\nThanks for your time, Sergey!\n\nRishit\n. I use XML.\n. Hmm, I don't know, it used to work in v1.3.\\* but when I updated to v1.4.1, it stopped working.\n. I'm sorry but what do you exactly mean by JSON or XML implementation? And how do I change to it?\n. Okay, I am not familiar with this, but I'll try and then get back to you.\n. @tmurakami where do you specify in your list that you are using the modalBackgroundWrapper?\n. Can't I just use the existing keystore and skip to step 2 with the xml editing?\n. 1) Can I use the debug keystore\n\n2) Can I put something like this as the path to my keystore?\nC:\\Users<myName>.android\\debug.keystore\n.

I don't understand why these instructions are radically different from the ones here: https://github.com/ChristopheVersieux/HoloEverywhere\n\nIs there any easier way to import HoloEverywhere like you are able to import ActionBarSherlock?\n. Well, my APK without it is 21 MB. So that's one reason why I really want to use it - to shrink my code.\n. @i906 That didn't seem to change anything for me unfortunately\n\n@Prototik Does it need to be android-16 necessarily? Because I'm using 17.\n. @Prototik I tried with android-17 and it actually removed 48 of the warnings, so thanks a lot for that. Now I just have:\n\n[2013-05-20 10:03:35 -  Proguard returned with error code 1.

Ok, thanks a lot. It exported without a problem. However, the main goal of why I used ProGuard didn't seem to really take effect - my APK is only .2 MB smaller, but is still over 21 MB. Do you have any tips on how to make it smaller? I'm pretty sure the extra bulk is from the two libraries. Essentially the only addition I have made is the line:\n\nandroid:theme=\"@style/Holo.Theme\">  \n\nin my AndroidManifest, as well as obviously referencing the two libraries in my project - this works fine, but it seems to balloon my size. Any idea?\n. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20729326/holoeverywhere-dialog-wrong-layout-sony-xperia-neo-v-2-3-x I did some hack to use relative instead linear but I am not able to fix >measureVertical< in your linearlayout, but I am sure there is something wrong with counting height. On sony I gets only itle and the rest is gone. I would need much time to fix it but it's very heavy to understand it in few hours.. `I will give you 10E if you fix it xD - ok I'm kidding :)`\n. but the class ClienteNovoPessoaisFragment must extend  SherlockFragment because it is inside a tab SherlockFragmentActivity, or am I wrong?\n\n``` java\npublic class ClienteNovoView extends SherlockFragmentActivity {\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onCreate(Bundle bundle) {        \n        setTheme(R.style.Holo_Theme);\n        super.onCreate(bundle);\n\n        getSupportActionBar().setIcon(R.drawable.back);\n        getSupportActionBar().setTitle(\"  Novo Cliente\");\n        getSupportActionBar().setHomeButtonEnabled(true);\n        getSupportActionBar().setNavigationMode(ActionBar.NAVIGATION_MODE_TABS);\n        addTab(); \n\n    }\n```\n\n``` java\nprivate class MyTabListener implements ActionBar.TabListener {\n        @Override\n        public void onTabSelected(Tab tab, FragmentTransaction ft) {\n            if(tab.getPosition()==0)            {\n                ClienteNovoPessoaisFragment frag = new ClienteNovoPessoaisFragment(clienteVO);\n                ft.replace(android.R.id.content, frag);\n            }\n            else if(tab.getPosition()==1) {\n                ClienteNovoContatoFragment frag = new ClienteNovoContatoFragment(clienteVO);\n                ft.replace(android.R.id.content, frag);             \n            }\n        }\n        @Override\n        public void onTabUnselected(Tab tab, FragmentTransaction ft) {\n\n        }\n        @Override\n        public void onTabReselected(Tab tab, FragmentTransaction ft) {\n\n        }\n    }\n```\n. Also something similar happens when I change the item from spinner (1). If you open any other tab (2) and back again (3), the listview loads.\n\nI saw a similar problem with the issue https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/issues/185, but did not solve my problem.\n![spinner](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4734045/726433/7bdbb6ea-e0f6-11e2-8adb-4abf6f03cbc9.png)\n.

This reminds me of my situation months ago, always getting this error when configuring projects. If you don't mind using maven, just go the maven way. Gradle made lots of changes on library management every now and then.\n\nYou can actually use maven inside your build.gradle to get HoloEverywhere compiled into an aar file for Android Studio.\n\n```\nrepositories {\n    mavenCentral()\n    maven {\n        url \"http://192.241.191.41/repo/\"\n    }\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    compile 'com.android.support:support-v4:19.0.+'\n    //compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:19.0.+'\n    compile 'com.nineoldandroids:library:2.4.+@jar'\n    compile 'org.holoeverywhere:library:2.1.+@aar'\n    compile 'org.holoeverywhere:addon-preferences:2.1.+@aar'\n    compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar', '*.aar'])\n}\n```\n.

Can you check that you don't have two .JAR files that include the same package and classes in your build path, because that might causes the error 1. Try to solve this by cleaning the project -  Go to Project -> Clean -> Clean projects selected below -> select your project and click OK. Hope this works for you.\n. That is what I have...here is a snippet of what I have:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<PreferenceScreen xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\" >\n\n```\n<PreferenceCategory\n    android:key=\"settings\"\n    android:title=\"Settings\" >\n    <EditTextPreference\n        android:defaultValue=\"25\"\n        android:dialogMessage=\"Number to fetch.\"\n        android:dialogTitle=\"Number to Fetch\"\n        android:key=\"emailsToFetch\"\n        android:maxLength=\"2\"\n        android:numeric=\"integer\"\n        android:singleLine=\"true\"\n        android:summary=\"Number to Fetch\"\n        android:title=\"Number to Fetch\" />\n\n    <CheckBoxPreference\n        android:defaultValue=\"true\"\n        android:key=\"showDate\"\n        android:title=\"Show Date\" />\n\n    <Preference\n        android:key=\"Data\"\n        android:summary=\"Enter Data\"\n        android:title=\"Email Data\" />\n</PreferenceCategory>\n<PreferenceCategory\n    android:key=\"other_settings\"\n    android:title=\"Other Settings\" >\n    <CheckBoxPreference\n        android:defaultValue=\"true\"\n        android:key=\"enableStuff\"\n        android:title=\"Stuff\" />\n\n    <RingtonePreference\n        android:dependency=\"enableStuff\"\n        android:key=\"stuffSound\"\n        android:ringtoneType=\"notification\"\n        android:showDefault=\"true\"\n        android:showSilent=\"true\"\n        android:summary=\"Select  Sound\"\n        android:title=\"Sound\" />\n\n    <app.Appstervan.TimePreference\n        android:name=\"Start time\"\n        android:dependency=\"notiStuff\"\n        android:dialogLayout=\"@layout/time_preference\"\n        android:key=\"notiStartTime\"\n        android:summary=\"\"\n        android:title=\"Start notification time\" />\n</PreferenceCategory>\n```\n\n</PreferenceScreen>\n. Thanks for the tip.  I did look at the demo, but obviously not very well.  Next time I'll search!  Have a great weekend...\n. I have successfully migrated my app to version 1.4.\n\nDo not forget to remove any mention of the old theme from the manifest!\n. My main list activity has problems finding the \"fragment\" class. I tried the solutions that were posted here but they didn't work. https://github.com/ChristopheVersieux/HoloEverywhere/issues/127\n\nAnyone have anymore thoughts on this issue?\n. Here's one of my fragment's code.\n\n```\npackage com.example.sampleapp;\n\nimport org.holoeverywhere.ArrayAdapter;\nimport org.holoeverywhere.LayoutInflater;\nimport org.holoeverywhere.app.Fragment;\nimport org.holoeverywhere.widget.ListView;\n\nimport android.os.Bundle;\nimport android.view.View;\nimport android.view.ViewGroup;\n\npublic class Assignments extends Fragment {\n    View view;\n\n    @Override\n    public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,\n        Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        // TODO Auto-generated method stub\n        view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.assignfrag, container, false);\n        return view;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onViewCreated(View view) {\n        // TODO Auto-generated method stub\n        super.onViewCreated(view);\n        ListView listView = (ListView)  getView().findViewById(R.id.assignlist);\n        String[] values = new String[] { \"Android\", \"iPhone\", \"WindowsMobile\",\n      \"Blackberry\", \"WebOS\", \"Ubuntu\", \"Windows7\", \"Max OS X\",\n      \"Linux\", \"OS/2\" };\n\n        // First parameter - Context\n        // Second parameter - Layout for the row\n        // Third parameter - ID of the TextView to which the data is written\n        // Forth - the Array of data\n        ArrayAdapter<String> adapter = new ArrayAdapter<String>(getActivity(),\n      org.holoeverywhere.R.layout.simple_list_item_multiple_choice, org.holoeverywhere.R.id.text1, values);\n\n        // Assign adapter to ListView\n        listView.setAdapter(adapter);\n\n    }\n\n}\n```\n. nvm fixed it. they shouldn't be org.holoeverywhere.R. they should be android.R.\n. I have tried:\n-keep public class \\* extends android.view.View\n\nI have tried putting the following code in my Application class:\n    protected static void keep() {\n        LayoutInflater.remapHard(\"Internal.RecycleListView\", org.holoeverywhere.internal.AlertController.RecycleListView.class.toString());\n    }\n\nTried them both.\n\nTried  \n-keep public class \\* extends com.android.internal.app.\n\nNone worked.  Keep getting the same error as the poster.\n\nI have also tried the latest proguard statements found in the demo project, including:\n-keep public class \\* extends android.view.View {\n    public <init>(android.content.Context);\n    public <init>(android.content.Context, android.util.AttributeSet);\n    public <init>(android.content.Context, android.util.AttributeSet, int);\n    public void set_(...);\n    public void get_(...);\n}\n\nAny one get this to work?\n. I tried with class.GetName() earlier without success.\n\nI hadn't tried upgrading.  I was trying to avoid that as we are in final stages of testing.  However, when I tried, I received build errors and was unable to build the HoloEverwhere library with the following errors: \n\nPlugin execution not covered by lifecycle configuration: com.jayway.maven.plugins.android.generation2:android-maven-plugin:3.4.1:generate-sources (execution: default-generate-sources, phase: generate-sources)    pom.xml /HoloEverywhere line 58 Maven Project Build Lifecycle Mapping Problem\n\nProject 'HoloEverywhere' is missing required source folder: 'test'  HoloEverywhere      Build path  Build Path Problem\n\nSo instead of checking out 1.4.1, I left it on the Master and receive this error:\nProject build error: Non-resolvable parent POM: Failure to find org.holoeverywhere:parent:pom:1.4.2 in http://repo1.maven.org/maven2 was cached in the local repository, resolution will not be reattempted until the update interval of central has elapsed or updates are forced and 'parent.relativePath' points at wrong local POM  pom.xml /HoloEverywhere line 9  Maven pom Loading Problem\n. I got this to work with 1.4.1.  I had to delete HoloEverywhere/test from the project.  However, I still have a \"red\" x on the HoloEverywhere project as it is still has the following problem:\nPlugin execution not covered by lifecycle configuration: com.jayway.maven.plugins.android.generation2:android-maven-plugin:3.4.1:generate-sources (execution: default-generate-sources, phase: generate-sources) pom.xml /HoloEverywhere line 58 Maven Project Build Lifecycle Mapping Problem\n\nHowever, the code generates even though it looks like there is a severe error.\n. I had to use the latest master rather then the 1.4.1 branch.  As the 1.4.1 branch does not have the fix for RingTone in it.  While the master does.  As well the master project has an error:\nProject build error: Non-resolvable parent POM: Failure to find org.holoeverywhere:parent:pom:1.4.2 in http://repo1.maven.org/maven2 was cached in the local repository, resolution will not be reattempted until the update interval of central has elapsed or updates are forced and 'parent.relativePath' points at wrong local POM pom.xml /HoloEverywhere line 9 Maven pom Loading Problem\n\nWhich doesn't prevent a build.  So, everything works now...except for a strange X.  And hopefully the master is a stable version.\n. Yes, I'm using Eclipse.  And I've cleaned multiple times.  Without success.  I turned off auto-build.  And then cleaned and built.  I've left auto-build on.  Then cleaned.\n\nSame list of errors each time.\n\nI also tried to delete the Gen folder and have it rebuild.  Same errors.\n\nPeter Van Dyk\nAppstervan Software\n\npvd@Appstervan.commailto:pvd@Appstervan.com\n260-494-1760 (Work)\n260-494-5661 (Cell)\n\nhttp://www.Appstervan.com\nFollow us: @Appstervanhttp://twitter.com/@Appstervan\n\nFrom: Sergey <notifications@github.com<mailto:notifications@github.com>>\nReply-To: ChristopheVersieux/HoloEverywhere <reply@reply.github.com<mailto:reply@reply.github.com>>\nDate: Saturday, December 22, 2012 10:46 AM\nTo: ChristopheVersieux/HoloEverywhere <HoloEverywhere@noreply.github.com<mailto:HoloEverywhere@noreply.github.com>>\nCc: Peter Van Dyk <pvd@Appstervan.com<mailto:pvd@Appstervan.com>>\nSubject: Re: [HoloEverywhere] Unable to Build (#236)\n\nAre you try build in Eclipse?

Hi Sergey.\n\nNo problem, thanks for your reply, better late than never! :)\n\nFrom the <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/SharedPreferences.OnSharedPreferenceChangeListener.html\">Android Documentation:</a>\n\n```\nonSharedPreferenceChanged\nCalled when a shared preference is changed, added, or removed.\nThis may be called even if a preference is set to its existing value.\n```\n\nAs mentioned above, <b>onSharedPreferenceChanged may be called even if a preference is set to its existing value.</b> \n\nI need to call the listener in order to dynamically set the summaryOn (summary of the preference when it is checked) of a CheckBoxPreference while it is already checked.\n\nAlso, the summaryOn has to be set when something happens in another class. Therefore, first I need to commit the SharedPreferences value to true for the CheckBoxPreference in that class and then need the  OnSharedPreferenceChangeListener to be called so that the summaryOn can be set.\n\nThanks for your time, Sergey!\n\nRishit\n. I use XML.\n. Hmm, I don't know, it used to work in v1.3.\\* but when I updated to v1.4.1, it stopped working.\n. I'm sorry but what do you exactly mean by JSON or XML implementation? And how do I change to it?\n. Okay, I am not familiar with this, but I'll try and then get back to you.\n. @tmurakami where do you specify in your list that you are using the modalBackgroundWrapper?\n. Can't I just use the existing keystore and skip to step 2 with the xml editing?\n. 1) Can I use the debug keystore\n\n2) Can I put something like this as the path to my keystore?\nC:\\Users<myName>.android\\debug.keystore\n. Where do I do this step?\n\ncd HoloEverywhere\nmvn clean install\n. I received this. Better than last time I suppose.\n\nSLF4J: Failed to load class \"org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder\".\nSLF4J: Defaulting to no-operation (NOP) logger implementation\nSLF4J: See http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#StaticLoggerBinder for further details.\n[INFO] Scanning for projects...\n[INFO]  \n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[INFO] Building HoloEverywhere Library 1.4.2\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[INFO] \n[INFO] --- maven-clean-plugin:2.4.1:clean (default-clean) @ library ---\n[INFO] Deleting C:\\Users\\Akhil\\HoloEverywhere\\library\\target\n[INFO] \n[INFO] --- maven-enforcer-plugin:1.0:enforce (enforce-maven) @ library ---\n[INFO] \n[INFO] --- builder:1.4.2:build (default) @ library ---\n[INFO] \n[INFO] Compile styles.json => C:\\Users\\Akhil\\HoloEverywhere\\library\\res\\values\\styles.xml\n[INFO] \n[INFO] Compile styles-v14.json => C:\\Users\\Akhil\\HoloEverywhere\\library\\res\\values-v14\\styles.xml\n[INFO] \n[INFO] \n[INFO] --- translator:1.4.2:build (default) @ library ---\n[ERROR] Platform path for version 16 not found: C:\\Users\\Akhil\\Downloads\\Development\\adt-bundle-windows-x86\\adt-bundle-windows-x86\\sdk\\platforms\\android-16\n[INFO] \n[INFO] --- android-maven-plugin:3.5.0:generate-sources (default-generate-sources) @ library ---\n[DEBUG] Expanding: C:\\Users\\Akhil.m2\\repository\\com\\actionbarsherlock\\actionbarsherlock\\4.2.0\\actionbarsherlock-4.2.0.apklib into C:\\Users\\Akhil\\HoloEverywhere\\library\\target\\unpack\\apklibs\\com.actionbarsherlock_actionbarsherlock_apklib_4.2.0\n[DEBUG] expand complete\n[INFO] ANDROID-904-002: Found aidl files: Count = 0\n[INFO] ANDROID-904-002: Found aidl files: Count = 0\n[INFO] ANDROID-904-002: Found aidl files: Count = 0\n[INFO] Manifest merging disabled.

Ok, thanks a lot. It exported without a problem. However, the main goal of why I used ProGuard didn't seem to really take effect - my APK is only .2 MB smaller, but is still over 21 MB. Do you have any tips on how to make it smaller? I'm pretty sure the extra bulk is from the two libraries. Essentially the only addition I have made is the line:\n\nandroid:theme=\"@style/Holo.Theme\">  \n\nin my AndroidManifest, as well as obviously referencing the two libraries in my project - this works fine, but it seems to balloon my size. Any idea?\n. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20729326/holoeverywhere-dialog-wrong-layout-sony-xperia-neo-v-2-3-x I did some hack to use relative instead linear but I am not able to fix >measureVertical< in your linearlayout, but I am sure there is something wrong with counting height.

I would need much time to fix it but it's very heavy to understand it in few hours.. `I will give you 10E if you fix it xD - ok I'm kidding :)`\n. but the class ClienteNovoPessoaisFragment must extend  SherlockFragment because it is inside a tab SherlockFragmentActivity, or am I wrong?\n\n``` java\npublic class ClienteNovoView extends SherlockFragmentActivity {\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onCreate(Bundle bundle) {        \n        setTheme(R.style.Holo_Theme);\n        super.onCreate(bundle);\n\n        getSupportActionBar().setIcon(R.drawable.back);\n        getSupportActionBar().setTitle(\"  Novo Cliente\");\n        getSupportActionBar().setHomeButtonEnabled(true);\n        getSupportActionBar().setNavigationMode(ActionBar.NAVIGATION_MODE_TABS);\n        addTab(); \n\n    }\n```\n\n``` java\nprivate class MyTabListener implements ActionBar.TabListener {\n        @Override\n        public void onTabSelected(Tab tab, FragmentTransaction ft) {\n            if(tab.getPosition()==0)            {\n                ClienteNovoPessoaisFragment frag = new ClienteNovoPessoaisFragment(clienteVO);\n                ft.replace(android.R.id.content, frag);\n            }\n            else if(tab.getPosition()==1) {\n                ClienteNovoContatoFragment frag = new ClienteNovoContatoFragment(clienteVO);\n                ft.replace(android.R.id.content, frag);             \n            }\n        }\n        @Override\n        public void onTabUnselected(Tab tab, FragmentTransaction ft) {\n\n        }\n        @Override\n        public void onTabReselected(Tab tab, FragmentTransaction ft) {\n\n        }\n    }\n```\n.

I am also getting:\n\nE/AndroidRuntime(32760): java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to start activity ComponentInfo{com.pocketwriters/com.pocketwriters.ReaderActivity}: java.lang.ClassCastException: android.widget.LinearLayout\n\n[.....]\n\nE/AndroidRuntime(32760): Caused by: java.lang.ClassCastException: android.widget.LinearLayout\nE/AndroidRuntime(32760):    at com.WazaBe.HoloEverywhere.internal.AlertController.setupView(AlertController.java:720)\nE/AndroidRuntime(32760):    at com.WazaBe.HoloEverywhere.internal.AlertController.installContent(AlertController.java:449)\nE/AndroidRuntime(32760):    at com.WazaBe.HoloEverywhere.app.AlertDialog.onCreate(AlertDialog.java:352)\nE/AndroidRuntime(32760):    at com.WazaBe.HoloEverywhere.app.ProgressDialog.onCreate(ProgressDialog.java:215)\nE/AndroidRuntime(32760):    at android.app.Dialog.dispatchOnCreate(Dialog.java:319)\nE/AndroidRuntime(32760):    at android.app.Dialog.show(Dialog.java:237)\nE/AndroidRuntime(32760):    at com.WazaBe.HoloEverywhere.app.ProgressDialog.show(ProgressDialog.java:49)\nE/AndroidRuntime(32760):    at com.WazaBe.HoloEverywhere.app.ProgressDialog.show(ProgressDialog.java:37)\nE/AndroidRuntime(32760):    at com.pocketwriters.tasks.ChapterLoaderTask.onPreExecute(ChapterLoaderTask.java:110)\nE/AndroidRuntime(32760):    at android.os.AsyncTask.execute(AsyncTask.java:391)\nE/AndroidRuntime(32760):    at com.pocketwriters.ReaderActivity.onCreate(ReaderActivity.java:68)\nE/AndroidRuntime(32760):    at android.app.Instrumentation.callActivityOnCreate(Instrumentation.java:1047)\nE/AndroidRuntime(32760):    at android.app.ActivityThread.performLaunchActivity(ActivityThread.java:1615)\n. Just noticed (I'm using the dev branch BTW), that this is effecting the Preference activity dialogs I'm creating, so this is obviously related to a fairly recent change in the code as we got these working perfectly a couple of weeks ago.\n. You will be sorely missed. Hope it's nothing serious.\n. I don't know if this logcat message is of note:\n\nCould not find method android.content.SharedPreferences$Editor.putStringSet, referenced from method com.WazaBe.HoloEverywhere.internal.BaseSharedPreferences$BaseEditor.putStringSet\n. No idea, the 4.0 emulator crashes my Mac and I'm away from the PC I can run it on ATM.\n\nHowever, I've rewritten a lot of code to use the HoloEverywhere MultiSelectListPreference instead (so now it completely relies on H.E. and no custom components in use) - and exactly the same thing happens!  \n. Can I ask why this has been closed as it is a bug that exists and appears to be related to H.E.?\n. I've also tried this on 4.1 emulator now, and the same bug still exists.\n. This is not a 3rd party implementation - this is a bug with HoloEverywhere!\n. ``` xml\n<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8' standalone='yes' ?>\n<map>\n<string name=\"genre\">[&quot;3&quot;,&quot;2&quot;,&quot;10&quot;,&quot;1&quot;,&quot;7&quot;,&quot;6&quot;,&quot;5&quot;,&quot;4&quot;,&quot;9&quot;,&quot;8&quot;,&quot;11&quot;,&quot;12&quot;]</string>\n<string name=\"pref_ui_theme\">red</string>\n<boolean name=\"notif_active\" value=\"true\" />\n<string name=\"language\">[&quot;eng&quot;]</string>\n<string name=\"pref_ui_tabs\">[&quot;history&quot;,&quot;draft&quot;,&quot;new&quot;,&quot;classic&quot;,&quot;popular&quot;]</string>\n<boolean name=\"adult\" value=\"true\" />\n</map>\n```\n\nI'm going to presume that the event isn't working it's way down (or up, if you prefer) from the checkbox item to the preference itself.\n. How would I go about checking that??  It's certainly not working on the latest version on the dev branch.\n. _Phew_ - That took a bit of code modification \n\nHowever I can confirm that it DOES work with 1.2.4 - though other aspects of my project do break as I was using the SeekBar component elsewhere(!).  But hopefully this will help locate the issue.\n. It's on the dev branch, most recent push.\n\nIt's extending com.WazaBe.HoloEverywhere.preference.ListPreference\n. Oddly I just took the .ListPreferenceMultiSelect out of the XML and it still fails on ICS\n\nE/AndroidRuntime( 1709): FATAL EXCEPTION: main\nE/AndroidRuntime( 1709): android.view.InflateException:

Right I just took paired the preferencex.xml down to:\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<PreferenceScreen xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n    xmlns:holo=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto\" >\n\n```\n<PreferenceCategory\n    holo:key=\"pref_about_legal\"\n    holo:title=\"@string/legal\" >\n    <Preference\n        holo:key=\"privacy\"\n        holo:title=\"@string/privacy\" />\n    <Preference\n        holo:key=\"terms\"\n        holo:title=\"@string/terms_and_conditions\" />\n</PreferenceCategory>\n```\n\n</PreferenceScreen>\n\nAnd it still fails to launch - which it did before I moved over to the holo namespace.\n\nThe theme is a custom one extending @style/Holo.Theme.Sherlock.Light.DarkActionBar - ahhh, can you give me a couple of minutes I may have an explanation - just want to run a quick test!\n. I think it's a non-error. I have the paired down version working and it was to do with the theme.  Eclipse had helpfully added v-11 and v-14 theme overrides for me which hadn't been updated, so when I changed NS I assume that broke everything.\n\n---\n\nYep, the Activity will now launch thanks to the theme change.  But we now have an additional error.  I'll post the logcat in a second....\n. OK, so the SPreferenceActivity will now launch - which is a good thing.\n\nHowever, when I click on either of the ListPreferences I crash again. This is the trace from the first standard ListPreference:\n\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737): FATAL EXCEPTION: main\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737): android.view.InflateException: Binary XML file line #100: Error inflating class <unknown>\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at android.view.LayoutInflater.createView(LayoutInflater.java:613)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at com.WazaBe.HoloEverywhere.LayoutInflater.onCreateView(LayoutInflater.java:139)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at android.view.LayoutInflater.onCreateView(LayoutInflater.java:660)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at android.view.LayoutInflater.createViewFromTag(LayoutInflater.java:685)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at android.view.LayoutInflater.rInflate(LayoutInflater.java:746)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at android.view.LayoutInflater.rInflate(LayoutInflater.java:749)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at android.view.LayoutInflater.rInflate(LayoutInflater.java:749)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at android.view.LayoutInflater.inflate(LayoutInflater.java:489)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at android.view.LayoutInflater.inflate(LayoutInflater.java:396)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at android.view.LayoutInflater.inflate(LayoutInflater.java:352)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at com.android.internal.policy.impl.PhoneWindow.setContentView(PhoneWindow.java:256)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at com.WazaBe.HoloEverywhere.internal.AlertController.installContent(AlertController.java:451)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at com.WazaBe.HoloEverywhere.app.AlertDialog.onCreate(AlertDialog.java:340)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at android.app.Dialog.dispatchOnCreate(Dialog.java:351)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at android.app.Dialog.show(Dialog.java:256)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at com.WazaBe.HoloEverywhere.preference.DialogPreference.showDialog(DialogPreference.java:275)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at com.WazaBe.HoloEverywhere.preference.DialogPreference.onClick(DialogPreference.java:147)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at com.WazaBe.HoloEverywhere.preference.Preference.performClick(Preference.java:535)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at com.WazaBe.HoloEverywhere.preference.PreferenceScreen.onItemClick(PreferenceScreen.java:105)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at android.widget.AdapterView.performItemClick(AdapterView.java:298)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at android.widget.AbsListView.performItemClick(AbsListView.java:1086)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at android.widget.AbsListView$PerformClick.run(AbsListView.java:2855)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at android.widget.AbsListView$1.run(AbsListView.java:3529)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at android.os.Handler.handleCallback(Handler.java:615)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:92)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:137)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at android.app.ActivityThread.main(ActivityThread.java:4745)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNative(Native Method)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:511)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit$MethodAndArgsCaller.run(ZygoteInit.java:786)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.main(ZygoteInit.java:553)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at dalvik.system.NativeStart.main(Native Method)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737): Caused by: java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at java.lang.reflect.Constructor.constructNative(Native Method)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at java.lang.reflect.Constructor.newInstance(Constructor.java:417)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at android.view.LayoutInflater.createView(LayoutInflater.java:587)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        ... 31 more\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737): Caused by: android.content.res.Resources$NotFoundException: Resource is not a Drawable (color or path): TypedValue{t=0x2/d=0x7f010067 a=2}\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at android.content.res.Resources.loadDrawable(Resources.java:1892)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at android.content.res.TypedArray.getDrawable(TypedArray.java:601)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at android.view.View.<init>(View.java:3336)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at android.widget.TextView.<init>(TextView.java:447)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at android.widget.Button.<init>(Button.java:107)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        at android.widget.Button.<init>(Button.java:103)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 2737):        ... 34 more\nW/ActivityManager(  157):   Force finishing activity com.pocketwriters/.SettingsActivity\n.

It's certainly not working on the latest version on the dev branch.\n. _Phew_ - That took a bit of code modification \n\nHowever I can confirm that it DOES work with 1.2.4 - though other aspects of my project do break as I was using the SeekBar component elsewhere(!).  But hopefully this will help locate the issue.\n. ",

Hmmm it's not building for me: http://nopaste.info/d5c9d78e8a.html\n. I am not even trying to build my OWN project, I just tried to build the HE library project.\nWhat do I need to do to make it work again?\n. I have replaced all my sources with the sources from the dev branch, yes!\n\nThe manifest file looks like this:\n\n``` xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<manifest xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n    package=\"org.holoeverywhere\"\n    android:versionCode=\"22\"\n    android:versionName=\"1.3.4\" >\n    <uses-sdk\n        android:minSdkVersion=\"7\"\n        android:targetSdkVersion=\"16\" />\n</manifest>\n```\n\nWhich is definitely the one from the dev branch, so I have no idea what I am doing wrong?\n\nI will check out the files once again and try to compile again.\n. Yeah you were right, quite a mess of old and new source files mixed together, the library is compiling fine now! :)\nYou mentioned SActivity doesn't exist anymore, what do I need to use instead?\n\nAt the moment I am using `com.WazaBe.HoloEverywhere.sherlock.SActivity` and `com.WazaBe.HoloEverywhere.sherlock.SListActivity`, guess I need to change that to `org.holoeverywhere.app.Activity` and `org.holoeverywhere.app.ListActivity`, right?\n. Okay thanks, everything is working now :)\nWill test the popup menu tomorrow and report back if it works!\n. Popup menus are working like a charm man, thanks! :)\n. Is there a style that I can apply to my TextView so it looks like the default text on a HoloEverywhere ImageButton?\n. Is that only for the text appearance or will my whole TextView look like a Button then (with background, etc)?\n. And what do I need to apply when I just want the text appearance of a button and NOT the rest like background and so on?\n\nI am using a LinearLayout with `style=\"?borderlessButtonStyle\"` and inside that LinearLayout is one ImageView and one TextView.\nI already got the ImageView right but can't find the attribute I need to apply to the TextView so it looks like the text on a button?\n. Or can I just use `?android:buttonStyle` together with an explicitely set transparent background?\n. Thanks a lot :+1:\n.

May be @JackeWharton could give us an opinion about it.\n\nBTW, I think it should be wrapped from ActionBarSherlock rather than from HoloEverywhere, as it is a closer layer to the wrapper of android support library v4.\n. HoloEverywhere by itself doesn't, but you can use https://github.com/JakeWharton/ActionBarSherlock-Plugin-Maps that  gives support to MapActivity.\n\nThe thing is that you can't use a MapView inside a Fragment because when it detaches the fragment's layout (e.g. changing among tabs) the MapView is leaked (remains attached to it's parent view). So when you try to attach the fragment again you get a runtimeexception related to only being able to have one MapView per MapActivity.\n\nAs a workaround, I kept the instance of the MapView inside the instance of the Fragment. When the onCreate() is called I saved the instance, and when the onCreateView() is called I made an addView() to the rootView. Then, in onDestroyView() y did removeView() of the MapView instance from it's parent.\n. Good news. New maps api was released 4 days ago as part of Google Play Services v2. Therefore, extending from MapActivity is no longer needed to hold a MapView. You just have to extend from Activity as usual, and use the new MapFragment.\n\nGiven this, the issue may be closed if MapFragment is fully supported.\n\nMore info:\n- http://android-developers.blogspot.com.br/2012/12/new-google-maps-android-api-now-part-of.html.\n- https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#getting_the_google_maps_android_api_v2\n. @Prototik, sorry I didin't know the pull request were delivered to dev branch. My bad.\n\nRegarding your comments:\n- Harcoded api version looks like Magic Numbers. That's why it smells bad.\n- styles.xml version that is commited has wrong format. With maven compilation phase it is re-formated. If it is intended no to be edited by human because the real style (and other xml files) is in styles.json and is generated in compile time, then I wouldn't version these files.\n. Ok. I will include it in their poms.\n. How about using https://github.com/mosabua/maven-android-sdk-deployer to deploy locally last support version? This way we would not need to add a new project.\n\n```\n<dependency>\n  <groupId>android.support</groupId>\n  <artifactId>compatibility-v13</artifactId>\n  <version>11</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n.

Then, in onDestroyView() y did removeView() of the MapView instance from it's parent.\n. Good news. New maps api was released 4 days ago as part of Google Play Services v2. Therefore, extending from MapActivity is no longer needed to hold a MapView. You just have to extend from Activity as usual, and use the new MapFragment.\n\nGiven this, the issue may be closed if MapFragment is fully supported.\n\nMore info:\n- http://android-developers.blogspot.com.br/2012/12/new-google-maps-android-api-now-part-of.html.\n- https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#getting_the_google_maps_android_api_v2\n. @Prototik, sorry I didin't know the pull request were delivered to dev branch. My bad.\n\nRegarding your comments:\n- Harcoded api version looks like Magic Numbers. That's why it smells bad.\n- styles.xml version that is commited has wrong format. With maven compilation phase it is re-formated. If it is intended no to be edited by human because the real style (and other xml files) is in styles.json and is generated in compile time, then I wouldn't version these files.\n. Ok. I will include it in their poms.\n. How about using https://github.com/mosabua/maven-android-sdk-deployer to deploy locally last support version? This way we would not need to add a new project.\n\n```\n<dependency>\n  <groupId>android.support</groupId>\n  <artifactId>compatibility-v13</artifactId>\n  <version>11</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n.

    "4nd3250n": "I too face the same problem. There is no clear documentation. Application launch on eclipse takes about 5 minutes so blind guessing is an awful waste of time.\n\nIt would be most welcomed to know how one sets and changes the theme for the application in runtime.\n\nAs far as I could gather is:\nTo change a theme of an activity use restartWithTheme (Activity, int);\nBut how does one change a theme application wide? All I have tried with ThemeManager produces an error.\nWhat does the ThemeManager.setDefaultMethod() do?\nWhat does the annotation @Holo(forceThemeApply = true) do? Black box guessing tells me nothing, but I am sure it must do something in the background.\n\nWould it be possible to write at least some mini minimal documentation?\n\nWhat I am doing is which bring me partial result is:\nIn every activity in onCreate() event I check what is the theme stored in the preferences. And then I do simple checks:\nif (stringInPreferences.equals(\"Dark\") setTheme(R.style.ThemeHoloDark);\nif((stringInPreferences.equals(\"Light\") setTheme(R.style.ThemeHoloDark);\nThemes in that case are descendants from Holo.Theme.Dark.\n\nHow does one remove title bar which is visible above Action bar. I thought ThemeManager.modifyTheme(ThemeManager.FULLSCREEN) woudl do. But that does nothing. How does one use that correctly.\n\nThis is a lot of questions, but it is really frustrating to keep guessing blindly.\n. This same issue is present in version 1.6.8.\n. This is a common. What is the cause?\n. What version has the bug fixed? I use 1.3.3 and have the same problem.\n. I traced the unexpected behaviour to some leftover code in one of the event handler.\nI am sorry to take you a few minutes of your life.\n. Bumping this one up as we still do not have an answer.\n. What i figured via black box testing, AS THERE IS NO DOCUMENTATION, which is a real issue is:\nYou cannot change a theme on an application level. You have to do it individually in for each activity.\nAnother complicatin is that you cannot use SharedPreferences as there is no way to init them to some default value.\nSo you have to find a way to persist and init your settings.\nAnd in some cases you must be carefull which context are you using. Application context does not necesarilly carry all the information an activity context does.\n. Can it be that you are trying to mix interface android.content.ContextWrapper with interface com.WazaBe.HoloEverywhere.app.Base.\nThey both have the abstract method getSharedPreferences(java.lang.String,int), yet those two abstract methods return different ypes. Former one returns android.content.SharedPreferences while the latter one one returns com.WazaBe.HoloEverywhere.preference.SharedPreferences.\n\nI think this might be tracked down to using wrong import. \n. Hmmm,\n\nAt first I thought it might be so.\nI had an activity, inside a view pager which held a ListView. ListView items were inflated from a xml layout file. The problem was that TextView inside an item did not have correct color. It turned out I was pass application context instead of activity context. The question still remains how to correctly change theme of an application at runtime? Right now I am doing it in each activity separately in onCreate() event. \n\nBottom line: apart from the question about theme setting this issue can be deleted.\n. Could you provide a snippet of your code. Or even better a minimum working code that exhibits this behavior?\n. In the mean time you can check one thing:\nChange the \"schema declaration\" to:\nxmlns:holo=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto\"\nChange all attribute name prefixes from android to holo.\nFor detail see:\nhttps://github.com/ChristopheVersieux/HoloEverywhere/blob/master/demo/res/xml/preferences.xml\n\nReport the result.\n. Any news about the issue? This one is urgent as it breaks the application behavior..\n. How does one apply the fix?\n. What build targer are you using? It might be you are compiling against newer API. When you run on the older device the class that was there at compile time might now exist.\nAlso... a good practice is to run clean after modifying xml files.\n. What other imports are you using? code snippet?\n. Well... it just might be that in your xml file you are refering to class fragment (lowercase letter f). I think it should be Fragment, which is a correct class name.\n\n``` xml\n<Fragment\n        android:id=\"@+id/stateFragment\"\n        android:name=\"com.jbl.android.spotimote.StateMgr.StateFragment\"\n        android:layout_width=\"fill_parent\"\n        android:layout_height=\"fill_parent\"\n        android:layout_weight=\"1\" >\n\n     <!-- Preview: layout=@layout/state_fragment -->\n</Fragment>\n```\n. Too bad. This is a useful feature of android 4.0+.\n. What should one use then to indicate that a View was selected for Contextual Action Bar ?\n. In the meantime I have tested this a bit further and now it seams tha transitions do not work for LinearLayout background.\n. No. It does not work either. No transition. Just color change.\nIf one looks:\n\n``` xml\n<item name=\"selectableItemBackground\">@drawable/item_background_holo_light</item>\n```\n\nit uses the same drawable as android:attr/listSelector.\n. Not solved. Please reopen.\n. This issue is still not resolved !\n\nPrototik suggested:\n\n>    Try to use @drawable/list_selector_background_transition_holo_dark\n\nThis is not a solution. The background is blue, but IT DOES NOT CHANGE when setSelected() method is invocated.\n\nI would like to add that after 9 month the matter is URGENT.\nAt least a definite answer if this is at least possible?\n. Check with debugger what is the value of variable bar.\nStack trace would be helpfull also.\nCheck if you are using correct theme so that ActionBar is created in the first place.\n. Go through with debugger and see if any theme gets set. I am guessing here but it is a strong guess there is something wrong with your theme.\nAs far as ThemeManager goes... I do not use it. I have my own pattern. But it would be nice to know more about ThemeManager (wink wink).\n. Well... I guess there is a null pointer where it shouldn't be.\nWhat is yourcom.monzonito.xxxx.Home.onCreate() method? Go through it with a debugger.\n. Which line causes the exception?\n. Notice taken. I thought this was not the case and comments on closed issues are essentially lost. My mistake.\n. Source of ListView adapter?\n. I disagree. A simple LinearLayout inside ListView with default selector does not respond to setSelected(), niether setChecked().\nIt does work on its own though. In other issue about nine months ago I described that, but nothing until know. Issue was simply closed without resolution.\n. Yet, we still do not have an answer. And this is critical UI issue.\n. @croemmich Thank you very much for a completely useless comment. You do not have to state the obvious. Take it as a good natured advice.\nMy previous comment was related to the fact that issues around this subject appear to be closed yet there is no solution. I do not like the idea of workaround on such a basic feature and I think I am not the only one.\n. Which activity, which xml? What exactly is wrong?\n. Could you please explain how this works behind the scenes? How is this achieved to use android namespace prefix?\n. Regarding this issue I would politely like to ask something.\nIn android  documentation it is stated that the preferred method of using DatePickerDialog (in regular android) is to extend DialogFragment and wrap DatePickerDialog inside it. (source: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/controls/pickers.html#TimePickerFragment)\n\nHowever in HoloEverywhere, as stated in this topic, you have extended DatiPickerDialog from DialogFragment. Is there a reason behind it?\nThe usage as far as I could get it is to extend DatePickerDialog as this one is in itself already extended from fragment. How to initialize it I haven't figured yet. Wouldn't it be then more intuitive to name DatePickerDialog to something like DatePickerDialogFragment?\n\nFor information I have included packages and hierarchies of DatePickerDialog class in both Android and HoloEverywhere.\n\nAndroid\n\n```\nPackage\nandroid.app.DatePickerDialog.OnDateSetListener\n\nHierarchy\nandroid.app.Dialog\n    android.app.AlertDialog\n        android.app.DatePickerDialog\n```\n\nHoloEverywhere\n\n```\nPackage\norg.holoeverywhere.widget.datetimepicker.date.DatePickerDialog\n\nHierarchy\nandroid.support.v4.app._HoloFragment\n    org.holoeverywhere.app.Fragment\n        org.holoeverywhere.app.DialogFragment\n            org.holoeverywhere.widget.datetimepicker.date.DatePickerDialog\n```\n\nWhat bothers is that there is no parallel between android and holoeverywhere classes. This is not useful for making use of regular android patterns and documentation. Such parallelism makes it a lot easier to convert an application to holoeverywhere and to convert it back to regular android in the future, when there are few enough older devices.\nBut I guess holoeverywhere will support android 7.x look an 4.y devices by then.\n. I have installed release for fix 723. After this there is an error unrelated to spinner. I think it has to do somethibg with support library used.\n\n```\n112-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603): FATAL EXCEPTION: main\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603): java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: android.support.v4.view.ViewCompatGingerbread\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.support.v4.view.ViewCompat$GBViewCompatImpl.getOverScrollMode(ViewCompat.java:406)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.support.v4.view.ViewCompat.getOverScrollMode(ViewCompat.java:628)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.support.v4.view.ViewPager.draw(ViewPager.java:2174)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.view.ViewGroup.drawChild(ViewGroup.java:1646)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.view.ViewGroup.dispatchDraw(ViewGroup.java:1373)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.view.View.draw(View.java:6936)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.view.ViewGroup.drawChild(ViewGroup.java:1646)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.view.ViewGroup.dispatchDraw(ViewGroup.java:1373)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.view.ViewGroup.drawChild(ViewGroup.java:1644)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.view.ViewGroup.dispatchDraw(ViewGroup.java:1373)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.view.ViewGroup.drawChild(ViewGroup.java:1644)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.view.ViewGroup.dispatchDraw(ViewGroup.java:1373)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.view.View.draw(View.java:6936)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.view.ViewGroup.drawChild(ViewGroup.java:1646)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.view.ViewGroup.dispatchDraw(ViewGroup.java:1373)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.view.ViewGroup.drawChild(ViewGroup.java:1644)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.view.ViewGroup.dispatchDraw(ViewGroup.java:1373)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.view.View.draw(View.java:6936)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.widget.FrameLayout.draw(FrameLayout.java:357)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at com.android.internal.policy.impl.PhoneWindow$DecorView.draw(PhoneWindow.java:1917)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.view.ViewRoot.draw(ViewRoot.java:1530)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.view.ViewRoot.performTraversals(ViewRoot.java:1266)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.view.ViewRoot.handleMessage(ViewRoot.java:1868)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:99)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:130)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.app.ActivityThread.main(ActivityThread.java:3691)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNative(Native Method)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:507)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit$MethodAndArgsCaller.run(ZygoteInit.java:907)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.main(ZygoteInit.java:665)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at dalvik.system.NativeStart.main(Native Method)\n12-15 10:16:56.006: I/Process(1603): Sending signal.

Could you give some pointers what should I check?\nEDIT: Perhaps I should add that I am running it on 2.3.5 device.\n. Is there a trick to compiling this?\nI have tried every possible permutation in Properties -> java Build Path. No result.\n. Since I think this is related to what I appended to issue #723 I will post this here.

Could it be that because class android.support.v4.view.ViewCompatGingerbread (or others with similar problem) is not declared public and somehow doesn't make it to runtime classpath?\n. Has anybody, anybody managed to get around this NoClassDeddFoundException? This is becoming urgent.\nHow about going back to support 18.0.2?\n. My logcat is here:\nhttps://app.box.com/s/y8hfc2vexxmel8ntqkgr\nDevice SGS II, android 2.3.5.\n. I confirm josear's solution. One has to restart eclipse.\nDamn, and I checked SDK Manager a few days ago and somehow missed the build tools.\n. http://stackoverflow.com/a/15519711/1087411\nhttp://www.vogella.com/articles/AndroidActionBar/article.html#actionbar_dynamic\n. Yes I did.\nMy custom theme was:\n\n```\n<style name=\"ThemeCustom\" parent=\"Holo.Theme.Light.DarkActionBar.Fullscreen\">\n\u2026\n    <item name=\"android:checkboxStyle\">@style/Holo.CompoundButton.CheckBox.Custom</item>\n    <item name=\"android:checkBoxPreferenceStyle\">@style/Holo.CompoundButton.CheckBox.Custom</item>\n\u2026\n</style>\n```\n\nThese Holo.CompoundButton.CheckBox.Custom have different drawables. Everything else is the same. When I use this theme on my preference activity nothing is changed. The normal holo checkbox is used, not my custom drawables.\n\nUpon closer look I added following line into my theme:\n\n```\n<item name=\"preferenceTheme\">@style/ThemeCustom</item> <!-- application theme -->\n```\n\nThis had the effect that the backround selectin color changed and that the CheckBoxed dissapearad completely.\nA liitle more insight how is the preference screen styled would be beneficial.\n. Did anybody succeed in doing this?\n. Aaarrgh. It would be nice for a few loose ends to be sorted out.\nBut any way:\nTHANK YOU ALL FOR A GREAT JOB ! ! !\n. And how is the style switchStyleOld defined?\n. I too face the same problem. There is no clear documentation. Application launch on eclipse takes about 5 minutes so blind guessing is an awful waste of time.\n\nIt would be most welcomed to know how one sets and changes the theme for the application in runtime.\n\nAs far as I could gather is:\nTo change a theme of an activity use restartWithTheme (Activity, int);\nBut how does one change a theme application wide? All I have tried with ThemeManager produces an error.\nWhat does the ThemeManager.setDefaultMethod() do?\nWhat does the annotation @Holo(forceThemeApply = true) do? Black box guessing tells me nothing, but I am sure it must do something in the background.\n\nWould it be possible to write at least some mini minimal documentation?\n\nWhat I am doing is which bring me partial result is:\nIn every activity in onCreate() event I check what is the theme stored in the preferences. And then I do simple checks:\nif (stringInPreferences.equals(\"Dark\") setTheme(R.style.ThemeHoloDark);\nif((stringInPreferences.equals(\"Light\") setTheme(R.style.ThemeHoloDark);\nThemes in that case are descendants from Holo.Theme.Dark.\n\nHow does one remove title bar which is visible above Action bar. I thought ThemeManager.modifyTheme(ThemeManager.FULLSCREEN) woudl do. But that does nothing. How does one use that correctly.\n\nThis is a lot of questions, but it is really frustrating to keep guessing blindly.\n. This same issue is present in version 1.6.8.\n. This is a common. What is the cause?\n. What version has the bug fixed? I use 1.3.3 and have the same problem.\n. I traced the unexpected behaviour to some leftover code in one of the event handler.\nI am sorry to take you a few minutes of your life.\n. Bumping this one up as we still do not have an answer.\n. What i figured via black box testing, AS THERE IS NO DOCUMENTATION, which is a real issue is:\nYou cannot change a theme on an application level. You have to do it individually in for each activity.\nAnother complicatin is that you cannot use SharedPreferences as there is no way to init them to some default value.\nSo you have to find a way to persist and init your settings.\nAnd in some cases you must be carefull which context are you using. Application context does not necesarilly carry all the information an activity context does.\n. Can it be that you are trying to mix interface android.content.ContextWrapper with interface com.WazaBe.HoloEverywhere.app.Base.\nThey both have the abstract method getSharedPreferences(java.lang.String,int), yet those two abstract methods return different ypes. Former one returns android.content.SharedPreferences while the latter one one returns com.WazaBe.HoloEverywhere.preference.SharedPreferences.\n\nI think this might be tracked down to using wrong import. \n. Hmmm,\n\nAt first I thought it might be so.\nI had an activity, inside a view pager which held a ListView. ListView items were inflated from a xml layout file. The problem was that TextView inside an item did not have correct color. It turned out I was pass application context instead of activity context. The question still remains how to correctly change theme of an application at runtime? Right now I am doing it in each activity separately in onCreate() event. \n\nBottom line: apart from the question about theme setting this issue can be deleted.\n. Could you provide a snippet of your code. Or even better a minimum working code that exhibits this behavior?\n. In the mean time you can check one thing:\nChange the \"schema declaration\" to:\nxmlns:holo=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto\"\nChange all attribute name prefixes from android to holo.\nFor detail see:\nhttps://github.com/ChristopheVersieux/HoloEverywhere/blob/master/demo/res/xml/preferences.xml\n\nReport the result.\n. Any news about the issue? This one is urgent as it breaks the application behavior..\n. How does one apply the fix?\n. What build targer are you using? It might be you are compiling against newer API. When you run on the older device the class that was there at compile time might now exist.\nAlso... a good practice is to run clean after modifying xml files.\n. What other imports are you using? code snippet?\n. Well... it just might be that in your xml file you are refering to class fragment (lowercase letter f). I think it should be Fragment, which is a correct class name.\n\n``` xml\n<Fragment\n        android:id=\"@+id/stateFragment\"\n        android:name=\"com.jbl.android.spotimote.StateMgr.StateFragment\"\n        android:layout_width=\"fill_parent\"\n        android:layout_height=\"fill_parent\"\n        android:layout_weight=\"1\" >\n\n     <!-- Preview: layout=@layout/state_fragment -->\n</Fragment>\n```\n. Too bad. This is a useful feature of android 4.0+.\n. What should one use then to indicate that a View was selected for Contextual Action Bar ?\n. In the meantime I have tested this a bit further and now it seams tha transitions do not work for LinearLayout background.\n. No. It does not work either. No transition. Just color change.\nIf one looks:\n\n``` xml\n<item name=\"selectableItemBackground\">@drawable/item_background_holo_light</item>\n```\n\nit uses the same drawable as android:attr/listSelector.\n. Not solved. Please reopen.\n. This issue is still not resolved !\n\nPrototik suggested:\n\n>    Try to use @drawable/list_selector_background_transition_holo_dark\n\nThis is not a solution. The background is blue, but IT DOES NOT CHANGE when setSelected() method is invocated.\n\nI would like to add that after 9 month the matter is URGENT.\nAt least a definite answer if this is at least possible?\n. Check with debugger what is the value of variable bar.\nStack trace would be helpfull also.\nCheck if you are using correct theme so that ActionBar is created in the first place.\n. Go through with debugger and see if any theme gets set. I am guessing here but it is a strong guess there is something wrong with your theme.\nAs far as ThemeManager goes... I do not use it. I have my own pattern. But it would be nice to know more about ThemeManager (wink wink).\n. Well... I guess there is a null pointer where it shouldn't be.\nWhat is yourcom.monzonito.xxxx.Home.onCreate() method? Go through it with a debugger.\n. Which line causes the exception?\n. Notice taken. I thought this was not the case and comments on closed issues are essentially lost. My mistake.\n. Source of ListView adapter?\n. I disagree. A simple LinearLayout inside ListView with default selector does not respond to setSelected(), niether setChecked().\nIt does work on its own though. In other issue about nine months ago I described that, but nothing until know. Issue was simply closed without resolution.\n. Yet, we still do not have an answer. And this is critical UI issue.\n. @croemmich Thank you very much for a completely useless comment. You do not have to state the obvious. Take it as a good natured advice.\nMy previous comment was related to the fact that issues around this subject appear to be closed yet there is no solution. I do not like the idea of workaround on such a basic feature and I think I am not the only one.\n. Which activity, which xml? What exactly is wrong?\n. Could you please explain how this works behind the scenes? How is this achieved to use android namespace prefix?\n. Regarding this issue I would politely like to ask something.\nIn android  documentation it is stated that the preferred method of using DatePickerDialog (in regular android) is to extend DialogFragment and wrap DatePickerDialog inside it. (source: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/controls/pickers.html#TimePickerFragment)\n\nHowever in HoloEverywhere, as stated in this topic, you have extended DatiPickerDialog from DialogFragment. Is there a reason behind it?\nThe usage as far as I could get it is to extend DatePickerDialog as this one is in itself already extended from fragment. How to initialize it I haven't figured yet. Wouldn't it be then more intuitive to name DatePickerDialog to something like DatePickerDialogFragment?\n\nFor information I have included packages and hierarchies of DatePickerDialog class in both Android and HoloEverywhere.\n\nAndroid\n\n```\nPackage\nandroid.app.DatePickerDialog.OnDateSetListener\n\nHierarchy\nandroid.app.Dialog\n    android.app.AlertDialog\n        android.app.DatePickerDialog\n```\n\nHoloEverywhere\n\n```\nPackage\norg.holoeverywhere.widget.datetimepicker.date.DatePickerDialog\n\nHierarchy\nandroid.support.v4.app._HoloFragment\n    org.holoeverywhere.app.Fragment\n        org.holoeverywhere.app.DialogFragment\n            org.holoeverywhere.widget.datetimepicker.date.DatePickerDialog\n```\n\nWhat bothers is that there is no parallel between android and holoeverywhere classes. This is not useful for making use of regular android patterns and documentation. Such parallelism makes it a lot easier to convert an application to holoeverywhere and to convert it back to regular android in the future, when there are few enough older devices.\nBut I guess holoeverywhere will support android 7.x look an 4.y devices by then.\n. I have installed release for fix 723. After this there is an error unrelated to spinner. I think it has to do somethibg with support library used.\n\n```\n112-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603): FATAL EXCEPTION: main\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603): java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: android.support.v4.view.ViewCompatGingerbread\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.support.v4.view.ViewCompat$GBViewCompatImpl.getOverScrollMode(ViewCompat.java:406)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.support.v4.view.ViewCompat.getOverScrollMode(ViewCompat.java:628)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.support.v4.view.ViewPager.draw(ViewPager.java:2174)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.view.ViewGroup.drawChild(ViewGroup.java:1646)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.view.ViewGroup.dispatchDraw(ViewGroup.java:1373)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.view.View.draw(View.java:6936)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.view.ViewGroup.drawChild(ViewGroup.java:1646)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.view.ViewGroup.dispatchDraw(ViewGroup.java:1373)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.view.ViewGroup.drawChild(ViewGroup.java:1644)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.view.ViewGroup.dispatchDraw(ViewGroup.java:1373)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.view.ViewGroup.drawChild(ViewGroup.java:1644)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.view.ViewGroup.dispatchDraw(ViewGroup.java:1373)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.view.View.draw(View.java:6936)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.view.ViewGroup.drawChild(ViewGroup.java:1646)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.view.ViewGroup.dispatchDraw(ViewGroup.java:1373)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.view.ViewGroup.drawChild(ViewGroup.java:1644)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.view.ViewGroup.dispatchDraw(ViewGroup.java:1373)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.view.View.draw(View.java:6936)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.widget.FrameLayout.draw(FrameLayout.java:357)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at com.android.internal.policy.impl.PhoneWindow$DecorView.draw(PhoneWindow.java:1917)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.view.ViewRoot.draw(ViewRoot.java:1530)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.view.ViewRoot.performTraversals(ViewRoot.java:1266)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.view.ViewRoot.handleMessage(ViewRoot.java:1868)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:99)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:130)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at android.app.ActivityThread.main(ActivityThread.java:3691)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNative(Native Method)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:507)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit$MethodAndArgsCaller.run(ZygoteInit.java:907)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.main(ZygoteInit.java:665)\n12-15 10:16:47.382: E/AndroidRuntime(1603):     at dalvik.system.NativeStart.main(Native Method)\n12-15 10:16:56.006: I/Process(1603): Sending signal.

Could you give some pointers what should I check?\nEDIT: Perhaps I should add that I am running it on 2.3.5 device.\n. Is there a trick to compiling this?\nI have tried every possible permutation in Properties -> java Build Path. No result.\n. Since I think this is related to what I appended to issue #723 I will post this here.

Could it be that because class android.support.v4.view.ViewCompatGingerbread (or others with similar problem) is not declared public and somehow doesn't make it to runtime classpath?\n.

One has to restart eclipse.\nDamn, and I checked SDK Manager a few days ago and somehow missed the build tools.\n. http://stackoverflow.com/a/15519711/1087411\nhttp://www.vogella.com/articles/AndroidActionBar/article.html#actionbar_dynamic\n. Yes I did.\nMy custom theme was:\n\n```\n<style name=\"ThemeCustom\" parent=\"Holo.Theme.Light.DarkActionBar.Fullscreen\">\n\u2026\n    <item name=\"android:checkboxStyle\">@style/Holo.CompoundButton.CheckBox.Custom</item>\n    <item name=\"android:checkBoxPreferenceStyle\">@style/Holo.CompoundButton.CheckBox.Custom</item>\n\u2026\n</style>\n```\n\nThese Holo.CompoundButton.CheckBox.Custom have different drawables. Everything else is the same. When I use this theme on my preference activity nothing is changed. The normal holo checkbox is used, not my custom drawables.\n\nUpon closer look I added following line into my theme:\n\n```\n<item name=\"preferenceTheme\">@style/ThemeCustom</item> <!-- application theme -->\n```\n\nThis had the effect that the backround selectin color changed and that the CheckBoxed dissapearad completely.\nA liitle more insight how is the preference screen styled would be beneficial.\n. Did anybody succeed in doing this?\n. Aaarrgh. It would be nice for a few loose ends to be sorted out.\nBut any way:\nTHANK YOU ALL FOR A GREAT JOB ! ! !\n. And how is the style switchStyleOld defined?\n. ",

As i thought. Its just a bit wierd to mark this method as public ))\n\nIf u dont mind could u explain how to use show/replace in pair with hide? For example:\n\n``` java\nprivate void showProgressDialog(final int msgId) {\n        if (null == progressDialog) {\n            progressDialog = new ProgressDialog(msgId);\n        }\n\n        final FragmentManager fm = getSupportFragmentManager();\n        progressDialog.replace(fm, fm.beginTransaction());\n    }\n\n    private void hideProgressDialog() {\n        final FragmentManager fm = getSupportFragmentManager();\n        progressDialog.hide(fm, fm.beginTransaction());\n    }\n```\n\nI have such methods. First method works fine but second doesn't hide dialog... i dunno whats wrong here...\n. Dialog:\n\n``` java\npublic static class AccountDialog extends DialogFragment\n            implements DialogInterface.OnClickListener, DialogInterface.OnKeyListener {\n        private Account[] accounts;\n\n        static AccountDialog newInstance(final Account[] accounts) {\n            final AccountDialog dialog = new AccountDialog();\n\n            Bundle args = new Bundle();\n            args.putParcelableArray(\"accounts\", accounts);\n            dialog.setArguments(args);\n\n            return dialog;\n        }\n\n        public AccountDialog() {}\n\n        @Override\n        public Dialog onCreateDialog(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n            super.onCreateDialog(savedInstanceState);\n\n            accounts = (Account[]) getArguments().getParcelableArray(\"accounts\");\n            if (null == accounts && null != savedInstanceState) {\n                accounts = (Account[]) savedInstanceState.getParcelableArray(\"accounts\");\n            }\n\n            final Activity activity = getSupportActivity();\n            final AccountAdapter adapter = new AccountAdapter(activity, accounts);\n\n            return new AlertDialog.Builder(activity)\n                    .setTitle(R.string.titleChooseAccountToLogin)\n                    .setSingleChoiceItems(adapter, -1, AccountDialog.this)\n                    .setCancelable(false)\n                    .setOnKeyListener(AccountDialog.this)\n                    .setNeutralButton(R.string.addAccount, AccountDialog.this)\n                    .create();\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public void onSaveInstanceState(Bundle outState) {\n            super.onSaveInstanceState(outState);\n\n            outState.putParcelableArray(\"accounts\", accounts);\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public void onClick(DialogInterface dialogInterface, int i) {\n            final MainActivity activity = ((MainActivity) getSupportActivity());\n            if (i == DialogInterface.BUTTON_NEUTRAL) {\n                activity.addAccount();\n            } else {\n                activity.beginAuthentication(accounts[i]);\n            }\n\n            this.dismiss();\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public boolean onKey(DialogInterface dialogInterface, int i, KeyEvent keyEvent) {\n            getSupportActivity().finish();\n\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nUsing: \n\n``` java\nprivate void showChooseAccountDialog() {\n        final AccountDialog dialog = AccountDialog.newInstance(accountManager.getAccountsByType(accountType));\n        dialog.show(this);\n    }\n```\n\naddAccount opens AuthenticatorActivity. After then I press \"back\":\n\n``` java\nprivate void addAccount() {\n        accountManager.addAccount(accountType, null, null, null, this,\n                new AccountManagerCallback<Bundle>() {\n                    @Override\n                    public void run(AccountManagerFuture<Bundle> bundleAccountManagerFuture) {\n                        try {\n                            final Bundle result = bundleAccountManagerFuture.getResult();\n                            final Account account = new Account(\n                                    result.getString(AccountManager.KEY_ACCOUNT_NAME),\n                                    result.getString(AccountManager.KEY_ACCOUNT_TYPE));\n                            beginAuthentication(account);\n                        } catch (OperationCanceledException e) {\n                            initSession();\n                        } catch (IOException e) {\n                            e.printStackTrace();\n                        } catch (AuthenticatorException e) {\n                            e.printStackTrace();\n                        }\n                    }\n                }, null);\n    }\n```\n\nInitSession opens AccountDialog again via showChooseAccountDialog().\n\nException throws instead of opening dialog.\n. http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=17787\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/10114324/show-dialogfragment-from-onactivityresult\n\nIts a known bug. In my project I will be using workaround solution until bug is fixed.\n. Thx it works.

Hi, I think there is still this issue if I try inflate custom DialogFragment with another fragment in it's layout (google map fragment):\nThis is layout for LocationFragment that extends DialogFragment (fragment_location.xml):\n\n``` xml\n<RelativeLayout xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n    xmlns:tools=\"http://schemas.android.com/tools\"\n    android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n    android:layout_height=\"match_parent\" >\n\n    <AutoCompleteTextView\n        android:id=\"@+id/locSearchTextView1\"\n        android:layout_width=\"fill_parent\"\n        android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n        android:layout_alignParentTop=\"true\"\n        android:hint=\"Search for location\"\n        android:singleLine=\"true\"\n        android:imeOptions=\"actionSearch\">\n\n        <requestFocus />\n    </AutoCompleteTextView>\n<!-- REMOVING FRAGMENT BELOW MAKES ALL WORK OK -->\n    <fragment \n    xmlns:tools=\"http://schemas.android.com/tools\"\n        xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n        android:id=\"@+id/mapview\"\n        android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n        android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n        android:layout_alignParentLeft=\"true\"\n        android:layout_below=\"@+id/locSearchTextView1\"\n        class=\"com.google.android.gms.maps.SupportMapFragment\"\n         /> \n</RelativeLayout>\n```\n\nin LocationFragment class:\n\n``` java\n@Override\n    public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState) {  \n        View rootView = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_location, container, false); // <---- HERE EXCEPTION\n//etc....\n```\n\nActivity that opens dilaog:\n\n``` java\n\n        FragmentManager fm = getSupportFragmentManager();\n        FragmentTransaction ft = fm.beginTransaction();\n        LocationFragment locFragment = new LocationFragment();\n        locFragment.show(fm, ft);\n\n```\n\nUsing latest trunk.\n.

I have migrated two apps to 1.4 with no issues so far. Great work!\n. Attempting to update another app - getting ClassCastException on CheckedTextView when used in a layout file.\n\nThe layoutinflater chokes on it - looks like a bad dimension somewhere.\n\nI using this layout file: android.R.layout.simple_list_item_multiple_choice\n\nI copied the file into my project just to be sure, still fails with the stack trace below.\n\nIf I view the layout in the ADT with the HE theme applied, I get errors that indicate the attributes used in the widget are missing from the theme.\n\nandroid:layout_height=\"?android:attr/listPreferredItemHeight\"\nandroid:gravity=\"center_vertical\"\nandroid:paddingLeft=\"?android:attr/listPreferredItemPaddingLeft\"\nandroid:paddingRight=\"?android:attr/listPreferredItemPaddingRight\"\nandroid:textAppearance=\"?android:attr/textAppearanceListItem\" />\n. @Prototik Getting closer...\n\nThe HE theme is missing these two attribute definitions:\n\nCouldn't find theme resource listPreferredItemPaddingLeft for the current theme\nCouldn't find theme resource listPreferredItemPaddingRight for the current theme\n\"?listPreferredItemPaddingLeft\" in attribute \"paddingLeft\" is not a valid format.\n\"?listPreferredItemPaddingRight\" in attribute \"paddingRight\" is not a valid format.\n\nAdd those attributes and then I think the simple_list_item_***\\* layouts will work.\n. @Prototik thanks for the list item fix, looks beautiful.\n\nnew issue - this test case below is crashing:\n\n@Override\npublic void onCreateContextMenu(ContextMenu menu, View v,\n        ContextMenuInfo menuInfo) {\n    getMenuInflater().inflate(R.menu.song_context_menu, menu);\n}\n\n@Override\npublic boolean onContextItemSelected(MenuItem item) {\n    AdapterView.AdapterContextMenuInfo menuInfo = (AdapterContextMenuInfo) item.getMenuInfo(); // fails here\n    Toast.makeText(getActivity(), String.valueOf(menuInfo.position), Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();\n\n```\nreturn true;\n```\n\n}\n\nI'm getting a ClassCastException on the AdapterContextMenuInfo\n11-17 08:43:04.569: E/AndroidRuntime(18932): java.lang.ClassCastException: android.widget.AdapterView$AdapterContextMenuInfo\n\nI have these imports:\nimport org.holoeverywhere.widget.AdapterView;\nimport org.holoeverywhere.widget.AdapterView.AdapterContextMenuInfo;\nimport android.view.ContextMenu.ContextMenuInfo;\nimport com.actionbarsherlock.view.ContextMenu;\nimport com.actionbarsherlock.view.MenuItem;\n\nThe context menu displays fine, but when I select something in the menu, it crashes.\n. @Prototik Thank you, that worked... I just assumed that since it was available in HE, that it was the one I was supposed to use. I'll try all the options in the future before reporting an issue.\n. Yes, I know...that's why I check the type with a call to instanceof before casting.\n\nThe list preference uses simple_list_item_single_choice.xml for its layout which has a CheckedTextView as the root view. That could be why the view.findViewById() call returns null - there isn't a child view at all.\n\nIt is very strange. I was able to reproduce it on two devices though - one running 4.03 (Asus) and one running 3.1 (Motorola Xoom).\n. Yes, sorry, that is correct. However, the select_dialog_single_choice.xml file is a virtual copy of the simple_list_item_single_choice.xml.\n\nThey both have a CheckedTextView as the view root, therefore, my point is the same.\n\nI'll submit the stacktrace when I get into the office. I'll have to pull out the change to get it to happen again.\n. As requested:\n\nThis was on an emulator running 3.2\n\nMy original post describes why.\n\n11-21 07:46:37.095: E/AndroidRuntime(405): FATAL EXCEPTION: main\n11-21 07:46:37.095: E/AndroidRuntime(405):

Attempting to update another app - getting ClassCastException on CheckedTextView when used in a layout file.\n\nThe layoutinflater chokes on it - looks like a bad dimension somewhere.\n\nI using this layout file: android.R.layout.simple_list_item_multiple_choice\n\nI copied the file into my project just to be sure, still fails with the stack trace below.\n\nIf I view the layout in the ADT with the HE theme applied, I get errors that indicate the attributes used in the widget are missing from the theme.\n\nandroid:layout_height=\"?android:attr/listPreferredItemHeight\"\nandroid:gravity=\"center_vertical\"\nandroid:paddingLeft=\"?android:attr/listPreferredItemPaddingLeft\"\nandroid:paddingRight=\"?android:attr/listPreferredItemPaddingRight\"\nandroid:textAppearance=\"?android:attr/textAppearanceListItem\" />\n. @Prototik Getting closer...\n\nThe HE theme is missing these two attribute definitions:\n\nCouldn't find theme resource listPreferredItemPaddingLeft for the current theme\nCouldn't find theme resource listPreferredItemPaddingRight for the current theme\n\"?listPreferredItemPaddingLeft\" in attribute \"paddingLeft\" is not a valid format.\n\"?listPreferredItemPaddingRight\" in attribute \"paddingRight\" is not a valid format.\n\nAdd those attributes and then I think the simple_list_item_***\\* layouts will work.\n. @Prototik thanks for the list item fix, looks beautiful.\n\nnew issue - this test case below is crashing:\n\n@Override\npublic void onCreateContextMenu(ContextMenu menu, View v,\n        ContextMenuInfo menuInfo) {\n    getMenuInflater().inflate(R.menu.song_context_menu, menu);\n}\n\n@Override\npublic boolean onContextItemSelected(MenuItem item) {\n    AdapterView.AdapterContextMenuInfo menuInfo = (AdapterContextMenuInfo) item.getMenuInfo(); // fails here\n    Toast.makeText(getActivity(), String.valueOf(menuInfo.position), Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();\n\n```\nreturn true;\n```\n\n}\n\nI'm getting a ClassCastException on the AdapterContextMenuInfo\n11-17 08:43:04.569: E/AndroidRuntime(18932): java.lang.ClassCastException: android.widget.AdapterView$AdapterContextMenuInfo\n\nI have these imports:\nimport org.holoeverywhere.widget.AdapterView;\nimport org.holoeverywhere.widget.AdapterView.AdapterContextMenuInfo;\nimport android.view.ContextMenu.ContextMenuInfo;\nimport com.actionbarsherlock.view.ContextMenu;\nimport com.actionbarsherlock.view.MenuItem;\n\nThe context menu displays fine, but when I select something in the menu, it crashes.\n. @Prototik Thank you, that worked... I just assumed that since it was available in HE, that it was the one I was supposed to use. I'll try all the options in the future before reporting an issue.\n. Yes, I know...that's why I check the type with a call to instanceof before casting.\n\nThe list preference uses simple_list_item_single_choice.xml for its layout which has a CheckedTextView as the root view. That could be why the view.findViewById() call returns null - there isn't a child view at all.\n\nIt is very strange. I was able to reproduce it on two devices though - one running 4.03 (Asus) and one running 3.1 (Motorola Xoom).\n. Yes, sorry, that is correct. However, the select_dialog_single_choice.xml file is a virtual copy of the simple_list_item_single_choice.xml.\n\nThey both have a CheckedTextView as the view root, therefore, my point is the same.\n\nI'll submit the stacktrace when I get into the office. I'll have to pull out the change to get it to happen again.\n. As requested:\n\nThis was on an emulator running 3.2\n\nMy original post describes why.\n\n11-21 07:46:37.095: E/AndroidRuntime(405): FATAL EXCEPTION: main\n11-21 07:46:37.095: E/AndroidRuntime(405):

This still seems not to be fixed with fa59aa3.\n\nSame behaviour like before:\n- Working an Galaxy S (Android 2.3.6).\n- Not working on Nexus 4 (Android 4.2.2).\n\nI pushed a little quick'n'dirty test-project to github:   https://github.com/reneph/heDropdownTest\n. Found out, that this bug has been introduced with commit 2e17fae0d235c7811369b6c235f12f9d3e787f06 (Fix #358).\n\nThere you added\n< item name=\"android:itemBackground\">?selectableItemBackground< /item>\nto styles-v14.\n\nOverriding android:itemBackground in my theme with desired selector is working fine now...\n. With this fix I now get this kind of reports:\n\n<pre><code>java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to start activity ComponentInfo{com.mypackage/com.mypackage.preferences.Preference_Activity}: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Wrong state class -- expecting Preference State\nat android.app.ActivityThread.performLaunchActivity(ActivityThread.java:2185)\nat android.app.ActivityThread.handleLaunchActivity(ActivityThread.java:2210)\nat android.app.ActivityThread.access$600(ActivityThread.java:142)\nat android.app.ActivityThread$H.handleMessage(ActivityThread.java:1208)\nat android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:99)\nat android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:137)\nat android.app.ActivityThread.main(ActivityThread.java:4931)\nat java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNative(Native Method)\nat java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:511)\nat com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit$MethodAndArgsCaller.run(ZygoteInit.java:791)\nat com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.main(ZygoteInit.java:558)\nat dalvik.system.NativeStart.main(Native Method)\nCaused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Wrong state class -- expecting Preference State\nat org.holoeverywhere.preference.Preference.onRestoreInstanceState(Unknown Source)\nat org.holoeverywhere.preference.PreferenceScreen.onRestoreInstanceState(Unknown Source)\nat org.holoeverywhere.preference.Preference.dispatchRestoreInstanceState(Unknown Source)\nat org.holoeverywhere.preference.PreferenceGroup.dispatchRestoreInstanceState(Unknown Source)\nat org.holoeverywhere.preference.PreferenceGroup.dispatchRestoreInstanceState(Unknown Source)\nat org.holoeverywhere.preference.PreferenceGroup.dispatchRestoreInstanceState(Unknown Source)\nat org.holoeverywhere.preference.Preference.restoreHierarchyState(Unknown Source)\nat org.holoeverywhere.preference.PreferenceActivity.onRestoreInstanceState(Unknown Source)\nat android.app.Activity.performRestoreInstanceState(Activity.java:900)\nat android.app.Instrumentation.callActivityOnRestoreInstanceState(Instrumentation.java:1130)\nat android.app.ActivityThread.performLaunchActivity(ActivityThread.java:2153)\n... 11 more</code></pre>\n. Found out, that this has nothing to do with MY preference layout (of course, I can post it if really needed, but I dont think so).\n\nThis bug occurs when app has been killed in background (like when OS killed it due to low memory conditions). This can be forced and reproduced with the HoloEverywhere Demo as well:\n1. Start HE-Demo\n2. Go to Settings\n3. Do sth. to kill app in background (tried it with going into Systemsettings -> Apps -> Running -> Cached Processes -> Holoeverywhere Demo -> Stop)\n4. Go back to HE-Demo\n\n-> Logcat shows same like I posted above\n. Same here.\n\nSome days ago I created this issue: https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/issues/449\n\nAfter the fix of issue 449 it just seems, that the changes just prevented throwing exceptions but not fixed the base problem.\n. Yeah yeah, but people are reporting their issues here not for fun or to annoy you...\n\nBut I found probably the problem:\nI simply copied all fonts from the demo-projects raw-folder and noticed: if I put roboto_black.ttf AND roboto_blackitalic.ttf to the raw-folder, then the bold-style is screwed. By deleting one or both of them resolves the problem and the text is bold again...\n. +1\nHave some (only a few!) crash reports with pretty the same stacktrace, too. But cant reproduce...\n. ",

I have to sorry about that. The issue cause was that the strings.xml had 2 occurrence of my title. Second was wrong.\n. I understand this. But in the fragment menu i have only one menu item. But i see that parent menu items processed twice and have duplicates\n. @Prototik can you please reopen this?\n. I've tested with ABS only and it works correct. Here is the project link\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/37011471/Openphoto/P1121_DynamicActionBar_ABS_Only.zip\n\nThen i've added Holoeverywhere support and all become to work as reported in the issue. Parent menu items get duplicated\nHere the link is to the project which demonstrates the issue\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/37011471/Openphoto/P1121_DynamicActionBar_Holoeverywher.zip\n. But why it works properly in ABS and in the standard android actionbar?\n. DialogFragment with the view inflated from xml in the onCreateView method\n. In the styles i have defined custom style inherited from Holo.Theme.Dialog.Light\n\n``` xml\n<style name=\"Theme.OpenPhoto.Dialog.Light\" parent=\"Holo.Theme.Dialog.Light\">\n```\n\nIn the DialogFragment.onCreate i have code like this\n\n``` java\nsetStyle(STYLE_NORMAL, R.style.Theme_OpenPhoto_Dialog_Light);\n```\n. Tested it a little bit more on 2.1 and 2.3.3 emulators. First tests give good results.\n. I've found that org.holoeverywhere.app.Dialog.checkWindowSizes method causing the problem. If i comment its content the dialog looks properly. I don't know what exactly causing problem there but i hope it will help you to find the real cause. However as you can see title doesn't appear on 2.1 and it appears on 4.0.3\n![](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/37011471/Openphoto/device-2012-12-06-101537.png)\n. What about invalid look as shown in the first shot when child view is not stretched properly?\n. Will you fix org.holoeverywhere.app.Dialog.checkWindowSizes method?\n.

I can confirm that leaks are present. Try HE demo and rotate screen few times. Number of objects and used memory keep growing even after gc\n. Hope this will be useful.\n\nI've tried abs-styled demo. Rotated screen few times. There are small leaks.\nThen i've adjusted it to use Holo Activity and Fragment and application. And after that it become leaking 1000 times more. 2000-3000 objects + on each screen rotation\n. Even simplier.\n\nCreate standard android project with one activity containing relativelayout and textview (default project), and adjust it to use HE. Memory leak is there\n. Can it be problem in internal.WindowDecorView. How i see it has static members and number of views held by it grows on each screen rotation\nFirst run\n![image](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/2315223/475854/f91bc198-b7a4-11e2-9284-1ef3fd7b3766.png)\n\nRotated screen\n![image](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/2315223/475852/dd35958a-b7a4-11e2-9adb-e2489ac03158.png)\n.

It is WeakHashMap. Keys are weakreferences but not values. To fix memory leak we can use such approach\n\n``` java\n@SuppressWarnings(\"unchecked\")\n    public <T, V extends IAddonBase<T>> V obtain(T object) {\n        try {\n            WeakReference<V> addonRef = (WeakReference<V>) mStatesMap\n                    .get(object);\n            V addon = addonRef == null ? null : addonRef.get();\n            if (addon != null) {\n                return addon;\n            }\n            Class<?> clazz = object.getClass();\n            while (!mTypesMap.containsKey(clazz)) {\n                if (clazz == Object.class) {\n                    // Nothing was found\n                    return null;\n                }\n                clazz = clazz.getSuperclass();\n            }\n            addon = ((Class<V>) mTypesMap.get(clazz)).newInstance();\n            addon.attach(object);\n            mStatesMap.put(object, new WeakReference<V>(addon));\n            return addon;\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            throw new RuntimeException(e);\n        }\n    }\n```\n. If to import HE library to project and want to debug through HE or open some HE source directly from your project (ctrl + click) it will not be availalbe (Source is not attached). But when i put src to the top of Order and Export i can browse HE source directly from my project\n. @bastienbeurier we discussed it here #432. Does this help?\n. Unfortunately i don't know. But it is frequent and it is present only on Android 2.x. All i know is that onPrepareOptionsMenu is called in handler.post (maybe it occurs after activity is destroyed) but menu.findeItem returns null.\n. \u0410 \u0441 Fragment Lifecycle \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0431\u044b\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u044f\u0437\u0430\u043d\u043e? \u041d\u0443 \u0441\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0444\u0440\u0430\u0433\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u0443\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0442\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d \u0438\u043b\u0438 view \u0443\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0442\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043e, \u043d\u043e \u043e\u043d \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0430\u0433\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0442\u0438\u0435 onPrepareOptionsMenu?\n.

I couldn't reproduce it on emulator but keep receiving NPE errors reports from devices like Samsung GT-I9000B Galaxy S Vibrant, Motorola MB860 Atrix, ZTE X501 Groove, Samsung GT-I9100 Galaxy S II, Samsung GT-S5830 Galaxy Ace, Samsung GT-S5300B Galaxy Pocket, Samsung GT-I9003 Galaxy SL, LG P990 Optimus 2X, HTC Desire X0H6T, Motorola MB525 DEFY, HTC Desire S. All of them has android version 2.3.3-2.3.7\n. @BraisGabin did you find any solution for this issue?\n. Looks like it is related to this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20121711/dialog-on-android-kitkat-seems-to-be-cut\n. Looks like this solution works http://stackoverflow.com/a/20782404/527759\n. Perhaps somebody else will face the same issue so would be good if they'll find the solution here\n. I'm using android.support.v4.view.ViewPager with HoloEverywhere without a problems\n. @bkhall I don't use setView method in AlertDialog.Builder. I'm using setItems. Maybe when setItems is used something different happen inside holoeverywhere\n. ``` java\n        @Override\n        public Dialog onCreateDialog(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n            final CharSequence[] items = {\n                    \"one\",\n                    \"two\"\n            };\n\n            AlertDialog.Builder builder = new AlertDialog.Builder(getActivity());\n            builder.setTitle(R.string.my_title);\n            builder.setItems(items, new DialogInterface.OnClickListener() {\n                @Override\n                public void onClick(DialogInterface dialog, int item) {\n                 // DO NOTHING\n                }\n            });\n            return builder.create();\n        }\n```\n. @bkhall can you please check the above code?\n. @bkhall use any string from you resources\n. @bkhall also i'm not sure i should to call super onCreateDialog which creates another unused dialog\n. I have to sorry about that. The issue cause was that the strings.xml had 2 occurrence of my title. Second was wrong.\n. I understand this. But in the fragment menu i have only one menu item. But i see that parent menu items processed twice and have duplicates\n. @Prototik can you please reopen this?\n. I've tested with ABS only and it works correct. Here is the project link\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/37011471/Openphoto/P1121_DynamicActionBar_ABS_Only.zip\n\nThen i've added Holoeverywhere support and all become to work as reported in the issue. Parent menu items get duplicated\nHere the link is to the project which demonstrates the issue\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/37011471/Openphoto/P1121_DynamicActionBar_Holoeverywher.zip\n. But why it works properly in ABS and in the standard android actionbar?\n. DialogFragment with the view inflated from xml in the onCreateView method\n. In the styles i have defined custom style inherited from Holo.Theme.Dialog.Light\n\n``` xml\n<style name=\"Theme.OpenPhoto.Dialog.Light\" parent=\"Holo.Theme.Dialog.Light\">\n```\n\nIn the DialogFragment.onCreate i have code like this\n\n``` java\nsetStyle(STYLE_NORMAL, R.style.Theme_OpenPhoto_Dialog_Light);\n```\n. Tested it a little bit more on 2.1 and 2.3.3 emulators. First tests give good results.\n. I've found that org.holoeverywhere.app.Dialog.checkWindowSizes method causing the problem. If i comment its content the dialog looks properly. I don't know what exactly causing problem there but i hope it will help you to find the real cause. However as you can see title doesn't appear on 2.1 and it appears on 4.0.3\n![](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/37011471/Openphoto/device-2012-12-06-101537.png)\n. What about invalid look as shown in the first shot when child view is not stretched properly?\n. Will you fix org.holoeverywhere.app.Dialog.checkWindowSizes method?\n. Thanks. setDialogType helped a lot but i had to change theme to Holo.Theme.Dialog.Alert.Light. Thanks again\n. Also can you please provide some instructions on how to build project properly\n. @Prototik \u0432 \u0442\u043e\u043c \u0442\u043e \u0438 \u0434\u0435\u043b\u043e \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0438\u043d m2e, \u043d\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0438 holoeverywhere build artifact.\n. @Prototik \u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0431\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0438\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0443\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u0432 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435?\n. @Prototik \u0441\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0431\u043e \u0437\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0449\u044c, \u043f\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0443\u044e\n.

I can confirm that leaks are present. Try HE demo and rotate screen few times. Number of objects and used memory keep growing even after gc\n. Hope this will be useful.\n\nI've tried abs-styled demo. Rotated screen few times. There are small leaks.\nThen i've adjusted it to use Holo Activity and Fragment and application. And after that it become leaking 1000 times more. 2000-3000 objects + on each screen rotation\n. Even simplier.\n\nCreate standard android project with one activity containing relativelayout and textview (default project), and adjust it to use HE. Memory leak is there\n. Can it be problem in internal.WindowDecorView. How i see it has static members and number of views held by it grows on each screen rotation\nFirst run\n![image](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/2315223/475854/f91bc198-b7a4-11e2-9284-1ef3fd7b3766.png)\n\nRotated screen\n![image](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/2315223/475852/dd35958a-b7a4-11e2-9adb-e2489ac03158.png)\n.

It is WeakHashMap. Keys are weakreferences but not values. To fix memory leak we can use such approach\n\n``` java\n@SuppressWarnings(\"unchecked\")\n    public <T, V extends IAddonBase<T>> V obtain(T object) {\n        try {\n            WeakReference<V> addonRef = (WeakReference<V>) mStatesMap\n                    .get(object);\n            V addon = addonRef == null ? null : addonRef.get();\n            if (addon != null) {\n                return addon;\n            }\n            Class<?> clazz = object.getClass();\n            while (!mTypesMap.containsKey(clazz)) {\n                if (clazz == Object.class) {\n                    // Nothing was found\n                    return null;\n                }\n                clazz = clazz.getSuperclass();\n            }\n            addon = ((Class<V>) mTypesMap.get(clazz)).newInstance();\n            addon.attach(object);\n            mStatesMap.put(object, new WeakReference<V>(addon));\n            return addon;\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            throw new RuntimeException(e);\n        }\n    }\n```\n. If to import HE library to project and want to debug through HE or open some HE source directly from your project (ctrl + click) it will not be availalbe (Source is not attached). But when i put src to the top of Order and Export i can browse HE source directly from my project\n. @bastienbeurier we discussed it here #432. Does this help?\n. Unfortunately i don't know.

Lots of possibilities! :)\n\nThis works!:\n\n``` java\npublic class MyApplication extends org.holoeverywhere.app.Application {\n  static {\n    ThemeManager.setDefaultTheme(ThemeManager.MIXED);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis doesn't:\n\n``` java\nsetTheme(ThemeManager.MIXED);\nsuper.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n```\n\nI'd prefer to use XML to do this, though, so I tried your new Manifest changes, but I'm not sure how to use them.\n\nThis doesn't work:\n\n``` xml\n<application\n        android:name=\"org.holoeverywhere.app.Application\"\n        android:allowBackup=\"true\"\n        android:icon=\"@drawable/ic_launcher\"\n        android:label=\"@string/app_name\"\n        android:theme=\"@style/Holo.Theme.Light.DarkActionBar\">\n```\n\nNeither does this:\n\n``` xml\n<application\n        android:name=\"org.holoeverywhere.app.Application\"\n        android:allowBackup=\"true\"\n        android:icon=\"@drawable/ic_launcher\"\n        android:label=\"@string/app_name\"\n        android:theme=\"@style/Holo.Theme.Light.DarkActionBar\"\n        holo:holoTheme=\"mixed\" >\n```\n\nOr this:\n\n``` xml\n<activity\n            android:name=\"com.example.preferencetest.SettingsActivity\"\n            android:label=\"@string/app_name\"\n            android:theme=\"@style/Holo.Theme.Light.DarkActionBar\"\n            holo:holoTheme=\"mixed\" >\n```\n\nWhat am I doing wrong? Thanks for working through this with me.\n. Wooooooo!!!!!! It's working again!\n\nMy custom styling isn't working, though :( Test project here: https://github.com/mattprecious/Bug299\n\nCould you possibly make that work via the Manifest again? Or is that too much work? It was working perfectly on 1.4.2 before you pulled Preferences out into an add-on.\n\nThanks!\n. @demartino88 If you don't have any custom drawables for check boxes or the like, the latest update honours your android:theme attribute in your manifest file. See the demo project Sergey posted earlier. \n. Haha, spend time with your girlfriend, Sergey! This doesn't need to be done tomorrow. \n. Sorry about that, I guess I got a little confused when trying to debug my other issue.\n. Woo! Works great! #299 is working great as well through XML.\n\nI couldn't figure out how to use the images without setting them in the styles, but that's alright, it's no big deal.\n. ",

I think these are actually two different issues:\n1. HoloEverywhere adds background to the select views:\n   **HoloEverywhere**\n   ![device-2013-04-15-192815](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/721244/382195/6849b04e-a5f2-11e2-880f-0be94424ece8.png)\n   **Holo**\n   ![device-2013-04-15-193151](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/721244/382196/684b9850-a5f2-11e2-9e8a-48f9c1c30182.png)\n   Tested on:\n   - Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7' (4.1.1) \n   - Nexus 4 (4.2.2)\n   - Galaxy Tab 1 7' (2.2.1)\n   - Nexus One (2.3.6)\n2. HoloEverywhere doesn't remove the pressed background in this mode.

I have a LinearLayout with defined height and it works like a charm. Some code to reproduce your issue will help.\n. I think you are looking for [ViewPagerIndicator](https://github.com/JakeWharton/Android-ViewPagerIndicator).\n\nBut this question should have been asked \u200b\u200bon StackOverflow or similar pages.\n. Why doesn't it work fine? Exception, null pointer, unnespected behaviour?\n\nDid you try extending it to org.holoeverywhere.widget.TextView?\n. Did you try the current master version? #436 fix it.\n. Remove `HoloEverywhere/contrib/ActionBarSherlock/actionbarsherlock/libs/android-support-v4.jar` and copy `HoloEverywhere/support-library/android-support-v4-r12.jar` to `HoloEverywhere/contrib/ActionBarSherlock/actionbarsherlock/libs/`. I'll update the wiki to clarify this point.\n. Did you install the support package? https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/wiki/Import-in-IDE#eclipse\n. [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) is your friend.\n. I'm agree that is more easy. The problem is that I paste a StackOverflow's code and Eclipse warns me about a deprecation and the doc doesn't tell me an alternative.\n\nI quickly found alternatives: `android.support.v4.app.Fragment.instantiate(Context, String)` or `org.holoeverywhere.app.Fragment.instantiate(Class<T>)` but I think that the changes at the API must be documented.\n\nI would want to commit something like e5d19bb6e7a51b9be77ca14504752c398da1df5c to explain the reason of deprecation and give a alternative. This is the reason of the question.\n. Never mind... This bug is native.\n. F***! I wrote a comment yesterday but I think that I didn't click the \"Comment\" button...\n\nThe native behaviour is really strange and have bugs.\n\nTwo cases:\n1. **Light theme**\n   The icons must be dark. HE bug or ABS bug?\n2. **Mixed theme**\n   Native doesn't show them neither.\n   ![device-2013-06-20-110011 copy](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/721244/686284/71b0d7f2-da54-11e2-8d9b-2eac9b8c48ce.png)\n\nThe color of the context ActionBar I really don't know. In an Activity is dark but in an Dialog is light. I don't know if is the same bug or not...\n\nI push a project to check this strange behaviour.\n. I know that I had had this issue without HoloEverywhere but I don't\nremember where the problem was.\n\nTry to create a new project with a copy  of this activity but without\nHoloEverywhere, change the imports. Use the API 16 for instance.\n\nIf you have the same issue it isn't related with HoloEverywhere.\n. Ok, I have the same issue in my project (another).\n\nAll works fine with `SherlockFragmentActivity` and `SherlockListFragment` but when I change to `org.holoeverywhere.app.Activity` and `org.holoeverywhere.app.ListFragment` this issue appears. I will try to push a project to reproduce the problem.\n. No, it doesn't. Close this if it is not easy to fix, use nine-patch is not a drama.\n. Fixed! You're a genius ;)\n. With git bisect http://code-worrier.com/blog/git-bisect-basics/ you can find the commit. I think that @Prototik will appreciate it. \n. To reproduce it replace `themes.xml` at the demo:\n\n``` xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?><resources xmlns:tools=\"http://schemas.android.com/tools\">\n    <style name=\"Holo.Demo\"/>\n    <style name=\"Holo.Demo.FontViewer\">\n        <item name=\"android:gravity\">center</item>\n        <item name=\"android:layout_height\">?listPreferredItemHeightSmall</item>\n        <item name=\"android:layout_width\">match_parent</item>\n        <item name=\"android:textAppearance\">?android:textAppearanceMedium</item>\n    </style>\n    <style name=\"Holo.Demo.ListRowView\">\n        <item name=\"android:background\">?selectableItemBackground</item>\n    </style>\n    <style name=\"Holo.Demo.Theme\" parent=\"Holo.Theme\">\n        <!--Include block: DemoThemeDark-->\n        <!--Include block: DemoTheme-->\n        <item name=\"android:homeAsUpIndicator\" tools:ignore=\"NewApi\">?homeAsUpIndicator</item>\n        <item name=\"demoListRowViewStyle\">@style/Holo.Demo.ListRowView</item>\n        <item name=\"homeAsUpIndicator\">@drawable/home_as_up_indicator</item>\n        <item name=\"android:radioButtonStyle\">@style/Holo.CompoundButton.RadioButton2</item>\n        <!--End of block DemoTheme-->\n        <!--End of block DemoThemeDark-->\n        <!--Include block: DemoThemeBarDark-->\n        <!--Include block: DemoThemeBar-->\n        <!--End of block DemoThemeBar-->\n        <item name=\"menuBackground\">#dd222222</item>\n        <!--End of block DemoThemeBarDark-->\n    </style>\n    <style name=\"Holo.CompoundButton.RadioButton2\" parent=\"Holo.CompoundButton.RadioButton\">\n        <item name=\"android:button\">@drawable/icon</item>\n    </style>\n    <style name=\"Holo.CompoundButton.RadioButton3\" parent=\"Holo.CompoundButton.RadioButton\">\n        <item name=\"android:button\">@drawable/icon</item>\n        <item name=\"android:background\">@android:color/transparent</item>\n    </style>\n    <style name=\"Holo.Demo.Theme.Fullscreen\">\n        <!--Include block: Fullscreen-->\n        <item name=\"android:windowContentOverlay\">@null</item>\n        <item name=\"android:windowFullscreen\">true</item>\n        <item name=\"android:radioButtonStyle\">@style/Holo.CompoundButton.RadioButton2</item>\n        <item name=\"windowContentOverlay\">@null</item>\n        <!--End of block Fullscreen-->\n    </style>\n    <style name=\"Holo.Demo.Theme.Light\" parent=\"Holo.Theme.Light\">\n        <!--Include block: DemoThemeLight-->\n        <!--Include block: DemoTheme-->\n        <item name=\"android:homeAsUpIndicator\" tools:ignore=\"NewApi\">?homeAsUpIndicator</item>\n        <item name=\"demoListRowViewStyle\">@style/Holo.Demo.ListRowView</item>\n        <item name=\"homeAsUpIndicator\">@drawable/home_as_up_indicator</item>\n        <!--End of block DemoTheme-->\n        <!--End of block DemoThemeLight-->\n        <!--Include block: DemoThemeBarLight-->\n        <item name=\"android:radioButtonStyle\">@style/Holo.CompoundButton.RadioButton3</item>\n        <!--Include block: DemoThemeBar-->\n        <!--End of block DemoThemeBar-->\n        <item name=\"menuBackground\">#dddddddd</item>\n        <!--End of block DemoThemeBarLight-->\n    </style>\n    <style name=\"Holo.Demo.Theme.Light.DarkActionBar\" parent=\"Holo.Theme.Light.DarkActionBar\">\n        <!--Include block: DemoThemeLight-->\n        <!--Include block: DemoTheme-->\n        <item name=\"android:homeAsUpIndicator\" tools:ignore=\"NewApi\">?homeAsUpIndicator</item>\n        <item name=\"demoListRowViewStyle\">@style/Holo.Demo.ListRowView</item>\n        <item name=\"homeAsUpIndicator\">@drawable/home_as_up_indicator</item>\n        <!--End of block DemoTheme-->\n        <!--End of block DemoThemeLight-->\n        <!--Include block: DemoThemeBarDark-->\n        <!--Include block: DemoThemeBar-->\n        <!--End of block DemoThemeBar-->\n        <item name=\"menuBackground\">#dd222222</item>\n        <!--End of block DemoThemeBarDark-->\n    </style>\n    <style name=\"Holo.Demo.Theme.Light.DarkActionBar.Fullscreen\">\n        <!--Include block: Fullscreen-->\n        <item name=\"android:windowContentOverlay\">@null</item>\n        <item name=\"android:windowFullscreen\">true</item>\n        <item name=\"windowContentOverlay\">@null</item>\n        <!--End of block Fullscreen-->\n    </style>\n    <style name=\"Holo.Demo.Theme.Light.Fullscreen\">\n        <!--Include block: Fullscreen-->\n        <item name=\"android:windowContentOverlay\">@null</item>\n        <item name=\"android:radioButtonStyle\">@style/Holo.CompoundButton.RadioButton3</item>\n        <item name=\"android:windowFullscreen\">true</item>\n        <item name=\"windowContentOverlay\">@null</item>\n        <!--End of block Fullscreen-->\n    </style>\n</resources>\n```\n\n(It's a really dirty code, I know)\n. It's an API 17 \"issue\": http://stackoverflow.com/a/16739017/842697\n\nI fixed it with an specific style for API 17 (`values-v17`) in my project. Using `<item name=\"android:background\">@android:color/transparent</item>` in it.\n\nI don't understand why this issue only appears adding a custom `android:button` drawable. But this fix the problem.\n. Did you import the preferences addon?\nhttps://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/tree/master/addons/preferences\n. Did you use the abc branch? \n. Go to _Order and Export_ and check _Android private Libraries_.\n. > Unable to resolve target android-17\n\nDownload the sdk 17 or select a sdk that you have at your local environment.\n\nThis is a common error importing libraries, please, use Google before open an issue.\n. Something like:\n\n``` git\ngit reset HEAD^1 --soft\ngit stash\ngit reset HEAD^1 --hard\n# rebase\ngit stash pop\ngit commit -a -m \"Stops RotateDrawable from calling API that doesn't exist on Android 2.3 or below.\"\n# squash\n```\n\nI'm pretty sure that there is a better way but...\n. https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/issues/456#issuecomment-18271105 Not use android.R.id.content create a frame layout, add to the activity and replace it. \n. Here it's:  https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/blob/master/issues/src/org/holoeverywhere/issues/i619/MainActivity.java\n. Yes, in fact I was implementing a fix to this problem this weekend. I think that I will be able to push it tomorrow.\n. Use v1.6.8\n. Are you following [this steps](https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/wiki/Import-in-IDE/edf4b3e2e451cbec85d214b3ca3e0d6607770ed8)?\n. Duplicate #484.\n. HE version? I think this bug was solved.\n. `v1.6.8` have this error. There was a recursion loop when `allowFileReusage = false` because never again was set to `true`. But this issue is fixed on `master`.\n. What is the issue: the quick hidden or the menu button? The overflow at menu button is the native behavior. \n. Two workarounds:\n1. Don't use ListActivity. Use Activity, or \n2. Make PullToResfreshListView extends HoloEverywhere.ListView. \n. The APK that Prototik provides works fine in a Nexus 5 v4.4.2\n. No, I found this bug just reviewing the sample app. I didn't need a work around in my code. \n. F***, novice error, sorry. Yes, I know it. But I implemented this code before that class existed and when I was updating it began to fail. Any way, thanks and I'll try TabSwipeActivity. \n. HoloEverywhere doesn't have any dependency with ABS since v2.0. If you want to update HE you must change to ABS.\n. Yes, you're right. A typo.\n.  Respect the indentation, please. \n. Code itself.\n. Wow, it's a bug. What comment do you want? You are right, you described the bug perfectly and more information isn't necessary. But no one fixed it yet. There was no point to comment here. \n. You know that there's a difference but you don't know where is it? Or you know where it's and this is just a game of \"find the difference\"?\n. Android feature. Not related with HoloEverywhere.\n. There are not differences between add a Fragment inside an Activity with or without HoloEverywhere. Please use StackOverflow. You will get better support. \n. Another option: https://github.com/derekbrameyer/android-betterpickers\n\nI close this because, yes, it's a duplicate. \n. Did you [read this](https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/wiki/Basic-migration-on-HoloEverywhere)?\n. What don't work? Any log error? How can we reproduce this? \n. Does your `Fragment` extend `org.holoeverywhere.app.Fragment`? I don't think so. The problem isn't in the `Activity`. It's in your `Fragment`.\n\nAnd please: \n1. If it's an issue report like a issue: the problem & how to reproduce it.\n2. If it's a question use StackOverflow.\n. No problem, the next time you will report in the right place ;).\n\nIf I understand properly you have a compilation problem, not a CastCassException, right? Did you try this?:\n\n``` java\nFragment fragment = (Fragment) getActivity().getSupportFragmentManager().getFragment(savedInstanceState, \"fragment_top\");\n```\n. @RichardLindhout if you want it only for 4.4.2 it's possible but it's not a HoloEverywhere feature. Override the theme in `values-v19` and add `<item name=\"android:windowTranslucentStatus\">true</item>`.\n. Dup #617. This issue is fixed in master version. \n. Assist in this library has been a pleasure. @Prototik, thanks for trust me. I learned a lot of stuff reading your code. Great work!\n. I suppose that I was not the only one thinking about it.\n. Support API 14 is senseless. https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html\n\nI think that API 15 is the best choice.\n. True. But this is a backport library. 27% seems too much.\n. Google will release a \"Material support library\": https://plus.google.com/103829716466878605055/posts/gmAV3n2wmXs\n. I suppose that you push this by error.\n. Dup #298\n. How is this question related with HoloEverywhere? \n\nAnyway I just answered this question in SO. You can check it. \n.

HoloEverywhere adds background to the select views:\n   **HoloEverywhere**\n   ![device-2013-04-15-192815](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/721244/382195/6849b04e-a5f2-11e2-880f-0be94424ece8.png)\n   **Holo**\n   ![device-2013-04-15-193151](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/721244/382196/684b9850-a5f2-11e2-9e8a-48f9c1c30182.png)\n   Tested on:\n   - Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7' (4.1.1) \n   - Nexus 4 (4.2.2)\n   - Galaxy Tab 1 7' (2.2.1)\n   - Nexus One (2.3.6)\n2. HoloEverywhere doesn't remove the pressed background in this mode. I reproduce this error with the next steps:\n   - Long click first item\n   - Click second item\n   - Click third item\n   - Click second item\n   - Click third item\n\n**result:**\n![device-2013-04-15-194721](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/721244/382270/95da29b0-a5f4-11e2-83c0-88207361ea00.png)\n**Expected:**\n![device-2013-04-15-194253](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/721244/382250/f8814252-a5f3-11e2-9d23-2c62349bd1ff.png)\n\nTested on:\n- Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7' (4.1.1) \n- Nexus 4 (4.2.2)\n- Galaxy Tab 1 7' (2.2.1) **[WORKS FINE]**\n- Nexus One (2.3.6) **[WORKS FINE]**\n. I have a LinearLayout with defined height and it works like a charm. Some code to reproduce your issue will help.\n. I think you are looking for [ViewPagerIndicator](https://github.com/JakeWharton/Android-ViewPagerIndicator).\n\nBut this question should have been asked \u200b\u200bon StackOverflow or similar pages.\n. Why doesn't it work fine? Exception, null pointer, unnespected behaviour?\n\nDid you try extending it to org.holoeverywhere.widget.TextView?\n. Did you try the current master version? #436 fix it.\n. Remove `HoloEverywhere/contrib/ActionBarSherlock/actionbarsherlock/libs/android-support-v4.jar` and copy `HoloEverywhere/support-library/android-support-v4-r12.jar` to `HoloEverywhere/contrib/ActionBarSherlock/actionbarsherlock/libs/`. I'll update the wiki to clarify this point.\n. Did you install the support package? https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/wiki/Import-in-IDE#eclipse\n. [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) is your friend.\n. I'm agree that is more easy. The problem is that I paste a StackOverflow's code and Eclipse warns me about a deprecation and the doc doesn't tell me an alternative.\n\nI quickly found alternatives: `android.support.v4.app.Fragment.instantiate(Context, String)` or `org.holoeverywhere.app.Fragment.instantiate(Class<T>)` but I think that the changes at the API must be documented.\n\nI would want to commit something like e5d19bb6e7a51b9be77ca14504752c398da1df5c to explain the reason of deprecation and give a alternative. This is the reason of the question.\n. Never mind... This bug is native.\n. F***! I wrote a comment yesterday but I think that I didn't click the \"Comment\" button...\n\nThe native behaviour is really strange and have bugs.\n\nTwo cases:\n1. **Light theme**\n   The icons must be dark. HE bug or ABS bug?\n2. **Mixed theme**\n   Native doesn't show them neither.\n   ![device-2013-06-20-110011 copy](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/721244/686284/71b0d7f2-da54-11e2-8d9b-2eac9b8c48ce.png)\n\nThe color of the context ActionBar I really don't know. In an Activity is dark but in an Dialog is light. I don't know if is the same bug or not...\n\nI push a project to check this strange behaviour.\n. I know that I had had this issue without HoloEverywhere but I don't\nremember where the problem was.\n\nTry to create a new project with a copy  of this activity but without\nHoloEverywhere, change the imports. Use the API 16 for instance.\n\nIf you have the same issue it isn't related with HoloEverywhere.\n. Ok, I have the same issue in my project (another).\n\nAll works fine with `SherlockFragmentActivity` and `SherlockListFragment` but when I change to `org.holoeverywhere.app.Activity` and `org.holoeverywhere.app.ListFragment` this issue appears. I will try to push a project to reproduce the problem.\n. No, it doesn't. Close this if it is not easy to fix, use nine-patch is not a drama.\n. Fixed! You're a genius ;)\n. With git bisect http://code-worrier.com/blog/git-bisect-basics/ you can find the commit. I think that @Prototik will appreciate it. \n. To reproduce it replace `themes.xml` at the demo:\n\n``` xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?><resources xmlns:tools=\"http://schemas.android.com/tools\">\n    <style name=\"Holo.Demo\"/>\n    <style name=\"Holo.Demo.FontViewer\">\n        <item name=\"android:gravity\">center</item>\n        <item name=\"android:layout_height\">?listPreferredItemHeightSmall</item>\n        <item name=\"android:layout_width\">match_parent</item>\n        <item name=\"android:textAppearance\">?android:textAppearanceMedium</item>\n    </style>\n    <style name=\"Holo.Demo.ListRowView\">\n        <item name=\"android:background\">?selectableItemBackground</item>\n    </style>\n    <style name=\"Holo.Demo.Theme\" parent=\"Holo.Theme\">\n        <!--Include block: DemoThemeDark-->\n        <!--Include block: DemoTheme-->\n        <item name=\"android:homeAsUpIndicator\" tools:ignore=\"NewApi\">?homeAsUpIndicator</item>\n        <item name=\"demoListRowViewStyle\">@style/Holo.Demo.ListRowView</item>\n        <item name=\"homeAsUpIndicator\">@drawable/home_as_up_indicator</item>\n        <item name=\"android:radioButtonStyle\">@style/Holo.CompoundButton.RadioButton2</item>\n        <!--End of block DemoTheme-->\n        <!--End of block DemoThemeDark-->\n        <!--Include block: DemoThemeBarDark-->\n        <!--Include block: DemoThemeBar-->\n        <!--End of block DemoThemeBar-->\n        <item name=\"menuBackground\">#dd222222</item>\n        <!--End of block DemoThemeBarDark-->\n    </style>\n    <style name=\"Holo.CompoundButton.RadioButton2\" parent=\"Holo.CompoundButton.RadioButton\">\n        <item name=\"android:button\">@drawable/icon</item>\n    </style>\n    <style name=\"Holo.CompoundButton.RadioButton3\" parent=\"Holo.CompoundButton.RadioButton\">\n        <item name=\"android:button\">@drawable/icon</item>\n        <item name=\"android:background\">@android:color/transparent</item>\n    </style>\n    <style name=\"Holo.Demo.Theme.Fullscreen\">\n        <!--Include block: Fullscreen-->\n        <item name=\"android:windowContentOverlay\">@null</item>\n        <item name=\"android:windowFullscreen\">true</item>\n        <item name=\"android:radioButtonStyle\">@style/Holo.CompoundButton.RadioButton2</item>\n        <item name=\"windowContentOverlay\">@null</item>\n        <!--End of block Fullscreen-->\n    </style>\n    <style name=\"Holo.Demo.Theme.Light\" parent=\"Holo.Theme.Light\">\n        <!--Include block: DemoThemeLight-->\n        <!--Include block: DemoTheme-->\n        <item name=\"android:homeAsUpIndicator\" tools:ignore=\"NewApi\">?homeAsUpIndicator</item>\n        <item name=\"demoListRowViewStyle\">@style/Holo.Demo.ListRowView</item>\n        <item name=\"homeAsUpIndicator\">@drawable/home_as_up_indicator</item>\n        <!--End of block DemoTheme-->\n        <!--End of block DemoThemeLight-->\n        <!--Include block: DemoThemeBarLight-->\n        <item name=\"android:radioButtonStyle\">@style/Holo.CompoundButton.RadioButton3</item>\n        <!--Include block: DemoThemeBar-->\n        <!--End of block DemoThemeBar-->\n        <item name=\"menuBackground\">#dddddddd</item>\n        <!--End of block DemoThemeBarLight-->\n    </style>\n    <style name=\"Holo.Demo.Theme.Light.DarkActionBar\" parent=\"Holo.Theme.Light.DarkActionBar\">\n        <!--Include block: DemoThemeLight-->\n        <!--Include block: DemoTheme-->\n        <item name=\"android:homeAsUpIndicator\" tools:ignore=\"NewApi\">?homeAsUpIndicator</item>\n        <item name=\"demoListRowViewStyle\">@style/Holo.Demo.ListRowView</item>\n        <item name=\"homeAsUpIndicator\">@drawable/home_as_up_indicator</item>\n        <!--End of block DemoTheme-->\n        <!--End of block DemoThemeLight-->\n        <!--Include block: DemoThemeBarDark-->\n        <!--Include block: DemoThemeBar-->\n        <!--End of block DemoThemeBar-->\n        <item name=\"menuBackground\">#dd222222</item>\n        <!--End of block DemoThemeBarDark-->\n    </style>\n    <style name=\"Holo.Demo.Theme.Light.DarkActionBar.Fullscreen\">\n        <!--Include block: Fullscreen-->\n        <item name=\"android:windowContentOverlay\">@null</item>\n        <item name=\"android:windowFullscreen\">true</item>\n        <item name=\"windowContentOverlay\">@null</item>\n        <!--End of block Fullscreen-->\n    </style>\n    <style name=\"Holo.Demo.Theme.Light.Fullscreen\">\n        <!--Include block: Fullscreen-->\n        <item name=\"android:windowContentOverlay\">@null</item>\n        <item name=\"android:radioButtonStyle\">@style/Holo.CompoundButton.RadioButton3</item>\n        <item name=\"android:windowFullscreen\">true</item>\n        <item name=\"windowContentOverlay\">@null</item>\n        <!--End of block Fullscreen-->\n    </style>\n</resources>\n```\n\n(It's a really dirty code, I know)\n. It's an API 17 \"issue\": http://stackoverflow.com/a/16739017/842697\n\nI fixed it with an specific style for API 17 (`values-v17`) in my project. Using `<item name=\"android:background\">@android:color/transparent</item>` in it.\n\nI don't understand why this issue only appears adding a custom `android:button` drawable. But this fix the problem.\n. Did you import the preferences addon?\nhttps://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/tree/master/addons/preferences\n. Did you use the abc branch? \n. Go to _Order and Export_ and check _Android private Libraries_.\n. > Unable to resolve target android-17\n\nDownload the sdk 17 or select a sdk that you have at your local environment.\n\nThis is a common error importing libraries, please, use Google before open an issue.\n. Something like:\n\n``` git\ngit reset HEAD^1 --soft\ngit stash\ngit reset HEAD^1 --hard\n# rebase\ngit stash pop\ngit commit -a -m \"Stops RotateDrawable from calling API that doesn't exist on Android 2.3 or below.\"\n# squash\n```\n\nI'm pretty sure that there is a better way but...\n. https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/issues/456#issuecomment-18271105 Not use android.R.id.content create a frame layout, add to the activity and replace it. \n. Here it's:  https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/blob/master/issues/src/org/holoeverywhere/issues/i619/MainActivity.java\n. Yes, in fact I was implementing a fix to this problem this weekend. I think that I will be able to push it tomorrow.\n. Use v1.6.8\n. Are you following [this steps](https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/wiki/Import-in-IDE/edf4b3e2e451cbec85d214b3ca3e0d6607770ed8)?\n. Duplicate #484.\n. HE version? I think this bug was solved.\n. `v1.6.8` have this error. There was a recursion loop when `allowFileReusage = false` because never again was set to `true`. But this issue is fixed on `master`.\n. What is the issue: the quick hidden or the menu button? The overflow at menu button is the native behavior. \n. Two workarounds:\n1. Don't use ListActivity. Use Activity, or \n2. Make PullToResfreshListView extends HoloEverywhere.ListView. \n. The APK that Prototik provides works fine in a Nexus 5 v4.4.2\n. No, I found this bug just reviewing the sample app. I didn't need a work around in my code. \n. F***, novice error, sorry. Yes, I know it. But I implemented this code before that class existed and when I was updating it began to fail. Any way, thanks and I'll try TabSwipeActivity. \n. HoloEverywhere doesn't have any dependency with ABS since v2.0. If you want to update HE you must change to ABS.\n. Yes, you're right. A typo.\n.  Respect the indentation, please. \n. Code itself.\n. Wow, it's a bug. What comment do you want? You are right, you described the bug perfectly and more information isn't necessary. But no one fixed it yet. There was no point to comment here. \n. You know that there's a difference but you don't know where is it? Or you know where it's and this is just a game of \"find the difference\"?\n. Android feature. Not related with HoloEverywhere.\n. There are not differences between add a Fragment inside an Activity with or without HoloEverywhere. Please use StackOverflow. You will get better support. \n. Another option: https://github.com/derekbrameyer/android-betterpickers\n\nI close this because, yes, it's a duplicate. \n. Did you [read this](https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/wiki/Basic-migration-on-HoloEverywhere)?\n. What don't work? Any log error? How can we reproduce this? \n. Does your `Fragment` extend `org.holoeverywhere.app.Fragment`? I don't think so. The problem isn't in the `Activity`. It's in your `Fragment`.\n\nAnd please: \n1. If it's an issue report like a issue: the problem & how to reproduce it.\n2. If it's a question use StackOverflow.\n. No problem, the next time you will report in the right place ;).\n\nIf I understand properly you have a compilation problem, not a CastCassException, right? Did you try this?:\n\n``` java\nFragment fragment = (Fragment) getActivity().getSupportFragmentManager().getFragment(savedInstanceState, \"fragment_top\");\n```\n. @RichardLindhout if you want it only for 4.4.2 it's possible but it's not a HoloEverywhere feature. Override the theme in `values-v19` and add `<item name=\"android:windowTranslucentStatus\">true</item>`.\n. Dup #617. This issue is fixed in master version. \n. Assist in this library has been a pleasure. @Prototik, thanks for trust me. I learned a lot of stuff reading your code. Great work!\n. I suppose that I was not the only one thinking about it.\n. Support API 14 is senseless. https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html\n\nI think that API 15 is the best choice.\n. True. But this is a backport library. 27% seems too much.\n. Google will release a \"Material support library\": https://plus.google.com/103829716466878605055/posts/gmAV3n2wmXs\n. I suppose that you push this by error.\n. Dup #298\n. How is this question related with HoloEverywhere? \n\nAnyway I just answered this question in SO. You can check it. \n. ",

Thanks! It helped a lot :+1: \n. @Prototik You're right - this is kind of Android problem, still I need to access this class to load it..\n. Ok, as a workaround i created org.holoeverywhere.widget package, moved my adapter there and loaded class in getItem method.\n. Ok, then but which `FragmentManager` we should use to return `org.holoeverywhere.app.Fragment`?\n. Ok, I figured it out. It turned that we extended normal `Fragment`.

I will try to decompile it and check if support classes are present...\n. It's awesome :) I'll check this later but it's probably the case.\n. Maybe there should be a notice in wiki about this...\n. Are You using inflater from `Holo`\n. It also relates to https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/issues/484\n. @Prototik Seems that build tools are mising...\n. Hey, thanks for for Your heavy work! \nI have only one question - Do Yo plan to release the very last final version from master? It would be nice because it fixes some serious bugs (eg. Sony Xperia layout bug)\n. What the didn't is support for VectorDrawable and AnimatedVectorDrawable \n. @Prototik Any work in progress? Is there any project opened for it? Maybe we could contribute ;)\n. Usually it is 2 x 2 secs. But still it is quite a long time...\n. It works, but I noticed that gravity in LinearLayout stopped working. I don't know if it's the case of the patch or some previous commits.\n. No, if You have LinearLayout instead of merge and eg. a TextView inside\n. I have following layout: https://gist.github.com/3caf5e71fde7c7c69622\n\nIn version 1.4.2 gravity in root linear layout worked nice, but in 52dd374 gravity does not work (it moves the whole content to top).\n\nHere you can see current and expected behaviour:\nhttp://imgur.com/a/28s7x\n. @Prototik I've seen that You removed NineOldAndroids support but in fact You're using internal package which usage is discouraged. See https://github.com/JakeWharton/NineOldAndroids/issues/33\n. @Prototik I think that bug (animation stop) occurred because You  were using internal nineOldAndroids instead of separate library. Maybe If you would use the full library it would work....\n. Below is example of my layout. Linear layout is set to have height of 300dp but it behaves like wrap_content...\n\n``` xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<LinearLayout xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n    android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n    android:layout_height=\"300dp\"\n    android:background=\"@drawable/my_drawable\"\n    android:orientation=\"horizontal\"\n    android:weightSum=\"5\" >\n\n    <View\n        android:id=\"@+id/red_separator\"\n        android:layout_width=\"4dp\"\n        android:layout_height=\"match_parent\"\n        android:background=\"@color/red\" />\n\n    <LinearLayout\n        android:id=\"@+id/my_layout_parameter_container\"\n        android:layout_width=\"0dp\"\n        android:layout_height=\"match_parent\"\n        android:layout_weight=\"4\"\n        android:orientation=\"vertical\" >\n\n    </LinearLayout>\n\n    <View\n        android:id=\"@+id/my_layout_separator\"\n        android:layout_width=\"1dp\"\n        android:layout_height=\"match_parent\"\n        android:background=\"@color/text_gray\" />\n\n    <LinearLayout\n        android:id=\"@+id/my_layout_actions_container\"\n        android:layout_width=\"0dp\"\n        android:layout_height=\"match_parent\"\n        android:layout_weight=\"1\"\n        android:gravity=\"center_horizontal\"\n        android:orientation=\"vertical\"\n        android:weightSum=\"2\" >\n\n        <CheckBox\n            android:id=\"@+id/my_layout_checkbox\"\n            android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"\n            android:layout_height=\"0dp\"\n            android:layout_marginLeft=\"3dp\"\n            android:layout_weight=\"1\"\n            android:focusable=\"false\" />\n\n        <ImageView\n            android:id=\"@+id/my_layout_edit_button\"\n            android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n            android:layout_height=\"0dp\"\n            android:layout_weight=\"1\"\n            android:background=\"@drawable/selector\"\n            android:contentDescription=\"change button\"\n            android:scaleType=\"centerInside\"\n            android:src=\"@drawable/ic_action_edit_default\" />\n    </LinearLayout>\n\n</LinearLayout>\n```\n. Thanks! It helped a lot :+1: \n. @Prototik You're right - this is kind of Android problem, still I need to access this class to load it..\n. Ok, as a workaround i created org.holoeverywhere.widget package, moved my adapter there and loaded class in getItem method.\n. Ok, then but which `FragmentManager` we should use to return `org.holoeverywhere.app.Fragment`?\n. Ok, I figured it out. It turned that we extended normal `Fragment`. Anyway \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0431\u043e!\n.

Hey, thanks for for Your heavy work! \nI have only one question - Do Yo plan to release the very last final version from master? It would be nice because it fixes some serious bugs (eg. Sony Xperia layout bug)\n. What the didn't is support for VectorDrawable and AnimatedVectorDrawable \n. @Prototik Any work in progress? Is there any project opened for it? Maybe we could contribute ;)\n. ",

A simple solution is to call notifyDataSetChanged() like this:\n\n```\npublic boolean removeFooter(View v) {\n    for (int i = 0; i < mFooterViewInfos.size(); i++) {\n        ViewInfo info = mFooterViewInfos.get(i);\n        if (info.view == v) {\n            mFooterViewInfos.remove(i);\n            mAreAllFixedViewsSelectable =\n                    areAllListInfosSelectable(mHeaderViewInfos)\n                    && areAllListInfosSelectable(mFooterViewInfos);\n            notifyDataSetChanged();\n            return true;\n        }\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n\npublic boolean removeHeader(View v) {\n    for (int i = 0; i < mHeaderViewInfos.size(); i++) {\n        ViewInfo info = mHeaderViewInfos.get(i);\n        if (info.view == v) {\n            mHeaderViewInfos.remove(i);\n            mAreAllFixedViewsSelectable =\n                    areAllListInfosSelectable(mHeaderViewInfos)\n                    && areAllListInfosSelectable(mFooterViewInfos);\n            notifyDataSetChanged();\n            return true;\n        }\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n```\n.

Yes I use Holo.Theme.Light.DarkActionBar\n2. The SearchView is ActionBarSherlock library class, I cannot change it to include HoloEverywhere inflater.\n3. It was working, just recent changes caused it to stop working (maybe that can help you :))\n. Sorry, but this hasn't changed anything. \n\nEven when using getSupportActionBarContext, I get the same error (cannot inflate TextView).\n\nIt seems when I debug, that the method doesn't get even after the first null condition, so it doesn't return ContextThemeWrapperPlus\n. Alright, so the condition on which you decide whether to return ContextThemeWrapperPlus seems to be wrong, because if I run it with Holo.Theme.Light.DarkActionBar theme, it picks the first option, not the ContextThemeWrapperPlus option.\n\nThat is why it is still failing, please fix for future references.\n. I will try to implement it your way, like in the bug project. Sorry for constantly bugging you.\nThank you very much.\n. The thing is that it was working somewhere back, before too many commits :) \n\nAnother thing is that I get an impression that bug in ABS is more related to spinners and custom dropdown items.\nThat is working perfectly for me. I got problem only with \"Action overflow\" button.\n. +1 would be very helpful\n. same is happening to me\n. I found a workaround on stackoverflow\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/3519277/how-to-change-the-text-color-of-menu-item-in-android \n\nlook for the answer from Marcus Wolschon\n\nI am still looking for unwanted consequences :)\n. Thank you it works perfect now\n. Is there a temporary solution for this? \nThe best I get is action bar theming, but otherwise everything stays in dark theme for the preferences when using headers.\n. The latest commit fixed my issue. \n\nIt would be nice though to specify the theme only in xml.\n\nThank you for help.\n. The problem is when using\n\nvoid org.holoeverywhere.app.Activity.addContentView(View view, LayoutParams params)\n\nParams and view is set well with right values\n. I have created a show case project\n\nhttps://github.com/demartino88/CroutonTestProject\n. Can you please lead us to the workaround maybe, I have a presentation of the app, early next week. I will think of something else if not, though. Thx\n. You are the best\n. The problem is I think that in\n\norg.holoeverywhere.internal.DialogTitle you extend android.widget.TextView (classical)\n\nbut when you are doing casting in Dialog AllertController you are using org.holoeverywhere.widget.TextView (holo)\n. calling super.setContentView() in the Dialog.setContentView() body seems to solve the problem\n. Will do, but for now I did it in an alternative way, so it isn't a priority.\n. I wouldn't put it here, if I haven't tried it without HE before. But there may be some issues with the core list view also.\nI am not using it anymore, so it is better as a closed issue. \n\nThanks for you time.\n. Alright, I ll try that, next time I come around the bug.\n\nThanks again.\n. Thanks, this works. Is there a reason setCanceledOnTouchOutside(false) doesn't work?\n. I see now, thanks again\n.

As if menu button click is not  propagated at all.\n. BTW, definetely caused by HE. \n\nTried to revert few commits and it is working again. Also it is easily reproductible on HE Demo project.\n. This error still occurs to me.\n\nTested on Galaxy S3. After pressing hardware menu button, application menu doesn't appear.\n.

Yes I use Holo.Theme.Light.DarkActionBar\n2. The SearchView is ActionBarSherlock library class, I cannot change it to include HoloEverywhere inflater.\n3. It was working, just recent changes caused it to stop working (maybe that can help you :))\n. Sorry, but this hasn't changed anything. \n\nEven when using getSupportActionBarContext, I get the same error (cannot inflate TextView).\n\nIt seems when I debug, that the method doesn't get even after the first null condition, so it doesn't return ContextThemeWrapperPlus\n. Alright, so the condition on which you decide whether to return ContextThemeWrapperPlus seems to be wrong, because if I run it with Holo.Theme.Light.DarkActionBar theme, it picks the first option, not the ContextThemeWrapperPlus option.\n\nThat is why it is still failing, please fix for future references.\n. I will try to implement it your way, like in the bug project. Sorry for constantly bugging you.\nThank you very much.\n. The thing is that it was working somewhere back, before too many commits :) \n\nAnother thing is that I get an impression that bug in ABS is more related to spinners and custom dropdown items.\nThat is working perfectly for me. I got problem only with \"Action overflow\" button.\n. +1 would be very helpful\n. same is happening to me\n. I found a workaround on stackoverflow\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/3519277/how-to-change-the-text-color-of-menu-item-in-android \n\nlook for the answer from Marcus Wolschon\n\nI am still looking for unwanted consequences :)\n.

For both licenses, you only need to say that you're using them and include the license.\nFor LGPL you need to give your changes back in case you change the library.\n. You should extend Holo.Theme (dark), Holo.Theme.Light or Holo.Theme.Light.DarkActionBar.\n. It would help to know which error. Do you have the ActionBarSherlock dependency added to your project?\n. You should check with the sample project what you have wrong in your code.\nIn ICS it works fine because ABS bypasses the calls since ICS already has the ActionBar.\n. I think it should work.

Just forget about it, eventually you'll move to Gradle.\nI already lost a lot of time with this.\nThanks anyway.\n. Still doesn't work for me. It's very strange because it works in the demo.\n. I'm closing the issue since getValue() returns the correct value if the user presses Enter after entering the value.\nSince there is not text watcher in the EditText, there is no way for the NumberPicker to know which number was introduced just by pressing the \"ok\" button.\n.

Sorry for wasting your time. Apparently I didn't have the latest version. \nI just did a pull and everything is working fine.\nThanks.\n. For both licenses, you only need to say that you're using them and include the license.\nFor LGPL you need to give your changes back in case you change the library.\n. You should extend Holo.Theme (dark), Holo.Theme.Light or Holo.Theme.Light.DarkActionBar.\n. It would help to know which error. Do you have the ActionBarSherlock dependency added to your project?\n. You should check with the sample project what you have wrong in your code.\nIn ICS it works fine because ABS bypasses the calls since ICS already has the ActionBar.\n. I think it should work. Add android:theme=\"@style/YourTheme\" to your activity in the Manifest.\n. Great! That would be awesome!\n. With some trouble I was able to build the project but it doesn't run.\nIt doesn't find the MainActivity inside the apk and Studio stopped launching the app after deploying.\nI'll just delete everything, uninstall Studio and start over once I have more time.\nThanks anyway for your help.\n. The resources need to be in the main project. Not in the library project.\n. Yes, it assembles with one command if the developer has ActionBarSherlock inside his local Maven repository because it's needed by HE.\n\"gradle build\" successfully builds the project and \"gradle installDebug\" builds and installs the apk of the demo project on the phone.

Ok, I've found the line of code that does not allow my view to resize when softkeyboard opens.\nIt's this one :\n\n```\n    // Android 2.* incorrect process FULLSCREEN flag when we are modify\n    // DecorView of Window. This hack using HoloEverywhere Slider\n    if (VERSION.SDK_INT >= VERSION_CODES.HONEYCOMB) {\n        ThemeManager.modify(ThemeManager.FULLSCREEN);\n    }\n```\n\nI've adopted the skeleton of the Holoeverywhere Demo for initial setup of the framework, so I've introduced the  DemoApplication class, which I declare in my AndroidManifest.xml with\n\n```\n   android:name=\".DemoApplication\"\n```\n\nAt runtime on my device (Android 4.1.1, 10\" tablet) I have this values :\n\nVERSION.SDK_INT =16\nVERSION_CODES.HONEYCOMB =11\n\nso I enter inside the if condition and the fullscreen is forced.\nAnd the view does not resize when soft keyboard opens.\n\nIs it correct to do that ?\nI've commented it out now , and everything went ok.\nWill I have some problems with Slider ? (I will reset it if needed....but if there is an issue, why isn't this line of code at the framework level ?)\n\nBut now my view resizes again\n\nBUT\n\nWhat I can notice now is that there are 2 new possible problems (in the same view, the login form),\n( but I'll look after them later, since now I've to go to sleep :-)  )\n\nI remember that I'm not modifying my code, I'm just introducing the framework, and I'm still at the first view, the login form, that contains 1 image (the logo), 2 EditText (username + password), 1 Button (submit)\n\nHere they are :\n\n1) when the apps start, the first EditText (username) automatically gets the focus (as before) and the softkeyboard opens (this was not happening before).\nThis when the app starts. I don't want it of course. I want the keyboard closed, as before.\n\nIn the declaration of the activity I use in fact :\n\n```\n   android:windowSoftInputMode=\"stateUnchanged|adjustResize\"\n```\n\nso, what's the difference from before ?\n\n2) the ImageView : when the soft keyboard is closed, I display a logo of 800x300, when the soft keyboard is open I display a smaller logo of 500x187 (I alternate two different views using the ViewSwitcher ).\nWithout holoeverywhere the switch is visually ok (\"smooth\" resize).\nWith holoeverywhere the switch produces weird flickering / flashing effects.\n(especially in the switch from \"keyboard open\" to \"keyboard closed\", that is from the 500x187 image to the 800x300 image)\nWithout holoeverywhere it does not happen.\n\nI do not want them of course.\nIt's the first screen of my app.\n\nWhat's happening ?\nThe new superclass from which my activity now extends (org.holoeverywhere.app.Activity) is doing something that can cause this effect ?\n\nBut I go to sleep now....\nIf needed I'll open 2 new issues\n(if you don't have already the answers for me.....)\n\nThanks again\n\nMaxj\n. An update about the 2 \"new\" issues I talked about in my previous post.\n\n1) softkeyboard opens automatically at launch :\nSOLVED\nMy fault, I was looking at the wrong xml layout :-)\n\n2) weird flickering / flashing effects :\nNOT SOLVED, I bypassed it with a workaround\n\nI think there is a problem using a viewswitcher with holoeverywhere (but I can be wrong of course)\nI had to rewrite my login form to eliminate the use of the viewswitcher .\n\nWith the viewswitcher  switching 2 views containing an image, I had flickering / flashing effects, with the image moving quickly up and down at the moment of the switch.\nSome strange \"repainting\" or \"re-positioning\" effects are being triggered at the moment of the switch.\n\nI can produce a quick prototype if needed (can I upload it somewhere ?), I'll open a separate issue as soon as I'll be able to.\n. Yes, pls provide it. The library is wonderful, but with no docs it's very difficult to understand how you must do things right, when the bug is in the framework or is yours, what you can do and what you cannot do\n. Yes.\nThe hierarchy is as below (see the xml snippet)\nInside the LinearLayout there is also a TableLayout.\nYou can omit the ViewSwitcher I think.\nI'm re-writing again the view from zero to understand where the problem is, I'm getting crazy !!\nthanks\n\nps\nit's a login form, with username and password fields and submit button\n\n```\n  <ViewSwitcher\n    xmlns:holo=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto\"\n    xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n    android:id=\"@+id/profileSwitcher\"\n    android:layout_width=\"fill_parent\"\n   android:layout_height=\"fill_parent\">\n\n      <ScrollView\n        android:id=\"@+id/scrollview\"\n        android:layout_width=\"fill_parent\"\n        android:layout_height=\"fill_parent\"\n           android:isScrollContainer=\"true\" >\n\n\n            <LinearLayout\n                android:layout_gravity=\"center\"\n                android:orientation=\"vertical\"\n                android:layout_width=\"fill_parent\"\n                android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"  >\n\n                 <!-- now imageview and tablelayout are at the same level-->\n\n                  <ImageView\n                    android:layout_marginLeft=\"@dimen/firstPicLeft\"\n                    android:layout_marginRight=\"@dimen/firstPicRight\"\n                    android:layout_marginBottom=\"0.0dip\"\n                    android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"\n                    android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n                    android:layout_gravity=\"center\"\n                    android:src=\"@drawable/logo_transparent_01\" />\n\n                 <!-- tablelayout contains 3 rows : 2 EditText and 1 Button -->\n                <TableLayout\n                    android:id=\"@+id/tableLayout1\"\n                    android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"\n                    android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n                    android:layout_gravity=\"center\"\n                    android:layout_marginTop=\"@dimen/loginTableTop\"\n                    >\n\n                       <TableRow\n                            android:id=\"@+id/tableRow2\"\n                            android:layout_width=\"fill_parent\"\n                            android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\" >\n\n\n                                   <EditText\n                                    android:minWidth=\"450.0dip\"\n                                    android:id=\"@+id/new_account_email_1\"\n                                    android:layout_marginTop=\"@dimen/loginTextTop\"\n                                    android:layout_marginBottom=\"@dimen/loginTextBottom\"\n                                    android:maxLines=\"1\"\n                                    android:scrollHorizontally=\"true\"\n                                    android:inputType=\"textEmailAddress\"\n                                    android:hint=\"@string/login_email_prompt\"\n                                    android:imeOptions=\"actionNext|flagNoExtractUi\" />\n\n\n                        </TableRow>\n\n                                (and so on....)\n\n\n                </TableLayout>          \n\n            </LinearLayout>\n\n    </ScrollView>\n```\n\n</ViewSwitcher>\n. Ok, I've found the line of code that does not allow my view to resize when softkeyboard opens.\nIt's this one :\n\n```\n    // Android 2.* incorrect process FULLSCREEN flag when we are modify\n    // DecorView of Window. This hack using HoloEverywhere Slider\n    if (VERSION.SDK_INT >= VERSION_CODES.HONEYCOMB) {\n        ThemeManager.modify(ThemeManager.FULLSCREEN);\n    }\n```\n\nI've adopted the skeleton of the Holoeverywhere Demo for initial setup of the framework, so I've introduced the  DemoApplication class, which I declare in my AndroidManifest.xml with\n\n```\n   android:name=\".DemoApplication\"\n```\n\nAt runtime on my device (Android 4.1.1, 10\" tablet) I have this values :\n\nVERSION.SDK_INT =16\nVERSION_CODES.HONEYCOMB =11\n\nso I enter inside the if condition and the fullscreen is forced.\nAnd the view does not resize when soft keyboard opens.\n\nIs it correct to do that ?\nI've commented it out now , and everything went ok.\nWill I have some problems with Slider ? (I will reset it if needed....but if there is an issue, why isn't this line of code at the framework level ?)\n\nBut now my view resizes again\n\nBUT\n\nWhat I can notice now is that there are 2 new possible problems (in the same view, the login form),\n( but I'll look after them later, since now I've to go to sleep :-)  )\n\nI remember that I'm not modifying my code, I'm just introducing the framework, and I'm still at the first view, the login form, that contains 1 image (the logo), 2 EditText (username + password), 1 Button (submit)\n\nHere they are :\n\n1) when the apps start, the first EditText (username) automatically gets the focus (as before) and the softkeyboard opens (this was not happening before).\nThis when the app starts.

You are right, the fault didn't lie with holoeverywhere :  \nI thought that the big 1MB bitmap that I discovered in MAT was a memory leak, but it was actually an android system bitmap (shared by the zygotte process) to provide a nice background for the listviews. Those stackoverflow thread made this clear : \nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/18594576/android-edgeeffect-appears-to-allocate-a-1-meg-bitmap\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/18515647/strange-bitmap-using-1-mb-of-heap \n. Thanks for this great piece of work. It really helped me and a lot of other people out there.\n. Is there a way to make the Holoeverywhere plugin work with gradle plugin \n0.10, 0.11, 0.12 ?\n\nI would still like to be able to use holoeverywhere a little while with \nintellij idea with target 19\nBecause Material phones aren't going to be available and to represent a \nsignificant % for a while yet\nAnd in the mean time, we are stuck with 4.0/4.1/4.2....\n\nI can still compile it with intellij idea 13.1 and gradle 0.9 in the \nworst case\n\nOn 06/28/2014 08:02 PM, Christophe Versieux wrote:\n\n> Good luck at the university.\n> \n> I will maybe start something before official L if I got free time.\n> The only thing I would like to avoid is to override Activity or Fragment\n> and keep an XML only approach to avoid messing with system.\n> Let's see what we can do..\n> On Jun 28, 2014 7:40 PM, \"Sergey Shatunov\" notifications@github.com \n> wrote:\n> \n> > MaterialEverywhere sounds cool - let's keep brand! :)\n> > I have plans to provide some compability support for custom \n> > inflaters for\n> > layouts/drawables and also backport shadow effects, but I'll begin work\n> > only after final L release.

Personnatly, after 1 month I couldn't wait anymore and switched to the official AppCompat lib. \nIt took me 2~3 days and 2000 compilation errors to fix but now it works just fine. \nRemoving all holoeverywhere imports fixed like 1000+ compilations error then you have to fix a few issues (not that much)  : \nFragmentActivity or ActionBarctivity instead of Activity\nStyle must inherit from Material theme instead of Holo...\nid for preferences -> key string (use the makeKeyFromId method from holoeverywhere and use your id name as a key string)\ngetSupportActionBar\ngetSupportFragmentManager\nprefix by app: instead of android: for menuItem\n...\nhope it helps...\n\nI take this opportunity to again give my thanks for Holoeverywhere : \nFor a long time, Google released lots of android version and Holoeverywhere was the only library that allowed us to have consistent themes/behavior on all those versions. It was doing the job that appCompat is doing now... Damn google for taking so long to release a support library as good as Holoeverywhere (and praise to Prototik, ChristopheVersieux & cie) \n. I got that same issue with plugin 2.16 and holoeverywhere snapshot, from a user with a HTC 3D evo, with Android 4.4 (a custom rom ? ) and a IOS7 theme\n\nIs it my fault ?

You are right, the fault didn't lie with holoeverywhere :  \nI thought that the big 1MB bitmap that I discovered in MAT was a memory leak, but it was actually an android system bitmap (shared by the zygotte process) to provide a nice background for the listviews. Those stackoverflow thread made this clear : \nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/18594576/android-edgeeffect-appears-to-allocate-a-1-meg-bitmap\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/18515647/strange-bitmap-using-1-mb-of-heap \n. Thanks for this great piece of work. It really helped me and a lot of other people out there.\n. Is there a way to make the Holoeverywhere plugin work with gradle plugin \n0.10, 0.11, 0.12 ?\n\nI would still like to be able to use holoeverywhere a little while with \nintellij idea with target 19\nBecause Material phones aren't going to be available and to represent a \nsignificant % for a while yet\nAnd in the mean time, we are stuck with 4.0/4.1/4.2....\n\nI can still compile it with intellij idea 13.1 and gradle 0.9 in the \nworst case\n\nOn 06/28/2014 08:02 PM, Christophe Versieux wrote:\n\n> Good luck at the university.\n> \n> I will maybe start something before official L if I got free time.\n> The only thing I would like to avoid is to override Activity or Fragment\n> and keep an XML only approach to avoid messing with system.\n> Let's see what we can do..\n> On Jun 28, 2014 7:40 PM, \"Sergey Shatunov\" notifications@github.com \n> wrote:\n> \n> > MaterialEverywhere sounds cool - let's keep brand! :)\n> > I have plans to provide some compability support for custom \n> > inflaters for\n> > layouts/drawables and also backport shadow effects, but I'll begin work\n> > only after final L release.

Personnatly, after 1 month I couldn't wait anymore and switched to the official AppCompat lib. \nIt took me 2~3 days and 2000 compilation errors to fix but now it works just fine. \nRemoving all holoeverywhere imports fixed like 1000+ compilations error then you have to fix a few issues (not that much)  : \nFragmentActivity or ActionBarctivity instead of Activity\nStyle must inherit from Material theme instead of Holo...\nid for preferences -> key string (use the makeKeyFromId method from holoeverywhere and use your id name as a key string)\ngetSupportActionBar\ngetSupportFragmentManager\nprefix by app: instead of android: for menuItem\n...\nhope it helps...\n\nI take this opportunity to again give my thanks for Holoeverywhere : \nFor a long time, Google released lots of android version and Holoeverywhere was the only library that allowed us to have consistent themes/behavior on all those versions. It was doing the job that appCompat is doing now... Damn google for taking so long to release a support library as good as Holoeverywhere (and praise to Prototik, ChristopheVersieux & cie) \n. ",

This issue is present in Android source code too.\nShould I make a pull request, or you will make the fix yourself?

    "davidp3": "I just found this bug as I was going to enter one of my own.  I have not yet checked the 'abc' branch... I've been trying to build 'master', which is currently fubar (as you mentioned in another bug related to this).  I will check 'abc'.\n\nThe OP is correct.  The problem appears to be related to bug #469.  Apparently, TabSwipeActivity was fixed on Jun 13th and then broken again by a Jun 17th checkin that introduced the AddonTabber stuff.  This appears in the latest release.  The TabSwipeActivity in that version never calls onHandleTabs().  It doesn't help to move the addTab() calls from onHandleTabs() to, say, onCreate, because this produces an error about not being able to add the addon after the Activity was init-ed.  So the window is blank (no tab bar or tab fragments). \n. Update: The abc branch seems to have been abandoned...\n. OK, I've got a super-cheap workaround for anyone who had the same issue.  The deal is that AddonTabber is not constructed before onCreate(), as the framework seems to expect.  But you can get there without touching the HoloEverywhere code.  Just create a (parameterless) constructor for your TabSwipeActivity subclass (or your TabSwipeFragment subclass... although I don't know if that one is broken).  In the constructor, call:\n`addonTabber()`.  That's it!  This will register the class and then your tabs will appear.\n. I'd do that but I can't get trunk to build (not in Eclipse or on command line).  The code has moved on (a lot) from the latest release so I don't even know if the issue is still there.  I'll set up a pull request once I can build and test it.\n. I just found this bug as I was going to enter one of my own.  I have not yet checked the 'abc' branch... I've been trying to build 'master', which is currently fubar (as you mentioned in another bug related to this).  I will check 'abc'.\n\nThe OP is correct.  The problem appears to be related to bug #469.  Apparently, TabSwipeActivity was fixed on Jun 13th and then broken again by a Jun 17th checkin that introduced the AddonTabber stuff.  This appears in the latest release.  The TabSwipeActivity in that version never calls onHandleTabs().
