A recent major update should have fixed most problems with the grid.\n. @csswizardry thanks, Harry! I'm currently working through my old projects and giving them a refresh, and Toast isn't far off the horizon. Expect a complete rehaul. This has been noted and will be resolved in the next big update. I'll leave the issue open just in case I forget, though!\n. Closing this issue. The recent update removes Normalize.css and uses a simpler and less specific reset.\n. I appreciate the tip, but I'm trying to keep Toast as simple to use as possible, and adding a requirement for users to comment all whitespace between grid modules will be painful for them to keep up.\n. Hey there!\n\nI\u2019m glad you brought this up, because it is something I\u2019ve become aware of as a nagging issue in my mind. The short answer is: I have a new grid system in a CSS file somewhere on my computer. I like it, but I\u2019m scared current Toast users won\u2019t. There are a few issues I want to iron out, and an _awful_ lot of other things going on in my world that are delaying progress. But yes; it\u2019s coming.\n\nPretty long short answer, right?\n\nThe long answer is that over the last year or so, I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that almost all frameworks are just _outright inappropriate and bloated_ for most if not all projects. Design isn\u2019t something to be rushed or shoehorned; if you can take the time to create a grid system for each project, then you should do. That said, I understand the need for CSS frameworks, and I also understand my responsibility as one of the people who popped up and said \"Hey, I made one of those too!\" to maintain a project like this.\n\nThe new grid system is highly simplified. We\u2019re talking one fifth, one third, one half grid systems as opposed to \"x-of-twelve\". Bigger columns in favour of smaller units. A brief explanation of the difference between those two is available [here](http://daneden.me/grids). Toast has always been a prototyping tool in my own mind; the next version will hopefully go a little beyond that _because_ of it\u2019s fogginess in grid systems. A less precise grid means users will be more inclined to write their own grids (ideal scenario) or at least stop people from overthinking grids.\n\nTo summarise, I\u2019m sorry for the delay; the next version is coming. But it\u2019s a big change.\n\np.s. Here and now would be a good time for people to suggest things they want to see added, changed, or removed.\n. Update; the new version is here!\n. Hi there,\n\nThis looks like a Jekyll blog. Are you recompiling the files after changing the CSS file name and location?\n. Toast.css is designed to be a base from which to work towards a more customised design. It comes with its own classes and (very) simple styles, but it isn\u2019t a striaght-up replacement for a CSS file.\n. Well spotted. Thanks!\n. Normalize throws out the baseline because it comes with its own margins, line-heights, and other spacing factors. If I were you, I'd try including normalize before Toast, or removing the conflicting CSS from either normalize or Toast as required.\n. Solved in 82f2738d68bb700fb5aa187d715afcaf98fee83e\n. @iamvery Toast has changed a lot since this was opened! Now, the only thing in here is the grid. It's a bring-your-own-everything-except-layout framework :)\n. I'm not sure I follow. Would you mind making a gist to demonstrate the problem you're experiencing?\n. Gotcha. You can nest grids by putting the columns in a nested `.grid`:\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/daneden/8956845\n. Mostly for simplicity\u2019s sake. If I included both options, it\u2019d be introducing complexity from both a maintenance standpoint (on my end) and an implementation standpoint (the user/author using Toast).\n. Sadly, getting a 403 on `bower register`:\n\n``` bash\nbower resolve       git://github.com/daneden/Toast.git#*\nbower download      https://github.com/daneden/Toast/archive/1.0.0.tar.gz\nbower extract       toast#* archive.tar.gz\nbower invalid-meta  toast is missing \"ignore\" entry in bower.json\nbower resolved      git://github.com/daneden/Toast.git#1.0.0\n[?] Registering a package will make it installable via the registry (https://bower.herokuapp.com), continue?

Not sure what difference this is making. With `box-sizing: border-box`, you can use percentage-width gutters, and I can\u2019t see how `percentage(1 / 2)` is different to the function you\u2019re using.\n. It\u2019s a hack workaround for the whitespace that `inline-block` elements get. .25em is approximately equal to the width of a word space.\n\nKnown issue. When I feel confident in a flexbox version of Toast, this will no longer be an issue.\n. Stupid Dropbox.\n. Yup.\n. @ofagbemi if you wouldn\u2019t mind updating the variables to `$toast-whatever` in this PR, that\u2019d be great! :)\n. ![](http://gif.daneden.me/sniff-thx.gif)\n. Done! Sorry for the delay.\n. Toast is going to remain a Sass/SCSS library only, I\u2019m afraid!\n. Nice work! If you compile the CSS to update the `css` directory, I\u2019ll happily merge this.\n. It\u2019s there for a reason\u2014setting the columns to `display: inline-block` means that they honor the whitespace in markup, putting regular word spaces between each column. The negative margin is there to counter the whitespace.\n\nHowever, if you delete the whitespace in your markup (or if it\u2019s never present\u2014for instance, React eliminates whitespace in its rendered components), then the negative margin is problematic.\n\nOne fix is to add a modifier to the grid container to remove whitespace from the columns:\n\n``` scss\n.o-grid--no-whitespace {\n  .o-grid__col {\n    margin-right: 0;\n  }\n}\n```\n. 1.
