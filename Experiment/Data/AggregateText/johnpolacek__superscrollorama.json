Hi!\n\nSorry for the late reply.\nDid you find a solution for your issue by now?\n\nregards,\nJan\n. A removeTween, removePin method will be added in future updates.\nDestroying the Superscrollorama instance itself should not be necessary.\n. I just added removeTween and removePin. See documentation for details. :)\n\nHope this helps.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Now you can use the method \"setOffsetPosition\".\n. Please try again with current version and let us know if the issue perisists.\n. Hi - It should be possible. Just prevent the respective links from jumping to the anchors and scroll smoothly to them using the TweenMax scrollTo Plugin.\nhttp://api.greensock.com/js/com/greensock/plugins/ScrollToPlugin.html\n. Hi! The plugin was just updated to help you get it working on iOS.\nCheck out the new mobile_demo! :)\n. Hi! I think the main reason for your performance issues is that you use jquery animate to scroll a quite large container.\nTry using the TweenMax scrollTo plugin to get better performance. http://api.greensock.com/js/com/greensock/plugins/ScrollToPlugin.html\n. Hi Aston and thank you for your message.\nThe reason for this phenomenon I believe to be the following:\nIt stop's working at the PIN IT section, when using the scrollbar.\nIn the current version of superscrollorama we introduced a new variable \"pushFollowers\" for pins, that defaults to true, reflecting the previous behaviour.\nWhen superscrollorama reaches a point where something needs to be pinned a spacer is expanded to \"push down\" following elements. This results in a change of the scale of the scrollbar.\nYou can observe this by looking at the scrollbar's size, when scrolling down using the mouswheel.\nThis change in scale, when reaching the pin-point results in a jump, as you are dragging the scrollbar.\n\nI already talked with John about a solution to this. To my mind the solution would be that the spacer should be expanded right from the beginning for pinned elements that \"push\" followers.\nThe reason we didn't implement this is that is rather complicated.\nFirst of all the spacer size changes, depending wether it should include the pinned element's size (when pinned) or not (when pinned). Secondly the spacer's position within the dom must change. (after the pin element, when before pinning, before the pin element after pinning.) And this in turn raises another issue as the spacer is also used to \"remember\" the original position of the pinned element.\n\nYou see we are aware of this issue and are considering how to resolve it. A solution could be to add another spacer after the pinned element, but we'd like to avoid adding elements to the dom if it's possible.\n\nFor now you can avoid this \"bug\" by setting \"pushFollowers\" to false and adding a large enough container after the pinned element. This way the body size doesn't change and you avoid the bug alltogether.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Good news, everyone! :)\n\nA solution might be near! Check it out: https://github.com/johnpolacek/superscrollorama/issues/94\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Brad,\n\nOn my console there's an error showing up on line 1931:\n-> var sw = splash.getStyle('width').toInt();\n\nThe line before you define splash to be var splash = $('jxtc51572c046130fspop');\nI think you meant to write var splash = $('#jxtc51572c046130fspop');\n\nThere are several more errors popping up for showcaseFX.js.\n\nThese errors might interfere with the code execution and prevent the scrolloramacode to be executed alltogether.\nplease try to get rid of all errors and if it still doesn't work I'll have a look again.\nI suggest you use chrome and look at the javascript console. (View -> developers -> javascript console)\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Steven,\n\nyou are correct. We overlooked this in the updated Marcy made, when she made the reverse option global.\nI'll update this right now (as it is an easy fix) and it will be pulled to the main repo asap.\n\nThank you for your help.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Damon,\n\nare you talking about pins or regular animations?\nWith pins it's possible, with animation not yet.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Damon,\n\nyes, to my mind it is useful for the same reasons I included the updatePin method.\nTo be honest the reason why I didn't build an updateTween method yet is because I didn't need it ;-).\nWe'll see, when John or I get around to implementing this...\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Damon,\n\nIf It's solely a vertical positioning issue you should try to work with percentages as left position values.\nI'll let you know once I got around to implement the updateTween method.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi jlevinsohn,\n\nactually I am sorry that I have made no progress in this regard. I just came back from my honeymoon and am quite busy now. I might get around to do it his month, but no promises. :-/\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Good news, everyone! :)\n\nA solution might be near! Check it out: https://github.com/johnpolacek/superscrollorama/issues/94\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi inamine,\n\nDo you mean for Superscrollorama or for ScrollMagic?\nFor Superscrollorama you can find an example on the [Demo Page](http://johnpolacek.github.io/superscrollorama/).\n(see the updatePin method).\nFor [ScrollMagic](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic) I didn't get around yet to make any examples or demos, because it is still in development.\nBut it's a lot more intuitive than Superscrollorama in regard to runtime updates.\nBasically you initiate like this:\n\n``` javascript\nvar controller = new ScrollMagic();\nvar scene = controller.addScene(\"#trigger\", {duration: 400, offset: -200})\n                      .pin(\"#pinelement\");\n```\n\nand then at any point in time you can do this:\n\n``` javascript\nscene.duration(600);\n```\n\nor this:\n\n``` javascript\nscene.offset(-100);\n```\n\nhope this helps!\nbest regards,\nJ\n. Hi Steven,\n\nI think the cleaner solution for this would be a \"removeTween\" method.\nThere should also be a removePin as well, I'll put it on my todo list, but don't know when I'll get around to do it...\n\nregards,\nJan\n. I just added removeTween and removePin. See documentation for details. :)\n\nHope this helps.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. To my mind it is in the code, because up until recently superscrollorama didn't work if you would have jumped past a pin or animation using an anchor link. It might also be there to trigger the first position check.\n\nI also stumbled over this line and I think it can be removed and \"doUpdateOnNextTick\" should be set to true from the start to init the first position check.\n. I decided to remove this line from the code.\nThis line really has nothing to do what superscrollorama is supposed to do and so might be a surprising side-effect to people using it.\nIf the user wants to do a forced scroll to top at page load he should do it outside of superscrollorama.\nIf not superscrollorama calculates the correct animation and pin states/positions, even if the page is loaded with an anchor link or refreshed having scrolled down.\nSo there's really no reason to keep the line.\n\nHope you agree, @johnpolacek?\n. Hi!\nHave a look into the greensock documentation, specifically the \"onStart\" param.\nhttp://api.greensock.com/js/com/greensock/TweenMax.html\nRegards,\nJan\n. Oh, now I think I understand what you're trying to do.\nSadly there is no onReverse callback in TweenMax.\nThe way I would approach it is this way:\nSet a global Variable named \"isRunning\" to false.\nPut a function at onStart and onComplete.\nIn it, check if \"isRunning\" is true.\nCase1: it's false: Set it to true, then execute your desired function.\nCase2: It's true: set it to false\n\nlet me know if that is your desired outcome.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi superflat, welcome to jquery and superscrollorama ;).\n\nI am not quite sure what you want to achieve.\nWhen you scroll back up the animation automatically reverses, but I guess that's not what yo're looking for.\nAs I understand you want to keep scrolling down and at a certain point reverse the animation.\n\nThere's two solutions for that:\nEither you just ad two tweens using superscrollorama, one going to your target position and one going back to the original. You just define different offsets for them.\n\nThe other is using TimelineMax.\nJust create a new TimelineMax Object, and add two TweenMax Objects to it (one going to x, one going back).\nThen add the TimelineMax Object using superscrollorama.\nCheck greensock Docs for more info: http://api.greensock.com/js/com/greensock/TimelineLite.html#add()\n\nhope that helps.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hey again,\n\nin TweenMax there are (among other ways) three major ways to do animations.\nusing .to, using .from and using .fromTo\n\nusing .to you define target values and TweenMax animates the object from its current state to the target.\nusing .from TweenMax takes the current state as the target and animates from your values to this original state.\nusing .fromTo you can define start and target values for your tween.\n\nIn your case just build a second tween where the target is the original position of your element. Then add that tween to superscrollorama at a higher offset point than the first.\n\nHave a deeper look into TweenMax, it's really quite brilliant.\nhttp://api.greensock.com/js/\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi!\n\nIt's kinda difficult to answer your questions without having seen the code.\nLet's see if I may understand correctly. though.\nIf you scroll a scrollcontainer using iScroll and in that container there is an element that is fixed, it will be scrolled out of view. The reason for that is the same why I described the pinned elements require a workaround.\nIt is due to a bug when using webkit-transform and fixed child elements.\nSee the [mobile docs](http://johnpolacek.github.com/superscrollorama/simpledemo_mobile.html) for details.\n\nAs far as I understand it there are two solutions for your problem:\n1st: (probably the better one) place your fixed item outside of the scrollwrapper. If it's supposed to be fixed all the time anyway this shouldn't be a problem.\n2nd: change useTransform to false for iScroll, as described in the mobile docs. But if you already fighting performance issues this might not be a good way to go...\n\nhope this helps.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Not sure, what you mean about the animations beeing forcefully updated, but if you don't use iScroll I am sure it won't run smoothly on mobile devices, as you can't use requestAnimationFrame to do the animation updates.\nI would again recommend to read the mobile docs very carefully.\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n. Hi Steven,\nI rushed to see if the pins were accidentally broken, but as you can see on the demo pages the pins are still working.\nWhen you update your pins (I think you meant to write updatePin) remember that it's position may be defined by the tween you passed. (should you tween its position).\n\nregardless: I can't find any errors in the superscrollorama code.\nIf come to the conclusion that it is the reason for your project breaking, please send me a demo link.\n\nI will be gone from the computer until sunday though.\n. Hi Steven,\n\nif this turns out to really be an issue with the new version I'd of course like to resolve it.\nSo if it's possible for you please prepare a demo where I can see the error (or it not working) and send me a link.\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n. Hi Kahla and welcome to the wonderful world of jQuery.\nPlease set up a demo page and send us the link so we can see your project.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi kahla,\n\nsorry for the late reply, i was quite busy.\nI think the error might be in line 50.\nYou are supposed to pass a reference object that is supposed to be pinned to the method.\nInstead you pass $().\nPut the animation you want to do in a wrapper and then pin this wrapper by passing it to the function.\nPlease read the documentation carefully for further details.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi wezyr, welcome.\n\nHow I go about these things is I take out the pin part and just add the tween. Then I check out the site and watch if the animation runs smoothly. If it doesn't it obviously has nothing to do with superscrollorama, but with TweenMax.\nI also suspect this to be the case here.\nSo please try to just get the animation working and when it does add it to the pin.\nIf it works in FF but breaks when you pin it, please write again.\nIf not please seek help in the [GSAP Support Forum](http://forums.greensock.com/forum/11-animation-tweening-js/).\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi JeffM and welcome,\n\nI'm not quite sure what you mean by a fallback preset. Do you care to elaborate?\n\nAs to your code it looks good on the first glance.\nI have suggested previously that a good way of debugging is just defining the tween without adding it to superscrollorama. Then check accross all browsers if the animation runs as expected. If not the fault lies with TweenMax and should be discussed in its [forums](http://forums.greensock.com/forum/11-animation-tweening-js/).\nIf the error only occurs in Superscrollorama I'd like to ask you to provide a demo link where I can have a look at the issue.\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n. Hi!\nThis is a decision @johnpolacek will have to make...\nWe'll see.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi!\nThank you for your input.\nThere are still some small issues I haven't got around to attend to (see open issues).\nOnce I do I will update the tag to 1.1.0\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Youri,\n\nsadly I don't have much time to look much into tweenlitemousewheel.\nBut taking a guess it scrolls the page content inside a container rather than scrolling the page itself. That would explain why the page scroll event doesn't fire (and thus superscrollorama doesn't get updated).\n\nPlease try this:\nLook at the \"setScrollContainerOffset\" method of superscrollorama in the [documentation](http://johnpolacek.github.io/superscrollorama/).\nThen add a function that fires on Move or Update or whatever tweenlitemouswheel probably fires constantly and update the scroll position manually.\n\nhope this helps :)\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n. Hi Gagarine,\n\nI saw that John already accepted your pull request. So the update is already in the code...\nThank you for contributing.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Simon,\n\nsorry for the misunderstanding.\n\nOkay in general I think it's preferable to avoid unnecessary calls instead of replacing the offset function.\nBut this is a very delicate subject and sometimes a call is needed for the right values.\nPlease make your changes and send a pull request.\n\nI will then go over your changes and make sure there will be no unexpected behaviour for other users.\n\nthank you and regards,\nJan\n. Hi Cezar,\n\nyes they can, but with some limitations.\nThey can only be pinned directly if they have no set value for their top position. It's a bit complicated to explain but long story short here's how you can make it work:\n\nEither have the positioning set to auto or wrap it inside another div that is positioned auto and pin that. The result should be the same. The outer div can be positioned relative or absolute (with top=auto).\n\nI have a list of examples of the ways elements can be pinned. I will post it in the near future.\n\nI hope that helps.\n\nregards,\nJan\n\nP.S.: Sorry for the late answer, I was on vacation.\n. Hi damassi,\n\nI think this comment was actually intended for a different question.\nI will copy it there.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Zach,\n\nI'm afraid this is a browser issue rather than a superscrollorama issue.\nYou can try to set overflow:hidden to the respective element, this might cause the browser to realize the contents of the div is not scrollable.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nregards,\nJan\n\nP.S.: Sorry for the late answer, I was on vacation.\n. Thank you Jojo, for your help.\n\nregards,\nJan\n\nP.S.: Sorry for the late answer, I was on vacation.\n. Hi Lenny,\n\nI hope I understand your question correctly.\nHere's what I would do:\nJust add two separate Animations to your object.\nFirst starts at 0 and scrolls for 1000 pixels and the second at 3000 (1000 + 2000 of standing still).\n\nHope this helps.\n\nregards,\nJan\n\nP.S.: Sorry for the late answer, I was on vacation.\n. Hi Alex,\n\nI have an idea: Do you call the removePin before the element has been pinned at least once?\n\nregards,\nJan\n\nP.S.: Sorry for the late answer, I was on vacation.\n. Hi Alex, not so fast with the closing :)\n\nDo you think we should fix this? So that there will be no type error even when the remove is called before pinning once? I kinda think so...\n\nregards,\nJan\n. It's on my todo list. :)\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Alex,\n\nThe fix is included in ScrollMagic: https://github.com/johnpolacek/superscrollorama/issues/94\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Aendrew,\n\nhere's how I would approach this:\nInstead of using the normal tween functions of TweenMax make a function where you pass the current tween value.\nInside this function you can have an if clause where you can check if the user is scrolling using a button or by himself. \nIf by himself animate you relement to the respective point.\nFor more information about tweening custom props using a function see this example:\nhttp://ahrengot.com/tutorials/greensock-javascript-animation/#animating-custom-properties\n\nHope this helps.\n\nregards,\nJan\n\nP.S.: Sorry for the late answer, I was on vacation.\n. Hi Gagarin,\n\nplease provide a demo of this bug.\nThank you.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Ho do you think we should implement a general fix for this into superscrollorama?\n. Hi @techiesplus13,\n\nI think what you're describing is a situation I described at length here: https://github.com/johnpolacek/superscrollorama/issues/29\n\nThe workaround for now is set push-followers to false and add an element that is high enough to pass the pin.\n\nIs this the same issue you were describing @gagarine?\nUntil now I thought you meant something else...\n\nlg J\n. No, that is wrong. It merely means that the elements that are below the pinned element will not be pushed down for the duration of the pin. that means if you don't have a big enough spacer you will scroll past the elements that come after the pinned one.\n. Both statements are correct! :)\nand we will...\n. Hi,\n\nI took a rough look and It's difficult to figure out what even happens there.\nTry to disable superscrollorama and see how the page behaves without it. (I suspect some errors in the dom, cause at the start there is a horizontal scroll bar).\nIf you have further questions please start a new issue, as your problems are usage questions and now about the bug described by @gagarine.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Good news, everyone! :)\n\nA solution might be near! Check it out: https://github.com/johnpolacek/superscrollorama/issues/94\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Do you pin something right from the start?\nIf so, make sure the trigger position is not a negative value.\n\nThis could happen if for example you have triggerAtCenter set to true and the pin element is positioned at the top of the body.\nSo if you start scrolling the script realizes \"wait a sec - i should have been pinned for a while\" and jumps to the center.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi Guys,\n\nI'm closing all bug issues for Superscrollorama because it has been superceeded by ScrollMagic.\nhttps://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic\n\nPlease check if updating helps fix your problem.\nIf not, please post a new issue in the ScrollMagic issue section.\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n. Hi pnick,\n\nSure you can - you can have more than one active pin at once. There should be no problem.\nIf your problem is that #page2 does not scroll up before the pin ends that means that you have \"pushFollowers\" set to true.\nThe solution is to make the space between the two manually. This means, make #page1, then a spacer (say 1000px height) and then #page2.\nThen make the Pin for #page1 2000px long and be sure to set \"pushFollowers\" to false \u2013> voila.\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n. You're welcome!\n\nIf you make something cool, be sure to send us the URL! :)\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi vossavant,\n\nthe way I would aproach this is by pinning it, without animating it. Then animate it using addTween, but set the Tween duration to 0, which will result in it not beeing linked to the scroll speed. It will always play out at the same speed you set using TweenMax.\nThe user will still skip it when he scrolls past the pin area, but the animation speed should be fine.\nAnd personally I wouldn't restrict your user beeing able to scroll until he saw all your animation. If he doesn't want to see it, he doesn't want to see it. If he does, he'll go back up. :)\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Github user [damassi](https://github.com/damassi) also posted this solution (accidentally on the wrong question, but it might help you.\n\nThere actually is a way to do this, but its kinda crazy.  (Excuse the pseudocode.)\n\n```\nvar controller = $.superscrollorama({\n    triggerAtCenter: true,\n    playoutAnimations: false,\n    reverse: false\n});\n\nvar pos\n\n// prevent the user from scrolling anywhere\nfunction onScroll() { \n      if( $(document).scrollTop() > pos )\n          $(document).scrollTop( pos )\n      })\n}\n\nvar timeline = new TimelineMax()\n\ntimeline.append( TweenMax.to( $('#hi', 3, { y: 1000, onComplete: function() {\n    // Release the window and continue on\n    $(document).off( 'scroll', onScroll )\n}}))\n\ncontroller.pin($('#hi'), 3000, {\n    anim: timeline,\n\n   onPin: function() {\n        // Store the current window position\n        var pos = $(document).scrollTop()\n\n       // Start listening to scroll events\n       $(document).on('scroll', onScroll )\n\n        // remove the pin so that it will pick up changes\n        controller.removePin( '#plushupper-tagline' )\n\n       // Start listening to mousewheel events\n       $(window).bind('mousewheel', function(event) {\n         // scrolling up\n             if (event.originalEvent.wheelDelta >= 0) {\n                 timeline.time( timeline.time() -= .1 )\n             }\n\n             // scrolling down\n             else {\n                  timeline.time( timeline.time() += .1 )\n             }\n      });\n    }\n});\n```\n. Hi eppel,\n\nwelcome. I am sorry to tell you that this is a rather advanced plugin.\nBefore you start playing around with it you should familiarize yourself with jQuery and TweenMax or this won't be the last roadblock you hit.\nYour sample code would actually be working - it would fade out a div with the id \"y\", once you scroll past it.\nSo what you need in your DOM for any kind of effect is a div like this:\n`<div id=\"y\">I will be faded out</div>`\n\nHope this helps,\nJan\n. Hi Eppel,\n\nI'm not really sure what you mean by \"a scroll line as the target\". Can you clarify?\nIf it's a superscrollorama related issue I'd be happy to help.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Eppel,\n\nthere actually is an example, right below the documentation of \"addTween\".\nThere it says:\n\u00b4\u00b4\u00b4\ncontroller.addTween('#fade', \n        TweenMax.from($('#fade'), .5, {css:{opacity:0}}));\n\u00b4\u00b4\u00b4\nSo in this case '#fade' is the target. A target is sort of a reference of where an animation should start.\nIf it's a number then the animation will be triggered at the respective offset from the top.\nIf it's a selector (like in this case) or a jQuery object (which is basically the same thing, but with $() wrapped around it) then this element will be used as a reference. So when the scroll position reaches the top offset of this element the animation will start.\n\nI hope this clears things up for you.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Aris,\n\non a first glance your code does look fine.\n\nHere are some notes that might help you:\nThe first parameter for addTween doesn't necessarily have to be the element that is animated. It is the reference that is used to know when (where) the animation should start.\n\nAs I built sites where this exact case does work (refreshing below animations) I am quite confident it's not a  problem with superscrollorama. See [here](http://public.orsi-and-jan.info/).\n\nSo my guess is that it may have something to do with your setup, specifically the loading algorithm. Maybe the elements are not available when superscrollorama is called or their position values are set afterwards.\nThe way I would approach this is by console.logging some values within the checkAnim method and see if everything is like it should be.\n\nIf you end up not finding a solution you may use this dirty workaround: do a `window.scrollTo(0, 0);` on page load.\nRemember this is sort of a developer-problem an end user would probably never do. (why would you scroll down a page, refresh and scroll back up).\n\nI do however understand the need to have it work \"clean\". So good luck with that.\nIf you figure out what the problem was, please let us know.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Aris,\n\nnothing besmirched here :)\nGlad you got your project working.\n\ntake care,\nJan\n. Hi pmtarantino,\n\nwhat exactly do you mean by \"fragmented scroll behaviour\"?\nAnd is it possible for you to provide a demo of this phenomenon?\nI have never heard of this issue and don't see a white box in chrome anywhere on the project page.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi pmtarantino,\n\ndo you mean this?\n![Screenshot](http://s23.postimg.org/e6anaks8b/Bildschirmfoto_2013_07_25_um_11_53_16.png)\n\nIf yes this is actually a feature of Chrome.\nTo see how to disable it see [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12046315/prevent-overscolling-of-web-page).\n\nIf this is not what you meant I'm at a loss.\nI tried really hard to reproduce what you describe by scrolling fast or slow, using the mousewheel, trackpad or scrollbar.\nNo success...\n. Hi Patricio,\n\nthis is another hint this is a browser issue rather than a superscrollorama issue.\nCan you update to the latest chrome version (28) and then try again?\nDownload [here](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser)\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Patricio,\n\nthis is so weird. I have no chance of seing this bug happen, so I have no idea how I should approach a fix.\nIf you can narrow it down and find out what may cause these glitches we might find a solution.\nBut if you can't I'm afraid we're at a loss.\n\nI can't fix something I can't see...\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Yes, darren, thank you for clearing this mystery up. :)\n. If anything, this is a TweenMax issue.\n\nTweens need to be paused in order to be played at the right time.\n\nTry adding your staggered Tween to a TimelineMax Object and adding this to superscrollorama.\n\nHope this helps,\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Try this\n\n```\nvar controller = $.superscrollorama();\n\nvar staggerTween = new TimelineMax();\nstaggerTween.add(TweenMax.staggerFrom($('.myclass li'), 1, {css:{top:50, alpha:0}}, 0.2));\n\ncontroller.addTween('.myclass li', staggerTween);\ncontroller.addTween('#myid .left', TweenMax.from( $('#myid .left'), 0.5, {css:{right:'500px',rotation: 0,opacity: 0}, ease:Quad.easeInOut},0.1));\n```\n. Hi and welcome.\n\nYes I do. It's an error thrown because an element is missing.\nYou are trying to tween an element and that element is undefined. Check the selector.\nOr maybe you're setting the tween before the object is available. Be sure to use $(document).ready().\n\nHope this helps.\n\nRegards,\nJan\n. I am sure the reason for the error is that the element you are trying to tween is not available at the time you are placing the call.\nPlease try to make sure of that and zone in on the error.\nThis is because I came across this error a couple of times myself.\nIf you can't figure it out please provide a demo page so I can have a look.\nRegards,\nJan\n. Also try to remove the lines you posted and see if the error persists. It's curious because you are not tweening the top position in the example code provided.\n. Hi contempoinc,\n\nthe reason for your error is that you run jQuery in noconflict mode. That is why the $ element is not available, when needed to get the top position of a an element.\nTo resolve this you can disable the noconflict mode, or if you need it, you can try this:\n\nAdd this line to superscrollorama below line 18:\n`var $ = jQuery;`\n\nIt's just a shot in the dark, it might help though...\nLet me know if it works, if yes, we might include that line into superscrollorama...\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Did you also update the demo site?\nCause there the superscrollorama file is still the same and jQuery still runs in noconflict mode.\nAlso there is this error:\n`Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'jpreLoader'`\n. Heyho,\n\nI'm afraid the error still exists - except now it only appears once you scroll down.\nThis is really curious.\nCan you please try to disable jQuery noconflict mode, to make sure this is what's causing the problems?\nIf we can narrow it down to this we can start to find a fix...\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hehe, okay, I think I figured it out.\nSometimes it helps to read the jQuery documentation :)\n\nFor [jQuery.noConflict()](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/) it says there:\n\n```\njQuery.noConflict();\n(function($) {\n  $(function() {\n    // more code using $ as alias to jQuery\n  });\n})(jQuery);\n// other code using $ as an alias to the other library\n```\n\nSo it's really only a matter of wrapping this around your document ready statement:\n\n```\n(function($) {\n// your stuff\n})(jQuery);\n```\n\nI already tried it out and it seems to work...\n\nHope this helps, best regards,\nJan\n. Shit, I think i got it.\n\nMy first guess was actually correct. The element you are trying to tween is not available. Well one of them.\nIt has nothing to do with the noconflict mode. It was just difficult finding the problem, because for some reason all your sourcecode is without linewraps.\n\nI was just always checking for \".fly-it\", but the element that is missing is actually \".fade-it\".\n\nPlease make sure that this element exists. AND is not set to display: none.\nThe reason for this is that for elements that have this style it's impossible to calculate the offset position.\nSee here for details: http://api.jquery.com/offset\n\nActually there is a small fix for this in the latest version of superscrollorama to avoid an error when an element is set to display: none. So be sure to download the latest version. Of course the animation still wouldn't work but at least there'd be no error.\n\nI think we finally solved this one, right?\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi!\n\nDid you manage to sort this out?\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi tombo,\n\nUnfortunately if you can't provide a demo page where I can have a look at the phenomenon I won't be able to help you...\n\nIs it possible to provide one?\n\nRegards,\nJan\n. As I said I sadly won't be able to help you unless you provide a public demo...\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Well you actually said you'd try to get something public facing.\nReally no need to get snappy.\nIf you are willing to share the library you used please do, as it might help others.\n\nBest of luck,\nJan\n. Hi tombo,\n\nI understand.\nImpending deadlines can be a pain.\nLet's hope you'll have another project some time, maybe with a little more time, and you get a chance to try out superscrollorama.\n\nRegards,\nJan\n. Hi Justin,\n\nthis is actually a common problem associated with WYSIWYG editors, like Dreamweaver.\nThey almost never get it 100% right. The only way to make sure is to do it by hand.\n\nI assume your problems don't really have anything to do with superscrollorama, but rather with some errors in the DOM or CSS, which chrome and firefox handle better than safari.\n\nI suggest you deactivate superscrollorama and try to get the positioning in safari right, before you reactivate it.\nSafari is definitely supported, both by superscrollorama and TweenMax.\n\nI hope this helps,\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi!\n\nSure it's possible!\nYou can either add multiple pins to multiple objects or if they should be pinned at the same time have them in a wrapper and pin the wrapper.\nKeep in mind that you can add more than one animation to one pin using the TweenMax object TimelineMax.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi vossavant,\n\nI'm not a 100% sure I understand what you are trying to do, but I think you are looking for this:\n\n```\n// prepare animation\nvar pinAnimation = new TimelineLite()\n        .append( TweenMax.from( $( '#our-work h1' ), 3, { right : '-500px' } ) )\n        .append( TweenMax.to( $( '#our-work nav' ), 3, { left : '160px' } ) );\n\n// add each portfolio item\n$( '#portfolio-inner .item' ).each( function() {\n        pinAnimation.append(\n                TweenMax.from( $( this ), 1, { \n                    delay : Math.random() * .2,\n                    css : { opacity : 0, x: Math.random() * maxX - (maxX / 2), y: Math.random() * maxY - (maxY / 2) },\n                    ease    : Power3.easeInOut\n                } )\n        );\n} );\n\n// create pin\ncontroller.pin( $( '#our-work' ), 3000, {\n    anim : pinAnimation,\n    onPin: function() {\n        $( '#our-work' ).css( 'height', '100%' );\n    }, \n    onUnpin: function() {\n        $( '#our-work' ).css( 'height', '1000px' );\n    }\n} );\n```\n\nThis way though the elements will all be animated in sequence, but during the pin.\nIf you want to start them simultaneously put them into an array and add them together.\nLook at the \"delay\" option to tune your animation to your needs.\nAlso you should use \"add\" instead of \"append\", as it is deprecated.\n\nMore info see here: http://api.greensock.com/js/com/greensock/TimelineMax.html\n\nhope this helps, best regards,\nJan\n\nP.S.: The way I build animations for superscrollorama is just adding the TweenMax options, without adding them to superscrollorama. Only once I get the animation the way I want it I add it to superscrollorama.\n. Glad I could help! :-)\n\nRegards, Jan\n. Hi Tomarz,\n\nsure it is!\nAdd two TweenMax objects to one TimelineMax object and add this to superscollorama.\nSee here for an example: https://github.com/johnpolacek/superscrollorama/issues/74\n\nregards,\nJan\n. hi!\n\n1)\nWhen checking your example it seems to be working nicely. Is it because it's currently optimized for mac? (I'm looking at it from my mac). I can't really see anything wrong with it.\n\n2) I tried zooming in using chrome on the demo page (http://johnpolacek.github.io/superscrollorama/) and even on your example page. Both seem to work!\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi! Please see my last answer to question https://github.com/johnpolacek/superscrollorama/issues/78 .\nThis should help you :)\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n. You're welcome. :)\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Dude, here's how I'd approach it:\nIf you want the animation played you need to simulate scrolling instead of the regular behaviour of an anchor (which is jumping to it). So check out: the Greensock Scroll Plugin: http://api.greensock.com/js/com/greensock/plugins/ScrollToPlugin.html\n\nThen I would replace the default action of any or all anchors with scrolling to it instead of jumping to it.\nSomething like this (**untested**):\n\n```\n$(\"a[href^=#]\").each(function(e) {\n     e.preventDefault();\n     var offset = $(this).offset();\n     TweenLite.to(window, 2, {scrollTo:{y:offset.top}, ease:Power2.easeOut});\n});\n```\n\nHope this helps! :)\nhave fun,\nJan\n. try\n\n```\n$('#anchorDiv').click(function(e) {\n     e.preventDefault();\n     var offset = $('#TargetDiv').offset();\n     TweenLite.to(window, 2, {scrollTo:{y:offset.top,x:0}, ease:Power2.easeOut});\n});\n```\n. All right cool!\nAnd you're right it does seem like a bug in TweenMax.\nAlso some googling suggested that it's not an issue for all browsers...\nAnyway - I'm gonna close this.\nGlad all worked out for you.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi softvar,\n\nthank you for pointing out this error, but I'm afraid you made a typo yourself in line 372.\nPlease fix the Font Link (Closing Quotes instead of \"The callback functions\") and commit again.\nI will merge it then.\n\nthanks & regards,\nJan\n. thanks. :)\n. Hi!\n\nActually with your current script you already have several simultaneous pins, if the distance between the elements is less than 2000. :)\nIt Looks to me that the solution would just be to have your ending pin (the ???) element positioned right where the last article pin ends. So 2000px below it's starting position.\nAs superscrollorama is very exact the pin should then start right after the last article pin ended.\nIf you want to start a little earlier or later, use the offset option.\n\nHope this helps,\nregards,\nJan\n. No worries, glad I could help.\nTake care! :)\n. Hi Joe and welcome to superscrollorama,\n\nthis is actually a TweenMax issue, but since you're here, I'll help ya out.\nThe code you are looking for is:\n\n```\ncontroller.addTween(\n                '#gun',\n                (new TimelineLite())\n                    .add([\n                        TweenMax.fromTo($('#hammer'), 1, \n                            {css:{rotation: 0}, immediateRender:true}, \n                            {css:{rotation: -25}, ease:Quad.easeInOut}),\n                        TweenMax.fromTo($('#trigger'), 1, \n                            {css:{rotation: 0}, immediateRender:true}, \n                            {css:{rotation: 40}, ease:Quad.easeInOut})\n                        ])\n                    .add(\n                        TweenMax.to($('#hammer'), 1, {css:{rotation: 0}}), \n                        ),\n            500, // scroll duration of tween\n            200 // offset?\n); \n```\n\nFor more information see: http://api.greensock.com/js\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Joe,\n\nactually the reason nothing moves at all is that there is a grave error in your code.\nPlease use the javascript console for debugging, before posting here, as this is a very obvious error.\n\nCompare your code to mine again thoroughly and I'm sure you'll see where you went wrong.\n\ngood luck and kind regards,\nJan\n. Hi Joe,\n\nAs I mentioned right at the beginning this is actually a TweenMax Issue.\nI am sorry that superscrollorama is not really a copy & paste solution.\nIt requires extensive knowledge of javascript and a firm understanding of TweenMax.\nAnd to aquire both I'm afraid this is not the right place.\n\nBut I'll try to rewrite the code for you again and hope this helps you understand how superscrollorama works:\n\n```\n<script>\n    $(document).ready(function() {\n        // init controller\n        var controller = $.superscrollorama();\n\n        // build animation\n        var myAnimation = new TimelineMax();\n        myAnimation.add([\n                    TweenMax.fromTo($('#hammer'), 1, \n                        {css:{rotation: 0}, immediateRender:true}, \n                        {css:{rotation: -25}, ease:Quad.easeInOut}),\n                    TweenMax.fromTo($('#trigger'), 1, \n                        {css:{rotation: 0}, immediateRender:true}, \n                        {css:{rotation: 40}, ease:Quad.easeInOut})\n            ])\n            .add(\n                    TweenMax.to($('#hammer'), 1, {css:{rotation: 0}})\n            );\n\n        // add the tween to superscrollorama\n        controller.addTween('#gun', myAnimation, 500, 200);\n    });\n</script>\n```\n\nIf you leave the last line out (try commenting it out) then the animation should just play.\nThis is actually how I usually build animations for superscrollorama.\nI build the timeline, watch if it plays like i want and only at the end I add the Tween to superscrollorama.\n\nHope this clarifys it for you.\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n. Hi Joe,\n\ndid you manage to solve your problem?\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi!\n\nI think you stumbled upon a bug here. Well actually It's hard to tell as it might be desired behaviour.\nThe removePin method does not remove the spacers. This is because if it would the position of the pinned element would be reset to where it was before it was pinned.\nRight now I'm thinking about including an option switch in the method in the next update to let the user decide if he wants the spacers removed as well.\n\nTo avoid the creation of spacers altogether you might want to set \"pushFollowers\" to false.\nThen you'll have to set the distance between the pinned elements manually (create a spacer element yourself)\n\nHope this helps,\nregards,\nJan\n. Heyho,\n\nyou're actually right! The spacer is created, even when pushFollowers is set to true. The reason is that the spacer is used to \"remember\" where the pinned element was originally positioned. As the position might change when resizing the site (e.g. with div 100% wrappers) this is necessary.\nBut when using pushFollowers:false the spacer is not resized.\n\nTo answer your second question: Yes you should have a spacer after each element with the height of your pin duration.\n\nlet's get the remove work properly first and then we can worry about the jump :).\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi Ryan,\n\nI don't think I can see what you mean. I checked out your staging link and to me it looks like the distance between the articles is the same...\nAlso I don't see what you mean with the \"strange jump\" at the bottom.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Ryan,\n\nI'm guessing the \"jitter\" had to do with the expanding spacers and it's gone now because you use static ones.\nThis is actually planned for future versions of superscrollorama, as you can read here and here .\n\nIf the space betweeen your first and second element is due to the height of your first spacer (2000px) (after chapter0).\nJust reduce the height to like 200px and you should be fine...\n\nregards,\nJ\n. no seat. take care and if you figure out a solution be sure to post it here :)\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi Jordan,\n\nsadly with the current version of superscrollorama there is no way of setting the reference point to the bottom of the page. This is something we have planned for future versions.\nBut here's something that might serve you as a workaround:\n\nCreate a container for the element that you want to animate. Set it's height to 100% of the window's height.\nThen position your element inside of the container using css \"bottom\" positioning.\nThen add the tween in reference to the container, so that when the container hits the top of the page your element will be at the bottom. \nHope this is clear enough.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Jerczu,\n\nPlease check the documentation under http://johnpolacek.github.io/superscrollorama.\nThere you can see that you can also pass an animation for pins.\nThis animation will play for the duration of the pin and this should be what you are looking for.\n\nhope this helps,\nbest regards,\nJan\n. Hi Jordan,\n\nunfortunately I'm having a really hard time to understand what it is you are trying to do and what exactly might be the problem.\nPlease elaborate a little and try to make it as simple as possible. Also a demo Site might help.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Congrats on figuring it out! :)\n\nThe site looks nice!\n\nregards,\nJ\n. I guess you figured it out? :)\n. Yes, the addTween method has a \"reverse\" option, which, if set to false, disables the reverse animation when scrolling up.\nFor more information see the documentation: http://johnpolacek.github.io/superscrollorama/\n\nregards,\nJ\n. This is very curious, as I remember having this exact same problem when developing http://public.orsi-and-jan.info.\nI'm not sure if I was able to iron it out in the end and I cant test it at the moment. It does work on this machine though (OSX 10.6.8, Safari 5.1.9).\n\nAnyways: I think this is a TweenMax Issue.\nTo verify you could disable all superscrollorama animations and try then.\nIf the error persists (which I'm guessing) I'm afraid you'll have try your luck in the [greensock forums](http://forums.greensock.com/forum/11-animation-tweening-js/).\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi Trever,\n\nAs I said I suspect it's a TweenMax issue.\nHave you tried disabling superscrollorama as I said above?\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Andi,\n\nsch\u00f6n, wenn sich Probleme so einfach l\u00f6sen! :)\nViel Erfolg weiterhin!\n\nlg J\n. Try adding the Tween to a Timeline and then adding that timeline to superscrollorama.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi!\n\nWhenever you set the duration to 0 (when using pin or addTween) the animation will just play when reaching the trigger-position.\nI think that's what you are looking for, right? :)\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi again!\n\nyou're very welcome! :)\nActually I think there is a better way to do what you want to achieve.\nWhy not adding multiple tweens at the same offset position?\nOne could have a duration and one not, causing one to be linked to the scroll-play-head and one autoplaying.\n\nThere's really no need to force everything into one timeline object as superscrollorama is also very exact.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi vishi,\n\nI'm sorry but you are wrong. If html and body are set to height 100% (which you would do to have divs expanded at 100% height) it has no effect superscrollorama.\nObviously the page contents needs to be higher than the window to be able to scroll.\nAs a proof you can check here: http://public.orsi-and-jan.info/home\nThere html and body are set to 100% height and it still works.\n\nSo whatever prevents your code from working must be something else.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Well I'm glad that you were able to resolve the issue :).\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi!\n\nOn a first glance it is difficult for me to figure out what causes the problem on your demo.\nMy guess is that it has to do with one of the main issues of superscrollorama that a lot of users faced:\nThe behaviour of the spacers, just expanding when reaching a pin trigger.\n\nWhat I think is happening is that the spacers expand and colapse at the wrong times when scrolling up, causing the page to reach a certain scrollpoint multiple times, which in turn causes your animations to be played multiple times.\nI am actually at the moment working on a complete rewrite of superscrollorama that includes many changes, first and foremost fixing this (annoying) issue.\n\nIn the meantime you should try what I suggested to a couple of other people allready: set \"pushFollowers\" to false and create your own spacers after your pinned elements. For example if you want to pin it for 5000px put in an empty div after the pinned element with the height of 5000px.\n\nLet me know if this helps in this case,\nregards,\nJ\n. Okay, here's another approach.\nIf you use elements both as triggers (where should something start) and the target of animations (what should start) there might be some problems:\nIf you animate the position of elements or when pinning them their offset positions are changed.\nSo what I suggest is: Keep the triggers (first argument in addTween or addPin) and the Animation Targets (first argument for TweenMax) seperate. And make sure the triggers don't change position.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. You're welcome! :)\n. Development on ScrollMagic is finished and version 1.0.0 was released.\n. Hi Ryan,\n\nI'm afraid I'm having trouble reprodrucing the error. I can both scroll to the very bottom and click the contact link (both looks the same to me). Maybe a little demo-video of the issue would help me understand?\n\nAnother way might be this:\nHave you read that I started working on [ScrollMagic](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic)?\nIt's Superscrolloramas Child so to say. :) It is still in pre-release and in a very early state but maybe you can try it out for that very last bit. See how it goes...\nI build it with all the nagging little issues in mind that always popped up.\n\nImportant: I have not tested yet how it behaves with pin elements and the triggers being the same. So please make sure they are seperate. Maybe set up a test-case to find out how it works. Here are some notes: https://github.com/johnpolacek/superscrollorama/issues/94\nLet me know how it goes.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi Ryan,\n\nsorry for the late answer, I was gone for a few days...\nObviously I didn't expect you to rewrite everything. I just thought you might want to try it on the last section. Superscrollorama and ScrollMagic should be able to coexist.\n\nI looked at the screencapture and can finally reproduce the problem.\nWhen I scroll down I see the top value of the div.inner decreasing.\nAre you tweening it?\nI think what's causing the problem is the fact that the top position of the trigger element keeps changing.\nTry to seperate trigger and tween element and try again.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. I'll close this for now, not because I think it's fixed, but because I really don't see a good solution.\nI will focus on resolving this issue when I continue working on ScrollMagic.\n. Hello and welcome Eduardo,\n\nI'm afraid the page is empty, I don't see any content to scroll :).\nHave you changed it somehow?\n\nregards,\nJ\n. The reason for the + jumping is that the tween is triggered right from the start. Superscrollorama just doesn't refresh right at the start, it only does that on scroll.\nIf you want to update the positions on page load, try adding  `controller.triggerCheckAnim()` right after adding the tween.\n\nA better way though would be to get the starting position right and trigger the tween only AFTER the user has scrolled.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi Nathinah,\n\nActually superscrollorama usually works with elements as triggers.\nWhat you do with the above code is running the animation, when slide5 is scrolled into view, which is exactly what you want, right?\nIf you want it to start, when it's fully visible, try changing the triggerAtCenter option to false.\n\nIf you want more control over WHERE in the viewport the trigger should be when the animation starts, try the successor to superscrollroama: [ScrollMagic](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic)\nPlease mind though that I'm still working on it and it is not yet finished.\n\nbest regards,\nJ\n. Hello and welcome jkrot,\n\nI am really sorry, but I'm having a really hard time understanding your problem.\nIs there maybe a demo page where I could actually look at the problem and the source code?\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Ok I'm assuming this is a phenomenon that is caused by superscrolloramas handling of pin spacers.\nThe current behaviour is that they expand only once the pin has started (or stay expanded afterwards, respectively).\nI'm guessing this is what messes up the anchors: The positions are actually correct, but by the time you get there they have changed.\n\nSo what you should try is what I recommended a lot of times now:\nSet pushFollowers to false and add your own spacers for the duration of the pin.\nSo for example you have a div and want to pin it for 300px, then add a spacer div after it and make it 300px in height.\n\nThis is actually one of the most problematic things about superscrollorama and I entirely reworked it in ScrollMagic.\nThere spacers wrap around pin elements, and expand right from the start.\nEven though this already works it is still in pre-release phase so probably not interesting for a working project.\nBut if you want to give it a whirl, feel free to do so:\nSee Issue https://github.com/johnpolacek/superscrollorama/issues/94\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n. Hi jkrot,\nactually there is quite a lot of documentation already. Have you checked the docu folder?\nWhats missing though are examples...\n\nI still don't really understand your problem. Do you have skype or something so we could talk this through?\nOr some IM if you prefer?\n\nregards,\nJ\n. For the record:\nWe resolved the issue by setting all pushFollowers to false and adding manual spacers.\n. Uh - that's a tough one...\nActually I've never run into that.\nSo basically you want  your tween to be different when scrolling up...\nYou couldn't change it mid-tween anyway, as the position would change if you changed it while tweening.\nBut what you can try is supplying a function in the onComplete callback of the tween, then remove it and add a new one. With that one have a an onStart Callback, that changes it back to the original one...\n\nthis might work, but no guarantees ;)\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hiho!\n\nCheck the [documentation](http://johnpolacek.github.com/superscrollorama/) and you'll find that apart from anim, onPin and onUnpin you can pass an offset variable.\nI assume that's what you're looking for?\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Sorry, corrected the link...\n\nIf you want to have a pin start as soon as the trigger enters the viewport you'll have to use half the height of the viewport as the offset (if you have triggerAtCenter: true).\nThe problem is that this must be updated whenever the page is resized. So you need to call updatePin on every window resize and set the new offset.\n\nThis is an Issue that I resolved in [ScrollMagic](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic), the future version of Superscrollorama.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. You're one level to deep (that sounds wrong, too)\ntry:\n\n```\nonPin: function() {\n     $('#heelwrapper').css('height','100%');\n},\noffset: 800\n```\n. glad that everything worked out...\n\nGenau genommen bin ich Deutscher, aber auch die sind manchmal freundlich ;)\n. soll schon vorgekommen sein...\n. Hi James,\n\nagain I'm really having trouble following your train of thought.\nPlease try to put yourself into the position of someone that is not as deep inside the code as you surely must be by now. If possible simplify the problem or make a demo page with one single element and one single occurrence of your suspected error.\nThis makes it much easier for you and for us to track down the problem.\n\nThat beeing said I have one suspicion as to what's causing your problems.\nYou use your pinned elements both as triggers as well as subjects of your animations.\nThis is generally okay if all you do is change colors or opacity. But when you start changing the position or size that's where problems (might) start.\nIf your pin element is 800px of height before the pin and only 200px as is the case with your #platform-intro this obviously influences the position of following elements.\nThat's what might be causing problems with the trigger positions, when scrolling back up.\n\nHere's how I would approach it:\nTry to have the triggers seperate from your tween-targets.\nOr even better: have wrappers around the sections you want to pin and only use them to pin. Any changes in size or position do on the Section itself INSIDE the pinned element.\n\nHope this helps,\nbest regards,\nJan\n. Hi James,\n\nthank you so much for investigating this!\nI am very glad you got to the bottom of this issue.\nThis seems indeed to be a bug, although I have some small objections to your fix.\nI will post them in the pull request...\n\nThanks and I'm happy this worked out for you,\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Stefan,\n\nThe way you set things up it's supposed to behave exactly like it does.\nYou do a tween to 1 at 100 pixels in and a tween back to 0 at 800. So if you do a reload and jump past 800 and you scroll back upwards it means to superscrollorama animate from 0 to what it was before. What it was before was 0 though, because you set that in the css. It's different when you scroll down normally, as then the \"before-value\" is 1, because you hit the first trigger.\n\nHere's how you get what you want:\ninstead of TweenMax.to use TweenMax.fromTo.\nThere you can set a start and an end value to a tween.\nThis way you can make sure it is always tweened the way you want.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Freut mich!\nViel Spa\u00df noch... :-)\n. Hi Stefano,\n\nplease provide a demo so I can have a look at it. :)\n(Although I suspect it might have something to do with the playoutAnimations option).\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Ah, I guess, I know whats happening.\nWhen you scroll too fast the first tween is still running when the second is supposed to start.\nSo what you'll need to do is tell TweenMax to overwrite other tweens if there are still running some.\nThis can be achieved using the overwrite option of TweenMax.\nThe Tweenmax Documentation says:\n\n```\n\"auto\" (2) - when the tween renders for the first time, it will analyze tweens of the same target that are currently active/running and only overwrite individual tweening properties that overlap/conflict. Tweens that haven't begun yet are ignored. For example, if another active tween is found that is tweening 3 properties, only 1 of which it shares in common with the new tween, the other 2 properties will be left alone. Only the conflicting property gets overwritten/killed. This is the default mode and typically the most intuitive for developers.\n```\n\nSo what I think you should do is define your Tweens like this:\n\n``` js\n        var tweenIn1 = TweenMax.fromTo($('#textleft'), .3, {\n            css: {                    \n                top: '22%'\n            },\n            overwrite: \"auto\",\n            ease: Back.easeOut\n        });\n```\n\nas an extra bonus tip note, that with the current version of TweenMax you dont have to use css options as an object anymore...\n\n``` js\n        var tweenIn1 = TweenMax.fromTo($('#textleft'), .3, {\n            top: '22%',\n            overwrite: \"auto\",\n            ease: Back.easeOut\n        });\n```\n. Hi Stefano,\n\nI agree with James.\nPlease follow his advice and if it still doesn't work, you'll have to provide some form of demo for us to be able to help you.\nIf you cant show your production page just make a quick dummy where you show the phenomenon.\nIsolating the issue may even help you figuring out what the problem is yourself...\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi Stefano,\n\nthank you for setting up the demo. This helps a lot.\n\nI think I might understand now. To my mind superscrollorama does exactly what is supposed to, namely positioning the box exactly where it's supposed to be at the respective point in time.\nSo if you go fast you won't see it going from left to right, but go to bottom instead (as that's the position it's supposed to be at at that point).\nSince you have playoutAnimations set to true sometimes this may cause it to animate differently than expected. (as the start position is not the end of the previous animation, but the position before that.)\nBut even with playoutAnimations false the position can sometimes be wrong for the exact same reason.\n\nWhat TweenMax.to does is always animate from the previous state.\n\nTo give you an example:\nani 1 animates margin left to 750. previously it was 0 so it will animate to 750.\nani 2 animates back to 0.\nani 3 animates top to 750.\n\nSo obviously you expect the box to be at left 0, top 750 when finishing ani 3.\nBut if you scroll fast enough to skip ani 2 completly the position will in fact be left 750, top 750.\nSo try this code instead:\n\n``` javascript\n$(function ($) {\n    controller = $.superscrollorama();\n\n    controller.addTween(100, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 750,\n                marginTop: 0\n            }), 300);\n    controller.addTween(500, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 0\n            }), 300);\n    controller.addTween(900, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 750\n            }), 300);\n    controller.addTween(1300, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 0\n            }), 300);\n\n    controller.addTween(2000, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 750,\n                marginTop: 0\n            }), 300);\n    controller.addTween(2500, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 0\n            }), 300);\n    controller.addTween(2900, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 750\n            }), 300);\n    controller.addTween(3300, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 0\n            }), 300);\n});\n\n\n\nfunction log(msg) {\n    if (console != \"undefined\") console.log(msg);\n    else alert(msg);\n}\n```\n\nBest regards,\nJ\n. Hi Stefano,\n\nHmm.. it IS kind of weird! I was almost going to say it works as it's supposed to but sometimes I get it to move diagonally... I am guessing it might have something to do with the fact that superscrollorama doesn't really care about past animations. But to be honest I am not really kean on investing a lot of time bugfixing superscrollorama, when I have the follower (ScrollMagic) already lined up. I will definitely use your demo to see how ScollMagic behaves with it, so please leave it online.\nAs for fixing your issue I would recommend trying to leave nothing to coincidence.\nTry this bulky but quite surely working code:\n\n``` javascript\n$(function ($) {\n    controller = $.superscrollorama();\n\n    controller.addTween(100, TweenMax.fromTo($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 0\n            },\n            {\n                marginLeft: 750,\n                marginTop: 0\n            }), 300);\n    controller.addTween(500, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 750,\n                marginTop: 0\n            },\n            {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 0\n            }), 300);\n    controller.addTween(900, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 0\n            },\n            {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 750\n            }), 300);\n    controller.addTween(1300, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 750\n            },\n            {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 0\n            }), 300);\n    controller.addTween(2000, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 0,\n            },\n            {\n                marginLeft: 750,\n                marginTop: 0\n            }), 300);\n    controller.addTween(2500, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 750,\n                marginTop: 0,\n            },\n            {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 0\n            }), 300);\n    controller.addTween(2900, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 0\n            },\n            {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 750\n            }), 300);\n    controller.addTween(3300, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 750,\n            },\n            {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 0\n            }), 300);\n});\n\n\n\nfunction log(msg) {\n    if (console != \"undefined\") console.log(msg);\n    else alert(msg);\n}\n```\n. Hey Stefano!\n\nDid this sort things out for ya?\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi James,\nAs you pointed out this is caused as there may be a case there the start position of the pin is exactly the scroll position.\nYour suggested fix has two downsides though:\nFirst: It changes the curScrollPoint to a faulty -1 which might cause inaccurate TweenPositioning,\nand second: It neglects horizontal scrolling.\n\nMy suggestion would be to tackle it where the error really lies.\nAt line 186.\nThis is currently\n\n```\nvar inPinAra = (currScrollPoint > startPoint && currScrollPoint < endPoint);\n```\n\nBut I think it should be:\n\n```\nvar inPinAra = (currScrollPoint >= startPoint && currScrollPoint <= endPoint);\n```\n\nPlease try this out and see if this also resolves your isse.\nIf yes we can implement it like this.\n\nThanks again and best regards,\nJan\n. Hi James,\n\nI don't really understand the issue. If I click a link that takes me to the pin (so curScrollPoint == pinStart) to my mind the animation position should be 0 (as it is the beginning). Why would a user want to have a behaviour when the animation position is 1 at the beginning of the pin?\n\nPlease help me understand,\nbest regards,\nJ\n. Is there a way for you to create a demo page where I can easily reproduce the issue?\n. Hi James,\nSorry, it took me a while to get back to you.\nI can see the quirks but it's difficult for me to trace the origin as there is so much other stuff going on on the site.\nThat's why I was hoping you could have a site that showcases ONLY the problematic issues.\nMaybe even one for each quirk.\nThis way we can close in and try to fix them.\nI found that explicitly reproducing a faulty behaviour helps a lot in finding a solution.\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n. Hi James,\n\ncool, that will help a lot.\nAnd I can also use it to beta test ScrollMagic, which I have been working on a lot lately.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi James,\n\nYes, I saw. At the moment I don't know which way my head is facing so no rush.\nBut thank you very much for pitching in on the support. It helps a lot!\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n. Hi James,\n\nI'm back and got my head free again. :)\nSo are there any updates on this?\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi Guys,\n\nI'm closing all bug issues for Superscrollorama because it has been superceeded by ScrollMagic.\nhttps://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic\n\nPlease check if updating helps fix your problem.\nIf not, please post a new issue in the ScrollMagic issue section.\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n. Hi, welcome and thank you. :)\n\nSo here are my thoughts on performance:\nWhat costs most in superscrollorama is calling the checkScrollAnim.\nTo go easy on the client it is usually only called on tick of the TweenMax class.\nSo if you call triggerCheckAnim regularly somewhere (i.E. on resize) make sure it has the parameter false (or nothing, as false is default) passed to it.\nAll other performance issues are caused by other objects, such as TweenMax, displaying your animations.\nWhat might make your retina macbook suffer might be extra high res images that you animate or something. Just guesswork here :).\nMy 2008 Macbook Pro performce the site... well acceptable. =)\n\nAs to your question about the position quirks when reloading you have to be aware that no user will usually do that. It's only something you come accross during development.\nThat being said I think it can probably be resolved by setting pushFollowers to false and setting your spacers manually, as described multiple times, for example here https://github.com/johnpolacek/superscrollorama/issues/93\n\nI hope this helps, great site by the way!\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n. Hi Goco,\n\nActually this will not work using timeline.reverse(), as superscrollorama will control all animations for as long as they are added.\nBut please try to make more clear how the site should work.\nSo far what I think you want to achieve is this:\n\nScroll down and fire an animation, when reaching a certain scroll point.\nWhen clicking a button the animation should be reversed.\n\nWhat about when I scroll back up then? Should the animation run forward again? Or should it just not be running anymore?\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi!\n\nActually you were correct to go to the TweenMax Forums, as this really isn't a superscrollorama issue.\nBut as I personally have a thing against newbie haters I'll try to help you.\n\nFirstly I would strongly recommend setting pushFollowers to false, so you'll have the correct positions of all pinned elements right from the start.\nBare in mind that his might require you to set your own spacers.\nFor detailed descriptions see issue https://github.com/johnpolacek/superscrollorama/issues/93 .\n\nSecondly I would add an anchor element at the top position of each pin element. This should be the point where you want to scroll when clicking the \"next\" link.\nTry out this setup by using anchors `<a name=\"myanchor\"></a>` and then have Buttons like `<a href=\"#myanchor\">next</a>`.\nWhen you click the link the page should now jump to the correct position.\nNow you don't want it to jump, but scroll instead, right?\n\nSo here's how you do it:\n\n``` javascript\n$(document).ready(function() {\n    // page internal links\n    $('a[href^=\"#\"]').click(function (e) {\n        var anchor = $(this).attr(\"href\").substr(1);\n        var $target = $('a[name=\"' + anchor + '\"]').first();\n        if ($target.length > 0) {\n            e.preventDefault();\n            var scrollYPos = $target.offset().top;\n            TweenLite.to(window, .7, {scrollTo:{y:scrollYPos, x:0}, ease:Power2.easeOut});\n        }\n    });\n});\n```\n\nBear in mind, that the ScrollTo plugin is not loaded by default.\nYou will have to include the javascript file. You can do it right after you include the main TweenMax file.\n\nPlease try not only to copy and paste the code (I have not tested it and it may not work).\nTry to understand what I did and redo it line by line.\nThis way you'll learn.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi!\n\nWhat greensock version are you using? There seem to have been problems in older versions:\nhttp://forums.greensock.com/topic/7205-scrollto-bug-in-182-in-safari-602-mountain-lion/\n\nIf you're using a current version I'd like you to figure out wether it is a superscrollorama issue.\nPlease disable all superscrollorama scripts and try clicking the links.\nIf the bug still appears this is definitely a TweenMax Problem and we can't help you any further...\n\nregards,\nJ\n. By the way a \"thank you\" might have been nice...\n. Hi Joe,\n\nthat was actually what I was going to suggest.\nIt is not possible for the current version of superscrollorama to have multiple settings for triggerAtCenter.\nSo the best way to achieve this behaviour is to have triggers that position accordingly.\nThis WILL however be possible with [ScrollMagic](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic).\nBut I haven't gotten around to finish working on it.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. So I'm guessing you figured it out? :-)\n. Hi James,\n\nthank you for your demo.\nActually this has nothing to do with superscrollorama, as it works exactly as intended.\nWhen scrolling before your set trigger point it reverts to the unpinned state.\n(fyi your trigger point in your case is the top position of #slides, which equals to 0).\nSo what you can do is either add a negative offset of like 1000 (remember to add it to the duration) to make sure that  it will also be pinned at negative scroll values or (and this is by far the better solution) fix the state of your #slides container in the unpinned position.\n\nI am quite sure if you disable all pinning scripts you will se that your #slides container disappears. Why?\nActually it doesn't disappear, its height becomes 0. Why, you ask again and why does it collapse when I scroll upwards?\nWell it collapses because as I said earlier it sets the div into the state that it was \"pre-pin\" and there's your problem.\n\nNow I asked the right questions.\nDo you want a solution or figure it out yourself? :)\n\nGive it a shot or check here for the solution: http://pastebin.com/CkZmB0AY\n\nbest regards,\nJ\n. Hi James,\n\nyes you are precisely correct.\nI missed the part about jumping back to slide 8, but suspect a similar issue.\nTry making the duration longer and see if it sill happens.\nI'm at work right now and I don't have a touchpad here (the \"overscrolling\" only works with a touchpad).\nIf I find the time at home I'll have a look.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi James,\n\nactually I think it was the same problem but on the other side. The scroll was so long that the duration was over and so your container got unpinned.\nWhat you saw was the result of the misplaced items in the unpinned state.\nThat is why I suggested making the duration longer to ensure it was kept pinned.\n\nbest regards,\nJ\n. Hello and welcome.\n\nFirstly: Your demo page does not show any of the svg you described.\nPlease always make a dedicated demo page in case you are still working on the live website.\n\nSecondly: Your code is quite complicated (and not commented). Please try to simplify your problem and I will be able to help you a lot better. Also trying to simplify it will help you better understand the code and you might even solve the problem yourself.\n\nSo I suggest you set up a demo page only featuring one svg and one line drawing and there you try to have it react to the scroll position. And then take it from there.\nIf you run into problems with that demo let me know and I will take a look.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. No, I'm referring to http://www.goindoor.com as the demopage, since that was the one you sent.\nhttp://www.goingdoor.com doesn't really work (typo?).\n. I see.\nThis is precisely what I meant, when I asked you to set up a dedicated demo page for the purpose of debugging this issue. It is normal that a production page keeps changing, which makes it quite difficult for me or anybody else to help you.\n\nEven with the new page, where I can see some animation now, there is a lot of other stuff going on and zeroing in on the issue is quite impossible this way.\nPlease Create a page where nothing else is going on aside from what you are trying to achieve.\n\nIf you need a good example for a demo page, check out what James has done in this issue: https://github.com/johnpolacek/superscrollorama/issues/113\n\nregards,\nJ\n. All right, cool.\nI'll have a look as soon as I can.\nSadly I'm quite busy at the moment but I should get around to it some time this week...\nRegards,\nJ\n. Thanks, @jkrot for helping out. I agree with your analysis.\nDoes this help you, @sleepydada? Do you understand what jkrot means by first getting the animation right and then adding scroll logic?\nRegards,\nJ\n. Hi and welcome.\n\nThe reason might be you forgot ti include jQuery. Did you?\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi Stefan,\nI'll have a look as soon as I can.\nSadly I'm quite busy at the moment but I should get around to it some time this week...\nRegards,\nJ\n. Hey James,\n\nAlso check this Issue, where we originally discussed the issue: https://github.com/johnpolacek/superscrollorama/issues/104\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hiho!\n\nIf you want to have animations before scrolling you can either just add a Tween without attaching it to superscrollorama or force a scrollposition check on page load.\nYou can do that by calling controller.triggerCheckAnim() when the DOM is ready.\n\nbest regards,\nJ\n. Hi Slemming,\n\nthank you for your note.\nActually your analysis is not correct.\nThe Boolean parameter \"includeMargin\" for outerHeight or outerWidth is optional.\nIf it's ommitted false is assumed and it will return the height (or width) not including the margin, but NEVER the object.\nSee here for Documentation: http://api.jquery.com/outerHeight\n\nRegardless you might have a point that the margin should be included and thus the code should be changed to pass true.\n\nI fixed it with the new commit: https://github.com/johnpolacek/superscrollorama/commit/3ecd5aac00df9ca1af4e3df9a22a86f61fd00e34\nThank you for bringing this to my attention.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. That's never a bad idea. :)\nThanks for helping out, James!\n. Hello and sorry for the late reply.\nI was quite busy :-/.\n\nFirst you have to see the Timeline and Superscrollorama to be very seperate things.\nSuperscrollorama merely acts as a scrubber for the animations you create with TweenMax.\n\nThe reason your timeline doesn't work on newly added element is that no Tween has been defined for them. Maybe there is a way to add Animations for certain selectors and make them constant (as to react on dom changes) but I doubt it and you will have to ask in the TweenMax forums.\n\nBut as for your questions:\n\n1.) no there is not. In my opinion you'll have to build a new Tween each time you add new content.\n2.) just add the tween as you normally would and then create an animation using \"AddTween\" that is in general independent of the pin but starts at the same position. Another way would be to remove the pin and add it again with a fully rebuilt Timeline.\n3.) that is another possibility. I don't know what exactly your animations are but you might be able to add invisible containers for Guest 3 at the beginning and only add their content after the AJAX request and then switch it to visible.\n\nhope this helps,\nregards\nJ\n. Hi  mike, sorry for the late reply.\nI was quite busy in the last months.\n\nTo have your container pin at another position you can use the offset values. or you can make it react to the page center (using \"triggerAtCenter\").\n\nAs your demo isn't working anymore I hope this helps,\nJan\n. Hi and sorry for the late reply.\n\nEverything you really need is the file /js/jquery.superscrollorama.js\nThen make sure you also have TweenMax and jQuery loaded in your page and then you can get going.\nAll the other files in the REPO are just examples and the documentation page which you won't really need for your production environment.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Jason,\n\nI'm asuming you're referring to http://johnpolacek.github.io/superscrollorama/simpledemo2.html\n\nI am guessing what changes is the CSS conditions for the fly-it Element.\nCompare the css settings for #content-wrapper and #examples-1 to find out what changes.\nIf this doesn't help please provide demos of your page so we can help you debugging.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi redux,\n\ndid Jasons answer help you or is this issue still unresolved?\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi laubi,\nthank you for your input.\nThis is something I addressed and solved with [ScrollMagic](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic), the follow up for Superscrollorama :)\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Well it's under development.\nIf it's for basic projects give it a shot. But I haven't finished testing and bugs might occur (especially with pinning).\n\nregards,\nJ\n. thanks for sharing and I apologize for the lack of support.\nMy ressources are pretty limited at the moment.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi!\n\nsure just add more content and it will be shown, once the pin ends.\nAs long as the element is pinned obviously nothing can be seen that is beneath the bottom of the viewport. But as soon as the pin ends it will scroll there...\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Sgt. I will have a look into that.\n\nIs it possible for you to create a demo page for me that i can use for debugging this issue?\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Sgt,\n\nI'm closing all bug issues for Superscrollorama because it has been superceeded by ScrollMagic.\nhttps://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic\n\nPlease check if updating helps fix your problem.\nIf not, please post a new issue in the ScrollMagic issue section.\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n. Hi Leesher,\n\nthanks for your offer.\nThis is something that is implemented in ScrollMagic (the future version of Superscrollorama) and would be a too big change in the behaviour of Superscrollorama. That is why we will not implement it, as it can also be achived using your \"hacky\" solution with the very short duration.\n\nThanks anyway,\nregards,\nJan\n. This is something I'd like to include in ScrollMagic. So if you can supply a demo page where I can test this feature it would be grat.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Eric,\n\nI'm closing this issue for Superscrollorama because it has been superceeded by ScrollMagic.\nhttps://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic\n\nScrollMagic should be capable of handling responsive elements.\nPlease check if updating resolves your issue.\nIf not, please post a new issue in the ScrollMagic issue section.\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n. Hi Alan,\n\nthis looks really interesting.\nCan you supply a demo page so I will be able to avoid this issue for ScrollMagic (Superscrolloramas future Version).\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Well a simplified version, only reduced to the described penomenon would be far preferable.\nSo if you could do that it would be much appreciated.\nTake your time though and launch your project first :)\n. Hi Alan,\n\nthis is a very cool demo!\nI will definitely work this into SrollMagic using it.\nIf you have to take it offline, please zip and and email it to me.\n\nthank you and kind regards,\nJan\n. Hi Alan,\n\nthanks to your demo I fixed this issue for ScrollMagic.\nThe Reason for it is simple. When pinning an Element I need to convert its position to fixed. to do this I use the jQuery.css() method to get top and left position etc.\nThe curious thing though is that this always returns pixel values (even though you defined percentage values in your css).\n\nSo I found there are three ways to address this:\n1.) calculate the correct pixel values on resize (similar to what you did)\n2.) parse the Stylesheet for information about percentage positioning\n3.) Rely on inline styles (`<div style=\"left: 50%\">`) to achieve this effect.\n\nYou can read more on this issue and how to approach it [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/744319/get-css-rules-percentage-value-in-jquery) and [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5230425/getting-percent-css-position-with-jquery).\n\nI ultimately decided against the first two options for the following reasons:\n1.) this would make the need for an additional parameter to the pin method. i.e. \"leftPosRelative\". Then I'd need to find out in relation to which element the position would need to be calculated, which may vary, according to DOM. All in all I found this too cluttering and unrelyable.\n2.) since there are virtually unlimited ways of applying CSS rules in a stylesheet there is absolutely no relyable way to make sure you have the correct definitions, if you set out to do it for all users...\n3.) this is the way I ultimately went with. There are no calculations needed and best flexibility. So if a user wants to position the pinned element centered he has to use inline styling to set left to 50%. If nothing is set $.css() will be used like before.\n\nI think think this is the best solution and I already put to work using your example.\nCheck this out:\nhttp://www.janpaepke.de/tmp/ScrollMagic_relative_positioning/positionfix_SCROLLMAGIC.html\n\nSo... one down! :)\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Well a lot of the credit goes to John, as he started it.\nBut thanks! :)\nBe sure to send us a link once it's public.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. HA! I got an even better solution!\nI was scrolling further down the pages on stackoverflow I send you and there was this one guy that suggested to hide the parent, read the css value and then show the parent again.\nThis prevents jQuery vom calculating the pixels and returns the percentage instead.\n\nThis is awesome, now it works like a charm even with stylesheet definitions only!\n\nI updated the demo, check it out! :)\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi!\n\nthe solution are containers that have the size of 100% height. The div you want to animate should be inside them and positioned accordingly (for example 50% top).\nThen use the container as triggers for the animations of the divs.\n\nhope this helps,\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi @epcieye, were you able to sort out this issue?\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi wondergiant,\n\nthanks for sharing your solution! :)\nI will keep this in mind when continuing work on ScrollMagic.\n\nthanks & regards,\nJan\n. Hi Fortarrigo,\n\nin theory you should have multiple controllers.\nI am not sure if it is possible with the current version of Superscrollorama though.\nThe problem is that it always assumes $(window) as the container. You might be able to hack around this...\nTo have multiple Scrollcontainers on one page is something that will be supported by ScrollMagic though.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Roger,\n\ndid James' answer help you?\nIf not please supply a demo so we can better understand what you are trying to achieve.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi roger,\n\nI think I understand.\nAn anchor link tries to scroll to where the respective element would touch the top of the screen.\nThe thing is, as long as they are inside a pinned div this could never happen.\nSo if you want to scroll at a certain point within the pin (NOT when the respective element touches the top) this would be changing the behaviour of anchor links.\nSo here's how I'd approach it:\nYou're pinning the block for a duration of 964px.\nso you need to figure out to which point in this duration the anchor link should scroll to and give this information to the respective link. Like this:\n\n``` HTML\n<a href=\"#panel1\" data-scrolloffset=\"300\">Complete Calendar</a>\n```\n\nThis would mean it should scroll to 300 px after the pin has started.\nThen catch the click to these links like this [untested code]:\n\n``` javascript\n$(\"a[data-scrolloffset]\").on(\"click\", function(e) {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    var\n        pinStartPos = $(\"section.pin-block\").prev(\"div.superscrollorama-pin-spacer\").offset().top,\n        targetPos = pinStartPos + $(this).attr(\"data-scrolloffset\");\n    $(window).scrollTop(targetPos);\n});\n```\n\nHope this helps!\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Cool! Glad I could help!\n. Hi Lisa,\n\nthe 100 is the start position of the tween.\nThis can either be another Element or a scroll offset value.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Yes, but percent values need quotation marks. The correct Syntax is:\n\n```\nTweenMax.fromTo($('#example'), 1, {css:{top: \"70%\"}}, {css:{top: \"5%\"}});\n```\n\nNote that i left out the immediateRender part, because fromTo always sets immediateRender to true.\nBy the way: with the current version of tweenmax you can even omit the \"css\" part.\nSo this should also work:\n\n```\nTweenMax.fromTo($('#example'), 1, {top: \"70%\"}, {top: \"5%\"});\n```\n\nBut this is clearly a tweenMax, not a Superscrollorama issue :)\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Please don't put rumours about me in the world that I'm firing too early! :o)\n\nI'll have a look later...\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi Lisa,\n\nit is actually starting at scrolloffset of 0, so right at the beginning of the page.\nThe reason why is a bit tricky but i figured i'd show you how to find the solution instead of just telling you.\n\nlook at your pin in line 118.\n\nthe first parameter is the trigger element, the second is the pin duration and are the third the options for the animation etc.\n\nSo apparently your pin triggers to early. Why might that be?\n(btw. the same error exists with the other pins i've checked.)\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Well you're getting warmer...\nTry going to your site, opening the console in your browser and then put in this `$(\"#fighters\")` and hit enter.\nThen do the same thing with `$(\"#fighter\")`.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hey Lisa,\n\nthat's exactly the problem. There is no Element with the id \"fighers\". So maybe you forgot the wrappers in your DOM or something.\nAnyway that's why the animation happens too early. It just stats at the scroll position of 0.\nYour definition of the duration is correct.\nThe offset should be a pixel offset in relation to your trigger position.\nSo if you want the animation to start before the trigger is visible, use a positive offset, if you want to delay the animation use a negative offset.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. You're welcome...\n. Hi Benjamin,\n\nif it's only basic values you want to animate I suggest you tween an random object's value and then do the actual update in an \"onUpdate\" function.\n\nthis would work a bit like this [untested code]:\n\n```\nvar\n    myObject = {prop: $('#panel h1').position().top}, // start val of tween\n    tween = TweenMax.to(myObject, 1, {prop: 0}, onUpdate: function () {\n        if ( viewport().width < 720 ) {\n            $('#panel h1').css(\"top\", myObject.prop);\n        } else {\n            // bla\n        }\n    });\n\ncontroller.addTween('#panel', tween, 0, 50);\n```\n\nmake sure to have only minimum cpu needy functions in the onUpdate, for performance reasons.\n\nhope this helps, \nregards,\nJan\n. Allright :)\n\nlet us know if it works...\n. Hi and thank you for your input.\n\nThis will be addressed in [ScrollMagic](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic) (Superscrolloramas future Version).\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Benjamin,\n\nThe way to do this is have panel 3 inside panel 2. Then when panel 2 is pinned the animation is to animate panel 3 down (which had a negativ position before).\nSince there's probably more content in panel 2 though I would recommend a setup like this:\n\n``` HTML\n<div id=\"wrap\">\n    <div id=\"panel1\" class=\"pin\"></div>\n    <div id=\"panelwrap\" class=\"pin\">\n        <div id=\"panel2\"></div>\n        <div id=\"panel3\" class=\"animate\"></div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n(the classes are only to identify what to pin and what to animate)\nAlso make sure panel3 has position set to absolute so only panel 2 is affecting panelwrap's height.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Benjamin,\n\ndid you manage to sort it out?\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Lisa,\n\nthe reason for both issues is quite obvious.\nIt starts right at the beginning, because the starting position (left position) of your \"#fighters\" container is 0. So it is triggered as soon as the user starts scrolling and thus both the pin and the animations start.\nPosition you fighters wrapper correctly and it will work. :)\n\nAlso I noticed that you changed the superscrollorama base file setting the default for the scrolldirection (isVertical) to false.\nDon't do that. Instead when calling superscrollorama as you do in your animation.js on line 6 do it like this: `var controller = $.superscrollorama({isVertical: false});`.\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n. Hi!\n\nYou need to remove it from \"#main-menu\".\nBut I guess you figured it out, since you closed the issue already? :)\n\nregards,\nJ\n. no worries. :)\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi there,\n\nwithout any demo or console errors it's impossible to tell, but I don't think it's necesessary to do this like this.\nIf you are trying to run an animation only once, you can make use of the 'reverse' option like so:\n\n``` js\ncontroller.addTween(\n    '.fadeSade3',\n    TweenMax.from(\n        $('.fadeSade3'),\n        1.5,\n        {left:3000}\n    ),\n    0,\n    -(screen.height),\n    true\n);\n```\n\nAlso please mind, that Superscrollorama has been superseeded by [ScrollMagic](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic), which offers the same functionality with more features and better performance.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi Strazi,\n\nas soon as you add a tween to superscrollorama it takes control.\nMeaning it will always try to set it to the correct position (well what it regards as the correct position).\nAs a solution I would suggest you simply add a new Tween to the same object.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. no problem ;)\n\nIf you are starting a new project may I suggest trying [ScrollMagic](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic)?\nIt's basically release ready and only missing proper documentation and examples now.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi!\n\nThe first parameter for \"addTween is always the trigger.\ncatelayers is an array and thus doesn't work as a trigger.\nTry `controller.addTween(Toptree, staggerTween);` instead.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi!\nI don't think james meant for you to actually shrink the padding programmatically, like you did.\nJust set a fixed padding bottom and try to figure out the correct value so the flickering doesn't occur anymore.\nIn my experience the flickering is always for this reason: During Pin the element is fixed and doesn't account to the document's height or the position of the following elements.\nOnce unpinned it will though. So if there's a footer below it will be pushed further down, resulting in the page getting longer. This in turn makes your scroll position jump up a bit (because suddenly you are not at the end of the document anymore) and usually it jumps right back in to where the element is supposed to be pinned. Voil\u00e1, endless loop.\nThe solution is to make sure the Document has the correct length and it doesn't change.\nSet pushFollowers to false, define the size of the space before the footer (the duration of the pin) manually and make sure your pinned element or its container are positioned absolutely.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi!\n\nPlease try to be more precise. There is now way for me to know what is supposed to be animated and so I see no problem.\nPlease refer to a specific item, write how it should behave and where in your code you are trying to initiate that behaviour.\n\nAs to mobile performance I'm afraid there's not much wiggle room.\nYou could try rewriting your site to work with [ScrollMagic](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic), which has been written with better regard to mobile support.\nThe documentation and examples are already finished.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi!\n\nActually it does work. When I inspect the element and check the bottom css parameter is animated.\nThe reason it doesn't move is that changing this parameter has no effect.\nAs a good rule of thumb:\n**Always try running your tweens before adding them to Superscrollorama and see if they work.**\nIf they don't the problem is in your Tween setup or markup, not in Superscrollorama.\n\nIn your case the problem is that changing a bottom position only has an effect if the element is positioned relatively or absolutely.\nI tried \"position: relative\" on \"#cartel\" and it works.\nIt flickers though, which has to do with the fact, that you use it both as a tween target and a trigger. So changing it's position results in display errors.\nWhen tweening the position of an element never use it as a trigger for that tween.\n\nHope this helps.\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi @elegos,\n\nI'm having a really hard time understanding what it is you are trying to achieve and so obviously I cant even start to think about what the problem might be.\nIs it possible for you to create a simplified version of your desired outcome with as little markup as possible.\nFor example instead of images and all that just have 3 divs with different background colours and try to achieve the same effect.\nI often realized that the process of creating a simplified demo helped me to figure out what the problem might be in my own code.\nAnd if you still can't find it yourself it's a lot easier for me to help you.\n\nSo can you do that? Maybe even just as a jsfiddle?\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Guys,\n\nI'm closing all bug issues for Superscrollorama because it has been superceeded by ScrollMagic.\nhttps://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic\n\nPlease check if updating helps fix your problem.\nIf not, please post a new issue in the ScrollMagic issue section.\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n. Hi @mdfonda,\n\nAfter like a thousand refreshes I was able to see this error:\n\n```\nSCRIPT438: Object doesn't support property or method 'superscrollorama' \nproduction, line 156 character 4\n```\n\nIt points to where Superscrollorama is initialized.\nSo for some reason Superscrollorama is not available at the point where you try to init it.\n\nMy only good guess for a reason is that you load jQuery directly from their host.\nSo it MIGHT be that it is loaded after the superscrollorama plugin and thus \"overwrites\" it...\n\nTry putting jQuery on your own domain and loading it from there.\n\nIf the error perisists the only other thing I can think of is to check if superscrollorama is available before initializing it (something like this `if (!!$.superscrollorama){ /* do stuff */ }`).\nAnd if its not available try waiting (timeout) or even try reloading the js file.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi @mdfonda,\n\nas far as I can tell everything looks okay.\nSo is this issue sorted out now?\n\nregards,\nJ\n. you're welcome :)\n. Hi @mdfonda:\n\nWell the problem is that the superscrollorama file isnt properly loaded.\nIn your code on line 19 you try to load it from:\nhttp://eastcoworldwide.com/Proofs/chaplains/mobiletest/js/jquery.superscrollorama.js\n\nThat's a dead link. :)\n\nSo there's your problem.\n\nOn another note:\nIf you plan for future projects and especially if you wan to work with mobile compatibility, I STRONGLY suggest to have a look at [ScrollMagic](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic).\n\nScrollMagic is the successor to superscrollorama, built new from the ground up with a lot of new stuff.\nIt's currently close to release state (The only thing missing is a minified version and a project home page).\nSo have a look at the examples and the documentation and maybe you find it's far easier to use and more flexible.\n\nbest regards,\nJ\n. Well I would suggest you use modernizr and then do a check around your superscrollorama stuff.\nLike this:\n\n```\nif (!Modernizr.touch) {\n// do superscrollorama stuff\n}\n```\n\nthis way it will only be executed on non-touch devices.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. My favourite bugs are the one's that fix themselves. :)\n\nglad you could work it out.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi Andy,\n\nin theory superscrollorama should be able to keep your left positioning.\nBut as far as I remember this wasn't really stable for all possible dom configurations.\n\nThe easiest fix I suggest is this:\nMake a wrapper around your pinned element and pin the wrapper instead.\nThen position your visible element inside the wrapper.\nThis way it doesn't matter if the pinned element has the left position 0.\n\nhope this helps.\n\nbest regards,\nJ\n. any updates? :)\n. Hi Matt,\n\nthis bug is new, as far as I know.\nIf it is a new project or a small one, try refractoring to [ScrollMagic](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic).\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Please check out ScrollMagic, which explicitly supports mobile devices.\n\nhttp://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic\n. please check out ScrollMagic, as many issues have been addressed there.\nhttp://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic\n. Hi Larry,\n\nthank you for your commit.\nEven though development for SuperScrollorama has been suspended because it was replaced by [ScrollMagic](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic) (which already offers a destroy method) I would merge this pull request if you were so kind as to also include the new method into the documentation.\n\nthank you and kind regards,\nJ\n. Hi George,\n\nI'm sorry but there's not much I can tell  you. from the looks of it you are doing the SuperScrollorama stuff as you're supposed to.\n\nMy guess is there are other scripts interfering or your dom setup causes for this bug to appear.\nIt is for example not a good Idea to calculate and hard set the size of the viewport on load, like you do (what happens if the user resizes the browser?, think about responsiveness and use percentage values...)\nAlso you should consider wrapping multiple Tweens into one Timeline instead of attaching them successively to the controller.\nBut these are only sidenotes.\n\nAs to your actual problem I can only recommend to try to figure out which of your scripts breaks the site.\nIf you are convinced it is a SuperScrollorama issue I will have to ask you to port to [ScrollMagic](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic) and see if the error persists.\nIf it does file another issue in ScrollMagic's issue section.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi George,\nFirst, as I suggested, try to wrap multiple tweens into a timeline and then adding them to Superscrollorama.\nIf this shows no effect I'm gonna have to ask you again to switch to ScrollMagic, as there will be no bugfixing or other development on Superscrollorama.\nIf your problem persists with ScrollMagic we will try to fix it.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. It's very hard to guess what you are actually trying to do.\nPlease have a look at ScrollMagic, which replaced Superscrollorama.\nIt offers a lot of documentation and examples, which quite probably will answer all your questions.\n\nhttp://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic\n. Please take a look at the TweenMax method \"staggerTo\" and please also take a look at [ScrollMagic](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic), which has replaced Superscrollorama for a while now...\n. As it is also based on GSAP is similar, yes.\n. Support for Superscrollorama has been suspended.\nBut working with ScrollMagic shouldn't be a big deal if you come from Superscrollorama.\nSo feel free to ask about any problems you might have in the [ScrollMagic issues section](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic/issues).\n. Hi Ben!\n\nGlad you like the plugin.\nSuperscrollorama has ben superseded by [ScrollMagic](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic).\nThe logic is quite similar and I'm sure you'll have an easy time refactoring your code to ScrollMagic.\n\nOnce you did, you can make use of ScrollMagic's \"enabled\" method to temporarily disable the animations from happening: http://janpaepke.github.io/ScrollMagic/docs/ScrollMagic.Scene.html#enabled\n\nShould you have any problems moving to ScrollMagic or implementing this, please follow [ScrollMagic's troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#troubleshooting) and/or [post an issue](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic/issues).\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n. It looks like ScrollMagic code.\nPlease repost it in ScrollMagic support and try to give more context. A jsfiddle if possible.\n. Note, that support for Superscrollorama has been suspended, as it has been superseded by [ScrollMagic](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic).\nBut what you're probably looking fore is a simple `window.scrollTo(x, y)` with `x` being 0 and `y` being your target \"seek\" position.\n. Hi! The plugin was just updated to help you get it working on iOS.\nCheck out the new mobile_demo! :)\n. Hi!\n\nSorry for the late reply.\nDid you find a solution for your issue by now?\n\nregards,\nJan\n. A removeTween, removePin method will be added in future updates.\nDestroying the Superscrollorama instance itself should not be necessary.\n. I just added removeTween and removePin. See documentation for details. :)\n\nHope this helps.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Now you can use the method \"setOffsetPosition\".\n. Please try again with current version and let us know if the issue perisists.\n. Hi - It should be possible. Just prevent the respective links from jumping to the anchors and scroll smoothly to them using the TweenMax scrollTo Plugin.\nhttp://api.greensock.com/js/com/greensock/plugins/ScrollToPlugin.html\n. Hi! The plugin was just updated to help you get it working on iOS.\nCheck out the new mobile_demo! :)\n. Hi! I think the main reason for your performance issues is that you use jquery animate to scroll a quite large container.\nTry using the TweenMax scrollTo plugin to get better performance. http://api.greensock.com/js/com/greensock/plugins/ScrollToPlugin.html\n. Hi Aston and thank you for your message.\nThe reason for this phenomenon I believe to be the following:\nIt stop's working at the PIN IT section, when using the scrollbar.\nIn the current version of superscrollorama we introduced a new variable \"pushFollowers\" for pins, that defaults to true, reflecting the previous behaviour.\nWhen superscrollorama reaches a point where something needs to be pinned a spacer is expanded to \"push down\" following elements. This results in a change of the scale of the scrollbar.\nYou can observe this by looking at the scrollbar's size, when scrolling down using the mouswheel.\nThis change in scale, when reaching the pin-point results in a jump, as you are dragging the scrollbar.\n\nI already talked with John about a solution to this. To my mind the solution would be that the spacer should be expanded right from the beginning for pinned elements that \"push\" followers.\nThe reason we didn't implement this is that is rather complicated.\nFirst of all the spacer size changes, depending wether it should include the pinned element's size (when pinned) or not (when pinned). Secondly the spacer's position within the dom must change. (after the pin element, when before pinning, before the pin element after pinning.) And this in turn raises another issue as the spacer is also used to \"remember\" the original position of the pinned element.\n\nYou see we are aware of this issue and are considering how to resolve it. A solution could be to add another spacer after the pinned element, but we'd like to avoid adding elements to the dom if it's possible.\n\nFor now you can avoid this \"bug\" by setting \"pushFollowers\" to false and adding a large enough container after the pinned element. This way the body size doesn't change and you avoid the bug alltogether.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Good news, everyone! :)\n\nA solution might be near! Check it out: https://github.com/johnpolacek/superscrollorama/issues/94\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Brad,\n\nOn my console there's an error showing up on line 1931:\n-> var sw = splash.getStyle('width').toInt();\n\nThe line before you define splash to be var splash = $('jxtc51572c046130fspop');\nI think you meant to write var splash = $('#jxtc51572c046130fspop');\n\nThere are several more errors popping up for showcaseFX.js.\n\nThese errors might interfere with the code execution and prevent the scrolloramacode to be executed alltogether.\nplease try to get rid of all errors and if it still doesn't work I'll have a look again.\nI suggest you use chrome and look at the javascript console. (View -> developers -> javascript console)\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Steven,\n\nyou are correct. We overlooked this in the updated Marcy made, when she made the reverse option global.\nI'll update this right now (as it is an easy fix) and it will be pulled to the main repo asap.\n\nThank you for your help.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Damon,\n\nare you talking about pins or regular animations?\nWith pins it's possible, with animation not yet.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Damon,\n\nyes, to my mind it is useful for the same reasons I included the updatePin method.\nTo be honest the reason why I didn't build an updateTween method yet is because I didn't need it ;-).\nWe'll see, when John or I get around to implementing this...\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Damon,\n\nIf It's solely a vertical positioning issue you should try to work with percentages as left position values.\nI'll let you know once I got around to implement the updateTween method.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi jlevinsohn,\n\nactually I am sorry that I have made no progress in this regard. I just came back from my honeymoon and am quite busy now. I might get around to do it his month, but no promises. :-/\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Good news, everyone! :)\n\nA solution might be near! Check it out: https://github.com/johnpolacek/superscrollorama/issues/94\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi inamine,\n\nDo you mean for Superscrollorama or for ScrollMagic?\nFor Superscrollorama you can find an example on the [Demo Page](http://johnpolacek.github.io/superscrollorama/).\n(see the updatePin method).\nFor [ScrollMagic](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic) I didn't get around yet to make any examples or demos, because it is still in development.\nBut it's a lot more intuitive than Superscrollorama in regard to runtime updates.\nBasically you initiate like this:\n\n``` javascript\nvar controller = new ScrollMagic();\nvar scene = controller.addScene(\"#trigger\", {duration: 400, offset: -200})\n                      .pin(\"#pinelement\");\n```\n\nand then at any point in time you can do this:\n\n``` javascript\nscene.duration(600);\n```\n\nor this:\n\n``` javascript\nscene.offset(-100);\n```\n\nhope this helps!\nbest regards,\nJ\n. Hi Steven,\n\nI think the cleaner solution for this would be a \"removeTween\" method.\nThere should also be a removePin as well, I'll put it on my todo list, but don't know when I'll get around to do it...\n\nregards,\nJan\n. I just added removeTween and removePin. See documentation for details. :)\n\nHope this helps.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. To my mind it is in the code, because up until recently superscrollorama didn't work if you would have jumped past a pin or animation using an anchor link. It might also be there to trigger the first position check.\n\nI also stumbled over this line and I think it can be removed and \"doUpdateOnNextTick\" should be set to true from the start to init the first position check.\n. I decided to remove this line from the code.\nThis line really has nothing to do what superscrollorama is supposed to do and so might be a surprising side-effect to people using it.\nIf the user wants to do a forced scroll to top at page load he should do it outside of superscrollorama.\nIf not superscrollorama calculates the correct animation and pin states/positions, even if the page is loaded with an anchor link or refreshed having scrolled down.\nSo there's really no reason to keep the line.\n\nHope you agree, @johnpolacek?\n. Hi!\nHave a look into the greensock documentation, specifically the \"onStart\" param.\nhttp://api.greensock.com/js/com/greensock/TweenMax.html\nRegards,\nJan\n. Oh, now I think I understand what you're trying to do.\nSadly there is no onReverse callback in TweenMax.\nThe way I would approach it is this way:\nSet a global Variable named \"isRunning\" to false.\nPut a function at onStart and onComplete.\nIn it, check if \"isRunning\" is true.\nCase1: it's false: Set it to true, then execute your desired function.\nCase2: It's true: set it to false\n\nlet me know if that is your desired outcome.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi superflat, welcome to jquery and superscrollorama ;).\n\nI am not quite sure what you want to achieve.\nWhen you scroll back up the animation automatically reverses, but I guess that's not what yo're looking for.\nAs I understand you want to keep scrolling down and at a certain point reverse the animation.\n\nThere's two solutions for that:\nEither you just ad two tweens using superscrollorama, one going to your target position and one going back to the original. You just define different offsets for them.\n\nThe other is using TimelineMax.\nJust create a new TimelineMax Object, and add two TweenMax Objects to it (one going to x, one going back).\nThen add the TimelineMax Object using superscrollorama.\nCheck greensock Docs for more info: http://api.greensock.com/js/com/greensock/TimelineLite.html#add()\n\nhope that helps.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hey again,\n\nin TweenMax there are (among other ways) three major ways to do animations.\nusing .to, using .from and using .fromTo\n\nusing .to you define target values and TweenMax animates the object from its current state to the target.\nusing .from TweenMax takes the current state as the target and animates from your values to this original state.\nusing .fromTo you can define start and target values for your tween.\n\nIn your case just build a second tween where the target is the original position of your element. Then add that tween to superscrollorama at a higher offset point than the first.\n\nHave a deeper look into TweenMax, it's really quite brilliant.\nhttp://api.greensock.com/js/\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi!\n\nIt's kinda difficult to answer your questions without having seen the code.\nLet's see if I may understand correctly. though.\nIf you scroll a scrollcontainer using iScroll and in that container there is an element that is fixed, it will be scrolled out of view. The reason for that is the same why I described the pinned elements require a workaround.\nIt is due to a bug when using webkit-transform and fixed child elements.\nSee the [mobile docs](http://johnpolacek.github.com/superscrollorama/simpledemo_mobile.html) for details.\n\nAs far as I understand it there are two solutions for your problem:\n1st: (probably the better one) place your fixed item outside of the scrollwrapper. If it's supposed to be fixed all the time anyway this shouldn't be a problem.\n2nd: change useTransform to false for iScroll, as described in the mobile docs. But if you already fighting performance issues this might not be a good way to go...\n\nhope this helps.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Not sure, what you mean about the animations beeing forcefully updated, but if you don't use iScroll I am sure it won't run smoothly on mobile devices, as you can't use requestAnimationFrame to do the animation updates.\nI would again recommend to read the mobile docs very carefully.\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n. Hi Steven,\nI rushed to see if the pins were accidentally broken, but as you can see on the demo pages the pins are still working.\nWhen you update your pins (I think you meant to write updatePin) remember that it's position may be defined by the tween you passed. (should you tween its position).\n\nregardless: I can't find any errors in the superscrollorama code.\nIf come to the conclusion that it is the reason for your project breaking, please send me a demo link.\n\nI will be gone from the computer until sunday though.\n. Hi Steven,\n\nif this turns out to really be an issue with the new version I'd of course like to resolve it.\nSo if it's possible for you please prepare a demo where I can see the error (or it not working) and send me a link.\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n. Hi Kahla and welcome to the wonderful world of jQuery.\nPlease set up a demo page and send us the link so we can see your project.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi kahla,\n\nsorry for the late reply, i was quite busy.\nI think the error might be in line 50.\nYou are supposed to pass a reference object that is supposed to be pinned to the method.\nInstead you pass $().\nPut the animation you want to do in a wrapper and then pin this wrapper by passing it to the function.\nPlease read the documentation carefully for further details.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi wezyr, welcome.\n\nHow I go about these things is I take out the pin part and just add the tween. Then I check out the site and watch if the animation runs smoothly. If it doesn't it obviously has nothing to do with superscrollorama, but with TweenMax.\nI also suspect this to be the case here.\nSo please try to just get the animation working and when it does add it to the pin.\nIf it works in FF but breaks when you pin it, please write again.\nIf not please seek help in the [GSAP Support Forum](http://forums.greensock.com/forum/11-animation-tweening-js/).\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi JeffM and welcome,\n\nI'm not quite sure what you mean by a fallback preset. Do you care to elaborate?\n\nAs to your code it looks good on the first glance.\nI have suggested previously that a good way of debugging is just defining the tween without adding it to superscrollorama. Then check accross all browsers if the animation runs as expected. If not the fault lies with TweenMax and should be discussed in its [forums](http://forums.greensock.com/forum/11-animation-tweening-js/).\nIf the error only occurs in Superscrollorama I'd like to ask you to provide a demo link where I can have a look at the issue.\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n. Hi!\nThis is a decision @johnpolacek will have to make...\nWe'll see.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi!\nThank you for your input.\nThere are still some small issues I haven't got around to attend to (see open issues).\nOnce I do I will update the tag to 1.1.0\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Youri,\n\nsadly I don't have much time to look much into tweenlitemousewheel.\nBut taking a guess it scrolls the page content inside a container rather than scrolling the page itself. That would explain why the page scroll event doesn't fire (and thus superscrollorama doesn't get updated).\n\nPlease try this:\nLook at the \"setScrollContainerOffset\" method of superscrollorama in the [documentation](http://johnpolacek.github.io/superscrollorama/).\nThen add a function that fires on Move or Update or whatever tweenlitemouswheel probably fires constantly and update the scroll position manually.\n\nhope this helps :)\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n. Hi Gagarine,\n\nI saw that John already accepted your pull request. So the update is already in the code...\nThank you for contributing.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Simon,\n\nsorry for the misunderstanding.\n\nOkay in general I think it's preferable to avoid unnecessary calls instead of replacing the offset function.\nBut this is a very delicate subject and sometimes a call is needed for the right values.\nPlease make your changes and send a pull request.\n\nI will then go over your changes and make sure there will be no unexpected behaviour for other users.\n\nthank you and regards,\nJan\n. Hi Cezar,\n\nyes they can, but with some limitations.\nThey can only be pinned directly if they have no set value for their top position. It's a bit complicated to explain but long story short here's how you can make it work:\n\nEither have the positioning set to auto or wrap it inside another div that is positioned auto and pin that. The result should be the same. The outer div can be positioned relative or absolute (with top=auto).\n\nI have a list of examples of the ways elements can be pinned. I will post it in the near future.\n\nI hope that helps.\n\nregards,\nJan\n\nP.S.: Sorry for the late answer, I was on vacation.\n. Hi damassi,\n\nI think this comment was actually intended for a different question.\nI will copy it there.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Zach,\n\nI'm afraid this is a browser issue rather than a superscrollorama issue.\nYou can try to set overflow:hidden to the respective element, this might cause the browser to realize the contents of the div is not scrollable.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nregards,\nJan\n\nP.S.: Sorry for the late answer, I was on vacation.\n. Thank you Jojo, for your help.\n\nregards,\nJan\n\nP.S.: Sorry for the late answer, I was on vacation.\n. Hi Lenny,\n\nI hope I understand your question correctly.\nHere's what I would do:\nJust add two separate Animations to your object.\nFirst starts at 0 and scrolls for 1000 pixels and the second at 3000 (1000 + 2000 of standing still).\n\nHope this helps.\n\nregards,\nJan\n\nP.S.: Sorry for the late answer, I was on vacation.\n. Hi Alex,\n\nI have an idea: Do you call the removePin before the element has been pinned at least once?\n\nregards,\nJan\n\nP.S.: Sorry for the late answer, I was on vacation.\n. Hi Alex, not so fast with the closing :)\n\nDo you think we should fix this? So that there will be no type error even when the remove is called before pinning once? I kinda think so...\n\nregards,\nJan\n. It's on my todo list. :)\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Alex,\n\nThe fix is included in ScrollMagic: https://github.com/johnpolacek/superscrollorama/issues/94\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Aendrew,\n\nhere's how I would approach this:\nInstead of using the normal tween functions of TweenMax make a function where you pass the current tween value.\nInside this function you can have an if clause where you can check if the user is scrolling using a button or by himself. \nIf by himself animate you relement to the respective point.\nFor more information about tweening custom props using a function see this example:\nhttp://ahrengot.com/tutorials/greensock-javascript-animation/#animating-custom-properties\n\nHope this helps.\n\nregards,\nJan\n\nP.S.: Sorry for the late answer, I was on vacation.\n. Hi Gagarin,\n\nplease provide a demo of this bug.\nThank you.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Ho do you think we should implement a general fix for this into superscrollorama?\n. Hi @techiesplus13,\n\nI think what you're describing is a situation I described at length here: https://github.com/johnpolacek/superscrollorama/issues/29\n\nThe workaround for now is set push-followers to false and add an element that is high enough to pass the pin.\n\nIs this the same issue you were describing @gagarine?\nUntil now I thought you meant something else...\n\nlg J\n. No, that is wrong. It merely means that the elements that are below the pinned element will not be pushed down for the duration of the pin. that means if you don't have a big enough spacer you will scroll past the elements that come after the pinned one.\n. Both statements are correct! :)\nand we will...\n. Hi,\n\nI took a rough look and It's difficult to figure out what even happens there.\nTry to disable superscrollorama and see how the page behaves without it. (I suspect some errors in the dom, cause at the start there is a horizontal scroll bar).\nIf you have further questions please start a new issue, as your problems are usage questions and now about the bug described by @gagarine.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Good news, everyone! :)\n\nA solution might be near! Check it out: https://github.com/johnpolacek/superscrollorama/issues/94\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Do you pin something right from the start?\nIf so, make sure the trigger position is not a negative value.\n\nThis could happen if for example you have triggerAtCenter set to true and the pin element is positioned at the top of the body.\nSo if you start scrolling the script realizes \"wait a sec - i should have been pinned for a while\" and jumps to the center.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi Guys,\n\nI'm closing all bug issues for Superscrollorama because it has been superceeded by ScrollMagic.\nhttps://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic\n\nPlease check if updating helps fix your problem.\nIf not, please post a new issue in the ScrollMagic issue section.\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n. Hi pnick,\n\nSure you can - you can have more than one active pin at once. There should be no problem.\nIf your problem is that #page2 does not scroll up before the pin ends that means that you have \"pushFollowers\" set to true.\nThe solution is to make the space between the two manually. This means, make #page1, then a spacer (say 1000px height) and then #page2.\nThen make the Pin for #page1 2000px long and be sure to set \"pushFollowers\" to false \u2013> voila.\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n. You're welcome!\n\nIf you make something cool, be sure to send us the URL! :)\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi vossavant,\n\nthe way I would aproach this is by pinning it, without animating it. Then animate it using addTween, but set the Tween duration to 0, which will result in it not beeing linked to the scroll speed. It will always play out at the same speed you set using TweenMax.\nThe user will still skip it when he scrolls past the pin area, but the animation speed should be fine.\nAnd personally I wouldn't restrict your user beeing able to scroll until he saw all your animation. If he doesn't want to see it, he doesn't want to see it. If he does, he'll go back up. :)\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Github user [damassi](https://github.com/damassi) also posted this solution (accidentally on the wrong question, but it might help you.\n\nThere actually is a way to do this, but its kinda crazy.  (Excuse the pseudocode.)\n\n```\nvar controller = $.superscrollorama({\n    triggerAtCenter: true,\n    playoutAnimations: false,\n    reverse: false\n});\n\nvar pos\n\n// prevent the user from scrolling anywhere\nfunction onScroll() { \n      if( $(document).scrollTop() > pos )\n          $(document).scrollTop( pos )\n      })\n}\n\nvar timeline = new TimelineMax()\n\ntimeline.append( TweenMax.to( $('#hi', 3, { y: 1000, onComplete: function() {\n    // Release the window and continue on\n    $(document).off( 'scroll', onScroll )\n}}))\n\ncontroller.pin($('#hi'), 3000, {\n    anim: timeline,\n\n   onPin: function() {\n        // Store the current window position\n        var pos = $(document).scrollTop()\n\n       // Start listening to scroll events\n       $(document).on('scroll', onScroll )\n\n        // remove the pin so that it will pick up changes\n        controller.removePin( '#plushupper-tagline' )\n\n       // Start listening to mousewheel events\n       $(window).bind('mousewheel', function(event) {\n         // scrolling up\n             if (event.originalEvent.wheelDelta >= 0) {\n                 timeline.time( timeline.time() -= .1 )\n             }\n\n             // scrolling down\n             else {\n                  timeline.time( timeline.time() += .1 )\n             }\n      });\n    }\n});\n```\n. Hi eppel,\n\nwelcome. I am sorry to tell you that this is a rather advanced plugin.\nBefore you start playing around with it you should familiarize yourself with jQuery and TweenMax or this won't be the last roadblock you hit.\nYour sample code would actually be working - it would fade out a div with the id \"y\", once you scroll past it.\nSo what you need in your DOM for any kind of effect is a div like this:\n`<div id=\"y\">I will be faded out</div>`\n\nHope this helps,\nJan\n. Hi Eppel,\n\nI'm not really sure what you mean by \"a scroll line as the target\". Can you clarify?\nIf it's a superscrollorama related issue I'd be happy to help.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Eppel,\n\nthere actually is an example, right below the documentation of \"addTween\".\nThere it says:\n\u00b4\u00b4\u00b4\ncontroller.addTween('#fade', \n        TweenMax.from($('#fade'), .5, {css:{opacity:0}}));\n\u00b4\u00b4\u00b4\nSo in this case '#fade' is the target. A target is sort of a reference of where an animation should start.\nIf it's a number then the animation will be triggered at the respective offset from the top.\nIf it's a selector (like in this case) or a jQuery object (which is basically the same thing, but with $() wrapped around it) then this element will be used as a reference. So when the scroll position reaches the top offset of this element the animation will start.\n\nI hope this clears things up for you.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Aris,\n\non a first glance your code does look fine.\n\nHere are some notes that might help you:\nThe first parameter for addTween doesn't necessarily have to be the element that is animated. It is the reference that is used to know when (where) the animation should start.\n\nAs I built sites where this exact case does work (refreshing below animations) I am quite confident it's not a  problem with superscrollorama. See [here](http://public.orsi-and-jan.info/).\n\nSo my guess is that it may have something to do with your setup, specifically the loading algorithm. Maybe the elements are not available when superscrollorama is called or their position values are set afterwards.\nThe way I would approach this is by console.logging some values within the checkAnim method and see if everything is like it should be.\n\nIf you end up not finding a solution you may use this dirty workaround: do a `window.scrollTo(0, 0);` on page load.\nRemember this is sort of a developer-problem an end user would probably never do. (why would you scroll down a page, refresh and scroll back up).\n\nI do however understand the need to have it work \"clean\". So good luck with that.\nIf you figure out what the problem was, please let us know.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Aris,\n\nnothing besmirched here :)\nGlad you got your project working.\n\ntake care,\nJan\n. Hi pmtarantino,\n\nwhat exactly do you mean by \"fragmented scroll behaviour\"?\nAnd is it possible for you to provide a demo of this phenomenon?\nI have never heard of this issue and don't see a white box in chrome anywhere on the project page.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi pmtarantino,\n\ndo you mean this?\n![Screenshot](http://s23.postimg.org/e6anaks8b/Bildschirmfoto_2013_07_25_um_11_53_16.png)\n\nIf yes this is actually a feature of Chrome.\nTo see how to disable it see [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12046315/prevent-overscolling-of-web-page).\n\nIf this is not what you meant I'm at a loss.\nI tried really hard to reproduce what you describe by scrolling fast or slow, using the mousewheel, trackpad or scrollbar.\nNo success...\n. Hi Patricio,\n\nthis is another hint this is a browser issue rather than a superscrollorama issue.\nCan you update to the latest chrome version (28) and then try again?\nDownload [here](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser)\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Patricio,\n\nthis is so weird. I have no chance of seing this bug happen, so I have no idea how I should approach a fix.\nIf you can narrow it down and find out what may cause these glitches we might find a solution.\nBut if you can't I'm afraid we're at a loss.\n\nI can't fix something I can't see...\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Yes, darren, thank you for clearing this mystery up. :)\n. If anything, this is a TweenMax issue.\n\nTweens need to be paused in order to be played at the right time.\n\nTry adding your staggered Tween to a TimelineMax Object and adding this to superscrollorama.\n\nHope this helps,\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Try this\n\n```\nvar controller = $.superscrollorama();\n\nvar staggerTween = new TimelineMax();\nstaggerTween.add(TweenMax.staggerFrom($('.myclass li'), 1, {css:{top:50, alpha:0}}, 0.2));\n\ncontroller.addTween('.myclass li', staggerTween);\ncontroller.addTween('#myid .left', TweenMax.from( $('#myid .left'), 0.5, {css:{right:'500px',rotation: 0,opacity: 0}, ease:Quad.easeInOut},0.1));\n```\n. Hi and welcome.\n\nYes I do. It's an error thrown because an element is missing.\nYou are trying to tween an element and that element is undefined. Check the selector.\nOr maybe you're setting the tween before the object is available. Be sure to use $(document).ready().\n\nHope this helps.\n\nRegards,\nJan\n. I am sure the reason for the error is that the element you are trying to tween is not available at the time you are placing the call.\nPlease try to make sure of that and zone in on the error.\nThis is because I came across this error a couple of times myself.\nIf you can't figure it out please provide a demo page so I can have a look.\nRegards,\nJan\n. Also try to remove the lines you posted and see if the error persists. It's curious because you are not tweening the top position in the example code provided.\n. Hi contempoinc,\n\nthe reason for your error is that you run jQuery in noconflict mode. That is why the $ element is not available, when needed to get the top position of a an element.\nTo resolve this you can disable the noconflict mode, or if you need it, you can try this:\n\nAdd this line to superscrollorama below line 18:\n`var $ = jQuery;`\n\nIt's just a shot in the dark, it might help though...\nLet me know if it works, if yes, we might include that line into superscrollorama...\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Did you also update the demo site?\nCause there the superscrollorama file is still the same and jQuery still runs in noconflict mode.\nAlso there is this error:\n`Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'jpreLoader'`\n. Heyho,\n\nI'm afraid the error still exists - except now it only appears once you scroll down.\nThis is really curious.\nCan you please try to disable jQuery noconflict mode, to make sure this is what's causing the problems?\nIf we can narrow it down to this we can start to find a fix...\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hehe, okay, I think I figured it out.\nSometimes it helps to read the jQuery documentation :)\n\nFor [jQuery.noConflict()](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/) it says there:\n\n```\njQuery.noConflict();\n(function($) {\n  $(function() {\n    // more code using $ as alias to jQuery\n  });\n})(jQuery);\n// other code using $ as an alias to the other library\n```\n\nSo it's really only a matter of wrapping this around your document ready statement:\n\n```\n(function($) {\n// your stuff\n})(jQuery);\n```\n\nI already tried it out and it seems to work...\n\nHope this helps, best regards,\nJan\n. Shit, I think i got it.\n\nMy first guess was actually correct. The element you are trying to tween is not available. Well one of them.\nIt has nothing to do with the noconflict mode. It was just difficult finding the problem, because for some reason all your sourcecode is without linewraps.\n\nI was just always checking for \".fly-it\", but the element that is missing is actually \".fade-it\".\n\nPlease make sure that this element exists. AND is not set to display: none.\nThe reason for this is that for elements that have this style it's impossible to calculate the offset position.\nSee here for details: http://api.jquery.com/offset\n\nActually there is a small fix for this in the latest version of superscrollorama to avoid an error when an element is set to display: none. So be sure to download the latest version. Of course the animation still wouldn't work but at least there'd be no error.\n\nI think we finally solved this one, right?\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi!\n\nDid you manage to sort this out?\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi tombo,\n\nUnfortunately if you can't provide a demo page where I can have a look at the phenomenon I won't be able to help you...\n\nIs it possible to provide one?\n\nRegards,\nJan\n. As I said I sadly won't be able to help you unless you provide a public demo...\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Well you actually said you'd try to get something public facing.\nReally no need to get snappy.\nIf you are willing to share the library you used please do, as it might help others.\n\nBest of luck,\nJan\n. Hi tombo,\n\nI understand.\nImpending deadlines can be a pain.\nLet's hope you'll have another project some time, maybe with a little more time, and you get a chance to try out superscrollorama.\n\nRegards,\nJan\n. Hi Justin,\n\nthis is actually a common problem associated with WYSIWYG editors, like Dreamweaver.\nThey almost never get it 100% right. The only way to make sure is to do it by hand.\n\nI assume your problems don't really have anything to do with superscrollorama, but rather with some errors in the DOM or CSS, which chrome and firefox handle better than safari.\n\nI suggest you deactivate superscrollorama and try to get the positioning in safari right, before you reactivate it.\nSafari is definitely supported, both by superscrollorama and TweenMax.\n\nI hope this helps,\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi!\n\nSure it's possible!\nYou can either add multiple pins to multiple objects or if they should be pinned at the same time have them in a wrapper and pin the wrapper.\nKeep in mind that you can add more than one animation to one pin using the TweenMax object TimelineMax.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi vossavant,\n\nI'm not a 100% sure I understand what you are trying to do, but I think you are looking for this:\n\n```\n// prepare animation\nvar pinAnimation = new TimelineLite()\n        .append( TweenMax.from( $( '#our-work h1' ), 3, { right : '-500px' } ) )\n        .append( TweenMax.to( $( '#our-work nav' ), 3, { left : '160px' } ) );\n\n// add each portfolio item\n$( '#portfolio-inner .item' ).each( function() {\n        pinAnimation.append(\n                TweenMax.from( $( this ), 1, { \n                    delay : Math.random() * .2,\n                    css : { opacity : 0, x: Math.random() * maxX - (maxX / 2), y: Math.random() * maxY - (maxY / 2) },\n                    ease    : Power3.easeInOut\n                } )\n        );\n} );\n\n// create pin\ncontroller.pin( $( '#our-work' ), 3000, {\n    anim : pinAnimation,\n    onPin: function() {\n        $( '#our-work' ).css( 'height', '100%' );\n    }, \n    onUnpin: function() {\n        $( '#our-work' ).css( 'height', '1000px' );\n    }\n} );\n```\n\nThis way though the elements will all be animated in sequence, but during the pin.\nIf you want to start them simultaneously put them into an array and add them together.\nLook at the \"delay\" option to tune your animation to your needs.\nAlso you should use \"add\" instead of \"append\", as it is deprecated.\n\nMore info see here: http://api.greensock.com/js/com/greensock/TimelineMax.html\n\nhope this helps, best regards,\nJan\n\nP.S.: The way I build animations for superscrollorama is just adding the TweenMax options, without adding them to superscrollorama. Only once I get the animation the way I want it I add it to superscrollorama.\n. Glad I could help! :-)\n\nRegards, Jan\n. Hi Tomarz,\n\nsure it is!\nAdd two TweenMax objects to one TimelineMax object and add this to superscollorama.\nSee here for an example: https://github.com/johnpolacek/superscrollorama/issues/74\n\nregards,\nJan\n. hi!\n\n1)\nWhen checking your example it seems to be working nicely. Is it because it's currently optimized for mac? (I'm looking at it from my mac). I can't really see anything wrong with it.\n\n2) I tried zooming in using chrome on the demo page (http://johnpolacek.github.io/superscrollorama/) and even on your example page. Both seem to work!\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi! Please see my last answer to question https://github.com/johnpolacek/superscrollorama/issues/78 .\nThis should help you :)\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n. You're welcome. :)\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Dude, here's how I'd approach it:\nIf you want the animation played you need to simulate scrolling instead of the regular behaviour of an anchor (which is jumping to it). So check out: the Greensock Scroll Plugin: http://api.greensock.com/js/com/greensock/plugins/ScrollToPlugin.html\n\nThen I would replace the default action of any or all anchors with scrolling to it instead of jumping to it.\nSomething like this (**untested**):\n\n```\n$(\"a[href^=#]\").each(function(e) {\n     e.preventDefault();\n     var offset = $(this).offset();\n     TweenLite.to(window, 2, {scrollTo:{y:offset.top}, ease:Power2.easeOut});\n});\n```\n\nHope this helps! :)\nhave fun,\nJan\n. try\n\n```\n$('#anchorDiv').click(function(e) {\n     e.preventDefault();\n     var offset = $('#TargetDiv').offset();\n     TweenLite.to(window, 2, {scrollTo:{y:offset.top,x:0}, ease:Power2.easeOut});\n});\n```\n. All right cool!\nAnd you're right it does seem like a bug in TweenMax.\nAlso some googling suggested that it's not an issue for all browsers...\nAnyway - I'm gonna close this.\nGlad all worked out for you.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi softvar,\n\nthank you for pointing out this error, but I'm afraid you made a typo yourself in line 372.\nPlease fix the Font Link (Closing Quotes instead of \"The callback functions\") and commit again.\nI will merge it then.\n\nthanks & regards,\nJan\n. thanks. :)\n. Hi!\n\nActually with your current script you already have several simultaneous pins, if the distance between the elements is less than 2000. :)\nIt Looks to me that the solution would just be to have your ending pin (the ???) element positioned right where the last article pin ends. So 2000px below it's starting position.\nAs superscrollorama is very exact the pin should then start right after the last article pin ended.\nIf you want to start a little earlier or later, use the offset option.\n\nHope this helps,\nregards,\nJan\n. No worries, glad I could help.\nTake care! :)\n. Hi Joe and welcome to superscrollorama,\n\nthis is actually a TweenMax issue, but since you're here, I'll help ya out.\nThe code you are looking for is:\n\n```\ncontroller.addTween(\n                '#gun',\n                (new TimelineLite())\n                    .add([\n                        TweenMax.fromTo($('#hammer'), 1, \n                            {css:{rotation: 0}, immediateRender:true}, \n                            {css:{rotation: -25}, ease:Quad.easeInOut}),\n                        TweenMax.fromTo($('#trigger'), 1, \n                            {css:{rotation: 0}, immediateRender:true}, \n                            {css:{rotation: 40}, ease:Quad.easeInOut})\n                        ])\n                    .add(\n                        TweenMax.to($('#hammer'), 1, {css:{rotation: 0}}), \n                        ),\n            500, // scroll duration of tween\n            200 // offset?\n); \n```\n\nFor more information see: http://api.greensock.com/js\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Joe,\n\nactually the reason nothing moves at all is that there is a grave error in your code.\nPlease use the javascript console for debugging, before posting here, as this is a very obvious error.\n\nCompare your code to mine again thoroughly and I'm sure you'll see where you went wrong.\n\ngood luck and kind regards,\nJan\n. Hi Joe,\n\nAs I mentioned right at the beginning this is actually a TweenMax Issue.\nI am sorry that superscrollorama is not really a copy & paste solution.\nIt requires extensive knowledge of javascript and a firm understanding of TweenMax.\nAnd to aquire both I'm afraid this is not the right place.\n\nBut I'll try to rewrite the code for you again and hope this helps you understand how superscrollorama works:\n\n```\n<script>\n    $(document).ready(function() {\n        // init controller\n        var controller = $.superscrollorama();\n\n        // build animation\n        var myAnimation = new TimelineMax();\n        myAnimation.add([\n                    TweenMax.fromTo($('#hammer'), 1, \n                        {css:{rotation: 0}, immediateRender:true}, \n                        {css:{rotation: -25}, ease:Quad.easeInOut}),\n                    TweenMax.fromTo($('#trigger'), 1, \n                        {css:{rotation: 0}, immediateRender:true}, \n                        {css:{rotation: 40}, ease:Quad.easeInOut})\n            ])\n            .add(\n                    TweenMax.to($('#hammer'), 1, {css:{rotation: 0}})\n            );\n\n        // add the tween to superscrollorama\n        controller.addTween('#gun', myAnimation, 500, 200);\n    });\n</script>\n```\n\nIf you leave the last line out (try commenting it out) then the animation should just play.\nThis is actually how I usually build animations for superscrollorama.\nI build the timeline, watch if it plays like i want and only at the end I add the Tween to superscrollorama.\n\nHope this clarifys it for you.\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n. Hi Joe,\n\ndid you manage to solve your problem?\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi!\n\nI think you stumbled upon a bug here. Well actually It's hard to tell as it might be desired behaviour.\nThe removePin method does not remove the spacers. This is because if it would the position of the pinned element would be reset to where it was before it was pinned.\nRight now I'm thinking about including an option switch in the method in the next update to let the user decide if he wants the spacers removed as well.\n\nTo avoid the creation of spacers altogether you might want to set \"pushFollowers\" to false.\nThen you'll have to set the distance between the pinned elements manually (create a spacer element yourself)\n\nHope this helps,\nregards,\nJan\n. Heyho,\n\nyou're actually right! The spacer is created, even when pushFollowers is set to true. The reason is that the spacer is used to \"remember\" where the pinned element was originally positioned. As the position might change when resizing the site (e.g. with div 100% wrappers) this is necessary.\nBut when using pushFollowers:false the spacer is not resized.\n\nTo answer your second question: Yes you should have a spacer after each element with the height of your pin duration.\n\nlet's get the remove work properly first and then we can worry about the jump :).\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi Ryan,\n\nI don't think I can see what you mean. I checked out your staging link and to me it looks like the distance between the articles is the same...\nAlso I don't see what you mean with the \"strange jump\" at the bottom.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Ryan,\n\nI'm guessing the \"jitter\" had to do with the expanding spacers and it's gone now because you use static ones.\nThis is actually planned for future versions of superscrollorama, as you can read here and here .\n\nIf the space betweeen your first and second element is due to the height of your first spacer (2000px) (after chapter0).\nJust reduce the height to like 200px and you should be fine...\n\nregards,\nJ\n. no seat. take care and if you figure out a solution be sure to post it here :)\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi Jordan,\n\nsadly with the current version of superscrollorama there is no way of setting the reference point to the bottom of the page. This is something we have planned for future versions.\nBut here's something that might serve you as a workaround:\n\nCreate a container for the element that you want to animate. Set it's height to 100% of the window's height.\nThen position your element inside of the container using css \"bottom\" positioning.\nThen add the tween in reference to the container, so that when the container hits the top of the page your element will be at the bottom. \nHope this is clear enough.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Jerczu,\n\nPlease check the documentation under http://johnpolacek.github.io/superscrollorama.\nThere you can see that you can also pass an animation for pins.\nThis animation will play for the duration of the pin and this should be what you are looking for.\n\nhope this helps,\nbest regards,\nJan\n. Hi Jordan,\n\nunfortunately I'm having a really hard time to understand what it is you are trying to do and what exactly might be the problem.\nPlease elaborate a little and try to make it as simple as possible. Also a demo Site might help.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Congrats on figuring it out! :)\n\nThe site looks nice!\n\nregards,\nJ\n. I guess you figured it out? :)\n. Yes, the addTween method has a \"reverse\" option, which, if set to false, disables the reverse animation when scrolling up.\nFor more information see the documentation: http://johnpolacek.github.io/superscrollorama/\n\nregards,\nJ\n. This is very curious, as I remember having this exact same problem when developing http://public.orsi-and-jan.info.\nI'm not sure if I was able to iron it out in the end and I cant test it at the moment. It does work on this machine though (OSX 10.6.8, Safari 5.1.9).\n\nAnyways: I think this is a TweenMax Issue.\nTo verify you could disable all superscrollorama animations and try then.\nIf the error persists (which I'm guessing) I'm afraid you'll have try your luck in the [greensock forums](http://forums.greensock.com/forum/11-animation-tweening-js/).\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi Trever,\n\nAs I said I suspect it's a TweenMax issue.\nHave you tried disabling superscrollorama as I said above?\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Andi,\n\nsch\u00f6n, wenn sich Probleme so einfach l\u00f6sen! :)\nViel Erfolg weiterhin!\n\nlg J\n. Try adding the Tween to a Timeline and then adding that timeline to superscrollorama.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi!\n\nWhenever you set the duration to 0 (when using pin or addTween) the animation will just play when reaching the trigger-position.\nI think that's what you are looking for, right? :)\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi again!\n\nyou're very welcome! :)\nActually I think there is a better way to do what you want to achieve.\nWhy not adding multiple tweens at the same offset position?\nOne could have a duration and one not, causing one to be linked to the scroll-play-head and one autoplaying.\n\nThere's really no need to force everything into one timeline object as superscrollorama is also very exact.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi vishi,\n\nI'm sorry but you are wrong. If html and body are set to height 100% (which you would do to have divs expanded at 100% height) it has no effect superscrollorama.\nObviously the page contents needs to be higher than the window to be able to scroll.\nAs a proof you can check here: http://public.orsi-and-jan.info/home\nThere html and body are set to 100% height and it still works.\n\nSo whatever prevents your code from working must be something else.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Well I'm glad that you were able to resolve the issue :).\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi!\n\nOn a first glance it is difficult for me to figure out what causes the problem on your demo.\nMy guess is that it has to do with one of the main issues of superscrollorama that a lot of users faced:\nThe behaviour of the spacers, just expanding when reaching a pin trigger.\n\nWhat I think is happening is that the spacers expand and colapse at the wrong times when scrolling up, causing the page to reach a certain scrollpoint multiple times, which in turn causes your animations to be played multiple times.\nI am actually at the moment working on a complete rewrite of superscrollorama that includes many changes, first and foremost fixing this (annoying) issue.\n\nIn the meantime you should try what I suggested to a couple of other people allready: set \"pushFollowers\" to false and create your own spacers after your pinned elements. For example if you want to pin it for 5000px put in an empty div after the pinned element with the height of 5000px.\n\nLet me know if this helps in this case,\nregards,\nJ\n. Okay, here's another approach.\nIf you use elements both as triggers (where should something start) and the target of animations (what should start) there might be some problems:\nIf you animate the position of elements or when pinning them their offset positions are changed.\nSo what I suggest is: Keep the triggers (first argument in addTween or addPin) and the Animation Targets (first argument for TweenMax) seperate. And make sure the triggers don't change position.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. You're welcome! :)\n. Development on ScrollMagic is finished and version 1.0.0 was released.\n. Hi Ryan,\n\nI'm afraid I'm having trouble reprodrucing the error. I can both scroll to the very bottom and click the contact link (both looks the same to me). Maybe a little demo-video of the issue would help me understand?\n\nAnother way might be this:\nHave you read that I started working on [ScrollMagic](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic)?\nIt's Superscrolloramas Child so to say. :) It is still in pre-release and in a very early state but maybe you can try it out for that very last bit. See how it goes...\nI build it with all the nagging little issues in mind that always popped up.\n\nImportant: I have not tested yet how it behaves with pin elements and the triggers being the same. So please make sure they are seperate. Maybe set up a test-case to find out how it works. Here are some notes: https://github.com/johnpolacek/superscrollorama/issues/94\nLet me know how it goes.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi Ryan,\n\nsorry for the late answer, I was gone for a few days...\nObviously I didn't expect you to rewrite everything. I just thought you might want to try it on the last section. Superscrollorama and ScrollMagic should be able to coexist.\n\nI looked at the screencapture and can finally reproduce the problem.\nWhen I scroll down I see the top value of the div.inner decreasing.\nAre you tweening it?\nI think what's causing the problem is the fact that the top position of the trigger element keeps changing.\nTry to seperate trigger and tween element and try again.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. I'll close this for now, not because I think it's fixed, but because I really don't see a good solution.\nI will focus on resolving this issue when I continue working on ScrollMagic.\n. Hello and welcome Eduardo,\n\nI'm afraid the page is empty, I don't see any content to scroll :).\nHave you changed it somehow?\n\nregards,\nJ\n. The reason for the + jumping is that the tween is triggered right from the start. Superscrollorama just doesn't refresh right at the start, it only does that on scroll.\nIf you want to update the positions on page load, try adding  `controller.triggerCheckAnim()` right after adding the tween.\n\nA better way though would be to get the starting position right and trigger the tween only AFTER the user has scrolled.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi Nathinah,\n\nActually superscrollorama usually works with elements as triggers.\nWhat you do with the above code is running the animation, when slide5 is scrolled into view, which is exactly what you want, right?\nIf you want it to start, when it's fully visible, try changing the triggerAtCenter option to false.\n\nIf you want more control over WHERE in the viewport the trigger should be when the animation starts, try the successor to superscrollroama: [ScrollMagic](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic)\nPlease mind though that I'm still working on it and it is not yet finished.\n\nbest regards,\nJ\n. Hello and welcome jkrot,\n\nI am really sorry, but I'm having a really hard time understanding your problem.\nIs there maybe a demo page where I could actually look at the problem and the source code?\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Ok I'm assuming this is a phenomenon that is caused by superscrolloramas handling of pin spacers.\nThe current behaviour is that they expand only once the pin has started (or stay expanded afterwards, respectively).\nI'm guessing this is what messes up the anchors: The positions are actually correct, but by the time you get there they have changed.\n\nSo what you should try is what I recommended a lot of times now:\nSet pushFollowers to false and add your own spacers for the duration of the pin.\nSo for example you have a div and want to pin it for 300px, then add a spacer div after it and make it 300px in height.\n\nThis is actually one of the most problematic things about superscrollorama and I entirely reworked it in ScrollMagic.\nThere spacers wrap around pin elements, and expand right from the start.\nEven though this already works it is still in pre-release phase so probably not interesting for a working project.\nBut if you want to give it a whirl, feel free to do so:\nSee Issue https://github.com/johnpolacek/superscrollorama/issues/94\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n. Hi jkrot,\nactually there is quite a lot of documentation already. Have you checked the docu folder?\nWhats missing though are examples...\n\nI still don't really understand your problem. Do you have skype or something so we could talk this through?\nOr some IM if you prefer?\n\nregards,\nJ\n. For the record:\nWe resolved the issue by setting all pushFollowers to false and adding manual spacers.\n. Uh - that's a tough one...\nActually I've never run into that.\nSo basically you want  your tween to be different when scrolling up...\nYou couldn't change it mid-tween anyway, as the position would change if you changed it while tweening.\nBut what you can try is supplying a function in the onComplete callback of the tween, then remove it and add a new one. With that one have a an onStart Callback, that changes it back to the original one...\n\nthis might work, but no guarantees ;)\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hiho!\n\nCheck the [documentation](http://johnpolacek.github.com/superscrollorama/) and you'll find that apart from anim, onPin and onUnpin you can pass an offset variable.\nI assume that's what you're looking for?\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Sorry, corrected the link...\n\nIf you want to have a pin start as soon as the trigger enters the viewport you'll have to use half the height of the viewport as the offset (if you have triggerAtCenter: true).\nThe problem is that this must be updated whenever the page is resized. So you need to call updatePin on every window resize and set the new offset.\n\nThis is an Issue that I resolved in [ScrollMagic](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic), the future version of Superscrollorama.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. You're one level to deep (that sounds wrong, too)\ntry:\n\n```\nonPin: function() {\n     $('#heelwrapper').css('height','100%');\n},\noffset: 800\n```\n. glad that everything worked out...\n\nGenau genommen bin ich Deutscher, aber auch die sind manchmal freundlich ;)\n. soll schon vorgekommen sein...\n. Hi James,\n\nagain I'm really having trouble following your train of thought.\nPlease try to put yourself into the position of someone that is not as deep inside the code as you surely must be by now. If possible simplify the problem or make a demo page with one single element and one single occurrence of your suspected error.\nThis makes it much easier for you and for us to track down the problem.\n\nThat beeing said I have one suspicion as to what's causing your problems.\nYou use your pinned elements both as triggers as well as subjects of your animations.\nThis is generally okay if all you do is change colors or opacity. But when you start changing the position or size that's where problems (might) start.\nIf your pin element is 800px of height before the pin and only 200px as is the case with your #platform-intro this obviously influences the position of following elements.\nThat's what might be causing problems with the trigger positions, when scrolling back up.\n\nHere's how I would approach it:\nTry to have the triggers seperate from your tween-targets.\nOr even better: have wrappers around the sections you want to pin and only use them to pin. Any changes in size or position do on the Section itself INSIDE the pinned element.\n\nHope this helps,\nbest regards,\nJan\n. Hi James,\n\nthank you so much for investigating this!\nI am very glad you got to the bottom of this issue.\nThis seems indeed to be a bug, although I have some small objections to your fix.\nI will post them in the pull request...\n\nThanks and I'm happy this worked out for you,\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Stefan,\n\nThe way you set things up it's supposed to behave exactly like it does.\nYou do a tween to 1 at 100 pixels in and a tween back to 0 at 800. So if you do a reload and jump past 800 and you scroll back upwards it means to superscrollorama animate from 0 to what it was before. What it was before was 0 though, because you set that in the css. It's different when you scroll down normally, as then the \"before-value\" is 1, because you hit the first trigger.\n\nHere's how you get what you want:\ninstead of TweenMax.to use TweenMax.fromTo.\nThere you can set a start and an end value to a tween.\nThis way you can make sure it is always tweened the way you want.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Freut mich!\nViel Spa\u00df noch... :-)\n. Hi Stefano,\n\nplease provide a demo so I can have a look at it. :)\n(Although I suspect it might have something to do with the playoutAnimations option).\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Ah, I guess, I know whats happening.\nWhen you scroll too fast the first tween is still running when the second is supposed to start.\nSo what you'll need to do is tell TweenMax to overwrite other tweens if there are still running some.\nThis can be achieved using the overwrite option of TweenMax.\nThe Tweenmax Documentation says:\n\n```\n\"auto\" (2) - when the tween renders for the first time, it will analyze tweens of the same target that are currently active/running and only overwrite individual tweening properties that overlap/conflict. Tweens that haven't begun yet are ignored. For example, if another active tween is found that is tweening 3 properties, only 1 of which it shares in common with the new tween, the other 2 properties will be left alone. Only the conflicting property gets overwritten/killed. This is the default mode and typically the most intuitive for developers.\n```\n\nSo what I think you should do is define your Tweens like this:\n\n``` js\n        var tweenIn1 = TweenMax.fromTo($('#textleft'), .3, {\n            css: {                    \n                top: '22%'\n            },\n            overwrite: \"auto\",\n            ease: Back.easeOut\n        });\n```\n\nas an extra bonus tip note, that with the current version of TweenMax you dont have to use css options as an object anymore...\n\n``` js\n        var tweenIn1 = TweenMax.fromTo($('#textleft'), .3, {\n            top: '22%',\n            overwrite: \"auto\",\n            ease: Back.easeOut\n        });\n```\n. Hi Stefano,\n\nI agree with James.\nPlease follow his advice and if it still doesn't work, you'll have to provide some form of demo for us to be able to help you.\nIf you cant show your production page just make a quick dummy where you show the phenomenon.\nIsolating the issue may even help you figuring out what the problem is yourself...\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi Stefano,\n\nthank you for setting up the demo. This helps a lot.\n\nI think I might understand now. To my mind superscrollorama does exactly what is supposed to, namely positioning the box exactly where it's supposed to be at the respective point in time.\nSo if you go fast you won't see it going from left to right, but go to bottom instead (as that's the position it's supposed to be at at that point).\nSince you have playoutAnimations set to true sometimes this may cause it to animate differently than expected. (as the start position is not the end of the previous animation, but the position before that.)\nBut even with playoutAnimations false the position can sometimes be wrong for the exact same reason.\n\nWhat TweenMax.to does is always animate from the previous state.\n\nTo give you an example:\nani 1 animates margin left to 750. previously it was 0 so it will animate to 750.\nani 2 animates back to 0.\nani 3 animates top to 750.\n\nSo obviously you expect the box to be at left 0, top 750 when finishing ani 3.\nBut if you scroll fast enough to skip ani 2 completly the position will in fact be left 750, top 750.\nSo try this code instead:\n\n``` javascript\n$(function ($) {\n    controller = $.superscrollorama();\n\n    controller.addTween(100, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 750,\n                marginTop: 0\n            }), 300);\n    controller.addTween(500, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 0\n            }), 300);\n    controller.addTween(900, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 750\n            }), 300);\n    controller.addTween(1300, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 0\n            }), 300);\n\n    controller.addTween(2000, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 750,\n                marginTop: 0\n            }), 300);\n    controller.addTween(2500, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 0\n            }), 300);\n    controller.addTween(2900, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 750\n            }), 300);\n    controller.addTween(3300, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 0\n            }), 300);\n});\n\n\n\nfunction log(msg) {\n    if (console != \"undefined\") console.log(msg);\n    else alert(msg);\n}\n```\n\nBest regards,\nJ\n. Hi Stefano,\n\nHmm.. it IS kind of weird! I was almost going to say it works as it's supposed to but sometimes I get it to move diagonally... I am guessing it might have something to do with the fact that superscrollorama doesn't really care about past animations. But to be honest I am not really kean on investing a lot of time bugfixing superscrollorama, when I have the follower (ScrollMagic) already lined up. I will definitely use your demo to see how ScollMagic behaves with it, so please leave it online.\nAs for fixing your issue I would recommend trying to leave nothing to coincidence.\nTry this bulky but quite surely working code:\n\n``` javascript\n$(function ($) {\n    controller = $.superscrollorama();\n\n    controller.addTween(100, TweenMax.fromTo($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 0\n            },\n            {\n                marginLeft: 750,\n                marginTop: 0\n            }), 300);\n    controller.addTween(500, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 750,\n                marginTop: 0\n            },\n            {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 0\n            }), 300);\n    controller.addTween(900, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 0\n            },\n            {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 750\n            }), 300);\n    controller.addTween(1300, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 750\n            },\n            {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 0\n            }), 300);\n    controller.addTween(2000, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 0,\n            },\n            {\n                marginLeft: 750,\n                marginTop: 0\n            }), 300);\n    controller.addTween(2500, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 750,\n                marginTop: 0,\n            },\n            {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 0\n            }), 300);\n    controller.addTween(2900, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 0\n            },\n            {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 750\n            }), 300);\n    controller.addTween(3300, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 750,\n            },\n            {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 0\n            }), 300);\n});\n\n\n\nfunction log(msg) {\n    if (console != \"undefined\") console.log(msg);\n    else alert(msg);\n}\n```\n. Hey Stefano!\n\nDid this sort things out for ya?\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi James,\nAs you pointed out this is caused as there may be a case there the start position of the pin is exactly the scroll position.\nYour suggested fix has two downsides though:\nFirst: It changes the curScrollPoint to a faulty -1 which might cause inaccurate TweenPositioning,\nand second: It neglects horizontal scrolling.\n\nMy suggestion would be to tackle it where the error really lies.\nAt line 186.\nThis is currently\n\n```\nvar inPinAra = (currScrollPoint > startPoint && currScrollPoint < endPoint);\n```\n\nBut I think it should be:\n\n```\nvar inPinAra = (currScrollPoint >= startPoint && currScrollPoint <= endPoint);\n```\n\nPlease try this out and see if this also resolves your isse.\nIf yes we can implement it like this.\n\nThanks again and best regards,\nJan\n. Hi James,\n\nI don't really understand the issue. If I click a link that takes me to the pin (so curScrollPoint == pinStart) to my mind the animation position should be 0 (as it is the beginning). Why would a user want to have a behaviour when the animation position is 1 at the beginning of the pin?\n\nPlease help me understand,\nbest regards,\nJ\n. Is there a way for you to create a demo page where I can easily reproduce the issue?\n. Hi James,\nSorry, it took me a while to get back to you.\nI can see the quirks but it's difficult for me to trace the origin as there is so much other stuff going on on the site.\nThat's why I was hoping you could have a site that showcases ONLY the problematic issues.\nMaybe even one for each quirk.\nThis way we can close in and try to fix them.\nI found that explicitly reproducing a faulty behaviour helps a lot in finding a solution.\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n. Hi James,\n\ncool, that will help a lot.\nAnd I can also use it to beta test ScrollMagic, which I have been working on a lot lately.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi James,\n\nYes, I saw. At the moment I don't know which way my head is facing so no rush.\nBut thank you very much for pitching in on the support. It helps a lot!\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n. Hi James,\n\nI'm back and got my head free again. :)\nSo are there any updates on this?\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi Guys,\n\nI'm closing all bug issues for Superscrollorama because it has been superceeded by ScrollMagic.\nhttps://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic\n\nPlease check if updating helps fix your problem.\nIf not, please post a new issue in the ScrollMagic issue section.\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n. Hi, welcome and thank you. :)\n\nSo here are my thoughts on performance:\nWhat costs most in superscrollorama is calling the checkScrollAnim.\nTo go easy on the client it is usually only called on tick of the TweenMax class.\nSo if you call triggerCheckAnim regularly somewhere (i.E. on resize) make sure it has the parameter false (or nothing, as false is default) passed to it.\nAll other performance issues are caused by other objects, such as TweenMax, displaying your animations.\nWhat might make your retina macbook suffer might be extra high res images that you animate or something. Just guesswork here :).\nMy 2008 Macbook Pro performce the site... well acceptable. =)\n\nAs to your question about the position quirks when reloading you have to be aware that no user will usually do that. It's only something you come accross during development.\nThat being said I think it can probably be resolved by setting pushFollowers to false and setting your spacers manually, as described multiple times, for example here https://github.com/johnpolacek/superscrollorama/issues/93\n\nI hope this helps, great site by the way!\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n. Hi Goco,\n\nActually this will not work using timeline.reverse(), as superscrollorama will control all animations for as long as they are added.\nBut please try to make more clear how the site should work.\nSo far what I think you want to achieve is this:\n\nScroll down and fire an animation, when reaching a certain scroll point.\nWhen clicking a button the animation should be reversed.\n\nWhat about when I scroll back up then? Should the animation run forward again? Or should it just not be running anymore?\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi!\n\nActually you were correct to go to the TweenMax Forums, as this really isn't a superscrollorama issue.\nBut as I personally have a thing against newbie haters I'll try to help you.\n\nFirstly I would strongly recommend setting pushFollowers to false, so you'll have the correct positions of all pinned elements right from the start.\nBare in mind that his might require you to set your own spacers.\nFor detailed descriptions see issue https://github.com/johnpolacek/superscrollorama/issues/93 .\n\nSecondly I would add an anchor element at the top position of each pin element. This should be the point where you want to scroll when clicking the \"next\" link.\nTry out this setup by using anchors `<a name=\"myanchor\"></a>` and then have Buttons like `<a href=\"#myanchor\">next</a>`.\nWhen you click the link the page should now jump to the correct position.\nNow you don't want it to jump, but scroll instead, right?\n\nSo here's how you do it:\n\n``` javascript\n$(document).ready(function() {\n    // page internal links\n    $('a[href^=\"#\"]').click(function (e) {\n        var anchor = $(this).attr(\"href\").substr(1);\n        var $target = $('a[name=\"' + anchor + '\"]').first();\n        if ($target.length > 0) {\n            e.preventDefault();\n            var scrollYPos = $target.offset().top;\n            TweenLite.to(window, .7, {scrollTo:{y:scrollYPos, x:0}, ease:Power2.easeOut});\n        }\n    });\n});\n```\n\nBear in mind, that the ScrollTo plugin is not loaded by default.\nYou will have to include the javascript file. You can do it right after you include the main TweenMax file.\n\nPlease try not only to copy and paste the code (I have not tested it and it may not work).\nTry to understand what I did and redo it line by line.\nThis way you'll learn.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi!\n\nWhat greensock version are you using? There seem to have been problems in older versions:\nhttp://forums.greensock.com/topic/7205-scrollto-bug-in-182-in-safari-602-mountain-lion/\n\nIf you're using a current version I'd like you to figure out wether it is a superscrollorama issue.\nPlease disable all superscrollorama scripts and try clicking the links.\nIf the bug still appears this is definitely a TweenMax Problem and we can't help you any further...\n\nregards,\nJ\n. By the way a \"thank you\" might have been nice...\n. Hi Joe,\n\nthat was actually what I was going to suggest.\nIt is not possible for the current version of superscrollorama to have multiple settings for triggerAtCenter.\nSo the best way to achieve this behaviour is to have triggers that position accordingly.\nThis WILL however be possible with [ScrollMagic](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic).\nBut I haven't gotten around to finish working on it.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. So I'm guessing you figured it out? :-)\n. Hi James,\n\nthank you for your demo.\nActually this has nothing to do with superscrollorama, as it works exactly as intended.\nWhen scrolling before your set trigger point it reverts to the unpinned state.\n(fyi your trigger point in your case is the top position of #slides, which equals to 0).\nSo what you can do is either add a negative offset of like 1000 (remember to add it to the duration) to make sure that  it will also be pinned at negative scroll values or (and this is by far the better solution) fix the state of your #slides container in the unpinned position.\n\nI am quite sure if you disable all pinning scripts you will se that your #slides container disappears. Why?\nActually it doesn't disappear, its height becomes 0. Why, you ask again and why does it collapse when I scroll upwards?\nWell it collapses because as I said earlier it sets the div into the state that it was \"pre-pin\" and there's your problem.\n\nNow I asked the right questions.\nDo you want a solution or figure it out yourself? :)\n\nGive it a shot or check here for the solution: http://pastebin.com/CkZmB0AY\n\nbest regards,\nJ\n. Hi James,\n\nyes you are precisely correct.\nI missed the part about jumping back to slide 8, but suspect a similar issue.\nTry making the duration longer and see if it sill happens.\nI'm at work right now and I don't have a touchpad here (the \"overscrolling\" only works with a touchpad).\nIf I find the time at home I'll have a look.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi James,\n\nactually I think it was the same problem but on the other side. The scroll was so long that the duration was over and so your container got unpinned.\nWhat you saw was the result of the misplaced items in the unpinned state.\nThat is why I suggested making the duration longer to ensure it was kept pinned.\n\nbest regards,\nJ\n. Hello and welcome.\n\nFirstly: Your demo page does not show any of the svg you described.\nPlease always make a dedicated demo page in case you are still working on the live website.\n\nSecondly: Your code is quite complicated (and not commented). Please try to simplify your problem and I will be able to help you a lot better. Also trying to simplify it will help you better understand the code and you might even solve the problem yourself.\n\nSo I suggest you set up a demo page only featuring one svg and one line drawing and there you try to have it react to the scroll position. And then take it from there.\nIf you run into problems with that demo let me know and I will take a look.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. No, I'm referring to http://www.goindoor.com as the demopage, since that was the one you sent.\nhttp://www.goingdoor.com doesn't really work (typo?).\n. I see.\nThis is precisely what I meant, when I asked you to set up a dedicated demo page for the purpose of debugging this issue. It is normal that a production page keeps changing, which makes it quite difficult for me or anybody else to help you.\n\nEven with the new page, where I can see some animation now, there is a lot of other stuff going on and zeroing in on the issue is quite impossible this way.\nPlease Create a page where nothing else is going on aside from what you are trying to achieve.\n\nIf you need a good example for a demo page, check out what James has done in this issue: https://github.com/johnpolacek/superscrollorama/issues/113\n\nregards,\nJ\n. All right, cool.\nI'll have a look as soon as I can.\nSadly I'm quite busy at the moment but I should get around to it some time this week...\nRegards,\nJ\n. Thanks, @jkrot for helping out. I agree with your analysis.\nDoes this help you, @sleepydada? Do you understand what jkrot means by first getting the animation right and then adding scroll logic?\nRegards,\nJ\n. Hi and welcome.\n\nThe reason might be you forgot ti include jQuery. Did you?\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi Stefan,\nI'll have a look as soon as I can.\nSadly I'm quite busy at the moment but I should get around to it some time this week...\nRegards,\nJ\n. Hey James,\n\nAlso check this Issue, where we originally discussed the issue: https://github.com/johnpolacek/superscrollorama/issues/104\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hiho!\n\nIf you want to have animations before scrolling you can either just add a Tween without attaching it to superscrollorama or force a scrollposition check on page load.\nYou can do that by calling controller.triggerCheckAnim() when the DOM is ready.\n\nbest regards,\nJ\n. Hi Slemming,\n\nthank you for your note.\nActually your analysis is not correct.\nThe Boolean parameter \"includeMargin\" for outerHeight or outerWidth is optional.\nIf it's ommitted false is assumed and it will return the height (or width) not including the margin, but NEVER the object.\nSee here for Documentation: http://api.jquery.com/outerHeight\n\nRegardless you might have a point that the margin should be included and thus the code should be changed to pass true.\n\nI fixed it with the new commit: https://github.com/johnpolacek/superscrollorama/commit/3ecd5aac00df9ca1af4e3df9a22a86f61fd00e34\nThank you for bringing this to my attention.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. That's never a bad idea. :)\nThanks for helping out, James!\n. Hello and sorry for the late reply.\nI was quite busy :-/.\n\nFirst you have to see the Timeline and Superscrollorama to be very seperate things.\nSuperscrollorama merely acts as a scrubber for the animations you create with TweenMax.\n\nThe reason your timeline doesn't work on newly added element is that no Tween has been defined for them. Maybe there is a way to add Animations for certain selectors and make them constant (as to react on dom changes) but I doubt it and you will have to ask in the TweenMax forums.\n\nBut as for your questions:\n\n1.) no there is not. In my opinion you'll have to build a new Tween each time you add new content.\n2.) just add the tween as you normally would and then create an animation using \"AddTween\" that is in general independent of the pin but starts at the same position. Another way would be to remove the pin and add it again with a fully rebuilt Timeline.\n3.) that is another possibility. I don't know what exactly your animations are but you might be able to add invisible containers for Guest 3 at the beginning and only add their content after the AJAX request and then switch it to visible.\n\nhope this helps,\nregards\nJ\n. Hi  mike, sorry for the late reply.\nI was quite busy in the last months.\n\nTo have your container pin at another position you can use the offset values. or you can make it react to the page center (using \"triggerAtCenter\").\n\nAs your demo isn't working anymore I hope this helps,\nJan\n. Hi and sorry for the late reply.\n\nEverything you really need is the file /js/jquery.superscrollorama.js\nThen make sure you also have TweenMax and jQuery loaded in your page and then you can get going.\nAll the other files in the REPO are just examples and the documentation page which you won't really need for your production environment.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Jason,\n\nI'm asuming you're referring to http://johnpolacek.github.io/superscrollorama/simpledemo2.html\n\nI am guessing what changes is the CSS conditions for the fly-it Element.\nCompare the css settings for #content-wrapper and #examples-1 to find out what changes.\nIf this doesn't help please provide demos of your page so we can help you debugging.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi redux,\n\ndid Jasons answer help you or is this issue still unresolved?\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi laubi,\nthank you for your input.\nThis is something I addressed and solved with [ScrollMagic](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic), the follow up for Superscrollorama :)\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Well it's under development.\nIf it's for basic projects give it a shot. But I haven't finished testing and bugs might occur (especially with pinning).\n\nregards,\nJ\n. thanks for sharing and I apologize for the lack of support.\nMy ressources are pretty limited at the moment.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi!\n\nsure just add more content and it will be shown, once the pin ends.\nAs long as the element is pinned obviously nothing can be seen that is beneath the bottom of the viewport. But as soon as the pin ends it will scroll there...\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Sgt. I will have a look into that.\n\nIs it possible for you to create a demo page for me that i can use for debugging this issue?\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Sgt,\n\nI'm closing all bug issues for Superscrollorama because it has been superceeded by ScrollMagic.\nhttps://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic\n\nPlease check if updating helps fix your problem.\nIf not, please post a new issue in the ScrollMagic issue section.\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n. Hi Leesher,\n\nthanks for your offer.\nThis is something that is implemented in ScrollMagic (the future version of Superscrollorama) and would be a too big change in the behaviour of Superscrollorama. That is why we will not implement it, as it can also be achived using your \"hacky\" solution with the very short duration.\n\nThanks anyway,\nregards,\nJan\n. This is something I'd like to include in ScrollMagic. So if you can supply a demo page where I can test this feature it would be grat.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Eric,\n\nI'm closing this issue for Superscrollorama because it has been superceeded by ScrollMagic.\nhttps://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic\n\nScrollMagic should be capable of handling responsive elements.\nPlease check if updating resolves your issue.\nIf not, please post a new issue in the ScrollMagic issue section.\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n. Hi Alan,\n\nthis looks really interesting.\nCan you supply a demo page so I will be able to avoid this issue for ScrollMagic (Superscrolloramas future Version).\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Well a simplified version, only reduced to the described penomenon would be far preferable.\nSo if you could do that it would be much appreciated.\nTake your time though and launch your project first :)\n. Hi Alan,\n\nthis is a very cool demo!\nI will definitely work this into SrollMagic using it.\nIf you have to take it offline, please zip and and email it to me.\n\nthank you and kind regards,\nJan\n. Hi Alan,\n\nthanks to your demo I fixed this issue for ScrollMagic.\nThe Reason for it is simple. When pinning an Element I need to convert its position to fixed. to do this I use the jQuery.css() method to get top and left position etc.\nThe curious thing though is that this always returns pixel values (even though you defined percentage values in your css).\n\nSo I found there are three ways to address this:\n1.) calculate the correct pixel values on resize (similar to what you did)\n2.) parse the Stylesheet for information about percentage positioning\n3.) Rely on inline styles (`<div style=\"left: 50%\">`) to achieve this effect.\n\nYou can read more on this issue and how to approach it [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/744319/get-css-rules-percentage-value-in-jquery) and [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5230425/getting-percent-css-position-with-jquery).\n\nI ultimately decided against the first two options for the following reasons:\n1.) this would make the need for an additional parameter to the pin method. i.e. \"leftPosRelative\". Then I'd need to find out in relation to which element the position would need to be calculated, which may vary, according to DOM. All in all I found this too cluttering and unrelyable.\n2.) since there are virtually unlimited ways of applying CSS rules in a stylesheet there is absolutely no relyable way to make sure you have the correct definitions, if you set out to do it for all users...\n3.) this is the way I ultimately went with. There are no calculations needed and best flexibility. So if a user wants to position the pinned element centered he has to use inline styling to set left to 50%. If nothing is set $.css() will be used like before.\n\nI think think this is the best solution and I already put to work using your example.\nCheck this out:\nhttp://www.janpaepke.de/tmp/ScrollMagic_relative_positioning/positionfix_SCROLLMAGIC.html\n\nSo... one down! :)\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Well a lot of the credit goes to John, as he started it.\nBut thanks! :)\nBe sure to send us a link once it's public.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. HA! I got an even better solution!\nI was scrolling further down the pages on stackoverflow I send you and there was this one guy that suggested to hide the parent, read the css value and then show the parent again.\nThis prevents jQuery vom calculating the pixels and returns the percentage instead.\n\nThis is awesome, now it works like a charm even with stylesheet definitions only!\n\nI updated the demo, check it out! :)\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi!\n\nthe solution are containers that have the size of 100% height. The div you want to animate should be inside them and positioned accordingly (for example 50% top).\nThen use the container as triggers for the animations of the divs.\n\nhope this helps,\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi @epcieye, were you able to sort out this issue?\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi wondergiant,\n\nthanks for sharing your solution! :)\nI will keep this in mind when continuing work on ScrollMagic.\n\nthanks & regards,\nJan\n. Hi Fortarrigo,\n\nin theory you should have multiple controllers.\nI am not sure if it is possible with the current version of Superscrollorama though.\nThe problem is that it always assumes $(window) as the container. You might be able to hack around this...\nTo have multiple Scrollcontainers on one page is something that will be supported by ScrollMagic though.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Roger,\n\ndid James' answer help you?\nIf not please supply a demo so we can better understand what you are trying to achieve.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi roger,\n\nI think I understand.\nAn anchor link tries to scroll to where the respective element would touch the top of the screen.\nThe thing is, as long as they are inside a pinned div this could never happen.\nSo if you want to scroll at a certain point within the pin (NOT when the respective element touches the top) this would be changing the behaviour of anchor links.\nSo here's how I'd approach it:\nYou're pinning the block for a duration of 964px.\nso you need to figure out to which point in this duration the anchor link should scroll to and give this information to the respective link. Like this:\n\n``` HTML\n<a href=\"#panel1\" data-scrolloffset=\"300\">Complete Calendar</a>\n```\n\nThis would mean it should scroll to 300 px after the pin has started.\nThen catch the click to these links like this [untested code]:\n\n``` javascript\n$(\"a[data-scrolloffset]\").on(\"click\", function(e) {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    var\n        pinStartPos = $(\"section.pin-block\").prev(\"div.superscrollorama-pin-spacer\").offset().top,\n        targetPos = pinStartPos + $(this).attr(\"data-scrolloffset\");\n    $(window).scrollTop(targetPos);\n});\n```\n\nHope this helps!\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Cool! Glad I could help!\n. Hi Lisa,\n\nthe 100 is the start position of the tween.\nThis can either be another Element or a scroll offset value.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Yes, but percent values need quotation marks. The correct Syntax is:\n\n```\nTweenMax.fromTo($('#example'), 1, {css:{top: \"70%\"}}, {css:{top: \"5%\"}});\n```\n\nNote that i left out the immediateRender part, because fromTo always sets immediateRender to true.\nBy the way: with the current version of tweenmax you can even omit the \"css\" part.\nSo this should also work:\n\n```\nTweenMax.fromTo($('#example'), 1, {top: \"70%\"}, {top: \"5%\"});\n```\n\nBut this is clearly a tweenMax, not a Superscrollorama issue :)\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Please don't put rumours about me in the world that I'm firing too early! :o)\n\nI'll have a look later...\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi Lisa,\n\nit is actually starting at scrolloffset of 0, so right at the beginning of the page.\nThe reason why is a bit tricky but i figured i'd show you how to find the solution instead of just telling you.\n\nlook at your pin in line 118.\n\nthe first parameter is the trigger element, the second is the pin duration and are the third the options for the animation etc.\n\nSo apparently your pin triggers to early. Why might that be?\n(btw. the same error exists with the other pins i've checked.)\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Well you're getting warmer...\nTry going to your site, opening the console in your browser and then put in this `$(\"#fighters\")` and hit enter.\nThen do the same thing with `$(\"#fighter\")`.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hey Lisa,\n\nthat's exactly the problem. There is no Element with the id \"fighers\". So maybe you forgot the wrappers in your DOM or something.\nAnyway that's why the animation happens too early. It just stats at the scroll position of 0.\nYour definition of the duration is correct.\nThe offset should be a pixel offset in relation to your trigger position.\nSo if you want the animation to start before the trigger is visible, use a positive offset, if you want to delay the animation use a negative offset.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. You're welcome...\n. Hi Benjamin,\n\nif it's only basic values you want to animate I suggest you tween an random object's value and then do the actual update in an \"onUpdate\" function.\n\nthis would work a bit like this [untested code]:\n\n```\nvar\n    myObject = {prop: $('#panel h1').position().top}, // start val of tween\n    tween = TweenMax.to(myObject, 1, {prop: 0}, onUpdate: function () {\n        if ( viewport().width < 720 ) {\n            $('#panel h1').css(\"top\", myObject.prop);\n        } else {\n            // bla\n        }\n    });\n\ncontroller.addTween('#panel', tween, 0, 50);\n```\n\nmake sure to have only minimum cpu needy functions in the onUpdate, for performance reasons.\n\nhope this helps, \nregards,\nJan\n. Allright :)\n\nlet us know if it works...\n. Hi and thank you for your input.\n\nThis will be addressed in [ScrollMagic](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic) (Superscrolloramas future Version).\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Benjamin,\n\nThe way to do this is have panel 3 inside panel 2. Then when panel 2 is pinned the animation is to animate panel 3 down (which had a negativ position before).\nSince there's probably more content in panel 2 though I would recommend a setup like this:\n\n``` HTML\n<div id=\"wrap\">\n    <div id=\"panel1\" class=\"pin\"></div>\n    <div id=\"panelwrap\" class=\"pin\">\n        <div id=\"panel2\"></div>\n        <div id=\"panel3\" class=\"animate\"></div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n(the classes are only to identify what to pin and what to animate)\nAlso make sure panel3 has position set to absolute so only panel 2 is affecting panelwrap's height.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Benjamin,\n\ndid you manage to sort it out?\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Lisa,\n\nthe reason for both issues is quite obvious.\nIt starts right at the beginning, because the starting position (left position) of your \"#fighters\" container is 0. So it is triggered as soon as the user starts scrolling and thus both the pin and the animations start.\nPosition you fighters wrapper correctly and it will work. :)\n\nAlso I noticed that you changed the superscrollorama base file setting the default for the scrolldirection (isVertical) to false.\nDon't do that. Instead when calling superscrollorama as you do in your animation.js on line 6 do it like this: `var controller = $.superscrollorama({isVertical: false});`.\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n. Hi!\n\nYou need to remove it from \"#main-menu\".\nBut I guess you figured it out, since you closed the issue already? :)\n\nregards,\nJ\n. no worries. :)\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi there,\n\nwithout any demo or console errors it's impossible to tell, but I don't think it's necesessary to do this like this.\nIf you are trying to run an animation only once, you can make use of the 'reverse' option like so:\n\n``` js\ncontroller.addTween(\n    '.fadeSade3',\n    TweenMax.from(\n        $('.fadeSade3'),\n        1.5,\n        {left:3000}\n    ),\n    0,\n    -(screen.height),\n    true\n);\n```\n\nAlso please mind, that Superscrollorama has been superseeded by [ScrollMagic](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic), which offers the same functionality with more features and better performance.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi Strazi,\n\nas soon as you add a tween to superscrollorama it takes control.\nMeaning it will always try to set it to the correct position (well what it regards as the correct position).\nAs a solution I would suggest you simply add a new Tween to the same object.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. no problem ;)\n\nIf you are starting a new project may I suggest trying [ScrollMagic](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic)?\nIt's basically release ready and only missing proper documentation and examples now.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi!\n\nThe first parameter for \"addTween is always the trigger.\ncatelayers is an array and thus doesn't work as a trigger.\nTry `controller.addTween(Toptree, staggerTween);` instead.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi!\nI don't think james meant for you to actually shrink the padding programmatically, like you did.\nJust set a fixed padding bottom and try to figure out the correct value so the flickering doesn't occur anymore.\nIn my experience the flickering is always for this reason: During Pin the element is fixed and doesn't account to the document's height or the position of the following elements.\nOnce unpinned it will though. So if there's a footer below it will be pushed further down, resulting in the page getting longer. This in turn makes your scroll position jump up a bit (because suddenly you are not at the end of the document anymore) and usually it jumps right back in to where the element is supposed to be pinned. Voil\u00e1, endless loop.\nThe solution is to make sure the Document has the correct length and it doesn't change.\nSet pushFollowers to false, define the size of the space before the footer (the duration of the pin) manually and make sure your pinned element or its container are positioned absolutely.\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi!\n\nPlease try to be more precise. There is now way for me to know what is supposed to be animated and so I see no problem.\nPlease refer to a specific item, write how it should behave and where in your code you are trying to initiate that behaviour.\n\nAs to mobile performance I'm afraid there's not much wiggle room.\nYou could try rewriting your site to work with [ScrollMagic](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic), which has been written with better regard to mobile support.\nThe documentation and examples are already finished.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi!\n\nActually it does work. When I inspect the element and check the bottom css parameter is animated.\nThe reason it doesn't move is that changing this parameter has no effect.\nAs a good rule of thumb:\n**Always try running your tweens before adding them to Superscrollorama and see if they work.**\nIf they don't the problem is in your Tween setup or markup, not in Superscrollorama.\n\nIn your case the problem is that changing a bottom position only has an effect if the element is positioned relatively or absolutely.\nI tried \"position: relative\" on \"#cartel\" and it works.\nIt flickers though, which has to do with the fact, that you use it both as a tween target and a trigger. So changing it's position results in display errors.\nWhen tweening the position of an element never use it as a trigger for that tween.\n\nHope this helps.\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi @elegos,\n\nI'm having a really hard time understanding what it is you are trying to achieve and so obviously I cant even start to think about what the problem might be.\nIs it possible for you to create a simplified version of your desired outcome with as little markup as possible.\nFor example instead of images and all that just have 3 divs with different background colours and try to achieve the same effect.\nI often realized that the process of creating a simplified demo helped me to figure out what the problem might be in my own code.\nAnd if you still can't find it yourself it's a lot easier for me to help you.\n\nSo can you do that? Maybe even just as a jsfiddle?\n\nregards,\nJan\n. Hi Guys,\n\nI'm closing all bug issues for Superscrollorama because it has been superceeded by ScrollMagic.\nhttps://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic\n\nPlease check if updating helps fix your problem.\nIf not, please post a new issue in the ScrollMagic issue section.\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n. Hi @mdfonda,\n\nAfter like a thousand refreshes I was able to see this error:\n\n```\nSCRIPT438: Object doesn't support property or method 'superscrollorama' \nproduction, line 156 character 4\n```\n\nIt points to where Superscrollorama is initialized.\nSo for some reason Superscrollorama is not available at the point where you try to init it.\n\nMy only good guess for a reason is that you load jQuery directly from their host.\nSo it MIGHT be that it is loaded after the superscrollorama plugin and thus \"overwrites\" it...\n\nTry putting jQuery on your own domain and loading it from there.\n\nIf the error perisists the only other thing I can think of is to check if superscrollorama is available before initializing it (something like this `if (!!$.superscrollorama){ /* do stuff */ }`).\nAnd if its not available try waiting (timeout) or even try reloading the js file.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi @mdfonda,\n\nas far as I can tell everything looks okay.\nSo is this issue sorted out now?\n\nregards,\nJ\n. you're welcome :)\n. Hi @mdfonda:\n\nWell the problem is that the superscrollorama file isnt properly loaded.\nIn your code on line 19 you try to load it from:\nhttp://eastcoworldwide.com/Proofs/chaplains/mobiletest/js/jquery.superscrollorama.js\n\nThat's a dead link. :)\n\nSo there's your problem.\n\nOn another note:\nIf you plan for future projects and especially if you wan to work with mobile compatibility, I STRONGLY suggest to have a look at [ScrollMagic](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic).\n\nScrollMagic is the successor to superscrollorama, built new from the ground up with a lot of new stuff.\nIt's currently close to release state (The only thing missing is a minified version and a project home page).\nSo have a look at the examples and the documentation and maybe you find it's far easier to use and more flexible.\n\nbest regards,\nJ\n. Well I would suggest you use modernizr and then do a check around your superscrollorama stuff.\nLike this:\n\n```\nif (!Modernizr.touch) {\n// do superscrollorama stuff\n}\n```\n\nthis way it will only be executed on non-touch devices.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. My favourite bugs are the one's that fix themselves. :)\n\nglad you could work it out.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi Andy,\n\nin theory superscrollorama should be able to keep your left positioning.\nBut as far as I remember this wasn't really stable for all possible dom configurations.\n\nThe easiest fix I suggest is this:\nMake a wrapper around your pinned element and pin the wrapper instead.\nThen position your visible element inside the wrapper.\nThis way it doesn't matter if the pinned element has the left position 0.\n\nhope this helps.\n\nbest regards,\nJ\n. any updates? :)\n. Hi Matt,\n\nthis bug is new, as far as I know.\nIf it is a new project or a small one, try refractoring to [ScrollMagic](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic).\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Please check out ScrollMagic, which explicitly supports mobile devices.\n\nhttp://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic\n. please check out ScrollMagic, as many issues have been addressed there.\nhttp://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic\n. Hi Larry,\n\nthank you for your commit.\nEven though development for SuperScrollorama has been suspended because it was replaced by [ScrollMagic](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic) (which already offers a destroy method) I would merge this pull request if you were so kind as to also include the new method into the documentation.\n\nthank you and kind regards,\nJ\n. Hi George,\n\nI'm sorry but there's not much I can tell  you. from the looks of it you are doing the SuperScrollorama stuff as you're supposed to.\n\nMy guess is there are other scripts interfering or your dom setup causes for this bug to appear.\nIt is for example not a good Idea to calculate and hard set the size of the viewport on load, like you do (what happens if the user resizes the browser?, think about responsiveness and use percentage values...)\nAlso you should consider wrapping multiple Tweens into one Timeline instead of attaching them successively to the controller.\nBut these are only sidenotes.\n\nAs to your actual problem I can only recommend to try to figure out which of your scripts breaks the site.\nIf you are convinced it is a SuperScrollorama issue I will have to ask you to port to [ScrollMagic](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic) and see if the error persists.\nIf it does file another issue in ScrollMagic's issue section.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. Hi George,\nFirst, as I suggested, try to wrap multiple tweens into a timeline and then adding them to Superscrollorama.\nIf this shows no effect I'm gonna have to ask you again to switch to ScrollMagic, as there will be no bugfixing or other development on Superscrollorama.\nIf your problem persists with ScrollMagic we will try to fix it.\n\nregards,\nJ\n. It's very hard to guess what you are actually trying to do.\nPlease have a look at ScrollMagic, which replaced Superscrollorama.\nIt offers a lot of documentation and examples, which quite probably will answer all your questions.\n\nhttp://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic\n. Please take a look at the TweenMax method \"staggerTo\" and please also take a look at [ScrollMagic](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic), which has replaced Superscrollorama for a while now...\n. As it is also based on GSAP is similar, yes.\n. Support for Superscrollorama has been suspended.\nBut working with ScrollMagic shouldn't be a big deal if you come from Superscrollorama.\nSo feel free to ask about any problems you might have in the [ScrollMagic issues section](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic/issues).\n. Hi Ben!\n\nGlad you like the plugin.\nSuperscrollorama has ben superseded by [ScrollMagic](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic).\nThe logic is quite similar and I'm sure you'll have an easy time refactoring your code to ScrollMagic.\n\nOnce you did, you can make use of ScrollMagic's \"enabled\" method to temporarily disable the animations from happening: http://janpaepke.github.io/ScrollMagic/docs/ScrollMagic.Scene.html#enabled\n\nShould you have any problems moving to ScrollMagic or implementing this, please follow [ScrollMagic's troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#troubleshooting) and/or [post an issue](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic/issues).\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n. It looks like ScrollMagic code.\nPlease repost it in ScrollMagic support and try to give more context. A jsfiddle if possible.\n. Note, that support for Superscrollorama has been suspended, as it has been superseded by [ScrollMagic](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic).\nBut what you're probably looking fore is a simple `window.scrollTo(x, y)` with `x` being 0 and `y` being your target \"seek\" position.\n.

Hey, re.\n\nI changed the code to something less buggy, but im still not 100% satisfated.\nHere is what i have now:\n\n```\n    controller.pin($('#processus'), $('#etape_controllers').height(), {\n                anim:(new TimelineLite())\n    .append(\n      TweenMax.to($('#processus_background'), .5, \n                            {css:{backgroundPosition: '0px -12px'}, immediateRender:false})\n    ).append(\n      TweenMax.to($('#processus article ul'), .5,\n                            {css:{top: '0px'}, immediateRender:false})\n    )\n    .append(\n      TweenMax.to($('#processus_background'), .5, \n                            {css:{backgroundPosition: '210px -222px'}, immediateRender:false})          \n    ).append(\n            TweenMax.to($('#processus article ul'), .5, \n                            {css:{top: '-550px'}, immediateRender:false})               \n    )\n    .append(\n      TweenMax.to($('#processus_background'), .5, \n                            {css:{backgroundPosition: '420px -432px'}, immediateRender:false})          \n    ).append(\n            TweenMax.to($('#processus article ul'), .5, \n                            {css:{top: '-1100px'}, immediateRender:false})              \n    )\n    .append(\n      TweenMax.to($('#processus_background'), .5, \n                            {css:{backgroundPosition: '630px -642px'}, immediateRender:false})          \n    ).append(\n            TweenMax.to($('#processus article ul'), .5, \n                            {css:{top: '-1650px'}, immediateRender:false})              \n    )\n  .append(\n      TweenMax.to($('#processus_background'), .5, \n                            {css:{backgroundPosition: '840px -852px'}, immediateRender:false})              \n    ).append(\n    TweenMax.to($('#processus article ul'), .5,\n                            {css:{top: '-2200px'}, immediateRender:false})              \n    )\n  .append(\n      TweenMax.to($('#processus_background'), .5, \n                            {css:{backgroundPosition: '1050px -1062px'}, immediateRender:false})    \n    ).append(\n            TweenMax.to($('#processus article ul'), .5, \n                            {css:{top: '-2750px'}, immediateRender:false})          \n    ),\n      spacer:'50px', \n                onPin: function() {\n\n\n                    $('#processus').css({height:'100%',top:'0px'});\n       $('html').getNiceScroll().onResize();\n                }, \n                onUnpin: function() {\n       $('html').getNiceScroll().onResize();\n\n                }\n            });\n```\n\nAs you can see, i now use the 'anim' vars and timeline and append.\nIt results as an immediate render, and i don't want that. I'd prefer that the tweens automaticaly scroll to their position. I dont want the user have to scroll the good position so that they can read the text. Id' prefer to have a normal tween, but when i use normal, it seems to be so many bugs when fast scrolling ...\n\nDamn.\n. Just simply, is it possible to have the same effect as i have now, but with immediaterender = false ?\n\nThx\n. Hi!\n\nThanks for your reply :) I appreciate!\n\nI already tried the onComplete function, but unfortunaly, this function does only load when im scrolling down. If i scroll up, the oncomplete function will not be executed.\n\nDont know why.\n\nAnyway, the bug is not a major one now. Even if i have an immediate render, this is not buggy as it was before :)\n\nThank you so much for superscrollorama. I really enjoy using powerful script to enhance my web-creativity!\n\nI wish you a really nice day\n.

I'd prefer that the tweens automaticaly scroll to their position. I dont want the user have to scroll the good position so that they can read the text. Id' prefer to have a normal tween, but when i use normal, it seems to be so many bugs when fast scrolling ...\n\nDamn.\n. Just simply, is it possible to have the same effect as i have now, but with immediaterender = false ?\n\nThx\n. Hi!\n\nThanks for your reply :) I appreciate!\n\nI already tried the onComplete function, but unfortunaly, this function does only load when im scrolling down. If i scroll up, the oncomplete function will not be executed.\n\nDont know why.\n\nAnyway, the bug is not a major one now. Even if i have an immediate render, this is not buggy as it was before :)\n\nThank you so much for superscrollorama. I really enjoy using powerful script to enhance my web-creativity!\n\nI wish you a really nice day\n. ",

Hey Jan I was able to replicate this issue as well on one of the pages I am working on.  Kinda strange,  it seems to be just with the last element.  Every time I try to scroll past the final section is bounces me back up a ways.\n\nhttp://optimine.com/about\n\nI have 3 pretty simple pins going on for this page.  I all the elements that are being tweened are not the triggering elements.  The first two work fine but the third breaks.  If i comment out the last one the first two still works fine, IE it isn't always the last one in the sequence.  \n\nI did that here \n\nhttp://optimine.com/news\n\nno animation on the 3rd section seems to prevent the issue.  I am just at a loss on what to do.\n\n```\ncontroller.pin($('#about_us'), 200, {\n    anim: new TimelineLite({align: \"sequence\"}).append([TweenMax.fromTo( $('#about_us .callout'), 2, {css:{opacity: 1}}, {css:{opacity: 0}})]),\n    offset: 0,\n    pushFollowers: false\n}); \n\ncontroller.pin($('#board_of_directors'), 200, {\n    anim: new TimelineLite({align: \"sequence\"}).append([TweenMax.fromTo( $('#board_of_directors .callout'), 2, {css:{opacity: 1}}, {css:{opacity: 0}})]),\n    offset: 0,\n    pushFollowers: false\n});\n\ncontroller.pin($('#executive_team'), 200, {\n    anim: new TimelineLite({align: \"sequence\"}).append([TweenMax.fromTo( $('#executive_team .callout'), 2, {css:{opacity: 1}}, {css:{opacity: 0}})]),\n    offset: 0,\n    pushFollowers: false\n});\n```\n. Hey Jan sorry it was not the triggerAtCenter property,  height of the element after seems to be a factor, if the space is large enough the issue does not occur,  I had changed two things at once and incorrectly assumed the wrong thing.\n. The only thing I can confirm is that it has something to do with the pin and the view port, the pin is not bigger then then the view port but if there isn't enough pixels of padding after the pin = to the viewport it does this bouncing.  I have torn this apart and I haven't been able to figure it out.  I have ruled out some jquery height and outerHeight issues \n. I had to alter my examples because I was not able to figure this out,  my solution was really just not have a pin so near the bottom of the page.  \n. optimine.nextmp.net  \n\nIf you click on some of the bottom platform nav items you see the scrolling happen through the animations and it offsets the link.\n\nThe two main issues,  \n1.  I am doing so much pinning on the page that the anchors for the hrefs that link to divs on the page are all in the wrong position.  \n2.  I tried turning off the pinning to fix this issue when I want to click on things and that did not work.  \n\nI basically want to duplicate the functionality in the source code for jumpedPast on load,  but there doesn't seem to be an exposed way to do that.\n. Yea I was actually looking at source code of it and debated on using it.  The pinning and the spacers are actually fine.  I was hard setting the animations to be completed and jumping past them fine but they would never reverse or complete again.  Really the only reason why I didn't just move it to ScrollMagic is the lack of documentation on it right now.  I don't mind beta projects.  \n\nThe biggest issue right now is that I am pinning a 400 pixel tall item but I want it to animate over lets say 600 pixels in the TimelineLite so I would have 10 elements that animate over 60 pixels each.  That difference between the two is what is causing me the most issues because my own manual spacers didn't seem to compensate for that.  I kinda need a way to trigger all the TimelineLite animations in the pins to not animate.\n\nI tried unpinning all the animations but that didn't seem to have the desired effect.\n. Sure [removed] is my skype email I am logged in now.\n. Have you tried the same thing I did to resolve the issue by turning off pushFollowers and using divs with padding to do the spacing manually?\n. Sorry Jan for being so obscure,  I have tried having separate containers for triggering actions for the pins.  I also tried removing the resizing actions to see if that would resolve the issue, it did not.  Whatever was happening is not because of either of these separate thoughts, though I don't think I tried removing them both at the same time.  I will try to make a demo page as an example this week if I have time.  Basically what I think is happening is that some of the on reverse logic while in the middle of a pin is being wonky.\n\nFrom what I was able to diagnose by adding some log code is that the when initiating the reverse in the middle of a pin for some reason the state seems to stay pinned.  I will try to narrow down the cause more.\n\nJames\n. Hey Jan I was able to duplicate this issue in a much more simple form.\n\nhttp://optimine.com/news  \n\nAll of these pins the triggers and the effected objects are different, there are only two pins,  and I am able to get this to replicate almost always,  I am able to get a grey background at the top to offset because a pin gets stuck.\n\nI have narrowed it down even more, it appears some how the original positioning gets corrupted.  The pin position for the object normally is \n\norigPositioning: Object\nleft: \"auto\"\npos: \"relative\"\ntop: \"auto\"\n\nand some how it gets set to \n\norigPositioning: Object\nleft: \"\"\npos: undefined\ntop: \"\"\n. Alright this is even more of a fun issue,  so I have really narrowed this down.  This only happens when the starting point of the pin is a scroll position 0,  IE when the pin starts at the top of the page.  This is because of a logic issue on line 187  (currScrollPoint < startPoint && pinObj.state === 'AFTER')  on line 187  \n\nIf the start point is 0 then this logic can't be true.  That way it won't stall on the logic sometimes?  This happens because of scrolling has it been set to a strange state.\n\nI have tested this and this has resolved my issue but I just don't want to break anything else and you are more familiar with the code then I am.  \n\nI submitted a change request on the old superscroll to have that included.\n. I have had this issue happen a number of times with me as well,  I took a 3 step approach to this,  wrap all animations in a timeline, it is really easy to wrap a timeline inside of a timeline to make sure everything happens in a sequence, manually clean up bad animation with simple jquery function, ensure everything happens in the tweens by not having triggering elements also have animation happen to them.  \n\nI used timelineLite to wrap all tweens to make sure they finish and are handled.  This seemed to help with my issues,  even if I only have one animation for the tween I still put it in there.  This also gives me onStart, onUpdate and onComplete ability to trigger functions to clean up some mess on animation.  When I scrolled fast for example I would have multiple animations stuck in an active state.  Most of my animations are progressively triggering display:block on display:none elements so I made a quick script to hide the siblings of the element.  See code below,  on every update the function runs to make sure no stuck frames in the animation.  You could run this on just onComplete if you wanted, onUpdateScope lets me pass the jquery object I want to make sure $(this) is referencing so the function is really simple.  \n\n```\nvar timeLine1 = new TimelineLite({align: \"sequence\"})\n    .append([TweenMax.to($('#display-platform-list .frame-1'), 2, {css:{display:'block'},onUpdate:removeSiblings,onUpdateScope:$('#display-platform-list .frame-1')})])\n    .append([TweenMax.to($('#display-platform-list .frame-2'), 2, {css:{display:'block'},onUpdate:removeSiblings,onUpdateScope:$('#display-platform-list .frame-2')})])\n    .append([TweenMax.to($('#display-platform-list .frame-3'), 2, {css:{display:'block'},onUpdate:removeSiblings,onUpdateScope:$('#display-platform-list .frame-3')})])\n    .append([TweenMax.to($('#display-platform-list .frame-4'), 2, {css:{display:'block'},onUpdate:removeSiblings,onUpdateScope:$('#display-platform-list .frame-4')})])\n    .append([TweenMax.to($('#display-platform-list .frame-5'), 2, {css:{display:'block'},onUpdate:removeSiblings,onUpdateScope:$('#display-platform-list .frame-5')})])\n    .append([TweenMax.fromTo( $('#platform .callout'), 1, {css:{opacity: 1}}, {css:{opacity: 0}})]);\n\nfunction removeSiblings(){\n    $(this).siblings().hide();\n}\n```\n\nI am not sure how much this specific example applies to your situation but hope it gives you some ideas.  I would also advise you not to mess with top and left when doing animations because this will confuse placements, try to use margins where possible.\n. I agree with jan here the issue seems to be TweenMax not superscrollorama.  I was able to get this reset fine by using staggerFromTo and putting all the tweens in an array.  I did notice your issue I just think your issue is more in how you are implementing your tweens stefan.  My best suggestion at this point is to make sure you are on version 12 of the greensock code and review the documentation again http://api.greensock.com/js/ \n. This also fixes the issue but I am concerned we may have changed default functionality.  \n\nWhen I do this fix and and I click a link that takes me to a div that has a pin on it.  Instead of being at the end of the animation it is at the beginning of the animation.  \n\nI had noticed this as well and my client wanted to have the animation already played out on the pin.  Basically when the scroll height = the pin height it will be at the beginning instead of at the end.  Maybe we need a 3rd case or an option to see what people want that to be?\n\nI guess this happens with me more because I am moving around the page using scrollTop and I end up at the exact height of pins a lot.\n. I agree with you Jan that I should limit myself to the specific issue,  I may code a way to determine what you want the animation position to be 0 or 1 when you pin position start and scroll position are the same.  This really only can happen if you navigated to the element from a click or if you are starting the pin at the top of a page.  This would be helpful for people who want to maintain a navigation structure that works with the scrolling instead of having just one page.  \n\nI updated my pull request and I will initiate another when I am happy with the code I am adjusting as a feature.\n\nJames\n. Part of the problem is this behavior has been inconsistent,  not whether were it is in the animation cycle,  when I would click on a link with a pin and the link would take me to the same pin it would behave differently if you would scroll down to the link vs scrolling up to the link.  Irrelevant of the issue on what the behavior is there should be a consistent behavior for the clicking a link to a pin.   Resolving that part of the issue I am considering a separate problem because I don't see a good way of solving it right now.  \n. You can reproduce on optimine.com \n\nUse the top nav under platform to reproduce.\n\nQuirk 1.\n\nClick on the link under platform for display,  you will notice you start at the beginning of the animation.  Scroll past it and click on the link again and you will notice you are at the end of the animation.\n\nQuirk 2. \n\nClick on the about page in the top nav, then use the platform -> display link again to go back to the home page and you will see that you are at the end of the animation when switching from another page.  \n. I will make a example html page and put it in my repository this week.\n. Hey Jan I am not done with my example I spent some of my time on helping other people out this morning hoping to be done by tomorrow.\n. I have been in super crunch time the last couple of months with a job\nchange.  The best I have been able to do is pitch in with some of the\nsupport but I haven't had a ton of time to dedicate to this.\n\nOn Mon, Feb 3, 2014 at 10:29 AM, Jan Paepke notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> Hi James,\n> \n> I'm back and got my head free again. :)\n> So are there any updates on this?\n> \n> regards,\n> J\n> \n> ## \n> \n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/johnpolacek/superscrollorama/pull/105#issuecomment-33971621\n> .\n. I have found that IE 9 and 10 even on a great system just handle most scroll animations in a very clunky manner, there are efforts to overcome that but IE javascript engine is just subpar.  \n. I think it is possible,  you are going to have to adjust your animations mid animation so fire an onComplete for the animation once it is done so and force it to do something else.  It is going to be really tricky but I think it is doable.  \n.

I really had a hard time reading your code I have re factored it.\n\n@janpaepke  as you can clearly see if you comment out adding the tweens and the animation the image is already there.  I am not a svg pro but I would either have the animation change the style of the color of the lines from like white to orange to get the desired effect or some other styling method.  This is clearly a animation issue to me and not a scrolling issue.  \n\n@sleepydada as @janpaepke has told me on some of my own projects get your animation to work correctly first then add it to your scrolling logic. It is sound advice.\n\n```\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=\"en-US\">\n<head>\n\n\n<title> Demo |  Goindoor</title>\n<script type='text/javascript' src='http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js?ver=3.7.1'></script>\n<script type='text/javascript' src='http://www.chartjs.org/docs/Chart.js?ver=3.7.1'></script>\n<script type='text/javascript' src='http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/latest/TweenMax.min.js?ver=3.7.1'></script>\n<script type='text/javascript' src='http://www.goindoor.com/wp-content/themes/salient/js/jquery.superscrollorama.js?ver=3.7.1'></script>\n<script type='text/javascript' src='http://www.goindoor.com/wp-content/themes/salient/js/goindoor.js?ver=3.7.1'></script>\n\n</head>\n\n\n<body>\n<div id=\"padding\" style=\"padding-top: 300px;\"></div>\n<div id=\"hospital_drawing\">\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" version=\"1.1\"  height=\"500\" width=\"960\">\n      <path id=\"lineAB\" d=\"M 706 10 l 89 57\"  stroke-width=\"3\" fill=\"none\" />\n      <path id=\"lineBC\" d=\" M 795 67 l 0 126\"  stroke-width=\"3\" fill=\"none\" />\n      <path id=\"lineCD\" d=\"M 795 192 l 114 73\"  stroke-width=\"3\" fill=\"none\" />\n      <path id=\"lineDE\" d=\"M 909 265 l -625 0\"  stroke-width=\"3\" fill=\"none\" />\n      <path id=\"lineEF\" d=\" M 284 265 l 0 70\" stroke-width=\"3\" fill=\"none\" />\n      <path id=\"lineFG\" d=\"M 284 335 l 92 53\"  stroke-width=\"3\" fill=\"none\" />\n    </svg>\n</div>\n\n\n<script>\n\njQuery(document).ready(function(e) {\n\n    var controller = jQuery.superscrollorama({});\n    var timeLine1 = new TimelineLite({})\n\n    var orig1 = document.querySelector('#lineAB');\n    var obj1 = {length:0,pathLength:orig1.getTotalLength()};\n    orig1.style.stroke = '#f60';\n\n    var orig2 = document.querySelector('#lineBC');\n    var obj2 = {length:0,pathLength:orig2.getTotalLength()};\n    orig2.style.stroke = '#f60';\n\n    var orig3 = document.querySelector('#lineCD');\n    var obj3 = {length:0,pathLength:orig3.getTotalLength()};\n    orig3.style.stroke = '#f60';\n\n    var orig4 = document.querySelector('#lineDE');\n    var obj4 = {length:0,pathLength:orig4.getTotalLength()};\n    orig4.style.stroke = '#f60';\n\n    var orig5 = document.querySelector('#lineEF');\n    var obj5 = {length:0,pathLength:orig5.getTotalLength()};\n    orig5.style.stroke = '#f60';\n\n    var orig6 = document.querySelector('#lineFG');\n    var obj6 = {length:0,pathLength:orig6.getTotalLength()};\n    orig6.style.stroke = '#f60';\n\n    function drawLine1() {orig1.style.strokeDasharray = [obj1.length,obj1.pathLength].join(' ');}\n    function drawLine2() {orig2.style.strokeDasharray = [obj2.length,obj2.pathLength].join(' ');}\n    function drawLine3() {orig3.style.strokeDasharray = [obj3.length,obj3.pathLength].join(' ');}\n    function drawLine4() {orig4.style.strokeDasharray = [obj4.length,obj4.pathLength].join(' ');}\n    function drawLine5() {orig5.style.strokeDasharray = [obj5.length,obj5.pathLength].join(' ');}\n    function drawLine6() {orig6.style.strokeDasharray = [obj6.length,obj6.pathLength].join(' ');}\n\n     // You can comment out this code for the tweens and timeline to prevent the animation\n\n//  var tween1 = TweenMax.to(obj1, .5, {length:obj1.pathLength, onUpdate:drawLine1, delay:4,ease:Linear.easeNone,immediateRender: false});\n//  var tween2 = TweenMax.to(obj2, .5, {length:obj2.pathLength, onUpdate:drawLine2, delay:6,ease:Linear.easeNone,immediateRender: false});\n//  var tween3 = TweenMax.to(obj3, .5, {length:obj3.pathLength, onUpdate:drawLine3, delay:8,ease:Linear.easeNonem,immediateRender: false});\n//  var tween4 = TweenMax.to(obj4, .5, {length:obj4.pathLength, onUpdate:drawLine4, delay:10,ease:Linear.easeNone,immediateRender: false});\n//  var tween5 = TweenMax.to(obj5, .5, {length:obj5.pathLength, onUpdate:drawLine5, delay:12,ease:Linear.easeNone,immediateRender: false});\n//  var tween6 = TweenMax.to(obj6, .5, {length:obj6.pathLength, onUpdate:drawLine6, delay:14,ease:Linear.easeNone,immediateRender: false});\n\n//  tl.timeLine1([tween1, tween2, tween3, tween4, tween5, tween6], \"+=2\", \"sequence\", 0.5);\n\n});\n</script>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n. I still think this is a fundamental problem in the way you are doing your tweens and adding them to the controller.  From what I can tell you are just overwriting your own tweens.   \n\nReview the following property of timelinemax\n\nhttp://www.greensock.com/overwritemanager/\n\noverwrite : int Controls how (and if) other tweens of the same target are overwritten by this tween. There are several modes to choose from, and TweenMax automatically calls OverwriteManager.init() if you haven\u2019t already manually dones so, which means that by default AUTO mode is used (please see http://www.greensock.com/overwritemanager/ for details and a full explanation of the various modes):\nNONE (0) (or false)\nALL_IMMEDIATE (1) (or true)\nAUTO (2) \u2013 this is the default mode for TweenMax.\nCONCURRENT (3)\nALL_ONSTART (4)\nPREEXISTING (5)\nExample: TweenMax.to(mc, 1, {x:100, overwrite:5});\n\nBy default you are on auto you are having some overwriting issues,  you really have two ways around this.  Wrap everything in a timelinelite and force it to go through a sequence or be better about managing your tweens overwriting.  \n. If you wanna post your modified code so I can take a look I will make adjustments to it later today.  Basically you are just trying to force each animation to play out and not jump and you can do that in the timeline.\n. If you really want to ensure that the animation happens the way you want, I would make a function to trigger an add to the timeline lite oncomplete from the previous tween.  You pass in a parameter for the next tween and if you follow a naming schema you can do it dynamically.  \n\nI think you are running into the fundamental issue of how superscrollorama interacts with the greensock animation is that it updates the progress of the timeline or tween based on the scroll amount vs number of pixels you have for the scroll.  \n\nAs in the previous issue I gave you an example where onUpdate i was running a js function to clean up the animation,  it is going to happen where the progress gets messed up.  I really only see the two ways of getting around this if you can't get your animation to work right within a timeline.  \n\nHowever I still feel that you can accomplish this in a normal timeline if you set the overwrite property to none.  If that still doesn't work then you will have to manually clean up your tweens.\n1.  Dynamically add the next tween on on complete and update,  which this is going to be rather cumbersome.\n2.  Have a function that keeps track of where you are in progress of the animation.  If you have 10 tweens and jumped to tween 3,  make sure you onStart check where you are in your progress and force the animation to do what you want. \n. It was a specific bug in that version of Jquery fyi the problem doesn't exist in 1.9 or 2.0  I had actually debated on fixing  this as well but it wasn't related to my current issue.  \n. 1st.  This is pretty easy to do,  you have several pinned animations based on certain divs,  you animate through your 3-4 frames you want for that pin then let normal scrolling happen down to the next pin.\n\n2nt.  I guess you could do some magic with the Control.MouseWheel but remember there are a bunch of people that does use mouse wheels to scroll they use the slider on the window frame or a mouse pad for example, there really isn't a good way of doing what you want here.  \n. There is a bug tgat when the pinned element is bigger then half the view\nport left it bounces it back up, only way to confirm u are having this\nissue is to put like 1000 px of padding on a spacer if the issue goes away\nthat is the issue, no way to resolve at this point.\nOn Nov 24, 2013 8:21 AM, \"mjpugh\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Hi,\n> I have a landing page containing several sections of content.

So here is the code that you are using.  First question would be why are you doing a check animation in the middle of adding all your controllers.\n\nThe specific animation your are complaining about #titulo-centros from what I can tell the vertical size of the animation is small enough that it is being triggered on multiple scroll ticks,  you can try making the animation a fromTo or you may have to pin the animation to take up a bigger number of pixels on the scrolling so it doesn't trigger multiple times on a scroll.\n\n```\n     $(document).ready(function() {\n        var controller = $.superscrollorama();\n        triggerAtCenter: false,\n        controller.addTween('#substage1', TweenMax.from( $('#substage1'), .95, {delay: .25, css:{opacity:0, rotation: 720}, ease:Quad.easeOut}));\n        controller.addTween('#substage2', TweenMax.from( $('#substage2'), .35, {delay: 1.3, css:{opacity:0}, ease:Quad.easeOut}));\n        controller.addTween('#substage3', TweenMax.from( $('#substage3'), .35, {delay: 1.8, css:{opacity:0}, ease:Quad.easeOut}));\n        controller.triggerCheckAnim();\n        controller.addTween('#fly-it', TweenMax.from( $('#fly-it'), .45, {css:{right:'1000px'}, ease:Quad.easeInOut}));\n        controller.addTween('.sectionText', TweenMax.from( $('.sectionText'), .35, {delay: .75, css:{opacity:0}, ease:Quad.easeOut}));\n        controller.addTween('#titulo', TweenMax.fromTo( $('#titulo'), .25, {css:{opacity:0,}, immediateRender:true, ease:Quad.easeInOut}, {css:{opacity:1, 'letter-spacing':'-10px'}, ease:Quad.easeInOut}), 0, 100); // 100 px offset for better timing \n        controller.addTween('#slider', TweenMax.fromTo( $('#slider'), .25, {css:{opacity:0, fontSize:'20px'}, immediateRender:true, ease:Quad.easeInOut}, {css:{opacity:1, fontSize:'240px'}, ease:Quad.easeInOut}));\n        controller.addTween('#cartel', TweenMax.from( $('#cartel'), .45, {css:{bottom:'400px'}, ease:Quad.easeInOut}));\n        controller.addTween('#titulo-centros', TweenMax.from( $('#titulo-centros'), .25, {delay: 10.5, css:{opacity:0}, ease:Quad.easeOut}));\n        controller.addTween('#senal1', TweenMax.from( $('#senal1'), .35, {delay: .25, css:{opacity:0}, ease:Quad.easeOut}));\n        controller.addTween('.piz', TweenMax.from( $('.piz'), .35, {delay: .45, css:{opacity:0}, ease:Quad.easeOut}));\n\n\n});\n```\n. I had a lot of issues scrolling through animations when pinning them.  You can see the relevant conservation with https://github.com/johnpolacek/superscrollorama/issues/99\n\nYou can see me using the pinning of the animation on http://optimine.com/ \n\nI believe I have noticed a similar issue as you.\n\nhttps://github.com/johnpolacek/superscrollorama/pull/105\n\nMoving around the page doesn't always end the animation in the same state so it is hard to correct for it.  \n. I used the\nhttp://patik.com/blog/within-viewport-javascript-and-jquery-plugin/ to add\nthat functionality and tied into it for my project.\n\nOn Wed, Jan 22, 2014 at 11:08 AM, leesherwood notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> Closed #135 https://github.com/johnpolacek/superscrollorama/issues/135.\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/johnpolacek/superscrollorama/issues/135\n> .\n.

Hey Jan I was able to replicate this issue as well on one of the pages I am working on.  Kinda strange,  it seems to be just with the last element.  Every time I try to scroll past the final section is bounces me back up a ways.\n\nhttp://optimine.com/about\n\nI have 3 pretty simple pins going on for this page.  I all the elements that are being tweened are not the triggering elements.  The first two work fine but the third breaks.  If i comment out the last one the first two still works fine, IE it isn't always the last one in the sequence.  \n\nI did that here \n\nhttp://optimine.com/news\n\nno animation on the 3rd section seems to prevent the issue.  I am just at a loss on what to do.\n\n```\ncontroller.pin($('#about_us'), 200, {\n    anim: new TimelineLite({align: \"sequence\"}).append([TweenMax.fromTo( $('#about_us .callout'), 2, {css:{opacity: 1}}, {css:{opacity: 0}})]),\n    offset: 0,\n    pushFollowers: false\n}); \n\ncontroller.pin($('#board_of_directors'), 200, {\n    anim: new TimelineLite({align: \"sequence\"}).append([TweenMax.fromTo( $('#board_of_directors .callout'), 2, {css:{opacity: 1}}, {css:{opacity: 0}})]),\n    offset: 0,\n    pushFollowers: false\n});\n\ncontroller.pin($('#executive_team'), 200, {\n    anim: new TimelineLite({align: \"sequence\"}).append([TweenMax.fromTo( $('#executive_team .callout'), 2, {css:{opacity: 1}}, {css:{opacity: 0}})]),\n    offset: 0,\n    pushFollowers: false\n});\n```\n. Hey Jan sorry it was not the triggerAtCenter property,  height of the element after seems to be a factor, if the space is large enough the issue does not occur,  I had changed two things at once and incorrectly assumed the wrong thing.\n. The only thing I can confirm is that it has something to do with the pin and the view port, the pin is not bigger then then the view port but if there isn't enough pixels of padding after the pin = to the viewport it does this bouncing.  I have torn this apart and I haven't been able to figure it out.  I have ruled out some jquery height and outerHeight issues \n. I had to alter my examples because I was not able to figure this out,  my solution was really just not have a pin so near the bottom of the page.  \n. optimine.nextmp.net  \n\nIf you click on some of the bottom platform nav items you see the scrolling happen through the animations and it offsets the link.\n\nThe two main issues,  \n1.  I am doing so much pinning on the page that the anchors for the hrefs that link to divs on the page are all in the wrong position.  \n2.  I tried turning off the pinning to fix this issue when I want to click on things and that did not work.  \n\nI basically want to duplicate the functionality in the source code for jumpedPast on load,  but there doesn't seem to be an exposed way to do that.\n. Yea I was actually looking at source code of it and debated on using it.  The pinning and the spacers are actually fine.  I was hard setting the animations to be completed and jumping past them fine but they would never reverse or complete again.  Really the only reason why I didn't just move it to ScrollMagic is the lack of documentation on it right now.  I don't mind beta projects.  \n\nThe biggest issue right now is that I am pinning a 400 pixel tall item but I want it to animate over lets say 600 pixels in the TimelineLite so I would have 10 elements that animate over 60 pixels each.  That difference between the two is what is causing me the most issues because my own manual spacers didn't seem to compensate for that.  I kinda need a way to trigger all the TimelineLite animations in the pins to not animate.\n\nI tried unpinning all the animations but that didn't seem to have the desired effect.\n. Sure [removed] is my skype email I am logged in now.\n. Have you tried the same thing I did to resolve the issue by turning off pushFollowers and using divs with padding to do the spacing manually?\n. Sorry Jan for being so obscure,  I have tried having separate containers for triggering actions for the pins.  I also tried removing the resizing actions to see if that would resolve the issue, it did not.  Whatever was happening is not because of either of these separate thoughts, though I don't think I tried removing them both at the same time.  I will try to make a demo page as an example this week if I have time.  Basically what I think is happening is that some of the on reverse logic while in the middle of a pin is being wonky.\n\nFrom what I was able to diagnose by adding some log code is that the when initiating the reverse in the middle of a pin for some reason the state seems to stay pinned.  I will try to narrow down the cause more.\n\nJames\n. Hey Jan I was able to duplicate this issue in a much more simple form.\n\nhttp://optimine.com/news  \n\nAll of these pins the triggers and the effected objects are different, there are only two pins,  and I am able to get this to replicate almost always,  I am able to get a grey background at the top to offset because a pin gets stuck.\n\nI have narrowed it down even more, it appears some how the original positioning gets corrupted.  The pin position for the object normally is \n\norigPositioning: Object\nleft: \"auto\"\npos: \"relative\"\ntop: \"auto\"\n\nand some how it gets set to \n\norigPositioning: Object\nleft: \"\"\npos: undefined\ntop: \"\"\n. Alright this is even more of a fun issue,  so I have really narrowed this down.  This only happens when the starting point of the pin is a scroll position 0,  IE when the pin starts at the top of the page.  This is because of a logic issue on line 187  (currScrollPoint < startPoint && pinObj.state === 'AFTER')  on line 187  \n\nIf the start point is 0 then this logic can't be true.  That way it won't stall on the logic sometimes?  This happens because of scrolling has it been set to a strange state.\n\nI have tested this and this has resolved my issue but I just don't want to break anything else and you are more familiar with the code then I am.  \n\nI submitted a change request on the old superscroll to have that included.\n. I have had this issue happen a number of times with me as well,  I took a 3 step approach to this,  wrap all animations in a timeline, it is really easy to wrap a timeline inside of a timeline to make sure everything happens in a sequence, manually clean up bad animation with simple jquery function, ensure everything happens in the tweens by not having triggering elements also have animation happen to them.  \n\nI used timelineLite to wrap all tweens to make sure they finish and are handled.  This seemed to help with my issues,  even if I only have one animation for the tween I still put it in there.  This also gives me onStart, onUpdate and onComplete ability to trigger functions to clean up some mess on animation.  When I scrolled fast for example I would have multiple animations stuck in an active state.  Most of my animations are progressively triggering display:block on display:none elements so I made a quick script to hide the siblings of the element.  See code below,  on every update the function runs to make sure no stuck frames in the animation.  You could run this on just onComplete if you wanted, onUpdateScope lets me pass the jquery object I want to make sure $(this) is referencing so the function is really simple.  \n\n```\nvar timeLine1 = new TimelineLite({align: \"sequence\"})\n    .append([TweenMax.to($('#display-platform-list .frame-1'), 2, {css:{display:'block'},onUpdate:removeSiblings,onUpdateScope:$('#display-platform-list .frame-1')})])\n    .append([TweenMax.to($('#display-platform-list .frame-2'), 2, {css:{display:'block'},onUpdate:removeSiblings,onUpdateScope:$('#display-platform-list .frame-2')})])\n    .append([TweenMax.to($('#display-platform-list .frame-3'), 2, {css:{display:'block'},onUpdate:removeSiblings,onUpdateScope:$('#display-platform-list .frame-3')})])\n    .append([TweenMax.to($('#display-platform-list .frame-4'), 2, {css:{display:'block'},onUpdate:removeSiblings,onUpdateScope:$('#display-platform-list .frame-4')})])\n    .append([TweenMax.to($('#display-platform-list .frame-5'), 2, {css:{display:'block'},onUpdate:removeSiblings,onUpdateScope:$('#display-platform-list .frame-5')})])\n    .append([TweenMax.fromTo( $('#platform .callout'), 1, {css:{opacity: 1}}, {css:{opacity: 0}})]);\n\nfunction removeSiblings(){\n    $(this).siblings().hide();\n}\n```\n\nI am not sure how much this specific example applies to your situation but hope it gives you some ideas.  I would also advise you not to mess with top and left when doing animations because this will confuse placements, try to use margins where possible.\n. I agree with jan here the issue seems to be TweenMax not superscrollorama.  I was able to get this reset fine by using staggerFromTo and putting all the tweens in an array.  I did notice your issue I just think your issue is more in how you are implementing your tweens stefan.  My best suggestion at this point is to make sure you are on version 12 of the greensock code and review the documentation again http://api.greensock.com/js/ \n. This also fixes the issue but I am concerned we may have changed default functionality.  \n\nWhen I do this fix and and I click a link that takes me to a div that has a pin on it.  Instead of being at the end of the animation it is at the beginning of the animation.  \n\nI had noticed this as well and my client wanted to have the animation already played out on the pin.  Basically when the scroll height = the pin height it will be at the beginning instead of at the end.  Maybe we need a 3rd case or an option to see what people want that to be?\n\nI guess this happens with me more because I am moving around the page using scrollTop and I end up at the exact height of pins a lot.\n. I agree with you Jan that I should limit myself to the specific issue,  I may code a way to determine what you want the animation position to be 0 or 1 when you pin position start and scroll position are the same.  This really only can happen if you navigated to the element from a click or if you are starting the pin at the top of a page.  This would be helpful for people who want to maintain a navigation structure that works with the scrolling instead of having just one page.  \n\nI updated my pull request and I will initiate another when I am happy with the code I am adjusting as a feature.\n\nJames\n. Part of the problem is this behavior has been inconsistent,  not whether were it is in the animation cycle,  when I would click on a link with a pin and the link would take me to the same pin it would behave differently if you would scroll down to the link vs scrolling up to the link.  Irrelevant of the issue on what the behavior is there should be a consistent behavior for the clicking a link to a pin.   Resolving that part of the issue I am considering a separate problem because I don't see a good way of solving it right now.  \n. You can reproduce on optimine.com \n\nUse the top nav under platform to reproduce.\n\nQuirk 1.\n\nClick on the link under platform for display,  you will notice you start at the beginning of the animation.  Scroll past it and click on the link again and you will notice you are at the end of the animation.\n\nQuirk 2. \n\nClick on the about page in the top nav, then use the platform -> display link again to go back to the home page and you will see that you are at the end of the animation when switching from another page.  \n. I will make a example html page and put it in my repository this week.\n. Hey Jan I am not done with my example I spent some of my time on helping other people out this morning hoping to be done by tomorrow.\n. I have been in super crunch time the last couple of months with a job\nchange.

I have found that IE 9 and 10 even on a great system just handle most scroll animations in a very clunky manner, there are efforts to overcome that but IE javascript engine is just subpar.  \n. I think it is possible,  you are going to have to adjust your animations mid animation so fire an onComplete for the animation once it is done so and force it to do something else.  It is going to be really tricky but I think it is doable.  \n. I took a short look at it yesterday, think the issue maybe on the jquery\nside, will play around with it today to confirm.\nOn Oct 27, 2013 3:03 AM, \"webfreak7\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> First of all, thank you for all the effort you have put in so far.\n> I have finally put up the website at the following address\n> http://www.appsforaptitude.org/learnhtml/index.html\n> I have updated my scrollTo plugin, and made sure the problem was in\n> scrollorama.

I really had a hard time reading your code I have re factored it.\n\n@janpaepke  as you can clearly see if you comment out adding the tweens and the animation the image is already there.  I am not a svg pro but I would either have the animation change the style of the color of the lines from like white to orange to get the desired effect or some other styling method.  This is clearly a animation issue to me and not a scrolling issue.  \n\n@sleepydada as @janpaepke has told me on some of my own projects get your animation to work correctly first then add it to your scrolling logic. It is sound advice.\n\n```\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=\"en-US\">\n<head>\n\n\n<title> Demo |  Goindoor</title>\n<script type='text/javascript' src='http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js?ver=3.7.1'></script>\n<script type='text/javascript' src='http://www.chartjs.org/docs/Chart.js?ver=3.7.1'></script>\n<script type='text/javascript' src='http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/latest/TweenMax.min.js?ver=3.7.1'></script>\n<script type='text/javascript' src='http://www.goindoor.com/wp-content/themes/salient/js/jquery.superscrollorama.js?ver=3.7.1'></script>\n<script type='text/javascript' src='http://www.goindoor.com/wp-content/themes/salient/js/goindoor.js?ver=3.7.1'></script>\n\n</head>\n\n\n<body>\n<div id=\"padding\" style=\"padding-top: 300px;\"></div>\n<div id=\"hospital_drawing\">\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" version=\"1.1\"  height=\"500\" width=\"960\">\n      <path id=\"lineAB\" d=\"M 706 10 l 89 57\"  stroke-width=\"3\" fill=\"none\" />\n      <path id=\"lineBC\" d=\" M 795 67 l 0 126\"  stroke-width=\"3\" fill=\"none\" />\n      <path id=\"lineCD\" d=\"M 795 192 l 114 73\"  stroke-width=\"3\" fill=\"none\" />\n      <path id=\"lineDE\" d=\"M 909 265 l -625 0\"  stroke-width=\"3\" fill=\"none\" />\n      <path id=\"lineEF\" d=\" M 284 265 l 0 70\" stroke-width=\"3\" fill=\"none\" />\n      <path id=\"lineFG\" d=\"M 284 335 l 92 53\"  stroke-width=\"3\" fill=\"none\" />\n    </svg>\n</div>\n\n\n<script>\n\njQuery(document).ready(function(e) {\n\n    var controller = jQuery.superscrollorama({});\n    var timeLine1 = new TimelineLite({})\n\n    var orig1 = document.querySelector('#lineAB');\n    var obj1 = {length:0,pathLength:orig1.getTotalLength()};\n    orig1.style.stroke = '#f60';\n\n    var orig2 = document.querySelector('#lineBC');\n    var obj2 = {length:0,pathLength:orig2.getTotalLength()};\n    orig2.style.stroke = '#f60';\n\n    var orig3 = document.querySelector('#lineCD');\n    var obj3 = {length:0,pathLength:orig3.getTotalLength()};\n    orig3.style.stroke = '#f60';\n\n    var orig4 = document.querySelector('#lineDE');\n    var obj4 = {length:0,pathLength:orig4.getTotalLength()};\n    orig4.style.stroke = '#f60';\n\n    var orig5 = document.querySelector('#lineEF');\n    var obj5 = {length:0,pathLength:orig5.getTotalLength()};\n    orig5.style.stroke = '#f60';\n\n    var orig6 = document.querySelector('#lineFG');\n    var obj6 = {length:0,pathLength:orig6.getTotalLength()};\n    orig6.style.stroke = '#f60';\n\n    function drawLine1() {orig1.style.strokeDasharray = [obj1.length,obj1.pathLength].join(' ');}\n    function drawLine2() {orig2.style.strokeDasharray = [obj2.length,obj2.pathLength].join(' ');}\n    function drawLine3() {orig3.style.strokeDasharray = [obj3.length,obj3.pathLength].join(' ');}\n    function drawLine4() {orig4.style.strokeDasharray = [obj4.length,obj4.pathLength].join(' ');}\n    function drawLine5() {orig5.style.strokeDasharray = [obj5.length,obj5.pathLength].join(' ');}\n    function drawLine6() {orig6.style.strokeDasharray = [obj6.length,obj6.pathLength].join(' ');}\n\n     // You can comment out this code for the tweens and timeline to prevent the animation\n\n//  var tween1 = TweenMax.to(obj1, .5, {length:obj1.pathLength, onUpdate:drawLine1, delay:4,ease:Linear.easeNone,immediateRender: false});\n//  var tween2 = TweenMax.to(obj2, .5, {length:obj2.pathLength, onUpdate:drawLine2, delay:6,ease:Linear.easeNone,immediateRender: false});\n//  var tween3 = TweenMax.to(obj3, .5, {length:obj3.pathLength, onUpdate:drawLine3, delay:8,ease:Linear.easeNonem,immediateRender: false});\n//  var tween4 = TweenMax.to(obj4, .5, {length:obj4.pathLength, onUpdate:drawLine4, delay:10,ease:Linear.easeNone,immediateRender: false});\n//  var tween5 = TweenMax.to(obj5, .5, {length:obj5.pathLength, onUpdate:drawLine5, delay:12,ease:Linear.easeNone,immediateRender: false});\n//  var tween6 = TweenMax.to(obj6, .5, {length:obj6.pathLength, onUpdate:drawLine6, delay:14,ease:Linear.easeNone,immediateRender: false});\n\n//  tl.timeLine1([tween1, tween2, tween3, tween4, tween5, tween6], \"+=2\", \"sequence\", 0.5);\n\n});\n</script>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n. I still think this is a fundamental problem in the way you are doing your tweens and adding them to the controller.  From what I can tell you are just overwriting your own tweens.   \n\nReview the following property of timelinemax\n\nhttp://www.greensock.com/overwritemanager/\n\noverwrite : int Controls how (and if) other tweens of the same target are overwritten by this tween. There are several modes to choose from, and TweenMax automatically calls OverwriteManager.init() if you haven\u2019t already manually dones so, which means that by default AUTO mode is used (please see http://www.greensock.com/overwritemanager/ for details and a full explanation of the various modes):\nNONE (0) (or false)\nALL_IMMEDIATE (1) (or true)\nAUTO (2) \u2013 this is the default mode for TweenMax.\nCONCURRENT (3)\nALL_ONSTART (4)\nPREEXISTING (5)\nExample: TweenMax.to(mc, 1, {x:100, overwrite:5});\n\nBy default you are on auto you are having some overwriting issues,  you really have two ways around this.  Wrap everything in a timelinelite and force it to go through a sequence or be better about managing your tweens overwriting.  \n. If you wanna post your modified code so I can take a look I will make adjustments to it later today.  Basically you are just trying to force each animation to play out and not jump and you can do that in the timeline.\n. If you really want to ensure that the animation happens the way you want, I would make a function to trigger an add to the timeline lite oncomplete from the previous tween.  You pass in a parameter for the next tween and if you follow a naming schema you can do it dynamically.  \n\nI think you are running into the fundamental issue of how superscrollorama interacts with the greensock animation is that it updates the progress of the timeline or tween based on the scroll amount vs number of pixels you have for the scroll.  \n\nAs in the previous issue I gave you an example where onUpdate i was running a js function to clean up the animation,  it is going to happen where the progress gets messed up.  I really only see the two ways of getting around this if you can't get your animation to work right within a timeline.  \n\nHowever I still feel that you can accomplish this in a normal timeline if you set the overwrite property to none.  If that still doesn't work then you will have to manually clean up your tweens.\n1.  Dynamically add the next tween on on complete and update,  which this is going to be rather cumbersome.\n2.  Have a function that keeps track of where you are in progress of the animation.  If you have 10 tweens and jumped to tween 3,  make sure you onStart check where you are in your progress and force the animation to do what you want. \n. It was a specific bug in that version of Jquery fyi the problem doesn't exist in 1.9 or 2.0  I had actually debated on fixing  this as well but it wasn't related to my current issue.  \n. 1st.  This is pretty easy to do,  you have several pinned animations based on certain divs,  you animate through your 3-4 frames you want for that pin then let normal scrolling happen down to the next pin.\n\n2nt.  I guess you could do some magic with the Control.MouseWheel but remember there are a bunch of people that does use mouse wheels to scroll they use the slider on the window frame or a mouse pad for example, there really isn't a good way of doing what you want here.  \n. There is a bug tgat when the pinned element is bigger then half the view\nport left it bounces it back up, only way to confirm u are having this\nissue is to put like 1000 px of padding on a spacer if the issue goes away\nthat is the issue, no way to resolve at this point.\nOn Nov 24, 2013 8:21 AM, \"mjpugh\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Hi,\n> I have a landing page containing several sections of content.

So here is the code that you are using.  First question would be why are you doing a check animation in the middle of adding all your controllers.\n\nThe specific animation your are complaining about #titulo-centros from what I can tell the vertical size of the animation is small enough that it is being triggered on multiple scroll ticks,  you can try making the animation a fromTo or you may have to pin the animation to take up a bigger number of pixels on the scrolling so it doesn't trigger multiple times on a scroll.\n\n```\n     $(document).ready(function() {\n        var controller = $.superscrollorama();\n        triggerAtCenter: false,\n        controller.addTween('#substage1', TweenMax.from( $('#substage1'), .95, {delay: .25, css:{opacity:0, rotation: 720}, ease:Quad.easeOut}));\n        controller.addTween('#substage2', TweenMax.from( $('#substage2'), .35, {delay: 1.3, css:{opacity:0}, ease:Quad.easeOut}));\n        controller.addTween('#substage3', TweenMax.from( $('#substage3'), .35, {delay: 1.8, css:{opacity:0}, ease:Quad.easeOut}));\n        controller.triggerCheckAnim();\n        controller.addTween('#fly-it', TweenMax.from( $('#fly-it'), .45, {css:{right:'1000px'}, ease:Quad.easeInOut}));\n        controller.addTween('.sectionText', TweenMax.from( $('.sectionText'), .35, {delay: .75, css:{opacity:0}, ease:Quad.easeOut}));\n        controller.addTween('#titulo', TweenMax.fromTo( $('#titulo'), .25, {css:{opacity:0,}, immediateRender:true, ease:Quad.easeInOut}, {css:{opacity:1, 'letter-spacing':'-10px'}, ease:Quad.easeInOut}), 0, 100); // 100 px offset for better timing \n        controller.addTween('#slider', TweenMax.fromTo( $('#slider'), .25, {css:{opacity:0, fontSize:'20px'}, immediateRender:true, ease:Quad.easeInOut}, {css:{opacity:1, fontSize:'240px'}, ease:Quad.easeInOut}));\n        controller.addTween('#cartel', TweenMax.from( $('#cartel'), .45, {css:{bottom:'400px'}, ease:Quad.easeInOut}));\n        controller.addTween('#titulo-centros', TweenMax.from( $('#titulo-centros'), .25, {delay: 10.5, css:{opacity:0}, ease:Quad.easeOut}));\n        controller.addTween('#senal1', TweenMax.from( $('#senal1'), .35, {delay: .25, css:{opacity:0}, ease:Quad.easeOut}));\n        controller.addTween('.piz', TweenMax.from( $('.piz'), .35, {delay: .45, css:{opacity:0}, ease:Quad.easeOut}));\n\n\n});\n```\n.

This only affects pins near the bottom of\nthe page.\n\nOn Tue, Feb 18, 2014 at 8:30 AM, sreejith notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> hi,\n> i'm using superscrollorama in my current project...\n> \n> my client need 7 pinned divisions, so i made it like that...\n> \n> the problem is, when i open the page in chrome and move to the 7th pinned\n> division, which is the last one, i get a flickering effect.\n> \n> How can I fix it?\n> \n> this is the link where i set the page\n> http://focaloid.fesstoon.com/scroll\n> \n> ## \n> \n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/johnpolacek/superscrollorama/issues/154\n> .\n.

Your very simple solution worked like a charm. Thanks!\n. Hi Jan,\n\nThanks for the quick response. Setting \"pushFollowers\" to false creates more problems than it solves. I'm not sure if this is intended, but setting that parameter to \"false\" does not prevent creation of spacer elements, though their height seems to be set to the viewport height vs. scroll duration. I updated the staging site link from above with the parameter set to false so you can see what is happening.\n\nIt's likely I just don't know how to use that parameter. If I am pinning each <article> element, should each <article> element have a particular height (e.g., the viewport height), or should I be adding my own spacers after each <article>?\n\nSwitching between stories as described above still creates multiple spacers, though I can't tell if this is what is causing my animations to break down.\n\nP.S. There is also a strange \"jump\" when you scroll to the bottom of the page, and I have no idea how to prevent that. It seems to happen sometimes, usually when you are at the bottom of the page. I don't know how to resolve it but suspect it is related to issue #29 (you proposed the same solution of using \"pushFollowers=false\" there).\n\nThanks.\n. Hi Jan,\n\nThanks for the clarification :)\n\nI'm getting somewhere now. There is one small issue remaining: if you check the staging link I sent you (updated) you'll see I've added spacers after each <article> with a class of \"myspacer\". These are in addition to Scrollorama's spacers. For some reason, the scroll duration between the first and second <article> is larger than the scroll duration between any of the other spacers. It seems that the scroll duration between the first and second <article> is the sum of your spacer and my spacer, but just my spacer on subsequent articles.\n\nAny idea why that is?\n\nAlso, you'll see the \"jump\" still on the staging link. Let me know when we can address that. Thank you VERY MUCH for your awesome help.\n\nRyan\n. Hi Jan,\n\nMy apologies -- I had the wrong version of the page live. It's in flux because that link is being used for internal review of the site while it's in development. If you look now, you'll see that the second <article> takes longer to appear than the ones after it. The \"jitter\" at the bottom of the page (that prevents you from scrolling to the very bottom) is no longer a problem, but I don't know why it went away. I'm guessing it has to do with the height of pinned elements, but could never determine that for certain.\n\n**Update:** I discovered the cause of the extra space between the first and second <article> elements. It's because I am not pinning the first element, and animating it in separately. I've been unable to determine how to even out the spacing.\n. Hi Jan,\n\nI tried fiddling with the height but to no avail. It's something I'll need to work out and doesn't seem related to your plugin. Thank you for your awesome help on this.\n. Hi Jan,\n\nThanks for the reply. I would love to try ScrollMagic, but the site just went live so refactoring the code at this point is not an option.\n\nI made a short screen capture video for you. It's in .wmv format, so let me know if you need another format.\n\nThe first part of the clip shows me successfully scrolling to the bottom. Notice there is no jumping.\n\nThen, I resize the browser window, and scroll down tot he bottom again. Notice how the contact form jumps down again and again. This is because the form's position is switching between \"fixed\" and \"relative\".\n\nAt the end of the clip, I maximize the browser and scroll down again to show that, when the window is large enough to contain the pinned area, the problem disappears.\n\nHopefully this helps illustrate the problem. Let me know if you need any more details!\n\nThis does not appear to be a problem in Firefox, but is an issue in Chrome and IE.\n\nHere is a link to the video:\n\nhttp://factionmedia.com/scroll-capture.wmv\n.

I don't know how to resolve it but suspect it is related to issue #29 (you proposed the same solution of using \"pushFollowers=false\" there).\n\nThanks.\n. Hi Jan,\n\nThanks for the clarification :)\n\nI'm getting somewhere now. There is one small issue remaining: if you check the staging link I sent you (updated) you'll see I've added spacers after each <article> with a class of \"myspacer\". These are in addition to Scrollorama's spacers. For some reason, the scroll duration between the first and second <article> is larger than the scroll duration between any of the other spacers. It seems that the scroll duration between the first and second <article> is the sum of your spacer and my spacer, but just my spacer on subsequent articles.\n\nAny idea why that is?\n\nAlso, you'll see the \"jump\" still on the staging link. Let me know when we can address that. Thank you VERY MUCH for your awesome help.\n\nRyan\n. Hi Jan,\n\nMy apologies -- I had the wrong version of the page live. It's in flux because that link is being used for internal review of the site while it's in development. If you look now, you'll see that the second <article> takes longer to appear than the ones after it. The \"jitter\" at the bottom of the page (that prevents you from scrolling to the very bottom) is no longer a problem, but I don't know why it went away. I'm guessing it has to do with the height of pinned elements, but could never determine that for certain.\n\n**Update:** I discovered the cause of the extra space between the first and second <article> elements. It's because I am not pinning the first element, and animating it in separately. I've been unable to determine how to even out the spacing.\n. Hi Jan,\n\nI tried fiddling with the height but to no avail. It's something I'll need to work out and doesn't seem related to your plugin. Thank you for your awesome help on this.\n. Hi Jan,\n\nThanks for the reply. I would love to try ScrollMagic, but the site just went live so refactoring the code at this point is not an option.\n\nI made a short screen capture video for you. It's in .wmv format, so let me know if you need another format.\n\nThe first part of the clip shows me successfully scrolling to the bottom. Notice there is no jumping.\n\nThen, I resize the browser window, and scroll down tot he bottom again. Notice how the contact form jumps down again and again. This is because the form's position is switching between \"fixed\" and \"relative\".\n\nAt the end of the clip, I maximize the browser and scroll down again to show that, when the window is large enough to contain the pinned area, the problem disappears.\n\nHopefully this helps illustrate the problem. Let me know if you need any more details!\n\nThis does not appear to be a problem in Firefox, but is an issue in Chrome and IE.\n\nHere is a link to the video:\n\nhttp://factionmedia.com/scroll-capture.wmv\n.

The offset should be where in the page the animation should start?.\n\nAm I getting warmer?\n\nI really appreciate your patience.\n\nLisa\n. Wow. Thanks again for your help!\n\nLisa\n. Thanks, Jan.

    "elegos": "Hello @janpaepke,\n\nI simply tried to pin an absolute-positioned DIV nearly at the start of the DOM. This produced (on Chrome for Windows) an odd behavior which resets the scroll position back (not sure if at scroll position 0 or at the beginning of the original position of the pinned element). I then tried to pin an element inside of it (disabling the pinning of the first element) with the option not to push followers and it worked OK. A friend of mine told me that this bug wasn't present on Chrome for OSX, and it's not present on Firefox.\n\nI've now replaced the contents of the page with a parallax effect for the terrain. While on my laptop it works perfectly (with the touchpad), on my desktop (with scrolling wheel), the parallax effect bumps instead of being fluid. Is there anything I can do in order to avoid this behavior?\n\nThanks\n. Hello @janpaepke,\n\nI simply tried to pin an absolute-positioned DIV nearly at the start of the DOM.
