Loadbuilder doesn't seem to like this syntax when trying to build the standalone flight.js file.\n. This is still an acceptable AMD format [according to the spec](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD#simplified-commonjs-wrapping-), but there's no requirement for an AMD loader to scan for dependencies.

Great, thanks. Still need to move the `ran = true` line.\n. Looks like it might have been because you referenced `utils` rather than `util`.

Adding the debug module to the standalone build would result it in getting shipped into production a lot.\n. Pretty sure there are people using the build for real. Once we port the lib to commonjs, I thought it could be good to have a repo at 'github.com/flightjs/flight-umd' that hosts the built UMD bundles.

I've integrated the change into the branch for #294. Thanks for this.\n. Merged in e66b0ec7d644a566b9aca31ec10469d64a596eda\n. Is this still an issue in the stable release (`1.2.0`) that includes `this.attributes`?\n. I think the docs are quite clear on this though.\n\nThe signature clearly shows that the first arg is optional, can be any DOM node, and defaults to the root node. The first example shows an event being bound to `document`. It's also noted that the handler argument can be a map of targets to callbacks, and that this is effectively event delegation to the root node.\n. If you read @patricknixon's comment, you'll see why I mentioned those other things.\n\nI can't see why you'd assume that the selector is relative to `this.node` when that isn't said or implied anywhere, and the examples often use `document` as the first arg.\n. OK. Going to reopen. Please improve this part of the docs as you see fit.\n. > it seems weird for a component to know about the \"other world\" DOM structure.\n\nYeah I know what you mean. I think we only use that feature to bind to the `document` to listen to global events (e.g., data updates). But you could probably use an event emitter for that rather than the DOM, and then enforce encapsulation in the library.\n. none of our codebases use es6 modules. commonjs is widespread and not going away any time soon.\n. yeah i know, but we write all our code as commonjs.\n. Yes I hope so. And available on npm.\n. Changes to jasmine-flight to support a switch to commonjs: https://github.com/flightjs/jasmine-flight/pull/44\n. Would want more review of the changes to the test extensions and the consequences that might have on testing your app. Wasn't so keen on having to let the karma preprocessor/files know about every commonjs file in your dependency tree.\n. the commonjs stuff has been in limbo for a while and isn't a requirement of getting flight registered with npm. so instead, we could publish the UMD build to npm (using a `prepublish` script to build it) and make sure the test extensions work with node's require.\n. Closing. Will leave the branch in place if there's interest in picking it up in the future.\n. Added npm support https://github.com/flightjs/flight/commit/f462336da539e9bb0c5489969584258c89b62149\n\nI published `1.3.0` to npm.\n. Fixed the unused 'require'. Should be good to merge now.\n.

We're not going to add version numbers to the source code files. How are you installing the library?\n. @giuseppeg neither will be the element you're after afaik. Question is about whether we can instead augment the jquery `event` with a new property (e.g., `e.delegator`), since it's the object that has all the other node references, rather than polluting the event payload. With this Flight pattern, you can't do a simple iteration over the props of the data in a handler, because you have to filter out `el` in case the handler is used in this delegation pattern. \n. Merged\n. Thanks\n. Closing. Will leave the branch in place if there's interest in picking it up in the future.\n. Would be good if TD could help with that.

There's an existing PR you can try using - I'd be surprised if it \"just worked\" but you never know!\n. I'd be interested in us `require`-ing jQuery. We could set it as a peer dependency for the npm-install too. I believe it was originally included as a global due to the requirements of many jQuery plugins. But modern build tools like Webpack have features that can help:\n\nFor example: inject jQuery into modules that use jQuery as a global variable; or extract jQuery from modules where it is `require`-ed so that jQuery can be included in a separate bundle.\n\nhttp://webpack.github.io/docs/list-of-plugins.html#provideplugin\nhttp://webpack.github.io/docs/shimming-modules.html#plugin-provideplugin\nhttp://webpack.github.io/docs/library-and-externals.html\nhttps://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/108#issuecomment-26287856\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/a/23374129\n.

Well, TweetDeck renders everything client-side, in the UI components. We use Hogan, so the templates are pre-compiled and very fast to render. HTML is definitely a UI thing, not a data thing, so it should be exclusively ui components that deal with it. \n\nAs for getting the templates, check out the flight-hogan mixin, (https://github.com/tbrd/flight-hogan). It uses the mixin definition scope to cache compiled templates for the whole site, so there's no need to pass them as arguments. In TweetDeck, we have a templates cache outside the flight framework - a throwback from the pre-flight days.\n\nI figure templates are closely tied to the UI component that renders them - it's going to be rare that a UI component is going to render different templates with the same data.

I don't think this is the issue, but there's no need to keep a reference to\nself in your mixin. Methods are executed in the component context. E.g.:\n\ndefine(function (require) {\n     'use strict';\n     var defineComponent = require(\u2018flight/lib/component\u2019);\n     var myMixin = require(\u2018mixins/ui/withMyMixin\u2019);\n\n```\nreturn defineComponent(MyComponent, withMyMixin);\nfunction MyComponent() {\n    this.doAnimations = function(){\n        var someObject = {};\n        someObject.field = 'something'\n        this.trigger('triggerAnimation', someObject);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n});\n\ndefine(function () {\n     'use strict';\n     return MyMixin;\n     function MyMixin() {\n      this.after('initialize', function () {\n            this.on('triggerAnimation', this.startAnimations);\n          });\n          this.startAnimations = function(){\n              // doing some work here\n          }\n     }\n});\n\nIf you need to use a method as a callback from a jquery method (such as\nanimate complete), you can bind it to the current context:\n\nthis.startAnimations = function () {\n  this.select('aSelector').animate({top: 100}, {\n   complete: this.onAnimationComplete.bind(this)\n  });\n};\n.

Will verify performance across browsers shortly.\n. @dilvie although the iframe thing can be dodgy for testing instanceof in the case of $ being passed between iframes, I think it's highly unlikely you'd be running flight in one frame and installing jquery in another\n\n@akre54 FWIW my tests show instance of to be slightly slower in chrome and significantly slower in firefox and IE. But I'm not really concerned about performance in either case. It's just not called often enough for 100,000 times per second to be considered a concern.\n\nIt would be nice if flight were decoupled from jQuery, but that is a huge project and this change would be the tip of the iceberg (actually that test might no longer even be required if we had no jQuery) \n. Thanks - will take a look. \nClosing since not an issue or bug\n. thanks! fixed\n. Not a bad idea - will consider this. Thanks!\n. pedantry welcome :) \n. current dependency is jquery 1.83 - will modify when upgrading to jquery 1.9\n.

It's just for demo purposes. \n. this will make me happy too :)\n. es5-shim is using a symlink to map component.json to package.json - which seems to cause a problem for windows.\nsee https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/issues/751\n\nYou could try forking es5-shim and then just copy package.json into component.json \nfailing that I would manually copy es5-shim.js and es5-sham.js to components/es5-shim \n. thanks - fix pulled\n. thank you - nicely done\n. thank you!\n. How to Install is here https://github.com/twitter/flight#installation\nGeneral suggestions are good - will work on it.\n. @alex-seville @jamm see also https://github.com/twitter/flight/issues/19\n. thanks!\n. not duplicates: one is es5-shim, other is es5sham\n. Yes, by all means. Components are not defined in terms of DOM nodes, rather you attach an instance of a Component to one or more DOM nodes after it is defined. There is nothing to stop DOM node of one component instance being nested inside the DOM node of another.\n\nAre you having an issue with it?\n. actually its requirejs.js in component directory - but wrongly so\nwill make a new branch to fix both at once then merge\nthanks for the PR!\n. thanks!\n. Yes this is true - it appears to be a css issue rather than something directly related to flight or JavaScript so I figured we could live with it. (The icons are nested within disabled buttons - but for some reason are not themselves disabled)\n\nClosing as not an issue with flight itself\n. Hi \n\nSo each Block instance needs an attr value that specifies the DOM selector it should listen on, this can be done by passing a custom attr via attachTo.\n\nSo:\n\n```\nMenu.attachTo('#menu1');\nMenu.attachTo('#menu2');\nBlock.attachTo('#block1', {menuSelector: '#menu1'});\nBlock.attachTo('#block2', {menuSelector: '#menu1'});\n```\n\nThen in the Block component, let the listener know which selector to listen on (this is the optional first argument of component.on)\n\n```\nthis.on(this.attr.menuSelector, 'menuItemClicked', changeColor)\n```\n\nIf the new color is also customizable it should be sent as payload when 'menuItemClicked' is triggered by Menu\n\n```\nthis.trigger('menuItemClicked', {color:red});\n```\n\n(again if the color is instance specific it can be passed via `attachTo`)\n\nThis can be picked up by the data argument of the callback on Block \n\n```\nthis.changeColor(ev, data) {\n  $node.css({'color': data.color});\n}\n```\n\nHope this helps!          \n. I take your point about the coupling implications of being told to listen to events on specific DOM node - but I feel that returning a component as a handle so that it's methods can be invoked externally is a much tighter coupling. Once you make a component API available to the outside world the component is no longer isolated and you are inviting a ratcheting up of complexity.\n\nAlso bear in mind I am not suggesting listening to events from a specific component - just listening to any event emanating from a DOM node. It could originate from one of many components, or it could be a native DOM event - we don't care and we don't need to know.\n\nI don't know your DOM structure - but I'd also suggest you don't need to listen to the menu element specifically - as long as you listen on any DOM node that events from the other menu will not bubble up to.\n\nAlternatively (and perhaps most simply) just have the second menu trigger a different event name from the first menu.\n. thanks!\n. It works for me - what error are you seeing?\n. does f12 developer tools show an error message in the console?\nUpdate: OK I notice it fails in IE8 compatibility mode. Are you running IE9 in IE8 compatibility mode? Will fix this anyway. \n. Glad it worked\n\nI've just fixed for IE8 now. (https://github.com/twitter/flight/commit/116175d133)\nHaven't tested the demo app in IE7 - but flight framework should work in IE7\n. 1. Not yet.\n2. It would have worked as an AMD module too. For twitter.com we found having jQuery as a module made designing jQuery plugin modules unsatisfactory\n. thanks - pulling (but I'll follow with my own PR to put all parameter marshaling up front, and also add a test to make sure non function callbacks fail on the correct exception)\n. done: resolved merge conflicts manually\n. thanks!\n. We did this to discourage passing of functions between components. Allowing a component's functionality to be invoked, by proxy, elsewhere compromises the isolation of a function - making testing more tricky and inviting model complexity.\n\nYou can run with debug off if this is not a concern to you. Curious what your use case for passing a jQuery object is\n. No - the reason it is only forbidden in debug mode is so it is caught in development. We didn't want such tests in production because of inconsistent cross browser support and the additional (albeit slight) overhead of the postMessage.\n\nWas asking about passing jQuery object in case there was a good use case that we had overlooked. Disallowing non-serializable payloads was primarily targeted at discouraging function payloads - but I'm not seeing a good use case for passing jQuery objects either (not saying there isn't one - just not seeing one)\n. @simonsmith\u2014basically this https://github.com/twitter/flight/issues/38#issuecomment-13390278\nWe don't want to compromise the decoupling of components. Limiting their external object dependencies to simple hashes, primitives etc. keeps them detangled and easily testable.\n. many thanks for these - curiously demo worked for me in IE8 vmware\n. Hi Michal\n\nDid you try this?\n\n```\nthis.on(this.attr.inputSelector, 'blur', blurCb);\n```\n\n(you can specify the DOM node - or selector thereof - to attach the listener to).\nAlso, should be no need to bind the callback - flight ensures it gets bound to the component instance by default.\n\nHope this helps!\n. Ok - maybe I should wait for the demo - but to clarify (in case it helps) - if the callback argument is a function the binding happens immediately, but if its a hash the binding happens at event time (much like `live` or `delegate` in jQuery)\n\nI think, however, you already grasped this, since in your original example you were indeed passing a hash - and the problem is that blur just doesn't bubble up at all. Is there no way you can bind after the element is dynamically created?\n\nMaybe this is something we could look to fix in flight.\n. @cam-stitt Thanks, planning to do this!\nLooking forward to checking out the app\n. thanks!\n. @houfeng0707 actually `withDialog` is itself just a mixin, we're not interested in its prototype.  Instead we want `withPositioning` to be mixed into whatever `withDialog` is being mixed into - which is represented by `this`, i.e. the context in which `withDialog` is being invoked.\n\nBy way of example, imagine we have a Component type called `TweetBox` which is defined by mixing the core `tweetBox` function with the mixin `withDialog`: \n\n```\ndefineComponent(tweetBox, withDialog);\n\nfunction tweetBox() {//... \n```\n\nSo now when `withDialog` is being invoked using the original code you cited above, `this` is `TweetBox.prototype` and that's what both `withDialog` and `withPosition` will be mixed into.\n\nHope this helps. It probably sounds confusing in words, but once you play with the code it should become apparent. Please look at the [demoApp source code](https://github.com/twitter/flight/tree/gh-pages/demo) for more examples.\n. thanks!\n. Flight does not dictate how you should model your data or where your data model should live. That's your choice.\n\ntwitter.com generates HTML from server-side data models. Tweetdeck, on the other hand, uses client-side data modelling.\n\nThere is no requirement to use DOM data-attributes. \n. @tbrd this looks great - thanks!\n\nminor issues in run_tests.js:\n1) remove the loadrunner specific comments from the top\n2) either remove console.log of tests, or move unshift 'lib/component' to after console.log\n. you can do this by using \n\n```\nthis.after('<fnName>', function() {\n  //..\n});\n```\n\nsee https://github.com/twitter/flight#advice\n. yes, you can add a mixin to anything at anytime:\n\n```\ncompose.mixin(componentInstance, [arrayOfMixins]);\n```\n\nmake sure you import 'lib/compose'\n. @gbrits initialize is the only method guaranteed to be called by every component. Teardown is probably best managed by the client app\n. OK - just a heads up I'm planning to add a developer hook to `baseComponent`. Should be out in the next few days, but can't guarantee.\n. There's already an mixin called withBaseComponent which gets mixed into every component, but it's currently private within the scope of component.js. Might be a good idea to open this up so folks can add their own custom base behavior via before or after (see https://github.com/twitter/flight#advice). I'll look into it.\n\nIn the meantime I guess you could make a fork to either amend this mixin or add your own mixin here (see https://raw.github.com/twitter/flight/master/lib/component.js):\n\n```\n  // prepend common mixins to supplied list, then mixin all flavors\n  mixins.unshift(withBaseComponent, advice.withAdvice, registry.withRegistration);\n\n  compose.mixin(Component.prototype, mixins);\n```\n. @mkuklis the slice(3) is delightful :)\n\nI think @gbrits might be talking about a base component that all components will automatically extend - much as they extend `baseComponent` (internally) now.\n\nPlanning to add an external hook to `baseComponent` so that custom base code can be added by advice.\n. @fscz decorators (`after`, `before`, `around`) need to be called in the right sequence.\nYou need the `this.render` method to be in place before the `this.after('render', function() {})` decorator is invoked. The normal way to do this is to have base methods in the component and decorators in the mixin. So for example:\n\ncomponent\n\n```\nthis.render = function(ev,data) {\n  //base render functionality\n}\n```\n\nmixin\n\n```\nthis.after('render', function(ev,data) {\n  //extra decoration specific to the mixin\n});\n\nthis.after('initialize', function() {\n  //...\n  this.render(); //invokes render, including mixin's decoration\n}\n```\n\nHowever if the base `render` method does everything you want you don't need a decorator in the mixin. Also FWIW, if you had a decorator without a base `render` method it would still work - the decorator would, in this case, become the base `render` method\n\n(re-opening issue for a while as a general FYI)\n. @fscz hmm this should be working as you expect. When you do \n\n```\ndefineComponent(terminalComponent, withMemDB, withTemplate, withMedia);\n```\n\nthis creates one component containing all functions from all mixins. For your example to work it doesn't even matter which order the mixins are added (although they are, in fact, added in the order specified) because `initialize` is not called until you create an instance of the component (using `attachTo`)\n\nCan you post a simplified version of where you are defining the component and where you are doing `attachTo`? Thanks.\n\n(by the way you don't need to assign `this` to `self` in the `initialize` method)\n. @dannymidnight At twitter we have use a mixin that supplies an ajax wrapper. Instead of defining success and error callbacks, the wrapper defines success and error events, which will be auto-triggered with the ajax response.\n\nMaybe this may be the level of abstraction you're really looking for?\n. @simonsmith there's quite a lot of twitter specific stuff going on too, but in a nutshell, you pass the event names to the wrapper, which uses a helper method to make them into success/error callbacks which are then passed to the appropriate slots in the ajax call.\n. The optional first element specifies which DOM node you will listen for the event on. If it's not supplied it defaults to (as you say) the element you attach(ed)To \n. Easiest way would be to use `around` and only invoke original function if validation passes\n\n``` js\nthis.around('submit', function(originalSubmit) {\n  if (validates()) {\n    originalSubmit();\n  }\n}\n```\n. thanks! - fixed\n. @kevinrobinson this is one of those situations that can never be quite perfect. Yes it would be nice if the mixin could define a \"default default\"\u2014the problem is how do we know the developer's intention. It's possible that the mixin defines an `attr` with the same name purely by accident\u2014we don't want a situation where some mixins cannot be used with some components because of accidental name clashes. Similarly we can't assume the base `attr` always wins\u2014if it clobbers a mixin attribute that was intended for an entirely different purpose the mixin stops working.\n\nBottom line, we can't second guess the developer's intention, and we can't fail (or succeed) silently.\n. closing, see https://github.com/twitter/flight/pull/68\n. you can use http://api.jquery.com/selector/\n. Add a comment to explain why you building arguments array longhand\n. definitely add a comment to explain why you are building arguments array longhand.\n. you now have two successive this.on implementations\n. I make good and frequent use of describe (toString() evaluation) in developer tools debugging. Would like to see it kept in DEBUG mode\n. no special reason other than the existence of a global 'use strict' at the top is easier to verify. The directive itself is benign. If it's not the first statement in a file or a function it is ignored - so shouldn't affect single file case\u2013which incidentally will also need a global 'use strict' at the top.\n. yeah needs work - looking at it today\n. OK so it was partially working but triggers were not showing up. I've fixed this with https://github.com/twitter/flight/pull/90\n\nTo get logging to show up, the client app needs to enable debugging and mix logging into the registry. (In hindsight this may be asking a bit much of the client app - we should consider automating the second part if `debug.enable` is `true`). For example here's how its done in our demo app (https://github.com/twitter/flight/blob/gh-pages/demo/index.html)\n\n```\nfunction(compose, registry, advice, withLogging, debug) {\n  debug.enable(true);\n  compose.mixin(registry, [advice.withAdvice, withLogging]); \n  //.. \n }\n```\n\nThe next step is to persist user logging level requests with localStorage so that they endure beyond the current page\n. debug preferences now persisted\n. Yeah I got this too and I don't understand why. Tag v1.0.6 definitely has the right component.json\nhttps://github.com/twitter/flight/blob/v1.0.6/component.json.\n\nI ended up copying manually :(\nWill look into it some more\n. fixed after upgrade to v1.0.7\n. @danse Which version of firefox? The demo app makes copious use of this.trigger and works fine in FF19 (as does twitter.com) \n. sorry for the delay - will get to this soon\n. We shouldn't qualify event listening by instance data. If I subscribe to an event I want all events of that name, regardless of the instance which triggered it.\n. going to do this once I've used it to add tests to demo app\n. Code looks fine. Not sure how much demand there is for this util. @danwrong, @sayrer? \n. think it's easier just to have the component listen for an event and in the callback do `this.teardown()`\n. @mpelzsherman \n\nYes, each registry instance has an events property which is an array of all bound events.\ne.g.\n\n``` js\n//first binding of first element\nregistry.allInstances[0].events[0];\n//all bindings for instance with identity 23 \nregistry.allInstances.findInstanceInfo(23).events;\n//second binding for first instance attached to myElem\nregistry.allInstances.findInstanceInfoByNode(myElem)[0].events[1];\n```\n\nIf you want to debug from the console you can retrieve registry.allInstances like this (assuming you are using AMD syntax)\n\n``` js\nvar allInstances;\nrequire(['components/flight/lib/registry'], function(registry) {\n  allInstances = registry.allInstances;\n})\n```\n\nHope this helps.\n. excellent catch!\n. @rogeliog I ended up doing something similar and gave you an inspiration credit on the commit :)\n. second before should be an after\n. component_api talks about this.node so we should probably just link the first node reference to that\n. this is legacy - you can substitute `defaults` for `attr`\n. debug.js is not part of core - it's not required to make flight work\n. loadrunner has a plugin for it - however its not about loadrunner so much as whatever module loader flight clients are most likely to use - hence we went with amd\n. @danse I thnk defaultAttrs work - it's plural because its a collection of attr(ibutes)\nAgain I'd call it componentAttrs - assuming it can create more than one attr.\n. Oh I see your point. I do not have a good explanation for that inconsistency :)\n. @krava this is by design, see https://github.com/flightjs/flight/blob/master/doc/component_api.md#triggering-events (\"...the event payload which must always be an object\")\n. @wwwsevolod Added some tests to reproduce it - but the tests passed https://github.com/flightjs/flight/pull/147\nCan you give more specifics of how to reproduce? Thanks.\n. gut reaction is that this couples us a little more deeply to jquery, so I'm reticent\n. I'm doing this as part of 1.1.0 commit\n. all utils are linking to <a name=\"utils.compose\">\n. This is not a bug. It's chrome being forced to adopt the over zealous w3c CSP. FWIW there is no possible CSS loophole with `new Function()` when no args are passed because there is nowhere to inject a script.\n. The change is in master but not v1.1.0\n(git diff v1.1.0 -- lib/registry.js)\n\nWe'll make a new tag shortly and then bower will deploy with that update\n\n@angustweets\n\nOn Tue, Oct 8, 2013 at 2:56 PM, John Schulz notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> Has this change made it into the version available via bower install?

I think this will be expensive - there would be a slice, map, filter and join in every call to select. Given that this case seems quite rare it would be better to just define your attr with two selectors\n\nmenuTitleOrItemSelector: '.menu-title, .menu-item'\n. @olivierlesnicki `this` at the component scope refers to the component's prototype, so assigning a value there will apply to all instances. Similarly a var at the component level is available via closure scope to every instance. \n\nHowever `this` within a function refers only to the current instance, so typically you would declare an instance specific property in the initialize method:\n\ne.g.\n\n``` js\n  this.after('initialize', function() {\n    this.x = 'blah';\n    //...\n  });\n```\n\nthe property x will then be available to any component method and is instance specific.\n\nHope this helps.\n. messed this branch up, making a new PR\n. issue #160\n. On my phone so can't be certain but your proposed fix looks like it delegates the same callback to every event target - which would be wrong\n. Right (knew I shouldn't try and read it on my phone :))\n\nYes, this would more-or-less work (although blur and focus still wouldn't invoke the callback when triggered on elements that weren't covered by one of the delegateRule selectors - in contrast to the behavior for bubbling events).\n\nNot sure if always binding the event to this hybrid selector, instead of just the node (or specified), requires extra overhead on the part of jQuery (see http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.10.2&fn=jQuery.event.add). If it does, it might not be worth doing for the sake of these two edge cases. \n\nYou could also workaround delegation for blur and focus by using a hybrid selector in these cases only:\n\n`this.on(blurrableSelectors.join(','), 'blur', {/*delegateObj*/})` \n\nWill work on this more. Thanks for the input!\n.

Yes and I assumed that's what jQuery on (with delegates) would end up doing too because of the composite selector argument - i.e. the attached event handler would listen on any element matching the composite selector\n\nI may be wrong though - will check out jQuery.add when I'm on my computer. \n\nIn any case I suspect for non bubbling events jQuery is forced to do some awkward thing under the covers that would compromise true event delegation\n\nOn Sep 29, 2013, at 7:57, giuseppeg notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> I mean $element would be blurrableSelectors instead of this.node (or any other anchestor) meaning that you are actually binding to the target elements, am I wrong?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. The intention is that this should an error, period.

In fact isn't it cleaner to remove all handlers in one go at teardown?\n\nMoreover your solution is incomplete, we'd also need to add `one` advice methods to registry and logger. IMO keeping all binding in a single API (`on`) causes less confusion all around and keeps our codebase small. Also `one` and `once` are both very unintuitive names for an event binder - they don't suggest binding at all (just because jQuery did it doesn't make it right) \n\nLet's try and keep our API simple. The following is intuitive and adds nothing to our core code base (other than a reusable util)...\n\n`this.on('click', utils.once(myHandler))` \n. @necolas I think its fine as is no?\nAs long as we set `ran = true` after `if (ran) {return}` then it achieves the objective right?\n.

If we unbound both events in the first `off`, the second `off` would be left high and dry with nothing to do. Moreover there would be a danger of unbinding callbacks bound to other elements (but the same instance) even when such unbindings had not been requested.\n\n> > I'm also interested: could we not have iterated on my PR (with the big commit message + explanation) to this?\n\nWe could have iterated on your PR but the emphasis was different, yours was entirely focused on registry.js, this one is focused on base.js \n. yes I've used this pattern in other repos and like it (can even have an additional prop which stores any curried args). I hope ES6 adds this data to bound functions for free\n. could we go a step further and put  `if (window.DEBUG && window.DEBUG.enabled)` around the body of `withLogging`?\n. true\n. can you make it this style to be more consistent with other flight code?\n\n``` js\nif (info && info.instance) {\n  info.instance.teardown();\n}\n```\n.

Hi wwwsevold\n\njQuery special events are a fairly obscure feature and not commonly used. Rather than coupling flight further to jquery I'd prefer to let handlers (or where appropriate code the that calls trigger) deal with such things conditionally.\n. @phuu not sure we should document this - it's a legacy of pre-open source twitter code (for a specail case) and I hope we can get rid of it\n. can you make this \"2013-2014\" please - thanks\n. love this\n. thanks for putting these together @giuseppeg \n\nHowever I'm not sure either is quite what we want - the first solution, as you say is possibly too restrictive \u2014 if you did want to call the original function with other params, it is quite painful now.\n\nThe second solution might not be intuitive to people reading code that uses it - for example in your snippet we call the original function with  '5' - which the na\u00efve reader will probably now assume the only parameter passed.\n\nI agree it's a little gnarly to have to slice the arguments in consumer code in order to pass what we want to the original function, but hopefully these cases are fairly rare \n. yep travis issue looks like - bower install is failing\nwant to clean up a couple of things anyway - so not quite pull-ready \n. fixed travis issue (jquery-bower deploy path changed) and cleaned up code\n. @DKunin I quite like @giuseppeg's strategy - but to your original question - it really is a matter of taste. Flight tries not to be prescriptive - so if for some reason it made sense in your situation to generate markup on the client then that's perfectly fine too\n. Nice catch.\n\nI think \n`base.mixedIn = Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(base, 'mixedIn') ? base.mixedIn : [];`\n\nwould be a little cleaner / more explicit\n. @phuu \"Tearing down all components is very unlikely, and not particularly useful in a single page app.\" \n`teardownAll` only removes components instances for a give constructor, not all components\n\n@rlavoie it sounds like a more useful and cleaner solution to what you want is a `teardownAll` that takes an html node as an argument. With help from the registry it could teardown all component instances attached to  that node and any descendant nodes. The only headache is having a registry dictionary of instances keyed by node (since the key must be a string and we can't necessarily determine unique selectors programmatically). Of course once ES6 (maps, weakMaps) comes along that's no longer a problem.\n. @phuu cool look forward to seeing this!\n\nwas more trying addressing @rlavoie's specific problem with what could be a very simple solution requiring no component level references - but if you've covered that too, so much the better\n. want to land this, but trying to get travis to npm install without griping (not your fault)\n. Would you mind merging from master? (there was a karma peer dependency issue that was making travis fail) \n. thanks (I tweaked package.json). All good now\n. this fails travis with the same error I was getting - hence my change\n. Not in my opinion. `myComponent` is effectively a mixin too. I'd rather encourage devs to think about the order of precedence on a case by case basis\n. This is already noted at the beginning of the section: \"Flight will automatically bind the context (this) of the callback to the component instance\"\n. looks like we need to whitelist `attrDef` when write protecting. cc @danwrong \n. fixed in branch: attributes_in_debug.\nHowever looking at test failure in master before I PR\n. Fixed: https://github.com/flightjs/flight/pull/279\n. bear in mind that the eventPayload has to be an object - it's a string in your test. This might be the issue\n. The more I use flight, the more I see the value in binding to the document. I agree binding to anything between the node and the document (or body) feels a bit icky - but I don't see the point in being overly prescriptive.\n. If you use `this.select` you are always binding relative to the node, and this forces you to use the selectors defined by the attrs (hence DRY). If you go by this principle (never hard code a selector outside the attrs) then the only elements you can bind to outside the component node are `document` and `body` - both of which are reasonable bind targets. \n. @staeke can you clarify what you mean by \"outside users of your component\"?. Since attrs are declared/assigned defaults  within the component, they can only be overriden by either an `attachTo` argument or by a mixin (using the new attributes syntax). In both cases this overriding is probably by design. \n. looks good - as discussed. adding an issue to test `index.js`. We needed it before this, but these changes highlight it.\n\nSome apprehension about `defineComponent` -> `flight.component` in terms of lost descriptive power. But not sure I have a better solution right now.\n. @alexgorbatchev AFAIK it's still a WIP  \n. looks good\n. this is excellent - really like webpack\n. looking at this now (not forgotten it :)\n. I wouldn't mind seeing this split into 2 PRs. One for the per-instance callback removal and one for event namespacing (sure this wouldn't allow callback-less unbinds per instance, but I like to keep PRs single purpose)\n\nSo sthg like:\n\n``` js\n        if (callback) {\n          //this callback may be the original function or a bound version\n          var boundFunctions = callback.target ? callback.target.bound : callback.bound || [];\n          //set callback to version bound against this instance\n          boundFunctions && boundFunctions.some(function(fn, i, arr) {\n            if (fn.context && (this.identity == fn.context.identity)) {\n              arr.splice(i, 1);\n              callback = fn;\n              return true;\n            }\n          }, this);\n          $element.off(type, callback);\n        } else {\n          // Loop through the events of `this` instance\n          // and unbind using the callback\n          registry.findInstanceInfo(this).events.forEach(function (event) {\n            if (type == event.type) {\n              $element.off(type, event.callback);\n            }\n          });\n        }\n```\n\n@sayrer @alexgorbatchev, you see any perf concerns with the added overhead? (the `else` condition is new)\n. Since the regex is potentially expensive (compiling a new one for every callback-less off directive) how about we only go there if the event contains a dot?  \n. yeah sorry, getting kind of hard to follow this PR triangulation :)\n\nI guess I'll merge 282 and we can leave this one hanging pending further discussion on the merits of namespaced events. (FWIW I'm not against them, though its difficult to gauge the demand for them - as always we don't want to add code to core just to satisfy cases) \n. @sayrer and I put it behind the debug guard because we were concerned about perf. That's two extra function calls for every trigger, and there can be multiple triggers per click\n. Almost impossible to answer. What's the use case you need it for?\n. idea from @kloots: do a this.after('trigger', function() {//...});  \n. your component (just the regular advice pattern)\n. can you paste the code here?\n. @necolas In the pattern you are using it for I would create a `props` property to iterate over. Better to call it out explicitly than rely on data having the right thing (e.g., what if later _you_ wanted to add another payload item that was not to be iterated over\n\nSo\n`Object.keys(data.props).forEach(//..`\n\nnot\n`Object.keys(data).forEach(//..`\n. In what ways does having jQuery as a global hurt us? Several Twitter devs were pleased with the move to global jQuery because it made debugging a lot less gnarly\n. this might be reasonably easy - the registry (or whatever) would build up a selector-to-handler lookup for each event type and then, for each type call\n\n```\nthis.on(document, eventType, utils.delegate(\n  this.resolveDelegateRules(lookup)\n));\n```\n\nQuestion is do we scope every event delegate at the document level or would this be unnecessarily costly in the case of custom events? Or perhaps we could just do auto-delegation for native event types.\n. @simonsmith You don't need to attachTo document for the sake of event delegation, you can \n\n```\nthis.on(document, 'click', { followBtnSelector: this.followBtnClick });\n```\n\nThat said, if document is the most inner common element for your listeners, it suggests document might be your most appropriate component node. \n. this looks good on first scan - will look in detail tomorrow - thanks!\n. I like. Is there a risk that a flight client's legacy code might include function attrs that they didn't intend to be evaluated?\n. ah good point - ship it\n. ah - good point...sorry merged prematurely\n. could also simplify the code that calls it (in lib/base.js) - though it would still work as is\n. Thanks. So as not to break up the `this.select` description I think this would work better in parentheses at the bottom of the section (after the example code). Also I think `can` not `may` might be more accurate:\n\n> (You can access the component's node directly by using the component's node attribute. e.g. `this.node`.) \n. Thanks - yes could you squash the commits please.\n. Sure thing (cc @phuu) \n. @phuu whoops yes! thanks\n. If clobbering is detected in debug mode doesn't it throw an error? If it does than I think that's fine. If it doesn't then it should.\n. We should make it error (it used to). Unless no-one cares about clobbering (but they probably should)\n. yeah you right, idk. \n. @akre54 thanks for this. Will verify performance across browsers shortly.\n. @dilvie although the iframe thing can be dodgy for testing instanceof in the case of $ being passed between iframes, I think it's highly unlikely you'd be running flight in one frame and installing jquery in another\n\n@akre54 FWIW my tests show instance of to be slightly slower in chrome and significantly slower in firefox and IE. But I'm not really concerned about performance in either case. It's just not called often enough for 100,000 times per second to be considered a concern.\n\nIt would be nice if flight were decoupled from jQuery, but that is a huge project and this change would be the tip of the iceberg (actually that test might no longer even be required if we had no jQuery) \n. Thanks - will take a look. \nClosing since not an issue or bug\n. thanks! fixed\n. Not a bad idea - will consider this. Thanks!\n. pedantry welcome :) \n. current dependency is jquery 1.83 - will modify when upgrading to jquery 1.9\n. Removed $.browser reference\nsee https://github.com/twitter/flight/commit/4109c2d872d5fdb1ed057400d103766aaea97f98\n. after/before work on methods, not events.\n\nSo for example `this.after(\"initialize\", ...)` works because components get an empty `initialize` method by default.\n\nYou can get the desired effect by doing `this.before(\"handleTest\", ...)` \n. It's just for demo purposes. \n. this will make me happy too :)\n. es5-shim is using a symlink to map component.json to package.json - which seems to cause a problem for windows.\nsee https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/issues/751\n\nYou could try forking es5-shim and then just copy package.json into component.json \nfailing that I would manually copy es5-shim.js and es5-sham.js to components/es5-shim \n. thanks - fix pulled\n. thank you - nicely done\n. thank you!\n. How to Install is here https://github.com/twitter/flight#installation\nGeneral suggestions are good - will work on it.\n. @alex-seville @jamm see also https://github.com/twitter/flight/issues/19\n. thanks!\n. not duplicates: one is es5-shim, other is es5sham\n. Yes, by all means. Components are not defined in terms of DOM nodes, rather you attach an instance of a Component to one or more DOM nodes after it is defined. There is nothing to stop DOM node of one component instance being nested inside the DOM node of another.\n\nAre you having an issue with it?\n. actually its requirejs.js in component directory - but wrongly so\nwill make a new branch to fix both at once then merge\nthanks for the PR!\n. thanks!\n. Yes this is true - it appears to be a css issue rather than something directly related to flight or JavaScript so I figured we could live with it. (The icons are nested within disabled buttons - but for some reason are not themselves disabled)\n\nClosing as not an issue with flight itself\n. Hi \n\nSo each Block instance needs an attr value that specifies the DOM selector it should listen on, this can be done by passing a custom attr via attachTo.\n\nSo:\n\n```\nMenu.attachTo('#menu1');\nMenu.attachTo('#menu2');\nBlock.attachTo('#block1', {menuSelector: '#menu1'});\nBlock.attachTo('#block2', {menuSelector: '#menu1'});\n```\n\nThen in the Block component, let the listener know which selector to listen on (this is the optional first argument of component.on)\n\n```\nthis.on(this.attr.menuSelector, 'menuItemClicked', changeColor)\n```\n\nIf the new color is also customizable it should be sent as payload when 'menuItemClicked' is triggered by Menu\n\n```\nthis.trigger('menuItemClicked', {color:red});\n```\n\n(again if the color is instance specific it can be passed via `attachTo`)\n\nThis can be picked up by the data argument of the callback on Block \n\n```\nthis.changeColor(ev, data) {\n  $node.css({'color': data.color});\n}\n```\n\nHope this helps!          \n. I take your point about the coupling implications of being told to listen to events on specific DOM node - but I feel that returning a component as a handle so that it's methods can be invoked externally is a much tighter coupling. Once you make a component API available to the outside world the component is no longer isolated and you are inviting a ratcheting up of complexity.\n\nAlso bear in mind I am not suggesting listening to events from a specific component - just listening to any event emanating from a DOM node. It could originate from one of many components, or it could be a native DOM event - we don't care and we don't need to know.\n\nI don't know your DOM structure - but I'd also suggest you don't need to listen to the menu element specifically - as long as you listen on any DOM node that events from the other menu will not bubble up to.\n\nAlternatively (and perhaps most simply) just have the second menu trigger a different event name from the first menu.\n. thanks!\n. It works for me - what error are you seeing?\n. does f12 developer tools show an error message in the console?\nUpdate: OK I notice it fails in IE8 compatibility mode. Are you running IE9 in IE8 compatibility mode? Will fix this anyway. \n. Glad it worked\n\nI've just fixed for IE8 now. (https://github.com/twitter/flight/commit/116175d133)\nHaven't tested the demo app in IE7 - but flight framework should work in IE7\n. 1. Not yet.\n2. It would have worked as an AMD module too. For twitter.com we found having jQuery as a module made designing jQuery plugin modules unsatisfactory\n. thanks - pulling (but I'll follow with my own PR to put all parameter marshaling up front, and also add a test to make sure non function callbacks fail on the correct exception)\n. done: resolved merge conflicts manually\n. thanks!\n. We did this to discourage passing of functions between components. Allowing a component's functionality to be invoked, by proxy, elsewhere compromises the isolation of a function - making testing more tricky and inviting model complexity.\n\nYou can run with debug off if this is not a concern to you. Curious what your use case for passing a jQuery object is\n. No - the reason it is only forbidden in debug mode is so it is caught in development. We didn't want such tests in production because of inconsistent cross browser support and the additional (albeit slight) overhead of the postMessage.\n\nWas asking about passing jQuery object in case there was a good use case that we had overlooked. Disallowing non-serializable payloads was primarily targeted at discouraging function payloads - but I'm not seeing a good use case for passing jQuery objects either (not saying there isn't one - just not seeing one)\n. @simonsmith\u2014basically this https://github.com/twitter/flight/issues/38#issuecomment-13390278\nWe don't want to compromise the decoupling of components. Limiting their external object dependencies to simple hashes, primitives etc. keeps them detangled and easily testable.\n. many thanks for these - curiously demo worked for me in IE8 vmware\n. Hi Michal\n\nDid you try this?\n\n```\nthis.on(this.attr.inputSelector, 'blur', blurCb);\n```\n\n(you can specify the DOM node - or selector thereof - to attach the listener to).\nAlso, should be no need to bind the callback - flight ensures it gets bound to the component instance by default.\n\nHope this helps!\n. Ok - maybe I should wait for the demo - but to clarify (in case it helps) - if the callback argument is a function the binding happens immediately, but if its a hash the binding happens at event time (much like `live` or `delegate` in jQuery)\n\nI think, however, you already grasped this, since in your original example you were indeed passing a hash - and the problem is that blur just doesn't bubble up at all. Is there no way you can bind after the element is dynamically created?\n\nMaybe this is something we could look to fix in flight.\n. @cam-stitt Thanks, planning to do this!\nLooking forward to checking out the app\n. thanks!\n. @houfeng0707 actually `withDialog` is itself just a mixin, we're not interested in its prototype.  Instead we want `withPositioning` to be mixed into whatever `withDialog` is being mixed into - which is represented by `this`, i.e. the context in which `withDialog` is being invoked.\n\nBy way of example, imagine we have a Component type called `TweetBox` which is defined by mixing the core `tweetBox` function with the mixin `withDialog`: \n\n```\ndefineComponent(tweetBox, withDialog);\n\nfunction tweetBox() {//... \n```\n\nSo now when `withDialog` is being invoked using the original code you cited above, `this` is `TweetBox.prototype` and that's what both `withDialog` and `withPosition` will be mixed into.\n\nHope this helps. It probably sounds confusing in words, but once you play with the code it should become apparent. Please look at the [demoApp source code](https://github.com/twitter/flight/tree/gh-pages/demo) for more examples.\n. thanks!\n. Flight does not dictate how you should model your data or where your data model should live. That's your choice.\n\ntwitter.com generates HTML from server-side data models. Tweetdeck, on the other hand, uses client-side data modelling.\n\nThere is no requirement to use DOM data-attributes. \n. @tbrd this looks great - thanks!\n\nminor issues in run_tests.js:\n1) remove the loadrunner specific comments from the top\n2) either remove console.log of tests, or move unshift 'lib/component' to after console.log\n. you can do this by using \n\n```\nthis.after('<fnName>', function() {\n  //..\n});\n```\n\nsee https://github.com/twitter/flight#advice\n. yes, you can add a mixin to anything at anytime:\n\n```\ncompose.mixin(componentInstance, [arrayOfMixins]);\n```\n\nmake sure you import 'lib/compose'\n. @gbrits initialize is the only method guaranteed to be called by every component. Teardown is probably best managed by the client app\n. OK - just a heads up I'm planning to add a developer hook to `baseComponent`. Should be out in the next few days, but can't guarantee.\n. There's already an mixin called withBaseComponent which gets mixed into every component, but it's currently private within the scope of component.js. Might be a good idea to open this up so folks can add their own custom base behavior via before or after (see https://github.com/twitter/flight#advice). I'll look into it.\n\nIn the meantime I guess you could make a fork to either amend this mixin or add your own mixin here (see https://raw.github.com/twitter/flight/master/lib/component.js):\n\n```\n  // prepend common mixins to supplied list, then mixin all flavors\n  mixins.unshift(withBaseComponent, advice.withAdvice, registry.withRegistration);\n\n  compose.mixin(Component.prototype, mixins);\n```\n. @mkuklis the slice(3) is delightful :)\n\nI think @gbrits might be talking about a base component that all components will automatically extend - much as they extend `baseComponent` (internally) now.\n\nPlanning to add an external hook to `baseComponent` so that custom base code can be added by advice.\n. @fscz decorators (`after`, `before`, `around`) need to be called in the right sequence.\nYou need the `this.render` method to be in place before the `this.after('render', function() {})` decorator is invoked. The normal way to do this is to have base methods in the component and decorators in the mixin. So for example:\n\ncomponent\n\n```\nthis.render = function(ev,data) {\n  //base render functionality\n}\n```\n\nmixin\n\n```\nthis.after('render', function(ev,data) {\n  //extra decoration specific to the mixin\n});\n\nthis.after('initialize', function() {\n  //...\n  this.render(); //invokes render, including mixin's decoration\n}\n```\n\nHowever if the base `render` method does everything you want you don't need a decorator in the mixin. Also FWIW, if you had a decorator without a base `render` method it would still work - the decorator would, in this case, become the base `render` method\n\n(re-opening issue for a while as a general FYI)\n. @fscz hmm this should be working as you expect. When you do \n\n```\ndefineComponent(terminalComponent, withMemDB, withTemplate, withMedia);\n```\n\nthis creates one component containing all functions from all mixins. For your example to work it doesn't even matter which order the mixins are added (although they are, in fact, added in the order specified) because `initialize` is not called until you create an instance of the component (using `attachTo`)\n\nCan you post a simplified version of where you are defining the component and where you are doing `attachTo`? Thanks.\n\n(by the way you don't need to assign `this` to `self` in the `initialize` method)\n. @dannymidnight At twitter we have use a mixin that supplies an ajax wrapper. Instead of defining success and error callbacks, the wrapper defines success and error events, which will be auto-triggered with the ajax response.\n\nMaybe this may be the level of abstraction you're really looking for?\n. @simonsmith there's quite a lot of twitter specific stuff going on too, but in a nutshell, you pass the event names to the wrapper, which uses a helper method to make them into success/error callbacks which are then passed to the appropriate slots in the ajax call.\n. The optional first element specifies which DOM node you will listen for the event on. If it's not supplied it defaults to (as you say) the element you attach(ed)To \n. Easiest way would be to use `around` and only invoke original function if validation passes\n\n``` js\nthis.around('submit', function(originalSubmit) {\n  if (validates()) {\n    originalSubmit();\n  }\n}\n```\n. thanks! - fixed\n. @kevinrobinson this is one of those situations that can never be quite perfect. Yes it would be nice if the mixin could define a \"default default\"\u2014the problem is how do we know the developer's intention. It's possible that the mixin defines an `attr` with the same name purely by accident\u2014we don't want a situation where some mixins cannot be used with some components because of accidental name clashes. Similarly we can't assume the base `attr` always wins\u2014if it clobbers a mixin attribute that was intended for an entirely different purpose the mixin stops working.\n\nBottom line, we can't second guess the developer's intention, and we can't fail (or succeed) silently.\n. closing, see https://github.com/twitter/flight/pull/68\n. you can use http://api.jquery.com/selector/\n. Add a comment to explain why you building arguments array longhand\n. definitely add a comment to explain why you are building arguments array longhand.\n. you now have two successive this.on implementations\n.

If it's not the first statement in a file or a function it is ignored - so shouldn't affect single file case\u2013which incidentally will also need a global 'use strict' at the top.\n. yeah needs work - looking at it today\n. OK so it was partially working but triggers were not showing up. I've fixed this with https://github.com/twitter/flight/pull/90\n\nTo get logging to show up, the client app needs to enable debugging and mix logging into the registry. (In hindsight this may be asking a bit much of the client app - we should consider automating the second part if `debug.enable` is `true`). For example here's how its done in our demo app (https://github.com/twitter/flight/blob/gh-pages/demo/index.html)\n\n```\nfunction(compose, registry, advice, withLogging, debug) {\n  debug.enable(true);\n  compose.mixin(registry, [advice.withAdvice, withLogging]); \n  //.. \n }\n```\n\nThe next step is to persist user logging level requests with localStorage so that they endure beyond the current page\n. debug preferences now persisted\n. Yeah I got this too and I don't understand why. Tag v1.0.6 definitely has the right component.json\nhttps://github.com/twitter/flight/blob/v1.0.6/component.json.\n\nI ended up copying manually :(\nWill look into it some more\n. fixed after upgrade to v1.0.7\n. @danse Which version of firefox? The demo app makes copious use of this.trigger and works fine in FF19 (as does twitter.com) \n. sorry for the delay - will get to this soon\n. We shouldn't qualify event listening by instance data. If I subscribe to an event I want all events of that name, regardless of the instance which triggered it.\n. going to do this once I've used it to add tests to demo app\n. Code looks fine. Not sure how much demand there is for this util. @danwrong, @sayrer? \n. think it's easier just to have the component listen for an event and in the callback do `this.teardown()`\n. @mpelzsherman \n\nYes, each registry instance has an events property which is an array of all bound events.\ne.g.\n\n``` js\n//first binding of first element\nregistry.allInstances[0].events[0];\n//all bindings for instance with identity 23 \nregistry.allInstances.findInstanceInfo(23).events;\n//second binding for first instance attached to myElem\nregistry.allInstances.findInstanceInfoByNode(myElem)[0].events[1];\n```\n\nIf you want to debug from the console you can retrieve registry.allInstances like this (assuming you are using AMD syntax)\n\n``` js\nvar allInstances;\nrequire(['components/flight/lib/registry'], function(registry) {\n  allInstances = registry.allInstances;\n})\n```\n\nHope this helps.\n. excellent catch!\n. @rogeliog I ended up doing something similar and gave you an inspiration credit on the commit :)\n. second before should be an after\n. component_api talks about this.node so we should probably just link the first node reference to that\n. this is legacy - you can substitute `defaults` for `attr`\n. debug.js is not part of core - it's not required to make flight work\n. loadrunner has a plugin for it - however its not about loadrunner so much as whatever module loader flight clients are most likely to use - hence we went with amd\n. @danse I thnk defaultAttrs work - it's plural because its a collection of attr(ibutes)\nAgain I'd call it componentAttrs - assuming it can create more than one attr.\n. Oh I see your point. I do not have a good explanation for that inconsistency :)\n. @krava this is by design, see https://github.com/flightjs/flight/blob/master/doc/component_api.md#triggering-events (\"...the event payload which must always be an object\")\n. @wwwsevolod Added some tests to reproduce it - but the tests passed https://github.com/flightjs/flight/pull/147\nCan you give more specifics of how to reproduce? Thanks.\n. gut reaction is that this couples us a little more deeply to jquery, so I'm reticent\n. I'm doing this as part of 1.1.0 commit\n. all utils are linking to <a name=\"utils.compose\">\n. This is not a bug. It's chrome being forced to adopt the over zealous w3c CSP. FWIW there is no possible CSS loophole with `new Function()` when no args are passed because there is nowhere to inject a script.\n. The change is in master but not v1.1.0\n(git diff v1.1.0 -- lib/registry.js)\n\nWe'll make a new tag shortly and then bower will deploy with that update\n\n@angustweets\n\nOn Tue, Oct 8, 2013 at 2:56 PM, John Schulz notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> Has this change made it into the version available via bower install?

I think this will be expensive - there would be a slice, map, filter and join in every call to select. Given that this case seems quite rare it would be better to just define your attr with two selectors\n\nmenuTitleOrItemSelector: '.menu-title, .menu-item'\n. @olivierlesnicki `this` at the component scope refers to the component's prototype, so assigning a value there will apply to all instances. Similarly a var at the component level is available via closure scope to every instance. \n\nHowever `this` within a function refers only to the current instance, so typically you would declare an instance specific property in the initialize method:\n\ne.g.\n\n``` js\n  this.after('initialize', function() {\n    this.x = 'blah';\n    //...\n  });\n```\n\nthe property x will then be available to any component method and is instance specific.\n\nHope this helps.\n. messed this branch up, making a new PR\n. issue #160\n.

Yes and I assumed that's what jQuery on (with delegates) would end up doing too because of the composite selector argument - i.e. the attached event handler would listen on any element matching the composite selector\n\nI may be wrong though - will check out jQuery.add when I'm on my computer. \n\nIn any case I suspect for non bubbling events jQuery is forced to do some awkward thing under the covers that would compromise true event delegation\n\nOn Sep 29, 2013, at 7:57, giuseppeg notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> I mean $element would be blurrableSelectors instead of this.node (or any other anchestor) meaning that you are actually binding to the target elements, am I wrong?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n.

In fact isn't it cleaner to remove all handlers in one go at teardown?\n\nMoreover your solution is incomplete, we'd also need to add `one` advice methods to registry and logger. IMO keeping all binding in a single API (`on`) causes less confusion all around and keeps our codebase small. Also `one` and `once` are both very unintuitive names for an event binder - they don't suggest binding at all (just because jQuery did it doesn't make it right) \n\nLet's try and keep our API simple. The following is intuitive and adds nothing to our core code base (other than a reusable util)...\n\n`this.on('click', utils.once(myHandler))` \n. @necolas I think its fine as is no?\nAs long as we set `ran = true` after `if (ran) {return}` then it achieves the objective right?\n. I made a stab at something which may be cleaner and more efficient\n\nhttps://github.com/flightjs/flight/pull/191\n\nBasically you don't assign guid to the callback until just before unbind\n(its not needed before then).

Hi wwwsevold\n\njQuery special events are a fairly obscure feature and not commonly used. Rather than coupling flight further to jquery I'd prefer to let handlers (or where appropriate code the that calls trigger) deal with such things conditionally.\n. @phuu not sure we should document this - it's a legacy of pre-open source twitter code (for a specail case) and I hope we can get rid of it\n. can you make this \"2013-2014\" please - thanks\n. love this\n. thanks for putting these together @giuseppeg \n\nHowever I'm not sure either is quite what we want - the first solution, as you say is possibly too restrictive \u2014 if you did want to call the original function with other params, it is quite painful now.\n\nThe second solution might not be intuitive to people reading code that uses it - for example in your snippet we call the original function with  '5' - which the na\u00efve reader will probably now assume the only parameter passed.\n\nI agree it's a little gnarly to have to slice the arguments in consumer code in order to pass what we want to the original function, but hopefully these cases are fairly rare \n. yep travis issue looks like - bower install is failing\nwant to clean up a couple of things anyway - so not quite pull-ready \n. fixed travis issue (jquery-bower deploy path changed) and cleaned up code\n. @DKunin I quite like @giuseppeg's strategy - but to your original question - it really is a matter of taste. Flight tries not to be prescriptive - so if for some reason it made sense in your situation to generate markup on the client then that's perfectly fine too\n. Nice catch.\n\nI think \n`base.mixedIn = Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(base, 'mixedIn') ? base.mixedIn : [];`\n\nwould be a little cleaner / more explicit\n. @phuu \"Tearing down all components is very unlikely, and not particularly useful in a single page app.\" \n`teardownAll` only removes components instances for a give constructor, not all components\n\n@rlavoie it sounds like a more useful and cleaner solution to what you want is a `teardownAll` that takes an html node as an argument. With help from the registry it could teardown all component instances attached to  that node and any descendant nodes. The only headache is having a registry dictionary of instances keyed by node (since the key must be a string and we can't necessarily determine unique selectors programmatically). Of course once ES6 (maps, weakMaps) comes along that's no longer a problem.\n. @phuu cool look forward to seeing this!\n\nwas more trying addressing @rlavoie's specific problem with what could be a very simple solution requiring no component level references - but if you've covered that too, so much the better\n. want to land this, but trying to get travis to npm install without griping (not your fault)\n. Would you mind merging from master? (there was a karma peer dependency issue that was making travis fail) \n. thanks (I tweaked package.json). All good now\n. this fails travis with the same error I was getting - hence my change\n. Not in my opinion. `myComponent` is effectively a mixin too. I'd rather encourage devs to think about the order of precedence on a case by case basis\n. This is already noted at the beginning of the section: \"Flight will automatically bind the context (this) of the callback to the component instance\"\n. looks like we need to whitelist `attrDef` when write protecting. cc @danwrong \n. fixed in branch: attributes_in_debug.\nHowever looking at test failure in master before I PR\n. Fixed: https://github.com/flightjs/flight/pull/279\n. bear in mind that the eventPayload has to be an object - it's a string in your test. This might be the issue\n. The more I use flight, the more I see the value in binding to the document. I agree binding to anything between the node and the document (or body) feels a bit icky - but I don't see the point in being overly prescriptive.\n. If you use `this.select` you are always binding relative to the node, and this forces you to use the selectors defined by the attrs (hence DRY). If you go by this principle (never hard code a selector outside the attrs) then the only elements you can bind to outside the component node are `document` and `body` - both of which are reasonable bind targets. \n. @staeke can you clarify what you mean by \"outside users of your component\"?. Since attrs are declared/assigned defaults  within the component, they can only be overriden by either an `attachTo` argument or by a mixin (using the new attributes syntax). In both cases this overriding is probably by design. \n. looks good - as discussed. adding an issue to test `index.js`. We needed it before this, but these changes highlight it.\n\nSome apprehension about `defineComponent` -> `flight.component` in terms of lost descriptive power. But not sure I have a better solution right now.\n. @alexgorbatchev AFAIK it's still a WIP  \n. looks good\n. this is excellent - really like webpack\n. looking at this now (not forgotten it :)\n. I wouldn't mind seeing this split into 2 PRs. One for the per-instance callback removal and one for event namespacing (sure this wouldn't allow callback-less unbinds per instance, but I like to keep PRs single purpose)\n\nSo sthg like:\n\n``` js\n        if (callback) {\n          //this callback may be the original function or a bound version\n          var boundFunctions = callback.target ? callback.target.bound : callback.bound || [];\n          //set callback to version bound against this instance\n          boundFunctions && boundFunctions.some(function(fn, i, arr) {\n            if (fn.context && (this.identity == fn.context.identity)) {\n              arr.splice(i, 1);\n              callback = fn;\n              return true;\n            }\n          }, this);\n          $element.off(type, callback);\n        } else {\n          // Loop through the events of `this` instance\n          // and unbind using the callback\n          registry.findInstanceInfo(this).events.forEach(function (event) {\n            if (type == event.type) {\n              $element.off(type, event.callback);\n            }\n          });\n        }\n```\n\n@sayrer @alexgorbatchev, you see any perf concerns with the added overhead? (the `else` condition is new)\n. Since the regex is potentially expensive (compiling a new one for every callback-less off directive) how about we only go there if the event contains a dot?  \n. yeah sorry, getting kind of hard to follow this PR triangulation :)\n\nI guess I'll merge 282 and we can leave this one hanging pending further discussion on the merits of namespaced events. (FWIW I'm not against them, though its difficult to gauge the demand for them - as always we don't want to add code to core just to satisfy cases) \n. @sayrer and I put it behind the debug guard because we were concerned about perf. That's two extra function calls for every trigger, and there can be multiple triggers per click\n. Almost impossible to answer. What's the use case you need it for?\n. idea from @kloots: do a this.after('trigger', function() {//...});  \n. your component (just the regular advice pattern)\n. can you paste the code here?\n. @necolas In the pattern you are using it for I would create a `props` property to iterate over. Better to call it out explicitly than rely on data having the right thing (e.g., what if later _you_ wanted to add another payload item that was not to be iterated over\n\nSo\n`Object.keys(data.props).forEach(//..`\n\nnot\n`Object.keys(data).forEach(//..`\n. In what ways does having jQuery as a global hurt us? Several Twitter devs were pleased with the move to global jQuery because it made debugging a lot less gnarly\n. this might be reasonably easy - the registry (or whatever) would build up a selector-to-handler lookup for each event type and then, for each type call\n\n```\nthis.on(document, eventType, utils.delegate(\n  this.resolveDelegateRules(lookup)\n));\n```\n\nQuestion is do we scope every event delegate at the document level or would this be unnecessarily costly in the case of custom events? Or perhaps we could just do auto-delegation for native event types.\n. @simonsmith You don't need to attachTo document for the sake of event delegation, you can \n\n```\nthis.on(document, 'click', { followBtnSelector: this.followBtnClick });\n```\n\nThat said, if document is the most inner common element for your listeners, it suggests document might be your most appropriate component node. \n. this looks good on first scan - will look in detail tomorrow - thanks!\n. I like. Is there a risk that a flight client's legacy code might include function attrs that they didn't intend to be evaluated?\n. ah good point - ship it\n. ah - good point...sorry merged prematurely\n. could also simplify the code that calls it (in lib/base.js) - though it would still work as is\n. Thanks. So as not to break up the `this.select` description I think this would work better in parentheses at the bottom of the section (after the example code). Also I think `can` not `may` might be more accurate:\n\n> (You can access the component's node directly by using the component's node attribute. e.g. `this.node`.) \n. Thanks - yes could you squash the commits please.\n. Sure thing (cc @phuu) \n. @phuu whoops yes! thanks\n. If clobbering is detected in debug mode doesn't it throw an error? If it does than I think that's fine. If it doesn't then it should.\n. We should make it error (it used to). Unless no-one cares about clobbering (but they probably should)\n. yeah you right, idk. \n.

    "mkuklis": "looks like it's green :)\n. Hi Angus,\n\nThank you for the fast feedback. I think your suggestion works when the input element is already attached to the root node of the component. In my situation these input elements are being attached dynamically after the binding happens.\n\nThe reason I used bind on the callback with `this.$node.on` was because `on` in this situation comes from jQuery and I was loosing component context.\n\nSorry for taking your time on this. I think I will try to create a demo somewhere so it will be easier to illustrate my problem.\n. @angus-c as you mentioned the `blur` just doesn't bubble up at all. I don't think this an issue related to binding to not existing/dynamically created element.\n\n@giuseppeg I'm going to try `focusout` later today. it's an interesting idea.  \n. @giuseppeg it looks like the `focusout` worked for me. Thank you for the suggestion! This is how it looks like now:\n\n``` js\nthis.on('focusout', { 'editSelector': this.requestUpdate });\n```\n. @giuseppeg thanks! @danwrong mentioned that jQuery has a support for `focusout` in Firefox and other browsers. I just tested it in Firefox and it looks like it works fine.\n. Hi @OscarGodson I'm not sure if this will be helpful/useful but you could take a look at the setup here:\n\nhttps://github.com/addyosmani/todomvc/blob/gh-pages/dependency-examples/flight/app/js/data/todos.js\n\nthe todo app is using localStorage (depot.js)\n\nhttps://github.com/addyosmani/todomvc/blob/gh-pages/dependency-examples/flight/app/js/store.js\n\nbut you could replace it with your own store (for example xhr store which interacts with the server etc).\n. @OscarGodson I think the beauty of the Flight framework is that you can structure your code the way you like it. \n@angus-c and @danwrong talk a little bit about the philosophy behind it [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/twitter-flight/Y8k4oO3dRgA/lKn9Gdtn0hsJ) and [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/twitter-flight/Y8k4oO3dRgA/TueTezwKjQQJ). \n\nI like your approach as well. I think it means you would need multiple instances of the TodoUI component (one per todo) like you suggested.   \n\nI've started experimenting with the idea of the [asComponent](https://gist.github.com/mkuklis/5002179) mixin with  a default set of CRUD event types which could be used with different data providers (localStorage, xhr etc). There could be potentially another mixin on the view side of things to bind to these events.

Another bonus is that one doesn't have to worry about the order of dependencies between `define` and the callback. \n. looks like it's green :)\n. Hi Angus,\n\nThank you for the fast feedback. I think your suggestion works when the input element is already attached to the root node of the component. In my situation these input elements are being attached dynamically after the binding happens.\n\nThe reason I used bind on the callback with `this.$node.on` was because `on` in this situation comes from jQuery and I was loosing component context.\n\nSorry for taking your time on this. I think I will try to create a demo somewhere so it will be easier to illustrate my problem.\n. @angus-c as you mentioned the `blur` just doesn't bubble up at all. I don't think this an issue related to binding to not existing/dynamically created element.\n\n@giuseppeg I'm going to try `focusout` later today. it's an interesting idea.  \n. @giuseppeg it looks like the `focusout` worked for me. Thank you for the suggestion! This is how it looks like now:\n\n``` js\nthis.on('focusout', { 'editSelector': this.requestUpdate });\n```\n. @giuseppeg thanks! @danwrong mentioned that jQuery has a support for `focusout` in Firefox and other browsers. I just tested it in Firefox and it looks like it works fine.\n. Hi @OscarGodson I'm not sure if this will be helpful/useful but you could take a look at the setup here:\n\nhttps://github.com/addyosmani/todomvc/blob/gh-pages/dependency-examples/flight/app/js/data/todos.js\n\nthe todo app is using localStorage (depot.js)\n\nhttps://github.com/addyosmani/todomvc/blob/gh-pages/dependency-examples/flight/app/js/store.js\n\nbut you could replace it with your own store (for example xhr store which interacts with the server etc).\n. @OscarGodson I think the beauty of the Flight framework is that you can structure your code the way you like it. \n@angus-c and @danwrong talk a little bit about the philosophy behind it [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/twitter-flight/Y8k4oO3dRgA/lKn9Gdtn0hsJ) and [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/twitter-flight/Y8k4oO3dRgA/TueTezwKjQQJ). \n\nI like your approach as well. I think it means you would need multiple instances of the TodoUI component (one per todo) like you suggested.   \n\nI've started experimenting with the idea of the [asComponent](https://gist.github.com/mkuklis/5002179) mixin with  a default set of CRUD event types which could be used with different data providers (localStorage, xhr etc). There could be potentially another mixin on the view side of things to bind to these events.

The ComponentInitializer will search for uninitialized Flight components within a given DOM node, and initializes them automatically.\n\nBut before the components are initialized, I want to trigger a \"before initialization event\" so that other (existing) components have the ability to process/modify the DOM node (the context) before the Flight components within it are initialized.

    "giuseppeg": "@angus-c wouldn't focusout(*) solve his issue? If I understood correctly he is experiencing an event bubbling issue.\nThe jQuery version works because of a workaround https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L682\n\n(*) which, ok, is not supported in some browsers like gecko iirc\n. @mkuklis great! \n\nAnyway take in mind that `focusout` is not supported by Firefox (Gecko). ([see the browser compatibility table on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla_event_reference/focusout#Browser_compatibility))\n\nAnother way of implementing event delegation for the `blur` event is by setting the `useCapture` parameter of `addEventListener` to `true`:\n\n``` javascript\ndocument.addEventListener('blur', function (event) {\n    console.dir(event.target);\n}, true);\n```\n. @mkuklis Yep, so did I in my second-last comment.\n\njQuery simulates the event delegation creating a _special event_ for each element, plus _a single capturing handler_ that is attached to the ancestor actually :)\n\nAwesome implementation of _todomvc_ by the way!\n. @BugiDev in v1.1.4 you will be able to extend existing base components see https://github.com/flightjs/flight/commit/ffaeb88ce268ebaca253b61d14f1d3b55a9bb4cd\n. @angus-c agreed.\nI am just evaluating the pros and cons of having a selectors object in order to avoid the Selector prefix/suffix.\n\n``` javascript\nthis.defaultAttrs({\n    fooSelector: \".foo\",\n    barSelector: \".bar\"\n    baz: true\n});\n```\n\nvs\n\n``` javascript\nthis.defaultAttrs({\n    selectors: {\n        foo: \".foo\",\n        bar: \".bar\"\n    },\n    baz: true\n});\n```\n\nAnd trying to find a standard way to deal with Selectors and Classnames that are the same.\nRight now that's what I do:\n\n``` javascript\nthis.defaultAttrs({\n    foo: \".foo\",\n});\n/* ... */\nthis.select('foo');\n/* ... */\nthis.$elem.addClass(this.attr.foo.slice(1));\n```\n\nI think that we can close the Issue, but I would like to know your thoughts on this.\n. I think that you could just mention that it works like the jQuery on does\n. My bad, I realized that after a chat with a guy in the bower irc channel\n. Because those events do not bubble up the document tree, and as far as I understood Flight's delegate doesn't use the jQuery's one (which can capture those \"normalized events\").\nIf you don't care about gecko based browsers (Firefox) you can listen for `focusin` and `focusout`.\nHopefully they will look into this issue at some point :)\n. `this.$node.on('focus', this.attr.inputSelector, this.emailFocused);` \nshould work too (see http://jsfiddle.net/2Panx/)\n\nBy the way you can capture those events by setting the addEventListener's useCapture argument value to true (IE>8). You may want to read [Delegating the focus and blur events](http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2008/04/delegating_the.html) \n. @wwwsevolod correct.\nThat could be fixed tho:\n\n``` javascript\nvar instanceInfo = flight.registry.findInstanceInfo(this); \n\nif (instanceInfo) {\n    instanceInfo.events.push({\n        callback: this.doSomething,\n        element: this.node,\n        type: 'focus'\n    });\n\n    this.$node.on('focus', this.attr.inputSelector, this.doSomething.bind(this));\n}\n```\n\nQuite dirty and hacky if you want, but it should work. Obviously we need a neat, native working solution.\nI'll see if I can come up with a fix next week when I'll be back from vacations.\n\nCheers\nG.\n. Here is a quick fix:\nhttps://gist.github.com/giuseppeg/6612820\n\nAt this point `utils.delegate` does some unnecessary work, and its logic should be changed a bit.\nI would like to hear what the Flight's team members think about this.\n. how so?\nThe callback (event handler) is a function produced by utils.delegate which will make sure that the correct callback is called.\nhttps://github.com/flightjs/flight/blob/master/lib/utils.js#L217\n. > although blur and focus still wouldn't invoke the callback when triggered on elements that weren't covered by one of the delegateRule selectors - in contrast to the behavior for bubbling events\n\nThat's fine I guess.\n\n> Not sure if always binding the event to this hybrid selector, instead of just the node (or specified), requires extra overhead on the part of jQuery (see http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.10.2&fn=jQuery.event.add). If it does, it might not be worth doing for the sake of these two edge cases.\n\nYeah that requires some investigation/tests.\n\"Delegated events that use more complex selectors, particularly hierarchical ones, can be several times slower--although they are still fast enough for most applications.\" obviously.\n\n> You could also workaround delegation for blur and focus by using a hybrid selector in these cases only:\n> \n> `this.on(blurrableSelectors.join(','), 'blur', {/*delegateObj*/})`\n\nThis wouldn't be event delegation anymore.\n. You know what, I have an idea.\nI think that we could easily fix it mapping `focus` and `blur` to `focusin` and `focusout`.\n\n``` javascript\nvar special = {\n    focus: 'focusin',\n    blur: 'focusout'\n};\n\ntype = type.replace(new RegExp(Object.keys(special).join('|'), 'ig'), function (evt) {\n    if (special[evt]) {\n        return special[evt];\n    }\n});\n```\n. I mean `$element` would be `blurrableSelectors` instead of `this.$node` (or any other anchestor) meaning that you are actually binding to the target elements, am I wrong?\n. @necolas yeah, I think so.\n. While I think that is good to have an utility like `once`, I would like to point out that a such method doesn't remove event handlers after the first execution of the fn.\nBy the way jQuery calls it `one`.\n\nMy proposal: https://gist.github.com/giuseppeg/7020843\n. @angus-c because it keeps listening for that event and handling it when we actually don't need it anymore.\n\nThat said, I am fine with the util solution :)\n. @wwwsevolod a solution that involves events namespacing would be weak and unsafe imho.\nAngus' solution looks great although I share [phuu's thoughts](https://github.com/flightjs/flight/pull/189#issuecomment-26916735)\n. You can dispatch the event to other DOM nodes eg. `this.trigger(document, 'foo')` exposing the namespace (component id) to other instances/components.\nIn fact you can get the namespace form `jQueryEvent.handleObj.namespace`\n\nwth am I saying? this is totally wrong! \nPlease forgive me, I am tired :)\n. If you do so you will be able to trigger events only to the component's descentants.\nTherefore something like `this.trigger(document, 'foo', data)` wouldn't work.\n\nTry this:\n\n``` javascript\nthis.defaultAttrs({\n  childSelector: '.child'\n});\n```\n\n`this.trigger(this.select('childSelector'), 'click');`\n. @angus-c not if you `console.dir(eventData)` !?\nIt would be cool to have tabular data in certain cases i.e. use `console.table` but this should be disabled by default.\n. I'd personally go for the solution suggested by @angus-c on the google group\n\n<blockquote>For your specific problem you'd be better off using a variable or a component property (`var list = []` or `this.list = []`) since there is no instance specific value that you need to pass thru in the attachTo</blockquote>\n\nIf you still want to deep clone... you could use a mixin like this: \nhttps://gist.github.com/giuseppeg/8516790 \n\nYou can see it in action here http://jsfiddle.net/dBM6K/2/\n\nps. the `.bind(this)` at line 14 is not needed (my bad) :)\n. @caryfitzhugh I don't think you need an external utility for cloning.\nAnyway I'd wait for other opinions on my suggestion.\n\nYou may want to bring the discussion to the IRC channel for a quick response.\n. <blockquote>Returns <b>new object</b> representing multiple objects merged together. Optional <b>final argument</b> is boolean which specifies if merge is recursive. Original objects are <b>unmodified</b>.</blockquote>\n\nBasically `utils.merge` is a wrapper for jQuery's `extend` that always merge the Objects into a brand new one.\n\nSo if you pass a single Object and true (deepCopy) it actually clone it.\n. I hear you @angus-c. Thanks for sharing your opinion.\n\nHowever I have a few objections to make:\n\n<blockquote>for example in your snippet we call the original function with '5' - which the na\u00efve reader will probably now assume the only parameter passed</blockquote>\n\nThat's true but it is not a big deal in my opinion. He/she will probably use only the new parameters and ignore the rest.\n\nI can't imagine why one would invoke `existingFuncName` without the original parameters. In fact the developer may want to wrap `existingFuncName` without changing its behaviour.\n\nOn the other hand I see the inconsistency. We would call `existingFuncName()` without parameters but in fact we are passing them behind the scenes.\n\nThat said, I think that the best thing to do is to just mention this somewhere in the docs.\nIf you agree we can close this issue.\n. It doesn't. It supports IE 7+\nProgressive enhancement ftw\n. Hi @DKunin \n\nYes, data components should only deal with data - fetch/prepare/broadcast.\n\nhere is what I would do (which is similar to what you described):\n- compile and dump your templates as json string in a file (templateName - template pairs)\n- make those templates global or pass them to the page (eg. app/page/default.js) when you boot/initialize it (on app/main.js)\n- create a mixin that you can use with UI components. It exposes a render method/interface to the template engine\n- when you attach the UI component to DOM elements you pass a template from the `templates` object like this \n\n``` javascript\nFoo.attachTo(document.body, {\n    fooTpl: templates.foo\n});\n```\n- that you can render later\n\n``` javascript\nthis.dataReceived = function (event, data) {\n    var tpl = this.render(this.attr.fooTpl, data);\n    this.$node.append(tpl);\n};\n```\n\nIf you want to decouple you could create a UI component that would act as renderer (like a network printer). It would hold all the tempaltes and any UI component could ask it to render a `templateName` with some `data`. Here you'd have to deal with the event ownership issue. Also the UI component should know the `templateName` in advance.\nOverall the latter adds more complexity and I am not sure whether it is an optimal solution.\n. @tbrd are those top level variables (the one holded in the mixin definition scope) shared across the component instances or does each instance get a copy of them? Shared right?\n. I actually prefer Github issues, the UI is clean and I get notifications via email which I can label, filter, search.\n\nWhat if you guys create a custom label for support questions / other topics here on Github?\n\nIRC is great as well, actually I would love to see people joining the IRC channel to ask questions or just to chat in general :)\n\nGoogle groups are a bit messy and Facebook is just for branding/exposure imho.\n. There is no such thing as collections in Flight. \nIn fact <blockquote>Components do not engage each other directly</blockquote>\n\nIn order to do what you propose, one can write mixins and pack(compose) them in a component.\neg.\n\n``` javascript\nreturn defineComponent(Overlay, withDialog, withDrag, withKeyboardNav, withWhatever);\n```\n. @tbrd Yeah something like this I guess https://gist.github.com/giuseppeg/9638666\n. @tbrd that's correct and I thought of that issue while I was writing that example. \nObviously the best way to do it would be to look for child nodes that have a component instance attached to them.\n\n@phuu I haven't had such need so far :)\n. @tbrd that would teardown them all.\n@rlavoie  in that case you could modify the gist I posted before. Just change the condition to something like\n`if (component.attr.teardown) { component.teardown(); }` or `!component.attr.teardown` as you prefer.\n\nOh and instead of using advice, convert it to a function eg `this.awesomeTeardown = function () {};`.\n. If I understand correctly you want to do event delegation in Flight.\nThis is documented on the base api docs - [3rd example](https://github.com/flightjs/flight/blob/master/doc/base_api.md#this.on)\n. Remember that you are using the Flight `on` method not the jQuery one.\nYour line of code translates to `$('input').on('blur', this.handler);`\nSo each input gets two event handlers (or as many as your instances are).\n\nYou should use [event delegation](https://github.com/flightjs/flight/blob/master/doc/base_api.md#thisonselector-eventtype-handler) here. See the [example](http://jsbin.com/facoraqe/1/edit).\n. I may have a solution for this issue, the idea is simple: we always unbind using the callback (we have it in the registry afterall).\n\nBefore I do further tests, write actual tests and submit a PR, I would like to ask for your feedback @staeke @phuu @angus-c @danwrong @kennethkufluk \n\nhttps://gist.github.com/giuseppeg/2611a50416443bf6d375\nand the [diff](https://gist.github.com/giuseppeg/2611a50416443bf6d375/revisions)\n. Yep, because `proxyEventTo` returns a function\n. Yes they do because it only loops through the current instance events.\nImproved it a bit so it unbinds namespaced events too [[diff](https://gist.github.com/giuseppeg/2611a50416443bf6d375/revisions)]\n. @phuu #283 matches jQuery's behaviour by using the [regular expression from jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L19) to add namespace support.\n. The jQuery's `on` signature is slightly different, and it would be worth mentioning that Flight's api != jQuery's one.\nBecause of the similarities people don't read the doc and get confused imho (I did the same mistake at the beginning).\n\nOften times event delegation is really what you want to do. Personally I've never bound to `this.select('descendants')`.\n\n@staeke is right when he says that a component shouldn't be able to query the DOM like that, and maybe it would be nice to allow it to select only a subset of it eg. window, document, html, head, body, link, meta, script etc. but that's OT\n. Makes sense.\nPer instance callback removal is now #282 \nNamespace events is now #283\n. If we merge #280 we are halfway to the solution I guess\n. Correct, I need that commit to add namespace support.\n. Good idea, that should work.\n@angus-c after #264 I wonder if we still want to add namespaces support\n. No problem and sorry for the mess :)\nPersonally I haven't had the need to use namespaced events so far :)\nI agree with you and I am concerned about performances too - it is bad that we have to do the same thing that jQuery does later (test against the regex).\n. Why would you do that?\nYou may want to do something like this:\n\nUI component:\n\n``` javascript\nthis.on('dataFetched', this.consumeData);\nthis.trigger('uiSomething'/* , optionalData */);\n```\n\nData component:\n\n``` javascript\nthis.fetchData = function (event, data) {\n  // do request... and on success trigger dataFetched with the responsedata\n  this.trigger('dataFetched', responseData);\n};\n\nthis.on('uiSomething', this.fetchData);\n```\n. Oops @varontron replied while I was writing my comment :p \nAnyway if you still want to do that you can do this:\n\n``` javascript\nthis.trigger('dataRequested', {\n  callback: function(data) {\n     // use data here\n  }.bind(this)\n});\n```\n\nbut that's silly imho\n. You could use unique ids on your components to determine event ownership.\n\n``` html\n<div class=\"myComponent\" data-guid=\"tweet-123456\"></div>\n```\n\nIDs are server side generated in a [deterministic way](http://code.logos.com/blog/2011/04/generating_a_deterministic_guid.html) (eg. type-id)\nThe UI component gets the responseData (containing the ID) from the data component.\n\n``` javascript\nthis.consumeData = function (event, data) {\n   if (!data.GUID || data.GUID != this.$node.attr(\"data-guid\")) {\n      return;\n   }\n};\n```\n\nThis check could be part of a mixin actually that you can use with advice's before like this:\n\n``` javascript\nthis.on('dataFetched', this.before('consumeData', this.checkForEventOwnership));\n```\n. We kind of discussed this once https://github.com/flightjs/flight/pull/199/files\nHowever it is still there. Also I am no 100% sure that what @angus-c said is correct (have to test it)\n`e.delegateTarget` would be `document` while `e.currentTarget` should be the correct one?\n. @simonsmith attachTo the closest common parent. In the tweets example it could be the timeline.\n`event.currentTarget` is a reference to the dom element within the event bubbling phase (your button).\n. <blockquote>event.currentTarget is a reference to the dom element within the event bubbling phase (your button)</blockquote>\n\nerr this is not true in Flight (it is in jQuery though)\n. @simonsmith it's not the same thing. Anyway we are off-topic here.\n. +1\n. @BugiDev no. You already have `this.node` though\n. @nkzawa it'll return a `NodeList` I suppose that you can still convert to a jQuery object if you decide to use jQuery in your project\n. @nkzawa it should be fairly easy to use `advice` to write a withJQuery mixin.\n\n``` javascript\nfunction withJQuery() {\n  // define this.$node\n  this.after('initialize', function () {\n    this.$node = $(this.node);\n  });\n\n  // wrapper for select to return jQuery objects\n  this.around('select', function (select) {\n    return $(select([].slice.call(arguments, -1)));\n  });\n}\n```\n\nThat you can manually mix with a component:\n\n``` javascript\n// Must be the first mixin\nvar MyComponent = flight.component(withJQuery, function () {});\n```\n\nOr we could decide to hook into the registry and do that automatically for you.\n. @phuu you can close this I guess\n. @angus-c you may want to take a look at #237 too\n. sure go ahead\n. @phuu I guess we can. Let's see what the other people think about it.\n. sure np\n. Those events [don't bubble](http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/mouseover.html). You may want to try with mouseover/mouseout. See #178 too.\n. This may be not that straightforward, because all we have is a function (the rules live in its closure).\nhttps://github.com/flightjs/flight/blob/master/lib/utils.js#L235\n. @phuu @danwrong if you make it public (push to a dev branch) we could fork/help.\n. @phuu +1 on this, your proposal sg2m too.\n. Wouldn't this go against the principle of separation of concerns?\n\n<blockquote>Flight enforces strict separation of concerns. When you create a component you don't get a handle to it. Consequently, components cannot be referenced by other components and cannot become properties of the global object tree. This is by design. Components do not engage each other directly</blockquote>\n\nWhat would happen when\n- the child component is torn down\n- your try to do something with the instance\n\n@tbrd with events instead the child components teardown themselves in case they are still around\n. @phuu I hear you but that's one of the best features of flight in my opinion.\nMaybe we can improve `withChildComponents` to solve some of those problems.\n\nFor example we could add a `children registry` where we store some info about children components,\npush stuff on it when we use `this.attachChild` and have `this.attachChild` return a `ChildComponent` object that exposes the API you suggested ie. you get instance info only from `this.attachChild` instead of `Component.attachTo`.\n\n`this.attachChild` would mix an object in the child component so that after teardown we can remove the child from the parent's registry.\n`ChildComponent` would have access to the children registry of course.\n\n<s>I also suggest to introduce a new concept of `RootComponent|ComponentsGroup|FlightSquares` :) or something like that so that people understand that components that get withChildComponents are just a common place where you can organise the subtree and establish those relationships - at yelp we call them `controllers`</s> (see comment below)\n. <s>The other day I realized that the idea above is implemented in Deku (a component-based framework from Segment). They call these things Scene(s) https://github.com/segmentio/deku/wiki/Scene-API</s>\nThis is not a thing anymore, Scenes are normal components in the tree.\n. Would it make more sense to try es6 classes first (and [mixins](https://gist.github.com/sebmarkbage/fac0830dbb13ccbff596)) and see how goes?\n\nEither ways I would like to add the sugar! Let's just agree on which one we like the most.\n. Yeah we could have a flag on `attributes` say `strictmode` to disable the strict checks introduced by this method. In this way `defaultAttrs` would only be a proxy fn to `attributes` with `strictmode: false`\n. flight-toolbox++\n. @ZhihaoJia that's correct. \nThe old `this.defaultAttrs` would fail when the second mixin had an attribute already defined on the previous mixins:\n\n<blockquote>Uncaught Error: utils.push attempted to overwrite \"wantsCookies\" while running in protected mode</blockquote>\n\n[When](https://github.com/flightjs/flight/commit/6932361fdf62e02b3a8dd87c33bd54edf91c1963) the docs were updated Nicolas forgot to invert the order I guess.\n\nHere is the [relevant code](https://github.com/flightjs/flight/blob/master/lib/base.js#L247)\n. @phuu I'd say lets improve the current docs first, maybe starting by adding more examples. We can turn them into a Jekyll site in no time later.\n\nGood examples could be:\n- managing the lifecycle of a group of components in a page\n- PJAX-ing with flight\n- integration with Boostrap\n\nIn general FAQ kind of articles.\n. @phillip-haydon I am ok with that although I think that keeping the docs in the same repo is better for a simple reason: when you tag a new release the docs reflect that version state.\n\nAlso people can contribute with pull requests already, although that's not as straightforward as editing a wiki :)\n. I think we have two options here:\n\n1) we start to polyfill a whole bunch of stuff (not too excited about this)\n2) we suggest to use or we find a way to bundle [FT's polyfills](http://cdn.polyfill.io) with flight - no tests required form our end\n\nhttp://git.io/vO3gc\n. sg2m, we'll have to figure out how to make standalone builds from their repo and maybe deploy it in a separate repo under the flightjs org. Would you keep es5-shim or should we include its shims in the Flight bundle?\n\nbtw yes they have polyfills for all the \u00b1 new features, CustomEvent included.\n. I like that :shipit: \n. Hey Tom, count on me if you need some project management help and want to speed up the v2 release + occasional code contributions.\n. @phuu https://github.com/flightjs/flight/issues/368 let me know if you need further info.\n. @phuu my understanding is that trigger is broken when you fire with an event object \u2013 [relevant code](https://github.com/flightjs/flight/blob/master/lib/base.js#L100-L115).\n\nConsider this:\n\n``` javascript\nthis.trigger(document, { type: \"click\" });\n```\n\nHere's what happens step by step:\n\n``` javascript\nvar element, type, data, event;\nvar lastIndex = arguments.length - 1, lastArg = arguments[lastIndex];\n\n// lastIndex == 1\n// lastArg == { type: \"click\" }\n\nif (typeof lastArg != 'string') { // evaluates to true\n    lastIndex--;\n    data = lastArg;\n}\n\n// lastIndex == 0\n\nif (lastIndex == 1) { // evaluates to false\n    element = dom.select(arguments[0]);\n    event = arguments[1];\n} else {\n    element = this.node;\n    event = arguments[0];\n}\n\n// element == this.node instead of `document`\n// event == document instead of `{ type: \"click\" }`\n```\n. @phuu I was thinking that maybe I can split this PR in two and we can merge the `select[All]` fix for now and fix `tigger` later.\n\nIf you agree what do you think about my suggestion to remove `document` and `window` from the `selectorShortcut`s and add `html`? This mean that `dom.select('document')` for example won't work anymore... I don't see why you would use `dom.select` to select `document` or `window` :)\n. @phuu no problem, thank you guys for open sourcing the framework in the first place :)\n. weird it should throw in strict mode\n. The framework is fairly mature and stable. \n\nIn the meantime new frameworks came up with excellent ideas like declarative UIs, vdom and many others - @phuu [wrote about this](https://phuu.net/2016/09/26/flight-in-2016.html) recently. Implementing those into flight in my opinion would mean write a new and totally different framework.\n\nWhile I still love Flight, I think that the declarative UI and mono directional data flow pattern of React is a bit more practical and efficient.\n. @angus-c wouldn't focusout(*) solve his issue? If I understood correctly he is experiencing an event bubbling issue.\nThe jQuery version works because of a workaround https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L682\n\n(*) which, ok, is not supported in some browsers like gecko iirc\n. @mkuklis great! \n\nAnyway take in mind that `focusout` is not supported by Firefox (Gecko). ([see the browser compatibility table on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla_event_reference/focusout#Browser_compatibility))\n\nAnother way of implementing event delegation for the `blur` event is by setting the `useCapture` parameter of `addEventListener` to `true`:\n\n``` javascript\ndocument.addEventListener('blur', function (event) {\n    console.dir(event.target);\n}, true);\n```\n. @mkuklis Yep, so did I in my second-last comment.\n\njQuery simulates the event delegation creating a _special event_ for each element, plus _a single capturing handler_ that is attached to the ancestor actually :)\n\nAwesome implementation of _todomvc_ by the way!\n. @BugiDev in v1.1.4 you will be able to extend existing base components see https://github.com/flightjs/flight/commit/ffaeb88ce268ebaca253b61d14f1d3b55a9bb4cd\n. @angus-c agreed.\nI am just evaluating the pros and cons of having a selectors object in order to avoid the Selector prefix/suffix.\n\n``` javascript\nthis.defaultAttrs({\n    fooSelector: \".foo\",\n    barSelector: \".bar\"\n    baz: true\n});\n```\n\nvs\n\n``` javascript\nthis.defaultAttrs({\n    selectors: {\n        foo: \".foo\",\n        bar: \".bar\"\n    },\n    baz: true\n});\n```\n\nAnd trying to find a standard way to deal with Selectors and Classnames that are the same.\nRight now that's what I do:\n\n``` javascript\nthis.defaultAttrs({\n    foo: \".foo\",\n});\n/* ... */\nthis.select('foo');\n/* ... */\nthis.$elem.addClass(this.attr.foo.slice(1));\n```\n\nI think that we can close the Issue, but I would like to know your thoughts on this.\n. I think that you could just mention that it works like the jQuery on does\n. My bad, I realized that after a chat with a guy in the bower irc channel\n. Because those events do not bubble up the document tree, and as far as I understood Flight's delegate doesn't use the jQuery's one (which can capture those \"normalized events\").\nIf you don't care about gecko based browsers (Firefox) you can listen for `focusin` and `focusout`.\nHopefully they will look into this issue at some point :)\n. `this.$node.on('focus', this.attr.inputSelector, this.emailFocused);` \nshould work too (see http://jsfiddle.net/2Panx/)\n\nBy the way you can capture those events by setting the addEventListener's useCapture argument value to true (IE>8). You may want to read [Delegating the focus and blur events](http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2008/04/delegating_the.html) \n. @wwwsevolod correct.\nThat could be fixed tho:\n\n``` javascript\nvar instanceInfo = flight.registry.findInstanceInfo(this); \n\nif (instanceInfo) {\n    instanceInfo.events.push({\n        callback: this.doSomething,\n        element: this.node,\n        type: 'focus'\n    });\n\n    this.$node.on('focus', this.attr.inputSelector, this.doSomething.bind(this));\n}\n```\n\nQuite dirty and hacky if you want, but it should work. Obviously we need a neat, native working solution.\nI'll see if I can come up with a fix next week when I'll be back from vacations.\n\nCheers\nG.\n. Here is a quick fix:\nhttps://gist.github.com/giuseppeg/6612820\n\nAt this point `utils.delegate` does some unnecessary work, and its logic should be changed a bit.\nI would like to hear what the Flight's team members think about this.\n. how so?\nThe callback (event handler) is a function produced by utils.delegate which will make sure that the correct callback is called.\nhttps://github.com/flightjs/flight/blob/master/lib/utils.js#L217\n. > although blur and focus still wouldn't invoke the callback when triggered on elements that weren't covered by one of the delegateRule selectors - in contrast to the behavior for bubbling events\n\nThat's fine I guess.\n\n> Not sure if always binding the event to this hybrid selector, instead of just the node (or specified), requires extra overhead on the part of jQuery (see http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.10.2&fn=jQuery.event.add). If it does, it might not be worth doing for the sake of these two edge cases.\n\nYeah that requires some investigation/tests.\n\"Delegated events that use more complex selectors, particularly hierarchical ones, can be several times slower--although they are still fast enough for most applications.\" obviously.\n\n> You could also workaround delegation for blur and focus by using a hybrid selector in these cases only:\n> \n> `this.on(blurrableSelectors.join(','), 'blur', {/*delegateObj*/})`\n\nThis wouldn't be event delegation anymore.\n. You know what, I have an idea.\nI think that we could easily fix it mapping `focus` and `blur` to `focusin` and `focusout`.\n\n``` javascript\nvar special = {\n    focus: 'focusin',\n    blur: 'focusout'\n};\n\ntype = type.replace(new RegExp(Object.keys(special).join('|'), 'ig'), function (evt) {\n    if (special[evt]) {\n        return special[evt];\n    }\n});\n```\n. I mean `$element` would be `blurrableSelectors` instead of `this.$node` (or any other anchestor) meaning that you are actually binding to the target elements, am I wrong?\n. @necolas yeah, I think so.\n. While I think that is good to have an utility like `once`, I would like to point out that a such method doesn't remove event handlers after the first execution of the fn.\nBy the way jQuery calls it `one`.\n\nMy proposal: https://gist.github.com/giuseppeg/7020843\n. @angus-c because it keeps listening for that event and handling it when we actually don't need it anymore.\n\nThat said, I am fine with the util solution :)\n. @wwwsevolod a solution that involves events namespacing would be weak and unsafe imho.\nAngus' solution looks great although I share [phuu's thoughts](https://github.com/flightjs/flight/pull/189#issuecomment-26916735)\n. You can dispatch the event to other DOM nodes eg. `this.trigger(document, 'foo')` exposing the namespace (component id) to other instances/components.\nIn fact you can get the namespace form `jQueryEvent.handleObj.namespace`\n\nwth am I saying? this is totally wrong! \nPlease forgive me, I am tired :)\n. If you do so you will be able to trigger events only to the component's descentants.\nTherefore something like `this.trigger(document, 'foo', data)` wouldn't work.\n\nTry this:\n\n``` javascript\nthis.defaultAttrs({\n  childSelector: '.child'\n});\n```\n\n`this.trigger(this.select('childSelector'), 'click');`\n. @angus-c not if you `console.dir(eventData)` !?\nIt would be cool to have tabular data in certain cases i.e. use `console.table` but this should be disabled by default.\n. I'd personally go for the solution suggested by @angus-c on the google group\n\n<blockquote>For your specific problem you'd be better off using a variable or a component property (`var list = []` or `this.list = []`) since there is no instance specific value that you need to pass thru in the attachTo</blockquote>\n\nIf you still want to deep clone... you could use a mixin like this: \nhttps://gist.github.com/giuseppeg/8516790 \n\nYou can see it in action here http://jsfiddle.net/dBM6K/2/\n\nps. the `.bind(this)` at line 14 is not needed (my bad) :)\n. @caryfitzhugh I don't think you need an external utility for cloning.\nAnyway I'd wait for other opinions on my suggestion.\n\nYou may want to bring the discussion to the IRC channel for a quick response.\n. <blockquote>Returns <b>new object</b> representing multiple objects merged together. Optional <b>final argument</b> is boolean which specifies if merge is recursive. Original objects are <b>unmodified</b>.</blockquote>\n\nBasically `utils.merge` is a wrapper for jQuery's `extend` that always merge the Objects into a brand new one.\n\nSo if you pass a single Object and true (deepCopy) it actually clone it.\n. I hear you @angus-c. Thanks for sharing your opinion.\n\nHowever I have a few objections to make:\n\n<blockquote>for example in your snippet we call the original function with '5' - which the na\u00efve reader will probably now assume the only parameter passed</blockquote>\n\nThat's true but it is not a big deal in my opinion. He/she will probably use only the new parameters and ignore the rest.\n\nI can't imagine why one would invoke `existingFuncName` without the original parameters. In fact the developer may want to wrap `existingFuncName` without changing its behaviour.\n\nOn the other hand I see the inconsistency. We would call `existingFuncName()` without parameters but in fact we are passing them behind the scenes.\n\nThat said, I think that the best thing to do is to just mention this somewhere in the docs.\nIf you agree we can close this issue.\n. It doesn't. It supports IE 7+\nProgressive enhancement ftw\n. Hi @DKunin \n\nYes, data components should only deal with data - fetch/prepare/broadcast.\n\nhere is what I would do (which is similar to what you described):\n- compile and dump your templates as json string in a file (templateName - template pairs)\n- make those templates global or pass them to the page (eg. app/page/default.js) when you boot/initialize it (on app/main.js)\n- create a mixin that you can use with UI components. It exposes a render method/interface to the template engine\n- when you attach the UI component to DOM elements you pass a template from the `templates` object like this \n\n``` javascript\nFoo.attachTo(document.body, {\n    fooTpl: templates.foo\n});\n```\n- that you can render later\n\n``` javascript\nthis.dataReceived = function (event, data) {\n    var tpl = this.render(this.attr.fooTpl, data);\n    this.$node.append(tpl);\n};\n```\n\nIf you want to decouple you could create a UI component that would act as renderer (like a network printer). It would hold all the tempaltes and any UI component could ask it to render a `templateName` with some `data`. Here you'd have to deal with the event ownership issue. Also the UI component should know the `templateName` in advance.\nOverall the latter adds more complexity and I am not sure whether it is an optimal solution.\n. @tbrd are those top level variables (the one holded in the mixin definition scope) shared across the component instances or does each instance get a copy of them? Shared right?\n. I actually prefer Github issues, the UI is clean and I get notifications via email which I can label, filter, search.\n\nWhat if you guys create a custom label for support questions / other topics here on Github?\n\nIRC is great as well, actually I would love to see people joining the IRC channel to ask questions or just to chat in general :)\n\nGoogle groups are a bit messy and Facebook is just for branding/exposure imho.\n. There is no such thing as collections in Flight. \nIn fact <blockquote>Components do not engage each other directly</blockquote>\n\nIn order to do what you propose, one can write mixins and pack(compose) them in a component.\neg.\n\n``` javascript\nreturn defineComponent(Overlay, withDialog, withDrag, withKeyboardNav, withWhatever);\n```\n. @tbrd Yeah something like this I guess https://gist.github.com/giuseppeg/9638666\n. @tbrd that's correct and I thought of that issue while I was writing that example. \nObviously the best way to do it would be to look for child nodes that have a component instance attached to them.\n\n@phuu I haven't had such need so far :)\n. @tbrd that would teardown them all.\n@rlavoie  in that case you could modify the gist I posted before. Just change the condition to something like\n`if (component.attr.teardown) { component.teardown(); }` or `!component.attr.teardown` as you prefer.\n\nOh and instead of using advice, convert it to a function eg `this.awesomeTeardown = function () {};`.\n. If I understand correctly you want to do event delegation in Flight.\nThis is documented on the base api docs - [3rd example](https://github.com/flightjs/flight/blob/master/doc/base_api.md#this.on)\n. Remember that you are using the Flight `on` method not the jQuery one.\nYour line of code translates to `$('input').on('blur', this.handler);`\nSo each input gets two event handlers (or as many as your instances are).\n\nYou should use [event delegation](https://github.com/flightjs/flight/blob/master/doc/base_api.md#thisonselector-eventtype-handler) here. See the [example](http://jsbin.com/facoraqe/1/edit).\n. I may have a solution for this issue, the idea is simple: we always unbind using the callback (we have it in the registry afterall).\n\nBefore I do further tests, write actual tests and submit a PR, I would like to ask for your feedback @staeke @phuu @angus-c @danwrong @kennethkufluk \n\nhttps://gist.github.com/giuseppeg/2611a50416443bf6d375\nand the [diff](https://gist.github.com/giuseppeg/2611a50416443bf6d375/revisions)\n. Yep, because `proxyEventTo` returns a function\n. Yes they do because it only loops through the current instance events.\nImproved it a bit so it unbinds namespaced events too [[diff](https://gist.github.com/giuseppeg/2611a50416443bf6d375/revisions)]\n. @phuu #283 matches jQuery's behaviour by using the [regular expression from jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L19) to add namespace support.\n. The jQuery's `on` signature is slightly different, and it would be worth mentioning that Flight's api != jQuery's one.\nBecause of the similarities people don't read the doc and get confused imho (I did the same mistake at the beginning).\n\nOften times event delegation is really what you want to do. Personally I've never bound to `this.select('descendants')`.\n\n@staeke is right when he says that a component shouldn't be able to query the DOM like that, and maybe it would be nice to allow it to select only a subset of it eg. window, document, html, head, body, link, meta, script etc. but that's OT\n. Makes sense.\nPer instance callback removal is now #282 \nNamespace events is now #283\n. If we merge #280 we are halfway to the solution I guess\n. Correct, I need that commit to add namespace support.\n. Good idea, that should work.\n@angus-c after #264 I wonder if we still want to add namespaces support\n. No problem and sorry for the mess :)\nPersonally I haven't had the need to use namespaced events so far :)\nI agree with you and I am concerned about performances too - it is bad that we have to do the same thing that jQuery does later (test against the regex).\n. Why would you do that?\nYou may want to do something like this:\n\nUI component:\n\n``` javascript\nthis.on('dataFetched', this.consumeData);\nthis.trigger('uiSomething'/* , optionalData */);\n```\n\nData component:\n\n``` javascript\nthis.fetchData = function (event, data) {\n  // do request... and on success trigger dataFetched with the responsedata\n  this.trigger('dataFetched', responseData);\n};\n\nthis.on('uiSomething', this.fetchData);\n```\n. Oops @varontron replied while I was writing my comment :p \nAnyway if you still want to do that you can do this:\n\n``` javascript\nthis.trigger('dataRequested', {\n  callback: function(data) {\n     // use data here\n  }.bind(this)\n});\n```\n\nbut that's silly imho\n. You could use unique ids on your components to determine event ownership.\n\n``` html\n<div class=\"myComponent\" data-guid=\"tweet-123456\"></div>\n```\n\nIDs are server side generated in a [deterministic way](http://code.logos.com/blog/2011/04/generating_a_deterministic_guid.html) (eg. type-id)\nThe UI component gets the responseData (containing the ID) from the data component.\n\n``` javascript\nthis.consumeData = function (event, data) {\n   if (!data.GUID || data.GUID != this.$node.attr(\"data-guid\")) {\n      return;\n   }\n};\n```\n\nThis check could be part of a mixin actually that you can use with advice's before like this:\n\n``` javascript\nthis.on('dataFetched', this.before('consumeData', this.checkForEventOwnership));\n```\n. We kind of discussed this once https://github.com/flightjs/flight/pull/199/files\nHowever it is still there. Also I am no 100% sure that what @angus-c said is correct (have to test it)\n`e.delegateTarget` would be `document` while `e.currentTarget` should be the correct one?\n. @simonsmith attachTo the closest common parent. In the tweets example it could be the timeline.\n`event.currentTarget` is a reference to the dom element within the event bubbling phase (your button).\n. <blockquote>event.currentTarget is a reference to the dom element within the event bubbling phase (your button)</blockquote>\n\nerr this is not true in Flight (it is in jQuery though)\n. @simonsmith it's not the same thing. Anyway we are off-topic here.\n. +1\n. @BugiDev no. You already have `this.node` though\n. @nkzawa it'll return a `NodeList` I suppose that you can still convert to a jQuery object if you decide to use jQuery in your project\n. @nkzawa it should be fairly easy to use `advice` to write a withJQuery mixin.\n\n``` javascript\nfunction withJQuery() {\n  // define this.$node\n  this.after('initialize', function () {\n    this.$node = $(this.node);\n  });\n\n  // wrapper for select to return jQuery objects\n  this.around('select', function (select) {\n    return $(select([].slice.call(arguments, -1)));\n  });\n}\n```\n\nThat you can manually mix with a component:\n\n``` javascript\n// Must be the first mixin\nvar MyComponent = flight.component(withJQuery, function () {});\n```\n\nOr we could decide to hook into the registry and do that automatically for you.\n. @phuu you can close this I guess\n. @angus-c you may want to take a look at #237 too\n. sure go ahead\n. @phuu I guess we can. Let's see what the other people think about it.\n. sure np\n. Those events [don't bubble](http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/mouseover.html). You may want to try with mouseover/mouseout. See #178 too.\n. This may be not that straightforward, because all we have is a function (the rules live in its closure).\nhttps://github.com/flightjs/flight/blob/master/lib/utils.js#L235\n. @phuu @danwrong if you make it public (push to a dev branch) we could fork/help.\n. @phuu +1 on this, your proposal sg2m too.\n. Wouldn't this go against the principle of separation of concerns?\n\n<blockquote>Flight enforces strict separation of concerns. When you create a component you don't get a handle to it. Consequently, components cannot be referenced by other components and cannot become properties of the global object tree. This is by design. Components do not engage each other directly</blockquote>\n\nWhat would happen when\n- the child component is torn down\n- your try to do something with the instance\n\n@tbrd with events instead the child components teardown themselves in case they are still around\n. @phuu I hear you but that's one of the best features of flight in my opinion.\nMaybe we can improve `withChildComponents` to solve some of those problems.\n\nFor example we could add a `children registry` where we store some info about children components,\npush stuff on it when we use `this.attachChild` and have `this.attachChild` return a `ChildComponent` object that exposes the API you suggested ie. you get instance info only from `this.attachChild` instead of `Component.attachTo`.\n\n`this.attachChild` would mix an object in the child component so that after teardown we can remove the child from the parent's registry.\n`ChildComponent` would have access to the children registry of course.\n\n<s>I also suggest to introduce a new concept of `RootComponent|ComponentsGroup|FlightSquares` :) or something like that so that people understand that components that get withChildComponents are just a common place where you can organise the subtree and establish those relationships - at yelp we call them `controllers`</s> (see comment below)\n. <s>The other day I realized that the idea above is implemented in Deku (a component-based framework from Segment). They call these things Scene(s) https://github.com/segmentio/deku/wiki/Scene-API</s>\nThis is not a thing anymore, Scenes are normal components in the tree.\n. Would it make more sense to try es6 classes first (and [mixins](https://gist.github.com/sebmarkbage/fac0830dbb13ccbff596)) and see how goes?\n\nEither ways I would like to add the sugar! Let's just agree on which one we like the most.\n. Yeah we could have a flag on `attributes` say `strictmode` to disable the strict checks introduced by this method. In this way `defaultAttrs` would only be a proxy fn to `attributes` with `strictmode: false`\n. flight-toolbox++\n. @ZhihaoJia that's correct. \nThe old `this.defaultAttrs` would fail when the second mixin had an attribute already defined on the previous mixins:\n\n<blockquote>Uncaught Error: utils.push attempted to overwrite \"wantsCookies\" while running in protected mode</blockquote>\n\n[When](https://github.com/flightjs/flight/commit/6932361fdf62e02b3a8dd87c33bd54edf91c1963) the docs were updated Nicolas forgot to invert the order I guess.\n\nHere is the [relevant code](https://github.com/flightjs/flight/blob/master/lib/base.js#L247)\n. @phuu I'd say lets improve the current docs first, maybe starting by adding more examples. We can turn them into a Jekyll site in no time later.\n\nGood examples could be:\n- managing the lifecycle of a group of components in a page\n- PJAX-ing with flight\n- integration with Boostrap\n\nIn general FAQ kind of articles.\n. @phillip-haydon I am ok with that although I think that keeping the docs in the same repo is better for a simple reason: when you tag a new release the docs reflect that version state.\n\nAlso people can contribute with pull requests already, although that's not as straightforward as editing a wiki :)\n. I think we have two options here:\n\n1) we start to polyfill a whole bunch of stuff (not too excited about this)\n2) we suggest to use or we find a way to bundle [FT's polyfills](http://cdn.polyfill.io) with flight - no tests required form our end\n\nhttp://git.io/vO3gc\n. sg2m, we'll have to figure out how to make standalone builds from their repo and maybe deploy it in a separate repo under the flightjs org. Would you keep es5-shim or should we include its shims in the Flight bundle?\n\nbtw yes they have polyfills for all the \u00b1 new features, CustomEvent included.\n. I like that :shipit: \n. Hey Tom, count on me if you need some project management help and want to speed up the v2 release + occasional code contributions.\n. @phuu https://github.com/flightjs/flight/issues/368 let me know if you need further info.\n. @phuu my understanding is that trigger is broken when you fire with an event object \u2013 [relevant code](https://github.com/flightjs/flight/blob/master/lib/base.js#L100-L115).\n\nConsider this:\n\n``` javascript\nthis.trigger(document, { type: \"click\" });\n```\n\nHere's what happens step by step:\n\n``` javascript\nvar element, type, data, event;\nvar lastIndex = arguments.length - 1, lastArg = arguments[lastIndex];\n\n// lastIndex == 1\n// lastArg == { type: \"click\" }\n\nif (typeof lastArg != 'string') { // evaluates to true\n    lastIndex--;\n    data = lastArg;\n}\n\n// lastIndex == 0\n\nif (lastIndex == 1) { // evaluates to false\n    element = dom.select(arguments[0]);\n    event = arguments[1];\n} else {\n    element = this.node;\n    event = arguments[0];\n}\n\n// element == this.node instead of `document`\n// event == document instead of `{ type: \"click\" }`\n```\n. @phuu I was thinking that maybe I can split this PR in two and we can merge the `select[All]` fix for now and fix `tigger` later.\n\nIf you agree what do you think about my suggestion to remove `document` and `window` from the `selectorShortcut`s and add `html`? This mean that `dom.select('document')` for example won't work anymore... I don't see why you would use `dom.select` to select `document` or `window` :)\n. @phuu no problem, thank you guys for open sourcing the framework in the first place :)\n. weird it should throw in strict mode\n. The framework is fairly mature and stable. \n\nIn the meantime new frameworks came up with excellent ideas like declarative UIs, vdom and many others - @phuu [wrote about this](https://phuu.net/2016/09/26/flight-in-2016.html) recently. Implementing those into flight in my opinion would mean write a new and totally different framework.\n\nWhile I still love Flight, I think that the declarative UI and mono directional data flow pattern of React is a bit more practical and efficient.\n.

This http://jsfiddle.net/ZB6En/ is an example of the problem. \nI have replaced Flight's proxy for jQuery's, since the problem is not caused by Flight's delegation.\n\njQuery removes all listeners, since the handles are not unique, neither are their GUIDs.\nAdding a namespace to the event type will solve this, see: http://jsfiddle.net/vM9JS/1 ( fn called twice ).\n\nSince the delegation still works without the namespace, I don't see it breaking code.\n. @Dan, I have to remember what the exact cause of the issue was again.

    "kevinrobinson": "@angus-c Thanks for the explanation!\n\nAs for developer intention, I think the way you've defined the semantics of `#defaultAttr` is really clear, and there isn't any guesswork necessary; the rule is that the base `attr` always wins.  If an attribute has already been provided (when the component was instantiated, by the component itself, or by another mixin), then no need to use the default.  From the readme:\n\n```\nThe defaultAttr method is available to both component and mixin modules.\nWhen used with mixins it will not overwrite attributes already defined in the component module.\n```\n\nBy throwing an exception instead, it forces mixin authors to choose whether they want to define defaults themselves or allow consuming components to define their own defaults.\n\nYeah, if the mixin defines a default that accidentally collides with a component or other mixin, it would definitely be a problem.  But I think the ordering there is backwards for normal development.  If I'm writing a component and I want to use a mixin, I need to see which attributes that mixin uses so that I can pass arguments to it and so I can avoid name collisions.  Right now, I can't see that in the `with_select` mixin other than reading through the function bodies.  Allowing `defaultAttr` in mixins would make that a bit better.\n\nSince you've written substantially more Flight code than I have, I'm sure you have much better perspective here and I'm thankful to hear how you think about it.  :)\n. @angus-c Thanks for the explanation!\n\nAs for developer intention, I think the way you've defined the semantics of `#defaultAttr` is really clear, and there isn't any guesswork necessary; the rule is that the base `attr` always wins.  If an attribute has already been provided (when the component was instantiated, by the component itself, or by another mixin), then no need to use the default.  From the readme:\n\n```\nThe defaultAttr method is available to both component and mixin modules.\nWhen used with mixins it will not overwrite attributes already defined in the component module.\n```\n\nBy throwing an exception instead, it forces mixin authors to choose whether they want to define defaults themselves or allow consuming components to define their own defaults.\n\nYeah, if the mixin defines a default that accidentally collides with a component or other mixin, it would definitely be a problem.  But I think the ordering there is backwards for normal development.  If I'm writing a component and I want to use a mixin, I need to see which attributes that mixin uses so that I can pass arguments to it and so I can avoid name collisions.  Right now, I can't see that in the `with_select` mixin other than reading through the function bodies.

    "tgvashworth": "What's the thinking on this now, a few months later?\n\nThis might break TweetDeck, but not badly. Afaik, we're only passing an object to attachTo in a few places and from a quick scan of the code, the attributes are defined in most places.\n\nOne thing I'd like to add to this discussion: a misconception I had when starting with Flight was that the component function was run once per instance at attach time. That meant I did things like:\n\n``` javascript\nthis.defaultAttrs({\n  rifftumbles: []\n});\n\nthis.somethingGood = function () {\n  this.attr.rifftumbles.push({\n    beep: 'boop'\n  });\n};\n```\n\nOf course, then the `rifftumbles` are shared between instances of the component.\n\nMy question then is: should instance-specific state go in `instance.attr`? If so, is there a possible  syntax that avoids this kind of thing?\n\nThis seems to verbose, not to mention the redundant static data it would produce.\n\n``` javascript\nthis.attributes(function () {\n  return {\n    boopSelector: '.boop',\n    rifftumbles: []\n  };\n});\n```\n. I'm interested in why this isn't baked in. I totally respect the decision not to have it, but I'm just wondering what the reasoning is?\n\nAlso, what are the pros and cons of, for example, using a `withOnce` mixin?\n. Ok, I see \u2013 but just to be clear, I wasn't suggesting Flight ship with a `withOnce`, I was just suggesting it as an alternative to a util. Or was that clear, and I've missed what you meant?! :)\n. I think this can be closed, as it got added in #186.\n. From Angus via email:\n\n> Many thanks for bringing this up. Excellent find. Going to noodle on this for a while - my first reaction is we might be able to do this a bit more efficiently and still take advantage of jQuery's bound<->target association via guid. Also want to make sure we don't break this: https://github.com/flightjs/flight/pull/21\n\nI agree on the efficiency point \u2013 there may be a more efficient way to remove the handlers. I'm thinking particularly about `findEventsByTarget` - there's slightly too much iteration over `events` going on.\n\nHowever, I'd be very hesitant to manipulate jQuery's guids. For one, it ties Flight tightly into jQuery's way of doing event handler registration.\n\nRegarding that issue, there's a test in place and I was thinking about it when I put together this fix.\n\nWill take another look at this in the morning. We tore our hair out a bit, figuring out what was going on \u2013 ironically, a debugging browser extension might have helped! Spurs me on a bit :)\n. I don't think that tying Flight's event implementation to jQuery's is a good idea. jQuery could easily change this in future, and then Flight would have to change \u2013 or enforce an old jQuery version.\n\nMy view would be to let jQuery do its event binding however it wants, and deal with Flight's in a Flight-specific way.\n. So am I still wrong? :)\n\nThis is all getting very confusing. You're referring to the PR @angus-c has opened with a different fix for the same bug? If so, can you delete the comment here and move them over if you think it's still appropriate?\n. But, by using jQuery guids we're depending jQuery's _implementation_, not its interface. Any DOM library worth its salt will clean up listeners, but absolutely not all will use guids.\n. @angus-c Would be great to get one of these two merged.\n\nIn summary of my points here: I think messing with guids is a bad idea as it relies on jQuery's implementation, not exposed API, and I think we should iterate on this PR to make finding the right callback to pass to `.off` more efficient.\n\nI would also like to point out that Flight already iterated through the instance's events once in removeBind, so any iteration bottleneck was already there. We can probably roll them into one and maintain the same performance characteristics.\n. Closing because it seems like we'll go with #192.\n. (If you saw/got emails about my earlier comments, please ignore \u2013 wasn't concentrating)\n\nThis looks good, although I think `off` should remove _all_ handlers, not just one at a time.\n\nI'd also like to see include come docs about _why_ this changed.\n. @angus-c You're using `callback.bound.some` and returning on the first one found. That means, if one component registers the same event twice (with the same callback, on the same node), you won't remove all of them \u2013 so you have to call `off` once for every `on`. I think it should remove _all_ matching events.\n\nSeems you could use `callback.bound = callback.bound.filter(...)`.\n\nHere's a test that fails and demonstrates it:\n\n``` javascript\nit('unbinds all event handlers which share the same node, event, callback and instance', function () {\n  var instance1 = (new Component).initialize(window.outerDiv);\n  var spy = jasmine.createSpy();\n  instance1.on(document, 'event1', spy);\n  instance1.on(document, 'event1', spy);\n  instance1.off(document, 'event1', spy);\n  // uncomment this and the test passes\n  // instance1.off(document, 'event1', spy);\n  instance1.trigger('event1');\n  expect(spy).not.toHaveBeenCalled();\n});\n```\n\nI'm also interested: could we not have iterated on my PR (with the big commit message + explanation) to this?\n. I'm ok with this fix, although I don't much like adding to the callback. It seems to me the registry is where this should be focused as much as possible, as it's such a flight-specific thing, but this works too.\n. That would mean you can't enable logging later, right? Unless you register (and deregister?) the advice when `enabled` changes.\n. Lgtm, although it does trouble me how unreadable that argument extraction code is!\n. Aiming to do a revamp of the developer experience for 2.0.0 \u2014 something like this would be very useful.\n. Hmm. What nodes are your instances attached to? Do you have a reduced test-case?\n. Closing \u2014 will pick up again in future if there's demand.\n. Oh, ok! I thought it was a bit \"magic\". Is there a plan to remove it?\n. I'd be interested in seeing the use case (problem & solution) that having a collection addresses \u2013 gives something to base a discussion on.\n\nFWIW, withTeardown would actually support collection-style behaviour. We _need_ to get it out so y'all can play with it.\n. The behaviour you describe is exactly what we use withTeardown for in TweetDeck \u2013 single-page-app with component trees per \"page\".\n. Tearing down _all_ components is very unlikely, and not particularly useful in a single page app.\n\nFor example you would almost certainly want to (frequently) teardown the set of view components the user could currently see, but you would not want to teardown your auth component. `teardownAll` is very heavy-handed; `withTeardown` allows sub-sections of the DOM tree (and therefore the component tree) to teardown in isolation, without bringing the rest of the app down.\n. @angus-c Sure - but when are you going to be a whole app with instances of the same component?\n\nI'm yet to hear of an example that can't be solved using `withTeardown` (which is why TD is interested in getting it into Flight core, but that's a discussion for another time), but I won't make the argument for `withTeardown` again here - rather, I'll put together something more comprehensive.\n. @angus-c Great \u2013 will get it somewhere asap.\n. There's no test for this case, so I'd guess it's just missing functionality. Will put a patch together, unless you beat me to it ;)\n. Not sure of the intention here. Closing, happy to reopen if there's something specific to be changed.\n. Actually, on second thoughts \u2014 I rather this didn't go into Flight. It's not very obvious what's happening. Might save someone some debugging time (\"Why isn't this event being listened for here? Why is it suddenly popping up there?\") if we force people to be specific when they want to do this.\n. @houyhea Closing, happy to repoen if this you're still having trouble.\n. Hey @gc-victor \u2014 thanks for this, sorry about the delay in getting to it.\n\nCould you link back to the Flight mailing list discussion if it's still relevant? Would like some more context. Thanks!\n. Totally agree that this is bug, but I don't think relying on jQuery namespaces is the solution; we should just implement `off` such that it matches user expectations by only unbinding the relevant listeners.\n. Thanks for looking at this! Haven't got a sec to look at it right now, but a thing to look out for + test is if this works with multiple instances of the same component. If one unbinds, do the others' listeners stick around?\n. @gc-victor Is this still relevant? It's broken the build, so needs a refactor. Will close if not.\n. It seems to me the functionality you want doesn't match jQuery's behaviour, because namespaces act more like tags than a hierarchy. For example, in your `e.namespace` example, I think the namespace would be `wants`.\n\nThe way I see it, that means the functionality you want would have be implemented in Flight internally, which complects the core.\n\nI haven't tried, but it might be possible to build it the functionality you want with a mixin.\n. @giuseppeg Indeed, I was saying that the jQuery behaviour doesn't match the behaviour @jfsiii  described.\n\nI don't think the feature being present in jQuery has any bearing on this \u2013 jQuery has plenty of features Flight doesn't have.\n\nWe could move this in the direction of a \"Flight needs namespacing\" discussion. It's a different question, the answer to which could be a different API.\n. @jfsiii Cool \u2013 if you come up with something nice, please do publish it! Now Flight has `.mixin` it's easy to mix & match functionality, and namespacing may turn out to be a really great feature.\n. Pull request to fix this gladly accepted! @staeke \n. Leaving this open but marking for 2.0.0 milestone, which will include a documentation revamp.\n. Closing \u2014 `Attributes` is nice and this isn't a huge thing. It could change for 2.0.0.\n. Hmm. After a few hours on it, I'm going to wontfix and close this. We're going to remove proxying before 2 (and move it into userland with a mixin), so I don't think it bears too much effort now.\n. This contains the per instance callback removal \u2013 is that right?\n\nI also don't feel good about namespaces but I think we should have a discussion about it \u2014  #264 is probably the right place.\n. Closing as this doesn't seem to have moved anywhere. Happy to reopen if there are objections.\n. Hmm. Ok, well I'll PR generator-flight-package to get it working again.\n. In TweetDeck we use events similarly to the way described by @giuseppeg and others: `uiNeedsX` and `dataX`. But I think this is not always a good way of doing things, because it ties the component implementations too closely.\n\nMy recommendation would be that, wherever possible, you build your components reactively:\n\n``` js\n// UI Component\nthis.trigger('uiFinshedDoingAThing', { ... });\nthis.on('usefulDataForAnotherThing', function (e, data) { ... });\n\n// Data Component\nthis.on('uiFinshedDoingAThing', function (e, data) {\n  this.trigger('usefulDataForAnotherThing', { ... });\n});\n```\n\nThe event names are not really related, so if something changes in the data layer between `uiFinishedDoingAThing` and `usefulDataForAnotherThing`, you don't have to go change the UI component too.\n\nIf you're using a UI controller pattern, you can use this kind of thing to coordinate multiple UI components' behaviour without changing their code.\n\nOf course, _it depends_. :wink:\n. If I benchmarked the difference, how much would be unacceptable?\n. Am working on Flight tooling, hooking into `trigger` to show what's being triggered where amongst other things. Afaict, really the only hookable bit of Flight is the registry (exposed in standalone, mostly requireable in AMD), and the one method that isn't always exposed is `trigger`.\n\nI would say it's fine to keep behind debug mode, but TweetDeck can't run in debug mode because we're passing non-seriablizable data around, and we aren't the only ones \u2013 the Airbnb search page does it too, and most likely others.\n\nUnless there's another way to advice every component's `trigger`, added at runtime after the flight app may have loaded, the utility of & scope for the tools I'm building will be severely limited :/\n\nMy view is that two, essentially noop, function calls per trigger is fine.\n. What's `this` in that example?\n. There isn't a component here \u2013 it's an external tool that hooks into Flight. That's why I need it on the registry \u2013 it's the only bit has externally exposed methods that are called with a component's context (from `withRegistration`).\n\nFwiw, I am actually using advice on `trigger`, but it's the registry's trigger \u2013 and that's why I need it to not be behind the debug flag.\n. I'm not already using advice to go around trigger \u2013 I'm only able to do that when it's exposed and not behind the flag. This PR just makes it possible when the flag is off.\n. @sayrer I don't know _why_ we are, but we are.\n\nTo summarise again: I want a way to hook into _every trigger on all components, with arguments_. This is possible with `registry.trigger`, but the call cannot be behind a flag for the tools to be useful to TweetDeck and, it turns out, Airbnb. I'm sure there are others.\n\nIf there's an alternate way to do this without a PR, I'm all ears.\n. We have a huge amount of non-Flight code and so in some cases it's simply impractical to use something serializable to get data in and out of that layer.\n. Closing as we agreed offline to add the necessary data to the DEBUG global.\n. @BugiDev is this still an issue?\n\nFwiw, that `var self` is going to cause you trouble because the scope it's declared in is shared by all instances of the mixin \u2014 add some logging next to it to demonstrate how often it's run. There's almost certainly a better way.\n. This sounds good \u2013 can't see any obvious issues. Do we have any idea how long it'll take to the test extensions up to scratch?\n. Ok, I'll give it a go.\n. I would merge it but I'm not sure how to test the standalone version. Will it be affected by this change?\n. Yeah, I think this is nice. Will add a quick comment.\n. Also needs a test!\n. Sweet, thanks @prashaantt!\n. Yeah, good point. I'll pick it up tomorrow unless you'd like to throw up a PR?\n. Hey @patricknixon \u2014 thanks for your thoughts.\n\nI think the use case you describe is unlikely enough that it's not a problem \u2014 and you're right in saying it's probably a horrible design!\n. Hey @zeno, thanks for the report. Are you still seeing this?\n. This is closely related to #320, and will probably be fixed by that.\n. Yep! Woohoo.\n. I think I agree with your comments @giuseppeg \u2014 proxying is giving us this combinatorial complexity issue that would be better as a separate API. Happy for me to close this?\n. @danwrong Think it's worth moving forward with this? I don't like the prototype copying hack much, but it's not much code and only turns on in debug mode.\n. Not going to merge now, but come back and iterate this in future.\n. Like it. Needs documentation?\n. Let's make sure we get this documented.\n. Thanks for this @giuseppeg.\n\nFor backward compatibility I'd like to keep `data.el`, otherwise this needs to go out with a major version bump (well, for this semver-ish project it's minor), not to mention a load of refactoring in TweetDeck. Can we just add `currentTarget` and the test?\n. Gonna close this cos I've put up another with some fixes (#329) \u2014 not sure of a better way to contribute to your pull!\n. To differentiate between delegated and directly bound events, we'll probably need a syntax like this:\n\n``` js\nthis.off('click', { \n  buttonSelector: this.calculateShippingPrice\n});\n```\n. Yeah, this'll definitely require some redoing of the delegation stuff.\n. Nice, thanks!\n. That's expected behaviour \u2014 you should use an object.\n. Hi @hwclass \u2014 currently, Flight has a hard dependency on jQuery. A jQuery-less version  has been built before, but we haven't got it to a finished state yet. I'll try to convince @danwrong to put up a pull request for it.\n. WIP is on the [feature/remove-jquery-320](https://github.com/flightjs/flight/tree/feature/remove-jquery-320) branch.\n. So this is actually kinda done. v2 isn't ready to use yet, but as of recently it doesn't use jQuery! Woo!\n\n[This issue](https://github.com/flightjs/flight-toolbox/issues/2) on the flight-toolbox will track adding jQuery back if you want it, via a dom plugin replacement of some kind. The specifics of that are yet to be worked out.\n. Thanks @twuttke \n. Thank you @jared-stilwell \n. Thanks for your thoughts @BugiDev.\n\nTo clarify, I don't think the parent should have access to the methods of the child. Have a look at the [actor model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) for some context about why.\n\nI actually mean a very limited interface for talking/modifying to the child. The kind of thing that could simply be done with events.\n\n@BugiDev Your example is troublesome because of the teardown behaviour \u2014 it has to work automatically. A parent should not depend on a child being there (nor the reverse, really).\n. Hmm. It's a tough question. Here's my thinking behind this; perhaps it'll clarify why I want it (though there aren't really any answers here).\n\nIn short(ish), I don't really think the actor model (aka, Flight-philosophy) is really suitable for building complex interfaces, and Flight throws the baby out with the bath water in it's insistence on separating components from each other. \n\nReact and cousins have shown there's a huge amount of value in embracing component hierarchy, and I think there's a comfortable middle ground for Flight.\n\nPerhaps this will make more sense when TweetDeck open-sources the observable stream stuff we've been using \u2014 it's absolutely staggering how much more simple, testable and readable components become when you architect around the inherent tree-structure of UI.\n\nIt's possible we don't need this, but I'd be really interested to discuss it.\n. Hey @mikkotikkanen. The intention is that this is just a mixin/utility that helps you with component definition and is therefore totally optional. The general thing here is just to start thinking about hiding some of the API intuition bugs in Flight.\n. Threw together a quick POC of an ES6 class-based API. Main thing is that we can do mixins (tho the [value of them is questionable](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/mixins-are-dead-long-live-higher-order-components-94a0d2f9e750#.m53oewfa6)) and static attribute definition (static analysis anyone?).\n\n``` js\nclass Component {\n  constructor(node, attr={}) {\n    this.attr = Object.assign(Object.create(this.constructor.attributes || {}), attr);\n    this.constructor.mixins.forEach(Mixin => Mixin.call(this));\n  }\n}\n\nfunction BooperMixin() {\n  this.booper = true;\n}\n\nclass Button extends Component {\n  static attributes = {\n    onClick: () => {}\n  };\n  static mixins = [BooperMixin];\n\n  /* ... */\n}\n\nnew Button(document.body, {\n  onClick: () => { console.log('sup!') }\n})\n```\n. Thinking this could be done by making attributes and defaultAttrs compatible (currently they're mutually exclusive).\n. Enough time has passed for `defaultAttrs` to have been migrated away from, so the deprecation strategy will be:\n- release a `1.x` that spits warnings (in debug mode) when `defaultAttrs` is used\n- make defaultAttrs a warning-spitting (regardless of debug mode) no-op in `2`\n\nWe need to be this strict about it because the two are mutually exclusive, so projects like TweetDeck will have to do an all-at-once switch.\n. Thanks for this!\n\nYeah, the event object will stay \u2014 but the jQuery change is quite a while away and I think there will be a big documentation rework at the same time.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks alot for this @aemonge. I'm afraid it's something we can't merge as it's a backward incompatible change \u2014 for example, it forbids a component to listen on the `document` which is behaviour Flight encourages.\n\nYou could however enforce this behaviour in your own code by creating a mixin with the API you want, and mixing it into a new base component. Happy to help out if you'd like to do this.\n. Landed in 1f3203d, but we also need a mixin the add this back via the API discussed above.\n. I've submitted an issue on the new [flight-toolbox](https://github.com/flightjs/flight-toolbox) repo to track the creation of this mixin: https://github.com/flightjs/flight-toolbox/issues/1\n. @marti1125 Sure! Just a link and bit of text would be perfect \u2014 thanks :smile: \n. @marti1125 Ooh, good question. I think the first one, but I'll have a think about how we can integrate this stuff into the main documentation.\n. Hey @paulwib \u2014 thanks for reporting these, I'll fix them right away.\n\nYes, v2 is happening on master \u2014 I'll delete the v2 branch too.\n. Hi @c0. Huh, this is interesting \u2014 thanks for bringing it up.\n\nPerhaps we could call it `defineComponent` \u2014 the noun `definition` is a funny one.\n\nAs an aside, this would be good to get out in `v1.x` release, so could you put it up against that branch instead? Thanks!\n. Thanks very much for moving this over.\n\nSo now the question is: do we merge this or wait for amd-optimize to fix their bug?\n. That's a good question. It's possible that we'll move to CommonJS for `v2` but for now this seems good enough to prevent these errors.\n\nWill merge now but I probably won't get a release out until next week.\n. Thanks! :heart: \n. Thanks @AndrewLorente!\n. Hey @crudbug.\n\nI think virtual-dom is usable already, although I've not tried it myself. I see no problem with a component rendering itself with virtual-dom, and just not using the jQuery-based features, but I don't know how it would work in a large component tree.\n\nIf you experiment with this, please report back! I'll be really interested to hear how you get on.\n. Looks unlikely this going to go anywhere in Flight core. User-land may provide support.\n. Thanks!\n. Fantastic, thanks!\n. Thanks! Sorry for the delay.\n. Hey @fridays \u2014 thanks for this! Unfortunately, making an optimisation like this would only work if the DOM under a component was static \u2014 if the set of nodes that matched the selector changes, a cached version would miss these changes. The boolean flag is useful, but the assumption in existing code is that select is dynamic, so this would be a significant breaking change.\n\nYou could however make a (really useful) mixin called something like `withSelectCached` that added a method exactly like you describe (perhaps `this.selectCached`) that helps in the case that you _know_ the DOM is static.\n. Hey! I'd love to see an updated, modern Flight website with full documentation and examples. It's just a case of when we'll have time to work on it!\n. Cool! My approach would be to keep the docs in the same repo as the code and use a build task to commit them in website form to a `gh-pages` branch.\n\nThe build-step approach might be wrong but I think it's important to keep the docs beside the code, so commits can contain both and be checked for consistency.\n. The documentation is OK for what we have now \u2014 there's unlikely to be any more core Flight development, so going to close this for now.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks! \n. Perhaps it doesn't need to be broken out, and a DOM plugin library would just sit alongside... That makes things a whole lot easier for us!\n. :skull: \n. This is a fiddly one \u2014 we definitely should. I'm not really sure how to test it \u2014 I'd rather not force `closest` use the built-in in browsers that support it, so that the Flight implementation is used, because it would make the tests leak into the function.\n\nMaybe as a compromise we could expose the Flight implementation as `flightClosest` (and not mention it), test that function, and then make `closest` a feature-detector and not test it.\n\nWhat do you think? \n. Oh, that's an interesting approach, and there might be other polyfills we could use (CustomEvent?) for all the stuff that's soon to be standardised. What do you think about coming up with a baseline browser feature-set for Flight? (We already require es5-shim, I think)\n. I was thinking we just declare a baseline and ask users to deliver that however they like \u2014 what do you think of that?\n. v2 thing \u2014 will close this. Maybe someone in future will come back and work on Flight 2!\n. Thanks Giuseppe.\n. Hey! Sorry for the stupendously long wait on this one. I'm going to cherry pick your work onto master and close this. Thanks for your contribution!\n. Hey! Sorry for the stupendously long wait on this one. I'm going to cherry pick your work onto master and close this. Thanks for your contribution!\n. Hey @JungMinu \u2014 thanks for the change. I'm not seeing any Flight-y stuff on your site, and it doesn't seem to be built with Flight. Am I missing something? Sorry if I am!\n. This looks like your CV \u2014 will accept another PR if it's for an app that uses Flight. Thanks!\n. Great, thanks everyone!\n\nIf you're up for contributing, I'd love to see some work on some of the open issues for v2. To get started have a look at the [helpwanted](https://github.com/flightjs/flight/labels/helpwanted) label, or start submitting and fixing issues of your own!\n. @sperovic Thanks!\n. v2 thing \u2014 closing.\n. Thanks for this @giuseppeg. Could you provide a bit more info about what's broken? Would help me out a lot.\n. Thanks @giuseppeg. So what's still broken \u2014 the `('document', { ... })` case? Definitely we should test for that if it's a valid use of the API.\n. @giuseppeg Totally reasonable, yeah \u2014 and I'm onboard with removing those string shortcuts too.\n. @angus-c Thanks for handling this one! Did you mean to merge it (rather than just close)?\n. Sorry @giuseppeg \u2014 looks like v2 isn't going to happen, will close this. Thanks for all your work.\n. @rymai Hey! Sorry for the stupendously long wait on this one. I'm going to cherry pick your commits (which are great) back onto master and close this. Thanks for your contribution!\n. Thanks @jshen212!\n. Hi @chenqing. Flight is not under active development, which includes v2.\n. \ud83d\udea2 . What's the thinking on this now, a few months later?\n\nThis might break TweetDeck, but not badly. Afaik, we're only passing an object to attachTo in a few places and from a quick scan of the code, the attributes are defined in most places.\n\nOne thing I'd like to add to this discussion: a misconception I had when starting with Flight was that the component function was run once per instance at attach time. That meant I did things like:\n\n``` javascript\nthis.defaultAttrs({\n  rifftumbles: []\n});\n\nthis.somethingGood = function () {\n  this.attr.rifftumbles.push({\n    beep: 'boop'\n  });\n};\n```\n\nOf course, then the `rifftumbles` are shared between instances of the component.\n\nMy question then is: should instance-specific state go in `instance.attr`? If so, is there a possible  syntax that avoids this kind of thing?\n\nThis seems to verbose, not to mention the redundant static data it would produce.\n\n``` javascript\nthis.attributes(function () {\n  return {\n    boopSelector: '.boop',\n    rifftumbles: []\n  };\n});\n```\n. I'm interested in why this isn't baked in. I totally respect the decision not to have it, but I'm just wondering what the reasoning is?\n\nAlso, what are the pros and cons of, for example, using a `withOnce` mixin?\n. Ok, I see \u2013 but just to be clear, I wasn't suggesting Flight ship with a `withOnce`, I was just suggesting it as an alternative to a util. Or was that clear, and I've missed what you meant?! :)\n. I think this can be closed, as it got added in #186.\n. From Angus via email:\n\n> Many thanks for bringing this up. Excellent find. Going to noodle on this for a while - my first reaction is we might be able to do this a bit more efficiently and still take advantage of jQuery's bound<->target association via guid. Also want to make sure we don't break this: https://github.com/flightjs/flight/pull/21\n\nI agree on the efficiency point \u2013 there may be a more efficient way to remove the handlers. I'm thinking particularly about `findEventsByTarget` - there's slightly too much iteration over `events` going on.\n\nHowever, I'd be very hesitant to manipulate jQuery's guids. For one, it ties Flight tightly into jQuery's way of doing event handler registration.\n\nRegarding that issue, there's a test in place and I was thinking about it when I put together this fix.\n\nWill take another look at this in the morning. We tore our hair out a bit, figuring out what was going on \u2013 ironically, a debugging browser extension might have helped! Spurs me on a bit :)\n. I don't think that tying Flight's event implementation to jQuery's is a good idea. jQuery could easily change this in future, and then Flight would have to change \u2013 or enforce an old jQuery version.\n\nMy view would be to let jQuery do its event binding however it wants, and deal with Flight's in a Flight-specific way.\n. So am I still wrong? :)\n\nThis is all getting very confusing. You're referring to the PR @angus-c has opened with a different fix for the same bug? If so, can you delete the comment here and move them over if you think it's still appropriate?\n. But, by using jQuery guids we're depending jQuery's _implementation_, not its interface. Any DOM library worth its salt will clean up listeners, but absolutely not all will use guids.\n. @angus-c Would be great to get one of these two merged.\n\nIn summary of my points here: I think messing with guids is a bad idea as it relies on jQuery's implementation, not exposed API, and I think we should iterate on this PR to make finding the right callback to pass to `.off` more efficient.\n\nI would also like to point out that Flight already iterated through the instance's events once in removeBind, so any iteration bottleneck was already there. We can probably roll them into one and maintain the same performance characteristics.\n. Closing because it seems like we'll go with #192.\n. (If you saw/got emails about my earlier comments, please ignore \u2013 wasn't concentrating)\n\nThis looks good, although I think `off` should remove _all_ handlers, not just one at a time.\n\nI'd also like to see include come docs about _why_ this changed.\n. @angus-c You're using `callback.bound.some` and returning on the first one found. That means, if one component registers the same event twice (with the same callback, on the same node), you won't remove all of them \u2013 so you have to call `off` once for every `on`. I think it should remove _all_ matching events.\n\nSeems you could use `callback.bound = callback.bound.filter(...)`.\n\nHere's a test that fails and demonstrates it:\n\n``` javascript\nit('unbinds all event handlers which share the same node, event, callback and instance', function () {\n  var instance1 = (new Component).initialize(window.outerDiv);\n  var spy = jasmine.createSpy();\n  instance1.on(document, 'event1', spy);\n  instance1.on(document, 'event1', spy);\n  instance1.off(document, 'event1', spy);\n  // uncomment this and the test passes\n  // instance1.off(document, 'event1', spy);\n  instance1.trigger('event1');\n  expect(spy).not.toHaveBeenCalled();\n});\n```\n\nI'm also interested: could we not have iterated on my PR (with the big commit message + explanation) to this?\n. I'm ok with this fix, although I don't much like adding to the callback. It seems to me the registry is where this should be focused as much as possible, as it's such a flight-specific thing, but this works too.\n. That would mean you can't enable logging later, right? Unless you register (and deregister?) the advice when `enabled` changes.\n. Lgtm, although it does trouble me how unreadable that argument extraction code is!\n. Aiming to do a revamp of the developer experience for 2.0.0 \u2014 something like this would be very useful.\n. Hmm. What nodes are your instances attached to? Do you have a reduced test-case?\n. Closing \u2014 will pick up again in future if there's demand.\n. Oh, ok! I thought it was a bit \"magic\". Is there a plan to remove it?\n. I'd be interested in seeing the use case (problem & solution) that having a collection addresses \u2013 gives something to base a discussion on.\n\nFWIW, withTeardown would actually support collection-style behaviour. We _need_ to get it out so y'all can play with it.\n. The behaviour you describe is exactly what we use withTeardown for in TweetDeck \u2013 single-page-app with component trees per \"page\".\n. Tearing down _all_ components is very unlikely, and not particularly useful in a single page app.\n\nFor example you would almost certainly want to (frequently) teardown the set of view components the user could currently see, but you would not want to teardown your auth component. `teardownAll` is very heavy-handed; `withTeardown` allows sub-sections of the DOM tree (and therefore the component tree) to teardown in isolation, without bringing the rest of the app down.\n. @angus-c Sure - but when are you going to be a whole app with instances of the same component?\n\nI'm yet to hear of an example that can't be solved using `withTeardown` (which is why TD is interested in getting it into Flight core, but that's a discussion for another time), but I won't make the argument for `withTeardown` again here - rather, I'll put together something more comprehensive.\n. @angus-c Great \u2013 will get it somewhere asap.\n. There's no test for this case, so I'd guess it's just missing functionality. Will put a patch together, unless you beat me to it ;)\n. Not sure of the intention here. Closing, happy to reopen if there's something specific to be changed.\n. Actually, on second thoughts \u2014 I rather this didn't go into Flight. It's not very obvious what's happening. Might save someone some debugging time (\"Why isn't this event being listened for here? Why is it suddenly popping up there?\") if we force people to be specific when they want to do this.\n. @houyhea Closing, happy to repoen if this you're still having trouble.\n. Hey @gc-victor \u2014 thanks for this, sorry about the delay in getting to it.\n\nCould you link back to the Flight mailing list discussion if it's still relevant? Would like some more context. Thanks!\n. Totally agree that this is bug, but I don't think relying on jQuery namespaces is the solution; we should just implement `off` such that it matches user expectations by only unbinding the relevant listeners.\n. Thanks for looking at this! Haven't got a sec to look at it right now, but a thing to look out for + test is if this works with multiple instances of the same component. If one unbinds, do the others' listeners stick around?\n. @gc-victor Is this still relevant? It's broken the build, so needs a refactor. Will close if not.\n. It seems to me the functionality you want doesn't match jQuery's behaviour, because namespaces act more like tags than a hierarchy. For example, in your `e.namespace` example, I think the namespace would be `wants`.\n\nThe way I see it, that means the functionality you want would have be implemented in Flight internally, which complects the core.\n\nI haven't tried, but it might be possible to build it the functionality you want with a mixin.\n. @giuseppeg Indeed, I was saying that the jQuery behaviour doesn't match the behaviour @jfsiii  described.\n\nI don't think the feature being present in jQuery has any bearing on this \u2013 jQuery has plenty of features Flight doesn't have.\n\nWe could move this in the direction of a \"Flight needs namespacing\" discussion. It's a different question, the answer to which could be a different API.\n. @jfsiii Cool \u2013 if you come up with something nice, please do publish it! Now Flight has `.mixin` it's easy to mix & match functionality, and namespacing may turn out to be a really great feature.\n. Pull request to fix this gladly accepted! @staeke \n. Leaving this open but marking for 2.0.0 milestone, which will include a documentation revamp.\n. Closing \u2014 `Attributes` is nice and this isn't a huge thing. It could change for 2.0.0.\n. Hmm. After a few hours on it, I'm going to wontfix and close this. We're going to remove proxying before 2 (and move it into userland with a mixin), so I don't think it bears too much effort now.\n. This contains the per instance callback removal \u2013 is that right?\n\nI also don't feel good about namespaces but I think we should have a discussion about it \u2014  #264 is probably the right place.\n. Closing as this doesn't seem to have moved anywhere. Happy to reopen if there are objections.\n. Hmm. Ok, well I'll PR generator-flight-package to get it working again.\n. In TweetDeck we use events similarly to the way described by @giuseppeg and others: `uiNeedsX` and `dataX`. But I think this is not always a good way of doing things, because it ties the component implementations too closely.\n\nMy recommendation would be that, wherever possible, you build your components reactively:\n\n``` js\n// UI Component\nthis.trigger('uiFinshedDoingAThing', { ... });\nthis.on('usefulDataForAnotherThing', function (e, data) { ... });\n\n// Data Component\nthis.on('uiFinshedDoingAThing', function (e, data) {\n  this.trigger('usefulDataForAnotherThing', { ... });\n});\n```\n\nThe event names are not really related, so if something changes in the data layer between `uiFinishedDoingAThing` and `usefulDataForAnotherThing`, you don't have to go change the UI component too.\n\nIf you're using a UI controller pattern, you can use this kind of thing to coordinate multiple UI components' behaviour without changing their code.\n\nOf course, _it depends_. :wink:\n. If I benchmarked the difference, how much would be unacceptable?\n. Am working on Flight tooling, hooking into `trigger` to show what's being triggered where amongst other things. Afaict, really the only hookable bit of Flight is the registry (exposed in standalone, mostly requireable in AMD), and the one method that isn't always exposed is `trigger`.\n\nI would say it's fine to keep behind debug mode, but TweetDeck can't run in debug mode because we're passing non-seriablizable data around, and we aren't the only ones \u2013 the Airbnb search page does it too, and most likely others.\n\nUnless there's another way to advice every component's `trigger`, added at runtime after the flight app may have loaded, the utility of & scope for the tools I'm building will be severely limited :/\n\nMy view is that two, essentially noop, function calls per trigger is fine.\n. What's `this` in that example?\n. There isn't a component here \u2013 it's an external tool that hooks into Flight. That's why I need it on the registry \u2013 it's the only bit has externally exposed methods that are called with a component's context (from `withRegistration`).\n\nFwiw, I am actually using advice on `trigger`, but it's the registry's trigger \u2013 and that's why I need it to not be behind the debug flag.\n. I'm not already using advice to go around trigger \u2013 I'm only able to do that when it's exposed and not behind the flag. This PR just makes it possible when the flag is off.\n. @sayrer I don't know _why_ we are, but we are.\n\nTo summarise again: I want a way to hook into _every trigger on all components, with arguments_. This is possible with `registry.trigger`, but the call cannot be behind a flag for the tools to be useful to TweetDeck and, it turns out, Airbnb. I'm sure there are others.\n\nIf there's an alternate way to do this without a PR, I'm all ears.\n. We have a huge amount of non-Flight code and so in some cases it's simply impractical to use something serializable to get data in and out of that layer.\n. Closing as we agreed offline to add the necessary data to the DEBUG global.\n. @BugiDev is this still an issue?\n\nFwiw, that `var self` is going to cause you trouble because the scope it's declared in is shared by all instances of the mixin \u2014 add some logging next to it to demonstrate how often it's run. There's almost certainly a better way.\n. This sounds good \u2013 can't see any obvious issues. Do we have any idea how long it'll take to the test extensions up to scratch?\n. Ok, I'll give it a go.\n. I would merge it but I'm not sure how to test the standalone version. Will it be affected by this change?\n. Yeah, I think this is nice. Will add a quick comment.\n. Also needs a test!\n. Sweet, thanks @prashaantt!\n. Yeah, good point. I'll pick it up tomorrow unless you'd like to throw up a PR?\n. Hey @patricknixon \u2014 thanks for your thoughts.\n\nI think the use case you describe is unlikely enough that it's not a problem \u2014 and you're right in saying it's probably a horrible design!\n. Hey @zeno, thanks for the report. Are you still seeing this?\n. This is closely related to #320, and will probably be fixed by that.\n. Yep! Woohoo.\n. I think I agree with your comments @giuseppeg \u2014 proxying is giving us this combinatorial complexity issue that would be better as a separate API. Happy for me to close this?\n. @danwrong Think it's worth moving forward with this? I don't like the prototype copying hack much, but it's not much code and only turns on in debug mode.\n. Not going to merge now, but come back and iterate this in future.\n. Like it. Needs documentation?\n. Let's make sure we get this documented.\n. Thanks for this @giuseppeg.\n\nFor backward compatibility I'd like to keep `data.el`, otherwise this needs to go out with a major version bump (well, for this semver-ish project it's minor), not to mention a load of refactoring in TweetDeck. Can we just add `currentTarget` and the test?\n. Gonna close this cos I've put up another with some fixes (#329) \u2014 not sure of a better way to contribute to your pull!\n. To differentiate between delegated and directly bound events, we'll probably need a syntax like this:\n\n``` js\nthis.off('click', { \n  buttonSelector: this.calculateShippingPrice\n});\n```\n. Yeah, this'll definitely require some redoing of the delegation stuff.\n. Nice, thanks!\n. That's expected behaviour \u2014 you should use an object.\n. Hi @hwclass \u2014 currently, Flight has a hard dependency on jQuery. A jQuery-less version  has been built before, but we haven't got it to a finished state yet. I'll try to convince @danwrong to put up a pull request for it.\n. WIP is on the [feature/remove-jquery-320](https://github.com/flightjs/flight/tree/feature/remove-jquery-320) branch.\n. So this is actually kinda done. v2 isn't ready to use yet, but as of recently it doesn't use jQuery! Woo!\n\n[This issue](https://github.com/flightjs/flight-toolbox/issues/2) on the flight-toolbox will track adding jQuery back if you want it, via a dom plugin replacement of some kind. The specifics of that are yet to be worked out.\n. Thanks @twuttke \n. Thank you @jared-stilwell \n. Thanks for your thoughts @BugiDev.\n\nTo clarify, I don't think the parent should have access to the methods of the child. Have a look at the [actor model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) for some context about why.\n\nI actually mean a very limited interface for talking/modifying to the child. The kind of thing that could simply be done with events.\n\n@BugiDev Your example is troublesome because of the teardown behaviour \u2014 it has to work automatically. A parent should not depend on a child being there (nor the reverse, really).\n. Hmm. It's a tough question. Here's my thinking behind this; perhaps it'll clarify why I want it (though there aren't really any answers here).\n\nIn short(ish), I don't really think the actor model (aka, Flight-philosophy) is really suitable for building complex interfaces, and Flight throws the baby out with the bath water in it's insistence on separating components from each other. \n\nReact and cousins have shown there's a huge amount of value in embracing component hierarchy, and I think there's a comfortable middle ground for Flight.\n\nPerhaps this will make more sense when TweetDeck open-sources the observable stream stuff we've been using \u2014 it's absolutely staggering how much more simple, testable and readable components become when you architect around the inherent tree-structure of UI.\n\nIt's possible we don't need this, but I'd be really interested to discuss it.\n. Hey @mikkotikkanen. The intention is that this is just a mixin/utility that helps you with component definition and is therefore totally optional. The general thing here is just to start thinking about hiding some of the API intuition bugs in Flight.\n. Threw together a quick POC of an ES6 class-based API. Main thing is that we can do mixins (tho the [value of them is questionable](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/mixins-are-dead-long-live-higher-order-components-94a0d2f9e750#.m53oewfa6)) and static attribute definition (static analysis anyone?).\n\n``` js\nclass Component {\n  constructor(node, attr={}) {\n    this.attr = Object.assign(Object.create(this.constructor.attributes || {}), attr);\n    this.constructor.mixins.forEach(Mixin => Mixin.call(this));\n  }\n}\n\nfunction BooperMixin() {\n  this.booper = true;\n}\n\nclass Button extends Component {\n  static attributes = {\n    onClick: () => {}\n  };\n  static mixins = [BooperMixin];\n\n  /* ... */\n}\n\nnew Button(document.body, {\n  onClick: () => { console.log('sup!') }\n})\n```\n. Thinking this could be done by making attributes and defaultAttrs compatible (currently they're mutually exclusive).\n. Enough time has passed for `defaultAttrs` to have been migrated away from, so the deprecation strategy will be:\n- release a `1.x` that spits warnings (in debug mode) when `defaultAttrs` is used\n- make defaultAttrs a warning-spitting (regardless of debug mode) no-op in `2`\n\nWe need to be this strict about it because the two are mutually exclusive, so projects like TweetDeck will have to do an all-at-once switch.\n. Thanks for this!\n\nYeah, the event object will stay \u2014 but the jQuery change is quite a while away and I think there will be a big documentation rework at the same time.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks alot for this @aemonge. I'm afraid it's something we can't merge as it's a backward incompatible change \u2014 for example, it forbids a component to listen on the `document` which is behaviour Flight encourages.\n\nYou could however enforce this behaviour in your own code by creating a mixin with the API you want, and mixing it into a new base component. Happy to help out if you'd like to do this.\n. Landed in 1f3203d, but we also need a mixin the add this back via the API discussed above.\n. I've submitted an issue on the new [flight-toolbox](https://github.com/flightjs/flight-toolbox) repo to track the creation of this mixin: https://github.com/flightjs/flight-toolbox/issues/1\n. @marti1125 Sure! Just a link and bit of text would be perfect \u2014 thanks :smile: \n. @marti1125 Ooh, good question. I think the first one, but I'll have a think about how we can integrate this stuff into the main documentation.\n. Hey @paulwib \u2014 thanks for reporting these, I'll fix them right away.\n\nYes, v2 is happening on master \u2014 I'll delete the v2 branch too.\n. Hi @c0. Huh, this is interesting \u2014 thanks for bringing it up.\n\nPerhaps we could call it `defineComponent` \u2014 the noun `definition` is a funny one.\n\nAs an aside, this would be good to get out in `v1.x` release, so could you put it up against that branch instead? Thanks!\n. Thanks very much for moving this over.\n\nSo now the question is: do we merge this or wait for amd-optimize to fix their bug?\n. That's a good question. It's possible that we'll move to CommonJS for `v2` but for now this seems good enough to prevent these errors.\n\nWill merge now but I probably won't get a release out until next week.\n. Thanks! :heart: \n. Thanks @AndrewLorente!\n. Hey @crudbug.\n\nI think virtual-dom is usable already, although I've not tried it myself. I see no problem with a component rendering itself with virtual-dom, and just not using the jQuery-based features, but I don't know how it would work in a large component tree.\n\nIf you experiment with this, please report back! I'll be really interested to hear how you get on.\n. Looks unlikely this going to go anywhere in Flight core. User-land may provide support.\n. Thanks!\n. Fantastic, thanks!\n. Thanks! Sorry for the delay.\n. Hey @fridays \u2014 thanks for this! Unfortunately, making an optimisation like this would only work if the DOM under a component was static \u2014 if the set of nodes that matched the selector changes, a cached version would miss these changes. The boolean flag is useful, but the assumption in existing code is that select is dynamic, so this would be a significant breaking change.\n\nYou could however make a (really useful) mixin called something like `withSelectCached` that added a method exactly like you describe (perhaps `this.selectCached`) that helps in the case that you _know_ the DOM is static.\n. Hey! I'd love to see an updated, modern Flight website with full documentation and examples. It's just a case of when we'll have time to work on it!\n. Cool! My approach would be to keep the docs in the same repo as the code and use a build task to commit them in website form to a `gh-pages` branch.\n\nThe build-step approach might be wrong but I think it's important to keep the docs beside the code, so commits can contain both and be checked for consistency.\n. The documentation is OK for what we have now \u2014 there's unlikely to be any more core Flight development, so going to close this for now.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks! \n. Perhaps it doesn't need to be broken out, and a DOM plugin library would just sit alongside... That makes things a whole lot easier for us!\n. :skull: \n. This is a fiddly one \u2014 we definitely should. I'm not really sure how to test it \u2014 I'd rather not force `closest` use the built-in in browsers that support it, so that the Flight implementation is used, because it would make the tests leak into the function.\n\nMaybe as a compromise we could expose the Flight implementation as `flightClosest` (and not mention it), test that function, and then make `closest` a feature-detector and not test it.\n\nWhat do you think? \n. Oh, that's an interesting approach, and there might be other polyfills we could use (CustomEvent?) for all the stuff that's soon to be standardised. What do you think about coming up with a baseline browser feature-set for Flight? (We already require es5-shim, I think)\n. I was thinking we just declare a baseline and ask users to deliver that however they like \u2014 what do you think of that?\n. v2 thing \u2014 will close this. Maybe someone in future will come back and work on Flight 2!\n. Thanks Giuseppe.\n. Hey! Sorry for the stupendously long wait on this one. I'm going to cherry pick your work onto master and close this. Thanks for your contribution!\n. Hey! Sorry for the stupendously long wait on this one. I'm going to cherry pick your work onto master and close this. Thanks for your contribution!\n. Hey @JungMinu \u2014 thanks for the change. I'm not seeing any Flight-y stuff on your site, and it doesn't seem to be built with Flight. Am I missing something? Sorry if I am!\n. This looks like your CV \u2014 will accept another PR if it's for an app that uses Flight. Thanks!\n. Great, thanks everyone!\n\nIf you're up for contributing, I'd love to see some work on some of the open issues for v2. To get started have a look at the [helpwanted](https://github.com/flightjs/flight/labels/helpwanted) label, or start submitting and fixing issues of your own!\n. @sperovic Thanks!\n. v2 thing \u2014 closing.\n. Thanks for this @giuseppeg. Could you provide a bit more info about what's broken? Would help me out a lot.\n. Thanks @giuseppeg. So what's still broken \u2014 the `('document', { ... })` case? Definitely we should test for that if it's a valid use of the API.\n. @giuseppeg Totally reasonable, yeah \u2014 and I'm onboard with removing those string shortcuts too.\n. @angus-c Thanks for handling this one! Did you mean to merge it (rather than just close)?\n. Sorry @giuseppeg \u2014 looks like v2 isn't going to happen, will close this. Thanks for all your work.\n. @rymai Hey! Sorry for the stupendously long wait on this one. I'm going to cherry pick your commits (which are great) back onto master and close this. Thanks for your contribution!\n. Thanks @jshen212!\n.

    "staeke": "Ok, so I've stumbled upon this problem now as well. SPA, navigation away from view, need to tear down all components in that view, while other components exist on page.\n\n**Registry style**\nUsing Flight registry this is obviously quite simple. We did something similar to the gist @giuseppeg provided, but instead used the findInstanceByNode, since we know all nodes we attached flight components to. \n\n**Event style**\nThe other option would be to have all used Flight components listen for an event. e.g. \"requestTeardown\" and then, as a consumer, fire an event on the respective DOM nodes. The components would then check if (evt.target === this.node) { this.teardown() }. This could be accomplished in a number ways though.\n\nTo summarize possible ways:\n1. Do it through registry like above. Works fine, but...is it against Flight philosophy? Registry is currently also undocumented. Is that something to rely on? @tbrd ? (Could also be exposed in core through something like Component.teardownByNode(selector|Element|ElementCollection). Possibly Component.teardownByNode could also check if any component's node has the passed node as an ancestor and then teardown. Or there could be a Component.teardownRemoved that checks registry for components that are attached to removed nodes. I could make a pull request for this if you're interested.\n2. Have a soft requirement on all components to implement the \"requestTeardown\" event above. Not good in that it easily fails, as it's simply not the case that all 3rd party components implement this.\n3. Have some kind of extension that extends the relevant components with this teardown behavior (or mixes it in) in the cases where it makes sense.

First, there hasn't been any confusion around whether the first arg is optional or whether one is able to send any DOM node, or that the default is `this.node` unless you pass a selector. That is clear. Also, there's no confusion around the case where you pass a map of targets.\n\nThe confusion is where you pass a string. Nowhere in the docs does it say that this selector is relative to `document`. Both @patricknixon and I assumed `this.node`. I believe others have/will as well.\n\nMy recommendation would be to, under \"selector: String | Element | Element collection\", include\n\"If selector is a string, that selector will be resolved from `document`. In other words, it would be equivalent to passing $(selector)\"\n. Thanks @tbrd for your comment and @necolas for reopening. \n\nRegarding your question @necolas - about why I (and others) assume that it was relative to `this.node` - why assume that? Well, it seems weird for a component to know about the \"other world\" DOM structure. Or to have requirements on clients on how the outer document should be laid out - then it's not very well encapsulated IMO. So that seems like an odd use case. Secondly, having internal selectors (the click handler for that button rendered in our template) seems like a very common use case, that's why I assumed the overload was built for that purpose. \n\nAnother reason is that the signature VERY much looks looks like jQuery's `on`, which uses current node relative selectors.\n. @angus-c This definitely seems like the recommended approach. The downside I see with that though is that internal selectors are overrideable by outside users of your component. You might want to lock those down to prevent that, or avoid the risk of having naming conflicts with other mixins.\n. @angus-c sure...guess I was a little unclear. I was primarily thinking of code that calls `attachTo`. By moving the selectors to `attr` you open of for the possibility of overriding, which is of course also valid in the case of a mixin. This may or may not be what you want. Point is, you don't have an option. There is not such thing as `defaultPrivateAttrs` or `defaultProtectedAttrs`.\n.

I missed updating the [Readme](https://github.com/flightjs/flight/blob/master/doc/README.md). Looks like I'll need to creater another PR. :(\n. Yes it is. I just ran into this issue too.\n\nAttempting to define `this.attributes` on a component that also has a mixin that defines its own `this.attributes` throws this error \u2014 and it doesn't matter if the `attrs` defined are completely different. Reverting to using `this.defaultAttrs` for both resolves this issue.\n. Sorry about that.\n. Well, this is embarrassing. Today, after weeks of fiddling with Flight, I got DEBUG to work on my project. What I was doing wrong was trying to require my `default.js` (in terms of the Flight generator) in the main require:\n\n``` javascript\nrequire(\n  [\n    'flight/lib/compose',\n    'flight/lib/registry',\n    'flight/lib/advice',\n    'flight/lib/logger',\n    'flight/lib/debug',\n    'page/default'\n  ],\n\n  function (compose, registry, advice, logger, debug, initializeDefault) {\n    debug.enable(true);\n    initializeDefault();\n  }\n);\n```\n\nDEBUG seems to work only when I put\n\n``` javascript\nrequire(['page/default'], function (initializeDefault) {\n  initializeDefault();\n});\n```\n\ninside the function block above, which effectively ensures debug has been set up before `page/default` is loaded \u2014 I should've known that. Either has no effect on the overall functionality of my app \u2014 the events get fired regardless.\n.
