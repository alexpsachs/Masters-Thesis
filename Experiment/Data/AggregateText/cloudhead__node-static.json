There is an `if` before your code.\n\n```\n# node-static.js 195\n} else if (req.method === 'HEAD') {\n    finish(200, headers);\n```\n\nIf `method==='HEAD'` your code will not be reached.\n.

How can I reproduce it? In which scenario the header is sent twice or more?\n\nI saw a possible problem here\n\n```\nif (this.cache && (key in exports.store) &&\n    exports.store[key].stat.mtime >= stat.mtime) {\n    res.end(exports.store[key].buffer);\n    finish(status, headers);\n```\n\n`res.end` is called before `finish`, it can call `writeHead`.\n\n[response.writeHead](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_response_writehead_statuscode_reasonphrase_headers)\n\n> This method must only be called once on a message and it must be called before response.end() is called.\n\nIf it is possible, could be better to fix the flow to avoiding`writeHead` twice or more instead of masking a possible error.\n\nWhat do you think about it?\n\nPS: Call `writeHead` multiple times do not throw an exception, but only the last one will be sent to the response.\n. Hey guys, could you resync the PR and send it again adding tests? :heart:\n. Closed by #73.\n. Hey @aaronj1335!\n\nThanks for the PR.\n\nThis is a really cool feature!\n\nCould you also update the README, like the PR #53 [simple CLI like \"python -m SimpleHTTPServer\"](https://github.com/cloudhead/node-static/pull/53).\n\nCheers,\nPablo Cantero\n. hey @michaelwittig, tks!\n\nI already changed and accepted your previous PR #66.\n\n:metal:\n. Hey!\n\nShould the headers `if-none-match` and `if-modified-since` be capitalized (`If-None-Match` and `If-Modified-Since`)?\n. I was afraid about it... \n\nHTTP/1.1 says: \n\n> http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt\n> Field names\n>    are case-insensitive.\n\nBut... due Node converts all header names to lowercase:\n\n``` bash\ncurl -H 'X-Hello:World' http://127.0.0.1:8080\n```\n\n``` node\nconsole.log(request.headers['X-Hello']) // returns undefined\n\nconsole.log(request.headers['x-hello']) // returns World\n```\n\nI converted all related header names (`request.headers[...]`) in the code to lowercase.\n\nTks for the PR. \n. I liked the idea of `Transparently compile less`, but it seems to be for a specific purpose, I'm not sure if it is a `must have` feature for all users.\n\nGuys, what do you think?\n. Hey @aeisenberg, thanks for the report. \n\nIt was closed by #72.\n. Hey!\n\nIs `application/x-font-woff` the proper type? In W3C and Wikipedia seems to be `application/font-woff`.\n\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/WOFF/\n\n> Type name:\n> application\n> \n> Subtype name:\n> font-woff\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Open_Font_Format\n\n> Internet media type   application/font-woff[1]\n. :smile:\n\nCould you fix the PR?\n\nCheers\n. @kirkaustin with `application/x-font-woff` it works on Chrome?\n. @kirkaustin what do you think?\n\n``` javascript\nstatic.mime.addContentType('woff', 'application/font-woff');\n```\n. closed by #92\n. You can pass the port number as a parameter.\n\nExample:\n\n``` shell\n$ static . -p 3000 & static . -p 3001 & static . -p 3002\n```\n\nWhat is the motivation to use multiples ports?\n\nCheers\n. I don't see it as a `must have` feature, it seems a corner case. I don't know if everybody needs it. Why not only`static -p 8080` as other similar servers?\n\nIf it is really needed maybe a `.static` file inside the directory should work, if there is a `.static` file it will be used as a parameters, so you can configure a different port number for each directory that you need.\n. The [cli.js](https://github.com/cloudhead/node-static/blob/master/bin/cli.js) uses [node-optimist](https://github.com/substack/node-optimist) to retrieve the parameters, have a look at this project to check if it has this feature. :smile: \n. Thanks for the PR! :metal:\n\nCould you write some tests for the both scenarios?\n\nCheers\n. Cool. Could you add few tests to test these scenarios? \n. Hey @daxxog, thanks again! :smile: \n\nI made few comments in the source code, could you check it?\n\nWhy do we need `fileServerExpress`, only `fileServer` doesn't work well for all test scenarios? \n. Hey! The Files Changed seems to be the same. What were the changes?\n. Hey @daxxog, could you update the Pull Request?\n\nIt can't be merged by GitHub.\n\n> This pull request cannot be automatically merged.\n\nCheers\n. Hi @shaoshuai0102.\n\nI think that the querystring convention for JSONP is `jsonp=?` or `callback=?`, mostly callback, since jQuery uses it.\n\nI liked the idea, but I think that it is for too specific purpose. Maybe in the `test.js` instead of \n\n``` javascript\n{\n    \"foo\": \"bar\"\n}\n```\n\nyou should write\n\n``` javascript\ncallback({\n    \"foo\": \"bar\"\n});\n```\n\ndirectly in the file.\n. @cloudhead / @indexzero guys, what is your opinion about this feature?\n. > If this is really not the goal of this project, can you make a plugin mechnism to support this?\n\nThe plugin mechanism for me is the best choice, but unfortunately I don't have time to go with it now, could you help on it?\n. It will be really helpful, there are other pull requests which will be benefited by this plugin mechanism.\n. Thanks you! :smile:  \n\nYou can add a test with `decodeURI(\"%\")`.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/9064536/javascript-decodeuricomponent-malformed-uri-exception\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/7449588/why-does-decodeuricomponent-lock-up-my-browser\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent_encoding\n\nCould you add this test?\n. Great! But I think that in this case the status code could be `400 Bad Request`, what do you think?\n\n> 10.4.1 400 Bad Request\n> The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax. The client SHOULD NOT repeat the > request without modifications.\n\nhttp://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html\n. Hey! \n\nI tested and the tests `npm test` seems to be passing fine. Which test is failing for you?\n\nIs `request.resume()` obligatory in Node 0.10? \n\nhttp://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_message_resume\n\n> Resumes a paused request/response.\n\nI didn't get it. \n. Hi @edpaget, thanks for the explanation. :smile: \n\nI updated my Node to `v0.10.0` and got you PR, for me the testing is freezing on `should be listening`.\n\n>   once an http server is listening with a callback\n>    \u2713 should be listening\n\nIs it working for you?\n. Hey @arjansingh, great patch, thank you.\n\nAre the tests still passing for you?\n\nFor me they stop at `should be listening`.\n\n```\n~/workspace/node-static(master \u2714) npm test\n\n> node-static@0.6.5 test /Users/pablo/workspace/node-static\n> vows --spec --isolate\n\n\n  \u2662 node-static\n\n  once an http server is listening with a callback\n    \u2713 should be listening\n\n```\n\nMy node is v0.10.0.\n\nCheers\n. There are two Pull Requests #87 and #86 fixing it. But I didn't make the tests `npm tests` work with them yet. I'm waiting the tests to merge them into the master and release a new version.\n. There is an old PR #36 about cache, could you check it and re merge?\n. Hi @thbaja, actually this is an issue, not a PR and the #36 can't be automatically merge anymore. Could you remerge it? :smile: \n. @dubiousdavid You can help testing the PR, mostly can't be automatically merged and others need to be tested, could you help?\n. @dubiousdavid is it working for you? Could you check it? I published a new version this week.\n. Hey guys, I merged the PR #93 and published a new version 0.6.9, could you check it?\n\nCheers\n. \\o/\n\n> Thanks everyone.\n\n:+1: \n. It is probably an issue with the in memory cache.\n\nCould you make me a test? Try to comment the lines 241 - 245 in your `node_modules/lib/node-static/node-static.js`?\n\n``` javascript\n                // store[key] = {\n                //    stat:      stat,\n                //    buffer:    buffer,\n                //    timestamp: Date.now()\n                // };\n```\n\nThen restart the node-static.\n. - What is the size of the file that you are trying to serve?\n- What is the size of the server memory?\n. @peili could you test the last release of node-static 0.7.0?\n. Hi @thbaja \n\nI will check in this weekend, sorry for the delay.\n. @thbaja could you also update the README about the mentions to the cache in memory, please?\n. Could you test the version 0.7.0, please?\n. Could you check if the version is 0.7.0, please?\n\n``` sh\nstatic -v\n```\n\nThis new release fixed a similar issue #98 .\n. Tks @valentinvieriu. I bumped the version to 0.7.1 with your fix.\n. It is a static server, it only serves static content. I don't think that POST, DELETE, PATCH, PUT etc are necessary to be handled. Is it something specific that you need to serve?\n. @cloudhead what do you think about handle all http methods in the same way (as a GET/HEAD)? I understand that it can be useful for tests, although we can use other alternatives such as sinon's fake server. My main concern is regarding to \"RFC 2616 compliant HTTP\", node-static doesn't have in-memory cache anymore (the README must be updated), I'm not sure now about other http methods.\n. @aaronj1335 @afc163 hi guys, node-static v0.7.2 accepts any kind of request method. :smile: \n. Great! Could you add a test for these POST requests, please?\n\nhttps://github.com/cloudhead/node-static/blob/master/test/integration/node-static-test.js\n\nIt will also fix #106. \n\ncc/ @afc163 @aaronj1335\n. Thanks for the PR.\n\nCool :smile: \n. Nice! Added to master. \n. Are you following the steps on the README?\n\n``` sh\n$ npm install -g node-static\n\n$ cd directory-to-be-served\n$ static .\n```\n\nIf you are using it like the example bellow\n\n``` javascript\n// foo.js\nvar static = require('node-static');\n\nvar fileServer = new static.Server('./public');\n\nrequire('http').createServer(function (request, response) {\n    request.addListener('end', function () {\n        fileServer.serve(request, response);\n    }).resume();\n}).listen(8080);\n```\n\nYou should install without the `-g` option.\n\n``` sh\n$ npm install node-static\n$ node foo.js\n```\n\n?\n. awesome\n. Done! :smile: \n\nhttps://npmjs.org/package/node-static\n. Good call. I pushed `0.7.3` instead of `v0.7.3`. \"Renaming\" done. Thanks again ;)\n. Awesome!

Is that related to a specific bug? Are the tests still passing? \n. Awesome! Added to master. :smile: \n. BTW node-static doesn't support cache in memory anymore. Many issues/comments asking to remove that, because it was blowing the memory when serving big files. :/\n\nIf you are going to implement an in memory cache, I would recommend to check the file size before caching it. Add some configurable constraints. \n.

Hey @IonicaBizau what's \"lib/.node-static.js.swp\"? \n. @eush77 could it cause problems for people using it without any arg? Like it will start using their local env PORT instead of 8080?\n.

I unintentionally removed it when I was cleaning the package.json.\n. I used the same one, I published this new version today, few hours ago. I think that it is not necessary to create a new version. It is too fresh.\n. worked? \n. Hi @pbouzakis, could you re merge it?\n. There is an `if` before your code.\n\n```\n# node-static.js 195\n} else if (req.method === 'HEAD') {\n    finish(200, headers);\n```\n\nIf `method==='HEAD'` your code will not be reached.\n. [rfc2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html)\n\n> The HEAD method is identical to GET except that the server MUST NOT return a message-body in the response\n\nThank you.\n\nBut.. what about the `headers['Content-Type']`, did you remove it?\n. How can I reproduce it? In which scenario the header is sent twice or more?\n\nI saw a possible problem here\n\n```\nif (this.cache && (key in exports.store) &&\n    exports.store[key].stat.mtime >= stat.mtime) {\n    res.end(exports.store[key].buffer);\n    finish(status, headers);\n```\n\n`res.end` is called before `finish`, it can call `writeHead`.\n\n[response.writeHead](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_response_writehead_statuscode_reasonphrase_headers)\n\n> This method must only be called once on a message and it must be called before response.end() is called.\n\nIf it is possible, could be better to fix the flow to avoiding`writeHead` twice or more instead of masking a possible error.\n\nWhat do you think about it?\n\nPS: Call `writeHead` multiple times do not throw an exception, but only the last one will be sent to the response.\n. Hey guys, could you resync the PR and send it again adding tests? :heart:\n. Closed by #73.\n. Hey @aaronj1335!\n\nThanks for the PR.\n\nThis is a really cool feature!\n\nCould you also update the README, like the PR #53 [simple CLI like \"python -m SimpleHTTPServer\"](https://github.com/cloudhead/node-static/pull/53).\n\nCheers,\nPablo Cantero\n. hey @michaelwittig, tks!\n\nI already changed and accepted your previous PR #66.\n\n:metal:\n. Hey!\n\nShould the headers `if-none-match` and `if-modified-since` be capitalized (`If-None-Match` and `If-Modified-Since`)?\n. I was afraid about it... \n\nHTTP/1.1 says: \n\n> http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt\n> Field names\n>    are case-insensitive.\n\nBut... due Node converts all header names to lowercase:\n\n``` bash\ncurl -H 'X-Hello:World' http://127.0.0.1:8080\n```\n\n``` node\nconsole.log(request.headers['X-Hello']) // returns undefined\n\nconsole.log(request.headers['x-hello']) // returns World\n```\n\nI converted all related header names (`request.headers[...]`) in the code to lowercase.\n\nTks for the PR. \n. I liked the idea of `Transparently compile less`, but it seems to be for a specific purpose, I'm not sure if it is a `must have` feature for all users.\n\nGuys, what do you think?\n. Hey @aeisenberg, thanks for the report. \n\nIt was closed by #72.\n. Hey!\n\nIs `application/x-font-woff` the proper type? In W3C and Wikipedia seems to be `application/font-woff`.\n\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/WOFF/\n\n> Type name:\n> application\n> \n> Subtype name:\n> font-woff\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Open_Font_Format\n\n> Internet media type   application/font-woff[1]\n. :smile:\n\nCould you fix the PR?\n\nCheers\n. @kirkaustin with `application/x-font-woff` it works on Chrome?\n. @kirkaustin what do you think?\n\n``` javascript\nstatic.mime.addContentType('woff', 'application/font-woff');\n```\n. closed by #92\n. You can pass the port number as a parameter.\n\nExample:\n\n``` shell\n$ static . -p 3000 & static . -p 3001 & static . -p 3002\n```\n\nWhat is the motivation to use multiples ports?\n\nCheers\n. I don't see it as a `must have` feature, it seems a corner case. I don't know if everybody needs it. Why not only`static -p 8080` as other similar servers?\n\nIf it is really needed maybe a `.static` file inside the directory should work, if there is a `.static` file it will be used as a parameters, so you can configure a different port number for each directory that you need.\n. The [cli.js](https://github.com/cloudhead/node-static/blob/master/bin/cli.js) uses [node-optimist](https://github.com/substack/node-optimist) to retrieve the parameters, have a look at this project to check if it has this feature. :smile: \n. Thanks for the PR! :metal:\n\nCould you write some tests for the both scenarios?\n\nCheers\n. Cool. Could you add few tests to test these scenarios? \n. Hey @daxxog, thanks again! :smile: \n\nI made few comments in the source code, could you check it?\n\nWhy do we need `fileServerExpress`, only `fileServer` doesn't work well for all test scenarios? \n. Hey! The Files Changed seems to be the same. What were the changes?\n. Hey @daxxog, could you update the Pull Request?\n\nIt can't be merged by GitHub.\n\n> This pull request cannot be automatically merged.\n\nCheers\n. Hi @shaoshuai0102.\n\nI think that the querystring convention for JSONP is `jsonp=?` or `callback=?`, mostly callback, since jQuery uses it.\n\nI liked the idea, but I think that it is for too specific purpose. Maybe in the `test.js` instead of \n\n``` javascript\n{\n    \"foo\": \"bar\"\n}\n```\n\nyou should write\n\n``` javascript\ncallback({\n    \"foo\": \"bar\"\n});\n```\n\ndirectly in the file.\n. @cloudhead / @indexzero guys, what is your opinion about this feature?\n. > If this is really not the goal of this project, can you make a plugin mechnism to support this?\n\nThe plugin mechanism for me is the best choice, but unfortunately I don't have time to go with it now, could you help on it?\n. It will be really helpful, there are other pull requests which will be benefited by this plugin mechanism.\n. Thanks you! :smile:  \n\nYou can add a test with `decodeURI(\"%\")`.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/9064536/javascript-decodeuricomponent-malformed-uri-exception\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/7449588/why-does-decodeuricomponent-lock-up-my-browser\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent_encoding\n\nCould you add this test?\n. Great! But I think that in this case the status code could be `400 Bad Request`, what do you think?\n\n> 10.4.1 400 Bad Request\n> The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax. The client SHOULD NOT repeat the > request without modifications.\n\nhttp://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html\n. Hey! \n\nI tested and the tests `npm test` seems to be passing fine. Which test is failing for you?\n\nIs `request.resume()` obligatory in Node 0.10? \n\nhttp://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_message_resume\n\n> Resumes a paused request/response.\n\nI didn't get it. \n. Hi @edpaget, thanks for the explanation. :smile: \n\nI updated my Node to `v0.10.0` and got you PR, for me the testing is freezing on `should be listening`.\n\n>   once an http server is listening with a callback\n>    \u2713 should be listening\n\nIs it working for you?\n. Hey @arjansingh, great patch, thank you.\n\nAre the tests still passing for you?\n\nFor me they stop at `should be listening`.\n\n```\n~/workspace/node-static(master \u2714) npm test\n\n> node-static@0.6.5 test /Users/pablo/workspace/node-static\n> vows --spec --isolate\n\n\n  \u2662 node-static\n\n  once an http server is listening with a callback\n    \u2713 should be listening\n\n```\n\nMy node is v0.10.0.\n\nCheers\n. There are two Pull Requests #87 and #86 fixing it. But I didn't make the tests `npm tests` work with them yet. I'm waiting the tests to merge them into the master and release a new version.\n. There is an old PR #36 about cache, could you check it and re merge?\n. Hi @thbaja, actually this is an issue, not a PR and the #36 can't be automatically merge anymore. Could you remerge it? :smile: \n. @dubiousdavid You can help testing the PR, mostly can't be automatically merged and others need to be tested, could you help?\n. @dubiousdavid is it working for you? Could you check it? I published a new version this week.\n. Hey guys, I merged the PR #93 and published a new version 0.6.9, could you check it?\n\nCheers\n. \\o/\n\n> Thanks everyone.\n\n:+1: \n. It is probably an issue with the in memory cache.\n\nCould you make me a test? Try to comment the lines 241 - 245 in your `node_modules/lib/node-static/node-static.js`?\n\n``` javascript\n                // store[key] = {\n                //    stat:      stat,\n                //    buffer:    buffer,\n                //    timestamp: Date.now()\n                // };\n```\n\nThen restart the node-static.\n. - What is the size of the file that you are trying to serve?\n- What is the size of the server memory?\n. @peili could you test the last release of node-static 0.7.0?\n. Hi @thbaja \n\nI will check in this weekend, sorry for the delay.\n. @thbaja could you also update the README about the mentions to the cache in memory, please?\n. Could you test the version 0.7.0, please?\n. Could you check if the version is 0.7.0, please?\n\n``` sh\nstatic -v\n```\n\nThis new release fixed a similar issue #98 .\n. Tks @valentinvieriu. I bumped the version to 0.7.1 with your fix.\n. It is a static server, it only serves static content. I don't think that POST, DELETE, PATCH, PUT etc are necessary to be handled. Is it something specific that you need to serve?\n. @cloudhead what do you think about handle all http methods in the same way (as a GET/HEAD)? I understand that it can be useful for tests, although we can use other alternatives such as sinon's fake server. My main concern is regarding to \"RFC 2616 compliant HTTP\", node-static doesn't have in-memory cache anymore (the README must be updated), I'm not sure now about other http methods.\n. @aaronj1335 @afc163 hi guys, node-static v0.7.2 accepts any kind of request method. :smile: \n. Great! Could you add a test for these POST requests, please?\n\nhttps://github.com/cloudhead/node-static/blob/master/test/integration/node-static-test.js\n\nIt will also fix #106. \n\ncc/ @afc163 @aaronj1335\n. Thanks for the PR.\n\nCool :smile: \n. Nice! Added to master. \n. Are you following the steps on the README?\n\n``` sh\n$ npm install -g node-static\n\n$ cd directory-to-be-served\n$ static .\n```\n\nIf you are using it like the example bellow\n\n``` javascript\n// foo.js\nvar static = require('node-static');\n\nvar fileServer = new static.Server('./public');\n\nrequire('http').createServer(function (request, response) {\n    request.addListener('end', function () {\n        fileServer.serve(request, response);\n    }).resume();\n}).listen(8080);\n```\n\nYou should install without the `-g` option.\n\n``` sh\n$ npm install node-static\n$ node foo.js\n```\n\n?\n. awesome\n. Done! :smile: \n\nhttps://npmjs.org/package/node-static\n. Good call. I pushed `0.7.3` instead of `v0.7.3`. \"Renaming\" done. Thanks again ;)\n. Awesome! Added to master. :smile: \n. @shacharz is #129 related? \n. Not with http://www.mysite.com/coolimg.jpg?1 because it's returning 404, but other tests with range worked. There are also [some tests](https://github.com/tchakabam/node-static/blob/d49a6d68e70b24050c60f75c06f059dffff9a272/test/integration/node-static-test.js#L114-L160) covering it.\n. Ok. Good luck! \n.

Thanks, added to master! :smile: \n. Looks good!\n. hey @padapa0406 \n\nIt should work with `.resume()` on node 0.10.x:\n\nhttps://github.com/cloudhead/node-static/pull/97\n\nAre you getting errors on 0.10.x even with resume? \n\nThanks\n. @IonicaBizau hmmm makes sense. Is that related to a specific bug? Are the tests still passing? \n. Awesome! Added to master. :smile: \n. BTW node-static doesn't support cache in memory anymore. Many issues/comments asking to remove that, because it was blowing the memory when serving big files. :/\n\nIf you are going to implement an in memory cache, I would recommend to check the file size before caching it. Add some configurable constraints. \n. Thanks added to master! :smile: \n. @mrfabbri any ideas? #124?\n. @mrfabbri awesome bug tracking. :beers: \n\n> As far as I understand key shouldn't be needed any more (leftover from old caching\n\nIsn't the key == pathname?\n\n``` javascript\nkey = pathname || files[0]\n```\n\n cc/ @IonicaBizau\n. @IonicaBizau :trophy: Added to master and released 0.7.4 with this change.\n. Nice. Added to master. :smile: \n\nCould you also add an example?\n\nhttps://github.com/cloudhead/node-static#example-usage\n. @tchakabam sorry for the delay. Thanks for the PR. Added to master :beers: \n. Thank you all :beers:  I've just released the version v0.7.6.\n. @tchakabam could you review it, please? So we can release the version 0.7.4 including our latest PR as well. \n. @IonicaBizau Oops, correct: 0.7.6 :beers: \n. Hey @IonicaBizau what's \"lib/.node-static.js.swp\"? \n. @eush77 could it cause problems for people using it without any arg? Like it will start using their local env PORT instead of 8080?\n.

I'm not going to take my time to make a benchmark for you. \n\nI'd be interested to see comprehensive data to make a more informed decision, but from my personal node experience the in-memory cache is faster so we'll continue to use it for our production facing node-static sites. \n\nFurthermore, I've spoken with our resident kernel hacker and he's telling me your understanding of caching is somewhat incorrect. I wish I could comment more, but I'm no systems expert. I would suggest posting your issue to the node.js mailing list as a more general node.js development question since this issue isn't just specific to node-static. You'll get a much better answer I'm sure.\n. I don't think anyone really cares that much. You should post this to the node mailing list to get a better response.\n. Any comments on this one @cloudhead? \n\nCould I get a go or no go on this feature? I'd be glad to rewrite it if you hate my implementation, but if you don't want this feature in the lib I'm gonna have to continue to vendor a shit ton of node-statics, and I'm just sooooo lazy.\n\n:-D\n.

Have you actually benchmarked it with the cache disabled vs. enabled?  \n. Please show us the data, Marak.  \n. Your \"resident kernel hacker\" is correct to the extent that application-based caching can save some open() and read() syscalls.  This can improve performance for very small working sets, at the very high cost of precious memory that other applications might benefit from.  In any event, these syscalls are generally fast enough that performance without the additional cache will almost always be more than adequate.\n\nFor, say, edge caching and other enterprise workloads (i.e. where the working set is not unrealistically small), the incremental improvement in performance gained by avoiding these syscalls is small compared to the inefficiencies incurred in caching in user-space.  Using this module incurs at least one additional copy of the data in RAM: one that's mapped to the block I/O cache (since the NodeJS fs module doesn't use direct I/O) and another copy for _each_ NodeJS process.  Consider that very large machines often have 8 cores; unless you're running only one NodeJS process on that host, you're going to have N copies around.  This means you'll be able to effectively cache, _at most_, RAM / (n+1), where n is the number of NodeJS processes.\n\nI encourage you to run a benchmark, ensuring that your working set is not superficially small.  Most benchmarks that appear to demonstrate the effectiveness of a user-space RAM cache exercise retrieving a single file.  Such a benchmark is perhaps true, but it is also misleading with respect to real-world performance.  To be practically relevant, the working set in such benchmarks must be larger than (RAM / (n+1)), where n is the number of CPUs concurrently running NodeJS); they almost never are.\n\nAnd beware: when the cache working set grows larger than RAM (which is quite possible because there's no ceiling on the module's cache size and no LRU or LFU eviction policy), the kernel will swap Node.js pages to disk.  This is perhaps the worst case imaginable.\n\nPlease have your team contact me directly if they disagree with this analysis.\n.

If the client presents the Accept-Encoding: header, then the response can be compressed.

    "mrfabbri": "@anseki [I stumbled on the same problem] actually the problem lies in the commit\nhttps://github.com/joyent/node/commit/a05f973f82d2be8527aad4c371d40d3c7e4c564e which changed the behaviour of normalize (used by join), see:\n\nhttps://github.com/joyent/node/blob/b9bec2031e5f44f47cf01c3ec466ab8cddfa94f6/lib/path.js#L243\n\n[ it is being discussed on https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/7031 ]\n\nAnother possible workaround would be to call resolve() and normalize() on any path passed as document-root:\n\n```\nnew static.Server(path.normalize(path.resolve(aPath)));\n```\n\nwhich is what koa-send does\n\nhttps://github.com/koajs/send/blob/1d02d1b7c264daa43c4b18a918271f1dca8cc5fd/index.js#L41\n. @phstc as @UltCombo mentioned the issue lies in https://github.com/cloudhead/node-static/blob/42206711cc508573a872d5537e3ed1c7b257003a/lib/node-static.js#L296 and it is triggered by the change from `pathname` to `key` (which, if `pathname` is null, becomes `file[0]` ) in 3bdf0d75eca9ccff0b3661e9c39833f7bb97b095 .\n\nAs far as I understand `key` shouldn't be needed any more (leftover from old caching). Also the line \n\n`file = file[0] === '/' ? file : path.join(pathname || '.', file);`\n\nchecks if file is absolute but the check holds only on UNIXes.\n. @IonicaBizau tests result on Windows 7 for

Also the line \n\n`file = file[0] === '/' ? file : path.join(pathname || '.', file);`\n\nchecks if file is absolute but the check holds only on UNIXes.\n. @IonicaBizau tests result on Windows 7 for commit 7f655b1913ab554a32b632f160a49fb4da3de1c4 are not passing (tests on previous commit 4c64f0cfdbe08e7c949ee0a92ef8c7b9e0c90103 are passing, also tests 4858a8212c580fa831b9614825275f38791df579

Yes, seems that `pathname` is `null` and `key` becomes `files[0]`.\n. I added a little fix for checking if path is absolute. Is it enough? See pull request #126.\n. Glad to hear that. :smile: \n.
