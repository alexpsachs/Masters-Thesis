    "srobbin": "Hi All,\n\nThis issue should be resolved in the latest version of Backstretch (v 1.1.1). If someone can verify that this problem is indeed fixed, let me know and I'll close this issue.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. Hi,\n\nUnfortunately, IE 6 will not be supported. That said, if you do discover a fix and would like to submit a pull request, I'd be happy to incorporate it.\n\nThanks,\nScott\n. That should do the trick. Do you have a link to a page where it's not working?\n\nI've also heard people asking about how to rotate images on-the-fly. My suggestion there is to just change the $(\"#backstretch img).attr(\"src\", \"/path/to/new/image\"); using a setInterval and fadeIn/fadeOut.\n. jQuery Backstretch isn't setup to do slideshows. I mentioned in the previous comment how I thought it might work if you wanted to hack something together, though it's definitely a hack. There are a couple of other background plugins out there that do image rotation \u2014 I'd recommend checking those out.\n\nThat said, here's a little more fleshed out idea of the hack described above. I'm not sure if it works, and cannot support it, but hopefully it sparks an idea or pushes you in the right direction.\n\nhttp://gist.github.com/545916\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. Give the latest version a try. I added a hack to account for iOS, so that it uses $(document) instead of $(window) to get the correct height. Let me know if it does/doesn't work.\n. And by latest version, I mean the one from Github, not from my website. If this works, I'll include it in version 1.1.\n. Ah, yeah, that's a problem with Mobile WebKit, not Backstretch itself. Mobile WebKit/Safari doesn't support position:fixed.\n\nhttp://blog.mspace.fm/2009/10/01/iphone-mobile-safari-css-position-fixed/\n\nThere are a few workarounds, but none of them with work with this plugin.\n. Is it happening on the demo page (http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/jquery-backstretch/)? If not, can you please point me to an example that I can take a look at?\n\nThanks,\nScott\n. Hmmm...I'm using Firefox 3.6.8 and Safari 5.0 on OS X, and I don't see it happening. Are you seeing any error messages (if you look at the browsers error console or Firebug)?\n. Damn, that's strange.\n\nI'm not sure why that's happening, and can't seem to reproduce it myself. Are you comfortable with JavaScript and a debugger? If so, I'd love to troubleshoot this with you, and get to the bottom of this.\n. Ah, I think I see what's happening. It doesn't look like I was adjusting the top/left positioning on each resize. So, it was the correct width, just positioned too far off the screen.\n\nTry downloading the latest version, and let me know if it resolves the problem. If so, I'll release this as version 1.1.1.\n\nThanks,\nScott\n. Excellent. Thanks so much for all of your help in squashing this one.\n. Hi efontani,\n\nIt looks like your problems are unrelated to those above, but are being caused by prettyPhoto itself. Near line 101 (of the uncompressed script) there's a line that unbinds all resize events.\n\n<code>$(window).unbind('resize').resize(function(){ _center_overlay(); _resize_overlay(); });</code>\n\nThat line would unbind the event listener that Backstretch needs to know when the window has been resize. If you're comfortable with editing JavaScript, I'd suggest taking out the first \"unbind\" function. That should make things work copacetically.\n\nHope that helps.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. Hi Dan,\n\nUnfortunately, no, I don't plan on supporting IE6 for backstretch. Though, I would like to nudge you in the right direction if I can.\n\nAre you using the regular or minified version of backstretch? I find that it's much easier to troubleshoot with the non-minified version installed. Also, I'd start off by using CSS to put a border around the #backstretch and #backstretch img elements. That way, you can narrow down whether or not it's a CSS issue or not. If it's not CSS, then my first recommendation for JS would be to pass in \"false\" for the centeredX and centeredY parameters. Maybe backstretch is miscalculating the width/height of the window?\n\nHope that helps.\n\nBest of luck,\nScott\n. Hi,\n\nBackstretch won't be able to do this, as is, but if you're looking to fork the project and customize it, I'd recommend looking at line 51. Instead of passing in a \"src,\" you could pass in a selector and swap the image.\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Hi,\n\nDo you have this demo up anywhere online? If so, can you replace your references to jQuery to the non-minified version (http://ajax.microsoft.com/ajax/jquery/jquery-1.4.2.js) and send me a link? I'll take a look.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Hi Todd,\n\nThanks for posting the example. I think I figured out what the problem was. It looks like IE7 was prematurely firing the resize event when the page was loaded, before the background image, itself, was ready. I've added a try/catch block to allow the resize to gracefully fail.\n\nTry downloading the most recent version (1.1.2), and see if the error is gone.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. Hi Kevin,\n\nIt looks like you've included backstretch twice: once in the header and once near the footer. Also, you shouldn't have to attach it to the window's onload event. Backstretch, itself, will wait until the page is ready.\n\nHope that helps.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. No worries. Glad it worked. :)\n\n\u2013S\n. Hi,\n\nUnfortunately, IE6 isn't supported. That said, my first thoughts would be to play with z-index CSS attribute.\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Hi djamell,\n\nI'll look into it for the next release. In the meantime, I'd recommend that you use jQuery to detect whether or not to use backstretch. Something like this:\n\n<code>\n\n<pre>\nif (!$.browser.msie && !$.browser.version==\"6.0\") {\n $.backstretch(...)\n}\n</pre>\n\n</code>\n. Hi. Unfortunately, I'm not providing support for Opera. Though, if you can fork the project, and find a solution, I'd be happy to incorporate the changes into the main trunk.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Hi Kyle,\n\nAs I had mentioned in my other reply, I don't offer support for Opera. Though, I'd very much like to see this work for you.\n\nMy guess is that it's a z-index issue, or that something strange is happening with the text-indent. If adjusting the z-index doesn't work, try applying the text-indent to the <a> tag instead of \".title\".\n\n<div class=\"title\"><a href=\"#\">Text</a></div>\n\n\n.title {\n            height:100px;\n            width:200px; \n            background-image:url(title.png);\n            background-repeat: no-repeat;\n          }\n\n```\n.title a { \n    display:block; \n    text-indent: -9999px;\n}\n```\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Hi Kyle,\n\nI'm not sure that display:inline-block works in IE. For what it's worth, the following will work cross-browser:\n\n<pre>\n<code>\n\n.title {\n    width:524px; \n    height:82px;\n    background-image:url(title.png);\n    background-repeat: no-repeat;\n}\n\n.title a, .title a span { display:block; }\n.title a span { text-indent: -9999px; }\n\n</code>\n</pre>\n\n\nNote: Using your same HTML\n\nBest of luck.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Ah, good. Glad it's working now.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Hi,\n\nA couple of questions:\n- Which version of FF are you using?\n- Do you have an example url that I could look at?\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Hmmm...that's strange. It seems to work for me. Is there an example online that I can look at?\n. Hi Keith,\n\nThanks for the kind words about backstretch. Much appreciated.\n\nYes, the plugin does center the image. If you want to turn that off, use the centeredX and centeredY options, and set them to 'false.'  That will align the image from the top-left. Unfortunately, the plugin doesn't support aligning from the bottom or bottom-right. Though, if you're comfortable with JavaScript, then it should be easy to fork this project and make the necessary changes.\n\nhttp://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/blob/master/README.textile\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Hi Keith,\n\nI believe that if you just change the <code>bgCSS = {left: 0, top: 0}</code> to <code>bgCSS = {left: 0, bottom: 0}</code> in the <code>_adjustBG</code> function, and set centeredX and centeredY to 'false,' that it will work as you'd like. Though, I haven't tested it.\n\nUnfortunately, beyond this reply, I won't be able to help any further. Best of luck.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Thanks, Jako. That's good to know.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Hi,\n\nI'm not sure why it isn't working, but I'd recommend making the page validate first. It looks like there are a few errors, and those might be causing the odd behavior.\n\nhttp://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fdevelop.cellsignals.ca%2Findex3.php&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. Agreed. That would be awesome, but I think it's beyond the scope of this plugin. Still, a great idea.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. I agree with ryken's assessment of it being a browser rendering issue, less so than the plugin itself. There are also a bunch of CSS-only solutions out there that might be more well-suited, if performance is an issue.\n. Hi,\n\nSorry for not replying sooner. Were you able to sort this out, or is it still an issue?\n\n\u2013Scott\n. You can probably put the following in your print stylesheet to hide backstretch.\n\n<pre><code>\n#backstretch { display: none !important; }\n</code></pre>\n. I've just posted a new version of jQuery Backstretch, one that should allow you to call the plugin multiple times, replacing the existing image. It's version 1.2-beta, and is available in the downloads section.\n. Hi,\n\nYou can always change backstretch's image by using the following bit of code:\n\n<code>\n\n<pre>\n$(\"#backstretch img\").attr(\"src\", \"/path/to/new/image.jpg\");\n</pre>\n\n</code>\n\nNote: the image should be the same size or heigh/width ratio as the previous image.\n\nHope that helps.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. Hi,\n\nThis has already been discussed in the following thread:\n\nhttps://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/issuesearch?state=closed&q=slideshow#issue/5\n\nHope that helps.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. Consolidating this issue with another which appears to be related:\n\nhttps://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/issues/45\n. I'm not sure I entirely understand the setup here. That said, there are a couple of ways to handle multiple pages:\n1. Use if/else statements to load backstretch. i.e. if($(\"body#about\"))....else if($(\"body#contact\")...\n2. Just replace the backstretch image directly: $(\"#backstretch img\").attr(\"src\", \"/path/to/new.jpg\")\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. I've just released a new version of Backstretch that should make it easier to replace images. It's version 1.2-beta on the downloads page. Hope that helps.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. The problem that you had run into was that SVG requires an \"embed\" tag, whereas Backstretch appends an \"img\" tag. I don't think it would be too difficult for you to modify the plugin to suit your SVG needs. I'd recommend taking a look at this fork of Backstretch, where someone appends the HTML5 video tag:\n\nhttps://github.com/mpezzi/jquery-backstretch/commit/e904bd26b689d15c1a7e5bcfd513d5aa3c82bb92\n. I'm adding a few more digits to the backstretch z-index in an upcoming release. Hopefully, this resolves the problem.\n. Hi Mike,\n\nI'm very sorry for not replying to this months ago. I've always found the fadeIn function to be a bit buggy. The image itself should load, but not be displayed.\n\nIf this is still a pertinent issue, please send along a link to a live demo, and I'll look into it.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. I just posted a new version of Backstretch that uses, amongst other things, a different way to calculate the image width and height. I've heard from others that this helps resolve Webkit issues. Would someone here mind downloading version 1.2-beta, and letting me know if it fixes the issue above? Also, if anyone has access to IE version, and wouldn't mind helping with cross-browser testing, I would very, very much appreciate the assistance.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. Thanks for testing this. I'll take a look and see what's going on with IE7. IE6 might be a lost cause. I don't plan to support it, but if someone can suggest a fix for that one, I'd be happy to include it.\n\nRob, as for 1.1.2, that version does not support the ability to use the slideshow demo, only 1.2.\n\nI'll take a look at this, and get back to you all. Thanks, again.\n. Hi Everyone,\n\nI just pushed a new version of 1.2.0 beta that should fix the IE problems. Please take a look, and let me know if it does/doesn't work for you.\n\nthanks,\nScott\n. Thanks, everyone. I really appreciate your help.\n. Not currently, though I don't image it'd be hard to fork the plugin and make a version that binds to something other than body. Take a look near line 50, where the content is prepended to body. I'd suggest making a version of the plugin where the container name gets passed in via the options.\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\u2013Scott \n. It looks like you forgot to include the script tag for Backstretch itself. It should go after Google's jQuery script tag, but before you actually call Backstretch.\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/904748\n. You'll need to change to \"/path/to/jquery.backstretch.js\" location to the actual location of the backstretch file.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. Not necessarily, though there's nothing that prevents you from calling the backstretch plugin on each individual page. Or, you can always change the $(\"#backstretch img).attr(\"src\", \"...\") midstream.\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Normally, I would be a proponent for adding an Alt tag, but I don't think it needs one in this case. Backstretch is meant to be a alternate to a body's background image. Background images do not get alt tags, they are meant to be visual decorators only. That said, if you really would like to add an alt tag, I'd recommend doing so by manipulating the \"#backstretch img\" DOM element with jQuery itself, after backstretch has been loaded.\n. Thanks for letting me know. I'm going to add a few more default styles, in an upcoming release, to deal with this.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. Hi cmebd,\n\nSorry for the delay in replying.\n\nNo, right now it's not an option in jQuery Backstretch, though you're free to override any of the CSS yourself. Just add any new attributes to your stylesheet, and use the \"!important\" declarative to override the default behavior.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. I'm not sure if there's a good way to do that. My recommendation would be to hide the #backstretch DIV in the media queries for the smaller screens. As for load time, backstretch waits until the page is loaded before performing the stretch, so it shouldn't really affect the initial rendering time. It might be a little extra taxing on their post-load bandwidth, but that's another story...\n. Hi Anne,\n\nThat's very clever. Thank you for writing it, and for sharing.\n\nI plan to rewrite Backstretch soon, adding a few new features. I'll definitely keep this in mind.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. Try pulling the latest files from the repository. I just added the ability to replace the Backstretch image by calling it again, and provided an example of how to do so onclick. Let me know if you run into any issues.\n\nhttps://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/zipball/1.2-beta\n. Do you have a link that you could share with me, so I take a look at it?\n. Great. Yes, it's possible to do so. It's very similar to the code in the button example. If you want to prevent the default click behavior from happening, you just have to add a bit of extra code to stop it.\n\n```\n$('a.whatever-class').click(function(e) {\n   e.preventDefault();\n   $.backstretch('/path/to/next/img.jpg');\n});\n```\n. I seem to be able to reproduce this on Chrome on first load. Does the slideshow work if you refresh the page a second time?\n. Try using the latest version of Backstretch. I'm not sure why the older version isn't working for you, but I tested the new one, and it seems to resolve the issue.\n\nhttps://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/zipball/1.2.0-b2\n. I think you might be experiencing the same issue that we're seeing over here:\n\nhttps://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/issues/45#issuecomment-1570034\n\nIf you're interested in using the plugin immediately, I recommend using version 1.1.2. That one is stable, though you won't be able to use the onClick or slideshow functionality/examples.\n. I think I figured out the problem. Take a look at this, and let me know if looks OK in IE:\n\nhttp://srobbin.com/demos/jquery-backstretch/\n. Great! I updated to v1.2.1, so you should be able to download it now.\n. Hi,\n\nI just tried it out on Opera 11 for OS X, and it seems to work fine.\n\nhttp://srobbin.com/demos/jquery-backstretch/examples/slideshow.html\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Hi Fetz,\n\nI think the issue had something to do with the img:last selector that I was using in the _adjustBG function. I've since removed it, and it appears to have fixed the problem. Can you please download the most recent version of Backstretch, and see if it's resolved for you as well?\n\nThanks,\nScott\n. Hi Matt,\n\nI think the iPad/iPhone issue may have been a bug, and should be fixed in the latest version. Not the downloadable version 1.2.1, but the most recent commit, version 1.2.2. Here's a link, if you'd like to try it out.\n\nhttps://raw.github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/master/jquery.backstretch.min.js\n\nAnd, a link to preview it on your iPad:\n\nhttp://srobbin.com/demos/jquery-backstretch/examples/basic.html\n\nLet me know if that works.\n\n\u2013Scott\n\nNote: iOS5 supports fixed position. The issue above was related to a bug in which the background didn't stretch to the entire height.\n. Hi stokedesign,\n\niOS4 does not support \"position:fixed,\" which is what locks the background in place. The fullscreen scrolling background is a fallback, and still looks quite nice, I think. I'm not sure if there are any other fullscreen background plugins that attempt to fix this.\n\nBest of luck,\nScott\n. Thanks for posting this fix.\n. Hi Luca-Gianni,\n\nThe easiest thing to do might be to add a CSS rule:\n\n#backstretch { margin-left: 150px !important; }\n\nThough, you'll probably notice that this approach will clip the image on the righthand side during the stretch. If that's not a problem, then this is a simple solution. If that irks you, then recoding _adjustBG to take into account the margin width should do the trick.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. Hi Luca,\n\nI think it would just be a matter of taking the margin into account when calculating the height/width of the stretch, but I'd have to look into it further. If you're interested in me helping write a customized version of the plugin, I'd be happy to do so. That's part of what I offer with Premium Support (link at the bottom of http://srobbin.com/blog/jquery-plugins/jquery-backstretch/).\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. Hi Frederico,\n\nI'd recommend doing something like this:\n\n``` javascript\nvar images = [\n    \"image1.jpg\",\n    \"image2.jpg\",\n    \"image3.jpg\"\n];\n\nvar index = 0;\n$.backstretch(images[index], {speed: 500});\n\nvar slideshow = setInterval(function() {\n    index = (index >= images.length - 1) ? 0 : index + 1;\n    $.backstretch(images[index]);\n}, 5000);\n\n$(\"a.clickable\").click(function(e) {\n    // Prevent the click from actually following the href\n    e.preventDefault();\n\n    // Stop the slideshow\n    clearInterval(slideshow);\n\n    // Backstretch\n    $.backstretch( $(this).attr(\"href\") );\n});\n```\n\nAnd, then for your thumbnails, I'd make them look like this:\n\n``` html\n<a class=\"clickable\" href=\"image1.jpg\"><img src=\"image1_thumb.jpg\"/></a>\n<a class=\"clickable\" href=\"image2.jpg\"><img src=\"image2_thumb.jpg\"/></a>\n<a class=\"clickable\" href=\"image3.jpg\"><img src=\"image3_thumb.jpg\"/></a>\n```\n\nAs you can see, there's now a \"clickable\" class, so that all of your links can share the same code. Also, I've added the image that you want to backstretch to as the href tag. This way, if JavaScript fails, it will still link the user to that image.\n\nHope you find this helpful. If you need any additional help, please consider purchasing Premium Support for Backstretch (located at the bottom of the page).\n\nhttp://srobbin.com/blog/jquery-plugins/jquery-backstretch/\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. Unfortunately, it's not something that this plugin will do for you. Though, if you're comfortable with JavaScript, I'm sure you'll be able to adapt most of the plugin's code for your use in something that would work on DIVs.\n\nBest of luck,\nScott\n. Hi fsjsy,\n\nIt's possible for you to show a loading indicator, apply backstretch, and then pass in a callback function to hide the loading indicator. That said, I think it would be much easier to have jQuery preload the images for you. I've updated the slideshow example to include preloading code:\n\nhttps://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/blob/master/examples/slideshow.html\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Hi,\n\nI'm not sure what you mean? You can always calculate the image path before passing it in.\n\n``` javascript\nvar someImage = $(\"#an-image\");\n$.backsretch(someImage.src);\n```\n. Try:\n\n``` javascript\n(function($) { \n    jQuery(document).ready(function() {\n        var someImage = $(\"img#BGImage\");\n        $.backstretch(someImage.attr(\"src\"));\n    });\n})(jQuery);\n```\n. Try using \"jQuery\" instead of the \"$\":\n\n``` javascript\njQuery.backstretch(\"/path/to/your.jpg\");\n```\n. It looks right to me.\n\nRegarding further help, if you're interested in purchasing Premium Support for Backstretch, I can help you troubleshoot this further. Premium Support is was helps fund development of the product for me.\n\nhttp://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/jquery-backstretch/\n\n(Link at the bottom of the page)\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. That's very cool. Unfortunately, I don't think this is something that I'd, personally, be able to help with. Though, if you're interested in customizing the plugin yourself, feel free to fork it. I think this would be a neat mashup.\n\nAlso, if you're looking for some direction, I'd recommend playing with the Instagram plugin's onComplete function.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. There are a few pull requests, and forks of Backstretch, that implement this feature.\n. Thanks, Sascha. I appreciate you putting so much work into this. I look forward to hearing from you again, soon.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Sorry for not having addressed this long ago. If I'm understanding Require.js correctly, you should just be able to use this via the standard `require()` dependency call.\n. With the current version of Backstretch, you could do the following:\n\n``` javascript\n$.backstretch(\"photo.jpg\")\n\n$(window).on(\"backstretch.show\", function () {\n  $(\"#loading\").hide();\n});\n```\n. Hi JL,\n\nThere's a speed parameter that you can pass in to Backstretch that controls the fadeIn of an image.  e.g...\n\n``` javascript\n$.backstretch(\"/path/to/image.jpg\", {speed: 150});\n```\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Hi mat5hias,\n\nYou'd want to modify the code near setInterval, and use clearInterval once you've made your way through all of the images:\n\nhttp://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_setinterval.asp\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. With the most recent version of Backstretch, you could do the following:\n\n``` javascript\n$(window).on(\"backstretch.show\", function (e, instance) {\n  $(\"#loading\").hide();\n});\n```\n. It's a holdover from pre-iOS5 days. iOS4 didn't have fixed positioning, so the absolute positioning and large rendering was a fallback. Now that iOS5 supports position:fixed, Backstretch should be more intelligent.\n. Here's an attempt at a version that detects fixed positioning:\n\nhttps://raw.github.com/gist/1755245/c8a7e44ae2251921e7a6b6593f00ecf50600a510/gistfile1.js\n\nWould you mind checking to see if this works for you? If so, would you have some time to help me cross-browser test?\n. Thanks for doing all of this testing. Is the page you're testing on publicly viewable? If so, would you mind send a link to me?\n. Yeah, I did some more investigating. The method I was using to query for fixed positioning isn't right. \n. Unfortunately, not yet. All of the solutions that I've found require you to wait at least 500ms after the page loads. I'm not quite keen on doing it that way. I'll keep digging, and see if there's a better way.\n. I believe that I have a release that works correctly in iOS5 with fixed positioning, and falls back to absolute positioning in iOS4. Would anyone be interested in helping me test this?\n\nhttps://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/zipball/1.2.6b\n. Hi Derek,\n\nDo you have a link to a page that has 1.2.7 on it?

Ah, I see what's happening. There's a style on your page that's setting the max-width of all images (for responsiveness, I assume):\n\nimg {\n  max-width: 100%;\n}\n\nI'd recommend either making that style more specific (e.g. img.scale), or adding another style for Backstretch:\n\n#backsretch img {\n  max-width: none;\n}\n\nHope that helps. \n\n## \n\nScott Robbin\nshort: twitter.com/srobbin\nlong: srobbin.com\n\nOn Thursday, May 10, 2012 at 4:29 PM, Derek Hogue wrote:\n\n> OK, here's a link: [http://thepublicstudio.ca](http://thepublicstudio.ca).

Thanks so much.\n. Hi Everyone,\n\nI've got a new version of Backstretch in progress that adds this functionality, and makes it easier to do slideshows. Would you mind taking a look, giving it a spin, and letting me know if you have any troubles or thoughts?\n\nThank you, again, to @timnovinger for submitting his excellent patch, and for inspiring this thread. I chose to refactor much of the plugin, so his changes couldn't be merged, though they were very helpful in guiding the implementation.\n\nhttps://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/tree/2.0.0-wip\n. The latest version of Backstretch has support for slideshows, along with cross-fading. (Sorry, I know this is an old issue, but I wanted to address it before closing the ticket.)\n. Yes, admittedly, the slideshow code is not very good. From the looks of it, the plugin is rebinding to the window resize event every time a new slide is loaded. Obviously, this shouldn't be the case.\n\nI'm currently working on a new version of Backstretch, and will make sure this doesn't happen. Thanks for the heads-up.\n. Thanks so much for looking into that. I really appreciate you letting me know about this.\n. Hi Urs,\n\nThanks for supporting Backstretch, and my apologies for not responding\nsooner.

The latest version of Backstretch will allow you to attach an image to any block-level element. So, it should just be a matter of creating your `#frame`, then adding Backstretch to it: `$(\"#frame\").backstretch(\"image.jpg\")`.\n. That sounds about right to me, though I'd be careful with callbacks attached to the resize event. It gets called quite a bit.\n. @vladmu, that's a great point, thank you. I'm currently working on a new version of the plugin, and have been more careful about passing about this. In the new version, I'm opting to fire an event when the image is changed rather than registering a callback. If you have any interest in looking over the code, I'd love your feedback.\n\nhttps://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/tree/2.0.0-wip\n. I apologize for not replying to this long ago. Backstretch is currently at v2.0.2. I hope that it has been resolved in the most recent version.\n. I believe that this issue had been resolved with v2 of Backstretch. If this continues to be an issue for anyone, please feel free to comment or reopen.\n. Typically, if you're going to link to a resource that will be accessed through both HTTP and HTTPS, you can leave the protocol off.\n\nIn other words, this:\n\n<img src=\"http://example.com/image.jpg\" >\n\nbecomes this:\n\n<img src=\"//example.com/image.jpg\" >\n\nThat way, it will use whatever protocol, HTTP or HTTPS, that the calling page uses.\n\nIn the case of Backstretch, you could write:\n\n$.backstretch(\"//example.com/image.jpg\"); \n\nOn Wednesday, May 30, 2012 at 7:20 PM, neucart wrote: \n\n> I don't really know how to explain this best, so I'll just jot some notes here:\n> \n> 1) A customer's site is HTTP and uses backstretch.

If you've got a staging server where you re-post the code, I'd be happy to take a look with you.\n. I believe that someone has forked Backstretch, and added video capabilities, though I can't recall which fork it was:\n\nhttps://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/network\n. Isn't that the old joke?\n\nPatient: Doctor, it hurts when I do this.\nDoctor: Then don't do that.\n\nI'm not sure why transform would override Backstretch working, but if you provide a link to a page where you have this setup, I'll take a look. \n. It might work to put the translateZ on an element that wraps everything within the body, instead of the body itself. e.g.:\n\n``` css\n.wrap { -webkit-transform: translateZ(0); }\n```\n\n``` html\n<body>\n  <div class=\"wrap\">\n    .. all of the other elements...\n  </div>\n</body>\n```\n. Thanks for bringing this to my attention. Someone had mentioned this before, but I was remiss to include a fix. I've just posted Backstretch version 1.2.8 that now has a max-width: none declaration.\n\nCheers.\n. In the newest version of Backstretch, you can do the following:\n\n``` javascript\n$(window).on(\"backstretch.show\", function (e, instance) {\n  // If we wanted to stop the slideshow after it reached the end\n  if (instance.index === instance.images.length - 1) {\n    instance.pause();\n  };\n});\n```\n. There's a fork of Backstretch where a minimum width option was added:\n\nhttps://github.com/noahstokes/jquery-backstretch\n\nHope that helps.\n. What slider are you referring to?\n. Yes, all of the examples on the website, including the slideshow, use remote images.\n. Unfortunately, you will not be able to do that with JavaScript. You will need to use a server-side language, like PHP, Python, or Ruby, to read the file system directory and output the necessary HTML.\n\nBest of luck,\nScott\n. No, I'm sorry, Backstretch will not distort the image to fit the entire window size. I'd recommend either investigating another plugin, or using pure CSS to do so.\n. The latest version of Backstretch has a much easier way of implementing slideshows. I recommend checking it out.\n. I am just going through, closing old issues, and noticed that this hadn't been address. Sorry.\n\nI tested Backstretch on FF 13, and didn't see the issue on the example pages, so I am going to assume that this may have just been a site-specific issue. If anyone notices a similar issue, please feel free to comment or reopen this ticket.\n. It looks like horizontal scrollbar is being caused by the text-indent attribute of #header h1 a. If you comment that out, you should see the horizontal scrollbar go away.\n\nBest of luck,\nScott\n. Hello,\n\nPlease accept my apologies for not addressing your issue when you submitted it long ago. With the current version of Backstretch, you can attach background images to any block-level element like so:\n\n``` javascript\n$(\"#presentation\").backstretch(\"path/to/presentation.jpg\");\n$(\"#services\").backstretch(\"path/to/services.jpg\");\n$(\"#contact\").backstretch(\"path/to/contact.jpg\");\n```\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Hi Nick,\n\nBackstretch doesn't support easing by default, but if you're comfortable with modifying the plugin, then it should be easy to add in yourself. The \"fadeIn\" function is located around Line 122. You could change it to add in easing.\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Currently, no, unless you're interested in modifying the plugin code itself. The fadeIn function is located around Line 122.\n\nThat said, I'm working on a new version of the plugin, and had considered externalizing the transition, allowing you to pass in your own as an option. e.g.\n\n``` javascript\n$.backstretch(\"path/to/image.jpg\", {\n  transition: function (image1, image2) {\n    // You'd write your own transition here\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIf that sounds appealing, and you have any interest in helping code it, I'd love to collaborate and/or hear your feedback.\n. Hi,\n\nFirst off, I'd recommend trying to reducing your original image to much less than a few MB. I try to reduce the images I use to ~500KB, if possible.\n\nThat said, I can definitely see why you'd want to limit the size of the image for an iPhone. I'd recommend using JavaScript to select the right-size image, before passing it into Backstretch. e.g.:\n\n``` javascript\nvar small = 'path/to/small.jpg' \n  , large = 'path/to/large.jpg'\n  , img = window.screen.width <= 480 ? small : large;\n\n$.backstretch(img);\n```\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Hi,\n\nIt looks like you're including Backstretch twice, once before jQuery has been downloaded. Try this instead:\n\n``` html\n<script src=\"Scripts/jquery-1.7.1.min.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n<script src=\"Scripts/jquery-1.3.2.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n<script src=\"Scripts/jquery.backstretch.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    $(document).ready(function () {\n        $.backstretch('http://dl.dropbox.com/u/515046/www/outside.jpg');\n    });\n</script>\n```\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Hi Vladimir,\n\nNot that I'm aware of, unless you're interested in forking the project, and replacing the fadeIn call around Line 228.\n\nBest of luck,\nScott\n. Hi,\n\nSorry if the repo is confusing. I'll look into updating the documentation to be more clear. Here's the basic HTML you'll need to include:\n\n``` html\n<script src=\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.2/jquery.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"jquery.backstretch.min.js\"></script>\n<script>\n  // To attach Backstrech as the body's background\n  $.backstretch(\"path/to/image.jpg\");\n</script>\n```\n\nIn other words, you'll need to include jQuery and the jquery.backstretch.min.js file, then call Backstretch itself.\n. That's correct, by \"then call Backstretch itself\" I was referring this:\n\n``` html\n<script>\n  // To attach Backstretch as the body's background\n  $.backstretch(\"path/to/image.jpg\");\n</script>\n```\n. Sorry about that. It should have been checked in the opposite direction:\n\n```\n$(this).fadeIn(self.options.speed || self.options.fade, function () {\n```\n\nTake a look at the latest version of Backstretch (v2.0.1), and let me know if that fixed the problem.\n. Hi,\n\nYou could always randomly choose the image via JavaScript before passing it into Backstretch:\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/3799775\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Once Backstretch has been called, the only way to change images is to call Backstretch again (which you're allowed to do). So, you'll probably want to create your own slideshow logic. There was some code in v1.2.8 that might be helpful to you. It uses `setInterval` and single calls to Backstretch:\n\nhttps://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/zipball/1.2.8\n\nBest of luck,\nScott\n. Sorry for the delay in responding. Unfortunately, no, this isn't something that falls within the scope of Premium Support.\n\nBest of luck,\nScott\n. Hello,\n\nI apologize for not commenting on this issue sooner. The Backstretch documentation refers to the \"show\" method, where you can pass an index of the slide that you would like to see. e.g.:\n\n``` javascript\nvar $navs = $(\".nav a\");\n$navs.click(function () {\n  var index = $navs.index( $(this) );\n\n  // Get the instance of Backstretch\n  // Since you called it as $.backstretch, it's attached to the body\n  var instance = $(\"body\").data(\"backstretch\");\n\n  // Show the slide based on the clicked index\n  instance.show(index);\n\n  // Return false, so that the click doesn't change the page hash\n  return false;\n});\n```\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Are you using a caching plugin your website, like WP Super Cache?\n. Can you please post a link to your site, to the page that is supposed to be disabled?\n. I think there may be a few issues here. Backstretch may not be working due to some HTML errors. You can see them here:\n\nhttp://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fnowinmotion.org%2Fwordpress%2F&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0\n\nAlso, your site seems to have been hacked. If you view the source code from that page, you'll see a bunch of spam links at the top.\n\nRegarding the Backstretch plugin, unfortunately that's not something that I developer or have any control of. Hopefully, the developer will respond to you soon.\n\nUnfortunately, all of these issues fall outside the scope of the Backstretch plugin itself, so I'm going to close this ticket.\n\nBest of luck,\nScott\n. Try calling Backstretch after the document is ready:\n\n``` javascript\n$(document).ready(function () {\n  $.backstretch(\n    bgImages,\n    { \n      fade: 750,\n      duration: 4000\n    }\n  );\n});\n```\n. Hi,\n\nUnfortunately, that's a side effect of calculating the window height on iOS. The window has to be scrolled down. Here's the bit of the source code that's doing the scrolling. Feel free to update it if you find a better solution:\n\n``` javascript\n/*\n * Scroll the page one pixel to get the right window height on iOS\n * Pretty harmless for everyone else\n*/\nif ($(window).scrollTop() === 0 ) {\n  window.scrollTo(0, 0);\n}\n```\n\n\u2013Scott\n. If you're not interested in modifying the plugin yourself, you can access the index variable directly through the index. e.g.:\n\n``` javascript\n$(\"body\").data(\"backstretch\").index;\n```\n\nOr, if you've used Backstretch on a block-level element:\n\n``` javascript\n$(\".foo\").data(\"backstretch\").index;\n```\n. Hi,\n\nI think you should be able to detect the pixel ratio before passing Backstretch the image(s). e.g:\n\n``` javascript\nvar images;\n\nif (window.devicePixelRatio > 1) {\n  images = [\n    'path/to/largerImage.jpg',\n    'path/to/largerImage2.jpg'\n  ];\n} else {\n  images = [\n    'path/to/smallerImage.jpg',\n    'path/to/smallerImage2.jpg'\n  ];\n}\n\n$.backstretch(images);\n```\n\nOr something like that.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Yes, it was dropped in favor of using custom events. You can now subscribe to a \"backstretch.show\" event to be notified when the image has been placed.\n\nOn Oct 9, 2012, at 3:59 PM, Krzysztof Tomasz Zembrowski notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Hi Scott,\n> \n> what happened to the callback?\n> Was it dropped in version 2.0?\n> \n> Already saw:\n> srobbin/jquery-backstretch#63\n> srobbin/jquery-backstretch#76\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n.

Hello,\n\nThanks for your feedback and suggestion. I think the easiest way to do this might be to order the array before passing it into Backstretch. e.g.:\n\n``` javascript\n// Original call\nvar images = [\n  'image1.jpg',\n  'image2.jpg',\n  'image3.jpg',\n  'image4.jpg'\n];\n$.backstretch(images);\n\n// Let's say you want to start at index 2 instead of 0,\n// it might be easier to put things in order before passing in to Backstretch\nvar images = [\n  'image3.jpg',\n  'image4.jpg',\n  'image1.jpg',\n  'image2.jpg'\n];\n$.backstretch(images);\n```\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Hello,\n\nYou can change the image by calling Backstretch on the original block-level element again, like so:\n\n``` javascript\n$(\"#thumb-gallery a\").click(function(e) {\n  // Prevent the click from actually following the href\n  e.preventDefault();\n  // Backstretch\n  $(\"#background-image.slideshow\").backstretch( $(this).attr(\"href\") );\n});\n```\n. Thanks for submitting the pull request. At this time, I'm not going to add the options to the repo, but I'll keep it in mind for future versions of Backstretch. And, I know that others who want to provide min-height and min-width options will appreciate having this as an example.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. Hi Stefan,\n\nThanks for the pull request. I hadn't documented this before, but you can always access the images array through your instance. I've updated the documentation to make this more apparent.\n\n``` javascript\n$('.foo').backstretch([\n  'path/to/image.jpg',\n  'path/to/image2.jpg',\n  'path/to/image3.jpg'\n]);\n\n// Access the instance\nvar instance = $('.foo').data('backstretch');\n\n// Then, you can manipulate the images array directly\ninstance.images.push('path/to/image4.jpg')\n```\n. Hello,\n\nSorry for not replying sooner. It looks like this issue has been resolved. If it hasn't, please feel free to reopen this issue.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Backstretch needs jQuery v1.7 or higher. It looks like you're running v1.4.2. Trying upgrading jQuery, and see if that resolves the issue.\n. Hello,\n\nUnfortunately, I don't have an alternate version that supports older versions of jQuery. That said, I imagine you could modify the script yourself pretty easily, replacing the \"on/off\" calls with \"bind/unbind\".\n\nBest of luck,\nScott\n. Hi David,\n\nThanks for providing this pull request. I don't think I'll be adding it to the repo at this time, but I will definitely keep it in consideration for a future version of Backstretch. And, I know that the others will appreciate having this an example.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. It kind of depends on whether you're attaching Backstretch to the body or a block-level element. For example's sake, let's say it's the body:\n\n``` javascript\nvar images = [\n  \"/path/to/image1.jpg\",\n  \"/path/to/image2.jpg\",\n  \"/path/to/image3.jpg\"\n];\n\n// Start Backstretch, and save a reference to it.\n// Note: this is the part that would be different if you were attaching Backstretch to a block-level element\nvar slideshow = $.backstretch(images);\n\n// Let's say you had a link with an id of \"next\"\n$(\"#next\").click(function (e) {\n  // Prevent the link's default behavior\n  e.preventDefault();\n\n  // Call next on Backstretch\n  slideshow.next();\n});\n```\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Hello,\n\nFrom what I can tell, it looks like this issue has been resolved. If you are still experiencing troubles with Backstretch, feel free to reopen the issue.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. Hello,\n\nI just took a look at the website, and it seems as though you've resolved this problem. I'm going to close this issue. Please feel free to reopen it if you are still experiencing troubles.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Yeah, I'm seeing this too. I'll take a look at it.\n. Can you please give this a try, and see if it a) fixes the flicker and b) doesn't mess up the slideshow in any other browser?\n\nhttps://raw.github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/wip/src/jquery.backstretch.js\n\nThanks,\nScott\n. Thanks, Brett! I really appreciate you taking a look at this\n. Hello,\n\nThe plugin should listen for a resize event on its container (including block-level elements), so I'm not sure why it would only be firing on a window resize. That said, you can always manually force a resize like so:\n\n``` javascript\n// Call backstretch\n$(\"#element\").backstretch(\"/path/to/image.jpg\");\n\n// Access the Backstretch instance\nvar instance = $(\"#element\").data(\"backstretch\");\n\n// Call the resize method\ninstance.resize();\n```\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. I've tested this on a few machines and sites, and I can't seem to reproduce the problem. Backstretch (both older and current versions) uses jQuery's standard fadeIn function. The only potential issue that I could see is if a fadeIn was occurring during a window resize.\n\nI'm going to close this for now, but feel free to reopen it if you have any additional information, or if anyone else experiences a similar issue.\n. Unfortunately, I can't seem to replicate the issue viewing your site on my computer. I don't think v2 of Backstretch will resolve the issue, since it's also using the same fadeIn method. Sorry.\n. Ah, that may be why I wasn't seeing it. I was testing on FF 17 on OS X 10.8.\n\nI can't say for certain, but I imagine that it has something to do with fadeIn of a large image (as opposed to HTML fade-ins), and the way that XP handles that calculation. Maybe in Vista and beyond it's done through hardware acceleration?\n\nFortunately, the number of users on Windows XP using FF 17 is probably very small.\n. Typically, I've seen that error when the Backstretch script is not included in a page before the plugin is called, either because it failed to download, was included in the wrong order. If you provide a link to the site in question, I can take a look for you.\n\nSecondarily, it looks like you're missing the closing parenthesis on your `$(document).ready()` call. I don't think this is the cause of the issue, but still something that you'll want to update.\n. Hello,\n\nIt looks like you're including jQuery twice, one on Line 52:\n\n``` html\n<script type='text/javascript' src='http://beta.albertorivero.com/wp-content/themes/ReverieRiverov1/js/jquery.js?ver=3.4.2'></script>\n```\n\nAnd again on Line 251 as part of this script:\n\n``` html\n<script type='text/javascript' src='http://beta.albertorivero.com/wp-content/themes/ReverieRiverov1/js/foundation.min.js?ver=3.4.2'></script>\n```\n\nSince Backstretch is included before line 251, when the page loads the second version of jQuery, it overwrites the previous instance, including all references to previously installed plugins. So, by the time you execute `$(document).ready()`, Backstretch is no longer installed.\n\nAt some point, you should look into removing this duplication, but for the sake of fixing your Backstretch errors, the easiest thing for you to do would be to move the Backstretch include and any references to it below Line 251.\n\nBest of luck,\nScott\n. Usually, that error is associated with the Backstretch plugin itself not loading, either from not being found, or being included too late in the page.\n\nCan you please send me a link to the page that you're trying to implement this on? I can take a look.\n. Is there a way for you to link to external javascript file, rather than including the Backstretch plugin inline? It looks like that's what you've done inside of the `<customhtml>` block. And, from what I can tell, that's what is causing the error.\n. For right now, no, but very soon it should be listed on http://cdnjs.com/.\n. Hello,\n\nThanks so much for your pull request. Especially for including a test. I really need to starting making more of those!\n\nQuestion: what is the advantage of having Backstretch fire a resize event, as opposed to listening to the same resize event that Backstretch listens to. e.g. $.backstretch() listens for $(window).resize() events, and $(\"#foo\").backstretch() listens for resize events on #foo.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. It looks like Safari 5.0 does not like max-width of Backstretch's image set to \"none\". I put that attribute in there to prevent issues associated with Bootstrap, and other responsive queries that set max-width to 100%.\n\nIf you need Safari 5.0 support, and don't have any responsive img conflicts, you can remove that attribute. It is set on Line 91 of the uncompressed script.\n\nAlso, if you have any solutions better than that one I'm using, please feel free to submit a pull request.\n. Hello, Simon,\n\nThanks for the suggestion. I just submitted the pull request.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. Unfortunately, that functionality falls outside the scope of what Backstretch is meant to do. That said, here is a bit of code that should push you in the right direction:\n\n``` javascript\n$(\".backstretch\").on(\"click\", function () {\n  document.location.href = \"http://example.com\";\n});\n```\n. For iOS devices, you'll need to set the viewport width:\n\nhttp://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/UsingtheViewport/UsingtheViewport.html\n\nYou can try the simplest one, and tweak accordingly for your needs:\n\n``` html\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width\">\n```\n. You can add that pretty easily using the \"fade\" parameter. It takes integers, or jQuery speed strings. e.g.\n\n``` javascript\n$.backstretch(\"/path/to/image.jpg\", { fade: \"slow\" });\n```\n\nThe reason this isn't enabled by default is for legacy continuity. The original versions of Backstretch didn't fade in, and I thought it would be jarring to have someone upgrade, and experience something unexpected.\n. Hello. I took a look in FF 12 (Mac), and didn't see any issues. What version of FF are you testing, and on what OS version (e.g. Mountain Lion).\n\nAlso, when you say \"the background from the left column\" are you referring to the backstretched image, or the content area? If you can attach a screenshot to this issue, that would be helpful.\n. I just updated to FF17 on 10.8.2, and it had no problems. To me, it looks like the left column's background is intact, and in place (you can see a defined white line). It almost looks as though the fade in of the Backstretch image didn't complete. Can you try setting the fade variable to 0, so that there isn't a fadeIn, and see if you still notice the issue.\n. I'm going to close out this ticket, but if anyone else experiences the same issue, please comment/reopen. Thanks.\n. Hi Teva,\n\nYou can always call Backstretch again, and pass in a new image value. That should stop any existing slideshow/backstretch, and display the image. e.g.\n\n``` html\n<a class=\"gallery\" href=\"/path/to/image.jpg\">Gallery link</a>\n\n<script>\n  $(\"a.gallery\").click(function (e) {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    var imageSrc = $(this).attr(\"href\");\n    $.backstretch(imageSrc);\n  });\n</script>\n```\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. It's hard to say what's going on without see it in context, but my first guess is that Backstretch doesn't like that the parent container has a \"backstretch\" class. The plugin itself creates a DIV with the class \"backstretch\" and inserts it into the container. Try renaming your container class to \"backstretch-container\" or the liked, and see if that fixes the problem.\n\nIf that doesn't work, please post a link to the page in question, and I'll take a look.\n. Or the simplest:\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n\nThe other that you've suggested, with multiple if statements, is convenient for conditional CSS/JS (http://html5boilerplate.com/). I wouldn't recommend using an HTML 4 or XML 1 declaration. \n. Hello, Claudio,\n\nWhat you're seeing is probably the correct behavior. Backstretch resizes the image to fit your browser window, but depending on the proportions of the window, the image will either be wider or taller, cropping the edges.\n\nIf you're looking for something that doesn't crop the image, and compatibility with older browsers isn't an issue, I recommend looking at the background-size CSS property.\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Thanks, Zeke.\n. It's outside the scope of this plugin, but if you're comfortable editing the source, I recommend looking at the resize function around Line 166. That's where the logic is for setting the size/position.\n. I'd recommend checking out [Hammer.js](http://eightmedia.github.com/hammer.js/). It can help you capture swipe events, which you can then use to trigger .next() or .prev() calls on the Backstretch instance.\n. @pepperstreet: that's very thorough, thank you. What site were you using for your tests?\n\nRegarding iOS, versions prior to 5 don't support \"position: fixed\", so what you're seeing is a fallback solution. iOS5 and beyond should function as expected.\n\nRegarding Android, I'm at the mercy of testing on BrowserStack as well. From what I can deduce from the emulation tests, the problem appears to be isolated to 4.1. @chrisantonick, are you running 4.1 on your Incredible?\n\nBackstretch uses jQuery's width and height methods to calculate the \"document\" or \"window\" height, depending on whether or not the browser supports fixed positioning. With mobile browsers, this can sometimes be tricky, since there's also a viewport and address bar to contend with. I suspect that this is where we're running into troubles.\n\nIf anyone of you has an Android 4.1 device, and is comfortable editing the Backstretch source code, I'd love to enlist your help in troubleshooting this.\n. I'd recommend using a solution, like [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/), to provide an alternate solution for older browsers, like Safari 3. Best of luck.\n. Unfortunately, I don't think there's a good answer for this. Backstretch, by design, wants to load the image last, so that page content is not withheld from the user while they're waiting for large assets to download. My recommendation is to either shrink the size of your image, or to place a background-color on the container as a fallback, or to display as the visitor waits for the image to download.\n\nSecondarily, if browser compatibility is not an issue, you may want to investigate CSS solutions, like background-size.\n. I don't believe it was ever an option to load before document.ready.\n. If you're only supporting modern browsers, I think that CSS's background-size might be the answer you're looking for.\n. I'd recommend looking at jquery-cookie, or similar plugin, that will help you manage cookie states.\n\nhttps://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie\n. I think the type of help you're looking for may be more appropriate for the jquery-cookie forums, or another plugin that helps set/get cookie values. As far as Backstretch is concerned, you're just going to use the cookie information to set the order of images based on a cookie value.\n. Hi,\n\nYes, it's possible to do with Backstretch, though most of the code you'll need to write would happen in a separate function, one that listens to slide change events. e.g.:\n\n```\nvar texts = [\n  \"Some text for Slide 1\",\n  \"Some text for Slide 2\",\n  \"Some text for Slide 3\",\n  ...\n];\n$(window).on(\"backstretch.show\", function (e, instance) {\n  $(\".overlay\").text( texts[instance.index] );\n});\n```\n\nHope that helps set you in the right direction.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Hello, Ryan,\n\nMy guess is that it's either fadeIn method (if you're using it), or setInterval. In either case, I'm at the mercy of jQuery and the browser vendor, so I'm not sure how to troubleshoot/resolve this. I'm going to close this ticket, but if you are able to come up with a more efficient way to run the script, please do let me know.\n\nThanks,\nScott\n. I'm having trouble replicating the problem. What version of Windows and Chrome are you testing on? Window 7, Chrome 23 works for me.\n. This question has already been answered in the Issues tracker, including Ticket #135.\n. There are two options, [centeredX/centeredY](https://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch#options), that control the position of the image. Though, it will always be cropped in some fashion, depending on the aspect ratio of the user's browser.\n. Hello,\n\nThanks so much for submitting this pull request. I think it may be redundant to the \"backstretch.show\" event, so for the time being, I'm going to close this request. I will, however, continue to consider it for future releases.\n\nThanks,\nScott\n. Every time a new image loads, Backstretch fires an event. If you listen for that event, you can respond much in the same way you would with a callback.\n\nhttps://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/#events\n. Yes, I see it, too. I'm wondering if these are just phantom requests. In the following example, I see the number of file requests go up from 6 to 7, but the KB transferred stays the same.\n\n## On Page Load\n\n![Screen Shot 2013-02-06 at 5 00 33 PM](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/44719/133718/45662128-70b1-11e2-83a5-8bc5d5195c0b.png)\n\n## Another copy of pot-holder.jpg is loaded\n\n![Screen Shot 2013-02-06 at 5 00 38 PM](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/44719/133719/49dad30c-70b1-11e2-97c0-ee10e9f13602.png)\n. There are a few things going on that might be causing the problem. Firstly, the site is using an old version of Backstretch, v1.2.8. The current supported version is 2.0.3. Secondly, there appear to be some markup issues with the page. I recommend looking at the results of the [W3C's markup validator service](http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fdawagner.com%2Fwpsite%2F&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0). And, lastly, fadeIn issues can sometimes be caused by z-indexing. I'd recommend removing some of the menu components, and see if you can isolate which, if any, are causing the issue.\n\nAs you can see from [this other slideshow demo](http://srobbin.com/demos/jquery-backstretch/examples/slideshow.html), it shouldn't be an issue directly caused by Backstretch. So, I'm going to go ahead an close this ticket. Best of luck.\n. I'm not sure I understand your suggestion. Backstretch sizes the image to the browser window, cropping the image to accommodate varying aspect ratios. So, in effect, it should be doing what your screenshot outlines. \n\nCan you please provide examples of a backstretched page? It might help communicate the point more clearly.\n. No, I'm sorry, I still don't think I understand what you mean. Are you saying that part of the image is being cut off, and you'd prefer that you see the entire image?\n. That's the way it's supposed to behave. It mimics the functionality of the CSS attribute \"background-size: cover\". It sounds like you might be looking for a different solution, something similar to \"background-size: contain\". \n\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/background-size\n. Yes, that's the type of code you'd use to swap out captions, etc. For example.\n\n``` javascript\nvar items = [\n  { img: \"image1.jpg\", caption: \"This is the first caption.\"},\n  { img: \"image2.jpg\", caption: \"This is the second caption.\"}\n];\n\nvar images = $.map(items, function(i) { return i.img; });\n\n$.backstretch(images);\n\n$(window).on(\"backstretch.show\", function(e, instance) {\n  var newCaption = items[instance.index].caption;\n  $(\".caption\").text( newCaption );\n});\n```\n. Can you please provide a link to a test page? I can't promise that I'll help debug your website, but I can take a quick look, and see if it's a simple fix.\n. It looks like your code refers to the \"slideshow.show\" event, when it should be listening for \"backstretch.show\".\n. \"backstretch.show\" is a predefined event that is thrown by the plugin. It is not affected by your variable name. Try changing \"slideshow.show\" to \"backstretch.show\", and you'll see your caption appear.\n. You should be able to call \"resize\" on the instance. e.g.\n\n``` javascript\n$(\"#foo\").backstretch(\"/path/to/image.jpg\");\n\nvar instance = $(\"#foo\").data(\"backstretch\");\ninstance.resize();\n```\n\nHope that helps.\n. I don't there should be any issue with using Backstretch and Bootstrap together, specifically with fixed elements. I've tested it myself, and don't see any problems with the fixed navbar.\n\nDo you have a link to the page you're having trouble with. I can't promise that I'll help resolve your problem, but I can take a quick look.\n. The version of Backstretch that you're using in the fiddle is v1.2.8. Block-level element support was added in v2.0. If you update your version of Backstretch, it should work.\n. It looks like you're using [jQuery v1.6.4](http://aaronhutten.com/js/jquery.min.js) on your site, and Backstretch requires at least v1.7. Updating it to a more recent version should resolve any problems you might have been having.\n. Duplicate #159.\n. I just added a new way to call prev/next on a Backstretch slideshow:\n\n``` javascript\n// First, create a Backstretch slideshow\n$.backstretch([\n  \"path/to/first.jpg\",\n  \"path/to/second.jpg\",\n  \"path/to/third.jpg\"\n]);\n\n// You'll probably attached the prev/next calls to some sort of click event\n$(\"a#next\").click(function () {\n  // Just call Backstretch again, and pass in the prev/next command\n  $.backstretch(\"next\");\n\n  return false;\n});\n```\n. @KamesG Can you please provide a link to the page that's not working?\n. Ah, I see what's happening. You'll need to call Backstretch's next method on the original section:\n\n```\n$('#section-header').backstretch(\"next\");\n```\n. It looks like the issue is related to something other than Backstretch itself. Rather, you've got multiple versions of jQuery, and [a custom noConflict script](http://www.gregbrockbank.us/sites/all/modules/jqmulti/js/switch.js?monyft). All of which is resulting in an error message saying that the \"on\" method can't be found for jQuery.\n\nUnfortunately, this is beyond the scope of help that I can offer. Best of luck.\n. Unfortunately, I'm not available for that kind of help. Though, there seem to be other Drupal developers in these forums; maybe they've worked their way through these issues, and would be willing to help.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. Thank you, Marius!\n. I've seen that kind of error when the version of jQuery is previous to 1.7,\nbut not for 1.9. Do you have a link to the site where you're seeing it?\n\n## \n\nScott Robbin\nshort: twitter.com/srobbin\nlong: srobbin.com\n\nOn Sun, Apr 7, 2013 at 2:54 PM, viperassasin notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> I keep getting this error when I try to use the newest version of\n> backstretch 2.03 Object [object Object] has no method 'on' it is\n> complaining about the calls to $(window).on I'am currently using 1.9 jquery.\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/issues/227\n> .\n. That URL doesn't seem to be accessible. It redirects to http://69.146.106.236:8080\n\nRegarding your second question, I'd prefer if we could keep this thread to the \"no method 'on'\" topic. There are other resolved issues in the tracker that deal with white gaps; I'd recommend that you take a look at those.\n. I'm sorry to say, but the link is still not accessible.\n. I recently corresponded with someone about this. It looks like Cargo Collective uses an older version of jQuery. Current versions of Backstretch require at least jQuery v1.7. Updating jQuery in your Cargo template should resolve any problems you might be having.\n. I just added \"backstretch.before\" and \"backstretch.after\" events in Commit deda81d71cff63c1644089206e767c5d37c16496. Thanks for the suggestion.\n. Hello,\n\nBackstretch fills the screen with your image, and may crop it depending on the aspect ratio of the browser window (if you resize the window, you'll notice that different parts of the image are cut off). This is normal.\n\nIf you're looking for a solution that doesn't crop the image, I recommend taking a look at the CSS background-size property, however you won't have the ability for a slideshow, and there are some browser compatibility limitations.\n\n\u2013Scott \n. The destroy method can be used one of two ways:\n\n1) Calling `destroy(true)` leaves the `.backstretch` div in place, but destroys the Backstretch plugin instance.\n2) Calling `destroy()` deletes everything.\n\nThe default is to destroy everything. The plugin uses the boolean preserveBackground parameter internally.\n. I think Bootstrap's Jumbotron Carousel example is meant to be a slideshow in and of itself, not necessarily something that you'd use _with_ Backstretch. I'd recommend using one or the other.\n. Thank you.\n. If you only want to set opacity on Backstretch images, and leave the container's content intact, then you could probably use a CSS snippet like this:\n\n``` CSS\n.backstretch img {\n  opacity: 0.9;\n  filter: alpha(opacity=90);\n}    \n```\n. Unfortunately, Backstretch does not have an align-to-bottom option, only top, left, and centering. If you are comfortable with JavaScript, you could fork the plugin, and modify the resize function.\n. This is a duplicate of Issue #200. I'm going to close this ticket, if you'd like to continue the discussion in the other thread.\n\nThat said, my thoughts are similar to @nenebale. I think this may be a phantom inspector request, and that multiple images are not being sent.\n. I haven't tried it, but I imagine that you could add CSS transitions to `.backstretch` or `.backstretch img`. If you get it working, please post a gist here. I'm sure others would like to see your solution, too.\n. Thanks for the pull request. I'm curious, why is the jQuery dependency 1.8.3 instead of, say, 1.9.1?\n. Ah, thanks! I'm not too familiar with Bower, so I didn't know if that dependency was a lowest-common-denominator value. Pulling now...\n. It also makes me realize that the README docs and project files are behind, too. I'll update those as well... Thanks.\n. I may wait to merge in a few more changes before bumping the version number, but it will happen soon. Thanks.\n. Are you including the scripts at the top or bottom of your webpage?\n. Good. Do you have a link that you could share?\n. It looks like you have an older version of Backstretch installed (v1.2.8), which doesn't support the `next()` method. Try updating to the latest version (v.2.0.3), and it should work.\n. @musicjunk is right, both your prev and next buttons are labelled as with an `id=\"next\"`.\n\nAlso, you are only passing in the first image to Backstretch:\n\n``` javascript\n$.backstretch(images[index], {speed: 500});\n```\n\nWhen you should be passing in the whole array of images:\n\n``` javascript\n$.backstretch(images, {speed: 500});\n```\n. Hello @illeggittimo,\n\nI'm sorry, I can't help you troubleshoot this issue. I can say, though, that removing the `[]` will definitely not work. Backstretch accepts two parameters, the first of which has to be an array if you're using it as a slideshow.\n\nTake a look at the documentation for the plugin. This thread is an old one, and the API for working with slideshows has changed. You'd now advance the slideshow by calling `$(\"#P02\").backstretch(\"next\")`.\n\nBest of luck,\nScott\n. No, I don't have any plans to store state in a cookie. The main issue is that jQuery doesn't natively support cookies. To do so, you'd like have to use a third-party plugin, like https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie. And I'd rather not add another dependency to Backstretch.\n\nTo answer your question, though, you should be able to do this yourself by listening forw the `backsretch.show` event, and setting a cookie then.\n. Yes, could definitely do that. You'd just need to reference the link attribute instead of the caption:\n\n```\nvar caption = items[instance.index].caption;\nvar link = items[instance.index].link;\nvar img = items[instance.index].img;\n```\n. Hi Ian,\n\nBackstretch does not have a scrollTo function. It uses the built-in window.scrollTo in a couple of places, but does not declare its own function with that name. Maybe the error message is referring to another issue?\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Either way, I'm glad to hear that you were able to workaround the issue.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. If you're able to share a link to a website that highlights the error, I can take a look at it.\n. Ah, I see what's happening. When you're creating your own scrollTo function, you're overwriting the browser's native window.scrollTo:\n\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.scrollTo\n\nAny plugin that uses window.scrollTo will fail, since it's expecting that function to behave a certain way. You are correct in that the best workaround for this is to name your custom function something other than scrollTo.\n. Just pushed a fix for this. Commit 6e4bae96b4585b097999d655d3cae59b5a89bcb3.\n. Duplicate of Issue #200. \n\nTo recap, I think this may just be a Web Inspector artifact, and that the browser is not redownloading images.\n. Hi,\n\nTry using the index that's passed into the event function, rather than fetching yourself. The before event is called before anything, so the `.index` hasn't been updated yet.\n\n```\n$(window).on(\"backstretch.before\", function (e, instance, index) {\n    $('.thumb').removeClass('act').eq(index).addClass('act'); \n});\n```\n. Not right now, but I'll consider adding 'backstretch.paused' and 'backstretch.resumed' events into future versions.\n. This goes more to your second question: no, Backstretch will crop any image to fit the size of the window/element, regardless of aspect ratio. It behaves very similarly to the CSS `background-size: cover` property. `background-size: contain` may be more what you're after.\n. Hello,\n\nNot with Backstretch, though you may want to look at the CSS `background-size: contain` property/value.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Hi Steve,\n\nJust set it up like you see in the README or examples folder, and it'll loop by default.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. You should just be able to use the following CSS rule (inside of your media query):\n\n``` css\n.backstretch {\n  display: none;\n}\n```\n. I imagine that you could get what you need by listening to the window's `resize` event, then doing a calculation, subtracting `$(\".backstretch\").width()` from the `$(window).width()`.\n\nHope that helps.\n. The latest version of the plugin doesn't use the live function. Any older version of Backstretch that does is unsupported.\n. Thanks for letting me know. Updated in commit 241a345. \n. Thanks for letting me know. It looks like it's an issue with my web host not pointing to the right directory. I've contacted them, and hope to have it back up soon.\n. The site should be back up and running now. Thanks again for letting me know.\n. Looks like the [ignore object/array issue was fixed](https://github.com/jquery-backstretch/jquery-backstretch/commit/bd17813213e771758feb2a47d7ee4980429c79e4) back in October. The [most recent version](https://github.com/jquery-backstretch/jquery-backstretch/blob/master/bower.json) contains both these corrections.\r\n\r\nAre you seeing this error when trying to do a `bower update`? If so, maybe Backstretch needs to be removed entirely, and then re-added. Maybe the JSON is unforgivingly fatal to that process.. Thanks for letting us know.. Hi All,\n\nThis issue should be resolved in the latest version of Backstretch (v 1.1.1). If someone can verify that this problem is indeed fixed, let me know and I'll close this issue.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. Hi,\n\nUnfortunately, IE 6 will not be supported. That said, if you do discover a fix and would like to submit a pull request, I'd be happy to incorporate it.\n\nThanks,\nScott\n. That should do the trick. Do you have a link to a page where it's not working?\n\nI've also heard people asking about how to rotate images on-the-fly. My suggestion there is to just change the $(\"#backstretch img).attr(\"src\", \"/path/to/new/image\"); using a setInterval and fadeIn/fadeOut.\n. jQuery Backstretch isn't setup to do slideshows. I mentioned in the previous comment how I thought it might work if you wanted to hack something together, though it's definitely a hack. There are a couple of other background plugins out there that do image rotation \u2014 I'd recommend checking those out.\n\nThat said, here's a little more fleshed out idea of the hack described above. I'm not sure if it works, and cannot support it, but hopefully it sparks an idea or pushes you in the right direction.\n\nhttp://gist.github.com/545916\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. Give the latest version a try. I added a hack to account for iOS, so that it uses $(document) instead of $(window) to get the correct height. Let me know if it does/doesn't work.\n. And by latest version, I mean the one from Github, not from my website. If this works, I'll include it in version 1.1.\n. Ah, yeah, that's a problem with Mobile WebKit, not Backstretch itself. Mobile WebKit/Safari doesn't support position:fixed.\n\nhttp://blog.mspace.fm/2009/10/01/iphone-mobile-safari-css-position-fixed/\n\nThere are a few workarounds, but none of them with work with this plugin.\n. Is it happening on the demo page (http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/jquery-backstretch/)? If not, can you please point me to an example that I can take a look at?\n\nThanks,\nScott\n. Hmmm...I'm using Firefox 3.6.8 and Safari 5.0 on OS X, and I don't see it happening. Are you seeing any error messages (if you look at the browsers error console or Firebug)?\n. Damn, that's strange.\n\nI'm not sure why that's happening, and can't seem to reproduce it myself. Are you comfortable with JavaScript and a debugger? If so, I'd love to troubleshoot this with you, and get to the bottom of this.\n. Ah, I think I see what's happening. It doesn't look like I was adjusting the top/left positioning on each resize. So, it was the correct width, just positioned too far off the screen.\n\nTry downloading the latest version, and let me know if it resolves the problem. If so, I'll release this as version 1.1.1.\n\nThanks,\nScott\n. Excellent. Thanks so much for all of your help in squashing this one.\n. Hi efontani,\n\nIt looks like your problems are unrelated to those above, but are being caused by prettyPhoto itself. Near line 101 (of the uncompressed script) there's a line that unbinds all resize events.\n\n<code>$(window).unbind('resize').resize(function(){ _center_overlay(); _resize_overlay(); });</code>\n\nThat line would unbind the event listener that Backstretch needs to know when the window has been resize. If you're comfortable with editing JavaScript, I'd suggest taking out the first \"unbind\" function. That should make things work copacetically.\n\nHope that helps.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. Hi Dan,\n\nUnfortunately, no, I don't plan on supporting IE6 for backstretch. Though, I would like to nudge you in the right direction if I can.\n\nAre you using the regular or minified version of backstretch? I find that it's much easier to troubleshoot with the non-minified version installed. Also, I'd start off by using CSS to put a border around the #backstretch and #backstretch img elements. That way, you can narrow down whether or not it's a CSS issue or not. If it's not CSS, then my first recommendation for JS would be to pass in \"false\" for the centeredX and centeredY parameters. Maybe backstretch is miscalculating the width/height of the window?\n\nHope that helps.\n\nBest of luck,\nScott\n. Hi,\n\nBackstretch won't be able to do this, as is, but if you're looking to fork the project and customize it, I'd recommend looking at line 51. Instead of passing in a \"src,\" you could pass in a selector and swap the image.\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Hi,\n\nDo you have this demo up anywhere online? If so, can you replace your references to jQuery to the non-minified version (http://ajax.microsoft.com/ajax/jquery/jquery-1.4.2.js) and send me a link? I'll take a look.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Hi Todd,\n\nThanks for posting the example. I think I figured out what the problem was. It looks like IE7 was prematurely firing the resize event when the page was loaded, before the background image, itself, was ready. I've added a try/catch block to allow the resize to gracefully fail.\n\nTry downloading the most recent version (1.1.2), and see if the error is gone.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. Hi Kevin,\n\nIt looks like you've included backstretch twice: once in the header and once near the footer. Also, you shouldn't have to attach it to the window's onload event. Backstretch, itself, will wait until the page is ready.\n\nHope that helps.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. No worries. Glad it worked. :)\n\n\u2013S\n. Hi,\n\nUnfortunately, IE6 isn't supported. That said, my first thoughts would be to play with z-index CSS attribute.\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Hi djamell,\n\nI'll look into it for the next release. In the meantime, I'd recommend that you use jQuery to detect whether or not to use backstretch. Something like this:\n\n<code>\n\n<pre>\nif (!$.browser.msie && !$.browser.version==\"6.0\") {\n $.backstretch(...)\n}\n</pre>\n\n</code>\n. Hi. Unfortunately, I'm not providing support for Opera. Though, if you can fork the project, and find a solution, I'd be happy to incorporate the changes into the main trunk.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Hi Kyle,\n\nAs I had mentioned in my other reply, I don't offer support for Opera. Though, I'd very much like to see this work for you.\n\nMy guess is that it's a z-index issue, or that something strange is happening with the text-indent. If adjusting the z-index doesn't work, try applying the text-indent to the <a> tag instead of \".title\".\n\n<div class=\"title\"><a href=\"#\">Text</a></div>\n\n\n.title {\n            height:100px;\n            width:200px; \n            background-image:url(title.png);\n            background-repeat: no-repeat;\n          }\n\n```\n.title a { \n    display:block; \n    text-indent: -9999px;\n}\n```\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Hi Kyle,\n\nI'm not sure that display:inline-block works in IE. For what it's worth, the following will work cross-browser:\n\n<pre>\n<code>\n\n.title {\n    width:524px; \n    height:82px;\n    background-image:url(title.png);\n    background-repeat: no-repeat;\n}\n\n.title a, .title a span { display:block; }\n.title a span { text-indent: -9999px; }\n\n</code>\n</pre>\n\n\nNote: Using your same HTML\n\nBest of luck.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Ah, good. Glad it's working now.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Hi,\n\nA couple of questions:\n- Which version of FF are you using?\n- Do you have an example url that I could look at?\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Hmmm...that's strange. It seems to work for me. Is there an example online that I can look at?\n. Hi Keith,\n\nThanks for the kind words about backstretch. Much appreciated.\n\nYes, the plugin does center the image. If you want to turn that off, use the centeredX and centeredY options, and set them to 'false.'  That will align the image from the top-left. Unfortunately, the plugin doesn't support aligning from the bottom or bottom-right. Though, if you're comfortable with JavaScript, then it should be easy to fork this project and make the necessary changes.\n\nhttp://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/blob/master/README.textile\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Hi Keith,\n\nI believe that if you just change the <code>bgCSS = {left: 0, top: 0}</code> to <code>bgCSS = {left: 0, bottom: 0}</code> in the <code>_adjustBG</code> function, and set centeredX and centeredY to 'false,' that it will work as you'd like. Though, I haven't tested it.\n\nUnfortunately, beyond this reply, I won't be able to help any further. Best of luck.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Thanks, Jako. That's good to know.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Hi,\n\nI'm not sure why it isn't working, but I'd recommend making the page validate first. It looks like there are a few errors, and those might be causing the odd behavior.\n\nhttp://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fdevelop.cellsignals.ca%2Findex3.php&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. Agreed. That would be awesome, but I think it's beyond the scope of this plugin. Still, a great idea.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. I agree with ryken's assessment of it being a browser rendering issue, less so than the plugin itself. There are also a bunch of CSS-only solutions out there that might be more well-suited, if performance is an issue.\n. Hi,\n\nSorry for not replying sooner. Were you able to sort this out, or is it still an issue?\n\n\u2013Scott\n. You can probably put the following in your print stylesheet to hide backstretch.\n\n<pre><code>\n#backstretch { display: none !important; }\n</code></pre>\n. I've just posted a new version of jQuery Backstretch, one that should allow you to call the plugin multiple times, replacing the existing image. It's version 1.2-beta, and is available in the downloads section.\n. Hi,\n\nYou can always change backstretch's image by using the following bit of code:\n\n<code>\n\n<pre>\n$(\"#backstretch img\").attr(\"src\", \"/path/to/new/image.jpg\");\n</pre>\n\n</code>\n\nNote: the image should be the same size or heigh/width ratio as the previous image.\n\nHope that helps.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. Hi,\n\nThis has already been discussed in the following thread:\n\nhttps://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/issuesearch?state=closed&q=slideshow#issue/5\n\nHope that helps.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. Consolidating this issue with another which appears to be related:\n\nhttps://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/issues/45\n. I'm not sure I entirely understand the setup here. That said, there are a couple of ways to handle multiple pages:\n1. Use if/else statements to load backstretch. i.e. if($(\"body#about\"))....else if($(\"body#contact\")...\n2. Just replace the backstretch image directly: $(\"#backstretch img\").attr(\"src\", \"/path/to/new.jpg\")\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. I've just released a new version of Backstretch that should make it easier to replace images. It's version 1.2-beta on the downloads page. Hope that helps.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. The problem that you had run into was that SVG requires an \"embed\" tag, whereas Backstretch appends an \"img\" tag. I don't think it would be too difficult for you to modify the plugin to suit your SVG needs. I'd recommend taking a look at this fork of Backstretch, where someone appends the HTML5 video tag:\n\nhttps://github.com/mpezzi/jquery-backstretch/commit/e904bd26b689d15c1a7e5bcfd513d5aa3c82bb92\n. I'm adding a few more digits to the backstretch z-index in an upcoming release. Hopefully, this resolves the problem.\n. Hi Mike,\n\nI'm very sorry for not replying to this months ago. I've always found the fadeIn function to be a bit buggy. The image itself should load, but not be displayed.\n\nIf this is still a pertinent issue, please send along a link to a live demo, and I'll look into it.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. I just posted a new version of Backstretch that uses, amongst other things, a different way to calculate the image width and height. I've heard from others that this helps resolve Webkit issues. Would someone here mind downloading version 1.2-beta, and letting me know if it fixes the issue above? Also, if anyone has access to IE version, and wouldn't mind helping with cross-browser testing, I would very, very much appreciate the assistance.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. Thanks for testing this. I'll take a look and see what's going on with IE7. IE6 might be a lost cause. I don't plan to support it, but if someone can suggest a fix for that one, I'd be happy to include it.\n\nRob, as for 1.1.2, that version does not support the ability to use the slideshow demo, only 1.2.\n\nI'll take a look at this, and get back to you all. Thanks, again.\n. Hi Everyone,\n\nI just pushed a new version of 1.2.0 beta that should fix the IE problems. Please take a look, and let me know if it does/doesn't work for you.\n\nthanks,\nScott\n. Thanks, everyone. I really appreciate your help.\n. Not currently, though I don't image it'd be hard to fork the plugin and make a version that binds to something other than body. Take a look near line 50, where the content is prepended to body. I'd suggest making a version of the plugin where the container name gets passed in via the options.\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\u2013Scott \n. It looks like you forgot to include the script tag for Backstretch itself. It should go after Google's jQuery script tag, but before you actually call Backstretch.\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/904748\n. You'll need to change to \"/path/to/jquery.backstretch.js\" location to the actual location of the backstretch file.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. Not necessarily, though there's nothing that prevents you from calling the backstretch plugin on each individual page. Or, you can always change the $(\"#backstretch img).attr(\"src\", \"...\") midstream.\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Normally, I would be a proponent for adding an Alt tag, but I don't think it needs one in this case. Backstretch is meant to be a alternate to a body's background image. Background images do not get alt tags, they are meant to be visual decorators only. That said, if you really would like to add an alt tag, I'd recommend doing so by manipulating the \"#backstretch img\" DOM element with jQuery itself, after backstretch has been loaded.\n. Thanks for letting me know. I'm going to add a few more default styles, in an upcoming release, to deal with this.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. Hi cmebd,\n\nSorry for the delay in replying.\n\nNo, right now it's not an option in jQuery Backstretch, though you're free to override any of the CSS yourself. Just add any new attributes to your stylesheet, and use the \"!important\" declarative to override the default behavior.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. I'm not sure if there's a good way to do that. My recommendation would be to hide the #backstretch DIV in the media queries for the smaller screens. As for load time, backstretch waits until the page is loaded before performing the stretch, so it shouldn't really affect the initial rendering time. It might be a little extra taxing on their post-load bandwidth, but that's another story...\n. Hi Anne,\n\nThat's very clever. Thank you for writing it, and for sharing.\n\nI plan to rewrite Backstretch soon, adding a few new features. I'll definitely keep this in mind.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. Try pulling the latest files from the repository. I just added the ability to replace the Backstretch image by calling it again, and provided an example of how to do so onclick. Let me know if you run into any issues.\n\nhttps://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/zipball/1.2-beta\n. Do you have a link that you could share with me, so I take a look at it?\n. Great. Yes, it's possible to do so. It's very similar to the code in the button example. If you want to prevent the default click behavior from happening, you just have to add a bit of extra code to stop it.\n\n```\n$('a.whatever-class').click(function(e) {\n   e.preventDefault();\n   $.backstretch('/path/to/next/img.jpg');\n});\n```\n. I seem to be able to reproduce this on Chrome on first load. Does the slideshow work if you refresh the page a second time?\n. Try using the latest version of Backstretch. I'm not sure why the older version isn't working for you, but I tested the new one, and it seems to resolve the issue.\n\nhttps://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/zipball/1.2.0-b2\n. I think you might be experiencing the same issue that we're seeing over here:\n\nhttps://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/issues/45#issuecomment-1570034\n\nIf you're interested in using the plugin immediately, I recommend using version 1.1.2. That one is stable, though you won't be able to use the onClick or slideshow functionality/examples.\n. I think I figured out the problem. Take a look at this, and let me know if looks OK in IE:\n\nhttp://srobbin.com/demos/jquery-backstretch/\n. Great! I updated to v1.2.1, so you should be able to download it now.\n. Hi,\n\nI just tried it out on Opera 11 for OS X, and it seems to work fine.\n\nhttp://srobbin.com/demos/jquery-backstretch/examples/slideshow.html\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Hi Fetz,\n\nI think the issue had something to do with the img:last selector that I was using in the _adjustBG function. I've since removed it, and it appears to have fixed the problem. Can you please download the most recent version of Backstretch, and see if it's resolved for you as well?\n\nThanks,\nScott\n. Hi Matt,\n\nI think the iPad/iPhone issue may have been a bug, and should be fixed in the latest version. Not the downloadable version 1.2.1, but the most recent commit, version 1.2.2. Here's a link, if you'd like to try it out.\n\nhttps://raw.github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/master/jquery.backstretch.min.js\n\nAnd, a link to preview it on your iPad:\n\nhttp://srobbin.com/demos/jquery-backstretch/examples/basic.html\n\nLet me know if that works.\n\n\u2013Scott\n\nNote: iOS5 supports fixed position. The issue above was related to a bug in which the background didn't stretch to the entire height.\n. Hi stokedesign,\n\niOS4 does not support \"position:fixed,\" which is what locks the background in place. The fullscreen scrolling background is a fallback, and still looks quite nice, I think. I'm not sure if there are any other fullscreen background plugins that attempt to fix this.\n\nBest of luck,\nScott\n. Thanks for posting this fix.\n. Hi Luca-Gianni,\n\nThe easiest thing to do might be to add a CSS rule:\n\n#backstretch { margin-left: 150px !important; }\n\nThough, you'll probably notice that this approach will clip the image on the righthand side during the stretch. If that's not a problem, then this is a simple solution. If that irks you, then recoding _adjustBG to take into account the margin width should do the trick.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. Hi Luca,\n\nI think it would just be a matter of taking the margin into account when calculating the height/width of the stretch, but I'd have to look into it further. If you're interested in me helping write a customized version of the plugin, I'd be happy to do so. That's part of what I offer with Premium Support (link at the bottom of http://srobbin.com/blog/jquery-plugins/jquery-backstretch/).\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. Hi Frederico,\n\nI'd recommend doing something like this:\n\n``` javascript\nvar images = [\n    \"image1.jpg\",\n    \"image2.jpg\",\n    \"image3.jpg\"\n];\n\nvar index = 0;\n$.backstretch(images[index], {speed: 500});\n\nvar slideshow = setInterval(function() {\n    index = (index >= images.length - 1) ? 0 : index + 1;\n    $.backstretch(images[index]);\n}, 5000);\n\n$(\"a.clickable\").click(function(e) {\n    // Prevent the click from actually following the href\n    e.preventDefault();\n\n    // Stop the slideshow\n    clearInterval(slideshow);\n\n    // Backstretch\n    $.backstretch( $(this).attr(\"href\") );\n});\n```\n\nAnd, then for your thumbnails, I'd make them look like this:\n\n``` html\n<a class=\"clickable\" href=\"image1.jpg\"><img src=\"image1_thumb.jpg\"/></a>\n<a class=\"clickable\" href=\"image2.jpg\"><img src=\"image2_thumb.jpg\"/></a>\n<a class=\"clickable\" href=\"image3.jpg\"><img src=\"image3_thumb.jpg\"/></a>\n```\n\nAs you can see, there's now a \"clickable\" class, so that all of your links can share the same code. Also, I've added the image that you want to backstretch to as the href tag. This way, if JavaScript fails, it will still link the user to that image.\n\nHope you find this helpful. If you need any additional help, please consider purchasing Premium Support for Backstretch (located at the bottom of the page).\n\nhttp://srobbin.com/blog/jquery-plugins/jquery-backstretch/\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. Unfortunately, it's not something that this plugin will do for you. Though, if you're comfortable with JavaScript, I'm sure you'll be able to adapt most of the plugin's code for your use in something that would work on DIVs.\n\nBest of luck,\nScott\n. Hi fsjsy,\n\nIt's possible for you to show a loading indicator, apply backstretch, and then pass in a callback function to hide the loading indicator. That said, I think it would be much easier to have jQuery preload the images for you. I've updated the slideshow example to include preloading code:\n\nhttps://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/blob/master/examples/slideshow.html\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Hi,\n\nI'm not sure what you mean? You can always calculate the image path before passing it in.\n\n``` javascript\nvar someImage = $(\"#an-image\");\n$.backsretch(someImage.src);\n```\n. Try:\n\n``` javascript\n(function($) { \n    jQuery(document).ready(function() {\n        var someImage = $(\"img#BGImage\");\n        $.backstretch(someImage.attr(\"src\"));\n    });\n})(jQuery);\n```\n. Try using \"jQuery\" instead of the \"$\":\n\n``` javascript\njQuery.backstretch(\"/path/to/your.jpg\");\n```\n. It looks right to me.\n\nRegarding further help, if you're interested in purchasing Premium Support for Backstretch, I can help you troubleshoot this further. Premium Support is was helps fund development of the product for me.\n\nhttp://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/jquery-backstretch/\n\n(Link at the bottom of the page)\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. That's very cool. Unfortunately, I don't think this is something that I'd, personally, be able to help with. Though, if you're interested in customizing the plugin yourself, feel free to fork it. I think this would be a neat mashup.\n\nAlso, if you're looking for some direction, I'd recommend playing with the Instagram plugin's onComplete function.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. There are a few pull requests, and forks of Backstretch, that implement this feature.\n. Thanks, Sascha. I appreciate you putting so much work into this. I look forward to hearing from you again, soon.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Sorry for not having addressed this long ago. If I'm understanding Require.js correctly, you should just be able to use this via the standard `require()` dependency call.\n. With the current version of Backstretch, you could do the following:\n\n``` javascript\n$.backstretch(\"photo.jpg\")\n\n$(window).on(\"backstretch.show\", function () {\n  $(\"#loading\").hide();\n});\n```\n. Hi JL,\n\nThere's a speed parameter that you can pass in to Backstretch that controls the fadeIn of an image.  e.g...\n\n``` javascript\n$.backstretch(\"/path/to/image.jpg\", {speed: 150});\n```\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Hi mat5hias,\n\nYou'd want to modify the code near setInterval, and use clearInterval once you've made your way through all of the images:\n\nhttp://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_setinterval.asp\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. With the most recent version of Backstretch, you could do the following:\n\n``` javascript\n$(window).on(\"backstretch.show\", function (e, instance) {\n  $(\"#loading\").hide();\n});\n```\n. It's a holdover from pre-iOS5 days. iOS4 didn't have fixed positioning, so the absolute positioning and large rendering was a fallback. Now that iOS5 supports position:fixed, Backstretch should be more intelligent.\n. Here's an attempt at a version that detects fixed positioning:\n\nhttps://raw.github.com/gist/1755245/c8a7e44ae2251921e7a6b6593f00ecf50600a510/gistfile1.js\n\nWould you mind checking to see if this works for you? If so, would you have some time to help me cross-browser test?\n. Thanks for doing all of this testing. Is the page you're testing on publicly viewable? If so, would you mind send a link to me?\n. Yeah, I did some more investigating. The method I was using to query for fixed positioning isn't right. \n. Unfortunately, not yet. All of the solutions that I've found require you to wait at least 500ms after the page loads. I'm not quite keen on doing it that way. I'll keep digging, and see if there's a better way.\n. I believe that I have a release that works correctly in iOS5 with fixed positioning, and falls back to absolute positioning in iOS4. Would anyone be interested in helping me test this?\n\nhttps://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/zipball/1.2.6b\n. Hi Derek,\n\nDo you have a link to a page that has 1.2.7 on it?

Ah, I see what's happening. There's a style on your page that's setting the max-width of all images (for responsiveness, I assume):\n\nimg {\n  max-width: 100%;\n}\n\nI'd recommend either making that style more specific (e.g. img.scale), or adding another style for Backstretch:\n\n#backsretch img {\n  max-width: none;\n}\n\nHope that helps. \n\n## \n\nScott Robbin\nshort: twitter.com/srobbin\nlong: srobbin.com\n\nOn Thursday, May 10, 2012 at 4:29 PM, Derek Hogue wrote:\n\n> OK, here's a link: [http://thepublicstudio.ca](http://thepublicstudio.ca).

Thanks so much.\n. Hi Everyone,\n\nI've got a new version of Backstretch in progress that adds this functionality, and makes it easier to do slideshows. Would you mind taking a look, giving it a spin, and letting me know if you have any troubles or thoughts?\n\nThank you, again, to @timnovinger for submitting his excellent patch, and for inspiring this thread. I chose to refactor much of the plugin, so his changes couldn't be merged, though they were very helpful in guiding the implementation.\n\nhttps://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/tree/2.0.0-wip\n. The latest version of Backstretch has support for slideshows, along with cross-fading. (Sorry, I know this is an old issue, but I wanted to address it before closing the ticket.)\n. Yes, admittedly, the slideshow code is not very good. From the looks of it, the plugin is rebinding to the window resize event every time a new slide is loaded. Obviously, this shouldn't be the case.\n\nI'm currently working on a new version of Backstretch, and will make sure this doesn't happen. Thanks for the heads-up.\n. Thanks so much for looking into that. I really appreciate you letting me know about this.\n. Hi Urs,\n\nThanks for supporting Backstretch, and my apologies for not responding\nsooner.

The latest version of Backstretch will allow you to attach an image to any block-level element. So, it should just be a matter of creating your `#frame`, then adding Backstretch to it: `$(\"#frame\").backstretch(\"image.jpg\")`.\n. That sounds about right to me, though I'd be careful with callbacks attached to the resize event. It gets called quite a bit.\n. @vladmu, that's a great point, thank you. I'm currently working on a new version of the plugin, and have been more careful about passing about this. In the new version, I'm opting to fire an event when the image is changed rather than registering a callback. If you have any interest in looking over the code, I'd love your feedback.\n\nhttps://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/tree/2.0.0-wip\n. I apologize for not replying to this long ago. Backstretch is currently at v2.0.2. I hope that it has been resolved in the most recent version.\n. I believe that this issue had been resolved with v2 of Backstretch. If this continues to be an issue for anyone, please feel free to comment or reopen.\n. Typically, if you're going to link to a resource that will be accessed through both HTTP and HTTPS, you can leave the protocol off.\n\nIn other words, this:\n\n<img src=\"http://example.com/image.jpg\" >\n\nbecomes this:\n\n<img src=\"//example.com/image.jpg\" >\n\nThat way, it will use whatever protocol, HTTP or HTTPS, that the calling page uses.\n\nIn the case of Backstretch, you could write:\n\n$.backstretch(\"//example.com/image.jpg\"); \n\nOn Wednesday, May 30, 2012 at 7:20 PM, neucart wrote: \n\n> I don't really know how to explain this best, so I'll just jot some notes here:\n> \n> 1) A customer's site is HTTP and uses backstretch.

If you've got a staging server where you re-post the code, I'd be happy to take a look with you.\n. I believe that someone has forked Backstretch, and added video capabilities, though I can't recall which fork it was:\n\nhttps://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/network\n. Isn't that the old joke?\n\nPatient: Doctor, it hurts when I do this.\nDoctor: Then don't do that.\n\nI'm not sure why transform would override Backstretch working, but if you provide a link to a page where you have this setup, I'll take a look. \n. It might work to put the translateZ on an element that wraps everything within the body, instead of the body itself. e.g.:\n\n``` css\n.wrap { -webkit-transform: translateZ(0); }\n```\n\n``` html\n<body>\n  <div class=\"wrap\">\n    .. all of the other elements...\n  </div>\n</body>\n```\n. Thanks for bringing this to my attention. Someone had mentioned this before, but I was remiss to include a fix. I've just posted Backstretch version 1.2.8 that now has a max-width: none declaration.\n\nCheers.\n. In the newest version of Backstretch, you can do the following:\n\n``` javascript\n$(window).on(\"backstretch.show\", function (e, instance) {\n  // If we wanted to stop the slideshow after it reached the end\n  if (instance.index === instance.images.length - 1) {\n    instance.pause();\n  };\n});\n```\n. There's a fork of Backstretch where a minimum width option was added:\n\nhttps://github.com/noahstokes/jquery-backstretch\n\nHope that helps.\n. What slider are you referring to?\n. Yes, all of the examples on the website, including the slideshow, use remote images.\n. Unfortunately, you will not be able to do that with JavaScript. You will need to use a server-side language, like PHP, Python, or Ruby, to read the file system directory and output the necessary HTML.\n\nBest of luck,\nScott\n. No, I'm sorry, Backstretch will not distort the image to fit the entire window size. I'd recommend either investigating another plugin, or using pure CSS to do so.\n. The latest version of Backstretch has a much easier way of implementing slideshows. I recommend checking it out.\n. I am just going through, closing old issues, and noticed that this hadn't been address. Sorry.\n\nI tested Backstretch on FF 13, and didn't see the issue on the example pages, so I am going to assume that this may have just been a site-specific issue. If anyone notices a similar issue, please feel free to comment or reopen this ticket.\n. It looks like horizontal scrollbar is being caused by the text-indent attribute of #header h1 a. If you comment that out, you should see the horizontal scrollbar go away.\n\nBest of luck,\nScott\n. Hello,\n\nPlease accept my apologies for not addressing your issue when you submitted it long ago. With the current version of Backstretch, you can attach background images to any block-level element like so:\n\n``` javascript\n$(\"#presentation\").backstretch(\"path/to/presentation.jpg\");\n$(\"#services\").backstretch(\"path/to/services.jpg\");\n$(\"#contact\").backstretch(\"path/to/contact.jpg\");\n```\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Hi Nick,\n\nBackstretch doesn't support easing by default, but if you're comfortable with modifying the plugin, then it should be easy to add in yourself. The \"fadeIn\" function is located around Line 122. You could change it to add in easing.\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Currently, no, unless you're interested in modifying the plugin code itself. The fadeIn function is located around Line 122.\n\nThat said, I'm working on a new version of the plugin, and had considered externalizing the transition, allowing you to pass in your own as an option. e.g.\n\n``` javascript\n$.backstretch(\"path/to/image.jpg\", {\n  transition: function (image1, image2) {\n    // You'd write your own transition here\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIf that sounds appealing, and you have any interest in helping code it, I'd love to collaborate and/or hear your feedback.\n. Hi,\n\nFirst off, I'd recommend trying to reducing your original image to much less than a few MB. I try to reduce the images I use to ~500KB, if possible.\n\nThat said, I can definitely see why you'd want to limit the size of the image for an iPhone. I'd recommend using JavaScript to select the right-size image, before passing it into Backstretch. e.g.:\n\n``` javascript\nvar small = 'path/to/small.jpg' \n  , large = 'path/to/large.jpg'\n  , img = window.screen.width <= 480 ? small : large;\n\n$.backstretch(img);\n```\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Hi,\n\nIt looks like you're including Backstretch twice, once before jQuery has been downloaded. Try this instead:\n\n``` html\n<script src=\"Scripts/jquery-1.7.1.min.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n<script src=\"Scripts/jquery-1.3.2.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n<script src=\"Scripts/jquery.backstretch.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    $(document).ready(function () {\n        $.backstretch('http://dl.dropbox.com/u/515046/www/outside.jpg');\n    });\n</script>\n```\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Hi Vladimir,\n\nNot that I'm aware of, unless you're interested in forking the project, and replacing the fadeIn call around Line 228.\n\nBest of luck,\nScott\n. Hi,\n\nSorry if the repo is confusing. I'll look into updating the documentation to be more clear. Here's the basic HTML you'll need to include:\n\n``` html\n<script src=\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.2/jquery.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"jquery.backstretch.min.js\"></script>\n<script>\n  // To attach Backstrech as the body's background\n  $.backstretch(\"path/to/image.jpg\");\n</script>\n```\n\nIn other words, you'll need to include jQuery and the jquery.backstretch.min.js file, then call Backstretch itself.\n. That's correct, by \"then call Backstretch itself\" I was referring this:\n\n``` html\n<script>\n  // To attach Backstretch as the body's background\n  $.backstretch(\"path/to/image.jpg\");\n</script>\n```\n. Sorry about that. It should have been checked in the opposite direction:\n\n```\n$(this).fadeIn(self.options.speed || self.options.fade, function () {\n```\n\nTake a look at the latest version of Backstretch (v2.0.1), and let me know if that fixed the problem.\n. Hi,\n\nYou could always randomly choose the image via JavaScript before passing it into Backstretch:\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/3799775\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Once Backstretch has been called, the only way to change images is to call Backstretch again (which you're allowed to do). So, you'll probably want to create your own slideshow logic. There was some code in v1.2.8 that might be helpful to you. It uses `setInterval` and single calls to Backstretch:\n\nhttps://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/zipball/1.2.8\n\nBest of luck,\nScott\n. Sorry for the delay in responding. Unfortunately, no, this isn't something that falls within the scope of Premium Support.\n\nBest of luck,\nScott\n. Hello,\n\nI apologize for not commenting on this issue sooner. The Backstretch documentation refers to the \"show\" method, where you can pass an index of the slide that you would like to see. e.g.:\n\n``` javascript\nvar $navs = $(\".nav a\");\n$navs.click(function () {\n  var index = $navs.index( $(this) );\n\n  // Get the instance of Backstretch\n  // Since you called it as $.backstretch, it's attached to the body\n  var instance = $(\"body\").data(\"backstretch\");\n\n  // Show the slide based on the clicked index\n  instance.show(index);\n\n  // Return false, so that the click doesn't change the page hash\n  return false;\n});\n```\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Are you using a caching plugin your website, like WP Super Cache?\n. Can you please post a link to your site, to the page that is supposed to be disabled?\n. I think there may be a few issues here. Backstretch may not be working due to some HTML errors. You can see them here:\n\nhttp://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fnowinmotion.org%2Fwordpress%2F&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0\n\nAlso, your site seems to have been hacked. If you view the source code from that page, you'll see a bunch of spam links at the top.\n\nRegarding the Backstretch plugin, unfortunately that's not something that I developer or have any control of. Hopefully, the developer will respond to you soon.\n\nUnfortunately, all of these issues fall outside the scope of the Backstretch plugin itself, so I'm going to close this ticket.\n\nBest of luck,\nScott\n. Try calling Backstretch after the document is ready:\n\n``` javascript\n$(document).ready(function () {\n  $.backstretch(\n    bgImages,\n    { \n      fade: 750,\n      duration: 4000\n    }\n  );\n});\n```\n. Hi,\n\nUnfortunately, that's a side effect of calculating the window height on iOS. The window has to be scrolled down. Here's the bit of the source code that's doing the scrolling. Feel free to update it if you find a better solution:\n\n``` javascript\n/*\n * Scroll the page one pixel to get the right window height on iOS\n * Pretty harmless for everyone else\n*/\nif ($(window).scrollTop() === 0 ) {\n  window.scrollTo(0, 0);\n}\n```\n\n\u2013Scott\n. If you're not interested in modifying the plugin yourself, you can access the index variable directly through the index. e.g.:\n\n``` javascript\n$(\"body\").data(\"backstretch\").index;\n```\n\nOr, if you've used Backstretch on a block-level element:\n\n``` javascript\n$(\".foo\").data(\"backstretch\").index;\n```\n. Hi,\n\nI think you should be able to detect the pixel ratio before passing Backstretch the image(s). e.g:\n\n``` javascript\nvar images;\n\nif (window.devicePixelRatio > 1) {\n  images = [\n    'path/to/largerImage.jpg',\n    'path/to/largerImage2.jpg'\n  ];\n} else {\n  images = [\n    'path/to/smallerImage.jpg',\n    'path/to/smallerImage2.jpg'\n  ];\n}\n\n$.backstretch(images);\n```\n\nOr something like that.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Yes, it was dropped in favor of using custom events. You can now subscribe to a \"backstretch.show\" event to be notified when the image has been placed.\n\nOn Oct 9, 2012, at 3:59 PM, Krzysztof Tomasz Zembrowski notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Hi Scott,\n> \n> what happened to the callback?\n> Was it dropped in version 2.0?\n> \n> Already saw:\n> srobbin/jquery-backstretch#63\n> srobbin/jquery-backstretch#76\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n.

Hello,\n\nThanks for your feedback and suggestion. I think the easiest way to do this might be to order the array before passing it into Backstretch. e.g.:\n\n``` javascript\n// Original call\nvar images = [\n  'image1.jpg',\n  'image2.jpg',\n  'image3.jpg',\n  'image4.jpg'\n];\n$.backstretch(images);\n\n// Let's say you want to start at index 2 instead of 0,\n// it might be easier to put things in order before passing in to Backstretch\nvar images = [\n  'image3.jpg',\n  'image4.jpg',\n  'image1.jpg',\n  'image2.jpg'\n];\n$.backstretch(images);\n```\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Hello,\n\nYou can change the image by calling Backstretch on the original block-level element again, like so:\n\n``` javascript\n$(\"#thumb-gallery a\").click(function(e) {\n  // Prevent the click from actually following the href\n  e.preventDefault();\n  // Backstretch\n  $(\"#background-image.slideshow\").backstretch( $(this).attr(\"href\") );\n});\n```\n. Thanks for submitting the pull request. At this time, I'm not going to add the options to the repo, but I'll keep it in mind for future versions of Backstretch. And, I know that others who want to provide min-height and min-width options will appreciate having this as an example.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. Hi Stefan,\n\nThanks for the pull request. I hadn't documented this before, but you can always access the images array through your instance. I've updated the documentation to make this more apparent.\n\n``` javascript\n$('.foo').backstretch([\n  'path/to/image.jpg',\n  'path/to/image2.jpg',\n  'path/to/image3.jpg'\n]);\n\n// Access the instance\nvar instance = $('.foo').data('backstretch');\n\n// Then, you can manipulate the images array directly\ninstance.images.push('path/to/image4.jpg')\n```\n. Hello,\n\nSorry for not replying sooner. It looks like this issue has been resolved. If it hasn't, please feel free to reopen this issue.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Backstretch needs jQuery v1.7 or higher. It looks like you're running v1.4.2. Trying upgrading jQuery, and see if that resolves the issue.\n. Hello,\n\nUnfortunately, I don't have an alternate version that supports older versions of jQuery. That said, I imagine you could modify the script yourself pretty easily, replacing the \"on/off\" calls with \"bind/unbind\".\n\nBest of luck,\nScott\n. Hi David,\n\nThanks for providing this pull request. I don't think I'll be adding it to the repo at this time, but I will definitely keep it in consideration for a future version of Backstretch. And, I know that the others will appreciate having this an example.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. It kind of depends on whether you're attaching Backstretch to the body or a block-level element. For example's sake, let's say it's the body:\n\n``` javascript\nvar images = [\n  \"/path/to/image1.jpg\",\n  \"/path/to/image2.jpg\",\n  \"/path/to/image3.jpg\"\n];\n\n// Start Backstretch, and save a reference to it.\n// Note: this is the part that would be different if you were attaching Backstretch to a block-level element\nvar slideshow = $.backstretch(images);\n\n// Let's say you had a link with an id of \"next\"\n$(\"#next\").click(function (e) {\n  // Prevent the link's default behavior\n  e.preventDefault();\n\n  // Call next on Backstretch\n  slideshow.next();\n});\n```\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Hello,\n\nFrom what I can tell, it looks like this issue has been resolved. If you are still experiencing troubles with Backstretch, feel free to reopen the issue.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. Hello,\n\nI just took a look at the website, and it seems as though you've resolved this problem. I'm going to close this issue. Please feel free to reopen it if you are still experiencing troubles.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Yeah, I'm seeing this too. I'll take a look at it.\n. Can you please give this a try, and see if it a) fixes the flicker and b) doesn't mess up the slideshow in any other browser?\n\nhttps://raw.github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/wip/src/jquery.backstretch.js\n\nThanks,\nScott\n. Thanks, Brett! I really appreciate you taking a look at this\n. Hello,\n\nThe plugin should listen for a resize event on its container (including block-level elements), so I'm not sure why it would only be firing on a window resize. That said, you can always manually force a resize like so:\n\n``` javascript\n// Call backstretch\n$(\"#element\").backstretch(\"/path/to/image.jpg\");\n\n// Access the Backstretch instance\nvar instance = $(\"#element\").data(\"backstretch\");\n\n// Call the resize method\ninstance.resize();\n```\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. I've tested this on a few machines and sites, and I can't seem to reproduce the problem. Backstretch (both older and current versions) uses jQuery's standard fadeIn function. The only potential issue that I could see is if a fadeIn was occurring during a window resize.\n\nI'm going to close this for now, but feel free to reopen it if you have any additional information, or if anyone else experiences a similar issue.\n. Unfortunately, I can't seem to replicate the issue viewing your site on my computer. I don't think v2 of Backstretch will resolve the issue, since it's also using the same fadeIn method. Sorry.\n. Ah, that may be why I wasn't seeing it. I was testing on FF 17 on OS X 10.8.\n\nI can't say for certain, but I imagine that it has something to do with fadeIn of a large image (as opposed to HTML fade-ins), and the way that XP handles that calculation. Maybe in Vista and beyond it's done through hardware acceleration?\n\nFortunately, the number of users on Windows XP using FF 17 is probably very small.\n. Typically, I've seen that error when the Backstretch script is not included in a page before the plugin is called, either because it failed to download, was included in the wrong order. If you provide a link to the site in question, I can take a look for you.\n\nSecondarily, it looks like you're missing the closing parenthesis on your `$(document).ready()` call. I don't think this is the cause of the issue, but still something that you'll want to update.\n. Hello,\n\nIt looks like you're including jQuery twice, one on Line 52:\n\n``` html\n<script type='text/javascript' src='http://beta.albertorivero.com/wp-content/themes/ReverieRiverov1/js/jquery.js?ver=3.4.2'></script>\n```\n\nAnd again on Line 251 as part of this script:\n\n``` html\n<script type='text/javascript' src='http://beta.albertorivero.com/wp-content/themes/ReverieRiverov1/js/foundation.min.js?ver=3.4.2'></script>\n```\n\nSince Backstretch is included before line 251, when the page loads the second version of jQuery, it overwrites the previous instance, including all references to previously installed plugins. So, by the time you execute `$(document).ready()`, Backstretch is no longer installed.\n\nAt some point, you should look into removing this duplication, but for the sake of fixing your Backstretch errors, the easiest thing for you to do would be to move the Backstretch include and any references to it below Line 251.\n\nBest of luck,\nScott\n. Usually, that error is associated with the Backstretch plugin itself not loading, either from not being found, or being included too late in the page.\n\nCan you please send me a link to the page that you're trying to implement this on? I can take a look.\n. Is there a way for you to link to external javascript file, rather than including the Backstretch plugin inline? It looks like that's what you've done inside of the `<customhtml>` block. And, from what I can tell, that's what is causing the error.\n. For right now, no, but very soon it should be listed on http://cdnjs.com/.\n. Hello,\n\nThanks so much for your pull request. Especially for including a test. I really need to starting making more of those!\n\nQuestion: what is the advantage of having Backstretch fire a resize event, as opposed to listening to the same resize event that Backstretch listens to. e.g. $.backstretch() listens for $(window).resize() events, and $(\"#foo\").backstretch() listens for resize events on #foo.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. It looks like Safari 5.0 does not like max-width of Backstretch's image set to \"none\". I put that attribute in there to prevent issues associated with Bootstrap, and other responsive queries that set max-width to 100%.\n\nIf you need Safari 5.0 support, and don't have any responsive img conflicts, you can remove that attribute. It is set on Line 91 of the uncompressed script.\n\nAlso, if you have any solutions better than that one I'm using, please feel free to submit a pull request.\n. Hello, Simon,\n\nThanks for the suggestion. I just submitted the pull request.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. Unfortunately, that functionality falls outside the scope of what Backstretch is meant to do. That said, here is a bit of code that should push you in the right direction:\n\n``` javascript\n$(\".backstretch\").on(\"click\", function () {\n  document.location.href = \"http://example.com\";\n});\n```\n. For iOS devices, you'll need to set the viewport width:\n\nhttp://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/UsingtheViewport/UsingtheViewport.html\n\nYou can try the simplest one, and tweak accordingly for your needs:\n\n``` html\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width\">\n```\n. You can add that pretty easily using the \"fade\" parameter. It takes integers, or jQuery speed strings. e.g.\n\n``` javascript\n$.backstretch(\"/path/to/image.jpg\", { fade: \"slow\" });\n```\n\nThe reason this isn't enabled by default is for legacy continuity. The original versions of Backstretch didn't fade in, and I thought it would be jarring to have someone upgrade, and experience something unexpected.\n. Hello. I took a look in FF 12 (Mac), and didn't see any issues. What version of FF are you testing, and on what OS version (e.g. Mountain Lion).\n\nAlso, when you say \"the background from the left column\" are you referring to the backstretched image, or the content area? If you can attach a screenshot to this issue, that would be helpful.\n. I just updated to FF17 on 10.8.2, and it had no problems. To me, it looks like the left column's background is intact, and in place (you can see a defined white line). It almost looks as though the fade in of the Backstretch image didn't complete. Can you try setting the fade variable to 0, so that there isn't a fadeIn, and see if you still notice the issue.\n. I'm going to close out this ticket, but if anyone else experiences the same issue, please comment/reopen. Thanks.\n. Hi Teva,\n\nYou can always call Backstretch again, and pass in a new image value. That should stop any existing slideshow/backstretch, and display the image. e.g.\n\n``` html\n<a class=\"gallery\" href=\"/path/to/image.jpg\">Gallery link</a>\n\n<script>\n  $(\"a.gallery\").click(function (e) {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    var imageSrc = $(this).attr(\"href\");\n    $.backstretch(imageSrc);\n  });\n</script>\n```\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. It's hard to say what's going on without see it in context, but my first guess is that Backstretch doesn't like that the parent container has a \"backstretch\" class. The plugin itself creates a DIV with the class \"backstretch\" and inserts it into the container. Try renaming your container class to \"backstretch-container\" or the liked, and see if that fixes the problem.\n\nIf that doesn't work, please post a link to the page in question, and I'll take a look.\n. Or the simplest:\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n\nThe other that you've suggested, with multiple if statements, is convenient for conditional CSS/JS (http://html5boilerplate.com/). I wouldn't recommend using an HTML 4 or XML 1 declaration. \n. Hello, Claudio,\n\nWhat you're seeing is probably the correct behavior. Backstretch resizes the image to fit your browser window, but depending on the proportions of the window, the image will either be wider or taller, cropping the edges.\n\nIf you're looking for something that doesn't crop the image, and compatibility with older browsers isn't an issue, I recommend looking at the background-size CSS property.\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Thanks, Zeke.\n. It's outside the scope of this plugin, but if you're comfortable editing the source, I recommend looking at the resize function around Line 166. That's where the logic is for setting the size/position.\n. I'd recommend checking out [Hammer.js](http://eightmedia.github.com/hammer.js/). It can help you capture swipe events, which you can then use to trigger .next() or .prev() calls on the Backstretch instance.\n. @pepperstreet: that's very thorough, thank you. What site were you using for your tests?\n\nRegarding iOS, versions prior to 5 don't support \"position: fixed\", so what you're seeing is a fallback solution. iOS5 and beyond should function as expected.\n\nRegarding Android, I'm at the mercy of testing on BrowserStack as well. From what I can deduce from the emulation tests, the problem appears to be isolated to 4.1. @chrisantonick, are you running 4.1 on your Incredible?\n\nBackstretch uses jQuery's width and height methods to calculate the \"document\" or \"window\" height, depending on whether or not the browser supports fixed positioning. With mobile browsers, this can sometimes be tricky, since there's also a viewport and address bar to contend with. I suspect that this is where we're running into troubles.\n\nIf anyone of you has an Android 4.1 device, and is comfortable editing the Backstretch source code, I'd love to enlist your help in troubleshooting this.\n. I'd recommend using a solution, like [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/), to provide an alternate solution for older browsers, like Safari 3. Best of luck.\n. Unfortunately, I don't think there's a good answer for this. Backstretch, by design, wants to load the image last, so that page content is not withheld from the user while they're waiting for large assets to download. My recommendation is to either shrink the size of your image, or to place a background-color on the container as a fallback, or to display as the visitor waits for the image to download.\n\nSecondarily, if browser compatibility is not an issue, you may want to investigate CSS solutions, like background-size.\n. I don't believe it was ever an option to load before document.ready.\n. If you're only supporting modern browsers, I think that CSS's background-size might be the answer you're looking for.\n. I'd recommend looking at jquery-cookie, or similar plugin, that will help you manage cookie states.\n\nhttps://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie\n. I think the type of help you're looking for may be more appropriate for the jquery-cookie forums, or another plugin that helps set/get cookie values. As far as Backstretch is concerned, you're just going to use the cookie information to set the order of images based on a cookie value.\n. Hi,\n\nYes, it's possible to do with Backstretch, though most of the code you'll need to write would happen in a separate function, one that listens to slide change events. e.g.:\n\n```\nvar texts = [\n  \"Some text for Slide 1\",\n  \"Some text for Slide 2\",\n  \"Some text for Slide 3\",\n  ...\n];\n$(window).on(\"backstretch.show\", function (e, instance) {\n  $(\".overlay\").text( texts[instance.index] );\n});\n```\n\nHope that helps set you in the right direction.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Hello, Ryan,\n\nMy guess is that it's either fadeIn method (if you're using it), or setInterval. In either case, I'm at the mercy of jQuery and the browser vendor, so I'm not sure how to troubleshoot/resolve this. I'm going to close this ticket, but if you are able to come up with a more efficient way to run the script, please do let me know.\n\nThanks,\nScott\n. I'm having trouble replicating the problem. What version of Windows and Chrome are you testing on? Window 7, Chrome 23 works for me.\n. This question has already been answered in the Issues tracker, including Ticket #135.\n. There are two options, [centeredX/centeredY](https://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch#options), that control the position of the image. Though, it will always be cropped in some fashion, depending on the aspect ratio of the user's browser.\n. Hello,\n\nThanks so much for submitting this pull request. I think it may be redundant to the \"backstretch.show\" event, so for the time being, I'm going to close this request. I will, however, continue to consider it for future releases.\n\nThanks,\nScott\n. Every time a new image loads, Backstretch fires an event. If you listen for that event, you can respond much in the same way you would with a callback.\n\nhttps://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/#events\n. Yes, I see it, too. I'm wondering if these are just phantom requests. In the following example, I see the number of file requests go up from 6 to 7, but the KB transferred stays the same.\n\n## On Page Load\n\n![Screen Shot 2013-02-06 at 5 00 33 PM](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/44719/133718/45662128-70b1-11e2-83a5-8bc5d5195c0b.png)\n\n## Another copy of pot-holder.jpg is loaded\n\n![Screen Shot 2013-02-06 at 5 00 38 PM](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/44719/133719/49dad30c-70b1-11e2-97c0-ee10e9f13602.png)\n. There are a few things going on that might be causing the problem. Firstly, the site is using an old version of Backstretch, v1.2.8. The current supported version is 2.0.3. Secondly, there appear to be some markup issues with the page. I recommend looking at the results of the [W3C's markup validator service](http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fdawagner.com%2Fwpsite%2F&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0). And, lastly, fadeIn issues can sometimes be caused by z-indexing. I'd recommend removing some of the menu components, and see if you can isolate which, if any, are causing the issue.\n\nAs you can see from [this other slideshow demo](http://srobbin.com/demos/jquery-backstretch/examples/slideshow.html), it shouldn't be an issue directly caused by Backstretch. So, I'm going to go ahead an close this ticket. Best of luck.\n. I'm not sure I understand your suggestion. Backstretch sizes the image to the browser window, cropping the image to accommodate varying aspect ratios. So, in effect, it should be doing what your screenshot outlines. \n\nCan you please provide examples of a backstretched page? It might help communicate the point more clearly.\n. No, I'm sorry, I still don't think I understand what you mean. Are you saying that part of the image is being cut off, and you'd prefer that you see the entire image?\n. That's the way it's supposed to behave. It mimics the functionality of the CSS attribute \"background-size: cover\". It sounds like you might be looking for a different solution, something similar to \"background-size: contain\". \n\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/background-size\n. Yes, that's the type of code you'd use to swap out captions, etc. For example.\n\n``` javascript\nvar items = [\n  { img: \"image1.jpg\", caption: \"This is the first caption.\"},\n  { img: \"image2.jpg\", caption: \"This is the second caption.\"}\n];\n\nvar images = $.map(items, function(i) { return i.img; });\n\n$.backstretch(images);\n\n$(window).on(\"backstretch.show\", function(e, instance) {\n  var newCaption = items[instance.index].caption;\n  $(\".caption\").text( newCaption );\n});\n```\n. Can you please provide a link to a test page? I can't promise that I'll help debug your website, but I can take a quick look, and see if it's a simple fix.\n. It looks like your code refers to the \"slideshow.show\" event, when it should be listening for \"backstretch.show\".\n. \"backstretch.show\" is a predefined event that is thrown by the plugin. It is not affected by your variable name. Try changing \"slideshow.show\" to \"backstretch.show\", and you'll see your caption appear.\n. You should be able to call \"resize\" on the instance. e.g.\n\n``` javascript\n$(\"#foo\").backstretch(\"/path/to/image.jpg\");\n\nvar instance = $(\"#foo\").data(\"backstretch\");\ninstance.resize();\n```\n\nHope that helps.\n. I don't there should be any issue with using Backstretch and Bootstrap together, specifically with fixed elements. I've tested it myself, and don't see any problems with the fixed navbar.\n\nDo you have a link to the page you're having trouble with. I can't promise that I'll help resolve your problem, but I can take a quick look.\n. The version of Backstretch that you're using in the fiddle is v1.2.8. Block-level element support was added in v2.0. If you update your version of Backstretch, it should work.\n. It looks like you're using [jQuery v1.6.4](http://aaronhutten.com/js/jquery.min.js) on your site, and Backstretch requires at least v1.7. Updating it to a more recent version should resolve any problems you might have been having.\n. Duplicate #159.\n. I just added a new way to call prev/next on a Backstretch slideshow:\n\n``` javascript\n// First, create a Backstretch slideshow\n$.backstretch([\n  \"path/to/first.jpg\",\n  \"path/to/second.jpg\",\n  \"path/to/third.jpg\"\n]);\n\n// You'll probably attached the prev/next calls to some sort of click event\n$(\"a#next\").click(function () {\n  // Just call Backstretch again, and pass in the prev/next command\n  $.backstretch(\"next\");\n\n  return false;\n});\n```\n. @KamesG Can you please provide a link to the page that's not working?\n. Ah, I see what's happening. You'll need to call Backstretch's next method on the original section:\n\n```\n$('#section-header').backstretch(\"next\");\n```\n. It looks like the issue is related to something other than Backstretch itself. Rather, you've got multiple versions of jQuery, and [a custom noConflict script](http://www.gregbrockbank.us/sites/all/modules/jqmulti/js/switch.js?monyft). All of which is resulting in an error message saying that the \"on\" method can't be found for jQuery.\n\nUnfortunately, this is beyond the scope of help that I can offer. Best of luck.\n. Unfortunately, I'm not available for that kind of help. Though, there seem to be other Drupal developers in these forums; maybe they've worked their way through these issues, and would be willing to help.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. Thank you, Marius!\n. I've seen that kind of error when the version of jQuery is previous to 1.7,\nbut not for 1.9. Do you have a link to the site where you're seeing it?\n\n## \n\nScott Robbin\nshort: twitter.com/srobbin\nlong: srobbin.com\n\nOn Sun, Apr 7, 2013 at 2:54 PM, viperassasin notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> I keep getting this error when I try to use the newest version of\n> backstretch 2.03 Object [object Object] has no method 'on' it is\n> complaining about the calls to $(window).on I'am currently using 1.9 jquery.\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/issues/227\n> .\n. That URL doesn't seem to be accessible. It redirects to http://69.146.106.236:8080\n\nRegarding your second question, I'd prefer if we could keep this thread to the \"no method 'on'\" topic. There are other resolved issues in the tracker that deal with white gaps; I'd recommend that you take a look at those.\n. I'm sorry to say, but the link is still not accessible.\n. I recently corresponded with someone about this. It looks like Cargo Collective uses an older version of jQuery. Current versions of Backstretch require at least jQuery v1.7. Updating jQuery in your Cargo template should resolve any problems you might be having.\n. I just added \"backstretch.before\" and \"backstretch.after\" events in Commit deda81d71cff63c1644089206e767c5d37c16496. Thanks for the suggestion.\n. Hello,\n\nBackstretch fills the screen with your image, and may crop it depending on the aspect ratio of the browser window (if you resize the window, you'll notice that different parts of the image are cut off). This is normal.\n\nIf you're looking for a solution that doesn't crop the image, I recommend taking a look at the CSS background-size property, however you won't have the ability for a slideshow, and there are some browser compatibility limitations.\n\n\u2013Scott \n. The destroy method can be used one of two ways:\n\n1) Calling `destroy(true)` leaves the `.backstretch` div in place, but destroys the Backstretch plugin instance.\n2) Calling `destroy()` deletes everything.\n\nThe default is to destroy everything. The plugin uses the boolean preserveBackground parameter internally.\n. I think Bootstrap's Jumbotron Carousel example is meant to be a slideshow in and of itself, not necessarily something that you'd use _with_ Backstretch. I'd recommend using one or the other.\n. Thank you.\n. If you only want to set opacity on Backstretch images, and leave the container's content intact, then you could probably use a CSS snippet like this:\n\n``` CSS\n.backstretch img {\n  opacity: 0.9;\n  filter: alpha(opacity=90);\n}    \n```\n. Unfortunately, Backstretch does not have an align-to-bottom option, only top, left, and centering. If you are comfortable with JavaScript, you could fork the plugin, and modify the resize function.\n. This is a duplicate of Issue #200. I'm going to close this ticket, if you'd like to continue the discussion in the other thread.\n\nThat said, my thoughts are similar to @nenebale. I think this may be a phantom inspector request, and that multiple images are not being sent.\n. I haven't tried it, but I imagine that you could add CSS transitions to `.backstretch` or `.backstretch img`. If you get it working, please post a gist here. I'm sure others would like to see your solution, too.\n. Thanks for the pull request. I'm curious, why is the jQuery dependency 1.8.3 instead of, say, 1.9.1?\n. Ah, thanks! I'm not too familiar with Bower, so I didn't know if that dependency was a lowest-common-denominator value. Pulling now...\n. It also makes me realize that the README docs and project files are behind, too. I'll update those as well... Thanks.\n. I may wait to merge in a few more changes before bumping the version number, but it will happen soon. Thanks.\n. Are you including the scripts at the top or bottom of your webpage?\n. Good. Do you have a link that you could share?\n. It looks like you have an older version of Backstretch installed (v1.2.8), which doesn't support the `next()` method. Try updating to the latest version (v.2.0.3), and it should work.\n. @musicjunk is right, both your prev and next buttons are labelled as with an `id=\"next\"`.\n\nAlso, you are only passing in the first image to Backstretch:\n\n``` javascript\n$.backstretch(images[index], {speed: 500});\n```\n\nWhen you should be passing in the whole array of images:\n\n``` javascript\n$.backstretch(images, {speed: 500});\n```\n. Hello @illeggittimo,\n\nI'm sorry, I can't help you troubleshoot this issue. I can say, though, that removing the `[]` will definitely not work. Backstretch accepts two parameters, the first of which has to be an array if you're using it as a slideshow.\n\nTake a look at the documentation for the plugin. This thread is an old one, and the API for working with slideshows has changed. You'd now advance the slideshow by calling `$(\"#P02\").backstretch(\"next\")`.\n\nBest of luck,\nScott\n. No, I don't have any plans to store state in a cookie. The main issue is that jQuery doesn't natively support cookies. To do so, you'd like have to use a third-party plugin, like https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie. And I'd rather not add another dependency to Backstretch.\n\nTo answer your question, though, you should be able to do this yourself by listening forw the `backsretch.show` event, and setting a cookie then.\n. Yes, could definitely do that. You'd just need to reference the link attribute instead of the caption:\n\n```\nvar caption = items[instance.index].caption;\nvar link = items[instance.index].link;\nvar img = items[instance.index].img;\n```\n. Hi Ian,\n\nBackstretch does not have a scrollTo function. It uses the built-in window.scrollTo in a couple of places, but does not declare its own function with that name. Maybe the error message is referring to another issue?\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Either way, I'm glad to hear that you were able to workaround the issue.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. If you're able to share a link to a website that highlights the error, I can take a look at it.\n. Ah, I see what's happening. When you're creating your own scrollTo function, you're overwriting the browser's native window.scrollTo:\n\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.scrollTo\n\nAny plugin that uses window.scrollTo will fail, since it's expecting that function to behave a certain way. You are correct in that the best workaround for this is to name your custom function something other than scrollTo.\n. Just pushed a fix for this. Commit 6e4bae96b4585b097999d655d3cae59b5a89bcb3.\n. Duplicate of Issue #200. \n\nTo recap, I think this may just be a Web Inspector artifact, and that the browser is not redownloading images.\n. Hi,\n\nTry using the index that's passed into the event function, rather than fetching yourself. The before event is called before anything, so the `.index` hasn't been updated yet.\n\n```\n$(window).on(\"backstretch.before\", function (e, instance, index) {\n    $('.thumb').removeClass('act').eq(index).addClass('act'); \n});\n```\n. Not right now, but I'll consider adding 'backstretch.paused' and 'backstretch.resumed' events into future versions.\n. This goes more to your second question: no, Backstretch will crop any image to fit the size of the window/element, regardless of aspect ratio. It behaves very similarly to the CSS `background-size: cover` property. `background-size: contain` may be more what you're after.\n. Hello,\n\nNot with Backstretch, though you may want to look at the CSS `background-size: contain` property/value.\n\n\u2013Scott\n. Hi Steve,\n\nJust set it up like you see in the README or examples folder, and it'll loop by default.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n. You should just be able to use the following CSS rule (inside of your media query):\n\n``` css\n.backstretch {\n  display: none;\n}\n```\n. I imagine that you could get what you need by listening to the window's `resize` event, then doing a calculation, subtracting `$(\".backstretch\").width()` from the `$(window).width()`.\n\nHope that helps.\n. The latest version of the plugin doesn't use the live function. Any older version of Backstretch that does is unsupported.\n. Thanks for letting me know. Updated in commit 241a345. \n. Thanks for letting me know. It looks like it's an issue with my web host not pointing to the right directory. I've contacted them, and hope to have it back up soon.\n. The site should be back up and running now. Thanks again for letting me know.\n. Looks like the [ignore object/array issue was fixed](https://github.com/jquery-backstretch/jquery-backstretch/commit/bd17813213e771758feb2a47d7ee4980429c79e4) back in October. The [most recent version](https://github.com/jquery-backstretch/jquery-backstretch/blob/master/bower.json) contains both these corrections.\r\n\r\nAre you seeing this error when trying to do a `bower update`? If so, maybe Backstretch needs to be removed entirely, and then re-added. Maybe the JSON is unforgivingly fatal to that process.. Thanks for letting us know.. ",

Hi having a problem with no images loading for the past 5 days of trying with backstretch.  Checked all my file paths, have proper library plugins, checking order of markup, checked order of scripts.  Any ideas?  please help!  \n\nHere is my code:\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n\n```\n<html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n\n<head>\n<head profile=\"http://gmpg.org/xfn/11\">\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"new_website/new_site_css/stylesheet2.css\" type=\"text/css\" media=\"screen\" title=\"CSS\" charset=\"utf-8\" />\n<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"chrome=1\">\n```\n\n</head> \n\n<body>\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.2/jquery.min.js\"></script>\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"new_website/jquery.backstretch.js\"></script>\n\n<script>\n  $.backstretch([\n    \"new_website/images/2.png\",\n    \"new_website/images/3.png\",\n    \"new_website/images/4.png\"    \n  ], {duration: 4000, fade: 750});\n  \n    </script>\n\n</body>\n</html> \n\nI don't have any css declared, FYI.

Backstretch may not be working due to some HTML errors. You can see them here:\n\nhttp://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fnowinmotion.org%2Fwordpress%2F&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0\n\nAlso, your site seems to have been hacked. If you view the source code from that page, you'll see a bunch of spam links at the top.\n\nRegarding the Backstretch plugin, unfortunately that's not something that I developer or have any control of.

Backstretch may not be working due to some HTML errors. You can see them here:\n\nhttp://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fnowinmotion.org%2Fwordpress%2F&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0\n\nAlso, your site seems to have been hacked. If you view the source code from that page, you'll see a bunch of spam links at the top.\n\nRegarding the Backstretch plugin, unfortunately that's not something that I developer or have any control of. Hopefully, the developer will respond to you soon.\n\nUnfortunately, all of these issues fall outside the scope of the Backstretch plugin itself, so I'm going to close this ticket.\n\nBest of luck,\nScott\n\n---\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/issues/138#issuecomment-9138474\n.

I've experimented with the CSS blur filter here: http://codepen.io/ultraloveninja/live/HAjmb\n\nOnly thing is that you'd have to append the you body tag since backstretch appends it to that (I think).\n. I'm using FF 17.0.1 and on Lion 10.7.5.\n\nIt looks like it's the background from the content area. I've attached a screen shot.\n\nI also tested it out on another Mac with the same setup and it load fine.\n\nAlso (I just noticed this) if I let the page sit for about 10 seconds it starts to work.\n\nSo, I might just be me...

Ok, setting the fade to 0 seemed to take care of it. I also set it to 200 for fun to see if that did anything and it did get stuck on the fade (see attached photo). So yeah.

I have been trying like this:\n\n```\n    var items = [\n            { img: \"images/slide1.jpg\", caption: \"This is the first caption.\"},\n            { img: \"images/slide2.jpg\", caption: \"This is the second caption.\"},\n            { img: \"images/slide3.jpg\", caption: \"This is the third caption.\"},\n            { img: \"images/slide4.jpg\", caption: \"This is the fourth caption.\"}\n        ];\n\n        var options = {\n            fade: \"slow\",\n            duration: 4000\n        };\n\n        var images = $.map(items, function(i) { return i.img; });\n\n        // Start Backstretch, and save a reference to it.\n        var slideshow = $.backstretch(images,options);\n\n        $(window).on(\"backstretch.show\", function(e, instance) {\n            var newCaption = items[instance.index].caption;\n            $(\".backstretch-caption\").text( newCaption );\n        });\n\n        $(\".slide-prev\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            slideshow.prev();\n        });\n        $(\".slide-pause\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            slideshow.pause();\n        });\n        $(\".slide-next\").click(function(e){\n            e.preventDefault();\n            slideshow.next();\n        });\n```\n\nIt works but I can't see the captions. So... any clues? Thanks in advance!\n. I think we are misunderstanding each other. I tried your method and it works all except the CSS. The CSS is simply ignored, weather I use !important or not.\n\nJS:\n\n```\n$.backstretch([\n    \"images/slide1.jpg\",\n    \"images/slide2.jpg\",\n    \"images/slide3.jpg\",\n    \"images/slide4.jpg\"\n], {\n    fade: 750,\n    duration: 4000\n});\nvar texts = [\n    \"Beskrivning f\u00f6r Slide 1\",\n    \"Beskrivning f\u00f6r Slide 2\",\n    \"Beskrivning f\u00f6r Slide 3\",\n    \"Beskrivning f\u00f6r Slide 4\"\n];\n    $(window).on(\"backstretch.show\", function (e, instance) {\n    $(\".overlay-2\").text( texts[instance.index] );\n});\n```\n\nHTML:\n\n```\n<div class=\"12u\">\n    <div class=\"overlay-2\">\n        <!-- L\u00e4gg ingenting h\u00e4r -->\n    </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nCSS:\n\n```\n.overlay-2 {\n    position: relative;!important\n    left:50%;!important\n    top:50%;!important\n    background: #FFF;!important\n    padding: 12px;!important\n    font-size: 28px;!important\n    color: #2A2A2A;!important\n    border-left: 5px solid #0FF438;!important\n    z-index:9999;!important\n}\n```\n\nRESULT: http://lfsolutions.se/prototyper/nomo/\n. Seems like I get the face palm of the year! It works as you state! Sorry for have not realizing it before. Hope it helps other people who make the same mistake as me. Thank you so very much!\n. ",
    "musicjunk": "Hi, style the .overlay class in your css. Use !important attribute to override inline css.\nI've no example slideshow with overlay text but this shoud work.\n. Hallo Scott,\n\nI've tested the new \"before\" event to add the border on my slideshow before image loads. Well the thing is that the border is added not before showing the image, but the border was added to the previous image before the shown image. I used the same code as in the first question of this issue. \"before\" instead of \"show\" event.\n\n```\n$(window).on(\"backstretch.before\", function (e, instance, index) {\n     var getCurrent = $(\"body\").data(\"backstretch\").index; \n     $('.thumb').removeClass('act').eq(getCurrent).addClass('act'); \n});\n```\n\nWith this code above the css class is added to the image before the shown, but not to the same image before shown. Do I something wrong or is it a bug?\n. Hi,\nthis is a CSS case and has nothing to do with backstretch. The way to solve this is to use a 90% transparent png image file as background and not opacity in your main container.\n. Hi, just some sorting and position problems. Do it like this:\n\n``` html\n<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd\">\n<html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n<head>\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=utf-8\" />\n<title>Potatisverkstaden</title>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"css.css\">\n    </head>\n<body>\n<div id=\"main\"></div>\n    <script src=\"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.1/jquery.min.js\"></script> \n    <script src=\"http://www.elli.nu/potatis/js/jquery.backstretch.min.js\"></script>\n    <script>\n        $.backstretch(\"http://www.elli.nu/potatis/images/background.png\");\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nCall the main library first and any other related scripts like backstretch thereafter.\nCall backstretch inside the body tags.\n. Hi, I''ve teset the prev/next with this:\n\n``` html\n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd\">\n<html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n<head>\n    <title>Test page</title>\n    <style>\n    html, body {height:100%;}\n    .prev, .next {background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0.5);border-radius:10px;padding:10px;margin:10px;display:inline-block;}\n\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n<p>\n<div style=\"margin:50px 0 0 50px; width:200px;\">\n<a id=\"prev\" class=\"prev\" href=\"#\">PREV</a>\n<a id=\"next\" class=\"next\" href=\"#\">NEXT</a>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://me3.us/test/js/jquery-1.9.1.min.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://me3.us/test/js/jquery.backstretch.js\"></script>\n\n\n<script>\n    // Create an array of images that you'd like to use\n         $('body').backstretch([\n        \"http://me3.us/test/images/backgrounds/image1.jpg\",\n        \"http://me3.us/test/images/backgrounds/image2.jpg\",\n        \"http://me3.us/test/images/backgrounds/image3.jpg\"\n        ], {duration: 5000, speed: 2000});\n\n      //$('body').data('backstretch').pause();\n\n        // The index variable will keep track of which image is currently showing\n        var index = 0;\n\n        // Call backstretch for the first time,\n        // In this case, I'm settings speed of 500ms for a fadeIn effect between images.\n       // $.backstretch(images[index], {speed: 500});\n\n        // Set an interval that increments the index and sets the new image\n        // Note: The fadeIn speed set above will be inherited\n\n    $('#next').click(function(x) {\n        x.preventDefault();\n        $('body').data('backstretch').next();\n    });\n    $('#prev').click(function(x) {\n            x.preventDefault();\n            $('body').data('backstretch').prev();\n        });\n\n    </script>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nIt works. An you have a markup-error in the prev-button. Still wrong id=\"next\".\n. Cool! Works perfect. So simple. Thank you Scott.\n. Hi Scott, thank you! \n@all:  The current version at the date of this querstion is \"Backstretch - v2.0.4 - 2013-06-19\".\nMaybe the next version would have these events.\n. Hi, I dont't know if backstretch provides that, but I work with a absolute positioned overlay div and fade it out on window load instead of document ready.\nIt works fine fore me.\n. Hi, I've tested it with the slideshow.html file, that comes within the bakstrecht zip-package.\nAnd it works with jquery-1.10.2.js and backstretch 2.0.4\n\nHere ist the example:\n\n``` javascript\n $.backstretch([\n          \"pot-holder.jpg\",\n          \"coffee.jpg\",\n          \"dome.jpg\"\n        ], {\n            fade: 750,\n            duration: 4000\n        });\n        $(\"#pot-holder\").click(function (e) {\n        e.preventDefault();\n          $.backstretch('show', 0);\n        });\n\n        $(\"#dome\").click(function (e) {\n        e.preventDefault();\n          $.backstretch('show', 2);\n        });\n```\n\nThe source jquery file you posted doesn't work. Take a new one from the jquery page.\nYou have to define a array of images to get the 'show' event work. 0 = first image, 2 = third or here the last one.\n. Hi, if done somthing similar. Backstretch counts itself. Use the index of backstretch to highlight pagers or thumbs.\n\n``` javascript\n// Set the \"act\" class for the first pager on document ready, the backstretch .before is called\n$('.pager').first().addClass('galact');\n$(window).on(\"backstretch.before\", function (e, instance, index) {\n  $('.pager').removeClass('act').eq(index).addClass('act');\n  });\n```\n\nHere the class \"act\" was given to the pager with the correct index, before image loads.\n\nIf you want to click on a pager to show it's image, add this before the above lines in $(document).ready:\n\n``` javascript\nvar $navs = $(\".pager\");\n // Get the instance of Backstretch\nvar instance = $(\"body\").data(\"backstretch\");\n$navs.click(function () {\n  // use the index of pagers\n  var index = $navs.index( $(this) );\n  $(this).removeClass('galact');\n  $(this).addClass('galact');\n  // Since you called it as $.backstretch, it's attached to the body\n  // Show the slide based on the clicked pager index\n  instance.show(index);\n  // Return false, so that the click doesn't change the page hash\n  return false;\n});\n```\n\nIs working fine. Adapt it to your needs. You should have the same amount of pagers as images, thats mantadory of cause.\nMaybe it helps.\n. Hi, if you set backstretch right, backstretch should start the slideshow automatically. There is only a way to \"pause\" and \"resume\" the instance. Please have a look at the examples on the main page https://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch.\n. Hi, use the same code for \"next\" as for \"prev\"\n\n``` javascript\n$(\"#next\").click(function(event) {\nevent.preventDefault();\n$('.slider').backstretch(\"next\");\n})\n```\n. Hi, what do you mean with fix? Do you mean don't change the size of backstretch-image while change div dimensions? If the div does not change it's dimensions backstrecht should do nothing.\n. Hi,\nthe website that you linked has nothing to do with backstetch. Without any code or example nobody can help you.\nOf cause backstretch does fit images into the window or a div with scaling correctly while resize the window or div.\n. Hi,\n\nyou can hide it with css: @media print { #backstretch {display:none; }}\n. Hi, here is a example for prelaoding and random Image order..\nhttps://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/issues/320\n\nhope this helps.\n. Hi,\nHere it is discussed: https://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/issues/135.\nI think you'll need an array like the example. Please use the search field above. there are some issues about that.\n. Hi, yes erease this line:\n\n$(document).click(function(){\n  setBackground();\n. Hi mstabes,\n\n``` javascript\nvar images = [\n  your images\n];\n\n// Preload\n$(images).each(function(){\n  $(\"<img/>\")[0].src = this;\n});\n\n// Random index\nvar randomNumber = Math.floor( Math.random() * images.length );\n\n// Call backstretch the first time\n$.backstretch(images[randomNumber], {speed: 1000});\n\n// Change images after that with setInterval\nsetInterval(function() {\n        index = Math.floor( Math.random() * images.length );\n        $.backstretch(images[index]);\n    }, 3000);\n```\n\nMaybe this is not the best way, but works so far. The way discussed here with the shuffle-script is maybe better:\nhttps://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/issues/197\n. Hi digitalgym,\nbluring images isn't so easy without flash. I've done that with overlayed images blured in photoshop and fade it to the unblured, but without backstretch. Maybe you write a script to change the pause time of the slideshow. The thing is that blur fades only look nice if you fade first to the blured version of img1, after that to the blured version of img2, than to unblured img2 and again to blured img2 before fade to blured img3 .... and so on. This looks like real nice blurefades.\n. Hi, I don't know exactly but I think you have to destroy the instance of backstretch at first, and than load the next set of images. Take a look at the slideshow API. I remember there are some issues with destroy and using more than one instance on one page.\n. you can load with one image and put the \"push\" event to a $(window).load(function()\nto expand the image array after page has loaded. (push is explained on mainpage here)\nSo far it seems not  working on Mac Safari but mabe there is a fix somewhere. For full cross-browser support there are other solutions for  $(window).load(function() on air.\n. Hi,\n\nif done it with CSS classes for the set of simple bullet pagination. \nYou'll need a set (same quantitiy as backstretch images) of bullets in your HTML code, each bullet(image or character) with class=\"pag\". Put this inside document ready.\n\n``` javascript\n// Set active for the first bullet when document ready;;\n$('.pag').first().addClass('pagact');\n// Since you called it as $.backstretch, it's attached to the body\nvar instance = $(\"body\").data(\"backstretch\");\n$('.pag').click(function () {\n  var index = $('.pag').index( $(this) );\n  $('.pag').removeClass('pagact');\n  $(this).addClass('pagact');\n  // Show the slide based on the clicked index\n  instance.show(index);\n  // Return false, so that the click doesn't change the page hash\n  return false;\n});\n// Set the current pagination active while running as slideshow\n$(window).on(\"backstretch.before\", function (e, instance, index) {\n  $('.pag').removeClass('pagact').eq(index).addClass('pagact');\n  });\n```\n\nMaybe not the best way but it works.\n. Hi, nice site and artwork. Is your content loading with ajax? You keep staying on the same site? If so, more than 1 way to do.\nYou can destroy the instance of backstretch or build a fadein overlay with opacity or full white. \nI thinK the overlay is here the best.\n. I don't know cargo. Do you have access or rights to change the sourcecode of your site?\n. Well lets do a test. Replace the complete code with the URLs to your image with this:\n\n``` javascript\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n$(document).ready(function(){\n// Splash IMG URLs\nvar splashIMGs = [\n    'http://payload269.cargocollective.com/1/11/358924/7686945/fundo_home_3000.jpg',\n    'http://payload269.cargocollective.com/1/11/358924/7686945/fundo_home_3000.jpg',\n\n];\n\n    // A little script for preloading all of the images\n    // It's not necessary, but generally a good idea\n    $(images).each(function(){\n       $('<img/>')[0].src = this; \n    });\n\n    // The index variable will keep track of which image is currently showing\n    var index = 0;\n\n    // Call backstretch for the first time,\n    // In this case, I'm settings speed of 500ms for a fadeIn effect between images.\n    $.backstretch(images[index], {speed: 500});\n\n    // Set an interval that increments the index and sets the new image\n    // Note: The fadeIn speed set above will be inherited\n    setInterval(function() {\n        index = (index >= images.length - 1) ? 0 : index + 1;\n        $.backstretch(images[index]);\n    }, 5000);\n\n$('.navigation a').each(function (index, element){\n    $(this).click(function(){\n         $('#backstretch').fadeOut(1000);\n});\n});\n\n// close document ready, don't remove.\n    });\n</script>\n```\n\nI just added some lines.\nYou find this block with the urls at the end of your rtf file before the script block of google-analytics.\nthen backstretch should fade out by click on a project.\nIf this is working, please remove the two script block with the backstretch-code at start of the rtf document for a test. i mean Version 1.2.2 and Version 1.2.8. I think backstrecht is maybe already implemented.\n. Ok just replace the complete code block with the URLs to your image with this again:\n\n``` javascript\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n// Splash IMG URLs\nvar splashIMGs = [\n    'http://payload269.cargocollective.com/1/11/358924/7686945/fundo_home_3000.jpg',\n    'http://payload269.cargocollective.com/1/11/358924/7686945/fundo_home_3000.jpg',\n\n];\n\n    // A little script for preloading all of the images\n    // It's not necessary, but generally a good idea\n    $(images).each(function(){\n       $('<img/>')[0].src = this; \n    });\n\n    // The index variable will keep track of which image is currently showing\n    var index = 0;\n\n    // Call backstretch for the first time,\n    // In this case, I'm settings speed of 500ms for a fadeIn effect between images.\n    $.backstretch(images[index], {speed: 500});\n\n    // Set an interval that increments the index and sets the new image\n    // Note: The fadeIn speed set above will be inherited\n    setInterval(function() {\n        index = (index >= images.length - 1) ? 0 : index + 1;\n        $.backstretch(images[index]);\n    }, 5000);\n$(document).ready(function(){    \n$('.navigation a').each(function (index, element){\n    $(this).click(function(){\n         $('#backstretch').fadeOut(1000);\n});\n});\n\n// close document ready, don't remove.\n    });\n</script>\n```\n\nThat all. Test it should work. Press F5 to reload your browser completely while testing.\n. Take the original code from rtf document and only replace the section above.\n. OK, there are many strange behaviours on this site. Let's try this:\nReplace the same block with:\n\n``` javascript\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n// Splash IMG URLs\nvar splashIMGs = [\n    'http://payload269.cargocollective.com/1/11/358924/7686945/fundo_home_3000.jpg',\n    'http://payload269.cargocollective.com/1/11/358924/7686945/fundo_home_3000.jpg',\n\n];\n\n    // A little script for preloading all of the images\n    // It's not necessary, but generally a good idea\n    $(images).each(function(){\n       $('<img/>')[0].src = this; \n    });\n\n    // The index variable will keep track of which image is currently showing\n    var index = 0;\n\n    // Call backstretch for the first time,\n    // In this case, I'm settings speed of 500ms for a fadeIn effect between images.\n    $.backstretch(images[index], {speed: 500});\n\n    // Set an interval that increments the index and sets the new image\n    // Note: The fadeIn speed set above will be inherited\n    setInterval(function() {\n        index = (index >= images.length - 1) ? 0 : index + 1;\n        $.backstretch(images[index]);\n    }, 5000);\n\n$('body').mouseover(function() {\nvar projectImg = $('.project_content').find('img');\nif($(projectImg).length > 0) {\n    $('#backstretch').fadeOut(1000);\n} else {\n    $('#backstretch').fadeIn(1000);\n};\n});\n</script>\n```\n\nHope it works. After click the project you have to move with the mouse to fadeOut backstretch.\n. Hi, why alsways calling \"data\"?? \nTest this:\n\n``` javascript\n$('#your selector').backstretch(tab);\n    $('#your selector').backstretch(\"pause\");\n\n    $(\".forward\").click( function(e){\n        e.preventDefault();\n       $('#your selector').backstretch(\"next\");\n    }); \n\n    $(\".backward\").click(function(e){\n        e.preventDefault();\n       $('#your selector').backstretch(\"prev\");\n    }); \n```\n\nif this works, you know where the problem is. Data is calling the hole instance I think\n. Have you placed backstretch and after that your js at the bottom of your HTML? This is mantadory.\n. Hi, please download the Zip of backstretch with the examples. Open the example \"slideshow\" and replace the hole code with this:\n\n``` html\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <style>\n        body { font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.3em; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; }\n        .container {\n            width: 90%;\n            margin: 20px auto;\n            background-color: #FFF;\n            padding: 20px;\n        }\n        pre, code {\n        font-family: Monaco, Menlo, Consolas, \"Courier New\", monospace;\n        font-size: 12px;\n        color: #333;\n        -webkit-border-radius: 3px;\n        -moz-border-radius: 3px;\n        border-radius: 3px;\n      }\n      pre { border: 1px solid #CCC; background-color: #EEE; color: #333; padding: 10px; overflow: scroll; }\n      code { padding: 2px 4px; background-color: #F7F7F9; border: 1px solid #E1E1E8; color: #D14; }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <h1>NEXT - PREV Demo</h1>\n\n        <p>\n            <input type=\"button\" id=\"next\" value=\"Next\" />\n            <input type=\"button\" id=\"prev\" value=\"Prev\" />\n        </p>\n        <pre>&lt;script src=&quot;//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.3/jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;script src=&quot;jquery.backstretch.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\n    $.backstretch([\n      &quot;pot-holder.jpg&quot;,\n      &quot;coffee.jpg&quot;,\n      &quot;dome.jpg&quot;\n      ], {\n        fade: 750,\n        duration: 4000\n    });\n&lt;/script&gt;</pre>\n    </div>\n    <script src=\"../libs/jquery/jquery.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"../src/jquery.backstretch.js\"></script>\n    <script>\n        $.backstretch([\n          \"pot-holder.jpg\",\n          \"coffee.jpg\",\n          \"dome.jpg\"\n        ], {\n            fade: 750,\n            duration: 4000\n        });\n        $(\"#next\").click(function (e) {\n        e.preventDefault();\n          $.backstretch('next');\n        });\n\n        $(\"#prev\").click(function (e) {\n        e.preventDefault();\n          $.backstretch('prev');\n        });\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThan you save it as \"next-prev.html\" in the folder where the examples are. And....it works fine. check it out.\nThere is something wrong in your code somewhere. \n. The next-prev.html should work without irritation, if  you replaced the slideshow code as I wrote.\nIs there a irritation with the new next-prev.html example? If yes pleas check out a other browser to test. My FF works fine with the next-prev.html.\n. Hi,\nmaybe  change the order works:\n\n``` javascript\n$('body').data('backstretch').show(identifier);\n$('body').data('backstretch').pause(); \n```\n\nshow before pause.\n\nI've made a test with the example slideshow and it works perfect. I just add last line.\n\n``` javascript\n$.backstretch([\n          \"pot-holder.jpg\",\n          \"coffee.jpg\",\n          \"dome.jpg\"\n        ], {\n            fade: 750,\n            duration: 4000\n        });\n$('body').backstretch(\"show\", 1)\n```\n\nThis will open the coffee.jpg on page open.\n. Ok,\nit's maybe simpler than guessed.\nInitialize backstretch like this:\n\n``` javascript\n$.backstretch(images[identifier], {speed: 500}); \n```\n\nNo \"show\" needed.\n. Hmm... damn! But maybe a combination with \"push\" will work. The only bad thing is that you have to change the order vor each page.\n. Hi,\nlook here: https://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/issues/194 or https://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/issues/205\n. Hi SpazzMarticus,\n\nthis looks great!! Thank you. Many users has been waiting for that.\n. Hi, this is simple. IE 8 and below does not like faults. In your image array img No. 9 does not exist.\ni checked the link to it. There is no image. \n. Hm, now it is there. But there is a missing http:\nbefore\n//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js in the source. \nI've added the http: and it works fine in IE8 and IE7. Put your js inside index.min.js in document ready. \n. Hi, \nyour index-js does not work verry well. Try:\n\n``` javascript\n$(document).ready(function() {\n$(\"#nav .sub-menu\").hide();\n$(\"#nav > ul > li > a\").on(\"click\",function(){$(this).next(\".sub-menu\").slideToggle()});\n$(\"#nav-trigger\").on(\"click\",function(){\n        $(\"#nav\").fadeToggle()});\n\n$(\"a.popup-link\").on(\"click\",function(){\n    popupWindow($(this).attr(\"href\"),\"\");\n    return false;\n    });\n\nfunction footerHeight(){\n    if ($(window).width() < 768){\n    $(\"#content\").css({\"padding-bottom\":\"200px\"});\n    $(\"#footer\").css({\"height\":\"200px\"});\n\n    } else {\n    $(\"#content\").css({\"padding-bottom\":\"68px\"});\n    $(\"#footer\").css({\"height\":\"68px\"});\n    };\n};\n\n\n$(window).resize(footerHeight);\n\n\nfunction popupWindow(e,n){\n    var i=screen.width,o=screen.height,t=i*.8,r=o*.8;\n    parent.window.open(e,n,\"top=150,left=150,height=\"+r+\",width=\"+t);\n    return false;\n    };\n\n\n});\n```\n\nMaybe it helps.\n. Ok try this: dont use the image no 9. Example:\n\n``` html\n$(function () {\n                $.backstretch([\n        'http://www.harronhomes.com/wp-content/themes/harron/img/backgrounds/background01.jpg',\n        'http://www.harronhomes.com/wp-content/themes/harron/img/backgrounds/background02.jpg',\n        'http://www.harronhomes.com/wp-content/themes/harron/img/backgrounds/background03.jpg',\n        'http://www.harronhomes.com/wp-content/themes/harron/img/backgrounds/background04.jpg',\n        'http://www.harronhomes.com/wp-content/themes/harron/img/backgrounds/background05.jpg',\n        'http://www.harronhomes.com/wp-content/themes/harron/img/backgrounds/background01.jpg',\n        'http://www.harronhomes.com/wp-content/themes/harron/img/backgrounds/background02.jpg',\n        'http://www.harronhomes.com/wp-content/themes/harron/img/backgrounds/background03.jpg',\n        'http://www.harronhomes.com/wp-content/themes/harron/img/backgrounds/background04.jpg',\n        'http://www.harronhomes.com/wp-content/themes/harron/img/backgrounds/background05.jpg',\n        'http://www.harronhomes.com/wp-content/themes/harron/img/backgrounds/background06.jpg'\n\n        ], {duration: 3000, fade: 1000});\n        });\n```\n\nit should loop. Maybe there is somethin wrong no 9 (see my first post)\n. Hi, you can use a lazy loading found here:\nhttps://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/pull/388\nThe other way is to use the push function of backstretch. Load your site with only one or two images and push the others up after page loaded. In jquery thats \n$( window ).load(function() {\n// Run code\n});\nHopethis helps.\n. Hi, I don't say use !important in general. Only if you want to overwrite inline styles.\nI guess the function:\n\n$(window).on(\"backstretch.show\", function (e, instance) {\n    $(\".overlay\").text( texts[instance.index] );\n\nis looking for a container with class overlay and put the text in there and does not create the container itself.\nCreate a static empty div with perhaps class overlay-2  and change the function to:\n\n$(window).on(\"backstretch.show\", function (e, instance) {\n    $(\".overlay-2\").text( texts[instance.index] );\n\nThis should work I think. The div class overlay-2 has to exist, so backstretch can put the text in.\n. Hi, everything is ok. Your slide-text is inside div .overlay-2. \nBut your css is not correct. \n!important goes inside the semicolon, like this:  position: absolute !important;\nnot outside. This is CSS and has nothing to do only with backstetch.\nBut you need no !important because you don't override inline css.\nExample:\n.overlay-2 {\nposition: absolute;\nleft:50%;\ntop:50%;\nbackground: #FFF;\npadding: 12px;\nfont-size: 28px;\ncolor: #000;\n}\n. Hi, have you ever tried this with images less than 100kb?? I've no Win 64bit but I've noticed problems with large imagesizes before. So maybe this wil help.\n. Hi,\nfirst there is a wrong path to first image:\n\n``` javascript\n    $(\"#bgPhoto\").backstretch([\n      \"/images/JS2015_AWC2904_wide_72dpi.jpg\",\n      \"images/slide2.jpg\",\n      \"images/slide3.jpg\"\n      ], {\n        fade: \"slow\",\n        duration: 5000\n    });\n```\n\nfirst / (slash) is to much.\nSecond the image slide2.jpg has 5 MB and is realy to large for internet.\nTipp: use exact the same dimensions for all images. And rename the first image to slide1.jpg. I've recognised some problems with to much underscores and others\n\nWith that it should run. Nice work.\n. Hi , I don't know what you mean with that: \"even from the sun and illuminate the key\".\nIs there one div for all images, but you want different slideshows for each menu item?\n. Hi, I don't understand you, sorry I can't look in your head.\nWhat is \"images flowed even sunglasses\" ? Is this a fade in of the image or what?\nAnd what you mean with \"lights up with the status \"active\"\"? Do you want a active status of the menubottom?\n. Hi,\nHere are two issues that help:\nYou can show the image with the index.\nhttps://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/issues/136\nhttps://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/issues/72\n\nBut speed is outdated use \"fade\" instead.\n\nA sliding can't be done so far with backstetch only fades are possible.\n. Hi, \nthe problem on your demosite \"Honda\" is that the images are cutted because of backstretch, because this is how backstetch works. Alway fit but not the entire image.  \nHere is a pure css solution to fit images with a given ratio/dimension to a webpage.\nJust a alternative, but you has to chage the design a little bit.\n. Well put the Logo at the place of honda and honda on the right side.\nThe contactform can be shown on pageload, so that everybody see it. Then slide to the right. just leave a button to slide out. Make the image the whole width or 90%. The you have no fixed page height but you can make a footer. \nSorry i've forgot the link:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/20590239/maintain-aspect-ratio-of-div-but-fill-screen-width-and-height-in-css\n. Hi,\nwhat happend if you use only the start up image on load? The other images can be loaded after the page has loaded. This technic is called lazy loading?\nbut first please chack if this is the reason.\n. Hi, look at the EXIF information on flickr. The Rotation is 180\u00b0.. No, backstretch doesn't care of this. That's the reason why it is not rotated correct. The thing is that the original is upside down and rotated in flickr.\r\nDownload the original and open it - it is upside down.. Hi, style the .overlay class in your css. Use !important attribute to override inline css.\nI've no example slideshow with overlay text but this shoud work.\n. Hallo Scott,\n\nI've tested the new \"before\" event to add the border on my slideshow before image loads. Well the thing is that the border is added not before showing the image, but the border was added to the previous image before the shown image. I used the same code as in the first question of this issue. \"before\" instead of \"show\" event.\n\n```\n$(window).on(\"backstretch.before\", function (e, instance, index) {\n     var getCurrent = $(\"body\").data(\"backstretch\").index; \n     $('.thumb').removeClass('act').eq(getCurrent).addClass('act'); \n});\n```\n\nWith this code above the css class is added to the image before the shown, but not to the same image before shown. Do I something wrong or is it a bug?\n. Hi,\nthis is a CSS case and has nothing to do with backstretch. The way to solve this is to use a 90% transparent png image file as background and not opacity in your main container.\n. Hi, just some sorting and position problems. Do it like this:\n\n``` html\n<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd\">\n<html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n<head>\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=utf-8\" />\n<title>Potatisverkstaden</title>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"css.css\">\n    </head>\n<body>\n<div id=\"main\"></div>\n    <script src=\"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.1/jquery.min.js\"></script> \n    <script src=\"http://www.elli.nu/potatis/js/jquery.backstretch.min.js\"></script>\n    <script>\n        $.backstretch(\"http://www.elli.nu/potatis/images/background.png\");\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nCall the main library first and any other related scripts like backstretch thereafter.\nCall backstretch inside the body tags.\n. Hi, I''ve teset the prev/next with this:\n\n``` html\n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd\">\n<html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n<head>\n    <title>Test page</title>\n    <style>\n    html, body {height:100%;}\n    .prev, .next {background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0.5);border-radius:10px;padding:10px;margin:10px;display:inline-block;}\n\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n<p>\n<div style=\"margin:50px 0 0 50px; width:200px;\">\n<a id=\"prev\" class=\"prev\" href=\"#\">PREV</a>\n<a id=\"next\" class=\"next\" href=\"#\">NEXT</a>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://me3.us/test/js/jquery-1.9.1.min.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://me3.us/test/js/jquery.backstretch.js\"></script>\n\n\n<script>\n    // Create an array of images that you'd like to use\n         $('body').backstretch([\n        \"http://me3.us/test/images/backgrounds/image1.jpg\",\n        \"http://me3.us/test/images/backgrounds/image2.jpg\",\n        \"http://me3.us/test/images/backgrounds/image3.jpg\"\n        ], {duration: 5000, speed: 2000});\n\n      //$('body').data('backstretch').pause();\n\n        // The index variable will keep track of which image is currently showing\n        var index = 0;\n\n        // Call backstretch for the first time,\n        // In this case, I'm settings speed of 500ms for a fadeIn effect between images.\n       // $.backstretch(images[index], {speed: 500});\n\n        // Set an interval that increments the index and sets the new image\n        // Note: The fadeIn speed set above will be inherited\n\n    $('#next').click(function(x) {\n        x.preventDefault();\n        $('body').data('backstretch').next();\n    });\n    $('#prev').click(function(x) {\n            x.preventDefault();\n            $('body').data('backstretch').prev();\n        });\n\n    </script>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nIt works. An you have a markup-error in the prev-button. Still wrong id=\"next\".\n. Cool! Works perfect. So simple. Thank you Scott.\n. Hi Scott, thank you! \n@all:  The current version at the date of this querstion is \"Backstretch - v2.0.4 - 2013-06-19\".\nMaybe the next version would have these events.\n. Hi, I dont't know if backstretch provides that, but I work with a absolute positioned overlay div and fade it out on window load instead of document ready.\nIt works fine fore me.\n. Hi, I've tested it with the slideshow.html file, that comes within the bakstrecht zip-package.\nAnd it works with jquery-1.10.2.js and backstretch 2.0.4\n\nHere ist the example:\n\n``` javascript\n $.backstretch([\n          \"pot-holder.jpg\",\n          \"coffee.jpg\",\n          \"dome.jpg\"\n        ], {\n            fade: 750,\n            duration: 4000\n        });\n        $(\"#pot-holder\").click(function (e) {\n        e.preventDefault();\n          $.backstretch('show', 0);\n        });\n\n        $(\"#dome\").click(function (e) {\n        e.preventDefault();\n          $.backstretch('show', 2);\n        });\n```\n\nThe source jquery file you posted doesn't work. Take a new one from the jquery page.\nYou have to define a array of images to get the 'show' event work. 0 = first image, 2 = third or here the last one.\n. Hi, if done somthing similar. Backstretch counts itself. Use the index of backstretch to highlight pagers or thumbs.\n\n``` javascript\n// Set the \"act\" class for the first pager on document ready, the backstretch .before is called\n$('.pager').first().addClass('galact');\n$(window).on(\"backstretch.before\", function (e, instance, index) {\n  $('.pager').removeClass('act').eq(index).addClass('act');\n  });\n```\n\nHere the class \"act\" was given to the pager with the correct index, before image loads.\n\nIf you want to click on a pager to show it's image, add this before the above lines in $(document).ready:\n\n``` javascript\nvar $navs = $(\".pager\");\n // Get the instance of Backstretch\nvar instance = $(\"body\").data(\"backstretch\");\n$navs.click(function () {\n  // use the index of pagers\n  var index = $navs.index( $(this) );\n  $(this).removeClass('galact');\n  $(this).addClass('galact');\n  // Since you called it as $.backstretch, it's attached to the body\n  // Show the slide based on the clicked pager index\n  instance.show(index);\n  // Return false, so that the click doesn't change the page hash\n  return false;\n});\n```\n\nIs working fine. Adapt it to your needs. You should have the same amount of pagers as images, thats mantadory of cause.\nMaybe it helps.\n. Hi, if you set backstretch right, backstretch should start the slideshow automatically. There is only a way to \"pause\" and \"resume\" the instance. Please have a look at the examples on the main page https://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch.\n. Hi, use the same code for \"next\" as for \"prev\"\n\n``` javascript\n$(\"#next\").click(function(event) {\nevent.preventDefault();\n$('.slider').backstretch(\"next\");\n})\n```\n. Hi, what do you mean with fix? Do you mean don't change the size of backstretch-image while change div dimensions? If the div does not change it's dimensions backstrecht should do nothing.\n. Hi,\nthe website that you linked has nothing to do with backstetch. Without any code or example nobody can help you.\nOf cause backstretch does fit images into the window or a div with scaling correctly while resize the window or div.\n. Hi,\n\nyou can hide it with css: @media print { #backstretch {display:none; }}\n. Hi, here is a example for prelaoding and random Image order..\nhttps://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/issues/320\n\nhope this helps.\n. Hi,\nHere it is discussed: https://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/issues/135.\nI think you'll need an array like the example. Please use the search field above. there are some issues about that.\n. Hi, yes erease this line:\n\n$(document).click(function(){\n  setBackground();\n. Hi mstabes,\n\n``` javascript\nvar images = [\n  your images\n];\n\n// Preload\n$(images).each(function(){\n  $(\"<img/>\")[0].src = this;\n});\n\n// Random index\nvar randomNumber = Math.floor( Math.random() * images.length );\n\n// Call backstretch the first time\n$.backstretch(images[randomNumber], {speed: 1000});\n\n// Change images after that with setInterval\nsetInterval(function() {\n        index = Math.floor( Math.random() * images.length );\n        $.backstretch(images[index]);\n    }, 3000);\n```\n\nMaybe this is not the best way, but works so far. The way discussed here with the shuffle-script is maybe better:\nhttps://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/issues/197\n. Hi digitalgym,\nbluring images isn't so easy without flash. I've done that with overlayed images blured in photoshop and fade it to the unblured, but without backstretch. Maybe you write a script to change the pause time of the slideshow. The thing is that blur fades only look nice if you fade first to the blured version of img1, after that to the blured version of img2, than to unblured img2 and again to blured img2 before fade to blured img3 .... and so on. This looks like real nice blurefades.\n. Hi, I don't know exactly but I think you have to destroy the instance of backstretch at first, and than load the next set of images. Take a look at the slideshow API. I remember there are some issues with destroy and using more than one instance on one page.\n. you can load with one image and put the \"push\" event to a $(window).load(function()\nto expand the image array after page has loaded. (push is explained on mainpage here)\nSo far it seems not  working on Mac Safari but mabe there is a fix somewhere. For full cross-browser support there are other solutions for  $(window).load(function() on air.\n. Hi,\n\nif done it with CSS classes for the set of simple bullet pagination. \nYou'll need a set (same quantitiy as backstretch images) of bullets in your HTML code, each bullet(image or character) with class=\"pag\". Put this inside document ready.\n\n``` javascript\n// Set active for the first bullet when document ready;;\n$('.pag').first().addClass('pagact');\n// Since you called it as $.backstretch, it's attached to the body\nvar instance = $(\"body\").data(\"backstretch\");\n$('.pag').click(function () {\n  var index = $('.pag').index( $(this) );\n  $('.pag').removeClass('pagact');\n  $(this).addClass('pagact');\n  // Show the slide based on the clicked index\n  instance.show(index);\n  // Return false, so that the click doesn't change the page hash\n  return false;\n});\n// Set the current pagination active while running as slideshow\n$(window).on(\"backstretch.before\", function (e, instance, index) {\n  $('.pag').removeClass('pagact').eq(index).addClass('pagact');\n  });\n```\n\nMaybe not the best way but it works.\n. Hi, nice site and artwork. Is your content loading with ajax? You keep staying on the same site? If so, more than 1 way to do.\nYou can destroy the instance of backstretch or build a fadein overlay with opacity or full white. \nI thinK the overlay is here the best.\n. I don't know cargo. Do you have access or rights to change the sourcecode of your site?\n. Well lets do a test. Replace the complete code with the URLs to your image with this:\n\n``` javascript\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n$(document).ready(function(){\n// Splash IMG URLs\nvar splashIMGs = [\n    'http://payload269.cargocollective.com/1/11/358924/7686945/fundo_home_3000.jpg',\n    'http://payload269.cargocollective.com/1/11/358924/7686945/fundo_home_3000.jpg',\n\n];\n\n    // A little script for preloading all of the images\n    // It's not necessary, but generally a good idea\n    $(images).each(function(){\n       $('<img/>')[0].src = this; \n    });\n\n    // The index variable will keep track of which image is currently showing\n    var index = 0;\n\n    // Call backstretch for the first time,\n    // In this case, I'm settings speed of 500ms for a fadeIn effect between images.\n    $.backstretch(images[index], {speed: 500});\n\n    // Set an interval that increments the index and sets the new image\n    // Note: The fadeIn speed set above will be inherited\n    setInterval(function() {\n        index = (index >= images.length - 1) ? 0 : index + 1;\n        $.backstretch(images[index]);\n    }, 5000);\n\n$('.navigation a').each(function (index, element){\n    $(this).click(function(){\n         $('#backstretch').fadeOut(1000);\n});\n});\n\n// close document ready, don't remove.\n    });\n</script>\n```\n\nI just added some lines.\nYou find this block with the urls at the end of your rtf file before the script block of google-analytics.\nthen backstretch should fade out by click on a project.\nIf this is working, please remove the two script block with the backstretch-code at start of the rtf document for a test. i mean Version 1.2.2 and Version 1.2.8. I think backstrecht is maybe already implemented.\n. Ok just replace the complete code block with the URLs to your image with this again:\n\n``` javascript\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n// Splash IMG URLs\nvar splashIMGs = [\n    'http://payload269.cargocollective.com/1/11/358924/7686945/fundo_home_3000.jpg',\n    'http://payload269.cargocollective.com/1/11/358924/7686945/fundo_home_3000.jpg',\n\n];\n\n    // A little script for preloading all of the images\n    // It's not necessary, but generally a good idea\n    $(images).each(function(){\n       $('<img/>')[0].src = this; \n    });\n\n    // The index variable will keep track of which image is currently showing\n    var index = 0;\n\n    // Call backstretch for the first time,\n    // In this case, I'm settings speed of 500ms for a fadeIn effect between images.\n    $.backstretch(images[index], {speed: 500});\n\n    // Set an interval that increments the index and sets the new image\n    // Note: The fadeIn speed set above will be inherited\n    setInterval(function() {\n        index = (index >= images.length - 1) ? 0 : index + 1;\n        $.backstretch(images[index]);\n    }, 5000);\n$(document).ready(function(){    \n$('.navigation a').each(function (index, element){\n    $(this).click(function(){\n         $('#backstretch').fadeOut(1000);\n});\n});\n\n// close document ready, don't remove.\n    });\n</script>\n```\n\nThat all. Test it should work. Press F5 to reload your browser completely while testing.\n. Take the original code from rtf document and only replace the section above.\n. OK, there are many strange behaviours on this site. Let's try this:\nReplace the same block with:\n\n``` javascript\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n// Splash IMG URLs\nvar splashIMGs = [\n    'http://payload269.cargocollective.com/1/11/358924/7686945/fundo_home_3000.jpg',\n    'http://payload269.cargocollective.com/1/11/358924/7686945/fundo_home_3000.jpg',\n\n];\n\n    // A little script for preloading all of the images\n    // It's not necessary, but generally a good idea\n    $(images).each(function(){\n       $('<img/>')[0].src = this; \n    });\n\n    // The index variable will keep track of which image is currently showing\n    var index = 0;\n\n    // Call backstretch for the first time,\n    // In this case, I'm settings speed of 500ms for a fadeIn effect between images.\n    $.backstretch(images[index], {speed: 500});\n\n    // Set an interval that increments the index and sets the new image\n    // Note: The fadeIn speed set above will be inherited\n    setInterval(function() {\n        index = (index >= images.length - 1) ? 0 : index + 1;\n        $.backstretch(images[index]);\n    }, 5000);\n\n$('body').mouseover(function() {\nvar projectImg = $('.project_content').find('img');\nif($(projectImg).length > 0) {\n    $('#backstretch').fadeOut(1000);\n} else {\n    $('#backstretch').fadeIn(1000);\n};\n});\n</script>\n```\n\nHope it works. After click the project you have to move with the mouse to fadeOut backstretch.\n. Hi, why alsways calling \"data\"?? \nTest this:\n\n``` javascript\n$('#your selector').backstretch(tab);\n    $('#your selector').backstretch(\"pause\");\n\n    $(\".forward\").click( function(e){\n        e.preventDefault();\n       $('#your selector').backstretch(\"next\");\n    }); \n\n    $(\".backward\").click(function(e){\n        e.preventDefault();\n       $('#your selector').backstretch(\"prev\");\n    }); \n```\n\nif this works, you know where the problem is. Data is calling the hole instance I think\n. Have you placed backstretch and after that your js at the bottom of your HTML? This is mantadory.\n. Hi, please download the Zip of backstretch with the examples. Open the example \"slideshow\" and replace the hole code with this:\n\n``` html\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <style>\n        body { font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.3em; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; }\n        .container {\n            width: 90%;\n            margin: 20px auto;\n            background-color: #FFF;\n            padding: 20px;\n        }\n        pre, code {\n        font-family: Monaco, Menlo, Consolas, \"Courier New\", monospace;\n        font-size: 12px;\n        color: #333;\n        -webkit-border-radius: 3px;\n        -moz-border-radius: 3px;\n        border-radius: 3px;\n      }\n      pre { border: 1px solid #CCC; background-color: #EEE; color: #333; padding: 10px; overflow: scroll; }\n      code { padding: 2px 4px; background-color: #F7F7F9; border: 1px solid #E1E1E8; color: #D14; }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <h1>NEXT - PREV Demo</h1>\n\n        <p>\n            <input type=\"button\" id=\"next\" value=\"Next\" />\n            <input type=\"button\" id=\"prev\" value=\"Prev\" />\n        </p>\n        <pre>&lt;script src=&quot;//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.3/jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;script src=&quot;jquery.backstretch.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\n    $.backstretch([\n      &quot;pot-holder.jpg&quot;,\n      &quot;coffee.jpg&quot;,\n      &quot;dome.jpg&quot;\n      ], {\n        fade: 750,\n        duration: 4000\n    });\n&lt;/script&gt;</pre>\n    </div>\n    <script src=\"../libs/jquery/jquery.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"../src/jquery.backstretch.js\"></script>\n    <script>\n        $.backstretch([\n          \"pot-holder.jpg\",\n          \"coffee.jpg\",\n          \"dome.jpg\"\n        ], {\n            fade: 750,\n            duration: 4000\n        });\n        $(\"#next\").click(function (e) {\n        e.preventDefault();\n          $.backstretch('next');\n        });\n\n        $(\"#prev\").click(function (e) {\n        e.preventDefault();\n          $.backstretch('prev');\n        });\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThan you save it as \"next-prev.html\" in the folder where the examples are. And....it works fine. check it out.\nThere is something wrong in your code somewhere. \n. The next-prev.html should work without irritation, if  you replaced the slideshow code as I wrote.\nIs there a irritation with the new next-prev.html example? If yes pleas check out a other browser to test. My FF works fine with the next-prev.html.\n. Hi,\nmaybe  change the order works:\n\n``` javascript\n$('body').data('backstretch').show(identifier);\n$('body').data('backstretch').pause(); \n```\n\nshow before pause.\n\nI've made a test with the example slideshow and it works perfect. I just add last line.\n\n``` javascript\n$.backstretch([\n          \"pot-holder.jpg\",\n          \"coffee.jpg\",\n          \"dome.jpg\"\n        ], {\n            fade: 750,\n            duration: 4000\n        });\n$('body').backstretch(\"show\", 1)\n```\n\nThis will open the coffee.jpg on page open.\n. Ok,\nit's maybe simpler than guessed.\nInitialize backstretch like this:\n\n``` javascript\n$.backstretch(images[identifier], {speed: 500}); \n```\n\nNo \"show\" needed.\n. Hmm... damn! But maybe a combination with \"push\" will work. The only bad thing is that you have to change the order vor each page.\n. Hi,\nlook here: https://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/issues/194 or https://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/issues/205\n. Hi SpazzMarticus,\n\nthis looks great!! Thank you. Many users has been waiting for that.\n. Hi, this is simple. IE 8 and below does not like faults. In your image array img No. 9 does not exist.\ni checked the link to it. There is no image. \n. Hm, now it is there. But there is a missing http:\nbefore\n//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js in the source. \nI've added the http: and it works fine in IE8 and IE7. Put your js inside index.min.js in document ready. \n. Hi, \nyour index-js does not work verry well. Try:\n\n``` javascript\n$(document).ready(function() {\n$(\"#nav .sub-menu\").hide();\n$(\"#nav > ul > li > a\").on(\"click\",function(){$(this).next(\".sub-menu\").slideToggle()});\n$(\"#nav-trigger\").on(\"click\",function(){\n        $(\"#nav\").fadeToggle()});\n\n$(\"a.popup-link\").on(\"click\",function(){\n    popupWindow($(this).attr(\"href\"),\"\");\n    return false;\n    });\n\nfunction footerHeight(){\n    if ($(window).width() < 768){\n    $(\"#content\").css({\"padding-bottom\":\"200px\"});\n    $(\"#footer\").css({\"height\":\"200px\"});\n\n    } else {\n    $(\"#content\").css({\"padding-bottom\":\"68px\"});\n    $(\"#footer\").css({\"height\":\"68px\"});\n    };\n};\n\n\n$(window).resize(footerHeight);\n\n\nfunction popupWindow(e,n){\n    var i=screen.width,o=screen.height,t=i*.8,r=o*.8;\n    parent.window.open(e,n,\"top=150,left=150,height=\"+r+\",width=\"+t);\n    return false;\n    };\n\n\n});\n```\n\nMaybe it helps.\n. Ok try this: dont use the image no 9. Example:\n\n``` html\n$(function () {\n                $.backstretch([\n        'http://www.harronhomes.com/wp-content/themes/harron/img/backgrounds/background01.jpg',\n        'http://www.harronhomes.com/wp-content/themes/harron/img/backgrounds/background02.jpg',\n        'http://www.harronhomes.com/wp-content/themes/harron/img/backgrounds/background03.jpg',\n        'http://www.harronhomes.com/wp-content/themes/harron/img/backgrounds/background04.jpg',\n        'http://www.harronhomes.com/wp-content/themes/harron/img/backgrounds/background05.jpg',\n        'http://www.harronhomes.com/wp-content/themes/harron/img/backgrounds/background01.jpg',\n        'http://www.harronhomes.com/wp-content/themes/harron/img/backgrounds/background02.jpg',\n        'http://www.harronhomes.com/wp-content/themes/harron/img/backgrounds/background03.jpg',\n        'http://www.harronhomes.com/wp-content/themes/harron/img/backgrounds/background04.jpg',\n        'http://www.harronhomes.com/wp-content/themes/harron/img/backgrounds/background05.jpg',\n        'http://www.harronhomes.com/wp-content/themes/harron/img/backgrounds/background06.jpg'\n\n        ], {duration: 3000, fade: 1000});\n        });\n```\n\nit should loop. Maybe there is somethin wrong no 9 (see my first post)\n. Hi, you can use a lazy loading found here:\nhttps://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/pull/388\nThe other way is to use the push function of backstretch. Load your site with only one or two images and push the others up after page loaded. In jquery thats \n$( window ).load(function() {\n// Run code\n});\nHopethis helps.\n. Hi, I don't say use !important in general. Only if you want to overwrite inline styles.\nI guess the function:\n\n$(window).on(\"backstretch.show\", function (e, instance) {\n    $(\".overlay\").text( texts[instance.index] );\n\nis looking for a container with class overlay and put the text in there and does not create the container itself.\nCreate a static empty div with perhaps class overlay-2  and change the function to:\n\n$(window).on(\"backstretch.show\", function (e, instance) {\n    $(\".overlay-2\").text( texts[instance.index] );\n\nThis should work I think. The div class overlay-2 has to exist, so backstretch can put the text in.\n. Hi, everything is ok. Your slide-text is inside div .overlay-2. \nBut your css is not correct. \n!important goes inside the semicolon, like this:  position: absolute !important;\nnot outside. This is CSS and has nothing to do only with backstetch.\nBut you need no !important because you don't override inline css.\nExample:\n.overlay-2 {\nposition: absolute;\nleft:50%;\ntop:50%;\nbackground: #FFF;\npadding: 12px;\nfont-size: 28px;\ncolor: #000;\n}\n. Hi, have you ever tried this with images less than 100kb?? I've no Win 64bit but I've noticed problems with large imagesizes before. So maybe this wil help.\n. Hi,\nfirst there is a wrong path to first image:\n\n``` javascript\n    $(\"#bgPhoto\").backstretch([\n      \"/images/JS2015_AWC2904_wide_72dpi.jpg\",\n      \"images/slide2.jpg\",\n      \"images/slide3.jpg\"\n      ], {\n        fade: \"slow\",\n        duration: 5000\n    });\n```\n\nfirst / (slash) is to much.\nSecond the image slide2.jpg has 5 MB and is realy to large for internet.\nTipp: use exact the same dimensions for all images. And rename the first image to slide1.jpg. I've recognised some problems with to much underscores and others\n\nWith that it should run. Nice work.\n. Hi , I don't know what you mean with that: \"even from the sun and illuminate the key\".\nIs there one div for all images, but you want different slideshows for each menu item?\n. Hi, I don't understand you, sorry I can't look in your head.\nWhat is \"images flowed even sunglasses\" ? Is this a fade in of the image or what?\nAnd what you mean with \"lights up with the status \"active\"\"? Do you want a active status of the menubottom?\n. Hi,\nHere are two issues that help:\nYou can show the image with the index.\nhttps://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/issues/136\nhttps://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/issues/72\n\nBut speed is outdated use \"fade\" instead.\n\nA sliding can't be done so far with backstetch only fades are possible.\n. Hi, \nthe problem on your demosite \"Honda\" is that the images are cutted because of backstretch, because this is how backstetch works. Alway fit but not the entire image.  \nHere is a pure css solution to fit images with a given ratio/dimension to a webpage.\nJust a alternative, but you has to chage the design a little bit.\n. Well put the Logo at the place of honda and honda on the right side.\nThe contactform can be shown on pageload, so that everybody see it. Then slide to the right. just leave a button to slide out. Make the image the whole width or 90%. The you have no fixed page height but you can make a footer. \nSorry i've forgot the link:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/20590239/maintain-aspect-ratio-of-div-but-fill-screen-width-and-height-in-css\n. Hi,\nwhat happend if you use only the start up image on load? The other images can be loaded after the page has loaded. This technic is called lazy loading?\nbut first please chack if this is the reason.\n. Hi, look at the EXIF information on flickr. The Rotation is 180\u00b0.. No, backstretch doesn't care of this. That's the reason why it is not rotated correct. The thing is that the original is upside down and rotated in flickr.\r\nDownload the original and open it - it is upside down.. ",

Thanks! I got it working using your original suggestion #320 \nIs it possible to have the images change without a mouse click?\n. Hi again,\n\nSorry, I thought I understood what was happening, but clearly not. \n My images are not rotating. I'd like them the switch every 3 seconds.

    "cjwang18": "Thank you Errvald! I was also looking for a lazy load solution and your snippet provides most of the functionality.\n\nHowever I noticed after implementing your solution that backstretch would stop advancing to the next photos.

The restart timer callback will force it resume again. The callback is only called once and does not affect any other aspects of the slideshow. \n\nI also tried calling `.backstretch('resume')` right after pushing the new image (in the original timer callback) but that changes the duration of the slideshow and `.backstretch('resume')` gets called each time a new image is added to the array. \n.

Here is an example:\n![th](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11037068/7004194/83a8f272-dca6-11e4-990f-2e8502f091f1.png)\n\nThe first quarter of the picture loads, followed by blank area, with intermittent sections of the original image.\n\nEdit: Have just noticed new behaviour. While I was writing up this post in a separate tab, I loaded up a few more to find some more examples. After closing those tabs and going back to the original image I linked, it was rendered correctly. I did not refresh the image, but simply hadn't been to the tab in a while.\n. ",
