Closed by d25ad00ff6b03956e9dc328355c36e9b8e8130c5\n. Fixed in 19b479c20249895d28d78d1974d5cefafbce5a1b\n. Merged, thanks!\n. Fixed, thanks!\n. Should be fixed in d12cd0d07c7482eb6c70bdc17730807f752d9b4d\n. https://github.com/rlr/dotjs-addon\n. Can we add the Ubuntu installation commands into the original Rakefile, and also perhaps add a --daemon flag to djsd instead of creating a separate executable?\n. Thanks! Please re-open when ready.\n. This is probably best maintained as a separate project, ala https://github.com/rlr/dotjs-addon\n. Badass.\n\nBonus: this totally works:\n\n```\n$ cat ~/.js/default.js \n$.sayHey = function() {\n  alert('hey')\n}\n$ cat ~/.js/site.com.js\n$.sayHey()\n```\n\nMerged and released as 1.1\n. don&#39;t auto-eval scripts. closed by d8f9b3fcf178c0cf9f4f44ae9a6766f4cb3e3695\n. I would :heart: it if someone created and maintained a `dotjs-ubuntu`. We could point to it in the README.\n\nSince I don't have an Ubuntu machine I can't really test this change nor future patches :(\n. Beautiful, thanks.\n. Further testing reveals this patch doesn't work because launchctl runs in a different shell, i.e. the NODE_PATH and PATH stuff you put in ~/.bash_profile (or wherever) don't get picked up.\n\nI played with some solutions today but overall I think this adds a level of complexity to dotjs I don't want to deal with.\n\nSo for now, just run this command manually somehow if you want .coffee files in ~/.js to work:\n\n```\ncoffee -cbw ~/.js/\n```\n. Can you check the `Console.app` program? Errors and whatnot should show up in there.\n\nDid you install using `rake install`?\n. Can you paste the output of this command:\n\n```\nlaunchctl list | grep github\n```\n. D'oh.\n\nHow about this: `ls -l /usr/local/bin/djsd`\n\nAlso: `rake install:daemon && rake install:agent` then try `launchctl list | grep github` again.\n. Can you please paste the output of `launchctl list | grep github` and `ls -l /usr/local/bin/djsd`\n. Can you check `Console.app` for any errors?\n\nAlso try running this manually and let us know the output: `/usr/local/bin/djsd`\n. Looks like @arvindsv nailed it. I don't install with sudo so I don't have this problem:\n\n```\n$ launchctl list | grep github\n185 -   com.github.dotjs\n```\n. @aehlke @littke Please try again using the latest. If it works, thank @arvindsv!\n. 204 means the server is running but no file was found: http://github.com/defunkt/dotjs/blob/master/bin/djsd#L25\n\nYou have `~/.js/github.com.js`? \n. Shady!\n\nDoes `cat ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.dotjs.plist` have the expected value for `WorkingDirectory`?\n. Expected value being `<string>/Users/chris/.js</string>` where `chris` is your username.\n. My guess is dotjs didn't cleanly shut down and used the wrong working directory, but I'm not 100% sure.\n\nThanks for updating us!\n. Added in 047e2bf2c0270da107df952ad49725c53f71d815\n. Are you running in single user mode? I'm not really sure, but Googling seems to suggest this could be a problem with an OS migration or similar situation.\n\nAre there other files in `~/Library/LaunchAgents`? Do any of them appear in `launchctl list`?\n. Can you try again using the latest and re-open if there's still an issue? Thanks!\n. Thanks, added to the README in 4f48b72437d0c657af8472095ce4d5040948de3b!\n. Pretty sure this is the real fix:\n\n```\nsudo chown -R $USER /usr/local\n```\n\nDoes dotjs not install for you without `sudo`? I don't use `sudo` to install dotjs and it works great.\n. Are you able to provide a proof of concept? Maybe this is na\u00efve, but wouldn't a firewall prevent web pages from hitting your localhost?\n. Fixed by #46\n. This seems like too much but I'd look at a tiny patch.\n. Maybe `--quiet` be the default. I dunno if there's any use in the logging right now since exceptions will still show up in the logfile.\n. Logging is gone in d0892fe1f6c3797f2f95ee02c617fcd35808c11a\n\nWhat is the idea behind specifying a bind address?\n. I :heart: CoffeeScript and wanted to add it in the past (#17) but ultimately decided to keep dotjs simple. \n\nFeel free to fork and create dotcoffee tho ;)\n. This might be my favorite pull request ever.\n\nUnfortunately I can't accept it because I suck at bash and won't be able to add features, fix bugs, or maintain the server :(\n. @OscarGodson Can you try `rake uninstall` then re-installing again? There was a problem when installing before creating a `~/.js` directory that should be fixed now.\n\nAlso you should be able to hit http://localhost:3131 directly now to see if it's working (@schacon removed the error).\n. @keheliya Are you on OS X? Try `mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents/` first\n. I never thought I'd say this:\n\nCobra Commander, you've saved the day!\n. Added in 0462a3eebb4717139af883f57a84df54e5e8de12\n. Ruby and WEBrick are used because they ship with OS X, so we're going to stick with that (or possibly even bash \u2014 #31) for now. Thanks though!\n. Thanks for the patch! We're sticking with Ruby for now (it comes with OS X).\n. Holy smokes.\n\nI'm experimenting with removing the server entirely.

If there's someway around that we'll be a lot closer.\n\nAlso, I symlink `~/.js` into Dropbox (for backups) so I'm still trying to get a serverless approach that lets me continue to do that:\n\n```\n$ ls -l ~/.js\nlrwxr-xr-x  1 chris  staff  32 Apr  8 12:30 /Users/chris/.js -> /Users/chris/Dropbox/repos/dotjs\n```\n. > I don't know if creating a symlink from within the scripts/ dir back to a real ~/.js would work. What do you think? If that works, we can install the plugin and then create a symlink in the extension dir, where scripts/ links to ~/.js.\n\nDoesn't work :(\n. Haven't found a clean solution yet so assuming WEBrick is gonna stay.\n. Merged, thanks!\n. Right now the install process is OS X specific, namely LaunchAgents and `open -a`.\n\nCheck out https://github.com/lyleunderwood/dotjs-ubuntu for Ubuntu, or let us know what OS you're interested in. Thanks!\n.

Instead of using the `Referer`, a better way to secure the scripts would be to do away with the wildcard `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` and instead dynamically set the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to be the same as the origin for the requested script (via the `Origin` request header), and for the server to check of the request URI matches the `Origin`. For example, making a request from https://example.com/ to http://localhost:3131/example.com.js should return a response with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com`\n. No, the firewall shouldn't matter because it's the web browser on your own system that is accessing your local web server, so there's no firewall to go through.\n\nHere's a proof of concept: http://jsfiddle.net/westonruter/446tk/ This is what I had done via XHR in the console when I first discovered this issue, and since I've uninstalled dotjs, so I can't verify this test case works personally. But, if you see the script spitting out the contents of your `default.js` along with the contents for any `example.com.js` you may have, then there is a leak.\n. ",

I would love to get an explanation or a pointer to where to start looking to fix it.\n. Thank you so much for the explanation and the pointer to how to fix it! That did it.\n. Let's re-open this so it possibly gets more visibility. There is a workaround, but this does still need to be fixed.\n. Updating jquery is straightforward: just copy [the latest](http://jquery.com/download/) jquery into `ext/jquery.js`.\n\nYou can then load an extension in Chrome by checking the \"Developer mode\" checkbox at the top of the extensions page and clicking \"Load unpacked extension...\" Open the `ext` folder, disable or uninstall the old extension, and now you've got the latest jquery loaded in dotjs.\n. I imagine that this requires the Chrome extension to be rebuilt and published. Correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nIf there's any way to do that locally, can someone point out instructions or give me a hint?\n. Closing because we should just update to the latest jQuery version, which is 2.1.1 as of this writing.\n. ",
