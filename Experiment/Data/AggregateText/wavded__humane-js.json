    "wavded": "this was not addressed with fade transitions as the MSIE transition filter API requires content to change in addition to taking snapshots of the state of an element.  went to use the JS api for opacity filter instead, but lowered interval to be more performant - committed 07f785fc76d664552e188f02c5eaf7749b40a733\n. opted for forcing new messages in stead of stacking, to keep lib simple\n. thanks for your report, I cannot duplicate on Safari 5.0.5 on Windows but will try to grab a Mac and see if I can duplicate there.  I did notice an issue on iOS Safari where the notifications wouldn't popup.  Could you try something for me?\n\nFrom the CSS file remove any references to:\n\n```\nvisibility: hidden/visible\n```\n\nAnd see if it works?\n. yeah not ideal, more of a hack, i'll was able to dup on Safari on Mac (but not Windows, same ver), this seems like a Safari bug (namely, Safari doesn't animate the visibility property the same way Chrome, FF, etc do, it completely borks the whole animation), i'll play around with your workaround and see if someone else has reported this issue.\n. opened ticket - https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=64166\n. ticket confirmed, dup of this one -> https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=29984, patch in place, looks like it has to deal with when accelerated composition is on.\n. fixed in 6901b8b8022e49e337c50d2558ae4d1db0d8e4e9\n. hey sweet, i like it!\n. thanks, feel free to put up a description/creds on here if you want\nhttps://github.com/wavded/humane-js/wiki/Themes\n. ahh right because its transitioning from the last class, i'll take a peak\n. ok, it will restore the original class after completion now BUT there is always the possibility that the next notification (depending on the theme) may occur before the original class is restored.  e.g. for the 'jackedup' theme, if you select the success, wait, and then select the log example, it will be fine, but if you click one after another, there is still a little green that will show, which IMO is ok, maybe even desirable in some cases.  Thanks for the report.\n. There are a couple options already available to you in this case, you can shorten the timeout, or use the forceNew option to force the next notification.  Stacking is hard here because there is so much flexibility to what themes you can add but each theme would have to do its own type of stacking, libnotify is the obvious one as it could stack like `growl` but what about `bigbox` or `jackedup`.\n\nOther alternatives to stacking are logging which has also been suggested but IMO that would be better as an extension to this project and not in the core.  I'll keep this ticket open for discussion.\n. I would like to make this customizable.  One idea I had is to say allow three max for stacking but allow the dev to customize the animation for each separately and the JS will handle the class management, so for example:\n\n[ 1 ]\n[ 2 ]\n[ 3 ] \n\n1 was the first in, when its finished, 2 will animated to 1's class and 3 will animate to 2's class and if another notification was added it would animate to 3 if that makes sense.  Thoughts?\n. So I go back and forth on this.  The more I think about it, it seems not to fit the style of humane.js.  Notification systems definitely vary on this point for sure.  As a Linux user, I'm used to one notification at a time, linnotify does this, Ubuntu and Gnome Shell have the same concept.  Enso, for Windows, from which the whole Humane concept was from did one message at a time.  humanmsg, the jQuery plugin, from which this project is derived from, had the same concept.\n\nI've used humanmsg for a number of years, used Enso on windows before I switched to Linux, and now use humane.js for everything I do (lots of single page apps) and I've never had a problem where I needed to display more than one message at a time.  And if I did, it never seems to be a problem to wait a couple seconds.  We haven't had a single client complaint about it as well.\n\nMy workaround for this case was allowing forceNew but that was a really crappy hack IMO and I just removed it because we allow all notification levels to be customized now so you can have your errors longer and other messages shorter.  Closing this issue for now.\n. Another thought to is stacking for mobile would be problematic due to the screen size.  These themes are designed to work on mobile as well as desktop although still experimental.  I could expose the message queue to developers to implement your own stacking with what is cued up which could be rechecked by using the callback functionality that is already built.\n. I added custom events to allow for custom stacking and logging implementations (docs on homepage).  The internal queue is constantly being popped and pushed so I just exposed the events in order for someone to keep and manage their own queue depending on their needs.  Events fire when something is added, shown and hidden (removed).\n. ahh must be a bug with the js for the demo, i'll take look, thx for reporting\n. hmmm. actually i am unable to duplicate, do you have steps to reproduce from a clean refresh?\n. nice :), i'll add some text for that, you get so used to working with it you forget it may not be obvious!\n. ok there was an issue particularly with jackedup that wasn't supporting ie which has been addressed now, as far as the scripting error, i can duplicate if i'm running in IE7 mode, it has to do with the css loading on the demo page, if you run any of the themes independently they work.. i'll take a look at later when i've got some more time, thx\n. sheesh you are right, looks horrible in chrome latest, wonder what switched, will take a look soon\n. this is fixed per 3.0.0 release\n. Thanks for the report, I have seen this on iOS for iPhone as well, there is a known issue particularly with Safari running on Mac (PC is fine), that looks like a fix has been rolled out this past month, I haven't tested it yet however.\n\nhttps://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=29984\n\nThere may be a way to workaround the theme so that it doesn't happen.  I however do not own an iPad, you are welcome to play with the theme animation for a solution.  I think a workaround may be achieved by playing with the CSS.  I'll see if I can dig into this as well.\n. Wow, I've tried many of the suggestion in the link below on my iPhone, and can't get that flicker to stop, on the iPhone it flashes black the first animation, and then its fine.  It seem like you have a different experience that it always flickers which is not what I see on the iPhone:  Are you running iOS 5?\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/4651769/ipad-css3-animation-flickers-after-keyboard-use\n. I ran a mobile version of iOS 5, and the flicker is gone for me.  My guess is the bug got fixed.\n. @samyakbhuta could you check your iOS 4 to see if the flicker is gone?  I updated the code so it without glitch on iOS5 and it may have had a positive affect, i just don't have a device to test it.  Thx.\n. ahh, ok, never thought of this use case, we could allow 0 to never 'finish' but then we would need to have some way to finish it.  have you tried setting it to a really high number?\n. just an fyi @kaihendry I added ability to set the timeout to 0 which completely disables the timeout (it stays up unless forever unless you use other options like `clickToClose` or `forceNew`\n. Awesome work and great idea, I'll take a peak and run through some tests and let you know.\n. @OiNutter, got a chance to play with it and test it, one quirk I noticed, if I have three notifications queued up and the last one has the callback, it will actually fire after the first animation is finished instead of the last.  Otherwise, it looks good, do you mind fixing up that issue and appending your pull request?\n. My gut would be after each notification.  I think the API reads better, because I'm passing a callback and a message and expect that callback to fire when the message has completed.  In your case, my gut is to do a counter if you know you have other callbacks pending or do a callback chain.\n. Thanks I'll run it through some tests!\n. Awesome, seem to pass great.  I wasn't able to merge so I just pulled in the changes and made a commit.  Added you at a contributer to the docs, thanks much!\n. Agreed, its just running automated tests across browsers that I haven't found a good way to do that.  Maybe jasmine, but visually you have to look at all the browsers to make sure the themes look correct and show up how you want so that part isn't really script-able but yeah...\n. there isn't away to do that currently, right now you can either have the notifications clear after the timeout and additionally (after timeout + mouse movement), but interesting idea... i like it\n. I added a click to close option, viewable on the demo page.\n. This may be akin to what is happening over in issue #9 (also webkit based) \n. There is a known webkit issue that is referenced in #9, my gut is it got fixed in the updated OS.  I was able to work around some of it using z-index instead of visibility.  It is related to the stylesheet and not the JS.  All the JS does it apply the class and throw it back the the browser to animate to that class and that where the flickering comes in.  I have been trying hacks to get it to work but haven't been successful, if you come across one that works well, please let me know!\n. I just tested iOS 5 and the flicker there is gone as well.\n. Confirmed new Android 4 has the flicker gone, noticed that the jqmobile peeps have had better success there as well.  I may just fallback to JS animation for older OS.\n. updated code to work without any glitches on iOS v5 and Android 4, it may have had a positive affect on iOS <5 or Android <4 but currently don't have any devices to test.\n. Apparently, earlier versions of mobile webkit did not like it when you animated the zIndex property, which we don't really need to animate but to make it easier to get up and running all themes just by using `transition: all` instead of specifying all the components.  It wasn't obvious that this was causing the issue until iOS5 where you saw the element 'behind' other elements at the start of the animation, and in front after... so anyway yippee!\n. hey awesome!  glad to hear!\n. Hmm that looks correct to me.  Are you able to duplicate on the demo site?  I just did a test turned the option on and then clicked a sample and clicked a notification and it closed, do you have a sample page that duplicates the issue?  And which browser you tested?\n. it will remove after the timeout, the clickToClose was just an additional option for a user to remove a popup if they don't want to wait the timeout.  in your case you'd have to set the timeout to a large number... but maybe when i think about it we could modify timeout behavior so if you do:\n\n```\nhumane.timeout = 0\n```\n\nIt will do the same, since that is pretty useless atm.\n. I added ability to disable timeout by setting it to 0\n. Good idea, thinking about it.\n. This is now available: e.g.\n\n```\nhumane.error.timeout = 0\n```\n. Thanks for you pull.  I need to think about this for a little bit.  I don't mind your api but I think it could get out of hand because I imagine the people will want is to customize the other options based on type and the api could blow up more at that point.\n\n``` js\nhumane.timeout = { error: 2000, success: 500 };\nhumane.clickToClose = { error: true, success: false };\n...\n```\n\nOne idea I'm tossing around is:\n\n``` js\nhumane.error.timeout = 2000;\nhumane.error.clickToClose = true;\n...\n```\n\nThat way you visibly know what you've applied to 'error' e.g.  And standard `humane.timeout, etc..` would be the fallback.\n. Sure go for it, love the help!\n. this is merged in thanks!\n. From an API standpoint, that's extra work to call remove every time you wanted to force a new one.  I suppose forceNew could call remove internally so you keep the animations but is it important to use forceNew anymore with timeout configurations?\n. remove will just clear the one being shown, it won't clear any that have stocked up since.  i will include this pull request to expose it.  I don't think we want to go down the 'id' route.\n. right, I was thinking the same and wasn't able to duplicate so I just ignored it but I'll take a look again, thanks for the report.\n. fix in place for this now\n. I don't think this is a good idea and here is why.  Setting up options per notification type (rather than per notification) provides you the developer with a notification \"framework\" that keeps your messages to users consistent (logging frameworks do this).  You have done the leg work of defining three types of notifications which is good, my recommendation is to configure those three types using the four provided in humane.\n\ne.g.\n\n``` js\nhumane.log.timeout = 1000;\nhumane.info.timeout = 3000;\nhumane.error.timeout = 0;\n```\n\nNow you've classified your logging system for your site.  I could see making 'custom' types perhaps in the future, but do sites really need more than four classifications for notifications?  I don't know, I usually use one :)\n\nMarc\n. You listed three types above, I showed you a configuration for those three types, help me understand why does this not work for you?\n. I agree that is dirty nor will it really do what you want because it will override others in the queue of the same type when its time for them to shine.  The API isn't very good for your use case.  I'll think about it.  Right now I could see doing:\n\n``` js\nvar mycustomnotify = humane.create( { type: 'info', timeout: 1000, clickToClose: true } );\nmycustomnotify('hello world')\n```\n. I'll take a peak, is it in a fork?\n. ok @alanhogan, I put this in per the api outlined above, feel free to play around;\n. There isn't support for stacking or logging but there are hooks to add your own (see #7 for the discussion thread)\n. Ahh I see, you could try putting the css for one of the other themes under like `humane.humane-info` in `original.css` (and use humane.info to get that theme), if that makes sense.  A little bit of a hack as the API doesn't currently support what you are asking in a simple way.\n. correct, you could use type and put whatever you want in it as long as you make a humane-type class, but again your base css gets inherited so you may want need to pull some of that out and put it in the subclasses so both themes work\n. yeah class and type are sorta the same thing when creating, since it looks for a class called 'humane-{type}'\n. yeah should update the docs (I honestly wasn't sure how many would try what you are doing but its totally doable)... my goal is simplicity, I almost want to gut out the standard humane.info|error|log|success and just have humane and humane.create (where you can roll your own).  humane.create came after the others.\n. this is implemented per 3.0.0 release\n. correct, a zero timeout never times out so you have to force remove it with humane.remove()\n. i'm confused, setting timeout of 0 is supposed to never close yet you want it to after a certain amount of time?  would this be a better case for using `waitForMove` ?  I guess I'll need help understanding your use case.\n. ahh i see, remove really should take a callback, since what is happening is your next call isn't being queued up until after the animation has finished (and you've set the timeout to 5 seconds), so when it arrives in the queue it is no longer timeout=0 but timeout=5000 (or whatever you set it to).  I'm thinking about enhancements to this API that would make it easier for you do what you want... \n. for now to get what you want, you could either put a setTimeout on your timeout=5000 setting, or just have another function that does `humane.remove(); humane.timeout = 5000; humane('your message')` and remove `humane.timeout = 5000` in your other function\n. i added a callback to the remove function\n. ahh do you have a simple snippet that fails that I could see?\n. thanks, this has been fixed in master, also you can do this as well too:\n\n``` html\n<body>\n    <p>Automatically Show</p>\n       <script>        \n        humane.log(\"Welcome Back\"); // will fire and show when dom is ready\n      </script>\n </body>\n```\n. you are welcome!  cheers!\n. Please show me the generated HTML, and I will see if I can help you out.  Thanks\n. ahh ok, which browser are you experience this with?  The notifications popped up for me.\n. @hemanth looks like I forgot to recompile the minified JS, works for me now locally, you'll have to pull the latest code\n. ahh did not know that, please update the .styl files as well\n. thank you sir!\n. Good catch, mind submitting a pull?\n. Thanks!\n. appreciate the pull, however this is messy way to do this, setting the global this way is hacky and assumes this code will never be run in strict mode which would just give undefined - http://kangax.github.com/es5-compat-table/strict-mode/\n. maybe we could use window instead, does that break browserify as well?\n. new Function (...) really shouldn't be used as it is basically an eval, that creates a seperate context and additional overhead so i'm glad you changed it.  I will review your code later as I'm a little swamped at the moment.  Thanks!\n. ahh good point @avoidwork\n. I imagine there is common way people are using to setup commonjs module exports, let's research that and find out.\n. @tahu thank you, this landed in 3.0.4 (via cherry pick)\n. Are you aware of any similar API's for other browsers?  I run Linux and you can tap into libnotify but it is not built into the OS like in the new Mac OS (so in other words it probably wouldn't be used).  I can't speak for Windows.  Thanks for starting the conversation.\n. @wnadeau after thinking about this, it feels out of scope of this particular project, it could be a useful addon (currently I don't have a format for writing plugins but you could extend the Humane prototype with a new method - e.g. native) that users could use, or maybe it would be better as a stand alone module?\n. Thanks @JensRoland for the report, I don't use AMD but this sounds like a problem :)  Does AMD load after the DOM has been loaded?  My gut would be it would since its typically an AJAX call (unless they do some document.write trick)?  If that is the case maybe `true` is all we need for that particular case, at least for now.  Thoughts?\n\nYou are welcome to submit a patch, I may not get to this until next week.\n. fixed, closing\n. hopefully that's all it took :)  worked in my testing, let me know if you have an issues (not much of an AMD user myself)\n. Thanks for for the report @adlwalrus, this is by far the most requested feature for humane and I plan on taking a look on implementing it (and you are welcome to do so as well and we can discuss).  My gut is more to rely on CSS than JS for this behavior so we can animate using CSS transitions between the different 'levels' of stacking, which will allow for users to invent creative ways of stacking.\n. this unfortunately will not be in the humane.js future unless someone wants to take up the mantle, i don't have the time or interest to add it, maybe it will be rekindled in the future but i know there other great notification libraries that to provide that and it hasn't been a need yet for my workflow, sorry, closing for now\n. my favorite part of this pull is the `inhumane` variable name :)  i'm cool with adding this.  thanks!\n. thanks!\n. I haven't planned on either, as I'm unfamiliar with both, but am open to it if someone wants to submit them\n. woops!  hopefully that should work for you now\n. hmm we are catching the error and then waiting till dom load if used in `<head>`.  do you have a sample that fails?\n\nhttps://github.com/wavded/humane-js/blob/master/humane.js#L60\n. this should be fixed now in master\n. think I added this right :) haven't used bower before, hope that helps!\n. hmm interesting, are you use a legit IE8 or an emulator (IE8 mode)?\n. @LRotherfield I am having trouble duplicating, I setup your failing example here:\n\nhttp://wavded.github.com/humane-js/test/issue38.html\n\nI won't have access to a \"real\" IE8 machine until tomorrow (I'm using IE8 mode) but I can't seem to get that error to occur.  Maybe try wrapping a `try/catch` around the problem line for now and see if that helps.\n. ahh good find, I had never attempted to add gradients to ie 7 and 8, does wrapping that line with a `try/catch` in humane allow you still use your gradients or does it cause other issues?\n. @LRotherfield if it is beneficial for your case, it doesn't hurt to add it, at this point I'm not sure what I'd do with the catch except to \"catch\" the try :)  if you'd like to submit a pull I'll add it\n. yes, because they are reused, watch in your fav dev tool at http://wavded.github.com/humane-js/ and you'll see as you click on the log samples we are reusing the same element.  if you use `humane.create` it will make a new container and reuse that for any notifications that make use of that new container\n\nso in short, its for reuse.  I also believe its cheaper to do this than creating new elements all the time (that will vary on the browser, I would need to test that though)\n. ahh, this was deprecated and I'll remove it now, it was superseded by humane.remove()\n. No worries, thanks for the pull!\n. thx!\n. sorry, this got buried, but i however cannot duplicate in IE9 using the demo page provided below:\n\nhttp://wavded.github.io/humane-js/\n\nIf you have an html snippet that can reproduce the error I would happily take a gander.\n. closing this as its old, if still an issue, please let me know\n. this does seem handy, thanks for the pull, merged\n. Click to close works, it is just delayed if you have the the `timeoutAfterMove` param set, maybe we should rename it `timeoutOnClose` or something more generic.\n\nAs far this pull, we already have an optional callback that when provided is triggered when a notification is closed.\n. I can see your point, right now if have that option set it will double the timeout if you have both timeouts set which is also confusing.  I typically try to make options useful anywhere (even if there isn't any known use yet, makes the code simpler but also lets you shoot yourself in the foot).\n\nAs far as a callback example, there is one on the homepage (could be documented better):\n\n``` js\nhumane.log(\"Callback when finished\", function(){ document.body.style.backgroundColor=\"#a66000\" })\n```\n\nEssentially anytime you create a notification you can pass it a callback which triggers after the closing animation is done.\n. doing some spring cleaning, if anything is unresolved here, please let me know\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!  Merged.\n. ah crazy, swear that worked when we first put the readme up, thanks for the pull!\n. I'm not very familiar with RequireJS, could you give me a snippet on how you are including the library?\n. Hmm, it worked for me, I had to strip out some of your config, I committed the test here:\n\nhttps://github.com/wavded/humane-js/blob/master/test/issue49.html\n. Its just loading the parent dir in the repo which has humane.js in it... i pushed the test case up so you can inspect it:\n\nhttp://wavded.github.io/humane-js/test/issue49.html\n. On my machine I was using a `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` from the project root, I'm not sure what GitHub uses for their pages (guessing NGINX), but working there too.\n. closing this as its old, if it is still an issue, feel free to reopen\n. Do you have a simple failing case that you can share?  Like a jsbin or fiddle even?\n. I haven't.  Would have to think about how to cache an image so it isn't \"loading\" while the notification comes up.  It would also have to be supported across themes unless there were certain themes that supported images.\n\nYou could do it manually if you cached the images up front or created a theme with the image as a background.\n. Not going to add this.  Since raw HTML is injected into the notification bubble, this can be controlled on the users side to allow more customizability.  In addition, a user can develop a theme and apply background and icons with straight CSS.\n. @ajoslin sounds good to me, thx\n. closing because its an old issue\n. You can combine callbacks and options, unless I'm misunderstanding your question:\n\ne.g.\n\n``` js\nhumane.log('word up dawg', { timeout: 2000 }, function () { console.log('here after 2 secs') })\n```\n. I agree, stacking was at one time talked about but I haven't had the time to work on a prototype.  If you are interested in coming up with a model in a PR, I'm open to it!  We can take it from there.\n. this isn't in the lib, but you can monitor `humane.queue` yourself if you are noticing this as a problem, `humane.queue` is simply an array that behaves a queue, newest stuff is pushed to the end, oldest stuff at the beginning, haven't tried it but think it would work\n. awesome!  thanks for the contrib!\n. ahh yeah, no problem, i merged the two branches now so that should be out there on the demo page...\n. @meandavejustice bumped up the version in npm and bower, thanks for the heads up and kudos!\n. thanks!\n. interesting idea, that's an alternative to stacking that i haven't considered yet and would be much less invasive to the code base, hmm.. care to prototype something in a PR?\n. Yes, the messages are set using `innerHTML` so your HTML tags and such are kept in tack.  CSS will take affect provided its more specific that the styling for the humane.js theme you are using.  Do you have a sample CSS rule that isn't being applied?\n. a notable point.  we protect against that at the top of the file but not at the bottom, i will add that.\n. looks like uglify wasn't putting one at the beginning of the source but the end :) both are fixed, thanks!\n. Thanks for the explanation.  I barely use bower, is it just a matter of updating the version number in bower.json?  I have the package registered.\n. @macneib ahh ok, I usually tag releases so perhaps its working??  Just made a new push, could you verify?\n. @EloHg this removes the ability for someone to use the defaults if they want to.  Use `ENV.config` to fallback and it should be good to go.  Here is an example:\n\nhttps://github.com/wavded/humane-js/blob/master/humane.js#L81\n\nCan you mod this pull?\n. hehe, lgtm\n. hmm... but don't the notifications overlap each other?\n. I honestly cannot remember why I put that in there.  Does it behave appropriately if you remove it?\n. GTK, thx.\n. @rquast you can pass a container to use instead of the body\n\nhttps://github.com/wavded/humane-js/blob/master/humane.js#L57\n. PR?\n. Humane only renders a single `div` with a `humane` class.  So very minimal.  You can use one of the provided themes or you make your own styling for the `humane` class or addition classes and pass any markup you want to the constructor.\n. Yes, because of `pointer-events: none` you cannot use links within the HTML.  The design decision here is to keep the notification unobtrusive.  So links behind it could still be accessed.  That said, you could make a theme that removes that style rule and use links.\n. Although this project does not have a `test` script, I can assure you it has been \"well-tested\" manually (the old-fashioned way) within browsers (mobile and desktop) to ensure its behavior is as documented as well as a lot of airtime in production websites.  Including specific bug behavior tests in the `test` directory.  Given the popularity of the project and the lack of open bugs should support this.  The core has remained unchanged for quite some time now (Dec 8, 2014) and I have no plans on adding any new functionality, only addressing any new bugs that may arise on a case by case basis.. this was not addressed with fade transitions as the MSIE transition filter API requires content to change in addition to taking snapshots of the state of an element.  went to use the JS api for opacity filter instead, but lowered interval to be more performant - committed 07f785fc76d664552e188f02c5eaf7749b40a733\n. opted for forcing new messages in stead of stacking, to keep lib simple\n. thanks for your report, I cannot duplicate on Safari 5.0.5 on Windows but will try to grab a Mac and see if I can duplicate there.  I did notice an issue on iOS Safari where the notifications wouldn't popup.  Could you try something for me?\n\nFrom the CSS file remove any references to:\n\n```\nvisibility: hidden/visible\n```\n\nAnd see if it works?\n. yeah not ideal, more of a hack, i'll was able to dup on Safari on Mac (but not Windows, same ver), this seems like a Safari bug (namely, Safari doesn't animate the visibility property the same way Chrome, FF, etc do, it completely borks the whole animation), i'll play around with your workaround and see if someone else has reported this issue.\n. opened ticket - https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=64166\n. ticket confirmed, dup of this one -> https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=29984, patch in place, looks like it has to deal with when accelerated composition is on.\n. fixed in 6901b8b8022e49e337c50d2558ae4d1db0d8e4e9\n. hey sweet, i like it!\n. thanks, feel free to put up a description/creds on here if you want\nhttps://github.com/wavded/humane-js/wiki/Themes\n. ahh right because its transitioning from the last class, i'll take a peak\n. ok, it will restore the original class after completion now BUT there is always the possibility that the next notification (depending on the theme) may occur before the original class is restored.  e.g. for the 'jackedup' theme, if you select the success, wait, and then select the log example, it will be fine, but if you click one after another, there is still a little green that will show, which IMO is ok, maybe even desirable in some cases.  Thanks for the report.\n. There are a couple options already available to you in this case, you can shorten the timeout, or use the forceNew option to force the next notification.  Stacking is hard here because there is so much flexibility to what themes you can add but each theme would have to do its own type of stacking, libnotify is the obvious one as it could stack like `growl` but what about `bigbox` or `jackedup`.\n\nOther alternatives to stacking are logging which has also been suggested but IMO that would be better as an extension to this project and not in the core.  I'll keep this ticket open for discussion.\n. I would like to make this customizable.  One idea I had is to say allow three max for stacking but allow the dev to customize the animation for each separately and the JS will handle the class management, so for example:\n\n[ 1 ]\n[ 2 ]\n[ 3 ] \n\n1 was the first in, when its finished, 2 will animated to 1's class and 3 will animate to 2's class and if another notification was added it would animate to 3 if that makes sense.  Thoughts?\n. So I go back and forth on this.  The more I think about it, it seems not to fit the style of humane.js.  Notification systems definitely vary on this point for sure.  As a Linux user, I'm used to one notification at a time, linnotify does this, Ubuntu and Gnome Shell have the same concept.  Enso, for Windows, from which the whole Humane concept was from did one message at a time.  humanmsg, the jQuery plugin, from which this project is derived from, had the same concept.\n\nI've used humanmsg for a number of years, used Enso on windows before I switched to Linux, and now use humane.js for everything I do (lots of single page apps) and I've never had a problem where I needed to display more than one message at a time.  And if I did, it never seems to be a problem to wait a couple seconds.  We haven't had a single client complaint about it as well.\n\nMy workaround for this case was allowing forceNew but that was a really crappy hack IMO and I just removed it because we allow all notification levels to be customized now so you can have your errors longer and other messages shorter.  Closing this issue for now.\n. Another thought to is stacking for mobile would be problematic due to the screen size.  These themes are designed to work on mobile as well as desktop although still experimental.  I could expose the message queue to developers to implement your own stacking with what is cued up which could be rechecked by using the callback functionality that is already built.\n. I added custom events to allow for custom stacking and logging implementations (docs on homepage).  The internal queue is constantly being popped and pushed so I just exposed the events in order for someone to keep and manage their own queue depending on their needs.  Events fire when something is added, shown and hidden (removed).\n. ahh must be a bug with the js for the demo, i'll take look, thx for reporting\n. hmmm. actually i am unable to duplicate, do you have steps to reproduce from a clean refresh?\n. nice :), i'll add some text for that, you get so used to working with it you forget it may not be obvious!\n. ok there was an issue particularly with jackedup that wasn't supporting ie which has been addressed now, as far as the scripting error, i can duplicate if i'm running in IE7 mode, it has to do with the css loading on the demo page, if you run any of the themes independently they work.. i'll take a look at later when i've got some more time, thx\n. sheesh you are right, looks horrible in chrome latest, wonder what switched, will take a look soon\n. this is fixed per 3.0.0 release\n. Thanks for the report, I have seen this on iOS for iPhone as well, there is a known issue particularly with Safari running on Mac (PC is fine), that looks like a fix has been rolled out this past month, I haven't tested it yet however.\n\nhttps://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=29984\n\nThere may be a way to workaround the theme so that it doesn't happen.  I however do not own an iPad, you are welcome to play with the theme animation for a solution.  I think a workaround may be achieved by playing with the CSS.  I'll see if I can dig into this as well.\n. Wow, I've tried many of the suggestion in the link below on my iPhone, and can't get that flicker to stop, on the iPhone it flashes black the first animation, and then its fine.  It seem like you have a different experience that it always flickers which is not what I see on the iPhone:  Are you running iOS 5?\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/4651769/ipad-css3-animation-flickers-after-keyboard-use\n. I ran a mobile version of iOS 5, and the flicker is gone for me.  My guess is the bug got fixed.\n. @samyakbhuta could you check your iOS 4 to see if the flicker is gone?  I updated the code so it without glitch on iOS5 and it may have had a positive affect, i just don't have a device to test it.  Thx.\n. ahh, ok, never thought of this use case, we could allow 0 to never 'finish' but then we would need to have some way to finish it.  have you tried setting it to a really high number?\n. just an fyi @kaihendry I added ability to set the timeout to 0 which completely disables the timeout (it stays up unless forever unless you use other options like `clickToClose` or `forceNew`\n. Awesome work and great idea, I'll take a peak and run through some tests and let you know.\n. @OiNutter, got a chance to play with it and test it, one quirk I noticed, if I have three notifications queued up and the last one has the callback, it will actually fire after the first animation is finished instead of the last.  Otherwise, it looks good, do you mind fixing up that issue and appending your pull request?\n. My gut would be after each notification.  I think the API reads better, because I'm passing a callback and a message and expect that callback to fire when the message has completed.  In your case, my gut is to do a counter if you know you have other callbacks pending or do a callback chain.\n. Thanks I'll run it through some tests!\n. Awesome, seem to pass great.  I wasn't able to merge so I just pulled in the changes and made a commit.  Added you at a contributer to the docs, thanks much!\n. Agreed, its just running automated tests across browsers that I haven't found a good way to do that.  Maybe jasmine, but visually you have to look at all the browsers to make sure the themes look correct and show up how you want so that part isn't really script-able but yeah...\n. there isn't away to do that currently, right now you can either have the notifications clear after the timeout and additionally (after timeout + mouse movement), but interesting idea... i like it\n. I added a click to close option, viewable on the demo page.\n. This may be akin to what is happening over in issue #9 (also webkit based) \n. There is a known webkit issue that is referenced in #9, my gut is it got fixed in the updated OS.  I was able to work around some of it using z-index instead of visibility.  It is related to the stylesheet and not the JS.  All the JS does it apply the class and throw it back the the browser to animate to that class and that where the flickering comes in.  I have been trying hacks to get it to work but haven't been successful, if you come across one that works well, please let me know!\n. I just tested iOS 5 and the flicker there is gone as well.\n. Confirmed new Android 4 has the flicker gone, noticed that the jqmobile peeps have had better success there as well.  I may just fallback to JS animation for older OS.\n. updated code to work without any glitches on iOS v5 and Android 4, it may have had a positive affect on iOS <5 or Android <4 but currently don't have any devices to test.\n. Apparently, earlier versions of mobile webkit did not like it when you animated the zIndex property, which we don't really need to animate but to make it easier to get up and running all themes just by using `transition: all` instead of specifying all the components.  It wasn't obvious that this was causing the issue until iOS5 where you saw the element 'behind' other elements at the start of the animation, and in front after... so anyway yippee!\n. hey awesome!  glad to hear!\n. Hmm that looks correct to me.  Are you able to duplicate on the demo site?  I just did a test turned the option on and then clicked a sample and clicked a notification and it closed, do you have a sample page that duplicates the issue?  And which browser you tested?\n. it will remove after the timeout, the clickToClose was just an additional option for a user to remove a popup if they don't want to wait the timeout.  in your case you'd have to set the timeout to a large number... but maybe when i think about it we could modify timeout behavior so if you do:\n\n```\nhumane.timeout = 0\n```\n\nIt will do the same, since that is pretty useless atm.\n. I added ability to disable timeout by setting it to 0\n. Good idea, thinking about it.\n. This is now available: e.g.\n\n```\nhumane.error.timeout = 0\n```\n. Thanks for you pull.  I need to think about this for a little bit.  I don't mind your api but I think it could get out of hand because I imagine the people will want is to customize the other options based on type and the api could blow up more at that point.\n\n``` js\nhumane.timeout = { error: 2000, success: 500 };\nhumane.clickToClose = { error: true, success: false };\n...\n```\n\nOne idea I'm tossing around is:\n\n``` js\nhumane.error.timeout = 2000;\nhumane.error.clickToClose = true;\n...\n```\n\nThat way you visibly know what you've applied to 'error' e.g.  And standard `humane.timeout, etc..` would be the fallback.\n. Sure go for it, love the help!\n. this is merged in thanks!\n. From an API standpoint, that's extra work to call remove every time you wanted to force a new one.  I suppose forceNew could call remove internally so you keep the animations but is it important to use forceNew anymore with timeout configurations?\n. remove will just clear the one being shown, it won't clear any that have stocked up since.  i will include this pull request to expose it.  I don't think we want to go down the 'id' route.\n. right, I was thinking the same and wasn't able to duplicate so I just ignored it but I'll take a look again, thanks for the report.\n. fix in place for this now\n. I don't think this is a good idea and here is why.  Setting up options per notification type (rather than per notification) provides you the developer with a notification \"framework\" that keeps your messages to users consistent (logging frameworks do this).  You have done the leg work of defining three types of notifications which is good, my recommendation is to configure those three types using the four provided in humane.\n\ne.g.\n\n``` js\nhumane.log.timeout = 1000;\nhumane.info.timeout = 3000;\nhumane.error.timeout = 0;\n```\n\nNow you've classified your logging system for your site.  I could see making 'custom' types perhaps in the future, but do sites really need more than four classifications for notifications?  I don't know, I usually use one :)\n\nMarc\n. You listed three types above, I showed you a configuration for those three types, help me understand why does this not work for you?\n. I agree that is dirty nor will it really do what you want because it will override others in the queue of the same type when its time for them to shine.  The API isn't very good for your use case.  I'll think about it.  Right now I could see doing:\n\n``` js\nvar mycustomnotify = humane.create( { type: 'info', timeout: 1000, clickToClose: true } );\nmycustomnotify('hello world')\n```\n. I'll take a peak, is it in a fork?\n. ok @alanhogan, I put this in per the api outlined above, feel free to play around;\n. There isn't support for stacking or logging but there are hooks to add your own (see #7 for the discussion thread)\n. Ahh I see, you could try putting the css for one of the other themes under like `humane.humane-info` in `original.css` (and use humane.info to get that theme), if that makes sense.  A little bit of a hack as the API doesn't currently support what you are asking in a simple way.\n. correct, you could use type and put whatever you want in it as long as you make a humane-type class, but again your base css gets inherited so you may want need to pull some of that out and put it in the subclasses so both themes work\n. yeah class and type are sorta the same thing when creating, since it looks for a class called 'humane-{type}'\n. yeah should update the docs (I honestly wasn't sure how many would try what you are doing but its totally doable)... my goal is simplicity, I almost want to gut out the standard humane.info|error|log|success and just have humane and humane.create (where you can roll your own).  humane.create came after the others.\n. this is implemented per 3.0.0 release\n. correct, a zero timeout never times out so you have to force remove it with humane.remove()\n. i'm confused, setting timeout of 0 is supposed to never close yet you want it to after a certain amount of time?  would this be a better case for using `waitForMove` ?  I guess I'll need help understanding your use case.\n. ahh i see, remove really should take a callback, since what is happening is your next call isn't being queued up until after the animation has finished (and you've set the timeout to 5 seconds), so when it arrives in the queue it is no longer timeout=0 but timeout=5000 (or whatever you set it to).  I'm thinking about enhancements to this API that would make it easier for you do what you want... \n. for now to get what you want, you could either put a setTimeout on your timeout=5000 setting, or just have another function that does `humane.remove(); humane.timeout = 5000; humane('your message')` and remove `humane.timeout = 5000` in your other function\n. i added a callback to the remove function\n. ahh do you have a simple snippet that fails that I could see?\n. thanks, this has been fixed in master, also you can do this as well too:\n\n``` html\n<body>\n    <p>Automatically Show</p>\n       <script>        \n        humane.log(\"Welcome Back\"); // will fire and show when dom is ready\n      </script>\n </body>\n```\n. you are welcome!  cheers!\n. Please show me the generated HTML, and I will see if I can help you out.  Thanks\n. ahh ok, which browser are you experience this with?  The notifications popped up for me.\n. @hemanth looks like I forgot to recompile the minified JS, works for me now locally, you'll have to pull the latest code\n. ahh did not know that, please update the .styl files as well\n. thank you sir!\n. Good catch, mind submitting a pull?\n. Thanks!\n. appreciate the pull, however this is messy way to do this, setting the global this way is hacky and assumes this code will never be run in strict mode which would just give undefined - http://kangax.github.com/es5-compat-table/strict-mode/\n. maybe we could use window instead, does that break browserify as well?\n. new Function (...) really shouldn't be used as it is basically an eval, that creates a seperate context and additional overhead so i'm glad you changed it.  I will review your code later as I'm a little swamped at the moment.  Thanks!\n. ahh good point @avoidwork\n. I imagine there is common way people are using to setup commonjs module exports, let's research that and find out.\n. @tahu thank you, this landed in 3.0.4 (via cherry pick)\n. Are you aware of any similar API's for other browsers?  I run Linux and you can tap into libnotify but it is not built into the OS like in the new Mac OS (so in other words it probably wouldn't be used).  I can't speak for Windows.  Thanks for starting the conversation.\n. @wnadeau after thinking about this, it feels out of scope of this particular project, it could be a useful addon (currently I don't have a format for writing plugins but you could extend the Humane prototype with a new method - e.g. native) that users could use, or maybe it would be better as a stand alone module?\n. Thanks @JensRoland for the report, I don't use AMD but this sounds like a problem :)  Does AMD load after the DOM has been loaded?  My gut would be it would since its typically an AJAX call (unless they do some document.write trick)?  If that is the case maybe `true` is all we need for that particular case, at least for now.  Thoughts?\n\nYou are welcome to submit a patch, I may not get to this until next week.\n. fixed, closing\n. hopefully that's all it took :)  worked in my testing, let me know if you have an issues (not much of an AMD user myself)\n. Thanks for for the report @adlwalrus, this is by far the most requested feature for humane and I plan on taking a look on implementing it (and you are welcome to do so as well and we can discuss).  My gut is more to rely on CSS than JS for this behavior so we can animate using CSS transitions between the different 'levels' of stacking, which will allow for users to invent creative ways of stacking.\n. this unfortunately will not be in the humane.js future unless someone wants to take up the mantle, i don't have the time or interest to add it, maybe it will be rekindled in the future but i know there other great notification libraries that to provide that and it hasn't been a need yet for my workflow, sorry, closing for now\n. my favorite part of this pull is the `inhumane` variable name :)  i'm cool with adding this.  thanks!\n. thanks!\n. I haven't planned on either, as I'm unfamiliar with both, but am open to it if someone wants to submit them\n. woops!  hopefully that should work for you now\n. hmm we are catching the error and then waiting till dom load if used in `<head>`.  do you have a sample that fails?\n\nhttps://github.com/wavded/humane-js/blob/master/humane.js#L60\n. this should be fixed now in master\n. think I added this right :) haven't used bower before, hope that helps!\n. hmm interesting, are you use a legit IE8 or an emulator (IE8 mode)?\n. @LRotherfield I am having trouble duplicating, I setup your failing example here:\n\nhttp://wavded.github.com/humane-js/test/issue38.html\n\nI won't have access to a \"real\" IE8 machine until tomorrow (I'm using IE8 mode) but I can't seem to get that error to occur.  Maybe try wrapping a `try/catch` around the problem line for now and see if that helps.\n. ahh good find, I had never attempted to add gradients to ie 7 and 8, does wrapping that line with a `try/catch` in humane allow you still use your gradients or does it cause other issues?\n. @LRotherfield if it is beneficial for your case, it doesn't hurt to add it, at this point I'm not sure what I'd do with the catch except to \"catch\" the try :)  if you'd like to submit a pull I'll add it\n. yes, because they are reused, watch in your fav dev tool at http://wavded.github.com/humane-js/ and you'll see as you click on the log samples we are reusing the same element.  if you use `humane.create` it will make a new container and reuse that for any notifications that make use of that new container\n\nso in short, its for reuse.  I also believe its cheaper to do this than creating new elements all the time (that will vary on the browser, I would need to test that though)\n. ahh, this was deprecated and I'll remove it now, it was superseded by humane.remove()\n. No worries, thanks for the pull!\n. thx!\n. sorry, this got buried, but i however cannot duplicate in IE9 using the demo page provided below:\n\nhttp://wavded.github.io/humane-js/\n\nIf you have an html snippet that can reproduce the error I would happily take a gander.\n. closing this as its old, if still an issue, please let me know\n. this does seem handy, thanks for the pull, merged\n. Click to close works, it is just delayed if you have the the `timeoutAfterMove` param set, maybe we should rename it `timeoutOnClose` or something more generic.\n\nAs far this pull, we already have an optional callback that when provided is triggered when a notification is closed.\n. I can see your point, right now if have that option set it will double the timeout if you have both timeouts set which is also confusing.  I typically try to make options useful anywhere (even if there isn't any known use yet, makes the code simpler but also lets you shoot yourself in the foot).\n\nAs far as a callback example, there is one on the homepage (could be documented better):\n\n``` js\nhumane.log(\"Callback when finished\", function(){ document.body.style.backgroundColor=\"#a66000\" })\n```\n\nEssentially anytime you create a notification you can pass it a callback which triggers after the closing animation is done.\n. doing some spring cleaning, if anything is unresolved here, please let me know\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!  Merged.\n. ah crazy, swear that worked when we first put the readme up, thanks for the pull!\n. I'm not very familiar with RequireJS, could you give me a snippet on how you are including the library?\n. Hmm, it worked for me, I had to strip out some of your config, I committed the test here:\n\nhttps://github.com/wavded/humane-js/blob/master/test/issue49.html\n. Its just loading the parent dir in the repo which has humane.js in it... i pushed the test case up so you can inspect it:\n\nhttp://wavded.github.io/humane-js/test/issue49.html\n. On my machine I was using a `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` from the project root, I'm not sure what GitHub uses for their pages (guessing NGINX), but working there too.\n. closing this as its old, if it is still an issue, feel free to reopen\n. Do you have a simple failing case that you can share?  Like a jsbin or fiddle even?\n. I haven't.  Would have to think about how to cache an image so it isn't \"loading\" while the notification comes up.  It would also have to be supported across themes unless there were certain themes that supported images.\n\nYou could do it manually if you cached the images up front or created a theme with the image as a background.\n. Not going to add this.  Since raw HTML is injected into the notification bubble, this can be controlled on the users side to allow more customizability.  In addition, a user can develop a theme and apply background and icons with straight CSS.\n. @ajoslin sounds good to me, thx\n. closing because its an old issue\n. You can combine callbacks and options, unless I'm misunderstanding your question:\n\ne.g.\n\n``` js\nhumane.log('word up dawg', { timeout: 2000 }, function () { console.log('here after 2 secs') })\n```\n. I agree, stacking was at one time talked about but I haven't had the time to work on a prototype.  If you are interested in coming up with a model in a PR, I'm open to it!  We can take it from there.\n. this isn't in the lib, but you can monitor `humane.queue` yourself if you are noticing this as a problem, `humane.queue` is simply an array that behaves a queue, newest stuff is pushed to the end, oldest stuff at the beginning, haven't tried it but think it would work\n. awesome!  thanks for the contrib!\n. ahh yeah, no problem, i merged the two branches now so that should be out there on the demo page...\n. @meandavejustice bumped up the version in npm and bower, thanks for the heads up and kudos!\n. thanks!\n. interesting idea, that's an alternative to stacking that i haven't considered yet and would be much less invasive to the code base, hmm.. care to prototype something in a PR?\n. Yes, the messages are set using `innerHTML` so your HTML tags and such are kept in tack.  CSS will take affect provided its more specific that the styling for the humane.js theme you are using.  Do you have a sample CSS rule that isn't being applied?\n. a notable point.  we protect against that at the top of the file but not at the bottom, i will add that.\n. looks like uglify wasn't putting one at the beginning of the source but the end :) both are fixed, thanks!\n. Thanks for the explanation.  I barely use bower, is it just a matter of updating the version number in bower.json?  I have the package registered.\n. @macneib ahh ok, I usually tag releases so perhaps its working??  Just made a new push, could you verify?\n. @EloHg this removes the ability for someone to use the defaults if they want to.  Use `ENV.config` to fallback and it should be good to go.  Here is an example:\n\nhttps://github.com/wavded/humane-js/blob/master/humane.js#L81\n\nCan you mod this pull?\n. hehe, lgtm\n. hmm... but don't the notifications overlap each other?\n. I honestly cannot remember why I put that in there.  Does it behave appropriately if you remove it?\n. GTK, thx.\n. @rquast you can pass a container to use instead of the body\n\nhttps://github.com/wavded/humane-js/blob/master/humane.js#L57\n. PR?\n. Humane only renders a single `div` with a `humane` class.  So very minimal.  You can use one of the provided themes or you make your own styling for the `humane` class or addition classes and pass any markup you want to the constructor.\n. Yes, because of `pointer-events: none` you cannot use links within the HTML.  The design decision here is to keep the notification unobtrusive.  So links behind it could still be accessed.  That said, you could make a theme that removes that style rule and use links.\n. Although this project does not have a `test` script, I can assure you it has been \"well-tested\" manually (the old-fashioned way) within browsers (mobile and desktop) to ensure its behavior is as documented as well as a lot of airtime in production websites.  Including specific bug behavior tests in the `test` directory.  Given the popularity of the project and the lack of open bugs should support this.  The core has remained unchanged for quite some time now (Dec 8, 2014) and I have no plans on adding any new functionality, only addressing any new bugs that may arise on a case by case basis.. ",

It\u2019s not a fork and I likely won\u2019t create a public fork, but I made this gist if you\u2019re interested.\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/1735493\n\nAgain, I haven\u2019t had the opportunity to really test the changes yet or anything.\n. I would like to see `remove(id)` where `id` refers to the ID (which I know isn\u2019t currently really a thing) of a notification. This would remove that notification if and only if it is in the queue or currently shown.\n\nUse case:\n- Show \u201cSending\u2026\u201d as I send a message via ajax, possibly lingering quite a few seconds as we wait for email stuff to happen in another part of the world\u2026\n- Immediately clear that \u201cSending\u2026\u201d message (and only that notification, not any others that may have been generated in the mean time!) when the AJAX call completes (whether successfully or not).\n. Another use case of `remove(id)`:\n- \u201cCannot Reach Server\u201d/\u201cOffline\u201d displays until the app reconnects\n. I must disagree.\n\nThe current situation does not quite satisfy my motivating examples and current needs. \n\nAlso, a logging system is only superficially similar to a notification system. A notification framework forms part of the UI and as such must be as flexible and extensible as is required to meet user experience requirements. (Usually no such analog exists for app logging.) Furthermore, app logging is very \"historical\", decoupled, searchable, etc.; notifications are none of these and are only useful in the present.   \n\nOn Jan 25, 2012, at 7:47 PM, Marc Harterreply@reply.github.com wrote:\n\n> I don't think this is a good idea and here is why.  Setting up options per notification type (rather than per notification) provides you the developer with a notification \"framework\" that keeps your messages to users consistent (logging frameworks do this).

The first bullet point was an info message (type \"info\") that I would want to show for shorter than most other \"type info\" messages.\n\nThe second two bullets were both \"error\" type messages.\n. Consider the alternative, currently, given my needs:\n\nSetting options for the type about to be used, immediately before using it \u2013\u00a0every time! It feels (and is!) very, very dirty.\n.

I still think there might be some value to adding additional custom event and class options so you could extend 'error' type in to 'fatal' and still get an onerror event along with the onfatal, but correct me if I'm wrong, it seems like just the custom type extension would work with minimal updates... what do you think?\n. Awesome, it can still serve the function of extending the given themes so that you can have yellow, orange, red, or black for progressive levels of error/notification by just adding a few more style rules and creating the custom notifiers.\n\nThe documentation makes the humane.create() seem like it can only be used for currying a custom function from existing static types, when in reality you can get pretty creative depending on what you're trying to do.  I think I could easily go back to using the original style, add a single .humane-autosave rule which changes the top, font-size, min-height and width to be less obtrusive and utilize that custom notifier for that specific case.\n\nYou should think about updating the Custom Notifier section of the docs to let people know it's more flexible than they may realize.

I'm thinking of using it as a model for a humane-like tooltip plugin for handling notifications which are specific to an element or location on the page.\n. Yeah, that's a good idea, the docs would be way simpler and much more accurate if you focused on the humane.create function as the core from which you can roll any number of notifications and make the built-in notifications a footnote.\n\nThough if you removed them completely the themes would be kind of bland.
