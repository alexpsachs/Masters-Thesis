    "hassankhan": "Me neither, that's kind of why this issue's never been closed. Perhaps one day someone smarter than us will come up with a solution :smile: \n. Not sure if its completely applicable, but I think I might add some more CSS:\n\n``` css\n.emoji {\n  ...\n  text-rendering: auto; // optimizelegibility throws things off #1094\n  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;\n  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;\n  transform: translate(0, 0); // ensures no half-pixel rendering in firefox\n}\n\n```\n. The fix was actually simpler than I thought, changed `@emoji-size` to 1.5em as a constant, seems to fit well within the text I tested.\n. Fixed the issue for Chrome and Safari at least. Internet Explorer fails on the `appendChild()` function on line 680.\n. Fixed by not giving a shit. Sayonara, IE9!\n. Added sane defaults, fixed in [commit 9c2361f](https://github.com/hassankhan/emojify.js/commit/9c2361fc264a9efc40984cfdc0c1ae6abc915578)\n. Its better this way.\n. Thank you for using it and making this pull request, you've made my day!\n. Yep done that :)\n. Yeah, thought I'd leave it out, in case someone wanted to strip unnecessary ones out\n. Well I thought if you didn't need specific sets, then you could just remove the LESS for them? Do you know how to dynamically load in stylesheets as needed? This should be definitely be an enhancement.\n. Just thought of a crude way, should work though. Using jQuery, add in a new `<link>` tag pointing to the stylesheet. Only thing is, you'd probably still need a way of knowing where each emoji icon is. \n. Yeah the point of emojify.js was explicitly NOT have to have separate images, I suppose one could separate the emojis into stylesheets by category, but that's probably the closest this can get to a better solution.\n. Sorry for the late reply, thank you very much for your detailed response. \n\nSince its more than overdue for a refactor, I will be taking your suggestions into account. Thank you.\n. Cool, thanks. but that's only for one emoji if I'm not mistaken (correct me if I'm wrong). Would rather have a solution that works for all, could probably throw in an exclude words array and join that with the emoji code.\n. Errr yeah you can, its not perfect but just add `class='no-emojify'` to your `<pre>` tags.\n. Hmmmm ... well you can mix normal HTML and Markdown, which IS valid Markdown. If you don't want to do that, then you could probably specify (by `id`) which elements you want to emojify:\n\n```\nemojify.setConfig({\n    only_crawl_id: 'messages_container'  #only do this when you want to restrict where emojify.js applies.\n});\n```\n\nOther than that though, I'm not sure what else you could do. I don't have time right now, maybe I could look into updating it over the weekend (and possibly turning into a jQuery plugin). \n. Go to `less\\emojify.less` and comment out whichever emojis you don't want. Hope that helps?\n. AMD as in Javascript? Any specific benefit it would bring?\n. Errrr shouldn't be that way, no. I'll have to double check it.\n. A JSfiddle example would've been more helpful, still haven't had time to look at it.\n. http://jsfiddle.net/hassankhan/99JRb/\n. I'm not sure where exactly its going wrong, and its been so long since I've looked at it that its not quite clear to me any more.\n\nSince its pretty crap, might throw in the towel and do a rewrite :)\n. Hi there, you need to compile the LESS to CSS yourself. You can do it online, or by downloading and using a LESS compiler.\n. Oh sorry, overlooked that, I'll fix the readme. Thanks :smile:\n. Sweet, looks good to me, does it work correctly?\n. Cheers, thanks :smiley: \n. Ah that's alright, I was kind of in the middle of some work on it myself so I'll sort it out myself. Thanks anyway.\n. Yeah sounds awesome! Please do :+1: \n. I think this is probably unnecessary thanks to the awesome work by [GitterHQ](https://github.com/gitterHQ) :smile:\n. Ah, sorry dude, I just saw this. :disappointed: \n. I thought it'd be better to keep it there, any specific reason you think it should be removed?\n. Oh. My. God.\n\nI think I'm in love with you guys, thank you so so so much! Definitely accepting the PR, didn't realise that this would ever be that useful to anyone so I'm quite shocked (in a good way)\n. Yeah I'll be sure to, just browsed through the code and it's a pleasure to read. I was wondering if you'd grabbed the latest version of the [emoji-cheat-sheet repo](https://github.com/arvida/emoji-cheat-sheet.com) when you rewrote it?\n. Haha yeah, that's been something that I've been meaning to do for ages to. To be honest with you, when I first wrote it, I did it manually :persevere: but a build script would be awesome.\n. Also, would you mind terribly if I added \"Used by Gitter\" in the readme file?\n. @jimmybrancaccio Hopefully will update soon with latest source from [emoji-cheat-sheet](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/)\n\n@mydigitalself I most certainly will :smile: \n. Hiya, thanks for the awesome PR! Looks good to me, but I would personally prefer the tests to be in Javascript, if possible :smile: \n\nThanks a lot for taking the time to write the tests though\n. Haha thanks for the heads up, ummm, to be completely honest with you, I do prefer the Javascript syntax :blush: if only for the fact it keeps the project somewhat uniform\n. That's a good point, actually, I'm not sure. I think it _should_, but I agree with you about feeling dirty about it.\n\nActually, yes, I think unescaping and then matching them would probably be the best bet, unless you have another better-er idea :smile: \n. Yep, if anything I believe that was how it used to work (or at least was how it was intended to work)\n\nAlso, a massive thank-you for doing all of this.\n. Also including @suprememoocow in the conversation, since Gitter's using it on their site, might be worth making sure it doesn't break anything for them, too.\n. Mate, every time you comment I learn something, never heard of Testling before but it looks awesome. I think @qq99 is happy with Javascript tests as well, so if everything's good I'll go ahead and merge (personally haven't checked the tests yet, so let me know)\n. Closed in favour of #27 \n. Haha thanks for checking, but are all the emojis on the website working for emojify.js? I'm pretty sure (but don't quote me on this) that they've added a fair few new ones :smile: \n. Yep, forgot to close it. By way of interest, would you like to be added as a collaborator to the repo?\n. I think I might make this at the least, some sort of an option. While I personally appreciate the advantages that spriting brings, I think that's best left to the actual web developers themselves. \n\nSome people might only want a handful of emojis, and would rather not download the whole sprite. I remember a few issues people opened saying they didn't want to download a CSS file full of data-URI images. I thought I'd made it pretty easy with the LESS file, but some didn't agree.\n\nWhat **can** be done, however, is using the emoji name as a class name. You would create your spritesheet, and it would automatically add `emoji <emoji name>` to the class attribute of the tag. It's a fairly simple change, maybe @suprememoocow could share his views?\n. I'm personally not sure, I'd rather leave it up to the user. We provide all the images, it should be up to the end user to turn them into sprites if they so wish.\n\nThat said, if we DO add this, I'd prefer it to be a Grunt task. Thanks all :+1: \n. That sounds about right, I think there are some other things we might want to do, for example, we might want to prefix the classes with something, probably `emoji` i.e. `emoji-wink`, `emoji-smile` etc. Then add an option as you mentioned to tell emojify.js to use a stylesheet.\n\nLook forward to seeing your PR :+1:  \n. Closed in #98\n. Sweet, thanks for catching this one :smile: \n. Fucking aces, man, nice work! :kissing_heart: \n. If it's alright with you @qq99 then shall I merge this PR and close your one?\n. Thanks again guys, really appreciate the effort you've put into this :smile: Can't seem to get Testling CI working, but that's probably due to my own incompetence.\n. Good catch, nice job with the tests too. I've added you as a collaborator on the repo, so if you push directly to the repo, it should work, unless you'd rather do a PR?\n. Awesome, all done :+1: \n. I'll leave this open until the documentation is accurate.\n. Fixed the README, closing the issue now.\n. Hiya, thanks for the PR :smile: could you add a test case or two as well?\n. I've tried writing tests, and it failed for me.\n. We have the `ignore_emoticons` option, anyway\n. Thanks @dunckr, I believe it used to do this before the recent rewrite, but I may be mistaken. In any case, thanks for the PR!\n. Yep, looks brilliant to me. Thanks!\n. Can you provide some more context? What were you trying to do?\n. Ah, nice catch. The old version used to have the same bug as well. Thanks!\n. That's weird, I'll try and have a look later this week.\n. Ahhh perfect, thanks so much.\n\nAs a sidenote, does this resolve #36?\n. Thank you for your amazing work again, @qq99!!\n. Sorry, I haven't had time to look into the PR yet, hopefully one of the other contributors might be able to help.\n\nI'm not quite sure I understand what the new option does, or if it's named correctly, perhaps? \nIf it is set to true (default), then `hello:(` would render an emoji, otherwise not? If that's the case, then maybe instead of adding an option, we could do some sort of check to see if it's the end of the text and render based on that.\n. I don't know if this is the case, but do you run the Markdown parser first and then emojify.js? If all the markdown is converted to HTML, then it wouldn't happen at all surely?\n. Perhaps it would be best to not emojify the text if you're trying to display raw Markdown? You could add an `id` attribute to the diff view and have Emojify.js exclude it? This is all armchair conjecture, I haven't seen your project at all.\n\nThanks\n. Hi @tessi, I think it might be better to limit where Emojify works instead. Currently it works on everything unless you restrict it to an `id`, perhaps we can add an ID for exclusion as well. I'll close this issue, and maybe we could try another PR adding exclusion support?\n. Yep, I will do shortly, just made an account on npmjs.org\n. Sorry, been busy flying between countries, now I'm back at work, will have to look at it on the weekend :smile: \n. All done: https://www.npmjs.org/package/emojify.js\n. Sorry it took so long, I think I might've found a bug in npmjs.org.\n. Other than what I mentioned above, it looks sound to me. Obviously as you said, you'll add the tests, so I'm happy :+1: \n. +1 from me, maybe @qq99 and @suprememoocow could share their thoughts, too?\n. Awesome, I'm happy to wait for a second set of eyes to look through the PR.\n. +1 from me I think, looks pretty complete to me.\n.

I'll run the `npm owner` command when I get home later tonight, hopefully :smile: Might also be worth adding `npm publish` to the `gulp release` command\n. Hiya, sorry it's been mental at work launching [a few campaigns](http://playstation20.eu.playstation.com), will probably do the release over the Xmas break\n. I'd prefer a 0.10 release first, before I get some time to redo the options.\n. v1.0 is finally out, thanks everyone!\n. Hi there, not quite sure what this PR is trying to achieve, why do you need those specific emoji and not the rest?\n. I think I understand what you're talking about, however I don't think hardcoding specific emoji keywords is the solution. Perhaps a more programmatic way of defining the emoji you want to convert would be better.\n. Hmm, ok, I misunderstood what the `named` key did. @qq99 @suprememoocow any thoughts?\n. Thanks for the PR!\n. Pretty sure I added Emojify.js to the NPM registry a while ago, if I merge this PR, will it update automatically?\n. Ok, I'll double-check when I'm at home :+1: \n. Any issues I might not have seen @qq99 @suprememoocow ?\n. @leoasis Do you think you could remove the whitespace and commit again? Happy to merge after that.\n. Thanks for the PR! Also, while we're here, correct me if I'm wrong, but if I run `npm publish` on the folder, shouldn't it update by itself? I seem to be getting errors :frowning: \n. Haha thanks, I figured that out a second ago and fixed it. It's all good now :+1: \n. Do they have a repo or anything anywhere? Can't seem to find one...\n. Ahh this is pretty awesome news! I'm sure we could tweak the `update.sh` script to be able to modify where it updates from, and Emoji One provide PNGs anyway.\n. Not as easy as I initially thought, [the PNG's](https://github.com/Ranks/emojione/tree/master/assets/png) are named by their unicode points BUT on the plus side, they also have SVG formats too!\n\nEDIT: Found [`emoji.json`](https://github.com/Ranks/emojione/blob/master/emoji.json) which lists them all along with their unicode codepoint\n. I think it'd be great if we turned this into a `gulp` task.\n. Doubtful, Internet Explorer is this library's weak point.\n. I think we should ask @suprememoocow, he spent a lot of time rewriting it to make it performant, so I'd hate to lay waste to his work.\n. Oooh, that'd actually be quite cool. \n. @JustBlackBird Well, we already have a Testling banner that shows support across different browsers. Is that what you meant?\n\nIn general, I'm :+1: on this, if it isn't too much work.\n. Hmm ok, but how would we automate testing it if it actually works using the shim i.e. using Testling? \n. I'll be honest with you, I'm not sure where to start with respect to making tests work like that. Do you think it would be possible to make a quick proof-of-concept PR just so I can see how it would work? Once we know for sure that it works with the shims, then I'll update the documentation, too, thanks :smile: \n. Ah bollocks to it, if someone wants to run it on IE8, they can do it at their own risk. I'll add a disclaimer.\n. Sorry, been really busy at work and not had any time over the weekend. Apparently there's a merge conflict, so I'll resolve that tomorrow hopefully and merge the PR. Thanks!!\n. There were some line ending issues, apparently I hadn't set `core.autocrlf=true` on my laptop :confused: Anyway all done now, thanks!\n. Could you add a failing test please? \n. Will follow up [here](https://github.com/hassankhan/emojify.js/pull/62)\n. I believe they are listed on the [GitHub pages](http://hassankhan.github.io/emojify.js/). Thanks for pointing this out!\n. How so? I don't understand :confused: \n\nEDIT: Ahhh, as it stands, some don't work, and some don't work because they're lowercase/uppercase.\n. Yes, that was always the plan, I just got lazy and haven't updated the GH Pages in a while\n. I've updated [README.md](https://github.com/hassankhan/emojify.js/blob/develop/README.md). Is it better now?\n. This little snippet?:\n\n``` css\n.emoji {\n    width: 1.5em;\n    height: 1.5em;\n    display: inline-block;\n    margin-bottom: -0.25em;\n}\n```\n. I think it might be better to add that as a LESS file, like I used to originally. I'm going to make a separate issue for it and close this one now. Thanks!\n. Well, not exactly. It's just sample styling ... no-one has to use it. Once it's there I'll remove it from gh-pages.\n\nAlso, all these files need to be organised, and that's something I wanted to do as part of moving to Gulp. I've made a feature branch on my machine, but [having trouble putting all the pieces together](https://github.com/aslansky/css-sprite/issues/20).\n. I remember some discussion before about people not wanting to use them, which is probably why they were removed :frowning: \n\nEDIT: Okay, maybe I'm making that up ... can't seem to find anything in the issues :confused: \n. That makes sense, as in the distributed versions would have the default styling in them. In that case though, wouldn't it be better to have a `styles.less` in the `src/less` folder? That and the result of the `css-sprite` task get compiled, minified and put in the `dist` folder as `emojify.min.css`\n. Excellent, let's move the conversation over to #70 \n. Yep thanks for creating the issue, I recently noticed the same myself actually.\n. This is sort of one of the reasons I never really thought about Node when I wrote this, I'm not quite sure how it would work. I was sort of hoping that it would just work by itself, but it does not unfortunately. Maybe other contributors might have better ideas/solutions? @qq99 @suprememoocow \n. I never really quite got the use-case of running it on the server, and as such it was never a priority IMO. However, I'm looking at moving emojify.js to 1.0 and continually want to make it useful, so I'm not ruling it out. \n\nFor now, I'm in agreement with @qq99, using `.replace()` would be the way to go on the server. Let's just get it working on Node for now. In a future release, we can definitely improve on it. \n\n@adam-lynch: If you'd kindly make a PR, I'll merge.\n. Closing in favour of #67 \n. Thanks for the fix!\n. I really like that, thanks for sharing the link!\n. I'd like to make one addition to that, actually\n\n```\n[*]\nend_of_line = lf\ninsert_final_newline = true\n```\n\nIf you would be so kind :smile: \n. `https://github.com/hassankhan/emojify.js/blob/gh-pages/stylesheets/emojify.min.css` should be the only CSS stylesheet you require to display emoji. But not even really that.\n\nAnd thanks for the link to main-bower-files btw, but I don't understand how that would work with this project.\n. The idea was always to provide the end-user with the tools required to generate their own - you should always create your own, the default CSS is provided for testing purposes more than anything.\n. Could you possibly add another test to the same branch highlighting that too?\n. Cheers mate :smile: \n. I think the tests are still failing:\n\n```\n\u001b[0K$ npm test\n\n> emojify.js@0.9.4 test /home/travis/build/hassankhan/emojify.js\n> grunt test-node && phantomjs phantom.js\n\n\u001b[4mRunning \"mochaTest:test\" (mochaTest) task\u001b[24m\n\n\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m  emojify in a Node environment\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m    .replace\u001b[0m\n\u001b[2K\u001b[0G    \u001b[31m  1) \"before each\" hook\u001b[0m\n\n\n\u001b[92m \u001b[0m\u001b[32m 0 passing\u001b[0m\u001b[90m (6ms)\u001b[0m\n\u001b[31m  1 failing\u001b[0m\n\n\u001b[0m  1) emojify in a Node environment \"before each\" hook:\n\u001b[0m\u001b[31m     ReferenceError: window is not defined\u001b[0m\u001b[90m\n      at /home/travis/build/hassankhan/emojify.js/emojify.js:19:28\n      at /home/travis/build/hassankhan/emojify.js/emojify.js:302:11\n      at document (/home/travis/build/hassankhan/emojify.js/emojify.js:9:26)\n      at Object.<anonymous> (/home/travis/build/hassankhan/emojify.js/emojify.js:14:2)\n      at Module._compile (module.js:456:26)\n      at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:474:10)\n      at Module.load (module.js:356:32)\n      at Function.Module._load (module.js:312:12)\n      at Module.require (module.js:364:17)\n      at require (module.js:380:17)\n\u001b[0m\n\n\n\u001b[33mWarning: Task \"mochaTest:test\" failed.\u0007 Use --force to continue.\u001b[39m\n\n\u001b[31mAborted due to warnings.\u001b[39m\n\u001b[37m\u001b[40mnpm\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[31m\u001b[40mERR!\u001b[0m\u001b[35m\u001b[0m Test failed.

It's an interesting idea, but I'm not quite sure if there's that much of a need for it. You said you needed it for emails, maybe you could use a style inliner instead? I know of at least [one](https://github.com/dwightjack/grunt-premailer)\n. I always thought [Premailer](https://github.com/premailer/premailer) was quite good, it's what I use at work, sure it doesn't suit your needs?\n. Actually .... I've just remembered, you can use `replace(htmlString, replacer)`, where `replacer` is a callback function (see `defaultReplacer` [in the source](https://github.com/hassankhan/emojify.js/blob/master/emojify.js#L152)).\n. I know, you're totally right, the readme is in dire need of a good rewrite. Hope that helps with your use case now, though :smile: \n. Leaving it open so I remember to update the readme\n. Well, it currently uses the `img_dir` value passed in the config object. Is that what you're referring to?\n. I don't think it needs to be, necessarily. Any specific reason why, other than good practice?\n. Yeah that was one of my concerns.\n. I don't agree with the need for all three to be passed (i.e. the emoji found, the name and the emoji). Right now you get the emoji/emoticon pattern that was matched, and the corresponding image name. \n\nHaving the image directory passed through can/maybe should be done, but as it currently stands you can retrieve it from `defaultConfig` anyway, right?\n. I've updated [README.md](https://github.com/hassankhan/emojify.js/blob/develop/README.md), mind having a quick read, see if I've missed anything out?\n. ``` js\nfunction newReplacer(emoji, name) {\n    return emojify.defaultConfig.emojify_tag_type; // Will be whatever you set it to with `emojify.setConfig()`\n}\n```\n\nThanks, I'll update README.md again\n. If you don't pass an image base URL, the default is `'images/emoji'`, just like it says on the readme. I do agree, though, `defaultConfig` is misleading. `defaultConfig` should be the defaults, and there should probably be a `config` object that is a copy of it, which gets overwritten by `emojify.setConfig()`\n. Updated readme in 81573459441ed0d417ccb50823695083d76ec445. Better? I haven't gotten around to the GitHub Pages yet, I'm going to just leave it as a live sample, and make it point to the repo for everything else.\n. Nice!! Looks much better :smile: \n. Pushed another update, mind have a look, please? :smile: \n. Ok, pushed again. \n\n> I so wish I could do this in Node! :smile:\n\nHaha, well I'm planning to remove that in favour of a `blacklist` option which would have that as a default instead.\n. Guess this can safely be closed now :+1: \n. Haha the test name is really funny\n. Do you think you could maybe give it a go @trevorah?\n. Awesome, thanks! :smile: \n. Merged into `develop`. Thanks!\n. Merged into `develop`. Thanks!\n. Merged into `develop`. Thanks!\n. Merged into `develop`. Thanks!\n. Personally I'd prefer the same API on both, wherever possible.\n. @4ver has made a PR (#99) that seems to check all the boxes, marking this as a duplicate and continuing discussion at #94. \n. Merged into `develop`. Thanks!\n. Thanks, let me know if this fixes the problem. I've been having issues with line-endings lately, so that may have been the reason.\n. I don't think anyone's really used the replacer callback before, at least, not to my knowledge. Also, since we're aiming to get to 1.0 soon, I'm not too worried.\n. Yeah I know, in general I try to, just that I've already tagged the release and it'll be getting changed soon enough anyway.\n. HI, could you make the change on the `develop` branch please?\n. Also, can you update the readme as well? Thanks :smile: \n. Cheers :+1: \n. There may have been a specific reason @suprememoocow didn't use it, I'd like to run some tests before I merge, thanks!\n. Merged into `develop`. Thanks!\n. Hmmm that's odd, I'll try and remember to do this tonight :+1: \n. Just pushed 0.9.5 in c9568789ee1602b3beccca9f4e43b5c4b2b9a882, let me know if you have any issues :smile: \n. Could you branch from develop and resend?\n. I must've accidentally gotten rid of it when I rewrote the readme. Thanks for pointing it out! :+1: \n. I'll just use what they are then:\n\n```\noctocat, squirrel, shipit\nCopyright (c) 2012 GitHub Inc. All rights reserved.\n\nbowtie, neckbeard\nCopyright (c) 2012 37signals, LLC.

You haven't set `ignore_emoticons` to `true` by any chance?\n. Actually, yes, emoticons (like `:)` for example) shouldn't be surrounded by `::`. \n. On the `develop` branch please? :smile: \n. It shouldn't be too problematic; any new branch should be branched from `develop` too, you don't want to work from `master` :wink: \n. Any reason why? Usually providing a version like `~1.0` gets you the latest tagged version. Also, this is based off `master` again.\n. Ah right, I confused myself. Will merge tonight :+1: \n. I was watching your commit history (I have your repo added as a remote) and I'm so glad you got rid of the `event-stream` stuff :grinning: \n. Mind if we speak in the [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/hassankhan/emojify.js)?\n. :+1: thank heavens you did\n. [Got a reply](https://twitter.com/testling/status/528297134949695488) on Twitter, apparently they're broken for a few more months.\n. Rationale for getting rid of `only_crawl_id`: Because right now, if you don't pass `emojify.run()` any parameter, then it checks `only_crawl_id`, and if that's not specified it does the whole document body.\n\nI propose changing it so you can do `emojify.run('#content')` and internally use `document.querySelector()` to do the magic. If you don't pass a parameter, it processes the rest of the body as usual.\n. Hi, little update, I think it might also be a good idea to remove `ignored_tags` and make both the `blacklist` and `whitelist` options be an array of valid selectors.\n. Update 2: The `whitelist` and `blacklist` options are now objects, rather than arrays:\n\n``` json\nblacklist: {\n  \"elements\": [\"body\", \"code\", \"script\"],\n  \"classes\": [\"no-emojify\"],\n  \"ids\": [\"special\"]\n}\n```\n. Quick update, I've added the `blacklist` option and renamed `emojify_tag_type`. I'll leave any other improvements till later so v1.0 can be released.\n. Also would be good if we got rid of all of those images, and seeing as different emoji sets may be a new feature, it doesn't make sense to keep them in the repo. Because people (probably) rely on the generated goods, we can just use the `data-uri` images to output a CSS file.\n. Awesome job by @adam-lynch!\n. Nice one @adam-lynch :wink: \n. Well, I hope I'm wrong but I can't seem to find a way to get code coverage from jstest.\n. Well, you can get some sort of coverage information, but no way of converting it to LCOV :frowning: Looks like we might have to switch back to Mocha (+ Chai)\n. Thanks for the link! I'm checking them out now\n. @PeterDaveHello added it to cdnjs in #106, so I think I'll close this issue.\n. Does this have any appreciable effect performance-wise? I would think not, but it would be nice to know? I'll admit, I was a bit against it to begin with but I'm slowly warming to the idea.\n. Alrighty then, I think it's the right thing to do, looking forward to seeing some more commits :smile: \n. I agree, passing a `DomElement` would be ideal\n. I think @4ver's PR satisfies the two checkboxes in the first post, anyone else care to share their thoughts?\n. I believe this issue's ready to be closed, since I've merged #99 \n. Could you also put the source files in a `src` directory too?\n. Thanks!\n. Overall I quite like it, thanks for all your work! \n\nI had a few nitpicks, but after going through it all again it seems I only have one:\n~~I'm not quite sure that `run()` needs the replacer function at all, but I'm sure you have a use-case in mind, could I maybe get an example?~~\n\nI just realised the whole point of this is to get it running on node as well /facepalm\n. Actually, #94 raises a good point here, if we send in a `DomElement` anyway, then does `run()` really require a `replacer` parameter?\n. But what if there's a `mode` parameter, like you suggested? In that case, we could just switch the replacer internally, right?\n. Thanks man! :smile: \n. Not quite sure if we should have to make changes because jsDom doesn't support what we need. There is [an open issue](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/issues/317) on their repo, maybe we should pester them to get it working.\n\nThe only reason I'm hesitant to get rid of TreeWalker is performance-related, last I checked it beats other methods of traversal, but I did check a long time ago :smile: \n. Yep, I'd be happy with that, the other thing, I'd rather it didn't have to pass a `window` object in `run()`, am I missing something?\n. Thanks @4ver!\n. I'll take care of this one ;)\n. Closed in 35a2cc12c6c20c058ab0cb505154319dbf226c3a\n. I'm thinking a simple test setup, we give it a mock blog post HTML page, and get it to run emojify.js on it (x100 times) through both node and browser tests. Time those results, average them, and create a data point which we can use in a graph.\n\nNeed to find:\n- ~~Timing tests libraries~~\n- Graphing libraries\n- Mock HTML\n. Cheers for that!\n. Hi, please make a PR on the `develop` branch. Thanks!\n. Thanks very much for doing this! Quick question, will this update automatically or does it need to be manually updated?\n. [This](https://github.com/trevorah/emojify-parser/blob/master/scripts/download-emoji.js) might be useful\n. Let me know when this is okay to merge and I'll do it. Thanks!\n. Thanks a bunch for all your hard work!\n. Yeah that sounds cool, although if it runs on node isn't it guaranteed to run on any platform where node is installed?\n. Oh right, just thought I'd ask, I was sure you had a good reason :+1: \n. FYI I'll make you a collaborator on this repo later tonight hopefully\n. Done\n. Seems to be working but failing hard thanks to css-sprite.\n. Because the idea is we provide the bare essentials, and you are free to do whatever you like to it in your own project :smile: \n. Hopefully this'll be covered in a future update :+1: \n. Done\n. I can't seem to reproduce the problem...\n. This is still a bug in `master`\n. Not too sure, we discussed this before didn't we? It's clear from the README that we only support IE9+, if you want to use anything below you should use the shim.\n\nI'm not opposed to adding the shim as part of the package, but I'd love to hear from other contributors. @adam-lynch, @4ver, @qq99 thoughts?\n. Yeah I think we do have some aliases (based on emoji-cheat-sheet.com), so it shouldn't be a massive problem adding those in.\n. I would say you should add `no-emojify` to your icon classes, but try updating and let me know if it's still an issue\n. If you update, you should be able to provide a `blacklist.classes` array of classnames you don't want emojified.\n. Any luck?\n. In the source, `blacklist` is an object, like so:\n\n``` js\nvar defaultConfig = {\n    blacklist: {\n        'ids': [],\n        'classes': ['no-emojify'],\n        'elements': ['script', 'textarea', 'a', 'pre', 'code']\n    },\n    tag_type: null,\n    only_crawl_id: null,\n    img_dir: 'images/emoji',\n    ignore_emoticons: false,\n    mode: 'img'\n};\n```\n\nSorry, I'm unable to test right now because I'm at work :smile:\n. Yeah I remember this, any ideas on how to get around it? Call it `plus1` instead?\n. Would you mind checking again on the latest version? Thanks\n. Thanks for reporting back!\n. You should really thank @adam-lynch and @4ver, this was all their work :smile: \n\nPS: I don't understand why Bower isn't updating, everything seems to be in order :confounded: \n. Thanks for pointing that out, clearly something's gone wrong with `package.json`, I'll do another release when I get home\n. https://github.com/hassankhan/emojify.js/blob/master/.npmignore#L1\n. I've published a new version on NPM, could you try it out and let me know? It seems to work for me\n. This is pretty awesome, should definitely be added.\n. Yeah this has kind of been on hold lately, it would be nice to see a PR :wink: \n\nThe only thing is I don't think it'd be great to limit ourselves to just the GitHub emoji, in an ideal world, we'd be able to use different sets (EmojiOne, Twitter etc.)\n. Yeah there are a few aliases in there, it's not a bug, it's a feature (_cringes_)\n. You can go to emoji-cheat-sheet.com, that's where we pull all our emojis from :smile: \n. Thanks! Could you also add a test case?\n. I thought this got fixed in #57 :disappointed: \n. Ahhhh righty, I thought the issue got fixed somewhere along then\n. We pull all emojis from emoji-cheat-sheet.com, if the icons are incorrect could you please create an issue on their tracker? Thanks! :smile: \n. Ahhh okay, I'll update and do a new release. Thanks!!\n. Can you send me the source HTML?\n. If you could send me a reproducible test case on JSFiddle or similar, it would be really helpful. Thanks :)\n. As a workaround, apply the `no-emojify` class to your `<a>` tags\n. You could either remove the `http://` prefix, or wrap the link with any tag (`<span>`, `<a>`, `<p>`) and give it the `no-emojify` class. I can't think of any other way right now :(\n. I'd leave it open for now, it's a bug that needs to be fixed. Thanks for reporting the issue!\n. Can you do this on `develop` instead of `master` please? Thanks :smile: \n. Yeah I don't see any reason why not, definitely add it to the PR! \n. Hi Adam, I asked the EmojiOne folk to take ownership of the project, we'll all stay on as contributors but I think it's a better home for the project :)\n. The repo will be moved to the Ranks org, I believe, this is just temporary. \nEmojiOne won't be changing much in terms of code, they don't have enough time to do it themselves. Any issues/features/bugfixes can still go ahead :smile: \n. It's all done now! \n. Hi guys, any update on this? Would it be possible to get write access so we can merge PRs and such? :smile: \n. Thanks, got it this time :smile: \n. I've recently transferred the repo to Ranks and lost my write access in the process. I'll ping them and try and get this merged :)\n. Thanks for the PR! :+1: \n. Hi, since we currently depend on emoji-cheat-sheet for emoji, we will have to wait till they add them :)\n. Hi there, not quite sure what's happened. Anyone got any ideas?\n. I'll try running `npm publish` again\n. I've tried doing another release, nothing worked. I really have zero ideas on what's causing this ... to my knowledge the .npmignore hasn't changed, nor has anything else. Any help from anyone else would be highly appreciated\n. [No build errors or anything, no](https://travis-ci.org/Ranks/emojify.js/). Seems like an issue with NPM or an `*ignore` file.\n. I believe it's all working now, really really sorry for the inconvenience\n. My pleasure, sorry it took so long\n. +1 will need to check this out, I didn't think it worked that way\n. Hi sorry, hadn't had a chance to review. Thanks! :+1: \n. Yeah definitely go for it! :smile: \n. Have you tried removing the `node_modules` folder and running `npm install` again?\n. Weird, I had the same error a while ago. Looks like `css-sprite` has been deprecated in favour of `sprity`, I think - that'll need to updated at some point too I imagine :/\n. Is this on the latest tagged release?\n. Bower automatically updates to the latest tagged release on Github.\n. Hi, could you do a PR on the `develop` branch? Thanks :+1: \n. Thanks very much :smile: !\n. I'm really sorry guys, if anyone can come up with a PR that'd be mighty helpful - I'm not sure any of the contributors have much spare time at the moment.\n. Could you make this PR target the `develop` branch, please? Thanks\n. I wrote this library back when browsers didn't - as such this library is outdated and in urgent need of some love.\n. It's not mine - its [here](https://github.com/Ranks/emojione), seems to have most of the options this has and then some.\n\nI just don't do a lot of frontend any more, haven't had the chance to give this the attention it needs and doubt I will be able to in the foreseeable future. It's had a nice long run, and I'm glad it's helped so many people, but I just don't have time any more to maintain this :(\n. No problem :)\n. Sorry that you had to deal with it, unfortunately I'm not really maintaining this library any more \ud83d\ude1e . I'm sorry the project isn't maintained any more, feel free to fork this repo and make any changes to it. Sorry \ud83d\ude2c . Me neither, that's kind of why this issue's never been closed. Perhaps one day someone smarter than us will come up with a solution :smile: \n. Not sure if its completely applicable, but I think I might add some more CSS:\n\n``` css\n.emoji {\n  ...\n  text-rendering: auto; // optimizelegibility throws things off #1094\n  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;\n  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;\n  transform: translate(0, 0); // ensures no half-pixel rendering in firefox\n}\n\n```\n. The fix was actually simpler than I thought, changed `@emoji-size` to 1.5em as a constant, seems to fit well within the text I tested.\n. Fixed the issue for Chrome and Safari at least. Internet Explorer fails on the `appendChild()` function on line 680.\n. Fixed by not giving a shit. Sayonara, IE9!\n. Added sane defaults, fixed in [commit 9c2361f](https://github.com/hassankhan/emojify.js/commit/9c2361fc264a9efc40984cfdc0c1ae6abc915578)\n. Its better this way.\n. Thank you for using it and making this pull request, you've made my day!\n. Yep done that :)\n. Yeah, thought I'd leave it out, in case someone wanted to strip unnecessary ones out\n. Well I thought if you didn't need specific sets, then you could just remove the LESS for them? Do you know how to dynamically load in stylesheets as needed? This should be definitely be an enhancement.\n. Just thought of a crude way, should work though. Using jQuery, add in a new `<link>` tag pointing to the stylesheet. Only thing is, you'd probably still need a way of knowing where each emoji icon is. \n. Yeah the point of emojify.js was explicitly NOT have to have separate images, I suppose one could separate the emojis into stylesheets by category, but that's probably the closest this can get to a better solution.\n. Sorry for the late reply, thank you very much for your detailed response. \n\nSince its more than overdue for a refactor, I will be taking your suggestions into account. Thank you.\n. Cool, thanks. but that's only for one emoji if I'm not mistaken (correct me if I'm wrong). Would rather have a solution that works for all, could probably throw in an exclude words array and join that with the emoji code.\n. Errr yeah you can, its not perfect but just add `class='no-emojify'` to your `<pre>` tags.\n. Hmmmm ... well you can mix normal HTML and Markdown, which IS valid Markdown. If you don't want to do that, then you could probably specify (by `id`) which elements you want to emojify:\n\n```\nemojify.setConfig({\n    only_crawl_id: 'messages_container'  #only do this when you want to restrict where emojify.js applies.\n});\n```\n\nOther than that though, I'm not sure what else you could do. I don't have time right now, maybe I could look into updating it over the weekend (and possibly turning into a jQuery plugin). \n. Go to `less\\emojify.less` and comment out whichever emojis you don't want. Hope that helps?\n. AMD as in Javascript? Any specific benefit it would bring?\n. Errrr shouldn't be that way, no. I'll have to double check it.\n. A JSfiddle example would've been more helpful, still haven't had time to look at it.\n. http://jsfiddle.net/hassankhan/99JRb/\n. I'm not sure where exactly its going wrong, and its been so long since I've looked at it that its not quite clear to me any more.\n\nSince its pretty crap, might throw in the towel and do a rewrite :)\n. Hi there, you need to compile the LESS to CSS yourself. You can do it online, or by downloading and using a LESS compiler.\n. Oh sorry, overlooked that, I'll fix the readme. Thanks :smile:\n. Sweet, looks good to me, does it work correctly?\n. Cheers, thanks :smiley: \n. Ah that's alright, I was kind of in the middle of some work on it myself so I'll sort it out myself. Thanks anyway.\n. Yeah sounds awesome! Please do :+1: \n. I think this is probably unnecessary thanks to the awesome work by [GitterHQ](https://github.com/gitterHQ) :smile:\n. Ah, sorry dude, I just saw this. :disappointed: \n. I thought it'd be better to keep it there, any specific reason you think it should be removed?\n. Oh. My. God.\n\nI think I'm in love with you guys, thank you so so so much! Definitely accepting the PR, didn't realise that this would ever be that useful to anyone so I'm quite shocked (in a good way)\n. Yeah I'll be sure to, just browsed through the code and it's a pleasure to read. I was wondering if you'd grabbed the latest version of the [emoji-cheat-sheet repo](https://github.com/arvida/emoji-cheat-sheet.com) when you rewrote it?\n. Haha yeah, that's been something that I've been meaning to do for ages to. To be honest with you, when I first wrote it, I did it manually :persevere: but a build script would be awesome.\n. Also, would you mind terribly if I added \"Used by Gitter\" in the readme file?\n. @jimmybrancaccio Hopefully will update soon with latest source from [emoji-cheat-sheet](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/)\n\n@mydigitalself I most certainly will :smile: \n. Hiya, thanks for the awesome PR! Looks good to me, but I would personally prefer the tests to be in Javascript, if possible :smile: \n\nThanks a lot for taking the time to write the tests though\n. Haha thanks for the heads up, ummm, to be completely honest with you, I do prefer the Javascript syntax :blush: if only for the fact it keeps the project somewhat uniform\n. That's a good point, actually, I'm not sure. I think it _should_, but I agree with you about feeling dirty about it.\n\nActually, yes, I think unescaping and then matching them would probably be the best bet, unless you have another better-er idea :smile: \n. Yep, if anything I believe that was how it used to work (or at least was how it was intended to work)\n\nAlso, a massive thank-you for doing all of this.\n. Also including @suprememoocow in the conversation, since Gitter's using it on their site, might be worth making sure it doesn't break anything for them, too.\n. Mate, every time you comment I learn something, never heard of Testling before but it looks awesome. I think @qq99 is happy with Javascript tests as well, so if everything's good I'll go ahead and merge (personally haven't checked the tests yet, so let me know)\n. Closed in favour of #27 \n. Haha thanks for checking, but are all the emojis on the website working for emojify.js? I'm pretty sure (but don't quote me on this) that they've added a fair few new ones :smile: \n. Yep, forgot to close it. By way of interest, would you like to be added as a collaborator to the repo?\n. I think I might make this at the least, some sort of an option. While I personally appreciate the advantages that spriting brings, I think that's best left to the actual web developers themselves. \n\nSome people might only want a handful of emojis, and would rather not download the whole sprite. I remember a few issues people opened saying they didn't want to download a CSS file full of data-URI images. I thought I'd made it pretty easy with the LESS file, but some didn't agree.\n\nWhat **can** be done, however, is using the emoji name as a class name. You would create your spritesheet, and it would automatically add `emoji <emoji name>` to the class attribute of the tag. It's a fairly simple change, maybe @suprememoocow could share his views?\n. I'm personally not sure, I'd rather leave it up to the user. We provide all the images, it should be up to the end user to turn them into sprites if they so wish.\n\nThat said, if we DO add this, I'd prefer it to be a Grunt task. Thanks all :+1: \n. That sounds about right, I think there are some other things we might want to do, for example, we might want to prefix the classes with something, probably `emoji` i.e. `emoji-wink`, `emoji-smile` etc. Then add an option as you mentioned to tell emojify.js to use a stylesheet.\n\nLook forward to seeing your PR :+1:  \n. Closed in #98\n. Sweet, thanks for catching this one :smile: \n. Fucking aces, man, nice work! :kissing_heart: \n. If it's alright with you @qq99 then shall I merge this PR and close your one?\n. Thanks again guys, really appreciate the effort you've put into this :smile: Can't seem to get Testling CI working, but that's probably due to my own incompetence.\n. Good catch, nice job with the tests too. I've added you as a collaborator on the repo, so if you push directly to the repo, it should work, unless you'd rather do a PR?\n. Awesome, all done :+1: \n. I'll leave this open until the documentation is accurate.\n. Fixed the README, closing the issue now.\n. Hiya, thanks for the PR :smile: could you add a test case or two as well?\n. I've tried writing tests, and it failed for me.\n. We have the `ignore_emoticons` option, anyway\n. Thanks @dunckr, I believe it used to do this before the recent rewrite, but I may be mistaken. In any case, thanks for the PR!\n. Yep, looks brilliant to me. Thanks!\n. Can you provide some more context? What were you trying to do?\n. Ah, nice catch. The old version used to have the same bug as well. Thanks!\n. That's weird, I'll try and have a look later this week.\n. Ahhh perfect, thanks so much.\n\nAs a sidenote, does this resolve #36?\n. Thank you for your amazing work again, @qq99!!\n. Sorry, I haven't had time to look into the PR yet, hopefully one of the other contributors might be able to help.\n\nI'm not quite sure I understand what the new option does, or if it's named correctly, perhaps? \nIf it is set to true (default), then `hello:(` would render an emoji, otherwise not? If that's the case, then maybe instead of adding an option, we could do some sort of check to see if it's the end of the text and render based on that.\n. I don't know if this is the case, but do you run the Markdown parser first and then emojify.js? If all the markdown is converted to HTML, then it wouldn't happen at all surely?\n. Perhaps it would be best to not emojify the text if you're trying to display raw Markdown? You could add an `id` attribute to the diff view and have Emojify.js exclude it? This is all armchair conjecture, I haven't seen your project at all.\n\nThanks\n. Hi @tessi, I think it might be better to limit where Emojify works instead. Currently it works on everything unless you restrict it to an `id`, perhaps we can add an ID for exclusion as well. I'll close this issue, and maybe we could try another PR adding exclusion support?\n. Yep, I will do shortly, just made an account on npmjs.org\n. Sorry, been busy flying between countries, now I'm back at work, will have to look at it on the weekend :smile: \n. All done: https://www.npmjs.org/package/emojify.js\n. Sorry it took so long, I think I might've found a bug in npmjs.org.\n. Other than what I mentioned above, it looks sound to me. Obviously as you said, you'll add the tests, so I'm happy :+1: \n. +1 from me, maybe @qq99 and @suprememoocow could share their thoughts, too?\n. Awesome, I'm happy to wait for a second set of eyes to look through the PR.\n. +1 from me I think, looks pretty complete to me.\n. Thanks all for your input!\n. ### ~~Use shim for IE8 and co.~~\n\n[Relevant issue](https://github.com/hassankhan/emojify.js/issues/46)\n\n### ~~Spritesheets~~\n\n[Relevant issue](https://github.com/hassankhan/emojify.js/issues/24)\n. ### ~~Cleanup project root~~\n\n[Relevant issue](https://github.com/hassankhan/emojify.js/issues/88)\n. ### ~~Automate version bumping~~\n\n[Relevant issue](https://github.com/hassankhan/emojify.js/issues/89)\n. ### ~~Add emojify.js to a CDN~~\n\n[Relevant issue](https://github.com/hassankhan/emojify.js/issues/91)\n. ### Remove `images` directory\n\nNow part of [this issue](https://github.com/hassankhan/emojify.js/issues/88)\n. ### ~~Support Node environment properly~~\n\n~~[Relevant issue](https://github.com/hassankhan/emojify.js/issues/67)~~\n[Relevant issue](https://github.com/hassankhan/emojify.js/issues/94)\n. ### Add code coverage results\n\n[Relevant issue](https://github.com/hassankhan/emojify.js/issues/90)\n. Have you perchance got [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.io) installed on Chrome? I installed it yesterday, has a pretty good board (or at least I thought so)\n. Yep, I agree. Last thing I wanted to do was integrate the failing test PRs (#62 and #57) and see if those've been fixed. If that's all good, I think it's time to release 1.0!!\n. Oh, actually there was one more thing I wanted to do: tidy up config options. I'll try and find some time this weekend to land that, then I'm happy for you to release.\n\nBTW, can you even submit to npm for me? I thought I had to update my npm packages myself :confused: \n. There's an open issue (#87) for the config options. I'll run the `npm owner` command when I get home later tonight, hopefully :smile: Might also be worth adding `npm publish` to the `gulp release` command\n. Hiya, sorry it's been mental at work launching [a few campaigns](http://playstation20.eu.playstation.com), will probably do the release over the Xmas break\n. I'd prefer a 0.10 release first, before I get some time to redo the options.\n. v1.0 is finally out, thanks everyone!\n. Hi there, not quite sure what this PR is trying to achieve, why do you need those specific emoji and not the rest?\n. I think I understand what you're talking about, however I don't think hardcoding specific emoji keywords is the solution. Perhaps a more programmatic way of defining the emoji you want to convert would be better.\n. Hmm, ok, I misunderstood what the `named` key did. @qq99 @suprememoocow any thoughts?\n. Thanks for the PR!\n. Pretty sure I added Emojify.js to the NPM registry a while ago, if I merge this PR, will it update automatically?\n. Ok, I'll double-check when I'm at home :+1: \n. Any issues I might not have seen @qq99 @suprememoocow ?\n. @leoasis Do you think you could remove the whitespace and commit again? Happy to merge after that.\n. Thanks for the PR! Also, while we're here, correct me if I'm wrong, but if I run `npm publish` on the folder, shouldn't it update by itself? I seem to be getting errors :frowning: \n. Haha thanks, I figured that out a second ago and fixed it. It's all good now :+1: \n. Do they have a repo or anything anywhere? Can't seem to find one...\n. Ahh this is pretty awesome news! I'm sure we could tweak the `update.sh` script to be able to modify where it updates from, and Emoji One provide PNGs anyway.\n. Not as easy as I initially thought, [the PNG's](https://github.com/Ranks/emojione/tree/master/assets/png) are named by their unicode points BUT on the plus side, they also have SVG formats too!\n\nEDIT: Found [`emoji.json`](https://github.com/Ranks/emojione/blob/master/emoji.json) which lists them all along with their unicode codepoint\n. I think it'd be great if we turned this into a `gulp` task.\n. Doubtful, Internet Explorer is this library's weak point.\n. I think we should ask @suprememoocow, he spent a lot of time rewriting it to make it performant, so I'd hate to lay waste to his work.\n. Oooh, that'd actually be quite cool. \n. @JustBlackBird Well, we already have a Testling banner that shows support across different browsers. Is that what you meant?\n\nIn general, I'm :+1: on this, if it isn't too much work.\n. Hmm ok, but how would we automate testing it if it actually works using the shim i.e. using Testling? \n. I'll be honest with you, I'm not sure where to start with respect to making tests work like that. Do you think it would be possible to make a quick proof-of-concept PR just so I can see how it would work? Once we know for sure that it works with the shims, then I'll update the documentation, too, thanks :smile: \n. Ah bollocks to it, if someone wants to run it on IE8, they can do it at their own risk. I'll add a disclaimer.\n. Sorry, been really busy at work and not had any time over the weekend. Apparently there's a merge conflict, so I'll resolve that tomorrow hopefully and merge the PR. Thanks!!\n. There were some line ending issues, apparently I hadn't set `core.autocrlf=true` on my laptop :confused: Anyway all done now, thanks!\n. Could you add a failing test please? \n. Will follow up [here](https://github.com/hassankhan/emojify.js/pull/62)\n. I believe they are listed on the [GitHub pages](http://hassankhan.github.io/emojify.js/). Thanks for pointing this out!\n. How so? I don't understand :confused: \n\nEDIT: Ahhh, as it stands, some don't work, and some don't work because they're lowercase/uppercase.\n. Yes, that was always the plan, I just got lazy and haven't updated the GH Pages in a while\n. I've updated [README.md](https://github.com/hassankhan/emojify.js/blob/develop/README.md). Is it better now?\n. This little snippet?:\n\n``` css\n.emoji {\n    width: 1.5em;\n    height: 1.5em;\n    display: inline-block;\n    margin-bottom: -0.25em;\n}\n```\n. I think it might be better to add that as a LESS file, like I used to originally. I'm going to make a separate issue for it and close this one now. Thanks!\n. Well, not exactly. It's just sample styling ... no-one has to use it. Once it's there I'll remove it from gh-pages.\n\nAlso, all these files need to be organised, and that's something I wanted to do as part of moving to Gulp. I've made a feature branch on my machine, but [having trouble putting all the pieces together](https://github.com/aslansky/css-sprite/issues/20).\n. I remember some discussion before about people not wanting to use them, which is probably why they were removed :frowning: \n\nEDIT: Okay, maybe I'm making that up ... can't seem to find anything in the issues :confused: \n. That makes sense, as in the distributed versions would have the default styling in them. In that case though, wouldn't it be better to have a `styles.less` in the `src/less` folder? That and the result of the `css-sprite` task get compiled, minified and put in the `dist` folder as `emojify.min.css`\n. Excellent, let's move the conversation over to #70 \n. Yep thanks for creating the issue, I recently noticed the same myself actually.\n. This is sort of one of the reasons I never really thought about Node when I wrote this, I'm not quite sure how it would work. I was sort of hoping that it would just work by itself, but it does not unfortunately. Maybe other contributors might have better ideas/solutions? @qq99 @suprememoocow \n. I never really quite got the use-case of running it on the server, and as such it was never a priority IMO. However, I'm looking at moving emojify.js to 1.0 and continually want to make it useful, so I'm not ruling it out. \n\nFor now, I'm in agreement with @qq99, using `.replace()` would be the way to go on the server. Let's just get it working on Node for now. In a future release, we can definitely improve on it. \n\n@adam-lynch: If you'd kindly make a PR, I'll merge.\n. Closing in favour of #67 \n. Thanks for the fix!\n. I really like that, thanks for sharing the link!\n. I'd like to make one addition to that, actually\n\n```\n[*]\nend_of_line = lf\ninsert_final_newline = true\n```\n\nIf you would be so kind :smile: \n. `https://github.com/hassankhan/emojify.js/blob/gh-pages/stylesheets/emojify.min.css` should be the only CSS stylesheet you require to display emoji. But not even really that.\n\nAnd thanks for the link to main-bower-files btw, but I don't understand how that would work with this project.\n. The idea was always to provide the end-user with the tools required to generate their own - you should always create your own, the default CSS is provided for testing purposes more than anything.\n. Could you possibly add another test to the same branch highlighting that too?\n. Cheers mate :smile: \n.

It's an interesting idea, but I'm not quite sure if there's that much of a need for it. You said you needed it for emails, maybe you could use a style inliner instead? I know of at least [one](https://github.com/dwightjack/grunt-premailer)\n. I always thought [Premailer](https://github.com/premailer/premailer) was quite good, it's what I use at work, sure it doesn't suit your needs?\n. Actually .... I've just remembered, you can use `replace(htmlString, replacer)`, where `replacer` is a callback function (see `defaultReplacer` [in the source](https://github.com/hassankhan/emojify.js/blob/master/emojify.js#L152)).\n. I know, you're totally right, the readme is in dire need of a good rewrite. Hope that helps with your use case now, though :smile: \n. Leaving it open so I remember to update the readme\n. Well, it currently uses the `img_dir` value passed in the config object. Is that what you're referring to?\n. I don't think it needs to be, necessarily. Any specific reason why, other than good practice?\n. Yeah that was one of my concerns.\n. I don't agree with the need for all three to be passed (i.e. the emoji found, the name and the emoji). Right now you get the emoji/emoticon pattern that was matched, and the corresponding image name. \n\nHaving the image directory passed through can/maybe should be done, but as it currently stands you can retrieve it from `defaultConfig` anyway, right?\n. I've updated [README.md](https://github.com/hassankhan/emojify.js/blob/develop/README.md), mind having a quick read, see if I've missed anything out?\n. ``` js\nfunction newReplacer(emoji, name) {\n    return emojify.defaultConfig.emojify_tag_type; // Will be whatever you set it to with `emojify.setConfig()`\n}\n```\n\nThanks, I'll update README.md again\n. If you don't pass an image base URL, the default is `'images/emoji'`, just like it says on the readme. I do agree, though, `defaultConfig` is misleading. `defaultConfig` should be the defaults, and there should probably be a `config` object that is a copy of it, which gets overwritten by `emojify.setConfig()`\n. Updated readme in 81573459441ed0d417ccb50823695083d76ec445. Better? I haven't gotten around to the GitHub Pages yet, I'm going to just leave it as a live sample, and make it point to the repo for everything else.\n. Nice!! Looks much better :smile: \n. Pushed another update, mind have a look, please? :smile: \n. Ok, pushed again. \n\n> I so wish I could do this in Node! :smile:\n\nHaha, well I'm planning to remove that in favour of a `blacklist` option which would have that as a default instead.\n. Guess this can safely be closed now :+1: \n. Haha the test name is really funny\n. Do you think you could maybe give it a go @trevorah?\n. Awesome, thanks! :smile: \n. Merged into `develop`. Thanks!\n. Merged into `develop`. Thanks!\n. Merged into `develop`. Thanks!\n. Merged into `develop`. Thanks!\n. Personally I'd prefer the same API on both, wherever possible.\n. @4ver has made a PR (#99) that seems to check all the boxes, marking this as a duplicate and continuing discussion at #94. \n. Merged into `develop`. Thanks!\n. Thanks, let me know if this fixes the problem. I've been having issues with line-endings lately, so that may have been the reason.\n. I don't think anyone's really used the replacer callback before, at least, not to my knowledge. Also, since we're aiming to get to 1.0 soon, I'm not too worried.\n. Yeah I know, in general I try to, just that I've already tagged the release and it'll be getting changed soon enough anyway.\n. HI, could you make the change on the `develop` branch please?\n. Also, can you update the readme as well? Thanks :smile: \n. Cheers :+1: \n. There may have been a specific reason @suprememoocow didn't use it, I'd like to run some tests before I merge, thanks!\n. Merged into `develop`. Thanks!\n. Hmmm that's odd, I'll try and remember to do this tonight :+1: \n. Just pushed 0.9.5 in c9568789ee1602b3beccca9f4e43b5c4b2b9a882, let me know if you have any issues :smile: \n. Could you branch from develop and resend?\n. I must've accidentally gotten rid of it when I rewrote the readme. Thanks for pointing it out! :+1: \n. I'll just use what they are then:\n\n```\noctocat, squirrel, shipit\nCopyright (c) 2012 GitHub Inc. All rights reserved.\n\nbowtie, neckbeard\nCopyright (c) 2012 37signals, LLC.

You haven't set `ignore_emoticons` to `true` by any chance?\n. Actually, yes, emoticons (like `:)` for example) shouldn't be surrounded by `::`. \n. On the `develop` branch please? :smile: \n. It shouldn't be too problematic; any new branch should be branched from `develop` too, you don't want to work from `master` :wink: \n. Any reason why? Usually providing a version like `~1.0` gets you the latest tagged version. Also, this is based off `master` again.\n. Ah right, I confused myself. Will merge tonight :+1: \n. I was watching your commit history (I have your repo added as a remote) and I'm so glad you got rid of the `event-stream` stuff :grinning: \n. Mind if we speak in the [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/hassankhan/emojify.js)?\n. :+1: thank heavens you did\n. [Got a reply](https://twitter.com/testling/status/528297134949695488) on Twitter, apparently they're broken for a few more months.\n. Rationale for getting rid of `only_crawl_id`: Because right now, if you don't pass `emojify.run()` any parameter, then it checks `only_crawl_id`, and if that's not specified it does the whole document body.\n\nI propose changing it so you can do `emojify.run('#content')` and internally use `document.querySelector()` to do the magic. If you don't pass a parameter, it processes the rest of the body as usual.\n. Hi, little update, I think it might also be a good idea to remove `ignored_tags` and make both the `blacklist` and `whitelist` options be an array of valid selectors.\n. Update 2: The `whitelist` and `blacklist` options are now objects, rather than arrays:\n\n``` json\nblacklist: {\n  \"elements\": [\"body\", \"code\", \"script\"],\n  \"classes\": [\"no-emojify\"],\n  \"ids\": [\"special\"]\n}\n```\n. Quick update, I've added the `blacklist` option and renamed `emojify_tag_type`. I'll leave any other improvements till later so v1.0 can be released.\n. Also would be good if we got rid of all of those images, and seeing as different emoji sets may be a new feature, it doesn't make sense to keep them in the repo. Because people (probably) rely on the generated goods, we can just use the `data-uri` images to output a CSS file.\n. Awesome job by @adam-lynch!\n. Nice one @adam-lynch :wink: \n. Well, I hope I'm wrong but I can't seem to find a way to get code coverage from jstest.\n. Well, you can get some sort of coverage information, but no way of converting it to LCOV :frowning: Looks like we might have to switch back to Mocha (+ Chai)\n. Thanks for the link! I'm checking them out now\n. @PeterDaveHello added it to cdnjs in #106, so I think I'll close this issue.\n. Does this have any appreciable effect performance-wise? I would think not, but it would be nice to know? I'll admit, I was a bit against it to begin with but I'm slowly warming to the idea.\n. Alrighty then, I think it's the right thing to do, looking forward to seeing some more commits :smile: \n. I agree, passing a `DomElement` would be ideal\n. I think @4ver's PR satisfies the two checkboxes in the first post, anyone else care to share their thoughts?\n. I believe this issue's ready to be closed, since I've merged #99 \n. Could you also put the source files in a `src` directory too?\n. Thanks!\n. Overall I quite like it, thanks for all your work! \n\nI had a few nitpicks, but after going through it all again it seems I only have one:\n~~I'm not quite sure that `run()` needs the replacer function at all, but I'm sure you have a use-case in mind, could I maybe get an example?~~\n\nI just realised the whole point of this is to get it running on node as well /facepalm\n. Actually, #94 raises a good point here, if we send in a `DomElement` anyway, then does `run()` really require a `replacer` parameter?\n. But what if there's a `mode` parameter, like you suggested? In that case, we could just switch the replacer internally, right?\n. Thanks man! :smile: \n. Not quite sure if we should have to make changes because jsDom doesn't support what we need. There is [an open issue](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/issues/317) on their repo, maybe we should pester them to get it working.\n\nThe only reason I'm hesitant to get rid of TreeWalker is performance-related, last I checked it beats other methods of traversal, but I did check a long time ago :smile: \n. Yep, I'd be happy with that, the other thing, I'd rather it didn't have to pass a `window` object in `run()`, am I missing something?\n. Thanks @4ver!\n. I'll take care of this one ;)\n. Closed in 35a2cc12c6c20c058ab0cb505154319dbf226c3a\n. I'm thinking a simple test setup, we give it a mock blog post HTML page, and get it to run emojify.js on it (x100 times) through both node and browser tests. Time those results, average them, and create a data point which we can use in a graph.\n\nNeed to find:\n- ~~Timing tests libraries~~\n- Graphing libraries\n- Mock HTML\n. Cheers for that!\n. Hi, please make a PR on the `develop` branch. Thanks!\n. Thanks very much for doing this! Quick question, will this update automatically or does it need to be manually updated?\n. [This](https://github.com/trevorah/emojify-parser/blob/master/scripts/download-emoji.js) might be useful\n. Let me know when this is okay to merge and I'll do it. Thanks!\n. Thanks a bunch for all your hard work!\n. Yeah that sounds cool, although if it runs on node isn't it guaranteed to run on any platform where node is installed?\n. Oh right, just thought I'd ask, I was sure you had a good reason :+1: \n. FYI I'll make you a collaborator on this repo later tonight hopefully\n. Done\n. Seems to be working but failing hard thanks to css-sprite.\n. Because the idea is we provide the bare essentials, and you are free to do whatever you like to it in your own project :smile: \n. Hopefully this'll be covered in a future update :+1: \n. Done\n. I can't seem to reproduce the problem...\n. This is still a bug in `master`\n. Not too sure, we discussed this before didn't we? It's clear from the README that we only support IE9+, if you want to use anything below you should use the shim.\n\nI'm not opposed to adding the shim as part of the package, but I'd love to hear from other contributors. @adam-lynch, @4ver, @qq99 thoughts?\n. Yeah I think we do have some aliases (based on emoji-cheat-sheet.com), so it shouldn't be a massive problem adding those in.\n. I would say you should add `no-emojify` to your icon classes, but try updating and let me know if it's still an issue\n. If you update, you should be able to provide a `blacklist.classes` array of classnames you don't want emojified.\n. Any luck?\n. In the source, `blacklist` is an object, like so:\n\n``` js\nvar defaultConfig = {\n    blacklist: {\n        'ids': [],\n        'classes': ['no-emojify'],\n        'elements': ['script', 'textarea', 'a', 'pre', 'code']\n    },\n    tag_type: null,\n    only_crawl_id: null,\n    img_dir: 'images/emoji',\n    ignore_emoticons: false,\n    mode: 'img'\n};\n```\n\nSorry, I'm unable to test right now because I'm at work :smile:\n. Yeah I remember this, any ideas on how to get around it? Call it `plus1` instead?\n. Would you mind checking again on the latest version? Thanks\n. Thanks for reporting back!\n. You should really thank @adam-lynch and @4ver, this was all their work :smile: \n\nPS: I don't understand why Bower isn't updating, everything seems to be in order :confounded: \n. Thanks for pointing that out, clearly something's gone wrong with `package.json`, I'll do another release when I get home\n. https://github.com/hassankhan/emojify.js/blob/master/.npmignore#L1\n. I've published a new version on NPM, could you try it out and let me know? It seems to work for me\n. This is pretty awesome, should definitely be added.\n. Yeah this has kind of been on hold lately, it would be nice to see a PR :wink: \n\nThe only thing is I don't think it'd be great to limit ourselves to just the GitHub emoji, in an ideal world, we'd be able to use different sets (EmojiOne, Twitter etc.)\n. Yeah there are a few aliases in there, it's not a bug, it's a feature (_cringes_)\n. You can go to emoji-cheat-sheet.com, that's where we pull all our emojis from :smile: \n. Thanks! Could you also add a test case?\n. I thought this got fixed in #57 :disappointed: \n. Ahhhh righty, I thought the issue got fixed somewhere along then\n. We pull all emojis from emoji-cheat-sheet.com, if the icons are incorrect could you please create an issue on their tracker? Thanks! :smile: \n. Ahhh okay, I'll update and do a new release. Thanks!!\n. Can you send me the source HTML?\n. If you could send me a reproducible test case on JSFiddle or similar, it would be really helpful. Thanks :)\n. As a workaround, apply the `no-emojify` class to your `<a>` tags\n. You could either remove the `http://` prefix, or wrap the link with any tag (`<span>`, `<a>`, `<p>`) and give it the `no-emojify` class. I can't think of any other way right now :(\n. I'd leave it open for now, it's a bug that needs to be fixed. Thanks for reporting the issue!\n. Can you do this on `develop` instead of `master` please? Thanks :smile: \n. Yeah I don't see any reason why not, definitely add it to the PR! \n. Hi Adam, I asked the EmojiOne folk to take ownership of the project, we'll all stay on as contributors but I think it's a better home for the project :)\n. The repo will be moved to the Ranks org, I believe, this is just temporary. \nEmojiOne won't be changing much in terms of code, they don't have enough time to do it themselves. Any issues/features/bugfixes can still go ahead :smile: \n. It's all done now! \n. Hi guys, any update on this? Would it be possible to get write access so we can merge PRs and such? :smile: \n. Thanks, got it this time :smile: \n. I've recently transferred the repo to Ranks and lost my write access in the process. I'll ping them and try and get this merged :)\n. Thanks for the PR! :+1: \n. Hi, since we currently depend on emoji-cheat-sheet for emoji, we will have to wait till they add them :)\n. Hi there, not quite sure what's happened. Anyone got any ideas?\n. I'll try running `npm publish` again\n. I've tried doing another release, nothing worked. I really have zero ideas on what's causing this ... to my knowledge the .npmignore hasn't changed, nor has anything else. Any help from anyone else would be highly appreciated\n. [No build errors or anything, no](https://travis-ci.org/Ranks/emojify.js/). Seems like an issue with NPM or an `*ignore` file.\n. I believe it's all working now, really really sorry for the inconvenience\n. My pleasure, sorry it took so long\n. +1 will need to check this out, I didn't think it worked that way\n. Hi sorry, hadn't had a chance to review. Thanks! :+1: \n. Yeah definitely go for it! :smile: \n. Have you tried removing the `node_modules` folder and running `npm install` again?\n. Weird, I had the same error a while ago. Looks like `css-sprite` has been deprecated in favour of `sprity`, I think - that'll need to updated at some point too I imagine :/\n. Is this on the latest tagged release?\n. Bower automatically updates to the latest tagged release on Github.\n. Hi, could you do a PR on the `develop` branch? Thanks :+1: \n. Thanks very much :smile: !\n. I'm really sorry guys, if anyone can come up with a PR that'd be mighty helpful - I'm not sure any of the contributors have much spare time at the moment.\n. Could you make this PR target the `develop` branch, please? Thanks\n. I wrote this library back when browsers didn't - as such this library is outdated and in urgent need of some love.\n. It's not mine - its [here](https://github.com/Ranks/emojione), seems to have most of the options this has and then some.\n\nI just don't do a lot of frontend any more, haven't had the chance to give this the attention it needs and doubt I will be able to in the foreseeable future. It's had a nice long run, and I'm glad it's helped so many people, but I just don't have time any more to maintain this :(\n. No problem :)\n. Sorry that you had to deal with it, unfortunately I'm not really maintaining this library any more \ud83d\ude1e .

Once we've got the tests in, perhaps we should hook this library up to [Testling](http://ci.testling.com/) to test in multiple browsers?\n\n(As a minor side-node, personally I prefer Javascript tests as the library itself is Javascript not Coffeescript, but thats just my two cents!)  \n. Hi, this is in the project now, as of #26 \n. Thanks for the quick response @hassankhan and @qq99!\n\nThe html entities need to come out @qq99 - thanks for pointing that out.\n\nWith regards to Testling CI, all you need to do is setup a webhook from https://github.com/hassankhan/emojify.js/settings/hooks to http://git.testling.com. Leave all the other defaults as they are. \n\nAfter you've done a push, Testling CI will start running the tests. The results will be at\nhttps://ci.testling.com/hassankhan/emojify.js\n\nHope this helps.\n. Thanks for adding me as a collaborator Hassan, but for the moment I'm happy\nto so PRs as it means I get somebody to review my code.

Hey folks,\n\nSorry I've been so quiet. Been really busy. es5-shim is a great idea. If we wanted to reduce the dependencies, it would also be really simple to build our own shims, for example:\n\n```\nfunction arrayReduce(array, reductionFunction, initialValue) {\n  if(Array.prototype.reduce) return array.reduce(reductionFunction, initialValue);\n\n  var t = Object(this), len = t.length >>> 0, k = 0, value = initialValue;\n  for (; k < len; k++) {\n    value = callback(value, t[k], k, t);\n  }\n  return value;\n}\n```\n\nI guess it depends on how many people require IE8 support - if it's only a few, then perhaps using es5-shim would be the best option.\n. Ah cool! Glad you like it.. We've tested it a lot for our particular use-case (that being https://gitter.im) but obviously you'll want to make sure that it's still working for other cases \n\nThanks for the quick response, and thanks for a great library\n.

    "adam-lynch": "FYI I'm doing this\n. See #98\n. I can do the Grunt -> Gulp conversion. \n\n@hassankhan FYI, the links in your second comment there are broken.\n. Moving to Gulp needs to wait til #47 is merged I guess.\n. An even better table of emoji: http://emoji.codes/family\n. Grunt -> Gulp done; #85.\n\n@hassankhan would you be open to creating a Trello / waffle.io board for this repo? It would make it easier to complete all these tasks.\n. @hassankhan this looks good. Do you have a project for emojify.js on it? How do I access?\n. We should make a new release now. We have added some major features; full Node support, sprites, etc. There are no real outstanding or ongoing PRs so it'll be a long time before we get all of these features done for version 1.0. \n\n@hassankhan give me the go ahead and I'll publish to npm :smile: (and of course merge develop into master)\n. #57 is less important since everything is supported in Node now. It's less likely that someone will pass a HTML string to replace. I created it and I won't be using replace anymore probably. It should be fixed but not urgently.\n\nFor tidying up the config options, can you create an issue clearly defining what the config should be?\n\n> BTW, can you even submit to npm for me? I thought I had to update my npm packages myself :confused:\n\nYeah. See [node-webkit-builder](https://www.npmjs.org/package/node-webkit-builder) (I'm listed as a maintainer) for example. I think you need to run `npm owner add adam-lynch emojify.js`, see [npm-owner](https://www.npmjs.org/doc/cli/npm-owner.html).\n. How about a version 1.0 now? It's a shame those changes aren't out there.\n\nP.S. Did you add me as an owner to the npm package? :smiley: \n. ping\n. @hassankhan if you add me as an owner to the npm package then I can make the release.\n. :frowning: Ok, we think we will have to fork this and maintain it ourselves. This project moves far too slowly. It's very frustrating. We added big features as far back as October (which we need) which still aren't released. \n\nWe've been trying to work using the develop branch and it's not working out (one related issue: #114). We need versions to be published to npm. \n\nAlso, we want [Emoji One](http://emojione.com/) support so we think we'd have that done and released faster if we maintained our own project.\n. Wow, this _is_ great news! Also, would be handy since the Android's emoji [are licensed with the Apache 2 license](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tw-font/android/NOTICE). (Also see http://apps.timwhitlock.info/emoji/tables/unicode)\n. Ok, let's talk about this. I think another emoji set should be supported by way of another module. A different module for each set.\n\nThis way, each module is as lightweight as possible, has its own single bower.json, package.json, etc. to maintain. So if someone was to download it via bower for example, they'd only get the files needed for that set, the bower.json's `main` property would only point to the images for that set, and so on.\n\nWe could make an \"emojify-core\" module containing the main logic. All of these set-specific modules could then depend on this module and contain only set-specific code on top. \n\nBrowser builds could then be made with browserify / webpack (to mash everything into a single JS file). We might even be able to stick the build stuff into a common `emojify-core-dev` module to be shared.\n\nI personally want exactly everything that's there right now, but the result we'd get is emoji-one's emoji displayed on the screen.\n. Yeah I noticed afterwards. Maybe they should be more consistent.\n. I'm talking about stuff like `:)`. Maybe the readme and gh-pages should both contain all the features.\n. Looks good but I just noticed you don't have the suggested CSS that gh-pages has.\n. Yeah\n. Why LESS? I use LESS but I don't see why it should be LESS?\n\nPlus it's still in gh-pages and not the readme then. Also, won't it be confusing that there's a .css, .min.css and .less but they don't all do the same thing?\n. > Well, not exactly. It's just sample styling ... no-one has to use it. Once it's there I'll remove it from gh-pages.\n\nOk, maybe we just disagree on this. I think most users should use the content of this file and it should be as clear as possible.\n. It's ok if people don't want to use them, but for the typical use case (most people), they'd need it. Let's make it easy for them. Instead of making it easy for the 1% and having a hidden dependency for the 99%.\n. Definitely\n. I don't mind helping, but I'm not sure what way you want to go with it. I wonder could you use something like [cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio) so then you could even support things like ignoring certain element tag names, etc. even when using with node.\n. @qq99 No, see my first comment here. If I change that line, then yes I can use `.replace`.\n. That's basically what my line does. That would be fine and maybe should be done as a quick fix, but it might be worth considering providing all features to Node users via cheerio or something.\n. @hassankhan no prob\n. Ok, see above. I wonder is there a need for a separate set of tests for Node, since the existing tests are ran in the browser.\n. Done :smile: \n. Yeah, I won't be using data URIs. If you're not using them, then you definitely need to set the size to `1.5em` like the CSS on gh-pages does. Otherwise they're huge.\n\nIf someone is using main-bower-files like I am, then it just means they never manually have to figure out what files to use and reference x.js or y.css. Instead, main-bower-files just takes the \"main\" files from the package's bower.json. In this case, if you only use this package's main file, then the emoji aren't really usable (they're huge).\n. Ok cool then. The only thing is that the data-URI one being named `emofiy[.min].css` makes it seem like you need it.\n. This not just short emoji, it is _all_ emoji. Just discovered that.\n. Also, in case it's not obvious, this is a massive problem for markdown users; `hello` is converted to `<p>hello</p>` first.\n. Sure, I'll do that sometime today.\n. @hassankhan done\n. Don't merge yet. Gotta get `npm test` to reach into `node_modules` & call Grunt, instead of requiring grunt-cli to be installed.\n. Ok, this is ready for merging (still will fail unless #58 is merged though). \n\nNote: now grunt-cli needs to be installed globally to run the tests. There's no way to reach into `node_modules` like I said (which will work on all platforms). The Travis build will now install grunt-cli before running the tests.\n. That's because you merged the fix but I haven't pull that change down onto my fork's branch. Will do there in a minute. \n. Tada ^\n. Maybe it would if there wasn't merge conflict\n. The inliners out there are really not up to scratch. 99% of them depend on Juice which has fatal bugs on Windows. \n\nA lot of libraries that do stuff like this allow callbacks, etc. to modify the element / add classes, etc. See https://github.com/ichord/At.js/wiki/Callbacks, especially the last three. I don't have a use case for adding a class right now, but I think it's very likely that someone might one to add classes / other attributes.\n. I carried on reading through my notifications and already, I've found someone asking for a similar thing with another project; twitter/twitter-text-js#134. This library parses mentions (ie. @someones-name) and sticks them in anchor, etc.\n. I think we didn't go with that just because it's not Node. Also see https://github.com/Automattic/juice/pull/35#issuecomment-47364321 (and there are more issues with other ones). Even if the swig mailer one fixed it, then swig itself doesn't support Windows properly IMO. \n\nI think it comes down to this, any plugin that puts HTML on a page should allow users some control over those HTML elements. Usually it's done with callback hooks or something like that. I've needed to do it with almost every library I've used which injected HTML, for example: validators that inject validation messages, datepickers, etc. Sure my use case is for a `style` attribute, but another person might need a class, another a data attribute, etc. I don't see any good reason not to be support it. \n\nAs of right now, after the replacing, I use regex to grab the image's with the `emoji` class and stick on the `style` attribute but that isn't nice at all.\n. Oh @hassankhan, this is great if correct. These kind of things really need to be added to the readme & gh-pages though.\n. Good practice definitely. If I pass `dir/dir/` for example, you have logic that handlings that trailing slash, then I have to duplicate that logic in my replacer function and always make sure it's in sync with yours because I might only want to pass the custom replacer in some cases and reply on the default in others.\n. Also, maybe it should be passed an object as a parameter instead. There are already two parameters and we're saying it should have the base URL there now too. It's normally said not to go past three paramters. If it was an object, you could easily add more in the future without actually having to add an actual parameter to the method signature / API.\n. Ok, this is now much cleaner for my use case :smile:;\n\n``` coffeescript\n    renderEmoji: (text) =>\n        emojiReplacerArgs = [text]\n        emojiReplacerArgs.push @customEmojiReplacer if @inlineEmojiStyle\n\n        return emoji.replace.apply this, emojiReplacerArgs\n\n    customEmojiReplacer: (emoji, name) =>\n        return \"<img title='#{emoji}' alt='#{emoji}' class='emoji' src='#{@emojiBaseUrl}/#{name}.png' align='absmiddle' style='width:1.5em;height:1.5em;display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.25em;'/>\"\n```\n\n(CoffeeScript)\n. Don't forget to document that when a short emoji is matched (e.g. `:)`), that the arguments will be `:)` and `smile`, instead of `:smile:` and `smile`. \n\nBut really all three should be passed; the emoji found (`:)`), the name (`smile`) and the emoji (`:smile:`). Because of the inconsistency here, the replacer above now doesn't work; it needs to ignore the emoji parameter;\n\n``` coffeescript\ncustomEmojiReplacer: (emoji, name) =>\n        return \"<img title=':#{name}:' alt=':#{name}:' class='emoji' src='#{@emojiBaseUrl}/#{name}.png' align='absmiddle' style='width:1.5em;height:1.5em;display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.25em;'/>\"\n```\n. @4ver \n\n> The config would need to be a property of `this` though.\n\nIgnore those kind of details which are just specific to my example implementation. Like, my example also depends on `@inlineEmojiStyle` which is defined elsewhere.\n. > Having the image directory passed through can/maybe should be done, but as it currently stands you can retrieve it from defaultConfig anyway, right?\n\nCan you give an example?\n\nThe README looks good except you should probably mention that run can't be used in Node / only replace can be.\n. Maybe .replace deserves it's own proper section in the readme.\n. > ```\n> return emojify.defaultConfig.emojify_tag_type; // Will be whatever you set it to with `emojify.setConfig()`\n> ```\n\n`defaultConfig` is a misleading name then :/. \n\nAlso what if I don't pass an image base URL, will the default be in that property?\n. > If you don't pass an image base URL, the default is 'images/emoji', just like it says on the readme. \n\nYeah but it's not accessible via `defaultConfig` like anyone would assume, plus if it ever changed then any user's code assuming it's `images/emoji` would break. As @4ver said, \"I'd expect to be passed all of the variables needed to reproduce what the default replacer returns.\" That is just common practice. I feel like a lot of people would be confused using this library, things aren't obvious / as expected / like other libraries. \n\n---\n\nThe readme could still be better I think. It would help a lot in this respect.\n\n> Now type in an emoji keyword in your HTML, for example :smile: Now run emojify using emojify.run(). To exclude tags from being emojified, add no-emojify to their class attributes.\n> \n> You can optionally pass an object to emojify.run() to restrict the emojification to that object only: emojify.run(document.getElementById('my-element'))\n> \n> You can also use emojify.replace() method to emojify a string directly\n\nDocumenting methods in this way means someone has to read through big blocks of text to see what they need to do / use. Why not have a sections (with their own big headings) for:\n- How to add it to your project; script tag, bower, node\n- .setConfig\n- .run\n- .replace\n- Full usage example\n\nIt's important to clearly document each method's parameters and return values. What some projects do is generate some of their readme from code comments. I also think it's very important that the readme and gh-pages are very consistent; then if you change one, you should update the other too. Or, really simplify one (let's say gh-pages) to a small description (maybe with a live textarea example) and then link to the \"documentation\" (the readme).\n\n(Plus, clearly label what works on Node and what doesn't)\n. Better. How about something like this for parameters:\n\n### run([element])\n\n_This only works in the browser_\n\n#### Parameters\n- `element` - Optional HTML element to restrict the emojification to.\n. The difference between `###` and `####` isn't very obvious (like the method name & \"Parameters\") so maybe change that to one of the following:\n- `###` and `#####` /\n- `###` and `**heading**` \n- put a horizontal line (`---`) between each method.\n\nChange the first \"Usage\" heading to \"API\".

Sure, I'll put emojify.dev.js in there (I'll rename it back to emojify.js) and I'll put the images in there too. I'll also put those images in `/dist` too. I'm going to then do the spritesheets task and put the spritesheets in `/dist` as well.\n. Done\n. On second thought, both `.run` and `.replacer` should accept a replacer as the second param (like `.replacer`) because `.replace`'s replacer will be returning a string and `.run`'s will be returning a node.\n.

If a user wants something custom, then they can completely override stuff. Istead of using building in options for every little use case.\n. Ok, this is basically done. I've just to merge in changes, squash & rebase. Have a look at [my fork's README](https://github.com/adam-lynch/emojify.js/tree/spritesheets#api)\n. Ok, I just did the massive merge. I also fixed a big problem that if you used a custom replacer and added the emoji name as text of the new emoji element, then emojify would traverse that node too. So infinite loop. Luckily @4ver was in my office at the time :smile:.\n. ![](http://media.giphy.com/media/iFts0nvt3XDH2/giphy.gif)\n\nReady for merge \n. @hassankhan Merge?\n. Should [the node-only tests](https://github.com/4ver/emojify.js/blob/develop/tests/node/index.js) be gone now? Maybe we could just have all the tests in the `tests` directory, with `browser.html` and rename `browser.js` to `node.js`?\n. Also, you probably need to update CONTRIBUTING.md\n. Test structure looks good to me\n. Actually, this issue is wrong... those failing tests are specific to my PR. It's to do with config changes bleeding over into other tests.\n\n> Would it be best to make a new pr fixing those tests?\n\nYeah, probably.\n. @hassankhan see #108\n. Ready\n. :grinning: \n. Yes but a dependency could broken on Windows or our logic could be broken. \n\nFor example: https://github.com/aslansky/css-sprite/pull/29. They used `path.join` to join the base URL to the image filename but `path.join` uses the system's path separator so it was broken on Windows because the resultant path was `images\\spritesheet.png` or something like that.\n. It's very little work anyway to have our tests run in four more test environments; on Node 0.10 & 0.11, both on Windows 32-bit & 64-bit. So that's good :smile: \n. Cool thanks\n. :smile: \n. One thing to note here is that the tests ran with phantomjs don't show any output [when they all pass](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/adam-lynch/emojify-js/build/4/job/r9rgpep1hamdylah), but they do [when something goes wrong](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/adam-lynch/emojify-js/build/5/job/s6kvx17a5d244hgo) so that's ok. (Look at the end of the logs at those links)\n\nAlso, a dependency of css-sprite uses node-gyp (ugh) which breaks the builds on Node 0.11 for some reason but that's ok because failures are allowed for the latest versions; see https://github.com/hassankhan/emojify.js/blob/develop/appveyor.yml#L7.\n. Related: #51 #57 \n. #57 was just a test. That PR was closed. I'm not sure if a test and fix was added in a different commit, or if nothing was done.\n. Wouldn't it be better to have an organization account then? :smile: \n\nWhat does this mean for the roadmap though? For example, the plan to support multiple emoji sets. I'm happy if only EmojiOne was supported because we planned to move to it anyway, but it would be good to know what the plan is.\n. I didn't\n. @kevinranks yep, thanks\n. @hassankhan Is it ok to make a new release?\n. Yep\n. I had the latest on `develop`\n. Looks good to me\n. @RRorg as far as I know, you're correct.\n. (But a lot of apps use them, they're not protecting them. If they were to start, I'm sure they'd start with the big companies first \ud83d\ude04 )\n. I still use this in production. Eventually I / my team will put some effort to help unite these projects. I mean we'd eventually like our users to be able to switch between emoji sets (based on the same set of emoji keywords), etc.\n. FYI I'm doing this\n. See #98\n. I can do the Grunt -> Gulp conversion. \n\n@hassankhan FYI, the links in your second comment there are broken.\n. Moving to Gulp needs to wait til #47 is merged I guess.\n. An even better table of emoji: http://emoji.codes/family\n. Grunt -> Gulp done; #85.\n\n@hassankhan would you be open to creating a Trello / waffle.io board for this repo? It would make it easier to complete all these tasks.\n. @hassankhan this looks good. Do you have a project for emojify.js on it? How do I access?\n. We should make a new release now. We have added some major features; full Node support, sprites, etc. There are no real outstanding or ongoing PRs so it'll be a long time before we get all of these features done for version 1.0. \n\n@hassankhan give me the go ahead and I'll publish to npm :smile: (and of course merge develop into master)\n. #57 is less important since everything is supported in Node now. It's less likely that someone will pass a HTML string to replace. I created it and I won't be using replace anymore probably. It should be fixed but not urgently.\n\nFor tidying up the config options, can you create an issue clearly defining what the config should be?\n\n> BTW, can you even submit to npm for me? I thought I had to update my npm packages myself :confused:\n\nYeah. See [node-webkit-builder](https://www.npmjs.org/package/node-webkit-builder) (I'm listed as a maintainer) for example. I think you need to run `npm owner add adam-lynch emojify.js`, see [npm-owner](https://www.npmjs.org/doc/cli/npm-owner.html).\n. How about a version 1.0 now? It's a shame those changes aren't out there.\n\nP.S. Did you add me as an owner to the npm package? :smiley: \n. ping\n. @hassankhan if you add me as an owner to the npm package then I can make the release.\n. :frowning: Ok, we think we will have to fork this and maintain it ourselves. This project moves far too slowly. It's very frustrating. We added big features as far back as October (which we need) which still aren't released. \n\nWe've been trying to work using the develop branch and it's not working out (one related issue: #114). We need versions to be published to npm. \n\nAlso, we want [Emoji One](http://emojione.com/) support so we think we'd have that done and released faster if we maintained our own project.\n. Wow, this _is_ great news! Also, would be handy since the Android's emoji [are licensed with the Apache 2 license](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tw-font/android/NOTICE). (Also see http://apps.timwhitlock.info/emoji/tables/unicode)\n. Ok, let's talk about this. I think another emoji set should be supported by way of another module. A different module for each set.\n\nThis way, each module is as lightweight as possible, has its own single bower.json, package.json, etc. to maintain. So if someone was to download it via bower for example, they'd only get the files needed for that set, the bower.json's `main` property would only point to the images for that set, and so on.\n\nWe could make an \"emojify-core\" module containing the main logic. All of these set-specific modules could then depend on this module and contain only set-specific code on top. \n\nBrowser builds could then be made with browserify / webpack (to mash everything into a single JS file). We might even be able to stick the build stuff into a common `emojify-core-dev` module to be shared.\n\nI personally want exactly everything that's there right now, but the result we'd get is emoji-one's emoji displayed on the screen.\n. Yeah I noticed afterwards. Maybe they should be more consistent.\n. I'm talking about stuff like `:)`. Maybe the readme and gh-pages should both contain all the features.\n. Looks good but I just noticed you don't have the suggested CSS that gh-pages has.\n. Yeah\n. Why LESS? I use LESS but I don't see why it should be LESS?\n\nPlus it's still in gh-pages and not the readme then. Also, won't it be confusing that there's a .css, .min.css and .less but they don't all do the same thing?\n. > Well, not exactly. It's just sample styling ... no-one has to use it. Once it's there I'll remove it from gh-pages.\n\nOk, maybe we just disagree on this. I think most users should use the content of this file and it should be as clear as possible.\n. It's ok if people don't want to use them, but for the typical use case (most people), they'd need it. Let's make it easy for them. Instead of making it easy for the 1% and having a hidden dependency for the 99%.\n. Definitely\n. I don't mind helping, but I'm not sure what way you want to go with it. I wonder could you use something like [cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio) so then you could even support things like ignoring certain element tag names, etc. even when using with node.\n. @qq99 No, see my first comment here. If I change that line, then yes I can use `.replace`.\n. That's basically what my line does. That would be fine and maybe should be done as a quick fix, but it might be worth considering providing all features to Node users via cheerio or something.\n. @hassankhan no prob\n. Ok, see above. I wonder is there a need for a separate set of tests for Node, since the existing tests are ran in the browser.\n. Done :smile: \n. Yeah, I won't be using data URIs. If you're not using them, then you definitely need to set the size to `1.5em` like the CSS on gh-pages does. Otherwise they're huge.\n\nIf someone is using main-bower-files like I am, then it just means they never manually have to figure out what files to use and reference x.js or y.css. Instead, main-bower-files just takes the \"main\" files from the package's bower.json. In this case, if you only use this package's main file, then the emoji aren't really usable (they're huge).\n. Ok cool then. The only thing is that the data-URI one being named `emofiy[.min].css` makes it seem like you need it.\n. This not just short emoji, it is _all_ emoji. Just discovered that.\n. Also, in case it's not obvious, this is a massive problem for markdown users; `hello` is converted to `<p>hello</p>` first.\n. Sure, I'll do that sometime today.\n. @hassankhan done\n. Don't merge yet. Gotta get `npm test` to reach into `node_modules` & call Grunt, instead of requiring grunt-cli to be installed.\n. Ok, this is ready for merging (still will fail unless #58 is merged though). \n\nNote: now grunt-cli needs to be installed globally to run the tests. There's no way to reach into `node_modules` like I said (which will work on all platforms). The Travis build will now install grunt-cli before running the tests.\n. That's because you merged the fix but I haven't pull that change down onto my fork's branch. Will do there in a minute. \n. Tada ^\n. Maybe it would if there wasn't merge conflict\n. The inliners out there are really not up to scratch. 99% of them depend on Juice which has fatal bugs on Windows. \n\nA lot of libraries that do stuff like this allow callbacks, etc. to modify the element / add classes, etc. See https://github.com/ichord/At.js/wiki/Callbacks, especially the last three. I don't have a use case for adding a class right now, but I think it's very likely that someone might one to add classes / other attributes.\n. I carried on reading through my notifications and already, I've found someone asking for a similar thing with another project; twitter/twitter-text-js#134. This library parses mentions (ie. @someones-name) and sticks them in anchor, etc.\n. I think we didn't go with that just because it's not Node. Also see https://github.com/Automattic/juice/pull/35#issuecomment-47364321 (and there are more issues with other ones). Even if the swig mailer one fixed it, then swig itself doesn't support Windows properly IMO. \n\nI think it comes down to this, any plugin that puts HTML on a page should allow users some control over those HTML elements. Usually it's done with callback hooks or something like that. I've needed to do it with almost every library I've used which injected HTML, for example: validators that inject validation messages, datepickers, etc. Sure my use case is for a `style` attribute, but another person might need a class, another a data attribute, etc. I don't see any good reason not to be support it. \n\nAs of right now, after the replacing, I use regex to grab the image's with the `emoji` class and stick on the `style` attribute but that isn't nice at all.\n. Oh @hassankhan, this is great if correct. These kind of things really need to be added to the readme & gh-pages though.\n. Good practice definitely. If I pass `dir/dir/` for example, you have logic that handlings that trailing slash, then I have to duplicate that logic in my replacer function and always make sure it's in sync with yours because I might only want to pass the custom replacer in some cases and reply on the default in others.\n. Also, maybe it should be passed an object as a parameter instead. There are already two parameters and we're saying it should have the base URL there now too. It's normally said not to go past three paramters. If it was an object, you could easily add more in the future without actually having to add an actual parameter to the method signature / API.\n. Ok, this is now much cleaner for my use case :smile:;\n\n``` coffeescript\n    renderEmoji: (text) =>\n        emojiReplacerArgs = [text]\n        emojiReplacerArgs.push @customEmojiReplacer if @inlineEmojiStyle\n\n        return emoji.replace.apply this, emojiReplacerArgs\n\n    customEmojiReplacer: (emoji, name) =>\n        return \"<img title='#{emoji}' alt='#{emoji}' class='emoji' src='#{@emojiBaseUrl}/#{name}.png' align='absmiddle' style='width:1.5em;height:1.5em;display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.25em;'/>\"\n```\n\n(CoffeeScript)\n. Don't forget to document that when a short emoji is matched (e.g. `:)`), that the arguments will be `:)` and `smile`, instead of `:smile:` and `smile`. \n\nBut really all three should be passed; the emoji found (`:)`), the name (`smile`) and the emoji (`:smile:`). Because of the inconsistency here, the replacer above now doesn't work; it needs to ignore the emoji parameter;\n\n``` coffeescript\ncustomEmojiReplacer: (emoji, name) =>\n        return \"<img title=':#{name}:' alt=':#{name}:' class='emoji' src='#{@emojiBaseUrl}/#{name}.png' align='absmiddle' style='width:1.5em;height:1.5em;display:inline-block;margin-bottom:-0.25em;'/>\"\n```\n. @4ver \n\n> The config would need to be a property of `this` though.\n\nIgnore those kind of details which are just specific to my example implementation. Like, my example also depends on `@inlineEmojiStyle` which is defined elsewhere.\n. > Having the image directory passed through can/maybe should be done, but as it currently stands you can retrieve it from defaultConfig anyway, right?\n\nCan you give an example?\n\nThe README looks good except you should probably mention that run can't be used in Node / only replace can be.\n. Maybe .replace deserves it's own proper section in the readme.\n. > ```\n> return emojify.defaultConfig.emojify_tag_type; // Will be whatever you set it to with `emojify.setConfig()`\n> ```\n\n`defaultConfig` is a misleading name then :/. \n\nAlso what if I don't pass an image base URL, will the default be in that property?\n. > If you don't pass an image base URL, the default is 'images/emoji', just like it says on the readme. \n\nYeah but it's not accessible via `defaultConfig` like anyone would assume, plus if it ever changed then any user's code assuming it's `images/emoji` would break. As @4ver said, \"I'd expect to be passed all of the variables needed to reproduce what the default replacer returns.\" That is just common practice. I feel like a lot of people would be confused using this library, things aren't obvious / as expected / like other libraries. \n\n---\n\nThe readme could still be better I think. It would help a lot in this respect.\n\n> Now type in an emoji keyword in your HTML, for example :smile: Now run emojify using emojify.run(). To exclude tags from being emojified, add no-emojify to their class attributes.\n> \n> You can optionally pass an object to emojify.run() to restrict the emojification to that object only: emojify.run(document.getElementById('my-element'))\n> \n> You can also use emojify.replace() method to emojify a string directly\n\nDocumenting methods in this way means someone has to read through big blocks of text to see what they need to do / use. Why not have a sections (with their own big headings) for:\n- How to add it to your project; script tag, bower, node\n- .setConfig\n- .run\n- .replace\n- Full usage example\n\nIt's important to clearly document each method's parameters and return values. What some projects do is generate some of their readme from code comments. I also think it's very important that the readme and gh-pages are very consistent; then if you change one, you should update the other too. Or, really simplify one (let's say gh-pages) to a small description (maybe with a live textarea example) and then link to the \"documentation\" (the readme).\n\n(Plus, clearly label what works on Node and what doesn't)\n. Better. How about something like this for parameters:\n\n### run([element])\n\n_This only works in the browser_\n\n#### Parameters\n- `element` - Optional HTML element to restrict the emojification to.\n. The difference between `###` and `####` isn't very obvious (like the method name & \"Parameters\") so maybe change that to one of the following:\n- `###` and `#####` /\n- `###` and `**heading**` \n- put a horizontal line (`---`) between each method.\n\nChange the first \"Usage\" heading to \"API\". Makes more sense to me, plus it's confusing since you have a \"usage\" section inside each method too anyway.\n\nSmall thing: npm should be lowercase. I saw they said it one of their docs once.\n\n---\n\nI just saw this now:\n\n> To exclude tags from being emojified, add no-emojify to their class attributes.\n\nI so wish I could do this in Node! :smile: \n. @hassankhan?

It's very little work anyway to have our tests run in four more test environments; on Node 0.10 & 0.11, both on Windows 32-bit & 64-bit. So that's good :smile: \n. Cool thanks\n. :smile: \n. One thing to note here is that the tests ran with phantomjs don't show any output [when they all pass](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/adam-lynch/emojify-js/build/4/job/r9rgpep1hamdylah), but they do [when something goes wrong](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/adam-lynch/emojify-js/build/5/job/s6kvx17a5d244hgo) so that's ok. (Look at the end of the logs at those links)\n\nAlso, a dependency of css-sprite uses node-gyp (ugh) which breaks the builds on Node 0.11 for some reason but that's ok because failures are allowed for the latest versions; see https://github.com/hassankhan/emojify.js/blob/develop/appveyor.yml#L7.\n. Related: #51 #57 \n. #57 was just a test. That PR was closed. I'm not sure if a test and fix was added in a different commit, or if nothing was done.\n. Wouldn't it be better to have an organization account then? :smile: \n\nWhat does this mean for the roadmap though? For example, the plan to support multiple emoji sets. I'm happy if only EmojiOne was supported because we planned to move to it anyway, but it would be good to know what the plan is.\n. I didn't\n. @kevinranks yep, thanks\n. @hassankhan Is it ok to make a new release?\n. Yep\n. I had the latest on `develop`\n. Looks good to me\n. @RRorg as far as I know, you're correct.\n. (But a lot of apps use them, they're not protecting them. If they were to start, I'm sure they'd start with the big companies first \ud83d\ude04 )\n. I still use this in production. Eventually I / my team will put some effort to help unite these projects. I mean we'd eventually like our users to be able to switch between emoji sets (based on the same set of emoji keywords), etc.\n. ",
