The sample code you're showing here returns a random size, and thus a different size every time the `prefferedSizeForItemAtIndexPath` method is called. The `prefferedSizeForItemAtIndexPath` is called multiple times throughout the layout process and expects a consistent size to be returned for each index path.\n\nIf you want to test with random sizes you should store them in an array and implement the delegate method like this\n\n``` objective-c\nreturn [[self.sizes objectAtIndex:indexPath.item] CGSizeValue];\n```\n\nAlso make sure to set the contentMode on the cell's image view to aspect fill in this case.\n. I've replicated your example with this code and it works perfectly:\n\n```\n- (id)initWithCoder:(NSCoder *)aDecoder\n{\n    self = [super initWithCoder:aDecoder];\n    if (self) {\n\n        _sizes = [NSMutableArray array];\n\n        NSMutableArray *images = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];\n        for (int i = 1; i <= NUMBER_OF_IMAGES; i++) {\n            NSString *imageName = [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"photo-%02d.jpg\", i];\n            UIImage *image = [UIImage imageNamed:imageName];\n            [images addObject:image];\n\n            CGSize size = [image size];\n            size.width += arc4random()%2000;\n            size.height += arc4random()%2000;\n            [_sizes addObject:[NSValue valueWithCGSize:size]];\n        }\n        _images = [images copy];\n    }\n\n    return self;\n}\n\n#pragma mark - UICollectionViewFlowLayoutDelegate\n\n- (CGSize)collectionView:(UICollectionView *)collectionView layout:(NHBalancedFlowLayout *)collectionViewLayout preferredSizeForItemAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath\n{\n    return [[self.sizes objectAtIndex:indexPath.item] CGSizeValue];\n}\n```\n. Thanks for reporting this. Would you mind posting the values for `sequence` and `numberOfPartitions` at the time it crashes, so I can reproduce the issue by calling the method with these values?\n. On line 20 of `NHLinearPartition.m` I've changed `if (k > n)` to `if (k >= n)`. This should solve the problem. I've also added the following unit test to see if it worked:\n\n```\n- (void)testNumberOfPartitionsEqualToSequenceCount\n{\n    NSArray *sequence = @[@346, @146, @125];\n    NSInteger numberOfPartitions = 3;\n\n    NSArray *partition = [NHLinearPartition linearPartitionForSequence:sequence numberOfPartitions:numberOfPartitions];\n    XCTAssertNotNil(partition, @\"should return valid partition\");\n}\n```\n\nLet me know if this solves your problem.\n. I've updated the podspec file. If you would create a PR for the cocoapods repo that would be great.\n. Thanks!\n. I spent some time researching it this morning, but I haven't figured out the flaw in the implementation of the algorithm yet. I'm planning to look into it further once I have more time. If adding the break works for you then I suggest going with that for now.\n. I've finally had some time to dig into this issue, and I'm quite sure this issue is fixed now. The latest version is 0.1.2.\nPlease let me know if this solved your issue.\n. Thanks for doing the research on this. I was expecting this could be a problem with larger data sets, but I had not tested this yet.\n\nYou're probably right that using a pure C implementation for the algorithm would increase performance dramatically. I don't have a lot of experience writing C code myself, so I might not get around to doing something about this for a while. If you are able to write a better/faster implementation of the algorithm, please issue a pull request, and I'll merge it back in.\n. Every time you do a reload on the collection view it needs to recalculate the positioning information for all the cells. That's probably what's causing the lag. Do you know the sizes of the images before you download them? Because then you wouldn't have to reload the cells.\n. When an operation completes you could ask the collection view for the corresponding cell by calling `cellForItemAtIndexPath`, and then set the image directly, without reloading the cell.\n. The main performance issues should be fixed in: 817a6ab\n. That's not on my to do list right now, but feel free to add it and issue a pull request. It would be a great feature to have.\n. This works the same as it would with any implementation of UICollectionView. Please refer to the UICollectionView documentation.\n. Sorry it that it took me a while to merge this. I was on holiday.\n\nThanks for implementing this header and footer support. It looks great! The only thing I changed is that the header and footer views are stretched to fit the size of the collection view, as this is the behavior in UICollectionViewFlowLayout. See the documentation for `headerReferenceSize`:\n\n> During layout, only the size that corresponds to the appropriate scrolling direction is used. For example, for the vertical scrolling direction, the layout object uses the height value returned by your method. (In that instance, the width of the header would be set to the width of the collection view.) If the size in the appropriate scrolling dimension is 0, no header is added.\n. I haven't had the time to look into this yet, but it might be related to this issue: #16.\n. Great stuff @lickylick!\n. Thanks! I missed that.\n. I'm not sure I understand what you are trying to achieve. Could you explain what the end result should look like?\n. Thanks for the explanation. I don't think it will cause any problems if you change the superclass to be `UICollectionViewFlowLayout`, although I can't make any promises.\n\nThe main issue however would seem to be how you would handle resizing of the cells when reordering. Are you planning to recalculate the layout every time the selected cell is dragged to a different position?\n. I think it is possible, but I'm not sure how I would implement it. Normally when you reorder items, the items are of the same size, so you don't have to do any resizing. This situation will be a bit trickier to solve, especially if you want to make it look natural. Let me know if you've figured it out though! I would love to see your solution.\n. The reason for not subclassing `UICollectionViewFlowLayout` is that it currently does not support all the delegate methods defined in `UICollectionViewDelegateFlowLayout`, so that might be confusing.\n\nLet me know if you can find the origin of the crash, then maybe I could fix it.\n. Thanks for the pull request. If you undo changing the super class to `UICollectionViewFlowLayout` and explain how you're solving the crash I would be happy to merge it back.\n. Fixed in #16 \n. Thanks for the fix, and apologies for the delay in merging it back.\n. This seems to undo a lot of the optimizations made here: #9. Have you tested the performance against the latest version?\n. Yeah try that. Those modifications have dramatically improved performance already.\n. Thanks for pointing that out. Fixed now: b877f1c27acccafe767b44897d00535bef967fdc\n. Thanks for issuing a pull request. I would need to look at this a bit more thoroughly before merging it back, because right now the entire layout would be invalidated many times during scrolling, and I think that will adversely affect performance.\n. The behavior of the layout mechanism is that it always tries to fill the available space. The issue with implementing a maximumRowHeight is that it would break the layout mechanism's ability to do that.\n\nCan you explain the kind of behavior that you would expect? Is this only an issue when displaying one or two items?\n. Thanks for the explanation. I'm not sure that this component offers the functionality that you're looking for. You might want to try and write your own custom collection view layout. This article offers a good starting point: http://www.objc.io/issue-3/collection-view-layouts.html\n. Are you adding every new batch of items to a different section, or are all the images in the same section. The layout is calculated per section, so adding a new section should allow the previous section to remain unchanged. Although I'm not sure if it would redo the calculation for the previous sections as well.\n. That's right. The implementation of the layout algorithm is such that it tries to determine the best possible layout based on every image in a section, so every time you add a new image it is likely to affect the layout. \n. As a quick workaround I would suggest using larger thumbnails, so that there is a bit of room for error. In terms of a more solid solution, I'm not sure what it would take to achieve that at this moment. This would require some changes to the logic of the layout algorithm. I would be happy to do some consulting for you if you'd like me to help you figure it out. Otherwise feel free to fork the project and contribute.\n. @thelordy Please create an issue in @graetzer's fork to discuss this issue.\n. Have you been able to pinpoint the line of code that causes the crash?\n. Hi Steven, I think adding support for supplementary views is a good idea. For me this is currently not a priority to work on, but feel free to take a shot at it and issue a pull request.\n. The layout object is created as part of the storyboard. You can drag in a collection view layout object in interface builder, and change the class to be `NHBalancedFlowLayout`. \n. I'm running the demo with XCode 6 GM and it looks fine. Did you make any changes to the demo project?\n. ![screen shot 2014-09-15 at 10 05 52](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1107150/4268459/20c82e26-3caf-11e4-8350-693b6ac2b503.png)\n. Yes I see the problem occur now. Doing a bit of digging, trying to figure out what is going on.\n. So far it looks like this is some kind of auto layout issue. The layout is correct, but the image views within the cells are not given the correct size\n. For some reason the contentView is not layed out correctly. I've found a workaround that seems to work for now. Just add these lines in ImageCell.m\n\n```\n- (void)layoutSubviews\n{\n    [super layoutSubviews];    \n    self.contentView.frame = self.bounds;\n}\n```\n. It's better not to override setBounds directly, but instead use layoutSubviews. Layoutsubviews will only be triggered when actually necessary.\n. Looks like the same issue as this one: https://github.com/njdehoog/NHBalancedFlowLayout/issues/27\n. No worries. Glad you solved it\n. Please be a little bit more specific about the problem you're running into. What is the expected behavior and what are you seeing? Does your app work with a regular flow layout?\n. Glad you were able to solve it!\n. That is currently outside the scope of this project. You might try looking at a solution like this: https://github.com/kaishin/ImageScout\n. Well it _can_ work, but to calculate the layout you'll need to know the image sizes in advance.\n. @cooler333 As mentioned in the README, this project is no longer maintained. Please check out https://github.com/graetzer/NHBalancedFlowLayout for a more up-to-date version.\n. @graetzer Thanks for your PR. I am no longer maintaining this project. Would you mind if I just point people to your fork in the README?\n. Honestly it's been too long since I looked at this code, and I don't have the time to maintain it at the moment. I updated the REAME. Thanks again.\n. Thanks!\n\nCurrently the only way to control the size is by setting the preferredRowSize property, although this doesn't enforce a maximum size.\n\nEnforcing a maximum size would be useful, although I'm not sure how to accomplish this yet.
