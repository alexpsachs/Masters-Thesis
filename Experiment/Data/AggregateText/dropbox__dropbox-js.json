    "pwnall": "Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Sorry, I forgot to say thanks for this one! I merged the XHR support, but took out the Node.JS support, because it relies on patches to XHR. I'm torn between patching XHR to accept Buffers, and preparing a bigger patch that implements wrappers for ArrayBuffer and Blob. Any thoughts?\n. Thank you very much for reporting this bug!\n\nCalling the app secret a \"secret\" is an unfortunate side-effect of using OAuth 1.0. The \"secret\" isn't really secret in applications that must client-side, such as mobile apps, desktop apps, and JavaScript apps without backends.\n\nThe Dropbox authentication model doesn't assume that the secret is actually secret. The user must approve every request to `/oauth/authorize`, which is different from Facebook's OAuth 2.0 model.\n\nIn the future, I hope there will be better messaging around the API key and \"secret\". Until then, please write awesome JavaScript apps!\n\nLast but not least, if there are any authentication improvements in the REST API, and I'm not on top of them, please file a bug!\n. After a conversation with Dropboxers on the API team, we decided to add support to `dropbox.js` for concealing the API key and secret, and to require that browser-side applications use this method (or any other method) to conceal their API credentials before applying for production status.\n\nThe details are [here](https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/doc/getting_started.md#browser-and-open-source-applications).\n\nI tried to make the process as painless as possible. Please file a bug if you think of a way to further streamline this.\n. @adnandoric Can you contact me over e-mail to discuss the timeline for your application? We'll have something out this week that addresses your concerns :)\n. @adnandoric Right now, my previous comment still stands. If you need to build and publish an application in the next couple of days, follow the process documented in [the \"here\" link above](https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/doc/getting_started.md#browser-and-open-source-applications). Applications following this process have been approved for production.\n\nThere should be an announcement later this week that makes all that process obsolete, though.\n. @adnandoric That is not what I said.\n\nFirst off, you should never expose your API key and secret in plaintext in an application. You should make some decent effort to obfuscate it, so a casual attacker can't lift the API key and secret and impersonate your application. dropbox.js has build-in obfuscation support, and the link above documents setting it up.\n\nSecond, this isn't a perfect solution. It is the best we can do for applications that need to run the OAuth flow client-side. If you're worried about security, you should use dropbox.js in node.js or another server environment, so credentials aren't exposed to clients.\n\nWe'll have a better client-side story really, really soon.\n. For anyone seeing this issue: dropbox.js 0.10 and above use OAuth 2. In OAuth 2, web apps use the API key, and do not use the API secret. So, obfuscating is no longer necessary.\n. Thank you for reporting this bug, and I'm really sorry for the trouble! There was a typo in the documentation. `Driver` should be `Drivers`.\n\nOnce again, thanks so much for reporting the bug!\n. That is very good feedback, thank you very much!\n\nIndeed, `showError` and `doSomethingCool` are not defined in the sample snippets. They are placeholders for your code. I add comments to make this clearer.\n\nThe [checkbox.js sample application](https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/tree/master/samples/checkbox.js) might be helpful to look at. Its `showError` function shows a div that tells the users something went wrong and asks them to refresh the page, and I think it's a pretty reasonable strategy, at least at the prototype stage.\n\nIt is my hope that `authenticate` in `Dropbox.Client` will take care of all your OAuth needs, and you won't need to learn the specifics of OAuth to write a Dropbox application. What problems are you having with `authenticate`?\n. No idea how the garbled comment got there, sorry. In any case, you can use [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Storage) to store your user's credentials.\n\nThe `credentials` method in `Dropbox.Client` will give you a JSON-compliant object that you can save into localStorage using something like `localStorage.setItem('dropbox_auth', JSON.stringify(client.credentials()))`. Later, pass this object to the `Dropbox.Client` constructor to pick up from where you left, using something along the lines of `new Dropbox.Client(JSON.parse(localStorge.getItem('dropbox_auth')))`.\n\nAs a warning, once you do that, you have to come up with a strategy for dealing with expired tokens. That's the main reason why the sample apps don't store user tokens -- I didn't want the expiration logic code to get readers confused.\n. I think tokens are supposed to be permanent, at the moment.\n\nHowever, based the evolution of the Facebook API, I would expect that eventually tokens will expire in 14 days, or in 30 days.\n\nMy tokens expired twice while I was building dropbox.js. The expiration might have been caused by my other development work, but I'd still want my apps to consider this case.\n. Did you call `client.authDriver` to set up an OAuth driver?\n. The credentials should not contain `authState`. The object returned by `credentials()` only has the `authState` property set during the authentication process. After the authentication succeeds, the `credentials()` object should have the following properties: `key`, `secret`, `sandbox`, `token`, `tokenSecret` and `uid`.\n\nThis test backs up what I just said.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/test/src/client_test.coffee#L619\n. Also, if you use the `rememberUser` option for the `Dropbox.Drivers.Redirect` driver in dropbox.js 0.6.0, you can call `authenticate` on every page, and the user won't see confirmation dialogs, since `localStorage` is shared by pages with the same origin. I hope this helps.\n. You need to set the OAuth driver every time you build a Dropbox.Client instance. You'll probably need to have this code on all your pages that use the Dropbox API.\n\n``` javascript\nvar client = new Dropbox.Client({key: \"your-app-key\", secret: \"your-app-secret\", sandbox: true});\nclient.authDriver(new Dropbox.Drivers.Redirect({rememberUser: true}));\n```\n. Hey, guys!\n\nSorry, having to authorize every time is a pain indeed. Most of the reasons why the drivers don't store the OAuth tokens for you are historical (solved bugs), but there is one real issue left -- if you store the OAuth tokens, the user isn't \"logged out\" of your application when they log out of Dropbox.\n\nAs a workaround until I figure out a better way of logging out, set the `rememberUser: true` option when instantiating the `Dropbox.Driver.Redirect` OAuth driver.\n\n``` javascript\nclient.authDriver(new Dropbox.Drivers.Redirect({rememberUser: true}));\n```\n\nThis should do the trick in development. If you really want to push this to real users, at the very least have a \"Sign out\" button somewhere, and call `forgetCredentials()` on the OAuth driver.\n. Sorry, I forgot to mention, you'll need to build `dropbox.js` off of GitHub to use `rememberUser`.\n. Made a couple of improvements.\n- the \"Sign out\" implementation should call `signOut` on the `Dropbox.Client`, instead of calling some obscure method on the OAuth driver.\n- the `checkbox.js` sample app in the repository has been updated to use `rememberUser`, and has a \"Sign out\" implementation\n- there is some documentation for [writing OAuth drivers](https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/doc/auth_drivers.md)\n- everything will be available in dropbox.js 0.6.0, which should hit up `cdnjs` pretty soon\n. Thank you for reporting the bug, @lmorchard! Please let me know if you run into any other roadblock that dropbox.js should be handling for you.\n. Thank you very much for the patch!\n. Thank you for your patch, @hinathan!\n. This fix was included in `dropbox.js` version 0.6.1.\n. Good point, @xMartin! Thanks for the bug report!\n\nThis should be fixed on master, and will make it to the next point release.\n. Thanks for the patch, @thedjpetersen!\n\nActually, the <script> URL is what cdnjs.org recommends. I added a note to getting_started.md explaining that. Sorry for the confusion, and thank you for pointing that out!\n. What is a session for you? Do you mean the authentication state? (OAuth token)\n. If your JavaScript is running in the browser, the Redirect driver can persist your authentication information.\n\nThis section will help.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/doc/auth_drivers.md#dropboxdriversredirect\n\nIf you're writing a node.js app, you're pretty much on your own right now. `Dropbox.Client#credentials()` returns the authentication information as a JSON-compliant object. You can pass it to the `Dropbox.Client` constructor to get a new client configured to use the same OAuth token.\n\nUnfortunately, I have very little node.js experience, and I don't know how I can better support node.js apps. Patches or guidance would be welcome!\n. Sorry for your inconvenience, and thank you for reporting this issue!\n\nI fixed the URL, dropbox-js builds from 0.6.2 onwards will have the right URL.\n. @Crome thank you very much for the bug report and for the fix!\n\nI'll start preparing a patch. Please send a pull request, or message me a name (and optionally an e-mail address) if you'd like credit for the fix.\n. This bug was fixed in the 0.6.3 release.\n\nThank you very much for reporting! I don't test on IE as often as it should, and I'm really grateful that you made me aware of this show-stopping IE issue.\n. @martinklein Sorry, the documentation must be confusing. I'll try to explain. If my explanation makes sense, please consider sending a pull request with a documentation fix.\n\nThere are two types of files in your application, the source code, and the application data.\n\nThe _source code_ lives in `Apps/Static Web Apps/DVD Library` in _your_ Dropbox, and is publicly available at the URL generated by the [Static Web Apps console](https://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/pjlfdak1tmznswp/powered_by.js/public/index.html). You can think of this location as a file server. For example, this is where you should put the HTML, CSS, JavaScript and images behind your application.\n\nThe _application data_ lives in `Apps/DVD Library` in _each of your users'_ Dropboxes. This is the area that you can access via `readFile` and `writeFile` calls. The tricky concept here is that each user's data is stored in their Dropbox, so you can only see your own data. On the bright side, you can get security for free, as long as you don't store your users' credentials in a central place.\n\nDoes this help?\n. I haven't heard from you in a while, so I hope all is going well. I look forward to seeing your app!\n. The OAuth implementation in the Dropbox API requires the API key and API secret for making API calls. So `Dropbox.Client` needs the `key` parameter. It could definitely throw a more descriptive error message though, I'll see what I can do about that.\n. I just pushed a commit that should make this situation easier to debug in the future. I hope it helps!\n. The text in the dropbox API documentation is a bit unfortunate, but its meaning is that once you have an access token, you don't need to obtain a request token, authenticate it, and exchange it for the access token.\n\nThe [REST API reference](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/api), which documents the HTTP protocol that all the other SDKs are built on top of, says \"Dropbox uses OAuth to authenticate all API requests.\"\n\nThe [OAuth 1.0a example](http://oauth.net/core/1.0a/#anchor46) shows that the API key needs to be passed in as the `oauth_consumer_key` parameter, and the API secret is used to compute the `oauth_signature` field.\n\nLast, the [example](http://www.springframework.net/social-dropbox/refdoc/api.html) provided as an API reference by the library that you mentioned seems to contradict your claims that it doesn't need an API key / secret. The `serviceProvider` variable holds an instance of `DropboxServiceProvider`, whose constructor takes in an API key and secret. The library seems to require a `IDropbox` instance to make actual API calls, and the provided example uses a call on `serviceProvider` to get an `IDropbox` instance. So the `IDropbox` instance does get the API key and secret.\n\nI hope this helps!\n. @tylerwsy yes. You can pass the `token` and `tokenSecret` options to the `Dropbox.Client` constructor.\n\nYou can pass your API key and secret into the `key` and `secret` constructor options, but your production access might get revoked for passing your key around without obfuscation. To get past that, you should combine the key and secret as described in [the Getting Started guide](https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/doc/getting_started.md#browser-and-open-source-applications).\n\nDoes this help?\n. @tylerwsy you don't need to call `authenticate()`, the client is authenticated.\n\nOne minor potential issue: Dropbox provides a user ID after authentication, which can be obtained by calling `dropboxUid()` on client. If you rely on that functionality, you should also pass the uid down from the server, and supply it as the `uid` option to the `Drobpox.Client` constructor.\n. @glynthomas Signing off disables the access token :)\n\nsignOff / signOut is supposed to be called when the user intends to \"sign off\" from your application. This means they might be leaving a shared computer, and the computer's next user should not be able to access their data. Given all possible ways in which applications could store tokens, the only correct way of implementing \"sign off\" is to invalidate the token.\n\nOn your end, you should delete the token from localStorage, and/or any other browser-side place that stores it. Next time the user accesses your application, they should log back in.\n\nOn the other hand, if you're only using dropbox.js on the server side (e.g., in node.js), and the user's Dropbox token never leaves your server, you can rely on your own session management code for logging out users, and you can use a Dropbox token until it expires. In that case, you shouldn't call signOff / signOut on Dropbox.Client.\n\nDoes this help?\n. If the token is stored on the client side, you should revoke it when the user signs out, and get a new one when the user comes back and signs in. Leaving a valid token in the user's browser cache or localStorage would definitely not meet the expectation of being logged out, and your app might get disabled if someone notices that and complains.\n\nIf your app is completely client-side, I see two solutions:\n1. Use Dropbox for your authentication, like the samples do.\n2. If you want to use another server, have it store the user's Dropbox token, and get it when the user is authenticated. Or you can have the server generate a per-user encryption key, and use that to store the Dropbox token in an encrypted form on the client side.\n\nDoes this help?\n. @xunhuang, thank you very much for bringing this to my attention!\n\nI would definitely like to see dropbox.js powering Chrome extensions. I'll take a look this weekend, and I hope to prepare some sample code. Sorry I don't have time to do it today!\n. @xunhuang: sorry, bugfixes took priority over this, and I only got a chance to look into this now.\n\nTake a look here: https://github.com/pwnall/dropbox-chrome\n\nThe code is not well-structured yet, but it shows how I envision authentication for Chrome extensions. The most important bits of the code are here:\nhttps://github.com/pwnall/dropbox-chrome/blob/master/src/coffee/auth_driver.coffee  (custom auth driver)\nhttps://github.com/pwnall/dropbox-chrome/blob/master/src/coffee/event_page.coffee#L46  (figures out what to do based on auth state)\n\nYou need these two files for the chrome extension auth driver:\nhttps://github.com/pwnall/dropbox-chrome/blob/master/src/html/chrome_oauth_receiver.html\nhttps://github.com/pwnall/dropbox-chrome/blob/master/src/coffee/chrome_oauth_receiver.coffee (compiled to JS)\n\nI would have embedded the JS in the .html file, but Chrome's CSP doesn't like <script> tags.\n\nI'll most likely revisit this in the future, and hopefully I'll make the process easier by getting some of the code into the core dropbox.js source. Until then, I hope this gets you going.\n. @xunhuang dropbox.js 0.8.1 has out-of-the-box support for Chrome extensions. The API changed a little bit, so please take a look at the docs if you decide to use it.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/doc/auth_drivers.md#dropboxdriverschrome\n\nAlso, this is a better example (though still work in progress).\nhttps://github.com/pwnall/dropship-chrome\n\nYou'll probably be interested in:\n- the OAuth HTML: https://github.com/pwnall/dropship-chrome/blob/master/src/html/chrome_oauth_receiver.html\n- the OAuth JS: https://github.com/pwnall/dropship-chrome/blob/master/src/coffee/chrome_oauth_receiver.coffee\n- a very unfinished helper to store the user's identity: https://github.com/pwnall/dropship-chrome/blob/master/src/coffee/dropbox_chrome.coffee\n- uploading to Dropbox with a progress indicator: https://github.com/pwnall/dropship-chrome/blob/master/src/coffee/upload_controller.coffee\n\nI hope this helps!\n. dropbox.js 0.9 has a Dropbox.Drivers.Chrome driver that supports extensions and Chrome packaged applications. Both the legacy apps API and the new API are supported.\n\nI opened #39 to track the wish for a Chrome sample extension.\n. Tweak the redirect driver to display your button when it would do the authentication.\n\n``` javascript\nvar client = new Dropbox.Client({ ... });\n\nvar authDriver = new Dropbox.Drivers.Redirect({rememberUser: true});\nauthDriver.doAuthorize = function (authUrl, token, tokenSecret, callback) {\n  // Find the button that the user would click on.\n  var button = document.querySelector(\"#sign-in-with-dropbox\");\n  // Redirect when the button is clicked. \n  button.addEventListener('click', function (event) {\n    event.preventDefault();\n    window.location.assign(authUrl);\n  });\n  // Display the button.\n  // This code assumes your button starts out with class=\"hidden\"\n  button.setAttribute(\"class\", \"\");\n};\nclient.authDriver(authDriver);\n\n// Kick off the authorization process.\nclient.authenticate(function (error, data) {\n  if (error) {\n    // Auth failed.\n    return;\n  };\n  // It's safe to issue Dropbox requests.\n});\n```\n\nIf you tweak the redirect driver considerably, consider putting your code in a subclass.\n\nDoes this help?\n. You need to call `authenticate` to kick off the process. Is that the missing piece?\n\nI updated the snippet above to reflect this.\n. I forgot to set `rememberUser` on the auth driver. This way, the driver keeps track of everything, and only calls `doAuthorize` when an actual authorization has to happen. Keep in mind that setting `rememberUser` to true has [a few conseqeuences](https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/doc/auth_drivers.md#dropboxdriversredirect)\n. Hi, @350d!\n\nActually, there's a less hacky way of accomplishing this now. `authenticate` supports an `interactive` option:\nhttp://coffeedoc.info/github/dropbox/dropbox-js/master/classes/Dropbox/Client.html#authenticate-instance\n\nIf you use this option, your callback must figure out if cached credentials were used or not. `isAuthenticated` can help.\nhttp://coffeedoc.info/github/dropbox/dropbox-js/master/classes/Dropbox/Client.html#isAuthenticated-instance\n\nHere is how you'd put these together.\n\n``` javascript\n// Try to use cached credentials.\nclient.authenticate({interactive: false}, function(error, client) {\n  if (error) {\n    return handleError(error);\n  }\n  if (client.isAuthenticated() {\n    // Cached credentials.\n    doSomethingCool();\n  } else {\n    // show and set up the \"Sign into Dropbox\" button\n    var button = document.querySelector(\"#signin-button\");\n    button.setAttribute(\"class\", \"visible\");\n    button.addEventListener(\"click\", function() {\n      // Regular authentication.\n      client.authenticate(function(error, client) {\n        if (error) {\n          return handleError(error);\n        }\n        doSomethingCool();\n      });\n    });\n  }\n});\n```\n. @350d does this answer your question?\n. @350d sorry, I can't read my own docs. The option is `interactive`, not `nonInteractive`, to match Chrome's identity API. I updated the example above. Please try again?\n. @350d Glad to hear that! Send me a link when it's ready, if you're allowed.\n. @paulwittmann Thank you very much for the very thorough feedback on the docs! I definitely need some help there.\n\nI think that the example is in the Snippets doc: https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/doc/snippets.md#sign-into-dropbox-button\n\nAm I right? If so, any idea on how I can do a better job of pointing to it?\n\n`rememberUser` is not well-named. I'll most likely change the API in soon. This feedback https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/issues/45#issuecomment-13708661 made me start thinking, as I agree with the pain points.\n\nUntil then, `rememberUser: true` is basically \"I promise I have a button that calls signOut / signOff.\" localStorage is used all the time in the Redirect driver. When `rememberUser` is false, the OAuth access token is not stored in localStorage, so the OAuth redirect flow happens every time users visit your app's page(s). When `rememberUser` is true, the OAuth access token is stored and reused when users re-visit your app. The problem with this is that there's no _obvious_ way for the user to revoke the credentials, e.g. when leaving a shared computer, so apps have to opt into this behavior.\n\nWhen `rememberUser` is true, dropbox.js makes a `getUserInfo` to check whether cached tokens are still valid, because I don't want to tell the app that the user is signed-in, and then force it to go through an auth flow right away. Assuming no bugs in dropbox.js, you should only see one network request to `/account/info`. https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/1a53562f17e7f3e69af6a2ab56e938b62f3c1b96/src/drivers/browser.coffee#L53\n\nIs this what's happening, or are you seeing something else?\n. @paglias, thank you for reporting this issue!\n\nI just tried signing off and back into the Checkbox application myself, and no new app folder was created for me. Does this happen consistently for you? If so, can you try it out on a throwaway account?\n. @paglias sorry for being so slow on this!\n\nI could reproduce the issue with your steps. I forwarded this to the right people, and I'll update this issue as soon as I know if dropbox-js can be changed to fix this issue.\n\nThank you very much!\n. @paglias Please don't close the issue. I think it's a real problem that makes user experience bad, and I would like to keep tracking it.\n\nI talked to the people responsible for this and something is being figured out. I wouldn't count on the issue being fixed in the nearby future though. \n. @paglias cool :) Once again, thank you for reporting the bug!\n. @dworrad I agree with you. I ran into this during a live demo, and it was annoying. I will re-iterate the importance of this to the Dropbox API server team.\n. @dworrad You can also request an extra token and forget about it. As long as there's one active token for the user, the folder -- app connection will stay active. However, that'd make it look like your app is janky, so it's probably not a good solution.\n\nAs I said, I'll try to advocate for fixing this bug again. \n. @350d @dworrad @paglias I talked to someone at Dropbox and a plan is in place. Until that happens, I'll figure out a workaround on the dropbox.js side of things.\n. @350d I will be interning at Dropbox again this summer, and I can assure you that this is something I want fixed! I'll have an ETA soon after I start, ok?\n. @xunhuang, thank you for reporting this issue!\n\nHow did you download and upload? Can you share code / pseudo-code for the XHR calls?\n\nThe best way to avoid encoding issues is to use the XHR2 features for handling binary data, such as `Blob`.\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/XMLHttpRequest/Sending_and_Receiving_Binary_Data\n. Glad you got it figured out, and good luck with your extension!\n. @hc2p thank you for your help!\n\nYou can have different pull requests by creating different branches.\n\n``` bash\ngit checkout master\ngit checkout -b onprogress\ngit reset --hard a213a3a\ngit push -u origin onprogress\ngit checkout master\ngit checkout -b yui\ngit rebase -i HEAD^^\n# remove the line that contains the a213a3a commit, save the file\ngit push -u origin yui\n```\n\nThis should give you your commits on two separate branches. We should go from there. I want those issues fixed, but I don't necessarily agree with the approach in the patches.\n. `long` is not listed as a reserved word in JavaScript.\nhttp://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-7.6.1\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Reserved_Words\n\nFurtheremore, it says reserved words are only relevant when it comes to identifiers. Using `long` as a property name should be fine.\n\nIt seems that the problem is with the Rhino VM used in the YUI compressor. I tried replacing Rhino 1.7R2 with 1.7R4 (the latest release), and the problem still persists.\n\nI looked into the source code, and filed a bug with the Rhino project.\nhttps://github.com/mozilla/rhino/issues/93\n\nAlso, I tried to run the YUI compresser on the un-minified dropbox.js, and it pops up quite a few other errors. If it all possible, I strongly recommend using [uglifyjs2](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2), or its more mature ancestor [uglifyjs](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS).\n. @hc2p Sorry, I'm not trying to make your life hard. I'm currently relying on the CoffeeScript compiler to escape out all the reserved words. I'll still look into this, but I really think that YUI compressor is brittle and should not be used.\n. @hc2p The long problem should be fixed now. I'll look into `onprogress` a bit later, it's a more complex issue.\n. @hc2p I just committed a generic method for hooking into all XHR process.\n\n``` javascript\nclient.xhrFilter(function(xhr) {\n  xhr.onprogress = ...\n});\n```\n\nThis lets you modify _all_ the XHR requests coming out of the client. If you want to modify specific requests, you can do something like this.\n\n``` javascript\nclient.xhrFilter(function(xhr) {\n  xhr.onprogress = ...\n});\nclient.readFile(...);\nclient.xhrFilter(null);\n```\n\nDoes this look reasonable?\n. @hc2p  I'll close this issue, to make my issue-tracking life easier. Please open another issue if this implementation doesn't work for you. Thanks!\n. @hc2p in case you were using this, the next dropbox.js release will require a different syntax for hooking onto XHR requests.\n\n``` javascript\nclient.onXhr.addListener(function(dbXhr) {\n  dbXhr.xhr.onprogress = ...\n  return true;\n});\n```\n\nIf you want to modify specific requests, you'll have to do it like this:\n\n``` javascript\nlistener = function(dbXhr) {\n  dbXhr.xhr.onprogress = ...\n  return true;\n};\nclient.onXhr.addListener(listener);\nclient.readFile(...);\nclient.onXhr.removeListener(listener);\n```\n\nSorry for the inconvenience. I'm moving to a DOM-like event API, because I need events in a couple other places as well, and this looks more standard than the filter business. master was just updated with the new API implementation, so please use it if you'd like to migrate your code early.\n. Updating this Pull Request for consistency -- I added a snippet for using onprogress. It is based on the code fragments posted here.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/guides/snippets.md#progress-indicators\n. Thank you for bringing this up, @toyhunter! It seems that we don't have tests for this, either :(\n\nUntil I fix the documentation, here are some pointers.\n\nWe tested `writeFile` with Blob instances.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/test/src/client_test.coffee#L33\n\nHowever, `writeFile` uses XHR, so it should be able to take ArrayBuffer instances, etc.\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/XMLHttpRequest\n\nHTML5Rocks has a good tutorial on reading local files into Blob instances.\nhttp://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/dndfiles/\nhttp://www.html5rocks.com/en/features/file_access\n\nKeep in mind that you can't read arbitrary files off the user's filesystem. You need to make users select the files in an `<input type=\"file\">` control, or drag-and-drop them into your application.\n. Hi, @ericjang!\n\nI completely agree with you.\n\nUnfortunately, I have almost zero node.js experience -- writing the `dropbox-js` test suite was the first time I used node.js.\n\nIdeally, I'd like a small-ish example that would be useful to people building big apps. Is there something along the lines of Sinatra in node.js? (express.js, maybe?) Where can I read up on best practices for it?\n\nThanks!\n. Thanks, Eric!\n\nI also got a promise from a friend to review my code, so I'll make this happen!\n\nI'm fighting a fire right now, but I'll schedule up some time to take care of the dropbox-js bug queue really soon.\n. @tunix: Sorry! Please understand that this is voluntary unpaid work, so I have a finite bandwidth dedicated to this project. Recently, I've been focused on making dropbox.js usable with Chrome extensions and apps, but that work is wrapping up, and node.js is up next!\n\nTo help out with your planning, I will be working on #28 before putting together a new sample. Bugs before features :(\n\nAlso, any help on this issue would be welcome!\n. @tunix I interned at Dropbox last summer, and that's how dropbox.js got started. I'm still in touch with the API team at Dropbox though, and this is definitely the \"official\" library.\n\nThank you for agreeing to share your code! I would definitely like to see more code samples and learn about the roadblocks that developers are running into.\n\nI think that a driver for express.js will have to follow a similar strategy to the Redirect driver, but use the session or a database instead of localStorage. I'm sorry I'm not able to write that now :(\n. @code, @maxart, thank you for reporting this issue!\n\nI agree that it would be nice to be able to do partial reads from Dropbox. Unfortunately, I don't work at Dropbox anymore (I was a summer intern), so I can't make changes server code.\n\nI have forwarded your request to the appropriate developers. If they decided to add Range support, I'll leave this bug open, to track the dropbox.js support for partial reads. If I close this bug and the API gets support for partial reads, please open a new bug so I'll know to add Range support to dropbox.js.\n\nThank you!\n. @code, @maxart the API server now allows Range and If-Modified-Since.\n\nAlso, I just pushed support for partial reads, by adding the `bytes` option to `readFile`. http://coffeedoc.info/github/dropbox/dropbox-js/master/classes/Dropbox/Client.html#readFile-instance\n\nCan you please take a look and tell me if this seems reasonable? I'd like to include this in the 0.7.1 release of the JS library.\n. @piranna Sorry for being unclear! 'bytes' is an attribute on the options object, and its value is an object with the 'start' and 'length' properties. Does this seem reasonable?\n. I opened #30 to track an API server bug related to HTTP headers.\n. @piranna  Sorry I didn't understand what you meant earlier! This is exactly the kind of feedback I wanted. `bytes` has the advantage that it can be extended to accept an array of range specs later on, but I think I like `start` and `length` on the main options object better too.\n\nThanks!\n. @piranna HTTP ranges let you do crazy things, according to the spec. However, I was just old that the Dropbox API server doesn't do multiple ranges, so now I think having `start` and `length` on the options object is definitely the right way to go. I committed the change.\n. I opened #31 to track an API server bug related to the If-Modified-Since HTTP header.\n. @code Please beware of #30 though (I know you'll bump into it, because ID3 tags are at the end of a file). You'll have to compute `start` based on the file length in the metadata.\n. @piranna I do default `length` to the file length minus `start` (if specified). However, if `length` is specified, I default `start` to the file length minus `length`, because that's how HTTP ranges work, and because I think this is more useful. For example, if you want to read the last few kilobytes from a file, to scan for ID3 tags, the default I mentioned lets you do that without having to fetch the file's metadata. I hope specifying `start: 0` isn't too much of a pain, in return for having support for end-of-file reads.\n\nI think seeking would make sense in a higher-level API. I wanted to build a higher-level API that would come with built-in caching and object-oriented representations of files and folders, and I saved the `Dropbox` namespace for that. However, I didn't have time to make it happen, and I doubt this will happen anytime soon :(\n. @piranna I don't really like filer.js, because it makes up its own API. I agree that most old-school Unix developers (myself included) will recognize the commands right away, but I have yet to be convinced that most of today's Web developers fall in that category.\n\ndropbox.js roughly follows the node.js API for file access, so at least node.js developers should be familiar with it.\n\nOn the other hand, the Filesystem API is indeed something to look at! If the API doesn't get killed by Mozilla's refusal to implement it, it's worth providing a compatibility layer for it. Then higher-level libraries like filer.js can use that layer and just work.\n\nDoes this seem reasonable?\n. @michote, sorry you're having trouble with dropbox.js!\n\nCan you please provide a reduced code sample so I can take a look?\n. I opened #29 to keep track of enhancing the popup driver. If you encounter any other problems, please open a new issue!\n. @deoxxa, @aredridel, @whiskers75 Thank you for your input!\n\nI added more notes on CoffeeScript, and I added a README into the `lib/` directory. I hope this addresses your concerns.\n\nPlease open new issues if you have more feedback!\n. @terehov Sorry, I don't have any good news so far. I've been focusing on Chrome extensions support up until now. On the bright side, I promise this is the first thing on my list once I shift my focus to node.js.\n\nUnder the hood, we're using a node library that implements the XMLHttpRequest API. The author promised to support XHR level 2 in an upcoming version. Unfortunately, that library hasn't been updated in a while.\n\nIf you can find another library that supports ArrayBuffers (and, ideally, node.js Buffer objects as well), dropbox.js could use it without any modifications -- we do feature detection everywhere. If you can point me to such a library, I'll try running the test suite against it and, if it works, I'll swap it in.\n\nSorry this has taken forever :cry:\n. @terehov The master version of dropbox.js supports binary uploads and downloads on node.js, via Buffers and ArrayBuffers / ArrayBufferViews. Please give it a try!\n. @terehov I released a 0.9.1-beta1 node.js-only update that has binary support, to make it easier for you (and anyone else that might be reading this) to give this a try.\n\nThe price of binary file support is that I had to replace an old and pretty well tested XHR wrapper with a new version that I just wrote. Therefore, testing would be really appreciated!\n. @michote I just committed support for storing the authentication tokens in the Popup driver. It works in the same way as the Redirect driver, by passing the `rememberUser: true` option to the driver constructor.\n\nCan you please try it out and tell me if it looks reasonable to you?\n. @michote Oh wow. GitHub should be ashamed with themselves.\n\nPlease try this instead for now.\n\n``` bash\ngit clone git://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js.git\n```\n. @michote It seems like you're using Ubuntu, and I never tried the build on Ubuntu.\n\nGet the `dropbox.min.js` file from here for now. https://www.dropbox.com/s/4prfxlekmd8z360/dropbox.min.js\n\nI'll try to get an Ubuntu VM and see what's going on later.\n. @michote Thank you for the details! Can you please share the PPA URL with me?\n\nI'm closing this issue because the code seems to work. It will be a part of the 0.7.1 release.\n. @michote Thank you for reporting this issue! dropbox.js is better thanks to you.\n\nI opened #32 to keep track of the build issue that you brought up.\n. As of today, the test is active and it passes.\n. The Dropbox API server is not likely to implement `If-Modified-Since` in the near future, so the `modifiedSince` option was removed.\n. @michote I just built a fresh Ubuntu 12.10 server VM, ran the build instructions in it, and they worked. I'm afraid you probably have a configuration issue on your machine.\n\nThis is how I built the VM: https://github.com/csail/mit6470-vm/tree/master/building\n\nThank you for pointing me to the node.js PPA!\n. @winterlightning Sorry dropbox.js isn't working for you!\n\nHave you tried text file uploading first? I know file:// cripples some of the XHR functionality in Chrome.\n\nIf that fails, can you please post the snippet that you use to get the Blob, or at least some pseudo-code for it?\n\nThanks!\n. @winterlightning You shouldn't use `readAsBinaryString()`, because `writeFile()` will use UTF-8 if you give it a string. Instead, you should give `writeFile()` the `File` instance (`File` is a subclass of `Blob`) and it should be able to upload it for you. If you want to upload a fragment of the file, use the `slice()` method on `Blob` to get another blob.\n\nIf you really want to read the data into memory before passing it to `writeFile`, you can use use `readAsArrayBuffer()`.\n\nDoes this help?\n. MDN says the only way to send binary data is to use the XMLHttpRequest level 2 API (ArrayBuffer, Blob, File).\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/XMLHttpRequest/Sending_and_Receiving_Binary_Data#Sending_binary_data\n\nI'll update the documentation to explain that `writeFile` also takes File instances, as soon as I get some time to write a test for that.\n. @winterlightning Actually, up until a very recent commit, writeFile only worked well with Blob instances. As of now, it can handle Files, Blobs, ArrayBuffers, and ArrayBufferViews. You need your own build for this, or you can wait for the 0.7.2 release.\n. @ssr1ram: have you tried the `downloadHack: true` option with `makeUrl`?\n\nThis method has a small disadvantage: relative URLs won't work in your page, so you have to have to use `makeUrl` whenever you include a script, CSS file, etc., even if they're in the same Dropbox folder as the .html file.\n\nThe disadvantage is only relevant when users write the markup directly. In your case, it seems that your application puts together the HTML page, so you should be able to do the URL translation without your users noticing.\n\nPlease let me know if this works for you!\n. @ssr1ram I'll look into `downloadHack` in a bit. In the meantime, you shouldn't have to downgrade from https to http ever. You can include https links on http sites.\n. @ssr1ram You should put the assets in the users' folders. This way, your users' sites only depend on dropbox.com being up. Also, when you change your application, you won't have to maintain the old versions of the shared assets.\n\nCan you share the lines of code where you use `downloadHack: true`?\nI have a test that's supposed to guarantee that functionality works, so I'd like to make sure the test is broken before I start debugging it.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/test/src/client_test.coffee#L772\n\nThanks!\n. @ssr1ram Sorry this took forever, but it turns out there was a bug in the code, and another bug in the test code was hiding it. :sweat:\n\nI pushed a fix to master, and it will go out in release 0.8.2.\n\nOnce again, sorry for the lag, and thank you for your patience!\n. @ssr1ram I released dropbox.js 0.8.2 which should have the fix to this issue. Please reopen the issue if you're still having problems!\n. @snowfix Thank you for reporting this issue!\n\nThe `writeFileUsingPut` name is misleading, but there is a good reason for using `POST` -- it avoids a CORS preflight in browsers. Also, I wanted to keep the node.js behavior as close as possible to the browser behavior.\n\nWhat object are you passing to `writeFile`?\n\nI hope that `Client.writeFile` in the unit tests always delegates to `Client.writeFileUsingPut` on node.js, so `writeFieUsingPut` should be able to write String instances to text files.\n. @snowfix I'm afraid the problem lies in the node-xmlhttprequest wrapper. The XHR specification doesn't distinguish between POST and PUT, and the code works as intended on the browser. \n\nI'm working on a replacement XHR wrapper for node.js that will support binary files via Buffer and ArrayBuffer.\nhttps://github.com/pwnall/node-xhr2\n\nIn the short run, it probably makes the most sense to keep using your patched version of node.js. I hope to get this library done soon, and I'll make a dropbox.js release that uses it instead of node-xmlhttprequest.\n. @snowfix I think it's better to wait until I make a first stable release, because I'll probably be changing the code like crazy until I get all the features working.\n\nAfter that, definitely go for it!\n. @snowfix I have released 0.9.1-beta1, which is a node.js-only update that supports node.js Buffers and ArrayBuffers. Please give it a try!\n\nnode-xhr2 still needs more work, I haven't added tests for events and network error handling. I think the code for send() is pretty stable though, and you can start looking at figuring out proxy support.\n\nI'm closing this bug. Let's discuss proxy support in the node-xhr2 issue tracker.\n. Thank you for your feedback, Michiel!\n\nThe Dropbox API uses the OAuth1 model that has the client app establish a request token, get the user to authorize the token, and then exchange the request token for an access token.\n\nIf I understand OAuth2 implicit grant correctly, it is a bit different: the user is sent to an authorization page, and then an access token is generated. This flow is much better suited for browser apps, and in an ideal world, dropbox.js would use this flow to get a token from the Dropbox API server.\n\nUnfortunately, the API server only supports OAuth 1 at the moment, so dropbox.js implements that, and tries to insulate developers from the complexities and present an OAuth2-like interface. I will take your feedback as a sign that I'm succeeding at insulating :)\n. Does this seem reasonable? If I'm missing something from the OAuth specs, please let me know!\n. @snowfix I pushed node-xhr2 0.0.5 and dropbox.js 0.9.1-beta2 that depends on it. This fixes the error test I added, and I hope it will make everything work :)\n\nWill you please give it a try?\n. @snowfix do you think we can close this pull request? I'd rather not add the extra handlers if we can get by without them.\n. Thank you very much for this. Please keep filing bugs / fixes as you run into them!\n. Thank you, @kanzure!\n. @nathanathan, thank you for your feedback!\n\nI agree that sync support would be nice to have! I looked into this in early January, and here are my findings:\n- IndexedDB is the way to go; the FileSystem API is Chrome-only, and the Firefox devs said they will not implement it\n- Chrome's IndexedDB implementation doesn't handle blobs yet, so the blob contents has to be turned into binary Strings (on Chrome-only)\n- Chrome's IndexedDB implementation crashes on large strings, so files have to be broken up into blocks; this is probably a good idea anyway\n- Chrome crashes when trying to handle blobs that have 1Gb or more data, so the sync code should use ranged reads (that's probably a good idea for large reads anyway)\n\nI explored this in my Chrome extension for downloading files to Dropbox. These bits might be reusable:\n- IndexedDB wrapper: https://github.com/pwnall/dropship-chrome/blob/master/src/coffee/dropship_list.coffee\n- Uploading code that works well with both large and small files: https://github.com/pwnall/dropship-chrome/blob/master/src/coffee/upload_controller.coffee\n\nI started working on some sync infrastructure in a branch, but I decided to prioritize making dropbox.js not suck in node.js. I hope I'll have time to revisit this.\n. @nathanathan Actually, since you mentioned sharing -- I forgot to mention that I'm also concerned about dealing with the same app opened in multiple tabs. IndexedDB provides transactions, but this still means that the generic sync code has to be careful about storing metadata into memory.\n\nLast, if dropbox.js provides sync, it has to work in both the browser and node.js, so the heavy logic will ideally be decoupled from the storage code, and you should be able to plug in a Filesystem API-based storage driver to replace the default IndexedDB driver.\n\nThank you for pointing me to Cordova! I heard about it before, but I thought it's a company, I didn't realize it's an ASF project. I saw they support WebSQL, so my first attempt would be to use the IndexedDB shim over WebSQL. \nhttp://nparashuram.com/IndexedDBShim/\n\nI haven't tried this out though. I think that when sync happens, the initial implementation will only support IndexedDB on desktop browsers and a database / file-system combination on node.js.\n. @sakthieswar Thank your for filing this bug!\n\nWhat version of IE are you using? I test dropbox.js on IE9 and IE10, so it should definitely work on those.\n\nAlso, are you using dropbox.js 0.9.0 from the CDN, or the master version?\n\nLast, can you see if the sample application works in your IE?\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/pjlfdak1tmznswp/checkbox.js/public/index.html\n. @sakthieswar Can you send me a pointer to your code, or at least the parts that use dropbox.js? My e-mail is on my GitHub profile page.\n. @sakthieswar It sounds like the client isn't authenticated when you make the requests. A common misunderstanding in JavaScript is writing code that looks like this:\n\n``` javascript\nclient.authenticate(function(error) {\n  // error handling\n});\nclient.getUserInfo(function(error, info) {\n  // error handling\n});\n// use info\nclient.readFile(..., function(error, data) {\n  // error handling\n});\n// use data\n```\n\nIn fact, because of the asynchronous nature of XHR, you have to write this:\n\n``` javascript\nclient.authenticate(function(error) {\n  // error handling\n  client.getUserInfo(function(error, info) {\n    // error handling\n    // use info\n  });\n  client.readFile(..., function(error, data) {\n    // error handling\n    // use data\n  });\n});\n```\n\nOf course, you can pull out the main body into a function.\n. @sakthieswar If this doesn't match problem, can you please send me the snippets of code that involve dropbox.js so I can take a look?\n. @PunterSThompson Hi, Stuart!\n\nAre you accessing your page via a `http://` or `https://` link?\n\nIE doesn't let you make XDR calls from `http` to `https`, and the Dropbox API server only allows `https`. \n\nDoes this help with your problem?\n. @sakthieswar Sorry, I got confused by the comment below yours and thought your issue worked out. Yes, can you please use the network monitor in the IE tools to tell me what XDRs get executed?\n\n@PunterSThompson I looked for a while at getting binary downloads / uploads working in IE. I don't think that's possible without server support (i.e. uploading a base64-encoding string and having the server decode it). If I may ask, how do you get binary data, and what is it?\n. Hi, @SimpleAsCouldBe!\n\nI'm assuming that you're referring to this code?\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/issues/19#issuecomment-13117737\n\nWhen the user gets redirected back to your application, your page's state is completely reloaded. This means your code has to distinguish between the case when the user visits your page for the first time, and the case where they come back from the redirect.\n\nThe `interactive: false` option in the `authenticate()` method does that for you. So, if the user has authorized your app, you can start making API calls. If the user hasn't authorized your app, you need to call the authorize a 2nd time when they click the button, to start the redirect process. This is why two authorize calls are necessary.\n\nI'm not sure how to simplify this. The authentication process requires HTTP calls before and after the redirect, so I need you to call some method that allows dropbox.js to do the HTTP call, and that gives it a callback to report to.\n\nWhat do you think?\n. This seems like the 0.9.0 silent auth issue. Did you try this again with 0.9.1?\n. I haven't heard anything in a while, so I'll assume the problem is solved and close this issue. Please file a new issue if the 0.9.2 release still has auth issues!\n. @SimpleAsCouldBe just to make sure, are you using the 0.9.1 release?\n. Can you please try this out with 0.9.1? I changed `authenticate` a bit since 0.9.0.\n. @SimpleAsCouldBe I'm testing a fix. Thank you for reporting this!\n. Can you try building from master?\n\nIf it's hard to set up a build environment, these will be available for a short while:\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/46/dropbox.min.js\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/46/dropbox.js\n. @SimpleAsCouldBe Yes, can you please try the build I linked to, and tell me if you still get duplicate onAuthStateChange events? Thank you!\n. @SimpleAsCouldBe Thank you for testing! This will be released in dropbox.js 0.9.2, which will come out once I figure out a couple of other issues reported here.\n. This took way longer than I thought, but dropbox.js 0.9.2 is out now.\n. Sorry about this omission in 0.9.0 :(\n. This will become irrelevant once the oauth2 branch is merged into master.\n. @Marthyn I haven't tested dropbox.js on Phonegap / Cordova, though I would like to support mobile app platforms at some point. I suspect that you'll have to write a different OAuth driver to get that working.\n\nCan you please put together a minimal project that I can use to play with dropbox.js on Phonegap, and send me links to everything I need to set this up? I can look into this, if you can make it so that it'll take me less than an hour to set everything up and get to dropbox.js debugging.\n. @Marthyn You're running into an Android-specific bug.\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/10802575/network-error-on-page-change-in-android-emulator-with-cordova-phonegap\n\nI just pushed Cordova support to master. https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/doc/auth_drivers.md#dropboxdriverscordova\n\nCan you please give it a try? You can either build dropbox.js or, for a short time, you can also grab a build that fixes this bug here: https://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/49/dropbox.js\n\nAlso, please star the Android bug reports, so the root issue will eventually get resolved.\nhttps://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=17327\nhttps://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=17535\n. dropbox.js 0.9.2 should work under Cordova. Please let me know if that's not the case!\n. The latest master commit makes it possible to do binary uploads using ArrayBuffer and ArrayBufferView instances, and binary downloads using ArrayBuffers. Blob support is busted on Android, and dropbox.js won't be working around the Blob-related bugs at this moment. \n. @paulwittmann Thanks so much for taking time to help me fix the docs!\n\n`Util.encodeKey` is not a public API, so I'd rather that users don't grow to rely on it. Please think of the web form as applying for an additional OAuth 2-style key.\n\nI would like to pull the other change in the docs. Can you please remove the first hunk from the diff? Also, if you prefer, I can do that while I merge.\n. Landed the docs fix in 5eaabbdba46d2a9b9be4525103dabf7850ad9769\n. @aluedeke Sorry about the inconvenience! I haven't tried out dropbox.js in a Web worker.\n\nThe latest master commit should take care of the first issue. I haven't added a test yet, but the browser detection is more careful.\n. @aluedeke I plan to add a test, and I'll leave this issue open until I do that.\n\nRegarding your second wish, localStorage isn't accessible in Web Workers. You'll have to keep serializing credentials using postMessage. Sorry :( \nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/6179159/accessing-localstorage-from-a-webworker\n. The Web Workers tests are blocked on this PR: https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha/pull/780\n. The Web Workers tests are also blocked on this PR: https://github.com/cjohansen/Sinon.JS/pull/255\n. Using the patched libraries mentioned above, the code I just pushed to master passes the Web Worker tests on Chrome, Firefox and IE 10. I will enable the Web Worker tests when the pull requests get pulled.\n. sinon.js made a release including the patch that this bug depends on. The mocha patch is the only problem left.\n. The mocha PR was rejected due to being too large. It seems that a smaller (but more brittle) PR might be accepted. https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha/pull/867\n. @rtfeldman dropbox.js is currently tested in Web workers. This issue is still open to track the fact that the test suite is still using a patched mocha.js to run the tests. Are you running into any Web worker-specific problems?\n. @paulmars Thank you so much!\n. @eantz Thank you for reporting this issue! Can you please gist or inline the log file that npm points to in the error message? I believe it's `D:\\resources\\dropbox\\dropbox-js-master\\npm-debug.log`\n\nThank you.\n. Thank you. I'll take a look at this soon. While I sort this out, you can use this build.\n\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/54/dropbox.min.js\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/54/dropbox.min.map\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/54/dropbox.js\n. I checked in a fix on master. With this fix, I was able to build dropbox.{js, min.js, min.map} on Windows 8 using the latest node.\n\nOnce again, thank you very much for reporting this!\n. @joeriks Thank you for reporting this!\n\nCan you please tell me what browser / OS are you using, and what version of dropbox.js?\n. @joeriks How did you save the file into Dropbox? I used writeFile and readFile, and it came back with charset=UTF-8.\n. @joeriks To clarify, I meant to ask how did you save the file the first time around.\n. @mkotsur Thank you for reporting this issue!\n\nSorry the documentation isn't explicit about this, but `useQuery` only makes sense if you don't have a hash tag in your URL. The parameters appended to the hash tag come from the API server, and changing that is relatively hard.\n\nCan you please explain how this make your life harder? I'll need some arguments if I'm going to make a case for making the API server understand useQuery.\n. @mkotsur, @aluedeke Thank you for confirming this causes problems with Angular. I'll see what I can do to make dropbox.js work well for Angular development!\n. @mkotsur, @aluedeke I'm afraid this will not get fixed.\n\nAngularJS, Backbone, etc. should learn to deal with this situation. A part of the OAuth 2 specification (implicit grant) mandates that the access token info is passed in the URL fragment, using the same URL encoding that the Redirect driver is using above.\n\nSo, once the Dropbox API server supports OAuth 2, we'll end up in this situation again.\n. @bdotdub Thank you very much!\n. Hi, @kitikonti!\n\nThank you for reporting this issue. Can you give me an idea of how your application is structured and what your cache.manifest looks like?\n\nAlso, what browsers have you tested in?\n\nThank you very much!\n. @kitikonti Thank you for all the debugging information. It's great! I'll look at this tomorrow afternoon.\n\nUntil then, here's a general pointer. If you don't use cdnjs, you should deploy dropbox.min.map and dropbox.js in addition to dropbox.min.js. This, together with enabling source maps, will make your debugging life easier on Chrome and Firefox.\n. @kitikonti It's probably faster to do client.read (I'm guessing you'll have to do that down the line anyway) and handle the 404 case. That being said, I can't think of a reason why your code shouldn't work. I will take another look at it some time today.\n. Can you try adding the following section to your `cache.manifest`?\n\n```\nNETWORK:\n*\n```\n. @kitikonti Take your time, no worries, I'll be here :)\n\nGood luck debugging your app! Also, it looks really good so far!\n. Hi, Jake!\n\nCan you please clarify what you mean by \"data that is made public by a particular user\"?\n\nThank you!\n. Hi, Jake!\n\nRight now, the answer is \"maybe\".\n\nFiles: you can use downloadable URLs to share files without authentication. Use `downloadHack` in `client.makeUrl` to get a downloadable link.\nhttp://coffeedoc.info/github/dropbox/dropbox-js/master/classes/Dropbox/Client.html#makeUrl-instance\n\nDirectories: there's no API for downloading an entire directory right now. You can scrape the preview page for the 'download zip' URL, but that's brittle. If your application also creates the public data, you can put together a JSON file with `downloadHack` URLs to all the files in a directory, and use the URL for that file, instead of using the directory's URL.\n\nDoes this help at all?\n. Haven't heard back in a while, closing the issue.\n. @iulian-meghea Thank you for reporting this!\n\nI think the right way to fix this is to implement OAuth 2, which completely gets rid of the request before /authorize. The popup use case can help justify the work required for OAuth 2.\n\nI'll look at the timeline for getting OAuth 2 and figure out what's the best way I can contribute towards fixing this use case. In the meantime, please switch to the Redirect driver if that's possible. Redirect is more robust, so it's the recommended driver for browsers.\n. @iulian-meghea The Popup driver should work much better in dropbox.js 0.10, which uses OAuth 2. Please let me know if this is still a problem!\n. Iulian, thank you very much for taking the time to put together a patch, and I'm really sorry it took me so long to get back to you!\n\nAt best, this option belongs behind a flag. A minor issue is that it causes extra traffic, and some drivers might not need it. \n\nThe major issue however is that the request token that you get might expire if the user doesn't click the button quickly. If that happens, /authorize will take them to the home screen, with a red message that says the session has expired. I'll look into the code to see how long this takes, but it popped up when I was testing things in the past.\n\nI'll try to figure out how long it takes request tokens to expire and get back with more thoughts on this patch.\n. I think that's the way to go. I'd add an option to the Dropbox.Driver.Popup constructor that contains a path to the page that should be displayed while requesting the token. If the page is on the same domain, browsers should allow us to set the window's location. If not, the driver can use postMessage to tell the page the \"/authorize\" link to redirect itself to. I'm not sure cross-popup postMessage works well on IE, and I'm also not sure this case is worth handling at all.\n\nWould you be willing to draft an implementation of this?\n\nIf what you have right now works for you, I'll probably be able to take a stab at this in a week or two.\n. @iulian-meghea Sorry for being silent on this for a long time. The OAuth 2 flows don't have a request before /authorize, so the Popup driver should work as intended once OAuth2 becomes available.\n. Hey, sorry, I pushed the docs update too soon. dropbox.js 0.10 wasn't released yet.\n\nThe timeout issue should not happen on OAuth 2, because there's no network request before the redirect to /authorize happens. Assuming that you've set up your redirect URLs correctly, Popup should work.\n\nPlease let me know if that is not the case!\n. @DavidPratten can you please tell me how you're getting the Dropbox.Stat object?\n\nAlso, can you please this in your Chrome console and tell me what you get?\n\n``` javascript\nnew Date(Date.parse(\"Sun, 07 Apr 2013 23:18:43 +0000\"))\n```\n\nThanks!\n. @DavidPratten I just pushed a fix for this issue on master. Can you give it a try?\n\nIf you'd rather not build it yourself, the links below will work for a short while.\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/62/dropbox.min.js\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/62/dropbox.min.map\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/26/dropbox.js\n. How do I reproduce the problem? Is it the `All changes saved in Dropbox (2013-04-08 12:46:44)` text at the top?\n\nCan you please tell me what shows up when you eval `Dropbox.Util.parseDate` in the console?\n. If I had a dollar for every time Chrome's cache screwed me over... :)\n\nGlad it all worked out in the end! This fix will be out in the next dropbox.js release.\n. This was fixed in dropbox.js 0.10.\n\nThank you very much for making dropbox.js better!\n. @semorrison Thank you very much for the pull request!\n. Thank you very much for letting me know, @haehn!\n\nI'll see how I can help get this fixed.\n. @haehn This is ridiculously amazing! Thank you very much for sharing!\n\nI'm sorry this is moving slowly. Worst case, it should be fixed over the weekend.\n. dropbox.js now has tests covering CORS requests to dl.dropbox.com.\n\nIn node.js, handling the redirects requires node-xhr2 0.0.6. The dependency in package.json will be bumped and will be released in dropbox.js 0.9.3.\n. The tests and npm requirement bump were released in dropbox.js 0.10.\n\nThank you very much for making dropbox.js better, @haehn!\n. @cloudspark I hope you closed the issue because things worked out, not because you're giving up :)\n. This is now fixed.\n. @michote, @nathanpc dropbox.js has some workarounds for Cordova. I tested it on iOS and Android, because that's what I have simulators for. A couple of questions to figure out if I can help:\n1. Is BB 10 out, or is it a developer thing for now?\n2. Do they have an emulator that I can download?\n3. Assuming the answer to 2 is yes, does the problem show up in the emulator?\n\nThanks!\n. @nathanpc Yes, you can implement your own auth driver.\n\nThis file describes the interface. Only the first two methods are mandatory.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/src/auth_driver.coffee\n\nThis might help too.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/doc/auth_drivers.md\n\nSorry, it turns out I won't have time to look at this until the weekend at best :(\n. Thank you so much for catching that!\n. @chrismatheson Thank you for reporting this issue!\n\nCan you please include a link to the page in your webapp where you use dropbox.js?\n\nIf not, can you tell me what auth driver you're using, and what constructor arguments you're using?\n. Try using this to construct the auth driver in line 25 of `main.js`\n\n``` javascript\nnew Dropbox.Drivers.Redirect({rememberUser: true})\n```\n\nKeep in mind that if you do this, you must give the user a way to sign out of Dropbox (actually invalidate the token for your app). If you already have sign out functionality for your app, you should also invalidate the user's Dropbox token when they sign out of your app.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/doc/auth_drivers.md#dropboxdriversredirect\n\nAlso, you don't lines 11-13. Messing with internal variables is bad :)\n\nDoes this work?\n. @chrismatheson Sorry, I've been really strapped for time lately. I skimmed through the code and nothing else jumped at me. Is your app working now? How's cloud9 working out for you?\n. @chrismatheson awesome, thanks for letting me know! I'll look into it sometime this summer!\n. Whew! Sadly, there's not much I can do right now about API server performance.\n\nI'm glad you figured it out!\n. Thank you very much, @pcworld!\n. Hey, @dwiyatci!\n\nSorry, dropbox.js does not currently support synchronous calls.\n\nFirst off, dropbox.js relies on XMLHttpRequest, which was designed for asynchronous use. Using it in a synchronous manner would block the UI thread until the HTTP request completes, which is really bad for the users. On fast Internet connections, a Dropbox API call takes hundreds of milliseconds, so doing a few of those head-to-head means your application's tab would be completely unresponsive for seconds at a time. Most users would think something is wrong with your site, and outright close your tab!\n\nSecond, XMLHttpRequest discourages synchronous use, so some of its modern features (e.g. binary files) are not supported when the library is used synchronously. This means our code and documentation would have to become more complicated to support synchronous calling, which would mostly negate the simplicity advantages of the synchronous call model.\n\nSorry for the bad news!\n\nOn the bright side, there are some JavaScript libraries that can help you get up to speed quickly on asynchronous programming. I strongly recommend [async.js](https://github.com/caolan/async/). Tutorials such as the [html5rocks one](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/async/deferred/) might help as well. If you can afford spending some money (or your company reimburses books) I also recommend [Pragmatic Programmer's book on async JavaScript](http://pragprog.com/book/tbajs/async-javascript).\n\nI might revisit this issue over the summer. I think synchronous XHR would make it easier to learn how to use the library, and might help with debugging. Even if I end up working on it, putting together synchronous tests will take up some time, so please don't block waiting for this to happen!\n. Thank you for reporting this, @pcworld! It is now fixed!\n. Thank you for nit-picking, @pcworld! The issue should be fixed now.\n\nSorry it took me a long time to get to this, I've been unusually busy these past couple of weeks.\n\nPlease keep reporting issues as you find them! :+1: \n. @pcworld Do they have a SDK / simulator that I can test with? If I can figure out a way to make this work with feature detection, I can add a workaround.\n\nThank you!\n. @pcworld, I think GitHub's AJAX submitted this issue twice, it seems identical to #74. Am I missing something?\n. Thank you very much, @vladikoff!\n. Hi, @dwiyatci!\n\nCan you please give me a bit more context? Ideally, if you have the app up somewhere, can you give me an URL?\n\nIf not, can you give me a HAR file of your Network tab?\n\nI have a piece of code that's very similar to yours in the dropbox.js automated tests, and the tests seem to be passing, so your issue depends on some configuration detail (e.g. the setup in your code, or a specific browser version)\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/test/src/client_test.coffee#L1064\n\nThanks!\n. @dwiyatci Thanks for pointing that out! The string heuristic was there before CopyReference got introduced. Now you have to explicitly create a CopyReference out of a string if you want it interpreted as a copy reference, not as a path. The documentation fell out of sync, and I just fixed it.\n. @vladikoff, thank you very much for working on this!\n\nA sample application would be nice. Documentation and tests are really necessary, to make sure I don't break this in the future. If you have the sample app, I might be able to help you put together the tests.\n. If you point me to the code that you're running, I can try to look into it. I'm guessing that Firefox plugins don't store their stuff in localStorage?\n. Thanks for the sample, @vladikoff! Now that the code runs, I'll try to take a look at it this weekend!\n. @vladikoff Sorry I haven't gotten around to testing this yet! Something unexpected came by. I'll try to look at it in the next couple of days.\n\nI know my timing doesn't reflect it, but I'm really happy (and grateful) to get support for Firefox extensions in!\n. @vladikoff Please wait a bit until I merge oauth2 over to master. Also, I can do switch your code for you when I get around to looking at it, if you prefer.\n. @vladikoff I'm finally ready to take a look at this. Can you please merge your commits into one and rebase against master, to make my life easier?\n\nAlso, if you're busy, please let me know, and I can start from here. \n. @vladikoff I had an `except` instead of `skip` for disabling the tests, and for some reason this used to work. The Web Workers tests are now enabled on master, and seem to pass on Chrome and Firefox*.\n- 1 test fails in Firefox due to a bug in XHR not following redirects in Web Workers. Mozilla's bugzilla is down, so I can't find the bug number right now.\n. The spec says ~ shouldn't be encoded.\nhttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849#section-3.6\n\nI'll figure out what to about this in a bit.\n. @ayush-j, thank you so much for reporting this! We'll fix the API server. Please use this in the meantime.\n. @ayush-j Can you please double-check my understanding of the OAuth spec? I don't want to make the API server less compliant with OAuth :)\n\nAccording to my understanding, HMAC signatures are defined in 3.4.2.\nhttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849#section-3.4.2\n\nIt says to use section 3.4.1.1 to figure out the string to be signed.\nhttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849#section-3.4.1.1\n\nThat section says everything needs to be encoded according to section 3.6.\nhttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849#section-3.6\n\n Did I miss something?\n. @ayush-j The API server is fixed now, so this workaround isn't necessary anymore.\n\nThank you so, so much for reporting this bug!\n. @jfromaniello the API does not currently support this, and I don't know of any easy way to implement it. Sorry! :cry: \n. It appears like I won't have an answer for you any time soon, so I'll close this issue.\n\nThe closest you can get to is to upload an empty file `writeFile(\"filename\", \"\", ....)`, call makeUrl, and then upload the real file.\n. @pcworld Thank you so much for reporting this! Please keep reporting any bugs that you find!\n\nThe docstring is fixed in the oauth2 branch, which will be merged into master as soon as the backend bits are ready.\n. @pcworld This bug has been fixed for a while, and coffeedoc.info has been updated. Thank you for all your bug reports!\n. Landed in 7077a8e170e034eb4825d83f03b5b536a2bff207\n\nThank you very much, @pcworld!\n\nThe doc bug in Client#makeUrl is fixed as well. For some reason, coffeedoc.info hasn't been updating for a while :( \n. Thank you so much, @smarx!\n. @karacas thank you for reporting this issue!\n\nAre you using dropbox.js 0.9.2, or a build from master? Also, can you please tell me what version of Cordova you're using, and what version of Android you're testing on? Last, does this issue show up in the emulator, or on a particular device?\n. Thank you for the details! I'll look into this with phonegap 2.8.1.\n. @karacas Sorry, I lost track of this and documented all my progress in another PhoneGap-related bug. https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/issues/106\n\ndropbox.js 0.10.1 and later should work with PhoneGap / Cordova 3.1.0 and later.\n. @karacas dropbox.js 0.10.2 (just released) should definitely work with Cordova 3.1.0. Please let me know if that's not the case, or if you run into any other issues!\n\nThank you very much for reporting, and I apologize for dropping the ball on this for so long.\n. The easiest way is to call client.credentials(), store the object it returns, and use it to construct a new client later. The object is JSON-serializable, so will round-trip through JSON.stringify / JSON.parse.\n\nDoes this work for you?\n. @lucidtech This is a bug, sorry! It is now fixed in master.\n\nPlease use `contentHash` instead of `versionTag`. It's an option on `readdir` and a property of `Dropbox.File.Stat` now.\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/89/doc/classes/Dropbox/Client.html#readdir-instance\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/89/doc/classes/Dropbox/File/Stat.html\n\nIf you'd rather not build it yourself, the links below will work for a short while.\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/89/dropbox.min.js\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/89/dropbox.min.map\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/89/dropbox.js\n\nAlso, you can use the docs here for now. coffeedoc.info doesn't seem to be updating.\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/89/doc/index.html\n\nThank you very much for reporting this bug! Sorry it took me a bit of time to get around to it.\n. @lucidtech Thank you for reporting the issue! This is fixed in dropbox.js 0.10.\n. Right now, dropbox.js has a wrapper over [/delta in the REST API](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/docs#delta).\nhttp://coffeedoc.info/github/dropbox/dropbox-js/master/classes/Dropbox/Client.html#pullChanges-instance\n. Does Bower have a doc page where I can read about what they require?\n\nThank you!\n. Landed in 16c4b1554ede37183ab9c98daebc64feb5db6647\n\nThank you very much, @paglias!\n. @paglias Thank you so much for reporting, for the workaround, and for explanations!\n\n`localhost` is whitelisted for http, as well as `127.0.0.1` and `[::1]`. http is disallowed for every other host name, because we don't want OAuth 2 access tokens to be sent over the wire in plaintext.\n\nI'm working on a fix for the options.\n. @paglias master is now fixed. The `Dropbox.AuthDriver.Redirect` constructor accepts the `redirectUrl` / `redirectFile` options. Can you please give it a try?\n\nIf you'd rather not build it yourself, the links below will work for a short while.\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/93/dropbox.min.js\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/93/dropbox.min.map\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/93/dropbox.js\n. @paglias This bug should be fixed in the 0.1.0-b3 Datastore SDK. Please let me know if it isn't.\n\nYou can get the latest Datastore SDK from here.\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/developers/datastore/sdks/js\n. @baryon, thank you very much for making me aware of how Safari extensions work!\n\nCan you keep using dropbox.js 0.9.2 for now? Were you trying to use datastores?\n\nI hope to have a better answer for you in a few days.\n. @baryon sorry to get back to you so late! I was overly optimistic on the timeline for OAuth changes.\n\nWe set up a landing page for environments where you can't reliably host one yourself. It is\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/1/oauth2/redirect_receiver\n\nDoes Safari allow you to monitor tab URLs? If so, perhaps you can use the fixed page above to get by?\n. @baryon I'm going to close this issue, because i haven't heard from you in a while. Please open a new issue if you want to resume this conversation at some point in the future.\n. @350d I'm really sorry, but I lost all the context for this, and it'd be quite impractical for me to try to remember all this. Can you perhaps turn to StackOverflow for help?\n. @350d The point of opening up this discussion on StackOverflow is that you may find other people who can offer help. At this time, I don't have the resources to help you.\n\nSome details: I am currently not affiliated with Dropbox (you can see that I don't have a \"contributor\" badge next to my comments), so this would have to come out of my personal time. Unfortunately, I'm in a time crunch right now, as I'm wrapping up my PhD thesis.\n\nI'm sorry I can't help, and wish you good luck!\n. Landed in 70f6ccd235c3b24738c361fc592972020185aa91\n\nThank you very much, @vladikoff!\n\nAlso, I promise I didn't forget about #79 :)\n. @baryon Thank you very much for your question!\n\nI added a snippet for tracking the download / upload process.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/guides/snippets.md#progress-indicators\n\nYou should not need to modify DropboxXhrRequest or DropboxXhrIeMode. They're set by the feature detection code in https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/src/util/xhr.coffee\n\nIf you see a case where they're incorrectly set, please let me know!\n\nDoes the snippet answer your question?\n. Thank you for the feedback and for the research, @vincentlaucy!\n\ndropbox.js is layered on top of an XMLHttpRequest emulation in node.js because I wanted to maximize code sharing across platforms. I'm worried that having separate code paths for node.js will make it more likely that bugs will go undetected.\n\nThat being said, if I am shown that XMLHttpRequest emulation layer has an impact on performance, I will reconsider the design.\n\nIf the only perf issue is streaming, I think that the best solution would be to implement the W3C streaming proposal in [node.xhr2](https://github.com/pwnall/node-xhr2) and add a `stream` option to `readFile`.\nhttps://dvcs.w3.org/hg/streams-api/raw-file/tip/Overview.htm\n\nHow does that sound?\n. Landed in 3fc5c5798f1c38e4ea3c04c3601a0b41ca0610dc\n\nThank you very much @fatihacet!\n. @lucho870601, @nathanpc, thank you very much for the thorough report!\n\nIt seems like you're using an older version of dropbox.js (0.9.2, perhaps?) in combination with the documentation for the latest release (0.10.0).\n\nCan you please give this a try again, with the 0.10.0 release? If you're already using 0.10.0, can you please let me know, and I'll look into this further?\n\nI apologize for the confusion. 0.10.0 introduced some API breakage, for the first time in the history of dropbox.js, and I didn't do a good job of advertising this change. I have started thinking about how I'll do a better job in the future, and the `stable` branch is a first step in that direction.\n\nThank you very much for your patience!\n. @lucho870601, thank you very much for the thorough bug report!\n\nI think the problem that you're experincing is in the `vendor.sh` file in the sample folder. It pulls dropbox.js 0.9.1 from cdn.js, which doesn't work with the updates instructions in dropbox.js 0.10.\n\nCan you please try out the sample code in the master branch? (or aa958ac97e171c5cf28c4bd7d54452d37a6f2712)\n. @lucho870601 It seems like you're using `http://localhost:8000/` as your redirect URL. Have you listed it in your app's [App Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps) page?\n. @lucho870601 Thank you for getting back to me! I hope that dropbox.js will be able to offer more help with the OAuth 2 setup in the future, and I'll close this issue for now. Please let me know if you run into any other problem!\n. @Blumi can you please try removing the \"return\" in the listener function?\n. @Blumi weird. Can you share your code with me, by any chance? My e-mail is in my GitHub profile.\n. @Blumi, @lucidtech, we had issues answering OPTIONS requests on readFile and writeFile for a short while. I don't think that adding a progress listener should impact whether CORS preflight happens or not.\n\nI'm glad everything works now :) If you can think of the root cause, I can try to write a test for it, to make it less likely that we re-introduce the bug.\n. @janesconference does the stackoverflow answer meet your needs?\n. It seems like GitHub created two issues out of one. This looks identical to #104. Please let me know if I'm missing something!\n. @auramo Sorry dropbox.js is causing you trouble!\n\nThere are some Cordova-related fixes in master, which will be released in dropbox 0.10.1.\n\nUntil then, do you want to give this build a try, and see if it works for you?\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/93/dropbox.min.js\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/93/dropbox.min.map\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/93/dropbox.js\n\nThank you!\n. @auramo sorry to get back to you so late. Cordova is still giving me some trouble, but I think this build should work on 2.9 and below. Can you please give it a try?\n\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/108/dropbox.min.js\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/108/dropbox.min.map\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/108/dropbox.js\n\nFWIW, it \"mostly\" works on Cordova 3.0.0. The In-App Browser remains open after the user goes through the OAuth flow. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-4586\n. @auramo Yeah, this is where I got stuck as well. The OAuth flow completed, but the window won't go away. If you do \"adb logcat\", you might observe the same issue that I did.\n\nAre you using Cordova 3.0.0, or a 2.x build?\n. @auramo, @ginaluca There was a bug in the Android version of the In-App Browser plugin that was fixed after the 3.0.0 release. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-4586\n\nI think the Cordova CLI tool pulls the most recent plugin versions from the repositories, so if you have updated your plugins, the driver in dropbox.js 0.10.1 should work.\n\nOnce Cordova 3.1.0 is released (next week, supposedly), I will re-test everything. I hope that Cordova 3.1.0 and dropbox.js 0.10.1 / 0.10.2 will work together seamlessly.\n. My tests worked on Cordova 3.1.0.\n. Cordova 3.1.0 should definitely work with dropbox.js 0.10.2.\n\nThank you very much for reporting, @auramo, and please let me know if you run into any other issues with dropbox.js!\n. @nathanpc Is this still happening? We had a brief outage around that time :(\n. @nathanpc I haven't heard anything from you in a while, so I'll assume everything is OK now. Please open new issues if you run into problems while using dropbox.js!\n. Sorry @saverchenkov, it took me a while to get to this! I committed a fix to `master`. Can you please give it a try?\n\nHere's a build.\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/108/dropbox.min.js\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/108/dropbox.min.map\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/108/dropbox.js\n. This fix shipped in in dropbox.js 0.10.1. Thank you very much for reporting, @saverchenkov, and please let me know if you run into any more problems!\n. @boushley Sweet! Nice to know what actually happened.\n\nI am in the process of merging your change. I'm trying to make sure the PR will be closed as a \"Merge\" not as a \"Close\". I should be done sometime tonight. \n. @boushley Once again, thank you very much for this! I will merge your code right after you address the small two nits I commented on.\n. I merged this into `master`. I hope GitHub is only acting up  because this repo's default branch is `stable`, and that the PR will be closed when I merge `master` into `stable`, which will happen when I release dropbox 0.10.1.\n\nOnce again, thank you very much for the thorough debugging and patch, @boushley!\n. I released dropbox.js 0.10.1, and GitHub finally picked up the merge.\n\nThank you very much for the bug and for the fix, @boushley!\n. Hi, @JZL003!\n\nClient#readdir returns entry names relative to the path that you give it, just like fs.readdir in node.js. When you pass the paths to makeUrl, they have to be absolute. Try `client.makeUrl(\"/music\" + \"/\" + entries[z],` on line 8 of your sample code.\n\nDoes this work for you?\n. @joshuairl, here is a code snippet.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/test/src/client_test.coffee#L644\n\nHere are the underlying methods.\nhttp://coffeedoc.info/github/dropbox/dropbox-js/stable/classes/Dropbox/Client.html#resumableUploadStep-instance\nhttp://coffeedoc.info/github/dropbox/dropbox-js/stable/classes/Dropbox/Client.html#resumableUploadFinish-instance\n\nAnd here are the two methods in action, in the \"Download to Dropbox\" Chrome extension.\nhttps://github.com/pwnall/dropship-chrome/blob/master/src/coffee/upload_controller.coffee#L105\nhttps://github.com/pwnall/dropship-chrome/blob/master/src/coffee/upload_controller.coffee#L127\nhttps://github.com/pwnall/dropship-chrome/blob/master/src/coffee/upload_controller.coffee#L142\n\nDoes this help?\n. @joshuairl, I haven't heard from you in a while, so I'll close this issue. Please open new issues if you run into more bumps while using dropbox.js!\n. Hi, @borisjockov!\n\nAt the moment, Dropbox does not allow http: OAuth redirect URLs. (there is one exception, for localhost, because that doesn't cause the authorization data to be transmitted across a network).\n. @benweet If you serve your page over plain http, an adversary can do a man-in-the-middle attack and inject JavaScript that leaks the token your page receives. Unfortunately, just because the fragment isn't sent to the server, that doesn't make a Web app served over http secure. Because of this issue, we decided to disallow \"http\" completely in OAuth 2.\n\nOAuth 1 will be deprecated, and I expect that it will not be supported in a future version of the API.\n\nI personally recommend taking a look at [StartSSL](http://www.startssl.com/). Their UI is not great to say the least, but they do offer free SSL certificates, so you can get https for your site.\n\nDoes this help?\n. @benweet I just took a look. The UI is slick, I like it! Please let me know if you run into any other road bumps with dropbox.js, I'd be happy to help!\n. Thank you for reporting this, @Blumi!\n\nYou're not doing anything wrong. IIRC, the text in the OAuth window is static. I'll forward this to the right people.\n. Thank you, @varenc!\n. @borisjockov Updating without triggering notifications is possible. I haven't implemented because I can't unit-test. I'll try to prepare a custom build for you today. If that doesn't happen, it will, sometime really soon.\n\nI will look into updating files without creating revisions. If that doesn't work, you could cheat by writing to a backup file, like Office does.\n. @borisjockov Sorry, I spoke too soon. The backend, as it is right now, does not allow updates without notifying the desktop client. The only suggestion I can think of right now is to use Datastores instead. I am aware that the change would entail a significant amount of effort, so this is not a real answer. I hope to have a better answer in the future.\n. @zefhemel I updated the Chrome drivers to follow the latest chrome.identity API. Can you try master, or the build below?\n\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/116/dropbox.min.js\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/116/dropbox.min.map\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/116/dropbox.js\n\nYou don't need any OAuth receiver HTML or JS, and it should be safe to remove the `client.authDriver` call as well.\nDocs: https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/guides/builtin_drivers.md#dropboxauthdriverchromeapp\n\nThanks!\n. @zefhemel, @anthonyromano it's `https://your-extension-id.chromiumapp.org/`\n\nThis is what the [identity API](http://developer.chrome.com/apps/app_identity.html#token2) wants.\n\nFWIW, I hope to have an easier way of setting up your redirect URLs in the nearby future.\n. @anthonyromano You have to edit your app's OAuth redirect URL list, and add an URL that looks like `https://your-extension-id.chromiumapp.org/`. You can get your extension ID by eval-ing `chrome.runtime.id` in the Dev Tools console for the extension's background page.\n\nAlso, your production extension ID will be different from the development one. You should lift the production ID from the Chrome Store URL for your extension, and add the proper OAuth redirect URL to your app before publishing the extension.\n\nThank you for bringing this to my attention! I can make the debug setup easier, but I can't do anything about the production ID, asides from documenting the setup process.\n. @anthonyromano Thank you for debugging! I edited my comments above to include the trailing slash.\n\nSorry we're so picky :/ The problem is, any bit of leeway that seems fine now might turn into an exploit given the right combination of platform-specific bugs, so everyone is really better off if we're as strict as possible. Once you get your app working, you know there won't be any redirect URL-related hacks to worry about.\n\nIn an ideal world, all this setup would be done for you. I planned some dropbox.js patches that will get us close to that ideal, but haven't had time to code them up. In the meantime, I'm glad you got your app working, and thank you for posting your experience here to serve as inspiration to other developers!\n. @pmarinov can you please open a new issue? This issue is about modern apps, and isn't solved yet, so I don't want  the people involved to stop paying attention to the comments thread.\n\nLegacy apps have the `chrome.tabs` API, so the `ChromeExtension` driver from the build above should work for you. Can you give it a try please? Let me know how that works in the new issue that you open, and we'll go from there.\n. The fix here shipped in dropbox.js 0.10.2.\n\nThank you very much for reporting, @zefhemel, and please let me know if you run into any other issues with dropbox.js!\n. Thank you very much, @ginaluca!\n. Sorry this caused you trouble!\n`new Dropbox()` will throw an informative error in the next release. \n. @visionmedia If you give the token to a `Dropbox.Client`, it should not bother you about OAuth.\n\nhttp://coffeedoc.info/github/dropbox/dropbox-js/master/classes/Dropbox/Client.html#constructor-instance\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/test/src/fast/client_test.coffee#L289\n\nSorry the docs are unclear / insufficient. This grew library organically, and it's not as well-organized as I'd like it to be.\n\nCan you please tell me what docs you read, so I can think of a place to document this?\n. Oh, Safari :(\n\nFor the record, Safari folks were wrong to disable localStorage, because this makes it trivial to fingerprint their private browsing mode.\n\nI saw they made an argument along the lines of \"localStorage promises persistence, but private browsing discards all data, so implementing localStorage would be lying\", but browsers are generally free to discard localStorage data, so mehh. Also, I was hoping they'd leave sessionStorage alone, and I'd be able to fall back to that, but it doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nI'll write code for falling back to cookies, and I plan to test it on the stock Safari in Mavericks.\n. @ohler master passes tests in Safari on Mavericks with \"Private Browsing\" enabled.\n. Please don't close this issue until dropbox.js 0.10.2 is released :)\n. This fix shipped in dropbox.js 0.10.2.\n. @scorpiontahir02 Did you figure out the problem? I see you closed the issue.\n\nI would guess that you're getting the 403 because you haven't set up the OAuth Redirect URI in your application's configuration page on the Dropbox developers site.\n. Can you please put the code in a gist, so its indentation would be preserved?\n\nAlso, can you please include the error's stack trace by any chance?\n. Sorry about that!\n\nI'm behind on the documentation for the new auth drivers. In the meantime, if you have a specific piece of auth driver code, I can try to help you with that.\n. Weird... I clicked on the Client link and got to the page below, which seems to have a method listing.\nhttp://coffeedoc.info/github/dropbox/dropbox-js/master/classes/Dropbox/Client.html\n\nCan you please give me some details about what you're seeing?\n. Also, if coffeedoc.info is acting up for some weird reason, and you have the repo cloned on your machine already, you can generate your own copy of the docs.\n\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/guides/development.md#documentation\n. Codo is being rewritten, perhaps that had something to do with it. Sorry for the trouble :(\n. I'd be happy to help, if you run into any issues. Please reach out any time!\n. @visionmedia I did not know that. Thank you! I'll prepare a patch soon.\n\nThis is an API-breaking change, so it will come out in a 0.11 release, but you can use it as soon as it hits master.\n. @visionmedia I pushed a fix to master.\n\nThank you for making the API better!\n. Thank you for bringing this up! I haven't figured out how to integrate with promises, though they've been on my mind for a while.\n\nreaddir shouldn't pass the client to the callback. If it does, it's a bug :(\nhttp://coffeedoc.info/github/dropbox/dropbox-js/master/classes/Dropbox/Client.html#readdir-instance\n\nThe idea was to have the callback give you a list of entries in the result arg, like readdir in node.js, and more metadata in other args that can be ignored. Given the promise thing, it might make more sense to leave readdir work exactly like the node.js version, and ask callers to use a different method if they want more data.\n. Oh wow this is pretty terrible. I'll look into it right away.\n. Rather than copying the thumbs, you can use makeUrl with downloadHack: true.\n. Yeah, `thumbnailUrl` has the security issue you mentioned since the switch to OAuth 2. A solution is being worked on.\n. Right :(\nI guess it's a tradeoff, for now.\n\nOn the bright side, if you fetch files and put them in your own store, you're not restricted to the sizes / formats in the Dropbox API.\n\nI'll reiterate the importance of figuring out thumbnailUrl to the Platform folks at Dropbox.\n. thumbnailUrl now generates correct URLs on node.js, so the initial issue here is fixed. The security issue is separate and still present :(\n. Sorry, no good news yet :(\n. What is `me`? Where does `me.folder` come from?\nCan you `console.log` the values of `me.filename` and `me.folder` before calling `writeFile`?\n\nAlso, you shouldn't need to use `FileReader`. You can pass `Blob` and `File` instances to `writeFile` directly.\n. @CareyJWilliams Thank you very very much for letting me know!!\n\nAlso, sorry it took me such a long time to get to this.\n\nThe example app needed a configuration update. Once I did that, it started working. For your own copy, you'll need to add the right OAuth redirect URI to your application's page in the [app console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps).\n. @CareyJWilliams Thank you very much for letting me know! Please open a new issue if you run into any other problem!\n. @scorpiontahir02 \"Just fails\" isn't very helpful. Can you please include the error message that you see in Firebug and the stack trace?\n. @scorpiontahir02 I haven't heard back in a while, so I'm going to close this issue. Please open a new issue if you're still having trouble!\n. @sharepad If you use the Cordova driver, you should add the following URL.\n\n```\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/1/oauth2/redirect_receiver\n```\n\nI somehow forgot to add the URL to the guide about OAuth drivers. Sorry!\n. @sharepad Is the white screen what your application had to display in the first place? I'm not sure \"alert\" works in Cordova.\n. I haven't heard back in a while, so I'm going to close this issue. Please open a new issue if you're still having trouble!\n. @patchi8 Can you please check your code for the issue I mentioned on StackOverflow and report back?\n. `events.js` is not in the dropbox.js codebase, I'm not sure I can help you that much. Can you include a stack trace?\n\nIt seems like you're trying to start a server that uses a certain port (HTTP server?) twice.\n. @Joshua-S can you give me more details? This isn't very much to work off of :)\n. Perhaps you can put together a reduced test case by slashing most of the code that doesn't work with dropbox.js? I'd happy to look at that, or at your app if you have it up somewhere.\n. I'm trying to figure out how to run this and get to the Dropbox integration. I can't find it on the version on the site, or in the repo. Do I absolutely have to run this in Firefox OS, or can I run it in a Web browser as well?\n. Ah, cool, I was setting `window.onerror = null;` in the console.\n. I can't see the cause right away. An easy way to shed more light into this would be to rename your `cloud/dropbox.js` to something else, and copy the `dropbox.js` and `dropbox.min.map` that match your version of dropbox.min.js.\n\nAlso, this is 0.9.something, right? Any reason why you're not using the newer version that work with OAuth 2?\n. What I found so far is that the error happens when an XHR error occurs, and the client tries to call the custom error handler that you've set up.\n\nYou have one sketchy line of code in `cloud.js`\n\n``` javascript\nwindow.dispatchEvent(cloud.dropbox.auth.onAuth);\n```\n\nI'm willing to bet that causes some sort of trouble. dropbox.js doesn't use DOM events, so it's not meant to be used with `dispatchEvent`.\n\nIn any case, you should definitely copy the source map and un-minified dropbox.js in the same directory as dropbox.min.js. Debugging against minified code is really really painful.\n\nLast, are Firefox apps downloaded and cached on the device, like Chrome apps? If so, it might not be worth carrying around the minified version at all.\n. @Joshua-S I haven't heard back in a while, so I'm going to close this issue. Please open a new issue if you're still having trouble, and I'll be happy to help!\n. @amotion Thank you very much!! Landed as 0dbfc00ad3cc44359bfdf9d53f1d0e49e296ea88\n. @Blumi Thank you for reporting this!\n\nFWIW, this has no consequences other than the annoying console output. The XHR wrapper in dropbox.js tries to read the X-Dropbox-Metadata header all the time, and the header isn't whitelisted in the CORS heades sent by the backend server that `pollForChanges` uses.\n\nI'll sit on this for a while. I don't like making the Xhr wrapper more complicated for the sake of one method, but I do understand it must be annoying to have these warnings fill up your console.\n. @Blumi If you find a concrete negative side-effect, I would really appreciate it if you took the time to report it! It'd be enough to justify the extra complexity in the XHR wrapper.\n. @subblue Any chance you could post a reduced case?\n\nI have a unit test for calling writeFile with Blob objects and it passes on Safari. So either there is something special about your Blob (tainted canvas?) or my test case is busted.\n. @subblue Alternatively, if you have your app up somewhere, I can take a look.\n. @subblue I haven't heard from you in a while. If you still have this problem and can provide some data, please open a new issue, and I can try to help you debug.\n. @colinmegill I'm having a hard time understanding what you're asking for.\n\nDo you want the build output checked into the repository? If so, can you please tell me what your use case is, and why can't you use the cdnjs builds?\n. @colinmegill Also, FWIW, the FAQ point that you refer to states that the source code will remain CoffeeScript. Unfortunately, this deters some people from contributing to the repository. It has nothing to do with build products, which are JavaScript.\n. @colinmegill Ahh... I see your point now.\n\nThank you for bringing this up! I'll revise the README in `lib/` to state that the directory is empty in the repository, and you have to run the build process to get it.\n\nSomeone brought up bower before. I don't have a good story for it. I disagree with their suggested approach of having build products in the repository. I like the solution that Zurb foundation uses -- they have a build repository that mirrors the source repository and is automatically updated. If enough people complain, I might try to set that up, but right now I'm hoping that either bower or what comes after it figures stuff out.\n\nLast, you mentioned you use npm. The npm package `dropbox` should have all the build products in `lib/`, so you can use that and reach into `node_modules/dropbox/lib` to serve them. I understand it's not a general solution though... if bower manages all your frond end, special-casing dropbox.js is questionable.\n. I tried to improve the comments in `lib/README.md` and added an FAQ entry for serving dropbox.js from a server. I hope these help. I really don't like the idea of checking build products into this repository, but I'll look into automatically keeping a build repo in sync, if the demand is high enough.\n\nThank you for reporting, @colinmegill!\n. @ramRkanna Can you please tell me what documentation did you follow to get to that code? It's missing a piece, and it's not the simplest method. If it's in the dropbox.js docs, I'd like to get it fixed.\n\nYou should start with the easiest possible method, and only try something more advanced after you got that working.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/guides/getting_started.md#shared-code\n. @ramRkanna, @mendrik You're not supposed to pass in `interactive: false` if you want the OAuth 2 process to happen. That option says \"if localStorage contains an OAuth 2 token, use that; otherwise, do not start the OAuth 2 process\". It's useful if you want to display a \"Sign in with Dropbox\" button only when necessary. If you're going to do a Dropbox operation in the callback, you should not use `interactive: false`.\n\nDoes this help?\n. @mendrik If you have the token, you shouldn't need any of the other options. Also, `sandbox` was completely removed, so you don't need it in any case.\n. This looks resolved. Please open a new issue if I'm wrong.\n. @ramRkanna If you're only targeting Google Chrome, or Android 4.4 and above, you can try out the filesystem API. It has a pretty low adoption, but if it works for your audience, it might give you more space to work with.\n\nDon't store media in localStorage... it's synchronous, so it'll make your whole app jank :/\n\nYou should be able to use `writeFile` and `readFile` with one of the binary options (`arrayBuffer` or `blob`... I think `arrayBuffer` has better support on older Android versions, but you'd have to check). Please let me know if you go down this path and run into any issues!\n. TL;DR: the libraries can share the namespace. For best results, load dropbox.js last.\n\nThis should work. Please file bugs if it doesn't. We have an informal agreement on dividing the Dropbox namespace, so no naming conflicts should ever happen.\n\ndropbox.js has a bit of special code that makes sure it will coexist with the saver JS, as long as dropbox.js is loaded last. If dropbox.js is loaded first, the saver would have to take similar precautions to make sure both libraries will share the Dropbox namespace, and I don't have a test for that case.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, the Saver renders that nice UI server-side. I would like to have something similar available for dropbox.js, either in the core library or as a sibling project, but it's non-trivial, and I don't have the time to do it right now.\n\nAlso, dropbox.js requires a different API key, authorization, and production approval, so you'll have to do some mental juggling if you use both in the same application.\n. @iangilman At the moment, `writeFile` uses [files_put](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/docs#files_put) or `files [POST]`(https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/docs#files-POST), depending on the browser. `resumableUploadStep` and `resumableUploadFinish` use chunked uploads, if you need to go above 150MB. It would be nice to have `writeFile` automatically use resumableUpload when necessary, so please open an issue if you run into this problem.\n. I added #145 to track the wish for a Chooser / Saver UI for dropbox.js applications. Thank you very much for your feedback, @iangilman!\n. The project is still maintained. Some technical debt is preventing me from making a release and taking in new code.\n\nAsides from that, this specific PR lacks test changes, so it'll have to wait until I find some time to reorganize the `/delta` tests.\n\nThat being said, `path_prefix` is very useful, especially for Full Dropbox applications, so this PR will be merged some time, hopefully soon.\n. @AnalogJ thank you very much for your fix, and I'm sorry I got around to it so late.\n\nI rebased your commit on top of master, and landed it here https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/commit/eb6e8b50de82cdb2b24c6267c817c35ee8433790\n\nOnce again, thank you very much for your fix!\n. @patchi8 Is any other SDK doing OAuth under these circumstances?\n\nI'm sorry, but supporting Windows 8 under Cordova doesn't look good from a cost/benefit perspective. If you can point me to another library that does OAuth 2 under Windows 8 / Cordova, the cost might get low enough that I'd implement that library's method. However, I wouldn't be testing the configuration on a regular basis until the benefits (market share / reach) look better.\n. @braincore Thank you very much for this PR! I'll take a look at it later tonight. Is this documented anywhere? \n. @braincore I'll ping you over e-mail. I'd like to think a bit about how to work HMACs back into the Oauth class.\n. @florianheinemann Thank you very much for the fix, and sorry it took me so long to get to it!\n\nI rebased your commit on master, and landed it here. https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/commit/8e389d90c7a48965ccf03f1d0711ec75d3f0dbe8\n\nOnce again, thank you very much for the fix!\n. What Web server do you use?\n. You could have cherry-picked this commit, which fixes the underlying issue.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/commit/efcd123a37a77dc06bb3e7d7af4b300a81f90bbd\n\nAlso, in order to make \"npm install\" work, a new version needs to be published. I'll try to gather the devices I need to test on, and make this happen soon.\n. Also, sorry I didn't see this earlier. Not sure why my inbox is eating GitHub messages.\n. Reopening to track adding the `force_reapprove` parameter.\n. @pyprism thank you for the fix, and sorry it took me a while to get to it!\n\nI couldn't get the commits from your repository, as it seems that you deleted it. I re-created the diff and credited you as the commit author. This landed in https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/commit/90774be5ac67bd6fa277f6f833ca7643ec26ed29\n\nOnce again, thank you for the fix!\n. @rlmcneary2 Sorry you ran into this! This is fixed in the trunk version of dropbox.js.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/commit/d610b17c74b4ca8b236dcd7ef86aa891863f758e\n\nCan you do a trunk build, or would you like me to supply one for you?\n\nAlso, FWIW, accessing window.localStorage isn't going to throw an exception anymore in Chrome 34. I fixed that behavior, so that good old feature detection will work again.\nhttps://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?revision=243817&view=revision\n. @rlmcneary2 dropbox.js 0.10.3 was just released and includes the fix I mentioned here.\n\nThank you for reporting this bug!\n. @lavelle Can you please see if your issue shows up on a desktop Chrome / Chromium build?\n\nAlso, what's the easiest way for me to test this? Presumably, I'd get ChromiumOS running in a VM?\n. I finally figured out a better way to get rid of the warning, and committed it to master. If you're still interested in this issue and want to test a build off master, please let me know.\n. @rlmcneary2 The Chrome drivers use chrome.storage.local.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/src/auth_driver/chrome.coffee#L47\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/src/auth_driver/chrome.coffee#L63\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/src/auth_driver/chrome.coffee#L75\n\nThey only touch localStorage because they inherit from BrowserBase.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/src/auth_driver/chrome.coffee#L6\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/src/auth_driver/chrome.coffee#L14\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/src/auth_driver/browser.coffee#L28\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/src/auth_driver/browser.coffee#L212\n\nThis has the unfortunate side-effect that you get the confusing warning in the Chrome console. The version on master is restructured so it won't touch localStorage at all.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/commit/9432a8a27b0f759eaa2b338fd337a6b22666a871\n. @rlmcneary2 Sorry for the confusing message. That's totally my fault. I hope I'll be able to release 0.10.4 soon, so nobody else has to go through this :cry: \n. @talha-asad sounds reasonable.\n\nIn the meantime, you can look at the docs for Dropbox.Client.\nhttp://coffeedoc.info/github/dropbox/dropbox-js/master/classes/Dropbox/Client.html\n\nFor example, here's `/metadata`.\nhttp://coffeedoc.info/github/dropbox/dropbox-js/master/classes/Dropbox/Client.html#metadata-instance\n. @figalex Nope, but you do have to write (mostly) your own authentication code. I started working on a node.js sample last summer, and realized that the AuthDriver API doesn't work well for server-side programming.\n\nHere's what I have so far, in case it helps before I get around to putting together a proper server-side API.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/node-sample/samples/node-netsend/src/dbx_middleware.coffee\n. @figalex What do you mean by \"throws an error\"? Does the error get passed to the callback, or is it really thrown? Can you share a call stack?\n\nSorry about this trouble. The negative authorization paths are not covered by tests, so they're more likely to break at the moment :(\n. I went for `POST` because it's less likely to trigger a CORS preflight request. Preflights are evil because they delay the main request by a full round-trip, so there's quite a bit of logic in dropbox.js for avoiding them whenever possible.\n\nI think chunked uploading still triggers CORS preflights, but using a `POST` gets us one step closer to getting rid of them.\n. @robertknight Can you please give me more details about this? How do I get to see the error?\n\nIs it sufficient to try to run browserify on dropbox.js, or do I need a sample app?\n\nIf the latter is the case, can you please set up a GitHub repo with a minimal application that shows the problem?\n\nI don't have enough information yet, but I think that patching dropbox.js to use the browserify `require` would be sub-optimal. The XHR code in dropbox.js is carefully crafted to work around browser incompatibilities, so it'd be better to have dropbox.js recognize that it's running in a browser than to have it use `node-xhr2` on top of browserify's shim for the `http` library in node.js.\n. The [dropbox.js launch post](https://tech.dropbox.com/2012/08/some-love-for-javascript-applications-2/) describes how the library got created. In a nutshell, it started out as a Hack Week project.\n\nI was supposed to figure out what needs to happen to turn this into an officially supported library last summer, but didn't manage to do that before my internship ran out. Sorry :/\n\nThat being said, the library is fully documented, has pretty strong automated tests, and is available via npm and cdnjs. Is there something missing that you think you'd get in an official release? If so, please open specific issues, and I'll do my best to cover the gaps. Thank you!\n. Cordova is a development dependency, because it is needed to run the Cordova tests. It is not a runtime dependency. You should be able to use dropbox.js in a node 0.6 application.\n\nDoes `npm install` fail when you run it in a dropbox.js checkout, or when you run it in another package that has dropbox.js a dependency?\n. @zenorocha Thank you very much!\n. @cirocosta Thank you!\n. Sorry for taking so long to respond to this. I was hoping I'd find the time to address it properly.\n\nI need a failing test to be able to justify this change. In this case, I'd need to set up a Browserify build, and have the test suite run against it.\n\nUnfortunately, I can't spend the time I'd need to make it happen. On the bright side, you can help me cut down on that time, to a point where I can afford fixing it.\n\nIf you can point me out to the precise instructions that you use to package dropbox.js with Browserify, it'd cut down on the amount of time I'd need to spend setting this up.\n\nIt'd be extra awesome if you can add a Browserify build to the `Cakefile`. These files should be useful if you decide to look into that path.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/tasks/build.coffee\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/tasks/test.coffee\n. @moszeed See my comment above for what needs to happen for this to get merged.\n. @rtfeldman Sorry, I've been really swamped. Will take a look soon and make comments.\n. @brandonb927 Thank you!\n. @kchang4 What environment (browser version / node.js version, etc) are you experiencing this in?\n\nAlso, does the application halt precisely until you get the response from the server, or is the hang shorter / longer?\n\ndropbox.js only uses asynchronous XMLHttpRequests.  I suspect that the glitch you're seeing is due to a large buffer getting copied over. I think the current code causes more copying than it needs to, mostly because this hasn't been an issue in the past.\n. So you're using this writeFile in node.js code, not in browser code, is that correct?\n. Hi @jamarolo,\n\nAs far as I know, the datastore SDK is not published as an npm package. Also, I'm not sure it is tested in node.js. If it is tested, it is most likely that the tests use the same infrastructure as dropbox.js, so you can use [the package.json in this repository](https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/package.json). Right now, this means you only need the `xhr2` npm package and the `open` package.\n. @jamarolo can you please let me know if this answers your question / fixes your problem? Thank you!\n. @jamarolo Point taken, thank you!\n. You seem to be confused about how XMLHttpRequest event listeners work. Either you assign a function to a DOM0-style property, like \"onprogress\", or you call the DOM2 addEventListener.\n\naddEventListener is almost always better, because you can add multiple listeners from different parts of your code. Specifically:\n\n``` javascript\ndbXhr.xhr.upload.addEventListener(\"progress\", function(event) { ... })\n```\n. @alnino2005 What browser are you using?\n. @alnino2005 Thank you for sharing that detail!\n\nnode.js doesn't have native support for XMLHttpRequest, so we're using a library that emulates it. I'll file a bug to track the fact that it'd be nice to have progress events.\n. @alnino2005 Here is the relevant issue.\nhttps://github.com/pwnall/node-xhr2/issues/13\n. Thank you for the fix, @Xiphe! I landed this in 641803d02bf9e47c51991726c32fbf598a0b64cf\n\nI'll likely wait for a few more fixes before releasing a new version, because a release involves running tests on a bunch of platforms.\n\nIn the meantime, you can use a git ref in your `package.json`. You don't need to publish a new module on npm. \nDocs:  https://www.npmjs.org/doc/files/package.json.html#git-urls-as-dependencies\nExample: https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/package.json#L37\n\nThank you for reporting the bug and for the fix!\n. I didn't have `coffee-script` in `dependencies` because of this bold text in [the package.json docs on npm](https://www.npmjs.org/doc/files/package.json.html).\n\n**Please do not put test harnesses or transpilers in your dependencies hash. See devDependencies, below.**\n. @Xiphe the npm docs I cited above say that if you `cd` into `node_modules/dropbox` and do `npm install`, it will install everything and run the prepublish script. If that's true, your workaround above can be shortened a bit. Will you give this a try?\n. It seems like you have more leverage than me on getting the issue fixed on the npm side ;)\n. If this takes some time to fix, I can try to figure out a workaround.\n. Sweet! Thank you for updating this thread!\n. @chalax This should work, according to the [Core API docs](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/docs#copy_ref).\n\nCan you use `console.error` or `console.log` and report back the error that you're getting?\n. The ChromeApp driver doesn't use localStorage. You shouldn't experience any errors regarding it.\n\nYou don't need to request permissions for dropbox.com.\n\nDid you set up the right OAuth callback URL for your app?\n. @ehfeng Thanks for the contribution! Can you please try adding some tests? If not, this'll have to wait until I get around to doing that.\n. @ehfeng https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/guides/development.md#test\n\nThe callback should always be the last argument, otherwise passing functions becomes a pain. See `setTimeout` / `setInterval` for the consequences of getting it wrong.\n\nThe best way to make sure things work is to run the current tests, and add more :)\n. @smarx Your code almost works. It doesn't handle passing options, but not a cursor.\n\nI think the following works, but I'm not sure.\n\n``` coffeescript\nif (not callback) and (typeof options is 'function')\n  callback = options\n  options = null\nif (not callback) and (typeof cursor is 'function')\n  callback = cursor\n  cursor = null\nif (not options) and (typeof cursor is 'object') and not cursor.cursorTag\n```\n\nThat's why we need tests before merging something like this :) \n. Last, FWIW, from a usability perspective, the cursor object should get a copy of the options, so future calls that only use the cursor work properly. \n\nSpecifically, I'm thinking of these sentences in the Core API docs\n- If you use the path_prefix parameter, you must continue to pass the correct prefix on subsequent calls using the returned cursor.\n- If you use the include_media_info parameter, you must continue to pass the same value on subsequent calls using the returned cursor.\n. @smarx Argh, sorry, I missed the text below the code. It's too early :/\n. You should do the authentication from your extension's background / event page. You can use [chrome.runtime.getBackgroundPage](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/runtime#method-getBackgroundPage) to get to the global object in the background page, and perform actions from that context.\n\nThis is an overly complex example of a Chrome extension that uses Dropbox.\nhttps://github.com/pwnall/dropship-chrome\n\nRelevant lines:\nhttps://github.com/pwnall/dropship-chrome/blob/master/src/coffee/options_view.coffee#L91\nhttps://github.com/pwnall/dropship-chrome/blob/master/src/coffee/event_page.coffee#L267\n\nI hope this helps.\n. You don't need messages, you can do \n\n``` javascript\nchrome.runtime.getBackgroundPage(function(backgroundWindow) {\n    var client = backgroundWindow.client;\n    if (client.isAuthenticated()) { .... }\n});\n```\n. That being said, what you wrote still works. I'll look into dropbox.js for a bit, to make sure I'm saving the auth data correctly.\n. @Imskull Thanks so much for reporting this issue!\n\nCan you please try out a build from master? I think I just fixed the problem.\n. @nathanhammond Thank you very much for the fix!\n\nThat must have been a PITA to debug! Sorry!\n. I am really sorry about that! I'm still waiting for tests to finish before I push this to master, but it should get out in the next few hours.\n. First off, suggestions for improving any API are welcome!\n\nI built the resumeAuthorize API for the redirect driver.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/src/auth_driver/browser.coffee#L309\n\nIt's called here.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/src/client.coffee#L193\n\nMy design assumes that consumer code doesn't calling into AuthDriver instance. It should call Dropbox.Client#authenticate, which drives the OAuth 2 process and calls into the driver when necessary.\n\nIn my experience, this design worked out well for client-side apps, but doesn't work for server-side code, e.g. node.js. I haven't had time to finish up a node.js app and figure out what the API should look like in that case.\n\nAre you trying to write a server-side app?\n. The client call looks good. I usually wrap the result in an object class, like this.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/src/file/stat.coffee\n\nHaving the wrapper makes testing easier, because we can have edge case tests as unit tests for the wrapper class, and we don't necessarily need to cover them in Client tests.\n\nI'm guessing that testing will be a bit of a pain for this. It seems like we need to amend testing instructions with directions about creating specific folders and sharing them with specific users. It really sucks that there's no \"share\" / \"accept share\" API. That'd let us contain the setup in the tests, like we do for writeFile / readFile.\n. Can you look at the network tab and see what happens?\n. @marxo Do you see the `/metadata` network request for the `readdir` call in the Network tab? If so, it seems like either you have a bug, or dropbox.js chokes on something in the output. Is there any chance you can point me to the code that you're working on, so I can see what's broken?\n. https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/src/client.coffee#L36\n. @davidmerfield Do you happen to know any other Codo documentation hosting service? \n\n@smarx Should I host the files in my Dropbox?\n. @aseemk I thought of heroku before. Unfortunately, coffeedoc.info seems to use 2 drones, which would translate into 2 dynos. I'm sure the drones can be merged, and so far I've been put off by the prospect of doing this on my own.\n\nI can do a first pass at getting coffeedoc.info working on heroku, if you'd be willing to code-review and help me with whatever ongoing maintenance work pops up.\n. @smarx I got an error as well, seems like bitrot got to it. I'll try to fix the problem this weekend.\n. @aseemk Thanks for the great news!\n. This is a StackOverflow question, not an issue with the library.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Sorry, I forgot to say thanks for this one! I merged the XHR support, but took out the Node.JS support, because it relies on patches to XHR. I'm torn between patching XHR to accept Buffers, and preparing a bigger patch that implements wrappers for ArrayBuffer and Blob. Any thoughts?\n. Thank you very much for reporting this bug!\n\nCalling the app secret a \"secret\" is an unfortunate side-effect of using OAuth 1.0. The \"secret\" isn't really secret in applications that must client-side, such as mobile apps, desktop apps, and JavaScript apps without backends.\n\nThe Dropbox authentication model doesn't assume that the secret is actually secret. The user must approve every request to `/oauth/authorize`, which is different from Facebook's OAuth 2.0 model.\n\nIn the future, I hope there will be better messaging around the API key and \"secret\". Until then, please write awesome JavaScript apps!\n\nLast but not least, if there are any authentication improvements in the REST API, and I'm not on top of them, please file a bug!\n. After a conversation with Dropboxers on the API team, we decided to add support to `dropbox.js` for concealing the API key and secret, and to require that browser-side applications use this method (or any other method) to conceal their API credentials before applying for production status.\n\nThe details are [here](https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/doc/getting_started.md#browser-and-open-source-applications).\n\nI tried to make the process as painless as possible. Please file a bug if you think of a way to further streamline this.\n. @adnandoric Can you contact me over e-mail to discuss the timeline for your application? We'll have something out this week that addresses your concerns :)\n. @adnandoric Right now, my previous comment still stands. If you need to build and publish an application in the next couple of days, follow the process documented in [the \"here\" link above](https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/doc/getting_started.md#browser-and-open-source-applications). Applications following this process have been approved for production.\n\nThere should be an announcement later this week that makes all that process obsolete, though.\n. @adnandoric That is not what I said.\n\nFirst off, you should never expose your API key and secret in plaintext in an application. You should make some decent effort to obfuscate it, so a casual attacker can't lift the API key and secret and impersonate your application. dropbox.js has build-in obfuscation support, and the link above documents setting it up.\n\nSecond, this isn't a perfect solution. It is the best we can do for applications that need to run the OAuth flow client-side. If you're worried about security, you should use dropbox.js in node.js or another server environment, so credentials aren't exposed to clients.\n\nWe'll have a better client-side story really, really soon.\n. For anyone seeing this issue: dropbox.js 0.10 and above use OAuth 2. In OAuth 2, web apps use the API key, and do not use the API secret. So, obfuscating is no longer necessary.\n. Thank you for reporting this bug, and I'm really sorry for the trouble! There was a typo in the documentation. `Driver` should be `Drivers`.\n\nOnce again, thanks so much for reporting the bug!\n. That is very good feedback, thank you very much!\n\nIndeed, `showError` and `doSomethingCool` are not defined in the sample snippets. They are placeholders for your code. I add comments to make this clearer.\n\nThe [checkbox.js sample application](https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/tree/master/samples/checkbox.js) might be helpful to look at. Its `showError` function shows a div that tells the users something went wrong and asks them to refresh the page, and I think it's a pretty reasonable strategy, at least at the prototype stage.\n\nIt is my hope that `authenticate` in `Dropbox.Client` will take care of all your OAuth needs, and you won't need to learn the specifics of OAuth to write a Dropbox application. What problems are you having with `authenticate`?\n. No idea how the garbled comment got there, sorry. In any case, you can use [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Storage) to store your user's credentials.\n\nThe `credentials` method in `Dropbox.Client` will give you a JSON-compliant object that you can save into localStorage using something like `localStorage.setItem('dropbox_auth', JSON.stringify(client.credentials()))`. Later, pass this object to the `Dropbox.Client` constructor to pick up from where you left, using something along the lines of `new Dropbox.Client(JSON.parse(localStorge.getItem('dropbox_auth')))`.\n\nAs a warning, once you do that, you have to come up with a strategy for dealing with expired tokens. That's the main reason why the sample apps don't store user tokens -- I didn't want the expiration logic code to get readers confused.\n. I think tokens are supposed to be permanent, at the moment.\n\nHowever, based the evolution of the Facebook API, I would expect that eventually tokens will expire in 14 days, or in 30 days.\n\nMy tokens expired twice while I was building dropbox.js. The expiration might have been caused by my other development work, but I'd still want my apps to consider this case.\n. Did you call `client.authDriver` to set up an OAuth driver?\n. The credentials should not contain `authState`. The object returned by `credentials()` only has the `authState` property set during the authentication process. After the authentication succeeds, the `credentials()` object should have the following properties: `key`, `secret`, `sandbox`, `token`, `tokenSecret` and `uid`.\n\nThis test backs up what I just said.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/test/src/client_test.coffee#L619\n. Also, if you use the `rememberUser` option for the `Dropbox.Drivers.Redirect` driver in dropbox.js 0.6.0, you can call `authenticate` on every page, and the user won't see confirmation dialogs, since `localStorage` is shared by pages with the same origin. I hope this helps.\n. You need to set the OAuth driver every time you build a Dropbox.Client instance. You'll probably need to have this code on all your pages that use the Dropbox API.\n\n``` javascript\nvar client = new Dropbox.Client({key: \"your-app-key\", secret: \"your-app-secret\", sandbox: true});\nclient.authDriver(new Dropbox.Drivers.Redirect({rememberUser: true}));\n```\n. Hey, guys!\n\nSorry, having to authorize every time is a pain indeed. Most of the reasons why the drivers don't store the OAuth tokens for you are historical (solved bugs), but there is one real issue left -- if you store the OAuth tokens, the user isn't \"logged out\" of your application when they log out of Dropbox.\n\nAs a workaround until I figure out a better way of logging out, set the `rememberUser: true` option when instantiating the `Dropbox.Driver.Redirect` OAuth driver.\n\n``` javascript\nclient.authDriver(new Dropbox.Drivers.Redirect({rememberUser: true}));\n```\n\nThis should do the trick in development. If you really want to push this to real users, at the very least have a \"Sign out\" button somewhere, and call `forgetCredentials()` on the OAuth driver.\n. Sorry, I forgot to mention, you'll need to build `dropbox.js` off of GitHub to use `rememberUser`.\n. Made a couple of improvements.\n- the \"Sign out\" implementation should call `signOut` on the `Dropbox.Client`, instead of calling some obscure method on the OAuth driver.\n- the `checkbox.js` sample app in the repository has been updated to use `rememberUser`, and has a \"Sign out\" implementation\n- there is some documentation for [writing OAuth drivers](https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/doc/auth_drivers.md)\n- everything will be available in dropbox.js 0.6.0, which should hit up `cdnjs` pretty soon\n. Thank you for reporting the bug, @lmorchard! Please let me know if you run into any other roadblock that dropbox.js should be handling for you.\n. Thank you very much for the patch!\n. Thank you for your patch, @hinathan!\n. This fix was included in `dropbox.js` version 0.6.1.\n. Good point, @xMartin! Thanks for the bug report!\n\nThis should be fixed on master, and will make it to the next point release.\n. Thanks for the patch, @thedjpetersen!\n\nActually, the <script> URL is what cdnjs.org recommends. I added a note to getting_started.md explaining that. Sorry for the confusion, and thank you for pointing that out!\n. What is a session for you? Do you mean the authentication state? (OAuth token)\n. If your JavaScript is running in the browser, the Redirect driver can persist your authentication information.\n\nThis section will help.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/doc/auth_drivers.md#dropboxdriversredirect\n\nIf you're writing a node.js app, you're pretty much on your own right now. `Dropbox.Client#credentials()` returns the authentication information as a JSON-compliant object. You can pass it to the `Dropbox.Client` constructor to get a new client configured to use the same OAuth token.\n\nUnfortunately, I have very little node.js experience, and I don't know how I can better support node.js apps. Patches or guidance would be welcome!\n. Sorry for your inconvenience, and thank you for reporting this issue!\n\nI fixed the URL, dropbox-js builds from 0.6.2 onwards will have the right URL.\n. @Crome thank you very much for the bug report and for the fix!\n\nI'll start preparing a patch. Please send a pull request, or message me a name (and optionally an e-mail address) if you'd like credit for the fix.\n. This bug was fixed in the 0.6.3 release.\n\nThank you very much for reporting! I don't test on IE as often as it should, and I'm really grateful that you made me aware of this show-stopping IE issue.\n. @martinklein Sorry, the documentation must be confusing. I'll try to explain. If my explanation makes sense, please consider sending a pull request with a documentation fix.\n\nThere are two types of files in your application, the source code, and the application data.\n\nThe _source code_ lives in `Apps/Static Web Apps/DVD Library` in _your_ Dropbox, and is publicly available at the URL generated by the [Static Web Apps console](https://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/pjlfdak1tmznswp/powered_by.js/public/index.html). You can think of this location as a file server. For example, this is where you should put the HTML, CSS, JavaScript and images behind your application.\n\nThe _application data_ lives in `Apps/DVD Library` in _each of your users'_ Dropboxes. This is the area that you can access via `readFile` and `writeFile` calls. The tricky concept here is that each user's data is stored in their Dropbox, so you can only see your own data. On the bright side, you can get security for free, as long as you don't store your users' credentials in a central place.\n\nDoes this help?\n. I haven't heard from you in a while, so I hope all is going well. I look forward to seeing your app!\n. The OAuth implementation in the Dropbox API requires the API key and API secret for making API calls. So `Dropbox.Client` needs the `key` parameter. It could definitely throw a more descriptive error message though, I'll see what I can do about that.\n. I just pushed a commit that should make this situation easier to debug in the future. I hope it helps!\n. The text in the dropbox API documentation is a bit unfortunate, but its meaning is that once you have an access token, you don't need to obtain a request token, authenticate it, and exchange it for the access token.\n\nThe [REST API reference](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/api), which documents the HTTP protocol that all the other SDKs are built on top of, says \"Dropbox uses OAuth to authenticate all API requests.\"\n\nThe [OAuth 1.0a example](http://oauth.net/core/1.0a/#anchor46) shows that the API key needs to be passed in as the `oauth_consumer_key` parameter, and the API secret is used to compute the `oauth_signature` field.\n\nLast, the [example](http://www.springframework.net/social-dropbox/refdoc/api.html) provided as an API reference by the library that you mentioned seems to contradict your claims that it doesn't need an API key / secret. The `serviceProvider` variable holds an instance of `DropboxServiceProvider`, whose constructor takes in an API key and secret. The library seems to require a `IDropbox` instance to make actual API calls, and the provided example uses a call on `serviceProvider` to get an `IDropbox` instance. So the `IDropbox` instance does get the API key and secret.\n\nI hope this helps!\n. @tylerwsy yes. You can pass the `token` and `tokenSecret` options to the `Dropbox.Client` constructor.\n\nYou can pass your API key and secret into the `key` and `secret` constructor options, but your production access might get revoked for passing your key around without obfuscation. To get past that, you should combine the key and secret as described in [the Getting Started guide](https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/doc/getting_started.md#browser-and-open-source-applications).\n\nDoes this help?\n. @tylerwsy you don't need to call `authenticate()`, the client is authenticated.\n\nOne minor potential issue: Dropbox provides a user ID after authentication, which can be obtained by calling `dropboxUid()` on client. If you rely on that functionality, you should also pass the uid down from the server, and supply it as the `uid` option to the `Drobpox.Client` constructor.\n. @glynthomas Signing off disables the access token :)\n\nsignOff / signOut is supposed to be called when the user intends to \"sign off\" from your application. This means they might be leaving a shared computer, and the computer's next user should not be able to access their data. Given all possible ways in which applications could store tokens, the only correct way of implementing \"sign off\" is to invalidate the token.\n\nOn your end, you should delete the token from localStorage, and/or any other browser-side place that stores it. Next time the user accesses your application, they should log back in.\n\nOn the other hand, if you're only using dropbox.js on the server side (e.g., in node.js), and the user's Dropbox token never leaves your server, you can rely on your own session management code for logging out users, and you can use a Dropbox token until it expires. In that case, you shouldn't call signOff / signOut on Dropbox.Client.\n\nDoes this help?\n. If the token is stored on the client side, you should revoke it when the user signs out, and get a new one when the user comes back and signs in. Leaving a valid token in the user's browser cache or localStorage would definitely not meet the expectation of being logged out, and your app might get disabled if someone notices that and complains.\n\nIf your app is completely client-side, I see two solutions:\n1. Use Dropbox for your authentication, like the samples do.\n2. If you want to use another server, have it store the user's Dropbox token, and get it when the user is authenticated. Or you can have the server generate a per-user encryption key, and use that to store the Dropbox token in an encrypted form on the client side.\n\nDoes this help?\n. @xunhuang, thank you very much for bringing this to my attention!\n\nI would definitely like to see dropbox.js powering Chrome extensions. I'll take a look this weekend, and I hope to prepare some sample code. Sorry I don't have time to do it today!\n. @xunhuang: sorry, bugfixes took priority over this, and I only got a chance to look into this now.\n\nTake a look here: https://github.com/pwnall/dropbox-chrome\n\nThe code is not well-structured yet, but it shows how I envision authentication for Chrome extensions. The most important bits of the code are here:\nhttps://github.com/pwnall/dropbox-chrome/blob/master/src/coffee/auth_driver.coffee  (custom auth driver)\nhttps://github.com/pwnall/dropbox-chrome/blob/master/src/coffee/event_page.coffee#L46  (figures out what to do based on auth state)\n\nYou need these two files for the chrome extension auth driver:\nhttps://github.com/pwnall/dropbox-chrome/blob/master/src/html/chrome_oauth_receiver.html\nhttps://github.com/pwnall/dropbox-chrome/blob/master/src/coffee/chrome_oauth_receiver.coffee (compiled to JS)\n\nI would have embedded the JS in the .html file, but Chrome's CSP doesn't like <script> tags.\n\nI'll most likely revisit this in the future, and hopefully I'll make the process easier by getting some of the code into the core dropbox.js source. Until then, I hope this gets you going.\n. @xunhuang dropbox.js 0.8.1 has out-of-the-box support for Chrome extensions. The API changed a little bit, so please take a look at the docs if you decide to use it.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/doc/auth_drivers.md#dropboxdriverschrome\n\nAlso, this is a better example (though still work in progress).\nhttps://github.com/pwnall/dropship-chrome\n\nYou'll probably be interested in:\n- the OAuth HTML: https://github.com/pwnall/dropship-chrome/blob/master/src/html/chrome_oauth_receiver.html\n- the OAuth JS: https://github.com/pwnall/dropship-chrome/blob/master/src/coffee/chrome_oauth_receiver.coffee\n- a very unfinished helper to store the user's identity: https://github.com/pwnall/dropship-chrome/blob/master/src/coffee/dropbox_chrome.coffee\n- uploading to Dropbox with a progress indicator: https://github.com/pwnall/dropship-chrome/blob/master/src/coffee/upload_controller.coffee\n\nI hope this helps!\n. dropbox.js 0.9 has a Dropbox.Drivers.Chrome driver that supports extensions and Chrome packaged applications. Both the legacy apps API and the new API are supported.\n\nI opened #39 to track the wish for a Chrome sample extension.\n. Tweak the redirect driver to display your button when it would do the authentication.\n\n``` javascript\nvar client = new Dropbox.Client({ ... });\n\nvar authDriver = new Dropbox.Drivers.Redirect({rememberUser: true});\nauthDriver.doAuthorize = function (authUrl, token, tokenSecret, callback) {\n  // Find the button that the user would click on.\n  var button = document.querySelector(\"#sign-in-with-dropbox\");\n  // Redirect when the button is clicked. \n  button.addEventListener('click', function (event) {\n    event.preventDefault();\n    window.location.assign(authUrl);\n  });\n  // Display the button.\n  // This code assumes your button starts out with class=\"hidden\"\n  button.setAttribute(\"class\", \"\");\n};\nclient.authDriver(authDriver);\n\n// Kick off the authorization process.\nclient.authenticate(function (error, data) {\n  if (error) {\n    // Auth failed.\n    return;\n  };\n  // It's safe to issue Dropbox requests.\n});\n```\n\nIf you tweak the redirect driver considerably, consider putting your code in a subclass.\n\nDoes this help?\n. You need to call `authenticate` to kick off the process. Is that the missing piece?\n\nI updated the snippet above to reflect this.\n. I forgot to set `rememberUser` on the auth driver. This way, the driver keeps track of everything, and only calls `doAuthorize` when an actual authorization has to happen. Keep in mind that setting `rememberUser` to true has [a few conseqeuences](https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/doc/auth_drivers.md#dropboxdriversredirect)\n. Hi, @350d!\n\nActually, there's a less hacky way of accomplishing this now. `authenticate` supports an `interactive` option:\nhttp://coffeedoc.info/github/dropbox/dropbox-js/master/classes/Dropbox/Client.html#authenticate-instance\n\nIf you use this option, your callback must figure out if cached credentials were used or not. `isAuthenticated` can help.\nhttp://coffeedoc.info/github/dropbox/dropbox-js/master/classes/Dropbox/Client.html#isAuthenticated-instance\n\nHere is how you'd put these together.\n\n``` javascript\n// Try to use cached credentials.\nclient.authenticate({interactive: false}, function(error, client) {\n  if (error) {\n    return handleError(error);\n  }\n  if (client.isAuthenticated() {\n    // Cached credentials.\n    doSomethingCool();\n  } else {\n    // show and set up the \"Sign into Dropbox\" button\n    var button = document.querySelector(\"#signin-button\");\n    button.setAttribute(\"class\", \"visible\");\n    button.addEventListener(\"click\", function() {\n      // Regular authentication.\n      client.authenticate(function(error, client) {\n        if (error) {\n          return handleError(error);\n        }\n        doSomethingCool();\n      });\n    });\n  }\n});\n```\n. @350d does this answer your question?\n. @350d sorry, I can't read my own docs. The option is `interactive`, not `nonInteractive`, to match Chrome's identity API. I updated the example above. Please try again?\n. @350d Glad to hear that! Send me a link when it's ready, if you're allowed.\n. @paulwittmann Thank you very much for the very thorough feedback on the docs! I definitely need some help there.\n\nI think that the example is in the Snippets doc: https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/doc/snippets.md#sign-into-dropbox-button\n\nAm I right? If so, any idea on how I can do a better job of pointing to it?\n\n`rememberUser` is not well-named. I'll most likely change the API in soon. This feedback https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/issues/45#issuecomment-13708661 made me start thinking, as I agree with the pain points.\n\nUntil then, `rememberUser: true` is basically \"I promise I have a button that calls signOut / signOff.\" localStorage is used all the time in the Redirect driver. When `rememberUser` is false, the OAuth access token is not stored in localStorage, so the OAuth redirect flow happens every time users visit your app's page(s). When `rememberUser` is true, the OAuth access token is stored and reused when users re-visit your app. The problem with this is that there's no _obvious_ way for the user to revoke the credentials, e.g. when leaving a shared computer, so apps have to opt into this behavior.\n\nWhen `rememberUser` is true, dropbox.js makes a `getUserInfo` to check whether cached tokens are still valid, because I don't want to tell the app that the user is signed-in, and then force it to go through an auth flow right away. Assuming no bugs in dropbox.js, you should only see one network request to `/account/info`. https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/1a53562f17e7f3e69af6a2ab56e938b62f3c1b96/src/drivers/browser.coffee#L53\n\nIs this what's happening, or are you seeing something else?\n. @paglias, thank you for reporting this issue!\n\nI just tried signing off and back into the Checkbox application myself, and no new app folder was created for me. Does this happen consistently for you? If so, can you try it out on a throwaway account?\n. @paglias sorry for being so slow on this!\n\nI could reproduce the issue with your steps. I forwarded this to the right people, and I'll update this issue as soon as I know if dropbox-js can be changed to fix this issue.\n\nThank you very much!\n. @paglias Please don't close the issue. I think it's a real problem that makes user experience bad, and I would like to keep tracking it.\n\nI talked to the people responsible for this and something is being figured out. I wouldn't count on the issue being fixed in the nearby future though. \n. @paglias cool :) Once again, thank you for reporting the bug!\n. @dworrad I agree with you. I ran into this during a live demo, and it was annoying. I will re-iterate the importance of this to the Dropbox API server team.\n. @dworrad You can also request an extra token and forget about it. As long as there's one active token for the user, the folder -- app connection will stay active. However, that'd make it look like your app is janky, so it's probably not a good solution.\n\nAs I said, I'll try to advocate for fixing this bug again. \n. @350d @dworrad @paglias I talked to someone at Dropbox and a plan is in place. Until that happens, I'll figure out a workaround on the dropbox.js side of things.\n. @350d I will be interning at Dropbox again this summer, and I can assure you that this is something I want fixed! I'll have an ETA soon after I start, ok?\n. @xunhuang, thank you for reporting this issue!\n\nHow did you download and upload? Can you share code / pseudo-code for the XHR calls?\n\nThe best way to avoid encoding issues is to use the XHR2 features for handling binary data, such as `Blob`.\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/XMLHttpRequest/Sending_and_Receiving_Binary_Data\n. Glad you got it figured out, and good luck with your extension!\n. @hc2p thank you for your help!\n\nYou can have different pull requests by creating different branches.\n\n``` bash\ngit checkout master\ngit checkout -b onprogress\ngit reset --hard a213a3a\ngit push -u origin onprogress\ngit checkout master\ngit checkout -b yui\ngit rebase -i HEAD^^\n# remove the line that contains the a213a3a commit, save the file\ngit push -u origin yui\n```\n\nThis should give you your commits on two separate branches. We should go from there. I want those issues fixed, but I don't necessarily agree with the approach in the patches.\n. `long` is not listed as a reserved word in JavaScript.\nhttp://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-7.6.1\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Reserved_Words\n\nFurtheremore, it says reserved words are only relevant when it comes to identifiers. Using `long` as a property name should be fine.\n\nIt seems that the problem is with the Rhino VM used in the YUI compressor. I tried replacing Rhino 1.7R2 with 1.7R4 (the latest release), and the problem still persists.\n\nI looked into the source code, and filed a bug with the Rhino project.\nhttps://github.com/mozilla/rhino/issues/93\n\nAlso, I tried to run the YUI compresser on the un-minified dropbox.js, and it pops up quite a few other errors. If it all possible, I strongly recommend using [uglifyjs2](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2), or its more mature ancestor [uglifyjs](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS).\n. @hc2p Sorry, I'm not trying to make your life hard. I'm currently relying on the CoffeeScript compiler to escape out all the reserved words. I'll still look into this, but I really think that YUI compressor is brittle and should not be used.\n. @hc2p The long problem should be fixed now. I'll look into `onprogress` a bit later, it's a more complex issue.\n. @hc2p I just committed a generic method for hooking into all XHR process.\n\n``` javascript\nclient.xhrFilter(function(xhr) {\n  xhr.onprogress = ...\n});\n```\n\nThis lets you modify _all_ the XHR requests coming out of the client. If you want to modify specific requests, you can do something like this.\n\n``` javascript\nclient.xhrFilter(function(xhr) {\n  xhr.onprogress = ...\n});\nclient.readFile(...);\nclient.xhrFilter(null);\n```\n\nDoes this look reasonable?\n. @hc2p  I'll close this issue, to make my issue-tracking life easier. Please open another issue if this implementation doesn't work for you. Thanks!\n. @hc2p in case you were using this, the next dropbox.js release will require a different syntax for hooking onto XHR requests.\n\n``` javascript\nclient.onXhr.addListener(function(dbXhr) {\n  dbXhr.xhr.onprogress = ...\n  return true;\n});\n```\n\nIf you want to modify specific requests, you'll have to do it like this:\n\n``` javascript\nlistener = function(dbXhr) {\n  dbXhr.xhr.onprogress = ...\n  return true;\n};\nclient.onXhr.addListener(listener);\nclient.readFile(...);\nclient.onXhr.removeListener(listener);\n```\n\nSorry for the inconvenience. I'm moving to a DOM-like event API, because I need events in a couple other places as well, and this looks more standard than the filter business. master was just updated with the new API implementation, so please use it if you'd like to migrate your code early.\n. Updating this Pull Request for consistency -- I added a snippet for using onprogress. It is based on the code fragments posted here.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/guides/snippets.md#progress-indicators\n. Thank you for bringing this up, @toyhunter! It seems that we don't have tests for this, either :(\n\nUntil I fix the documentation, here are some pointers.\n\nWe tested `writeFile` with Blob instances.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/test/src/client_test.coffee#L33\n\nHowever, `writeFile` uses XHR, so it should be able to take ArrayBuffer instances, etc.\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/XMLHttpRequest\n\nHTML5Rocks has a good tutorial on reading local files into Blob instances.\nhttp://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/dndfiles/\nhttp://www.html5rocks.com/en/features/file_access\n\nKeep in mind that you can't read arbitrary files off the user's filesystem. You need to make users select the files in an `<input type=\"file\">` control, or drag-and-drop them into your application.\n. Hi, @ericjang!\n\nI completely agree with you.\n\nUnfortunately, I have almost zero node.js experience -- writing the `dropbox-js` test suite was the first time I used node.js.\n\nIdeally, I'd like a small-ish example that would be useful to people building big apps. Is there something along the lines of Sinatra in node.js? (express.js, maybe?) Where can I read up on best practices for it?\n\nThanks!\n. Thanks, Eric!\n\nI also got a promise from a friend to review my code, so I'll make this happen!\n\nI'm fighting a fire right now, but I'll schedule up some time to take care of the dropbox-js bug queue really soon.\n. @tunix: Sorry! Please understand that this is voluntary unpaid work, so I have a finite bandwidth dedicated to this project. Recently, I've been focused on making dropbox.js usable with Chrome extensions and apps, but that work is wrapping up, and node.js is up next!\n\nTo help out with your planning, I will be working on #28 before putting together a new sample. Bugs before features :(\n\nAlso, any help on this issue would be welcome!\n. @tunix I interned at Dropbox last summer, and that's how dropbox.js got started. I'm still in touch with the API team at Dropbox though, and this is definitely the \"official\" library.\n\nThank you for agreeing to share your code! I would definitely like to see more code samples and learn about the roadblocks that developers are running into.\n\nI think that a driver for express.js will have to follow a similar strategy to the Redirect driver, but use the session or a database instead of localStorage. I'm sorry I'm not able to write that now :(\n. @code, @maxart, thank you for reporting this issue!\n\nI agree that it would be nice to be able to do partial reads from Dropbox. Unfortunately, I don't work at Dropbox anymore (I was a summer intern), so I can't make changes server code.\n\nI have forwarded your request to the appropriate developers. If they decided to add Range support, I'll leave this bug open, to track the dropbox.js support for partial reads. If I close this bug and the API gets support for partial reads, please open a new bug so I'll know to add Range support to dropbox.js.\n\nThank you!\n. @code, @maxart the API server now allows Range and If-Modified-Since.\n\nAlso, I just pushed support for partial reads, by adding the `bytes` option to `readFile`. http://coffeedoc.info/github/dropbox/dropbox-js/master/classes/Dropbox/Client.html#readFile-instance\n\nCan you please take a look and tell me if this seems reasonable? I'd like to include this in the 0.7.1 release of the JS library.\n. @piranna Sorry for being unclear! 'bytes' is an attribute on the options object, and its value is an object with the 'start' and 'length' properties. Does this seem reasonable?\n. I opened #30 to track an API server bug related to HTTP headers.\n. @piranna  Sorry I didn't understand what you meant earlier! This is exactly the kind of feedback I wanted. `bytes` has the advantage that it can be extended to accept an array of range specs later on, but I think I like `start` and `length` on the main options object better too.\n\nThanks!\n. @piranna HTTP ranges let you do crazy things, according to the spec. However, I was just old that the Dropbox API server doesn't do multiple ranges, so now I think having `start` and `length` on the options object is definitely the right way to go. I committed the change.\n. I opened #31 to track an API server bug related to the If-Modified-Since HTTP header.\n. @code Please beware of #30 though (I know you'll bump into it, because ID3 tags are at the end of a file). You'll have to compute `start` based on the file length in the metadata.\n. @piranna I do default `length` to the file length minus `start` (if specified). However, if `length` is specified, I default `start` to the file length minus `length`, because that's how HTTP ranges work, and because I think this is more useful. For example, if you want to read the last few kilobytes from a file, to scan for ID3 tags, the default I mentioned lets you do that without having to fetch the file's metadata. I hope specifying `start: 0` isn't too much of a pain, in return for having support for end-of-file reads.\n\nI think seeking would make sense in a higher-level API. I wanted to build a higher-level API that would come with built-in caching and object-oriented representations of files and folders, and I saved the `Dropbox` namespace for that. However, I didn't have time to make it happen, and I doubt this will happen anytime soon :(\n. @piranna I don't really like filer.js, because it makes up its own API. I agree that most old-school Unix developers (myself included) will recognize the commands right away, but I have yet to be convinced that most of today's Web developers fall in that category.\n\ndropbox.js roughly follows the node.js API for file access, so at least node.js developers should be familiar with it.\n\nOn the other hand, the Filesystem API is indeed something to look at! If the API doesn't get killed by Mozilla's refusal to implement it, it's worth providing a compatibility layer for it. Then higher-level libraries like filer.js can use that layer and just work.\n\nDoes this seem reasonable?\n. @michote, sorry you're having trouble with dropbox.js!\n\nCan you please provide a reduced code sample so I can take a look?\n. I opened #29 to keep track of enhancing the popup driver. If you encounter any other problems, please open a new issue!\n. @deoxxa, @aredridel, @whiskers75 Thank you for your input!\n\nI added more notes on CoffeeScript, and I added a README into the `lib/` directory. I hope this addresses your concerns.\n\nPlease open new issues if you have more feedback!\n. @terehov Sorry, I don't have any good news so far. I've been focusing on Chrome extensions support up until now. On the bright side, I promise this is the first thing on my list once I shift my focus to node.js.\n\nUnder the hood, we're using a node library that implements the XMLHttpRequest API. The author promised to support XHR level 2 in an upcoming version. Unfortunately, that library hasn't been updated in a while.\n\nIf you can find another library that supports ArrayBuffers (and, ideally, node.js Buffer objects as well), dropbox.js could use it without any modifications -- we do feature detection everywhere. If you can point me to such a library, I'll try running the test suite against it and, if it works, I'll swap it in.\n\nSorry this has taken forever :cry:\n. @terehov The master version of dropbox.js supports binary uploads and downloads on node.js, via Buffers and ArrayBuffers / ArrayBufferViews. Please give it a try!\n. @terehov I released a 0.9.1-beta1 node.js-only update that has binary support, to make it easier for you (and anyone else that might be reading this) to give this a try.\n\nThe price of binary file support is that I had to replace an old and pretty well tested XHR wrapper with a new version that I just wrote. Therefore, testing would be really appreciated!\n. @michote I just committed support for storing the authentication tokens in the Popup driver. It works in the same way as the Redirect driver, by passing the `rememberUser: true` option to the driver constructor.\n\nCan you please try it out and tell me if it looks reasonable to you?\n. @michote Oh wow. GitHub should be ashamed with themselves.\n\nPlease try this instead for now.\n\n``` bash\ngit clone git://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js.git\n```\n. @michote It seems like you're using Ubuntu, and I never tried the build on Ubuntu.\n\nGet the `dropbox.min.js` file from here for now. https://www.dropbox.com/s/4prfxlekmd8z360/dropbox.min.js\n\nI'll try to get an Ubuntu VM and see what's going on later.\n. @michote Thank you for the details! Can you please share the PPA URL with me?\n\nI'm closing this issue because the code seems to work. It will be a part of the 0.7.1 release.\n. @michote Thank you for reporting this issue! dropbox.js is better thanks to you.\n\nI opened #32 to keep track of the build issue that you brought up.\n. As of today, the test is active and it passes.\n. The Dropbox API server is not likely to implement `If-Modified-Since` in the near future, so the `modifiedSince` option was removed.\n. @michote I just built a fresh Ubuntu 12.10 server VM, ran the build instructions in it, and they worked. I'm afraid you probably have a configuration issue on your machine.\n\nThis is how I built the VM: https://github.com/csail/mit6470-vm/tree/master/building\n\nThank you for pointing me to the node.js PPA!\n. @winterlightning Sorry dropbox.js isn't working for you!\n\nHave you tried text file uploading first? I know file:// cripples some of the XHR functionality in Chrome.\n\nIf that fails, can you please post the snippet that you use to get the Blob, or at least some pseudo-code for it?\n\nThanks!\n. @winterlightning You shouldn't use `readAsBinaryString()`, because `writeFile()` will use UTF-8 if you give it a string. Instead, you should give `writeFile()` the `File` instance (`File` is a subclass of `Blob`) and it should be able to upload it for you. If you want to upload a fragment of the file, use the `slice()` method on `Blob` to get another blob.\n\nIf you really want to read the data into memory before passing it to `writeFile`, you can use use `readAsArrayBuffer()`.\n\nDoes this help?\n. MDN says the only way to send binary data is to use the XMLHttpRequest level 2 API (ArrayBuffer, Blob, File).\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/XMLHttpRequest/Sending_and_Receiving_Binary_Data#Sending_binary_data\n\nI'll update the documentation to explain that `writeFile` also takes File instances, as soon as I get some time to write a test for that.\n. @winterlightning Actually, up until a very recent commit, writeFile only worked well with Blob instances. As of now, it can handle Files, Blobs, ArrayBuffers, and ArrayBufferViews. You need your own build for this, or you can wait for the 0.7.2 release.\n. @ssr1ram: have you tried the `downloadHack: true` option with `makeUrl`?\n\nThis method has a small disadvantage: relative URLs won't work in your page, so you have to have to use `makeUrl` whenever you include a script, CSS file, etc., even if they're in the same Dropbox folder as the .html file.\n\nThe disadvantage is only relevant when users write the markup directly. In your case, it seems that your application puts together the HTML page, so you should be able to do the URL translation without your users noticing.\n\nPlease let me know if this works for you!\n. @ssr1ram I'll look into `downloadHack` in a bit. In the meantime, you shouldn't have to downgrade from https to http ever. You can include https links on http sites.\n. @ssr1ram You should put the assets in the users' folders. This way, your users' sites only depend on dropbox.com being up. Also, when you change your application, you won't have to maintain the old versions of the shared assets.\n\nCan you share the lines of code where you use `downloadHack: true`?\nI have a test that's supposed to guarantee that functionality works, so I'd like to make sure the test is broken before I start debugging it.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/test/src/client_test.coffee#L772\n\nThanks!\n. @ssr1ram Sorry this took forever, but it turns out there was a bug in the code, and another bug in the test code was hiding it. :sweat:\n\nI pushed a fix to master, and it will go out in release 0.8.2.\n\nOnce again, sorry for the lag, and thank you for your patience!\n. @ssr1ram I released dropbox.js 0.8.2 which should have the fix to this issue. Please reopen the issue if you're still having problems!\n. @snowfix Thank you for reporting this issue!\n\nThe `writeFileUsingPut` name is misleading, but there is a good reason for using `POST` -- it avoids a CORS preflight in browsers. Also, I wanted to keep the node.js behavior as close as possible to the browser behavior.\n\nWhat object are you passing to `writeFile`?\n\nI hope that `Client.writeFile` in the unit tests always delegates to `Client.writeFileUsingPut` on node.js, so `writeFieUsingPut` should be able to write String instances to text files.\n. @snowfix I'm afraid the problem lies in the node-xmlhttprequest wrapper. The XHR specification doesn't distinguish between POST and PUT, and the code works as intended on the browser. \n\nI'm working on a replacement XHR wrapper for node.js that will support binary files via Buffer and ArrayBuffer.\nhttps://github.com/pwnall/node-xhr2\n\nIn the short run, it probably makes the most sense to keep using your patched version of node.js. I hope to get this library done soon, and I'll make a dropbox.js release that uses it instead of node-xmlhttprequest.\n. @snowfix I think it's better to wait until I make a first stable release, because I'll probably be changing the code like crazy until I get all the features working.\n\nAfter that, definitely go for it!\n. @snowfix I have released 0.9.1-beta1, which is a node.js-only update that supports node.js Buffers and ArrayBuffers. Please give it a try!\n\nnode-xhr2 still needs more work, I haven't added tests for events and network error handling. I think the code for send() is pretty stable though, and you can start looking at figuring out proxy support.\n\nI'm closing this bug. Let's discuss proxy support in the node-xhr2 issue tracker.\n. Thank you for your feedback, Michiel!\n\nThe Dropbox API uses the OAuth1 model that has the client app establish a request token, get the user to authorize the token, and then exchange the request token for an access token.\n\nIf I understand OAuth2 implicit grant correctly, it is a bit different: the user is sent to an authorization page, and then an access token is generated. This flow is much better suited for browser apps, and in an ideal world, dropbox.js would use this flow to get a token from the Dropbox API server.\n\nUnfortunately, the API server only supports OAuth 1 at the moment, so dropbox.js implements that, and tries to insulate developers from the complexities and present an OAuth2-like interface. I will take your feedback as a sign that I'm succeeding at insulating :)\n. Does this seem reasonable? If I'm missing something from the OAuth specs, please let me know!\n. @snowfix I pushed node-xhr2 0.0.5 and dropbox.js 0.9.1-beta2 that depends on it. This fixes the error test I added, and I hope it will make everything work :)\n\nWill you please give it a try?\n. @snowfix do you think we can close this pull request? I'd rather not add the extra handlers if we can get by without them.\n. Thank you very much for this. Please keep filing bugs / fixes as you run into them!\n. Thank you, @kanzure!\n. @nathanathan, thank you for your feedback!\n\nI agree that sync support would be nice to have! I looked into this in early January, and here are my findings:\n- IndexedDB is the way to go; the FileSystem API is Chrome-only, and the Firefox devs said they will not implement it\n- Chrome's IndexedDB implementation doesn't handle blobs yet, so the blob contents has to be turned into binary Strings (on Chrome-only)\n- Chrome's IndexedDB implementation crashes on large strings, so files have to be broken up into blocks; this is probably a good idea anyway\n- Chrome crashes when trying to handle blobs that have 1Gb or more data, so the sync code should use ranged reads (that's probably a good idea for large reads anyway)\n\nI explored this in my Chrome extension for downloading files to Dropbox. These bits might be reusable:\n- IndexedDB wrapper: https://github.com/pwnall/dropship-chrome/blob/master/src/coffee/dropship_list.coffee\n- Uploading code that works well with both large and small files: https://github.com/pwnall/dropship-chrome/blob/master/src/coffee/upload_controller.coffee\n\nI started working on some sync infrastructure in a branch, but I decided to prioritize making dropbox.js not suck in node.js. I hope I'll have time to revisit this.\n. @nathanathan Actually, since you mentioned sharing -- I forgot to mention that I'm also concerned about dealing with the same app opened in multiple tabs. IndexedDB provides transactions, but this still means that the generic sync code has to be careful about storing metadata into memory.\n\nLast, if dropbox.js provides sync, it has to work in both the browser and node.js, so the heavy logic will ideally be decoupled from the storage code, and you should be able to plug in a Filesystem API-based storage driver to replace the default IndexedDB driver.\n\nThank you for pointing me to Cordova! I heard about it before, but I thought it's a company, I didn't realize it's an ASF project. I saw they support WebSQL, so my first attempt would be to use the IndexedDB shim over WebSQL. \nhttp://nparashuram.com/IndexedDBShim/\n\nI haven't tried this out though. I think that when sync happens, the initial implementation will only support IndexedDB on desktop browsers and a database / file-system combination on node.js.\n. @sakthieswar Thank your for filing this bug!\n\nWhat version of IE are you using? I test dropbox.js on IE9 and IE10, so it should definitely work on those.\n\nAlso, are you using dropbox.js 0.9.0 from the CDN, or the master version?\n\nLast, can you see if the sample application works in your IE?\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/pjlfdak1tmznswp/checkbox.js/public/index.html\n. @sakthieswar Can you send me a pointer to your code, or at least the parts that use dropbox.js? My e-mail is on my GitHub profile page.\n. @sakthieswar It sounds like the client isn't authenticated when you make the requests. A common misunderstanding in JavaScript is writing code that looks like this:\n\n``` javascript\nclient.authenticate(function(error) {\n  // error handling\n});\nclient.getUserInfo(function(error, info) {\n  // error handling\n});\n// use info\nclient.readFile(..., function(error, data) {\n  // error handling\n});\n// use data\n```\n\nIn fact, because of the asynchronous nature of XHR, you have to write this:\n\n``` javascript\nclient.authenticate(function(error) {\n  // error handling\n  client.getUserInfo(function(error, info) {\n    // error handling\n    // use info\n  });\n  client.readFile(..., function(error, data) {\n    // error handling\n    // use data\n  });\n});\n```\n\nOf course, you can pull out the main body into a function.\n. @sakthieswar If this doesn't match problem, can you please send me the snippets of code that involve dropbox.js so I can take a look?\n. @PunterSThompson Hi, Stuart!\n\nAre you accessing your page via a `http://` or `https://` link?\n\nIE doesn't let you make XDR calls from `http` to `https`, and the Dropbox API server only allows `https`. \n\nDoes this help with your problem?\n. @sakthieswar Sorry, I got confused by the comment below yours and thought your issue worked out. Yes, can you please use the network monitor in the IE tools to tell me what XDRs get executed?\n\n@PunterSThompson I looked for a while at getting binary downloads / uploads working in IE. I don't think that's possible without server support (i.e. uploading a base64-encoding string and having the server decode it). If I may ask, how do you get binary data, and what is it?\n. Hi, @SimpleAsCouldBe!\n\nI'm assuming that you're referring to this code?\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/issues/19#issuecomment-13117737\n\nWhen the user gets redirected back to your application, your page's state is completely reloaded. This means your code has to distinguish between the case when the user visits your page for the first time, and the case where they come back from the redirect.\n\nThe `interactive: false` option in the `authenticate()` method does that for you. So, if the user has authorized your app, you can start making API calls. If the user hasn't authorized your app, you need to call the authorize a 2nd time when they click the button, to start the redirect process. This is why two authorize calls are necessary.\n\nI'm not sure how to simplify this. The authentication process requires HTTP calls before and after the redirect, so I need you to call some method that allows dropbox.js to do the HTTP call, and that gives it a callback to report to.\n\nWhat do you think?\n. This seems like the 0.9.0 silent auth issue. Did you try this again with 0.9.1?\n. I haven't heard anything in a while, so I'll assume the problem is solved and close this issue. Please file a new issue if the 0.9.2 release still has auth issues!\n. @SimpleAsCouldBe just to make sure, are you using the 0.9.1 release?\n. Can you please try this out with 0.9.1? I changed `authenticate` a bit since 0.9.0.\n. @SimpleAsCouldBe I'm testing a fix. Thank you for reporting this!\n. Can you try building from master?\n\nIf it's hard to set up a build environment, these will be available for a short while:\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/46/dropbox.min.js\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/46/dropbox.js\n. @SimpleAsCouldBe Yes, can you please try the build I linked to, and tell me if you still get duplicate onAuthStateChange events? Thank you!\n. @SimpleAsCouldBe Thank you for testing! This will be released in dropbox.js 0.9.2, which will come out once I figure out a couple of other issues reported here.\n. This took way longer than I thought, but dropbox.js 0.9.2 is out now.\n. Sorry about this omission in 0.9.0 :(\n. This will become irrelevant once the oauth2 branch is merged into master.\n. @Marthyn I haven't tested dropbox.js on Phonegap / Cordova, though I would like to support mobile app platforms at some point. I suspect that you'll have to write a different OAuth driver to get that working.\n\nCan you please put together a minimal project that I can use to play with dropbox.js on Phonegap, and send me links to everything I need to set this up? I can look into this, if you can make it so that it'll take me less than an hour to set everything up and get to dropbox.js debugging.\n. @Marthyn You're running into an Android-specific bug.\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/10802575/network-error-on-page-change-in-android-emulator-with-cordova-phonegap\n\nI just pushed Cordova support to master. https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/doc/auth_drivers.md#dropboxdriverscordova\n\nCan you please give it a try? You can either build dropbox.js or, for a short time, you can also grab a build that fixes this bug here: https://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/49/dropbox.js\n\nAlso, please star the Android bug reports, so the root issue will eventually get resolved.\nhttps://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=17327\nhttps://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=17535\n. dropbox.js 0.9.2 should work under Cordova. Please let me know if that's not the case!\n. The latest master commit makes it possible to do binary uploads using ArrayBuffer and ArrayBufferView instances, and binary downloads using ArrayBuffers. Blob support is busted on Android, and dropbox.js won't be working around the Blob-related bugs at this moment. \n. @paulwittmann Thanks so much for taking time to help me fix the docs!\n\n`Util.encodeKey` is not a public API, so I'd rather that users don't grow to rely on it. Please think of the web form as applying for an additional OAuth 2-style key.\n\nI would like to pull the other change in the docs. Can you please remove the first hunk from the diff? Also, if you prefer, I can do that while I merge.\n. Landed the docs fix in 5eaabbdba46d2a9b9be4525103dabf7850ad9769\n. @aluedeke Sorry about the inconvenience! I haven't tried out dropbox.js in a Web worker.\n\nThe latest master commit should take care of the first issue. I haven't added a test yet, but the browser detection is more careful.\n. @aluedeke I plan to add a test, and I'll leave this issue open until I do that.\n\nRegarding your second wish, localStorage isn't accessible in Web Workers. You'll have to keep serializing credentials using postMessage. Sorry :( \nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/6179159/accessing-localstorage-from-a-webworker\n. The Web Workers tests are blocked on this PR: https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha/pull/780\n. The Web Workers tests are also blocked on this PR: https://github.com/cjohansen/Sinon.JS/pull/255\n. Using the patched libraries mentioned above, the code I just pushed to master passes the Web Worker tests on Chrome, Firefox and IE 10. I will enable the Web Worker tests when the pull requests get pulled.\n. sinon.js made a release including the patch that this bug depends on. The mocha patch is the only problem left.\n. The mocha PR was rejected due to being too large. It seems that a smaller (but more brittle) PR might be accepted. https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha/pull/867\n. @rtfeldman dropbox.js is currently tested in Web workers. This issue is still open to track the fact that the test suite is still using a patched mocha.js to run the tests. Are you running into any Web worker-specific problems?\n. @paulmars Thank you so much!\n. @eantz Thank you for reporting this issue! Can you please gist or inline the log file that npm points to in the error message? I believe it's `D:\\resources\\dropbox\\dropbox-js-master\\npm-debug.log`\n\nThank you.\n. Thank you. I'll take a look at this soon. While I sort this out, you can use this build.\n\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/54/dropbox.min.js\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/54/dropbox.min.map\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/54/dropbox.js\n. I checked in a fix on master. With this fix, I was able to build dropbox.{js, min.js, min.map} on Windows 8 using the latest node.\n\nOnce again, thank you very much for reporting this!\n. @joeriks Thank you for reporting this!\n\nCan you please tell me what browser / OS are you using, and what version of dropbox.js?\n. @joeriks How did you save the file into Dropbox? I used writeFile and readFile, and it came back with charset=UTF-8.\n. @joeriks To clarify, I meant to ask how did you save the file the first time around.\n. @mkotsur Thank you for reporting this issue!\n\nSorry the documentation isn't explicit about this, but `useQuery` only makes sense if you don't have a hash tag in your URL. The parameters appended to the hash tag come from the API server, and changing that is relatively hard.\n\nCan you please explain how this make your life harder? I'll need some arguments if I'm going to make a case for making the API server understand useQuery.\n. @mkotsur, @aluedeke Thank you for confirming this causes problems with Angular. I'll see what I can do to make dropbox.js work well for Angular development!\n. @mkotsur, @aluedeke I'm afraid this will not get fixed.\n\nAngularJS, Backbone, etc. should learn to deal with this situation. A part of the OAuth 2 specification (implicit grant) mandates that the access token info is passed in the URL fragment, using the same URL encoding that the Redirect driver is using above.\n\nSo, once the Dropbox API server supports OAuth 2, we'll end up in this situation again.\n. @bdotdub Thank you very much!\n. Hi, @kitikonti!\n\nThank you for reporting this issue. Can you give me an idea of how your application is structured and what your cache.manifest looks like?\n\nAlso, what browsers have you tested in?\n\nThank you very much!\n. @kitikonti Thank you for all the debugging information. It's great! I'll look at this tomorrow afternoon.\n\nUntil then, here's a general pointer. If you don't use cdnjs, you should deploy dropbox.min.map and dropbox.js in addition to dropbox.min.js. This, together with enabling source maps, will make your debugging life easier on Chrome and Firefox.\n. @kitikonti It's probably faster to do client.read (I'm guessing you'll have to do that down the line anyway) and handle the 404 case. That being said, I can't think of a reason why your code shouldn't work. I will take another look at it some time today.\n. Can you try adding the following section to your `cache.manifest`?\n\n```\nNETWORK:\n*\n```\n. @kitikonti Take your time, no worries, I'll be here :)\n\nGood luck debugging your app! Also, it looks really good so far!\n. Hi, Jake!\n\nCan you please clarify what you mean by \"data that is made public by a particular user\"?\n\nThank you!\n. Hi, Jake!\n\nRight now, the answer is \"maybe\".\n\nFiles: you can use downloadable URLs to share files without authentication. Use `downloadHack` in `client.makeUrl` to get a downloadable link.\nhttp://coffeedoc.info/github/dropbox/dropbox-js/master/classes/Dropbox/Client.html#makeUrl-instance\n\nDirectories: there's no API for downloading an entire directory right now. You can scrape the preview page for the 'download zip' URL, but that's brittle. If your application also creates the public data, you can put together a JSON file with `downloadHack` URLs to all the files in a directory, and use the URL for that file, instead of using the directory's URL.\n\nDoes this help at all?\n. Haven't heard back in a while, closing the issue.\n. @iulian-meghea Thank you for reporting this!\n\nI think the right way to fix this is to implement OAuth 2, which completely gets rid of the request before /authorize. The popup use case can help justify the work required for OAuth 2.\n\nI'll look at the timeline for getting OAuth 2 and figure out what's the best way I can contribute towards fixing this use case. In the meantime, please switch to the Redirect driver if that's possible. Redirect is more robust, so it's the recommended driver for browsers.\n. @iulian-meghea The Popup driver should work much better in dropbox.js 0.10, which uses OAuth 2. Please let me know if this is still a problem!\n. Iulian, thank you very much for taking the time to put together a patch, and I'm really sorry it took me so long to get back to you!\n\nAt best, this option belongs behind a flag. A minor issue is that it causes extra traffic, and some drivers might not need it. \n\nThe major issue however is that the request token that you get might expire if the user doesn't click the button quickly. If that happens, /authorize will take them to the home screen, with a red message that says the session has expired. I'll look into the code to see how long this takes, but it popped up when I was testing things in the past.\n\nI'll try to figure out how long it takes request tokens to expire and get back with more thoughts on this patch.\n. I think that's the way to go. I'd add an option to the Dropbox.Driver.Popup constructor that contains a path to the page that should be displayed while requesting the token. If the page is on the same domain, browsers should allow us to set the window's location. If not, the driver can use postMessage to tell the page the \"/authorize\" link to redirect itself to. I'm not sure cross-popup postMessage works well on IE, and I'm also not sure this case is worth handling at all.\n\nWould you be willing to draft an implementation of this?\n\nIf what you have right now works for you, I'll probably be able to take a stab at this in a week or two.\n. @iulian-meghea Sorry for being silent on this for a long time. The OAuth 2 flows don't have a request before /authorize, so the Popup driver should work as intended once OAuth2 becomes available.\n. Hey, sorry, I pushed the docs update too soon. dropbox.js 0.10 wasn't released yet.\n\nThe timeout issue should not happen on OAuth 2, because there's no network request before the redirect to /authorize happens. Assuming that you've set up your redirect URLs correctly, Popup should work.\n\nPlease let me know if that is not the case!\n. @DavidPratten can you please tell me how you're getting the Dropbox.Stat object?\n\nAlso, can you please this in your Chrome console and tell me what you get?\n\n``` javascript\nnew Date(Date.parse(\"Sun, 07 Apr 2013 23:18:43 +0000\"))\n```\n\nThanks!\n. @DavidPratten I just pushed a fix for this issue on master. Can you give it a try?\n\nIf you'd rather not build it yourself, the links below will work for a short while.\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/62/dropbox.min.js\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/62/dropbox.min.map\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/26/dropbox.js\n. How do I reproduce the problem? Is it the `All changes saved in Dropbox (2013-04-08 12:46:44)` text at the top?\n\nCan you please tell me what shows up when you eval `Dropbox.Util.parseDate` in the console?\n. If I had a dollar for every time Chrome's cache screwed me over... :)\n\nGlad it all worked out in the end! This fix will be out in the next dropbox.js release.\n. This was fixed in dropbox.js 0.10.\n\nThank you very much for making dropbox.js better!\n. @semorrison Thank you very much for the pull request!\n. Thank you very much for letting me know, @haehn!\n\nI'll see how I can help get this fixed.\n. @haehn This is ridiculously amazing! Thank you very much for sharing!\n\nI'm sorry this is moving slowly. Worst case, it should be fixed over the weekend.\n. dropbox.js now has tests covering CORS requests to dl.dropbox.com.\n\nIn node.js, handling the redirects requires node-xhr2 0.0.6. The dependency in package.json will be bumped and will be released in dropbox.js 0.9.3.\n. The tests and npm requirement bump were released in dropbox.js 0.10.\n\nThank you very much for making dropbox.js better, @haehn!\n. @cloudspark I hope you closed the issue because things worked out, not because you're giving up :)\n. This is now fixed.\n. @michote, @nathanpc dropbox.js has some workarounds for Cordova. I tested it on iOS and Android, because that's what I have simulators for. A couple of questions to figure out if I can help:\n1. Is BB 10 out, or is it a developer thing for now?\n2. Do they have an emulator that I can download?\n3. Assuming the answer to 2 is yes, does the problem show up in the emulator?\n\nThanks!\n. @nathanpc Yes, you can implement your own auth driver.\n\nThis file describes the interface. Only the first two methods are mandatory.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/src/auth_driver.coffee\n\nThis might help too.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/doc/auth_drivers.md\n\nSorry, it turns out I won't have time to look at this until the weekend at best :(\n. Thank you so much for catching that!\n. @chrismatheson Thank you for reporting this issue!\n\nCan you please include a link to the page in your webapp where you use dropbox.js?\n\nIf not, can you tell me what auth driver you're using, and what constructor arguments you're using?\n. Try using this to construct the auth driver in line 25 of `main.js`\n\n``` javascript\nnew Dropbox.Drivers.Redirect({rememberUser: true})\n```\n\nKeep in mind that if you do this, you must give the user a way to sign out of Dropbox (actually invalidate the token for your app). If you already have sign out functionality for your app, you should also invalidate the user's Dropbox token when they sign out of your app.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/doc/auth_drivers.md#dropboxdriversredirect\n\nAlso, you don't lines 11-13. Messing with internal variables is bad :)\n\nDoes this work?\n. @chrismatheson Sorry, I've been really strapped for time lately. I skimmed through the code and nothing else jumped at me. Is your app working now? How's cloud9 working out for you?\n. @chrismatheson awesome, thanks for letting me know! I'll look into it sometime this summer!\n. Whew! Sadly, there's not much I can do right now about API server performance.\n\nI'm glad you figured it out!\n. Thank you very much, @pcworld!\n. Hey, @dwiyatci!\n\nSorry, dropbox.js does not currently support synchronous calls.\n\nFirst off, dropbox.js relies on XMLHttpRequest, which was designed for asynchronous use. Using it in a synchronous manner would block the UI thread until the HTTP request completes, which is really bad for the users. On fast Internet connections, a Dropbox API call takes hundreds of milliseconds, so doing a few of those head-to-head means your application's tab would be completely unresponsive for seconds at a time. Most users would think something is wrong with your site, and outright close your tab!\n\nSecond, XMLHttpRequest discourages synchronous use, so some of its modern features (e.g. binary files) are not supported when the library is used synchronously. This means our code and documentation would have to become more complicated to support synchronous calling, which would mostly negate the simplicity advantages of the synchronous call model.\n\nSorry for the bad news!\n\nOn the bright side, there are some JavaScript libraries that can help you get up to speed quickly on asynchronous programming. I strongly recommend [async.js](https://github.com/caolan/async/). Tutorials such as the [html5rocks one](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/async/deferred/) might help as well. If you can afford spending some money (or your company reimburses books) I also recommend [Pragmatic Programmer's book on async JavaScript](http://pragprog.com/book/tbajs/async-javascript).\n\nI might revisit this issue over the summer. I think synchronous XHR would make it easier to learn how to use the library, and might help with debugging. Even if I end up working on it, putting together synchronous tests will take up some time, so please don't block waiting for this to happen!\n. Thank you for reporting this, @pcworld! It is now fixed!\n. Thank you for nit-picking, @pcworld! The issue should be fixed now.\n\nSorry it took me a long time to get to this, I've been unusually busy these past couple of weeks.\n\nPlease keep reporting issues as you find them! :+1: \n. @pcworld Do they have a SDK / simulator that I can test with? If I can figure out a way to make this work with feature detection, I can add a workaround.\n\nThank you!\n. @pcworld, I think GitHub's AJAX submitted this issue twice, it seems identical to #74. Am I missing something?\n. Thank you very much, @vladikoff!\n. Hi, @dwiyatci!\n\nCan you please give me a bit more context? Ideally, if you have the app up somewhere, can you give me an URL?\n\nIf not, can you give me a HAR file of your Network tab?\n\nI have a piece of code that's very similar to yours in the dropbox.js automated tests, and the tests seem to be passing, so your issue depends on some configuration detail (e.g. the setup in your code, or a specific browser version)\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/test/src/client_test.coffee#L1064\n\nThanks!\n. @dwiyatci Thanks for pointing that out! The string heuristic was there before CopyReference got introduced. Now you have to explicitly create a CopyReference out of a string if you want it interpreted as a copy reference, not as a path. The documentation fell out of sync, and I just fixed it.\n. @vladikoff, thank you very much for working on this!\n\nA sample application would be nice. Documentation and tests are really necessary, to make sure I don't break this in the future. If you have the sample app, I might be able to help you put together the tests.\n. If you point me to the code that you're running, I can try to look into it. I'm guessing that Firefox plugins don't store their stuff in localStorage?\n. Thanks for the sample, @vladikoff! Now that the code runs, I'll try to take a look at it this weekend!\n. @vladikoff Sorry I haven't gotten around to testing this yet! Something unexpected came by. I'll try to look at it in the next couple of days.\n\nI know my timing doesn't reflect it, but I'm really happy (and grateful) to get support for Firefox extensions in!\n. @vladikoff Please wait a bit until I merge oauth2 over to master. Also, I can do switch your code for you when I get around to looking at it, if you prefer.\n. @vladikoff I'm finally ready to take a look at this. Can you please merge your commits into one and rebase against master, to make my life easier?\n\nAlso, if you're busy, please let me know, and I can start from here. \n. @vladikoff I had an `except` instead of `skip` for disabling the tests, and for some reason this used to work. The Web Workers tests are now enabled on master, and seem to pass on Chrome and Firefox*.\n- 1 test fails in Firefox due to a bug in XHR not following redirects in Web Workers. Mozilla's bugzilla is down, so I can't find the bug number right now.\n. The spec says ~ shouldn't be encoded.\nhttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849#section-3.6\n\nI'll figure out what to about this in a bit.\n. @ayush-j, thank you so much for reporting this! We'll fix the API server. Please use this in the meantime.\n. @ayush-j Can you please double-check my understanding of the OAuth spec? I don't want to make the API server less compliant with OAuth :)\n\nAccording to my understanding, HMAC signatures are defined in 3.4.2.\nhttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849#section-3.4.2\n\nIt says to use section 3.4.1.1 to figure out the string to be signed.\nhttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849#section-3.4.1.1\n\nThat section says everything needs to be encoded according to section 3.6.\nhttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849#section-3.6\n\n Did I miss something?\n. @ayush-j The API server is fixed now, so this workaround isn't necessary anymore.\n\nThank you so, so much for reporting this bug!\n. @jfromaniello the API does not currently support this, and I don't know of any easy way to implement it. Sorry! :cry: \n. It appears like I won't have an answer for you any time soon, so I'll close this issue.\n\nThe closest you can get to is to upload an empty file `writeFile(\"filename\", \"\", ....)`, call makeUrl, and then upload the real file.\n. @pcworld Thank you so much for reporting this! Please keep reporting any bugs that you find!\n\nThe docstring is fixed in the oauth2 branch, which will be merged into master as soon as the backend bits are ready.\n. @pcworld This bug has been fixed for a while, and coffeedoc.info has been updated. Thank you for all your bug reports!\n. Landed in 7077a8e170e034eb4825d83f03b5b536a2bff207\n\nThank you very much, @pcworld!\n\nThe doc bug in Client#makeUrl is fixed as well. For some reason, coffeedoc.info hasn't been updating for a while :( \n. Thank you so much, @smarx!\n. @karacas thank you for reporting this issue!\n\nAre you using dropbox.js 0.9.2, or a build from master? Also, can you please tell me what version of Cordova you're using, and what version of Android you're testing on? Last, does this issue show up in the emulator, or on a particular device?\n. Thank you for the details! I'll look into this with phonegap 2.8.1.\n. @karacas Sorry, I lost track of this and documented all my progress in another PhoneGap-related bug. https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/issues/106\n\ndropbox.js 0.10.1 and later should work with PhoneGap / Cordova 3.1.0 and later.\n. @karacas dropbox.js 0.10.2 (just released) should definitely work with Cordova 3.1.0. Please let me know if that's not the case, or if you run into any other issues!\n\nThank you very much for reporting, and I apologize for dropping the ball on this for so long.\n. The easiest way is to call client.credentials(), store the object it returns, and use it to construct a new client later. The object is JSON-serializable, so will round-trip through JSON.stringify / JSON.parse.\n\nDoes this work for you?\n. @lucidtech This is a bug, sorry! It is now fixed in master.\n\nPlease use `contentHash` instead of `versionTag`. It's an option on `readdir` and a property of `Dropbox.File.Stat` now.\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/89/doc/classes/Dropbox/Client.html#readdir-instance\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/89/doc/classes/Dropbox/File/Stat.html\n\nIf you'd rather not build it yourself, the links below will work for a short while.\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/89/dropbox.min.js\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/89/dropbox.min.map\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/89/dropbox.js\n\nAlso, you can use the docs here for now. coffeedoc.info doesn't seem to be updating.\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/89/doc/index.html\n\nThank you very much for reporting this bug! Sorry it took me a bit of time to get around to it.\n. @lucidtech Thank you for reporting the issue! This is fixed in dropbox.js 0.10.\n. Right now, dropbox.js has a wrapper over [/delta in the REST API](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/docs#delta).\nhttp://coffeedoc.info/github/dropbox/dropbox-js/master/classes/Dropbox/Client.html#pullChanges-instance\n. Does Bower have a doc page where I can read about what they require?\n\nThank you!\n. Landed in 16c4b1554ede37183ab9c98daebc64feb5db6647\n\nThank you very much, @paglias!\n. @paglias Thank you so much for reporting, for the workaround, and for explanations!\n\n`localhost` is whitelisted for http, as well as `127.0.0.1` and `[::1]`. http is disallowed for every other host name, because we don't want OAuth 2 access tokens to be sent over the wire in plaintext.\n\nI'm working on a fix for the options.\n. @paglias master is now fixed. The `Dropbox.AuthDriver.Redirect` constructor accepts the `redirectUrl` / `redirectFile` options. Can you please give it a try?\n\nIf you'd rather not build it yourself, the links below will work for a short while.\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/93/dropbox.min.js\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/93/dropbox.min.map\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/93/dropbox.js\n. @paglias This bug should be fixed in the 0.1.0-b3 Datastore SDK. Please let me know if it isn't.\n\nYou can get the latest Datastore SDK from here.\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/developers/datastore/sdks/js\n. @baryon, thank you very much for making me aware of how Safari extensions work!\n\nCan you keep using dropbox.js 0.9.2 for now? Were you trying to use datastores?\n\nI hope to have a better answer for you in a few days.\n. @baryon sorry to get back to you so late! I was overly optimistic on the timeline for OAuth changes.\n\nWe set up a landing page for environments where you can't reliably host one yourself. It is\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/1/oauth2/redirect_receiver\n\nDoes Safari allow you to monitor tab URLs? If so, perhaps you can use the fixed page above to get by?\n. @baryon I'm going to close this issue, because i haven't heard from you in a while. Please open a new issue if you want to resume this conversation at some point in the future.\n. @350d I'm really sorry, but I lost all the context for this, and it'd be quite impractical for me to try to remember all this. Can you perhaps turn to StackOverflow for help?\n. @350d The point of opening up this discussion on StackOverflow is that you may find other people who can offer help. At this time, I don't have the resources to help you.\n\nSome details: I am currently not affiliated with Dropbox (you can see that I don't have a \"contributor\" badge next to my comments), so this would have to come out of my personal time. Unfortunately, I'm in a time crunch right now, as I'm wrapping up my PhD thesis.\n\nI'm sorry I can't help, and wish you good luck!\n. Landed in 70f6ccd235c3b24738c361fc592972020185aa91\n\nThank you very much, @vladikoff!\n\nAlso, I promise I didn't forget about #79 :)\n. @baryon Thank you very much for your question!\n\nI added a snippet for tracking the download / upload process.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/guides/snippets.md#progress-indicators\n\nYou should not need to modify DropboxXhrRequest or DropboxXhrIeMode. They're set by the feature detection code in https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/src/util/xhr.coffee\n\nIf you see a case where they're incorrectly set, please let me know!\n\nDoes the snippet answer your question?\n. Thank you for the feedback and for the research, @vincentlaucy!\n\ndropbox.js is layered on top of an XMLHttpRequest emulation in node.js because I wanted to maximize code sharing across platforms. I'm worried that having separate code paths for node.js will make it more likely that bugs will go undetected.\n\nThat being said, if I am shown that XMLHttpRequest emulation layer has an impact on performance, I will reconsider the design.\n\nIf the only perf issue is streaming, I think that the best solution would be to implement the W3C streaming proposal in [node.xhr2](https://github.com/pwnall/node-xhr2) and add a `stream` option to `readFile`.\nhttps://dvcs.w3.org/hg/streams-api/raw-file/tip/Overview.htm\n\nHow does that sound?\n. Landed in 3fc5c5798f1c38e4ea3c04c3601a0b41ca0610dc\n\nThank you very much @fatihacet!\n. @lucho870601, @nathanpc, thank you very much for the thorough report!\n\nIt seems like you're using an older version of dropbox.js (0.9.2, perhaps?) in combination with the documentation for the latest release (0.10.0).\n\nCan you please give this a try again, with the 0.10.0 release? If you're already using 0.10.0, can you please let me know, and I'll look into this further?\n\nI apologize for the confusion. 0.10.0 introduced some API breakage, for the first time in the history of dropbox.js, and I didn't do a good job of advertising this change. I have started thinking about how I'll do a better job in the future, and the `stable` branch is a first step in that direction.\n\nThank you very much for your patience!\n. @lucho870601, thank you very much for the thorough bug report!\n\nI think the problem that you're experincing is in the `vendor.sh` file in the sample folder. It pulls dropbox.js 0.9.1 from cdn.js, which doesn't work with the updates instructions in dropbox.js 0.10.\n\nCan you please try out the sample code in the master branch? (or aa958ac97e171c5cf28c4bd7d54452d37a6f2712)\n. @lucho870601 It seems like you're using `http://localhost:8000/` as your redirect URL. Have you listed it in your app's [App Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps) page?\n. @lucho870601 Thank you for getting back to me! I hope that dropbox.js will be able to offer more help with the OAuth 2 setup in the future, and I'll close this issue for now. Please let me know if you run into any other problem!\n. @Blumi can you please try removing the \"return\" in the listener function?\n. @Blumi weird. Can you share your code with me, by any chance? My e-mail is in my GitHub profile.\n. @Blumi, @lucidtech, we had issues answering OPTIONS requests on readFile and writeFile for a short while. I don't think that adding a progress listener should impact whether CORS preflight happens or not.\n\nI'm glad everything works now :) If you can think of the root cause, I can try to write a test for it, to make it less likely that we re-introduce the bug.\n. @janesconference does the stackoverflow answer meet your needs?\n. It seems like GitHub created two issues out of one. This looks identical to #104. Please let me know if I'm missing something!\n. @auramo Sorry dropbox.js is causing you trouble!\n\nThere are some Cordova-related fixes in master, which will be released in dropbox 0.10.1.\n\nUntil then, do you want to give this build a try, and see if it works for you?\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/93/dropbox.min.js\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/93/dropbox.min.map\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/93/dropbox.js\n\nThank you!\n. @auramo sorry to get back to you so late. Cordova is still giving me some trouble, but I think this build should work on 2.9 and below. Can you please give it a try?\n\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/108/dropbox.min.js\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/108/dropbox.min.map\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/108/dropbox.js\n\nFWIW, it \"mostly\" works on Cordova 3.0.0. The In-App Browser remains open after the user goes through the OAuth flow. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-4586\n. @auramo Yeah, this is where I got stuck as well. The OAuth flow completed, but the window won't go away. If you do \"adb logcat\", you might observe the same issue that I did.\n\nAre you using Cordova 3.0.0, or a 2.x build?\n. @auramo, @ginaluca There was a bug in the Android version of the In-App Browser plugin that was fixed after the 3.0.0 release. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-4586\n\nI think the Cordova CLI tool pulls the most recent plugin versions from the repositories, so if you have updated your plugins, the driver in dropbox.js 0.10.1 should work.\n\nOnce Cordova 3.1.0 is released (next week, supposedly), I will re-test everything. I hope that Cordova 3.1.0 and dropbox.js 0.10.1 / 0.10.2 will work together seamlessly.\n. My tests worked on Cordova 3.1.0.\n. Cordova 3.1.0 should definitely work with dropbox.js 0.10.2.\n\nThank you very much for reporting, @auramo, and please let me know if you run into any other issues with dropbox.js!\n. @nathanpc Is this still happening? We had a brief outage around that time :(\n. @nathanpc I haven't heard anything from you in a while, so I'll assume everything is OK now. Please open new issues if you run into problems while using dropbox.js!\n. Sorry @saverchenkov, it took me a while to get to this! I committed a fix to `master`. Can you please give it a try?\n\nHere's a build.\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/108/dropbox.min.js\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/108/dropbox.min.map\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/108/dropbox.js\n. This fix shipped in in dropbox.js 0.10.1. Thank you very much for reporting, @saverchenkov, and please let me know if you run into any more problems!\n. @boushley Sweet! Nice to know what actually happened.\n\nI am in the process of merging your change. I'm trying to make sure the PR will be closed as a \"Merge\" not as a \"Close\". I should be done sometime tonight. \n. @boushley Once again, thank you very much for this! I will merge your code right after you address the small two nits I commented on.\n. I merged this into `master`. I hope GitHub is only acting up  because this repo's default branch is `stable`, and that the PR will be closed when I merge `master` into `stable`, which will happen when I release dropbox 0.10.1.\n\nOnce again, thank you very much for the thorough debugging and patch, @boushley!\n. I released dropbox.js 0.10.1, and GitHub finally picked up the merge.\n\nThank you very much for the bug and for the fix, @boushley!\n. Hi, @JZL003!\n\nClient#readdir returns entry names relative to the path that you give it, just like fs.readdir in node.js. When you pass the paths to makeUrl, they have to be absolute. Try `client.makeUrl(\"/music\" + \"/\" + entries[z],` on line 8 of your sample code.\n\nDoes this work for you?\n. @joshuairl, here is a code snippet.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/test/src/client_test.coffee#L644\n\nHere are the underlying methods.\nhttp://coffeedoc.info/github/dropbox/dropbox-js/stable/classes/Dropbox/Client.html#resumableUploadStep-instance\nhttp://coffeedoc.info/github/dropbox/dropbox-js/stable/classes/Dropbox/Client.html#resumableUploadFinish-instance\n\nAnd here are the two methods in action, in the \"Download to Dropbox\" Chrome extension.\nhttps://github.com/pwnall/dropship-chrome/blob/master/src/coffee/upload_controller.coffee#L105\nhttps://github.com/pwnall/dropship-chrome/blob/master/src/coffee/upload_controller.coffee#L127\nhttps://github.com/pwnall/dropship-chrome/blob/master/src/coffee/upload_controller.coffee#L142\n\nDoes this help?\n. @joshuairl, I haven't heard from you in a while, so I'll close this issue. Please open new issues if you run into more bumps while using dropbox.js!\n. Hi, @borisjockov!\n\nAt the moment, Dropbox does not allow http: OAuth redirect URLs. (there is one exception, for localhost, because that doesn't cause the authorization data to be transmitted across a network).\n. @benweet If you serve your page over plain http, an adversary can do a man-in-the-middle attack and inject JavaScript that leaks the token your page receives. Unfortunately, just because the fragment isn't sent to the server, that doesn't make a Web app served over http secure. Because of this issue, we decided to disallow \"http\" completely in OAuth 2.\n\nOAuth 1 will be deprecated, and I expect that it will not be supported in a future version of the API.\n\nI personally recommend taking a look at [StartSSL](http://www.startssl.com/). Their UI is not great to say the least, but they do offer free SSL certificates, so you can get https for your site.\n\nDoes this help?\n. @benweet I just took a look. The UI is slick, I like it! Please let me know if you run into any other road bumps with dropbox.js, I'd be happy to help!\n. Thank you for reporting this, @Blumi!\n\nYou're not doing anything wrong. IIRC, the text in the OAuth window is static. I'll forward this to the right people.\n. Thank you, @varenc!\n. @borisjockov Updating without triggering notifications is possible. I haven't implemented because I can't unit-test. I'll try to prepare a custom build for you today. If that doesn't happen, it will, sometime really soon.\n\nI will look into updating files without creating revisions. If that doesn't work, you could cheat by writing to a backup file, like Office does.\n. @borisjockov Sorry, I spoke too soon. The backend, as it is right now, does not allow updates without notifying the desktop client. The only suggestion I can think of right now is to use Datastores instead. I am aware that the change would entail a significant amount of effort, so this is not a real answer. I hope to have a better answer in the future.\n. @zefhemel I updated the Chrome drivers to follow the latest chrome.identity API. Can you try master, or the build below?\n\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/116/dropbox.min.js\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/116/dropbox.min.map\nhttps://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/jprrh9clkci3lvn/dropbox.js/bugs/116/dropbox.js\n\nYou don't need any OAuth receiver HTML or JS, and it should be safe to remove the `client.authDriver` call as well.\nDocs: https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/guides/builtin_drivers.md#dropboxauthdriverchromeapp\n\nThanks!\n. @zefhemel, @anthonyromano it's `https://your-extension-id.chromiumapp.org/`\n\nThis is what the [identity API](http://developer.chrome.com/apps/app_identity.html#token2) wants.\n\nFWIW, I hope to have an easier way of setting up your redirect URLs in the nearby future.\n. @anthonyromano You have to edit your app's OAuth redirect URL list, and add an URL that looks like `https://your-extension-id.chromiumapp.org/`. You can get your extension ID by eval-ing `chrome.runtime.id` in the Dev Tools console for the extension's background page.\n\nAlso, your production extension ID will be different from the development one. You should lift the production ID from the Chrome Store URL for your extension, and add the proper OAuth redirect URL to your app before publishing the extension.\n\nThank you for bringing this to my attention! I can make the debug setup easier, but I can't do anything about the production ID, asides from documenting the setup process.\n. @anthonyromano Thank you for debugging! I edited my comments above to include the trailing slash.\n\nSorry we're so picky :/ The problem is, any bit of leeway that seems fine now might turn into an exploit given the right combination of platform-specific bugs, so everyone is really better off if we're as strict as possible. Once you get your app working, you know there won't be any redirect URL-related hacks to worry about.\n\nIn an ideal world, all this setup would be done for you. I planned some dropbox.js patches that will get us close to that ideal, but haven't had time to code them up. In the meantime, I'm glad you got your app working, and thank you for posting your experience here to serve as inspiration to other developers!\n. @pmarinov can you please open a new issue? This issue is about modern apps, and isn't solved yet, so I don't want  the people involved to stop paying attention to the comments thread.\n\nLegacy apps have the `chrome.tabs` API, so the `ChromeExtension` driver from the build above should work for you. Can you give it a try please? Let me know how that works in the new issue that you open, and we'll go from there.\n. The fix here shipped in dropbox.js 0.10.2.\n\nThank you very much for reporting, @zefhemel, and please let me know if you run into any other issues with dropbox.js!\n. Thank you very much, @ginaluca!\n. Sorry this caused you trouble!\n`new Dropbox()` will throw an informative error in the next release. \n. @visionmedia If you give the token to a `Dropbox.Client`, it should not bother you about OAuth.\n\nhttp://coffeedoc.info/github/dropbox/dropbox-js/master/classes/Dropbox/Client.html#constructor-instance\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/test/src/fast/client_test.coffee#L289\n\nSorry the docs are unclear / insufficient. This grew library organically, and it's not as well-organized as I'd like it to be.\n\nCan you please tell me what docs you read, so I can think of a place to document this?\n. Oh, Safari :(\n\nFor the record, Safari folks were wrong to disable localStorage, because this makes it trivial to fingerprint their private browsing mode.\n\nI saw they made an argument along the lines of \"localStorage promises persistence, but private browsing discards all data, so implementing localStorage would be lying\", but browsers are generally free to discard localStorage data, so mehh. Also, I was hoping they'd leave sessionStorage alone, and I'd be able to fall back to that, but it doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nI'll write code for falling back to cookies, and I plan to test it on the stock Safari in Mavericks.\n. @ohler master passes tests in Safari on Mavericks with \"Private Browsing\" enabled.\n. Please don't close this issue until dropbox.js 0.10.2 is released :)\n. This fix shipped in dropbox.js 0.10.2.\n. @scorpiontahir02 Did you figure out the problem? I see you closed the issue.\n\nI would guess that you're getting the 403 because you haven't set up the OAuth Redirect URI in your application's configuration page on the Dropbox developers site.\n. Can you please put the code in a gist, so its indentation would be preserved?\n\nAlso, can you please include the error's stack trace by any chance?\n. Sorry about that!\n\nI'm behind on the documentation for the new auth drivers. In the meantime, if you have a specific piece of auth driver code, I can try to help you with that.\n. Weird... I clicked on the Client link and got to the page below, which seems to have a method listing.\nhttp://coffeedoc.info/github/dropbox/dropbox-js/master/classes/Dropbox/Client.html\n\nCan you please give me some details about what you're seeing?\n. Also, if coffeedoc.info is acting up for some weird reason, and you have the repo cloned on your machine already, you can generate your own copy of the docs.\n\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/guides/development.md#documentation\n. Codo is being rewritten, perhaps that had something to do with it. Sorry for the trouble :(\n. I'd be happy to help, if you run into any issues. Please reach out any time!\n. @visionmedia I did not know that. Thank you! I'll prepare a patch soon.\n\nThis is an API-breaking change, so it will come out in a 0.11 release, but you can use it as soon as it hits master.\n. @visionmedia I pushed a fix to master.\n\nThank you for making the API better!\n. Thank you for bringing this up! I haven't figured out how to integrate with promises, though they've been on my mind for a while.\n\nreaddir shouldn't pass the client to the callback. If it does, it's a bug :(\nhttp://coffeedoc.info/github/dropbox/dropbox-js/master/classes/Dropbox/Client.html#readdir-instance\n\nThe idea was to have the callback give you a list of entries in the result arg, like readdir in node.js, and more metadata in other args that can be ignored. Given the promise thing, it might make more sense to leave readdir work exactly like the node.js version, and ask callers to use a different method if they want more data.\n. Oh wow this is pretty terrible. I'll look into it right away.\n. Rather than copying the thumbs, you can use makeUrl with downloadHack: true.\n. Yeah, `thumbnailUrl` has the security issue you mentioned since the switch to OAuth 2. A solution is being worked on.\n. Right :(\nI guess it's a tradeoff, for now.\n\nOn the bright side, if you fetch files and put them in your own store, you're not restricted to the sizes / formats in the Dropbox API.\n\nI'll reiterate the importance of figuring out thumbnailUrl to the Platform folks at Dropbox.\n. thumbnailUrl now generates correct URLs on node.js, so the initial issue here is fixed. The security issue is separate and still present :(\n. Sorry, no good news yet :(\n. What is `me`? Where does `me.folder` come from?\nCan you `console.log` the values of `me.filename` and `me.folder` before calling `writeFile`?\n\nAlso, you shouldn't need to use `FileReader`. You can pass `Blob` and `File` instances to `writeFile` directly.\n. @CareyJWilliams Thank you very very much for letting me know!!\n\nAlso, sorry it took me such a long time to get to this.\n\nThe example app needed a configuration update. Once I did that, it started working. For your own copy, you'll need to add the right OAuth redirect URI to your application's page in the [app console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps).\n. @CareyJWilliams Thank you very much for letting me know! Please open a new issue if you run into any other problem!\n. @scorpiontahir02 \"Just fails\" isn't very helpful. Can you please include the error message that you see in Firebug and the stack trace?\n. @scorpiontahir02 I haven't heard back in a while, so I'm going to close this issue. Please open a new issue if you're still having trouble!\n. @sharepad If you use the Cordova driver, you should add the following URL.\n\n```\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/1/oauth2/redirect_receiver\n```\n\nI somehow forgot to add the URL to the guide about OAuth drivers. Sorry!\n. @sharepad Is the white screen what your application had to display in the first place? I'm not sure \"alert\" works in Cordova.\n. I haven't heard back in a while, so I'm going to close this issue. Please open a new issue if you're still having trouble!\n. @patchi8 Can you please check your code for the issue I mentioned on StackOverflow and report back?\n. `events.js` is not in the dropbox.js codebase, I'm not sure I can help you that much. Can you include a stack trace?\n\nIt seems like you're trying to start a server that uses a certain port (HTTP server?) twice.\n. @Joshua-S can you give me more details? This isn't very much to work off of :)\n. Perhaps you can put together a reduced test case by slashing most of the code that doesn't work with dropbox.js? I'd happy to look at that, or at your app if you have it up somewhere.\n. I'm trying to figure out how to run this and get to the Dropbox integration. I can't find it on the version on the site, or in the repo. Do I absolutely have to run this in Firefox OS, or can I run it in a Web browser as well?\n. Ah, cool, I was setting `window.onerror = null;` in the console.\n. I can't see the cause right away. An easy way to shed more light into this would be to rename your `cloud/dropbox.js` to something else, and copy the `dropbox.js` and `dropbox.min.map` that match your version of dropbox.min.js.\n\nAlso, this is 0.9.something, right? Any reason why you're not using the newer version that work with OAuth 2?\n. What I found so far is that the error happens when an XHR error occurs, and the client tries to call the custom error handler that you've set up.\n\nYou have one sketchy line of code in `cloud.js`\n\n``` javascript\nwindow.dispatchEvent(cloud.dropbox.auth.onAuth);\n```\n\nI'm willing to bet that causes some sort of trouble. dropbox.js doesn't use DOM events, so it's not meant to be used with `dispatchEvent`.\n\nIn any case, you should definitely copy the source map and un-minified dropbox.js in the same directory as dropbox.min.js. Debugging against minified code is really really painful.\n\nLast, are Firefox apps downloaded and cached on the device, like Chrome apps? If so, it might not be worth carrying around the minified version at all.\n. @Joshua-S I haven't heard back in a while, so I'm going to close this issue. Please open a new issue if you're still having trouble, and I'll be happy to help!\n. @amotion Thank you very much!! Landed as 0dbfc00ad3cc44359bfdf9d53f1d0e49e296ea88\n. @Blumi Thank you for reporting this!\n\nFWIW, this has no consequences other than the annoying console output. The XHR wrapper in dropbox.js tries to read the X-Dropbox-Metadata header all the time, and the header isn't whitelisted in the CORS heades sent by the backend server that `pollForChanges` uses.\n\nI'll sit on this for a while. I don't like making the Xhr wrapper more complicated for the sake of one method, but I do understand it must be annoying to have these warnings fill up your console.\n. @Blumi If you find a concrete negative side-effect, I would really appreciate it if you took the time to report it! It'd be enough to justify the extra complexity in the XHR wrapper.\n. @subblue Any chance you could post a reduced case?\n\nI have a unit test for calling writeFile with Blob objects and it passes on Safari. So either there is something special about your Blob (tainted canvas?) or my test case is busted.\n. @subblue Alternatively, if you have your app up somewhere, I can take a look.\n. @subblue I haven't heard from you in a while. If you still have this problem and can provide some data, please open a new issue, and I can try to help you debug.\n. @colinmegill I'm having a hard time understanding what you're asking for.\n\nDo you want the build output checked into the repository? If so, can you please tell me what your use case is, and why can't you use the cdnjs builds?\n. @colinmegill Also, FWIW, the FAQ point that you refer to states that the source code will remain CoffeeScript. Unfortunately, this deters some people from contributing to the repository. It has nothing to do with build products, which are JavaScript.\n. @colinmegill Ahh... I see your point now.\n\nThank you for bringing this up! I'll revise the README in `lib/` to state that the directory is empty in the repository, and you have to run the build process to get it.\n\nSomeone brought up bower before. I don't have a good story for it. I disagree with their suggested approach of having build products in the repository. I like the solution that Zurb foundation uses -- they have a build repository that mirrors the source repository and is automatically updated. If enough people complain, I might try to set that up, but right now I'm hoping that either bower or what comes after it figures stuff out.\n\nLast, you mentioned you use npm. The npm package `dropbox` should have all the build products in `lib/`, so you can use that and reach into `node_modules/dropbox/lib` to serve them. I understand it's not a general solution though... if bower manages all your frond end, special-casing dropbox.js is questionable.\n. I tried to improve the comments in `lib/README.md` and added an FAQ entry for serving dropbox.js from a server. I hope these help. I really don't like the idea of checking build products into this repository, but I'll look into automatically keeping a build repo in sync, if the demand is high enough.\n\nThank you for reporting, @colinmegill!\n. @ramRkanna Can you please tell me what documentation did you follow to get to that code? It's missing a piece, and it's not the simplest method. If it's in the dropbox.js docs, I'd like to get it fixed.\n\nYou should start with the easiest possible method, and only try something more advanced after you got that working.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/guides/getting_started.md#shared-code\n. @ramRkanna, @mendrik You're not supposed to pass in `interactive: false` if you want the OAuth 2 process to happen. That option says \"if localStorage contains an OAuth 2 token, use that; otherwise, do not start the OAuth 2 process\". It's useful if you want to display a \"Sign in with Dropbox\" button only when necessary. If you're going to do a Dropbox operation in the callback, you should not use `interactive: false`.\n\nDoes this help?\n. @mendrik If you have the token, you shouldn't need any of the other options. Also, `sandbox` was completely removed, so you don't need it in any case.\n. This looks resolved. Please open a new issue if I'm wrong.\n. @ramRkanna If you're only targeting Google Chrome, or Android 4.4 and above, you can try out the filesystem API. It has a pretty low adoption, but if it works for your audience, it might give you more space to work with.\n\nDon't store media in localStorage... it's synchronous, so it'll make your whole app jank :/\n\nYou should be able to use `writeFile` and `readFile` with one of the binary options (`arrayBuffer` or `blob`... I think `arrayBuffer` has better support on older Android versions, but you'd have to check). Please let me know if you go down this path and run into any issues!\n. TL;DR: the libraries can share the namespace. For best results, load dropbox.js last.\n\nThis should work. Please file bugs if it doesn't. We have an informal agreement on dividing the Dropbox namespace, so no naming conflicts should ever happen.\n\ndropbox.js has a bit of special code that makes sure it will coexist with the saver JS, as long as dropbox.js is loaded last. If dropbox.js is loaded first, the saver would have to take similar precautions to make sure both libraries will share the Dropbox namespace, and I don't have a test for that case.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, the Saver renders that nice UI server-side. I would like to have something similar available for dropbox.js, either in the core library or as a sibling project, but it's non-trivial, and I don't have the time to do it right now.\n\nAlso, dropbox.js requires a different API key, authorization, and production approval, so you'll have to do some mental juggling if you use both in the same application.\n. @iangilman At the moment, `writeFile` uses [files_put](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/docs#files_put) or `files [POST]`(https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/docs#files-POST), depending on the browser. `resumableUploadStep` and `resumableUploadFinish` use chunked uploads, if you need to go above 150MB. It would be nice to have `writeFile` automatically use resumableUpload when necessary, so please open an issue if you run into this problem.\n. I added #145 to track the wish for a Chooser / Saver UI for dropbox.js applications. Thank you very much for your feedback, @iangilman!\n. The project is still maintained. Some technical debt is preventing me from making a release and taking in new code.\n\nAsides from that, this specific PR lacks test changes, so it'll have to wait until I find some time to reorganize the `/delta` tests.\n\nThat being said, `path_prefix` is very useful, especially for Full Dropbox applications, so this PR will be merged some time, hopefully soon.\n. @AnalogJ thank you very much for your fix, and I'm sorry I got around to it so late.\n\nI rebased your commit on top of master, and landed it here https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/commit/eb6e8b50de82cdb2b24c6267c817c35ee8433790\n\nOnce again, thank you very much for your fix!\n. @patchi8 Is any other SDK doing OAuth under these circumstances?\n\nI'm sorry, but supporting Windows 8 under Cordova doesn't look good from a cost/benefit perspective. If you can point me to another library that does OAuth 2 under Windows 8 / Cordova, the cost might get low enough that I'd implement that library's method. However, I wouldn't be testing the configuration on a regular basis until the benefits (market share / reach) look better.\n. @braincore Thank you very much for this PR! I'll take a look at it later tonight. Is this documented anywhere? \n. @braincore I'll ping you over e-mail.

I fixed that behavior, so that good old feature detection will work again.\nhttps://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?revision=243817&view=revision\n. @rlmcneary2 dropbox.js 0.10.3 was just released and includes the fix I mentioned here.\n\nThank you for reporting this bug!\n. @lavelle Can you please see if your issue shows up on a desktop Chrome / Chromium build?\n\nAlso, what's the easiest way for me to test this? Presumably, I'd get ChromiumOS running in a VM?\n. I finally figured out a better way to get rid of the warning, and committed it to master. If you're still interested in this issue and want to test a build off master, please let me know.\n. @rlmcneary2 The Chrome drivers use chrome.storage.local.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/src/auth_driver/chrome.coffee#L47\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/src/auth_driver/chrome.coffee#L63\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/src/auth_driver/chrome.coffee#L75\n\nThey only touch localStorage because they inherit from BrowserBase.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/src/auth_driver/chrome.coffee#L6\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/src/auth_driver/chrome.coffee#L14\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/src/auth_driver/browser.coffee#L28\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/src/auth_driver/browser.coffee#L212\n\nThis has the unfortunate side-effect that you get the confusing warning in the Chrome console. The version on master is restructured so it won't touch localStorage at all.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/commit/9432a8a27b0f759eaa2b338fd337a6b22666a871\n. @rlmcneary2 Sorry for the confusing message. That's totally my fault. I hope I'll be able to release 0.10.4 soon, so nobody else has to go through this :cry: \n. @talha-asad sounds reasonable.\n\nIn the meantime, you can look at the docs for Dropbox.Client.\nhttp://coffeedoc.info/github/dropbox/dropbox-js/master/classes/Dropbox/Client.html\n\nFor example, here's `/metadata`.\nhttp://coffeedoc.info/github/dropbox/dropbox-js/master/classes/Dropbox/Client.html#metadata-instance\n. @figalex Nope, but you do have to write (mostly) your own authentication code. I started working on a node.js sample last summer, and realized that the AuthDriver API doesn't work well for server-side programming.\n\nHere's what I have so far, in case it helps before I get around to putting together a proper server-side API.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/node-sample/samples/node-netsend/src/dbx_middleware.coffee\n. @figalex What do you mean by \"throws an error\"? Does the error get passed to the callback, or is it really thrown? Can you share a call stack?\n\nSorry about this trouble. The negative authorization paths are not covered by tests, so they're more likely to break at the moment :(\n. I went for `POST` because it's less likely to trigger a CORS preflight request. Preflights are evil because they delay the main request by a full round-trip, so there's quite a bit of logic in dropbox.js for avoiding them whenever possible.\n\nI think chunked uploading still triggers CORS preflights, but using a `POST` gets us one step closer to getting rid of them.\n. @robertknight Can you please give me more details about this? How do I get to see the error?\n\nIs it sufficient to try to run browserify on dropbox.js, or do I need a sample app?\n\nIf the latter is the case, can you please set up a GitHub repo with a minimal application that shows the problem?\n\nI don't have enough information yet, but I think that patching dropbox.js to use the browserify `require` would be sub-optimal. The XHR code in dropbox.js is carefully crafted to work around browser incompatibilities, so it'd be better to have dropbox.js recognize that it's running in a browser than to have it use `node-xhr2` on top of browserify's shim for the `http` library in node.js.\n. The [dropbox.js launch post](https://tech.dropbox.com/2012/08/some-love-for-javascript-applications-2/) describes how the library got created. In a nutshell, it started out as a Hack Week project.\n\nI was supposed to figure out what needs to happen to turn this into an officially supported library last summer, but didn't manage to do that before my internship ran out. Sorry :/\n\nThat being said, the library is fully documented, has pretty strong automated tests, and is available via npm and cdnjs. Is there something missing that you think you'd get in an official release? If so, please open specific issues, and I'll do my best to cover the gaps. Thank you!\n. Cordova is a development dependency, because it is needed to run the Cordova tests. It is not a runtime dependency. You should be able to use dropbox.js in a node 0.6 application.\n\nDoes `npm install` fail when you run it in a dropbox.js checkout, or when you run it in another package that has dropbox.js a dependency?\n. @zenorocha Thank you very much!\n. @cirocosta Thank you!\n. Sorry for taking so long to respond to this. I was hoping I'd find the time to address it properly.\n\nI need a failing test to be able to justify this change. In this case, I'd need to set up a Browserify build, and have the test suite run against it.\n\nUnfortunately, I can't spend the time I'd need to make it happen. On the bright side, you can help me cut down on that time, to a point where I can afford fixing it.\n\nIf you can point me out to the precise instructions that you use to package dropbox.js with Browserify, it'd cut down on the amount of time I'd need to spend setting this up.\n\nIt'd be extra awesome if you can add a Browserify build to the `Cakefile`. These files should be useful if you decide to look into that path.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/tasks/build.coffee\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/tasks/test.coffee\n. @moszeed See my comment above for what needs to happen for this to get merged.\n. @rtfeldman Sorry, I've been really swamped. Will take a look soon and make comments.\n. @brandonb927 Thank you!\n. @kchang4 What environment (browser version / node.js version, etc) are you experiencing this in?\n\nAlso, does the application halt precisely until you get the response from the server, or is the hang shorter / longer?\n\ndropbox.js only uses asynchronous XMLHttpRequests.  I suspect that the glitch you're seeing is due to a large buffer getting copied over. I think the current code causes more copying than it needs to, mostly because this hasn't been an issue in the past.\n. So you're using this writeFile in node.js code, not in browser code, is that correct?\n. Hi @jamarolo,\n\nAs far as I know, the datastore SDK is not published as an npm package. Also, I'm not sure it is tested in node.js. If it is tested, it is most likely that the tests use the same infrastructure as dropbox.js, so you can use [the package.json in this repository](https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/package.json). Right now, this means you only need the `xhr2` npm package and the `open` package.\n. @jamarolo can you please let me know if this answers your question / fixes your problem? Thank you!\n. @jamarolo Point taken, thank you!\n. You seem to be confused about how XMLHttpRequest event listeners work. Either you assign a function to a DOM0-style property, like \"onprogress\", or you call the DOM2 addEventListener.\n\naddEventListener is almost always better, because you can add multiple listeners from different parts of your code. Specifically:\n\n``` javascript\ndbXhr.xhr.upload.addEventListener(\"progress\", function(event) { ... })\n```\n. @alnino2005 What browser are you using?\n. @alnino2005 Thank you for sharing that detail!\n\nnode.js doesn't have native support for XMLHttpRequest, so we're using a library that emulates it. I'll file a bug to track the fact that it'd be nice to have progress events.\n. @alnino2005 Here is the relevant issue.\nhttps://github.com/pwnall/node-xhr2/issues/13\n. Thank you for the fix, @Xiphe! I landed this in 641803d02bf9e47c51991726c32fbf598a0b64cf\n\nI'll likely wait for a few more fixes before releasing a new version, because a release involves running tests on a bunch of platforms.\n\nIn the meantime, you can use a git ref in your `package.json`. You don't need to publish a new module on npm. \nDocs:  https://www.npmjs.org/doc/files/package.json.html#git-urls-as-dependencies\nExample: https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/package.json#L37\n\nThank you for reporting the bug and for the fix!\n. I didn't have `coffee-script` in `dependencies` because of this bold text in [the package.json docs on npm](https://www.npmjs.org/doc/files/package.json.html).\n\n**Please do not put test harnesses or transpilers in your dependencies hash. See devDependencies, below.**\n. @Xiphe the npm docs I cited above say that if you `cd` into `node_modules/dropbox` and do `npm install`, it will install everything and run the prepublish script. If that's true, your workaround above can be shortened a bit. Will you give this a try?\n. It seems like you have more leverage than me on getting the issue fixed on the npm side ;)\n. If this takes some time to fix, I can try to figure out a workaround.\n. Sweet! Thank you for updating this thread!\n. @chalax This should work, according to the [Core API docs](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/docs#copy_ref).\n\nCan you use `console.error` or `console.log` and report back the error that you're getting?\n. The ChromeApp driver doesn't use localStorage. You shouldn't experience any errors regarding it.\n\nYou don't need to request permissions for dropbox.com.\n\nDid you set up the right OAuth callback URL for your app?\n. @ehfeng Thanks for the contribution! Can you please try adding some tests? If not, this'll have to wait until I get around to doing that.\n. @ehfeng https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/guides/development.md#test\n\nThe callback should always be the last argument, otherwise passing functions becomes a pain. See `setTimeout` / `setInterval` for the consequences of getting it wrong.\n\nThe best way to make sure things work is to run the current tests, and add more :)\n. @smarx Your code almost works. It doesn't handle passing options, but not a cursor.\n\nI think the following works, but I'm not sure.\n\n``` coffeescript\nif (not callback) and (typeof options is 'function')\n  callback = options\n  options = null\nif (not callback) and (typeof cursor is 'function')\n  callback = cursor\n  cursor = null\nif (not options) and (typeof cursor is 'object') and not cursor.cursorTag\n```\n\nThat's why we need tests before merging something like this :) \n. Last, FWIW, from a usability perspective, the cursor object should get a copy of the options, so future calls that only use the cursor work properly. \n\nSpecifically, I'm thinking of these sentences in the Core API docs\n- If you use the path_prefix parameter, you must continue to pass the correct prefix on subsequent calls using the returned cursor.\n- If you use the include_media_info parameter, you must continue to pass the same value on subsequent calls using the returned cursor.\n. @smarx Argh, sorry, I missed the text below the code. It's too early :/\n. You should do the authentication from your extension's background / event page. You can use [chrome.runtime.getBackgroundPage](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/runtime#method-getBackgroundPage) to get to the global object in the background page, and perform actions from that context.\n\nThis is an overly complex example of a Chrome extension that uses Dropbox.\nhttps://github.com/pwnall/dropship-chrome\n\nRelevant lines:\nhttps://github.com/pwnall/dropship-chrome/blob/master/src/coffee/options_view.coffee#L91\nhttps://github.com/pwnall/dropship-chrome/blob/master/src/coffee/event_page.coffee#L267\n\nI hope this helps.\n. You don't need messages, you can do \n\n``` javascript\nchrome.runtime.getBackgroundPage(function(backgroundWindow) {\n    var client = backgroundWindow.client;\n    if (client.isAuthenticated()) { .... }\n});\n```\n. That being said, what you wrote still works. I'll look into dropbox.js for a bit, to make sure I'm saving the auth data correctly.\n. @Imskull Thanks so much for reporting this issue!\n\nCan you please try out a build from master? I think I just fixed the problem.\n. @nathanhammond Thank you very much for the fix!\n\nThat must have been a PITA to debug! Sorry!\n. I am really sorry about that! I'm still waiting for tests to finish before I push this to master, but it should get out in the next few hours.\n. First off, suggestions for improving any API are welcome!\n\nI built the resumeAuthorize API for the redirect driver.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/src/auth_driver/browser.coffee#L309\n\nIt's called here.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/src/client.coffee#L193\n\nMy design assumes that consumer code doesn't calling into AuthDriver instance. It should call Dropbox.Client#authenticate, which drives the OAuth 2 process and calls into the driver when necessary.\n\nIn my experience, this design worked out well for client-side apps, but doesn't work for server-side code, e.g. node.js. I haven't had time to finish up a node.js app and figure out what the API should look like in that case.\n\nAre you trying to write a server-side app?\n. The client call looks good. I usually wrap the result in an object class, like this.\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/src/file/stat.coffee\n\nHaving the wrapper makes testing easier, because we can have edge case tests as unit tests for the wrapper class, and we don't necessarily need to cover them in Client tests.\n\nI'm guessing that testing will be a bit of a pain for this. It seems like we need to amend testing instructions with directions about creating specific folders and sharing them with specific users. It really sucks that there's no \"share\" / \"accept share\" API. That'd let us contain the setup in the tests, like we do for writeFile / readFile.\n. Can you look at the network tab and see what happens?\n. @marxo Do you see the `/metadata` network request for the `readdir` call in the Network tab? If so, it seems like either you have a bug, or dropbox.js chokes on something in the output. Is there any chance you can point me to the code that you're working on, so I can see what's broken?\n. https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/src/client.coffee#L36\n. @davidmerfield Do you happen to know any other Codo documentation hosting service? \n\n@smarx Should I host the files in my Dropbox?\n. @aseemk I thought of heroku before. Unfortunately, coffeedoc.info seems to use 2 drones, which would translate into 2 dynos. I'm sure the drones can be merged, and so far I've been put off by the prospect of doing this on my own.\n\nI can do a first pass at getting coffeedoc.info working on heroku, if you'd be willing to code-review and help me with whatever ongoing maintenance work pops up.\n. @smarx I got an error as well, seems like bitrot got to it. I'll try to fix the problem this weekend.\n. @aseemk Thanks for the great news!\n. This is a StackOverflow question, not an issue with the library.\n. ",

Ok this work but I may not have well explained my problem.\n\nThe first time the user uses my app (o after he deauthorized it) i want to display the button that clicked redirects to the authorization page on dropbox's website.\n\nBut if the user has already authorized my app once (so that it appears on \"My Apps\" page) i don't want to display the button but directly redirect to dropbox website (but where the user isn't asked to authorize my app but directly redirected back to my app).\n\nI may check for \"dropbox-auth:xxxxxx\" in localstorage and if there's don't show the button but there are two problems:\n\n-i don't know the second part of the key stored in localstorage (about that, why don't you use a simple cookie?)\n-if the user deauthorized my app the key in localstorage isn't automatically deleted\n\nwhat do you think?\n. perfect :) it has a a delay of some seconds the first time but then it works very well!\n\nthanks a lot!\n. Steps to replicate the bug:\n\n1-) I've deauthorized Checkbox.js from my Dropbox apps and deleted its folder\n2-) opened this link and authorized the app https://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/pjlfdak1tmznswp/checkbox.js/public/index.html then i've played a bit with t (created tasks...)\n3-) clicked \"sign out\" on Checkbox.js \n4-) I've been prompted for a new authorization, I've given the permission and a new folder \"Checkbox (1)\" has been created without any of the tasks i've created before while there's the old \"Checkbox\" folder with the right files but if I go to the web app it show me \"Checkbox (1)\"'s files\n5-)If i do the same another time a folder \"Checkbox (2)\" will be created an so on\n. Anything about that?\n. sorry, I accidentally closed it while I wanted to ask if there was some news about that\n. Nothing new on that?\n. If I authenticate the user using client side dropbox.js, pass oauth_token  and oauth_token_secret back to the server then it is possible to use them for making requests from node? \n. See http://bower.io/ under \"Defining a package\", it requires a simple `bower.json` file but the biggest problem is that the compiled source code should be avalaible in the package repository.\n\nI think that publishing the compiled version at every commit/release would be problematic. Maybe the best way is to create a specific repository for bower (there are also other similar tools which may be used in the same way, see http://component.io) where the published version is updated at every release\n\nIt wouldn't allow to use a specific commit of dropbox.js in bower but that shouldn't be a big problems for the few that don't use released versions\n.

Ok this work but I may not have well explained my problem.\n\nThe first time the user uses my app (o after he deauthorized it) i want to display the button that clicked redirects to the authorization page on dropbox's website.\n\nBut if the user has already authorized my app once (so that it appears on \"My Apps\" page) i don't want to display the button but directly redirect to dropbox website (but where the user isn't asked to authorize my app but directly redirected back to my app).\n\nI may check for \"dropbox-auth:xxxxxx\" in localstorage and if there's don't show the button but there are two problems:\n\n-i don't know the second part of the key stored in localstorage (about that, why don't you use a simple cookie?)\n-if the user deauthorized my app the key in localstorage isn't automatically deleted\n\nwhat do you think?\n. perfect :) it has a a delay of some seconds the first time but then it works very well!\n\nthanks a lot!\n. Steps to replicate the bug:\n\n1-) I've deauthorized Checkbox.js from my Dropbox apps and deleted its folder\n2-) opened this link and authorized the app https://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/pjlfdak1tmznswp/checkbox.js/public/index.html then i've played a bit with t (created tasks...)\n3-) clicked \"sign out\" on Checkbox.js \n4-) I've been prompted for a new authorization, I've given the permission and a new folder \"Checkbox (1)\" has been created without any of the tasks i've created before while there's the old \"Checkbox\" folder with the right files but if I go to the web app it show me \"Checkbox (1)\"'s files\n5-)If i do the same another time a folder \"Checkbox (2)\" will be created an so on\n. Anything about that?\n. sorry, I accidentally closed it while I wanted to ask if there was some news about that\n. Nothing new on that?\n. If I authenticate the user using client side dropbox.js, pass oauth_token  and oauth_token_secret back to the server then it is possible to use them for making requests from node? \n. See http://bower.io/ under \"Defining a package\", it requires a simple `bower.json` file but the biggest problem is that the compiled source code should be avalaible in the package repository.\n\nI think that publishing the compiled version at every commit/release would be problematic. Maybe the best way is to create a specific repository for bower (there are also other similar tools which may be used in the same way, see http://component.io) where the published version is updated at every release\n\nIt wouldn't allow to use a specific commit of dropbox.js in bower but that shouldn't be a big problems for the few that don't use released versions\n. I'm using this and it works:\n\n``` coffee\ndriver = client.authDriver new Dropbox.AuthDriver.Redirect\ndriver.driver.receiverUrl = \"http://localhost:8000/app.html\"\n```\n. Probably `localhost` is whitelisted\n. No problem compiling it myself. I will be away from home for a few days, if\nsomeone doesn't try it before I come back, I'll give a look to it.

    "smarx": "Yes, you'll need to call `client.authenticate({ interactive: false });`\n. The line that looks suspicious is `deferred.resolve(temp)`. (`temp` is presumably undefined, but also, you're resolving your promise before anything has actually run!)\n\nAlso, why is there a 5-second timeout around this?\n\nYour `'Hello', 'world'` line seems to have a typo (missing right square bracket).\n\nIn any case, if you remove the call to `deferred.resolve(temp)`, does this code work? I don't know AngularJS at all, but from working with promises in other environments, everything looks good.\n\nIn short, my preferred code would look something like this:\n\n```\nvar getMessages = function() {\n    var deferred = $q.defer();\n    client.readdir(\"/\", function(error, entries, stat1, stat2) {\n        if (error) {\n            deferred.reject(error);\n        } else {\n            deferred.resolve(entries);\n        }\n    });\n    return deferred.promise;\n};\n```\n\n**EDIT**: Oh, just noticed your last code snippet. That looks wrong, unless AngularJS has some special handling of promises there. The typical way to use a promise would be like this:\n\n```\n// ...\n.controller('HelloCtrl', function($scope, HelloWorld) {\n    HelloWorld.getMessages().then(function (messages) {\n        $scope.messages = messages;\n    });\n});\n```\n. Below is full working code, running at https://angulardropbox.site44.com/.\n\n```\n<!doctype html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>AngularJS + Dropbox</title>\n    <script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.2.12/angular.min.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/static/api/dropbox-datastores-1.0-latest.js\"></script>\n</head>\n<body ng-app=\"myModule\" ng-controller=\"HelloCtrl\">\n    <h1>Files</h1>\n    <ul>\n        <li ng-repeat=\"file in files\">{{ file }}</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <script>\n        angular.module('myModule', [])\n        .factory('HelloWorld', function ($q, $timeout) {\n            var client = new Dropbox.Client({key: 'ategsxcgsyksyeq'});\n            client.authenticate();\n            return {\n                getfiles: function () {\n                    var deferred = $q.defer();\n                    client.readdir('/', function (error, entries) {\n                        if (error) deferred.reject(error);\n                        else deferred.resolve(entries);\n                    });\n                    return deferred.promise;\n                }\n            }\n        })\n        .controller('HelloCtrl', function ($scope, HelloWorld) {\n            HelloWorld.getfiles().then(function (entries) {\n                $scope.files = entries;\n            });\n        });\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n. It looks like you're having trouble with async programming... it's important to keep in mind the order of execution.\n\nHere's a snippet of your code with the order in which the code will execute:\n\n```\ntemp = folders[i]; // This happens 1st.\ngetFiles.getFiles(folders[i].path).then(function (stat1) {\n    var folderContent = stat1._json.contents; // This happens 3rd.\n    temp.content = folderContent;\n});\n```\n\n   setFolders(temp); // This happens 2nd.\n\nI couldn't quite follow how the logic is supposed to work in your code, but I suspect you're simply not doing things in the order you want to. :-)\n. `Delta` does this. Though you still have to call it in a loop (not recursively, just repeatedly, since it can return partial results with a cursor to continue).\n\nUnfortunately, I don't think the JS library yet supports the `path_prefix` parameter, which is what scopes the call to a single path.\n. If you suspect something has changed on the Dropbox side, you should probably ask this question on the Dropbox forum: https://forums.dropbox.com/forum.php?id=5. (It is, in fact, the case that users are no longer asked to reauthorize an app they've already authorized. But start a thread on the forum if you want to discuss it.)\n.

The developer blog (http://dropbox.com/developers/blog) is certainly the place to watch for feature updates like that. (We'll be posting something about the data URI support soon.)\n\nBut if we added explicit support for Blob URLs, it would almost certainly have the same file size limits as data URIs.\n. I'd have to check the code, but I assume `writeFile` uses [files_put](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/docs#files_put), so the maximum size is 150MB. To upload larger files, you need to use chunked uploads.\n. @louissobel It's a limit on the size of the actual file, but it's not actually a hard limit (at least not today).\n. @louissobel There are no hard limits at all. Please post on the forum (https://forums.dropbox.com/forum.php?id=5) rather than opening an issue here, since this doesn't relate to the dropbox.js library.\n. This discussion doesn't belong here, but it seems people are still finding this thread. So to update here, we ended up not shipping data URI support in the Saver due to limitations on our end.\n. Closing, because this is the repo for the dropbox.js library, but this issue doesn't relate to dropbox.js. (The repro doesn't even use the library at all.) Please post on the Dropbox developer forum: https://forums.dropbox.com/forum.php?id=5.\n. Spam.\n. Heroku supports HTTPS.\n. No, this isn't stored in the browser anywhere. This is on the Dropbox side... Dropbox sees that your account is already linked to the app and just redirects you immediately.\n\nSo what happens is each time you link the app with your account, a new access token is generated. Calling `signoff` disables the access token currently used but doesn't do anything about the other tokens. As long as you still have at least one valid access token for the app, you'll get the automatic redirect behavior.\n\nYou can fully unlink your account from the app by visiting https://www.dropbox.com/account/security and clicking the X next to the app. If you then link the app and then use `signoff`, you should be forced to allow the app access again the next time you try to auth. (This is because you only had one access token, and `signoff` disabled that token.)\n\nYou can also pass `force_reapprove=true` as part of your OAuth 2 redirect to always force the user to approve the app again, even if they already have. I don't think the JS SDK exposes this parameter, but it shouldn't be hard to add.\n. See https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/docs#thumbnails:\n\n> This method currently supports files with the following file extensions: \"jpg\", \"jpeg\", \"png\", \"tiff\", \"tif\", \"gif\", and \"bmp\".\n. This Github repository is for the dropbox.js library, but I don't think any method in this library accepts a list of extensions.\n\nJust taking a guess, but I'd say you're using the Chooser? (https://www.dropbox.com/developers/dropins/chooser/js) If so, you can get help on the Dropbox API forum: https://forums.dropbox.com/forum.php?id=5.\n. That error generally means exactly what it says... did you add that redirect URI to the list of allowed redirect URIs in the App console? (dropbox.com/apps)\n. I think `POST` is also supported, and browsers have better support for `POST` than `PUT`.\n. That code looks right to me. What sort of problem are you having?\n. That code works for me... see https://popuptest.site44.com for a working example, and check out the source to see if you can spot a difference.\n. @lukelam Interesting. I really don't know what difference there might be based on the use of SSO.\n. Do you mean that you always want to use _your_ account (instead of the app user's account)? If so, you _could_ pass an access token when you construct your client object:\n\n```\nnew Dropbox.Client({ token: '<YOUR ACCESS TOKEN>' });\n```\n\nHowever, this is **not** recommended for a few reasons. Most importantly, every user of your app would be able to take this access token and delete all your files, upload their own private DVD collection, etc. Essentially, anyone who has access to your app now has access to your Dropbox account.\n\nThe typical model for the Dropbox API is for each user of an app to access his or her own account.\n\nI'm going to close this issue here... this is probably better suited to the Dropbox API forum: https://forums.dropbox.com/forum.php?id=5\n. This really doesn't relate to dropbox.js. (The issue would be the same on any platform or with any library.) Any chance we can move the discussion to the Dropbox API forum?\n. See also http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24427120/uploading-to-dropbox-via-node-js-fails. I answered there.\n. The message means exactly what it says. :-) Make sure that the OAuth redirect URI you've added for your app is exactly \"chrome-extension://.../chrome_oauth_receiver.html\". You can change the URI(s) you've registered via the App console: https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps.\n. You're passing `{interactive: false}` to authenticate, which won't ever actually log in the user. I _think_ you want something like this, but I'm not sure because I may be understanding the flow of your app.\n\n```\nindex: ->\n    @client.authenticate { interactive: false }\n    if not @client.isAuthenticated()\n        return @redirectTo {url: \"auth\"}\n\nauth: ->\n    @client.authenticate (error, data) =>\n        ...\n```\n\nThis will try to complete authentication every time the page loads and only redirect to the auth\u2014page, or controller method or whatever :-)\u2014when the user is not authenticated. In the auth controller method,  the user will be asked to authenticate.\n\nYou might even be able to simplify this further like so:\n\n```\nindex: ->\n    @client.authenticate (error, data) =>\n        ...\n```\n\nIf the user is already authenticated, this will just execute the callback immediately, but if the user is not authenticated, this will authenticate them.\n. Thanks! See https://forums.dropbox.com/topic.php?id=120148. Since this isn't an issue with `dropbox.js` (rather with Dropbox itself), I'm going to close this issue. Please follow the forum thread for resolution.\n. I imagine this will be fixed later today.\n. FYI, this did indeed get fixed that day.\n. It should just keep falling back, right? Maybe something like this, though I haven't thought through all the cases yet. :-)\n\n``` js\nif (not callback) and (typeof options is 'function')\n  callback = options\n  options = null\nif (not callback) and (typeof cursor is 'function')\n  callback = cursor\n  cursor = null\n```\n\nThis should allow devs to do `pullChanges(cursor, callback)` or `pullChanges(callback)` or `pullChanges(cursor, options, callback)`, but they'd have to do `pullChanges(null, options, callback)`. (I imagine we could solve the need for a `null` there by checking the type of the first parameter.)\n. @pwnall That's exactly the case I called out and the solution I hinted at. :-)\n. See marxo's issue here: https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/issues/214 and on Stack Overflow here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28068505/dropbox-api-always-access-my-account-dropbox-js\n. See https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/guides/builtin_drivers.md#dropboxauthdriverpopup and https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/test/html/oauth_receiver.html. You need to redirect to a page that runs `Dropbox.AuthDriver.Popup.oauthReceiver()`. The rest is essentially as you described your expectations.\n. See also on Stack Overflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28068505/dropbox-api-always-access-my-account-dropbox-js\n. I think the best option would be to write a new auth driver. See https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/src/auth_driver/cordova.coffee for the one that's likely to be the most similar. You'll just need to use different code to open and close the window and hook the navigation event.\n\nIf you want to just build the URL yourself, it's documented here: https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/docs#oa2-authorize. Basically, you want `https://www.dropbox.com/1/oauth2/authorize?response_type=token&client_id=<your app key>&redirect_uri=https://www.dropbox.com/1/oauth2/redirect_receiver`, and then catch the redirect and extract the access token from the URL fragment.\n. I'm utterly confused. Why are you using the `NodeServer` auth driver? Per https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/guides/builtin_drivers.md#dropboxauthdrivernodeserver:\n\n> Dropbox.AuthDriver.NodeServer\n> \n> This driver is designed **for use in the automated test suites of node.js applications**. It completes the OAuth token authorization step by opening the Dropbox authorization page in a new browser window, and \"catches\" the OAuth redirection by setting up a small server using the https built-in node.js library.\n\nAnd why are you trying to call `getStateParam()`? (Also, I don't see any call to it, and you haven't said what the issue is.)\n. I'm a bit lost, sorry. I would think you just want something like the `Cordova` auth driver. I don't know exactly what the `NodeServer` auth driver does or how appropriate it is for what you're trying to do.\n. I wrote an auth driver that seems to work for me using nw.js:\n\n``` coffee\ngui = global.window.nwDispatcher.requireNwGui()\n\nclass Dropbox.AuthDriver.NWAuthDriver extends Dropbox.AuthDriver.BrowserBase\n  constructor: (options) ->\n    super options\n\n  url: ->\n    'https://www.dropbox.com/1/oauth2/redirect_receiver'\n\n  doAuthorize: (authUrl, stateParam, client, callback) ->\n    popup = gui.Window.open authUrl, { focus: true }\n    removed = false\n    popup.on 'loaded', =>\n        url = popup.window.location.href\n        if @locationStateParam(url) is stateParam\n            return if removed\n            removed = true\n            popup.close()\n\n            callback Dropbox.Util.Oauth.queryParamsFromUrl(url)\n            return\n    popup.on 'closed', =>\n        return if removed\n        callback new Dropbox.AuthError('error=access_denied&error_description=User+closed+browser+window')\n        return\n```\n\nI put that in a file called NWAuthDriver.coffee, compiled it to NWAuthDriver.js, and then just included it in a `<script>` tag under `dropbox.js` itself. Here's my main HTML:\n\n``` html\n<!doctype html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/dropbox.js/0.10.2/dropbox.min.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"./NWAuthDriver.js\"></script>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <script>\n        var client = new Dropbox.Client({ key: '<REDACTED>' });\n        client.authDriver(new Dropbox.AuthDriver.NWAuthDriver());\n\n        client.authenticate(function (error) {\n            console.log('Authenticated.');\n            client.getAccountInfo(function (error, info) {\n                console.log(JSON.stringify(info));\n            });\n        });\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThis is my first time using nw.js, so apologies if I've done things in a strange way. :-) Let me know if this helps or what you come up with instead.\n. Here's the corresponding JavaScript in case it's easier to understand:\n\n``` js\n// Generated by CoffeeScript 1.8.0\n(function() {\n  var gui,\n    __hasProp = {}.hasOwnProperty,\n    __extends = function(child, parent) { for (var key in parent) { if (__hasProp.call(parent, key)) child[key] = parent[key]; } function ctor() { this.constructor = child; } ctor.prototype = parent.prototype; child.prototype = new ctor(); child.__super__ = parent.prototype; return child; };\n\n  gui = global.window.nwDispatcher.requireNwGui();\n\n  Dropbox.AuthDriver.NWAuthDriver = (function(_super) {\n    __extends(NWAuthDriver, _super);\n\n    function NWAuthDriver(options) {\n      NWAuthDriver.__super__.constructor.call(this, options);\n    }\n\n    NWAuthDriver.prototype.url = function() {\n      return 'https://www.dropbox.com/1/oauth2/redirect_receiver';\n    };\n\n    NWAuthDriver.prototype.doAuthorize = function(authUrl, stateParam, client, callback) {\n      var popup, removed;\n      popup = gui.Window.open(authUrl, {\n        focus: true\n      });\n      removed = false;\n      popup.on('loaded', (function(_this) {\n        return function() {\n          var url;\n          url = popup.window.location.href;\n          if (_this.locationStateParam(url) === stateParam) {\n            if (removed) {\n              return;\n            }\n            removed = true;\n            popup.close();\n            callback(Dropbox.Util.Oauth.queryParamsFromUrl(url));\n          }\n        };\n      })(this));\n      return popup.on('closed', (function(_this) {\n        return function() {\n          if (removed) {\n            return;\n          }\n          callback(new Dropbox.AuthError('error=access_denied&error_description=User+closed+browser+window'));\n        };\n      })(this));\n    };\n\n    return NWAuthDriver;\n\n  })(Dropbox.AuthDriver.BrowserBase);\n\n}).call(this);\n```\n. Actually, forget all that. The built-in `Popup` auth driver works fine once you whitelist your app scheme:\n\n``` js\n<!doctype html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/dropbox.js/0.10.2/dropbox.min.js\"></script>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <script>\n        var client = new Dropbox.Client({ key: '<REDACTED>' });\n        client.authDriver(new Dropbox.AuthDriver.Popup({ receiverUrl: 'app://nwjs_test/oauth_receiver.html' }));\n\n        // This is the only non-standard bit. It allows the redirect back to app://nwjs_test/oauth_receiver.html to work.\n        require('nw.gui').App.addOriginAccessWhitelistEntry('https://www.dropbox.com/1/oauth2/authorize', 'app', 'nwjs_test', true);\n\n        client.authenticate(function (error) {\n            console.log('Authenticated.');\n            client.getAccountInfo(function (error, info) {\n                console.log(JSON.stringify(info));\n            });\n        });\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n. I noticed that too. It looks like the code I copied from the Cordova plugin may not work at all. We should probably open a new issue for that.\n\nI don't want to spend much time on fixing NWAuthDriver, since that code shouldn't be necessary at all. (Using the built-in Popup driver is much easier!) Maybe you can take another stab at using the Popup driver and let me know what issue you're running into?\n. What kind of options? https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/src/auth_driver/browser.coffee#L319 is the code... maybe you can find what you're looking for there or modify it to suit your needs.\n. See also https://github.com/coffeedoc/coffeedoc.info/issues/9.\n. @pwnall Do you have a copy of the docs anywhere? (Or are you able to get them to generate?) If so, I can host them somewhere. But I'm unable to get \"cake doc\" to actually build the docs.\n. If you're using the code from this repo, then no. You'll want https://www.dropbox.com/developers/datastore/sdks/js, which is a fork of this library that adds datastore functionality.\n. You may want to take a look at https://blogs.dropbox.com/developers/2014/06/using-dropbox-datastores-in-a-cordova-app/. That example is about the Datastore API, but the auth part should be the same for anything based on `dropbox.js`.\n. What example and where?\n. Ah, the click handler is missing a closing paren (and semi-colon). Fixed now, thanks.\n. No repro; see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30451980/maximum-call-stack-size-exceeded-while-uploading-large-file-using-dropbox-nodejs/30494424#30494424.\n. - This repository has nothing to do with the Datastore API.\n- This library is the closest there is to an official JavaScript library from Dropbox. (It was written by a Dropbox intern, and he continues to maintain it, but we host it under the Dropbox GitHub organization.)\n- API v2 will likely have a JavaScript SDK in the future. For now I would just use v1 (with this library).\n\nIf you're reading and writing text files, this SDK should work fine for you.\n. If you're passing that whole string into the `Buffer` constructor, I would expect that to fail (since it's not valid base 64). You should pass just the base 64 part... e.g. something like `b64image.substring(b64image.indexOf('base64,')+7)`.\n. At first glance, I would guess this is a networking error. Are you able to reproduce the problem?\n. You might want to search for \"403\" in the documentation to see where it can be returned: https://www.dropbox.com/developers-v1/core/docs.\n\nSorry about needing to grep error messages. API v2 always returns specific errors you can reliably test for, but there's unfortunately no JavaScript SDK available yet.\n. I think `mkdir` is what you're looking for. (I searched the code for \"create_folder\" to find this.)\n\nBut yes, there's no need to create the folder if you're about to write files into it. The folder will be implicitly created. It looks like the file is being written from your example.\n\nWhy do you say the file and folder don't exist? Are you sure you're looking in the right account and the right location? (E.g. if you have an \"app folder\" permission app, the folder you created will be in `~/Dropbox/Apps/<your app name>/2015-44`.)\n. The code in this repo is unrelated to the Dropbox Chooser, so this isn't a good forum to ask for help. See https://www.dropbox.com/developers/support for better options.\n. A JS library is planned for API v2 (but there are quite a few languages on the list, so give the team some time).\n. Yes, you'll need to call `client.authenticate({ interactive: false });`\n. The line that looks suspicious is `deferred.resolve(temp)`. (`temp` is presumably undefined, but also, you're resolving your promise before anything has actually run!)\n\nAlso, why is there a 5-second timeout around this?\n\nYour `'Hello', 'world'` line seems to have a typo (missing right square bracket).\n\nIn any case, if you remove the call to `deferred.resolve(temp)`, does this code work? I don't know AngularJS at all, but from working with promises in other environments, everything looks good.\n\nIn short, my preferred code would look something like this:\n\n```\nvar getMessages = function() {\n    var deferred = $q.defer();\n    client.readdir(\"/\", function(error, entries, stat1, stat2) {\n        if (error) {\n            deferred.reject(error);\n        } else {\n            deferred.resolve(entries);\n        }\n    });\n    return deferred.promise;\n};\n```\n\n**EDIT**: Oh, just noticed your last code snippet. That looks wrong, unless AngularJS has some special handling of promises there. The typical way to use a promise would be like this:\n\n```\n// ...\n.controller('HelloCtrl', function($scope, HelloWorld) {\n    HelloWorld.getMessages().then(function (messages) {\n        $scope.messages = messages;\n    });\n});\n```\n. Below is full working code, running at https://angulardropbox.site44.com/.\n\n```\n<!doctype html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>AngularJS + Dropbox</title>\n    <script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.2.12/angular.min.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/static/api/dropbox-datastores-1.0-latest.js\"></script>\n</head>\n<body ng-app=\"myModule\" ng-controller=\"HelloCtrl\">\n    <h1>Files</h1>\n    <ul>\n        <li ng-repeat=\"file in files\">{{ file }}</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <script>\n        angular.module('myModule', [])\n        .factory('HelloWorld', function ($q, $timeout) {\n            var client = new Dropbox.Client({key: 'ategsxcgsyksyeq'});\n            client.authenticate();\n            return {\n                getfiles: function () {\n                    var deferred = $q.defer();\n                    client.readdir('/', function (error, entries) {\n                        if (error) deferred.reject(error);\n                        else deferred.resolve(entries);\n                    });\n                    return deferred.promise;\n                }\n            }\n        })\n        .controller('HelloCtrl', function ($scope, HelloWorld) {\n            HelloWorld.getfiles().then(function (entries) {\n                $scope.files = entries;\n            });\n        });\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n. It looks like you're having trouble with async programming... it's important to keep in mind the order of execution.\n\nHere's a snippet of your code with the order in which the code will execute:\n\n```\ntemp = folders[i]; // This happens 1st.\ngetFiles.getFiles(folders[i].path).then(function (stat1) {\n    var folderContent = stat1._json.contents; // This happens 3rd.\n    temp.content = folderContent;\n});\n```\n\n   setFolders(temp); // This happens 2nd.\n\nI couldn't quite follow how the logic is supposed to work in your code, but I suspect you're simply not doing things in the order you want to. :-)\n. `Delta` does this. Though you still have to call it in a loop (not recursively, just repeatedly, since it can return partial results with a cursor to continue).\n\nUnfortunately, I don't think the JS library yet supports the `path_prefix` parameter, which is what scopes the call to a single path.\n. If you suspect something has changed on the Dropbox side, you should probably ask this question on the Dropbox forum: https://forums.dropbox.com/forum.php?id=5. (It is, in fact, the case that users are no longer asked to reauthorize an app they've already authorized. But start a thread on the forum if you want to discuss it.)\n. I assume you can convert a blob to a data URI, right? I recently added data\nURI support to the Saver.\n\nOn Fri, Jan 10, 2014 at 4:11 PM, Victor Costan notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> TL;DR: the libraries can share the namespace.

The developer blog (http://dropbox.com/developers/blog) is certainly the place to watch for feature updates like that. (We'll be posting something about the data URI support soon.)\n\nBut if we added explicit support for Blob URLs, it would almost certainly have the same file size limits as data URIs.\n. I'd have to check the code, but I assume `writeFile` uses [files_put](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/docs#files_put), so the maximum size is 150MB. To upload larger files, you need to use chunked uploads.\n. @louissobel It's a limit on the size of the actual file, but it's not actually a hard limit (at least not today).\n. @louissobel There are no hard limits at all. Please post on the forum (https://forums.dropbox.com/forum.php?id=5) rather than opening an issue here, since this doesn't relate to the dropbox.js library.\n. This discussion doesn't belong here, but it seems people are still finding this thread. So to update here, we ended up not shipping data URI support in the Saver due to limitations on our end.\n. Closing, because this is the repo for the dropbox.js library, but this issue doesn't relate to dropbox.js. (The repro doesn't even use the library at all.) Please post on the Dropbox developer forum: https://forums.dropbox.com/forum.php?id=5.\n. Spam.\n. Heroku supports HTTPS.\n. No, this isn't stored in the browser anywhere. This is on the Dropbox side... Dropbox sees that your account is already linked to the app and just redirects you immediately.\n\nSo what happens is each time you link the app with your account, a new access token is generated. Calling `signoff` disables the access token currently used but doesn't do anything about the other tokens. As long as you still have at least one valid access token for the app, you'll get the automatic redirect behavior.\n\nYou can fully unlink your account from the app by visiting https://www.dropbox.com/account/security and clicking the X next to the app. If you then link the app and then use `signoff`, you should be forced to allow the app access again the next time you try to auth. (This is because you only had one access token, and `signoff` disabled that token.)\n\nYou can also pass `force_reapprove=true` as part of your OAuth 2 redirect to always force the user to approve the app again, even if they already have. I don't think the JS SDK exposes this parameter, but it shouldn't be hard to add.\n. See https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/docs#thumbnails:\n\n> This method currently supports files with the following file extensions: \"jpg\", \"jpeg\", \"png\", \"tiff\", \"tif\", \"gif\", and \"bmp\".\n. This Github repository is for the dropbox.js library, but I don't think any method in this library accepts a list of extensions.\n\nJust taking a guess, but I'd say you're using the Chooser? (https://www.dropbox.com/developers/dropins/chooser/js) If so, you can get help on the Dropbox API forum: https://forums.dropbox.com/forum.php?id=5.\n. That error generally means exactly what it says... did you add that redirect URI to the list of allowed redirect URIs in the App console? (dropbox.com/apps)\n. I think `POST` is also supported, and browsers have better support for `POST` than `PUT`.\n. That code looks right to me. What sort of problem are you having?\n. That code works for me... see https://popuptest.site44.com for a working example, and check out the source to see if you can spot a difference.\n. @lukelam Interesting. I really don't know what difference there might be based on the use of SSO.\n. Do you mean that you always want to use _your_ account (instead of the app user's account)? If so, you _could_ pass an access token when you construct your client object:\n\n```\nnew Dropbox.Client({ token: '<YOUR ACCESS TOKEN>' });\n```\n\nHowever, this is **not** recommended for a few reasons. Most importantly, every user of your app would be able to take this access token and delete all your files, upload their own private DVD collection, etc. Essentially, anyone who has access to your app now has access to your Dropbox account.\n\nThe typical model for the Dropbox API is for each user of an app to access his or her own account.\n\nI'm going to close this issue here... this is probably better suited to the Dropbox API forum: https://forums.dropbox.com/forum.php?id=5\n. This really doesn't relate to dropbox.js. (The issue would be the same on any platform or with any library.) Any chance we can move the discussion to the Dropbox API forum?\n. See also http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24427120/uploading-to-dropbox-via-node-js-fails. I answered there.\n. The message means exactly what it says. :-) Make sure that the OAuth redirect URI you've added for your app is exactly \"chrome-extension://.../chrome_oauth_receiver.html\". You can change the URI(s) you've registered via the App console: https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps.\n. You're passing `{interactive: false}` to authenticate, which won't ever actually log in the user. I _think_ you want something like this, but I'm not sure because I may be understanding the flow of your app.\n\n```\nindex: ->\n    @client.authenticate { interactive: false }\n    if not @client.isAuthenticated()\n        return @redirectTo {url: \"auth\"}\n\nauth: ->\n    @client.authenticate (error, data) =>\n        ...\n```\n\nThis will try to complete authentication every time the page loads and only redirect to the auth\u2014page, or controller method or whatever :-)\u2014when the user is not authenticated. In the auth controller method,  the user will be asked to authenticate.\n\nYou might even be able to simplify this further like so:\n\n```\nindex: ->\n    @client.authenticate (error, data) =>\n        ...\n```\n\nIf the user is already authenticated, this will just execute the callback immediately, but if the user is not authenticated, this will authenticate them.\n. Thanks! See https://forums.dropbox.com/topic.php?id=120148. Since this isn't an issue with `dropbox.js` (rather with Dropbox itself), I'm going to close this issue. Please follow the forum thread for resolution.\n. I imagine this will be fixed later today.\n. FYI, this did indeed get fixed that day.\n. It should just keep falling back, right? Maybe something like this, though I haven't thought through all the cases yet. :-)\n\n``` js\nif (not callback) and (typeof options is 'function')\n  callback = options\n  options = null\nif (not callback) and (typeof cursor is 'function')\n  callback = cursor\n  cursor = null\n```\n\nThis should allow devs to do `pullChanges(cursor, callback)` or `pullChanges(callback)` or `pullChanges(cursor, options, callback)`, but they'd have to do `pullChanges(null, options, callback)`. (I imagine we could solve the need for a `null` there by checking the type of the first parameter.)\n. @pwnall That's exactly the case I called out and the solution I hinted at. :-)\n. See marxo's issue here: https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/issues/214 and on Stack Overflow here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28068505/dropbox-api-always-access-my-account-dropbox-js\n. See https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/guides/builtin_drivers.md#dropboxauthdriverpopup and https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/test/html/oauth_receiver.html. You need to redirect to a page that runs `Dropbox.AuthDriver.Popup.oauthReceiver()`. The rest is essentially as you described your expectations.\n. See also on Stack Overflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28068505/dropbox-api-always-access-my-account-dropbox-js\n. I think the best option would be to write a new auth driver. See https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/src/auth_driver/cordova.coffee for the one that's likely to be the most similar. You'll just need to use different code to open and close the window and hook the navigation event.\n\nIf you want to just build the URL yourself, it's documented here: https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/docs#oa2-authorize. Basically, you want `https://www.dropbox.com/1/oauth2/authorize?response_type=token&client_id=<your app key>&redirect_uri=https://www.dropbox.com/1/oauth2/redirect_receiver`, and then catch the redirect and extract the access token from the URL fragment.\n. I'm utterly confused. Why are you using the `NodeServer` auth driver? Per https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/guides/builtin_drivers.md#dropboxauthdrivernodeserver:\n\n> Dropbox.AuthDriver.NodeServer\n> \n> This driver is designed **for use in the automated test suites of node.js applications**. It completes the OAuth token authorization step by opening the Dropbox authorization page in a new browser window, and \"catches\" the OAuth redirection by setting up a small server using the https built-in node.js library.\n\nAnd why are you trying to call `getStateParam()`? (Also, I don't see any call to it, and you haven't said what the issue is.)\n. I'm a bit lost, sorry. I would think you just want something like the `Cordova` auth driver. I don't know exactly what the `NodeServer` auth driver does or how appropriate it is for what you're trying to do.\n. I wrote an auth driver that seems to work for me using nw.js:\n\n``` coffee\ngui = global.window.nwDispatcher.requireNwGui()\n\nclass Dropbox.AuthDriver.NWAuthDriver extends Dropbox.AuthDriver.BrowserBase\n  constructor: (options) ->\n    super options\n\n  url: ->\n    'https://www.dropbox.com/1/oauth2/redirect_receiver'\n\n  doAuthorize: (authUrl, stateParam, client, callback) ->\n    popup = gui.Window.open authUrl, { focus: true }\n    removed = false\n    popup.on 'loaded', =>\n        url = popup.window.location.href\n        if @locationStateParam(url) is stateParam\n            return if removed\n            removed = true\n            popup.close()\n\n            callback Dropbox.Util.Oauth.queryParamsFromUrl(url)\n            return\n    popup.on 'closed', =>\n        return if removed\n        callback new Dropbox.AuthError('error=access_denied&error_description=User+closed+browser+window')\n        return\n```\n\nI put that in a file called NWAuthDriver.coffee, compiled it to NWAuthDriver.js, and then just included it in a `<script>` tag under `dropbox.js` itself. Here's my main HTML:\n\n``` html\n<!doctype html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/dropbox.js/0.10.2/dropbox.min.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"./NWAuthDriver.js\"></script>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <script>\n        var client = new Dropbox.Client({ key: '<REDACTED>' });\n        client.authDriver(new Dropbox.AuthDriver.NWAuthDriver());\n\n        client.authenticate(function (error) {\n            console.log('Authenticated.');\n            client.getAccountInfo(function (error, info) {\n                console.log(JSON.stringify(info));\n            });\n        });\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThis is my first time using nw.js, so apologies if I've done things in a strange way. :-) Let me know if this helps or what you come up with instead.\n. Here's the corresponding JavaScript in case it's easier to understand:\n\n``` js\n// Generated by CoffeeScript 1.8.0\n(function() {\n  var gui,\n    __hasProp = {}.hasOwnProperty,\n    __extends = function(child, parent) { for (var key in parent) { if (__hasProp.call(parent, key)) child[key] = parent[key]; } function ctor() { this.constructor = child; } ctor.prototype = parent.prototype; child.prototype = new ctor(); child.__super__ = parent.prototype; return child; };\n\n  gui = global.window.nwDispatcher.requireNwGui();\n\n  Dropbox.AuthDriver.NWAuthDriver = (function(_super) {\n    __extends(NWAuthDriver, _super);\n\n    function NWAuthDriver(options) {\n      NWAuthDriver.__super__.constructor.call(this, options);\n    }\n\n    NWAuthDriver.prototype.url = function() {\n      return 'https://www.dropbox.com/1/oauth2/redirect_receiver';\n    };\n\n    NWAuthDriver.prototype.doAuthorize = function(authUrl, stateParam, client, callback) {\n      var popup, removed;\n      popup = gui.Window.open(authUrl, {\n        focus: true\n      });\n      removed = false;\n      popup.on('loaded', (function(_this) {\n        return function() {\n          var url;\n          url = popup.window.location.href;\n          if (_this.locationStateParam(url) === stateParam) {\n            if (removed) {\n              return;\n            }\n            removed = true;\n            popup.close();\n            callback(Dropbox.Util.Oauth.queryParamsFromUrl(url));\n          }\n        };\n      })(this));\n      return popup.on('closed', (function(_this) {\n        return function() {\n          if (removed) {\n            return;\n          }\n          callback(new Dropbox.AuthError('error=access_denied&error_description=User+closed+browser+window'));\n        };\n      })(this));\n    };\n\n    return NWAuthDriver;\n\n  })(Dropbox.AuthDriver.BrowserBase);\n\n}).call(this);\n```\n. Actually, forget all that. The built-in `Popup` auth driver works fine once you whitelist your app scheme:\n\n``` js\n<!doctype html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/dropbox.js/0.10.2/dropbox.min.js\"></script>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <script>\n        var client = new Dropbox.Client({ key: '<REDACTED>' });\n        client.authDriver(new Dropbox.AuthDriver.Popup({ receiverUrl: 'app://nwjs_test/oauth_receiver.html' }));\n\n        // This is the only non-standard bit. It allows the redirect back to app://nwjs_test/oauth_receiver.html to work.\n        require('nw.gui').App.addOriginAccessWhitelistEntry('https://www.dropbox.com/1/oauth2/authorize', 'app', 'nwjs_test', true);\n\n        client.authenticate(function (error) {\n            console.log('Authenticated.');\n            client.getAccountInfo(function (error, info) {\n                console.log(JSON.stringify(info));\n            });\n        });\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n. I noticed that too. It looks like the code I copied from the Cordova plugin may not work at all. We should probably open a new issue for that.\n\nI don't want to spend much time on fixing NWAuthDriver, since that code shouldn't be necessary at all. (Using the built-in Popup driver is much easier!) Maybe you can take another stab at using the Popup driver and let me know what issue you're running into?\n. What kind of options? https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/src/auth_driver/browser.coffee#L319 is the code... maybe you can find what you're looking for there or modify it to suit your needs.\n. See also https://github.com/coffeedoc/coffeedoc.info/issues/9.\n. @pwnall Do you have a copy of the docs anywhere? (Or are you able to get them to generate?) If so, I can host them somewhere. But I'm unable to get \"cake doc\" to actually build the docs.\n. If you're using the code from this repo, then no. You'll want https://www.dropbox.com/developers/datastore/sdks/js, which is a fork of this library that adds datastore functionality.\n. You may want to take a look at https://blogs.dropbox.com/developers/2014/06/using-dropbox-datastores-in-a-cordova-app/. That example is about the Datastore API, but the auth part should be the same for anything based on `dropbox.js`.\n. What example and where?\n. Ah, the click handler is missing a closing paren (and semi-colon). Fixed now, thanks.\n. No repro; see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30451980/maximum-call-stack-size-exceeded-while-uploading-large-file-using-dropbox-nodejs/30494424#30494424.\n. - This repository has nothing to do with the Datastore API.\n- This library is the closest there is to an official JavaScript library from Dropbox. (It was written by a Dropbox intern, and he continues to maintain it, but we host it under the Dropbox GitHub organization.)\n- API v2 will likely have a JavaScript SDK in the future. For now I would just use v1 (with this library).\n\nIf you're reading and writing text files, this SDK should work fine for you.\n. If you're passing that whole string into the `Buffer` constructor, I would expect that to fail (since it's not valid base 64). You should pass just the base 64 part... e.g. something like `b64image.substring(b64image.indexOf('base64,')+7)`.\n. At first glance, I would guess this is a networking error. Are you able to reproduce the problem?\n. You might want to search for \"403\" in the documentation to see where it can be returned: https://www.dropbox.com/developers-v1/core/docs.\n\nSorry about needing to grep error messages. API v2 always returns specific errors you can reliably test for, but there's unfortunately no JavaScript SDK available yet.\n. I think `mkdir` is what you're looking for. (I searched the code for \"create_folder\" to find this.)\n\nBut yes, there's no need to create the folder if you're about to write files into it. The folder will be implicitly created. It looks like the file is being written from your example.\n\nWhy do you say the file and folder don't exist? Are you sure you're looking in the right account and the right location? (E.g. if you have an \"app folder\" permission app, the folder you created will be in `~/Dropbox/Apps/<your app name>/2015-44`.)\n. The code in this repo is unrelated to the Dropbox Chooser, so this isn't a good forum to ask for help. See https://www.dropbox.com/developers/support for better options.\n. A JS library is planned for API v2 (but there are quite a few languages on the list, so give the team some time).\n. ",

    "SimplGy": "So, simply, I'm looking for a way to find out if the user has approved the link before I ask the user to approve the link :)\n. I'm so excited there's a solution available. I spent many hours today trying to get the authentication workflow working for the user the way I thought it should.\n\nI actually read the docs for the client.authenticate method, including the interactive:false flag--I just read it backwards and it confused me. I thought interactive was true by default, and that interactive meant the callback was checking in more frequently--I got this wrong.\n\nAnyway, about simplifying the API, what do you think about a usage like this?\n\n``` javascript\n// Set up dropbox\nvar dropbox = new Dropbox.client({\n  key: _encodedAppKey,\n  driver: Dropbox.Drivers.Redirect,\n  rememberUser: true,\n  authCheck: function(isAuthorized, client) {\n    if (isAuthorized) {\n      myApplication.load()\n    } else {\n      client.authenticate() // Start the user interactive redirect authentication process.\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\nSuggested changes:\n- `sandbox: true` by default. It's the new recommended way I think, and if folks are using defaults lets have them use the safer API\n- Droopbox.Drivers.Redirect returns an instantiated version of itself\n- `rememberUser: true` moved to the client instantiation (to the uneducated, these all look like config values on the dropbox client, why not treat them that way?)\n- HTTP call for checking authentication fired automatically if the 'authCheck' callback is specified\n\nI realize I'm ignorant about this kind of thing--I've never done security or login before. As an ignorant API user though, I can't understand the need for a 3+ step process. I would love to be able to do it in 1 step as above.\n\nI'll help if I can, I'm not sure if I have the expertise or if you're interested in this idea :)\n\nIn any case, thanks for what you've done on an awesome project--per user data stores for client side applications are an incredible piece of the puzzle. Front end developers could start building powerful applications with this.\n. Actually, along the lines of intelligent defaults, why not assume and instantiate a redirect driver when I make a dropbox client. And check this out, the callbacks could be split so that one is called if the user has already authenticated with dropbox, and a different one if they haven't yet. Then the usage would be super slick like this:\n\n``` javascript\nvar dropbox = new Dropbox.client({\n  key: _encodedAppKey,\n  isAuthorizedCallback: myApplication.mainScreen,\n  notAuthorizedCallback: myApplication.welcomeScreen\n  }\n})\n```\n\nThis usage would be sweet!\n. I'm sorry to still not be getting this. It's not for lack of trying :)\n\nHere is my new workflow:\n1. As soon as the page loads...\n    \\* create a dropbox client\n    \\* create an authDriver with rememberUser: true\n    \\* Call a non-interactive client.authenticate\n        \\* If, in the callback, client.isAuthenticated is true, show the main screen\n        \\* else, show the welcome screen (this screen has the connect to dropbox button on it)\n2. When the user hits the 'connect to dropbox' button\n    \\* Call an interactive client.authenticate\n\nI felt like on on first page load, the auth callback would find the user to be unauthenticated show the welcome screen. I felt like after interactive authentication, on the second page load, the auth callback would find the user authenticated and show the main screen. This is not the case. The overall feeling is of the app behind one step behind, but it depends how I fiddle with things. It always comes back (from either a DENY or an ACCEPT on the dropbox side) with a client.authstate of 3.\n\nHere's teh codez:\n\n``` javascript\nApp = Backbone.View.extend({\n    initialize: function() {\n        _.bindAll(this)\n        this.setElement('body')\n        this.$display = $('#View')\n        // Set up Dropbox\n        this.dropbox = new Dropbox.Client({ key: _encodedAppAPIkey, sandbox: true }) // This object is used to interface with the Dropbox user and his files\n        this.dropbox.authDriver( new Dropbox.Drivers.Redirect({ rememberUser: true }) ) // The auth driver determins how authentication will be done. No action is taken at this time\n        // Start app router\n        this.router = new SimplyDone.AppRouter(this)\n        Backbone.history.start()\n        // Pursue authentication, but don't bother the user... yet.\n        this.auth()\n    },\n\n    /**\n     * Trigger dropbox authentication\n     * @param askUser If true, it redirects the user to the dropbox site to get their permission to link with us\n     */\n    auth: function (askUser) {\n        console.log('app.auth()')\n        this.dropbox.authenticate( {interactive: askUser}, this.authCallback )\n    },\n    authCallback: function (err, client) {\n        console.log('app.authCallback')\n        if (err) { return this.dropboxErr(err) }\n        if (client.isAuthenticated()) {\n            this.show(this.Views.MAIN)\n        } else {\n            this.show(this.Views.WELCOME)\n        }\n    },\n    show: function (viewId) {\n        if (this.view) { this.view.remove() }\n        this.view = new SimplyDone[viewId]()\n        this.$display.html( this.view.el )\n    },\n})\n```\n. I had to modify my auth callback function in this way to get it to work. I don't understand why I need to call an interactive auth a 2nd time, but it does not work without it. It feels like I'm hitting client.authenticate 3 times instead of 2.\n\n``` javascript\nauthCallback: function (err, client) {\n    if (err) { return this.dropboxErr(err) }\n    if (client.isAuthenticated()) {\n        this.show(this.Views.TODOS)\n    } else if (client.authState === _dropboxAuthStates.AUTHORIZED) {\n        this.auth(true) // This seems to be key\n    } else {\n        this.show(this.Views.WELCOME)\n    }\n}\n```\n. //cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/dropbox.js/0.9.0/dropbox.js\n\ndoh.\n. Ooo, the other issue I raised is fixed (the silent authenticate now changes to 4 instead of 3). Sweet!\n\nIt still double calls the callback. After these steps:\n\n```\n1 Fresh Visit\n2 app.dropbox.authenticate({interactive:true})\n3 Push ALLOW, arrive back at the app    \n4 app.dropbox.authenticate({interactive:false})\n```\n\nI see this console output (The .authenticate with interactive false caused all 3 console log outputs, two at the value of 3 and one at the value of 4. In this case I expect one 3 and one 4.\n\n```\nclient.authState: 3\nclient.authState: 3\nClient\nclient.authState: 4\n```\n. I haven't set up a build for this yet--just pointing to the CDN. Should I try this tomorrow?\n. Oh, sorry, I thought you meant pull source and do a build, I didn't notice I could hot link to it.\nWhatever you did seems to have fixed it. I no longer get dup events and all other functionality seems to work (though I only did a brief functionality run through)\n. This is fixed in v0.9.1\n\nThe silent authenticate now bumps .authState up to a 4. Sweet!\n. Oh, I'm just happy to have it. Makes everything easier--You just run client.authenticate({interactive:false}) on every page load and client.authenticate({interactive:true}) when they push the button asking for it.\n\nEverything else is reacting to events and hack-free, as it should be. Sweet! (And thanks)\n. So, simply, I'm looking for a way to find out if the user has approved the link before I ask the user to approve the link :)\n. I'm so excited there's a solution available. I spent many hours today trying to get the authentication workflow working for the user the way I thought it should.\n\nI actually read the docs for the client.authenticate method, including the interactive:false flag--I just read it backwards and it confused me. I thought interactive was true by default, and that interactive meant the callback was checking in more frequently--I got this wrong.\n\nAnyway, about simplifying the API, what do you think about a usage like this?\n\n``` javascript\n// Set up dropbox\nvar dropbox = new Dropbox.client({\n  key: _encodedAppKey,\n  driver: Dropbox.Drivers.Redirect,\n  rememberUser: true,\n  authCheck: function(isAuthorized, client) {\n    if (isAuthorized) {\n      myApplication.load()\n    } else {\n      client.authenticate() // Start the user interactive redirect authentication process.\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\nSuggested changes:\n- `sandbox: true` by default. It's the new recommended way I think, and if folks are using defaults lets have them use the safer API\n- Droopbox.Drivers.Redirect returns an instantiated version of itself\n- `rememberUser: true` moved to the client instantiation (to the uneducated, these all look like config values on the dropbox client, why not treat them that way?)\n- HTTP call for checking authentication fired automatically if the 'authCheck' callback is specified\n\nI realize I'm ignorant about this kind of thing--I've never done security or login before. As an ignorant API user though, I can't understand the need for a 3+ step process. I would love to be able to do it in 1 step as above.\n\nI'll help if I can, I'm not sure if I have the expertise or if you're interested in this idea :)\n\nIn any case, thanks for what you've done on an awesome project--per user data stores for client side applications are an incredible piece of the puzzle. Front end developers could start building powerful applications with this.\n. Actually, along the lines of intelligent defaults, why not assume and instantiate a redirect driver when I make a dropbox client. And check this out, the callbacks could be split so that one is called if the user has already authenticated with dropbox, and a different one if they haven't yet. Then the usage would be super slick like this:\n\n``` javascript\nvar dropbox = new Dropbox.client({\n  key: _encodedAppKey,\n  isAuthorizedCallback: myApplication.mainScreen,\n  notAuthorizedCallback: myApplication.welcomeScreen\n  }\n})\n```\n\nThis usage would be sweet!\n. I'm sorry to still not be getting this. It's not for lack of trying :)\n\nHere is my new workflow:\n1. As soon as the page loads...\n    \\* create a dropbox client\n    \\* create an authDriver with rememberUser: true\n    \\* Call a non-interactive client.authenticate\n        \\* If, in the callback, client.isAuthenticated is true, show the main screen\n        \\* else, show the welcome screen (this screen has the connect to dropbox button on it)\n2. When the user hits the 'connect to dropbox' button\n    \\* Call an interactive client.authenticate\n\nI felt like on on first page load, the auth callback would find the user to be unauthenticated show the welcome screen. I felt like after interactive authentication, on the second page load, the auth callback would find the user authenticated and show the main screen. This is not the case. The overall feeling is of the app behind one step behind, but it depends how I fiddle with things. It always comes back (from either a DENY or an ACCEPT on the dropbox side) with a client.authstate of 3.\n\nHere's teh codez:\n\n``` javascript\nApp = Backbone.View.extend({\n    initialize: function() {\n        _.bindAll(this)\n        this.setElement('body')\n        this.$display = $('#View')\n        // Set up Dropbox\n        this.dropbox = new Dropbox.Client({ key: _encodedAppAPIkey, sandbox: true }) // This object is used to interface with the Dropbox user and his files\n        this.dropbox.authDriver( new Dropbox.Drivers.Redirect({ rememberUser: true }) ) // The auth driver determins how authentication will be done. No action is taken at this time\n        // Start app router\n        this.router = new SimplyDone.AppRouter(this)\n        Backbone.history.start()\n        // Pursue authentication, but don't bother the user... yet.\n        this.auth()\n    },\n\n    /**\n     * Trigger dropbox authentication\n     * @param askUser If true, it redirects the user to the dropbox site to get their permission to link with us\n     */\n    auth: function (askUser) {\n        console.log('app.auth()')\n        this.dropbox.authenticate( {interactive: askUser}, this.authCallback )\n    },\n    authCallback: function (err, client) {\n        console.log('app.authCallback')\n        if (err) { return this.dropboxErr(err) }\n        if (client.isAuthenticated()) {\n            this.show(this.Views.MAIN)\n        } else {\n            this.show(this.Views.WELCOME)\n        }\n    },\n    show: function (viewId) {\n        if (this.view) { this.view.remove() }\n        this.view = new SimplyDone[viewId]()\n        this.$display.html( this.view.el )\n    },\n})\n```\n.

It isn't an issue with the library, but instead it's a bug in WebWorks\n\nThis is the forum thread where I reported the issue (sadly no workarounds yet):\u00a0http://supportforums.blackberry.com/t5/Web-and-WebWorks-Development/Not-allowed-to-load-local-resource-local-index-html/td-p/2288397                                                                                                                                     \n\nSent from my Limited Edition BlackBerry 10 smartphone.\n. @pwnall Yes it's out. You can get the emulator and the SDK here: http://developer.blackberry.com/html5/\n\nI haven't tested this in the emulator (I never use a emulator), but I'm sure it'll be reproducible since I think it's a SDK bug.\n\nI'm trying to contact BlackBerry to talk about this issue.\n. @michote How are you opening the `ChildBrowser` (and handling the OAuth cycle) with dropbox.js?\n. @pwnall Is there any way to do the OAuth cycle manually and just pass the callback URL to the SDK to finish the job?\n. Thanks very much. I'll hack on dropbox.js a bit and try to work around the issue.\n. @michote I'm waiting for BlackBerry to fix it, they are trying to find where the bug is at the time.\n. I got 2 error reports from users today about this. Anyone have more information about it?\n. @pwnall I tried again with 0.10.0 and I started getting the error. I couldn't reproduce it with a version older than 0.10.0, but for some reason 2 users reported it, so I asked them if the problem persists on their version.\n. No problem.

But of course for every solution I get a new problem. Now what I want to do is to read folder directories recursively. When my user selects a folder from the list I want to read the all the directories for that folder and its subfolders. If I use the output parameter stat1 from readdir the object has an attribute contents with all the objects in that folder. I've created a function where I recursively want to read the content attribute for every subfolder and then add it the first object so that I can export and then import this data as json to my system after my user has chosen the files he wants to add from Dropbox.

After reading some it seems like it takes some time for the contents to be defined. Is there any other solution reading the directories like this?\n. Yeah, the async programming and the recursive function makes it really difficult to keep up with what happens at what time.

Thanks again!\n. I updated the pull request with additional changes, now it is possible to build the library.\nThere a few issues with Node and Firefox add-on environments, because the library ships with support for both, I need to differentiate between the two. Currently I'm using `if (typeof Buffer isnt \"function\")` to check the env.\nThe other issue is the way `require(...)` works in Firefox add-ons, to workaround that issue, I need to update the existing `require(...)` calls.\nThe next step for me is to write tests for this...\n. Updated the request with a sample add-on\n. Just added tests. Based them on the Chrome Driver.\nQuick setup:\nYou need the Firefox Addon SDK environment.\nInstructions here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/docs/sdk/latest/dev-guide/tutorials/installation.html\nDownload it, extract it. \nIn the terminal: run `source bin/activate` from the sdk folder.\nThen navigate to `dropbox-js` root, you can run `cake firefox` that runs the addon.\n`cake firefoxtest` runs the tests \n(the integration test currently dumps all html responses into the console, I'll see if I can fix that)  \n\nLet me know if you have any questions. Based on your feedback I can git squish it into one commit.\nThanks again.\n. From tests, I've experienced issues with `responseType` when reading files, Add-on SDK 1.14 doesn't support it. However it's fixed in the [development version](https://github.com/mozilla/addon-sdk). \n. @pwnall Are you switching everything to OAuth2? Should I update this for the OAuth2 branch or something else?\n. @pwnall Hey! I'll rebase this, give me a few days. Thanks again.\n. Ok! Should be good to go, let me know.\n. Sadly I don't have time to update this. @tomasko126 see if you can use some parts of the PR for your project. \n. I saw your comment on my Firefox Add-on pull request, I'll see what I can do to add support for FFOS apps. \n. After doing some research I've discovered how Firefox OS currently does OAuth flows.\nFor example here in [parameters.js](https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/blob/master/apps/communications/contacts/oauth2/js/parameters.js#L18), which is a part of the current Contacts app. The Contacts app has a way of syncing your Facebook contacts with Firefox OS.\nYou'll see that there are external redirect endpoints defined, which are basically landing pages.\n\nThough I did try to redirect to local resources, there are security policies that will not let you do that. So it seems like if the Contacts app could not do it, it might not be possible or secure enough.\n\nI got a nice **dropbox-js** flow working on Firefox OS using an external endpoint just like the Contacts app:\n\n**main.js** (your app)\n\n``` javascript\nvar client = new Dropbox.Client({\n  key: \"KEY_HERE\",\n  sandbox: true\n});\n\nclient.authDriver(new Dropbox.Drivers.Popup({ \n  rememberUser: true, \n  receiverUrl: \"http://EXAMPLE.com/oauth_receiver.html\" \n}));\n```\n\n**oauth_receiver.html** (hosted somewhere else)\n\n``` html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <script src=\"dropbox.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n      Dropbox.Drivers.Popup.oauthReceiver();\n    </script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>Dropbox sign-in successful</h1>\n\n    <p>Please close this window.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThis is not the best solution, but I'd personally follow the built-in apps and do things the same way.\nIf anyone can think of any other way to make this work let me know.\n. ```\n...\n key: \"KEY_HERE\",\n...\n```\n\npart is your encrypted dropbox app key.\nYou can read more about it here and easily generate it: https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/doc/getting_started.md#browser-and-open-source-applications\n. When you redirect to your external endpoint, dropbox also sends the tokens as part of the URL.\nThe `Dropbox.Drivers.Popup.oauthReceiver();` code:\n\n```\nPopup.oauthReceiver = function() {\n      return window.addEventListener('load', function() {\n        var frameError, ieError, opener;\n\n        opener = window.opener;\n        if (window.parent !== window.top) {\n          opener || (opener = window.parent);\n        }\n        if (opener) {\n          try {\n            opener.postMessage(window.location.href, '*');\n          } catch (_error) {\n            ieError = _error;\n          }\n          try {\n            opener.Dropbox.Drivers.Popup.onMessage.dispatch(window.location.href);\n          } catch (_error) {\n            frameError = _error;\n          }\n        }\n        return window.close();\n      });\n    };\n```\n\nThis code access your original window that opened the pop-up and sends it a message with `window.location.href`. That variable has the tokens and completes the auth flow. After that the credentials are stored using `BrowserBase.prototype.storeCredentials` I believe.\n. I've published my app example at [FirefoxOS-Dropbox](https://github.com/vladikoff/FirefoxOS-Dropbox) if anyone else will need it. \nTested in the Simulator and Firefox OS 1.0.1 hardware.\n. At http://bower.io/ under `Registering packages`\n. For the time being try adding the `secret` as part of the options. \n\n```\nvar client = new Dropbox.Client({\n    key: \"your-key-here\",\n    secret: \"your-secret-here\"\n});\n```\n\nThe key in the demo is encrypted. However I can't seem to find the app that encrypts the app keys anymore. @pwnall what's the link again or was that removed for a reason?  (not sure if it got removed from the docs by accident or not)\n. yeap that's the one. Hopefully this solved your issues!\n. Thank you for the quick response and feedback. Would you know off-hand why I have to re-approve the application every time? Which part of the library is responsible for this? Thanks again!\n. I updated the pull request with additional changes, now it is possible to build the library.\nThere a few issues with Node and Firefox add-on environments, because the library ships with support for both, I need to differentiate between the two. Currently I'm using `if (typeof Buffer isnt \"function\")` to check the env.\nThe other issue is the way `require(...)` works in Firefox add-ons, to workaround that issue, I need to update the existing `require(...)` calls.\nThe next step for me is to write tests for this...\n. Updated the request with a sample add-on\n. Just added tests. Based them on the Chrome Driver.\nQuick setup:\nYou need the Firefox Addon SDK environment.\nInstructions here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/docs/sdk/latest/dev-guide/tutorials/installation.html\nDownload it, extract it. \nIn the terminal: run `source bin/activate` from the sdk folder.\nThen navigate to `dropbox-js` root, you can run `cake firefox` that runs the addon.\n`cake firefoxtest` runs the tests \n(the integration test currently dumps all html responses into the console, I'll see if I can fix that)  \n\nLet me know if you have any questions. Based on your feedback I can git squish it into one commit.\nThanks again.\n. From tests, I've experienced issues with `responseType` when reading files, Add-on SDK 1.14 doesn't support it. However it's fixed in the [development version](https://github.com/mozilla/addon-sdk). \n. @pwnall Are you switching everything to OAuth2? Should I update this for the OAuth2 branch or something else?\n. @pwnall Hey! I'll rebase this, give me a few days. Thanks again.\n. Ok! Should be good to go, let me know.\n. Sadly I don't have time to update this. @tomasko126 see if you can use some parts of the PR for your project. \n. I saw your comment on my Firefox Add-on pull request, I'll see what I can do to add support for FFOS apps. \n.

I'm using the build you posted above ^^^\n\nI'm trying out an app where the dropbox API call works fine outside of a Chrome Packaged App. I made no changes to my dropbox JS code to authenticate (the documentation implied I didn't have to) Here is the error:\n\nidentity.launchWebAuthFlow: Authorization page could not be loaded.\n    at ChromeApp.Dropbox.AuthDriver.ChromeApp.ChromeApp.doAuthorize (chrome-extension://ainnkhlclgfbkkegfmenjhcognnlllkl/dropbox.js:712:30)\n    at _fsmStep (chrome-extension://ainnkhlclgfbkkegfmenjhcognnlllkl/dropbox.js:1123:34)\n    at ChromeApp.Dropbox.AuthDriver.ChromeBase.ChromeBase.onAuthStepChange (chrome-extension://ainnkhlclgfbkkegfmenjhcognnlllkl/dropbox.js:669:18)\n    at _fsmStep (chrome-extension://ainnkhlclgfbkkegfmenjhcognnlllkl/dropbox.js:1093:27)\n    at _fsmNextStep (chrome-extension://ainnkhlclgfbkkegfmenjhcognnlllkl/dropbox.js:1079:16)\n    at _fsmStep (chrome-extension://ainnkhlclgfbkkegfmenjhcognnlllkl/dropbox.js:1114:20)\n    at chrome-extension://ainnkhlclgfbkkegfmenjhcognnlllkl/dropbox.js:660:20 \n. Actually, I had used the dev ID, the issue was silly. I forgot to add a \"/\" at the end of the URL. It looks like the actual redirect URL was https://your-extension-id.chromiumapp.org/   and dropbox was picky enough to require the trailing slash. \n\nAll is well now :)\n. Understood completely.

The first issue is that a cursor can be a string (which is used in the \"with a bad cursor\" test and is described in the documentation above the method). The second is that in your current PR, the last `else if` can never be executed because it is strictly more restrictive than the preceding `else if`. I think the following is a better approach for checking the optional parameters and works with the existing tests:\n\n``` coffeescript\n# Returns if a parameter was a cursor or not\nisCursor = (param) ->\n  (typeof param is 'object' and param.cursorTag) or typeof param is 'string'\n\nif (not options) and (not callback) and (typeof cursor is 'function')\n  callback = cursor\n  cursor = null\n  options = null\n# if options were not passed but cursor was passed\nelse if (not callback) and (typeof options is 'function') and isCursor(cursor)\n  callback = options\n  options = null\n# if cursor was not passed but options were passed\nelse if (not callback) and (typeof options is 'function') and not isCursor(cursor)\n  callback = options\n  cursor = null\n  options = cursor\n```\n\nI also am a little confused as to why you were allowing the options to be passed in from the cursor object or the options object. I suppose it could simplify subsequent calls to the pullChanges function (by not having to pass in options) but I'm not sure you really gain anything from that.
