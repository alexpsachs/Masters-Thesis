I added this feature in the [last release](https://github.com/elrumordelaluz/csshake/releases/tag/v1.5)\n. @sapher you are absolutely right. what do you think on include also `scss/csshake.scss` as main file for preprocessor?\n. in fact @sapher added [here](https://github.com/elrumordelaluz/csshake/commit/2901f95fcae9e75556c596902835b558cb8354e9)\n. Thanks @williamli. There is the comment [here](https://github.com/elrumordelaluz/csshake/blob/master/scss/_tools.scss#L25) in the `_tools.scss` file. Maybe you downloaded/forked before a commit with this specific change.\nAnyway I found that the `$opacity` explanation is missed in `README.md` file, after the code example. Thanks again!\n. Hi @furier ,\nCould you make a [pen](http://codepen.io/) or show code in some way?\n. ok @furier feel free to comment to reopen this Issue in case you need.\n. Hi @kramer65, in this case you need to create your own _CSShake_ animation, and for its purpose you have the `do-shake` mixin. After you clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/elrumordelaluz/csshake.git`, install the basic packages `npm install` (you need [npm installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install) on your system) and you could start trying what you want with the Sass stuff. \nTry something like \n\n``` scss\n.shake-horizontal-chunk { \n  @include do-shake('shake-horizontal-chunk', 30, 0, 0, 4s, $chunk: 40%); \n}\n```\n\nin the `csshake.scss` file and then run `npm run build:raw` or `npm run build:min`.\nKeep in mind that the whole code generated in _CSShake_ is based on `random` generated numbers between the values you use in the `mixin`. For a detailed exmplanation of the mixin, read more [here](https://github.com/elrumordelaluz/csshake#customize)\n. Cool @OpherV thanks!\n. thanks @AlphaGit, merged!\nHowever I'd appreciate if you have a screenshot or could explain what is the behaviour you had in Edge. Since I an working on OSX I did a simple [pen](http://codepen.io/elrumordelaluz/pen/9c925051ea3ef55c5572e6e5405428a7) to test via [crossbrowsertesting](crossbrowsertesting.com) and didn't see nothing strange, and didn't found any [bug](https://connect.microsoft.com/IE/Feedback) related.\n. lol, sooo funny! \nthank you for the video @AlphaGit, thanks again for the PR.\n. Hi @seb0zz don't understand why you need to have the `shake-constant` class as a new shake animation class when it [exists](https://github.com/elrumordelaluz/csshake/blob/master/scss/_tools.scss#L97) yet as a _helper class_. \n\n[Here](http://codepen.io/elrumordelaluz/pen/9c925051ea3ef55c5572e6e5405428a7) you have an example to see how it works, just apply the `shake-*` animation constantly.\n. `shake-constant` should be defined importing the file `csshake.scss` since it imports `_tools.scss` where is defined a variable `$prefix: 'shake' !default;` used in [some lines](https://github.com/elrumordelaluz/csshake/blob/master/scss/_tools.scss#L83-L98) to define the class `.#{$prefix}-constant === .shake-constant` inside each animation created. \n`shake-constant` does not have an independent behaviour, need to be used as a _modifier_ of a animation created through `do-shake()` mixin. \nDid you tried `@extend`ing `shake` or another `shake-*` animation?\n. Right. To have available this class you have to at least _process_ an animation thorugh the mixin. Creating a class `.shake-constant   { @include do-shake('shake-constant'); }` will give you the same situation of using `@extend .shake` (but in this case `.shake-constant`) and you'll need to call .shake-constant.shake-constant to have it constantly (like we talked before).\n\nDid you tried importing the desired animation from `dist`? Do you have a repo or something with this working?\n. @seb0zz you could do one of this two things:\n\n``` scss\n@import \"../../../node_modules/csshake/scss/csshake\";\n.yourClass {\n  @extend .shake.shake-constant;\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nor \n\n``` scss\n@import \"../../../node_modules/csshake/scss/csshake\";\n\n%myAnim { @include do-shake(); }\n.yourClass {\n  @extend %myAnim.shake-constant;\n  ...\n}\n```\n. cool! let me know if there's another behavior with css-modules.\n. @paya-cz thanks for the idea, included [here](https://github.com/elrumordelaluz/csshake/commit/1d111730e0665bddcca42b8cad2c8bd04974527d)\n. Good catch, thanks!\n. Should be solved with last changes, thanks!\n. @greaterweb thanks for the catch, [this](https://github.com/elrumordelaluz/csshake/blob/v1.5.1/scss/_tools.scss#L14-L16) should be correct now!\n\nLet me know and thanks again.\n. @ariunbayar Thanks for the idea. Solved [here](https://github.com/elrumordelaluz/csshake/commit/d73157e1e4d0e677968bfcc28c0839f063f4b75a).\n. For any reason everything is working for me, but you are absolutely right. Thank you @aboutaaron for the PR!\n. Hello @madruga88 and thanks for the interest.\r\n**CSShake** is based on `random` numbers for its _presets_. You could play around with some numbers in the [reshake](https://github.com/elrumordelaluz/reshake) playground [here](https://elrumordelaluz.github.io/reshake/) but I think you could use the awesome [Bounce.js](http://bouncejs.com/) library to create this kind of _controlled_ animations.. @antivitla I understand what you mean.\r\n\r\n>Probably your initial target audience was bower-users \r\nNot sure if `bower` users but probably most without bundler process -like projects. \r\n\r\nCould you please provide an example on what `webpack`  do or miss about this package? \r\n_Bootstrap_ has the `js` files as `main`. \r\n\r\nI think a good solution could be `\"main\": \"dist/csshake.css\"`, in case this work for you (and hopefully for all the `npm` users) absolutely appreciate a PR!\r\n\r\nThanks for the catch!. Thanks @antivitla !. @punshonjm thanks for reporting the issue.\r\nAt the beginning the _shaked_ element needs a `display` property to allow transformations. \r\nYou are absolutely right that removing/commenting this property prevents this strange behaviour. \r\nA simple fix (PR welcome!) could be to switch `display: inline-block` that assume a specific relation with the layout/context into `display: inherits` or test again use cases without `display` property at all. \r\nIn case you want to contribute with a PR (could be awesome!), should be necessary to test with different kind of html elements because browsers assign a default `display` prop in some elems.\r\nIn case I found a document with this assumptions will share here.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, when as soon as I have a peace of time I'll fix this.\r\n\r\nThanks again,. Eric, but for now the class name is just <strong>.freez</strong>.\nPlease let me know where it doesn't work for you.\n. I think there's a mistake in de docs because the right class is `.freez`.
