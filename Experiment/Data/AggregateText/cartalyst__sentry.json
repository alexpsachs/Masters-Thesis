Hi @dbohn,\n\nThank you very much for this! Good stuff here. I'll check with @antonioribeiro in issue #60 to see if he's having issues after this.\n\nMuch appreciated,\n\n - Ben\n. Hi @natedog550,\n\nThanks as always!!\n. @natedog550 - I will let you know when I write tests for this and show you how I do it :)\n. Thanks mate,\n\nLooks like tests are failing because the other exception is expected first. I can make new tests for this. Ill merge it when I am at my computer to make the tests.

Hi @bstrahija,\n\nThanks so much for your time with this, but we feel that foreign keys are an overkill for most people using Sentry. They add complexity to databases and while they are there for speed and data integrity we feel that we do not want to ship them with Sentry.\n\nI really appreciate your time though. What I'd suggest doing is having your own migration which looks something like this:\n\n``` php\n\npublic function up()\n{\n    \\Command::call('migrate', array('--package' => 'cartalyst/sentry'));\n\n    \\Schema::table('users', function($table)\n    {\n         // Add foreign keys\n    });\n}\n\n```\n.

Can you do one thing though, where you've manually written the serialised data in the unit test can you put in the serialize() function instead. That way we aren't testing the result of PHP's serialising features but rather we're asking PHP to serialize. \n\nWill merge right away after this amendment :)\n\nThanks mate,\n\nBen\n. Legend!\n.

Hi there,\n\nI'm not sure you've grasped the concept of dependency injection & facades, two patterns which are used in the context of Laravel 4. We don't use Facades in the context of Sentry at all. This PR would need to be completely refactored to make it work I'm afraid.\n\nAlso, unit tests need to be updated as the build is failing.\n\nYou can change the models used (as a config option) and do:\n\n``` php\nprotected $table = 'my_users_table';\n```\n\nIn each model you have sub-classed.\n. Thanks!\n. I told you I'd merge it fast.

Hey @adamcole83, just giving you an update.\n\nI'm currently working on Sentry 3.0. We are focusing on simplicity, and we're stripping out a lot of methods which Sentry doesn't **require**, and are encouraging developers to use their own classes to do custom things :)\n\nThanks! \n. Hmm, it's not at all. That's another one that's failing. Thanks for that!\n. We actually have a plan for a refactor of throttling.

Hey @weotch, I'm currently working on implementing a whole new throttling structure to fix all the oversights.\n\nThanks for your input and I'm taking it into account with the new version of Sentry that we're working on!\n. Hi,\n\nI think your best shot here is running your own fork of Sentry possibly. I think this is coupling Sentry to LDAP, which I think is a niche market.\n\nAlso, we definitely cannot update our read me to say `SentryLdap is a fork of Cartalyst Sentry library. Added new features like ldap authentication.SentryLdap` :P \n\nI'd be interested in hearing @brunogaspar and @drsii's thoughts on this.\n. Just regarding throttling, in Sentry 3 we\u2019ve completely overhauled how it works.\n\nIn Sentry 3, there\u2019s configurable thresholds for global throttling (DDoS), IP throttling (DDoS or some little shit trying to hack multiple accounts) and account throttling. It\u2019s pretty awesome.\n\nOn 18 Feb 2014, at 8:02 am, Dustin Graham notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> @anndro I am using ldap to authenticate.

Could be a bit tricky. I guess this also exposes an issue with the master Sentry branch -- throttling may not be used if the user does not exist. I don't think there's a solution for this, just something to be aware of.

Hey, Not sure what's happening here but it appears your merge hasn't happened cleanly.\n\nAre you able to remove your repo, do a fresh fork and copy in your changes, to concatenate the 30-ish commits? Just trying to keep the repo history clean if possible.\n. Hey,\n\nI'll actually cherry-pick your commits into the working branch and merge your PR in the command line :)\n. Honestly, 3.0 would be called 2.1 if I wasn't strictly following [Semver versioniong](http://semver.org).\n\nThe database will stay identical, it's just the API may not be backwards compatible with reference to User methods (I'm stripping a bunch methods not used by Sentry).\n\nI'm also rewriting the throttling and that's not backwards compatible. However, if your extent of Sentry usage is just methods through the Sentry class (i.e., `Sentry::authenticate()`, `Sentry::register()` [essentially what's documented] etc), then the upgrade path should be completely benign.

I've also prepared for your StrictPermissions implementation. The great thing about how I've structured it is, you only need to override one method from `BasePermissions`, which is `preparePermissions()`. That will return a flat array of permissions, using whatever logic it wants. This is where you'll build the array of group permissions, and then remove the group permissions who are present in the user object :) Just return that array, and everything will work :) Cool, eh?\n. @marcvdm the idea is that this object is populated once, whenever permissions are requested. At this stage, the object is initialised with all user and group permissions (which will load fast through our eloquent drivers as we'll use full eager loading and query caching where possible).\n\nYou need to iterate through and give back a flat array of permissions. So, the way I'd do it is, loop through all user permissions and put them in the flat array. Then, loop through groups. Only add the group if the permission doesn't exist in the user permissions (regardless of it's value).\n\nI'd stash what you have done and pull in the latest stuff I pushed, you'll see the method there to override :)\n. You're making it hard on yourself. You [just need to pull in and modify this](https://github.com/cartalyst/sentry/blob/develop/src/Cartalyst/Sentry/Permissions/StrictPermissions.php#L26-L34).\n\nIt would only require [something like this](http://paste.laravel.com/18BC) for the logic you're after. I'd like you to put in the PR though if you're comfortable :)\n. The other way would be something [like this](http://paste.laravel.com/18BM). This way, group permissions are still an opt-in system where any opt-out (false) value will deny the permission.\n\nOtherwise, the order of the groups matters, because only the first group with the permission has the value which is required.\n\nFood for thought...\n. Release date? No.\n\nOnce Laravel 4.1's API stops changing daily, we will add support to Sentry 2 (which involves just adjusting cookies and sessions).\n. A PR for 4.0 and 4.1 support is always welcome for Sentry 2 :)\n. We could make 2 session classes. Look at the Laravel version and return a different class. \n\nOr, remove the type check and do an if() statement in the constructor to check the Jar is a valid instance. \n\nSent from my iPhone\nPlease excuse my brevity\n\n> On 22 Nov 2013, at 5:59 pm, John Maguire notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> Sure.

Hi guys,\n\nProud to present the first alpha of Sentry 3. It's tested in a real app, I haven't pushed all the unit tests yet.\n\nPlease [download the demo app](https://github.com/cartalyst/sentry-3-demo/) and:\n1. Install dependencies through composer\n2. Configure database and migrate with `--package=cartalyst/sentry` option.\n3. Visit `/register` on the virtual host you setup.\n\nBy default, we are using throttling and activation checks. To enable SwiftIdentity, simply register on their site, then publish Sentry's config and follow the instructions there (be sure to configure the `swift` component and also enable it as a `checkpoint`).\n\nDocs coming soon, but would love to get the public involved in the early testing of Sentry 3!\n. Demo coming within a day or so as well of the whole setup, with SwiftIdentity enabled.\n. @marcvdm  - yes - you will need to configure your database, we can't do that for you\n. Sure, that's because we're loading (in that specific app) things from the database -- normally you'd start your app without sentry installed and configured.\n. A stock Laravel app with a dependency of cartalyst/sentry (or any\\* other package) shouldn't touch the database, only if something is hooked on each request to hit it.\n. Yep, so there's 3 ways to go about it... Haven't really decided on a \"recommended\" way, because I don't care much for conventions :p \n\nFirst:\n\n``` php\n$user = Sentry::findByCredentials(['login' => 'foo@bar.com']);\nSentry::getUserProvider()->update($user, ['password' => 'haha', 'first_name' => 'Quz']);\nSentry::update($user, ['password' => 'haha', 'first_name' => 'Quz']); // New\n```\n\nSecond:\n\n``` php\nSentry::getUserProvider()->update(14, ['password' => 'haha', 'first_name' => 'Quz']);\nSentry::update(14, ['password' => 'haha', 'first_name' => 'Quz']); // New\n```\n\nThird:\n\n``` php\n$user = User::find(14);\n$user->password = Hash::make('haha');\n$user->save();\n```\n\nI kinda like the ability to use Sentry's wrappers to hash passwords, but I also like the fact that you don't HAVE to use Sentry to do anything, except authenticating.\n. @brunogaspar see 96a25f8453b0078b1ace01e831b476803c6f48dd\n. Comes down to finishing unit tests and documenting changes really. \n\nAt this point though Tom we're hard set on getting platform 2 RC3 out the door :)\n\nFor a demo, see the Cartalyst/sentry-3-demo repo. \n\nSent from my iPhone\nPlease excuse my brevity\n\n> On 15 Dec 2013, at 7:46 am, Tom Schlick notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> Whats the timeline on this?

Sentry doesn\u2019t need a method, it\u2019s not going in. Use your own implementations \u2014 User::all();.

To expand, Bruno, let's remove that method.\n\nOverride the model (In Laravel. `php artisan config:publish cartalyst/sentry`). Rename the model class to a class of your own (you can implement it all or just extend `Cartalyst\\Sentry\\Users\\EloquentUser`).\n\nThen, build fancy queries directly with your Eloquent model, or another interface you design that your model implements (if you want to switch Eloquent out in the future).\n\nIf Sentry doesn't need a method, don't add it. It's up to the implementor to implement.\n.

Wait, not what you said. \n. We are not requiring it. I'm not bloating the shit out if our deps (the reason Laravel has removed it, there's like 14 packages which have to be downloaded) just to support migrations in Laravel. \n\nPersonally, my opinion is, Laravel has messed with a lot of third party packages this way, it's their problem to address or educate people on. \n. Ah okay. But, we are not adding it. Heck, we don't require illuminate/database which all of our models use. In fact, I need to check, but I don't even think we need illuminate/events.

Hey @weotch, I'm currently working on implementing a whole new throttling structure to fix all the oversights.\n\nThanks for your input and I'm taking it into account with the new version of Sentry that we're working on!\n. Hi,\n\nI think your best shot here is running your own fork of Sentry possibly. I think this is coupling Sentry to LDAP, which I think is a niche market.\n\nAlso, we definitely cannot update our read me to say `SentryLdap is a fork of Cartalyst Sentry library. Added new features like ldap authentication.SentryLdap` :P \n\nI'd be interested in hearing @brunogaspar and @drsii's thoughts on this.\n. Just regarding throttling, in Sentry 3 we\u2019ve completely overhauled how it works.\n\nIn Sentry 3, there\u2019s configurable thresholds for global throttling (DDoS), IP throttling (DDoS or some little shit trying to hack multiple accounts) and account throttling. It\u2019s pretty awesome.\n\nOn 18 Feb 2014, at 8:02 am, Dustin Graham notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> @anndro I am using ldap to authenticate.

Could be a bit tricky. I guess this also exposes an issue with the master Sentry branch -- throttling may not be used if the user does not exist. I don't think there's a solution for this, just something to be aware of.

Hey, Not sure what's happening here but it appears your merge hasn't happened cleanly.\n\nAre you able to remove your repo, do a fresh fork and copy in your changes, to concatenate the 30-ish commits? Just trying to keep the repo history clean if possible.\n. Hey,\n\nI'll actually cherry-pick your commits into the working branch and merge your PR in the command line :)\n. Honestly, 3.0 would be called 2.1 if I wasn't strictly following [Semver versioniong](http://semver.org).\n\nThe database will stay identical, it's just the API may not be backwards compatible with reference to User methods (I'm stripping a bunch methods not used by Sentry).\n\nI'm also rewriting the throttling and that's not backwards compatible. However, if your extent of Sentry usage is just methods through the Sentry class (i.e., `Sentry::authenticate()`, `Sentry::register()` [essentially what's documented] etc), then the upgrade path should be completely benign. If not, I'll document here how to upgrade and of course we'll have new docs for 3.0 :)\n. @philsturgeon will be happy about multiple login columns and custom hashing strategies, two features he's been nagging me about for quite a while, in particular through pyrocms/pyrocms#2884.\n. Sounds awesome! I like that.\n\nJust fork sentry, work on the \u201cDevelop\u201d branch and send through a PR.

I've also prepared for your StrictPermissions implementation. The great thing about how I've structured it is, you only need to override one method from `BasePermissions`, which is `preparePermissions()`. That will return a flat array of permissions, using whatever logic it wants. This is where you'll build the array of group permissions, and then remove the group permissions who are present in the user object :) Just return that array, and everything will work :) Cool, eh?\n. @marcvdm the idea is that this object is populated once, whenever permissions are requested. At this stage, the object is initialised with all user and group permissions (which will load fast through our eloquent drivers as we'll use full eager loading and query caching where possible).\n\nYou need to iterate through and give back a flat array of permissions. So, the way I'd do it is, loop through all user permissions and put them in the flat array. Then, loop through groups. Only add the group if the permission doesn't exist in the user permissions (regardless of it's value).\n\nI'd stash what you have done and pull in the latest stuff I pushed, you'll see the method there to override :)\n. You're making it hard on yourself. You [just need to pull in and modify this](https://github.com/cartalyst/sentry/blob/develop/src/Cartalyst/Sentry/Permissions/StrictPermissions.php#L26-L34).\n\nIt would only require [something like this](http://paste.laravel.com/18BC) for the logic you're after. I'd like you to put in the PR though if you're comfortable :)\n. The other way would be something [like this](http://paste.laravel.com/18BM). This way, group permissions are still an opt-in system where any opt-out (false) value will deny the permission.\n\nOtherwise, the order of the groups matters, because only the first group with the permission has the value which is required.\n\nFood for thought...\n. Release date? No.\n\nOnce Laravel 4.1's API stops changing daily, we will add support to Sentry 2 (which involves just adjusting cookies and sessions).\n. A PR for 4.0 and 4.1 support is always welcome for Sentry 2 :)\n. We could make 2 session classes. Look at the Laravel version and return a different class. \n\nOr, remove the type check and do an if() statement in the constructor to check the Jar is a valid instance. \n\nSent from my iPhone\nPlease excuse my brevity\n\n> On 22 Nov 2013, at 5:59 pm, John Maguire notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> Sure.

Hi guys,\n\nProud to present the first alpha of Sentry 3. It's tested in a real app, I haven't pushed all the unit tests yet.\n\nPlease [download the demo app](https://github.com/cartalyst/sentry-3-demo/) and:\n1. Install dependencies through composer\n2. Configure database and migrate with `--package=cartalyst/sentry` option.\n3. Visit `/register` on the virtual host you setup.\n\nBy default, we are using throttling and activation checks. To enable SwiftIdentity, simply register on their site, then publish Sentry's config and follow the instructions there (be sure to configure the `swift` component and also enable it as a `checkpoint`).\n\nDocs coming soon, but would love to get the public involved in the early testing of Sentry 3!\n. Demo coming within a day or so as well of the whole setup, with SwiftIdentity enabled.\n. @marcvdm  - yes - you will need to configure your database, we can't do that for you\n. Sure, that's because we're loading (in that specific app) things from the database -- normally you'd start your app without sentry installed and configured.\n. A stock Laravel app with a dependency of cartalyst/sentry (or any\\* other package) shouldn't touch the database, only if something is hooked on each request to hit it.\n. Yep, so there's 3 ways to go about it... Haven't really decided on a \"recommended\" way, because I don't care much for conventions :p \n\nFirst:\n\n``` php\n$user = Sentry::findByCredentials(['login' => 'foo@bar.com']);\nSentry::getUserProvider()->update($user, ['password' => 'haha', 'first_name' => 'Quz']);\nSentry::update($user, ['password' => 'haha', 'first_name' => 'Quz']); // New\n```\n\nSecond:\n\n``` php\nSentry::getUserProvider()->update(14, ['password' => 'haha', 'first_name' => 'Quz']);\nSentry::update(14, ['password' => 'haha', 'first_name' => 'Quz']); // New\n```\n\nThird:\n\n``` php\n$user = User::find(14);\n$user->password = Hash::make('haha');\n$user->save();\n```\n\nI kinda like the ability to use Sentry's wrappers to hash passwords, but I also like the fact that you don't HAVE to use Sentry to do anything, except authenticating.\n. @brunogaspar see 96a25f8453b0078b1ace01e831b476803c6f48dd\n. Comes down to finishing unit tests and documenting changes really. \n\nAt this point though Tom we're hard set on getting platform 2 RC3 out the door :)\n\nFor a demo, see the Cartalyst/sentry-3-demo repo. \n\nSent from my iPhone\nPlease excuse my brevity\n\n> On 15 Dec 2013, at 7:46 am, Tom Schlick notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> Whats the timeline on this?

To expand, Bruno, let's remove that method.\n\nOverride the model (In Laravel. `php artisan config:publish cartalyst/sentry`). Rename the model class to a class of your own (you can implement it all or just extend `Cartalyst\\Sentry\\Users\\EloquentUser`).\n\nThen, build fancy queries directly with your Eloquent model, or another interface you design that your model implements (if you want to switch Eloquent out in the future).\n\nIf Sentry doesn't need a method, don't add it. It's up to the implementor to implement.\n.

Thanks!\n. We're in a bit of a pickle here. Laravel 4.1 requires that we attack it this way.\n\nThanks for the PR, but I don't think we can accept this in. See #325 for more :)\n.

Wait, not what you said. \n. We are not requiring it. I'm not bloating the shit out if our deps (the reason Laravel has removed it, there's like 14 packages which have to be downloaded) just to support migrations in Laravel. \n\nPersonally, my opinion is, Laravel has messed with a lot of third party packages this way, it's their problem to address or educate people on. \n. Ah okay. But, we are not adding it. Heck, we don't require illuminate/database which all of our models use. In fact, I need to check, but I don't even think we need illuminate/events. And if I do some magic we could potentially remove illuminate/support, though I'm not too stressed about it being there. \n\nSent from my iPhone\nPlease excuse my brevity\n\n> On 5 Jan 2014, at 7:08 am, Bruno Gaspar notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> @bencorlett was on Sentry Social, because it requires, Sentry.\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Passing false is not valid though?\n. Passing \"true\" is a backwards compatible thing to activate a user. Passing a closure is a callback. Passing \"false\" is an invalid argument. \n.

So I've given careful consideration to all the opinions here, and moving forward, I believe PHP 5.4 is the way to go.\n\nPHP 5.5 is an overkill as it severely limits the market and there's no features that are going to aid development and simplify the codebase (like those available in PHP 5.4).\n\nSentry 2.\\* will be maintained for the foreseeable future with bug fixes and community-supplied features, so don't fret that you're going to just lose support!\n.

Not sure what the problem is, you are using Sentry outside a Framework?\n. Well you don't need to use the `users` table that we provide, but you will need to have the other tables if you want to use all the features.\n\nMaybe your table wasn't setup correctly?\n\nIf you want, you can post your SQL here and we'll try to debug it.\n. Hi,\n\nSeems good to me, but can you please add in some spaces so that the equal signs (=) stays in line like on the `clearLoginAttemptsIfAllowed()` ?\n. Thank you =)\n. Hi,\n\nI like what you want to achieve here, but i \"don't\" agree with you, if im a super user, i don't need to have permissions assigned to me, i should be able to access everything, thats the whole point of the `super user`, but let's wait for @bencorlett opinion.\n\nBut can you explain what your use case for this is?\n\nThanks!\n. Hi,\n\nYeah, i'm seeing your point and like i said, i like the PR but i wasn't to sure of the usage of this.\n\nIm fine with this, it just needs some tweaks to not call the `getMergedPermissions()` everytime you call this method and some tests, but wait for @bencorlett opinion on this one!\n\nThanks again!\n. @bencorlett His use case is somewhat to what we've done on the Platform 2 User Management extension, and my guess is that he wants to loop through his own permissions and check if a user has that permission or not to make the checkbox or radio button checked/selected.\n\nEven though he is a `super user` we can assign permissions to him, in case we drop this flag from the user.\n. Thanks\n. Yes, this is perfectly acceptable, and makes sense, but let's wait for @bencorlett input!\n. @nikoskip You can always submit a PR to the docs.\n. Ah ok i see, that docs link is outdated the new link is this one https://cartalyst.com/manual/sentry/users/find#find-all-the-users-in-a-group we need to do a redirect on the old ones, but we have been a bit \"lazy\".\n.

No, but we are aware of this, and will be fixed as soon as possible.\n. Thanks, i will have @bencorlett to have a look at it, but i think we could have this on the inGroup method instead of a new method\n. Not sure what @bencorlett input is but going to give you mine again, with some code, so i prefer to have only one method, but to have the option to still passing an object, so my idea is, we could check that if the `$group` is an intance of GroupInterface, if true we use the object method, otherwise we check against the normal var\n\n``` php\npublic function inGroup($group)\n{\n    foreach ($this->getGroups() as $_group)\n    {\n        if ($group instanceof GroupInterface)\n        {\n            if ($_group->getId() == $group->getId())\n            {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            if ($_group->getName() == $group)\n            {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSomething like this, it can be tidied up a bit, but just to give an idea.\n. Interesting, i kinda like it to be honest.\n\nNot sure if it is doable to implement this though, but i like it, and what about having methods like\n\n`user()` which returns the `getUserProvider()`\n`group()` which returns the `getGroupProvider()`\n`throttle()` which returns the `getThrottleProvider()`\n\nSo this way we could use it like `Sentry::user()->findByID(1)`\n\nMore cleaner imo, but not sure..\n\ncc @bencorlett \n. Can you please take a look at the tests?\n. Thanks :)\n. Can you please take a look at the tests?\n. Thanks again\n. The only issue as i mentioned on IRC is the use of Config::get() will let Ben review but i believe we need to do it in another way :)\n. @bencorlett maybe we could inject the app container into sentry somehow? through the __constructor? bad idea? But this is something im wondering for best practices for other packages aswell that can/should work outside laravel itself but using laravel components.\n. After some \"discussion\" on irc, maybe we need a getter/setter method somewhere to set the correct model to use the correct model name, even if we change it on the sentry config.\n. Thanks dude.\n. Thanks\n. Thanks\n. Looks awesome, can you just fix the docblocks a bit? They just need one space before each `*`, so that all the `*` get's aligned, this is on the header notice and on the various docblocks.\n. Thanks\n. Cool thanks.\n. Thanks!\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. Thanks.\n. Thanks\n. Thanks, i will have a play on see if i can manage to tweak it out a bit later =)\n. Thanks,\n. Thanks!!\n. Hi,\n\nIn my honest opinion, i don't feel on integrating MD5 hashing functionality on Sentry is a good thing, mostly because, MD5 is bad, week and can be easily decrypted nowadays.\n\nI understand that you are now using Sentry with an old users database, but you should consider upgrading those passwords to a use a better and more secure hasher..\n\nYou can do it on a large scale, where you force your users to reset their passwords, it's not a bad thing, since you are improving security.\n\nOr, when a user tries to login, you check if the password you have on the database, for that user is an MD5 hash, if yes, you compare the password the user input with the password you have on the database, if they match, you update the user with the inputted password, so that it stores the password with the new hash format.\n\nBut anyway, like i mentioned, i'm not going to merge this in, if @bencorlett wants to merge it in is up to him.\n. Looks good to me, there are some code style changes needed but i guess we can do them after unless you want to tackle them =P\n. Sure no worries and we appreciate the effort =)\n\n@bencorlett Looks good to merge? :+1: \n. Well, yeah the way you mentioned on IRC on how you would tackle the issue is a bit hacky for me, that's why i said it would most likely not be merged, but to be honest i care less on how it is done, as long as it is fixed and works with both versions i'm \"ok\" with it.\n. Found an issue\n- When updating a user password, the password doesn't get hashed automatically;\n\nEdit:\n\nActually, we now need to use `Sentry::getUserRepository()->update($this->user, Input::all());` where `$this->user` is a User object\n. Thanks, that cleans the code a bit =)\n. Yeah probably, i can add that really quickly\n. Added.\n. it's the end of the wooooorld xD\n. Removed\n. Yeah i'm following.\n. Once we have time to finish the docs and tests, not a big priority atm.\n. Fixed.\n\nTo get a list of users, `$users = Sentry::getUserRepository()->createModel()->get();` then you just iterate over it.\n. @rydurham you probably have an outdated version, because that migration has a where clause https://github.com/cartalyst/sentry/blob/develop/src/migrations/2013_11_26_023945_migration_cartalyst_sentry_rename_alter_groups.php#L54\n. Yeah, i'll tag in a few.\n. @tomschlick We've thought about it, but not everyone has the same opinion, so we're leaving Sentry 2 Open and since Sentry 3 wasn't released we took the opportunity to rebrand it and make it Paid Source.\n. Hi and thanks.\n\nI agree with you, but this is one of those situations, because, Sentry is not only used on Laravel, therefore we shouldn't require it but either suggest it, like how Laravel has on their composer.json,  but i'm ok on having it directly on the `require` as it solves the issue for lazy people, what's your input @bencorlett?\n. @bencorlett was on Sentry Social, because it requires, Sentry.\n. Fixed.\n. Thanks :+1: \n. Thanks!\n. I think i've fixed the composer.json issue, waiting for it to finish, as it was passing locally.\n. The change you're pull requesting is for Sentry 3 but you are doing the pull request on the `master` branch which is Sentry 2.\n. We don't have the docs updated but we have a very basic Sentry 3 demo here https://github.com/cartalyst/demo-sentry.\n. Thanks.\n. Yeah, fix tests and fix code standards as well.\n. 10000 points to Hufflepuff :+1: \n. Yeah, i'm with @bencorlett, it doesn't make any sense to release the version 3 then version 4.\n\nThis should be merged into develop :+1: \n. Thanks\n. Thanks, you forgot to squash!\n\nJk =P\n. ahaha i was joking =)\n. This should be fixed.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks, let's hope it works now hah\n. I'm ok with the change, but what's the benefit of using Carbon over DateTime?\n. What's the point of having two extra methods to set properties as null?\n. Thanks.\n. Thanks.\n. This should be sent to the `docs/2.1` branch.\n\nThanks.\n. Tests are failing\n. Sorry but i don't see where this helps anyone, if you need such change, you should create your own User model, extend the base Sentry User model, they update it on the Sentry config file on this line https://github.com/cartalyst/sentry/blob/master/src/config/config.php#L123\n. If you want to create test PR/Issues create on your repository, next time you'll be blocked.\n. Sorry but i'll have to decline this, Sentry is feature freeze.\n. Please send this to the `2.1` branch and make the if statement to look the same as the other if's\n\n``` php\nif ($ci->db->pconnect)\n{\n    $pdo = $ci->db->db_pconnect(); \n}\nelse \n{\n    $pdo = $ci->db->db_connect(); \n}\n```\n\nor something like\n\n``` php\n$method = $ci->db->pconnect ? 'db_pconnect' : 'db_connect';\n\n$pdo = $ci->db->{$method}();\n```\n. The tests for this are failing.\n. If this is still required, please send the patch to the `2.1` branch with the tests updated.\n. The tests are failing.\n. If this is still required, please reopen and update the tests.\n. I understand your use case, but the code you submitted is not done properly and you should do something like the following which is very simple otherwise create a function somewhere on your application to achieve this\n\n``` php\n$groupName = 'Administrators';\n\n$group = Sentry::findGroupByName($groupName);\n\n$inGroup = Sentry::inGroup($group);\n```\n. Thanks!\n. We are not supporting Laravel 5 at this time.\n. @a3gis Check the feature/laravel-5 branch, we don't have any release date though.\n. Sorry for not getting back to you, will add some comments on lines that are not correct and if you can update them awesome. Also after the changes please squash to one commit.\n. What does this fix?\n. This is on the wrong branch sorry.\n. To the same branch you did the changes from, `feature/laravel-5`.\n. Send this to the `2.1` branch instead.\n. :+1: \n. You've updated the name of the package on the `composer.json`, which you shouldn't.\n\nBut i don't believe i'll be able to merge this, while it fixes the behaviour it introduces a breaking change..\n. @aleemb Sentinel is already open source.\n. I don't think you need to use `empty()` here as a simple if check can perform the same and keeps consistency.\n\n``` php\nif ( ! $resetCode)\n{\n    return false;\n}\n```\n\nAlso update the Kohana User class as well please to also return false instead of throwing the exception.\n. @BackEndTea It's tagged.. I don't think merging would make it work on Laravel 5.* since the dependencies are locked to Laravel 4.0.9 till 4.2. Thanks\n. @dannewns Thanks!\n\n@bencorlett Should be fixed now..\n. Hi Steve, i'm not following the problem here.\n\nYou say that your user is created then you get the activation code, but when you look into the database the user is not stored?\n. Not sure what the problem is, you are using Sentry outside a Framework?\n. Well you don't need to use the `users` table that we provide, but you will need to have the other tables if you want to use all the features.\n\nMaybe your table wasn't setup correctly?\n\nIf you want, you can post your SQL here and we'll try to debug it.\n. Hi,\n\nSeems good to me, but can you please add in some spaces so that the equal signs (=) stays in line like on the `clearLoginAttemptsIfAllowed()` ?\n. Thank you =)\n. Hi,\n\nI like what you want to achieve here, but i \"don't\" agree with you, if im a super user, i don't need to have permissions assigned to me, i should be able to access everything, thats the whole point of the `super user`, but let's wait for @bencorlett opinion.\n\nBut can you explain what your use case for this is?\n\nThanks!\n. Hi,\n\nYeah, i'm seeing your point and like i said, i like the PR but i wasn't to sure of the usage of this.\n\nIm fine with this, it just needs some tweaks to not call the `getMergedPermissions()` everytime you call this method and some tests, but wait for @bencorlett opinion on this one!\n\nThanks again!\n. @bencorlett His use case is somewhat to what we've done on the Platform 2 User Management extension, and my guess is that he wants to loop through his own permissions and check if a user has that permission or not to make the checkbox or radio button checked/selected.\n\nEven though he is a `super user` we can assign permissions to him, in case we drop this flag from the user.\n. Thanks\n. Yes, this is perfectly acceptable, and makes sense, but let's wait for @bencorlett input!\n. @nikoskip You can always submit a PR to the docs.\n. Ah ok i see, that docs link is outdated the new link is this one https://cartalyst.com/manual/sentry/users/find#find-all-the-users-in-a-group we need to do a redirect on the old ones, but we have been a bit \"lazy\".\n. Fixed!\n. No worries :)\n. Thanks\n. You need to send the PR again, but to the master branch instead, because the 1.1/develop is for Sentry 1\n. Thanks :)\n. Thanks man, we will look into this soon!\n. Thanks :)\n. Hi,\n\nThanks for the PR, but is it possible for you to fix the unit tests?\n. Thanks, you're awesome :)\n. Thanks man!\n. No, but we are aware of this, and will be fixed as soon as possible.\n. Thanks, i will have @bencorlett to have a look at it, but i think we could have this on the inGroup method instead of a new method\n. Not sure what @bencorlett input is but going to give you mine again, with some code, so i prefer to have only one method, but to have the option to still passing an object, so my idea is, we could check that if the `$group` is an intance of GroupInterface, if true we use the object method, otherwise we check against the normal var\n\n``` php\npublic function inGroup($group)\n{\n    foreach ($this->getGroups() as $_group)\n    {\n        if ($group instanceof GroupInterface)\n        {\n            if ($_group->getId() == $group->getId())\n            {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            if ($_group->getName() == $group)\n            {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSomething like this, it can be tidied up a bit, but just to give an idea.\n. Interesting, i kinda like it to be honest.\n\nNot sure if it is doable to implement this though, but i like it, and what about having methods like\n\n`user()` which returns the `getUserProvider()`\n`group()` which returns the `getGroupProvider()`\n`throttle()` which returns the `getThrottleProvider()`\n\nSo this way we could use it like `Sentry::user()->findByID(1)`\n\nMore cleaner imo, but not sure..\n\ncc @bencorlett \n. Can you please take a look at the tests?\n. Thanks :)\n. Can you please take a look at the tests?\n. Thanks again\n. The only issue as i mentioned on IRC is the use of Config::get() will let Ben review but i believe we need to do it in another way :)\n. @bencorlett maybe we could inject the app container into sentry somehow? through the __constructor? bad idea? But this is something im wondering for best practices for other packages aswell that can/should work outside laravel itself but using laravel components.\n. After some \"discussion\" on irc, maybe we need a getter/setter method somewhere to set the correct model to use the correct model name, even if we change it on the sentry config.\n. Thanks dude.\n. Thanks\n. Thanks\n. Looks awesome, can you just fix the docblocks a bit? They just need one space before each `*`, so that all the `*` get's aligned, this is on the header notice and on the various docblocks.\n. Thanks\n. Cool thanks.\n. Thanks!\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. Thanks.\n. Thanks\n. Thanks, i will have a play on see if i can manage to tweak it out a bit later =)\n. Thanks,\n. Thanks!!\n. Hi,\n\nIn my honest opinion, i don't feel on integrating MD5 hashing functionality on Sentry is a good thing, mostly because, MD5 is bad, week and can be easily decrypted nowadays.\n\nI understand that you are now using Sentry with an old users database, but you should consider upgrading those passwords to a use a better and more secure hasher..\n\nYou can do it on a large scale, where you force your users to reset their passwords, it's not a bad thing, since you are improving security.\n\nOr, when a user tries to login, you check if the password you have on the database, for that user is an MD5 hash, if yes, you compare the password the user input with the password you have on the database, if they match, you update the user with the inputted password, so that it stores the password with the new hash format.\n\nBut anyway, like i mentioned, i'm not going to merge this in, if @bencorlett wants to merge it in is up to him.\n. Looks good to me, there are some code style changes needed but i guess we can do them after unless you want to tackle them =P\n. Sure no worries and we appreciate the effort =)\n\n@bencorlett Looks good to merge? :+1: \n. Well, yeah the way you mentioned on IRC on how you would tackle the issue is a bit hacky for me, that's why i said it would most likely not be merged, but to be honest i care less on how it is done, as long as it is fixed and works with both versions i'm \"ok\" with it.\n. Found an issue\n- When updating a user password, the password doesn't get hashed automatically;\n\nEdit:\n\nActually, we now need to use `Sentry::getUserRepository()->update($this->user, Input::all());` where `$this->user` is a User object\n. Thanks, that cleans the code a bit =)\n. Yeah probably, i can add that really quickly\n. Added.\n. it's the end of the wooooorld xD\n. Removed\n. Yeah i'm following.\n.

Sure. Looking deeper into it, it seems like if switching to the 4.1 cookie\nsyntax is not backwards compatible with 4.0 which I actually expect it will\nbe, there is a variable defined within Laravel to check the version of the\nframework running.\nOn Nov 22, 2013 1:20 AM, \"Bruno Gaspar\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Well, yeah the way you mentioned on IRC on how you would tackle the issue\n> is a bit hacky for me, that's why i said it would most likely not be\n> merged, but to be honest i care less on how it is done, as long as it is\n> fixed and works with both versions i'm \"ok\" with it.\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/cartalyst/sentry/pull/317#issuecomment-29051250\n> .\n. @bencorlett My thought was originally to check whether the get() method existed on the CookieJar, but that seemed like a dirty hack. Instead, if necessary, we can check the Laravel version and instance it properly based on that. However, it is possible that the new preferred method for Laravel 4.1 will be backwards compatible with Laravel 4.0, in which case it would simply require an update to to the current class. Again, I haven't had a ton of time to look at it yet.\n. As I understand it that error should not be thrown on install though.
