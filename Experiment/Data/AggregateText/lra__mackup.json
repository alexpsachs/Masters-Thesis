    "lra": "Merged in, thx =)\n. Mmmh, that's scary.\nI never had the problem.\n\nCan you give me the output of those 3 commands ? (No personal info shared)\n- `ls -l \"$HOME/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/\"`\n- `ls -l \"$HOME/Dropbox/Mackup/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/\"` (modify this if Dropbox is not the root of your home folder)\n- `id`\n. Cool.\nMaybe you need to reload ST2 to let it know that his files moved ?\n. The PR wasn't up to date, but it's been merged in with small changes.\n\nThx\n. For subversion, what about just syncing `.subversion/config` ? I'm always scared to sync host-specific files. What else is in the .subversion folder ?\n. I guess you are right for subversion, it's mostly cached credentials and server pub keys.\n. I agree.\n\nWhat would be a good command name for it ? `mackup uninstall` ?\n. Done. Thx for the suggestion.\n. Merged in, thx\n\nI'll certainly support config+plugins in the future which might make more sense for this kind of stuff.\n. Merged in, thx\n. Sorry but I can't let a stranger's tinyurl in, even if I'd own it, as people want to know what they download.\nPreviewing is not an option too. Shortening it won't make the install faster anyway.\nEven http://brew.sh/ show the full url.\n. You are right ;)\n. Merged in, thx\n. Merged in, thx\n. Merged in, thx\n. Hey, on this page I can see other files:\nhttp://support.alfredapp.com/kb:persisting-preferences\n\nIs their doc outdated ?\n. Merged in, thx\n. The intent is good, but the idea of mackup is to focus on config, `/usr/bin` belongs to the system and is there on a clean install.\nA better idea would be to sync `/usr/local/bin` but this is handled by other tools like `homebrew`\n\nTo solve this, I usually create and sync a `~/bin` folder where I put my executables, but it's pure personal behavior and I wasn't sure it was worth putting in mackup.\n\nWould it solve your problem ? \n. Merged in, thx\n. Damn I forgot that I can't sync ~/bin yet, as I enforce a 0600 mode on synced files, which will remove the +x bit to your bin files.\n\nI'll add this to the TODO and come with some way to do this later\n. Merged in, thx, I'm a little worried about the version being part of the config folder, aren't there other folders that we could add for other versions ?\n. Ok we'll see if other users add more folders or complain, thx\n. It is mentioned here https://github.com/lra/mackup#bullsht-what-does-it-really-do-to-my-files- but I did not want to clutter the CLI, as the more you put there, the less people pay attention to it.\n\nIt could break things, but mackup prompts a lot when things are not straightforward too (like an already existing file by a link)\n\nI'm open to suggestion to make things more clear, without adding noise.\n. Can you give me the output of `ls -al /Users/dbingham/Library/Application Support/SourceTree/` and `ls -al \"Dropbox/Mackup/Library/Application Support/SourceTree/\"` ?\n. Can you try this version ? https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/fix_sourcetree/mackup.py\nReplace your current mackuped sourcetree files if asked.\n\nIf it breaks anything, just move back your \"Application Support/SourceTree\" from Mackup to your user's library.\n. Thanks that helps I'll work on this\n. Could you try the latest version of https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/fix_sourcetree/mackup.py ?\nIt should fix all those problems for good.\n. you can bring back the sourcetree folder and `chflags -R uchg` it before.\n. For the chmod and xattrs being cleaned up, it's because dropbox uses a default umask of 0644 for files, and when you sync your ssh keys (or any other license) you don't (and can't for ssh) have your key files readable by anyone.\n\nAs I don't think it make sense for any user config file to be readable by anyone, I just blindly enforce a mode of 0600 to any synced file.\n\nThe xattrs are cleaned up, because OS X use them to set some ACL that prevent mackup to move some files around too, and I don't see the point of keeping those special ACLs if I 0600 any file. But I might be wrong here.\n\nAbout `hostusernamemap`, if you think it's a file that should be synced, we can add it to the list, feel free to tell me which file to sync here as I'm not a user of SourceTree.\n. Makes sense, merging in, thx for your help\n. That's an awesome idea, I tried and sadly it appears that Font Book and the whole OS X font system does not support a linked folder =(\n. If you want to try for yourself and find a way to make it work:\n\n``` bash\ncd\nchmod -N Library/Fonts\nmv Library/Fonts TestingFonts\nln -s ~/TestingFonts Library/Fonts\n```\n\nAnd open Font Book, your user fonts are gone.\n\nTo rollback:\n\n``` bash\ncd\nrm Library/Fonts\nmv TestingFonts Library/Fonts\n```\n\nBut I'm missing something, as my font are not back in Font Book.\n\nCan someone have more info ?\n. Logout/login to bring back the font and you move back the folder into place, but I still can't get the fonts in Font Book and the folder is linked to mackup's\n. @zenwheel this is a good idea.\nTried some stuff, hard link for folders are internally supported on HFS+, but not available command line (man ln)\n\nIf I use the system call, I can hard link a folder to dropbox, but it does not detect the changes later.\n\nBut apparently it does if I copy the folder to Dropbox 1st, and hardlink it outside later.\n\nIt might work, Im not sure yet, it might need some more work.\n. Depends on https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/613 1st\n. Merged in, thx\n. Merged in, thx\nCan you update your branch against master before doing a PR ? It will make things easier for me !\n. https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#get-official-support-for-an-application\n. Isn't Chrome supposed to sync everything itself when you login in with your Google account ?\n. PRed in https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/153\n. @TimCorcoran you r right sir\n. That's an awesome idea.\nLike @nZac said, a basic config file is almost in: https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/49\n\nWhen in, I'll release 0.4 and that's something that can be worked on.\n\nWhat I was thinking is a `Storage` section with the supported engines (have a better name ?)\n\ne.g.\n\n``` ini\n[Storage]\nDropbox\n```\n\nWould enable the actual dropbox engine and its folder detection, as no path is specified. or:\n\n``` ini\n[Storage]\nFolder: /path/to/expandrive/folder\n```\n\nWould store the links in the specified folder.\n\nOnly one should be enabled at a time, or it would error out.\n\nThis is just a rough idea. Thoughts welcome.\n. Like @chrishas35 proposed, we could also enforce this behavior by using command line args (we should maybe also do it for ignored apps BTW)\n. Supported in 0.7.\nSee https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/doc/README.md\n. Mackup is very simple, your ST2 files are either in `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/` either in `~/Dropbox/Mackup/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/`\n\nHopefully it did not break anything serious.\n. That's interesting, but I think we should do something better, like detecting that ST2 is running, and if it's the case, exiting with this message.\n\nDo you know how to detect that ST2 is running ? process list ? any lock file created ? There must be a way\n. I can do a\n\n``` bash\npgrep \"Sublime Text 2\"\n```\n\nbut I'd prefer a python way\n. Yeah, I try to avoid deps at all cost to have a simple install.\nI did this: https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/43c5410edce0d6bd7745a1510c7b57e41092dcc1\nIf it cause any trouble, please open an issue again.\nThx !\n. Thanks a lot ! That has given me the will to finally support a config file, wouldn't have done it this well, with py3 support ;)\nI hope you don't mind, I took your PR and moved things around a bit.\nPlease check it out: https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/49\n. That's perfect\nI'm trusting you for apps I don't own.\n. Well, the specified folder is 3.3GiB on my Mac, we should try to only sync the config, not the data ;)\nAny other suggestion ? If not I'll take a look when I have time\n. Tried and when launching Sparrow, it asks me to create my account (I have 2)\nReverted to original files, and Sparrow works again.\n. Leaving this opened in case anyone feels like digging into syncing Sparrow\n. Depends on https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/615\n. Does not work, the problem is that you need Terminal.app open to run Mackup, and when you close it, it overwrites any synced config.\nI did not figured a way to go around this yet. Any idea ?\n. I'll give it another try if you confirm\n. Cool, if you manage to find an easy one day, help appreciated !\nI'm using Terminal and it's one of the few apps I need to manually configure =(\n. Trusting you on this one\n. aaaaw too late, I'll revert\n. open another PR pls\n. Awesome !\nYou should maybe linke 0.3.2, the tag exists.\nYou can always update it later.\n. I mean that your linked to https://raw.github.com/lra/mackup/0.1/mackup.py while https://raw.github.com/lra/mackup/0.3.2/mackup.py is more recent.\n\nBut that might be your intention.\n. You need to change the sha1 then ;)\n. It's in this state https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/pull/19879\n. Done, thx !\n. I started from scratch but got it merged ;) https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/d6a244b0882170feb034ca81b23b714e5dea9664\n. :thumbsup: @nZac \n. @nZac Yep I'll bump it on master\nForgot to handle the case sensitivity, feel free to propose a better solution if it's not aesthetic enough, I'm not super proud of it ;)\n\nI'll sleep on it anyway.\n. It depends on the applications, but I don't see why there would be a problem.\nYou can open an issue if you find any and we'll look into it =)\n. I just released 0.4, and merged your other PR (it closed this PR automatically)\nFeel free to reopen this one against `master`, we'll do a 4.X for this ;)\nSupport for multiple engines was getting in the way, kind of.\n. Wow, that's super helpful, I'll review/test/polish this tonight hopefully\nI planed to do this post 0.4, but we can give this a shot =)\n. Location would only be needed for dumb engines (like storing the files in a simple folder)\nAny engine that can detect the folder automatically will not accept a path, like Dropbox or GDrive.\n\nBoth can coexist =) No worries I'll clear things up by merging things one after the other\n. `mackup.cfg` is in btw\n. This weekend I hope =)\n. Added the support for nvALT on master, try to keep PR isolated, they'll get merged faster ;)\n. Mackup has been modularized a bit so it's easier to add support for things like this.\nThis is gonna happen =)\n. Supported in 0.7.\nSee https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/doc/README.md\n. @hakubo it should be in, thx to @TimCorcoran !\n. https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#get-official-support-for-an-application\n. Yes sorry, I'll push a hotfix !\n. Cool I'll trust you on this one =)\n. Merged in\n. It's been fixed, thx\n. Sure,\n\nWhat are those files ? Why would you want to sync them ?\n\nIn the near future, Mackup will have an easy to let the user add synced paths and files, you should not have to fork for this.\n. https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#get-official-support-for-an-application\n. Sorry about that, thanks\n. Merged in, thx\n. It's in, thx =)\n. Merged in, thx\n. Need https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/615\n. @TimCorcoran I don't want to abuse, feel free to work on anything that's opened ;)\n. PR up for this https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/493\n. Thx, it's in\n. I'm not abandoning the project, check the commit logs, it's constantly updated =)\nIt's true that merging apps and features in a single commit does not make it easy to review/merge.\nBut also some features require more thoughts before getting merged in.\nMackup is touching user's files and we don't want to mess anyone's system out there.\n\nRegarding the other fork, I've been told that the guy spammed mackup's contributors. He got excited, forked and changed the name, merged some PR and that's about it. I don't really care but let me help you with the link ;) https://github.com/matyhaty/dropboxAppSync\n\nOn mackup side, the big plan is to lay down a clear path for the features that have been asked. I don't care about the implementation, but the UX is important: it's a complex problem and I'm very careful to not make Mackup too complex (e.g. with command line args and config files in multiple formats that conflict each other).\n\nHope that clarifies =)\n. Yeah sorry, I misread about the email.\n\nRe what to do: Frankly I don't know, I never got the time to deeply think about it, and I don't want you to do something that's not gonna be used.\n\nBut in order to advance, I can tell you what I'm sure of: You can close this PR and create new ones:\n- One per app for each app supported (or with improved support if it's already in, I remember having merged some from you)\n- One for the custom apps feature. Whatever happens, this feature will be built and I'll merge your PR, or worst case, use your PR as a starting point.\n\nRegarding the feature, here are some thoughts:\n- It can be a big json file containing all the apps, near the binary, or a bunch of small json files, one per app, in a dedicated folder.\n- The actual json format used in mackup is simple (a list of path for each path) but it prevents us to do more, e.g. specify permissions for certain files, or specify files to exclude. It needs to be more specific and support future changes.\n- Do we put the json in the same repo (like homebrew) or in a different repo, acting as a mac application database that can be worked on separately.\n- What about ini or yaml as a file format ?\n- The installer needs to be improved if mackup is not just one file anymore, homebrew is fine.\n\nThere we go. If you create a new PR, feel free to paste/rephrase those questions, IMHO those need to be answered before starting the implementation.\n\nThanks for digging this up ;)\n. A GUI is definitely wanted, ref. https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/TODO.md\nLet's not diverge from the original intent of this PR though.\n. Ok, the custom app feature is in 0.6, which is out.\nA lot of burden needed to be solved, sorry about the time it took.\n\nFor the applications supported in this PR that are not in yet, please feel free to open a PR per app based off master.\n\nThanks for the suggestion and the work !\n. Thanks\n\nBefore merging in, we need:\n- to be sure that the commands exist, this can live in a function called in `_check_for_usable_environment()`\n- use constants for `Darwin` and `Linux`\n- put the system calls in explicit functions, to have platform independent `chmod` `delete` and `is_process_running`\n. Merged in, thx for the help !\n. No news here, more detail on how to best fix it would help.\nIt seems the problem is that mackup is trying to sync the whole `.gnupg` folder and there are sockets in it, which mackup does not know what to do with.\n\nCan you come up with an explicit list of which files mackup should sync in the `.gnupg` folder ?\n. Thanks, the problem is happening a lot as a bunch of new users are using mackup.\n\nI followed your advices and selectively sync this:\n\n``` python\n    'GnuPG': ['.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf',\n              '.gnupg/gpg.conf',\n              '.gnupg/secring.gpg',\n              '.gnupg/trustdb.gpg',\n              '.gnupg/pubring.gpg'],\n```\n\nThe gnupg doc is great at explaining what should be kept http://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg-devel/GPG-Configuration.html\n. I'll release a new version now\n. Merged it with some changes, thx\nRemoved some synced Spotify files which are more local cache\nAlso removed support for uTorrent, files are changing all the time\n\nIf you can improve the support for those, please open a PR again ;)\n\n++\n. I don't get it ;)\n. Thx it's in !\n. It's in, thx\n. It's in, thx\n. Mackup chowns 0700 or 0600 everything now.\n. How come ?\nIf you run sublime under your user, it should be able to read files that are user-readable by you.\nCan you get more details ?\n. Why are those files and dirs owned by root ?\n. Did you ever sudo'ed mackup ?\n. My suggestion here would be:\n\n``` bash\n$ sudo chown -R leoj \"/Users/leoj/Library/Application Support\"\n```\n\nNo file in your home should be owned by root.\n. Same with Mackup's files\n\n``` bash\n$ sudo chown -R leoj \"/wherever/your/dropbox/folder/is\"\n```\n. Actually, that's a good idea, I'll prevent mackup to run under sudo.\nAdded to the TODO\n. Should be in\n. It's in\n. On restore, should I check the link, and if pointing to nowhere, delete it ?\n. Dupe of https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/612\n. Added in https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/579d29ce67e711ce08933b2c0e11f676fcdb5369\n. Hi,\n\nCan you confirm we need to sync the whole `.bash_it` folder ?\n\nFrom https://github.com/revans/bash-it/blob/master/README.md it seems like `.bash_profile` and:\n- `aliases/custom.aliases.bash`\n- `lib/custom.bash`\n- `plugins/custom.plugins.bash`\n\nBut I'm not using it so I might be missing something.\n\nAny idea ?\n. Okay thanks. will sync the whole folder.\nMerging soon.\n. Merged, thx\n. Merged in, thx\n. Merged support for Htop and Janus.\nFor the other ones, can you open one PR per application ? And also make sure you only include config files ? e.g. I don't think you want to sync your vagrant images.\n\nThx\n. Thx it's in\n. I can't find any ref of this folder in the bash doc: http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html\nCan you give me a pointer ?\n. It's in, thx\n. `.heroku` has a lot of files.\nWe might want to explicitly save the config files here.\n. Ok but we are more talking about the specific heroku-account plugin here.\nWill merge with req changes to the PR.\nThx\n. It's in thx\n. Can you describe what the `.gem` and the `.bundler` folders are for ?\n. Ok thanks, will merge\n. It's in, thx\n. It's in thx\n. Dupe of https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/612\n. GJ, will add some doc about it.\n. Merged in\n. That's a good idea\n. Will try to reproduce it.\nIt's weird that mackup find those 2 files to sync, but can't copy them as they don't exist anymore when it tries to copy them into Dropbox...\n. I'm unable to reproduce it with a pristine Textmate 2 install.\nThe `iPhone.tmbundle` does not exist at all.\nDo you have a way to reproduce it ?\n. Do you still experience the problem?\n. Fixed in https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/34b727be360f5c17396d5630ddeef12c55cb43e1\n. Perfect PR :+1: \n. @tkeeler33 Thanks, WTG to ask upstream to support this kind of stuff.\n. Of great, they added it in the 10.9 command line tools, thx for the info !\n. Perfect, thx\n. It should already be the case, 0.5 added GNU/Linux support.\nPlease describe any problem you might encounter.\n. Can you give more details ?\nAre you using the same dropbox account on both computers ?\n\"It doesn't work\" does not help ;)\n. Right, I guess we need to exclude some folders to be synced on some platform, thx\n. Could you check if it's fixed in 0.5.1 ?\n. Can you list the files to sync ?\nYou can do a:\n\n``` bash\nls -l ~/Library/Preferences/com.stata.* ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Stata/\n```\n\nThanks\n. Same, tell me if there is a problem.\n. Tell me if it's not working\n. Thx\n. Added a TODO for encryption: https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/606\n. just merged a PR to not sync ssh keys by default https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/295\nif anyone wants to do one for GnuPG, you are welcome.\n. Merging this in https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/111\n. Merged in, thx\n. Merged in, thx\n. Merged in, thx\n. Passe le bonjour a OB ;)\n. Can you also add yourself in the changelog ?\n. Merged in, thx\n. Nice, I guess it's not needed then =)\n. If someone can get the blessing from the dev that's cool.\n. Sorry about that, I'm open to any suggestion as english is not my mother tongue.\nThe name used in the config file is the name defined in the application, at the top of the mackup.py file: https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup.py#L59\n\nCould you propose a modified README and comment in the config file to make it more clear ?\n. Clarified in https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/.mackup.cfg#L26\n. Merged in, thx\n. Can you open a PR ?\n. Yeah, we usually don't want to sync binaries\n. https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#get-official-support-for-an-application\n. PR welcomed\n. I can close this I suppose\n. I think that makes sense.\nIt will also be required when supported other storage engines, like GDrive.\n. Supported in 0.7.\nSee https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/doc/README.md\n. Already done\n. It's in, if there is any problem, open an issue and I'll disable the problematic app sync\n. A PR is welcome =)\n. Can you fix the typo ? Look at the test.\nThx\n. Perfect, thanks, @peterhajas feel free to tell if the 2nd file you mentioned does need to be synced\n. As @JakeBilbrey said, Alfred already support cloud syncing, can you remove it and add the 2 other apps in the README and the Changlog ?\nMore info on https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n\nThanks !\n. Thx, it's in\n. IMO we should not fight against their business model.\nIt also could cause conflicts for the paid version users who already sync it in Alfred.\n\nIn https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md I put:\n\n> Don't contribute an application that already provide a way to sync its config. e.g. Google Chrome or Alfred (paid version)\n\nI just made it more specific ;)\n. If someone can get their approval, I'm fine.\n. Thx, it's in\n. Sorry, too many things together in this PR, will have to close this.\nFeel free to create a PR per app support added.\n\nRegarding app store apps: Another issue exists: https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/615\n. https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#get-official-support-for-an-application\n. Not sure I understand, `.mackup.cfg` is already synced: https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup.py#L194\n. Closing this as the support for `.mackup.cfg` is in and I'm not sure it's a problem anymore. You might have been using an older version.\n. Merged in, thx\n. Right thanks =)\n. About Alfred 2, it might be a paid option, but it exists, and Mackup's goal is not to bypass some app business model ;)\nSee https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/116\n\nAbout the filezilla syncing, I don't see why it should not work.\nWe might want to add a dry/debug mode, it could help.\n\nTry putting some print lines where it make sense for now ?\n. Filezilla support is already in.\nSee https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/fcfc992ef7b36f20337ee9503337d66a70497158\nClosing this unless as it looks like it confuse some of us ;)\nUnless I'm missing something ?\n. @TimCorcoran True, but right now we have a simple approach. We might encrypt things in a future.\nActually that's a good idea, adding it in the TODO.\n. TODO: https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/606\n. Hi,\n\nThis multi-feature PR makes it hard to review and merge.\nCan you open a PR per feature you want to add ?\nGuidelines are available at https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n\nThanks !\n. Merged in, thx\n. Makes sense, fixed in https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/13952f3b3881b8b49f4d3d49836f99e2000cf0dd\n. Added in, but I cleaned up some changes. Thx\n. I like those little perfecting PRs, thx !\n. Cab you change `-S, --simulate` to `-n --dry-run` (more unixish) and update your PR against master? We now use docopt for the CLI.\n. cool, feel free to improve it!\n. That's great, thx !\n. This is cool, thanks.\nAdd yourself to the changelog next time =)\n. No this is great, I initially did the 1st test hoping somebody else will write the rest.\nThx !\n. Thx, I'll add the changelog entry\n. Thx, will add the changelog\n. Thx again, changelog will be added\n. Right, in the future, support for syncing in any folder is planned though. See #39\n. Supported in 0.7.\nSee https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/doc/README.md\n. For the record: PR also proposed in #192\n. Supported in 0.7.\nSee https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/doc/README.md\n. Merging, thx.\nAdd yourself to the WIP section of the Changelog, not to an already released version.\n. Merging, thx, same: changelog should be added in the WIP\n. I'm not sure about this one.\nI use Google Chrome and everything is already in sync by using a Google Account.\nI'm scared that it would conflict with the internal syncing system of GChrome.\n. Yes but enabling it by default would break a lot of configuration, e.g. everyone using a Google Account.\nThere is still no clear way to not enable every app sync by default.\n. And won't Chrome support syncing of extensions in the future ? Looks dumb from Google to not try to solve this problem.\n. Depends on https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/614\n. nice, thanks for digging.\n. That's annoying.\n\nI tried with Vox though and it seems that replacing the `~/Library/Containers/com.coppertino.Vox` folder with a link elsewhere did not cause any problem.\n\nWhat broken behavior did you experienced ?\n. Do you mean linking files directly works ?\n(e.g. instead of linking `Containers/Sip` you link `Containers/Sip/File1` and `Containers/Sip/File2`)\n. Yeah, links are ruled out. The app dev need to ask for permissions when submitting to the app store and tell which file outside of the Container app folder it needs to access, with a good reason.\nHard links or file copy are the only options here.\nBut hard links are not supported by dropbox (it wont detect changes)\nAnd file copy means mackup need to watch over those files for changes from time to time.\n\nMackup could add itself to the user's crontab and diff/sync those files every X min, keeping latest modified all the time (local or dropbox), but there might be problems when multiple computers are on.\n. We don't need 2 \"taps\" to handle apps differently, a simple config option in the app cfg can work.\ne.g.\n\n```\n[application]\nname = Super Duper\nsync_method = copy\n```\n\nFor this app mackup will not link the conf files, but just copy them when it's being run.\n\nThen as you mentioned, the real problem here is that we let users in the dark, not knowing what's in sync.\n\nThat's where the `mackup status` feature in the TODO can help.\nIt could display the list of apps both installed locally or not installed but with a conf in Dropbox.\nFor each of them it would say `in sync` or show when the last sync have been done, or even if it has never been done.\nObviously, for apps with linked config files, it would always display `in sync`, but at least the user could know what config is outdated (from the apps with a copy sync_method) and showing that it has not been synced for 20 days can help the user decide.\n\nMaking mackup optin instead of optout is another question.\n. Cool I guess we have a plan then, thanks for helping clarifying this out.\nIMHO the plan should be:\n1. split out mackup from one big main.py to a bunch of modules (that was the point of 0.6 work)\n2. implement a `status` option\n3. implement a `copy` sync method\n4. add app store apps in\n. `status` being just a display option, it can work and be usuful now, it will just display \"in sync\" for the applications that are currently synced.\nWe don't need 3. or 4. to build 2., but we can't have 3. or 4. without 2. so it's better to build 2. before no?\n. That's true, but I don't see support for copy/sync methods without letting the user know what's happening, given by the status.\nAt worse, if we hit a wall, the display feature will be there and useful anyway.\n. I don't see how mount -o bind can help here, can you get into more details if you have a solution ? Keep in mind that Dropbox need real files in his folder to detect changes and sync them, or it will do nothing.\n\nPutting symlinks in Dropbox does not work as the point is to sync the files content.\n. @yangm97:\n- You can't mound -o bind a folder on a folder, at least on stock OS X, and it would not work for files anyway\n- Putting a link in the middle won't fool the OS.\n- There is no -l option on OS X `cp` and hardlinks are not an option as dropbox is not able to detect changes.\n\nI might have totally missed your point, but I don't get it.\n. Well, unless we have a working solution, there is no progress on this.\nAnyone has a \"working\" plan?\n. Once https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/613 is in, it should not be a problem\n. Thanks!\n. You can now do this using the cfg files.\nSee https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/doc/README.md\nTell me if it's not covering a use case.\n. A vimwiki folder in your home is a little too obvious.\nApparently vimwiki let you specify where you vimwiki folder is.\nWhy not putting it in Dropbox ?\n. Got it, can you update this with the new application config file format? (just merge master in)\n. Thanks for letting me know\nhttps://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/02a1074d0d215aa10564e6c0c6e08f5ad1aecaa2\nFixed on master\n. Will let you know in https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/189\n. No thats fine, GJ\n. Cool, thanks for cleaning this up.\n. Sorry but there are a lot of changes and it's hard to discuss about 8 different applications in a single PR.\nCan you instead create 1 PR per application, follow https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md ?\nThanks\n. 1. Checkout master\n2. Create a branch\n3. Put your commit in this branch\n4. Open a PR\n5. Back to 2 for the next application\n. Cool thx\n. Not sure I understand here, I'm a user of 1Password, and it already syncs well with Dropbox.\nAlso I don't have some of the files you specify, e.g. APP_SUPPORT + '1Password/License'\nCan you elaborate on why we need this in ?\n. If I ever merge this, it will remove support for SABnzbd, Omnigraffle, ...\nClosing this, you need to checkout master, create a branch based off master, commit there, and open a PR.\nI made a clean commit to get the support in: https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/bcac2238e2e03351791d4a52b72bcd98db91621a\n.

It's in anyway, added the plist files.\nWhat's the reason for wanting to add the whole Lightroom ? Is there any folder with an unknown name ?\nWe don't want to sync binary/cache files with mackup, only relevant config.\n. What's the size of this whole folder ? The templates folders aren't too big ?\nThose things look more like resources to me no ? Things that are installed and never changed afterwards.\n.

Perfect thx\n. @TimCorcoran added the support for BetterTouchTool.\n@pzbyszynski added the support for Forklift.\n\nThey might help you more than me.\n\nIn any case, if it is confirmed, we'll need to remove the support for both, some apps don't like symlinks.\n. Cool thanks for reporting.\nI'll close this until you can come up with more info about your problem.\nFeel free to comment again here.\n. Hopefully somebody else will do it =)\nThe homebrew guys don't like when the author update their software themselves there.\nhttps://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/wiki/Acceptable-Formulae#niche-or-self-submitted-stuff\n_\"We frown on authors submitting their own work unless it is very popular.\"_\n. :+1: \n. Yep that's a tough problem.\nOne of the thing I had in mind was to have mackup check any file in the Mackup Dropbox folder, and put it back to it's original place if there is no link for it anymore.\n\nThoughts ?\n. Added to the TODO\nTo answer your question, right now, the best way is to copy back the files manually at their original place =/\n. I don't want to delete the Mackup folder after uninstall for 2 reasons:\n- I want to keep the history of you config in mackup\n- I want people to still have the original files if mackup is uninstalling the files in a weird place, in case something goes wrong (you never know, a link to /dev/null and you loose a private key ?)\n\nDeleting the mackup folder in dropbox seems to be easy enough to balance with the security of keeping the files after uninstallation. But maybe I'm too cautious =)\n. Dupe of https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/605\n. Looks like mackup detected the file `/Users/Jake/Library/Application Support/Quicksilver/PlugIns/com.blacktree.Quicksilver.QSCubeInterfacePlugIn.8EB.qsplugin/Cube Interface.qsplugin` when it wanted to sync the `Quicksilver` folder, but the file was not there anymore when it wanted to move it into Dropbox.\n\nStrange, maybe we don't want to sync the whole folder here.\n\n@orenshk added support for Quicksilver, any insights ? \n. For the record: PR also proposed in https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/149\n. Supported in 0.7.\nSee https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/doc/README.md\n. Thanks for reporting.\nIt is a dupe of #73 \n. This is super lame, and we are not the only ones to be annoyed (http://rixstep.com/2/2/20130225,00.shtml)\n\nThere should be a way to flush the cache of cfprefsd. Anyway, it seems that we should not modify plist files directly anymore, and use \"official\" ways instead:\n- `defaults read|write`\n- python `CoreFoundation`\n\nWe could import/export specific things with those, the problem is that it won't sync anymore after the initial sync. And even if we dump the output in a file, we would have to do it constantly, which is not an option, as it's dropbox who's monitoring file content, and I can't make dropbox call mackup.\n\nSo we are hitting a wall here. Either there is a way to disable this cfprefsd caching behavior, either we use an interface to sync the plists and do it all the time.\n\nThe last solution is to not support those apps and wait and see.\n\nIn the short term, should we remove support for those and blacklist those until we have a plan ?\n. defaults write/read can only happen when you launch mackup to sync/restore, there is no way we can monitor the defaults to sync them in dropbox.\n\nAlso it does not support structured data (like sublists)\n\nIt could be used in the future, but it would mean building a daemon or a cron-like caller.\n. Frankly, until there is a workaround to this issue, I think we should just ditch support for those apps.\nLike you said, when the user is not able to trust an application (mackup) it's the worst, and I want mackup to be as clear as it was in the beginning: syncing config files for apps, If an app cache some conf, too bad for the app.\n\nThoughts?\n. A 1st guess would be every app from the app store.\n. Sadly no =(\n. Centralized in https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/615\n. That's something I considered when I started, given the inability for some app to follow some link, but I rapidly ruled out this solution which looks easier but defeats the real purpose of mackup.\n\nI wanted a tool that does not require me to act each time I change some application setting. You say it's not happening a lot, but I can assure you that it happened a lot (Text editor setting, favorite song, bookmark, ...), this is exactly why I built this at 1st: I was bored of git pushing my changes and bored of having to do a change at home I had done at work that I forgot to push. It happened all the time =)\n\nAlso, without linking, if you forget to update one file, and you update the same file differently on another computer, you got a conflict.\n\nThe only case where it would work is if mackup was checking all its files from time to time. But thats why I used dropbox in the 1st place: It does it well already and I'd rather focus on solving mackup problems.\n\nBut that's something worth considering as the field of conf files gets harder in the future, because of app store containers for example.\n\nI'll keep this in mind, but I think we should not give up this easily yet =)\n. What about the best of both worlds:\n- By default we link\n- For some specific app we sync (and we put somewhere that for those apps you need to sync manually if you want the latest settings)\n\nThis would require a more complex app database format, which I'll need anyway for other subjects (file exclusion, permissions, encryption)\n. Not sure I understand. Why would the \"best of both worlds\" solution would not work for you ?\n. Username are never referenced in any path, why would this be a problem ?\n. > However, isn't backup/restore + uninstall = copy?\n\nYes\n. right\n. Let's do it https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/613\n. Big generated files are definitely not supposed to be synced, only configuration. That's detailled in https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/README.md#what-does-it-do- and if it does otherwise, it's a bug.\n\nCurrently, Mackup is syncing:\n1. APP_SUPPORT + `Dash/DocSets`\n2. APP_SUPPORT + `Dash/library.dash`\n3. PREFERENCES + `com.kapeli.dash.plist`\n\nShould I remove the 1st one ?\n. On the next upgrade, you should kill the `Library/Application Support/Dash/DocSets` link and move back the folder from `Dropbox/Mackup/Library/Application Support` to `Library/Application Support/Dash/DocSets`.\n\nOr more simple, you can `mackup uninstall`, upgrade mackup, and `mackup backup` again.\n\nSorry about that !\n. By next upgrade, I mean when the next version is out, it's not the case yet\n. I trust you that there is nothing big in `'Adobe/CameraRaw'`, I can't check =)\n. Works on windows ?\n. Also what kind of big file ? We can't put Gigs in anyone's dropbox =(\n. Ok if you think it's useful, let's see if someone complains.\n. That's exactly the plan =)\nBut 1st we need to split the one-file-app into multiple, and that changes other things.\n. Done https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#add-support-for-an-application-or-any-file-or-directory\n. No that's a problem we have with some App Store apps.\nNot your fault.\n\nWe need to have a broader solution for this problem, for now I just removed the support for Ember, sorry about that.\n\nAlthough it's a Mac only app and they have iCloud support, so that should be enough to sync.\n. There is sadly no fix in #154, just a discussion.\nBut if it includes an option to backup into dropbox, Mackup does not need to support it anymore =)\n. What's in the `.config/livestreamer` directory other than the config file ?\nDo you want to be explicit and specify what they list in the doc ? \nhttp://livestreamer.tanuki.se/en/latest/cli.html#configuration-file\n. I guess we can then sync:\n- .livestreamerrc\n- .config/livestreamer/config\n- .config/livestreamer/plugins\n. Yeah go ahead, I always like to be explicit in the links listed to be sure we don't put in dropbox thing we oversighted, like cache files.\n. Depends on https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/615\n.

I'm not against the copy feature or ssh default exclusion, but people are jumping on those while they require some other changes before, listed in the TODO.\n\nYou can't just change Mackup to optionally have a copy mode or exclude by default for ssh and not for the others in its current state. It will just make it super complex to use as some behavior will change depending on the mode or the application. It's already too complex too use IMO and it will just scare people away or generate issues with messed up configurations.\n\nAny PR or help is welcome.

Isn't there a better way to automatically detect the Dropbox home in the case of Dropbox Encore ?\n. I understand.\n\nWell it seems like `.dropbox-two` is used most of the time, but I think it's not worth it to add a custom setting just for Dropbox Encore, which looks a little hacky to me, and might be a Dropbox feature soon enough.\n\nTo support your use case, I'm leaning towards a setting to tell mackup where to store the files instead.\n\nLook: https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/custom_storage_location/doc/README.md\n\nYou could use the `filesystem` engine and specify your custom Dropbox folder.\n\nI'll see if I can get this out this weekend, as it's been asked for a while.\n\nThanks\n. Supported in 0.7.\nSee https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/doc/README.md\n. Hi,\n\nThanks for the bug report.\nIt's strange: What you show me is that Mackup can't copy a config file because it does not exist.\nBut to get there, another part of the code already checked that the file (or dir) exists before.\nThe explanation can be that the file disappeared while running Mackup.\n\nThe good thing is that this double check might reveal a problem that we need to handle, without messing with your system.\n\nCan you figure out which application is concerned ? It should be displayed before this traceback.\n. This is strange, gpg is not known to remove files on the fly.\nIf you only whitelist `gnupg` in your `.mackup.cfg` does it still do it ?\n. Can you do a `ls -l /Users/thomas/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg` ?\nAlso, do you still have the problem ?\n. Did you use mackup before 0.7 ?\nThe problem might be that mackup was syncing the whole `~/.gnupg` folder before, and now it only list some specific files in `~/.gnupg`.\n. That might be the problem then.\nWe changed the files to sync for gnupg from .gnupg/ to .gnupg/some_files and its very hard to come up with a migration in this case, as there is no versioning.\n\nIf you want me to get back on your feet, I can help.\n\nThanks for the report !\n. Wow that's a weird error.\nYou have the sqlite3 python package (cf. `/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.6/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/sqlite3/__init__.py`) but you don't seem to have the sqlite3 library.\n\nTry to do a:\n\n``` bash\n$ find /usr/local -name _sqlite3.so\n```\n\nIf nothing shows up, do a\n\n``` bash\n$ find / -name _sqlite3.so\n```\n\nIf nothing shows up, it means your python install is bogus, try reinstalling it maybe ?\n. Apparently that's a problem homebrew had a while ago\nSee https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/22655\nMy guess would be to reinstall homebrew's sqlite and python\n. Depends on https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/615\n. Cool thanks\n. I'll try to split your questions to keep track:\n\n> Can I re-run mackup backup whenever i add a new supported application?\n\nYes, it's an [idempotent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence) operation\n\n> Can we get documentation on specifying the folder to backup to?\n\nhttps://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#custom-directory-name\n\n> How one might migrate the backup folder from dropbox to say, copy or googledrive?\n\nI never tried it, but you should be able to do this following those steps:\n1. Make sure everything is in sync and up to date:\n   1. Upgrade Mackup\n   2. Do a `mackup backup`\n   3. Do a `mackup restore`\n2. Do a `mackup uninstall` to bring back your setting files into your home folder.\n3. Configure Mackup to use Google Drive (see https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#google-drive)\n4. Do a `mackup backup` to move you setting files into Google Drive\n\nIf you have another workstation using mackup, do all the steps, but replace the last step (`mackup backup`) by a `mackup restore`\n\nLet me know if it works, and I'll add this to the doc.\n\nYou can also do a pull request to update the doc if you want ;)\n\nThanks\n. That's cool but don't you think it should be the other way ? (e.g homebrew(-cask) installing mackup)\nOr maybe another meta-tool that would use homebrews and mackup to do it all.\n\nI kind of think mackup should stick to one thing and do it well, specially as it's a complex one already.\n. Cool. That's some serious bash skill there ;)\n. That's a good idea, but it would mean another type of information in the cfg of each application, e.g. a file to check, and if it exists, it'd mean the application is installed.\n\nMakes sense ? If so I'll add it to the todo\n. Thinking about it more, it should not be handled by mackup, mackup is already trying to solve a problem that's complex enough =)\n. Please check https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/doc/README.md#applications it's already supported.\n\nOn a side note, if mackup has synced an application which always change a synced file, it should not. It would help if you could tell us which file is making dropbox constantly syncing.\n\nThanks !\n. If you want to do a PR to make it more obvious, go ahead !\n. Right now the right way to do it is to be explicit about the files to sync in a folder instead of syncing the whole folder.\ne.g. for fish, in your case, you might want to sync:\n\n```\n.config/fish/file_a\n.config/fish/file_b\n```\n\ninstead of\n\n```\n.config/fish\n```\n\nI'm scared of adding a way to ignore files as it would make it more complex to read the config files, but maybe it's just me and it would be useful and more easy than doing it the way I showed up there.\n\nThoughts ?\n. There is a problem though: If you want `dir` to be synced, you can't ask mackup to not sync `dir/file` because of the way we sync things: we link the `dir` directory in your storage and cannot unlink a file in a linked dir. It would only work if we start copying files, which we might do at some point for some apps, it's not meant to be the new default way to sync configs though.\n\nSo in your case, the only option I see would be to change the config of the 2 applications listed from listing 1 dir to listing an explicit list of files to sync.\n\nRight ?\n. No I'm not, a PR is welcomed ;)\n. Merged in, thx.\nYou might want to `mackup uninstall`, upgrade mackup and `mackup backup` again to not have any issue.\nI'm not gonna release a new version in the next few days, but you can use mackup from the master branch, or just update the config files of your install.\nSorry for the trouble !\n. Yeah, that's a problem that need to be solved. No idea how yet.\nThose are good 1st ideas.\n. For the ones who come here, if upgrading mackup breaks your config, because the list of synced files for your app changes, the safest way to upgrade is to:\nOn your main workstation:\n1. mackup uninstall\n2. Upgrade mackup\n3. mackup backup\n\nAnd on your other workstations:\n1. mackup uninstall\n2. Upgrade mackup\n3. mackup restore\n\nA bit of a pain, but until we come up with a solid plan, I don't see a better way =(\n. Shower thinking... (I think a lot in the shower ;)\n\nHere some thoughts to advance on this:\nAn application config right now looks like:\n\n``` ini\n[application]\nname = Arara\n\n[configuration_files]\n.araraconfig.yaml\nararaconfig.yaml\n```\n\nWhat about a new `obsolete_configuration_files` section where we would move the configuration files that were previously synced by mackup, but superseeded in a previous version by the ones listed under `configuration_files` ?\n\nFor example, it would look like:\n\n``` ini\n[application]\nname = Arara\n\n[configuration_files]\n.araraconfig.yaml\nararaconfig.yaml\n\n[obsolete_configuration_files]\n.arara\n```\n\nEach time mackup would check the files of this application to see if it has anything to sync, upon finding one of the `obsolete_configuration_files`, it could just do a `mackup uninstall` only for this app, followed by a new `mackup backup`, only for this file again.\n\nThis works for the main workstation.\n\nIn case of a 2nd workstation, being synced after the 1st one, if an old `obsolete_configuration_files` link exists, it would just kill it, and do a `mackup restore` of this app.\n\nLooks like it can work, but would like other eyes on this algo to make sure I'm not overlooking a possible state where it could fuck up some user's files.\n\n@vitorgalvao you are pretty involved with Mackup. Any thoughts ?\nAlso @noeticpenguin you encountered the problem. Thoughts too ?\n. Wow that's a use case I never thought about.\nMackup is not designed to sync files that are outside of the user's home.\nWhat you are trying to do is not supported and may lead to unpredicted behavior.\nI'll push a way to prevent this from happening, by making sure no path starts with a `/`.\nThanks for pointing this out !\n. Fixed in https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/ac2456fe1b2cd67801c615cfa9baca94a891af9d\n. You can achieve what you want to do by putting apache conf files in your home, or in dropbox directly if you want.\n. It should be a configuration thing, and worst case, you can always link them.\n. Please be careful to limit 1 application support per pull request, thx !\nhttps://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n.

I need to review it and merge it.\n. @Timidger re. blank conf file: yes. An empty conf file should act as a \"I already answered your bloody questions and am fine with the default Mackup behaviour\"\n. Ok cool stuff, I just did a 1st pass.\nFeel free to solve the comments when you have time and I'll do a 2nd pass.\nIf something's not clear, or if you want me to jump in for some stuff, let me know.\n. Also can you solve the conflict in CHANGELOG ? It will make you PR automatically mergeable again\n. Try to merge master into your branch, you'll see\n. Say so when you are done.\nI still see the get_custom_app_config code so I guess it's not.\n. Yeah it's a little confusing, and I can't imagine a lot of people will want to create a new application config on 1st run anyway. It's like if homebrew asked you to create a formula for a non supported application on 1st run.\n\nCan your remove this whole part in this branch ? You can still keep it in another branch and open another PR for later.\n. I will :)\nOn Apr 8, 2014 8:46 PM, \"Preston Carpenter\" notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> Is there going to be another pass through the code or does it all check\n> out?\n> \n> ## \n> \n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/236#issuecomment-39918418\n> .\n. I need a large span of thinking time to be sure this is not going to fail in some way, mackup is touching a lot of personal files and if we screw up, mackup is dead.\nIt's on the queue to be reviewed.\nSorry about my lack of spare time here, but I'm super conservative with it, as it can do very harmful stuff.\n. After giving it more thoughts, I made up my mind of having mackup to syncing anything by default. See https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/614\n\nBut this is still super useful, except that it should be triggered by the user.\n\nCan you make it an explicit action (e.g. `mackup configure`) instead of checking if the config file exist?\n. @sethherr PR welcome ;)\n. 1. do a `mackup uninstall`\n2. specify a `directory` name (see https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#custom-directory-name)\n3. do a `mackup backup` again\n\nFeel free to update the docs if it's not clear\n. I thought it was better to not do anything (not start a sync) when this happens.\nSee https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/doc/.mackup.cfg#L52\n\nIf people think it's better to get an error, we can do it, but I'd like more opinions on this.\n. Also can you add yourself to the changelog ?\n. I think that's fair =)\nI'm super scary of touching user's file and rather stop on the 1st strange thing, but in this case, it's kind of expected.\n\nAdded to the TODO\n. Ouch\n\nI guess you can do this:\n- in `/usr/local/Cellar/mackup/0.7.1/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mackup/utils.py` between line 75 and 76, add `print src`\n- run `mackup uninstall` again, it will display each file it tries to copy\n- each time it crashes like this, you can either create the missing file (or folder) or ask mackup to ignore the application that it tries to copy the settings of (https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#dont-sync-an-application)\n\nI hope it helps, I'll try to push a fix for this soon enough.\n. ok, do this then:\n\n``` bash\n$ sudo rm /usr/local/Cellar/mackup/0.7.1/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mackup/launchbar.cfg\n```\n\nAnd try `uninstall` again\n\nNo worries, the next mackup upgrade will bring back the file\n. I just looked at it, and mackup is already doing what I wanted it to do: Only copy back a file if it exists:\n\n``` python\n            # If the mackup file exists\n            if (os.path.isfile(mackup_filepath)\n                or os.path.isdir(mackup_filepath)):\n\n                # Check if there is a corresponding file in the home folder\n                if os.path.exists(home_filepath):\n                    # If there is, delete it as we are gonna copy the Dropbox\n                    # one there\n                    utils.delete(home_filepath)\n\n                    # Copy the Dropbox file to the home folder\n                    utils.copy(mackup_filepath, home_filepath)\n```\n\nSo there is something bizarre with your files, because it should not try to copy a file if it does not exists 1ms before.\n@aristidesfl can you launch those commands and paste here the output ?\n\n``` bash\n$ ls -l \"/Users/user/Dropbox/Mackup/Library/Application Support/LaunchBar/Configuration.plist\"\n$ stat \"/Users/user/Dropbox/Mackup/Library/Application Support/LaunchBar/Configuration.plist\"\n```\n\nRegarding the fish file left out, it's because the fish application config has been upgraded and is now https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup/applications/fish.cfg\nIt's a separate issue (https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/229) and to fix it you can do:\n\n``` bash\nrm ~/.config/fish\ncp /Users/user/Dropbox/Mackup/.config/fish ~/.config/fish\n```\n. Added more debug in 0.7.2, can you reopen this if it happens again?\n. Cool, can you add yourself to the changelog ? =)\n. Yeah I also forgot to mention to add it into the README.\nI'll do it ;)\n. And I think I'll just merge all the rubymine together\n. FYI https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/6e4721b8ee1d0f404a361525de1936e93a286966\n. Right, let's get https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/236 in 1st.\n. There multiple changes in this PR.\nCan you isolate different PRs for each newly added application?\n\nAs of the enable/disable feature, as you mentioned, it's not possible yet, see https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/608 for the dependancies.\n\nOnce the dependancies are in, we can shape this PR to solve https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/608\n. The 1st problem was a bug in 0.5.4 that tried to sync too many stuff for gnupg. It has been fixed later on and 0.7.1 has the fix.\n\nThe 2nd problem looks like a problem with a file that disappeared while mackup was trying to sync it. It happened for some other people and I'll add more verbose output to figure out what's the problem.\n\nThanks for the detailed reports.\n. @damiankloip you added the support for Atom.\nCan you confirm it's not a problem to sync the whole `.atom` folder?\nIsn't there some config file that are more relevant and safe to sync?\n. No you can. But if you have a better config, please open a PR =)\n. Can you give us a list of path to sync, instead of path to ignore?\n. Any candidate for a PR? =)\n. Merged your PR in master, let's see if it solves the problem.\nIf someone can test, I can then do a release.\n. what should mackup sync?\n. should we remove atom support for mackup then?\n. Fixed in https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/4b961f893f0f0b8c6563d1bceb317b5a15f11b96#diff-71aff7313d191778531bffb35ad2f1ab\n. Thanks.\nCan you also modify the README and the changelog?\nSee https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. Fixed in https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/34b727be360f5c17396d5630ddeef12c55cb43e1\n. Thx.\nAny reference to an official doc mentioning those file?\n. Dupe of https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/602\n. The `direct` in `com.mizage.direct.Divvy.plist` was a mistake?\n. Both might be valid: https://twitter.com/bkirz/status/426452375813885953\n. Yep, and also put your name in the changelog\n. It will get in the next version, thanks\n. Right, you can do this: https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#add-support-for-an-application-or-any-file-or-directory and add the `divvy.cfg` file in your `.mackup` folder until the next update\n. Looks like your homebrew is outdated, `brew update` maybe? Mackup 0.7.2 is in homebrew right now, and there is a PR for 0.7.3: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/pull/29659\n. @commadelimited \"If you override an application config that is already supported by Mackup, your new config for this application will replace the one provided by Mackup.\"\nHope it helps ;)\nAnyway the new version is out now, you should only have to upgrade to 0.7.3\n. Did you test it? Containers have proven to be problematic with other apps (app store apps). They are kept in memory and files are not updated in real time.\n. Can you add your self to the changelog to let the others know about the improvement?\n. I'm ok with merging this.\n@vitorgalvao u cool with that?\n. Dupe of https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/294\n. Thanks, can you follow the guidelines in https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md ?\n. README missing\n. Thx @vitorgalvao \n. What is your OSX python version?\n\n``` bash\n/usr/bin/python --version\n```\n. Which OSX?\n. It's strange.\nCan you run those to be sure your system is fine?\n\n``` bash\n$ brew update\n$ brew upgrade\n$ brew doctor\n$ brew uninstall mackup\n$ brew uninstall mackup\n# Run whatever brew tells you to cleanup all old versions of mackup\n# And finally\n$ brew install mackup\n```\n\nAlso I don't see why when you run `python --version` you get 2.7.X and mackup is getting 2.6.X. Mackup is using `#!/usr/bin/env python`\n\nDoes not make sense\n\nWorst case I can hardcode the `python2.6/site-packages` path, but I'd rather not.\n. Can you try replacing the `/usr/local/Cellar/mackup/bin/mackup` file with this content:\n\n``` python\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport sys\nimport os.path\n\ntry:\n    import mackup.main\nexcept ImportError:\n    # If Mackup is not installed globally, we are looking for the mackup module\n    # at the same path level as the bin folder where this script is in.\n    # In this case, let's dynamically add the parent path to the python path\n    bin_dir_path = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))\n    parent_dir_path = os.path.dirname(bin_dir_path)\n    sys.path.append(parent_dir_path)\n    try:\n        import mackup.main\n    except ImportError:\n        # We are being run on a half-backed system (*cough* brew bot *cough*)\n        # Let's hack our way in\n        hacky_packages_path = os.path.join(parent_dir_path,\n                                           'lib/python2.7/site-packages')\n        # On some systems mackup is running 2.6 python\n        # See https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/263\n        if not os.path.isdir(hacky_packages_path):\n            hacky_packages_path = os.path.join(parent_dir_path,\n                                               'lib/python2.6/site-packages')\n        sys.path.append(hacky_packages_path)\n        import mackup.main\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    mackup.main.main()\n```\n\nMake sure it's executable, and run it:\n\n``` bash\n$ chmod +x mackup\n$ mackup list\n```\n. no worries it will get replaced on the next upgrade\n. I revamped the package structure, should be good now\n. Thx @vitorgalvao \nLet us know if there is a way to make this more easy to find\n. That's cool.\nCan you add the app to the readme too? see https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. sorry, will take a look\n. Exactly:\n1. Upgrade `mackup`\n2. Run `mackup backup` on the computer that has a good config for the new supported app\n3. Run `mackup restore` on all other computers\n   All those commands are [idempotent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence) and can be run indefinitely, in case you are not sure.\n\nFeel free to do a PR to update the doc =)\n. Great! Can you add `tig` to the README too?\n. Please review https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. Glad it helps ;)\nYou (or anyone else) can follow those instructions: https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#get-official-support-for-an-application\n. Perfect, thx\n. We switched to docopt since your PR, mind rebasing?\n. thanks!\n. Cool, thx.\nIn the future, I don't mind 1 PR per app, really ;)\n. Thx @vitorgalvao \n@vircheck if you have an idea about how to make it easier to find this info, please tell us.\n. Fixed by https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/493\n. Thx @vitorgalvao =)\n. Do you know which files?\n. I'm not using it. If you guys think we should get rid of it, I'm OK.\nIsn't the iCloud stuff gonna sync things anyway?\n. thx!\n. I agree thx\n. Can you kill the old PCKeyboardHack application support, and merge the old synced files into this one?\nAlso can you add update the README and the changelog?\nhttps://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. Are the 2 still available? The 2 names are still valid? Any urls?\n. Yep, let's put PCKeyboardHack's files into Seil's conf.\nThanks!\n. I guess you can point mackup to another storage, do a `backup` to create all the links, change mackup to use your legit engine, and do a mackup restore to overwrite all the links mackup created.\n. The homebrew guys don't want stuff that is already available in pip.\nAs I did not want to be stuck to python, or to target devs only (pip is really only used by devs) I chose homebrew instead of pip.\n. Good idea, PR welcomed.\n. You can use this ssh config to overwrite mackup's without a problem, like @vitorgalvao suggested.\n. Merged, so this is now the default =)\nPeople who wants to sync their passphrased keys should create a `~/.mackup/ssh.cfg` file with this content:\n\n``` ini\n[application]\nname = SSH\n\n[configuration_files]\n.ssh\n```\n. (will release tonight)\n. Can you add it to the README too? See https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. Thanks, merged in https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/66067eea48c42a0be8a8fac780a55234552c4ef9\n. Should be fixed since Jan.\n. Same in all, spaces\n. Can u add a changelog entry?\nAlso don't you think it'd make more sense to augment the actual `tower.cfg` file?\n. ok\n. Fixed in https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/be67f6f582ce44d907d98f505f4aeffc9879e5c5\n. not sure, it was just failing I guess\n. Thanks that's great https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/b2e75a593b83ceaf3a7b8dd104142ac7c8ec6a28\n. Can't find the origin repo, is this PR still valid? Or you found a problem?\n. Merged in #452\n. You mean it crashes because you've removed Skype?\n. I don't think we can hardcode such things in mackup, any other app could have a legitimate .socket file\n. Ignoring sockets seems legit, yes.\nAnyone up for a PR?\nI'll do one when I'll have time if not.\n. Wait no we can't. If mackup links a folder that contains a socket file, it cannot excluded as the whole folder is linked.\n\nI guess for this, we need a better Skype configuration. https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup/applications/skype.cfg is too broad\n. Any Skype user can come up with a better config to sync?\n. Can you follow https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md ?\n\nThanks\n. Can you add yourself to the other files?\nhttps://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. Cool thx all\n. https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#get-official-support-for-an-application\n. Thanks guys for the detailed report, and sorry about the delay on the fix.\nHopefully this will fix it: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/pull/32833\n. Fixed by https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/pull/32967 thanks @lamielle \n\n@yonkeltron @Papegoja please open specific tickets, it's very hard to follow multiple bugs in the same issue.\n. yep, homebrew is a little behind sometimes.\n. Well I don't think anyone want to sync this huge amount of data over dropbox.\nCan you only list actual config files?\n. You can always ask upstream if you can't figure it out\n. Cool can u just resolve the merge conflicts?\n. Well, you can just add commits to this one, no need to start from scratch =)\n. You can still undelete your files in Dropbox.\nFeel free to open a PR to make it more explicit in the doc or wherever else.\nKeep in mind that everybody has different uses and too much warning won't be read.\n. Will be fixed by https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/614\n. Dupe of https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/109\n. Still having the issue?\n. What about saving the whole `Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3` then?\n. But that goes against what's being said at https://packagecontrol.io/docs/syncing\n. @szhousun @jbcdnr is it still a valid issue?\n. Ok feel free to reopen if it's still valid.\n. Still an issue?\n. Aren't those folders full of binary files?\n. Would be best to only sync actual config, no?\n. That's awesome, looks good\n. I agree, dupe of https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/613\n. @ChristopherA Should not be a problem, Mackup's config files are synced like the rest: https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup/applications/mackup.cfg\n. Can you maybe point to the doc for more info?\nhttps://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc\nOr it's more confusing than anything?\n. Thx @jannae \n. You are right.\n. @ChristopherA should have been fixed a while ago (January) by https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/691ca2009ae0c2be91553b948b52485172c49f8c\n\nPlease comment back if it's not the case.\n. Not sure I understand, a `.gitignore` in `$HOME` is useless no?\n. @jannae I totally agree, mackup should only track standard files, or it will be very hard to maintain everyone's custom things.\n\nCan we change this PR to match this and update the doc too?\n. It's already the case.\nIf you copy https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/doc/.mackup/ssh.cfg in you `.mackup` and only specify what you want, it will override Mackups' behavior.\n\nWe might want to make it more explicit in the docs\n. Yep, not saying this should be the way to go though.\nI like syncing my keys (they are password protected) but looks like some people don't.\nI guess it's up to the users to choose really.\n. @RickWong Any config synced with mackup is private, that's the essence of it and I made it to sync my ssh keys in the 1st place. The problem is that it's now used by other people =)\n. Dupe of https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/295\n. https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#get-official-support-for-an-application\n. Dupe of https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/613\n. Apparently your system has permissions that prevent mackup to move your `/Users/harrison/.subversion` folder around.\n. Can you add yourself to some files? =)\n. Can you also update the README? (remove the 12?)\n. thx!\n. Can you (or someone) open a PR?\nThanks\n. ps: The website is down for me, is this application still a thing?\n. If it's used by more people, we might integrate it as another sync engine.\n. Should we exclude `Library/Application Support/Viscosity` from https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup/applications/viscosity.cfg ?\n. The actual engine does not support exclusion, so we'll have to explicitly list everything we want to sync.\nAnyone can provide an updated https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup/applications/viscosity.cfg ?\n. We can't exclude `.Sparkle` in a linked folder, if you link a directory, you link it with all its content.\r\nTo do such a thing, we would need to:\r\n1. Implement a copy engine (vs link)\r\n2. Implement file exclusion in the config\r\n\r\nI feel like this sparkle stuff should live outside of the config.... cool, let's wait for this to happen given the amount of work it would require on Mackup.. Fixed in https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/906bd9fbd59a0554bb3db8acf0f4d0199bfa5a97 (could not merge your PR automatically as the original repo does not exist)\n. The problem with this approach is that we don't want to piss application authors: Sometime they make their user pay for the sync option ;)\nAm I being too cautious here?\n. Yep what @ponychicken says makes sense IMO, but what about apps that provides a syncing system? I also don't want mackup to break anything.\n\nWe need a simple rule that people can understand, and not including apps providing syncing was one.\n\nNot sure what to do here...\n. Can you add yourself to the changelog?\n. You also need to add it to the README, will do.\n. The default changed in https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/b2847f5750304cfd388ced4cf33bb14a3767c239\n. If you want us to add a warning text, feel free to do a PR about it or let us know what would have helped.\n\nAt some point, I feel like adding too much text is counter productive and people won't read it.\n. The point of using sets is to make sure there is no dupe conf file. I'd call this a regression.\nI'm not sure I understand why keeping an order is important?\n. I see, but I'd rather fix the underlying problem. We should not rely on order for a list of files that should be unique in the first place. The fix should be that in `get_config_files()`, for each application, we should nott add the stock application config if there is a custom.\n\nI will work on a fix.\n. @jannae we can try the default ones, and see how the community will improve this\n. It will have to wait for the copy mode then =/ https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/613\n. Can you follow https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md ?\nThanks\n.

Maybe the root of the problem is that by default, Mackup detects and links anything it finds.\nLetting the user explicitly enable apps to sync would solve this issue (and the ssh keys one that people blame mackup for)\nBut the caveat would be that you loose the 1-command-to-sync-everything it has.\nI would not mind including alfred and chrome if it was not enabled by default.\n.

You can use the sync feature inside 1password.\n. This is a problem still to be solved https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/229\nUntil then to not block fixes like this one, I just ask everyone to think as it was a new install.\nCan you add a line to the changelog?\n. thank you!\n.

It would be possible, but rather confusing.\nTo keep it simple, what about having different configurations for each app?\nFor now as mackup is enabling everything by default, it would have to be a user config, until mackup allow to selectively enable/disable apps.\n. I agree, or once mackup does not sync everything by default, we could have apps like `osx-shortcuts`, `osx-doc`, ...\nAnyway, not possible until at least https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/614\n. thx\n. thanks\n. Should we remove `Library/Application Support/TextMate` from https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup/applications/textmate.cfg to not sync it?\n. Can you modify the readme and the changelog? https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. Can you clarify what you mean by \"which I have my own custom versions\"? If you ignore them why do you customize them?\n\nAlso are you running 0.8.2? A bunch of config related bugs have been fixed lately\n. You should, most of the config mess stuff has been fixed since.\n. cool\n. Cool thx\n. Can you point to an official doc mentioning those files? If it's just for you, it should be a user conf.\nAlso can you follow https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\nThanks =)\n. The thing is that it's the start to have `.*` synced, and we need a clear and explicit frontier ;)\nAs of now, it as been: if it's not official, it should not be committed. If you have something better in mind, do a proposal ;)\n. cool thx\n. closing until there is a proven way to sync Safari's extensions.\n.

Mackup does not seem to be able to move `.shsh/.cache/lib-osx.jar`\nFrankly, I think the app config is bad, as Mackup should not try to sync cache files, and `.shsh/.cache` is an obvious name.\n\n@stechico you added support for this https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup/applications/shsh-blobs.cfg, any idea?\n. No: https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/602\n. not possible, what do you link then? `*`?\n. No because the setup is only done on `mackup backup`, and not done anymore later. And some application might add new files later on that would never be synced.\n. Dupe of https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/602\n. Then you the colorsync config need to be more precise about which files to sync.\n. Which file are you talking about?\nI see only 1 file synced in the flux config https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup/applications/flux.cfg\n. Oh so you are saying we should remove https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup/applications/colorsync.cfg ?\n@devnulled you added it, can you confirm it's problematic?\n. Which path covers `the automatically created flux files`?\n. Sounds like we should remove ColorSync support until https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/602\n. It's fine keeping all them in one config. Did you try the config?\n. Please can you follow https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md ? It makes it easier to discuss/review/merge.\nThanks\n. At some point, I'd like Mackup to be _transactional_. Instead of changing files directly, it would make a copy of the files in some isolated area (the temp folder), try doing the work there, and if all is ok, apply the same on the real files. If any failure in the middle of the work, it would just erase the temp folder, and the original files would not be touched.\n\nI also wanted to know if creating/deleting this temp folder would generate problems on some user's weird config, apparently nobody complains, and keeping this code make sure we can do the transactional feature without worrying about the \"where do we put the files?\" part.\n\nOnly the temp folder creation/deletion has been implemented yet ;)\n. IMO it's a bad idea to sync preferences that depend on what is installed.\nE.g. If I have an application icon in the dock on 1 computer, and sync the dock preferences on another computer where this application is not installed, what will happen?\n\nNot a fan of those in general, but maybe I'm missing something?\n. Ok, it might be a legit thing to sync yeah. I'd welcome another opinion on this =)\n. As it's only gonna work in certain use case, let's wait for https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/614 1st before adding this.\n. Any official mention of this file?\n. It's not an official git file, and must be explicitly stated in the git config no?\n. So mackup should look at the `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` env var and try to look for the `.mackup.cfg` and all the custom application files? All in addition to the usual `$HOME` place?\n\nMakes sense?\n. Ok then:\n1. try `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mackup/` and `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mackup.cfg` if they exist.\n2. if not, try `$HOME/.mackup/` and `$HOME/.mackup.cfg`\n3. if not, no config.\n\nMake sense?\n. Can't we have 2 things: the mackup config `.mackup.cfg` and the custom application database, `mackup/*`. But in the custom application database, there can be one for mackup, so in your suggestion, `mackup/mackup.cfg` would lead to bothe the mackup config, and the application database entry for mackup.\n\nUnless we move everything one level deeper, e.g.`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mackup/mackup/*` =(\n\nCan you link to any reference to this \"customary\" behavior?\n. No, `$HOME/.mackup/mackup.cfg` and `$HOME/.mackup.cfg` are 2 different things.\nThe former is a custom app database entry for mackup, the later is the mackup config.\n. ok let's do it then, PR welcome ;)\n. Thx, closing this then =)\n. can you add a line in the changelog?\n. Also did https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/9ca6e273bbd30c5569e3a672f8413333ac8b6bc1\n. What kind of graceful error management would you expect to see?\n. should be fixed by https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/759\n. Tests are failing ;)\n. Awesome! thanks, merged =)\nWill bump a new version today.\n. https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md =)\n. Are there official mentions of those paths in the zsh doc?\n. Cool thanks.\n. thx!\n. Me too ;)\n. Since your PR, we switched to docopt to handle the CLI. Mind updating your PR?\n. Cool, but for docopt to accept the --force option, it needs to be added here https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup/main.py#L14\n\nCan you update your PR?\n. It recently changed? Do we need to support both and we can expect all gdrive to be up to date?\nFeel free to open a PR anyone\n. Sorry I don't have the time to do a PR, feel free to provide one.\n. Fixed in https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/575\n. Again, mackup can't support all the files for all the behavior in the world =)\nWhere are those files officially mentioned by the git doc or source code?\nIf not this is more a `.mackup.cfg` thing, unless a lot of people think this is a defacto standard.\n. > I think this can be easily rectified by more prominently highlighting the \"roll your own\" feature in the main Readme.\n\nFeel free to PR =)\n. Dupe of https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/613\n. Of course, you can tell Mackup to only sync the applications you want: https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#applications\n. > It would be really nice if there was some kind of warning on the command line or in the README about this.\n\nWe can't have a warning for every file mackup wants to move, this would drive people insane, as they are already tired of the existing messages. See https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/493\n\nRegarding replacing symlinks mackup does not own during uninstall, the problem is that right now mackup works accross all the apps by default. This behavior is gonna change in https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/614\n. The problem of out of date syncing is still relevant though, we would have to copy the files instead of linking, and the users would have to regularly run a sync command.\n\nThis is another discussion IMO =)\n. Depends on https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/610 anyway\n. As it's a new app, can you add it to the rest? https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. Same, https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. bis https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. I guess we could.\n\nWe would need a way to specify a command line instead of a string to know which file to sync.\nCould be another section in the INI of each application.\n\ne.g.\n\nInstead of:\n\n``` ini\n[application]\nname = Git\n\n[configuration_files]\n.gitconfig\n.config/git/ignore\n```\n\nWe would have:\n\n``` ini\n[application]\nname = Git\n\n[configuration_files]\n.gitconfig\n.config/git/ignore\n\n[cli_defined_config_files]\ngit config core.excludesfile\n```\n\nMackup would be super careful as those commands could output non sense, nothin, command not found or even a different file for each workstation, which could lead to 2 different synced files.\n\nAlso, besides git, is there another example about this? Not sure it's worth it if it's just for git.\n\nAny other thoughts on this?\n. > A lot of applications support naming/placing the files something/somewhere different\n\nAny other example besides git?\n. You are right, I'll try to keep the discussion centralized.\nRegarding the matter, I'm sold to the idea that it should not sync it by default, we just need to name the enabling/disabling of apps simple enough so the empty default application list can be easily modified.\n\nLet's follow up at https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/109\n. > Mackup should actually not move any files without confirming with the user first.\n\nThat's an opinion, check the issues and some people want the opposite: to not have to be bothered.\n. once per computer + on every new app installed.\n. @enricodeleo here's mine ;)\n\n``` bash\n$ cat .mackup/ssh.cfg \n[application]\nname = SSH\n\n[configuration_files]\n.ssh\n\n```\n. I don't see any place where it's stated that `~/.git-completion.bash` is the official place for this file, looks like it's pretty user specific.\n. Do you mind adding a line to the changelog? =)\nhttps://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. try to keep it to 1 pr per app so a good app is not blocked by a bad one\nhttps://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. Cool thx\n. Awesome =)\n. https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md please =)\n. thanks =)\n. @TimCorcoran added support for it.\nAre you using it from the app store maybe?\n. no worries ;)\n. So what do you suggest?\nAlso please keep it to 1PR per application, it's hard to keep track of things otherwise\n. no worries ;)\n. Should we remove support for LR?\n. https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/7dee92d20cd9fff6538fcd11543f2bd488684409\n. Might be a mistake on our side. Can you give us more info? (distribution, pip version, ...)\n. Sorry but I can't reproduce this.

Dupe of https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/612\n. mmmh, not sure, you should use the canonical name (the file name in `mackup list`)\nMight be a legit bug, if anyone want to look into it and fix it.\n. `mackup list` is built to display all applications supported by mackup.\nI think what you are looking for is a list of applications that mackup plans to scan based on your config.\nThis is not implemented yet, TODO: https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/603\n.

It's not an official file https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/472\n. If everyone comes with his own file to sync in the config, we'll end up with zillion files that make sense for no one.\nThe fine line is, if it's not official, it needs to go in the user config: https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#add-support-for-an-application-or-any-file-or-directory\n. It is not suppoed to delete this folder as people would yell at Mackup for loosing if it would.\nIf the community as a strong opinion about this, we can change it.\n. You are right, I updated it, I planned to do this at the beginning, but if you remove the Mackup folder on one computer, all the other synced computers will miss the files.\n\nSo I don't think it's easily feasible, any idea?\n.

Thanks, we really need https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/609 to make sure it does not break =/\n. In your case it would work, but what about people that don't define `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` ?\n. I certainly prefer this version:\n\n```\n[application]\nname = Git\n\n[configuration_files]\n$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config\n$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/credentials\n$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore\n.gitignore\n.gitcredentials\n.gitconfig\n```\n\nThe version with the `||` is just overkill and a pain to parse and handle.\n\nI guess we could evaluate this `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` but it breaks one of the rule of mackup: only relative path (to prevent stupid PRs trying to link things outside of home)\n\nMaybe we could require that `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is a subfolder of home, but what if some dumb user set `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` to /usr/share/I/dont/understand/unix. It's dumb but will surely happen.\n. That's interesting. Going one step further, what about:\n\n``` ini\n[application]\nname = Git\n\n[home_config_paths]\n.gitignore\n.gitcredentials\n.gitconfig\n\n[xdg_config_paths]\ngit/config\ngit/credentials\ngit/ignore\n```\n\n`home_config_paths` would prefix `$HOME` and `xdg_config_paths` would prefix `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`\n. you are right, let's go one step further to keep it backward compatible:\n\n``` ini\n[application]\nname = Git\n\n[configuration_files]\n.gitignore\n.gitcredentials\n.gitconfig\n\n[xdg_configuration_files]\ngit/config\ngit/credentials\ngit/ignore\n```\n\ncool?\n. Cool, PR welcome.\n. Yep sorry about that, you'll have to do a PR there to submit 0.8.9 or stick to 0.8.6.\nhttps://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/mackup.rb\nYou can also use pip to always get the latest version.\n. I guess it's due to a change in the ssh config: https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/dcb26baf56f13330c069eadad35ac8feca7ac215#diff-3727ac8ad7f5a3d72f5ca92808b32f27\nCan you try deleting the .ssh folder in dropbox and try again? (you can undelete in dropbox in case something goes wrong)\n. cool, glad you solved it. Migration between different configs are a pain we need to solve: https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/229\n. Strange that you don't get any error, it must be failing on one of the apps.\nI just released 0.8.10 on pip with verbose and dry run.\n\nCan you try the verbose mode using 0.8.10?\n. Do you have a suggestion for a better error message?\n. https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/189335f8420346eab4323ae829eab38577e672c9\n. tests are failing\n. Thanks for the PR, feel free to update the doc to explain this new feature and the way to enable this.\n. https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n\nAlso, what's in this folder? Can you `ls -l` it?\n. This is a lot of directories. What each directory contains?\nWe want to be sure to sync config and not data.\n. ok thanks\n. > What do you think of referencing environment variables\n\nToo fragile IMO, it will generate a lot of mistakes and thus support.\n\nYou can already ignore mackup, no?\n. can u resolve the conflicts?\n. I'll give it another review pass once those comments are dealt with, thanks!\n. no idea, I need to spend time reviewing it.\n. Syncing is builtin no?\n. Update on? It's been merged in Sep 2015.\n. Sure, why not.\nIt does not need tot be part of #603 \n. Can you fix the markdown? See `ci/circleci` status\n. It depends on where Apple Mail stores its config, if it's legit files, it could be don, I'm not aware of it.\n. Sadly I don't see any easy way to anticipate this.\n. Sorry I don't understand the full scenario. We already check for links https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup/application.py#L154\n. I think you'd get a message with the current version asking you to delete the link if you want: https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup/application.py#L99\n\nWere you using 0.8.11?\n. 0.8.5 did not have this in place.\n. thanks, you can run `make develop` to work locally on mackup, it will install locally on your system what's in this folder. `make undevelop` to uninstall the dev version.\n\nFeel free to improve the docs =)\n. it's not official https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/498\n. https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. thx =)\nI wonder if we should merge all the versions at some point\n. Can you add it to the README in the list of applications?\nhttps://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md ;)\n. Please see https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. Just sync the folder that contains those files.\nSee https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#add-support-for-an-application-or-any-file-or-directory\n. can you add Rhythmbox to the README and to the changelog?\nIt's usually easier to keep it 1 app per PR\n. all good =)\n. Well first we can't sync `/Library/Services`, it's not per user.\nRegarding `~/Library/Services` I think I tried linking it and it screwed things up.\nUnless Apple changed things, we can't.\n. you can use `ls`:\n\n``` bash\nls -l \"Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User\"\n```\n. See https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup/applications/sublime-text-3.cfg\n. Feel free to contribute! https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#get-official-support-for-an-application\n. If we say that mackup officially supports 1password: 2 things that are not straightforward and might confuse people:\n1. On my App Store 1password, the backups are in the containers of 1password, which is a dynamic path, e.g. `/Users/analogue/Library/Containers/2BUA8C4S2C.com.agilebits.onepassword-osx-helper/Data/Library/Backups`\n1. 1password already supports dropbox and all, there might be a reason why that don't put the backups in the synced filesystem (e.g. dropbox)\n\nFor those reasons, I think it might be more relevant as a user config, see https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#add-support-for-an-application-or-any-file-or-directory but if more people think it's a good idea, why not.\n. suggestion 3: don't ever use root as a user.\n. not really, will try to get a new version out soon.\n. done!\n. Did you try it? It should not work.\nApp Store apps are not supported yet.\nSee https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/615\n. Not sure people will appreciate having their bitcoin wallet on dropbox.\nIs it intended? (e.g. encrypted)\n. Thanks for all those additions!\n. just call it `ssh.cfg`, overwrite the default one.\nA mackup restore should be enough.\n. Can you tell me more about your use case?\nWhat do you want to achieve, and what commands are you launching?\n. Can u add an entry in the changelog?\n. changelog entry would help\n. Thanks, but please keep it one PR per app next time.\n. Covered by https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/684\n. I'm scared that the synced folder is gonna have a lot of cache/binary stuff. Can you dig in?\n. Try it locally and let us know.\n. Please https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. you can update a PR\n. Can anyone confirm that this indeed works? Usually Apple stuff does not like symlinks and overwrite them.\n. @ryanjbonnell @reitermarkus you said it works. @matti should I revert this?\n. The thing is that I don't want to make a release with a conf that does not especially, especially how cumbersome it's for a user to upgrade a mackup that remove support for an app =/\n. @reitermarkus @leesiongchan can you try what @matti did?\n. Sorry, merge conflicts, I just had a bug to fix.\n. I guess you'll have to mock.\nAlso I suggest doing 1 PR for python 3.2, and one for Windows\n. Can you point to some official doc or source code stating that the old path are not supported anymore?\n. You need to improve https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup/applications/skype.cfg\n. can someone come up with a PR? I don't use Skype.\n. > Is there a way to blacklist a certain dir?\n\nNo\n. Can you merge yours and all the other intellijidea into one `intellijidea.cfg`?\n. Please https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. I put as many warnings I felt were enough (e.g asking the user to confirm each action).\nIf you think the user should be more noticed, fee free to propose a PR.\n. I totally agree, and have to trust people who submit config as I can't try every application support out there.\nIf you have a better config for some app (better config = list of explicit files to sync instead of a whole folder) please submit a PR, it will be more than welcome.\n\nThere is nothing like wildcard, it's just files and folders. TODO is here: https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/602\n\nThanks!\n. Nice! Thanks!\n. Well, I'm guessing here because your description is not explicit enough, but sounds like you deleted the folder where Mackup links all config files manually, which means that you deleted all the settings files of your app.\n\nNot sure what you expect from this issue.\n. if you deleted the folder where mackup put the linked files, u deleted it, not mackup.\nYou can undelete files in dropbox, so you should be able to recover.\n. PR welcome\n. Yes, after you link `Dropbox (Personal)` to `Dropbox`, you can run `mackup uninstall` to unlink everything which will move back all the files into your home, then `mackup backup` to link back the files into dropbox using the legit name.\n\nYou can then delete the old `Dropbox (Personal)` link.\n. Can you fix the markdown? Tests are failing\n. Fixed in https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/c76ba98bc02fb0acb4acf6d50c17b1f5f5f03040\n. Dupe of https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/602\n. thx @vitorgalvao \n. Can you open a PR?\n. nice =)\n. The tests are failing, can you check CircleCI?\n. exactly ;)\n. thanks for this ;)\n. Thanks!\n. It's not possible, sorry.\r\nIt's technically doable but there are other priorities.. Sure, you can check this doc on how to do it: https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#add-support-for-an-application-or-any-file-or-directory\nThen make a pull request https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#get-official-support-for-an-application\n. I see, thanks\n. Can you merge all the PyCharm cfg files into one `pycharm.cfg`?\n. See https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/777 for an example\n. Until this is an official file, this should go in you user config, see https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/498\n. Please, test the PR you are submitting.\n. That would mean that this should not be touched by Mackup until this is fixed.\nCan someone open a PR?\n. should be fixed by https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/759\n. thanks!\n. Confirmed to now work, see https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/31\nIf this has changed, feel free to comment back.\n. OSX stuff usually does not like being linked. Can anyone else confirm this is working?\n. Do you mind merging this into `textmate.cfg`?\n. thx!\n. This is great thanks.\nNot sure if the folders you still sync are worth syncing, since I gave up on syncing Skype myself ;)\nI'll let you decide as you use it.\n. I'd rather have someone take the decision, as I don't use it.\nIf anyone else want to jump in and make the call (PR), please do ;)\n. Please follow https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. That's a good idea, but what about binary files?\n. Yep, Skype support has been removed like stated by @TCattd .\nI'll do a release in the next days, but I'd keep it ignored in the meantime.\n. Do you mind merging all the `phpstorm-*.cfg` into one `phpstorm.cfg` file, including yours?\n. Please, can you follow https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md ?\n. Syncing outside of the user home is not supported for zillions of reasons, sorry.\nI suggest contacting the developer of the application you use to let him know to not install user configuration outside of the home folder.\n. > Do you prefer to have two separate configurations (ultimate and community edition) or just merge everything into a single one ?\n\nI think that would be great, care to do it?\n. Thanks for this, looks like 0.3.1 includes your upstream fix too\n. Dupe of https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/782\n. `mackup uninstall` Copy back any synced config file to its original place.\nMaybe you uninstalled a new version, check the files that are still being synced and replace the links with the files in dropbox.\n. > mackup is still backing up to an old folder.\n\nWhich folder? Remove the link and copy back the files from dropbox there.\n. > Which link? The folder where Skype always seems to sync, like every 5 minutes sometimes, is \"/Dropbox/mackup/library/application support/skype\". But when I delete this folder and move everything to its original folder in \"/Library/Application Support/skype\" it doesn't take long and the folder in \"mackup\" is being created again.\n\nIf you say files are recreated in `/Dropbox/mackup/library/application support/skype`, then you must have a link at `~/library/application support/skype`.\n\nDelete the link, move your files back there, should work.\n. thx\n. Skype support removed in 0.8.14\n. huh, sorry but this will lead to a lot of confusion.\n`.ssh` is supposed to be owned by `ssh`, and this looks like a script hacking around its config files.\nThe problem is that if someone syncs `.ssh` it will mess things up.\nThis folder `.ssh/config.d` and everything in it should really be owned by `ssh`.\n. not sure how to solve this.\nMove `.ssh/config.d` in `ssh`?\n. Their website has no info and display this:\n\n![screen shot 2016-04-25 at 10 50 04 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/122286/14787902/8007e004-0ad3-11e6-9d54-870ac5f2be9a.png)\n\nNeed a better homepage\n. Skype support has been removed in 0.8.14. Sorry about that.\n. You need to remove the link.\nMackup just does create links, it does not syncs.\nDelete the links that point to Dropbox and it won't save those in dropbox anymore.\n\nIf you really don't know how to, last resort is to install the version of mackup you used when syncing skype, and run mackup uninstall, it will put everything back into place.\n\nBut it's easier to just delete the link.\n. Spot on, please open a PR.\n. Thanks!\n. thanks. Wow, that's really stupid...\n\nOK, I guess the box engine needs to rename those files to something line `.bashrc -> box_dot_bashrc_`.\nThat could work for individual files, but if a linked folder contains dotfiles, mackup cannot help here.\n\nNot sure if there are a lot of dotfiles in folders, but it's a possible source of bugs and confusion.\n\nAlso what about dot folders? Same behavior? Sounds like there is no easy fix on mackup side. Is there a way to ask box if they could make this an option? (ignoring dot files)\n. The problem is that it's a valid issue... Should we just drop Box's support?\n. Please follow https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. done, thanks. Mind making a PR? If not let me know and I'll do it.\n. that's great, didn't know this, I think pip behavior changed.\nBut I can't get this to work on my mac?\n\n```\n[analogue:~] 3s $ pip install --system mackup\n\nUsage:   \n  pip install [options] <requirement specifier> [package-index-options] ...\n  pip install [options] -r <requirements file> [package-index-options] ...\n  pip install [options] [-e] <vcs project url> ...\n  pip install [options] [-e] <local project path> ...\n  pip install [options] <archive url/path> ...\n\nno such option: --system\n```\n. > Perhaps there should be separate install instructions for debian/ubuntu?\r\n\r\nSure, can you change your PR?. I think it's fine, up to the app developer to make it more secure, but can you please it add it to the README?

See circleci below.\n. merged, thanks!\n. Thanks, can you follow https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md ?\n. thanks!\n. Not sure I understand the issue, Mackup is supposed to detect the Dropbox path automatically. If there is a bug let's fix it, but requiring the user to manually set a path is not a scalable solution IMO, as it would have to be done on every workstation.\n. https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup/utils.py#L112\nWe do chmod all the synced files because they are supposed to be configuration files, and some files have keys and credentials.\nAs we copy the files to 3rd party software (e.g. dropbox) and some of them apply stupid permissions to those files, we had to go the conservative route (0600 on files and 0700 on folders).\n\nThis is not fixable as it depends on the behavior of those cloud storage services, and they are not consistent.\n\nSorry, but the only way here is to not sync executable files, just config files. I suggest removing those files from the list of files to sync.\n. Would you mind merging this and the other webstorm ini into 1?\nLike https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup/applications/intellijidea.cfg\n. the `.vim` or `.ssh` folders are not synced, specific files and folders are. See https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup/applications/vim.cfg and https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup/applications/ssh.cfg\n. Can you instead merge the conf with the existing fantastical?\n. Totally\n. Can you fix the markdown error?\n.

Hi,\r\n\r\nGlad you love the tool, please help improving it ;)\r\n\r\n> How does one copy prefs from outside the user folder ?\r\n\r\nIt is not supported, Mackup is all about user config, and there is no easy way to solve conflicts if it's start messing with other files on the system.

I can't see any official documentation about a `~/.gitignore` file.\r\n\r\n> Patterns which a user wants Git to ignore in all situations (e.g., backup or temporary files generated by the user\u2019s editor of choice) generally go into a file specified by core.excludesFile in the user\u2019s ~/.gitconfig. Its default value is $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore. If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is either not set or empty, $HOME/.config/git/ignore is used instead.\r\n\r\nhttps://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore. All good. yes, it's a shortcut I had to take, there is room for improvements. you need to uninstall it on every workstation you used it on.\r\n\r\nNot sure why it would not put back your xcode config, there is a hole in your scenario.\r\n\r\nAnyway, you can manually copy back all the files from the Mackup folder in Dropbox and put them back in your home folder, replacing your links: https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup/applications/xcode.cfg. based on https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup/applications/xcode.cfg, mackup never  touched `xcode.cfg`.. yeah it's been merged but not released yet -_-\r\nexpect a release soon. done: https://github.com/lra/mackup/releases/tag/0.8.16. This sounds like user config, I can't find an official reference of `.zshrc.local` in the zsh doc.\r\nYou might want to add it to your user config.. Yes but none is officially supported by ZSH, it's just distribution specific forks.\r\nIf we start accepting those, the conf files will be very subjectives and will have to include every habit and fork ever made.\r\n\r\nI suggest using the user config to sync it until it becomes official.. Can you confirm that it's working across computers? Because store applications are in a sandbox and are not supposed to work =(\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/615. I don't have a `~/Library/Application Support/Slack` folder, do you know why?. I'm pretty transparent about what it does: https://github.com/lra/mackup#what-does-it-do\r\n\r\n What do you suggest? Every  action needs to be confirmed already, and it's annoying for the regular users. . Also I don't understand what it could have deleted neither what happened in your case. Sorry for your loss, but as you said, Mackup is moving files into dropbox, that's it.. > I doubt many people would want it taking over git\r\n\r\nExactly, people who want autocommit don't use git, there are other alternatives, like Dropbox.. Yeah, lots of good reasons, but we would need to build an engine able to pull this database on demand in mackup.\r\n\r\nNot technically hard, just need to be done.\r\n\r\nDuplicate of https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/506. Duplicate of https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/506. No, I just don't have much time to allocate to it recently, help welcome.. Why closing? Makes sense.. Merged in, thx =)\n. Mmmh, that's scary.\nI never had the problem.\n\nCan you give me the output of those 3 commands ? (No personal info shared)\n- `ls -l \"$HOME/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/\"`\n- `ls -l \"$HOME/Dropbox/Mackup/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/\"` (modify this if Dropbox is not the root of your home folder)\n- `id`\n. Cool.\nMaybe you need to reload ST2 to let it know that his files moved ?\n. The PR wasn't up to date, but it's been merged in with small changes.\n\nThx\n. For subversion, what about just syncing `.subversion/config` ? I'm always scared to sync host-specific files. What else is in the .subversion folder ?\n. I guess you are right for subversion, it's mostly cached credentials and server pub keys.\n. I agree.\n\nWhat would be a good command name for it ? `mackup uninstall` ?\n. Done. Thx for the suggestion.\n. Merged in, thx\n\nI'll certainly support config+plugins in the future which might make more sense for this kind of stuff.\n. Merged in, thx\n. Sorry but I can't let a stranger's tinyurl in, even if I'd own it, as people want to know what they download.\nPreviewing is not an option too. Shortening it won't make the install faster anyway.\nEven http://brew.sh/ show the full url.\n. You are right ;)\n. Merged in, thx\n. Merged in, thx\n. Merged in, thx\n. Hey, on this page I can see other files:\nhttp://support.alfredapp.com/kb:persisting-preferences\n\nIs their doc outdated ?\n. Merged in, thx\n. The intent is good, but the idea of mackup is to focus on config, `/usr/bin` belongs to the system and is there on a clean install.\nA better idea would be to sync `/usr/local/bin` but this is handled by other tools like `homebrew`\n\nTo solve this, I usually create and sync a `~/bin` folder where I put my executables, but it's pure personal behavior and I wasn't sure it was worth putting in mackup.\n\nWould it solve your problem ? \n. Merged in, thx\n. Damn I forgot that I can't sync ~/bin yet, as I enforce a 0600 mode on synced files, which will remove the +x bit to your bin files.\n\nI'll add this to the TODO and come with some way to do this later\n. Merged in, thx, I'm a little worried about the version being part of the config folder, aren't there other folders that we could add for other versions ?\n. Ok we'll see if other users add more folders or complain, thx\n. It is mentioned here https://github.com/lra/mackup#bullsht-what-does-it-really-do-to-my-files- but I did not want to clutter the CLI, as the more you put there, the less people pay attention to it.\n\nIt could break things, but mackup prompts a lot when things are not straightforward too (like an already existing file by a link)\n\nI'm open to suggestion to make things more clear, without adding noise.\n. Can you give me the output of `ls -al /Users/dbingham/Library/Application Support/SourceTree/` and `ls -al \"Dropbox/Mackup/Library/Application Support/SourceTree/\"` ?\n. Can you try this version ? https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/fix_sourcetree/mackup.py\nReplace your current mackuped sourcetree files if asked.\n\nIf it breaks anything, just move back your \"Application Support/SourceTree\" from Mackup to your user's library.\n. Thanks that helps I'll work on this\n. Could you try the latest version of https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/fix_sourcetree/mackup.py ?\nIt should fix all those problems for good.\n. you can bring back the sourcetree folder and `chflags -R uchg` it before.\n. For the chmod and xattrs being cleaned up, it's because dropbox uses a default umask of 0644 for files, and when you sync your ssh keys (or any other license) you don't (and can't for ssh) have your key files readable by anyone.\n\nAs I don't think it make sense for any user config file to be readable by anyone, I just blindly enforce a mode of 0600 to any synced file.\n\nThe xattrs are cleaned up, because OS X use them to set some ACL that prevent mackup to move some files around too, and I don't see the point of keeping those special ACLs if I 0600 any file. But I might be wrong here.\n\nAbout `hostusernamemap`, if you think it's a file that should be synced, we can add it to the list, feel free to tell me which file to sync here as I'm not a user of SourceTree.\n. Makes sense, merging in, thx for your help\n. That's an awesome idea, I tried and sadly it appears that Font Book and the whole OS X font system does not support a linked folder =(\n. If you want to try for yourself and find a way to make it work:\n\n``` bash\ncd\nchmod -N Library/Fonts\nmv Library/Fonts TestingFonts\nln -s ~/TestingFonts Library/Fonts\n```\n\nAnd open Font Book, your user fonts are gone.\n\nTo rollback:\n\n``` bash\ncd\nrm Library/Fonts\nmv TestingFonts Library/Fonts\n```\n\nBut I'm missing something, as my font are not back in Font Book.\n\nCan someone have more info ?\n. Logout/login to bring back the font and you move back the folder into place, but I still can't get the fonts in Font Book and the folder is linked to mackup's\n. @zenwheel this is a good idea.\nTried some stuff, hard link for folders are internally supported on HFS+, but not available command line (man ln)\n\nIf I use the system call, I can hard link a folder to dropbox, but it does not detect the changes later.\n\nBut apparently it does if I copy the folder to Dropbox 1st, and hardlink it outside later.\n\nIt might work, Im not sure yet, it might need some more work.\n. Depends on https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/613 1st\n. Merged in, thx\n. Merged in, thx\nCan you update your branch against master before doing a PR ? It will make things easier for me !\n. https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#get-official-support-for-an-application\n. Isn't Chrome supposed to sync everything itself when you login in with your Google account ?\n. PRed in https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/153\n. @TimCorcoran you r right sir\n. That's an awesome idea.\nLike @nZac said, a basic config file is almost in: https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/49\n\nWhen in, I'll release 0.4 and that's something that can be worked on.\n\nWhat I was thinking is a `Storage` section with the supported engines (have a better name ?)\n\ne.g.\n\n``` ini\n[Storage]\nDropbox\n```\n\nWould enable the actual dropbox engine and its folder detection, as no path is specified. or:\n\n``` ini\n[Storage]\nFolder: /path/to/expandrive/folder\n```\n\nWould store the links in the specified folder.\n\nOnly one should be enabled at a time, or it would error out.\n\nThis is just a rough idea. Thoughts welcome.\n. Like @chrishas35 proposed, we could also enforce this behavior by using command line args (we should maybe also do it for ignored apps BTW)\n. Supported in 0.7.\nSee https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/doc/README.md\n. Mackup is very simple, your ST2 files are either in `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/` either in `~/Dropbox/Mackup/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/`\n\nHopefully it did not break anything serious.\n. That's interesting, but I think we should do something better, like detecting that ST2 is running, and if it's the case, exiting with this message.\n\nDo you know how to detect that ST2 is running ? process list ? any lock file created ? There must be a way\n. I can do a\n\n``` bash\npgrep \"Sublime Text 2\"\n```\n\nbut I'd prefer a python way\n. Yeah, I try to avoid deps at all cost to have a simple install.\nI did this: https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/43c5410edce0d6bd7745a1510c7b57e41092dcc1\nIf it cause any trouble, please open an issue again.\nThx !\n. Thanks a lot ! That has given me the will to finally support a config file, wouldn't have done it this well, with py3 support ;)\nI hope you don't mind, I took your PR and moved things around a bit.\nPlease check it out: https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/49\n. That's perfect\nI'm trusting you for apps I don't own.\n. Well, the specified folder is 3.3GiB on my Mac, we should try to only sync the config, not the data ;)\nAny other suggestion ? If not I'll take a look when I have time\n. Tried and when launching Sparrow, it asks me to create my account (I have 2)\nReverted to original files, and Sparrow works again.\n. Leaving this opened in case anyone feels like digging into syncing Sparrow\n. Depends on https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/615\n. Does not work, the problem is that you need Terminal.app open to run Mackup, and when you close it, it overwrites any synced config.\nI did not figured a way to go around this yet. Any idea ?\n. I'll give it another try if you confirm\n. Cool, if you manage to find an easy one day, help appreciated !\nI'm using Terminal and it's one of the few apps I need to manually configure =(\n. Trusting you on this one\n. aaaaw too late, I'll revert\n. open another PR pls\n. Awesome !\nYou should maybe linke 0.3.2, the tag exists.\nYou can always update it later.\n. I mean that your linked to https://raw.github.com/lra/mackup/0.1/mackup.py while https://raw.github.com/lra/mackup/0.3.2/mackup.py is more recent.\n\nBut that might be your intention.\n. You need to change the sha1 then ;)\n. It's in this state https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/pull/19879\n. Done, thx !\n. I started from scratch but got it merged ;) https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/d6a244b0882170feb034ca81b23b714e5dea9664\n. :thumbsup: @nZac \n. @nZac Yep I'll bump it on master\nForgot to handle the case sensitivity, feel free to propose a better solution if it's not aesthetic enough, I'm not super proud of it ;)\n\nI'll sleep on it anyway.\n. It depends on the applications, but I don't see why there would be a problem.\nYou can open an issue if you find any and we'll look into it =)\n. I just released 0.4, and merged your other PR (it closed this PR automatically)\nFeel free to reopen this one against `master`, we'll do a 4.X for this ;)\nSupport for multiple engines was getting in the way, kind of.\n. Wow, that's super helpful, I'll review/test/polish this tonight hopefully\nI planed to do this post 0.4, but we can give this a shot =)\n. Location would only be needed for dumb engines (like storing the files in a simple folder)\nAny engine that can detect the folder automatically will not accept a path, like Dropbox or GDrive.\n\nBoth can coexist =) No worries I'll clear things up by merging things one after the other\n. `mackup.cfg` is in btw\n. This weekend I hope =)\n. Added the support for nvALT on master, try to keep PR isolated, they'll get merged faster ;)\n. Mackup has been modularized a bit so it's easier to add support for things like this.\nThis is gonna happen =)\n. Supported in 0.7.\nSee https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/doc/README.md\n. @hakubo it should be in, thx to @TimCorcoran !\n. https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#get-official-support-for-an-application\n. Yes sorry, I'll push a hotfix !\n. Cool I'll trust you on this one =)\n. Merged in\n. It's been fixed, thx\n. Sure,\n\nWhat are those files ? Why would you want to sync them ?\n\nIn the near future, Mackup will have an easy to let the user add synced paths and files, you should not have to fork for this.\n. https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#get-official-support-for-an-application\n. Sorry about that, thanks\n. Merged in, thx\n. It's in, thx =)\n. Merged in, thx\n. Need https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/615\n. @TimCorcoran I don't want to abuse, feel free to work on anything that's opened ;)\n. PR up for this https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/493\n. Thx, it's in\n. I'm not abandoning the project, check the commit logs, it's constantly updated =)\nIt's true that merging apps and features in a single commit does not make it easy to review/merge.\nBut also some features require more thoughts before getting merged in.\nMackup is touching user's files and we don't want to mess anyone's system out there.\n\nRegarding the other fork, I've been told that the guy spammed mackup's contributors. He got excited, forked and changed the name, merged some PR and that's about it. I don't really care but let me help you with the link ;) https://github.com/matyhaty/dropboxAppSync\n\nOn mackup side, the big plan is to lay down a clear path for the features that have been asked. I don't care about the implementation, but the UX is important: it's a complex problem and I'm very careful to not make Mackup too complex (e.g. with command line args and config files in multiple formats that conflict each other).\n\nHope that clarifies =)\n. Yeah sorry, I misread about the email.\n\nRe what to do: Frankly I don't know, I never got the time to deeply think about it, and I don't want you to do something that's not gonna be used.\n\nBut in order to advance, I can tell you what I'm sure of: You can close this PR and create new ones:\n- One per app for each app supported (or with improved support if it's already in, I remember having merged some from you)\n- One for the custom apps feature. Whatever happens, this feature will be built and I'll merge your PR, or worst case, use your PR as a starting point.\n\nRegarding the feature, here are some thoughts:\n- It can be a big json file containing all the apps, near the binary, or a bunch of small json files, one per app, in a dedicated folder.\n- The actual json format used in mackup is simple (a list of path for each path) but it prevents us to do more, e.g. specify permissions for certain files, or specify files to exclude. It needs to be more specific and support future changes.\n- Do we put the json in the same repo (like homebrew) or in a different repo, acting as a mac application database that can be worked on separately.\n- What about ini or yaml as a file format ?\n- The installer needs to be improved if mackup is not just one file anymore, homebrew is fine.\n\nThere we go. If you create a new PR, feel free to paste/rephrase those questions, IMHO those need to be answered before starting the implementation.\n\nThanks for digging this up ;)\n. A GUI is definitely wanted, ref. https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/TODO.md\nLet's not diverge from the original intent of this PR though.\n. Ok, the custom app feature is in 0.6, which is out.\nA lot of burden needed to be solved, sorry about the time it took.\n\nFor the applications supported in this PR that are not in yet, please feel free to open a PR per app based off master.\n\nThanks for the suggestion and the work !\n. Thanks\n\nBefore merging in, we need:\n- to be sure that the commands exist, this can live in a function called in `_check_for_usable_environment()`\n- use constants for `Darwin` and `Linux`\n- put the system calls in explicit functions, to have platform independent `chmod` `delete` and `is_process_running`\n. Merged in, thx for the help !\n. No news here, more detail on how to best fix it would help.\nIt seems the problem is that mackup is trying to sync the whole `.gnupg` folder and there are sockets in it, which mackup does not know what to do with.\n\nCan you come up with an explicit list of which files mackup should sync in the `.gnupg` folder ?\n. Thanks, the problem is happening a lot as a bunch of new users are using mackup.\n\nI followed your advices and selectively sync this:\n\n``` python\n    'GnuPG': ['.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf',\n              '.gnupg/gpg.conf',\n              '.gnupg/secring.gpg',\n              '.gnupg/trustdb.gpg',\n              '.gnupg/pubring.gpg'],\n```\n\nThe gnupg doc is great at explaining what should be kept http://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg-devel/GPG-Configuration.html\n. I'll release a new version now\n. Merged it with some changes, thx\nRemoved some synced Spotify files which are more local cache\nAlso removed support for uTorrent, files are changing all the time\n\nIf you can improve the support for those, please open a PR again ;)\n\n++\n. I don't get it ;)\n. Thx it's in !\n. It's in, thx\n. It's in, thx\n. Mackup chowns 0700 or 0600 everything now.\n. How come ?\nIf you run sublime under your user, it should be able to read files that are user-readable by you.\nCan you get more details ?\n. Why are those files and dirs owned by root ?\n. Did you ever sudo'ed mackup ?\n. My suggestion here would be:\n\n``` bash\n$ sudo chown -R leoj \"/Users/leoj/Library/Application Support\"\n```\n\nNo file in your home should be owned by root.\n. Same with Mackup's files\n\n``` bash\n$ sudo chown -R leoj \"/wherever/your/dropbox/folder/is\"\n```\n. Actually, that's a good idea, I'll prevent mackup to run under sudo.\nAdded to the TODO\n. Should be in\n. It's in\n. On restore, should I check the link, and if pointing to nowhere, delete it ?\n. Dupe of https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/612\n. Added in https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/579d29ce67e711ce08933b2c0e11f676fcdb5369\n. Hi,\n\nCan you confirm we need to sync the whole `.bash_it` folder ?\n\nFrom https://github.com/revans/bash-it/blob/master/README.md it seems like `.bash_profile` and:\n- `aliases/custom.aliases.bash`\n- `lib/custom.bash`\n- `plugins/custom.plugins.bash`\n\nBut I'm not using it so I might be missing something.\n\nAny idea ?\n. Okay thanks. will sync the whole folder.\nMerging soon.\n. Merged, thx\n. Merged in, thx\n. Merged support for Htop and Janus.\nFor the other ones, can you open one PR per application ? And also make sure you only include config files ? e.g. I don't think you want to sync your vagrant images.\n\nThx\n. Thx it's in\n. I can't find any ref of this folder in the bash doc: http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html\nCan you give me a pointer ?\n. It's in, thx\n. `.heroku` has a lot of files.\nWe might want to explicitly save the config files here.\n. Ok but we are more talking about the specific heroku-account plugin here.\nWill merge with req changes to the PR.\nThx\n. It's in thx\n. Can you describe what the `.gem` and the `.bundler` folders are for ?\n. Ok thanks, will merge\n. It's in, thx\n. It's in thx\n. Dupe of https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/612\n. GJ, will add some doc about it.\n. Merged in\n. That's a good idea\n. Will try to reproduce it.\nIt's weird that mackup find those 2 files to sync, but can't copy them as they don't exist anymore when it tries to copy them into Dropbox...\n. I'm unable to reproduce it with a pristine Textmate 2 install.\nThe `iPhone.tmbundle` does not exist at all.\nDo you have a way to reproduce it ?\n. Do you still experience the problem?\n. Fixed in https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/34b727be360f5c17396d5630ddeef12c55cb43e1\n. Perfect PR :+1: \n. @tkeeler33 Thanks, WTG to ask upstream to support this kind of stuff.\n. Of great, they added it in the 10.9 command line tools, thx for the info !\n. Perfect, thx\n. It should already be the case, 0.5 added GNU/Linux support.\nPlease describe any problem you might encounter.\n. Can you give more details ?\nAre you using the same dropbox account on both computers ?\n\"It doesn't work\" does not help ;)\n. Right, I guess we need to exclude some folders to be synced on some platform, thx\n. Could you check if it's fixed in 0.5.1 ?\n. Can you list the files to sync ?\nYou can do a:\n\n``` bash\nls -l ~/Library/Preferences/com.stata.* ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Stata/\n```\n\nThanks\n. Same, tell me if there is a problem.\n. Tell me if it's not working\n. Thx\n. Added a TODO for encryption: https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/606\n. just merged a PR to not sync ssh keys by default https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/295\nif anyone wants to do one for GnuPG, you are welcome.\n. Merging this in https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/111\n. Merged in, thx\n. Merged in, thx\n. Merged in, thx\n. Passe le bonjour a OB ;)\n. Can you also add yourself in the changelog ?\n. Merged in, thx\n. Nice, I guess it's not needed then =)\n. If someone can get the blessing from the dev that's cool.\n. Sorry about that, I'm open to any suggestion as english is not my mother tongue.\nThe name used in the config file is the name defined in the application, at the top of the mackup.py file: https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup.py#L59\n\nCould you propose a modified README and comment in the config file to make it more clear ?\n. Clarified in https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/.mackup.cfg#L26\n. Merged in, thx\n. Can you open a PR ?\n. Yeah, we usually don't want to sync binaries\n. https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#get-official-support-for-an-application\n. PR welcomed\n. I can close this I suppose\n. I think that makes sense.\nIt will also be required when supported other storage engines, like GDrive.\n. Supported in 0.7.\nSee https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/doc/README.md\n. Already done\n. It's in, if there is any problem, open an issue and I'll disable the problematic app sync\n. A PR is welcome =)\n. Can you fix the typo ? Look at the test.\nThx\n. Perfect, thanks, @peterhajas feel free to tell if the 2nd file you mentioned does need to be synced\n. As @JakeBilbrey said, Alfred already support cloud syncing, can you remove it and add the 2 other apps in the README and the Changlog ?\nMore info on https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n\nThanks !\n. Thx, it's in\n. IMO we should not fight against their business model.\nIt also could cause conflicts for the paid version users who already sync it in Alfred.\n\nIn https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md I put:\n\n> Don't contribute an application that already provide a way to sync its config. e.g. Google Chrome or Alfred (paid version)\n\nI just made it more specific ;)\n. If someone can get their approval, I'm fine.\n. Thx, it's in\n. Sorry, too many things together in this PR, will have to close this.\nFeel free to create a PR per app support added.\n\nRegarding app store apps: Another issue exists: https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/615\n. https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#get-official-support-for-an-application\n. Not sure I understand, `.mackup.cfg` is already synced: https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup.py#L194\n. Closing this as the support for `.mackup.cfg` is in and I'm not sure it's a problem anymore. You might have been using an older version.\n. Merged in, thx\n. Right thanks =)\n. About Alfred 2, it might be a paid option, but it exists, and Mackup's goal is not to bypass some app business model ;)\nSee https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/116\n\nAbout the filezilla syncing, I don't see why it should not work.\nWe might want to add a dry/debug mode, it could help.\n\nTry putting some print lines where it make sense for now ?\n. Filezilla support is already in.\nSee https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/fcfc992ef7b36f20337ee9503337d66a70497158\nClosing this unless as it looks like it confuse some of us ;)\nUnless I'm missing something ?\n. @TimCorcoran True, but right now we have a simple approach. We might encrypt things in a future.\nActually that's a good idea, adding it in the TODO.\n. TODO: https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/606\n. Hi,\n\nThis multi-feature PR makes it hard to review and merge.\nCan you open a PR per feature you want to add ?\nGuidelines are available at https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n\nThanks !\n. Merged in, thx\n. Makes sense, fixed in https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/13952f3b3881b8b49f4d3d49836f99e2000cf0dd\n. Added in, but I cleaned up some changes. Thx\n. I like those little perfecting PRs, thx !\n. Cab you change `-S, --simulate` to `-n --dry-run` (more unixish) and update your PR against master? We now use docopt for the CLI.\n. cool, feel free to improve it!\n. That's great, thx !\n. This is cool, thanks.\nAdd yourself to the changelog next time =)\n. No this is great, I initially did the 1st test hoping somebody else will write the rest.\nThx !\n. Thx, I'll add the changelog entry\n. Thx, will add the changelog\n. Thx again, changelog will be added\n. Right, in the future, support for syncing in any folder is planned though. See #39\n. Supported in 0.7.\nSee https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/doc/README.md\n. For the record: PR also proposed in #192\n. Supported in 0.7.\nSee https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/doc/README.md\n. Merging, thx.\nAdd yourself to the WIP section of the Changelog, not to an already released version.\n. Merging, thx, same: changelog should be added in the WIP\n. I'm not sure about this one.\nI use Google Chrome and everything is already in sync by using a Google Account.\nI'm scared that it would conflict with the internal syncing system of GChrome.\n. Yes but enabling it by default would break a lot of configuration, e.g. everyone using a Google Account.\nThere is still no clear way to not enable every app sync by default.\n. And won't Chrome support syncing of extensions in the future ? Looks dumb from Google to not try to solve this problem.\n. Depends on https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/614\n. nice, thanks for digging.\n. That's annoying.\n\nI tried with Vox though and it seems that replacing the `~/Library/Containers/com.coppertino.Vox` folder with a link elsewhere did not cause any problem.\n\nWhat broken behavior did you experienced ?\n. Do you mean linking files directly works ?\n(e.g. instead of linking `Containers/Sip` you link `Containers/Sip/File1` and `Containers/Sip/File2`)\n. Yeah, links are ruled out. The app dev need to ask for permissions when submitting to the app store and tell which file outside of the Container app folder it needs to access, with a good reason.\nHard links or file copy are the only options here.\nBut hard links are not supported by dropbox (it wont detect changes)\nAnd file copy means mackup need to watch over those files for changes from time to time.\n\nMackup could add itself to the user's crontab and diff/sync those files every X min, keeping latest modified all the time (local or dropbox), but there might be problems when multiple computers are on.\n. We don't need 2 \"taps\" to handle apps differently, a simple config option in the app cfg can work.\ne.g.\n\n```\n[application]\nname = Super Duper\nsync_method = copy\n```\n\nFor this app mackup will not link the conf files, but just copy them when it's being run.\n\nThen as you mentioned, the real problem here is that we let users in the dark, not knowing what's in sync.\n\nThat's where the `mackup status` feature in the TODO can help.\nIt could display the list of apps both installed locally or not installed but with a conf in Dropbox.\nFor each of them it would say `in sync` or show when the last sync have been done, or even if it has never been done.\nObviously, for apps with linked config files, it would always display `in sync`, but at least the user could know what config is outdated (from the apps with a copy sync_method) and showing that it has not been synced for 20 days can help the user decide.\n\nMaking mackup optin instead of optout is another question.\n. Cool I guess we have a plan then, thanks for helping clarifying this out.\nIMHO the plan should be:\n1. split out mackup from one big main.py to a bunch of modules (that was the point of 0.6 work)\n2. implement a `status` option\n3. implement a `copy` sync method\n4. add app store apps in\n. `status` being just a display option, it can work and be usuful now, it will just display \"in sync\" for the applications that are currently synced.\nWe don't need 3. or 4. to build 2., but we can't have 3. or 4. without 2. so it's better to build 2. before no?\n. That's true, but I don't see support for copy/sync methods without letting the user know what's happening, given by the status.\nAt worse, if we hit a wall, the display feature will be there and useful anyway.\n. I don't see how mount -o bind can help here, can you get into more details if you have a solution ? Keep in mind that Dropbox need real files in his folder to detect changes and sync them, or it will do nothing.\n\nPutting symlinks in Dropbox does not work as the point is to sync the files content.\n. @yangm97:\n- You can't mound -o bind a folder on a folder, at least on stock OS X, and it would not work for files anyway\n- Putting a link in the middle won't fool the OS.\n- There is no -l option on OS X `cp` and hardlinks are not an option as dropbox is not able to detect changes.\n\nI might have totally missed your point, but I don't get it.\n. Well, unless we have a working solution, there is no progress on this.\nAnyone has a \"working\" plan?\n. Once https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/613 is in, it should not be a problem\n. Thanks!\n. You can now do this using the cfg files.\nSee https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/doc/README.md\nTell me if it's not covering a use case.\n. A vimwiki folder in your home is a little too obvious.\nApparently vimwiki let you specify where you vimwiki folder is.\nWhy not putting it in Dropbox ?\n. Got it, can you update this with the new application config file format? (just merge master in)\n. Thanks for letting me know\nhttps://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/02a1074d0d215aa10564e6c0c6e08f5ad1aecaa2\nFixed on master\n. Will let you know in https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/189\n. No thats fine, GJ\n. Cool, thanks for cleaning this up.\n. Sorry but there are a lot of changes and it's hard to discuss about 8 different applications in a single PR.\nCan you instead create 1 PR per application, follow https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md ?\nThanks\n. 1. Checkout master\n2. Create a branch\n3. Put your commit in this branch\n4. Open a PR\n5. Back to 2 for the next application\n. Cool thx\n. Not sure I understand here, I'm a user of 1Password, and it already syncs well with Dropbox.\nAlso I don't have some of the files you specify, e.g. APP_SUPPORT + '1Password/License'\nCan you elaborate on why we need this in ?\n. If I ever merge this, it will remove support for SABnzbd, Omnigraffle, ...\nClosing this, you need to checkout master, create a branch based off master, commit there, and open a PR.\nI made a clean commit to get the support in: https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/bcac2238e2e03351791d4a52b72bcd98db91621a\n. Thats cool ;)\nThanks for adding apps !\n. Same here, clean commit added: https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/5d6a8a5ff6c9d76e9f1dbeb99a071dc0c6a0e9b0\n.

It's in anyway, added the plist files.\nWhat's the reason for wanting to add the whole Lightroom ? Is there any folder with an unknown name ?\nWe don't want to sync binary/cache files with mackup, only relevant config.\n. What's the size of this whole folder ? The templates folders aren't too big ?\nThose things look more like resources to me no ? Things that are installed and never changed afterwards.\n. Done: https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/c59b9f808434a72e67936b4cc4ce23627f22ce6d\n. Cool thx.\nI don't know bundler, would it make more sense to only sync `~/.bundle/config` ?\n. https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/c2c5c14a09a738a681599c4fb5106252d33ce2b5\nThx\n. Perfect thx\n. @TimCorcoran added the support for BetterTouchTool.\n@pzbyszynski added the support for Forklift.\n\nThey might help you more than me.\n\nIn any case, if it is confirmed, we'll need to remove the support for both, some apps don't like symlinks.\n. Cool thanks for reporting.\nI'll close this until you can come up with more info about your problem.\nFeel free to comment again here.\n. Hopefully somebody else will do it =)\nThe homebrew guys don't like when the author update their software themselves there.\nhttps://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/wiki/Acceptable-Formulae#niche-or-self-submitted-stuff\n_\"We frown on authors submitting their own work unless it is very popular.\"_\n. :+1: \n. Yep that's a tough problem.\nOne of the thing I had in mind was to have mackup check any file in the Mackup Dropbox folder, and put it back to it's original place if there is no link for it anymore.\n\nThoughts ?\n. Added to the TODO\nTo answer your question, right now, the best way is to copy back the files manually at their original place =/\n. I don't want to delete the Mackup folder after uninstall for 2 reasons:\n- I want to keep the history of you config in mackup\n- I want people to still have the original files if mackup is uninstalling the files in a weird place, in case something goes wrong (you never know, a link to /dev/null and you loose a private key ?)\n\nDeleting the mackup folder in dropbox seems to be easy enough to balance with the security of keeping the files after uninstallation. But maybe I'm too cautious =)\n. Dupe of https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/605\n. Looks like mackup detected the file `/Users/Jake/Library/Application Support/Quicksilver/PlugIns/com.blacktree.Quicksilver.QSCubeInterfacePlugIn.8EB.qsplugin/Cube Interface.qsplugin` when it wanted to sync the `Quicksilver` folder, but the file was not there anymore when it wanted to move it into Dropbox.\n\nStrange, maybe we don't want to sync the whole folder here.\n\n@orenshk added support for Quicksilver, any insights ? \n. For the record: PR also proposed in https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/149\n. Supported in 0.7.\nSee https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/doc/README.md\n. Thanks for reporting.\nIt is a dupe of #73 \n. This is super lame, and we are not the only ones to be annoyed (http://rixstep.com/2/2/20130225,00.shtml)\n\nThere should be a way to flush the cache of cfprefsd. Anyway, it seems that we should not modify plist files directly anymore, and use \"official\" ways instead:\n- `defaults read|write`\n- python `CoreFoundation`\n\nWe could import/export specific things with those, the problem is that it won't sync anymore after the initial sync. And even if we dump the output in a file, we would have to do it constantly, which is not an option, as it's dropbox who's monitoring file content, and I can't make dropbox call mackup.\n\nSo we are hitting a wall here. Either there is a way to disable this cfprefsd caching behavior, either we use an interface to sync the plists and do it all the time.\n\nThe last solution is to not support those apps and wait and see.\n\nIn the short term, should we remove support for those and blacklist those until we have a plan ?\n. defaults write/read can only happen when you launch mackup to sync/restore, there is no way we can monitor the defaults to sync them in dropbox.\n\nAlso it does not support structured data (like sublists)\n\nIt could be used in the future, but it would mean building a daemon or a cron-like caller.\n. Frankly, until there is a workaround to this issue, I think we should just ditch support for those apps.\nLike you said, when the user is not able to trust an application (mackup) it's the worst, and I want mackup to be as clear as it was in the beginning: syncing config files for apps, If an app cache some conf, too bad for the app.\n\nThoughts?\n. A 1st guess would be every app from the app store.\n. Sadly no =(\n. Centralized in https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/615\n. That's something I considered when I started, given the inability for some app to follow some link, but I rapidly ruled out this solution which looks easier but defeats the real purpose of mackup.\n\nI wanted a tool that does not require me to act each time I change some application setting. You say it's not happening a lot, but I can assure you that it happened a lot (Text editor setting, favorite song, bookmark, ...), this is exactly why I built this at 1st: I was bored of git pushing my changes and bored of having to do a change at home I had done at work that I forgot to push. It happened all the time =)\n\nAlso, without linking, if you forget to update one file, and you update the same file differently on another computer, you got a conflict.\n\nThe only case where it would work is if mackup was checking all its files from time to time. But thats why I used dropbox in the 1st place: It does it well already and I'd rather focus on solving mackup problems.\n\nBut that's something worth considering as the field of conf files gets harder in the future, because of app store containers for example.\n\nI'll keep this in mind, but I think we should not give up this easily yet =)\n. What about the best of both worlds:\n- By default we link\n- For some specific app we sync (and we put somewhere that for those apps you need to sync manually if you want the latest settings)\n\nThis would require a more complex app database format, which I'll need anyway for other subjects (file exclusion, permissions, encryption)\n. Not sure I understand. Why would the \"best of both worlds\" solution would not work for you ?\n. Username are never referenced in any path, why would this be a problem ?\n. > However, isn't backup/restore + uninstall = copy?\n\nYes\n. right\n. Let's do it https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/613\n. Big generated files are definitely not supposed to be synced, only configuration. That's detailled in https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/README.md#what-does-it-do- and if it does otherwise, it's a bug.\n\nCurrently, Mackup is syncing:\n1. APP_SUPPORT + `Dash/DocSets`\n2. APP_SUPPORT + `Dash/library.dash`\n3. PREFERENCES + `com.kapeli.dash.plist`\n\nShould I remove the 1st one ?\n. On the next upgrade, you should kill the `Library/Application Support/Dash/DocSets` link and move back the folder from `Dropbox/Mackup/Library/Application Support` to `Library/Application Support/Dash/DocSets`.\n\nOr more simple, you can `mackup uninstall`, upgrade mackup, and `mackup backup` again.\n\nSorry about that !\n. By next upgrade, I mean when the next version is out, it's not the case yet\n. I trust you that there is nothing big in `'Adobe/CameraRaw'`, I can't check =)\n. Works on windows ?\n. Also what kind of big file ? We can't put Gigs in anyone's dropbox =(\n. Ok if you think it's useful, let's see if someone complains.\n. That's exactly the plan =)\nBut 1st we need to split the one-file-app into multiple, and that changes other things.\n. Done https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#add-support-for-an-application-or-any-file-or-directory\n. No that's a problem we have with some App Store apps.\nNot your fault.\n\nWe need to have a broader solution for this problem, for now I just removed the support for Ember, sorry about that.\n\nAlthough it's a Mac only app and they have iCloud support, so that should be enough to sync.\n. There is sadly no fix in #154, just a discussion.\nBut if it includes an option to backup into dropbox, Mackup does not need to support it anymore =)\n. What's in the `.config/livestreamer` directory other than the config file ?\nDo you want to be explicit and specify what they list in the doc ? \nhttp://livestreamer.tanuki.se/en/latest/cli.html#configuration-file\n. I guess we can then sync:\n- .livestreamerrc\n- .config/livestreamer/config\n- .config/livestreamer/plugins\n. Yeah go ahead, I always like to be explicit in the links listed to be sure we don't put in dropbox thing we oversighted, like cache files.\n. Depends on https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/615\n.

I'm not against the copy feature or ssh default exclusion, but people are jumping on those while they require some other changes before, listed in the TODO.\n\nYou can't just change Mackup to optionally have a copy mode or exclude by default for ssh and not for the others in its current state. It will just make it super complex to use as some behavior will change depending on the mode or the application. It's already too complex too use IMO and it will just scare people away or generate issues with messed up configurations.\n\nAny PR or help is welcome. Even issues to discuss the what and how to do some.\n\nRegarding contributors, I'm def open to it, but I'm looking for code contributions here.

Isn't there a better way to automatically detect the Dropbox home in the case of Dropbox Encore ?\n. I understand.\n\nWell it seems like `.dropbox-two` is used most of the time, but I think it's not worth it to add a custom setting just for Dropbox Encore, which looks a little hacky to me, and might be a Dropbox feature soon enough.\n\nTo support your use case, I'm leaning towards a setting to tell mackup where to store the files instead.\n\nLook: https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/custom_storage_location/doc/README.md\n\nYou could use the `filesystem` engine and specify your custom Dropbox folder.\n\nI'll see if I can get this out this weekend, as it's been asked for a while.\n\nThanks\n. Supported in 0.7.\nSee https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/doc/README.md\n. Hi,\n\nThanks for the bug report.\nIt's strange: What you show me is that Mackup can't copy a config file because it does not exist.\nBut to get there, another part of the code already checked that the file (or dir) exists before.\nThe explanation can be that the file disappeared while running Mackup.\n\nThe good thing is that this double check might reveal a problem that we need to handle, without messing with your system.\n\nCan you figure out which application is concerned ? It should be displayed before this traceback.\n. This is strange, gpg is not known to remove files on the fly.\nIf you only whitelist `gnupg` in your `.mackup.cfg` does it still do it ?\n. Can you do a `ls -l /Users/thomas/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg` ?\nAlso, do you still have the problem ?\n. Did you use mackup before 0.7 ?\nThe problem might be that mackup was syncing the whole `~/.gnupg` folder before, and now it only list some specific files in `~/.gnupg`.\n. That might be the problem then.\nWe changed the files to sync for gnupg from .gnupg/ to .gnupg/some_files and its very hard to come up with a migration in this case, as there is no versioning.\n\nIf you want me to get back on your feet, I can help.\n\nThanks for the report !\n. Wow that's a weird error.\nYou have the sqlite3 python package (cf. `/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.6/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/sqlite3/__init__.py`) but you don't seem to have the sqlite3 library.\n\nTry to do a:\n\n``` bash\n$ find /usr/local -name _sqlite3.so\n```\n\nIf nothing shows up, do a\n\n``` bash\n$ find / -name _sqlite3.so\n```\n\nIf nothing shows up, it means your python install is bogus, try reinstalling it maybe ?\n. Apparently that's a problem homebrew had a while ago\nSee https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/22655\nMy guess would be to reinstall homebrew's sqlite and python\n. Depends on https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/615\n. Cool thanks\n. I'll try to split your questions to keep track:\n\n> Can I re-run mackup backup whenever i add a new supported application?\n\nYes, it's an [idempotent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence) operation\n\n> Can we get documentation on specifying the folder to backup to?\n\nhttps://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#custom-directory-name\n\n> How one might migrate the backup folder from dropbox to say, copy or googledrive?\n\nI never tried it, but you should be able to do this following those steps:\n1. Make sure everything is in sync and up to date:\n   1. Upgrade Mackup\n   2. Do a `mackup backup`\n   3. Do a `mackup restore`\n2. Do a `mackup uninstall` to bring back your setting files into your home folder.\n3. Configure Mackup to use Google Drive (see https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#google-drive)\n4. Do a `mackup backup` to move you setting files into Google Drive\n\nIf you have another workstation using mackup, do all the steps, but replace the last step (`mackup backup`) by a `mackup restore`\n\nLet me know if it works, and I'll add this to the doc.\n\nYou can also do a pull request to update the doc if you want ;)\n\nThanks\n. That's cool but don't you think it should be the other way ? (e.g homebrew(-cask) installing mackup)\nOr maybe another meta-tool that would use homebrews and mackup to do it all.\n\nI kind of think mackup should stick to one thing and do it well, specially as it's a complex one already.\n. Cool. That's some serious bash skill there ;)\n. That's a good idea, but it would mean another type of information in the cfg of each application, e.g. a file to check, and if it exists, it'd mean the application is installed.\n\nMakes sense ? If so I'll add it to the todo\n. Thinking about it more, it should not be handled by mackup, mackup is already trying to solve a problem that's complex enough =)\n. Please check https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/doc/README.md#applications it's already supported.\n\nOn a side note, if mackup has synced an application which always change a synced file, it should not. It would help if you could tell us which file is making dropbox constantly syncing.\n\nThanks !\n. If you want to do a PR to make it more obvious, go ahead !\n. Right now the right way to do it is to be explicit about the files to sync in a folder instead of syncing the whole folder.\ne.g. for fish, in your case, you might want to sync:\n\n```\n.config/fish/file_a\n.config/fish/file_b\n```\n\ninstead of\n\n```\n.config/fish\n```\n\nI'm scared of adding a way to ignore files as it would make it more complex to read the config files, but maybe it's just me and it would be useful and more easy than doing it the way I showed up there.\n\nThoughts ?\n. There is a problem though: If you want `dir` to be synced, you can't ask mackup to not sync `dir/file` because of the way we sync things: we link the `dir` directory in your storage and cannot unlink a file in a linked dir. It would only work if we start copying files, which we might do at some point for some apps, it's not meant to be the new default way to sync configs though.\n\nSo in your case, the only option I see would be to change the config of the 2 applications listed from listing 1 dir to listing an explicit list of files to sync.\n\nRight ?\n. No I'm not, a PR is welcomed ;)\n. Merged in, thx.\nYou might want to `mackup uninstall`, upgrade mackup and `mackup backup` again to not have any issue.\nI'm not gonna release a new version in the next few days, but you can use mackup from the master branch, or just update the config files of your install.\nSorry for the trouble !\n. Yeah, that's a problem that need to be solved. No idea how yet.\nThose are good 1st ideas.\n. For the ones who come here, if upgrading mackup breaks your config, because the list of synced files for your app changes, the safest way to upgrade is to:\nOn your main workstation:\n1. mackup uninstall\n2. Upgrade mackup\n3. mackup backup\n\nAnd on your other workstations:\n1. mackup uninstall\n2. Upgrade mackup\n3. mackup restore\n\nA bit of a pain, but until we come up with a solid plan, I don't see a better way =(\n. Shower thinking... (I think a lot in the shower ;)\n\nHere some thoughts to advance on this:\nAn application config right now looks like:\n\n``` ini\n[application]\nname = Arara\n\n[configuration_files]\n.araraconfig.yaml\nararaconfig.yaml\n```\n\nWhat about a new `obsolete_configuration_files` section where we would move the configuration files that were previously synced by mackup, but superseeded in a previous version by the ones listed under `configuration_files` ?\n\nFor example, it would look like:\n\n``` ini\n[application]\nname = Arara\n\n[configuration_files]\n.araraconfig.yaml\nararaconfig.yaml\n\n[obsolete_configuration_files]\n.arara\n```\n\nEach time mackup would check the files of this application to see if it has anything to sync, upon finding one of the `obsolete_configuration_files`, it could just do a `mackup uninstall` only for this app, followed by a new `mackup backup`, only for this file again.\n\nThis works for the main workstation.\n\nIn case of a 2nd workstation, being synced after the 1st one, if an old `obsolete_configuration_files` link exists, it would just kill it, and do a `mackup restore` of this app.\n\nLooks like it can work, but would like other eyes on this algo to make sure I'm not overlooking a possible state where it could fuck up some user's files.\n\n@vitorgalvao you are pretty involved with Mackup. Any thoughts ?\nAlso @noeticpenguin you encountered the problem. Thoughts too ?\n. Wow that's a use case I never thought about.\nMackup is not designed to sync files that are outside of the user's home.\nWhat you are trying to do is not supported and may lead to unpredicted behavior.\nI'll push a way to prevent this from happening, by making sure no path starts with a `/`.\nThanks for pointing this out !\n. Fixed in https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/ac2456fe1b2cd67801c615cfa9baca94a891af9d\n. You can achieve what you want to do by putting apache conf files in your home, or in dropbox directly if you want.\n. It should be a configuration thing, and worst case, you can always link them.\n. Please be careful to limit 1 application support per pull request, thx !\nhttps://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. Just create a new branch off master each time you want to work on a new app.\nI merged those 2, so no worries ;)\n.

Also can you solve the conflict in CHANGELOG ? It will make you PR automatically mergeable again\n. Try to merge master into your branch, you'll see\n. Say so when you are done.\nI still see the get_custom_app_config code so I guess it's not.\n. Yeah it's a little confusing, and I can't imagine a lot of people will want to create a new application config on 1st run anyway. It's like if homebrew asked you to create a formula for a non supported application on 1st run.\n\nCan your remove this whole part in this branch ? You can still keep it in another branch and open another PR for later.\n. I will :)\nOn Apr 8, 2014 8:46 PM, \"Preston Carpenter\" notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> Is there going to be another pass through the code or does it all check\n> out?\n> \n> ## \n> \n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/236#issuecomment-39918418\n> .\n. I need a large span of thinking time to be sure this is not going to fail in some way, mackup is touching a lot of personal files and if we screw up, mackup is dead.\nIt's on the queue to be reviewed.\nSorry about my lack of spare time here, but I'm super conservative with it, as it can do very harmful stuff.\n. After giving it more thoughts, I made up my mind of having mackup to syncing anything by default. See https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/614\n\nBut this is still super useful, except that it should be triggered by the user.\n\nCan you make it an explicit action (e.g. `mackup configure`) instead of checking if the config file exist?\n. @sethherr PR welcome ;)\n. 1. do a `mackup uninstall`\n2. specify a `directory` name (see https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#custom-directory-name)\n3. do a `mackup backup` again\n\nFeel free to update the docs if it's not clear\n. I thought it was better to not do anything (not start a sync) when this happens.\nSee https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/doc/.mackup.cfg#L52\n\nIf people think it's better to get an error, we can do it, but I'd like more opinions on this.\n. Also can you add yourself to the changelog ?\n. I think that's fair =)\nI'm super scary of touching user's file and rather stop on the 1st strange thing, but in this case, it's kind of expected.\n\nAdded to the TODO\n. Ouch\n\nI guess you can do this:\n- in `/usr/local/Cellar/mackup/0.7.1/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mackup/utils.py` between line 75 and 76, add `print src`\n- run `mackup uninstall` again, it will display each file it tries to copy\n- each time it crashes like this, you can either create the missing file (or folder) or ask mackup to ignore the application that it tries to copy the settings of (https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#dont-sync-an-application)\n\nI hope it helps, I'll try to push a fix for this soon enough.\n. ok, do this then:\n\n``` bash\n$ sudo rm /usr/local/Cellar/mackup/0.7.1/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mackup/launchbar.cfg\n```\n\nAnd try `uninstall` again\n\nNo worries, the next mackup upgrade will bring back the file\n. I just looked at it, and mackup is already doing what I wanted it to do: Only copy back a file if it exists:\n\n``` python\n            # If the mackup file exists\n            if (os.path.isfile(mackup_filepath)\n                or os.path.isdir(mackup_filepath)):\n\n                # Check if there is a corresponding file in the home folder\n                if os.path.exists(home_filepath):\n                    # If there is, delete it as we are gonna copy the Dropbox\n                    # one there\n                    utils.delete(home_filepath)\n\n                    # Copy the Dropbox file to the home folder\n                    utils.copy(mackup_filepath, home_filepath)\n```\n\nSo there is something bizarre with your files, because it should not try to copy a file if it does not exists 1ms before.\n@aristidesfl can you launch those commands and paste here the output ?\n\n``` bash\n$ ls -l \"/Users/user/Dropbox/Mackup/Library/Application Support/LaunchBar/Configuration.plist\"\n$ stat \"/Users/user/Dropbox/Mackup/Library/Application Support/LaunchBar/Configuration.plist\"\n```\n\nRegarding the fish file left out, it's because the fish application config has been upgraded and is now https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup/applications/fish.cfg\nIt's a separate issue (https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/229) and to fix it you can do:\n\n``` bash\nrm ~/.config/fish\ncp /Users/user/Dropbox/Mackup/.config/fish ~/.config/fish\n```\n. Added more debug in 0.7.2, can you reopen this if it happens again?\n. Cool, can you add yourself to the changelog ? =)\n. Yeah I also forgot to mention to add it into the README.\nI'll do it ;)\n. And I think I'll just merge all the rubymine together\n. FYI https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/6e4721b8ee1d0f404a361525de1936e93a286966\n. Right, let's get https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/236 in 1st.\n. There multiple changes in this PR.\nCan you isolate different PRs for each newly added application?\n\nAs of the enable/disable feature, as you mentioned, it's not possible yet, see https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/608 for the dependancies.\n\nOnce the dependancies are in, we can shape this PR to solve https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/608\n. The 1st problem was a bug in 0.5.4 that tried to sync too many stuff for gnupg. It has been fixed later on and 0.7.1 has the fix.\n\nThe 2nd problem looks like a problem with a file that disappeared while mackup was trying to sync it. It happened for some other people and I'll add more verbose output to figure out what's the problem.\n\nThanks for the detailed reports.\n. @damiankloip you added the support for Atom.\nCan you confirm it's not a problem to sync the whole `.atom` folder?\nIsn't there some config file that are more relevant and safe to sync?\n. No you can. But if you have a better config, please open a PR =)\n. Can you give us a list of path to sync, instead of path to ignore?\n. Any candidate for a PR? =)\n. Merged your PR in master, let's see if it solves the problem.\nIf someone can test, I can then do a release.\n. what should mackup sync?\n. should we remove atom support for mackup then?\n. Fixed in https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/4b961f893f0f0b8c6563d1bceb317b5a15f11b96#diff-71aff7313d191778531bffb35ad2f1ab\n. Thanks.\nCan you also modify the README and the changelog?\nSee https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. Fixed in https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/34b727be360f5c17396d5630ddeef12c55cb43e1\n. Thx.\nAny reference to an official doc mentioning those file?\n. Dupe of https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/602\n. The `direct` in `com.mizage.direct.Divvy.plist` was a mistake?\n. Both might be valid: https://twitter.com/bkirz/status/426452375813885953\n. Yep, and also put your name in the changelog\n. It will get in the next version, thanks\n. Right, you can do this: https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#add-support-for-an-application-or-any-file-or-directory and add the `divvy.cfg` file in your `.mackup` folder until the next update\n. Looks like your homebrew is outdated, `brew update` maybe? Mackup 0.7.2 is in homebrew right now, and there is a PR for 0.7.3: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/pull/29659\n. @commadelimited \"If you override an application config that is already supported by Mackup, your new config for this application will replace the one provided by Mackup.\"\nHope it helps ;)\nAnyway the new version is out now, you should only have to upgrade to 0.7.3\n. Did you test it? Containers have proven to be problematic with other apps (app store apps). They are kept in memory and files are not updated in real time.\n. Can you add your self to the changelog to let the others know about the improvement?\n. I'm ok with merging this.\n@vitorgalvao u cool with that?\n. Dupe of https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/294\n. Thanks, can you follow the guidelines in https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md ?\n. README missing\n. Thx @vitorgalvao \n. What is your OSX python version?\n\n``` bash\n/usr/bin/python --version\n```\n. Which OSX?\n. It's strange.\nCan you run those to be sure your system is fine?\n\n``` bash\n$ brew update\n$ brew upgrade\n$ brew doctor\n$ brew uninstall mackup\n$ brew uninstall mackup\n# Run whatever brew tells you to cleanup all old versions of mackup\n# And finally\n$ brew install mackup\n```\n\nAlso I don't see why when you run `python --version` you get 2.7.X and mackup is getting 2.6.X. Mackup is using `#!/usr/bin/env python`\n\nDoes not make sense\n\nWorst case I can hardcode the `python2.6/site-packages` path, but I'd rather not.\n. Can you try replacing the `/usr/local/Cellar/mackup/bin/mackup` file with this content:\n\n``` python\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport sys\nimport os.path\n\ntry:\n    import mackup.main\nexcept ImportError:\n    # If Mackup is not installed globally, we are looking for the mackup module\n    # at the same path level as the bin folder where this script is in.\n    # In this case, let's dynamically add the parent path to the python path\n    bin_dir_path = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))\n    parent_dir_path = os.path.dirname(bin_dir_path)\n    sys.path.append(parent_dir_path)\n    try:\n        import mackup.main\n    except ImportError:\n        # We are being run on a half-backed system (*cough* brew bot *cough*)\n        # Let's hack our way in\n        hacky_packages_path = os.path.join(parent_dir_path,\n                                           'lib/python2.7/site-packages')\n        # On some systems mackup is running 2.6 python\n        # See https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/263\n        if not os.path.isdir(hacky_packages_path):\n            hacky_packages_path = os.path.join(parent_dir_path,\n                                               'lib/python2.6/site-packages')\n        sys.path.append(hacky_packages_path)\n        import mackup.main\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    mackup.main.main()\n```\n\nMake sure it's executable, and run it:\n\n``` bash\n$ chmod +x mackup\n$ mackup list\n```\n. no worries it will get replaced on the next upgrade\n. I revamped the package structure, should be good now\n. Thx @vitorgalvao \nLet us know if there is a way to make this more easy to find\n. That's cool.\nCan you add the app to the readme too? see https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. sorry, will take a look\n. Exactly:\n1. Upgrade `mackup`\n2. Run `mackup backup` on the computer that has a good config for the new supported app\n3. Run `mackup restore` on all other computers\n   All those commands are [idempotent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence) and can be run indefinitely, in case you are not sure.\n\nFeel free to do a PR to update the doc =)\n. Great! Can you add `tig` to the README too?\n. Please review https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. Glad it helps ;)\nYou (or anyone else) can follow those instructions: https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#get-official-support-for-an-application\n. Perfect, thx\n. We switched to docopt since your PR, mind rebasing?\n. thanks!\n. Cool, thx.\nIn the future, I don't mind 1 PR per app, really ;)\n. Thx @vitorgalvao \n@vircheck if you have an idea about how to make it easier to find this info, please tell us.\n. Fixed by https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/493\n. Thx @vitorgalvao =)\n. Do you know which files?\n. I'm not using it. If you guys think we should get rid of it, I'm OK.\nIsn't the iCloud stuff gonna sync things anyway?\n. thx!\n. I agree thx\n. Can you kill the old PCKeyboardHack application support, and merge the old synced files into this one?\nAlso can you add update the README and the changelog?\nhttps://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. Are the 2 still available? The 2 names are still valid? Any urls?\n. Yep, let's put PCKeyboardHack's files into Seil's conf.\nThanks!\n. I guess you can point mackup to another storage, do a `backup` to create all the links, change mackup to use your legit engine, and do a mackup restore to overwrite all the links mackup created.\n. The homebrew guys don't want stuff that is already available in pip.\nAs I did not want to be stuck to python, or to target devs only (pip is really only used by devs) I chose homebrew instead of pip.\n. Good idea, PR welcomed.\n. You can use this ssh config to overwrite mackup's without a problem, like @vitorgalvao suggested.\n. Merged, so this is now the default =)\nPeople who wants to sync their passphrased keys should create a `~/.mackup/ssh.cfg` file with this content:\n\n``` ini\n[application]\nname = SSH\n\n[configuration_files]\n.ssh\n```\n. (will release tonight)\n. Can you add it to the README too? See https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. Thanks, merged in https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/66067eea48c42a0be8a8fac780a55234552c4ef9\n. Should be fixed since Jan.\n. Same in all, spaces\n. Can u add a changelog entry?\nAlso don't you think it'd make more sense to augment the actual `tower.cfg` file?\n. ok\n. Fixed in https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/be67f6f582ce44d907d98f505f4aeffc9879e5c5\n. not sure, it was just failing I guess\n. Thanks that's great https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/b2e75a593b83ceaf3a7b8dd104142ac7c8ec6a28\n. Can't find the origin repo, is this PR still valid? Or you found a problem?\n. Merged in #452\n. You mean it crashes because you've removed Skype?\n. I don't think we can hardcode such things in mackup, any other app could have a legitimate .socket file\n. Ignoring sockets seems legit, yes.\nAnyone up for a PR?\nI'll do one when I'll have time if not.\n. Wait no we can't. If mackup links a folder that contains a socket file, it cannot excluded as the whole folder is linked.\n\nI guess for this, we need a better Skype configuration. https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup/applications/skype.cfg is too broad\n. Any Skype user can come up with a better config to sync?\n. Can you follow https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md ?\n\nThanks\n. Can you add yourself to the other files?\nhttps://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. Cool thx all\n. https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#get-official-support-for-an-application\n. Thanks guys for the detailed report, and sorry about the delay on the fix.\nHopefully this will fix it: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/pull/32833\n. Fixed by https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/pull/32967 thanks @lamielle \n\n@yonkeltron @Papegoja please open specific tickets, it's very hard to follow multiple bugs in the same issue.\n. yep, homebrew is a little behind sometimes.\n. Well I don't think anyone want to sync this huge amount of data over dropbox.\nCan you only list actual config files?\n. You can always ask upstream if you can't figure it out\n. Cool can u just resolve the merge conflicts?\n. Well, you can just add commits to this one, no need to start from scratch =)\n. You can still undelete your files in Dropbox.\nFeel free to open a PR to make it more explicit in the doc or wherever else.\nKeep in mind that everybody has different uses and too much warning won't be read.\n. Will be fixed by https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/614\n. Dupe of https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/109\n. Still having the issue?\n. What about saving the whole `Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3` then?\n. But that goes against what's being said at https://packagecontrol.io/docs/syncing\n. @szhousun @jbcdnr is it still a valid issue?\n. Ok feel free to reopen if it's still valid.\n. Still an issue?\n. Aren't those folders full of binary files?\n. Would be best to only sync actual config, no?\n. That's awesome, looks good\n. I agree, dupe of https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/613\n. @ChristopherA Should not be a problem, Mackup's config files are synced like the rest: https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup/applications/mackup.cfg\n. Can you maybe point to the doc for more info?\nhttps://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc\nOr it's more confusing than anything?\n. Thx @jannae \n. You are right.\n. @ChristopherA should have been fixed a while ago (January) by https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/691ca2009ae0c2be91553b948b52485172c49f8c\n\nPlease comment back if it's not the case.\n. Not sure I understand, a `.gitignore` in `$HOME` is useless no?\n. @jannae I totally agree, mackup should only track standard files, or it will be very hard to maintain everyone's custom things.\n\nCan we change this PR to match this and update the doc too?\n. It's already the case.\nIf you copy https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/doc/.mackup/ssh.cfg in you `.mackup` and only specify what you want, it will override Mackups' behavior.\n\nWe might want to make it more explicit in the docs\n. Yep, not saying this should be the way to go though.\nI like syncing my keys (they are password protected) but looks like some people don't.\nI guess it's up to the users to choose really.\n. @RickWong Any config synced with mackup is private, that's the essence of it and I made it to sync my ssh keys in the 1st place. The problem is that it's now used by other people =)\n. Dupe of https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/295\n. https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#get-official-support-for-an-application\n. Dupe of https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/613\n. Apparently your system has permissions that prevent mackup to move your `/Users/harrison/.subversion` folder around.\n. Can you add yourself to some files? =)\n. Can you also update the README? (remove the 12?)\n. thx!\n. Can you (or someone) open a PR?\nThanks\n. ps: The website is down for me, is this application still a thing?\n. If it's used by more people, we might integrate it as another sync engine.\n. Should we exclude `Library/Application Support/Viscosity` from https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup/applications/viscosity.cfg ?\n. The actual engine does not support exclusion, so we'll have to explicitly list everything we want to sync.\nAnyone can provide an updated https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup/applications/viscosity.cfg ?\n. We can't exclude `.Sparkle` in a linked folder, if you link a directory, you link it with all its content.\r\nTo do such a thing, we would need to:\r\n1. Implement a copy engine (vs link)\r\n2. Implement file exclusion in the config\r\n\r\nI feel like this sparkle stuff should live outside of the config.... cool, let's wait for this to happen given the amount of work it would require on Mackup.. Fixed in https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/906bd9fbd59a0554bb3db8acf0f4d0199bfa5a97 (could not merge your PR automatically as the original repo does not exist)\n. The problem with this approach is that we don't want to piss application authors: Sometime they make their user pay for the sync option ;)\nAm I being too cautious here?\n. Yep what @ponychicken says makes sense IMO, but what about apps that provides a syncing system? I also don't want mackup to break anything.\n\nWe need a simple rule that people can understand, and not including apps providing syncing was one.\n\nNot sure what to do here...\n. Can you add yourself to the changelog?\n. You also need to add it to the README, will do.\n. The default changed in https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/b2847f5750304cfd388ced4cf33bb14a3767c239\n. If you want us to add a warning text, feel free to do a PR about it or let us know what would have helped.\n\nAt some point, I feel like adding too much text is counter productive and people won't read it.\n. The point of using sets is to make sure there is no dupe conf file. I'd call this a regression.\nI'm not sure I understand why keeping an order is important?\n. I see, but I'd rather fix the underlying problem. We should not rely on order for a list of files that should be unique in the first place. The fix should be that in `get_config_files()`, for each application, we should nott add the stock application config if there is a custom.\n\nI will work on a fix.\n. @jannae we can try the default ones, and see how the community will improve this\n. It will have to wait for the copy mode then =/ https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/613\n. Can you follow https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md ?\nThanks\n. You closed it? =)\n. perfect thx\n. Sorry, I don't understand the issue, can you describe the actual steps?\n. Please follow https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md =)\n. Anyone feels like creating a PR to remove its support?\n. Be explicit about what you want to sync and not the whole folder. .e.g:\n- .weechat/config_file\n- .weechat/something_else\n- not .weechat\n. Please see https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. thx\n. :+1: \n. Perfect, thx\n. Feel free to add it https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#get-official-support-for-an-application\n. Dupe of https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/374\n. What does it gives us? I mean it does syncs over dropbox already right?\n. Makes sense.\nCan you follow this please? https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. thx!\n. If this is broken, a PR to remove support is welcome\n. Thanks for all your PRs!\n. Feel free do add it ;) https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#get-official-support-for-an-application\n. @matiux does it solves your issue?\n. Alfred already has builtin syncing, see https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/116\nAlso please follow https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. Maybe the root of the problem is that by default, Mackup detects and links anything it finds.\nLetting the user explicitly enable apps to sync would solve this issue (and the ssh keys one that people blame mackup for)\nBut the caveat would be that you loose the 1-command-to-sync-everything it has.\nI would not mind including alfred and chrome if it was not enabled by default.\n. This is great, thx\n. Do you plan to clone this whole git repo? https://github.com/bpinto/oh-my-fish\nThat's what the doc says will be in this folder https://github.com/bpinto/oh-my-fish#manual-installation\n. cool thx\n. https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md please =)\n. nowhere, mackup is stateless or it would not work.\nYou can try linking you old home to your new home, `mackup uninstall` and run `mackup backup` again.\n`ln -s /Users/old_name /Users/new_name`\n. Right, I always mix them up =)\n. https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md please =)\n. that's cool\n. Can you resolve the conflicts?\n. @zanderzhng so should we just remove complete support for it?\n. Can you add a note in the changelog?\nhttps://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. I don't have any so I can't speak here. Any other user feedback?\n. You don't think we should remove their support by default?\n. ok make sense.\n. Shouldn't the fix be applied to OSX paths too?\n. @jnv Nice link, I'll fix it\n. u did, thanks\n. @hiyer That's not what the page says:\n\n> If this file is copied to another machine, the next time Sublime Text is started, Package Control will install the correct version of any missing packages.\n\nhttps://packagecontrol.io/docs/syncing\n.

AFAIK this is not an official bash config file, you should customize your own mackup config.\n.

You can use the sync feature inside 1password.\n.

FYI I just merged a new engine for Copy, you can take a look https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/0f36b547da56155b26e4dbed95151586ebed80b9\n. Feel free to open a PR.\n. Can you add it to the README? https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. Should be fixed by https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/439\n. Can you try with 0.8? I merged some python3 compat changes.\n. `.config/sublime-text-3` are the config paths used on GNU/Linux. See https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/revert.html\n. Not possible as it is, but could be doable with some work.\nBut 1st we need to define how it would work: merge? replace?\n. Thinking about it more, I don't see a simple way to declare such a thing, sorry.\n. thx\n. @vitorgalvao you seem to know Apple Messages per https://github.com/lra/mackup/commits/master/mackup/applications/messages.cfg\nDo you think we should remove it all?\n. Should we remove it then?\n. I'd rather not add WIP to master's files to not confuse possible contributors. Feel free to keep a list around (e.g in an issue)\n\nFeel free to open a PR to clean the Messages config.\n. You'll have to wait the next release, until then, you can specify a custom config to fix this.\n. Should be fixed in 0.8.2, sorry about that\n. 0.8.2 is out\n. Damn, forgot to push the tag =( I need to automate this, thx!\nhttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/mackup\n. @glaszig  fixed\n. Awsome =)\n. Sorry, but I have a hard time reproducing the problem here.\nCan someone detail a broken config?\n\n```\nls -l ~/.mackup.cfg\ncat ~/.mackup.cfg\nls -l /path/to/Mackup/.mackup.cfg\ncat /path/to/Mackup/.mackup.cfg\n```\n\nand tell me which command line action is generating the error?\n\nThanks.\n. @rsnts fixed by https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/f765c009de633b5c8e787378cd62887b9771e81d\nWill be in next release\n. It would be possible, but rather confusing.\nTo keep it simple, what about having different configurations for each app?\nFor now as mackup is enabling everything by default, it would have to be a user config, until mackup allow to selectively enable/disable apps.\n. I agree, or once mackup does not sync everything by default, we could have apps like `osx-shortcuts`, `osx-doc`, ...\nAnyway, not possible until at least https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/614\n. thx\n. thanks\n. Should we remove `Library/Application Support/TextMate` from https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup/applications/textmate.cfg to not sync it?\n. Can you modify the readme and the changelog? https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. Can you clarify what you mean by \"which I have my own custom versions\"? If you ignore them why do you customize them?\n\nAlso are you running 0.8.2? A bunch of config related bugs have been fixed lately\n. You should, most of the config mess stuff has been fixed since.\n. cool\n. Cool thx\n. Can you point to an official doc mentioning those files? If it's just for you, it should be a user conf.\nAlso can you follow https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\nThanks =)\n. The thing is that it's the start to have `.*` synced, and we need a clear and explicit frontier ;)\nAs of now, it as been: if it's not official, it should not be committed. If you have something better in mind, do a proposal ;)\n. cool thx\n. closing until there is a proven way to sync Safari's extensions.\n. Cool stuff =)\nBut:\n\n```\n[analogue:~/src/mackup] Timidger-UtilsTest 14s \u00b1 nosetests\n.............Fchflags: /var/folders/d5/tj5tbxp912g9ftz5k44zhw1c0000gn/T/tmpBhBzX1/tmp0KtfAZ: Permission denied\nchflags: /var/folders/d5/tj5tbxp912g9ftz5k44zhw1c0000gn/T/tmpBhBzX1: Permission denied\n...............usage: the_program [-h] {backup,restore,uninstall,list}\nthe_program: error: argument mode: invalid choice: 'some wrong mode' (choose from 'backup', 'restore', 'uninstall', 'list')\n.\n======================================================================\nFAIL: test_can_file_be_synced_on_current_platform (utils_test.TestMackup)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/Users/analogue/src/mackup/tests/utils_test.py\", line 350, in test_can_file_be_synced_on_current_platform\n    assert not utils.can_file_be_synced_on_current_platform(path)\nAssertionError: \n-------------------- >> begin captured stdout << ---------------------\n/Users/analogue/src/mackup/tests/fixtures/Library/\n\n--------------------- >> end captured stdout << ----------------------\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nRan 30 tests in 0.145s\n\nFAILED (failures=1)\n```\n.

Mackup does not seem to be able to move `.shsh/.cache/lib-osx.jar`\nFrankly, I think the app config is bad, as Mackup should not try to sync cache files, and `.shsh/.cache` is an obvious name.\n\n@stechico you added support for this https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup/applications/shsh-blobs.cfg, any idea?\n. No: https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/602\n. not possible, what do you link then? `*`?\n. No because the setup is only done on `mackup backup`, and not done anymore later. And some application might add new files later on that would never be synced.\n. Dupe of https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/602\n. Then you the colorsync config need to be more precise about which files to sync.\n. Which file are you talking about?\nI see only 1 file synced in the flux config https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup/applications/flux.cfg\n. Oh so you are saying we should remove https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup/applications/colorsync.cfg ?\n@devnulled you added it, can you confirm it's problematic?\n. Which path covers `the automatically created flux files`?\n. Sounds like we should remove ColorSync support until https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/602\n. It's fine keeping all them in one config. Did you try the config?\n. Please can you follow https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md ? It makes it easier to discuss/review/merge.\nThanks\n. At some point, I'd like Mackup to be _transactional_. Instead of changing files directly, it would make a copy of the files in some isolated area (the temp folder), try doing the work there, and if all is ok, apply the same on the real files. If any failure in the middle of the work, it would just erase the temp folder, and the original files would not be touched.\n\nI also wanted to know if creating/deleting this temp folder would generate problems on some user's weird config, apparently nobody complains, and keeping this code make sure we can do the transactional feature without worrying about the \"where do we put the files?\" part.\n\nOnly the temp folder creation/deletion has been implemented yet ;)\n. IMO it's a bad idea to sync preferences that depend on what is installed.\nE.g. If I have an application icon in the dock on 1 computer, and sync the dock preferences on another computer where this application is not installed, what will happen?\n\nNot a fan of those in general, but maybe I'm missing something?\n. Ok, it might be a legit thing to sync yeah. I'd welcome another opinion on this =)\n. As it's only gonna work in certain use case, let's wait for https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/614 1st before adding this.\n. Any official mention of this file?\n. It's not an official git file, and must be explicitly stated in the git config no?\n. So mackup should look at the `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` env var and try to look for the `.mackup.cfg` and all the custom application files? All in addition to the usual `$HOME` place?\n\nMakes sense?\n. Ok then:\n1. try `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mackup/` and `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mackup.cfg` if they exist.\n2. if not, try `$HOME/.mackup/` and `$HOME/.mackup.cfg`\n3. if not, no config.\n\nMake sense?\n. Can't we have 2 things: the mackup config `.mackup.cfg` and the custom application database, `mackup/*`. But in the custom application database, there can be one for mackup, so in your suggestion, `mackup/mackup.cfg` would lead to bothe the mackup config, and the application database entry for mackup.\n\nUnless we move everything one level deeper, e.g.`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mackup/mackup/*` =(\n\nCan you link to any reference to this \"customary\" behavior?\n. No, `$HOME/.mackup/mackup.cfg` and `$HOME/.mackup.cfg` are 2 different things.\nThe former is a custom app database entry for mackup, the later is the mackup config.\n. ok let's do it then, PR welcome ;)\n. Thx, closing this then =)\n. can you add a line in the changelog?\n. Also did https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/9ca6e273bbd30c5569e3a672f8413333ac8b6bc1\n. What kind of graceful error management would you expect to see?\n. should be fixed by https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/759\n. Tests are failing ;)\n. Awesome! thanks, merged =)\nWill bump a new version today.\n. https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md =)\n. Are there official mentions of those paths in the zsh doc?\n. Cool thanks.\n. thx!\n. Me too ;)\n. Since your PR, we switched to docopt to handle the CLI. Mind updating your PR?\n. Cool, but for docopt to accept the --force option, it needs to be added here https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup/main.py#L14\n\nCan you update your PR?\n. It recently changed? Do we need to support both and we can expect all gdrive to be up to date?\nFeel free to open a PR anyone\n. Sorry I don't have the time to do a PR, feel free to provide one.\n. Fixed in https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/575\n. Again, mackup can't support all the files for all the behavior in the world =)\nWhere are those files officially mentioned by the git doc or source code?\nIf not this is more a `.mackup.cfg` thing, unless a lot of people think this is a defacto standard.\n. > I think this can be easily rectified by more prominently highlighting the \"roll your own\" feature in the main Readme.\n\nFeel free to PR =)\n. Dupe of https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/613\n. Of course, you can tell Mackup to only sync the applications you want: https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#applications\n. > It would be really nice if there was some kind of warning on the command line or in the README about this.\n\nWe can't have a warning for every file mackup wants to move, this would drive people insane, as they are already tired of the existing messages. See https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/493\n\nRegarding replacing symlinks mackup does not own during uninstall, the problem is that right now mackup works accross all the apps by default. This behavior is gonna change in https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/614\n. The problem of out of date syncing is still relevant though, we would have to copy the files instead of linking, and the users would have to regularly run a sync command.\n\nThis is another discussion IMO =)\n. Depends on https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/610 anyway\n. As it's a new app, can you add it to the rest? https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. Same, https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. bis https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. I guess we could.\n\nWe would need a way to specify a command line instead of a string to know which file to sync.\nCould be another section in the INI of each application.\n\ne.g.\n\nInstead of:\n\n``` ini\n[application]\nname = Git\n\n[configuration_files]\n.gitconfig\n.config/git/ignore\n```\n\nWe would have:\n\n``` ini\n[application]\nname = Git\n\n[configuration_files]\n.gitconfig\n.config/git/ignore\n\n[cli_defined_config_files]\ngit config core.excludesfile\n```\n\nMackup would be super careful as those commands could output non sense, nothin, command not found or even a different file for each workstation, which could lead to 2 different synced files.\n\nAlso, besides git, is there another example about this? Not sure it's worth it if it's just for git.\n\nAny other thoughts on this?\n. > A lot of applications support naming/placing the files something/somewhere different\n\nAny other example besides git?\n. You are right, I'll try to keep the discussion centralized.\nRegarding the matter, I'm sold to the idea that it should not sync it by default, we just need to name the enabling/disabling of apps simple enough so the empty default application list can be easily modified.\n\nLet's follow up at https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/109\n. > Mackup should actually not move any files without confirming with the user first.\n\nThat's an opinion, check the issues and some people want the opposite: to not have to be bothered.\n. once per computer + on every new app installed.\n. @enricodeleo here's mine ;)\n\n``` bash\n$ cat .mackup/ssh.cfg \n[application]\nname = SSH\n\n[configuration_files]\n.ssh\n\n```\n. I don't see any place where it's stated that `~/.git-completion.bash` is the official place for this file, looks like it's pretty user specific.\n. Do you mind adding a line to the changelog? =)\nhttps://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. try to keep it to 1 pr per app so a good app is not blocked by a bad one\nhttps://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. Cool thx\n. Awesome =)\n. https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md please =)\n. thanks =)\n. @TimCorcoran added support for it.\nAre you using it from the app store maybe?\n. no worries ;)\n. So what do you suggest?\nAlso please keep it to 1PR per application, it's hard to keep track of things otherwise\n. no worries ;)\n. Should we remove support for LR?\n. https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/7dee92d20cd9fff6538fcd11543f2bd488684409\n. Might be a mistake on our side. Can you give us more info? (distribution, pip version, ...)\n. Sorry but I can't reproduce this. Tried on a pristine 15.04:\n\n``` bash\nvagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-vivid-64:~$ lsb_release -a\nNo LSB modules are available.\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 15.04\nRelease:    15.04\nCodename:   vivid\n\nvagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-vivid-64:~$ python --version\nPython 2.7.9\n\nvagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-vivid-64:~$ pip --version\npip 7.1.1 from /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages (python 2.7)\n\nvagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-vivid-64:~$ sudo pip install mackup\nCollecting mackup\n  Downloading mackup-0.8.10.tar.gz\nRequirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): docopt in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages (from mackup)\nInstalling collected packages: mackup\n  Running setup.py install for mackup\nSuccessfully installed mackup-0.8.10\n\nvagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-vivid-64:~$ mackup \nUsage:\n  mackup list\n  mackup [options] backup\n  mackup [options] restore\n  mackup [options] uninstall\n  mackup (-h | --help)\n  mackup --version\n\nvagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-vivid-64:~$ which mackup\n/usr/local/bin/mackup\n```\n. Can you add `.emacs.d` if it's a dependancy?\n. nope it should not be\n. `.emacs` too?\n. mmmh maybe you are right we should not merge them and rely on the user to explicitely activate support for emacs.\nCan you remove it? =)\n. Can you add a line in the changelog? https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. Feel free to ask the devs\n. Fixed in https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/575\n. Did you try `mackup uninstall`?\n. I guess your only option would be to put back dropbox, sorry.\n\nTODO: Make mackup remove dangling links\n. Dupe of https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/612\n. mmmh, not sure, you should use the canonical name (the file name in `mackup list`)\nMight be a legit bug, if anyone want to look into it and fix it.\n. `mackup list` is built to display all applications supported by mackup.\nI think what you are looking for is a list of applications that mackup plans to scan based on your config.\nThis is not implemented yet, TODO: https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/603\n. It does not make a difference, as `mackup restore` just overwrites your app conf.\nFeel free to open a PR to update the doc.\n. Always use relative folder, never absolute.\n. ```\n[application]\nname = ../Desktop\n```\n\nSorry I have a hard time following you. An application named `../Desktop`?\n\nyou have some doc here: https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#add-support-for-an-application-or-any-file-or-directory\n. anything in your home, but you need to follow the documentation, \"[application] name = ../Desktop\" does not make sense.\n. We still need to support the old version, can you add back the previous file?\nAlso mind adding a changelog entry?\nThanks\n. how?\n![screen shot 2015-06-08 at 1 11 49 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/122286/8040632/f315c65c-0ddf-11e5-8806-d1dcd64ab82f.png)\n.

Please keep one PR per application, it's hard to work on multiple together\nhttps://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. conflicts\n. It's not an official file https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/472\n. If everyone comes with his own file to sync in the config, we'll end up with zillion files that make sense for no one.\nThe fine line is, if it's not official, it needs to go in the user config: https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#add-support-for-an-application-or-any-file-or-directory\n. It is not suppoed to delete this folder as people would yell at Mackup for loosing if it would.\nIf the community as a strong opinion about this, we can change it.\n. You are right, I updated it, I planned to do this at the beginning, but if you remove the Mackup folder on one computer, all the other synced computers will miss the files.\n\nSo I don't think it's easily feasible, any idea?\n. See `mackup status` in the [TODO](https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/TODO.md)\n. Dupe of https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/603\n. mind adding the rest? =)\nhttps://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. thx!\n. yep looks cool =)\n. you should be able to run `make develop` to test locally, and `make undevelop` to clean up.\nhttps://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/Makefile\n. feel free to update the doc\n. what is you question?\n. `make develop` installs the dev version on your system. You should be able to just do `mackup` and it will run the version based on the files you've cloned.\n`make undevelop` to clean things up and leave space on your system for the official version.\n\nI'm open to better way to develop =)\n. mind doing a PR to add it?\nI'd rather have someone else do it to make sure it's understandable =)\n.

Done, 0.8.6 is out https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mackup\n. yep, that's something I have in mind. With a dedicated repo for all the supported apps.

Shouldn't it be just the config files?\nhttps://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie#config\nLooks like this folder can have session stuff too.\n. cool\n. What you are asking is about the copy mode: https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/613\nLinked configs are always in sync.\n. yep prettytable too\n. uninstall the homebrew one, run `make develop` and `make undevelop` to clean up.\n. Depends on what you call a web UI, I don't think we want a HTTP server embedded =)\nBut the real blocker here is https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/603\n. Dupe of https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/229\n. You are right, I think this can come as a later feature, once this one is in: https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/615\n. @martin-liu it's explained: https://github.com/lra/mackup#bullsht-what-does-it-really-do-to-my-files\nFeel free to propose a better explanation in a PR.\nAlso what @zanderzhng said, you can undelete files in dropbox.\n. Can you point to an official mention of this file in the git doc or source?\nIf not, it's a user config.\n. Thanks, we really need https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/609 to make sure it does not break =/\n. In your case it would work, but what about people that don't define `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` ?\n. I certainly prefer this version:\n\n```\n[application]\nname = Git\n\n[configuration_files]\n$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config\n$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/credentials\n$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore\n.gitignore\n.gitcredentials\n.gitconfig\n```\n\nThe version with the `||` is just overkill and a pain to parse and handle.\n\nI guess we could evaluate this `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` but it breaks one of the rule of mackup: only relative path (to prevent stupid PRs trying to link things outside of home)\n\nMaybe we could require that `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is a subfolder of home, but what if some dumb user set `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` to /usr/share/I/dont/understand/unix. It's dumb but will surely happen.\n. That's interesting. Going one step further, what about:\n\n``` ini\n[application]\nname = Git\n\n[home_config_paths]\n.gitignore\n.gitcredentials\n.gitconfig\n\n[xdg_config_paths]\ngit/config\ngit/credentials\ngit/ignore\n```\n\n`home_config_paths` would prefix `$HOME` and `xdg_config_paths` would prefix `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`\n. you are right, let's go one step further to keep it backward compatible:\n\n``` ini\n[application]\nname = Git\n\n[configuration_files]\n.gitignore\n.gitcredentials\n.gitconfig\n\n[xdg_configuration_files]\ngit/config\ngit/credentials\ngit/ignore\n```\n\ncool?\n. Cool, PR welcome.\n. Yep sorry about that, you'll have to do a PR there to submit 0.8.9 or stick to 0.8.6.\nhttps://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/mackup.rb\nYou can also use pip to always get the latest version.\n. I guess it's due to a change in the ssh config: https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/dcb26baf56f13330c069eadad35ac8feca7ac215#diff-3727ac8ad7f5a3d72f5ca92808b32f27\nCan you try deleting the .ssh folder in dropbox and try again? (you can undelete in dropbox in case something goes wrong)\n. cool, glad you solved it. Migration between different configs are a pain we need to solve: https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/229\n. Strange that you don't get any error, it must be failing on one of the apps.\nI just released 0.8.10 on pip with verbose and dry run.\n\nCan you try the verbose mode using 0.8.10?\n. Do you have a suggestion for a better error message?\n. https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/189335f8420346eab4323ae829eab38577e672c9\n. tests are failing\n.

Can you `ls -l` it?\n. This is a lot of directories. What each directory contains?\nWe want to be sure to sync config and not data.\n. ok thanks\n. > What do you think of referencing environment variables\n\nToo fragile IMO, it will generate a lot of mistakes and thus support.\n\nYou can already ignore mackup, no?\n. can u resolve the conflicts?\n. I'll give it another review pass once those comments are dealt with, thanks!\n. no idea, I need to spend time reviewing it.\n. Syncing is builtin no?\n. Update on? It's been merged in Sep 2015.\n. Sure, why not.\nIt does not need tot be part of #603 \n. Can you fix the markdown? See `ci/circleci` status\n. It depends on where Apple Mail stores its config, if it's legit files, it could be don, I'm not aware of it.\n. Sadly I don't see any easy way to anticipate this.\n. Sorry I don't understand the full scenario. We already check for links https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup/application.py#L154\n.

Just sync the folder that contains those files.\nSee https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#add-support-for-an-application-or-any-file-or-directory\n. can you add Rhythmbox to the README and to the changelog?\nIt's usually easier to keep it 1 app per PR\n. all good =)\n. Well first we can't sync `/Library/Services`, it's not per user.\nRegarding `~/Library/Services` I think I tried linking it and it screwed things up.\nUnless Apple changed things, we can't.\n. you can use `ls`:\n\n``` bash\nls -l \"Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User\"\n```\n. See https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup/applications/sublime-text-3.cfg\n. Feel free to contribute! https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#get-official-support-for-an-application\n. If we say that mackup officially supports 1password: 2 things that are not straightforward and might confuse people:\n1. On my App Store 1password, the backups are in the containers of 1password, which is a dynamic path, e.g. `/Users/analogue/Library/Containers/2BUA8C4S2C.com.agilebits.onepassword-osx-helper/Data/Library/Backups`\n1. 1password already supports dropbox and all, there might be a reason why that don't put the backups in the synced filesystem (e.g. dropbox)\n\nFor those reasons, I think it might be more relevant as a user config, see https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#add-support-for-an-application-or-any-file-or-directory but if more people think it's a good idea, why not.\n. suggestion 3: don't ever use root as a user.\n. not really, will try to get a new version out soon.\n. done!\n. Did you try it? It should not work.\nApp Store apps are not supported yet.\nSee https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/615\n. Not sure people will appreciate having their bitcoin wallet on dropbox.\nIs it intended? (e.g. encrypted)\n. Thanks for all those additions!\n. just call it `ssh.cfg`, overwrite the default one.\nA mackup restore should be enough.\n. Can you tell me more about your use case?\nWhat do you want to achieve, and what commands are you launching?\n. Can u add an entry in the changelog?\n. changelog entry would help\n. Thanks, but please keep it one PR per app next time.\n. Covered by https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/684\n. I'm scared that the synced folder is gonna have a lot of cache/binary stuff. Can you dig in?\n. Try it locally and let us know.\n. Please https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. you can update a PR\n. Can anyone confirm that this indeed works? Usually Apple stuff does not like symlinks and overwrite them.\n. @ryanjbonnell @reitermarkus you said it works. @matti should I revert this?\n. The thing is that I don't want to make a release with a conf that does not especially, especially how cumbersome it's for a user to upgrade a mackup that remove support for an app =/\n. @reitermarkus @leesiongchan can you try what @matti did?\n. Sorry, merge conflicts, I just had a bug to fix.\n. I guess you'll have to mock.\nAlso I suggest doing 1 PR for python 3.2, and one for Windows\n. Can you point to some official doc or source code stating that the old path are not supported anymore?\n. You need to improve https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup/applications/skype.cfg\n. can someone come up with a PR? I don't use Skype.\n. > Is there a way to blacklist a certain dir?\n\nNo\n. Can you merge yours and all the other intellijidea into one `intellijidea.cfg`?\n. Please https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. I put as many warnings I felt were enough (e.g asking the user to confirm each action).\nIf you think the user should be more noticed, fee free to propose a PR.\n. I totally agree, and have to trust people who submit config as I can't try every application support out there.\nIf you have a better config for some app (better config = list of explicit files to sync instead of a whole folder) please submit a PR, it will be more than welcome.\n\nThere is nothing like wildcard, it's just files and folders. TODO is here: https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/602\n\nThanks!\n. Nice! Thanks!\n. Well, I'm guessing here because your description is not explicit enough, but sounds like you deleted the folder where Mackup links all config files manually, which means that you deleted all the settings files of your app.\n\nNot sure what you expect from this issue.\n. if you deleted the folder where mackup put the linked files, u deleted it, not mackup.\nYou can undelete files in dropbox, so you should be able to recover.\n. PR welcome\n. Yes, after you link `Dropbox (Personal)` to `Dropbox`, you can run `mackup uninstall` to unlink everything which will move back all the files into your home, then `mackup backup` to link back the files into dropbox using the legit name.\n\nYou can then delete the old `Dropbox (Personal)` link.\n. Can you fix the markdown? Tests are failing\n. Fixed in https://github.com/lra/mackup/commit/c76ba98bc02fb0acb4acf6d50c17b1f5f5f03040\n.

Thanks!\n. It's not possible, sorry.\r\nIt's technically doable but there are other priorities.. Sure, you can check this doc on how to do it: https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#add-support-for-an-application-or-any-file-or-directory\nThen make a pull request https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#get-official-support-for-an-application\n. I see, thanks\n. Can you merge all the PyCharm cfg files into one `pycharm.cfg`?\n. See https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/777 for an example\n. Until this is an official file, this should go in you user config, see https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/498\n. Please, test the PR you are submitting.\n. That would mean that this should not be touched by Mackup until this is fixed.\nCan someone open a PR?\n. should be fixed by https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/759\n. thanks!\n. Confirmed to now work, see https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/31\nIf this has changed, feel free to comment back.\n. OSX stuff usually does not like being linked. Can anyone else confirm this is working?\n. Do you mind merging this into `textmate.cfg`?\n. thx!\n. This is great thanks.\nNot sure if the folders you still sync are worth syncing, since I gave up on syncing Skype myself ;)\nI'll let you decide as you use it.\n. I'd rather have someone take the decision, as I don't use it.\nIf anyone else want to jump in and make the call (PR), please do ;)\n. Please follow https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. That's a good idea, but what about binary files?\n. Yep, Skype support has been removed like stated by @TCattd .\nI'll do a release in the next days, but I'd keep it ignored in the meantime.\n. Do you mind merging all the `phpstorm-*.cfg` into one `phpstorm.cfg` file, including yours?\n. Please, can you follow https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md ?\n. Syncing outside of the user home is not supported for zillions of reasons, sorry.\nI suggest contacting the developer of the application you use to let him know to not install user configuration outside of the home folder.\n. > Do you prefer to have two separate configurations (ultimate and community edition) or just merge everything into a single one ?\n\nI think that would be great, care to do it?\n. Thanks for this, looks like 0.3.1 includes your upstream fix too\n. Dupe of https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/782\n. `mackup uninstall` Copy back any synced config file to its original place.\nMaybe you uninstalled a new version, check the files that are still being synced and replace the links with the files in dropbox.\n. > mackup is still backing up to an old folder.\n\nWhich folder? Remove the link and copy back the files from dropbox there.\n. > Which link? The folder where Skype always seems to sync, like every 5 minutes sometimes, is \"/Dropbox/mackup/library/application support/skype\". But when I delete this folder and move everything to its original folder in \"/Library/Application Support/skype\" it doesn't take long and the folder in \"mackup\" is being created again.\n\nIf you say files are recreated in `/Dropbox/mackup/library/application support/skype`, then you must have a link at `~/library/application support/skype`.\n\nDelete the link, move your files back there, should work.\n. thx\n. Skype support removed in 0.8.14\n. huh, sorry but this will lead to a lot of confusion.\n`.ssh` is supposed to be owned by `ssh`, and this looks like a script hacking around its config files.\nThe problem is that if someone syncs `.ssh` it will mess things up.\nThis folder `.ssh/config.d` and everything in it should really be owned by `ssh`.\n. not sure how to solve this.\nMove `.ssh/config.d` in `ssh`?\n.

Skype support has been removed in 0.8.14. Sorry about that.\n. You need to remove the link.\nMackup just does create links, it does not syncs.\nDelete the links that point to Dropbox and it won't save those in dropbox anymore.\n\nIf you really don't know how to, last resort is to install the version of mackup you used when syncing skype, and run mackup uninstall, it will put everything back into place.\n\nBut it's easier to just delete the link.\n. Spot on, please open a PR.\n. Thanks!\n. thanks. Wow, that's really stupid...\n\nOK, I guess the box engine needs to rename those files to something line `.bashrc -> box_dot_bashrc_`.\nThat could work for individual files, but if a linked folder contains dotfiles, mackup cannot help here.\n\nNot sure if there are a lot of dotfiles in folders, but it's a possible source of bugs and confusion.\n\nAlso what about dot folders? Same behavior? Sounds like there is no easy fix on mackup side. Is there a way to ask box if they could make this an option? (ignoring dot files)\n. The problem is that it's a valid issue... Should we just drop Box's support?\n. Please follow https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. done, thanks. Mind making a PR?

Not sure I understand the issue, Mackup is supposed to detect the Dropbox path automatically. If there is a bug let's fix it, but requiring the user to manually set a path is not a scalable solution IMO, as it would have to be done on every workstation.\n. https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup/utils.py#L112\nWe do chmod all the synced files because they are supposed to be configuration files, and some files have keys and credentials.\nAs we copy the files to 3rd party software (e.g. dropbox) and some of them apply stupid permissions to those files, we had to go the conservative route (0600 on files and 0700 on folders).\n\nThis is not fixable as it depends on the behavior of those cloud storage services, and they are not consistent.\n\nSorry, but the only way here is to not sync executable files, just config files. I suggest removing those files from the list of files to sync.\n. Would you mind merging this and the other webstorm ini into 1?\nLike https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup/applications/intellijidea.cfg\n. the `.vim` or `.ssh` folders are not synced, specific files and folders are.

I can't see any official documentation about a `~/.gitignore` file.\r\n\r\n> Patterns which a user wants Git to ignore in all situations (e.g., backup or temporary files generated by the user\u2019s editor of choice) generally go into a file specified by core.excludesFile in the user\u2019s ~/.gitconfig. Its default value is $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore. If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is either not set or empty, $HOME/.config/git/ignore is used instead.\r\n\r\nhttps://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore. All good. yes, it's a shortcut I had to take, there is room for improvements. you need to uninstall it on every workstation you used it on.\r\n\r\nNot sure why it would not put back your xcode config, there is a hole in your scenario.\r\n\r\nAnyway, you can manually copy back all the files from the Mackup folder in Dropbox and put them back in your home folder, replacing your links: https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup/applications/xcode.cfg. based on https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup/applications/xcode.cfg, mackup never  touched `xcode.cfg`.. yeah it's been merged but not released yet -_-\r\nexpect a release soon. done: https://github.com/lra/mackup/releases/tag/0.8.16. This sounds like user config, I can't find an official reference of `.zshrc.local` in the zsh doc.\r\nYou might want to add it to your user config.. Yes but none is officially supported by ZSH, it's just distribution specific forks.\r\nIf we start accepting those, the conf files will be very subjectives and will have to include every habit and fork ever made.\r\n\r\nI suggest using the user config to sync it until it becomes official.. Can you confirm that it's working across computers? Because store applications are in a sandbox and are not supposed to work =(\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/615. I don't have a `~/Library/Application Support/Slack` folder, do you know why?. I'm pretty transparent about what it does: https://github.com/lra/mackup#what-does-it-do\r\n\r\n What do you suggest? Every  action needs to be confirmed already, and it's annoying for the regular users. . Also I don't understand what it could have deleted neither what happened in your case. Sorry for your loss, but as you said, Mackup is moving files into dropbox, that's it.. > I doubt many people would want it taking over git\r\n\r\nExactly, people who want autocommit don't use git, there are other alternatives, like Dropbox..

Ahh, I see. So there's no way other than to make the PR commit the Head of a particular branch. Okay, thanks. Will get those in, in a bit.\n. Hi @lra. I only saw the option in the 1Password (v3.x) Settings>General>Data File to sync \"1Password.agilekeychain\". It didn't sync the rest. I guess if we're just wanting \"settings\" as a whole with Mackup, then the rest wouldn't matter. Though, I'd would probably want the License on there to sync up.\n\n![screen shot 2014-01-13 at 7 08 15 am](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/38465/1897386/48d1ac94-7bdf-11e3-8d86-b13beac0e069.png)\n.

Yeah, it works.  But it messes with permissions in a way I wouldn't expect.  I would expect permissions to be preserved as much as possible.  For example:\n\nBefore (I put things back as close as possible to the original state):\n\n```\ndbingham-itko:SourceTree dbingham$ ls -lO@\ntotal 48\ndrw-r--r--  3 dbingham  staff  -     102 Nov  9  2011 MASReceipt/\ndrw-r--r--  8 dbingham  staff  -     272 Apr  2 11:17 SourceTree 1.5.8/\n-rw-r--r--  1 dbingham  staff  -    5361 Apr 30 11:37 browser.plist\n-rw-r--r--@ 1 dbingham  staff  -     812 Apr 30 11:37 hgrc_sourcetree\n    com.apple.TextEncoding    15 \n-rw-r--r--  1 dbingham  staff  -     366 Mar 18 09:45 hostusernamemap\n-rw-r--r--  1 dbingham  staff  -     236 Apr  2 12:35 openWindowList\n-rw-r--r--@ 1 dbingham  staff  uchg  568 Apr 30 11:37 sourcetree.license\n    com.apple.metadata:com_apple_backup_excludeItem   17 \n```\n\nAnd the files in the Mackup directory on Dropbox after a `backup`:\n\n```\ndbingham-itko:SourceTree dbingham$ ls -lO@\ntotal 32\n-rw-------  1 dbingham  staff  - 5361 Apr 30 11:49 browser.plist\n-rw-------  1 dbingham  staff  -  812 Apr 30 11:49 hgrc_sourcetree\n-rw-------  1 dbingham  staff  -  568 Apr 30 11:49 sourcetree.license\n```\n\nSo, I expected the `uchg` flag to be gone, but didn't expect the xattrs to be gone and the permissions to change from 644 to 600.\n\nIs that a limitation of Dropbox?\n. Also, while I'm thinking about it, is `hostusernamemap` not something we'd want to keep around?  The name sounds like something that would be fairly useful.\n. On the permissions changes, I doubt it'll matter for the vast majority of stuff.  Maybe someday you'll run across an application that just has to have its xattrs 'just so' in order to work.  But until then, I say, go with what you've got.  It makes things \"cleaner\" anyway.\n\nI _use_ SourceTree, but I don't know much about how it manages its files.  The filename just sounded like it would be something along the lines of a cache of usernames you've used when authenticating with various hostnames.  I could be totally wrong.  But, in any case, it doesn't sound like anything critical.  I could even see an argument for _excluding_ it on purpose for security reasons.  Feels weak to me, but I could see it.\n\nAnyway, pure speculation on my part.  If/when I come across anything definite about this file I'll either open a new ticket or send a pull request your way.\n\nFor the issue I reported here, I think we're good now.  Feel free to close away!\n\nThanks!\n. I cleaned up this pull request significantly.  Here is what I did:\n- I merged all the commits related to the new feature I added that adds support for custom app definitions via .mackup.cfg\n- I removed the single commit which added README entires for all of the apps I added and, instead, appended each of the respective commits with the appropriate README entry.\n- I moved the support for Terminal out of this pull request since I have since seen that you have previously considered it and decided against it due to syncing issues.\n\nThe net effect here is that you should be able to (if you like) simply cherry-pick whichever pieces of this pull request you want to include.  Also, I hope, it is easier to tell what I was doing and easier to test as well.\n\nWith all that in mind, I humbly suggest that the prior merge you did from my (old) master into your new branch \"dbingham-master\" can simply be discarded.  This version has the benefit of not only being cleaned up, but also of being rebased on top of your current master (as of the time of this writing).\n\nI apologize for all the history rewriting, but since you only pulled into a discardable branch, I hope that any difficulty around that is mitigated and that you find this version much easier to work with.\n. Fair enough. I can make a separate branch for each commit if desired. Just seemed to me like a lot of merging work for no reason if the maintainer wanted to pull it in. Alternatively, as I mentioned in my previous comment, each commit is now entirely self contained, so a cherry-pick of only the parts he wants to use should be pretty trivial.\n\nIra, if you want me to split this up, just let me know.\n\nDaniel\n. I'm perfectly able and happy to split this up if Ira so desires. But he hasn't chimed in, so I haven't changed anything yet. \n\nSomeone else contacted me a while back saying that they thought this project had been abandoned and they were continuing in a fork. That maintainer already pulled in all of my stuff.  I'll try to find the project and post with the info later today.\n. I never thought Mackup was abandoned. Just reporting on the email I got. But can't find the email now so I'll take your word for the link.\n\nSo, Ira, you want me to split this up into separate pull requests by commit? Or you have another implementation in mind and don't want to use this? I'm genuinely happy with either.\n\nDaniel\n. ```\n$ ls -al /Users/dbingham/Library/Application\\ Support/SourceTree/\ntotal 48\ndrwxr-xr-x    9 dbingham  staff   306 Apr  2 12:35 ./\ndrwx------+ 106 dbingham  staff  3604 Apr 29 09:17 ../\ndrwxr-xr-x    3 dbingham  staff   102 Nov  9  2011 MASReceipt/\ndrwxr-xr-x    8 dbingham  staff   272 Apr  2 11:17 SourceTree 1.5.8/\n-rw-r--r--    1 dbingham  staff  5361 Apr  2 12:35 browser.plist\n-rw-r--r--@   1 dbingham  staff   812 Apr  2 11:59 hgrc_sourcetree\n-rw-r--r--    1 dbingham  staff   366 Mar 18 09:45 hostusernamemap\n-rw-r--r--    1 dbingham  staff   236 Apr  2 12:35 openWindowList\n-rw-r--r--@   1 dbingham  staff   568 Feb 27  2012 sourcetree.license\n```\n\nand\n\n```\n$ ls -al \"Dropbox/Mackup/Library/Application Support/SourceTree/\"\ntotal 8\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 dbingham  staff  102 Apr 29 09:17 ./\ndrwxr-xr-x  6 dbingham  staff  204 Apr 29 09:17 ../\n-rw-------  1 dbingham  staff  568 Apr 29 09:17 sourcetree.license\n```\n. ```\ndbingham-itko:mackup(fix_sourcetree) dbingham$ ./mackup.py backup\nBacking up Library/Application Support/SourceTree/sourcetree.license...\nA file named /Users/dbingham/Dropbox/Mackup/Library/Application Support/SourceTree/sourcetree.license already exists in the backup.\nAre you sure that your want to replace it ? <Yes|No>Yes\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"./mackup.py\", line 734, in <module>\n    main()\n  File \"./mackup.py\", line 687, in main\n    app.backup()\n  File \"./mackup.py\", line 304, in backup\n    delete(filepath)\n  File \"./mackup.py\", line 493, in delete\n    os.remove(filepath)\nOSError: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted: '/Users/dbingham/Library/Application Support/SourceTree/sourcetree.license'\n```\n.

Yeah, it works.  But it messes with permissions in a way I wouldn't expect.  I would expect permissions to be preserved as much as possible.  For example:\n\nBefore (I put things back as close as possible to the original state):\n\n```\ndbingham-itko:SourceTree dbingham$ ls -lO@\ntotal 48\ndrw-r--r--  3 dbingham  staff  -     102 Nov  9  2011 MASReceipt/\ndrw-r--r--  8 dbingham  staff  -     272 Apr  2 11:17 SourceTree 1.5.8/\n-rw-r--r--  1 dbingham  staff  -    5361 Apr 30 11:37 browser.plist\n-rw-r--r--@ 1 dbingham  staff  -     812 Apr 30 11:37 hgrc_sourcetree\n    com.apple.TextEncoding    15 \n-rw-r--r--  1 dbingham  staff  -     366 Mar 18 09:45 hostusernamemap\n-rw-r--r--  1 dbingham  staff  -     236 Apr  2 12:35 openWindowList\n-rw-r--r--@ 1 dbingham  staff  uchg  568 Apr 30 11:37 sourcetree.license\n    com.apple.metadata:com_apple_backup_excludeItem   17 \n```\n\nAnd the files in the Mackup directory on Dropbox after a `backup`:\n\n```\ndbingham-itko:SourceTree dbingham$ ls -lO@\ntotal 32\n-rw-------  1 dbingham  staff  - 5361 Apr 30 11:49 browser.plist\n-rw-------  1 dbingham  staff  -  812 Apr 30 11:49 hgrc_sourcetree\n-rw-------  1 dbingham  staff  -  568 Apr 30 11:49 sourcetree.license\n```\n\nSo, I expected the `uchg` flag to be gone, but didn't expect the xattrs to be gone and the permissions to change from 644 to 600.\n\nIs that a limitation of Dropbox?\n. Also, while I'm thinking about it, is `hostusernamemap` not something we'd want to keep around?  The name sounds like something that would be fairly useful.\n. On the permissions changes, I doubt it'll matter for the vast majority of stuff.  Maybe someday you'll run across an application that just has to have its xattrs 'just so' in order to work.  But until then, I say, go with what you've got.  It makes things \"cleaner\" anyway.\n\nI _use_ SourceTree, but I don't know much about how it manages its files.  The filename just sounded like it would be something along the lines of a cache of usernames you've used when authenticating with various hostnames.  I could be totally wrong.  But, in any case, it doesn't sound like anything critical.  I could even see an argument for _excluding_ it on purpose for security reasons.  Feels weak to me, but I could see it.\n\nAnyway, pure speculation on my part.  If/when I come across anything definite about this file I'll either open a new ticket or send a pull request your way.\n\nFor the issue I reported here, I think we're good now.  Feel free to close away!\n\nThanks!\n. I cleaned up this pull request significantly.  Here is what I did:\n- I merged all the commits related to the new feature I added that adds support for custom app definitions via .mackup.cfg\n- I removed the single commit which added README entires for all of the apps I added and, instead, appended each of the respective commits with the appropriate README entry.\n- I moved the support for Terminal out of this pull request since I have since seen that you have previously considered it and decided against it due to syncing issues.\n\nThe net effect here is that you should be able to (if you like) simply cherry-pick whichever pieces of this pull request you want to include.  Also, I hope, it is easier to tell what I was doing and easier to test as well.\n\nWith all that in mind, I humbly suggest that the prior merge you did from my (old) master into your new branch \"dbingham-master\" can simply be discarded.  This version has the benefit of not only being cleaned up, but also of being rebased on top of your current master (as of the time of this writing).\n\nI apologize for all the history rewriting, but since you only pulled into a discardable branch, I hope that any difficulty around that is mitigated and that you find this version much easier to work with.\n. Fair enough. I can make a separate branch for each commit if desired. Just seemed to me like a lot of merging work for no reason if the maintainer wanted to pull it in. Alternatively, as I mentioned in my previous comment, each commit is now entirely self contained, so a cherry-pick of only the parts he wants to use should be pretty trivial.\n\nIra, if you want me to split this up, just let me know.\n\nDaniel\n. I'm perfectly able and happy to split this up if Ira so desires. But he hasn't chimed in, so I haven't changed anything yet. \n\nSomeone else contacted me a while back saying that they thought this project had been abandoned and they were continuing in a fork. That maintainer already pulled in all of my stuff.  I'll try to find the project and post with the info later today.\n. I never thought Mackup was abandoned. Just reporting on the email I got. But can't find the email now so I'll take your word for the link.\n\nSo, Ira, you want me to split this up into separate pull requests by commit? Or you have another implementation in mind and don't want to use this? I'm genuinely happy with either.\n\nDaniel\n. ",

    "vitorgalvao": "I\u2019ve [discussed this](https://twitter.com/vhgalvao/status/436563905885007872) with @lra [on twitter](https://twitter.com/vhgalvao/status/436563939389095938), briefly. For those of you that only want to sync font files that can be freely distributed, maybe give [homebrew-cask](https://github.com/phinze/homebrew-cask) a look; the [fonts tap](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-fonts) in particular. It may not sync them, but will give you a way to install them quickly.\n\nFunctionality to copy instead of linking in _mackup_ is being [discussed](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/154) anyway, so in theory that could later be applied to this case.\n. Also, when you sync with chrome it does not bring over any preferences form the extensions you have installed, so this could work even better than their sync. I like the idea, I\u2019ll look into it.\n. The issue lies with sandboxed apps, and not Sparrow alone. I tought of a possible solution for consideration, [outlined in this pull request](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/154).\n. > What if you're not syncing with dropbox?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be dropbox. You can pick whatever you like, for Alfred. It also has standard directories that could be used in mackup.\n\nAlfred\u2019s \u201cdad\u201d is @preppeller on github and Alfred\u2019s \u201cmom\u201d is [@vero](https://twitter.com/vero) on twitter. They\u2019re also both very responsive on the forums.\n. > Don't contribute an application that already provide a way to sync its config. e.g. Google Chrome or Alfred (paid version)\n\nI can certainly see the case for not doing it in Alfred\u2019s case, since they provide that functionality as part of their paid offering. However, [as discussed before](https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/153), in Chrome\u2019s case this would actually be a superior alternative to their system.\n. > Add yourself to the changelog next time\n\nWill do. Thank you.\n. Wouldn\u2019t the need for this be negated by your other pull request (#148)?\n\nOn another note, I think it\u2019d be more intuitive to call it `Mackup Directory Name` instead of `Mackup Folder Name`, considering the target for _mackup_ is (arguably) developers, or at least people with a good understanding of how to use their own OS.\n. > Merging, thx, same: changelog should be added in the WIP\n\nAh, sorry, will do that in the future.\n. As stated in #37, \u201cwhen you sync with chrome it does not bring over any preferences form the extensions you have installed\u201d, so you do not actually have _everything_ in sync. This would do it. Another strong reason is, like @nZac stated, \u201cthis could be helpful if you don't want Google to own your data\u201d. Syncing it this way is then superior in both configuration and privacy terms (and it also opens this option for people that use Chrome but do not have a Google account).\n\nI\u2019d argue that users have no reason to sync Chrome with both `mackup` and Google\u2019s system, and `mackup` does allow you control what is synced and what is not. Maybe this could be added as \u201cdo not sync unless specifically told to\u201d, like (arguably) [ssh should be](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/109).\n. I\u2019m not sure it _would_ break existing configurations (it _could_, tough, so some testing is needed on this).\n\nI think you can actually sync preferences from extensions, but each extension must specify that (not sure, but I seem to remember reading something to that effect), which means it\u2019s essentially useless, unless the developer does it, which is (as I see it) the exact use case for `mackup` (after all, if every developer provided a syncing option, you wouldn\u2019t have needed to build this tool in the first place).\n. Updated to reflect the new way _mackup_ is structured.\n. Doing some tests on this, this isn\u2019t a good candidate for backup. If we\u2019re too broad directories get huge (several GBs) and if we\u2019re too narrow we won\u2019t backup enough.\n. The same one [you\u2019ve experienced with sparrow](https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/43#issuecomment-17855099). Maybe it happens only when we try to sync entire directories, and not for singular files. I\u2019ll have to perform some tests on this.\n. Yep, from my limited testing right now, ([sip](http://theolabrothers.com/sip/), where only one file needs to be linked, and [sketch](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/), where we need to link one file and a directory), it seems like linking directories inside containers is the only case where it causes problems (in sketch\u2019s case you lose important settings, like the customisation of your toolbar).\n. Seems to be the case, yes. Linking `~/Library/Cotainers/com.ruiaureliano.Sip/Data/Library/Preferences/com.ruiaureliano.Sip.plist` works for sip, but linking `~/Library/Cotainers/com.bohemiancoding.sketch/Data/Library/Preferences/com.bohemiancoding.sketch.plist` and `~/Library/Cotainers/com.bohemiancoding.sketch/Data/Library/Application Support/sketch` does not work for sketch.\n\nLinking individual files would not be a long-term solution, however, as in some cases whole directories do have to be copied over. In sketch, for instance, inside that linked directory is where user plugins reside, and those will be different depending on the user.\n. New development. It seems that this can break or not on a case-by-case basis, so we should probably just get a solution that\u2019ll act on files inside `Containers`, and settle on that, for those cases. [Readkit](https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/210), while only needing two files to maintain it\u2019s settings, will break if the one inside `Application Support` is a symlink. Also, other apps (like `Sip`, mentioned previously), seem to no longer work with symlinks, after running new tests. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s different, but we shouldn\u2019t rely on something that might-or-not work, and find a more permanent solution.\n. I agree that using _cron_ (or _launchd_, even), is not an optimal solution, and should really be avoided.\n\nThe issue here seems to be how to convey to the user that some apps will have limited backup capabilities, so it is clear that those will need a bit more care to be kept up to date.\n\nI don\u2019t have a solution to this, but maybe the start of a suggestion. Since applications will essentially be divided into two groups (\u201calways in sync\u201d and \u201csync on demand\u201d), maybe actually splitting them could help make that distinction (I\u2019m thinking something to the effect of how _homebrew_ uses _taps_). This way there would be an \u201copt-in\u201d to these apps, making users aware of the _why_ of this limitation.\n\nAnother option would be to only sync apps specified in the `.mackup.cfg` file, effectively forcing users to set it up, and be conscious about the limitations of certain cases (maybe apps would have to be organised under different sections of the file).\n\nBoth this options have the particularity of not making users worry about \u201cis this app automatically synced, or do I have to do it myself regularly?\u201d, since they\u2019d be made aware of that when setting up, but they do come with the burden of requiring a bit extra work when initially setting up. I believe that initial hurdle to be more advantageous than having users puzzled about why some backups \u201cjust work\u201d, while others do not.\n\nThese solutions would change _mackup_\u2019s design philosophy a bit, true, but right now it is a choice between being more convenient and being more complete.\n. I actually very much like that solution. Having `mackup status` work in such a way would allow _mackup_ to function as usual, and would give a user the tools to understand the limitations of some cases right from the app. I\u2019m all for it.\n. Sounds good, but shouldn\u2019t option 2 be the last one? If there\u2019s some change that needs to be done to the `copy` sync method (something we\u2019re not foreseeing now that\u2019ll only be apparent during implementation), `status` can be rethought to accommodate that. That would be more efficient than having to change `status` after it has been implemented, in case some problem does occur.\n. I was imagining them as being more independent. 3 and 4 can exist without 2 (the limitations just won\u2019t be as clear), and vice-versa. I was thinking of 3 and 4 first since some complications might occur that will change the design of the feature, while 2, being an option that will complement that, could adapt itself to how it turns out, instead of having to change later in case the feature does end up having to be rethought.\n\nHowever, you know the tool better, and the sequence of implementation shouldn\u2019t make that big of difference, so I trust the way you find to be more efficient.\n. > looks like Apple has moded GNU tools\n\nThat wouldn\u2019t be very productive. I think they simply use the BSD versions (since OS X is based on it).\n. These files pertain to users that bought 1Password directly from Agile, and not from the Mac App Store. This might pose a problem, since if [support for MAS apps](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/154) is ever added, there might very well be conflicts.\n\nLike with [Google Chrome](https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/153), the default sync is incomplete (what 1Password syncs is the keychain, not the settings).\n. Do you really want to cripple _mackup_ this much? I\u2019ll mention [copying](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/195) once more, as it likely is the workaround for this. I understand that was [not your original goal](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/195#issuecomment-33308167), but there are multiple [cases](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/154) where linking is simply the inferior option.\n\nI think you\u2019re wrong in saying\n\n> If an app cache some conf, too bad for the app\n\nI\u2019d argue no user (or close to it) will stop using an app they like/need because it can\u2019t be used with _mackup_. The reverse can easily happen, though.\n\nAgain, I understand your goal with this app is for it to always keep settings in sync with no extra effort, but all the situations it doesn\u2019t work on and require workarounds demand even more effort. Now, with the idea of a blacklist, it\u2019s even making _mackup_ itself less useful.\n. @idolize I argue that\u2019d simply be skirting around the issue. You\u2019re talking about implementing a recurring command to go around a limitation. Doing that, why not (as stated in my previous comment) simply follow the copy-settings route, anyway? That solves more issues, allows more features without extra work, and the implications would be the same.\n. Should\u2019ve been more clear, apologies. I was encompassing [@Cottser idea](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/195#issuecomment-33195400) in that issue, of scripting `defaults`. That wouldn\u2019t be enough on its own, though, since it wouldn\u2019t work for every app (which is where copying comes in).\n\nMy point is that trying to keep everything in sync by linking files is breaking, and revealing itself to be a suboptimal solution. Performing the tasks on a \u201cby-call\u201d basis would solve most problems, and create a single one \u2014 not being always in sync without extra work. However, when talking about using `launchd` to run a command periodically, then the argument goes out the window \u2014 if that\u2019d be needed to make linking work correctly, why not go all out with the alternative?\n. > I see, so you're proposing a one-off `sync` command to copy/merge settings changes, but also run `defaults` to fix both the Mavericks and App Store issues in one go?\n\nYes.\n\n> (don't aliases fix the App Store issue?)\n\nI\u2019m trying to remember, but I\u2019m not sure, I\u2019d have to test again. I do remember finding [no reliable way](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/154#issuecomment-33892622), in my tests, but I do not remember if file aliases were considered in that comment. I [considered them initially](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/154#issue-24194210), though.\n\nI was under the idea (but didn\u2019t find the issue in my quick search, at the time), that checking for file changes had already been discussed and [decided against](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/154#issuecomment-33915880). That was the start of the discussion and search for solutions, though; it was framed as an option to avoid, not to exclude. What I stated in response to your point was not that `launchd` should not be used, but that were it to be used we should consider the alternative solution, as it solves the present problems and introduces only one, that would be rendered irrelevant by the use of `launchd`.\n. It would also be useful in cases [like this](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/196). What `mackup` decides to sync may not always be the best option, and when encountering these situations it would be way easier to make a personal fix, before contributing it to the project (where it\u2019ll be a pain to everyone that has already synced those preferences incorrectly).\n. > Also, without linking, if you forget to update one file, and you update the same file differently on another computer, you got a conflict.\n\nYou don\u2019t, because the latest save will always trump the one before; we may have the trouble of losing some previous settings if we did not sync before (which is a bothersome one), but conflicts of files will not happen. On the other hand, conflicts happen now, and they\u2019re harder to solve. As I mentioned before, when having more than one computer logged on at the same time, `mackup` frequently gets confused and we end up with a lot of versions of different conflicts on Dropbox.\n\n> But that's something worth considering as the field of conf files gets harder in the future, because of app store containers for example.\n\nThat\u2019s my biggest point in this. When it\u2019s a choice by using an app that takes a little extra work from time to time but does the job, and one that needs no intervention (except on errors, and those are arguably more probable and harder to fix) but does not do all the job, I believe, in this particular situation, that not having the frustration of having to care about those few configurations that it doesn\u2019t handle, to be a superior offering.\n\nIn one option, if we don\u2019t sync everything it\u2019s our fault (we forgot), and we can always mitigate that (by setting up a regular script, maybe even directly on the terminal\u2019s startup files). On the other, if we don\u2019t fix everything, it\u2019s the software\u2019s fault, and this to me looks like a worse option \u2014 software is supposed to care for the best solutions. The former demands just a bit more, but can do everything, while the latter, while needing less work to setup, is also more limited. When building an app that deals with the peculiarities of all the other apps, and that will be so differently configured depending on the user, power trumps convenience.\n. Fair enough, maybe I should\u2019ve used \u201cI\u201d, but @Cottser\u2019s comment and the linked issues seem to suggest that the proposed solution would not affect only me. Furthermore, I want us to be in each other\u2019s shoes to accurately evaluate if this is something we might reach a consensus on. Using \u201cwe\u201d (for how it currently works) and \u201cI\u201d (for how I\u2019m envisioning it) to refer to each case, would cause a divide in communication, making it harder to imagine the functionality. The fact that you\u2019ve reopened the issue hopefully means some of it rang right and you\u2019ll give it further thought.\n\nNaturally, it is your tool and it is perfectly valid for my needs to be different from your goals, but that is exactly what I\u2019m trying to find. The second option would mean I\u2019d likely need to create my own tool, but if I (and the proponents for each option) can focus on helping to flourish efforts on an already established one (and one that I personally like, as well), so much the better for everyone.\n. Oh, I hadn\u2019t seen that (you must\u2019ve edited your comment after I\u2019ve opened the page, I only saw the \u201cWe\u201d comment).\n\nI agree that solution is the best of both, I was only suggesting the other approach for everything as that would mean the app would work the same across the board, instead of working in different ways for different apps. But if that would, as you mentioned, help with other cases, than it sounds like a good approach.\n. That doesn\u2019t seem like something _mackup_ could take care of. From your report, it seems that _tower_ is the one saving the location of your repos with a full path. If that\u2019s the case, there\u2019s not much _mackup_ can do. Your best bet would be to ask the _tower_ developers to use relative paths when possible.\n. I see your point. Yes, that\u2019s a reasonable concern, we hadn\u2019t touch on that possibility of cases in the conversation, thank you for pointing that out.\n. > > However, isn't backup/restore + uninstall = copy?\n> \n> Yes\n\nNot exactly, no. Copying allows [possibilities that are not available with linking](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/154), and are thus not available with backup/restore + uninstall. Were they same thing, this wouldn\u2019t be an issue.\n. It\u2019s not exactly their fault, it\u2019s due to Ember being a MAS-only app. See [this issue](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/154) for details.\n. Yes, I took the docs as the starting point, but decided to include the whole `.config/livestreamer` directory since it can have [plugins](http://livestreamer.tanuki.se/en/latest/cli.html#sideloading-plugins) installed there.\n. That should work, yes. My though was that fewer links are better than more, and since there won\u2019t be anything inside `.config/livestreamer` that is not related to the app, it\u2019d be more efficient to directly sync that.\n\nHowever, if you prefer to have those separate, I can edit the pull request. Should I?\n. Done.\n. Closing as part of personal cleanup of old pull requests and issues.

Mackup [doesn\u2019t support MAS apps](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/154) [because it relies on symlinking](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/195).\n\nThe project seems mostly abandoned feature-wise, so I somehow doubt it\u2019ll happen. At least not without a PR.\n. > not really abandoned, I just need people to contribute =)\n\nWell, like I said:\n\n> The project seems mostly abandoned feature-wise, so I somehow doubt it\u2019ll happen. **At least not without a PR**.\n\nSo, same thing. If none of the core maintainers (you alone, I believe) is working on adding features, then the project is indeed effectively abandoned feature-wise. Wishing people contribute is very different than having said contributions.\n. To be clear, I\u2019m not criticising you not adding features. It\u2019s your project, and as with the [multiple ssh issues](https://github.com/lra/mackup/search?q=ssh&type=Issues&utf8=%E2%9C%93), it seems to me you have it working perfectly well for your exact needs and hence have no further incentive to keep adding to or changing it, _which is totally valid_.\n\nThat said, that is not what you\u2019re saying. Issues are left to linger, and requests aren\u2019t refused or responded to with \u201cI won\u2019t do it, but will accept a contribution for it\u201d, so users rightly get the impression those things are indeed being taken into consideration and worked on, which is not the case.\n. Most of that was addressed in my previous comments. Quite frankly, I have little interest in continuing down this conversation since I always make a huge effort to be respectful in pointing out what I think is wrong here but am always faced with what feels like a defensive take and answers to points I never made.\n\nMy take on it is (I believe) very clear: it is perfectly OK for you to not work on the project and everything that is asked, but you don\u2019t say it. Issues are left open, _including_ **_numerous**_ _duplicates_ without reply or acknowledgement for a long time (if ever). I\u2019m certain there are capable users that would take on the work of submitting PRs for what is needed, _but if you don\u2019t participate (or better yet, lead) in the discussion of what you believe should be included_ **_and how to implement it**_ _why would anyone else_?\n\nPRs won\u2019t happen simply because there\u2019s a TODO. Contributors need to feel their ideas will be at the very least considered (even if immediately refused) and that there is a point to spending time on them. If you don\u2019t participate, they never do, and move on.\n. I appreciate the offer, but I honestly do not think I\u2019d be a good candidate for that as I stopped using mackup, since syncing instead of copying broke too many things for me. For that reason I don\u2019t check back as often, and you\u2019d be back at square one.\n\nI\u2019m still up for helping with unifying the configs into a common repo/format, as we\u2019ve talked about other times, though.\n\nI do however recommend that when you engage with the issues, keep and eye out for a user that frequently participates, and \u201cpromote\u201d that one to that position. Many times giving people the extra responsibility makes them work even more to earn it (in homebrew-cask we have examples).\n. Closing as part of personal cleanup of old pull requests and issues. There\u2019s no fix in sight (which is fine) and I have long stopped using mackup, so no point in keeping it open. #615 as links to all these, so they won\u2019t be lost.\r\n\r\nPlease do let me know if you need something from these.. Actually, Fontcase is dead. It has been discontinued for a while.\n. The discussion about this is already going on in _homebrew-cask_ in [this issue](https://github.com/phinze/homebrew-cask/issues/1135), so feel free to comment there, @yangm97.\n. The problem then arises of when to remove the `obsolete_configuration_files` directive \u2014 how long is long enough to have it there?\n\nPicking up from @aristidesfl\u2019s idea, perhaps _mackup_ could check against the files/directories backed up (whatever their location might be) and the ones listed in the configuration. If a discrepancy is found (including a configuration file being missing, for its support having been dropped), act accordingly.\n. @commadelimited If you edit the file yourself in your local install, it should work fine. You do not need to wait for it to be officially done.\n. I\u2019m not sure if in this case it\u2019ll break, or it\u2019ll just be overwritten (which would be fine). I seem to remember @lra mentioning this relatively recent system of conf files would work well with user-additions. I might be misremembering, though.\n. Why are you removing previous locations? [Textual is open source](https://github.com/Codeux/Textual/), and you don\u2019t need to install it from the AppStore. By removing those locations, you\u2019re essentially breaking this for people who built Textual themselves.\n. Since it seems to be working, sure.\n. This is misleading. Not everyone follows the same non-standard way of organisation, and it\u2019d be wrong for _mackup_ to impose one on every user. Cases like this should use [standard files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29#Execution_order_of_startup_files), and nothing else. If a user has custom needs, it\u2019s easy to edit _mackup_\u2019s configuration files for personal needs.\n. [Instructions](https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#add-support-for-an-application-or-any-file-or-directory).\n. [Documentation on this](https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#applications).\n. [In the documentation](https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/doc/README.md#google-drive).\n. Mackup only has in [messages.cfg](https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup/applications/messages.cfg) one file exactly named `com.apple.iChat.plist`, which is the one in `~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iChat.plist`.\n. Why not just remove that extra file, and see if the remaining ones cause any trouble? Will send a PR with that in mind.\n. > If we took the main .plist file, there's no reason of having the others.\n\nWhy not? They still contain preferences.\n\n> It's also something that you set up immediately after firing up a Mac and never change;\n\nSo are most preferences for most apps. I\u2019d say _mackup_\u2019s goal is to save that trouble whenever possible.\n\nThat said, I don\u2019t personally care that much about Messages. I do believe it\u2019d be worthwhile to find the best way to make it work, though.\n. @maxnordlund You can [tell mackup to not sync certain things](https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#dont-sync-an-application).\n. Duplicate of https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/195.\n\nAs you can read there, this isn\u2019t very likely to happen in mackup.\n. Just look at [mackup\u2019s ssh config file](https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/b239d6c7613f7770504d3760bd6b5e6879554d26/mackup/applications/ssh.cfg). There are [many open issues](https://github.com/lra/mackup/search?q=ssh&type=Issues&utf8=%E2%9C%93) about [that insecurity](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/336), and it [seems likely it\u2019ll remain that way](https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/352#issuecomment-58059368) (although the issues are still open).\n\nNot, it is not safe to put your mackup syncs in a public repo. At the very least you should be concerned about your software keys for purchased apps.\n. What 1Password syncs over dropbox (or other) is your passwords/notes/other. What this submission is asking to sync are its preferences.\n. There are some conflicts that need to be resolved. You may have updated an older version of some of the files.\n. [You need to create it yourself](https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#only-sync-one-or-two-application).\n. I believe Mackup\u2019s stance on Alfred to be as (more, actually) ridiculous as [it\u2019s stance with Google Chrome](https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/153). Subverting it is so easy (and even allowed, by its structure), there\u2019s really no point in preventing it\u2019s inclusion in the main repo. Syncing them in this manner also brings clear benefits over the way said apps do it, which makes it a valuable addition _even to those who paid for it_.\n\nNo one will not buy Alfred because they can sync their configurations some other way. If you\u2019re buying it solely for syncing preferences you\u2019re throwing your money away anyway; its main selling point is workflows \u2014 everything else is just a nice addition.\n. This isn\u2019t a mackup problem, but a homebrew problem. You should [open an issue there](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/new).\n. ``` bash\n$ brew info mackup\nmackup: stable 0.7.4, HEAD\nhttps://github.com/lra/mackup\n/usr/local/Cellar/mackup/0.7.4 (214 files, 948K) *\n  Built from source\nFrom: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/mackup.rb\n```\n\nLike I said, you should open an issue on homebrew\u2019s repo. It\u2019s a problem on your end, regarding homebrew, not mackup. You can try `brew install https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/mackup.rb`, but otherwise you are asking on the wrong repo.\n. I don\u2019t use Messages scripts and am not sure how prevalent they are in user\u2019s machines. A single script causing errors also doesn\u2019t mean much; maybe it is the least popular and only Messages script in existence that causes the problem, so it wouldn\u2019t make much sense to \u201cpunish\u201d all the others for it.\n\nSome context would be appreciated, @morphinewan. I can\u2019t read that message and will venture a guess that @lra can\u2019t either. We can\u2019t even be sure it\u2019s an error being caused by Messages \u2014 the only thing I see is a box with some text I can\u2019t comprehend, with the Finder\u2019s icon and a reference to Message\u2019s bundle ID. Being a screenshot also means we can\u2019t even copy the text to translate with a piece of software. What does the error say, exactly? And which script is it, where did you get it from?\n. Ah, it\u2019s clear now, thank you for the explanation. Seems like the issue is only with linking, so the directory could be [synced with copying](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/195) only.\n. Seems like it, yes. I linked to the copying issue because you mentioned [copying could be done in the apps that needed](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/195#issuecomment-33308596). Alternatively this could be commented out, and if copying becomes something not app-specific but a setting inside the `.cfg` files themselves, it could be leveraged then.\n. Honestly, for these types of configurations, I think syncing is a mistake. Not only is it error prone, it\u2019s an insane amount of work. Instead, [set whatever you want in a script and run it when needed](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/dotfiles/blob/27353c7d2c8b904954b16d59b9cab8b9e36a1fc3/scripts/03_configs.sh#L21-L40).\r\n\r\nJust like with something like Atom, syncing the directory with the actual plugins can also lead to issues and is also a mistake, that\u2019s what `apm` is for. Syncing should be the last resort, the first being to automate the app\u2019s commands.\r\n. [Know issue](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/154). Mackup can\u2019t handle those, [because it relies on symlinking](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/195).\n. Yes, if the option for app bundles is added, [as discussed](https://twitter.com/vhgalvao/status/511467067611287553). Something like [`atom`](https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/902e2eda610403e393a24960efee57ac41d202c6/mackup/applications/atom.cfg) would end up like\n\n``` cfg\n[application]\nname = Atom\nid = com.github.atom\n\n[configuration_files]\nLibrary/Preferences/com.github.atom.plist\n.atom/config.cson\n.atom/init.coffee\n.atom/keymap.cson\n.atom/keymaps\n.atom/snippets.cson\n.atom/styles.less\n```\n. To be clear, I\u2019m talking exclusively about adding that line to the INI files and not at all about adding the feature to mackup.\n\nI very much understand your desire to keep mackup sync-only, but if I or anyone else wants to create a tool that is centred on copying, having the bundle identifier to overcome that limitation in mackup is useful.\n\nMy argument here is not that mackup must support bundle identifiers, but that this central repo we\u2019re talking about, to be useful for other projects, should include it.\n. This has been repeated [time](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/336) and [time](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/109) again. There\u2019s at least one more issue about this. @lra has also stated that syncing his ssh keys is part of the reason he started mackup in the first place, so this is unlikely to change.\n\nWhy these issues are still open, I have no idea.\n.

For MAS apps, it\u2019ll likely also need to `defaults read` preferences to a file and restore them with `defaults write`. This is why I\u2019ve been mentioning storing bundle IDs.\n. @lra To be fair, it doesn\u2019t really explain it. It says `mackup` does `ln`. If you don\u2019t know what `ln` is (and why would you, if you just want to backup your configurations) you don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. It\u2019s also the third point in a list of technical details (which a user won\u2019t read if, again, all they want to do is backup configurations).\n\nThe only time `link` is even referenced in the README is in the word \u201clinked\u201d, [five paragraphs into a long explanation most people won\u2019t care about](https://github.com/lra/mackup#why-did-you-do-this) that says what you _used_ to do (i.e. it doesn\u2019t even mean that\u2019s what `mackup` does).\n. https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/212.\n. > Any chance that this pull request is getting merged any time soon to add support for CopyQ and Rhythmbox?\n\nTis can\u2019t be merged because there are merge conflicts.\n.

Some people have multiple and name them different things. Hence why the whole directory makes more sense.. > I think a good approach would be to let the user decide which apps he want's to 'Mackup'.\r\n\r\n[You can](https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/doc/README.md#only-sync-one-or-two-application).. You\u2019re using the Mac App Store version of Fantastical. Mackup can\u2019t deal with Mac App Store apps.. #20, #116,  #127, #405, #417, #813.. I\u2019ve [discussed this](https://twitter.com/vhgalvao/status/436563905885007872) with @lra [on twitter](https://twitter.com/vhgalvao/status/436563939389095938), briefly. For those of you that only want to sync font files that can be freely distributed, maybe give [homebrew-cask](https://github.com/phinze/homebrew-cask) a look; the [fonts tap](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-fonts) in particular. It may not sync them, but will give you a way to install them quickly.\n\nFunctionality to copy instead of linking in _mackup_ is being [discussed](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/154) anyway, so in theory that could later be applied to this case.\n. Also, when you sync with chrome it does not bring over any preferences form the extensions you have installed, so this could work even better than their sync. I like the idea, I\u2019ll look into it.\n. The issue lies with sandboxed apps, and not Sparrow alone. I tought of a possible solution for consideration, [outlined in this pull request](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/154).\n. > What if you're not syncing with dropbox?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be dropbox. You can pick whatever you like, for Alfred. It also has standard directories that could be used in mackup.\n\nAlfred\u2019s \u201cdad\u201d is @preppeller on github and Alfred\u2019s \u201cmom\u201d is [@vero](https://twitter.com/vero) on twitter. They\u2019re also both very responsive on the forums.\n. > Don't contribute an application that already provide a way to sync its config. e.g. Google Chrome or Alfred (paid version)\n\nI can certainly see the case for not doing it in Alfred\u2019s case, since they provide that functionality as part of their paid offering. However, [as discussed before](https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/153), in Chrome\u2019s case this would actually be a superior alternative to their system.\n. > Add yourself to the changelog next time\n\nWill do. Thank you.\n. Wouldn\u2019t the need for this be negated by your other pull request (#148)?\n\nOn another note, I think it\u2019d be more intuitive to call it `Mackup Directory Name` instead of `Mackup Folder Name`, considering the target for _mackup_ is (arguably) developers, or at least people with a good understanding of how to use their own OS.\n. > Merging, thx, same: changelog should be added in the WIP\n\nAh, sorry, will do that in the future.\n. As stated in #37, \u201cwhen you sync with chrome it does not bring over any preferences form the extensions you have installed\u201d, so you do not actually have _everything_ in sync. This would do it. Another strong reason is, like @nZac stated, \u201cthis could be helpful if you don't want Google to own your data\u201d. Syncing it this way is then superior in both configuration and privacy terms (and it also opens this option for people that use Chrome but do not have a Google account).\n\nI\u2019d argue that users have no reason to sync Chrome with both `mackup` and Google\u2019s system, and `mackup` does allow you control what is synced and what is not. Maybe this could be added as \u201cdo not sync unless specifically told to\u201d, like (arguably) [ssh should be](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/109).\n. I\u2019m not sure it _would_ break existing configurations (it _could_, tough, so some testing is needed on this).\n\nI think you can actually sync preferences from extensions, but each extension must specify that (not sure, but I seem to remember reading something to that effect), which means it\u2019s essentially useless, unless the developer does it, which is (as I see it) the exact use case for `mackup` (after all, if every developer provided a syncing option, you wouldn\u2019t have needed to build this tool in the first place).\n. Updated to reflect the new way _mackup_ is structured.\n. Doing some tests on this, this isn\u2019t a good candidate for backup. If we\u2019re too broad directories get huge (several GBs) and if we\u2019re too narrow we won\u2019t backup enough.\n. The same one [you\u2019ve experienced with sparrow](https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/43#issuecomment-17855099). Maybe it happens only when we try to sync entire directories, and not for singular files. I\u2019ll have to perform some tests on this.\n. Yep, from my limited testing right now, ([sip](http://theolabrothers.com/sip/), where only one file needs to be linked, and [sketch](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/), where we need to link one file and a directory), it seems like linking directories inside containers is the only case where it causes problems (in sketch\u2019s case you lose important settings, like the customisation of your toolbar).\n. Seems to be the case, yes. Linking `~/Library/Cotainers/com.ruiaureliano.Sip/Data/Library/Preferences/com.ruiaureliano.Sip.plist` works for sip, but linking `~/Library/Cotainers/com.bohemiancoding.sketch/Data/Library/Preferences/com.bohemiancoding.sketch.plist` and `~/Library/Cotainers/com.bohemiancoding.sketch/Data/Library/Application Support/sketch` does not work for sketch.\n\nLinking individual files would not be a long-term solution, however, as in some cases whole directories do have to be copied over. In sketch, for instance, inside that linked directory is where user plugins reside, and those will be different depending on the user.\n. New development. It seems that this can break or not on a case-by-case basis, so we should probably just get a solution that\u2019ll act on files inside `Containers`, and settle on that, for those cases. [Readkit](https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/210), while only needing two files to maintain it\u2019s settings, will break if the one inside `Application Support` is a symlink. Also, other apps (like `Sip`, mentioned previously), seem to no longer work with symlinks, after running new tests. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s different, but we shouldn\u2019t rely on something that might-or-not work, and find a more permanent solution.\n. I agree that using _cron_ (or _launchd_, even), is not an optimal solution, and should really be avoided.\n\nThe issue here seems to be how to convey to the user that some apps will have limited backup capabilities, so it is clear that those will need a bit more care to be kept up to date.\n\nI don\u2019t have a solution to this, but maybe the start of a suggestion. Since applications will essentially be divided into two groups (\u201calways in sync\u201d and \u201csync on demand\u201d), maybe actually splitting them could help make that distinction (I\u2019m thinking something to the effect of how _homebrew_ uses _taps_). This way there would be an \u201copt-in\u201d to these apps, making users aware of the _why_ of this limitation.\n\nAnother option would be to only sync apps specified in the `.mackup.cfg` file, effectively forcing users to set it up, and be conscious about the limitations of certain cases (maybe apps would have to be organised under different sections of the file).\n\nBoth this options have the particularity of not making users worry about \u201cis this app automatically synced, or do I have to do it myself regularly?\u201d, since they\u2019d be made aware of that when setting up, but they do come with the burden of requiring a bit extra work when initially setting up. I believe that initial hurdle to be more advantageous than having users puzzled about why some backups \u201cjust work\u201d, while others do not.\n\nThese solutions would change _mackup_\u2019s design philosophy a bit, true, but right now it is a choice between being more convenient and being more complete.\n. I actually very much like that solution. Having `mackup status` work in such a way would allow _mackup_ to function as usual, and would give a user the tools to understand the limitations of some cases right from the app. I\u2019m all for it.\n. Sounds good, but shouldn\u2019t option 2 be the last one? If there\u2019s some change that needs to be done to the `copy` sync method (something we\u2019re not foreseeing now that\u2019ll only be apparent during implementation), `status` can be rethought to accommodate that. That would be more efficient than having to change `status` after it has been implemented, in case some problem does occur.\n. I was imagining them as being more independent. 3 and 4 can exist without 2 (the limitations just won\u2019t be as clear), and vice-versa. I was thinking of 3 and 4 first since some complications might occur that will change the design of the feature, while 2, being an option that will complement that, could adapt itself to how it turns out, instead of having to change later in case the feature does end up having to be rethought.\n\nHowever, you know the tool better, and the sequence of implementation shouldn\u2019t make that big of difference, so I trust the way you find to be more efficient.\n. > looks like Apple has moded GNU tools\n\nThat wouldn\u2019t be very productive. I think they simply use the BSD versions (since OS X is based on it).\n. These files pertain to users that bought 1Password directly from Agile, and not from the Mac App Store. This might pose a problem, since if [support for MAS apps](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/154) is ever added, there might very well be conflicts.\n\nLike with [Google Chrome](https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/153), the default sync is incomplete (what 1Password syncs is the keychain, not the settings).\n. Do you really want to cripple _mackup_ this much? I\u2019ll mention [copying](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/195) once more, as it likely is the workaround for this. I understand that was [not your original goal](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/195#issuecomment-33308167), but there are multiple [cases](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/154) where linking is simply the inferior option.\n\nI think you\u2019re wrong in saying\n\n> If an app cache some conf, too bad for the app\n\nI\u2019d argue no user (or close to it) will stop using an app they like/need because it can\u2019t be used with _mackup_. The reverse can easily happen, though.\n\nAgain, I understand your goal with this app is for it to always keep settings in sync with no extra effort, but all the situations it doesn\u2019t work on and require workarounds demand even more effort. Now, with the idea of a blacklist, it\u2019s even making _mackup_ itself less useful.\n. @idolize I argue that\u2019d simply be skirting around the issue. You\u2019re talking about implementing a recurring command to go around a limitation. Doing that, why not (as stated in my previous comment) simply follow the copy-settings route, anyway? That solves more issues, allows more features without extra work, and the implications would be the same.\n. Should\u2019ve been more clear, apologies. I was encompassing [@Cottser idea](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/195#issuecomment-33195400) in that issue, of scripting `defaults`. That wouldn\u2019t be enough on its own, though, since it wouldn\u2019t work for every app (which is where copying comes in).\n\nMy point is that trying to keep everything in sync by linking files is breaking, and revealing itself to be a suboptimal solution. Performing the tasks on a \u201cby-call\u201d basis would solve most problems, and create a single one \u2014 not being always in sync without extra work. However, when talking about using `launchd` to run a command periodically, then the argument goes out the window \u2014 if that\u2019d be needed to make linking work correctly, why not go all out with the alternative?\n. > I see, so you're proposing a one-off `sync` command to copy/merge settings changes, but also run `defaults` to fix both the Mavericks and App Store issues in one go?\n\nYes.\n\n> (don't aliases fix the App Store issue?)\n\nI\u2019m trying to remember, but I\u2019m not sure, I\u2019d have to test again. I do remember finding [no reliable way](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/154#issuecomment-33892622), in my tests, but I do not remember if file aliases were considered in that comment. I [considered them initially](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/154#issue-24194210), though.\n\nI was under the idea (but didn\u2019t find the issue in my quick search, at the time), that checking for file changes had already been discussed and [decided against](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/154#issuecomment-33915880). That was the start of the discussion and search for solutions, though; it was framed as an option to avoid, not to exclude. What I stated in response to your point was not that `launchd` should not be used, but that were it to be used we should consider the alternative solution, as it solves the present problems and introduces only one, that would be rendered irrelevant by the use of `launchd`.\n. It would also be useful in cases [like this](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/196). What `mackup` decides to sync may not always be the best option, and when encountering these situations it would be way easier to make a personal fix, before contributing it to the project (where it\u2019ll be a pain to everyone that has already synced those preferences incorrectly).\n. > Also, without linking, if you forget to update one file, and you update the same file differently on another computer, you got a conflict.\n\nYou don\u2019t, because the latest save will always trump the one before; we may have the trouble of losing some previous settings if we did not sync before (which is a bothersome one), but conflicts of files will not happen. On the other hand, conflicts happen now, and they\u2019re harder to solve. As I mentioned before, when having more than one computer logged on at the same time, `mackup` frequently gets confused and we end up with a lot of versions of different conflicts on Dropbox.\n\n> But that's something worth considering as the field of conf files gets harder in the future, because of app store containers for example.\n\nThat\u2019s my biggest point in this. When it\u2019s a choice by using an app that takes a little extra work from time to time but does the job, and one that needs no intervention (except on errors, and those are arguably more probable and harder to fix) but does not do all the job, I believe, in this particular situation, that not having the frustration of having to care about those few configurations that it doesn\u2019t handle, to be a superior offering.\n\nIn one option, if we don\u2019t sync everything it\u2019s our fault (we forgot), and we can always mitigate that (by setting up a regular script, maybe even directly on the terminal\u2019s startup files). On the other, if we don\u2019t fix everything, it\u2019s the software\u2019s fault, and this to me looks like a worse option \u2014 software is supposed to care for the best solutions. The former demands just a bit more, but can do everything, while the latter, while needing less work to setup, is also more limited. When building an app that deals with the peculiarities of all the other apps, and that will be so differently configured depending on the user, power trumps convenience.\n. Fair enough, maybe I should\u2019ve used \u201cI\u201d, but @Cottser\u2019s comment and the linked issues seem to suggest that the proposed solution would not affect only me. Furthermore, I want us to be in each other\u2019s shoes to accurately evaluate if this is something we might reach a consensus on. Using \u201cwe\u201d (for how it currently works) and \u201cI\u201d (for how I\u2019m envisioning it) to refer to each case, would cause a divide in communication, making it harder to imagine the functionality. The fact that you\u2019ve reopened the issue hopefully means some of it rang right and you\u2019ll give it further thought.\n\nNaturally, it is your tool and it is perfectly valid for my needs to be different from your goals, but that is exactly what I\u2019m trying to find. The second option would mean I\u2019d likely need to create my own tool, but if I (and the proponents for each option) can focus on helping to flourish efforts on an already established one (and one that I personally like, as well), so much the better for everyone.\n. Oh, I hadn\u2019t seen that (you must\u2019ve edited your comment after I\u2019ve opened the page, I only saw the \u201cWe\u201d comment).\n\nI agree that solution is the best of both, I was only suggesting the other approach for everything as that would mean the app would work the same across the board, instead of working in different ways for different apps. But if that would, as you mentioned, help with other cases, than it sounds like a good approach.\n. That doesn\u2019t seem like something _mackup_ could take care of. From your report, it seems that _tower_ is the one saving the location of your repos with a full path. If that\u2019s the case, there\u2019s not much _mackup_ can do. Your best bet would be to ask the _tower_ developers to use relative paths when possible.\n. I see your point. Yes, that\u2019s a reasonable concern, we hadn\u2019t touch on that possibility of cases in the conversation, thank you for pointing that out.\n. > > However, isn't backup/restore + uninstall = copy?\n> \n> Yes\n\nNot exactly, no. Copying allows [possibilities that are not available with linking](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/154), and are thus not available with backup/restore + uninstall. Were they same thing, this wouldn\u2019t be an issue.\n. It\u2019s not exactly their fault, it\u2019s due to Ember being a MAS-only app. See [this issue](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/154) for details.\n. Yes, I took the docs as the starting point, but decided to include the whole `.config/livestreamer` directory since it can have [plugins](http://livestreamer.tanuki.se/en/latest/cli.html#sideloading-plugins) installed there.\n. That should work, yes. My though was that fewer links are better than more, and since there won\u2019t be anything inside `.config/livestreamer` that is not related to the app, it\u2019d be more efficient to directly sync that.\n\nHowever, if you prefer to have those separate, I can edit the pull request. Should I?\n. Done.\n. Closing as part of personal cleanup of old pull requests and issues.

Mackup [doesn\u2019t support MAS apps](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/154) [because it relies on symlinking](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/195).\n\nThe project seems mostly abandoned feature-wise, so I somehow doubt it\u2019ll happen. At least not without a PR.\n. > not really abandoned, I just need people to contribute =)\n\nWell, like I said:\n\n> The project seems mostly abandoned feature-wise, so I somehow doubt it\u2019ll happen. **At least not without a PR**.\n\nSo, same thing. If none of the core maintainers (you alone, I believe) is working on adding features, then the project is indeed effectively abandoned feature-wise. Wishing people contribute is very different than having said contributions.\n. To be clear, I\u2019m not criticising you not adding features. It\u2019s your project, and as with the [multiple ssh issues](https://github.com/lra/mackup/search?q=ssh&type=Issues&utf8=%E2%9C%93), it seems to me you have it working perfectly well for your exact needs and hence have no further incentive to keep adding to or changing it, _which is totally valid_.\n\nThat said, that is not what you\u2019re saying. Issues are left to linger, and requests aren\u2019t refused or responded to with \u201cI won\u2019t do it, but will accept a contribution for it\u201d, so users rightly get the impression those things are indeed being taken into consideration and worked on, which is not the case.\n. Most of that was addressed in my previous comments. Quite frankly, I have little interest in continuing down this conversation since I always make a huge effort to be respectful in pointing out what I think is wrong here but am always faced with what feels like a defensive take and answers to points I never made.\n\nMy take on it is (I believe) very clear: it is perfectly OK for you to not work on the project and everything that is asked, but you don\u2019t say it. Issues are left open, _including_ **_numerous**_ _duplicates_ without reply or acknowledgement for a long time (if ever). I\u2019m certain there are capable users that would take on the work of submitting PRs for what is needed, _but if you don\u2019t participate (or better yet, lead) in the discussion of what you believe should be included_ **_and how to implement it**_ _why would anyone else_?\n\nPRs won\u2019t happen simply because there\u2019s a TODO. Contributors need to feel their ideas will be at the very least considered (even if immediately refused) and that there is a point to spending time on them. If you don\u2019t participate, they never do, and move on.\n. I appreciate the offer, but I honestly do not think I\u2019d be a good candidate for that as I stopped using mackup, since syncing instead of copying broke too many things for me. For that reason I don\u2019t check back as often, and you\u2019d be back at square one.\n\nI\u2019m still up for helping with unifying the configs into a common repo/format, as we\u2019ve talked about other times, though.\n\nI do however recommend that when you engage with the issues, keep and eye out for a user that frequently participates, and \u201cpromote\u201d that one to that position. Many times giving people the extra responsibility makes them work even more to earn it (in homebrew-cask we have examples).\n. Closing as part of personal cleanup of old pull requests and issues. There\u2019s no fix in sight (which is fine) and I have long stopped using mackup, so no point in keeping it open. #615 as links to all these, so they won\u2019t be lost.\r\n\r\nPlease do let me know if you need something from these.. Actually, Fontcase is dead. It has been discontinued for a while.\n. The discussion about this is already going on in _homebrew-cask_ in [this issue](https://github.com/phinze/homebrew-cask/issues/1135), so feel free to comment there, @yangm97.\n. The problem then arises of when to remove the `obsolete_configuration_files` directive \u2014 how long is long enough to have it there?\n\nPicking up from @aristidesfl\u2019s idea, perhaps _mackup_ could check against the files/directories backed up (whatever their location might be) and the ones listed in the configuration. If a discrepancy is found (including a configuration file being missing, for its support having been dropped), act accordingly.\n. @commadelimited If you edit the file yourself in your local install, it should work fine. You do not need to wait for it to be officially done.\n. I\u2019m not sure if in this case it\u2019ll break, or it\u2019ll just be overwritten (which would be fine). I seem to remember @lra mentioning this relatively recent system of conf files would work well with user-additions. I might be misremembering, though.\n. Why are you removing previous locations? [Textual is open source](https://github.com/Codeux/Textual/), and you don\u2019t need to install it from the AppStore. By removing those locations, you\u2019re essentially breaking this for people who built Textual themselves.\n. Since it seems to be working, sure.\n. This is misleading. Not everyone follows the same non-standard way of organisation, and it\u2019d be wrong for _mackup_ to impose one on every user. Cases like this should use [standard files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29#Execution_order_of_startup_files), and nothing else. If a user has custom needs, it\u2019s easy to edit _mackup_\u2019s configuration files for personal needs.\n. [Instructions](https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#add-support-for-an-application-or-any-file-or-directory).\n. [Documentation on this](https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#applications).\n. [In the documentation](https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/doc/README.md#google-drive).\n. Mackup only has in [messages.cfg](https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup/applications/messages.cfg) one file exactly named `com.apple.iChat.plist`, which is the one in `~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iChat.plist`.\n. Why not just remove that extra file, and see if the remaining ones cause any trouble? Will send a PR with that in mind.\n. > If we took the main .plist file, there's no reason of having the others.\n\nWhy not? They still contain preferences.\n\n> It's also something that you set up immediately after firing up a Mac and never change;\n\nSo are most preferences for most apps. I\u2019d say _mackup_\u2019s goal is to save that trouble whenever possible.\n\nThat said, I don\u2019t personally care that much about Messages. I do believe it\u2019d be worthwhile to find the best way to make it work, though.\n. @maxnordlund You can [tell mackup to not sync certain things](https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#dont-sync-an-application).\n. Duplicate of https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/195.\n\nAs you can read there, this isn\u2019t very likely to happen in mackup.\n. Just look at [mackup\u2019s ssh config file](https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/b239d6c7613f7770504d3760bd6b5e6879554d26/mackup/applications/ssh.cfg). There are [many open issues](https://github.com/lra/mackup/search?q=ssh&type=Issues&utf8=%E2%9C%93) about [that insecurity](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/336), and it [seems likely it\u2019ll remain that way](https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/352#issuecomment-58059368) (although the issues are still open).\n\nNot, it is not safe to put your mackup syncs in a public repo. At the very least you should be concerned about your software keys for purchased apps.\n. What 1Password syncs over dropbox (or other) is your passwords/notes/other. What this submission is asking to sync are its preferences.\n. There are some conflicts that need to be resolved. You may have updated an older version of some of the files.\n. [You need to create it yourself](https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#only-sync-one-or-two-application).\n. I believe Mackup\u2019s stance on Alfred to be as (more, actually) ridiculous as [it\u2019s stance with Google Chrome](https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/153). Subverting it is so easy (and even allowed, by its structure), there\u2019s really no point in preventing it\u2019s inclusion in the main repo. Syncing them in this manner also brings clear benefits over the way said apps do it, which makes it a valuable addition _even to those who paid for it_.\n\nNo one will not buy Alfred because they can sync their configurations some other way. If you\u2019re buying it solely for syncing preferences you\u2019re throwing your money away anyway; its main selling point is workflows \u2014 everything else is just a nice addition.\n. This isn\u2019t a mackup problem, but a homebrew problem. You should [open an issue there](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/new).\n. ``` bash\n$ brew info mackup\nmackup: stable 0.7.4, HEAD\nhttps://github.com/lra/mackup\n/usr/local/Cellar/mackup/0.7.4 (214 files, 948K) *\n  Built from source\nFrom: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/mackup.rb\n```\n\nLike I said, you should open an issue on homebrew\u2019s repo. It\u2019s a problem on your end, regarding homebrew, not mackup. You can try `brew install https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/mackup.rb`, but otherwise you are asking on the wrong repo.\n. I don\u2019t use Messages scripts and am not sure how prevalent they are in user\u2019s machines. A single script causing errors also doesn\u2019t mean much; maybe it is the least popular and only Messages script in existence that causes the problem, so it wouldn\u2019t make much sense to \u201cpunish\u201d all the others for it.\n\nSome context would be appreciated, @morphinewan. I can\u2019t read that message and will venture a guess that @lra can\u2019t either. We can\u2019t even be sure it\u2019s an error being caused by Messages \u2014 the only thing I see is a box with some text I can\u2019t comprehend, with the Finder\u2019s icon and a reference to Message\u2019s bundle ID. Being a screenshot also means we can\u2019t even copy the text to translate with a piece of software. What does the error say, exactly? And which script is it, where did you get it from?\n. Ah, it\u2019s clear now, thank you for the explanation. Seems like the issue is only with linking, so the directory could be [synced with copying](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/195) only.\n. Seems like it, yes. I linked to the copying issue because you mentioned [copying could be done in the apps that needed](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/195#issuecomment-33308596). Alternatively this could be commented out, and if copying becomes something not app-specific but a setting inside the `.cfg` files themselves, it could be leveraged then.\n. Honestly, for these types of configurations, I think syncing is a mistake. Not only is it error prone, it\u2019s an insane amount of work. Instead, [set whatever you want in a script and run it when needed](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/dotfiles/blob/27353c7d2c8b904954b16d59b9cab8b9e36a1fc3/scripts/03_configs.sh#L21-L40).\r\n\r\nJust like with something like Atom, syncing the directory with the actual plugins can also lead to issues and is also a mistake, that\u2019s what `apm` is for. Syncing should be the last resort, the first being to automate the app\u2019s commands.\r\n. [Know issue](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/154). Mackup can\u2019t handle those, [because it relies on symlinking](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/195).\n. Yes, if the option for app bundles is added, [as discussed](https://twitter.com/vhgalvao/status/511467067611287553). Something like [`atom`](https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/902e2eda610403e393a24960efee57ac41d202c6/mackup/applications/atom.cfg) would end up like\n\n``` cfg\n[application]\nname = Atom\nid = com.github.atom\n\n[configuration_files]\nLibrary/Preferences/com.github.atom.plist\n.atom/config.cson\n.atom/init.coffee\n.atom/keymap.cson\n.atom/keymaps\n.atom/snippets.cson\n.atom/styles.less\n```\n. To be clear, I\u2019m talking exclusively about adding that line to the INI files and not at all about adding the feature to mackup.\n\nI very much understand your desire to keep mackup sync-only, but if I or anyone else wants to create a tool that is centred on copying, having the bundle identifier to overcome that limitation in mackup is useful.\n\nMy argument here is not that mackup must support bundle identifiers, but that this central repo we\u2019re talking about, to be useful for other projects, should include it.\n. This has been repeated [time](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/336) and [time](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/109) again. There\u2019s at least one more issue about this. @lra has also stated that syncing his ssh keys is part of the reason he started mackup in the first place, so this is unlikely to change.\n\nWhy these issues are still open, I have no idea.\n. [In the documentation](https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#only-sync-one-or-two-application).\n. [vscode.cfg](https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/mackup/applications/vscode.cfg).\n. https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/116, https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/405, https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/417, https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/127, https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/20.\n. For MAS apps, it\u2019ll likely also need to `defaults read` preferences to a file and restore them with `defaults write`. This is why I\u2019ve been mentioning storing bundle IDs.\n. @lra To be fair, it doesn\u2019t really explain it. It says `mackup` does `ln`. If you don\u2019t know what `ln` is (and why would you, if you just want to backup your configurations) you don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. It\u2019s also the third point in a list of technical details (which a user won\u2019t read if, again, all they want to do is backup configurations).\n\nThe only time `link` is even referenced in the README is in the word \u201clinked\u201d, [five paragraphs into a long explanation most people won\u2019t care about](https://github.com/lra/mackup#why-did-you-do-this) that says what you _used_ to do (i.e. it doesn\u2019t even mean that\u2019s what `mackup` does).\n. https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/212.\n. > Any chance that this pull request is getting merged any time soon to add support for CopyQ and Rhythmbox?\n\nTis can\u2019t be merged because there are merge conflicts.\n. Rebase your changes on top of master: `git pull --rebase upstream master` (`upstream` might be a different remote, depending on how you set it up) and it should tell you what the conflicts are. [More instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-from-the-command-line/).\n. You have an extraneous merge commit that ideally wouldn\u2019t be there, but yes, it is mergeable now.\n.

Default behaviour for the OS:\n\n``` bash\n$ diff /bin/cat /bin/echo\nBinary files /bin/cat and /bin/echo differ\n```\n\nSimply warn they\u2019re binary, and if (not how) they differ (or not).\n.

I have it set up the same way. And I do tend to backup less using git than I would using Dropbox for the same reason.

Try Mackup while Karabiner is not running.\n\nI tried quitting Karabiner, deleting the preference files, and doing a Mackup restore. Then the Karabiner preference file symlinks are created and Karabiner works fine with them. Sorry I can't help more.\n. This is probably a backup during plist editing: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202292 .\n. Sorry, I only ever tested this with Python 3. @lra, what's the right way to fix the encoding? Is there a way to do it in the config, is this in the parser?\r\n\r\nAlso, it appears that Ubersicht might have a new default widgets directory ~/Library/Application Support/tracesOf.Uebersicht. Replacing the current directory with this in the config would fix the problem, but potentially break someone's older setup.. Follow the instructions for [Configuration > Storage > File System](https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/doc/README.md), then set up git as you would for any project in specified directory.. I have it set up the same way. And I do tend to backup less using git than I would using Dropbox for the same reason. But mackup doesn't run as a process, and I doubt many people would want it taking over git. But you could write a shell script to run on a regular basis to commit and push your changes.. ",

Previously, the way to run mackup was to git-clone locally, make changes, and use that. This works well for when your cloned repository is in Dropbox, and does allow for 'backing up' custom configs, but it's not ideal (and not the way recommended in the documentation).\n. There's another 'paper cut' that something like this would solve:\n\nSome apps, (Quicksilver, bettertouchtool, etc), use their folders a _lot_, and linking the config means that a) Dropbox's 'Recently Changed' feature is useless, and b) that Dropbox uses far more resources than necessary on each minor change.\n\nOne suggestion that's been bouncing around is to have a setting in the config for the backup interval and then either copy the files as suggested above, or create a zip file of the config, overwriting the old one.\n\nPersonally, I would rather the zip file because it keeps the file cruft down, while still giving Dropbox versioning.\n\nNote: this feature could even be 'experts only', and require the user to either run the backup manually (mackup backup Quicksilver), or set up a cronjob themselves.\n. I'm sad to report that in 10.11 Beta (15A234d), the color picker does not read custom color palettes when the ~/Library/Colors/ folder is symlinked.\n\nTo reproduce:\n1. Open a file in Preview\n2. Open the color picker (Show Markup Toolbar > Stroke or Fill > Show Colors... )\n3. Go to the 'Color Palettes' tab\n4. Create a new palette and add a couple colors\n5. Quit Preview\n6. Reopen Preview and verify that the palette is there\n7. Quit preview\n8. Go to ~/Library/Colors and see the custom palette (usually \"Untitled.clr\")\n9. Move the Colors folder to ~/Dropbox/Mackup/Library/\n10. in Terminal, run 'ln -s ~/Dropbox/Mackup/Library/Colors ~/Library/'\n11. Verify that the alias is in ~/Library and that the .clr file is there\n12. Open an image in Preview, and open the Color Picker\n\nExpected result: The custom palette is listed and available\nActual result: The custom palette is missing, only the defaults are shown. Additionally, any newly created palettes are not saved.\n. The file created by default on a case-insensitive system is `~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist`\n.

Mackup should actually not move any files without confirming with the user first. It should present the list of apps or files which will be backed up and confirm if the user wants to proceed.\n.

Ok, managed to create a symlink to `karabiner.plist` with `mackup backup`.\nHowever something else strange is happening. A `karabiner.plist.x8473xxxxx` is constantly being created and deleted inside dropbox. Do you experience the same thing?\n\nEDIT: The file is create and removed as karabiner is used, so dropbox is constantly indexing.\n. Surprised no one else is having problems with this.. it's not usable.. any idea how to solve?\n. Even after dealing with the cache problem, any idea how to handle the constant backup indexing while karabiner is being used?\n. @asmeurer restarting after `mackup restore` also worked for the cache problem.\n. Isn't that recipe for trouble? when you uninstall on  other machines the app will be already ignored and thus not uninstalled.\n. Maybe we should have a mechanism to handle this situation better. For example we could store a backups of the config file, and when changes are detected (like apps removed from the config), the  restore/uninstall could handle things more gracefully.\n.

It seems my Configuration.plist got lost in the process somehow :(\nNo biggie, thanks for the help uninstalling.\n. Has anyone attempted to sync `~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist` between El Capitan and Sierra?\r\n. Mackup should actually not move any files without confirming with the user first. It should present the list of apps or files which will be backed up and confirm if the user wants to proceed.\n. How often do you run mackup backup?\n. The only reason I asked is because it is documented in the readme: https://github.com/lra/mackup#usage\n. Not really, seems the right thing to do.\n. No preference is being synced except for `private.xml`\n~/Library/Preferences/org.pqrs.Karabiner.plist symlink gets overwritten by Karabiner when it launches. Karabiner 10.21.0 \n. And a symlink is not being created by `mackup backup`. The file only gets copyed to dropbox.\n. Ok, managed to create a symlink to `karabiner.plist` with `mackup backup`.\nHowever something else strange is happening. A `karabiner.plist.x8473xxxxx` is constantly being created and deleted inside dropbox. Do you experience the same thing?\n\nEDIT: The file is create and removed as karabiner is used, so dropbox is constantly indexing.\n. Surprised no one else is having problems with this.. it's not usable.. any idea how to solve?\n. Even after dealing with the cache problem, any idea how to handle the constant backup indexing while karabiner is being used?\n. @asmeurer restarting after `mackup restore` also worked for the cache problem.\n. Isn't that recipe for trouble? when you uninstall on  other machines the app will be already ignored and thus not uninstalled.\n. Maybe we should have a mechanism to handle this situation better. For example we could store a backups of the config file, and when changes are detected (like apps removed from the config), the  restore/uninstall could handle things more gracefully.\n. ",

Ok, it gets a little better, actually.

Yep, @lamielle I can confirm that fix works. Therefore, it looks like the ticket can be closed considering the working homebrew formula.\n. ",

With the latest version im finally able to backup including Atom. I still think the sync should be a bit more selective for this app, because it does include a large files amount, including caching folders that keeps Dropbox syncing all day while we work with the app. \n\nI believe the `compile-cache`, `.node-gyp` and `storage` all seem to be temporary or cache related and should be excluded. \n\nThis also because, not sure if it is your experience, but to me it seems that Dropbox have some issues of performance and memory consumption when you have large quantities of files being synced.\n\nThanks.\n. Sorry for the \"spamming\", just to confirm my theory:\nhttp://discuss.atom.io/t/node-gyp-in-atom/5742\n. @damiankloip Can I overpower the default Atom config that comes with Mackup using what is described [here](https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#add-support-for-an-application-or-any-file-or-directory), will I run into trouble afterwards?\n. I could do a PR for that, but since I can't override the \"builtin\" config I wouldn't have a way to test it actually works.\n\nThe changes I was looking for are quite simple though. Sync everything except the following folders:\n\n```\n.atom/.node-gyp\n.atom/compile-cache\n.atom/storage\n```\n\nAll of those contains temporary and cache information that not only are dispensable for the sync process, but also are contributing for a lot unneeded sync activity in Dropbox because they change while you work with the editor.\n. I can confirm you can safely ignore:\n\n```\nstorage\ncompile-cache\ndev\n.npm\n.node-gyp\n```\n\nAt this point I will disable Mackup's sync Atom, it is causing me issues. Hope this may be added in a future update to Mackup.\n\nThank you. \n. Sure, here it goes:\n\n```\n~/.atom/config.cson\n~/.atom/init.coffee\n~/.atom/keymap.cson\n~/.atom/keymaps/\n~/.atom/packages/\n~/.atom/snippets.cson\n~/.atom/styles.less\n```\n. Ok, i'll take a look into the source later.\n. Just ran `mackup backup` and it pulls everything I need except the `.atom` folder.\nDo I need to do something else?\n\nUpdate: I've also noticed that although I just installed Mackup using Brew, when I run `mackup list` Atom isn't listed as a supported application.\n. Ok, for some reason I had to force a brew update to have the latest version of Mackup.\n. Having a similar error while the app is trying to backup the `.atom` folder.\nBefore this, when I was running a previous version of Mackup that didn't include Atom support, I also had similar errors for Textmate files. Since then I've uninstalled Textmate from my machine and upgraded Mackup and now getting this error:\n\n```\nBacking up .atom...\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/local/bin/mackup\",

With the latest version im finally able to backup including Atom. I still think the sync should be a bit more selective for this app, because it does include a large files amount, including caching folders that keeps Dropbox syncing all day while we work with the app. \n\nI believe the `compile-cache`, `.node-gyp` and `storage` all seem to be temporary or cache related and should be excluded. \n\nThis also because, not sure if it is your experience, but to me it seems that Dropbox have some issues of performance and memory consumption when you have large quantities of files being synced.\n\nThanks.\n. Sorry for the \"spamming\", just to confirm my theory:\nhttp://discuss.atom.io/t/node-gyp-in-atom/5742\n. @damiankloip Can I overpower the default Atom config that comes with Mackup using what is described [here](https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc#add-support-for-an-application-or-any-file-or-directory), will I run into trouble afterwards?\n. I could do a PR for that, but since I can't override the \"builtin\" config I wouldn't have a way to test it actually works.\n\nThe changes I was looking for are quite simple though. Sync everything except the following folders:\n\n```\n.atom/.node-gyp\n.atom/compile-cache\n.atom/storage\n```\n\nAll of those contains temporary and cache information that not only are dispensable for the sync process, but also are contributing for a lot unneeded sync activity in Dropbox because they change while you work with the editor.\n. I can confirm you can safely ignore:\n\n```\nstorage\ncompile-cache\ndev\n.npm\n.node-gyp\n```\n\nAt this point I will disable Mackup's sync Atom, it is causing me issues. Hope this may be added in a future update to Mackup.\n\nThank you. \n. Sure, here it goes:\n\n```\n~/.atom/config.cson\n~/.atom/init.coffee\n~/.atom/keymap.cson\n~/.atom/keymaps/\n~/.atom/packages/\n~/.atom/snippets.cson\n~/.atom/styles.less\n```\n. Ok, i'll take a look into the source later.\n. ",

I'm not sure I agree with this change: I have many keypairs which I want synced in addition to the config/known_hosts/authorized_keys you have called out explicitly here.\n\nMackup could never predict which keypairs a user may want to sync/not want to sync.  I think the whole .ssh directory is a better approach in this case.  (In others, like ~/.atom, I agree with the recent switch to only sync explicit files since there are temp files there that make no sense to sync.)\n. More generally: I have seen changes, like this one, to the mackup project that indicate to me that the tool should support a \"user overrides\" feature.  So, by default the <app>.cfg files that ship with mackup will be used.  But if a user overrides that file with something different, then that user-specific config will be used instead.  I think this would address your change here more generally.\n. Oh!  I had no idea about this feature @lra.  Wonderful.  I don't see this mentioned in the README.md, so one of us should write up a quick section that mentions this.  Thanks for letting me know.\n. Right, so since mackup does support the user override feature, the question really becomes: what should the default be for ~/.ssh.  I can see an argument for leaning on the conservative/security side of things.  In which case, this change should be accepted and those that want to sync the full directory can override the default.\n. Thanks @lra!\n. I just discovered this PR.

I think the whole .ssh directory is a better approach in this case.  (In others, like ~/.atom, I agree with the recent switch to only sync explicit files since there are temp files there that make no sense to sync.)\n. More generally: I have seen changes, like this one, to the mackup project that indicate to me that the tool should support a \"user overrides\" feature.  So, by default the <app>.cfg files that ship with mackup will be used.  But if a user overrides that file with something different, then that user-specific config will be used instead.  I think this would address your change here more generally.\n. Oh!  I had no idea about this feature @lra.  Wonderful.  I don't see this mentioned in the README.md, so one of us should write up a quick section that mentions this.  Thanks for letting me know.\n. Right, so since mackup does support the user override feature, the question really becomes: what should the default be for ~/.ssh.  I can see an argument for leaning on the conservative/security side of things.  In which case, this change should be accepted and those that want to sync the full directory can override the default.\n. ",

    "mwilliammyers": "huge :+1: \n. It would be either/or:\nSo if `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set it would look at: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mackup/mackup.cfg` (notice these files/dirs are not invisible), if it is not set, then it will look at: `$HOME/.mackup.cfg`. I'm wondering how the `~/.mackup` directory (for custom app.cfg files or to override default app.cfg files) would be represented as well... Maybe they would just be in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mackup` alongside `mackup.cfg`?\n\nSee the `--global` option under the [git docs](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-config) for a good example of how they obey the XDG spec.\n. It is customary for every app/package to have their own directory in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (or any other XDG directory), so it would be:\n1. try `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mackup/` and `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mackup/mackup.cfg` if they exist.\n2. if not, try `$HOME/.mackup/` and `$HOME/.mackup.cfg`\n3. if not, no config.\n\nThat way the only directory mackup ever interfaces with is: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mackup/`\n\nI love this package by the way. Nice work!\n. Am I understanding you correctly that, as it stands right now does it:\n1. try: `$HOME/.mackup/mackup.cfg`\n2. if not, try:`$HOME/.mackup.cfg`\n3. if not, no config.\n\nIf you want to keep it consistent between XDG and non XDG, it could behave like your original suggestion:\n1. try `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mackup/` and `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mackup.cfg` if they exist.\n2. if not, try `$HOME/.mackup/` and `$HOME/.mackup.cfg`\n3. if not, no config.\n. Ok that makes a lot more sense.\nThen you original suggestion: \n1. try `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mackup/` and `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mackup.cfg` if they exist.\n2. if not, try `$HOME/.mackup/` and `$HOME/.mackup.cfg`\n3. if not, no config.\n\nis definitely the way to go.\n\nSo basically: `$HOME` is interchangeable with `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` except that in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` you don't hide the directories or files...\n. Awesome, Ill see if I can do a PR soon\n. Tested it on OS X 10.11 beta 5 and OS X 10.10.4 and it works great. Awesome PR!\n. Am I wrong in thinking that you can specify multiple directory/files that \"overlap\" and mackup will only handle the ones that exist? \n\n```\n[application]\nname = Git\n\n[configuration_files]\n$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config\n$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/credentials\n$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore\n.gitignore\n.gitcredentials\n.gitconfig\n```\n\nbecause it would be useless to specify both `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config` and a `.gitconfig` so mackup would backup either/or, but not both\n\nOr are you saying mackup will throw an exception etc. if the variable is undefined rather than expanding it first, if set, and then checking the directories...\n\nEither way should mackup have a way of handling conflicting paths?

Let me know if you want me to rebase/squash...\n. @lra Just checking up on this... is there something I missed?\n. Maybe this would be a part of #603?\n. huge :+1: \n. It would be either/or:\nSo if `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set it would look at: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mackup/mackup.cfg` (notice these files/dirs are not invisible), if it is not set, then it will look at: `$HOME/.mackup.cfg`. I'm wondering how the `~/.mackup` directory (for custom app.cfg files or to override default app.cfg files) would be represented as well... Maybe they would just be in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mackup` alongside `mackup.cfg`?\n\nSee the `--global` option under the [git docs](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-config) for a good example of how they obey the XDG spec.\n. It is customary for every app/package to have their own directory in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (or any other XDG directory), so it would be:\n1. try `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mackup/` and `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mackup/mackup.cfg` if they exist.\n2. if not, try `$HOME/.mackup/` and `$HOME/.mackup.cfg`\n3. if not, no config.\n\nThat way the only directory mackup ever interfaces with is: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mackup/`\n\nI love this package by the way. Nice work!\n. Am I understanding you correctly that, as it stands right now does it:\n1. try: `$HOME/.mackup/mackup.cfg`\n2. if not, try:`$HOME/.mackup.cfg`\n3. if not, no config.\n\nIf you want to keep it consistent between XDG and non XDG, it could behave like your original suggestion:\n1. try `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mackup/` and `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mackup.cfg` if they exist.\n2. if not, try `$HOME/.mackup/` and `$HOME/.mackup.cfg`\n3. if not, no config.\n. Ok that makes a lot more sense.\nThen you original suggestion: \n1. try `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mackup/` and `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mackup.cfg` if they exist.\n2. if not, try `$HOME/.mackup/` and `$HOME/.mackup.cfg`\n3. if not, no config.\n\nis definitely the way to go.\n\nSo basically: `$HOME` is interchangeable with `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` except that in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` you don't hide the directories or files...\n. Awesome, Ill see if I can do a PR soon\n. Tested it on OS X 10.11 beta 5 and OS X 10.10.4 and it works great. Awesome PR!\n. Am I wrong in thinking that you can specify multiple directory/files that \"overlap\" and mackup will only handle the ones that exist? \n\n```\n[application]\nname = Git\n\n[configuration_files]\n$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config\n$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/credentials\n$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore\n.gitignore\n.gitcredentials\n.gitconfig\n```\n\nbecause it would be useless to specify both `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config` and a `.gitconfig` so mackup would backup either/or, but not both\n\nOr are you saying mackup will throw an exception etc. if the variable is undefined rather than expanding it first, if set, and then checking the directories...\n\nEither way should mackup have a way of handling conflicting paths? Os is this overkill?:\n\n```\n[application]\nname = Git\n\n[configuration_files]\n$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config || .gitconfig\n$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/credentials or .gitcredentials\n$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore or .gitignore\n```\n. - the actual XDG [spec](http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html)\n- [list](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/XDG_Base_Directory_support) of apps that support XDG and how they do (i.e. the differences in paths/files they support depending on if `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set or not) - obviously you wouldn't need to maintain the app.cfg files based on this list as users (like me) could through PR but it is a handy link none-the-less\n.

Hi @SharkIng \r\nSince my PR to fasd is still not merged, I can share a simple work around, you can just create a `.fasdrc` file with:\r\n```\r\nFASD_DATA=\"$HOME/.fasd/fasd\"\r\n```\r\nthen if you move the .fasd data files to a directory, fore example like this:\r\n```\r\nmkdir ~/tmpdir\r\nmv ~/.fasd ~/tmpdir/fasd\r\nmv ~/tmpdir ~/.fasd\r\n```\r\nthe whole folder will be symlinked.. It is used by audacious plugin supporting lastfm (http://www.last.fm) scrobbler. This file is not generated if you do not use the plugin. If you do and are offline, the scrobbles are stored in this file and are pushed to lastfm once you are online again.\n. +1, I will (Monday)\n. done\n. +1\n. ",

OK I think I know why it happens.\n\nFor _some_ reason certain stuff related to the .git folder was symlinked to files belonging to GitHub's mac app. I have no clue why this has happened in the first page, but removing those symlinks (that point to a file that no longer exists) solves the issue.
