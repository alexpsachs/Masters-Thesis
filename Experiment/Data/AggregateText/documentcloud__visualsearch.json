But the real cause is that it's a headache of autocomplete debugging and broken keyboard shortcuts that still need to be addressed.\n. Tested with jQuery 1.4.4. Works fine. Added jQuery 1.4.4 in b5dc4c9\n. Apologies for sitting on this. Just moved across the country and am only now getting tethering on my phone so I can work on this during my commute on Caltrain.\n\nThe idea I started with is that you get the serialized query, but if you want the raw Collection, just ask `VS.app.searchQuery` for specifics. It's a Backbone Collection, and if you look in `search_query.js`, you'll notice a handful of convenience functions, such as `find`, `count`, `values`, `has`, and `withoutCategory`.\n\nI'm going to be making VS.js instance-based, so you'll get a reference to the SearchQuery Collection when you instantiate a new visual search. Does this do the trick? It's how we interact with specific facets in DocumentCloud.\n. Exactly, instance-based means you get a local reference after initialization. You will no longer be able to just called `VS.options`, but instead have to use myVS.options.\n\nAs for changing the parameters, I'm fine with giving the collection back and having to use `queryCollection.serialize()` to get the search string you're getting now. I'll change that in later today.\n. Added a second parameter in 0739056a3eb097d8201b2b513e34761ef0420012. It's not exactly this pull request, but it's pretty close. It's the Backbone.Collection of the search facets, so it should be just what you need. Hope that helps.\n. So I closed this in the other pull request, as it was out of scope. Although now I can see the use. If you want to re-submit this pull request with the updated code (and possibly using the new hooks), I would gladly work it in.\n. It depends on whether you add the facet to the `unquotable` option. If `name` is in `unquotable`, then only the first word is added to the facet. Otherwise, it should be quoting it, but only if you are in the facet.\n. This pull request has become a bit mangled. Also, I think a date picker is out of scope for visual search, although I could be convinced otherwise.\n. We just don't have any non-text based inputs.\n. These are great ideas but I'm afraid they are way out of scope for VisualSearch.js. That's a bit beyond the simple use of AND'ing all of the basic facets together. You'd have to have a tertiary value in every facet - the comparison value. That would add an unrealistic bit of complication to the interface.\n. Upgraded to latest jQuery UI and I can now successfully use the scroll bar.\n. How are you clearing the searches? \n. This is proposed in another pull request. I'm thinking of adding in an option to show the facets available after 0 characters--effectively on click/focus.\n. This has launched a few months ago, I just forgot to update this ticket. Try clicking on an empty search box -- it will now show all of the available options. Effectively, minlength = 0.\n. There's a few ways you can focus in to a facet. First off, decide which one you want, and then do one of these types of focus on the facet (try this on `demo.html`):\n\n```\nvisualSearch.searchBox.facetViews[0].selectText();\nvisualSearch.searchBox.facetViews[0].enableEdit();\nvisualSearch.searchBox.facetViews[0].setCursorAtEnd();\n```\n. I'm hitting up the backlog of VS.js issues later this week, but I wanted to pop in and say thanks for such an awesome and well-written pull request. This is a fantastic addition. I'll clean up a few more lingering issues, change the search callback, and put out version 0.2 soon.\n. Agreed. Deployed.\n. Yeah, I don't think this is in scope for VisualSearch.js. It seems you could build such a tool, but it wouldn't be something that I plan on offering with VS.\n. Unfortunately for this use case, VisualSearch.js is a text box replacement, so having an image in there doesn't translate to the idea that it is a single string query.\n. I'm able to use dashes in facet names now. Check out the latest code.\n. Just re-initialize the search box with your new query. You'll have to convert it into a full text query, but it should be trivial if it's just checkboxes.\n\nTry running this on `demo.html`:\n\n```\nvisualSearch.searchBox.value('country: \"South Africa\"')\n```\n. The top result is the currently selected value. \n\n![](http://f.cl.ly/items/340Z062T2d2G1j1X3Y3j/Screen%20Shot%202011-10-17%20at%20Oct%2017%2010.02.28%20AM.png)\n\nCheck to make sure the facet's value is empty.\n\nAlso, check search_facet.JS -- VS.ui.SearchFacet.autocompleteValues(): http://documentcloud.github.com/visualsearch/docs/search_facet.html#section-11. Note these line:\n\n```\nresp(_.sortBy(matches, function(match) {\n  if (match == value || match.value == value) return '';\n  else return match;\n}));\n```\n\nThat's ensuring that the current value is moved to the top.\n. The latest release (0.2.1) allows custom ordering. Enjoy!\n. Thanks for the PR. This took a bit more needling in order to make it work as expected. See 8b0b1004433ae898ab64afaeef4e3c330c645afa for complete details. I also changed the preserveOrder parameter into an options hash, for future-proofing.\n. Great find. Thanks!\n. New features are added because pull requests are offered with the request. While the code may not have been finished, it was enough of an incentive to push the feature through.\n\niOS is not supported, unfortunately. Since much of VisualSearch.js requires keyboard input, it wouldn't make sense to try to offer the same interface on iOS.\n. Sure thing! So the \"structured search query\" is not actually returned to you. You just have to call it. And I agree, this could be way better documented. I'm adding it to the README now.\n\n```\n// Returns the unstructured search query\nVS.searchBox.value() \n// country: \"South Africa\" account: 5-samuel title: \"Pentagon Papers\"\n\n// Returns an array of Facet model instances\nVS.searchQuery.facets()\n// [FacetModel<country:\"South Africa\">, FacetModel<account:5-samuel>, FacetModel<title:\"Pentagon Papers\">]\n```\n. Take a look at Issue #52, which is effectively the same issue as this. To quote: \" So I'm finally realizing why we can't have this ability. If you click on the label, does it switch to its value? The search query is a literal serialization of the search box. In other words, what you see is what you get. That's why labels are supported for the drop-down but not for the input itself.\n\nChanging to use labels instead of the values in the search box is out of scope for this type of facetted search. In that case, just present the user with options or a drop down. VisualSearch.js is intended to be a search box enhancement. Unfortunately, this feature does not work with a search box that searches for what you are typing.\"\n. Yeah, right now there's no way to do that. You could easily change the text from 'Text' to something else. VisualSearch is not under active development, so modifying the source wouldn't cause you as much of a headache as it would on a more actively developed project.\n. Ack, this was asked a while ago. Sorry! But yes, you should totally contribute to this. I am aware of this behavior, but never considered it bad enough. But you're right, it should be doing exactly what you describe. If you write it, I'll stick it in. I suppose it's about time to add a CONTRIBUTORS doc, so if you write this up (use demo.html to test) I'll start that list.\n. Yeah, it's something in your CSS. There's an invisible div that's positioned nearby (look for it in the DOM), which is used to measure the width of text. Check the auogrowInput() method to see how it's being created. From https://github.com/documentcloud/visualsearch/blob/master/lib/js/utils/jquery_extensions.js#L29-35:\n\n```\n  var $tester = $('<div />').css({\n    opacity     : 0,\n    top         : -9999,\n    left        : -9999,\n    position    : 'absolute',\n    whiteSpace  : 'nowrap'\n  }).addClass('VS-input-width-tester').addClass('VS-interface');\n```\n\nYou'll want to change your styling to allow for that element.\n. Hey, I'm out traveling but this looks great. I'll get to testing it in just a few days. Thanks for being so patient. \n. I'm getting this in today, but there's a few small glitches that arise when the autocomplete list for facet names shows up immediately. I'll try to get that fixed, but another issue is the verbosity of the name `facetAutocompleteMinLength`. Got any ideas on how to shorten that up a bit? Also, maybe we just want to make it a boolean that controls whether the facet options show up immediately or on a single keystroke? I don't see much of a need for delaying until more than a single character is given.\n. Thanks for this. I cleaned it up a bit, but now demo.html shows the new option.\n. Looks great! Thanks for this.\n. I'm working through this, but I'm not sure that it covers all possible cases. Firstly, I want to change `autosearch` to `searchOnChange` (thanks @jashkenas for the suggestion). Secondly, this pull request disables the ability to select an option from a facet's dropdown, so it needs some tweaking.\n\nOn which specific interactions do you want to disable automatic searching? Pressing enter will search, but so will clicking on a value from the dropdown. Additionally, deleting a facet will also search. Of those three, you want to disable everything but enter? If you select something from the drop down, the value needs to be committed to the facet (saved to its underlying model), which is currently handled in the search code.\n\nI just want a bit of confirmation on what specific behavior you want to disable, so I can check those cases.\n. Yeah, this is a nice change that I'd love to see, but the real reason it hasn't been implemented is that there are a couple of keyboard shortcuts that break, along with some autocomplete headaches that need to be resolved. I'll keep this pull request open as a reminder, and if there's any additional encouragement, I could be persuaded to finally work through the madness that this feature brings in terms of debugging.\n. Thanks to issue #41, you can now click on a search box and it will show all possible facets.\n\nAs for this pull request, looks good.\n. Great idea. I'd prefer to have the option be explicit about the filtering behavior rather than the \"preservation\" behavior. It can be defaulted to true, so maybe `filterMatches`? But just to confirm, you're already filtering server side, right?\n. I'll be adding this feature later this week. Stay tuned. (It's in a branch that I haven't pushed due to lack of time.)\n. Yup, in release 0.3.0.\n. Err, those are the same link. Tried http://jsfiddle.net/GGYCg/2/ but no luck. Got another link?\n. Thanks!\n. You can. Since Backbone is already present on the page, you can just hook into vs.app.searchQuery's events: [add, remove].\n\nOn the demo.html page, try adding the following:\nwindow.visualSearch.searchQuery.bind('add', function() { console.log(['Added', arguments]); })\n\nAdditionally, you could serialize the facet and stick it into pushState call in the search callback:\n\n```\n callbacks  : {\n        search : function(query, searchCollection) {\n          console.log([\"query\", searchCollection.facets(), query]);\n        }\n }\n```\n\nYou can then set the value with:\n\n```\nwindow.visualSearch.searchBox.value(\"Hello: world\")\n```\n. Thanks again!\n. Awesome. I merged this with one change. Thanks!\n. I don't think this fits with any sizable use cases, but it's a fine change to make on a fork. Considering it's such a minor code change, a fork would be just as easy to pull from. But I only see this adding complexity, and if you're already custom rendering at this stage beyond what the callbacks and events provide, then you will likely have to do some serious heroics anyhow.\n. So I'm finally realizing why we can't have this ability. If you click on the label, does it switch to its value? The search query is a literal serialization of the search box. In other words, what you see is what you get. That's why labels are supported for the drop-down but not for the input itself.\n\nChanging to use labels instead of the values in the search box is out of scope for this type of facetted search. In that case, just present the user with options or a drop down. VisualSearch.js is intended to be a search box enhancement. Unfortunately, this feature does not work with a search box that searches for what you are typing.\n. Yeah, this is a possibility, but only if you use multi-word categories. It's a reasonable expectation, but the solution is to use single-word categories.\n\n```\n\"state capital\": \"Columbus, Ohio\" year: 2012 \"density function\": \"wave form\"\n```\n\nThis is too slow to parse for a human, so the expectation is to just use a single word.\n. Went back and got it working. I'll issue a new release after a few more closed bugs, but this is now integrated on master.\n. Vestigial code is vestigial.\n. Just terrific. Thanks!\n. Here you go:\n\n```\n// Returns the unstructured search query\nvisualSearch.searchBox.value() \n// \"country: \"South Africa\" account: 5-samuel title: \"Pentagon Papers\"\"\n\n// Returns an array of Facet model instances\nvisualSearch.searchQuery.facets()\n// [FacetModel<country:\"South Africa\">, \n//  FacetModel<account:5-samuel>, \n//  FacetModel<title:\"Pentagon Papers\">]\n\n// Set the search query with raw text\nvisualSearch.searchBox.value(\"Country: US State: \\\"New York\\\" Key: Value\")\n```\n. It's the developer's responsibility for doing something to the search query. So serialize the query using the searchBox.value() method, and then send it using ajax or whatever method you were using.\n. A placeholder as an option would make a great pull request. Unquotable menas that the unquotable category will not have quotes around it. This example has `state` as an unquotable:\n\n```\ncountry: \"United States\" state: California\n```\n\nAlthough you probably don't want `state` as an unquotable, since `New York` belongs in quotes. If the category is not in unquotable, then it will get wrapped in quotes, even if it's a single word.\n. Looks fixed in #60\n. You can easily just change the `facetMatches` callback to hide used facets (which you can see by calling `visualSearch.searchQuery.pluck(\"category\")`)\n. ```\n>>> visualSearch.searchQuery.pluck(\"category\")\n[\"country\", \"account\", \"U.S. State\", \"filter\", \"access\"]\n```\n. You'll have to use the textual name of the operator. The regex that handles parsing queries isn't setup to support anything but letters and non-letters as word delimiters. \n. Unfortunately, this is a breaking API change. Also, if what you want is the internal data structure (the facet model), then feel free to directly address the facet collection and grab it.\n. Actually, the control is intended to feel like one big text box. So deleting should continue deleting the previous facet's value. As intended, although to be honest I did originally build it this way. But it isn't as natural.\n. The query parser uses a simple regex to figure out words. As long as `\\w+` matches an entire word in Russian/Cyrillic (and there's no reason it shouldn't) VisualSearch.js should have any problems with Unicode/non-ascii characters.\n. Nice thing about waiting 7 months to address this issue is that it looks like it resolved itself in the latest Firefox. Hurray!\n. Yeah, mobile support wasn't originally a priority, and I feel that just using a non-faceted search box for mobile visitors might work better for you. It's a hard interface to get right with touch. I suppose you could just convert all of the mousedown/click events into touch events, but it would still be wonky. Much of VisualSearch.js is keyboard based.\n. Not easily. VisualSearch uses Backbone, so either use both (ick), or spend a loooong time porting VS over. Hah, good luck.\n. Looks good. Thanks!\n. Aside from the mistake in the singular method, don't bother making a new method. Just extend the current one and I'll accept this pull request. Thanks!\n. I would hook into the callbacks on search and then just manually hit your backbone router to update the url. In the other direction, have your router instantiate the search box with the query you extract from the url. Handle it manually, but use the search callback provided.\n. You will want to handle this on your end, since some folks will be running queries that place an OR between phrases. You should keep a list of used keys, and then when VisualSearch's callbacks check for categories, just don't give the categories that have been used.\n. Make sure you check this against the many edge cases:\n- Deleting facets should show the menu, since the cursor is now placed in the empty spot where the facet was deleted.\n- Arrowing between facets (hit left-left-left-left many times, or similarly with right) should show the menu correctly.\n. This was actually covered in an earlier patch that was a bit more comprehensive. See issue #41 for the pull request. Anyway, it's now in and I'll be pushing a new release shortly.\n. ...and done. Thanks!\n. You should handle this in your code by keeping track of the number of facets and then refusing to autocomplete with more. Otherwise, this is a bit out of scope for the project.\n. Take a look at https://github.com/documentcloud/visualsearch/blob/master/demo.html#L300-L308. It's an easy setting for category labels.\n. Sure! Just inspect `visualSearch.searchBox.currentQuery` on click/submit of the button.\n. Good catch, thanks for this!\n. Yup, just updated all vendor dependencies to latest. See commit 1602fec.\n. Thanks for letting me know. It's possible that it is the result of creating a new jQuery UI autocomplete menu. I just upgraded the vendor dependencies to latest, so it's possible this is no longer an issue. Also, looking in search_input.js, where `.autocomplete()` is used, it should be recycled until the facet is removed, at which point it is left to the browser to GC.\n. Fair enough point. This makes it easier to get a reference to the resulting VisualSearch object.\n\n```\nvar vs = VS.init(...);\n```\n\nI don't believe it's a worthwhile change, but if you feel fit to write up a pull request with this change, I wouldn't object. :-)\n. Does this patch work on the older version of jQuery UI (1.8)? I noticed you removed a preventDefault, which might have unintended consequences for the older jQuery UI.\n. That's a huge undertaking that I don't think will be happening anytime soon. If you would like to submit this as a contribution, I would consider a pull request. Good luck with that. :-)\n. Not sure I understand the issue. I think what you're getting at is that you want to prevent a search from going through if it matches the previous search? I think you should handle this in your implementation and response functions, not in the visualsearch code.\n. Yep, it's easy. Just perform a search with:\n\n```\nvisualSearch.searchBox.value(\"Country: US State: \\\"New York\\\" Key: Value\")\n```\n. Just upgraded to latest jQuery and jQuery UI.\n. Just added a callback to it, which you can hook onto with a `removedFacet` callback.\n\n```\nremovedFacet : function (facet, query, options) {\n  this.app.options.callbacks.removedFacet(facet, query, options);\n}\n```\n. You'll want to build a new view that uses that data you get from `visualSearch.searchQuery.facets()`. The view for that organizer is on the document-cloud repo: https://github.com/documentcloud/documentcloud/blob/master/public/javascripts/ui/organizer/organizer.js.\n. That's out of scope for this project, but I would just add a flag with a key and value. Instead of ShowOnlyNew, change it to show: new vs. show:all (default).\n. Looks good. I was also able to repro the bug and this fixed it. Thanks!\n. Fixed in #100. Thanks for this! I'll be upgrading the libraries momentarily...\n. Having built the original on Backbone.js, I think there is almost no possible way for this is to rewritten with Angular.js support without a complete rewrite. You might as well start a new project.\n. There is support! You just need to implement the logic yourself in the `valueMatches` and `facetMatches` callbacks.\n. Thank you!\n. Well, try to determine how much space you have and limit your facet results/values to only 2 or 3 at a time. Otherwise, see if you can integrate it into the page, since an iframe will never let things like that bleed over the border.\n. This is out of scope for the project, but you shouldn't have much of a problem implementing that with a medium dose of JS.\n. The idea is that the search box matches perfectly what's being sent. I suppose this could change, but it's non-trivial and quite a departure from knowing that the query you see is the query that gets sent.\n. Problem is that for version 0.5.0 they all use template variables. I'd be open to a pull request if somebody wants to take the time to rewrite the templates so that they no longer rely on Underscore's _.template.\n. Thanks for this PR, but it needs to follow the convention of the source code around it. Also, I'm not sure what it does, as it looks like it doesn't work. Feel free to fix it up and provide a test case.\n. Thanks!\n. I'm wondering if it's a jQuery 2.0 bug. Try using jQuery 1.10, which is the only supported version.\n. Rranauro's right, just make sure you've included all of the dependencies. Compare the dependencies listed by your browser on http://documentcloud.github.io/visualsearch/ to your own site.\n. See those callbacks in the `facetMatches` on the VS.js homepage? Stick your ajax call in there, and on success, return your data with the callback function.\n. If you go to the visualsearch.js homepage and open the console and type `visualSearch.searchBox.value()`, you should get a single string anyhow. You're probably using `visualSearch.searchQuery.facets()` which gives you the full facet models.\n. I'm not getting the issue in Safari, Firefox, or Chrome. I _just_ updated all dependencies to latest (backbone, underscore, query, and jquery UI), so I bet that this issue is now fixed.\n. I accepted the PR, but why bother binding to the removeFacets event? By removing a facet, a search event is triggered. Wouldn't that be better to watch, since you can just remain stateless and search on the new query.\n. As you can see with the comment above the search box's removedFacet method, I write:\n\n```\n// When removing a facet, potentially do something. For now, the adjacent\n// remaining facet is selected, but this is handled by the facet's view,\n// since its position is unknown by the time the collection triggers this\n// remove callback.\nremovedFacet : function (facet, query, options) { ... }\n```\n\nSo you're not going to have a reference to what was just deleted, so why not just listen to the search event?\n. Is this my code or your code? As for this.box being undefined, check your reference and see what the `this` keyword points to.\n. Thanks for this PR. This is quite a big one, so I'll only have time to look at it in a few weeks. Ping me if it takes too long. This will require some testing and verification.\n. Thanks! They should update http://bower.io/docs/creating-packages/, which still shows:\n\n```\n{\n  \"name\": \"my-project\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"main\": \"path/to/main.css\",\n  \"ignore\": [\n    \".jshintrc\",\n    \"**/*.txt\"\n  ],\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"<name>\": \"<version>\",\n    \"<name>\": \"<folder>\",\n    \"<name>\": \"<package>\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"<test-framework-name>\": \"<version>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n. You could just add a check to the blur callback for any difference between the latest query and a cached value of the last search query.\n. To achieve what you want just turn the `autosearch` option false. Search the codebase for references to `app.options.autosearch`. This turns off automatic searching when removing facets and autocompleting facets.\n. Also, it shouldn't be blurring the input on tab. If that's happening thats a bug and should be filed separately. Make sure you mention your browser and OS.\n. Now fixed!\n. I'm going to close this pull request in lieu of #43, which addresses the issue slightly differently. But the real cause is that it's a headache of autocomplete debugging and broken keyboard shortcuts that still need to be addressed.\n. Tested with jQuery 1.4.4. Works fine. Added jQuery 1.4.4 in b5dc4c9\n. Apologies for sitting on this. Just moved across the country and am only now getting tethering on my phone so I can work on this during my commute on Caltrain.\n\nThe idea I started with is that you get the serialized query, but if you want the raw Collection, just ask `VS.app.searchQuery` for specifics.

The top result is the currently selected value. \n\n![](http://f.cl.ly/items/340Z062T2d2G1j1X3Y3j/Screen%20Shot%202011-10-17%20at%20Oct%2017%2010.02.28%20AM.png)\n\nCheck to make sure the facet's value is empty.\n\nAlso, check search_facet.JS -- VS.ui.SearchFacet.autocompleteValues(): http://documentcloud.github.com/visualsearch/docs/search_facet.html#section-11. Note these line:\n\n```\nresp(_.sortBy(matches, function(match) {\n  if (match == value || match.value == value) return '';\n  else return match;\n}));\n```\n\nThat's ensuring that the current value is moved to the top.\n. The latest release (0.2.1) allows custom ordering. Enjoy!\n. Thanks for the PR. This took a bit more needling in order to make it work as expected. See 8b0b1004433ae898ab64afaeef4e3c330c645afa for complete details. I also changed the preserveOrder parameter into an options hash, for future-proofing.\n. Great find. Thanks!\n. New features are added because pull requests are offered with the request. While the code may not have been finished, it was enough of an incentive to push the feature through.\n\niOS is not supported, unfortunately. Since much of VisualSearch.js requires keyboard input, it wouldn't make sense to try to offer the same interface on iOS.\n. Sure thing! So the \"structured search query\" is not actually returned to you. You just have to call it. And I agree, this could be way better documented. I'm adding it to the README now.\n\n```\n// Returns the unstructured search query\nVS.searchBox.value() \n// country: \"South Africa\" account: 5-samuel title: \"Pentagon Papers\"\n\n// Returns an array of Facet model instances\nVS.searchQuery.facets()\n// [FacetModel<country:\"South Africa\">, FacetModel<account:5-samuel>, FacetModel<title:\"Pentagon Papers\">]\n```\n. Take a look at Issue #52, which is effectively the same issue as this. To quote: \" So I'm finally realizing why we can't have this ability. If you click on the label, does it switch to its value? The search query is a literal serialization of the search box. In other words, what you see is what you get. That's why labels are supported for the drop-down but not for the input itself.\n\nChanging to use labels instead of the values in the search box is out of scope for this type of facetted search. In that case, just present the user with options or a drop down. VisualSearch.js is intended to be a search box enhancement. Unfortunately, this feature does not work with a search box that searches for what you are typing.\"\n. Yeah, right now there's no way to do that. You could easily change the text from 'Text' to something else. VisualSearch is not under active development, so modifying the source wouldn't cause you as much of a headache as it would on a more actively developed project.\n. Ack, this was asked a while ago. Sorry! But yes, you should totally contribute to this. I am aware of this behavior, but never considered it bad enough. But you're right, it should be doing exactly what you describe. If you write it, I'll stick it in. I suppose it's about time to add a CONTRIBUTORS doc, so if you write this up (use demo.html to test) I'll start that list.\n. Yeah, it's something in your CSS. There's an invisible div that's positioned nearby (look for it in the DOM), which is used to measure the width of text. Check the auogrowInput() method to see how it's being created. From https://github.com/documentcloud/visualsearch/blob/master/lib/js/utils/jquery_extensions.js#L29-35:\n\n```\n  var $tester = $('<div />').css({\n    opacity     : 0,\n    top         : -9999,\n    left        : -9999,\n    position    : 'absolute',\n    whiteSpace  : 'nowrap'\n  }).addClass('VS-input-width-tester').addClass('VS-interface');\n```\n\nYou'll want to change your styling to allow for that element.\n. Hey, I'm out traveling but this looks great. I'll get to testing it in just a few days. Thanks for being so patient. \n. I'm getting this in today, but there's a few small glitches that arise when the autocomplete list for facet names shows up immediately. I'll try to get that fixed, but another issue is the verbosity of the name `facetAutocompleteMinLength`. Got any ideas on how to shorten that up a bit? Also, maybe we just want to make it a boolean that controls whether the facet options show up immediately or on a single keystroke? I don't see much of a need for delaying until more than a single character is given.\n. Thanks for this. I cleaned it up a bit, but now demo.html shows the new option.\n. Looks great! Thanks for this.\n. I'm working through this, but I'm not sure that it covers all possible cases. Firstly, I want to change `autosearch` to `searchOnChange` (thanks @jashkenas for the suggestion). Secondly, this pull request disables the ability to select an option from a facet's dropdown, so it needs some tweaking.\n\nOn which specific interactions do you want to disable automatic searching? Pressing enter will search, but so will clicking on a value from the dropdown. Additionally, deleting a facet will also search. Of those three, you want to disable everything but enter? If you select something from the drop down, the value needs to be committed to the facet (saved to its underlying model), which is currently handled in the search code.\n\nI just want a bit of confirmation on what specific behavior you want to disable, so I can check those cases.\n. Yeah, this is a nice change that I'd love to see, but the real reason it hasn't been implemented is that there are a couple of keyboard shortcuts that break, along with some autocomplete headaches that need to be resolved. I'll keep this pull request open as a reminder, and if there's any additional encouragement, I could be persuaded to finally work through the madness that this feature brings in terms of debugging.\n. Thanks to issue #41, you can now click on a search box and it will show all possible facets.\n\nAs for this pull request, looks good.\n. Great idea. I'd prefer to have the option be explicit about the filtering behavior rather than the \"preservation\" behavior. It can be defaulted to true, so maybe `filterMatches`? But just to confirm, you're already filtering server side, right?\n. I'll be adding this feature later this week. Stay tuned. (It's in a branch that I haven't pushed due to lack of time.)\n. Yup, in release 0.3.0.\n. Err, those are the same link. Tried http://jsfiddle.net/GGYCg/2/ but no luck. Got another link?\n. Thanks!\n. You can. Since Backbone is already present on the page, you can just hook into vs.app.searchQuery's events: [add, remove].\n\nOn the demo.html page, try adding the following:\nwindow.visualSearch.searchQuery.bind('add', function() { console.log(['Added', arguments]); })\n\nAdditionally, you could serialize the facet and stick it into pushState call in the search callback:\n\n```\n callbacks  : {\n        search : function(query, searchCollection) {\n          console.log([\"query\", searchCollection.facets(), query]);\n        }\n }\n```\n\nYou can then set the value with:\n\n```\nwindow.visualSearch.searchBox.value(\"Hello: world\")\n```\n. Thanks again!\n. Awesome. I merged this with one change. Thanks!\n. I don't think this fits with any sizable use cases, but it's a fine change to make on a fork. Considering it's such a minor code change, a fork would be just as easy to pull from. But I only see this adding complexity, and if you're already custom rendering at this stage beyond what the callbacks and events provide, then you will likely have to do some serious heroics anyhow.\n. So I'm finally realizing why we can't have this ability. If you click on the label, does it switch to its value? The search query is a literal serialization of the search box. In other words, what you see is what you get. That's why labels are supported for the drop-down but not for the input itself.\n\nChanging to use labels instead of the values in the search box is out of scope for this type of facetted search. In that case, just present the user with options or a drop down. VisualSearch.js is intended to be a search box enhancement. Unfortunately, this feature does not work with a search box that searches for what you are typing.\n. Yeah, this is a possibility, but only if you use multi-word categories. It's a reasonable expectation, but the solution is to use single-word categories.\n\n```\n\"state capital\": \"Columbus, Ohio\" year: 2012 \"density function\": \"wave form\"\n```\n\nThis is too slow to parse for a human, so the expectation is to just use a single word.\n. Went back and got it working. I'll issue a new release after a few more closed bugs, but this is now integrated on master.\n. Vestigial code is vestigial.\n. Just terrific. Thanks!\n. Here you go:\n\n```\n// Returns the unstructured search query\nvisualSearch.searchBox.value() \n// \"country: \"South Africa\" account: 5-samuel title: \"Pentagon Papers\"\"\n\n// Returns an array of Facet model instances\nvisualSearch.searchQuery.facets()\n// [FacetModel<country:\"South Africa\">, \n//  FacetModel<account:5-samuel>, \n//  FacetModel<title:\"Pentagon Papers\">]\n\n// Set the search query with raw text\nvisualSearch.searchBox.value(\"Country: US State: \\\"New York\\\" Key: Value\")\n```\n. It's the developer's responsibility for doing something to the search query. So serialize the query using the searchBox.value() method, and then send it using ajax or whatever method you were using.\n. A placeholder as an option would make a great pull request. Unquotable menas that the unquotable category will not have quotes around it. This example has `state` as an unquotable:\n\n```\ncountry: \"United States\" state: California\n```\n\nAlthough you probably don't want `state` as an unquotable, since `New York` belongs in quotes. If the category is not in unquotable, then it will get wrapped in quotes, even if it's a single word.\n. Looks fixed in #60\n. You can easily just change the `facetMatches` callback to hide used facets (which you can see by calling `visualSearch.searchQuery.pluck(\"category\")`)\n. ```\n>>> visualSearch.searchQuery.pluck(\"category\")\n[\"country\", \"account\", \"U.S. State\", \"filter\", \"access\"]\n```\n. You'll have to use the textual name of the operator. The regex that handles parsing queries isn't setup to support anything but letters and non-letters as word delimiters. \n. Unfortunately, this is a breaking API change. Also, if what you want is the internal data structure (the facet model), then feel free to directly address the facet collection and grab it.\n. Actually, the control is intended to feel like one big text box. So deleting should continue deleting the previous facet's value. As intended, although to be honest I did originally build it this way. But it isn't as natural.\n. The query parser uses a simple regex to figure out words. As long as `\\w+` matches an entire word in Russian/Cyrillic (and there's no reason it shouldn't) VisualSearch.js should have any problems with Unicode/non-ascii characters.\n. Nice thing about waiting 7 months to address this issue is that it looks like it resolved itself in the latest Firefox. Hurray!\n. Yeah, mobile support wasn't originally a priority, and I feel that just using a non-faceted search box for mobile visitors might work better for you. It's a hard interface to get right with touch. I suppose you could just convert all of the mousedown/click events into touch events, but it would still be wonky. Much of VisualSearch.js is keyboard based.\n. Not easily. VisualSearch uses Backbone, so either use both (ick), or spend a loooong time porting VS over. Hah, good luck.\n. Looks good. Thanks!\n. Aside from the mistake in the singular method, don't bother making a new method. Just extend the current one and I'll accept this pull request. Thanks!\n. I would hook into the callbacks on search and then just manually hit your backbone router to update the url. In the other direction, have your router instantiate the search box with the query you extract from the url. Handle it manually, but use the search callback provided.\n. You will want to handle this on your end, since some folks will be running queries that place an OR between phrases. You should keep a list of used keys, and then when VisualSearch's callbacks check for categories, just don't give the categories that have been used.\n. Make sure you check this against the many edge cases:\n- Deleting facets should show the menu, since the cursor is now placed in the empty spot where the facet was deleted.\n- Arrowing between facets (hit left-left-left-left many times, or similarly with right) should show the menu correctly.\n. This was actually covered in an earlier patch that was a bit more comprehensive. See issue #41 for the pull request. Anyway, it's now in and I'll be pushing a new release shortly.\n. ...and done. Thanks!\n. You should handle this in your code by keeping track of the number of facets and then refusing to autocomplete with more. Otherwise, this is a bit out of scope for the project.\n. Take a look at https://github.com/documentcloud/visualsearch/blob/master/demo.html#L300-L308. It's an easy setting for category labels.\n. Sure! Just inspect `visualSearch.searchBox.currentQuery` on click/submit of the button.\n. Good catch, thanks for this!\n. Yup, just updated all vendor dependencies to latest. See commit 1602fec.\n. Thanks for letting me know. It's possible that it is the result of creating a new jQuery UI autocomplete menu. I just upgraded the vendor dependencies to latest, so it's possible this is no longer an issue. Also, looking in search_input.js, where `.autocomplete()` is used, it should be recycled until the facet is removed, at which point it is left to the browser to GC.\n. Fair enough point. This makes it easier to get a reference to the resulting VisualSearch object.\n\n```\nvar vs = VS.init(...);\n```\n\nI don't believe it's a worthwhile change, but if you feel fit to write up a pull request with this change, I wouldn't object. :-)\n. Does this patch work on the older version of jQuery UI (1.8)? I noticed you removed a preventDefault, which might have unintended consequences for the older jQuery UI.\n. That's a huge undertaking that I don't think will be happening anytime soon. If you would like to submit this as a contribution, I would consider a pull request. Good luck with that. :-)\n. Not sure I understand the issue. I think what you're getting at is that you want to prevent a search from going through if it matches the previous search? I think you should handle this in your implementation and response functions, not in the visualsearch code.\n. Yep, it's easy. Just perform a search with:\n\n```\nvisualSearch.searchBox.value(\"Country: US State: \\\"New York\\\" Key: Value\")\n```\n. Just upgraded to latest jQuery and jQuery UI.\n. Just added a callback to it, which you can hook onto with a `removedFacet` callback.\n\n```\nremovedFacet : function (facet, query, options) {\n  this.app.options.callbacks.removedFacet(facet, query, options);\n}\n```\n. You'll want to build a new view that uses that data you get from `visualSearch.searchQuery.facets()`. The view for that organizer is on the document-cloud repo: https://github.com/documentcloud/documentcloud/blob/master/public/javascripts/ui/organizer/organizer.js.\n. That's out of scope for this project, but I would just add a flag with a key and value. Instead of ShowOnlyNew, change it to show: new vs. show:all (default).\n. Looks good. I was also able to repro the bug and this fixed it. Thanks!\n. Fixed in #100. Thanks for this! I'll be upgrading the libraries momentarily...\n. Having built the original on Backbone.js, I think there is almost no possible way for this is to rewritten with Angular.js support without a complete rewrite. You might as well start a new project.\n. There is support! You just need to implement the logic yourself in the `valueMatches` and `facetMatches` callbacks.\n. Thank you!\n. Well, try to determine how much space you have and limit your facet results/values to only 2 or 3 at a time. Otherwise, see if you can integrate it into the page, since an iframe will never let things like that bleed over the border.\n. This is out of scope for the project, but you shouldn't have much of a problem implementing that with a medium dose of JS.\n. The idea is that the search box matches perfectly what's being sent. I suppose this could change, but it's non-trivial and quite a departure from knowing that the query you see is the query that gets sent.\n. Problem is that for version 0.5.0 they all use template variables. I'd be open to a pull request if somebody wants to take the time to rewrite the templates so that they no longer rely on Underscore's _.template.\n. Thanks for this PR, but it needs to follow the convention of the source code around it. Also, I'm not sure what it does, as it looks like it doesn't work. Feel free to fix it up and provide a test case.\n. Thanks!\n. I'm wondering if it's a jQuery 2.0 bug. Try using jQuery 1.10, which is the only supported version.\n. Rranauro's right, just make sure you've included all of the dependencies. Compare the dependencies listed by your browser on http://documentcloud.github.io/visualsearch/ to your own site.\n. See those callbacks in the `facetMatches` on the VS.js homepage? Stick your ajax call in there, and on success, return your data with the callback function.\n. If you go to the visualsearch.js homepage and open the console and type `visualSearch.searchBox.value()`, you should get a single string anyhow. You're probably using `visualSearch.searchQuery.facets()` which gives you the full facet models.\n. I'm not getting the issue in Safari, Firefox, or Chrome. I _just_ updated all dependencies to latest (backbone, underscore, query, and jquery UI), so I bet that this issue is now fixed.\n. I accepted the PR, but why bother binding to the removeFacets event? By removing a facet, a search event is triggered. Wouldn't that be better to watch, since you can just remain stateless and search on the new query.\n. As you can see with the comment above the search box's removedFacet method, I write:\n\n```\n// When removing a facet, potentially do something. For now, the adjacent\n// remaining facet is selected, but this is handled by the facet's view,\n// since its position is unknown by the time the collection triggers this\n// remove callback.\nremovedFacet : function (facet, query, options) { ... }\n```\n\nSo you're not going to have a reference to what was just deleted, so why not just listen to the search event?\n. Is this my code or your code? As for this.box being undefined, check your reference and see what the `this` keyword points to.\n. Thanks for this PR. This is quite a big one, so I'll only have time to look at it in a few weeks. Ping me if it takes too long. This will require some testing and verification.\n. Thanks! They should update http://bower.io/docs/creating-packages/, which still shows:\n\n```\n{\n  \"name\": \"my-project\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"main\": \"path/to/main.css\",\n  \"ignore\": [\n    \".jshintrc\",\n    \"**/*.txt\"\n  ],\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"<name>\": \"<version>\",\n    \"<name>\": \"<folder>\",\n    \"<name>\": \"<package>\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"<test-framework-name>\": \"<version>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n. You could just add a check to the blur callback for any difference between the latest query and a cached value of the last search query.\n. To achieve what you want just turn the `autosearch` option false. Search the codebase for references to `app.options.autosearch`. This turns off automatic searching when removing facets and autocompleting facets.\n. Also, it shouldn't be blurring the input on tab. If that's happening thats a bug and should be filed separately. Make sure you mention your browser and OS.\n. ",

    "tswicegood": "fyi, @delambo, if you include the \"@\" before a name, it'll show up as a notification to the person if they aren't participating.  Not sure if @samuelclay is getting notifications here or not beyond what @jashkenas said.\n\nI'm on the fence about this change.  Do you need both `query` and `queryObj` to be passed in?  I'd prefer one or the other as they seem to provide duplicate data.  I lean toward including a real object instead of a string as I think that's more useful, but I wonder if we shouldn't just pass the raw `Collection` in.  That provides a lot more functionality than a simple value object and makes sure that any changes made during search are propagated back up the chain (not that it's a good idea to change them during the `searchEvent`, but\u2026)\n\nOne other thing I would add here is turning the search callback to `function(query, callback)` and use `callback` to determine whether it passed or failed.  That allows it to fail asynchronously and brings it in line with `facetMatches` and `valueMatches`.\n. Not sure I follow on the \"VS.js instance-based\" comment.  Something like:\n\n  var myVS = VS.init({})\n  myVS.search.count()\n\n??  That could work, but I do like the idea of each callback being handed the data that makes sense for it to have.  That makes it easier to re-use callbacks across multiple instances.\n. Hope it wasn't too presumptive of me, but I went ahead and committed the rebuilt versions that include the new code.  If that gets in the way of a merge due to conflicts, let me know and I'll revert that commit.\n. For the `valueMatches` I actually have a working copy locally that delegates everything to the server side along the lines of (possible encoding issues aside):\n\n```\nvalueMatches : function(category, callback) {\n  $.getJSON(\"http://example.com/search/values/?category=\" + category, callback);\n},\nfacetMatches : function(callback) {\n  $.getJSON(\"http://example.com/search/facets/\", callback);\n}\n```\n\nI think both `valueMatches` and `facetMatches` are going to be dynamic like these in a lot of cases.  If the facets change, it gets tricky to handle all of the `<type>Matches()`.  Thoughts?\n. This probably still needs some work, but it's starting down the right path and `demo.html` works with two different VS boxes.\n. This is ready.  TL;DR, `VS.init` still works, but it returns a `VS.Instance` object and all of the internals are updated to use that rather than the `VS.app` global object.  There was talk about making the syntax `new VisualSearch(\"#some_selector\")`, but that's not BC.  Might be a better long-term solution, but my goal was to make it work. :-)\n\nAny comments or feedback?\n.

That can be done, but my thought is that someone wanting to hook into something that deep into VS is going to go looking. :-)\n. heh - ignore my comments.  I forgot that most of the web still requires a reload to make sure you're looking at the latest.\n\nThanks for the quick merge.\n. Big +1 on this.  We've got some code in hatband that needs it.\n. fyi, @delambo, if you include the \"@\" before a name, it'll show up as a notification to the person if they aren't participating.  Not sure if @samuelclay is getting notifications here or not beyond what @jashkenas said.\n\nI'm on the fence about this change.  Do you need both `query` and `queryObj` to be passed in?  I'd prefer one or the other as they seem to provide duplicate data.  I lean toward including a real object instead of a string as I think that's more useful, but I wonder if we shouldn't just pass the raw `Collection` in.  That provides a lot more functionality than a simple value object and makes sure that any changes made during search are propagated back up the chain (not that it's a good idea to change them during the `searchEvent`, but\u2026)\n\nOne other thing I would add here is turning the search callback to `function(query, callback)` and use `callback` to determine whether it passed or failed.  That allows it to fail asynchronously and brings it in line with `facetMatches` and `valueMatches`.\n. Not sure I follow on the \"VS.js instance-based\" comment.  Something like:\n\n  var myVS = VS.init({})\n  myVS.search.count()\n\n??  That could work, but I do like the idea of each callback being handed the data that makes sense for it to have.  That makes it easier to re-use callbacks across multiple instances.\n. Hope it wasn't too presumptive of me, but I went ahead and committed the rebuilt versions that include the new code.  If that gets in the way of a merge due to conflicts, let me know and I'll revert that commit.\n. For the `valueMatches` I actually have a working copy locally that delegates everything to the server side along the lines of (possible encoding issues aside):\n\n```\nvalueMatches : function(category, callback) {\n  $.getJSON(\"http://example.com/search/values/?category=\" + category, callback);\n},\nfacetMatches : function(callback) {\n  $.getJSON(\"http://example.com/search/facets/\", callback);\n}\n```\n\nI think both `valueMatches` and `facetMatches` are going to be dynamic like these in a lot of cases.  If the facets change, it gets tricky to handle all of the `<type>Matches()`.  Thoughts?\n. This probably still needs some work, but it's starting down the right path and `demo.html` works with two different VS boxes.\n. This is ready.  TL;DR, `VS.init` still works, but it returns a `VS.Instance` object and all of the internals are updated to use that rather than the `VS.app` global object.  There was talk about making the syntax `new VisualSearch(\"#some_selector\")`, but that's not BC.  Might be a better long-term solution, but my goal was to make it work. :-)\n\nAny comments or feedback?\n. Already a step ahead of you.  `grep` was how I found all of them in the first place. :-)\n\nChanged the name in c76409995471a83e9ee897982658f6217a9b8b50, so I think we're ready.\n.

For example: the \"search\" and the \"facetMatches\" callbacks are not being called after a date is selected. The user has to click outside the date input (and inside the search box) to make theese callbacks work.\n. ",
