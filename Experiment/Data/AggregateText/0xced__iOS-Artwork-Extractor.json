I get 64 images with all the toolbar items when running on an iPhone 4 **device** on iOS 5.0.1.\n. This is fixed in 5324568bf1f10493865f61cddd2e0a477352ab0c.\n. It is possible to extract artwork from Apple apps by mounting a decrypted iOS firmware before running the extractor. I will soon add a wiki entry to explain how you mount a decrypted iOS firmware.\n. You can find instructions to [mount a decrypted iOS firmware](https://github.com/0xced/UIKit-Artwork-Extractor/wiki/Extracting-more-artwork) on the wiki.\n. The `UIGlassButton` class was simply removed in iOS 5.1. If you want the glossy button feature, you have to download the iOS 5.0 simulator.\n\nI will remove the glossy button tab when `UIGlassButton` is not available.\n.

I just tried with Xcode 4.4.1 (4F1003) / iPhone Simulator 5.1 on Mountain Lion 10.8.1 Build 12B19 and I experienced no problem at all. Is there a log in your console that could give us more information about the problem you are experiencing?\n.

If it\u2019s inside the Maps app, you should be able to extract it from a iOS firmware, see [Extracting more artwork](../wiki/Extracting-more-artwork) for instructions.\n. Your problem is impossible to diagnose without more information.\n. iOS Artwork Extractor is not intended to be run on a device but in the simulator only, I should probably make that clear in the README.\n\nIndeed, all images are kept in memory, there is no cell reuse and basically the whole code is crap. I\u2019ve thought about improving all this for years but I never did it. So there is a good chance that I will not improve it in the years to come since it's working fine in the simulator. ;-)\n. By default, _iOS Artwork Extractor_ searches for IPAs in `~/Music/iTunes/Mobile Applications` and `~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Mobile Applications`. If your iTunes library is not there, just set the `MOBILE_APPLICATIONS_DIRECTORY` environment variable to the full path of your `Mobile Applications` directory.\n. This is a duplicate of #18. iOS Artwork Extractor is not meant to be run on a device.\n. It should be fixed now. If it still doesn\u2019t work, you can set the `ARTWORK_DIRECTORY` environment variable to choose where you want to save the png files.\n.
