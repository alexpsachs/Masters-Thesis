Good catch! I'll do it after compatible with Rails3\n. Done in version 1.1.1\n. Shame on me, but gon now not compatible with Rails 3. I'm on it now\n. Very strange - I created new environment just like yours and can't repeat this problem..\n. The problem here was only in assign variables in view, not in controller. What is your workflow?\n. Thank's man! It was very helpful! I made refactoring of jbuilder module and now it seems it's work with partials)\n. Thanks! Fixed in 2.0.6\n. Yes, I think it's a good point, I'll add it soon. Btw - thanks for the great screencast! :)\n. done)\n. Done in 2.2.0. Thank you for idea, usage with rabl and jbuilder looks better now)\n. Thank you! It's great when there is some great responses about work, which can improve this work)\n. Thank you for pull request! Can you add one thing to it - raising error in case when user will try to use rabl method and don't add 'gem \"rabl\"' to gemfile? Like here for Jbuilder: https://github.com/gazay/gon/blob/master/lib/gon.rb#L80\n\nAlex\n. Thank you! Great catch!\n. Thanks for issue and sorry for delay!) I fixed it with adding check for request object_id in include_gon method. Now it will be draw some code only if it's right request and if there are some variables\n. New minor version soon.\n. Now I just added helper from rails 3-2-stable branch - escape_javascript - for javascript strings. Later I'll test it more and maybe change logic if there will be problem with unicodes that you named here.\n\nThank you for your response and I hope you enjoy gon gem)\n. Escape \"</\" to \"<\\/\" done in new minor version. If you can write some tests for other line terminators - it will be great!\n. Hey @thbar! Yes, it escapes. Why do you ask?\n. Hello! Sorry for big delay, I did whole refactoring of gon this month. So I fixed this problem with including ActionView::Helpers into Rails::Engine. Now it's only in my refactoring branch - https://github.com/gazay/gon/commit/7a4f50f0f443294e659b6c7117fb18215fc80c22\nBut soon I plan to merge it in master. What do you think? I checked that this including not affects Rabl functionality by running Rabl's specs with included helpers.\n. Thanks for your investigation! Helper was added only for a while, as fast fix from airport - today-tomorrow i'll rewrite it for properly working with strings\n. Thanks for issue! Can you provide here some gist with your workflow? Because data in window.gon it's just regular json object.\n. Can you provide example of data? What exactly looks like objects in @all_states, what shows in view when you use javascript_tag and when gon.allstates.\n\nThanks)\n. Still can't understand the problem, sorry. Maybe you can provide some simple sample app where it appears?\n. Thanks, I'll add that note to readme and btw you can in your case, if order of gems is important, load Gon::Rabl module manually - \n\n``` ruby\nrequire 'gon/rabl'\n```\n. The thing is that Rabl is not default functionality of gon, so if you want to use rabl - you'll add it before in gemfile, in other cases you'll get exception from gon.rabl method. If you can advice how to make it better - I'll really like pull requests)\n\nBefore I added rabl by default, but not all people use it and it's not cool to force people to get some unused dependencies in their repos.\n. It fixed by notice in docs\n. Hello! No, there should be an error rising if you try to use one of gon's public methods. Look https://github.com/gazay/gon/blob/master/lib/gon.rb#L47\n. Oh. This make sense - I should write more tests for public methods - maybe there is some vulnerability of my gem. I'll write here later about status. Thank you for pointing me on this!)\n. I'm talking about not getting error. I have one test for this case, but seems like this not enough. And people somehow can get information from gon methods. Maybe I should make this methods private\n. I almost done refactoring of gon in branch \"refactoring\", so it will be fixed in new version\n. Yes, it's ok, because gon works through include_gon helper, which adds js tag with global object gon and your variables in your template.\n. Thank you for your response! It's very important to me)\n\nI understood what you talking about, but no - now Gon is only request dependent. I think I can make something like not request dependent hash store for global variables - it's a good idea. But I think there I need new syntax for it. Maybe something like gon.global.variable_name or global_gon. If you want to provide pull request - it will be great, or I'll do it when I have more time)\n. In version 3.0.0 I added Gon.global feature which can be reached from anywhere in rails application\n. I not really understand case for this question. Can you provide here what exactly you want to do? Gon object - it's just global visible json object through window.gon, so you can use it if it's on the page in every javascript which you can change.\n. Whoa! Good news) Thanks for pull request!\n. yes, gon takes variables only from controller. I think now about global gon variables, which you can add from anywhere, like application_controller or views. Will add this functionality soon.\n. Done in version 3.0.0\nIn readme is example about using new Gon.global feature. With Gon.global.clear you can do what you want in views\n. Yep, thanks! Btw you can look into branch refactoring - there are a lot of changes and new feature - global variables.\n. Did the Jasmine run environment of application? If it is - you can use new global variables, which can be managed in any area of rails app which uses gon.\nI'm sorry, I'm not really deep into Jasmin testing, so I don't really know how it can work. I just know that Jasmine run some js files in template page and it's not really dependent on rails application.\n. Cool! I want to cover all options with specs - maybe you can provide spec for this option? And add description for this option in Readme?\n\nThanks!\n. Thanks, I did it now. Waiting for new cool ideas)\nhttps://github.com/gazay/gon/commit/725e14dd22008a80dc6da059dddd0cf948b0d17c\n. Hello, can you provide a little bit more information about your environment, because on new rails app with gon 3.0.2 and rabl and jbuilder I have normal assets path through helpers:\n\n`Gemfile`\n\n``` ruby\ngem 'rails', '3.2.3'\ngem 'rabl'\ngem 'jbuilder'\ngem 'gon', '3.0.2'\n```\n\n`home/index.html.erb`\n\n``` erb\n<h1>Hello</h1>\n<%= path_to_image('rails.png') %>\n```\n\nresult - http://cl.ly/0N422w0R1m3w0v2N231d\n. any updates?\n. Hello, thanks for issue.\nYes, now I eval code of jBuilder templates inside JbuilderTemplate#encode method without including there any rails helpers. I'll add it later.\n. I think not only routes helpers needed here. All ActionView::Helpers should be included\n. @dziulius hello, what do you mean? what specs doesn't work?\n. btw in v3.0.4 all helpers, include route helpers are works as I tested. I'll write new tests for it now, but I think this issue solved\n. Hello, can someone help me with this issue - can you provide sample application with failing spec? Then I'll fix it asap :) Thank you all!\n. It's pretty clear what to do here - there not real request goes to gon from rspec - TestRequest goes. So there should be done some switch for env.test?. It's different issue, so I'll close this one and open new one for testing environment case.\n. Hello, it's easy to do as you described - just add this line in format.html block:\n\n``` ruby\nrespond_to do |format|\n    format.html do\n       gon.rabl \"app/views/customers/new.json.rabl\", as: \"customers\"\n       gon.rabl \"app/views/analytics/customers.json.rabl\", as: \"analytics\"\n    end\n    format.json { @customers = @account.customers.include_account }\nend\n```\n\nIn `as` option you set variable name inside gon namespace for rabl template data - so with html request you get two variables inside gon: `gon.customers` with data from `app/views/customers/new.json.rabl` and `gon.analytics` with data from `app/views/analytics/customers.json.rabl`\n\nThanks for using gem! :)\n. Hey! Thanks for response!\n\nDid you try this on new application or just on your app? What logic in your root action?\n. I'm sorry but I can't reproduce this bug on new rails app, and don't know your environment. If you can do some debug or tests - it will be helpful! And of course it will be super if you can do pull request with tests for this case or fix for this bug :)\n. I advice to create some initializer for gon and create global variables there if it's possible (if there no dynamic variables). If not - you should do some singleton method which should check define of global variables and place it before call.\n. Yes, it should) If all will be ok - please close the issue)\n. I found bug I think, I'll do new version tomorrow\n\nThanks!\n\nAbout usage sections - I thought there are all simple - you pass some option to include gon and it's change you end javascript\n. fixed in 3.0.4\n. Hello, thanks for pull\n\nI think it's make sense, because before I did it compatible only with right js rendering https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionpack/lib/action_view/helpers/javascript_helper.rb#L8.\nData inside gon object is a json, so I think we need to add all escaping symbols from AS json encoding module. And fix failing specs ;) Can you do it and provide couple of specs for new encoding values?\n. Heh, Rails is old too. javascript helper is still maintained and good for plain js (agreed - not for json).\nAbout mass exporting data to json - there is an old code which wasn't rewritten from first version, I think I will rewrite all work with options soon because amount of options is too damn high.\nAbout setting escape_html_entiites_in_json from my gem, or advice to do it from readme - I don't want to do it. As I think the right way is to realize own escaping/encoding module/method than change something global in framework.\n. escaped now\n. Sorry, but I don't know. Didn't use backbone at all yet)) If you'll do this or find the example - tell me please, I'm interesting in it too\n. Hello, @hzyh64160! Maybe if you can write some instructions or example for it - it will be great and I'll put it in wiki\n. @hzyh64160 thank you!\n. Thank you! Already added to wiki https://github.com/gazay/gon/wiki/Usage-gon.rabl-with-Backbone.js\n. Thank you for response! I'll document it as I documented same thing in Rabl usage section. Don't really want to do hard dependency on rabl or jbuilder, because it all optional.\n. Done here https://github.com/gazay/gon/wiki/Usage-with-jbuilder\n. I think it is, I'll do some research for next version)) Maybe you can help me with patch for this? Do you think it is better if there will be a warning? I think throwing error with description what people should do for fix it woud be better\n. Fixed. Soon will be release of 4.0.0\n. Thank you for response!\n\nAll clear here, I'll fix it right when have some time to do opensource) Hope will do it soon.\n. Fixed. Soon will be release of 4.0.0\n. I'm sorry, but I'll be on vacation soon. So if you'll do some research and do pull request - it will be super great!))\n\nI want to comeback to maintain this gem after vacation - 2-3 weeks, but I glad that you use this gem and try to find some capabilities to use it :) If you'll share to me your experience of usage this gem I'll can do my work better\n\nThank you)\n. Because of architecture of jbuilder. It is replaces flow of usual rendering, so it allow you to render only once through controller action. That's why I have to partially replace jbuilder functionality (in Rabl I can simply call Rabl::Engine#render method). But it was a year ago - maybe now there is a different situation and if you can help with research - it will be super awesome.\n\nAnyway thank you that you somehow interested in gon and find time to write me some response!\n. Hello! \n\nDidn't receive case like this before. Can you attach more info - where you calling gon helper and what is trace for message?\n. That's strange. Don't really know what to advice except debugging. This behavior tells that all problem in your server, and what is this problem exactly you can find only after some investigation - maybe there something wrong with Gemfile, or bundler didn't run or something else. Sorry that I can't help you :(\n and for my English of course :)\n. I'm sorry, but I'll be on vacation soon. So if you'll do some research and do pull request - it will be super great!))\n\nI want to comeback to maintain this gem after vacation - 2-3 weeks, but I glad that you use this gem and try to find some capabilities to use it :) If you'll share to me your experience of usage this gem I'll can do my work better\n\nThank you)\n. @benniemietz there is a functionality in version 4.0.0 which allow you to get any variable from controller by ajax request, please look this wiki page - https://github.com/gazay/gon/wiki/Usage-gon-watch\n\nIf it doesn't help you - can you describe problem with full example? I mean step-by-step.\n\n@perkins2099 maybe you should try to use global gon variables, or functionality gon.watch? Do you call controller through ajax? What kind of variable you try to renew?\n. Gon.watch functionality works right now only like getter in JS, it don't change original object window.gon.watchedVariables.\n\nSo you can get your current value like this:\n\n``` javascript\nvar newVal = gon.watch('var_name');\nif (newVal == gon.watchedVariables['var_name']) {\n...\n```\n. Is it work with rails 2.3 too? Nice pull by the way)\n. Ok, I'll check it later. Thanks man!)\n. Why not :smiley: \n\nCan you provide pull with tests for it?\n. Done in 4.0.1. Will push it soon\n. Do you mean with old versions of JBuilder? I think we just need to check version of jbuilder in blankslate requirement check. Can you provide patch?\n\nThank you for issue!\n. It seems that we don't need to require BlankSlate anymore at all. I checked different versions with different rails envs, and I don't see exceptions like before. So I removed requirement of blankslate now, it will be in v4.0.1 soon.\n\nThank you for your help!\n. Great! Thank you. I'll research failing spec and merge your pull after\n. I merged and checked, we don't need to require BlankSlate at all. It will be in 4.0.1 soon. Thank you!\n. Thank you, will fix it this weekend\n. Done\nhttps://github.com/gazay/gon/wiki/Usage-with-RABL\n. Thank you! It's done\n. Nice one, I'll look what can be done with it on this weekend:) Thank you!\n. Done in 4.0.1, will push it soon\n. Here is the doc for locals with rable usage: https://github.com/gazay/gon/wiki/Usage-with-RABL\n\nActually just as in rabl and everywhere.\n. Hello, thank you for your response, but it's still used as helper, you can see it in module Helpers, which included in ActionController::Base class: https://github.com/gazay/gon/blob/master/lib/gon/helpers.rb#L43\n\nYou can use Gon.global instead of gon.global, because it do not depend on current request object id, but other functionality do, so I suggest you use helper instead on class in other than global cases.\n. Thank you for issue, I'll check it as soon as possible:)\n. Sorry for delay, I checked by myself and I get right requests to server with code you provided. Can you show server log for 500 error?\n. Thank you :)\n. Thank you, maybe you can provide pull request?\n. Don't really know case where it can be needed and as said @topdev - it isn't sounds secure\n\nClosing\n. Thank you for issue! I will look into on weekend\n. Just pushed new version with fixes - 4.0.2. Should be all ok now)\n. Yes, gon require Ruby 1.9+ because of early versions of jBuilder and because I like ruby 1.9 syntax :) You can create your own fork and replace all hashes with hashrocket syntax. And maybe there is couple other places where needed changes. If you will - I can look into later and help you.\n. Sorry for delay, I will check it soon and write to you results :)\n. Great @fermuch! I think I missed here `to_json` call on value https://github.com/gazay/gon/blob/master/lib/gon/watch.rb#L50. I have to check it\n. Hm, I'm not sure that this will be right. Because then people will not find why they don't receive variable as they expect without any explanation why that's happened. Maybe you have some logs where those bugs appeared? I need to understand cases when Request cannot be available in usual rails flow.\n. By those backtraces - I have no idea what's happening with request. I'm thinking how we can gracefully save and present data if we'll catch this error. Do you have any ideas?\n. `Gon::Request is not nil, otherwise the error would be undefined method gon.` - yes, I meant rails request which should be written in `@request_env`. Really rare there can be situation when object_id of rails request object can be same as previous. But I don't see the problem here - you can just have old data in Gon.all_variables.\n\n`Is there anyway to call 'gon' in the controller that gets a reference to Gon without checking wrong_gon_request?` - no. You can try to assign variables right to `Gon` constant, but if you not override `gon` helper in controller with something - there should be checking for request id.\n\n`Is there anyway @request_env is getting changed after it has been set?` - yes, it's always changed when you assign variables to gon, because gon uses as storage `request.env['gon']`.\n. I have no progress on this one. If someone can explain or point me direction - feel free to reopen this PR.\n\nClosing\n. Of course. You just need to work with Gon constant, not with the gon helper.\nFor example you have class Some:\n\n``` ruby\n# lib/some.rb\nclass Some\n\n  def self.set_gon(val)\n    Gon.from_some = val\n  end\n\nend\n```\n\nIn controller you just call method of Some:\n\n``` ruby\n# app/controllers/home_controller.rb\n...\n  Some.set_gon Time.now\n...\n```\n\nThen you will receive value of gon.from_some variable in your js as usual.\n. Of course you can use all parts of gon gem without using special helpers which been made just for simplicity. I need to understand your scope of use gon gem in your new gem, then I can help you. Thank you for issue!\n. As you can see from source of Gon::Helpers - analogue for include gon can be just rendering all variables by yourself. Can you explane to me more about your usage of gon for I can help you more?\n. @mrded - if I understand you right - you can try to override one of methods from rendering stack I think.\n\n@fbrusatti - analogue of `include_gon` is method `Gon::Base.render_data` with options as required argument. So you can just rename your file `application.js` to `application.js.erb` and put there a string: `<%= Gon::Base.render_data({}) %>` Or with options you want.\n. Hello! Thanks for patch! I think we need to restrict type of `data` object in method `push` to Hash only (or to object which respond_to method `each_pair`). Can you provide tests with different types of object sent to `push` and add constraints?\n. Great - I'll be waiting. I love this new syntax - with it one can just pass options or some parameters to gon and pairs from it will be as separate variables in js.\n. Cool! Thanks a lot!)\n. I've added support for `locals` to jbuilder. Controller helpers next in queue\n. in v 5.2.2 added support for controller helpers in jbuilder\n. Great! I need some time to analyze those commits. As I understand - I don't need to merge previous pull if I merge this one?\n. I really like it! so it'll be great if you change docs for it :)\n. Thanks man!\n. Oh, sorry guys. I think problem is that I haven't release new version with this syntax yet. I'll do it right now. Sorry again.\n. Alex = Alexey in my case ;)\n\nHello!\n\nYes, I like this, I need to test it and look closely by myself. I'll try to do it before weekend, but deadline will be at the sunday)\n\nThank you for PR! Hope you enjoy using this project)\n\nP.s. if you have any ideas for features \u2013 please write me a letter. I want to improve this gem and need more experience of usage and more thoughts about what is missed or what can make work with this gem better.\n. Yes, I think that there should be compatibility for old version. Can you add some check for rails version and maybe it will be easiest if for old versions will work old code.\n. Hmm, I haven't see any incompatibilities with old 3.x versions. And I don't really want care from version 4.1.0 for rails < 3.x and ruby < 1.9.x - so I'll merge it!\n\nThank you very much\n. :+1: Thank you!\n\np.s. I'm not sure that I'll care in future versions about compatibility with 1.8.7, so I'll do version bump after this PR.\n. It depends on what do you want to do and in what environment) Can you explain more detailed?\n. `Gon::Helpers` constant contains method for render data in views: `include_gon`. As I can understand - you want to assign some variables in gon in your helper. Then you need to include constant `Gon::GonHelpers`, which add `gon` instance method. If it's not enough - you can write your own proxy method to work with gon - you can trace example how it works by debugging simple assign variable in controller action, and I can explain details later.\n. Oh, you right. I checked it when this issue was added in wrong way. Will be fixed ASAP\n. Thanks guys! Fast-fixed in 4.1.1, more carefully will check this problem later. If you have any other extreme cases with escaping - please create issues or drop me line to email (alex.gaziev(at)gmail.com) and we'll discuss them.\n. Hello, thank you for pull request. Maybe you should try to use gon.global functionality? It's allow you to share any data you want across all application and you will not loose any data with new requests.\n. @mirelon I'm not sure how this PR should works, maybe you can add some tests which show me what you want to add? And how it will affect other functionalities? \n\n@coderdave It's sad that gon not fits for your purposes. As I don't work with turbolinks right now I don't think that I can add support for it in gon in near future. But if you will have some time and feel that you can help - it will be awesome!\n. I think I understood what you want to do here, but it will not work this way. Better for multi requests without wiping old data you should use gon global (look at it in wiki). You can set variable once there and it will be available anywhere in your project and you will decide when clear this variable.\n\nClosing\n. Hello! Thank you for issue. Because of jBuilder architecture I had to create special environment to evaluate jBuilder templates code. Because of that I believe you receive that kind of exception. Can you try to assign current_user to some instance variable and use it in locals statement? I have plans to get deeper in this, but right now I have no time :(\n. Watch.js right now used as storage for function of gon.watch implementation and it loads into constant of Gon::Watch module one time when this module loads. This function pretty small and before it was in this module - I moved it because I don't want to have JS in ruby file. Gon::Watch works next way: after you used gon.watch helper inside your controller action and assigned to it some variable, Gon::Base.render_data will check about watched variables and if there are some - it will include this JS function (gon.watch) before JS gon object. This function was written in pure JS so I hope there should not be problems with JS errors like missed jQuery or something like that. Why do you need this function separate from usage of gon.watch in your controller? Also the reason why I preffer this way - this javascript function should be before JS code (assets) which can use this function for watched gon variables.\n. Let me close this inactive issue\n. Thank you for issue! Unfortunately I haven't touch rails 4 because of scope of my current work. I'll try to dig into by myself when I get some time but it will be super if can help me to realize where is the problem or maybe make some falling test) Thanks again!\n. Not yet =(\n. I can't reproduce this on new rails 4 application. Helper is working for me. Can someone provide simple app which reproduce this issue please?\n. So I still can't reproduce not working helper in rails 4. It was stopper for release new version, and I think without sample application with not working gon helper I'll release new version in few days without some fixes for this issue.\n. Thanks a lot, I'll dig into it\n. @sebastialonso try new 5.0.4 version, it should work without workarounds.\n. @vorDd can  you tell what exactly was the problem? I'll try to research it\n. Hello all! Please provide smallest app which reproduces this error \u2013 when I'm creating new rails 4.0-4.2 apps I don't have any problem with `include_gon` helper. But maybe I'm using wrong web server (for reproducing needed puma for example or something else). Please help me to trace this error, I'm in process of refactoring and test covering gon for new version and it would be great if in new version it would be fixed.\n. @TheDerek can you provide example app that reproduces this error please? In my new projects on rails 4.0-4.2 I can't reproduce it.\n. Hello! Sorry for delay - so much work right now. I think it's a great idea and I'd like to accept PR like this. Also I think that you can do couple options for camel_casing - recursively camel_casing, when all hashes and all hashes in hashes etc in gon variables will be camel_cased. And second - just for some deep, which by default will be for example 1 - so it will work like your example. What do you think? Or I missed something?\n. Great! If you still want it - will wait for your PR :) And some tests also would be great\n. Thank you for your issue and sorry for long delay. I'll plan to fix gon for rails 4 and with it I'll update installation page. I'll let you know in this issue. Also it's related to https://github.com/gazay/gon/issues/90\n. Nice one! I'll review it tomorrow, thank you!\n. Cool! Thank you very much! Maybe you can also provide a little text for readme for this option?\n. Or I'll do it by myself, I just looked into my page for options - there just example of usage for each option :)\n. I have to go through issue with running on rails 4 and then will be release. Right now I don't know when I'll have time for this,hopefully on this weekend or next week\n. Thank you a lot! Sorry for delay!\n. Hello! Thank you for your PR! Can you please squash commits and I'll merge it?\n. Great!\n. Sure, I want to spend some time to make gon compatible with rails 4 without problems on this weekend and then I'll make new version)\n. Cool, thanks for idea! I'll look into it\n. If you have time to help with gon project - can you please check master branch in your threaded applications to confirm that last merge helped with threadsafety https://github.com/gazay/gon/commit/cd0a5a1ecf72457762fcf6e3fb333309f9f9170b\n. @kgx cool! Thanks for checking!) About `request.uuid` \u2013 as I understood from rails source it can be used instead `request.id`, but gon works only inside rails application, so `request.id` should fit for its purposes well.\n. Thanks)\n. Thanks)\n. Yes it's really good point! I think I should put it in readme. Thank you!\n. @Gailbear it would be great if you help me with this!) I'm not using turbolinks in my current projects and don't have enought time to get into the problem\n. Great, @shadowed87, maybe you see how we can include this solution in gon library? Maybe add special option and readme section for it?\n. Thank you!\n. Hi all! Thanks for report, will try to investigate it ASAP. @Nejuf - is there more stack trace?\n@hau, can you tell me what is on pages_controller.rb:12? Can you repeat this exception with `gsub` locally?\n\nAnyway I'll try to find what is wrong there today.\n. It seems that I've fixed problem with missed gon method for Nil object. It's already published in 5.0.1\n\nStill digging about gsub method\n. @hau, I can't reproduce it locally. I think it can be data-related bug. If you can provide failing example - I'll fix it right then. But now I don't know what it can be, I've tried your code with my data and it just works.\n. @pkpp1233 that's interesting! Can you please provide stacktrace for 4.1.0 and 5.0.1? \n. @forest @gregmolnar can you please check that current in master fixed the problem? Thanks!\n. Thank you! So I release new version then.\n. Cool! Sorry for delayed answer\n\nThank you very much\n. Super!\n. I don't think that this is good solution. There can be conflicts for different requests if it would be stored in global variable. Also it can affect flow with usage global scope in gon.\n. The problem is that this creation of gon object not really right. I'll use your commit and rewrite a little. Thank you for help!\n. That is strange. In each request it calls Gon.clear which clear current gon data. Can you check with gon version 5.0.2?\n. Thank you! Yes, I think one of possible solutions is to create middleware like in request_store. But also I think we can simply check `wrong_gon_request?` in `include_gon` helper here - https://github.com/gazay/gon/blob/master/lib/gon/helpers.rb#L11. And clear it if it is wrong. What do you think?\n\nIt would be awesome if you can write this integration test!\n. hm, I'll change it back because travis also doesn't accept this syntax.\n. Thank you for report!)\n. Hm. I think you right. It's request specific, so if you someone don't want render watch variables on current page - just don't use gon.watch in controller.\n\nDo you want to make PR?\n. Great!)\n. Thank you for issue! I hope I fix the problem - please check v5.0.4 - it should work there.\n. Thank you!!\n. If there will be no fast fixes - maybe in month or two. I want to do couple of things before new version\n. Hello! Interesting case! Yeah, gon jbuilder now is not really dynamic and fully compatible. I think we can try to do something like done here https://github.com/gazay/gon/blob/master/lib/gon/jbuilder.rb#L61. But I'm not sure yet.\n. Thank you for issue! Can you please provide full stack trace and example how you use gem?\n. Anyway it is and issue and add section to wiki is a good idea) Thank you, I'll do it soon.\n. Thank you for issue! Maybe it's related to some user's input in data you sending with gon? Maybe something in department_list? I think we need more debug info to understand what happened here. Maybe you can add some silent logger which will react on this kind of error and write environment somewhere?\n. Awesome! Thank you!\n. Yes, it's good idea! Naming always was a problem for me (Gon - ?!). Can you provide PR?\n. Problem is not solved yet as because of specific of jbuilder's rendering process I had to write own parser for its templates. Right now I don't have time and need to fix partial functionality in jbuilder module in gon but I can help if someone want to help with it =)\n. I don't know the current situation, but when I added it, there was no explicit parser/renderer/engine included. So you can't do as in rabl, for example, `re = Rabl::Engine.new...; re.render`. Jbuilder is highly tied with Rails rendering stack, and you can't use it standalone which I needed for render templates and put them into JSON.\n. In Rails 5 will be rendering instrument that allow to throw away all Gon::Jbuilder::Parser logic and just render jbuilder template (https://medium.com/evil-martians/new-feature-in-rails-5-render-views-outside-of-actions-2fc1181e86a8)\n. It will call double render error if you use it in controller\n. Hello! Thank you for PR, but it breaks specs. Also it was made for thread safe purposes\n. Actually I think that this was written in early versions of gem and not really helps with thread-safety. It's strange that specs falling then. I'm looking what is wrong here\n. It seems that something changed in ruby in last releases, PR wasn't related to travis falls)\n. I like it! Let's try)\n. I think we can add hook which will check version of rails and use appropriate method to get id of request. Can you do it?\n. Thank you! It's awesome!\n. Try to act like with Hash. gon.global.delete(key)\n. Thank you!\n. Hello! Thank you for issue. The thing is that gon works only inside one request - `redirect_to` is a new request. That's why all variables for previous request don't match for current request and delete. You can pass variables through several requests with Gon.global or with other ways like you described with `flash`.\n. Gon global mostly for constant values from app initialization which you want to access everywhere. It's not threadsafe.\n. We've released version 5.1.1 which should resolve this problem.\n. Thank you!!\n. Hello. No, it's not possible because `gon` is a helper, which works with internal gon storage and do all magic. If you use @gon it will be simple instance variable of controller.\n. Cool! Thank you for PR. Can you please fix spec and I'll merge it\n. Thank you!\n. Nice!!\n. Thank you!!\n. Hello! Thank you for PR. I think better to make it configurable and off by default for now, as it's not major feature. But when there will be next major release I'll switch it to on by default.\n. namespace_check sounds good) Also can you please add note about this configuration in readme?\n. Better on wiki yes. Thank you for your PR!\n. Thank you!\n. Looks great! Can you please add description of this feature to Readme or provide text for wiki page. After merge I'll bump version. Thank you!\n. Great! Thank you!\n. I don't really like how it looks and as it is legal and only in tests I'll leave the old version. But I'm really happy that you use Gon and find time to make this pull request! Thank you very much!\n. Hello! Can you try to reproduce it on fresh rails app? Can you provide example of code?\n. Should be solved by PR above. New version soon, for now please use master\n. hm, travis failed with strange error. I'll test your fix and if all ok - merge it. Thank you very much for PR!\n. Thank you for PR and idea! But I think that this behavior isn't clear for end user. Maybe better if this feature act somehow like that? :\n\n```\ngon.var = { a: 1 }\ngon.merge_or_set.var = { b: 2 }\n```\n. Thank you!\n. It sounds useful for me!) Please send pull request and i'll merge it.\n\nActually it wasn't compiled from coffee, it was written by my good friend @kossnocorp in js and i never touched it after) It can be written also in coffee - I would be really grateful if you provide this implementation)\n. Welcome!) I don't really know what will be the best for this coffee and js files in gon. Maybe asset pipeline should include it when you require gem or something else. Maybe you have an idea?\n\nThank you for this pull request!)\n. Nice! Thank you!\n. Hello! But gon.watch is not a variable - it is a function. https://github.com/gazay/gon/wiki/Usage-gon-watch\n. Actually I see more problems with watch now - it ignores namespace option.\n\nAnyway - how you think it can be solved?\n. Hello! I'm not using turbolinks and can't help you with that fast. Maybe you have an idea why it is happening? It would be really great if you can do some research :)\n\nThank you for the issue! And for using gon\n. Hello, thank you for issue. Can you please provide simple app with failing test? Or at least example code of failing test. Thank you in advance\n. Great, downloading\n. Nice! Thank you\n. Great! Thank you!\n. Hello, yes it is expected behavior as gon using metaprogramming to set variables as methods of gon class. So it doesn't allow to use public methods as variable names because it can break functionality of whole gem. Please try different name, like `user_name`\n. https://github.com/gazay/gon/blob/master/lib/gon.rb#L39 you can find this functionality here\n. Thank you!\n. Thank you!\n. Sure! This information is in usage section: https://github.com/gazay/gon#usage\n. No problem =)\n. Ah sorry, I went to quickly in issue, so I misunderstood you. Do you mean I need to provide information about internal gon flow, how it stores data from action and then renders it in view? But I thought it is pretty clear \u2013 it just stores data for current request inside Gon RequestStore, then when view calls include_gon \u2013\u00a0it takes it from there and converts to json and add script tag with it.\n. Hello, thank you for issue. I've fixed it in master branch, but didn't push new version of gem yet. Can you try gon from master branch?\n. Did you ran bundle install after?\n. My bad, there was a conflict and I didn't push changes. Try to `bundle update gon` and it should be fixed\n. Thank you!\n. Hello! The last version with support for 1.8.7 was 4.0.3 https://github.com/gazay/gon/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#410. I'm suggest to update Ruby if you can as 1.8.7 long time dead and not supported by Ruby team.\n. Thanks! :+1: \n. ^_^ thank you!\n. As I see, the reason of this behavior is that you use something like turbolinks or similar instrument, which re-render only part of the view and don't touch gon area\n. Great! Thank you! Do you want to take part in developing gon gem?\n. I've made you collaborator of gon gem =) Welcome! There a lot of issues I don't have time or environment to check, if you help to clean up it \u2013\u00a0it would be great =)\n. I've created slack channel to discuss issues and features. Please join (send me email to alex.gaziev@gmail.com and I'll send you invite)\n. Fixed @ai, thank you!\n. @ai v6.0.0\n. Great, Thank you!\n. I just not really understand why it happening? `_o` is an OpenStruct object, and don't have methods from ActionView\n. We're using gon in our projects and I didn't see this problem after update. Anyway it's good to rename just to `need_tag` as `tag` option was excess. Can you provide full backtrace of error?\n. I see. Anyway it is a good pull request, thank you =)\n. Hello! Yes, the problem I see is that you using reserved method name for gon - `env`. Maybe not only this method. I'll add more descriptive message for this error\n. Hello Dave!\n1. You can't access gon object from anywhere except controllers and views as it is just a helper. You can access Gon::Global instead and in js it will be available from gon.global namespace.\n\nLet I tell you how gon works and maybe you'll find solution for your task faster (as I maybe don't understand partially what you want to achieve by using sidekiq for different pages):\n1. You have different routes which point to different controller actions. Let say we have root (Home#index) and show (Home#show).\n2. In index you have to show all the data from your database in JS, so in action you write `gon.assets = Asset.all`, in show you need only scoped data: `gon.assets = Asset.where(page: params[:id])`.\n2'. In view layout you have `include_gon(your options)`\n3. In your browser you make root request.\n  3a. Rails receive this request and goes to `index` action of Home controller. There is our line `gon.assets = Asset.all`.\n  3b. This `gon` \u2013 is a controller helper, which checks controller's environment: gon stores inside its storage request identifier. Gon needs it to work only with data, which related just to current request. For example on next request gon still have data from first request, but as identifiers of requests doesn't match \u2013\u00a0it will erase old data.\n  3c. After gon checked and renewed request uuid \u2013 it can store data, so it does.\n  3d. Rails finishes logic in controller's action and start rendering.\n4. When rails start render it meet line `include_gon(your options)` in your layout and it is also a helper (but this time view helper, so it is accessible from views) as `gon` in controller.\n  4a. This helper also have info which request we working with (it's uuid), and it checks - is there a data it should prepare for this request\n  4b. It gather all data for this request and transform it to javascript tag with json data you can access from your javascript.\n  4c. No matter what request right now \u2013 it checks is there global data (from Gon::Global)? If it is - it will render it anyway in namespace `gon.global`.\n\nIs this helpful information? If you want more explanation or more help with your task \u2013\u00a0please describe why you want to use sidekiq? If this is a static data and should be available on many pages \u2013\u00a0you can just render it once in js.erb file and include it in custom layout for those pages. It will be faster than using gon.\n. By default, unless you use option `camel_cased: true` in `include_gon` method, your variable names in JS should be equal to names from Ruby.\n. After action callback runs after rendering phase of action. Gon renders its data during rendering phase. So it's expected behavior. Thank you for issue!\n. We need to check since what version of rails `env` available from request. Thank you for your PR!\n. Thank you @dlupu & @takiy33 !\n. v 6.1.0 pushed\n. Hello, you can use `need_tag: false` option https://github.com/gazay/gon/wiki/Options#need_tag--true\n. thank you!\n. Thank you\n. depends. It is the same as if you expose same tokens in your html \u2013\u00a0anyone, who can access developer console can find it\n. Hello! Do you pass include_gon without arguments?\n. Can you provide full backtrace for error?\n. @nazrulcse it seems you have super old version of multi_json (from 2011), method encode back then accepted only one argument - object itself. In later releases they added second argument - options. Gon uses this param. So try to update multi_json to latest releases and it should fix the problem\n. Hello! Thank you for issue. Can you do a PR?\n. Looks good for me :) Thank you!\n. Hello! Thank you for issue. This option not really for that - it just renders `window.gon={}` on each request, even if there are no gon variables set. How it fixes `uncaught reference error` I don't really understand, but if you can create small app which shows this problem \u2013 I can debug and fix it properly. Thank you! Is that error happened in development mode or in production too?. I've started your project without `init: true` option and on root route (`localhost:3000/`) exception didn't happened \u2013 where it was?. Thanks!. Whoa! That looks awesome :) Thank you!. I've released 6.2.0 but it seems something changed and specs are not green now. I'll look why later. Thank you :). Thanks!\nI don't know, maybe later. If needs everyone can create in theirs js files object like:\n\nvar SomeName = new Gon()\n. nice!\n. Yep, i know. Now it stores all data and doesn't clear it.

It seems that solution provided by sergio-fry not\nrelated to gon usage, it looks just like helper which partially replaces\nfunctionality of gon.

Good catch! I'll do it after compatible with Rails3\n. Done in version 1.1.1\n. Shame on me, but gon now not compatible with Rails 3. I'm on it now\n. Very strange - I created new environment just like yours and can't repeat this problem..\n. The problem here was only in assign variables in view, not in controller. What is your workflow?\n. Thank's man! It was very helpful! I made refactoring of jbuilder module and now it seems it's work with partials)\n. Thanks! Fixed in 2.0.6\n. Yes, I think it's a good point, I'll add it soon. Btw - thanks for the great screencast! :)\n. done)\n. Done in 2.2.0. Thank you for idea, usage with rabl and jbuilder looks better now)\n. Thank you! It's great when there is some great responses about work, which can improve this work)\n. Thank you for pull request! Can you add one thing to it - raising error in case when user will try to use rabl method and don't add 'gem \"rabl\"' to gemfile? Like here for Jbuilder: https://github.com/gazay/gon/blob/master/lib/gon.rb#L80\n\nAlex\n. Thank you! Great catch!\n. Thanks for issue and sorry for delay!) I fixed it with adding check for request object_id in include_gon method. Now it will be draw some code only if it's right request and if there are some variables\n. New minor version soon.\n. Now I just added helper from rails 3-2-stable branch - escape_javascript - for javascript strings. Later I'll test it more and maybe change logic if there will be problem with unicodes that you named here.\n\nThank you for your response and I hope you enjoy gon gem)\n. Escape \"</\" to \"<\\/\" done in new minor version. If you can write some tests for other line terminators - it will be great!\n. Hey @thbar! Yes, it escapes. Why do you ask?\n. Hello! Sorry for big delay, I did whole refactoring of gon this month. So I fixed this problem with including ActionView::Helpers into Rails::Engine. Now it's only in my refactoring branch - https://github.com/gazay/gon/commit/7a4f50f0f443294e659b6c7117fb18215fc80c22\nBut soon I plan to merge it in master. What do you think? I checked that this including not affects Rabl functionality by running Rabl's specs with included helpers.\n. Thanks for your investigation! Helper was added only for a while, as fast fix from airport - today-tomorrow i'll rewrite it for properly working with strings\n. Thanks for issue! Can you provide here some gist with your workflow? Because data in window.gon it's just regular json object.\n. Can you provide example of data? What exactly looks like objects in @all_states, what shows in view when you use javascript_tag and when gon.allstates.\n\nThanks)\n. Still can't understand the problem, sorry. Maybe you can provide some simple sample app where it appears?\n. Thanks, I'll add that note to readme and btw you can in your case, if order of gems is important, load Gon::Rabl module manually - \n\n``` ruby\nrequire 'gon/rabl'\n```\n. The thing is that Rabl is not default functionality of gon, so if you want to use rabl - you'll add it before in gemfile, in other cases you'll get exception from gon.rabl method. If you can advice how to make it better - I'll really like pull requests)\n\nBefore I added rabl by default, but not all people use it and it's not cool to force people to get some unused dependencies in their repos.\n. It fixed by notice in docs\n. Hello! No, there should be an error rising if you try to use one of gon's public methods. Look https://github.com/gazay/gon/blob/master/lib/gon.rb#L47\n. Oh. This make sense - I should write more tests for public methods - maybe there is some vulnerability of my gem. I'll write here later about status. Thank you for pointing me on this!)\n. I'm talking about not getting error. I have one test for this case, but seems like this not enough. And people somehow can get information from gon methods. Maybe I should make this methods private\n. I almost done refactoring of gon in branch \"refactoring\", so it will be fixed in new version\n. Yes, it's ok, because gon works through include_gon helper, which adds js tag with global object gon and your variables in your template.\n. Thank you for your response! It's very important to me)\n\nI understood what you talking about, but no - now Gon is only request dependent. I think I can make something like not request dependent hash store for global variables - it's a good idea. But I think there I need new syntax for it. Maybe something like gon.global.variable_name or global_gon. If you want to provide pull request - it will be great, or I'll do it when I have more time)\n. In version 3.0.0 I added Gon.global feature which can be reached from anywhere in rails application\n. I not really understand case for this question. Can you provide here what exactly you want to do? Gon object - it's just global visible json object through window.gon, so you can use it if it's on the page in every javascript which you can change.\n. Whoa! Good news) Thanks for pull request!\n. yes, gon takes variables only from controller. I think now about global gon variables, which you can add from anywhere, like application_controller or views. Will add this functionality soon.\n. Done in version 3.0.0\nIn readme is example about using new Gon.global feature. With Gon.global.clear you can do what you want in views\n. Yep, thanks! Btw you can look into branch refactoring - there are a lot of changes and new feature - global variables.\n. Did the Jasmine run environment of application? If it is - you can use new global variables, which can be managed in any area of rails app which uses gon.\nI'm sorry, I'm not really deep into Jasmin testing, so I don't really know how it can work. I just know that Jasmine run some js files in template page and it's not really dependent on rails application.\n. Cool! I want to cover all options with specs - maybe you can provide spec for this option? And add description for this option in Readme?\n\nThanks!\n. Thanks, I did it now. Waiting for new cool ideas)\nhttps://github.com/gazay/gon/commit/725e14dd22008a80dc6da059dddd0cf948b0d17c\n. Hello, can you provide a little bit more information about your environment, because on new rails app with gon 3.0.2 and rabl and jbuilder I have normal assets path through helpers:\n\n`Gemfile`\n\n``` ruby\ngem 'rails', '3.2.3'\ngem 'rabl'\ngem 'jbuilder'\ngem 'gon', '3.0.2'\n```\n\n`home/index.html.erb`\n\n``` erb\n<h1>Hello</h1>\n<%= path_to_image('rails.png') %>\n```\n\nresult - http://cl.ly/0N422w0R1m3w0v2N231d\n. any updates?\n. Hello, thanks for issue.\nYes, now I eval code of jBuilder templates inside JbuilderTemplate#encode method without including there any rails helpers. I'll add it later.\n. I think not only routes helpers needed here. All ActionView::Helpers should be included\n. @dziulius hello, what do you mean? what specs doesn't work?\n. btw in v3.0.4 all helpers, include route helpers are works as I tested. I'll write new tests for it now, but I think this issue solved\n. Hello, can someone help me with this issue - can you provide sample application with failing spec? Then I'll fix it asap :) Thank you all!\n. It's pretty clear what to do here - there not real request goes to gon from rspec - TestRequest goes. So there should be done some switch for env.test?. It's different issue, so I'll close this one and open new one for testing environment case.\n. Hello, it's easy to do as you described - just add this line in format.html block:\n\n``` ruby\nrespond_to do |format|\n    format.html do\n       gon.rabl \"app/views/customers/new.json.rabl\", as: \"customers\"\n       gon.rabl \"app/views/analytics/customers.json.rabl\", as: \"analytics\"\n    end\n    format.json { @customers = @account.customers.include_account }\nend\n```\n\nIn `as` option you set variable name inside gon namespace for rabl template data - so with html request you get two variables inside gon: `gon.customers` with data from `app/views/customers/new.json.rabl` and `gon.analytics` with data from `app/views/analytics/customers.json.rabl`\n\nThanks for using gem! :)\n. Hey! Thanks for response!\n\nDid you try this on new application or just on your app? What logic in your root action?\n. I'm sorry but I can't reproduce this bug on new rails app, and don't know your environment. If you can do some debug or tests - it will be helpful! And of course it will be super if you can do pull request with tests for this case or fix for this bug :)\n. I advice to create some initializer for gon and create global variables there if it's possible (if there no dynamic variables). If not - you should do some singleton method which should check define of global variables and place it before call.\n. Yes, it should) If all will be ok - please close the issue)\n. I found bug I think, I'll do new version tomorrow\n\nThanks!\n\nAbout usage sections - I thought there are all simple - you pass some option to include gon and it's change you end javascript\n. fixed in 3.0.4\n. Hello, thanks for pull\n\nI think it's make sense, because before I did it compatible only with right js rendering https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionpack/lib/action_view/helpers/javascript_helper.rb#L8.\nData inside gon object is a json, so I think we need to add all escaping symbols from AS json encoding module. And fix failing specs ;) Can you do it and provide couple of specs for new encoding values?\n. Heh, Rails is old too. javascript helper is still maintained and good for plain js (agreed - not for json).\nAbout mass exporting data to json - there is an old code which wasn't rewritten from first version, I think I will rewrite all work with options soon because amount of options is too damn high.\nAbout setting escape_html_entiites_in_json from my gem, or advice to do it from readme - I don't want to do it. As I think the right way is to realize own escaping/encoding module/method than change something global in framework.\n. escaped now\n. Sorry, but I don't know. Didn't use backbone at all yet)) If you'll do this or find the example - tell me please, I'm interesting in it too\n. Hello, @hzyh64160! Maybe if you can write some instructions or example for it - it will be great and I'll put it in wiki\n. @hzyh64160 thank you!\n. Thank you! Already added to wiki https://github.com/gazay/gon/wiki/Usage-gon.rabl-with-Backbone.js\n. Thank you for response! I'll document it as I documented same thing in Rabl usage section. Don't really want to do hard dependency on rabl or jbuilder, because it all optional.\n. Done here https://github.com/gazay/gon/wiki/Usage-with-jbuilder\n. I think it is, I'll do some research for next version)) Maybe you can help me with patch for this? Do you think it is better if there will be a warning? I think throwing error with description what people should do for fix it woud be better\n. Fixed. Soon will be release of 4.0.0\n. Thank you for response!\n\nAll clear here, I'll fix it right when have some time to do opensource) Hope will do it soon.\n. Fixed. Soon will be release of 4.0.0\n. I'm sorry, but I'll be on vacation soon. So if you'll do some research and do pull request - it will be super great!))\n\nI want to comeback to maintain this gem after vacation - 2-3 weeks, but I glad that you use this gem and try to find some capabilities to use it :) If you'll share to me your experience of usage this gem I'll can do my work better\n\nThank you)\n. Because of architecture of jbuilder. It is replaces flow of usual rendering, so it allow you to render only once through controller action. That's why I have to partially replace jbuilder functionality (in Rabl I can simply call Rabl::Engine#render method). But it was a year ago - maybe now there is a different situation and if you can help with research - it will be super awesome.\n\nAnyway thank you that you somehow interested in gon and find time to write me some response!\n. Hello! \n\nDidn't receive case like this before. Can you attach more info - where you calling gon helper and what is trace for message?\n. That's strange. Don't really know what to advice except debugging. This behavior tells that all problem in your server, and what is this problem exactly you can find only after some investigation - maybe there something wrong with Gemfile, or bundler didn't run or something else. Sorry that I can't help you :(\n and for my English of course :)\n. I'm sorry, but I'll be on vacation soon. So if you'll do some research and do pull request - it will be super great!))\n\nI want to comeback to maintain this gem after vacation - 2-3 weeks, but I glad that you use this gem and try to find some capabilities to use it :) If you'll share to me your experience of usage this gem I'll can do my work better\n\nThank you)\n. @benniemietz there is a functionality in version 4.0.0 which allow you to get any variable from controller by ajax request, please look this wiki page - https://github.com/gazay/gon/wiki/Usage-gon-watch\n\nIf it doesn't help you - can you describe problem with full example? I mean step-by-step.\n\n@perkins2099 maybe you should try to use global gon variables, or functionality gon.watch? Do you call controller through ajax? What kind of variable you try to renew?\n. Gon.watch functionality works right now only like getter in JS, it don't change original object window.gon.watchedVariables.\n\nSo you can get your current value like this:\n\n``` javascript\nvar newVal = gon.watch('var_name');\nif (newVal == gon.watchedVariables['var_name']) {\n...\n```\n. Is it work with rails 2.3 too? Nice pull by the way)\n. Ok, I'll check it later. Thanks man!)\n. Why not :smiley: \n\nCan you provide pull with tests for it?\n. Done in 4.0.1. Will push it soon\n. Do you mean with old versions of JBuilder? I think we just need to check version of jbuilder in blankslate requirement check. Can you provide patch?\n\nThank you for issue!\n. It seems that we don't need to require BlankSlate anymore at all. I checked different versions with different rails envs, and I don't see exceptions like before. So I removed requirement of blankslate now, it will be in v4.0.1 soon.\n\nThank you for your help!\n. Great! Thank you. I'll research failing spec and merge your pull after\n. I merged and checked, we don't need to require BlankSlate at all. It will be in 4.0.1 soon. Thank you!\n. Thank you, will fix it this weekend\n. Done\nhttps://github.com/gazay/gon/wiki/Usage-with-RABL\n. Thank you! It's done\n. Nice one, I'll look what can be done with it on this weekend:) Thank you!\n. Done in 4.0.1, will push it soon\n. Here is the doc for locals with rable usage: https://github.com/gazay/gon/wiki/Usage-with-RABL\n\nActually just as in rabl and everywhere.\n. Hello, thank you for your response, but it's still used as helper, you can see it in module Helpers, which included in ActionController::Base class: https://github.com/gazay/gon/blob/master/lib/gon/helpers.rb#L43\n\nYou can use Gon.global instead of gon.global, because it do not depend on current request object id, but other functionality do, so I suggest you use helper instead on class in other than global cases.\n. Thank you for issue, I'll check it as soon as possible:)\n. Sorry for delay, I checked by myself and I get right requests to server with code you provided. Can you show server log for 500 error?\n. Thank you :)\n. Thank you, maybe you can provide pull request?\n. Don't really know case where it can be needed and as said @topdev - it isn't sounds secure\n\nClosing\n. Thank you for issue! I will look into on weekend\n. Just pushed new version with fixes - 4.0.2. Should be all ok now)\n. Yes, gon require Ruby 1.9+ because of early versions of jBuilder and because I like ruby 1.9 syntax :) You can create your own fork and replace all hashes with hashrocket syntax. And maybe there is couple other places where needed changes. If you will - I can look into later and help you.\n. Sorry for delay, I will check it soon and write to you results :)\n. Great @fermuch! I think I missed here `to_json` call on value https://github.com/gazay/gon/blob/master/lib/gon/watch.rb#L50. I have to check it\n. Hm, I'm not sure that this will be right. Because then people will not find why they don't receive variable as they expect without any explanation why that's happened. Maybe you have some logs where those bugs appeared? I need to understand cases when Request cannot be available in usual rails flow.\n. By those backtraces - I have no idea what's happening with request. I'm thinking how we can gracefully save and present data if we'll catch this error. Do you have any ideas?\n. `Gon::Request is not nil, otherwise the error would be undefined method gon.` - yes, I meant rails request which should be written in `@request_env`. Really rare there can be situation when object_id of rails request object can be same as previous. But I don't see the problem here - you can just have old data in Gon.all_variables.\n\n`Is there anyway to call 'gon' in the controller that gets a reference to Gon without checking wrong_gon_request?` - no. You can try to assign variables right to `Gon` constant, but if you not override `gon` helper in controller with something - there should be checking for request id.\n\n`Is there anyway @request_env is getting changed after it has been set?` - yes, it's always changed when you assign variables to gon, because gon uses as storage `request.env['gon']`.\n. I have no progress on this one. If someone can explain or point me direction - feel free to reopen this PR.\n\nClosing\n. Of course. You just need to work with Gon constant, not with the gon helper.\nFor example you have class Some:\n\n``` ruby\n# lib/some.rb\nclass Some\n\n  def self.set_gon(val)\n    Gon.from_some = val\n  end\n\nend\n```\n\nIn controller you just call method of Some:\n\n``` ruby\n# app/controllers/home_controller.rb\n...\n  Some.set_gon Time.now\n...\n```\n\nThen you will receive value of gon.from_some variable in your js as usual.\n. Of course you can use all parts of gon gem without using special helpers which been made just for simplicity. I need to understand your scope of use gon gem in your new gem, then I can help you. Thank you for issue!\n. As you can see from source of Gon::Helpers - analogue for include gon can be just rendering all variables by yourself. Can you explane to me more about your usage of gon for I can help you more?\n. @mrded - if I understand you right - you can try to override one of methods from rendering stack I think.\n\n@fbrusatti - analogue of `include_gon` is method `Gon::Base.render_data` with options as required argument. So you can just rename your file `application.js` to `application.js.erb` and put there a string: `<%= Gon::Base.render_data({}) %>` Or with options you want.\n. Hello! Thanks for patch! I think we need to restrict type of `data` object in method `push` to Hash only (or to object which respond_to method `each_pair`). Can you provide tests with different types of object sent to `push` and add constraints?\n. Great - I'll be waiting. I love this new syntax - with it one can just pass options or some parameters to gon and pairs from it will be as separate variables in js.\n. Cool! Thanks a lot!)\n. I've added support for `locals` to jbuilder. Controller helpers next in queue\n. in v 5.2.2 added support for controller helpers in jbuilder\n. Great! I need some time to analyze those commits. As I understand - I don't need to merge previous pull if I merge this one?\n. I really like it! so it'll be great if you change docs for it :)\n. Thanks man!\n. Oh, sorry guys. I think problem is that I haven't release new version with this syntax yet. I'll do it right now. Sorry again.\n. Alex = Alexey in my case ;)\n\nHello!\n\nYes, I like this, I need to test it and look closely by myself. I'll try to do it before weekend, but deadline will be at the sunday)\n\nThank you for PR! Hope you enjoy using this project)\n\nP.s. if you have any ideas for features \u2013 please write me a letter. I want to improve this gem and need more experience of usage and more thoughts about what is missed or what can make work with this gem better.\n. Yes, I think that there should be compatibility for old version. Can you add some check for rails version and maybe it will be easiest if for old versions will work old code.\n. Hmm, I haven't see any incompatibilities with old 3.x versions. And I don't really want care from version 4.1.0 for rails < 3.x and ruby < 1.9.x - so I'll merge it!\n\nThank you very much\n. :+1: Thank you!\n\np.s. I'm not sure that I'll care in future versions about compatibility with 1.8.7, so I'll do version bump after this PR.\n. It depends on what do you want to do and in what environment) Can you explain more detailed?\n. `Gon::Helpers` constant contains method for render data in views: `include_gon`. As I can understand - you want to assign some variables in gon in your helper. Then you need to include constant `Gon::GonHelpers`, which add `gon` instance method. If it's not enough - you can write your own proxy method to work with gon - you can trace example how it works by debugging simple assign variable in controller action, and I can explain details later.\n. Oh, you right. I checked it when this issue was added in wrong way. Will be fixed ASAP\n. Thanks guys! Fast-fixed in 4.1.1, more carefully will check this problem later. If you have any other extreme cases with escaping - please create issues or drop me line to email (alex.gaziev(at)gmail.com) and we'll discuss them.\n. Hello, thank you for pull request. Maybe you should try to use gon.global functionality? It's allow you to share any data you want across all application and you will not loose any data with new requests.\n. @mirelon I'm not sure how this PR should works, maybe you can add some tests which show me what you want to add? And how it will affect other functionalities? \n\n@coderdave It's sad that gon not fits for your purposes. As I don't work with turbolinks right now I don't think that I can add support for it in gon in near future. But if you will have some time and feel that you can help - it will be awesome!\n. I think I understood what you want to do here, but it will not work this way. Better for multi requests without wiping old data you should use gon global (look at it in wiki). You can set variable once there and it will be available anywhere in your project and you will decide when clear this variable.\n\nClosing\n. Hello! Thank you for issue. Because of jBuilder architecture I had to create special environment to evaluate jBuilder templates code. Because of that I believe you receive that kind of exception. Can you try to assign current_user to some instance variable and use it in locals statement? I have plans to get deeper in this, but right now I have no time :(\n. Watch.js right now used as storage for function of gon.watch implementation and it loads into constant of Gon::Watch module one time when this module loads. This function pretty small and before it was in this module - I moved it because I don't want to have JS in ruby file. Gon::Watch works next way: after you used gon.watch helper inside your controller action and assigned to it some variable, Gon::Base.render_data will check about watched variables and if there are some - it will include this JS function (gon.watch) before JS gon object. This function was written in pure JS so I hope there should not be problems with JS errors like missed jQuery or something like that. Why do you need this function separate from usage of gon.watch in your controller? Also the reason why I preffer this way - this javascript function should be before JS code (assets) which can use this function for watched gon variables.\n. Let me close this inactive issue\n. Thank you for issue! Unfortunately I haven't touch rails 4 because of scope of my current work. I'll try to dig into by myself when I get some time but it will be super if can help me to realize where is the problem or maybe make some falling test) Thanks again!\n. Not yet =(\n. I can't reproduce this on new rails 4 application. Helper is working for me. Can someone provide simple app which reproduce this issue please?\n. So I still can't reproduce not working helper in rails 4. It was stopper for release new version, and I think without sample application with not working gon helper I'll release new version in few days without some fixes for this issue.\n. Thanks a lot, I'll dig into it\n. @sebastialonso try new 5.0.4 version, it should work without workarounds.\n. @vorDd can  you tell what exactly was the problem? I'll try to research it\n. Hello all! Please provide smallest app which reproduces this error \u2013 when I'm creating new rails 4.0-4.2 apps I don't have any problem with `include_gon` helper. But maybe I'm using wrong web server (for reproducing needed puma for example or something else). Please help me to trace this error, I'm in process of refactoring and test covering gon for new version and it would be great if in new version it would be fixed.\n. @TheDerek can you provide example app that reproduces this error please? In my new projects on rails 4.0-4.2 I can't reproduce it.\n. Hello! Sorry for delay - so much work right now. I think it's a great idea and I'd like to accept PR like this. Also I think that you can do couple options for camel_casing - recursively camel_casing, when all hashes and all hashes in hashes etc in gon variables will be camel_cased. And second - just for some deep, which by default will be for example 1 - so it will work like your example. What do you think? Or I missed something?\n. Great! If you still want it - will wait for your PR :) And some tests also would be great\n. Thank you for your issue and sorry for long delay. I'll plan to fix gon for rails 4 and with it I'll update installation page. I'll let you know in this issue. Also it's related to https://github.com/gazay/gon/issues/90\n. Nice one! I'll review it tomorrow, thank you!\n. Cool! Thank you very much! Maybe you can also provide a little text for readme for this option?\n. Or I'll do it by myself, I just looked into my page for options - there just example of usage for each option :)\n. I have to go through issue with running on rails 4 and then will be release. Right now I don't know when I'll have time for this,hopefully on this weekend or next week\n. Thank you a lot! Sorry for delay!\n. Hello! Thank you for your PR! Can you please squash commits and I'll merge it?\n. Great!\n. Sure, I want to spend some time to make gon compatible with rails 4 without problems on this weekend and then I'll make new version)\n. Cool, thanks for idea! I'll look into it\n. If you have time to help with gon project - can you please check master branch in your threaded applications to confirm that last merge helped with threadsafety https://github.com/gazay/gon/commit/cd0a5a1ecf72457762fcf6e3fb333309f9f9170b\n. @kgx cool! Thanks for checking!) About `request.uuid` \u2013 as I understood from rails source it can be used instead `request.id`, but gon works only inside rails application, so `request.id` should fit for its purposes well.\n. Thanks)\n. Thanks)\n. Yes it's really good point! I think I should put it in readme. Thank you!\n. @Gailbear it would be great if you help me with this!) I'm not using turbolinks in my current projects and don't have enought time to get into the problem\n. Great, @shadowed87, maybe you see how we can include this solution in gon library? Maybe add special option and readme section for it?\n. Thank you!\n. Hi all! Thanks for report, will try to investigate it ASAP. @Nejuf - is there more stack trace?\n@hau, can you tell me what is on pages_controller.rb:12? Can you repeat this exception with `gsub` locally?\n\nAnyway I'll try to find what is wrong there today.\n. It seems that I've fixed problem with missed gon method for Nil object. It's already published in 5.0.1\n\nStill digging about gsub method\n. @hau, I can't reproduce it locally. I think it can be data-related bug. If you can provide failing example - I'll fix it right then. But now I don't know what it can be, I've tried your code with my data and it just works.\n. @pkpp1233 that's interesting! Can you please provide stacktrace for 4.1.0 and 5.0.1? \n. @forest @gregmolnar can you please check that current in master fixed the problem? Thanks!\n. Thank you! So I release new version then.\n. Cool! Sorry for delayed answer\n\nThank you very much\n. Super!\n. I don't think that this is good solution. There can be conflicts for different requests if it would be stored in global variable. Also it can affect flow with usage global scope in gon.\n. The problem is that this creation of gon object not really right. I'll use your commit and rewrite a little. Thank you for help!\n. That is strange. In each request it calls Gon.clear which clear current gon data. Can you check with gon version 5.0.2?\n. Thank you! Yes, I think one of possible solutions is to create middleware like in request_store. But also I think we can simply check `wrong_gon_request?` in `include_gon` helper here - https://github.com/gazay/gon/blob/master/lib/gon/helpers.rb#L11. And clear it if it is wrong. What do you think?\n\nIt would be awesome if you can write this integration test!\n. hm, I'll change it back because travis also doesn't accept this syntax.\n. Thank you for report!)\n. Hm. I think you right. It's request specific, so if you someone don't want render watch variables on current page - just don't use gon.watch in controller.\n\nDo you want to make PR?\n. Great!)\n. Thank you for issue! I hope I fix the problem - please check v5.0.4 - it should work there.\n. Thank you!!\n. If there will be no fast fixes - maybe in month or two. I want to do couple of things before new version\n. Hello! Interesting case! Yeah, gon jbuilder now is not really dynamic and fully compatible. I think we can try to do something like done here https://github.com/gazay/gon/blob/master/lib/gon/jbuilder.rb#L61. But I'm not sure yet.\n. Thank you for issue! Can you please provide full stack trace and example how you use gem?\n. Anyway it is and issue and add section to wiki is a good idea) Thank you, I'll do it soon.\n. Thank you for issue! Maybe it's related to some user's input in data you sending with gon? Maybe something in department_list? I think we need more debug info to understand what happened here. Maybe you can add some silent logger which will react on this kind of error and write environment somewhere?\n. Awesome! Thank you!\n. Yes, it's good idea! Naming always was a problem for me (Gon - ?!). Can you provide PR?\n. Problem is not solved yet as because of specific of jbuilder's rendering process I had to write own parser for its templates. Right now I don't have time and need to fix partial functionality in jbuilder module in gon but I can help if someone want to help with it =)\n. I don't know the current situation, but when I added it, there was no explicit parser/renderer/engine included. So you can't do as in rabl, for example, `re = Rabl::Engine.new...; re.render`. Jbuilder is highly tied with Rails rendering stack, and you can't use it standalone which I needed for render templates and put them into JSON.\n. In Rails 5 will be rendering instrument that allow to throw away all Gon::Jbuilder::Parser logic and just render jbuilder template (https://medium.com/evil-martians/new-feature-in-rails-5-render-views-outside-of-actions-2fc1181e86a8)\n. It will call double render error if you use it in controller\n. Hello! Thank you for PR, but it breaks specs. Also it was made for thread safe purposes\n. Actually I think that this was written in early versions of gem and not really helps with thread-safety. It's strange that specs falling then. I'm looking what is wrong here\n. It seems that something changed in ruby in last releases, PR wasn't related to travis falls)\n. I like it! Let's try)\n. I think we can add hook which will check version of rails and use appropriate method to get id of request. Can you do it?\n. Thank you! It's awesome!\n. Try to act like with Hash. gon.global.delete(key)\n. Thank you!\n. Hello! Thank you for issue. The thing is that gon works only inside one request - `redirect_to` is a new request. That's why all variables for previous request don't match for current request and delete. You can pass variables through several requests with Gon.global or with other ways like you described with `flash`.\n. Gon global mostly for constant values from app initialization which you want to access everywhere. It's not threadsafe.\n. We've released version 5.1.1 which should resolve this problem.\n. Thank you!!\n. Hello. No, it's not possible because `gon` is a helper, which works with internal gon storage and do all magic. If you use @gon it will be simple instance variable of controller.\n. Cool! Thank you for PR. Can you please fix spec and I'll merge it\n. Thank you!\n. Nice!!\n. Thank you!!\n. Hello! Thank you for PR. I think better to make it configurable and off by default for now, as it's not major feature. But when there will be next major release I'll switch it to on by default.\n. namespace_check sounds good) Also can you please add note about this configuration in readme?\n. Better on wiki yes. Thank you for your PR!\n. Thank you!\n. Looks great! Can you please add description of this feature to Readme or provide text for wiki page. After merge I'll bump version. Thank you!\n. Great! Thank you!\n. I don't really like how it looks and as it is legal and only in tests I'll leave the old version. But I'm really happy that you use Gon and find time to make this pull request! Thank you very much!\n. Hello! Can you try to reproduce it on fresh rails app? Can you provide example of code?\n. Should be solved by PR above. New version soon, for now please use master\n. hm, travis failed with strange error. I'll test your fix and if all ok - merge it. Thank you very much for PR!\n. Thank you for PR and idea! But I think that this behavior isn't clear for end user. Maybe better if this feature act somehow like that? :\n\n```\ngon.var = { a: 1 }\ngon.merge_or_set.var = { b: 2 }\n```\n. Thank you!\n. It sounds useful for me!) Please send pull request and i'll merge it.\n\nActually it wasn't compiled from coffee, it was written by my good friend @kossnocorp in js and i never touched it after) It can be written also in coffee - I would be really grateful if you provide this implementation)\n. Welcome!) I don't really know what will be the best for this coffee and js files in gon. Maybe asset pipeline should include it when you require gem or something else. Maybe you have an idea?\n\nThank you for this pull request!)\n. Nice! Thank you!\n. Hello! But gon.watch is not a variable - it is a function. https://github.com/gazay/gon/wiki/Usage-gon-watch\n. Actually I see more problems with watch now - it ignores namespace option.\n\nAnyway - how you think it can be solved?\n. Hello! I'm not using turbolinks and can't help you with that fast. Maybe you have an idea why it is happening? It would be really great if you can do some research :)\n\nThank you for the issue! And for using gon\n. Hello, thank you for issue. Can you please provide simple app with failing test? Or at least example code of failing test. Thank you in advance\n. Great, downloading\n. Nice! Thank you\n. Great! Thank you!\n. Hello, yes it is expected behavior as gon using metaprogramming to set variables as methods of gon class. So it doesn't allow to use public methods as variable names because it can break functionality of whole gem. Please try different name, like `user_name`\n. https://github.com/gazay/gon/blob/master/lib/gon.rb#L39 you can find this functionality here\n. Thank you!\n. Thank you!\n. Sure! This information is in usage section: https://github.com/gazay/gon#usage\n. No problem =)\n. Ah sorry, I went to quickly in issue, so I misunderstood you. Do you mean I need to provide information about internal gon flow, how it stores data from action and then renders it in view? But I thought it is pretty clear \u2013 it just stores data for current request inside Gon RequestStore, then when view calls include_gon \u2013\u00a0it takes it from there and converts to json and add script tag with it.\n. Hello, thank you for issue. I've fixed it in master branch, but didn't push new version of gem yet. Can you try gon from master branch?\n. Did you ran bundle install after?\n. My bad, there was a conflict and I didn't push changes. Try to `bundle update gon` and it should be fixed\n. Thank you!\n. Hello! The last version with support for 1.8.7 was 4.0.3 https://github.com/gazay/gon/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#410. I'm suggest to update Ruby if you can as 1.8.7 long time dead and not supported by Ruby team.\n. Thanks! :+1: \n. ^_^ thank you!\n. As I see, the reason of this behavior is that you use something like turbolinks or similar instrument, which re-render only part of the view and don't touch gon area\n. Great! Thank you! Do you want to take part in developing gon gem?\n. I've made you collaborator of gon gem =) Welcome! There a lot of issues I don't have time or environment to check, if you help to clean up it \u2013\u00a0it would be great =)\n. I've created slack channel to discuss issues and features. Please join (send me email to alex.gaziev@gmail.com and I'll send you invite)\n. Fixed @ai, thank you!\n. @ai v6.0.0\n. Great, Thank you!\n. I just not really understand why it happening? `_o` is an OpenStruct object, and don't have methods from ActionView\n. We're using gon in our projects and I didn't see this problem after update. Anyway it's good to rename just to `need_tag` as `tag` option was excess. Can you provide full backtrace of error?\n. I see. Anyway it is a good pull request, thank you =)\n. Hello! Yes, the problem I see is that you using reserved method name for gon - `env`. Maybe not only this method. I'll add more descriptive message for this error\n. Hello Dave!\n1. You can't access gon object from anywhere except controllers and views as it is just a helper. You can access Gon::Global instead and in js it will be available from gon.global namespace.\n\nLet I tell you how gon works and maybe you'll find solution for your task faster (as I maybe don't understand partially what you want to achieve by using sidekiq for different pages):\n1. You have different routes which point to different controller actions. Let say we have root (Home#index) and show (Home#show).\n2. In index you have to show all the data from your database in JS, so in action you write `gon.assets = Asset.all`, in show you need only scoped data: `gon.assets = Asset.where(page: params[:id])`.\n2'. In view layout you have `include_gon(your options)`\n3. In your browser you make root request.\n  3a. Rails receive this request and goes to `index` action of Home controller. There is our line `gon.assets = Asset.all`.\n  3b. This `gon` \u2013 is a controller helper, which checks controller's environment: gon stores inside its storage request identifier. Gon needs it to work only with data, which related just to current request. For example on next request gon still have data from first request, but as identifiers of requests doesn't match \u2013\u00a0it will erase old data.\n  3c. After gon checked and renewed request uuid \u2013 it can store data, so it does.\n  3d. Rails finishes logic in controller's action and start rendering.\n4. When rails start render it meet line `include_gon(your options)` in your layout and it is also a helper (but this time view helper, so it is accessible from views) as `gon` in controller.\n  4a. This helper also have info which request we working with (it's uuid), and it checks - is there a data it should prepare for this request\n  4b. It gather all data for this request and transform it to javascript tag with json data you can access from your javascript.\n  4c. No matter what request right now \u2013 it checks is there global data (from Gon::Global)? If it is - it will render it anyway in namespace `gon.global`.\n\nIs this helpful information? If you want more explanation or more help with your task \u2013\u00a0please describe why you want to use sidekiq? If this is a static data and should be available on many pages \u2013\u00a0you can just render it once in js.erb file and include it in custom layout for those pages. It will be faster than using gon.\n. By default, unless you use option `camel_cased: true` in `include_gon` method, your variable names in JS should be equal to names from Ruby.\n. After action callback runs after rendering phase of action. Gon renders its data during rendering phase. So it's expected behavior. Thank you for issue!\n. We need to check since what version of rails `env` available from request. Thank you for your PR!\n. Thank you @dlupu & @takiy33 !\n. v 6.1.0 pushed\n. Hello, you can use `need_tag: false` option https://github.com/gazay/gon/wiki/Options#need_tag--true\n. thank you!\n. Thank you\n. depends. It is the same as if you expose same tokens in your html \u2013\u00a0anyone, who can access developer console can find it\n. Hello! Do you pass include_gon without arguments?\n. Can you provide full backtrace for error?\n. @nazrulcse it seems you have super old version of multi_json (from 2011), method encode back then accepted only one argument - object itself. In later releases they added second argument - options. Gon uses this param. So try to update multi_json to latest releases and it should fix the problem\n. Hello! Thank you for issue. Can you do a PR?\n. Looks good for me :) Thank you!\n. Hello! Thank you for issue. This option not really for that - it just renders `window.gon={}` on each request, even if there are no gon variables set. How it fixes `uncaught reference error` I don't really understand, but if you can create small app which shows this problem \u2013 I can debug and fix it properly. Thank you! Is that error happened in development mode or in production too?. I've started your project without `init: true` option and on root route (`localhost:3000/`) exception didn't happened \u2013 where it was?. Thanks!. Whoa! That looks awesome :) Thank you!. I've released 6.2.0 but it seems something changed and specs are not green now. I'll look why later. Thank you :). ",

Looks like this is a [known difficulty](http://yehudakatz.com/2010/04/17/ruby-require-order-problems/), so perhaps a descriptive error is the quickest, easiest way of handling it.\n. Thanks! Sorry I couldn't submit a patch for it, wasn't quite sure what else Gon was doing, and how to ensure the context was setup correctly.\n. @gazay thanks heaps for the partial (hurr) fix, in any case!\n. I'm looking at 7c05c6efdefc41932ef1bfbba57bf221be1c948a and I don't want to be nit-picky, but should Gon be parsing the partials at all? Seems to me like Gon should set up the environment and then delegate directly to jbuilder and let it do all the partial resolving.\n\nOtherwise you are basically going to be stuck re-implementing jbuilder's code, with bugs turning up every time Gon's approach differs from jbuilder's approach. I reckon @mroseboom's issue might be solved in this approach.\n\nI recognise that \"set up the environment\" is pretty hand-wavey, and ultimately there might be a good reason not to do it this way, but I'd be interested to know your thoughts.\n. An example: I'd like to do this in a controller:\n\n```\n@widgets = current_user.widgets\ngon.jbuilder template: \"app/views/widgets/index.json.jbuilder\", as: \"widgets\"\n```\n\nWhere `widgets/index.json.jbuilder` looks like:\n\n```\njson.array!(@widgets) do |json, widget|\n  json.partial! \"widgets/widget\", widget: widget\nend\n```\n\nand `widgets/_widget.json.jbuilder` looks like this:\n\n```\njson.(widget, :id, :name, :label)\n```\n\nBut when I try it, I get: `undefined local variable or method 'workout' for Gon::Jbuilder:Module`.\n\nI'm pretty sure this is a parsing bug, but I'd rather see Gon lean on jbuilder for parsing than have it patched in Gon, if you take my meaning.\n\nNot sure if this helps!\n.

I'm looking at 7c05c6efdefc41932ef1bfbba57bf221be1c948a and I don't want to be nit-picky, but should Gon be parsing the partials at all? Seems to me like Gon should set up the environment and then delegate directly to jbuilder and let it do all the partial resolving.\n\nOtherwise you are basically going to be stuck re-implementing jbuilder's code, with bugs turning up every time Gon's approach differs from jbuilder's approach. I reckon @mroseboom's issue might be solved in this approach.\n\nI recognise that \"set up the environment\" is pretty hand-wavey, and ultimately there might be a good reason not to do it this way, but I'd be interested to know your thoughts.\n. An example: I'd like to do this in a controller:\n\n```\n@widgets = current_user.widgets\ngon.jbuilder template: \"app/views/widgets/index.json.jbuilder\", as: \"widgets\"\n```\n\nWhere `widgets/index.json.jbuilder` looks like:\n\n```\njson.array!(@widgets) do |json, widget|\n  json.partial! \"widgets/widget\", widget: widget\nend\n```\n\nand `widgets/_widget.json.jbuilder` looks like this:\n\n```\njson.(widget, :id, :name, :label)\n```\n\nBut when I try it, I get: `undefined local variable or method 'workout' for Gon::Jbuilder:Module`.\n\nI'm pretty sure this is a parsing bug, but I'd rather see Gon lean on jbuilder for parsing than have it patched in Gon, if you take my meaning.\n\nNot sure if this helps!\n.

No joe.  I deleted and recreated the example project.  Interestingly, when  `<%= include_gon :watch => true %>` is included in the application.html layout file, the value of gon.watch.top = nil when logging the result out to log each time the top method is called.  If I remove the include tag and call the top method then gon.watch.top has the result of the `top -n1 -b` call. Would there be a version conflict?\n\n```\nme@smi1:/www/testgon# rails -v\nRails 3.2.14\nme@smi1:/www/testgon# \n```\n. I'm looking at a push solution and this seemed like the lightweight solution to fit my needs.  So I tried the gon.watch.top example.  Like to the others I ran into the issue with ubuntu 12x.  Solved with suggestions posted.  However, if I use the controller variable top (gon.watch.top), gon.watch.top or gon.all_variables returns nil (logged debug).  If I change it to something else as in btop voila, values.  The next issue is the data will not update the dom element.  I get a continuous reload of the top.html.erb view but no data.  It's a copy paste example and hard to screw up.  The only change I made to example source was \"top\" to \"btop\".  A view source shows the data getting picked up by gon.watch.btop but never makes it to the DOM.  What might I be missing here?\n\nTIA!\n\n```\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>Testgon</title>\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n//<![CDATA[\nwindow.gon={};gon.btop=\"\\\"top - 11:49:31

No joe.  I deleted and recreated the example project.  Interestingly, when  `<%= include_gon :watch => true %>` is included in the application.html layout file, the value of gon.watch.top = nil when logging the result out to log each time the top method is called.  If I remove the include tag and call the top method then gon.watch.top has the result of the `top -n1 -b` call. Would there be a version conflict?\n\n```\nme@smi1:/www/testgon# rails -v\nRails 3.2.14\nme@smi1:/www/testgon# \n```\n. ",

I've noticed  that the issue goes away whenever I change some partial rendering in my app, namely when I change  `<%= render 'form' %>` to `<%= render partial: 'form' %>` Funny thing is the error only goes away until I shut down the server, whenever I start the server again I have to change that line again, only now I go from `<%= render partial: 'form' %>` to `<%= render 'form' %>` (which I thought was the problem) and it fixes things again until I restart the server\n\nYou can see my app [here](https://github.com/inigo-dev/programacion-paralela)\n\nHope it helps! \n. Hey, so I kept working on that app and realize the `<%= render partial: 'form' %>` had nothing to do with it, it actually  came down to just reloading the page. And so I realized that in my case it had to do with turbolinks, I didn't know that the `document.ready` event doesn't work with turbolinks and that I had to take into account the events fired by turbolinks. Since I didn't had much time I just removed turbolinks from my app and that solved my issue. \n. ",
