    "bramp": "Thanks qur2 for your feedback. I'm going to break this into three issues.\n1) Fix Makefile on mac #2\n2) Better documentation for setup / Example page #3\n3) Remove the use of underscore, or adapt it to be lodash compatible. #4\n. WONTFIX. This is a bug in Uglify that has been fixed mbostock/UglifyJS2@f83aca6\n. Thanks for the fix. I've tried out the make process on two of my friends Mac's, and both times it worked without the need for a temporary file. One problem we did encounter is before uglifyjs was installed it left an invalid file on the file system that caused problems when we installed uglifyjs. When we did a make clean the problem disappeared.\n\nSo, would you be so kind to try again with the existing Makefile, but this time running \"make clean\" before \"make\". I see no good reason why a temp file is needed.\n. Thanks for your help qur2. I'm going to close this as WONTFIX. It's a bug in Ugilify, that has been fixed.\n. Will do, blocked on https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams/issues/35\n. I have considered other kinds of diagrams, flow diagrams, ER diagrams. However, the biggest issue I see is that laying the diagram out in a sensible way is harder. With Sequence diagrams it is easy, as each new actor is placed to the right, and each new sequence is placed at the bottom. With a ER diagram, where does each entity go? A automatic placement might not be as nice as a manual placement.\n\nEither way, this is certainly something I will think about in the future.\n. I was not aware of PlantUML, but I will try and keep my syntax as close to their as possible. At the moment it looks like we are pretty similar.\n. Hey Pangratz, looking good thanks!\n\nI've never used grunt, so I don't know if this is the best approach or not. But it certainly removes the \"gem install jspp\" dependency that bugged me. Feel free to keep making changes, but I'm going to spend a day or so looking at grunt before I merge.\n. Hey pangratz, so I've checked out your gruntfile, and I'm now wondering if this is better than plain Makefile.\n\nPros of Grunt:\n- Handles build dependencies\n- Replaces jspp\n\nCons of Grunt:\n- Gruntfile is 88 lines, vs 38 lines of Makefile\n- No incremental builds (Makefile only runs the tasks it needs to)\n\nI'm now leaning towards the Makefile, and maybe adapting it to use npm for build deps, and come up with a better replacement for jspp.\n. Thanks for this pull request, but I'm going to close it. The Makefile solution works great, it is clean and simple, and now uses npm for all build dependencies.\n. felixcriv, can you give me a example of the code that isn't working for you?\n. I created a canvg.html test file in af152d76eccd8740c05d7a578968ade29e94dd85 and I am unable to reproduce your issue.\n\nIf you are still having the issue can you try my test file, and report what browser/os/etc you are on.\n.

Hey,\n\nThe site is using https://github.com/phaistonian/SVGInnerHTML to allow it to export the SVG. The code I use on the site looks like:\n\n``` javascript\n        download_link.click(function(ev) {\n          var svg = diagram_div.find('svg')[0];\n          var width = parseInt(svg.width.baseVal.value);\n          var height = parseInt(svg.height.baseVal.value);\n          var data = editor.getValue();\n          var xml = '<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" standalone=\"no\"?><!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD SVG 20010904//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-SVG-20010904/DTD/svg10.dtd\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"' + width + '\" height=\"' + height + '\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><source><![CDATA[' + data + ']]></source>' + svg.innerHTML + '</svg>';\n\n          var a = $(this);\n          a.attr(\"download\", \"diagram.svg\"); // TODO I could put title here\n          a.attr(\"href\", \"data:image/svg+xml,\" + encodeURIComponent(xml));\n        });\n```\n. Awesome thanks. I used it as the based, and added a few extra things: https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams/commit/e35b863c2aeb56bd9ef463a9bea288d87e9ee252\n. Dup of #12, which has already been fixed.\n. Ah, I think the tests have been broken after I moved some files around. I will fix later. FYI the tests only checked the grammar parser.\n. I have begun to add QUnit tests: https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams/commit/86fc4b6aa7284a43d1b18140a55b55750b8947cf At the moment the QUnit tests aren't automated, but will be soon.\n\nThe old \"make test\" wasn't very complete, or using any kind of testing framework. I'll leave this issue open until I automate QUnit, which might depend on pull request https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams/pull/10\n. ok all fixed now.\n. At the moment you should be able to do:\n\n`note left of Alice Line1\\nLine2\\nLine3`\n\nHowever, \n\n```\nnote left of Alice \nLine1\nLine2\nLine3\nend note\n```\n\nis also nice. I will look at adding.\n. ``` javascript\nvar diagram = Diagram.parse('...');\nconsole.log(diagram.title);\n\ndiagram.drawSVG('diagram');\n```\n. I will consider other types of UML diagrams. However, Sequence diagrams are by far the easiest to draw. Did you have a particle type of UML diagram you wanted?\n. Closing as dup of #42 \n. That's certainly a cool feature, but not one I think belongs in this\nproject.\n\nI'd imagine a new project could be built, that exported a textual diagram\nfrom code, and then my sequence diagram JavaScript could render it.\nOn Apr 2, 2013 8:38 AM, \"Chris Kimpton\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> For example,\n> \n> actor.y      = offsetY;\n> actor.height = height;\n> this.draw_text_box(actor, actor.name, ACTOR_MARGIN, ACTOR_PADDING, this._font);\n> \n> Would produce a sequence diagram roughly equivalent to\n> \n> this->actor: y\n> this->actor: height\n> this->this: draw_text_box\n> \n> Obviously this means being able to parse multiple languages...

Yes, it could be possible to plugin a new parser. In fact at the moment you\ncan see it's a two step process:\n\n``` javascript\nvar diagram = Diagram.parse($this.text());\ndiagram.drawSVG(this, options);\n```\n\nYou could replace that first step with a custom parser, and as long as it\nmakes a valid Diagram object, we are all good.\n\nAndrew\n\nOn 2 April 2013 10:22, Chris Kimpton notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Good point :)\n> \n> Would it be feasible/make sense to plugin in alternate parsers/jison\n> configs so that it could be done in one step?\n> \n> Although I can see that probably wont work - so perhaps a way of going\n> from one parsed language to another - which is what you're suggesting, I\n> guess :)\n> \n> Thanks,\n> Chris\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams/issues/26#issuecomment-15777947\n> .\n.

Thanks Dave,\n\nThis has been fixed by https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams/commit/c2a40fc3f43933e209ed51fd8f825745abba4073 . I believe it's a bug in Raphael, as the display bug doesn't occur using the version of Raphael from git.\n\nEither way, I've changed some of the text displaying code to work around the issue.\n\nthanks\n. That seems a reasonable request. I couldn't find a list on yUML for what are valid options. I could perhaps assume it is valid CSS, and style it appropriately.\n\nI will consider this for a future release. thanks\n. Yes, I eventually plan to add more syntax to the language, time permitting.\nPull requests welcome :-)\nOn Apr 17, 2013 6:49 AM, \"rjp\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Particularly alt / opt / loop?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams/issues/32\n> .\n. Hey de-coy.\n\nGood catch. I'd rather not move the Grammar into the global scope. I had a quick look at the jison source code, and I think I can make it output strict code. Failing that I'll merge your pull.\n\nthanks\n. I fixed this upstream with https://github.com/zaach/jison-lex/pull/5\n\nAs soon as a new version of jison is released I'll bump the required version, then the Grammar will pass the \"use strict\" tests.\n. Not accepting, as this was fixed by fixing jison to output strict javascript.\n. I am all for the CSS approach, however, because I'm using Rapha\u00ebl this is not possible. Rapha\u00ebl outputs either SVG or VML (on Internet Explorer). The later doesn't support styling with CSS.\n\nI think the long term solution is for me to drop Rapha\u00ebl and use a pure SVG solution. I think Rapha\u00ebl was a poor choice on my part as I keep getting blocked by it.\n. I've tried to structure the code to make that possible. For example: HandRapha\u00eblTheme extends Rapha\u00eblTheme which extends BaseTheme.\n\nYou can create a new SomethingTheme that extends BaseTheme. Then all the drawing code can go into the draw_line/draw_rect methods, and it should just work. I don't think there is any Raphael specific code in the BaseTheme.\n. Awesome, I will look as soon as I can.\nOn May 31, 2013 5:55 PM, \"de-coy\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> OK, initial version using svg.js is working on a fork.\n> Current issues:\n> - no line styles\n> - no arrow heads\n> - no css classes\n> \n> Bramp can you take a look and see if you agree it's on the right track\n> before I push on further?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams/issues/35#issuecomment-18773737\n> .\n. @de-coy I've had a look at what you are doing, and it's certainly on the right track. I think the game plan here is to finish your svg.js version, and then I'll make js-sequence-diagram support both Raphael and svg.js, but make svg.js the default. Then in future we can support CSS styles, etc.\n. @rahulsom based on a quick look at @de-coy code, I think he is still missing some features. As such I don't think his svg.js version is production ready.\n. Ok since v2.0 we use Snap.svg, which allows styling via CSS! https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams#styling\r\n\r\nI think this can now be closed.\r\n. Added https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs/pull/1316\n. I've published version 1.0.4 to cdnjs now, it's minified and has the map file. https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs/pull/1557\n. It's a bug, and one that is already fixed just not releases.\n. Fixed by 27c7a2b4fcb7b3366b9e371fde18911e08b13054\n. Good suggestion Rick. However, I'd like to keep things simple and the intention of the line to be spelt out. This also allows that syntax to be used for something else in the future.\n. No support at the moment, but I plan to add it!\n. @adrai, that is very cool! I'll add it to a list of related apps in my readme.\n. I've just added a related section in 4c64e16f366367939aa667ab396c02ed1dfef806 \n. This is a feature I plan to add, but I'm closing as this is a duplicate of issue #41 \n. I think your webserver is serving the JS with the wrong charset headers.\n\nThis is because I'm using an accented character in one of my class names. Either you fix your webserver, change the tag to say charset=... or I stop using funny characters in my class names.\n\nI'll most likely do the later.\n. This has been fixed in 6912c48502176b99c1b7b44ef9348fd2bd031526\n. Thanks\n. Saving as PNG is a little tricky. As the SVG is generated client side, the browser has to save the SVG as a PNG. A year ago when I last tried, I had mixed success getting this to work. I will revisit.\n. What you are doing seems pretty cool, but I'm not sure where the problem lies. As you point out Adobe seems to be at fault, so perhaps the rasterize.js is at fault in it's conversation from svg to pdf?\n. Did you ever dig deeper into this problem? or find a solution? If not I'm going to close this bug in a few days.\n. Closing, feel free to reopen if the problem persists.\n. Fixed by https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs/commit/e3d38d4b6b9bd74f2897696ad61335e282d0f598\n. Sounds a good idea. I will look into getting the project uploaded there.\n.

Thanks for reporting the issue. I am unable to reproduce this issue, and I didn't see any red flags in the log file.\n\nI'm going to close, but feel free to reopen if you continue to experience the issue.\n. @kapilt I don't understand your bug report. Did you file this under the wrong project? This is for js-sequence-diagrams, we have no CLI commands that print out help.\n. getPrototypeOf is coming from jison that generates the grammar. I will file a bug with them, but until then that stackoverflow post lists ways to work around this (with polyfilling)\n. The bug on jison is here: https://github.com/zaach/jison/issues/194\n\nand according to latest browser share data, IE8 makes up ~16% of the population.\n. Thanks for the report, and thanks for the grammar fix @jonasfj.\n\nThis was inadvertently fixed in 16f8ec957e0de19eb1a15432697207a0b87fda3b, and I have added a unit test (8f598c6) to ensure this doesn't happen again.\n.

This was fixed by @magnars in 4c06a396a0077ee2ba58b329fa24b6046254aaee. This should be rolled out in the latest version.\n. Sorry for not investigating this earlier. I seem unable to reproduce this issue myself, and I have since updated to the latest version of jquery.\n\nI'm going to close this bug, but feel free to reopen if the issue is persisting.\n. This javascript library is aimed at developers, so the instructions are geared towards them.\n\nTo run it locally, you'll need to get a HTML page, embed the code listed in the usage section, and then load that page via a local webserver. These are all steps that require some kind of knowledge. If you want, you can use the demo site: https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams/tree/gh-pages to help you.\n\nHowever, you should be able to run this from your laptop, as long as you have a Internet connection, by going to http://bramp.github.io/js-sequence-diagrams/\n. Thanks. This has been resolved via another commit.\n. Thanks PeterDaveHello, I'll close this issue.\n. Thanks @magnars \n. Thanks for the suggestion ComFreek. I had a similar request in #10 asking for a Grunt build file. I would be happy to evaluate Gulp (patches welcome), but it would have to provide value over Make.\n\nI don't know enough about Gulp, but for me to consider switching to it, it has to be as simple as Make, handle incremental builds, and provide all the other features Make does today. The ability to have a full JS stack + cross platform builds is certainly valuable, but of all the support emails I received, I've never had one about not being able to build on Windows. (That's not to say there isn't someone out there really trying hard to build on Windows :))\n\nLet me investigate Gulp, and get back to you.\n. This is cool, but I avoided merging as it introduces a new syntax that I'm unsure about supporting in the future. For example, we currently use Raphael that generates VML in IE, and SVG elsewhere. I'd rather change to something like svg.io dropping old IE support. Then we can use the styling native to SVG.\n. In 15b7916fd8d047e8f31f4ed956ebe01a19c54180 I've forced all build tools (jison/jshint/etc) to the latest versions, and fixed whatever needing fixing. Not only did Jison rename grammar to parser, but it now produces non-strict output, which meant I had to do this hack: 0a3c4e0c05c1150bafaa827b8743c90372b1d34a\n\nSo for now this is resolved. Thanks all for debugging.\n.  Thanks @benweet for this work. Sorry for not reviewing sooner! I've made some changes which has broken this pull request.\n\nHowever, I have some questions/comments\n1) I've pinned the jison version to the latest now (via the package.json)\n\n2) I'm unsure of the use case you describe only needing diagram-grammar.js and sequence-diagram.js, and I might have inadvertently broken that as I changed how the final file is built. Could you expand more why you would need this? I consider these files temp files that I don't want checked in.\n\n3) I would be very happy to include the AMD improvements, but again my changes might have broken this. I personally don't use AMD, but I might investigate and add myself if you no longer have time.\n. Thanks for the report. This has now been fixed.\n. Not right now. You could create the diagram, export as SVG and alter with a\nvector editing software.\n\nThere is a ticket and a branch where someone added colour and style\ninformation, but I have not merged those changes yet.\nOn Oct 13, 2014 1:26 AM, \"bing yuen\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams/issues/79.\n. Doh!, silly mistake. Thanks for the fix.\n. That is correct. An actor is defined as `[^\\->:\\n,]+`, that is one or more characters except `->:\\n,`. I could try and get creative with parsing, so that : could be somewhere within the name except at the end, however it might just get tricky.\n\nI understand how that would be inconvenient for object diagrams, but right now I don't have a good solution. I'm happy to consider alternatives, but will close this ticket until one is suggested.\n. Any reason?\n. We currently use:\n\n``` javascript\n_.all\n _.isFinite\n_.extend\n_.each\n_.defaults\n```\n\nWe could write our own alternatives, or refactor the code, however I would like to understand this requirement before I do that. If it matters, we also support lodash, in addition to underscore.\n\nI'm going to close this issue, but feel free to reopen if you are still interested.  \n. Thanks for your feedback. For now I'm going to close this, as I'm not going to fix it.\n\nHowever, incase this comes up again in the future, perhaps and alternative is I could include both Raphael and Underscore directly into sequence-diagram.js. This would mean the user would no longer need to include them as dependencies, but of course at the cost of increasing the sequence-diagram.js file size.\n. Thanks for the report. I have taken steps to correct this. Already the map is correctly reported within the minified file. Next I'm ensuring that cdnjs has a copy of the map (which currently they do not). Once cdnjs updates I'll close this bug.\n. Fixed by https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs/commit/e3d38d4b6b9bd74f2897696ad61335e282d0f598\n. # starts a comment, such as\n\n```\nA->B: something # TODO fill in more information\n```\n\nI'm not sure what a good solution to this would be. We could escape the #, such as #, or we could say comments must be the first thing on the line. I'm open to other suggestions, but I think limiting comments to being the only thing on the line might be the best solution. Assuming you are ok that actors can't begin with a #?\n. thanks!\n. Hi praveenscience,\n\nI'm unsure what problem you are having. Are you saying that your code does not correctly render?\n\nIf you want to add new syntax, you'll have to change a few different things.\n\nFirstly, you will have to change the grammar.jison to support the new \"branch\" syntax. As part of that you'll have to change the .jison and diagram.js to store that certain signals are now within a branch. I suggest you do something similar to how a Note is added.\n\nFinally you will have to change the rendering part of the diagram, in sequence-diagram.js. Code similar to what you have may work, but I would suggest using the draw_rect, draw_line, etc methods, as they will handle the styling of the line, etc.\n. Would you be willing to update the grammer tests?\n\nAndrew\nOn Jan 20, 2015 12:47 AM, \"David N.

Thanks, I've since fixed this by defaulting everything to https.\n. Thanks, I fixed the tooling in 1a4454f4b078c77, and I will push a new version to cloudflare shortly.\n. Fixed by https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs/commit/e3d38d4b6b9bd74f2897696ad61335e282d0f598\n. Which browser, OS and versions are you using? This just worked correctly for me on Chrome 42 on Mac\n. wjam@, would you be able to provide me a minimal working example of this error? (http://sscce.org/) Thanks.\n. Thanks Will.

I reported the issue here https://github.com/zaach/jison/issues/285 This should not be a problem as our minifier stripes out the non-strict portions.\n. If I understand you correctly, I think you just need to flip your arrows.\n\nInstead of C<-B, write B->C.\n. Would you show me the resulting image with your change. I would like to\nunderstand what you were trying to achieve.\n\nThanks\n. Hey @suhyunjeon that 2nd diagram doesn't look quite right. The 180 Ringing arrow is going in the wrong direction, acording to your text.\n\nEither way, I think you just need to rework your text to always have arrows pointing right. For example:\n\n```\n192.168.12.154->192.168.13.223: INVITE SDP\n192.168.13.223->192.168.13.224: INVITE SDP\n192.168.13.223->192.168.13.224: 180 Ringing\n192.168.13.224->192.168.13.223: 180 Ringing\n192.168.12.154->192.168.13.223: 180 Ringing\n192.168.12.42->192.168.13.223: 200 OK\n192.168.13.223->192.168.13.224: 200 OK\n192.168.13.224->192.168.13.223: 200 OK\n```\n\nmakes:\n![screen shot 2015-05-24 at 1 03 22 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/160627/7789436/53fe367e-0215-11e5-907f-5147840e491e.png)\n\nwhich has arrows going both left and right in the image.\n. Hey @ctzurcanu you need to `sudo gem install jspp`, instructions available https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams#build-requirements\n. No problem. I've created #113 to alert you (with instructions on how to fix) if jspp is missing.\n. In fact, I found a way to get rid of jspp, and use a standard npm tools. Meaning Make will just install everything it needs. 73b6dc8e392a9562b88f1f4faea285435e481adb\n. in 73b6dc8e392a9562b88f1f4faea285435e481adb we removed the use of jspp.\n. hey @johannes-jansson check out https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams/blob/gh-pages/index.html#L202 it shows how the download button works.\n\nYou should be able to do something similar to fetch the SVG as a string.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure I would want to add a \"getSVGString\" method to the interface, as I want to be agnostic to it being SVG or whatever.\n. I've been tempted for a while to replace Raphael with svg.js or similar, I just haven't got around to it.\n\nWhat CSS/jQuery class tags were you thinking about adding? It's worth mentioning that Raphael actually generates VML or SVG, depending on browser, and if it generates VML, than CSS/etc doesn't work.\n. Oh thanks, that's a great bug report.\n\nI guess there are two issues here,\n1) The hand/simple box drawing is inconsistent with each other,\n2) I most likely assume the note is listed in participant order. A simple\nsort should fix that.\n\nPatches and tests welcome, or I will look at this sometime at the weekend.\n. All tests pass (but sadly that doesn't check visual layout), and visually checked myself. It looks good.\n. I wrote a simple test, and checked, these are the characters within the hand drawn font:\n\n<img width=\"1545\" alt=\"screen shot 2015-07-26 at 11 49 21 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/160627/8895391/d691e726-338d-11e5-939f-195342daeccc.png\">\n\nAdditionally, I replaced the ttf fonts with otf versions, that contained slightly more glyphs. Still not all you requested, but they just aren't in the otf files.\n. Thanks for the issue.\n\nYou can see on the font's original site: http://www.dafont.com/daniel.font?text=%5C%2F that the bold font (which I'm using) seems to also have \\ wrong :(\n\nI'll see what I can do about fixing that.\n. I can't reproduce this on Chrome or Firefox. It might have been fixed in 16f8ec957e0de19eb1a15432 Could you confirm it still occurs using the latest checked in code?\n. This has long since been fixed in code, and on the demo site.. Very nice! I quickly scanned the change, but going to wait until the weekend to fully review/pull.\n\nI fully want to do this migration, but some quick comments/concerns (off the top of my head)\n1) I would like to make the loading of the hand drawn font seamless. So no work for the user other than having the font in the right path.\n2) Is it possible to put your snap.svg work into a separate theme, so Rapheal and snap can coexist? I don't know what my migration plan is, but is it possible to offer both for a while?\n3) I will do a major version bump after I pull this change.\n. I've pulled your code into a new branch, and started hacking on it. There are some inconsitances with the old vs new rendering. I'm also refactoring this so there is a RaphaelTheme and a SnapTheme. It was quite easy to keep both, without duplicating code. This is mainly useful so I can easily compare old to new (to check for regressions). I'll update you shortly.\n. I've pulled this into a new SVG branch: https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams/tree/svg and started to heavily refactor to allow both Raphael and Snapsvg at the same (if you so wish). I had to cleanup some of this new snapsvg code to match the existing API correctly (for example, snapsvg assumed the container was a SVG, where previous Raphael accepted div/td/etc). Still a work in progress, but getting there. I will close this PR, and track the work in #127\n. We are on bower, is that not sufficient for your use case? To be honest I\nnever quite understood the need for both npm and bower, as they have a lot\nof overlap.\n. I actually have a package on npm (for a different project). I can\ninvestigate adding this as well.\n. Always happy to receive pull requests. We support underscore or lodash. We\nonly use their functions in a handful of places, but it just made the code\nneater.\n. Sorry, not abandoned, i'm just really really slow at making progress.\n. Very cool. I hope we haven't duplicated much effort, as I had 90% completed\nmy version of the changes in the svg branch.\n\nAnyway I am travelling right now, but I will take a look ASAP!\nOn 11 May 2016 12:19 a.m., \"Wael Damra\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Here\u2019s my stab at a Snap SVG version.

Would you be able to do so? It'll make it easier to review and accept any changes.\n. With v2 we now use Snap.svg or Raphael, with Raphael to be phased out.. Would forward and back slashes work?\n\n```\nA->B: Normal\nA/>B: Angled up\nA\\>B: Angled down\n```\n\nNot very pretty, but the simplest I could think of just now.\n. The svg branch is in a state of brokenness.  I would like all tests to be run with a combination of Raphael and snapsvg. The snap mock was broken, but this looks like a simple fix.\n. Awesome addition. I've added a few suggestions to the changes.. With v2 we now use Snap.svg or Raphael, with Raphael to be phased out.. JSON is its own language, which was designed for a particular purpose. The sequence diagram language was designed to be easy, simple, and human readable for this purpose alone. \n\nIt has some good properties, for example, even without converting to SVG, it is easy to understand the following diagram:\n\n```\nA->B: Send a message\nB->A: Responses\n```\n\nI don't know what a JSON version would like like, but it wouldn't be as human readable.\n. ha awesome. Merged. Thanks.\n. This whitespace issue should no longer be a problem. It was fixed months ago. I'm going to reopen this bug until I double check.\n. Ok this was indeed fixed.. Thanks for the work.\n\nNot sure why the tests are now broken, Travis was able to build them previously. You should just type 'make', and it fetches all dependencies, builds, checks for lint errors, and runs tests.\n\nAnyway, not near my computer right now, so I will review shortly.\n. Thanks!, but we are actually \"BSD-2-Clause\", if you can change I'll happily pull the request. https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause\n. Thanks!\n. This looks good. Thanks for the change, and sorry for the delay!\n. Would you add some tests for the new oval syntax.\n\nAlso if I read this correctly, if I prefix the actor name with o- then it becomes a oval. I wonder if that is the most obvious/sensible way to do this.\n. You branch has conflicts. Can you rebase from master, so I can merge.\n\nI will look over the code more, but I want to think more about this if this is the right syntax to be using.\n. Thanks for the feedback. I've actually reworked the wobble a little, capping how much it can wobble. Going over text should no longer be a problem:\r\n<img width=\"1072\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-12-27 at 5 15 34 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/160627/21511656/1b8350d6-cc58-11e6-8480-b205a5246025.png\">\r\n. This will happen in the 2.0 release. (No ETA on when that will be)\n. Ok this should be possible now that v2 is released.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ndiagram.drawSVG(container, {\r\n  'theme': 'hand', \r\n  'font-size': 72,\r\n});\r\n```. Very cool! Thanks.\n. Very cool. Do you have an example of how simple fails?\n. I don't have access to the plugin on discourse, but I can't reproduce this myself. \r\n![Uploading Screen Shot 2016-12-27 at 5.13.12 pm.png\u2026]()\r\n I've since released a new version of the library, so if this still occurs after upgrading, then please reopen.. Yes, I am aware and apologise that loading the hand drawn font is terribly slow.  This is a limitation in the Raphael.js library I use for generating the SVG. So that Raphael can maintain it's compatibility with VML (for IE), it includes the font as a vector within the SVG.\n\nI'm currently working on 2.0 of js-sequence-diagrams[1] that moves to the snap.svg library. This drops the legacy VML support, and allows the SVG to be styled with CSS, and use standard fonts.\n\n[1] https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams/tree/svg\n. ok js-sequence-diagram 2.0 is now out, and the font can be specified via normal CSS.. Sounds good to me. Changing the syntax should be easy as it is covered in\nunit tests (which you should add to).\n. \"@bramp Do you have any preferences when it comes to code style, esp with regard to line length?\" no real preference, but keep it reasonable <80-120 ish.\n\nHowever, please run `make lint` as that should catch most of the things I care about.\n. Awesome, a quick glance and things look good! I need to find some time to properly review. However quick comment, 'executionSpecification' seems long, can we just drop the word specification or spec everywhere. I think without it out is still easy to read and understand the code.\n. I'm confused a little at what it means for level to be > 1. Would you show me an example where you mix different levels.\n. Sorry for the delay here. You say \"Lodash 1.8.3 \" but your example shows \"lodash.js/4.13.1/lodash.min.js\". Anyway I now test against Lodash 4.17.x, and after a few fixes ebb8987325d6d49287c8672f9b94aae90b03ca01 it all seems to work. Please wait for a v2.0.2 release.. This was fixed in b4e52445, it just hasn't been released yet....\n. I might not understand your question, but you can do the following:\n\n``` javascript\nvar text = \"Title: Here is a title\\nA->B: Normal line\";\n\n//or\nvar text = \"Title: Here is a title\\n\" + \n           \"A->B: Normal line\\n\";\n\n// or (with ECMAScript 6 - ES6):\nvar text = `\nTitle: Here is a title\nA->B: Normal line\n`\n\n// and then use text\nvar diagram = Diagram.parse(text);\n```\n\nor if using \n. It works on the site, because the string javascript receives contains a \"\\\\n\". You should be able to change your example to work:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n var d = Diagram.parse(\r\n   \"Andrew->China: Says Hello\\n\" +\r\n   \"Note right of China: China thinks\\\\n about it\\n\" +\r\n   \"China-->Andrew: How are you?\\n\" +\r\n   \"Andrew->>China: I am good thanks!\"\r\n  );\r\n```. Ok, I've rolled out v2.0 based on Snap.svg. I haven't looked to see if that would work purely outside a browser, but I suspect it will (with perhaps some minor changes).. I'm confused what was causing this. I can't reproduce this outside of stackedit. For example, on the demo site: https://bramp.github.io/js-sequence-diagrams/ nothing is transparent by default. \r\n<img width=\"892\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-12-27 at 5 08 15 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/160627/21511571/321d438e-cc57-11e6-9927-09c1972a7069.png\">\r\n I suspect the issue here is stackedit has made some change to break this. Feel free to reopen if you can provide a sample page to reproduce this issue.. Thanks for the heads up!. Thanks!. Thanks. I've now rolled out support for snap.svg, and deprecated the use of Raphael (in part because they disappeared from the Internet).. Sorry for the slow reply!\r\n\r\nYes, that grammar looks fine to me. Please go ahead and update [grammar.jison](https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams/blob/master/src/grammar.jison) and add some [tests](https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams/blob/master/test/grammar-tests.js)\r\n\r\n(the grammar.ebnf is used for drawing this [diagram](https://bramp.github.io/js-sequence-diagrams/images/grammar.png) only)\r\n. Thanks!. ETOOMANYFEATUREREQUESTS\r\n\r\n1)  You can already place notes over multiple participants, for example:\r\n```\r\nA->B: 1\r\nB->C: 2\r\nNote over A,C: This will cover lines A, B and C.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, if you didn't know the order of the participants, I could see how you may not know that B was in the middle of C. So I think it might be far to allow A,B,C and ensure it covers all of them.\r\n\r\n2) Yes opts would be cool, and there is already a feature request for them #160\r\n\r\n3) Sounds a reasonable idea, but right now the generated SVGs are not interactive, but could be. Sounds low priority right now.\r\n\r\nI welcome patches if you feel up to adding any of these features.. Very nice idea. Should we use \"actorVistor\" instead of \"actor0\"? I guess number based has fewer pitfalls.\r\n\r\nI wonder if the CSS nth select would have worked without your change, for example:\r\n```\r\n.actor rect:nth-child(1), .actor path:nth-child(1) {\r\n    fill: #f9f;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWell either way I'll review your changes shortly.. I have not considered making a VSCODE extension, mainly because I don't use visual studio. However I welcome others contributing one. There have been plugins writing for other tools, such as JIRA and Confluence.. Excellent @andrewdonkin I'll happily accept this! Would you mind resolving the issues that hound bot found.. Nice test, it worked. But I'm sadly going to reject :). I don't have a Windows machine to test on, so I won't be able to investigate. If anyone else is willing to take a look, and propose a solution, that'll be great!. Hopefully you resolved this on your own. If not feel free to reopen.. Looks good to me. Would you drop the changes to the files under dist. Those would be autogenerated from the files in src at the next release.. Thanks qur2 for your feedback. I'm going to break this into three issues.\n1) Fix Makefile on mac #2\n2) Better documentation for setup / Example page #3\n3) Remove the use of underscore, or adapt it to be lodash compatible. #4\n. WONTFIX. This is a bug in Uglify that has been fixed mbostock/UglifyJS2@f83aca6\n. Thanks for the fix. I've tried out the make process on two of my friends Mac's, and both times it worked without the need for a temporary file. One problem we did encounter is before uglifyjs was installed it left an invalid file on the file system that caused problems when we installed uglifyjs. When we did a make clean the problem disappeared.\n\nSo, would you be so kind to try again with the existing Makefile, but this time running \"make clean\" before \"make\". I see no good reason why a temp file is needed.\n. Thanks for your help qur2. I'm going to close this as WONTFIX. It's a bug in Ugilify, that has been fixed.\n. Will do, blocked on https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams/issues/35\n. I have considered other kinds of diagrams, flow diagrams, ER diagrams. However, the biggest issue I see is that laying the diagram out in a sensible way is harder. With Sequence diagrams it is easy, as each new actor is placed to the right, and each new sequence is placed at the bottom. With a ER diagram, where does each entity go? A automatic placement might not be as nice as a manual placement.\n\nEither way, this is certainly something I will think about in the future.\n. I was not aware of PlantUML, but I will try and keep my syntax as close to their as possible. At the moment it looks like we are pretty similar.\n. Hey Pangratz, looking good thanks!\n\nI've never used grunt, so I don't know if this is the best approach or not. But it certainly removes the \"gem install jspp\" dependency that bugged me. Feel free to keep making changes, but I'm going to spend a day or so looking at grunt before I merge.\n. Hey pangratz, so I've checked out your gruntfile, and I'm now wondering if this is better than plain Makefile.\n\nPros of Grunt:\n- Handles build dependencies\n- Replaces jspp\n\nCons of Grunt:\n- Gruntfile is 88 lines, vs 38 lines of Makefile\n- No incremental builds (Makefile only runs the tasks it needs to)\n\nI'm now leaning towards the Makefile, and maybe adapting it to use npm for build deps, and come up with a better replacement for jspp.\n. Thanks for this pull request, but I'm going to close it. The Makefile solution works great, it is clean and simple, and now uses npm for all build dependencies.\n. felixcriv, can you give me a example of the code that isn't working for you?\n. I created a canvg.html test file in af152d76eccd8740c05d7a578968ade29e94dd85 and I am unable to reproduce your issue.\n\nIf you are still having the issue can you try my test file, and report what browser/os/etc you are on.\n.

Awesome thanks. I used it as the based, and added a few extra things: https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams/commit/e35b863c2aeb56bd9ef463a9bea288d87e9ee252\n. Dup of #12, which has already been fixed.\n. Ah, I think the tests have been broken after I moved some files around. I will fix later. FYI the tests only checked the grammar parser.\n. I have begun to add QUnit tests: https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams/commit/86fc4b6aa7284a43d1b18140a55b55750b8947cf At the moment the QUnit tests aren't automated, but will be soon.\n\nThe old \"make test\" wasn't very complete, or using any kind of testing framework. I'll leave this issue open until I automate QUnit, which might depend on pull request https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams/pull/10\n. ok all fixed now.\n. At the moment you should be able to do:\n\n`note left of Alice Line1\\nLine2\\nLine3`\n\nHowever, \n\n```\nnote left of Alice \nLine1\nLine2\nLine3\nend note\n```\n\nis also nice. I will look at adding.\n. ``` javascript\nvar diagram = Diagram.parse('...');\nconsole.log(diagram.title);\n\ndiagram.drawSVG('diagram');\n```\n. I will consider other types of UML diagrams. However, Sequence diagrams are by far the easiest to draw. Did you have a particle type of UML diagram you wanted?\n. Closing as dup of #42 \n. That's certainly a cool feature, but not one I think belongs in this\nproject.\n\nI'd imagine a new project could be built, that exported a textual diagram\nfrom code, and then my sequence diagram JavaScript could render it.\nOn Apr 2, 2013 8:38 AM, \"Chris Kimpton\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> For example,\n> \n> actor.y      = offsetY;\n> actor.height = height;\n> this.draw_text_box(actor, actor.name, ACTOR_MARGIN, ACTOR_PADDING, this._font);\n> \n> Would produce a sequence diagram roughly equivalent to\n> \n> this->actor: y\n> this->actor: height\n> this->this: draw_text_box\n> \n> Obviously this means being able to parse multiple languages...

In fact at the moment you\ncan see it's a two step process:\n\n``` javascript\nvar diagram = Diagram.parse($this.text());\ndiagram.drawSVG(this, options);\n```\n\nYou could replace that first step with a custom parser, and as long as it\nmakes a valid Diagram object, we are all good.\n\nAndrew\n\nOn 2 April 2013 10:22, Chris Kimpton notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Good point :)\n> \n> Would it be feasible/make sense to plugin in alternate parsers/jison\n> configs so that it could be done in one step?\n> \n> Although I can see that probably wont work - so perhaps a way of going\n> from one parsed language to another - which is what you're suggesting, I\n> guess :)\n> \n> Thanks,\n> Chris\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams/issues/26#issuecomment-15777947\n> .\n. The syntax flows what websequencediagrams.com uses and is a lot simpler and intuitive than  Mscgen.\n\nSo for the moment I have no plans to change.

Thanks Dave,\n\nThis has been fixed by https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams/commit/c2a40fc3f43933e209ed51fd8f825745abba4073 . I believe it's a bug in Raphael, as the display bug doesn't occur using the version of Raphael from git.\n\nEither way, I've changed some of the text displaying code to work around the issue.\n\nthanks\n. That seems a reasonable request. I couldn't find a list on yUML for what are valid options. I could perhaps assume it is valid CSS, and style it appropriately.\n\nI will consider this for a future release. thanks\n. Yes, I eventually plan to add more syntax to the language, time permitting.\nPull requests welcome :-)\nOn Apr 17, 2013 6:49 AM, \"rjp\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Particularly alt / opt / loop?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams/issues/32\n> .\n. Hey de-coy.\n\nGood catch. I'd rather not move the Grammar into the global scope. I had a quick look at the jison source code, and I think I can make it output strict code. Failing that I'll merge your pull.\n\nthanks\n. I fixed this upstream with https://github.com/zaach/jison-lex/pull/5\n\nAs soon as a new version of jison is released I'll bump the required version, then the Grammar will pass the \"use strict\" tests.\n. Not accepting, as this was fixed by fixing jison to output strict javascript.\n. I am all for the CSS approach, however, because I'm using Rapha\u00ebl this is not possible. Rapha\u00ebl outputs either SVG or VML (on Internet Explorer). The later doesn't support styling with CSS.\n\nI think the long term solution is for me to drop Rapha\u00ebl and use a pure SVG solution. I think Rapha\u00ebl was a poor choice on my part as I keep getting blocked by it.\n. I've tried to structure the code to make that possible. For example: HandRapha\u00eblTheme extends Rapha\u00eblTheme which extends BaseTheme.\n\nYou can create a new SomethingTheme that extends BaseTheme. Then all the drawing code can go into the draw_line/draw_rect methods, and it should just work. I don't think there is any Raphael specific code in the BaseTheme.\n. Awesome, I will look as soon as I can.\nOn May 31, 2013 5:55 PM, \"de-coy\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> OK, initial version using svg.js is working on a fork.\n> Current issues:\n> - no line styles\n> - no arrow heads\n> - no css classes\n> \n> Bramp can you take a look and see if you agree it's on the right track\n> before I push on further?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams/issues/35#issuecomment-18773737\n> .\n. @de-coy I've had a look at what you are doing, and it's certainly on the right track. I think the game plan here is to finish your svg.js version, and then I'll make js-sequence-diagram support both Raphael and svg.js, but make svg.js the default. Then in future we can support CSS styles, etc.\n. @rahulsom based on a quick look at @de-coy code, I think he is still missing some features. As such I don't think his svg.js version is production ready.\n. Ok since v2.0 we use Snap.svg, which allows styling via CSS! https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams#styling\r\n\r\nI think this can now be closed.\r\n. Added https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs/pull/1316\n. I've published version 1.0.4 to cdnjs now, it's minified and has the map file. https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs/pull/1557\n. It's a bug, and one that is already fixed just not releases.\n. Fixed by 27c7a2b4fcb7b3366b9e371fde18911e08b13054\n. Good suggestion Rick. However, I'd like to keep things simple and the intention of the line to be spelt out. This also allows that syntax to be used for something else in the future.\n. No support at the moment, but I plan to add it!\n. @adrai, that is very cool! I'll add it to a list of related apps in my readme.\n. I've just added a related section in 4c64e16f366367939aa667ab396c02ed1dfef806 \n. This is a feature I plan to add, but I'm closing as this is a duplicate of issue #41 \n. I think your webserver is serving the JS with the wrong charset headers.\n\nThis is because I'm using an accented character in one of my class names. Either you fix your webserver, change the tag to say charset=... or I stop using funny characters in my class names.\n\nI'll most likely do the later.\n. This has been fixed in 6912c48502176b99c1b7b44ef9348fd2bd031526\n. Thanks\n. Saving as PNG is a little tricky. As the SVG is generated client side, the browser has to save the SVG as a PNG. A year ago when I last tried, I had mixed success getting this to work. I will revisit.\n. What you are doing seems pretty cool, but I'm not sure where the problem lies. As you point out Adobe seems to be at fault, so perhaps the rasterize.js is at fault in it's conversation from svg to pdf?\n. Did you ever dig deeper into this problem? or find a solution? If not I'm going to close this bug in a few days.\n. Closing, feel free to reopen if the problem persists.\n. Fixed by https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs/commit/e3d38d4b6b9bd74f2897696ad61335e282d0f598\n. Sounds a good idea. I will look into getting the project uploaded there.\n. Now available in bower, and sites page updated to explain/demo this.\n. Parallel flows, and other more complex signals will be supported eventually. (loops, if/else, etc).\n. Thanks for reporting the issue. I am unable to reproduce this issue, and I didn't see any red flags in the log file.\n\nI'm going to close, but feel free to reopen if you continue to experience the issue.\n. @kapilt I don't understand your bug report. Did you file this under the wrong project? This is for js-sequence-diagrams, we have no CLI commands that print out help.\n. getPrototypeOf is coming from jison that generates the grammar. I will file a bug with them, but until then that stackoverflow post lists ways to work around this (with polyfilling)\n. The bug on jison is here: https://github.com/zaach/jison/issues/194\n\nand according to latest browser share data, IE8 makes up ~16% of the population.\n. Thanks for the report, and thanks for the grammar fix @jonasfj.\n\nThis was inadvertently fixed in 16f8ec957e0de19eb1a15432697207a0b87fda3b, and I have added a unit test (8f598c6) to ensure this doesn't happen again.\n.

Looks like a few people have made solutions to this bug. Closing as no further action is going to be taken by this project.\n. Thanks for the report. This was fixed by @magnars in 4c06a396a0077ee2ba58b329fa24b6046254aaee. This should be rolled out in the latest version.\n. Sorry for not investigating this earlier. I seem unable to reproduce this issue myself, and I have since updated to the latest version of jquery.\n\nI'm going to close this bug, but feel free to reopen if the issue is persisting.\n. This javascript library is aimed at developers, so the instructions are geared towards them.\n\nTo run it locally, you'll need to get a HTML page, embed the code listed in the usage section, and then load that page via a local webserver. These are all steps that require some kind of knowledge. If you want, you can use the demo site: https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams/tree/gh-pages to help you.\n\nHowever, you should be able to run this from your laptop, as long as you have a Internet connection, by going to http://bramp.github.io/js-sequence-diagrams/\n. Thanks. This has been resolved via another commit.\n. Thanks PeterDaveHello, I'll close this issue.\n. Thanks @magnars \n. Thanks for the suggestion ComFreek. I had a similar request in #10 asking for a Grunt build file. I would be happy to evaluate Gulp (patches welcome), but it would have to provide value over Make.\n\nI don't know enough about Gulp, but for me to consider switching to it, it has to be as simple as Make, handle incremental builds, and provide all the other features Make does today. The ability to have a full JS stack + cross platform builds is certainly valuable, but of all the support emails I received, I've never had one about not being able to build on Windows. (That's not to say there isn't someone out there really trying hard to build on Windows :))\n\nLet me investigate Gulp, and get back to you.\n. This is cool, but I avoided merging as it introduces a new syntax that I'm unsure about supporting in the future. For example, we currently use Raphael that generates VML in IE, and SVG elsewhere. I'd rather change to something like svg.io dropping old IE support. Then we can use the styling native to SVG.\n. In 15b7916fd8d047e8f31f4ed956ebe01a19c54180 I've forced all build tools (jison/jshint/etc) to the latest versions, and fixed whatever needing fixing. Not only did Jison rename grammar to parser, but it now produces non-strict output, which meant I had to do this hack: 0a3c4e0c05c1150bafaa827b8743c90372b1d34a\n\nSo for now this is resolved. Thanks all for debugging.\n.  Thanks @benweet for this work. Sorry for not reviewing sooner! I've made some changes which has broken this pull request.\n\nHowever, I have some questions/comments\n1) I've pinned the jison version to the latest now (via the package.json)\n\n2) I'm unsure of the use case you describe only needing diagram-grammar.js and sequence-diagram.js, and I might have inadvertently broken that as I changed how the final file is built. Could you expand more why you would need this? I consider these files temp files that I don't want checked in.\n\n3) I would be very happy to include the AMD improvements, but again my changes might have broken this. I personally don't use AMD, but I might investigate and add myself if you no longer have time.\n. Thanks for the report. This has now been fixed.\n. Not right now. You could create the diagram, export as SVG and alter with a\nvector editing software.\n\nThere is a ticket and a branch where someone added colour and style\ninformation, but I have not merged those changes yet.\nOn Oct 13, 2014 1:26 AM, \"bing yuen\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams/issues/79.\n. Doh!, silly mistake. Thanks for the fix.\n. That is correct. An actor is defined as `[^\\->:\\n,]+`, that is one or more characters except `->:\\n,`. I could try and get creative with parsing, so that : could be somewhere within the name except at the end, however it might just get tricky.\n\nI understand how that would be inconvenient for object diagrams, but right now I don't have a good solution. I'm happy to consider alternatives, but will close this ticket until one is suggested.\n. Any reason?\n. We currently use:\n\n``` javascript\n_.all\n _.isFinite\n_.extend\n_.each\n_.defaults\n```\n\nWe could write our own alternatives, or refactor the code, however I would like to understand this requirement before I do that. If it matters, we also support lodash, in addition to underscore.\n\nI'm going to close this issue, but feel free to reopen if you are still interested.  \n. Thanks for your feedback. For now I'm going to close this, as I'm not going to fix it.\n\nHowever, incase this comes up again in the future, perhaps and alternative is I could include both Raphael and Underscore directly into sequence-diagram.js. This would mean the user would no longer need to include them as dependencies, but of course at the cost of increasing the sequence-diagram.js file size.\n. Thanks for the report. I have taken steps to correct this. Already the map is correctly reported within the minified file. Next I'm ensuring that cdnjs has a copy of the map (which currently they do not). Once cdnjs updates I'll close this bug.\n. Fixed by https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs/commit/e3d38d4b6b9bd74f2897696ad61335e282d0f598\n. # starts a comment, such as\n\n```\nA->B: something # TODO fill in more information\n```\n\nI'm not sure what a good solution to this would be. We could escape the #, such as #, or we could say comments must be the first thing on the line. I'm open to other suggestions, but I think limiting comments to being the only thing on the line might be the best solution. Assuming you are ok that actors can't begin with a #?\n. thanks!\n. Hi praveenscience,\n\nI'm unsure what problem you are having. Are you saying that your code does not correctly render?\n\nIf you want to add new syntax, you'll have to change a few different things.\n\nFirstly, you will have to change the grammar.jison to support the new \"branch\" syntax. As part of that you'll have to change the .jison and diagram.js to store that certain signals are now within a branch. I suggest you do something similar to how a Note is added.\n\nFinally you will have to change the rendering part of the diagram, in sequence-diagram.js. Code similar to what you have may work, but I would suggest using the draw_rect, draw_line, etc methods, as they will handle the styling of the line, etc.\n. Would you be willing to update the grammer tests?\n\nAndrew\nOn Jan 20, 2015 12:47 AM, \"David N.

Hey @ctzurcanu you need to `sudo gem install jspp`, instructions available https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams#build-requirements\n. No problem. I've created #113 to alert you (with instructions on how to fix) if jspp is missing.\n. In fact, I found a way to get rid of jspp, and use a standard npm tools. Meaning Make will just install everything it needs. 73b6dc8e392a9562b88f1f4faea285435e481adb\n. in 73b6dc8e392a9562b88f1f4faea285435e481adb we removed the use of jspp.\n. hey @johannes-jansson check out https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams/blob/gh-pages/index.html#L202 it shows how the download button works.\n\nYou should be able to do something similar to fetch the SVG as a string.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure I would want to add a \"getSVGString\" method to the interface, as I want to be agnostic to it being SVG or whatever.\n. I've been tempted for a while to replace Raphael with svg.js or similar, I just haven't got around to it.\n\nWhat CSS/jQuery class tags were you thinking about adding? It's worth mentioning that Raphael actually generates VML or SVG, depending on browser, and if it generates VML, than CSS/etc doesn't work.\n. Oh thanks, that's a great bug report.\n\nI guess there are two issues here,\n1) The hand/simple box drawing is inconsistent with each other,\n2) I most likely assume the note is listed in participant order. A simple\nsort should fix that.\n\nPatches and tests welcome, or I will look at this sometime at the weekend.\n. All tests pass (but sadly that doesn't check visual layout), and visually checked myself. It looks good.\n. I wrote a simple test, and checked, these are the characters within the hand drawn font:\n\n<img width=\"1545\" alt=\"screen shot 2015-07-26 at 11 49 21 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/160627/8895391/d691e726-338d-11e5-939f-195342daeccc.png\">\n\nAdditionally, I replaced the ttf fonts with otf versions, that contained slightly more glyphs. Still not all you requested, but they just aren't in the otf files.\n. Thanks for the issue.\n\nYou can see on the font's original site: http://www.dafont.com/daniel.font?text=%5C%2F that the bold font (which I'm using) seems to also have \\ wrong :(\n\nI'll see what I can do about fixing that.\n. I can't reproduce this on Chrome or Firefox. It might have been fixed in 16f8ec957e0de19eb1a15432 Could you confirm it still occurs using the latest checked in code?\n. This has long since been fixed in code, and on the demo site.. Very nice! I quickly scanned the change, but going to wait until the weekend to fully review/pull.\n\nI fully want to do this migration, but some quick comments/concerns (off the top of my head)\n1) I would like to make the loading of the hand drawn font seamless. So no work for the user other than having the font in the right path.\n2) Is it possible to put your snap.svg work into a separate theme, so Rapheal and snap can coexist? I don't know what my migration plan is, but is it possible to offer both for a while?\n3) I will do a major version bump after I pull this change.\n. I've pulled your code into a new branch, and started hacking on it. There are some inconsitances with the old vs new rendering. I'm also refactoring this so there is a RaphaelTheme and a SnapTheme. It was quite easy to keep both, without duplicating code. This is mainly useful so I can easily compare old to new (to check for regressions). I'll update you shortly.\n. I've pulled this into a new SVG branch: https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams/tree/svg and started to heavily refactor to allow both Raphael and Snapsvg at the same (if you so wish). I had to cleanup some of this new snapsvg code to match the existing API correctly (for example, snapsvg assumed the container was a SVG, where previous Raphael accepted div/td/etc). Still a work in progress, but getting there. I will close this PR, and track the work in #127\n. We are on bower, is that not sufficient for your use case? To be honest I\nnever quite understood the need for both npm and bower, as they have a lot\nof overlap.\n. I actually have a package on npm (for a different project). I can\ninvestigate adding this as well.\n. Always happy to receive pull requests. We support underscore or lodash. We\nonly use their functions in a handful of places, but it just made the code\nneater.\n. Sorry, not abandoned, i'm just really really slow at making progress.\n. Very cool. I hope we haven't duplicated much effort, as I had 90% completed\nmy version of the changes in the svg branch.\n\nAnyway I am travelling right now, but I will take a look ASAP!\nOn 11 May 2016 12:19 a.m., \"Wael Damra\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Here\u2019s my stab at a Snap SVG version.

Would you be able to do so? It'll make it easier to review and accept any changes.\n. With v2 we now use Snap.svg or Raphael, with Raphael to be phased out.. Would forward and back slashes work?\n\n```\nA->B: Normal\nA/>B: Angled up\nA\\>B: Angled down\n```\n\nNot very pretty, but the simplest I could think of just now.\n. The svg branch is in a state of brokenness.  I would like all tests to be run with a combination of Raphael and snapsvg. The snap mock was broken, but this looks like a simple fix.\n. Awesome addition. I've added a few suggestions to the changes.. With v2 we now use Snap.svg or Raphael, with Raphael to be phased out.. JSON is its own language, which was designed for a particular purpose. The sequence diagram language was designed to be easy, simple, and human readable for this purpose alone. \n\nIt has some good properties, for example, even without converting to SVG, it is easy to understand the following diagram:\n\n```\nA->B: Send a message\nB->A: Responses\n```\n\nI don't know what a JSON version would like like, but it wouldn't be as human readable.\n. ha awesome. Merged. Thanks.\n. This whitespace issue should no longer be a problem. It was fixed months ago. I'm going to reopen this bug until I double check.\n. Ok this was indeed fixed.. Thanks for the work.\n\nNot sure why the tests are now broken, Travis was able to build them previously. You should just type 'make', and it fetches all dependencies, builds, checks for lint errors, and runs tests.\n\nAnyway, not near my computer right now, so I will review shortly.\n. Thanks!, but we are actually \"BSD-2-Clause\", if you can change I'll happily pull the request. https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause\n. Thanks!\n. This looks good. Thanks for the change, and sorry for the delay!\n. Would you add some tests for the new oval syntax.\n\nAlso if I read this correctly, if I prefix the actor name with o- then it becomes a oval. I wonder if that is the most obvious/sensible way to do this.\n. You branch has conflicts. Can you rebase from master, so I can merge.\n\nI will look over the code more, but I want to think more about this if this is the right syntax to be using.\n. Thanks for the feedback. I've actually reworked the wobble a little, capping how much it can wobble. Going over text should no longer be a problem:\r\n<img width=\"1072\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-12-27 at 5 15 34 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/160627/21511656/1b8350d6-cc58-11e6-8480-b205a5246025.png\">\r\n. This will happen in the 2.0 release. (No ETA on when that will be)\n. Ok this should be possible now that v2 is released.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ndiagram.drawSVG(container, {\r\n  'theme': 'hand', \r\n  'font-size': 72,\r\n});\r\n```. Very cool! Thanks.\n. Very cool. Do you have an example of how simple fails?\n. I don't have access to the plugin on discourse, but I can't reproduce this myself. \r\n![Uploading Screen Shot 2016-12-27 at 5.13.12 pm.png\u2026]()\r\n I've since released a new version of the library, so if this still occurs after upgrading, then please reopen.. Yes, I am aware and apologise that loading the hand drawn font is terribly slow.  This is a limitation in the Raphael.js library I use for generating the SVG. So that Raphael can maintain it's compatibility with VML (for IE), it includes the font as a vector within the SVG.\n\nI'm currently working on 2.0 of js-sequence-diagrams[1] that moves to the snap.svg library. This drops the legacy VML support, and allows the SVG to be styled with CSS, and use standard fonts.\n\n[1] https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams/tree/svg\n. ok js-sequence-diagram 2.0 is now out, and the font can be specified via normal CSS.. Sounds good to me. Changing the syntax should be easy as it is covered in\nunit tests (which you should add to).\n. \"@bramp Do you have any preferences when it comes to code style, esp with regard to line length?\" no real preference, but keep it reasonable <80-120 ish.\n\nHowever, please run `make lint` as that should catch most of the things I care about.\n. Awesome, a quick glance and things look good! I need to find some time to properly review. However quick comment, 'executionSpecification' seems long, can we just drop the word specification or spec everywhere. I think without it out is still easy to read and understand the code.\n. I'm confused a little at what it means for level to be > 1. Would you show me an example where you mix different levels.\n. Sorry for the delay here. You say \"Lodash 1.8.3 \" but your example shows \"lodash.js/4.13.1/lodash.min.js\". Anyway I now test against Lodash 4.17.x, and after a few fixes ebb8987325d6d49287c8672f9b94aae90b03ca01 it all seems to work. Please wait for a v2.0.2 release.. This was fixed in b4e52445, it just hasn't been released yet....\n. I might not understand your question, but you can do the following:\n\n``` javascript\nvar text = \"Title: Here is a title\\nA->B: Normal line\";\n\n//or\nvar text = \"Title: Here is a title\\n\" + \n           \"A->B: Normal line\\n\";\n\n// or (with ECMAScript 6 - ES6):\nvar text = `\nTitle: Here is a title\nA->B: Normal line\n`\n\n// and then use text\nvar diagram = Diagram.parse(text);\n```\n\nor if using \n. It works on the site, because the string javascript receives contains a \"\\\\n\". You should be able to change your example to work:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n var d = Diagram.parse(\r\n   \"Andrew->China: Says Hello\\n\" +\r\n   \"Note right of China: China thinks\\\\n about it\\n\" +\r\n   \"China-->Andrew: How are you?\\n\" +\r\n   \"Andrew->>China: I am good thanks!\"\r\n  );\r\n```. Ok, I've rolled out v2.0 based on Snap.svg. I haven't looked to see if that would work purely outside a browser, but I suspect it will (with perhaps some minor changes).. I'm confused what was causing this. I can't reproduce this outside of stackedit. For example, on the demo site: https://bramp.github.io/js-sequence-diagrams/ nothing is transparent by default. \r\n<img width=\"892\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-12-27 at 5 08 15 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/160627/21511571/321d438e-cc57-11e6-9927-09c1972a7069.png\">\r\n I suspect the issue here is stackedit has made some change to break this. Feel free to reopen if you can provide a sample page to reproduce this issue.. Thanks for the heads up!. Thanks!. Thanks. I've now rolled out support for snap.svg, and deprecated the use of Raphael (in part because they disappeared from the Internet).. Sorry for the slow reply!\r\n\r\nYes, that grammar looks fine to me. Please go ahead and update [grammar.jison](https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams/blob/master/src/grammar.jison) and add some [tests](https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams/blob/master/test/grammar-tests.js)\r\n\r\n(the grammar.ebnf is used for drawing this [diagram](https://bramp.github.io/js-sequence-diagrams/images/grammar.png) only)\r\n. Thanks!. ETOOMANYFEATUREREQUESTS\r\n\r\n1)  You can already place notes over multiple participants, for example:\r\n```\r\nA->B: 1\r\nB->C: 2\r\nNote over A,C: This will cover lines A, B and C.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, if you didn't know the order of the participants, I could see how you may not know that B was in the middle of C. So I think it might be far to allow A,B,C and ensure it covers all of them.\r\n\r\n2) Yes opts would be cool, and there is already a feature request for them #160\r\n\r\n3) Sounds a reasonable idea, but right now the generated SVGs are not interactive, but could be. Sounds low priority right now.\r\n\r\nI welcome patches if you feel up to adding any of these features.. Very nice idea. Should we use \"actorVistor\" instead of \"actor0\"? I guess number based has fewer pitfalls.\r\n\r\nI wonder if the CSS nth select would have worked without your change, for example:\r\n```\r\n.actor rect:nth-child(1), .actor path:nth-child(1) {\r\n    fill: #f9f;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWell either way I'll review your changes shortly.. I have not considered making a VSCODE extension, mainly because I don't use visual studio. However I welcome others contributing one. There have been plugins writing for other tools, such as JIRA and Confluence.. Excellent @andrewdonkin I'll happily accept this! Would you mind resolving the issues that hound bot found.. Nice test, it worked. But I'm sadly going to reject :). I don't have a Windows machine to test on, so I won't be able to investigate. If anyone else is willing to take a look, and propose a solution, that'll be great!. Hopefully you resolved this on your own. If not feel free to reopen.. Looks good to me. Would you drop the changes to the files under dist. Those would be autogenerated from the files in src at the next release.. ",

For example you wouldn't need to create `build/diagram-grammar.js` anymore. You could directly pipe the result of `jspp` (as long as there is a Gulp plugin) to UglifyJS.\n\nI didn't have the time yet to dig deeper into Gulp, but I would certainly help porting the Makefile to Gulp as good as I can.\n. @bramp I've created a simple Gulpfile: https://github.com/ComFreek/js-sequence-diagrams (`git clone ..., npm install, gulp [watch]`). It does not do all things the Makefile did, but building, deploying and watching is already possible.\n\nWhat do you think?\n. @bruriaP My fork is far behind this upstream repository, 117 commits to be precise.

Chrome is (apparently) less restrictive.\n- There was once a bug in Webkit which disallowed canvas export after importing a data URI, see [StackOverflow: \"Accessing the SVG data through JavaScript\"](http://stackoverflow.com/a/5210940/603003)\n- The image is cropped in the above demo. I don't know why.\n- (At least) Chrome needs the following attribute on the root `<svg>` element:\n\n``` xml\n<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" ...>\n\n<!-- Supplying some more attributes I found on MDN seems reasonable to me -->\n<svg version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ...>\n```\n. @winfinit \nIt definitely needs investigating. What is the browser compatibility like in your solution? I can't find information on that topic on canvg's Google Code website.\n. That sounds nice!\n\nUnfortunately - as I just tried - it doesn't work in IE 11 on Win 8.1:\n\n```\nFile: show\nHTML1503: Unexpected start tag.\nFile: show, Line: 93, Column: 9\nHTML1512: Unmatched end tag.\nFile: show, Line: 100, Column: 33\nSCRIPT5022: SyntaxError\nFile: canvg.js, Line: 145, Column: 5\n```\n\nThe line from canvg.js:\n\n``` javascript\nelse if (window.DOMParser)\n{\n    var parser = new DOMParser();\n    return parser.parseFromString(xml, 'text/xml');\n}\n```\n\nIt seems that the SVG is ill-formed.\n. Thanks for your answer.\n- Incremental builds are possible by `watch`ing files for changes and performing certain actions. See also:\n  - https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp (header _Incremental Builds_)\n  - https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/recipes/incremental-builds-with-concatenate.md\n- Which features of Make do you consider mandatory?\n- One feature, which Grunt lacks, is the ability to pipe results of tasks, i.e. no temporary files are needed. For example you wouldn't need to create `build/diagram-grammar.js` anymore. You could directly pipe the result of `jspp` (as long as there is a Gulp plugin) to UglifyJS.\n\nI didn't have the time yet to dig deeper into Gulp, but I would certainly help porting the Makefile to Gulp as good as I can.\n. @bramp I've created a simple Gulpfile: https://github.com/ComFreek/js-sequence-diagrams (`git clone ..., npm install, gulp [watch]`). It does not do all things the Makefile did, but building, deploying and watching is already possible.\n\nWhat do you think?\n. @bruriaP My fork is far behind this upstream repository, 117 commits to be precise. I would recommend building with the Makefile, see the [first comment in this thread](https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams/issues/73#issue-39513834).. :+1: \n. ",

I have had a lot of success with more advanced html5 stuff using that. I'll see if I can drag up the binary I made...\n. So I got this working, you can see it in action in this screenshot of Mou the markdown editor...\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/gbwn32u825qik69/Screenshot%202014-04-19%2020.15.17.png\n\nI'm going to get this up to http://get-diagrams.com.  I think this Jison approach would be great for all types of diagrams that help explain a concept.  ER diagrams and venn diagrams come to mind.\n\nI stuck it all up here: https://github.com/freesurface/get-diagrams\n. It's all here https://github.com/freesurface/get-diagrams  \n\nPretty rough right now.  It's two Flask applications. The `app.py` file is the side that takes the GET parameter and passes it to the phantomjs binary along with a url to the second Flask application.  The second application renders the json blob as a string and executes the javascript within the webkit render engine.  The First application gets passed a base64 string from the second application and returns it as a png document. \n\nIf you have vagrant and virtualbox installed you can run it pretty easily.  Just make sure to bridge to your local network. You will also need to run bower to bring in all the dependencies. \n\nThere is still one bug though... For some reason single hyphens don't end up generating solid lines.  I have not been able to figure out the root cause yet.\n. I'm thinking that the processing part which involves phantomjs would be better as a [Celery](http://www.celeryproject.org/) task queue.  Rather than the current double Flask app situation going on right now.  I'm going to think on that after I get this running on a production server.  Off the bat I will just run both with Gunicorn behind nginx.\n. So it's all up on a server now and running well.  All you need is vagrant and virtualbox to run the application if you want to play around.  All of the configuration is taken care of with Salt.  Some work still needs to be done to properly crop the rendered PNG.  There is also a bug related to single hyphens.  I'm not sure if it's related to URI encoding or phantomjs or webkit...\n\nOther than that, it's snappy enough for a first go. It's also really handy with github's write/preview functionality. Also, github caches each unique URL so that is a very nice bonus.\n\n```\n![sequence](http://get-diagrams.com/sequence?json=[\n    \"Andrew-->China: Says Hello\",\n    \"Note right of China: China is thinks about it\",\n    \"China-->Andrew: How are you?\",\n    \"Andrew-->>China: I am goodie thanks!\"\n    ])\n```\n\n![sequence](http://get-diagrams.com/sequence?json=[\n    \"Andrew-->China: Says Hello!\",\n    \"Note right of China: China is thinks about it\",\n    \"China-->Andrew: How are you?\",\n    \"Andrew-->>China: I am goodie thanks!\"\n    ])\n. Great link! I will have to play with this a bunch. We are about to kick off a project that could learn a lot from this project. I love when stuff is open-source:) PageDown also...mmmmuah!\n\nI personally can only write properly in vim, my brain is just stuck that way now.\n\nHere is the project if you are curious, just about to start describing it in detail...\nhttps://github.com/freesurface/writers-git\n\nThis inspired me to think about how cool it would be to run git in the browser and build up a history without even needing a server.  Once [asm.js](http://asmjs.org/) gets rolling it will be totally doable I bet!\n. Hey @SeanHood ! Yeah I took it down because it was a bit wonky.  Though I was thinking it could be reimplemented with this... https://github.com/kevva/screenshot-stream\r\n\r\nBasically just need to make a static page that grabs JSON from a get param and renders the diagram (can be hosted anywhere, like GitHub pages).  Then build a super simple service that passes that URL to `screenshot-stream` and returns the image data as the response.  Since GitHub automatically caches images to a CDN you won't ever really need to store the file.  If you needed to store the file you could add an extra step to upload it to AWS S3 or something.. On second thought... since all this project does it turn a text sequence into svg(xml)... it should be able to run via node and exchange a sequence for svg without the need for an intermediate browser step.

This looks very complete. Nice work!\n. I second this... As it relates to what I was thinking! bramp/js-sequence-diagrams#64\n. Hey @schrepfler ... Try compiling phantomjs v2. I have had a lot of success with more advanced html5 stuff using that. I'll see if I can drag up the binary I made...\n. So I got this working, you can see it in action in this screenshot of Mou the markdown editor...\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/gbwn32u825qik69/Screenshot%202014-04-19%2020.15.17.png\n\nI'm going to get this up to http://get-diagrams.com.  I think this Jison approach would be great for all types of diagrams that help explain a concept.  ER diagrams and venn diagrams come to mind.\n\nI stuck it all up here: https://github.com/freesurface/get-diagrams\n. It's all here https://github.com/freesurface/get-diagrams  \n\nPretty rough right now.  It's two Flask applications. The `app.py` file is the side that takes the GET parameter and passes it to the phantomjs binary along with a url to the second Flask application.  The second application renders the json blob as a string and executes the javascript within the webkit render engine.  The First application gets passed a base64 string from the second application and returns it as a png document. \n\nIf you have vagrant and virtualbox installed you can run it pretty easily.  Just make sure to bridge to your local network. You will also need to run bower to bring in all the dependencies. \n\nThere is still one bug though... For some reason single hyphens don't end up generating solid lines.  I have not been able to figure out the root cause yet.\n. I'm thinking that the processing part which involves phantomjs would be better as a [Celery](http://www.celeryproject.org/) task queue.  Rather than the current double Flask app situation going on right now.  I'm going to think on that after I get this running on a production server.  Off the bat I will just run both with Gunicorn behind nginx.\n. So it's all up on a server now and running well.  All you need is vagrant and virtualbox to run the application if you want to play around.  All of the configuration is taken care of with Salt.  Some work still needs to be done to properly crop the rendered PNG.  There is also a bug related to single hyphens.  I'm not sure if it's related to URI encoding or phantomjs or webkit...\n\nOther than that, it's snappy enough for a first go. It's also really handy with github's write/preview functionality. Also, github caches each unique URL so that is a very nice bonus.\n\n```\n![sequence](http://get-diagrams.com/sequence?json=[\n    \"Andrew-->China: Says Hello\",\n    \"Note right of China: China is thinks about it\",\n    \"China-->Andrew: How are you?\",\n    \"Andrew-->>China: I am goodie thanks!\"\n    ])\n```\n\n![sequence](http://get-diagrams.com/sequence?json=[\n    \"Andrew-->China: Says Hello!\",\n    \"Note right of China: China is thinks about it\",\n    \"China-->Andrew: How are you?\",\n    \"Andrew-->>China: I am goodie thanks!\"\n    ])\n. Great link! I will have to play with this a bunch. We are about to kick off a project that could learn a lot from this project. I love when stuff is open-source:) PageDown also...mmmmuah!\n\nI personally can only write properly in vim, my brain is just stuck that way now.\n\nHere is the project if you are curious, just about to start describing it in detail...\nhttps://github.com/freesurface/writers-git\n\nThis inspired me to think about how cool it would be to run git in the browser and build up a history without even needing a server.  Once [asm.js](http://asmjs.org/) gets rolling it will be totally doable I bet!\n. Hey @SeanHood ! Yeah I took it down because it was a bit wonky.  Though I was thinking it could be reimplemented with this... https://github.com/kevva/screenshot-stream\r\n\r\nBasically just need to make a static page that grabs JSON from a get param and renders the diagram (can be hosted anywhere, like GitHub pages).  Then build a super simple service that passes that URL to `screenshot-stream` and returns the image data as the response.  Since GitHub automatically caches images to a CDN you won't ever really need to store the file.  If you needed to store the file you could add an extra step to upload it to AWS S3 or something.. On second thought... since all this project does it turn a text sequence into svg(xml)... it should be able to run via node and exchange a sequence for svg without the need for an intermediate browser step.  That would be orders of magnitude more efficient.\r\n\r\nThough Raphel depends heavily on the DOM existing... so that may not be so simple.  The node module `jsdom` could help.. @bramp In the website version the \"china\" example seems to manage to get a line break into the \"note\".  I find if I try to do that while dividing lines with line breaks like above it breaks...\r\n\r\nWorks\r\n```\r\n var d = Diagram.parse(\r\n   \"Andrew->China: Says Hello\\n\" +\r\n   \"Note right of China: China thinks about it\\n\" +\r\n   \"China-->Andrew: How are you?\\n\" +\r\n   \"Andrew->>China: I am good thanks!\"\r\n  );\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoesn't\r\n```\r\n var d = Diagram.parse(\r\n   \"Andrew->China: Says Hello\\n\" +\r\n   \"Note right of China: China thinks\\n about it\\n\" +\r\n   \"China-->Andrew: How are you?\\n\" +\r\n   \"Andrew->>China: I am good thanks!\"\r\n  );\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?

I am also having this issue.  My built file is very different from the one that Andrew has built.  I have attached a screenshot from chrome.  Using ruby 1.8.7 with ubuntu 14.04.\n\n![js-sequence-diagram](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/493847/4017187/4c05ac3c-2a3d-11e4-9d8d-4f0bbed2d7b3.png)\n. Also, noticed that my built file starts very different from Andrew's file.  His file starts with a (!) exclamation mark.  Mine does not.  (I also have it formatted for debugging, but you see that the first character is different is not (!).\n\n![final-file](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/493847/4017346/1079eed8-2a3f-11e4-97ff-d4f60a0096f3.png)\n. Okay, so this ! comes from:\n\nhttps://www.npmjs.org/package/uglifyjs\n\nnegate-iife (default !beautify) -- prefer negation, rather than parens, for \"Immediately-Called Function Expressions\". This defaults to true when beautification is off, and false if beautification is on; pass it manually to force a value.\n\nI cannot force this switch in the Makefile.  Can someone please give me the syntax for forcing the !\nso that I can come close to making the file from the build script?\n\nThanks!\n. Thought this was a jScript error (executing on windows), so I put this on the same ubuntu w/ apache2\nand am getting the same errors:\n\n--------------- start of messages -------------\n\nUse of getPreventDefault() is deprecated.

It also doesn't work if you try to write the hash mark with an HTML entity like:\n\n``` html\n<div id=\"diagram\">\n  A->B: /rest/&#35;{id}/call\n</div>\n```\n.

This would also fairly naturally support diagrams like the first one at https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/bernstdh/Web/CS460/study-aids/exam2-sample.php: \n\n```\n(...)\nT->R [drop = 1]: F3\nR->T [drop = 4]: ACK 4\nT->R [drop = 1]: F4\nT->R [drop = 1]: F5\n```\n\nThis could be made more readable by allowing to set a 'default drop' at the top of the file, and set that to '1' if you're drawing these kinds of diagrams.\n. Ah, looks like the attributes are added at the end of the line in #74. \n\nSo representing https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/bernstdh/Web/CS460/study-aids/exam2-sample.php as:\n\n```\ndefault-drop = 1\n(...)\nT->R: F3\nR->T: ACK 4 [drop = 4]\nT->R: F4\nT->R: F5\n```\n. ```\nA->B: Trigger broadcast\nB->A: Broadcast message\n=B->C: Broadcast message\n=Note right of C: Yay\nB->A: Ack broadcast\n```\n\n![selection_033](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/131856/9479733/d962bf08-4b7e-11e5-850f-9e36affea73b.png)\n. You mean this diagram is ambiguous because it could also be interpreted to mean A and C sent 'broadcast' messages to each other? I suppose that makes sense - but might be something for a separate PR/issue. #129 would be an alternative way to remove this ambiguity.\n. Ah yes, that's a more realistic example of the same ambiguity indeed :).\n. ",

To elaborate, the issue is in here:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        download_link.click(function(ev) {\r\n          var svg = diagram_div.find('svg')[0];\r\n          var width = parseInt(svg.width.baseVal.value);\r\n          var height = parseInt(svg.height.baseVal.value);\r\n          var data = editor.getValue();\r\n          var xml = '<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" standalone=\"no\"?><!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD SVG 20010904//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-SVG-20010904/DTD/svg10.dtd\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"' + width + '\" height=\"' + height + '\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><source><![CDATA[' + data + ']]></source>' + svg.innerHTML + '</svg>';\r\n\r\n          var a = $(this);\r\n          a.attr(\"download\", \"diagram.svg\"); // TODO I could put title here\r\n          a.attr(\"href\", \"data:image/svg+xml,\" + encodeURIComponent(xml));\r\n        });\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code was interesting to me, I had not seen the technique before, but is seems, OK, on click you add a data url to be downloaded, but in Edge, this leads to a lockup and a spinning donut.\r\n\r\nI will see if I can get some attention from the Edge guys... will keep you posted\r\n\r\n\r\n. By the way, two of the links on the web site are dead, not that it really seems to matter, but I was in the debugger anyway.\r\n\r\nHTTP404: NOT FOUND - The server has not found anything matching the requested URI (Uniform Resource Identifier).\r\n(XHR)GET - https://bramp.github.io/js-sequence-diagrams/js/sequence-diagram-snap.js\r\n\r\nHTTP404: NOT FOUND - The server has not found anything matching the requested URI (Uniform Resource Identifier).\r\n(XHR)GET - https://bramp.github.io/js-sequence-diagrams/js/underscore-min.map\r\n\r\n\r\n.
