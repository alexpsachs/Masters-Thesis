Not exactly, in pdf the spacings are defined in absolute units.\nBut you are right, I should have multiple it by draw_scale and transform matrix.\n\nI wonder if you have a pdf with non-zero spacing. I've been looking for one for debugging.\n. Thanks for the pdf.\n\nI've heard about the recommendation of using 'em'. I'm assuming that it don't hurt or improve the performance (of web browsers) comparing with 'px'.\n\nBut currently there's a problem with the browsers, they may now use the exact font size as I have specified.\nFor example 8px may be used even if 8.3px has been specified.\n\nSo using relative distances with 'em' may hurt the display effect in this case. the line will be stretched or squeezed.\n. Fixed.

I see, so ffi is interpreted as f f i instead of a single unicode value.\nThe font is ok, if you replace the \"ffi\" with \"&#xfb03;\" in the html, you'll see the correct one.\n\nSo I may need special process for this kind of characters.\nCan you please show me some reference if you are familiar with it. I know nothing but fi, ff and ffi.\n. And the bad thing is, once 'ffi' is interpreted as a single character, you can no longer reach it by searching for 'ffi' (at least for Firefox).\n\nMay need an option for it.\n. Well my Firefox or Chrome cannot connect 'ffi' automatically.\nCan you please send me the html file you got? \nAmazing.\n. The HTML file doesn't work on my machine (ubuntu 12.04)\nI heard that at least firefox should recognize those ligatures automatically, and thus there are tutorials about disabling it.\n\nI'll keep an eye on it. Maybe I should add some information in the font.\n. well, in my browser utf-8 is default.\nAnd still no ligatures, tried firefox, chrome in Ubuntu and safari in ios.\n\nI've seen some css properties that would enable ligatures, but none works for me\n. seems that I didn't add ligature info to the font, which should be found using fontforge.\nhowever, still I don't know how to do it.\nmaybe I'll output 0xfb03 unicode instead of translated 'ffi'\n. I don't remove any glyphs, and the encoding is provided in the PDF.\n\nBy translating, I didn't mean only 0xfb03 to ffi, it was for text copying.\n\nSome PDF use fonts with special encodings, for example \"Hello\" may be internally stored as #%{{}, and a ToUnicode map may be provided, with which you will get Hello when you select and copy that word.\n\nThere is no such mechanism in HTML, so I have to translate myself.\n\nNow according to the map, 0xfb03 ''means\" 'ffi', so that's the cause.\nAnd what's more, maybe some other meaningless code is used for it, for example, '!', so I cannot simply disable the translation.\n\nI think it's the responsibility (or freedom) of brower to recognize (or not) ligatures, but probably I should add such info into fonts.\nBut currently I've got no idea how to do it.\n\nBtw, what do you mean by using larger font sizes?\n. oh you mean the size of font files.\n\nusually pdf generaters embed only necessary glyphs, you may use the option --clean-tmp 0on your pdf, and examine the ttf files.\n\nthe files are directly dumped from the pdf file, with only re-encoding. I think it doesn't increase the size too much.\n\nIf you find the html file is too large, usually it is the text part, i.e., pure html part. you see pdf is usually compressed, but I cannot do it for html.\n\nIf it is a big problem , I will consider compressing the html file, and decode it using javascript inthe future. Which is however not a concern right now.\n. and seems that ligature info will not be more than a few bytes. I will try to make sure.\n. Well if it is ok for you, you may render everything in images, but text\nselection won't work anymore.\nIn that case, actually images will be much much larger than now.\n\nYou can comment the line with 'if' in bgrenderer.cc ane give a try.\n\nOn Monday, August 20, 2012, Deepak wrote:\n\n> Yeah you are right about it. it's just necessary glyphs.

Now a new font re-encoding method is used, and ligatures will be retained.\nBut this method might be changed in the future.\n. Right now I've got no choice, either a single ligature unicode with correct\nfont; or translated separated characrters.\n\nBut I remembered that if you copy that out, firefox will translate it.

The problem should not be about letter space, but actually absolute positioned strings.\n\nI've been optimizing mainly for scientific papers. Some pdf generaters, e.g. LaTeX, try to handle all the spaces themselves. So in the pdf file you will not see any space charecter, but all positined string pieces.\nSo actually the whitespaces were added intendedly, to make text copy works better.\n\nYou may find the code in text.cc, just search for the string \"span\", and remove the whitespace inside each span tag.\n\nIf that works for you, I may consider adding an option for this.\n. oops\nit should be line 294 of state.cc\n. By 'shows fonts correctly', do you mean that 'ffi' is connected now? Which browser are you using?\n. pdf2htmlEX does not do special check on these spaces, it just follows the instructions in PDF.\nHow do you distinguish a normal space between a positional one, without understanding the context?\n. Have to be off for hours now. Will be back and check the ffi thing then.\n. Yes, I'm also doing rectangle merging, for lines. Normally the words are connected automatically as there is no space in the middle.\n\nSo for [Hello] and [ guys!], or [Hel] and [lo guys!], both will be merged into [Hello guys!]\n\nIn your case, the key thing is that there IS a space between 'fa' and 'mi'.\nAnd do you want an option removing all the spaces? \nI think it'll be kind of weird though.\n. I noticed that the word space is negative, and I tried to removed those whitespaces whose width + word space is 0.\n\nHowever it doesn't work, because there is also a negative letter space...\n\nSo maybe in your case, we need to examine each whtiespace, check its final width and decide if there should be a real whitespace in the output.\n\nBut currently indeed it's not easy to implement that. \n\nAnyway I think this feature would be helpful, at least evince handles this well.\n\nPatches are welcome whenever you get a better algorithm on this.\n. I think your method should work, but the threshold may be variant for\ndifferent pdf.\nWhat do you mean by 'didn't work accurately', is it 'removing too much\nspace', or 'missed too much space'?\n\nBut seems that sometimes I cannot get correct width of ' ' through poppler.\n\nOn Wed, Aug 22, 2012 at 4:01 PM, Deepak notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> I tried three different technique the one with look ahead with whitespace\n> works the best but it breaks some visual stuff which is unacceptable.\n> \n> I scanned characters and check if whitespace between this and next char is\n> less than threshold and current character is space then trim it off.\n> Worked fine for some pdf but some didn't work accurately.

I've just fixed a bug that might affect this issue, could you please merge your code with the lastest devv branch?\nAlso please try the latest exp branch.\n. margin-left is for negative shifting, I've got no better solution than this.\n\nI've just fixed another bug that affecting install_whitespace, please check if it helps.\n. Please check if the --space-as-offset option in the latest 'exp' branch works for you\n. The problem is the ToUnicode map provided in the PDF is bad. both 'e' and 'E' are mapped to 'e'.\nIt's not the fault of poppler nor pdf2htmlEX.\n\nI'll add an option that ignore the ToUnicode map for a specified font, as I've seen many bad ToUnicode maps. With the optioned enabled, pdf2htmlEX will work as if there's no such map, in which case the font should be able to render correctly, but text selection may not work\n. I've just hacked the pdf, that removing the ToUnicode map of the font. Then I got the correct characters.\nNow I need a ToUnicode mapping based only on the font info, without ToUnicode map provided in PDF.\nThere's a function I can use in poppler, but no public. \nI'm contacting with poppler guys before I have to rewrite the function.\n. I used another method for it. Now tounicode is disabled for nonTTF fonts by default.\nPlease test it as much as you can :)\n. No, I embed the 'entire font' in the PDF. Previously I meant that usually\nPDF generators embed only necessary glyphs.\nProbably I'll consider this in the future, as currently I don't have an\neasy to manipulating the glyphs, or counting used ones.\n\nOn Tue, Aug 28, 2012 at 9:08 PM, Deepak notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Tested intensively on variety of PDFs.

Hi @iapain \nIn the latest devv branch, I've change the default behaviour when --tounicode=0\nBasically when **--tounicode=1**, the ToUnicode Map will be forced applied, when **--tounicode=-1**, the map will be completely ignored.\n\nWhen **--tounicode=0**, the map is attempted to be applied. If anything wrong is found, it'll be dropped.\n\nI changed the behaviour because I have received many PDF files where there are Type 1 fonts embedded without proper font names in the font, whereas proper ToUnicode CMaps are provided. These are actually more consistent with the PDF Standard.\n\nWhat do you say about it?\n.

Thanks for reporting, but please open a new issue instead of simply leaving message here.\n\npdf2htmlEX is a converter, it always follows the original content in PDF. So if you see spaces among letter, that would means there ARE spaces in the PDF. And it's not possible for pdf2htmlEX to recognize the words.\n\nAbout zooming, indeed there are problems for different browsers, the problem should not be with the spaces, but font sizes. The browser may round the font size, such that letter will be larger or smaller than they should be. To check if it's the problem you saw, just zoom in, when the letters are large enough, there should never be any problem with font sizes (and thus spaces). \n\nCurrently I don't have any solutions to this, but you may want to check the manpage about the --font-size-multiplier parameter.\n.

More explanation about the span tag. Basically it's an optimization for\nHTML when the case (2) is found. I'll try to combine 'le' with 'app'\n\nHowever I have to follow the metrics specified in PDF. If you inspect the\nPDF file, I'm sure you will see separated operations for the entire word --\ncorrect me if I'm wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, there are a few options you may be able to tweak,\nsomething like --heps or those with space widths.\n\nOn Mon, Jan 7, 2013 at 8:48 PM, \u738b\u7490 coolwanglu@gmail.com wrote:\n\n> Can you point out the location of the word 'arbeitsmarkt' in the PDF? or\n> show me a pdf with only that word.

Why do you remove those js code?\nThey are not equivalent.\nThe js code loads the pages one by one asynchronously,\nwhich prevents page rendering blocks UI events.\n. With that line of CSS, the browser will still try to redraw everything\nbefore it can response user's actions.\n\nSo when the browser loads all the pages gradually, it'll test if the new\nnode should be drawn.\nWith your CSS, still all nodes are drawn as soon as they are loaded,\nmeanwhile you can get no response of actions like scrolling, so the users\nmay feel stuck.\n\nBut with my CSS, all pages are hidden at first, so the browser knows that\nthere's nothing to draw at the beginning.\nThe JS tell the browser to set 'display:block' for each page, and the key\npoint is that it's done with setTimeOut, which is just a new event. And the\nevent is in the same queue as UI events (scrolling etc.) So user actions\ncan be responed before next pages are revealed.\n\nOn Fri, Sep 7, 2012 at 2:15 PM, Deepak notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Wouldn't CSS will do the same here.

So fontforge may built with or without spiro.\nAnd pdf2htmlEX should be built in the same envrionment.\n\nThere's a macro _NO_LIBSPIRO defined (or not, if your fontforge was built\nwith spiro), and it affects header files like spinefont.h\n\nAccording to your cmake log, config.h should be found, which should be in\nthe same folder as fontforge.h\n\nOne possible situation is that fontforge was built with spiro, but you\ndidn't install the headers of libspiro.\nBut everything should be fine if you compiled fontforge yourself.\n\nSeg fault, hmm, can you please check the stack?\n\nThanks a lot!\n\nBe 'right' back after some sleep.\n\nOn Mon, Sep 17, 2012 at 3:19 AM, Deepak notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> BTW installing libspiro helped but it result in segmentation fault.

Since there's no change of the code calling fontforge, still I guess the program is about config.h, as you see error of missing header files or libspiro.\n\nFirst I guess you need to remove libspiro.\nThen run make VERBOSE=1, check the line of ff.c, see if there is  \"-include xxx/fontforge/config.h\"\n. @Kamek It's ok if you see \"libfontforge not detected\", because that's for fontforge about a few weeks ago.\n. And there's another check. In ff_load_font of ff.c, and GenerateScript in fontforge/savefont.c\n\nTry print out sizeof(struct SplineFont)\nThey should be the same.\n. I tried to diff with the old version.\nlibgunicode is linked with (which is not before). \nI hope that's not the cause..\n. @Kamek did you get the same stack dump as @iapain ?\n\nIf so, maybe you can try to comment out all the content of ff_save in ff.c\nBut that's not the correct way, I hope the real cause could be found.\n. Interestingly, I reproduced this on Windows, and I changed CMakeList accordingly.\nWondering it'd help in your cases.\n. crashing in ff_save, it remind me that I've found a similar crashing.\nThe reason was that struct SplineFont has been defined differently in pdf2htmlEX and fontforge.\n. I'm closing it and open a new one for ff_save\n. @Kamek could you please try the latest master branch, if should be able to compile.\ncould you please try if it still crashes?\n\nAccording to @iapain , if he install pdf2htmlEX from macports, everything would be fine. \nBut it would crash if he compile it manually...weird.\n. It's easy to do that.\nIs it legal @.@\n\nBTW you can simply find the output and remove it in pdf2htmlEX.cc\n.

Hi, thank you for your attention and your thoughts.\nFirst of all, I wrote this stuff for fun, but not to provide a great tool.\nIf it's useful for others, I'll be glad, but that's side effect.\n\nI'll definitely take consideration of the features you mentioned, but I'll just pick those attractive to me. Especially I don't want to do anything about UI, which is annoying to me. However, patches are always welcome.\n\nI've actually using a little bit jquery there. You see everything is open now comparing to PDF, you can actually do anything you had imagined with JS, as you have full control of the document now.\n\nAbout LaTeX,  yes, it's true that it'll be better if convert directly from LaTeX. But pdf2htmlEX is not for PDF generated by LaTeX only, and there needs lots of work dealing with the interfaces of LaTeX, that's not some trivial work.\n\nFor now, I guess LaTeX->PDF->HTML would be acceptable for most people.\n. Hi, If you are focused on user experience only, I suggest you convert a simple PDF and read the generated HTML, it should be simple enough to understand, basically, absolute positioning + a few optimization.\n\nIf you want to change pdf2htmlEX itself, first I suggest you learn the PDF format a little bit, such that pdf2htmlEX itself will be quite straightforward.\n\nBlog plot...hmm...., one problem is that the design is still being changed, I knew nothing about PDF format before I wrote pdf2htmlEX, and I'm still learning. It'd better if you ask a specific question, such that it'll be easier for me to answer.\n. There are several ways as far as I know.\n\nThere's an render mode, although not very sure, in which text are rendered transparently, which is for OCR document. But it may not be suitable for your case, as it'll be actually rendered by pdf2htmlEX in the future.\n\nActually I'm considering something similar, I guess annotation might be a good choice, and probably a special prefix should be necessary. But annotation is somewhat independent from text : they are separated rectangles, but not property of text.\n\nMaybe I'll be able to find something useful when I have a better understanding of PDF.\n. Cannot reproduce it on my machine. I can convert it without any problem\nAre you using the latest master branch?\n. solved as discussed\n. Confirmed.\nThanks for reporting.\n. Not sure what I have done, but seems this has been fixed.\nPlease check with latest master branch.\n. How about -ggdb\n. Wondering why you need to toggle '-Wall'\n\nTo me it's more natural to add a switch between '-O2' and '-ggdb', something like DEBUG vs RELEASE, but would be more convenience I guess.\n. I actually prefer this one.\nbtw, just noticed 'pdftohtmlEX' in the very beginning, could you please also change it to 'pdf2htmlEX'\nThanks a lot!\n. Great, could you please push it to your repo such that I can merge it?\n. I can get only a patch from your gist.\n\nI mean if I can merge your fork, your commit will be logged and credited.\n\nOn Sun, Sep 23, 2012 at 8:21 PM, hasufell notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> should be:\n> git pull git://gist.github.com/3769756.git\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/pull/28#issuecomment-8797852.\n. Merged.\nThanks!\n. It's a known issue, optimization for mobile devices will be done later, and, as @iapain said, might be a work of the frontend.\n. Can you elaborate what should be done, for example, especially for iphone5 ?\n. Yes, somebody asked me about this before.\n\nI've not found a trivial way to make GetOpt accepting a file as\nsupplementary parameters.\n\nSo maybe I need parse some format myself.\n\nI'll use JSON if I'm writing in Python, but how about C++?\n\nAnyway it'll be a 'user-experience' feature, but not a 'technical'\nfeatures, which is far less interesting to me...\n\nSpeaking of mobile devices, will it be faster if images are not included,\nsay --process-nontext 0. Or maybe it will improve loading time only?\n\nOn Wed, Oct 3, 2012 at 6:58 PM, Deepak notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Pardon me, what these options going to do?

You are right about the memory issue, actually there's similar things done with Javascript, where the invisible pages are hidden, for smoother scrolling on PC.\nI'm actually trying to find a way to reduce the number of elements, but 'to not render unnecessary pages' is the job of viewers, and pdf2htmlEX provides only content conversion.\nBtw, did you mean PDF or converted HTML?\n\n@iapain issue65_en.pdf itself is 18M, and the size of converted HTML is similar, so 10+ MB did not surprise me.\nflowable text is in the TODO list, I will probably start working on it after finishing css/svg.\nHow much speed gain do you think can be brought by flowable text?\n. After a quick searching, it does not seem to be as easy as I've thought of, there are many rules related to grammar, space, positions.\nSo I'll take some time for this after finishing the background staffs.\n. @deathlord87 Thanks for your effort.\n. @deathlord87 What do you mean by UI? \n\npdf2htmlEX should extract and provide enough information from the PDF file, such that UI interface can be implemented on top of it, for example, zoom/link/outline/thumbnails etc. pdf2htmlEX should provide no UI, because I assume that publisher is likely to design their own UI theme in order to to match their websites.\n\nHowever there should be a demo UI, such that others may understand the structure of generated HTML better, you can actually find javascript script code in the repo. Currently what it does are:\n- hide necessary pages ( set display:none )\n- handle internal link jumps\n- handle zoom in/out (disabled currently)\n\nwhat's- missing for a demo UI include\n- UI elements\n  - buttons\n  - navbar\n- corresponding functions for UI elements above for the Viewer object\n- effects\n\nIn principle, the Viewer object should be out-of-the-box providing necessary function, and UI designers may directly use them.\n\nI suggest jQuery, because it's being used in the repo. Also there's a mobile version.\n\nHowever as pdf2htmlEX is for general platforms, so I don't suggest use a mobile version directly.\n. @deathlord87 I'm not familiar with Sencha Mobile, but I've used ExtJS, which is not lightweight enough to me.\n. @deathlord87 sorry for the misunderstanding. Still recommend jQuery in this case.\n. I've tested a few HTML pages produced by pdf2htmlEX, on a few low-level Android devices.\nThe results vary, depending on the browsers. Also it's not recommended to open the produced HTML files directly, since usually web browsers do not optimize in the same way as PDF readers.\n\nBut probably there will be ajax loading in the pdf2htmlEX.js\n. Can it decrease performance in any cases?\n\nOn Sat, Mar 9, 2013 at 9:32 PM, Deepak notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> We were able to increase performance by triggering hardware acceleration.\n> I have tested it with iOS device but in theory it should work same way on\n> Android Browsers as well.

Thanks @iapain, I guess that before long this issue will be solved 'automatically'...\n. @micred From my experience, it's just lagging, on all operations (zoom in/out, scroll up/down).\n. Hi @bachboss, I think that if you remove that line of CSS, the following pages won't show up. I don't have those devices so I cannot test, but it is so on Firefox.\n. @josefnorlin Are there any issues with the current version?\n. @bmatto I guess it'd be better to specify your device and browser.\n. @josefnorlin Can you provide both versions (fast and slow) of your HTML file? Maybe I will be able to find some clues.\n\nSpeaking of mobile devices, currently I've got only an iPad 1, which might be too slow for pdf2htmlEX. For a long time I have not tested pdf2htmlEX's output on modern devices, and I'm not sure if recent ones are fast enough. On the other hand, the lack of devices is not the main reason that I've not been able to fix this issue, there are even performance issues on PC for some PDF files! Although I've been working on it, there doesn't seems to be much progress :( Maybe it's just my lack of knowledge.\n\nI really appreciate your willingness for donation. However I'm afraid that I cannot make any guarantee at this moment, it's not like compatibility issues which are likely to be solved given enough time. On the bright side, as a start I would like to try to optimize the output at least for specific documents on specific devices. Can you please propose some devices (also browsers on them) which match your clients the best? I'll then try to pick the 'easiest' one for me as a start.\n. @bmatto Seems to be an interesting CSS property. Just learned. Thanks!\n. @josefnorlin Great. So I'll include this one and also the 3d transform property in the css file later.\n. I'll give my ipad to my parents in a month as they need it. Before that I would like to test the 3d transformation rule and the `webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;`, and I'll make some quick optimizations.\n\nIf any of you would like to provide some sample PDF that might are slow on mobile devices, please post a link here, or I'll just test some random ones from my collection.\n. @Toneti777 thanks! I've just downloaded the file, you may remove it now.\n. I've tested a few tricks mentioned in this thread on Safari / ipad 1G\n\nTest file is demo.pdf as used in pdf2htmlEX demo.,\n\n**webkit-overflow-scrolling** : scrolling become smoother, but the white background for each page is lost. And it makes Safari crashed a lot.\n\n**removing hidden pages out of DOM**: I used `xxx.innerHTML=''`, which does not really help\n\n**triggering 3d transformation**: tried `translateZ` and `translate3d`, did not observe any performance boost.\n\nSo I did not find any one that seems to be useful. Perhaps it depends on the document.\n. @typoheads I did read some output for PC browser, but I haven't done that for mobile browsers.\nI'm not familiar with mobile web, but I just realized that I could modify user agent. \nWill do that soon. Thanks for the reminder.\n. @typoheads  Indeed.\n\nThere is actually an SVG backend in pdf2htmlEX, which is far from mature right now though.\n. I've created a wiki page summarizing tricks that might help improving the performance on mobile devices:\nhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Mobile-Devices\nThank you very much for reporting them.\nHope it helps, and please feel free to add more if you have found new ones.\n\nIt's been nearly 2 years since this issue was created, and mobile technologies have changed a lot. It seems to me that most performance issues happened on iOS devices (am I right?). But I don't think I can confirm it with my iPad 1G, which lag on almost all output of pdf2htmlEX.\nA possible reason is due to limitations/defaults of (mobile) Safari, the latest iOS seems to be more open, not sure if it'll help.\n\nNow the issue seems vague to me, some said it's slow, some said it's OK. Some tricks seemed to work for some PDF files, but not for others. **If you have certain information for specific types of devices, please also add to that wiki page**. For example `some kind of files` are slow on `some kind of devices`. Which should help.\n\nSVG might be a solution, or we can just wait until devices become even faster.\n. @cdelgadob The method of removing pages would be up to the actual UI framework, so I haven't come up with a proper general example.\n\nI think a 3d transform in the outermost container would be enough, but I'm not sure. I guess you need to do some experiments.\n.

One possible solution is: text should be rendered as image when it's clipped, or further when there is an image object on top of it.\n. http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/masking/adobe/\n\nThe `clip-path` CSS property will be useful, even SVG paths are supported.\nHowever this property is not (well) supported by browsers (other than Firefox)\n. @jahewson \nYeah, I meant that property actually, both of them have been introduced in html5rocks link\n\nI've just taken a look at Crocdoc's output of the \"typeface\" PDF, not surprised by their solution.\n\nI'm about to work on this issue. You mentioned that you've been working on this one, what's the progress? We may support only rectangles for a start\n. Now I think that estimation in rectangles is fair, although I've been worried about the accuracy in other (rare) cases.\nSVG has to be involved in order to provide accurate clipping, but in that case, #116 should be the right thing to do.\n. A simple clipping (for rectangle) has been implemented in v0.8. Which should cover most cases.\n\nSVG path may be used for complicated paths, which is not a high-priority issue right now. So just wait for some one mentioning this.\n. It's an old known issue, and has been in the TODO list for quite well.\nCurrently printing is not of high priority, as you can also provide the original PDF for printing, e.g. Wikipedia.\n. Hmm, now I'm working on improving the background images, and there are quite a number of things to do after that. No guarantee on the speed, as I'm doing it in my spare time.\n\nYou may consider filing a [commision](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/FAQ#wiki-feature_commission) if you want it be done soon.\n. could you please send me an email (which can be found in the project home\npage)?\n\nOn Mon, Oct 15, 2012 at 11:02 PM, stanbellcom notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> that might be a possibility,\n> \n> now that you know the issue, you could perhaps tell me what would be an\n> estimate price to speed up this feature appearance?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/issues/40#issuecomment-9448114.\n.

But probably would make your system more complicated.\n. According to my research on this, there are two major issues prevent it to be done\n- Firefox & Chrome do not print the pages with fonts introduced by @font-face\n- Paging cannot be controlled - the latest CSS standard is not supported by browsers right now, SVG might work for this.\n\nSo I guess this has to be done for quite a while.\n\nIf any one find a solution for this, please kindly tell me.\n. I have created a [Wiki page](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Printing) for this issues and updated the issue description.\n. @jahewson\nThanks for the info. \n\nSo before this can be solved with some future version of CSS or SVG, providing the original PDF is the best solution.\n. @purem, thanks for the info, but as also mentioned in that link, Firefox currenlty does not support this.\n.

So it is worth a new try.\n\nOn Mon, Feb 4, 2013 at 9:01 PM, John Hewson notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> That Firefox bug has \"Status: RESOLVED FIXED\" since October 2012.\n> \n> I'm using Firefox 18, and web fonts now print correctly [image: :smile:]\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/issues/40#issuecomment-13075745.\n.

I've put into some CSS.\n\nNow if you use the argument `--zoom 1.333`, the page should be able to be printed in Chrome.

Found a fix for Firefox.

Right, I'll do that.\n. I cannot reproduce it, there should already a newline character there.\nCould you please provide an affected PDF files?\n. I guess it's a bug of the browsers then, I remember that for div, a 'newline' should be appended by the browser.\n. @iapain  Let me try again.\n. @iapain I cannot reproduce it, e.g. `demo.pdf` which is one of the demo files of pdf2htmlEX. Can you please provide an example PDF? \n. @iapain Which browser are you using? \n. @iapain As we've discussed before, this has always been the behaviour of Chrome.\n\nFor Firefox 22, I've just tested on Windows and Linux (Ubuntu), If you select the text and paste them to a multi-line text editor, you will see the line breaks, but if you paste them to the location bar, the Linux version will consume all the line breaks, and the Windows version will convert them into whitespaces.\n\nSo I think it's how the location bar handles the line breaks, but the line breaks are there.\n\nCan you please verify this?\n. @iapain This is indeed an issues, and I'll reopen it. But I don't have a good solution right row. \n. @iapain Thanks! Maybe we can discuss about your solution before you implement it.\n. @iapain I think you can add a `<br>` there, but I'm not sure how you can git rid of the newline there.\n. @iapain We should never modify the content unless necessary. When you see a char `0xa`, which is supposed to be a char, it might be actually something else, due to the evil encodings of the fonts, which is exactly the reason that sometimes characters could be lost due to `--space-as-offset`.\n\nAlso in PDF file there are rarely actually line break characters, afaik, instead text are simply repositioned with a PDF instruction.\n. @iapain  No it didn't work. I've tested on Firefox and Chrome on Windows.\nI remembered that all whitespaces between tags are ignored in HTML.\n. There are dots right now, each dot indicates one page has been processed. Isn't that OK?\n. Ok then, I'll implement an easy one, but it might be changed in the future. You can always define your own 'protocol' as you wish.\n. done in the master branch.\n. Yes, it's not supported right now. One reason is that I've never seen one.\n\nI'll try to find a way to render it in HTML efficiently, not quite sure about this.\n. There is a CSS property called 'writing-mode', but seems not to work well on my browsers (Firefox, Chrome).\n\nIt would be too costy to place each single characters, so for now I'll make them rendered as images.\n. It's done, ugly but working. Please try the latest master branch.\n. What's the output of pkg-config --libs poppler\n\nAnd what's the content of /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/poppler.pc\n. Congratulations!\nAnd thank you @haisum for your info.\n. There is such parameter, see the manpage.\nBy default the output dir is '.'\n. Hello, I've been busy with my own research for the past weeks, and just came back now.\n\nLike @iapain said, I think pdftohtml or pdftotext might be the best choice for you, for now. \n\nI'm not sure what you want CSS removed, because even those are gone, still you cannot edit the HTML file generated (easily).\n\nThings prevent easy editing include:\n- The space padding between words, because in many PDF there are spaces of variant lengths.\n- The lines are not reflowable, so if you change the length of a line, it will look ugly\n- Fonts, often only necessary glyphs are embedded in PDF files, so if you introduce new characters, they won't show up correctly\n  \n  And the solutions to each of them:\n- To remove the padding spaces with space characters, at the cost of alignment\n- Reflowable text, I've tried once, but it's not only an issue of position, but also things like spelling, e.g. sometimes the dash at the end of a line should be removed in order to connect with the next line\n- If the PDF file provides with a valid semantic encoding, you can easily substitute the font as you wish; otherwise I think you have to fix it manually.\n\nThe essential issue is that PDF has been designed for publishing, not editing.\n. I'm going to try to implement the first two soon, and the third one is 'automatically' if there's a valid encoding.\n. @404pnf Thanks for your explanation.\n\nConverting pdf to html with corresponding tags would be quite difficult and annoying for me to do, as a hobby. That'd be recognition rather than conversion.\n\nFor example\n\ntable: to recognize aligned columns, as well as borders\nli: not sure about this, maybe to recognize bullet?\nh1/h2... : several rules based on the position and font sizes\n\nTo me, maybe h1/h2 would be the most difficult thing to do, because I cannot make a formula that works for all the PDF, the rules should be adaptive and adjustable, which might lead to lots of more options. I guess Acrobat does it well because it has lots of samples, and years of adjustment.\n\nI remembered that pdftohtml can also export to xml, but didn't try it.\n\nFor now my concern is to output an html with reflowable and editable, making a small step towards structure-oriented html than visual-oriented.\n. Indeed, Acrobat should have been guessing, but with more confidence with their well tuned heuristics\n\nI'll implement unwarping lines, there have been a few people asking about editing the HTML, and publishers like @iapain also needs it. But it will be at the cost of losing some visual accuracy.\n\nAbout file size, PDF supports in-file compression, while HTML does not, so it's not fair. But you can enable deflate on your http server. If you gzip the HTML file, most of time the file size is comparable with the original PDF.\n\nComparing with PDF.js. pdf2htmlEX started as a toy, as an alternate to PDF.js when a friend of mine needed to display PDF online. The problem with PDF.js (for now) is the slowness, and text handling. The advantage of pdf2htmlEX is all conversion/optimization is done background on the servers, which is done only once, such that they are not imposed on the users -- but seems that PDF.js will do a server-side version.\n\nIn short, pdf2htmlEX is for publishers, and PDF.js is for viewers.\n\nThe purpose of pdf2htmlEX is to provide a choice, for those who intended to publish in HTML, but was forced to PDF because the lack of tools. Also HTML, together with CSS and Javascript, allows better integration with your web site (themes, links etc), and more creative works --  how about google analytics embedded in your CV online? \n\nIf you would like to help pdf2htmlEX, thank you and here are a few possibilities that you don't have to code.\n- Just use it and report bugs.\n- Credit it on your sites such that others would be aware of pdf2htmlEX\n- Make a small donation if there is a commercial organization behind -- I'd suggest you make a feature request meanwhile\n. I've been trying to create reflowable text, but thing is more complicated than I had thought of.\nI'll create a wiki page for this issue.\n. Created a new issues for it. #56\n. You might need to take a look at \n\nvoid HTMLRenderer::process(PDFDoc *doc)\n\nin general.cc.\n\nYou can disable text by removing a few lines there.\n. Not sure on Fedora, but on Ubuntu /usr/local precedes /usr in the searching path.\nWhat's the output of `pkg-config --libs poppler`? Maybe you need to set some environmental variables for pkg-config.\n\nAbout fontforge, the header files is found in /usr/include but libraries are in /usr/local, how could that happen? So you have two versions of fontforge installed?\n. I think you may need to prepend /usr/local in your system include paths,\nsuch that cmake will search at /usr/local/include first.\nmake sure there is /usr/local/include/fontforge/fontforge.h\n\nthen you should be ready to compile pdf2htmlEX.\n\nOn Thu, Nov 15, 2012 at 10:55 PM, True Merrill notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> Good questions.

Hey thanks a lot for your effort!\nI'm going to examine and merge your changes soon.\n. I've made a pass about your modification. All make perfect sense except for HTMLDevice.\n\nI guess you make it 'more general', such that we can support similar formats, but it's more like the relationship between poppler and HTMLRenderer, where the former parses PDF files and the latter output necessary bits for the specific format.\n\nBesides, most functions and behaviours etc of HTMLRenderer was designed exactly for HTML/CSS, so I wonder what kind of other formats can be supported, maybe XML?\n. I don't know why you move LineBuffer::State outside, because it's not used outside the scope.\n\nI'm going to refactor the code, to split utill.cc, and create helper classes in order to make HTMLRenderer.h shorter and cleaner.\n. @filodej Actually you don't have to worry about the reverting, because I can carefully cherrypick the commits I need.\nAnd I'm actually working on the install/export functions, I will create classes for them in order to have them easily managed.\n. It's been manually merged.\nI'll try to refine and reorganize the code as there's finally someone reading it :)\n. I've cleaned the code a little bit today, and pushed them into the master\nbranch. Hope that this won't lead to bugs...\n\nI've also considered a dedicated class for manage the css classes, but not\nas easy as I have thought about... need more time.\n\nOn Thu, Nov 29, 2012 at 5:29 PM, filodej notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Thank you.

PDF and HTML are all used in wide variant situations, people have different needs. Just thinking about recognizing and showing messages about the collision of --fit-width and --fit-width-every is quite annoying to me. \n\nSo here is what I do:\n-  I've tagged this issue 'need vote', so hope that people support this parameter would leave comments here, to convince me that it is necessary. OR\n- You may hack it yourself and issue a pull request, and I will review the patch. Just make sure it won't confuse the users (with all other parameters)\n. It's not about the names of the parameters, but values. What should be done\nwhen people specify both parameters, and even different values?\n\nOn Mon, Dec 10, 2012 at 4:31 AM, Simanas notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> I agree the name is annoying to me to ... how about just one parameter\n> --zoom-every: [1/0] ?\n> And great idea to make a voting :) So my vote you alredy know [image:\n> :+1:]\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/issues/55#issuecomment-11175516.\n. What's the difference of --zoom when --zoom-every is set to 0 and 1?\n\nAnyway I'll need to make sure that this parameter is something worthy.\n. Closing it as we have #57 \n. @iapain, I remember that you have shown me a video for reflowing text in pdf, but I forgot the name. Could you please tell me?\n. As a start we may make some assumptions and start from the easiest case:\n\nNo header, footer, figure, table. And single column of text.\n\nThe task is to combine text lines in the same paragraph. We can further extend this to two-column layouts, as text rendering order is usually the same as reading order.\n\nSpacing might be a problem, I think it's hard to preserve the exact spacing (width of letter-space, word-space, space-char), need to relax and estimate them.\n\nThe process should be easy if facilitated with manual marking/adjustments.\n\nRef: http://scribdtech.wordpress.com/2012/02/29/why-zooming-on-mobile-is-broken-and-how-to-fix-it/\n\nAnother direction is to tag the PDF in some way, and to utilize tag information in PDF file.\n. Lots of useful information here:\nhttp://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/PDF\n. @alvisty Thanks for your information! \n\nIt seems to have been actively developed, and it looks promising. I'll check it out and see how it works.\n. I wouldn't say \"reflowing is achivevable\" based on these videos. For example in the first video, the page box is (or maybe has to be) provided by manually drawing it. The document seems to be well formed, single-column, the paragraphs are quite aligned (no item lists etc), and I didn't see any tables in the video.\n\nBut I do believe that it's doable with some assumptions on the document type and format. \n\nThe OCR example is indeed amazing, but I couldn't try my own files due to maintenance. \n. @iapain k2pdfopt seems to be image based, I'll try to read more of its code later. For now I'll try to create a new text model for the reflowable text in the future. The new model will be somewhat like Crocodoc's, which consists of  text groups with relative positioned text lines.\n. Thanks for your effort. I'm reviewing the commit.\nStill I think it should be part of a PDF manipulating tool, how about the feature to reorder the pages?\n\nCan you provide with the PDF you mentioned, with different sizes of each page? (but you want them equal)\n. Yeah I believe they exist, but I've never seen one. I just want to know why the sizes are different while they should have been.\n. So if a few pages are in the wrong direction, why would you fix it by zooming instead of rotating?\n. I mean the zoom function can be done in HTML with JS, which is consistent\nwith other PDF viewer.\n\nAlso I just realized that, different zoom factors for different pages would\nhurt the JS code, you may also need to fix that.\n\nOn Thu, Dec 13, 2012 at 8:03 PM, Simanas notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Because in real life it is meant to be read in landscape mode, while the\n> others in portrait, therefore an author of pdf file had flipped these pages\n> 90 degrees so you don't have to rotate your computer screen, while trying\n> to read such a page of a report via adobe acrobat reader.\n> \n> But this is not the only case...

There's no option to make all of them a same width.\n. @Simanas Please relax, I appreciate your efforts, but I just don't think \"to convert a html document with exactly 960px in width, from a pdf file contains pages with different widths\" is a common feature that should be included.\n\nI need more evidence about this, and that's why I've left it open and marked it as 'need vote' instead of just closing it.\n\nPlease keep in mind that I'm the author & maintainer, once this feature is included, it has to be \"maintained\". Suppose another people really wants all odd pages rotated CW and even pages rotated CCW, do you think it should be included in pdf2htmlEX ? I've actually created special features for a few people, for different purposes, but I never merged them into master.\n\nAlso note that there is no 2nd people supports this request till now, despite of the 'need vote' label. \n\nAs I said earlier, I'm waiting for more evidences.

By to mine, it's conversion of format, which does not MODIFY the\nPDF.\n\nWhen you mean \"convert to your needs\", I say it's MANIPULATION, because it\nchanges PDF.\n\nYou may check out PDFtk, probably the best in your case.\n\nOn Tue, Jan 29, 2013 at 9:38 PM, Simanas notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> So please tell me is this piece of software is aimed to serve as a pdf\n> VIEWER or is it aimed to be a CONVERTER, because all your args are from\n> series: \"Usual pdf viewers do not have such a functionality, therefore...\"\n> \n> If it is only a VIEWER, than please apologize me, I was to emotional.

You got the point.\n\nYes, for Linux and Mac, they use freetype or something similar, such that\nfonts on screen look like the same as printed on papers - thanks to Apple\nBut Windows, with ClearType, focuses on \"readable\".\n\nI think the fonts in PDF standards are similar with Linux/Mac, because I\ncan't quite tell the difference (visually) between a PDF file and a\nconverted HTML.\nIt should be so since PDF is a format for printing.\n\nAFAIK Adobe Reader on Windows should render all fonts by itself, but web\nbrowsers will call Windows API for this, by default the effect could be\nvery bad since most embedded fonts (in PDF) are lack of proper hinting --\nthe PDF viewer is supposed to handle this.\n\nttfautohint may add some hinting with freetype, which is currently the best\nsolution I have found.\nI guess the --external-hint-tool is flexible enough for you, you just feed\na executable or script to it, and don't even need --single-html.\n\nIf you find a better solution, please tell me.\n\nOn Tue, Jan 8, 2013 at 1:26 PM, sudesh-poojari notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> [image: eng]https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/3097644/49325/556dfd2c-5953-11e2-9f2f-cf98a01fc5cf.jpg\n> [image: noneng]https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/3097644/49326/5595f412-5953-11e2-8a0d-d0a2377d01d0.jpg\n> \n> Attached is images how the non english pdf looks in windows7 and how\n> english pdf looks in windows 7 across browsers.\n> \n> I tried everything, seems to be something with how these browsers render\n> fonts in windows 7.\n> \n> Mac looks completely fine.\n> \n> Tried lot of css tricks, but those tricks cannot be applied to whole pdf\n> (depending on font weight and other stuff)\n> \n> thanks a lot for your help for guiding me, I m not giving up yet may be\n> look at some other way to overcome\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/issues/60#issuecomment-11985216.\n.

Just inspected the file, this should be issue #39 \n. The reason is that there is some distance between the letters. The distance is not literally a space ' ', just a positional shift.\n\nIt's a known issue, I cannot add a space there since otherwise if you copy & paste the text, you will see an extra space. \n\nThere are only 2 possible workarounds\n- specify a larger value for \"--heps\" might help, which would hurt accuracy however\n- handle selection with Javascript, say you recognize the selected part and draw a rectangle there -- which is beyond the scope of pdf2htmlEX\n\nIf you have better solutions, please tell me.\n\nMarked this issue as \"need solution\"\n.

I think you only need to remove CMakeCache.txt\n. Confirmed and working on it.\n. This pdf first displays the text, then the scanned image on top of the text. Such that the real text are covered, invisible, but still selectable.\n\npdf2htmlEX currently cannot detects this, it always tries to grab all text and put them on the top text layer.\n\nI'll try to find a workaround for this.\n. Is it true (or very common) that, for scanned pdf files, all text are hidden or covered by the scanned image.\nIf so I may add an option like 'hide-text' for a workaround.\n\nEDIT: I mean you can actually add more text there, above the images, with any PDF manipulation tool.

So please give it a try.\n. @duanyao Cool!\nI'm a little bit worried about the performance, you might want to take a look at rtree in boost. Or you can leave the interface flexible such that I can fix it later.\nAnd It might not be a good idea to create a separate `char_covere` array, would make it more difficult to optimized in the future. Currently it's similar as in PDF, where we record text and state changes. But it's not elegant either. Probably I need to make it an array and storing the state for each character.\n. I think you can keep `chars_covered` for now, as probably I don't have time to rework the data structure. I wonder if `std::vector<char>` would be better, because I remember that `std::vector<bool>` will use `bitset` for saving memory, but rather slow.\n\nCan you create a separate class for the hittest? I don't want everything inside `HTMLRenderer`. Besides, it will be easier to adapt to other data structures.\n\nRtree should give an average time of O(n logm), and O(n sqrt(m)) at least. 0.2s is not fast, as I see sites using pdf2htmlEX to convert thousands of PDF, or a single file containing thousands of pages. But other the other hand, font & image processing may be even slower, so this may not be the bottleneck.\n\nCan you create an option for this? This is experimental right now. Somebody might prefer performance.\n. @duanyao Probably you could create a PR when you think it's ready, and it'll be a better place to discuss. Thanks!\n. I'm closing this issue as there's already an implementation for this.\nPlease create new issue with sample files if it's not working well.\n. fixed in master branch\n. The fact should be all non-type3 fonts are below than they should be, as type3 fonts are rendered as images.\n\nCan you try zoom in and out for a little bit and see if they come to the right position, or even more higher? If so, the position depends on the zoom ratio and the browser behavior.\n. Could you please provide the converted HTML file? As I cannot reproduce it myself.\nIf possible, please convert only 1 page that is affected.\n. I found the reason.\n\nThat part of non-Type3 font is one of the default 14 fonts in PDF, which are not embedded and should be provided by the pdf viewer.\n\nBy default I'll translate them to proper font names, and the final result will depend on the environment of the viewer's browser, which is \"undefined\" theoretically, but should be fine most of the time.\n\nYou can force embedding fonts chosen by poppler, by specifying --embed-base-font 1, which would increase the size of HTML file. \n\nPlease give a try and see if it helps.\n. duplicate of #39 \nyeah, you are right, I'll try to fix this part.\n. A quick hack is to remove pdf2htmlEXl.js from the manifest.\nIf you still need part of its functions, you can disable pre_hide_pages and schedule_render\n. Cannot reproduce it.\nWhat's the version of pdf2htmlEX you are using ? And which options did you specified in the command line?\n. Can you please provide the converted HTML file? \n. what's your compiler and the version?\n\nOn Wed, Jan 23, 2013 at 11:06 PM, John Hewson notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4305166/OCL%202.2%20Spec.html\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/issues/69#issuecomment-12599206.\n.

No\uff0c compressionString is for TIFF only.\nAnd according to the PNGWriter from poppler, currently they use the best\ncompression.\n\nFor now, if you don't embed the image files, you may write a script to\nbatch process them.\n\nAbout integration, usually I won't make hard dependencies because this is\nan optional feature.

As in pdftohtml from poppler, it is possible to specify the format, but it may not be possible to specify the quality or other specific parameters.\n. Um sorry for the confusing, I meant it's possible to specify the format, but not implemented yet.\n. duplicate of #56 \n. It's not about identifying. pdf2htmlEX is a converter, which converts everything shown in a page. And it does not understand which part is for what purpose.\n\nWhat you are looking for should be a PDF manipulating tool, not a conversion tool.\n. Merged.\n\nThanks!\n. I'm not sure about Travis, what is it for? Why do I need it?\n. OK, Thanks for the explanation. I'll try it.\n. Merged & Thanks\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks a lot for the efforts. \n\nI've received many complains about it, and I've been thinking it for a long time, but I've got no elegant solution.\n\nBesides the inline comments, here are a few concerns about it.\n- About the prefix --dont, or verbs with opposite meanings:\n  - It's hard to memorize, unless you support the prefix for all flags, like --enable/disable or --with/without in autoconf.It will be a little bit more confusing while reading the default values, especially squeeze_wide_glyph vs dont_shrink_wide_glyph\n  - It's annoying to change the default value, and there might be compatible problems. For example, when I first implemented auto-hint, it's not mature enough and is turned off by default; but later it can be enabled by default, I have to change it to --dont-auto-hint, and all scripts for older versions of pdf2htmlEX will be invalid.\n  - There are no such problems with the 0/1 solution, neither for --enable/disable or --with/without as in autoconf\n- Coding \n  - I want the parameters names the same as in the struct Param, \n  - Also the orders in Param.h, pdf2htmlEX.cc and manpage should be the same, for easier maintenance.\n  - With the lambda hack, how do you make the sure the default values are 0? I don't see an initialization\n  - And when you use the lambda hack so often, there should be a new feature in ArgParser.\n\nI've thought a default configuration file, written in unix conf style, or JSON. Users can modify it, or specify command line arguments to override them. But it's too complicated and I'm not well motivated.\n\nMaybe we can discuss about the solution before you going on.\n. Just realized that your old lambda hack cannot handle the default values.\n\nThe 0 in ArgParser::add will have no effect, as ArgParser has no idea what your lambda will do.\n.  ArgParser & ArgParser::add(const char \\* optname, const char \\* description, ArgParserCallBack callback)\n{\n    return add<char>(optname, nullptr, 0, description, callback, true);\n}\n\nlocation is nullptr\n. Thanks a lot for the efforts!\n\nThe old `--option-name <arg> (=default) description` came from the boost options library. In the beginning I used boost::options, but later implemented my own ArgParser because I heard complains about the dependency of Boost.\n\nNow it becomes --option-name <arg> description (default is xx), to me, the default value near <arg> looks more convenient. Especially when you are already familar with the names and you don't need to read the descriptions.\n. Yes, I've checked that.\n\nActually I tried a few programs (gcc, latex, etc), only a few of them have\ndefault values shown in their --help.\n\nIn pdf2htmlEX, most options have default values, because most are actually\n0/1 switches, so the looking might be quite different.\n\nLet for now just keep your commit. Maybe in the future I'll change them to\nbe like --[no-]switch\n\nOn Tue, Jan 29, 2013 at 6:33 PM, John Hewson notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> Now it becomes --option-name description (default is xx), to me, the\n> default value near looks more convenient.

Please run with `--debug 1` and provide the output.\n. Sorry, never mind about `--debug 1`.\n\nSeems that the fontforge you are using is from pdf2htmlEX PPA but not the default one provided in Ubuntu repo. Indeed I have not updated it for a while, not sure if that is the problem.\n. @idledk Is it possible for you to update your fontforge?\n\nMeanwhile I will add some debug code to collect more info from your environment.\n. could you please try the `debug` branch, and show me the output\n. I see, indeed the values dumped are quite different from what I got.\n\nSeems that Fontforge cannot read the values correctly, they are all default values (for _, win, typo & hhead)\n. Are you using 32bit or 64bit machine ?\n. hmm.. please try this\n\nrun with `pdf2htmlEX --clean-tmp 0 xxx.pdf`, then in `/tmp/pdf2htmlEX-****`, you will find `f2.cff` and `f2.ttf`.\n\nPlease send me these 2 files.\n. @jahewson so it's still something changed in pdf2htmlEX. But I've got no clues right now.\n. Thanks for the files, let me see what I can get from them.\nUsually we use Dropbox or other public links for sharing files.\n. @idledk seems that somehow fontforge changed em size on your machine.\nCould you please try the latest `debug` branch again? I've added more info.\n. In your log, right after the line `font 1 1.974 -0.42`, there is a `raw em size 1000`. This info is about font f2, which should be retrieved from the raw font dumped from the PDF, i.e. the f2.cff you sent to me. \n\nThis value should be 2048, and the fontforge on my machine reports the correct value from your f2.cff. Also this means that poppler and pdf2htmlEX worked well on your machine.\n\nSo I think that there's something wrong with the Fontforge on your machine.\n\nTo verify this, please open the `f2.cff` with Fontforge, then through the menu:\n\n`Element -> Font Info -> General`, you should see `Ascent 1638; Descent 410; Em Size 2048`, but I guess you will see `800 200 1000`. If it's 1000 indeed, maybe it's a bug of fontforge or some weird & mysterious configuration (compiling flags/libs). \n\nIn a few days, I'll set up a clean ubuntu 12.04 and try to reproduce it.\n\n@jahewson could you please also verify the value 2048?\n. @idledk  Cannot reproduce it in a clean Lubuntu 12.04, the default fontforge shows the correct value...\nI suspect that there are something special in your environment, for example misconfigured env variables, linked libraries etc. Do you have any clues about it? How much difference is your environment from a fresh install?\n. I don't think it's about gs fonts, since the problem now is that\n\"fontforge cannot parse a cff font correctly\".\nI suspect that it's about locale, env variable, libraries or something, but\nI don't have any clue right now...\n\nOn Thu, Feb 28, 2013 at 5:04 PM, idledk notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Hmm, well, must be my installation.

But I guess a relative positioning is necessary.\n. As I have checked, you can remove `position:absolute` at any time as long as you change other codes to maintain the UI.\n\nI've added more comments in the `base.css`, actually most CSS are free to modify. \n. I'll write a wiki page about the default css and js\n. `position:fixed` and `$window` do not make sense to me. It prevents people embedding documents in a small fraction of their web pages.\n\nBut indeed currently it's not easy to show the document in `window`.\n. Visibility of pages are determined by the difference between offsets of\nthat page element and the PDF container element (#pdf-main).\n\nOffsets are relative to `document`, and jQuery does not require any\n`position` properties. So maybe `position:absolute` can be removed.\n\nI'll try it in a few days.\n\nOn Wed, Feb 20, 2013 at 4:22 PM, Deepak notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> $(window) should automatically handle frameset.

I've tested the code, the layout works, but it breaks the js code which determines the visibility of the pages.\n\n`position:absolute` is not necessary, `.offset()` in jQuery always works.\n\nThe lazy page loading code is broken, because now there is no limit on the height of the pdf container. \n\nBut overall, I think `position:fixed` and the usage of `$(window)` reduce the usability, so I'm closing this pull request.\n\nEDIT: page visibility test is not broken, but since the container is tall enough, the pages are always `visible`\n. I won't be available for the next few days, so please allow a few more days for the diagnose.\n. try with the parameter `--squeeze-wide-glyphs 0`\n\nThis parameter is useful when the glyph widths declared in PDF are not the same as in the embedded font, or as in the local matched font.\n\nI'll consider if this should be turned on by default.\n. This issue has nothing to do with space-threshold. It's about font manipulation. If you copy the text out, you should not be able to see extra spaces inserted.\n\nAnd to me, absolute positioning is much more than \"occasional\". I did not hear any complaints about `space-threshold`, so I believe the default value works for most PDF files.\n. This PDF is kind of special, the reason you need to turn off\n`squeeze-wide-glyph` is that the letter \"M\" is much narrower than it looks\nlike. If you select the word in the HTML, you may notice the thin highlight\nbox under \"M\".\n\nThe thin value is the actual width in the font, so if you actually write\n\"Man\" with this font, you will see overlapping between M and a. There is no\noverlapping in this PDF because there is position shift between M and a, or\na is absolute positioned. So logically, there is a quite wide gap there,\nand inserting a space there is \"logically\" correct.\n\nOn the other hand, I cannot simply measure the gap between the actually\nbounding boxes between glyphs, for example the letter 'Q' in the demo page\nof pdf2htmlEX named \"Typography\".\n\nI've just tested this PDF in Adobe Reader X, and I got \"M nagement\" copying\nthat word out.\n. More info, the width of a glyph is how much you should shift the current\nposition horizontally before you can put the next glyph. And bounding box\nis the actual size of the painted area of that glyph.\n\nOn Fri, Feb 22, 2013 at 9:13 PM, \u738b\u7490 coolwanglu@gmail.com wrote:\n\n> This PDF is kind of special, the reason you need to turn off\n> `squeeze-wide-glyph` is that the letter \"M\" is much narrower than it looks\n> like.

The width of  'M' in the font is half as it looks like. Suppose 'M' looks\nlike 2mm width, and 'a' is 1mm width.\nSo for the word \"Management\", from the font renderer's point of view,\nthey're 1cm 'M' + 1cm gap + 1cm 'a'. And it should be OK if we insert a\nspace there.\n\nA larger space-threshold should eat up this space, by design, but also eats\nup all other spaces equal or less than this width, so other parts of the\ndocument might be affected.\n\nThe main problem is the bad info in the embedded font in this PDF.\n\nIn my previous comment (which didn't show up correctly on github), I said \"\nOn the other hand, I cannot simply measure the gap between the actually\nbounding boxes between glyphs, for example the letter 'Q' in the demo page\nof pdf2htmlEX named \"Typography\".\n\nI've just tested this PDF in Adobe Reader X, and I got \"M nagement\" copying\nthat word out.\n\"\n\nSo hope this makes sense to you.\n\nOn Fri, Feb 22, 2013 at 10:23 PM, arski notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Darn.. kind of stupid considering that these PDFs are generated from real\n> text documents of some sort and now you have to reverse-engineer some\n> stupid spaces..\n> \n> Why isn't it possible to measure the gaps then?

In PDF, glyphs are positioned by the origin, so the ascent/descent info in embedded fonts are not useful.\n\nBut in HTML, all positioning rely on ascent/descent, so here I retrieve the actual value (instead of the values from the meta data of the embedded fonts in PDF) with Fontforge.\n\nThere are 3 sets of ascent/descent (win, os2, typo).

Thanks for the patch. \n\nThere might be a security problem if we release too much freedom here, for example '%n'.\nSo in order to support this, I think we need to limit to a few modifiers, and list all of them in the documentation.\nAlso we need to check the format specified by the user, in order to prevent unexpected situations or stack overflow attacks.\n. I've checked the source code of gnuplot, which support customized format for input data, they indeed check and limit the the user-specified format.\n. Thank you for your hard work!

There are too many pages for it. I've just checked `pdftohtml` from poppler, which is able to process the same file very fast. I'll try to find the cause.\n\nOne possible solution is to use multiple threads, since rendering background image of each page is independent to each other. And fortunately, poppler has just become thread-safe since a recent version.\n\nVisibility test, indeed, even harder than #39 where we may simply estimate the clipping path as a rectangle. I've been thinking about this, but no good idea so far. Maybe we may estimate each object by its bounding box, and test the visibility in the preprocessor.\n\nAbout cutting the background image. That should be intuitive and useful, how did you do that?\n\nActually I've tried to dump every image object in PDF and put them directly into HTML. But it did not work due to clipping paths, also there may be other drawing objects.  I also tried to at least detect \"if there is anything on the background\", (there is a bg_integrate branch, which has not been maintained for a while), which did not work well either, since a simple header/footer will make the background nonempty.\n\nIn the bg_integrated path, I also attempted to employ SVG for the visibility issue, but it turned out to be too complicated to me. Crocdoc seems to support render in SVG now, I  never succeeded in viewing them though, they always froze my browsers.\n. @iclems  My email is available in README\n. @jahewson  I wonder if per-path images would introduce too many overhead. For example, why people use CSS sprites? I think maybe we need some clustering algorithms.\n\nAbout polygon clipper, do you know any light-weight geometry libraries, for example CGAL?\n\nAbout image objects can also be clipped, and thus cannot be directly dumped and inserted to HTML.\n. Looks great, but seems that bezier curves are not supported.\n\nBezier curves might be used in cilpping paths, drawing objects. \n\nhmm..\n. @iclems \nFuther tests suggest that pdftohtml was not so fast.\n\nPreviously I was not using the `-c` parameter, such that images are not processed `carefully`\nWith the `-c` paramter, the speed of pdftohtml is similar as pdf2thmlEX (with the same scaling)\n\nI guess this is the best poppler can do (with current parameters)\n. Just realized that #64 is about visibility test\n. The first item seems not to be able to bring performance improvements. Probably the only good thing about it is that it would possibly prevent vertical overlapping caused by rounded font sizes by the browsers, which never happened to me.\n\nI've created HTMLTextPage which allows future optimizations, but the rest part seems to be dull to me.\n\nThe last 2 items have been implemented and indeed improve the performance.\n. I think you can build it as long as you can build poppler & fontforge. \nYou may file new issues if you cannot compile it for ARM.\n. What do you mean by fitting, is `--fit-width` what you want?\n. None is provided by pdf2htmlEX.\nThe first one is about recognition rather than conversion.\nThe second one is a UI feature, you may implement with a few lines of JS.\n. No, IE <= 9 is not supported due to the lack of CSS3 support.\n. https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Browser-Requirements\n.

There are two parts\n- Text with clipping path, as john mentioned, duplicated of #39 \n- Text covered by images, similar as #39 but harder.\n\nBut other problems should have been fixed. Please reopen the issue if the problem still exists.\n. Thanks for reporting.\n\nYes, please provide a sample PDF file.\n\nI'm not sure if it'll be easy to \"physically\" remove them, that parameter actually just triggers a switch of a poppler API.\n. I see. I didn't find an easy way, and this issue can be viewed as a simple case of #39. So marked as duplicated.\n. There are \"hdpi\" and \"vdpi\" available. \n\nIf you mean \"native\" resolution, since all Type 3 fonts and drawing are printed also printed on the background, technically there is no \"native\" resolution.\n.

In the text coordinate system,  current position (tx,ty) marks the origin of the next character.\nDepending on wmode or not, one of `char_dx` and `char_dy` should be 0. (Maybe there are other cases? I'm not 100% sure)\nFor horizontal text, char_dy is 0, and char_dx is the width of the next char.\n\nLet `A=ascent * font_size` and `B=descent * font_size` (B is usually negative)\nThe BBox of the next char should be `(tx, ty+B) - (tx+dx, ty+A)`, so we need to test if this box is completely outside the clipping path.\n.

While reading the code, I kept thinking, it might be easier to use `clip` CSS properties, than detecting inside-or-out ourselves. Further, if we will support all kinds of paths in the future, we can export the path into SVG and use `clip-path`, without doing the complicated job of handling the paths.\n\nAnd to export the rectangles, we just need the values from getClipBBox and the current transform matrix, it would be much easier than the careful jobs done in this pull request.\n\nWhat do you think?\n. Since getClipBBox is in device coordinate system, even current matrix is not relevant...\n. - `GfxState` already provides clip x/y min/max in user space\n- Translating into user space would bring more error in the estimation\n- Actually I don't need coordinates in user-space, the HTML file is in the device space, so probably the format will be\n\n``` html\n<div clip=\"...\">\n<div>text line 1</div>\n<div>text line 2</div>\n</div>\n<!-- clip bbox changed -->\n<div clip=\"...\">\n<div>text line 1</div>\n<div>text line 2</div>\n</div>\n```\n- For each line, if I want to add the `clip` property, I will need to translate the clip-bbox into text-space, not user-space\n. yes, clip is evaluated before transform.\nbut in my example, I created outter div elements for clipping, and\ntransform are applied on inner div elements.\n\nOn Monday, April 8, 2013, John Hewson wrote:\n\n> Yeah that could work, I thought divs were transformed though?

Please reopen with more info\n. I've taken a look at the code of pdftocairo, the output is a multi-page SVG, which is not quite suitable for HTML. I have to make it an svg image per page. I even failed to that since pdftocairo supports a number of formats, and the code was kind of a mess.\n\nI will give it another try will I have time again, but now I know that it is not trivial.\n. @iclems `poppler_page_for_printing` is just a simple wrapper of the `CairoOutputDev` interfaces. In order to remove the text, I guess we still need to work on `CairoOutputDev`, like what I did with `SplashOutputDev`. \n\nBut a problem is that this interface use its won Font embedding and text placement systems, but ideally we want it the same way as in HTML, more precisely, use `@font-face` and CSS to specify fonts. And I don't know how to do that.\n\nThere is a pretty old branch called `bg_integrate`, which saves my early attempt, you may want to take a quick glance, but the code was a mess.\n\nYou are very welcome to do it now, as I've marked this issue as `future`, which means I don't expect enough time working on this in a near future.\n\nThanks.\n. A (very) experimental implementation of SVG support is in the `svg` branch, which can be turned on with `-DENABLE_SVG=ON` cmake option. It disables the old png backend automatically.\n. Now the format can be specified at run time.\nI guess this issue can be closed now.\n. Can you provide a sample PDF?\n\nUsually (unless it is a bug) pdf2htmlEX never duplicates fonts. So the reason you got too many fonts should be that there _are_ actually those _different_ fonts in the PDF. Here different fonts means different objects in PDF, which have different IDs.\n\nAnd pdf2htmlEX (so far) does not detect duplicated fonts by the shape of glyphs.\n. I found that there are font comparison functions in Fontforge. So theoretically duplicated fonts can be detected and merged. But it might be quite slow.\n\nPlease provide a sample PDF for debugging.\n\nAs this is not a critical  issue right now, please do not expect that it will be fixed soon.\n. Done. Please remove it.\n\nThanks!\n. For an embedded font, how do you know if it is 'common' or not?\n\nOn Tue, May 7, 2013 at 10:06 PM, fmalina notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> For common fonts, such as Verdana, Arial, Georgia etc., is is possible to\n> skip embedding entirely and just write css such as font-family: verdana,\n> sans-serif?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/issues/117#issuecomment-17544080\n> .\n. Sometimes yes. If you have installed poppler, there is a command `pdffonts` available. The first column shows the names.\n\nThe names are not reliable. The accuracy of the HTML depends on the metrics of the glyphs and the encoding of the font. There may be two sets of metrics stored in a PDF, one is defined in the embedded font, and the other stored in the font descriptor in PDF. When they are not consistent, the second one should be used, which means the font have to be transformed -- which can not be done by the browser.\n\nEncoding, if you expect a good font at the client side, the text must be encoded in Unicode correctly, which is not reliable either -- there are too many PDF files whose text cannot be copied out correctly.\n\nSince PDF is not designed for Web, actually I don't see these fonts often used in PDF (except for Times), at least in my test cases. You may verify this use `pdffonts`.\n\nSo my point is that it might be worth it to do so. But later I may export the embedded names in CSS, such that you may do post-procssing if you wan. And this should be done carefully since malicious code could be injected in this way.\n. Well, actuall the bold variant is a new font, Usually a bold font is not\njust the regular font with wider strokes, since lots of tuning would be\nnecessary. Although it is possbile to simulate that by setting\n`font-weight` in CSS, I don't want to do the recognition here.\n\nDuplicated fonts, actually, is what a PDF generator should concern, not\nthis converter. But I will try to make it smarter if a local font is\nmatched for multiple external fonts in PDF.\n\nOn Wednesday, May 8, 2013, drinkupper wrote:\n\n> I admire the depth of your knowledge on the subject.\n> Having a font name, available at least as a clue would be valuable for\n> post processing.

My thought about this issue is that the fonts are not introduced by pdf2htmlEX, they have been there in the PDF file. So probably you are looking for a PDF optimization tool. \n\npdf2htmlEX is meant to be a conversion tool, so if there are multiple fonts in the PDF file, there should also be in the HTML output. \n\nImagine a JPG->PNG tool, you don't expect it will retouch the images for you, do you?\n. Please refer to https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Unfeatures for an explanation of what pdf2htmlEX does not do. Sorry for having lasting this so long.\n. @Toneti777  That's actually what I mean, if you can do that with a PDF optimizer, you should do it. While pdf2htmlEX is focused only on conversion. \n\nYou can always optimize the PDF file before feed it into pdf2htmlEX.\n. @Toneti777 And please remove the links, if necessary I might ask you for some smaller examples. Thanks.\n. OK, that sounds like a bug of pdf2htmlEX. Is it possible for you to provide a smaller file?\n. Hi @Toneti777 , I have checked both lne and lne_opt, according to the `pdffonts` command, they have exactly the same (132) fonts embedded. \n\nWhat kind of optimizations did you apply?\n. @Toneti777 Yes, I see that in Adobe Reader. Let me check if this is something defined in the PDF standard, or some trick done by the reader.\n. @Toneti777 Seems that there is only one font \u201cstored\", other fonts refer to the same binary with different encodings. This can be done in PDF but unfortunately I don't find a counterpart in HTML. Currently I have to store separated, reencoded fonts in HTML.\n\nOn the other hand, such fonts might be merged into one if their encodings are same. But this should be out of scope of pdf2htmlEX.\n. @Toneti777 Yes, you points make sense, this is indeed something extra created by pdf2htmlEX, so I'm opening it.\n\nBut right now I don't have a good solution for it. I'll think about it.\n. @Toneti777 Unfortunately I have not found the solution yet. I'm not sure if this happens for only specific PDF files or a number of them.\n\nAlso there doesn't seems to be others suffering from this issue, which keeps this issue at a low priority. Maybe you can consider sponsor this issue and see if any one else would like to solve it. \n. @mickgiles I've updated the issue description. The comparison part is more like a PDF optimization job. The one concerned here is about encodings.\n. @mickgiles Please first check (with `pdffonts`) if there are actually many fonts in the PDF, otherwise it may be the linking case here. \nThere is a tool called `sfddiff` in fontforge, not sure if that will work for you. Also you might try to write Fontforge scripts with python or its native syntax.\nhttp://fontforge.org/scripting-tutorial.html\nhttp://fontforge.org/python.html\n. @duanyao Yes indeed, that should be optimized without much difficulties.\n\nBut sometimes I would hesitate about these features. Do you think that there should be a PDF optimizer for this, or this feature should be integrated into a converter?\n. @duanyao Thanks for your input!\n. [Wiki page] added. \nI wonder if @Toneti777 could verify it works for the original issue. \n. Yes, it's a bug of FontForge.\nI guess you should probably make more comments there such that more attentions could be drawn.\nCurrently maybe you can use the 'tmp' branch of my Fontforge fork, but there is no guarantee...\n. @oknoorap As I've mentioned above, please use my fork of fontforge right now. I'll also update README later.\n. Please post the result of `git branch`\n. As mentioned in the message, you should install `gettext` which provides the `msgfmt` command\n. Installation of what?\n\nBtw, if you are using Ubuntu, you can install Fontforge from my PPA, which you can found in the 'Download' wiki page.\n. OK great :)\n. @easytag please post the following things\n\noutput of `git branch`\nthe first few lines of the output of `git log`\nthe `config.log` file\n. @easytag seems that it's about collab\nplease try `./configure --without-libzmq --without-x --without-iconv --disable-python-scripting --disable-python-extension`\n. OK, I'll add something like `--printing 0/1`\n. If you only want to reduce the file size, actually I just found that using `rem` in CSS might be a good idea.\n. Done.\n. The problem is that the PDF file refer to external fonts, whose info in unavailable in PDF.\nTry the `--embed-external-font` parameter\n. Yes, I saw the crash too. It should be something wrong in Fontforge.\nFor now, please use `--remove-unused-glyph 0`\n. @ankit042 I've found that the problematic font cannot be parsed by FontForge correctly. It complained about `/BaseFontname`.\n\nI'm not sure about the syntax, but seems that the font is derived from another font, which cannot be located by FontForge. I'll check the PDF spec again.\n. .page is not a standalone HTML file, it contains just necessary DOM elements, which is for dynamic page loading.\n\nPlease read the manpage about parameters for specifying pages and width.\n. I will update it soon. Since PPA is for people who do not want to compile the source, usually I upload only stable versions. \n. I noticed this issue before, it should be something wrong with Fontforge.\nTry the parameter `--remove-unused-glyph 0`\n. Oops, sorry about that.\n. Please allow a few days before I will have time to diagnose this issue.\n. Which version of FontForge are you using?\n. @SapraJI  I cannot reproduce crash with your pdf, please specify your OS environment, and the output of `pdf2htmlEX -v`\n. @SapraJI @ankit042 Oh I can reproduce it now.  which was about `--split-pages`. Not sure if this is the issue you have seen. Could you please try the latest git version?\n. @SapraJI Oh that was a subtle bug due to my ugly design. The memory was not correctly handled while building the file names for splitted pages.\n. @ankit042 It seems to be about space or text optimization. I'll create a separate issue for it.\nAbout speed, yes, it has been a long issue, the slowest parts are font processing and background image generation.\n\nFont processing is done with FontForge, whose code is quite a mess to me, and I don't believe it is thread safe. Maybe I will be able to speed it up by using multiple processes.\n\nAbout background image generation, I've started to investigate, seems that it is possible, since poppler has just become thread-safe.\n\nBut anyway speed is not as important as accuracy and stability to me, I think I'll focus on crashing and inaccuracy bugs first.\n. What is the full message? The message should have the content of the line printed out.\n. Hmm, so it looks like an empty line. Can you please post your manifest file? The file should be locate data-dir, try `pdf2htmlEX -v`\n\nAnd did pdf2htmlEX produce a good HTML output?\n. @dpfranklin Hmm, I cannot produce it. But I guess it's about white spaces.\nI've add line numbers in the error log, and the spaces are now be trimmed for each line. \n\nCan you please try the latest git version, and see if the message is still there?\n. OK, I'm closing it.\n. @anurag29  use `--single-html 0`?\n\nBut in that case no file will be embedded. Do you want only base.css while others still being embedded?\n. OK, I think I will implement paramters like `--embed-css`, `--embed-image` etc.\n. #141 opened.\nFor now, a workaround is to use `--clean-tmp 0`, such that you can find the components in the temp dir. But you will have to clean the dir manually then.\n. Thanks for reporting, I'm diagnosing.\n. [3rd], please try `--embed-external-font 1`, maybe I need to make it default, since there are many reports regarding this parameter\n\n[4th], I cannot reproduce it, may be it is because I'm using a newer version of Fontforge. Is it possible for you to update your FontForge?\n\nI'm not sure about your problem, what do you mean by 'typography-wise improvements'. I'm new to specific typography design.\n\nBTW the table is cool! Have you published any results of your comparison? I may need to 'steal' (I mean learn) more ideas from them.\n. It's actually [a bug of FontForge](https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge/issues/465). I'm now trying to work with them to fix it.\n\nFor now, please use my fork [https://github.com/coolwanglu/fontforge/tree/tmp], the `tmp` branch.\n. Are you using the latest git version? Probably I will need to add a git signature in `-v`.\nIf so, it must be a regression that I cannot reproduce :(\nCan you specify your environment?\n. @szepeshazi  Is it 32bit or 64bit? I've got a few VM available, so let me try to reproduce it.\n. @szepeshazi Oh I cannot reproduce it. So please provide your VM image.\n. @szepeshazi  Thanks! I can reproduce it in your VM image. Will come back later.\n. @szepeshazi OK, so I've found the cause. I guess you won't see the problem if you install the `gsfonts` package.\n\nIn your environment, poppler choose a different font, which pdf2htmlEX cannot handle correctly. I'll try to fix it.\n. @szepeshazi Please try the latest git again.\n\nSeems that the 'vertical shifting' info was not cleared when necessary.\n. Oh I mean I've got the bug fixed, so you may remove `gsfonts` if you like.\n\nI'm not sure about what you meant by 'decline in text readability', I just see font changed, both are OK to me (ubuntu 13.04 + Fx 21). But I'm not an font expert so I don't trust my 'OK'.\n\nWhat's your environment of viewing the HTML? Can you please provided the screenshot of the HTML files?\n. @szepeshazi Oh yes, Chrome on Windows is lack of font hinting. I strongly recommend ttfautohint, which should help a lot. Alternatively you may use something like `-webkit-font-smoothing` or similar CSS tricks, but I don't like them.\n\nAnd thank you for your input, this bug is tricky!\n. A workaround has been implemented.\n. @vineet89 seems that it's about the '-' symbols in the previous column, which are missing.\nI'll work on it.\n. @vineet89 Found the cause. The PDF maps the normal '-' into a soft hyphen, and the browsers will hide the symbol since the line does not break there. So essentially it's because the PDF provides a bad encoding.\n\nPlease update to the latest git version, and use `--to-unicode=-1`, which should fixes the problem.\n\nHowever I'll need to test with more files, this behaviour may be changed later.\n. @vineet89  Did you update your git repo? I can see a correct output here.\n\nLet me briefly explain this:\n\nIn PDF there are two set of encodings, one for displaying (such that a PDF viewer can choose the correct glyphs to show), and the other is for text extraction (such that you can get correct text if you copy & paste). But there can be only one set in HTML, and sometimes it is not possible to achieve both visual accuracy and text accuracy (at least for now). \n\nIn the case of this PDF file, the situation is slightly different, but if you select \"xx-Nov-2012\" and copy them out from a PDF viewer, I guess you don't see the hyphens, and the reason is that those are soft-hyphens, which should not be. This is provided by the '2nd set of encoding', and fortunately the 1st encoding is correct, and `--to-unicode=-1` forces pdf2htmlEX to use that set if possible. (When the 1st set is not even correct, there is no parameter right now, but maybe I can work out one)\n\nFor strictly standard compliant well-formed PDFs, you never need to worry about these issues, but in the wild world of PDF, I'm afraid that it might not be possible to find a set of parameters that works for all.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some possible hackings \n- Just convert all soft-hyphens into normal hyphens, since this symbol has special meaning in Unicode\n- Mark `soft-hyphens` as invalid, just as NBSP\n\nBut none of them are perfect solutions, the first one may break the layout when both normal hyphens and soft hyphens appears in the font; and the second still does not give you correct text.\n\nI wonder if I may hear some suggestions from you?\n. @vineet89 Currently I decide to mark 'soft hyphen' as invalid, such that by default the HTML is visually correct.\nThis behaviour might be changed in the future, I hope I can find a better design later.\n. @vineet89  The two sets of encodings are stored in the PDF, which can be any mappings. Currently if you add `--debug 1` and `--clean-tmp 0`, you will be able to find both sets of encodings in `/tmp/pdf2htmlEX-xxx`.\n\nI've just tried again, and pdf2htmlEX gives correct output without any parameters. Please let me know if it doesn't work for you.\n. @vineet89 great!\n. A same reason as discussed in #117. Maybe this feature should be removed.\n. Removed.\n. This behaviour has been stated in the manpage actually. \n\nIn PDF there are two set of encoding, one for rendering and the other is for text extraction. But in HTML there is only one.\n\n`space-as-offset`, as a workaround option, now reads only the first set. Maybe I can add a new value to double check the other encoding. \n\nFor now it's recommended to turn if off unless there are many positional spaces there, anyway this option has no (good) effect where there is no positional spaces.\n. Maybe I can add a new value for this option, such that both encodings are checked. But anyway this option is a workaround, so let me just wait for more reports about it.\n\nThanks for reporting.\n. Did you read the wiki pages? \nE.g.\nhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/QuickStart\n. Oh I didn't understand your question, what do you mean by \"next page\" and \"previous page\"?\n. I see. So seems that you may need to retrieve some info in HTML, \nprobably with JavaScript.\n\nCurrently there's no simple way to do that, and you have to hack it \nyourself. For example you can create an invisible DOM element with some \ninfo store in its attributes.\n. Please read the manpage and about the `--zoom` and `--fit-*`  parameters. \nAlso the wiki pages I've mentioned above.\n. Hi, I didn't realized that there was nothing about `--zoom`, sorry about that.\nWhy do you create a new issue anyway? You can still comment in the old one.\n\nYou can zoom the page by just passing something like `--zoom 1.5` to the program.\n. @micred I noticed that for an empty background, the image would be 7kb... which is too large. Of course you can compress it in this case, but I am not sure about the compression ratio when  there are many small pieces.\n\n@iclems's code records the bounding box of each stroke, and merges all overlapping ones. The result is a number of parts occpied in the background, which are not overlapping. The results are pretty good for my samples. In case that there are too many of them, I think I can pack them into one and use CSS sprite.\n\nGeneral PNG compression may be applied after that, they are not exclusive.\n. @iclems  See https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/issues/116\n\nIt has been planned. And actually I had spent a couple of weeks on that. But there's lots of works to do, since most svg are not optimized for web.\n\nAnd there are other problems, for example text in svg are not selectable in Firefox etc..\n.

I really don't want to put too much efforts into supporting legacy browsers, there are even people asking about IE6 and Firefox 2...\n\nBut there is `--fallback` available, which might be what you want.\n. Still about 'fallback', the size and position should be actually the same as in the normal mode, this parameter was originally designed for text that are covered by images, which should be hidden, but pdf2htmlEX would reveal them by design. Therefore if normal mode does not work, fallback mode won't either.\n\nThere are probably two problems, font and size. About font perhaps #83 would help, with woff or eot. It would be implemented in the future, probably when woff becomes popular. But My problem is that I don't have a Windows that I can install softwares... I am not against patches though, as long as they don't bring in too many ugly workarounds.\n\nAbout size, I remember that IE 8 does not support CSS transform? In that case, you may want to try setting 'font-size-multiplier' to 1, which might work (maybe even for normal mode).\n\nSorry that I don't have the environment to verify my guesses.\n. Still I think the compatibility to IE8 is not a worthy job. There are quite a few essential things that have to be compromised. So I'm closing this issue.\n\nThanks for reporting.\n. Can you please post a screenshot and specify your environment?\n. @micred Are you using IE8? `rescale` actually uses CSS `transform`.\n. I see, `rescale` has been inconsistent with the content now. I'll try to fix it.\n\nBut right now `rescale` is not used anywhere by default. Kind of abandoned.\n. 'em' is not likely to work, since it cascades. I've been thinking about\nusing 'rem', which should work, but might not be a good idea for embedding\ndocuments.\n\nOn Tue, May 7, 2013 at 10:11 PM, micred notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> I was wondering: can I use a relative unit of measurement (em in place of\n> pt) and change font-size to zoom content?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/issues/137#issuecomment-17544435\n> .\n.

Yes, seems so. So the function was implemented when there was no `pd`, and has not been updated accordingly since them. I'll fix it in a few days.\n. I'm not getting it. Can you please elaborate the 'but fram eis not tied to' part?\n. Hi, now I'm coming back for this issue.\n\nPlease elaborate more about your solution with `pl`, I'm feeling that we can apply CSS transformation on `pf` without introductin a new `<div>`, but I'll change `pf` to absolute width/height\n. Ah, now I truly understand what you meant 'not tied'. Let me try to figure it out...\n. Originally, `pf` was introduced to hold the place when `pc` is scaled. At that moment there was no `pd`.\n\nI guess now we can move `pf` outside `pd` to do the trick, what do you think? I may create a branch for this.\n. Oh I found something while trying to do this.\n\n`pf` was introduced to help locate page and determine if a page is visible. There should be no border of it because of the offset calculation.\n\nNow the border (of `pd`) and the transformation might cause problems for that part of code, let me see if it can be resolved.\n. I mean the broders for `pd`\n. Haven't finished yet. I'll show you later.\n. Please check out the `rescale_fix` branch. Seems that there's no problem as I predicted.\nCan you please test your rescale fixes there?\n. I guess I can close this issue due to your pull request?\nThanks!\n. Recently I removed page_decoration without hurting the visibility test of each page. I also test the code without smooth rescaling, which seems to work, so I removed that part of code. Would you like to have a try the `dev` branch?\nThanks!\n. Yes, that would involve lots of work about recognition. \n\nFor example I'm not sure if there is an easy way to extract the title, given that there are so many LaTeX templates, and some documents don't even have a title.\n. I cannot reproduce it. Which version are you using? Please post the output of `pdf2htmlEX -v`\n. Can you please also send me the output HTML for the first page (use `-l 1`)?\n. Um, seems that attachments in email don't work here. Maybe use public links like pastebin,gist or dropbox?\n. I see, it's about clipping, which have been implemented in the git version.\n\nSeems that you need to update your pdf2htmlEX and try again.\n. Are you using `--optimize-text 1`? If so, please disable it for now. There is a bug about it.\n. \u8fd9\u4e2a\u4e0d\u5c5e\u4e8e\u201c\u6587\u4ef6\u683c\u5f0f\u8f6c\u6362\u201d\u7684\u8303\u7574\u4e86\uff0cpdf2htmlEX\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u662f\u8ba9HTML\u6839\u539f\u59cbPDF\u4e00\u6837\u3002\n. Done.\n. Ok, so this issue affects many people. It's just been mentioned in #125 and I've opened #141 for a possible solution.\n\nSorry about the inconvenience, the reason I made this change is that actually the original design was ugly, there were many people asking about how to combine the components together, and I did think that this should be a master HTML file.\n\nFor now, here are a few options:\n- Revert the commit for #125 and wait for #141 \n- Use `--clean-tmp 0` and find the components there\n- Remove everything in `manifest` except for the line `$css`\n\nAnd please except about 1-2 weeks before I will have time for this issue. Thanks.\n. @anurag29  base.css and fancy.css can be found in `<data-dir>` (check `pdf2htmlEX -v`)\n. @akwok currently there is no way to remove the tags, you might want to do some post processing.\nSorry for the inconvenience.\n. A new set of options: `--embed` and `--embed-***` have been implemented. You can now specify whether to embed each specific type of element.\n\nPlease have a try.\n. I cannot reproduce it. I can get the file converted on my machine.\n\nThe 'Bus error' error looks mytersious to me.\n\nCan you please show the result of `pdf2htmlEX -v`?\n. Do you see this error for other PDF files? And how about use `-l 10` to limit the number of pages for this PDF?\n. Currently there's no way to simply skip one page, however you can use `-f 1 -l 40` to select the first 40 pages, and you can use `-f 42` to select the the 42nd and the following pages.\nIf you really want to combine them, you may want to process the PDF file with tools like pdftk.\n\nThere is no problem for me to compile the 40-42 pages. \n\nI'm not sure about the 'bus error' message, I'll try to do some research on this.\n. Right, that would make sense.\n\nRight now there is no way to combine the html files, but actually I don't recommend you to combine them, since the HTML file will try to load all the pages, which might blow your device up. Have you tried to view the 100-page HTML on your Kindle?\n. @arjun-iyer  I guess I can close this issue?\n. OK, then I'll try to gather more information about it.\n\nOn Sat, May 18, 2013 at 2:59 PM, arjun-iyer notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> It does occur for some pages though.

Still the info is not sufficient, please reopen with more info.\n. Thanks for reporting.\n\nPlease post CMakeCache and version of your g++\n. Also please test if your can compile the following source code with `-std=c++0x`\n\n``` c++\nint main(){ auto i = 0; return 0; }\n```\n. Please reopen this issue when you can provide more information.\n. please read the manpage about the process-nontext parameter.\n. Thank you very much for your effort!\n\nPlease add yourself in `AUTHORS'`, and review my comments.\n. Thanks for reporting.\n\n#62 was about the text selection issue.\n\nIn earlier versions, images were actually placed with `background-image`. And I switched it to the img tag for an easier printing. On fx or chrome users have to tweak the setting to print background images, and the one in fx was not easy to find. Also I had to use js to disable dragging in the same way as in the current version.\n. Suppose that text and image are not overlaid, #213 could be a cure.\n. Please read the manpage about the `--dest-dir` parameter.\n. It's been planned, but I've got no sample files.\nPlease provide a few if possible.\nThanks.\n. @leonzinger Can you please provide a screenshot of a correct rendering? Since I've got no idea about the Hebrew language.\n. I've added a css there, hopefully it would work.\n\nPlease try the latest git version.\n\nHowever I guess that if you copy the text out, still you get the reversed string, the problem is that in PDF the character are indeed placed from left to right. \n\nFor now, at least I want the visual is correct, such that people can read the document.\n. I see that a \"Hello\" word in RTL language (such that you actually want to see \"olleH\") in placed left to right, char-by-char in PDF, such that it would be \"olleH\" in a normal (LTR) environment. After all PDF is designed for printing, so this is reasonable. \n\nHowever the browser would recognize the Hebrew characters and try to use the \"correct\" direction, such that it would be reversed again, into \"Hello\", which is wrong.\n\nThe best solution is to recognize the characters and reverse it, such that we can copy the correct text out. But I don't see a simple solution, given the complicated character positioning rules and the possibility of mixed usage of LTR and RTL languages.\n. Can anyone please verify if this has been fixed?\n. Please reopen this issue if the problem still exists.\n. Please check the `--process-outline` option.\n. manpage is actually pretty standard, and actually I have mentioned some where, e.g. [this wiki page](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/QuickStart).\n\nCreating a wiki page may not be easy to maintain, since the the options are likely to change. But I'll add a notice there.\n\nThanks!\n. Thanks for the patch.\n\nI hid the object because I didn't expect people would use my JS code. And there might be a problem if there are multiple `pdf2htmlEX.Viewer`s in a single HTML. How would you plan to deal with that?\n. Oh my previous comment may not make much sense. And I think it'd be OK to export it.\n\nI'd suggest a few changes:\n- Move the reference into the `pdf2htmlEX` namespace object, or maybe even inside `pdf2htmlEX.Viewer`\n- 'pdf2htmlEXViewerInstance` does not look like a perfect name to me, but I've got no better ones.\n. Viewer cannot be made singleton, because there can be multiple viewers in a single window. Here we are just talking about the single Viewer used in the default HTML template.\n\nI wanted `pdf2htmlEX` works like a namespace, such that there is as least name pollution as possible -- everything introduced in pdf2htmlEX will be inside `window.pdf2htmlEX`. It's something like `std::cout` in C++. \n\nHow about `pdf2htmlEX.defaultViewer`?\n. And please add yourself to `AUTHORS` :) I'll merge then.\n. Thanks for reporting.\nIt looks like a bug, and I'll try to diagnose.\n. And what options did you use for the conversion?\n. I cannot reproduce it. Which version of pdf2htmlEX are you using?\n. OK, so I see you are not using the latest version and `--optimize-text` is on by default, which is buggy.\n\nWhich version of Ubuntu are you using? I'll update the PPA.\n. PPA updated. Please try again.\n. Thanks for reporting.\n\nI cannot reproduce it. I can convert it with the default option.\n\nPlease specify your environment, provide the output of `pdf2htmlEX -v` and the log of conversion with option `--debug 1`\n. Tables in PDF are nothing but grid positioned text with line drawing. \nAnd pdf2htmlEX does not recognize them.\n. Please reopen this issue with a stack trace.\n. Thanks for reporting. \n\nI see strings like `\\n/Type /Pattern\\n` in the log, which are raw PDF materials, so I guess it's about poppler.\n\nCan you please also try `pdf2cairo` or `evince` (or other PDF viewers based on poppler) and see if they suffer from the same issue?\n. OK, I'll close it then.\n. Yes, I can reproduce it.\n\nThanks for reporting.\n. Should have been just fixed.\nPlease try the git version again.\n. Please reopen this issue if the problem still exists.\n. I cannot reproduce it.\n\nPlease show me the output of `pdf2htmlEX -v`\n. @bilalmughal Do you see a similar crash if you use `pdftohtml -c -s` on the same PDF file?\n. @bilalmughal  I usually use the git version.\n. You can modify the `manifest` file and remove the line for jquery.\n. Thanks!\n. Yes, I see what you mean.\nYou may want to take a look at the `embed_file` function in `src/HTMLRenderer/general.cc`.\n`resource_path` looks a little bit confusing to me, at the first glance I thought that it's about the resources of pdf2htmlEX. Maybe `resource_prefix` ?\n. Can you please provide the following information:\n- output of `pdf2htmlEX -v`\n- a link of the problematic PDF file\n- your OS spec (OS, version, 32/64 etc)\n. Hi, I cannot reproduce it. But I did hear about the crash on Mac OS.\n\nCan you provide a stack trace? Or it'd be almost impossible for me to debug.\n. Please reopen this issue with a stack back trace\n. Thanks for the patch.\nI'm new to Travis CI, I'll try to figure it out.\n. I tried to add it in travis ci, hopefully it will work.\n. No for now. \nI might need to introduce a prefs system later...something like in Firefox.\n. Seems that double-tap & hold triggers the word selection, while the normal letter-by-letter selection is not working.\n\nRight now I cannot find the cause, I'm not quite familiar with safari.\n. @josefnorlin text are already above the background image.\n. I've found the cause, and I think I've fixed it.\nCan you please try the git version?\n. FIXED confirmed by email.\n. I cannot confirm this, please provide the output of `pdf2htmlEX -v`\n. NOT VALID confirmed by email.\n. Hi @rcampbell , I just checked this issue again. The causes are:\n- Browsers will round the font sizes specified in the page. [ref](http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2010/02/10/rounding-off/)\n  - That's why `--font-size-multiplier` works\n- In your PDF, a sentence is cut into two parts, the second part has a clipping path and therefore the two parts cannot be merged. Now due to the problem above, the first part is longer than we expected, so the end of the first part will overlap with the beginning of the second half.\n\nThis is indeed an issue of pdf2htmlEX, but probably not a 'bug'. So far I have no good solutions in my mind.\n\nThe vertical shift issue might be compensated by a smaller value of `--veps`.\n\nFinally, I wonder why `--space-as-offset` would help, can you please give an example?\n. please use `--dest-dir`\n. why `pdf2htmlEX.js.in` is now executable (755)?\n. Looks great! Thanks!\n\nPlease check out my comments.\n. OK, I think we're ready to merge this.\nThank you very much for your efforts!\n. A CSS rules might be used for multiple pages. So separating them will likely to increase the size a lot.\nOn the other hand you may use -f and -l to generate a stand-alone html for each pdf page.\n. I cannot reproduce this.\n\nWhat's the output of `pdf2htmlEX -v`, and which version of getopt are you using?\n. The comments are useless in CSS, I don't want to expose them, plus I have to handle special characters in order to prevent injection.\nHow about export them in a log file?\n. I think I will add the name to the list of font-family, which should make sense.\n. @drinkupper Now I make font names printed if you use the `--debug 1` parameter, is that enough for you?\n\nI've just checked the CSS standard about identity names, and there are quite some rules, e.g. an identity name cannot start with a digit. So I don't think it's easy and safe to put it in `font-family`. But debug output is always safe to me.\n. Please reopen if necessary.\n. I am not sure about your question, there is an option for the output filenames.\n. Thanks for reporting.\n\n I have just tested evernote clipper with one of the demo pages, and I found some problems :+1: \n- Only the first page is shown\n  - To make it smoother, only the visible pages are rendered, others are hidden. This is handled by Javascript. You may remove the lines of js from the manifest file\n-  The background\n  - You may edit base.css for that\n- Wrong fonts\n  - Seems that the clipper cannot handle embedded fonts correctly. Or maybe there are options I do not know.\n. For now, I don't think any evernote-specific features should be added to pdf2htmlEX, which has nothing to do with the pdf-to-html conversion.\n\nAnd so far I don't know what I can do about the font problem, it's more like an issue of the clipper.\n. `--optimize-text` is still buggy, and that's why I disable it by default.\nI'll work on it later, and there's no other way of optimizations so far.\n. Hi @myusernameistaken , I'm now trying to tackle this issue, can you please provide the pdf file?\n. I made a fix, can you please try the latest git repo and see if we have a better result?\n. Yes, I'm aware of this. It's mostly because the height of the pdf container is fixed, so technically the browser does not see anything outside the screen.\n\nUsually I don't work on UI stuffs, but I will be glad to merge if you can create a patch.\n. I guess a few lines of JavaScript should work.\n. Although #181 is merged, it is not enabled by default. I think I'll add a new parameter for this.\n. Thanks for your patch!\n\nPlease check my comments.\n. Don't worry about the `window` stuff, let's see if any one will complain about this.\n\nPlease review my new comments, also don't forget to add yourself in `AUTHORS`\n. Don't worry about the `window` stuff, let's see if any one will complain about this.\n\nPlease review my new comments, also don't forget to add yourself in `AUTHORS`\n. Manually merged. While I still have to disable the key handler by default, I'll try to work out a way for that.\nThanks!\n. oops..\n\nThank you very much!\n. Have you tried `ttfautohint` ? You may find more info in the wiki.\n. @iapain OK, I'll check it out, probably it will be the default if everything is fine.\n. According to http://caniuse.com woff is not widely supported as ttf, actually only on android mobile.\n\nThe main problem here is still about hinting, I'm not quite sure if I need to add hinting information there for Windows, if so, I don't find a counterpart for ttfautohint right now.\n. @iapain  I'll try on my windows machine later.\n. According to my tests, woff is better in both size and visual effect (comparing with ttf without ttfautohint).\nHowever I found a few bugs for Firefox/Chrome on Linux, probably further due to their backend parsing woff.\n\nI think we will definitely switch to woff, but still we need more time. Currently ttf+ttfautohint seems still to be the best solution overall.\n. #83 is relevant.\n. Currenty if `--font-format=woff` is used, seems that all italic text cannot be rendered correctly in Firefox + Windows.\n\nIt seems to be my fault though.\n. I tried with the `demo.pdf` in `README`. The fonts seem to be OK (viewed in font viewer), but some italic ones are not recognized by browsers.\nI think I can make woff the default type after fixing this issue.\n. ironically, those fonts work well in IE\n. filed a new issue #238\n. `woff` is the default format now.\n. Thanks for your effort. I've not finished reading your code, but seems that you are trying to draw the intermediate frames with JS, which are too heavy weighted to me... I wonder if a smooth animation is worthy for that much of CPU usage.\n\nBTW, I cannot merge this right now, since you add global handlers, which might affect existing users. I'm planning to create a 'standalone mode', where we are free to add UI features.\n. By global handlers I meant those registered in `zoom_fixer`.\n\nThere are a few problems in the JS codes I can see so far:\n1. There have been some people who were complaining about the high cpu usage of existing dom elements, so I wonder if it'll be OK to add more cpu intensive features. Usually people do not use my JS codes, they build their UI themselves, so I don't received complaints about UI features often.\n2. The JS codes is not well organized, partially because I did not expect people use my code. I'll try to reorganize and add more comments inside. Meanwhile, I think some of your code are not easy to understand, e.g. `NR_PAGES_TO_PRERENDER_ON_ZOOM`, what can you tell from this name, even with the following comments?\n\nI'll go on reading your code and make comments if necessary.\n\nThanks!\n. @micred  I will merge them of course, I just need to make sure there won't be bad side effects.\n. Merged. Thanks!\n\nBut I'll still disable `zoom_fixer` by default.\n. Please do a thorough remake (make clean && cmake . && make) if you have updated poppler.\n\nAlso please provide the affected pdf for debug.\n\nThanks.\n. @doublex It seems to be something wrong with FontForge. I'll try to fix it.\n. @doublex I think I have fixed it. Please try the lastest git version.\n. Can you check the location of poppler header files? Where are they stored?\n. Please specify which version and where have fontforge installed.\n. @git4ajay Your version of FF is too old, please review the dependencies of pdf2htmlEX. \n. Please reopen if the issue still exists with a recent version of FF\n. There's no unicode information in the pdf file. \nIf you open the pdf file with a pdf viewer, then try to copy and paste some text, you won't see much meaningful characters.\n. \u8bf7\u63d0\u4f9bpdf\u6587\u4ef6\u4f9b\u8c03\u8bd5\uff0c\u8c22\u8c22\n. \u6211\u770b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e0b\uff0c\u6ca1\u53d1\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\u3002\n\u4f60\u7684pdf2htmlEX\u7248\u672c\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u5206\u522b\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f\n. \u8bf7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u6807\u8bb0reopen\n. I've checked your code, I see you added a new dependency for the mkdtemp implementation. \n\nI don't think it's good here, ideally I want a simple implementation which relies on windows header files only. For example, the implementation on http://oku.edu.mie-u.ac.jp/~okumura/texwiki/?pdf2htmlEX#d9c5cb24 looks good to me.\n. I'm afraid that I cannot merge this pull request right now. I really don't want to introduce extra dependencies, especially for Windows, which is not a main supported OS by pdf2htmlEX.\n\nProbably the best solution is to use random numbers or PID. I'll just wait for some one improve the patch.\n. @witwall we still need the headers files for only one function, which doesn't seems to worth it. Also poppler can be built without glib, we don't want those users install glib only for this function.\n\nI briefly checked your library, but did not find the code for Windows, I wonder if how long is that part? After all in the site I mentioned previously, there are only less than 20 lines.\n. Actually in earlier versions of pdf2htmlEX I did use `mktemp` for this, but if you read the documentation about `mkstemp`, their might be race conditions in `mktemp`. This could be a problem when you run multiple instances of pdf2htmlEX at the same time.\n\nThis is also the reason that I have not merged the solution on Tex Wiki\n. Yes glib-2.0 is a hard dependency of fontforge, thanks for pointing that out.\nFontforge depends on only glib 2.6, however `g_mkdtemp` is not introduced until glib 2.30...\n\nBased on this one https://github.com/witwall/mktemp/blob/master/mkdtemp.c\nand also https://code.google.com/p/bsd-xdr/source/browse/trunk/src/mkdtemp.c?r=9\nI'd propose you improve your last implementation:\n- Replace `mktemp` with your own implementation, there are several documentations against `mktemp`, mostly because old poor implementations\n- Add a few more tries, e.g. 100, in case of collision.\n. Another side effect of introducing new libraries is that some users who are using old versions will be confused, when a newer version won't compile. So I'll try to prevent this as much as possible.\n. I remembered that someone had the same issue, and the reason was the getopt library.\nPlease check the version, and maybe you can check previous issues for clues.\n. Please see if #173  is your case.\n. No. In that case the size of the HTML file will be too large.\n. Can you give an example? I'm not quite sure about your case.\n. Still I'm not getting it, I don't see any advantage of inline CSS right now.\n\nMaybe you can try to separte PDF first, then convert each page into a separte HTML?\n. I've actually not planned any UI features, or maybe most UI features. There are people told me that they are trying to build UI, but I have not heard anything new from them.\n\nAs I mentioned in the blog, I'm planning for a 'standalone' mode where we can add any UI features without thinking about many different embedding cases. I'll also merge all UI pull requests created by you and others.\n\nI guess this is a bonus but not essential feature, I'll be glad to merge if you implement it.\n. @mickgiles I'm not sure about the definition of two-page view here.\nWhile @micred first mentioned it, I thought it's like the (vertical) two page view as in Adobe Reader.\n\nBut are you talking about the mode for some magazines, like in issuu.com? Please specify your requirements. And maybe it's better to open a new issue for that.\n. Looks like the encoding is not handled correctly.\nLet me try on my Linux tomorrow.\n. pdf2htmlEX crashes on this file, and I'm not quite sure about it.\nI'll work on it later.\n. I have fixed the crash. And I did not see any problem in the result. I suspect it's something wrong in the windows packaging. If possible, please try to compile pdf2htmlEX with cygwin and see if the problem still exists. Otherwise I'll suggest you to contact the packager as listed in https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Download\n. I'm not sure what's your use case. Intermediate files still have to be created and processed anyway, for example font conversion and image processing. And what shall we do with this parameter when there are multiple files?\n. @dhsto I don't think this will boost the performance in a large factor\n- Since intermediate files must be generated, removing the time for the final file could save at most 1/2 time, which is however not likely because:\n- The bottleneck is usually font & image processing, e.g. if you use `--process-nontext 0`, you'll see a large performance gain\n\nI suggest you try to do a profiling shows that this feature will help before you actually implement it\n. Please provide the pdf file\n. @chriskuhar  I don't think you can attach file in mail reply, please post the first few lines of the backtrace, and also the output of `pdf2htmlEX -v`.\n\nPlease also try the lastest git version, in case the bug has been fixed. \n. It's kind of strange to me, I have never seen gconv linked, especially MACINTOSH.so, maybe it's a hidden dependency of fontforge.\n\nI see that the version of fontforge is too old, maybe you should update it.\n. Please reopen if the problem still exists.\n. Where did you install cairo?\nPlease post `CMakeCache.txt` if possible.\n. Seems that cairo is not found? Please attache the full output of `cmake`\n. Please reopen if the problem still exists.\n. Oh, I'll try to fix build for poppler 0.24 then\n. I cannot reproduced it, it works well with poppler 0.24.\nPlease reopen if you see the error again.\n. Generally transformations are not generated due to the multiplier, most of them are indeed transformations defined in PDF. \n\nJust to make sure, can you provide a sample PDF file?\n. `--font-size-multiplier=1` disables all transformations generated by pdf2htmlEX, but transformations in PDF are still there.\nPlease provide a sample PDF file and reopen this issue.\n. I think this is a duplicate of #162 \n. Seems that there is something wrong with your `cmake`, please check your installation.\n. I'm not sure about this error, never seen it before.\nAs I doubted it's about your cmake installation, maybe you can try if it works for other projects. If not, I think there's not much things I can do. Maybe you'd better search for the error message and seek for help in cmake forums.\n. Just fixed, please try the latest git version\n. Please provide the pdf file.\n. I cannot reproduce it. Please specify the version of pdf2htmlEX, your browser and OS.\n. Please reopen if the problem still exists.\n. Yes confirmed, I'll try to find the cause.\n. Just fixed, Thanks!\nPlease suggest a name and email such that I can add you in `AUTHORS`. Or you can create a pull request for that.\n. Currently all supported formats are directly generated via poppler. I don't think it is worthy to support some formats separately in this project.\n\nAs there are already great conversion tools for images, maybe the better way is to inject converter during the process of pdf2htmlEX, see #174 \n. Try to remove `CMakeCache.txt` and then rebuild the project. \n. How did you install poppler? If you installed via git, you should update it.\n. can you post the `CMakeCache.txt` file?\n. I downloaded poppler 0.22.2, and the `SplashOutputDev.h` file is not the same as shown in your message.\nI'm not sure what's wrong with it but I suggest you to re-download and install poppler\n. Great!\n\nOn Thu, Sep 26, 2013 at 8:03 PM, Toni Sanju\u00e1n notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> Finally I update poppler via git and all work correctly..\n> \n> Thanks\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/issues/210#issuecomment-25162075\n> .\n. Did you check the wiki for troubleshooting, seems that you did not install header files of poppler\n. Did you check the wiki? Might be helpful.\n. Please reopen if the problem still exists.\n. Already fixed.\n. what's the version of your poppler?\n. Please attach the log of cmake, also CMakeCache.txt if possible\n. Yes, as I suspected, you did not specify correct INCLUDE dir, such that the poppler installed in `/usr/lib` was used.\n. Or, it's because you did not specify correct path for pkgconfig, you should not use `cat /usr/local/lib/`... instead you should use `pkg-config --libs poppler`\n. So as I said, the one installed in `/usr` was used, but you need to set correct pkgconfig path to locate the one installed in `/usr/local`\n. @tienle Is it working now?\n. @Chrismarsh Thanks. Probably I should add it to FAQ since lots of Fedora users complaint about that.\n. Please read the messages again carefully, you do not have (a new enough version of) poppler installed.\n. Did you try `--heps`, I wonder if that would help.\n. @yu-liang-kono Cannot confirm with Firefox/MacOS. Which browser and OS are you using?\n. The typo has been fixed, please test if there is still any error.\nI'll test on IE10 later.\n. I'm not sure about this message, even after reading http://www.marinbezhanov.com/web-development/16/how-to-embed-webfonts-properly-and-how-to-solve-the-ambiguous-css3111-font-face-encountered-unknown-error/\n. Not sure if `font/opentype` would work. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2871655/proper-mime-type-for-fonts\nBut seems that there's no official name, just hope that there's one working for all browsers.\n.

Please reopen the issue if necessary.\n. oops, that's a typo. I'll fix it soon.\n. Please test again.\n. In very early version of pdf2htmlEX, some metadata (e.g. title, author) are retrieved, I wanted to extract title and put it as the title of HTML. However I found that that piece of info of lots of PDF generated from LaTeX were inaccurate, due to the intermediate conversions (tex -> dvi -> ps -> pdf). So I dropped those code.\n\nIt's not hard to extract those information, but I'm not sure what's the proper way of storing them into HTML. I'm almost sure that I should use `<meta>` tag, but not sure about the property names.\n. @mrshu It's something like this: https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/blob/paperclub/src/PaperClub.h#L146 but maybe you need to read poppler code and PDF spec for complete keys.\n. From what I got from the Internet, css is case insensitive but class names are, because they are attributes defined in HTML -- just as you have mentioned. I did see a few articles suggesting not to use case insensitive matching class names.\n\nI wonder if you can write an example of 'injecting css via javascript', I'm not sure about how it works.\n. It seems to be a bug about javascript of chrome: http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=74750\n\nI'll change the class name anyway.\n. Fixed. Thanks!\n. I don't think it's a memory leak. I notice that there are more than 73000 fonts defined in the PDF, according to `pdffonts`, although most of them are not embedded. So I suggest you use the `--embed-external-font 0` option.\n. Hi, the warning message is about malformed encoding inside PDF.\nThere are two sets of encodings in PDF, one for rendering and the other for Unicode, and pdf2thmlEX tries to merge them for HTML, but it is not always possible to do so. \n\nWhen `-tounicode` is not specified, pdf2htmlEX would try to ensure the visual correctness by reencoding some glyphs (but they will become garbage text when copied out). However if `--tounicode 1` is specified, the mapping defined in PDF will always be used even if some glyphs will become missing.\n\nTheoretically this issue can be solved by creating extra fonts for the conflicted encoding, which is not worth the time at this moment. But I'll create an issue for that later anyway.\n. Great!\n. Cannot reproduce it.\nPlease specify the output of `pdf2htmlEX -v` and your environment.\n. I'm also using ubuntu gnome 13.10, and the only difference is that you are using an older version of fontforge than mine. So I guess that's the problems.\n\nPlease rerun pdf2htmlEX with `--debug 1`, when it crashed,  find the fonts in the `/tmp/pdf2htmlEX-xxx` directory.\nFor each font there, open it with fontforge and click file -> generate fonts -> uncheck \"validate\" -> generate. If any of these failes, it should be some Fontforge bug.\n. No this one doesn't crash either.\n. Often I build from git. Since there have been always bugs and fixes...\n. According to a recent bug report, 20120731 of fontforge is faulty, I guess you can fix it by updating fontforge.\nPlease reopen if necessary.\n. Thanks!\n. `replace` is not possible, at least for now. I don't think it's event supported by PDF readers. I also doubt for `add bookmarks`\n\n`search in PDF bookmarks`  also sounds like a rare use case to me.\n\nI'm not sure if `innerText` or `:contains` is enough for these features: see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12445020/javascript-window-find-doesnt-work-absolutely\n\nBut indeed there is a problem when lazy loading is enabled: pages are not loaded until viewed, so we need to load them before searching for any text.\n. https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Unfeatures#ui\n\nUI is never a focus of pdf2htmlEX, publisher are meant to provide their UI with `pdf2htmlEX.js` as a reference. \n\nI'm closing this one as a duplicate of #219 \n. Is it duplicate of #166 or #148 ?\n. duplicate of #30 \n. How about using `border-image`, e.g. https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/web/viewer.css#L1243\n. IE 11 supports it http://caniuse.com/border-image\n. How about this ugly hack?\nhttp://css-tricks.com/how-to-create-an-ie-only-stylesheet/\n. No.\nPlease post questions to the mailing list instead of here.\n. Seems that there are special unicode characters. I'll try to find more info.\n. As shown in http://jsfiddle.net/coolwanglu/puaDa/\nIndeed the behavior of chrome is different from others.\n\nI don't have a good solution so far, but seems that `--space-as-offset` is a workaround\n. Oh I didn't mention it.\nWhite-space is supposed to be append after  each white space, but seems that it's applied only one in Chrome for multiple white space character in the beginning.\n. https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge/issues/926\n. Since `ttf->woff` first, now a `ttf` font is always generated before converted to the final format.\n. Please specify the output of `pdf2htmlEX -v` and a sample file.\n. The image looks fine on Win 8.1. And I cannot test on Android since I don't have any Android devices.\n\nSince you mentioned that the images work on most browsers, it's likely to be something wrong of those two browsers, or a bug of poppler.\n\nYou can test `pdftohtml -c -s` from poppler, see if the same thing happens, if so, you may want to report the bug to poppler.\n. @hussainb I don't think it's about cmyk, pdf2htmlEX always uses RGB.\n@godwin668 please test the output of `pdftohtml -c -s`\n. @godwin668 Indeed imagemagick also complains about the png image. I'll try to find out the reason.\n. @godwin668 Previously I tested with the image you provided, but I cannot reproduce it with my build. So the problem must be in the windows version. You may want to report to the maintainer, or try to build pdf2htmlEX from source.\n. what's the browser you are using?\n. Should have been fixed. Please check.\n. `--single-html` has been deprecated, please use `--embed***` now, check the manpage.\n\nIndeed this option is still mentioned in the examples of the manpage, I'll clean it.\n. Please also post the cmake log and the version of g++.\n\nIt seems that the dynamic libraries cannot be correctly linked with, but I'm still not sure about the reason right now.\n. Just a wild guess, please run `ldconfig` and try to rebuild.\n. Do you have other installations of poppler? I guess that some other poppler lib is linked with. What's the output of `locate libpoppler.` ?\nFor the second part, you need to install the python-dev package including header files, libraries and pkg-config files, and then re-cmake pdf2htmlEX. Also you can disable python when configuring fontforge.\n. I reviewed again the information you have provided, but still having no clue. \nFrom my understanding so far, it appears to be more likely misconfiguration in your system than a bug of pdf2htmlEX.  I think you can close this issue if you don't need it. Or maybe we can still work on it until it's get resolved &mdash; it's up to you.\n\nSince you can build and install poppler, I assume that you can also run utilities from poppler (e.g. pdffonts), can you please provide the output of `ldd `which pdffonts`` and `file /usr/lib/libpoppler.so`?\n\nMaybe you can try to build another software that is linked with poppler.\n. As I didn't find a simple solution these days, I'll just close it until someone really needs want to solve it.\n. Do you mean #56?\nAnd please post questions to the mailing list.\n. I cannot reproduce it on Ubuntu 13.10.\nPlease provide the output of `pdf2htmlEX -v`, and maybe a stack trackback if possible.\n. Hmm. I wonder if you have trimmed the first line of the output.\nThe depended libraries look fine though.\n\nTo create a backtrace:\n- install `gdb`\n- If you built pdf2htmlEX from source, re-cmake with `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` and then build and install it &mdash; this would get all the function names shown in the backtrace\n- run `gdb pdf2htmlEX`\n- type `r [options] foobar.pdf`, you should get the backtrace there\n- type `quit` to quit\n. Actually you may remove all the lines starting with 'warning:', they are of no use.\n\nI guess that the problem is about the fontforge you have installed, I wonder if you can install a newer version.\n. great\n. Currently I update the PPA when there's a stable release or some important commit I feel it better landed into PPA.\nI wonder if there is any one who would like to maintain a stable PPA.\n\nI'm not quite sure what do you mean by 'private PPA', I guess you should refer to official documentations.\n. How about this, I'll release only stable version in the PPA from now on.\n. Did [this](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Building#troubleshooting) help?\n. Sorry I cannot test it myself for a few days.\n\nDid you try different values for `--to-unicode` ? And are there any output of pdf2htmlEX with this file?\n. What's the version you are using?  Please post the output of `pdf2htmlEX -v`\n\nEncoding should have been specified in the html file since an early version.\n\nPost also post the `manifest` file you are using (located in the `data-dir` in the output above)\n. Actually text are rendered into images, while hidden text layer is provided for selection.\n\nIn this way the hidden text layer may be not so accurate, and that's why lots of styles may be removed.\n. (1) and part of (2) should be done with `--optimize-text`, althought it's still faulty for some tricky PDF>\n\nI'd actually been planning to do 3 and 4, at the cost of some inaccuracy. Not finished yet. \n. @Toneti777 There are other concerns of item 2, `<span>` elements are usually added to adjust inner-word space, or due to the change of font or other styles. If you remove the span elements and merge the text, accuracy cannot be preserved. \n. @Toneti777 But if you managed to optimize the output a lot with item 1 and 2, it sounds like a bug of pdf2htmlEX &mdash; producing unnecessary span elements. In that case, can you please file a new bug with sample files?\n. Maybe you can try a larger value for `--heps` and `--optimize-text 1`\n. I think this is a duplicate of #56 so I close this one.\n. There is already a `fit_width` function of `pdf2htmlEX.Viewer`, you may call that function in `init_after_***()` &mdash; which is called after DOM is loaded.\n. Can you provide a sample PDF? Thanks!\n. Please provide a sample file, as well as for #253\n. Seems that there's nothing I can do about it:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/10684392/can-i-force-text-to-print-as-white\n\nThe fix for Chrome is already includes, and that's why it works on Chrome.\n\nHopefully there will be an option for Firefox in the future.\n. I cannot reproduce it (Chromium 31 + Ubuntu 13.10)\n\nDoes it happen on only this file or all files produced by pdf2htmlEX ?\n. I cannot reproduce it on Chrome 35 + Mac OS.\nIf you can still reproduce it, probably it's a bug of Chrome on Linux.\n. Sorry that I didn't have enough time for the review.\nI just left a few comments, please check them out.\n\nThanks for the patch!\n. btw, don't forget to add yourself in `AUTHORS`\n. I just noticed the `quiet` parameter, and I wonder how it could be useful.\nTo make it making sense, all the output in the future will have to be wrapper by a `if(!param.quiet)`, which is quite likely to be error prune.\nOn the other hand you can simply use a redirection to remove all the messages.\n. Usually I'd use cerr for messages, and cout for output. For example, potentially you can dump the output html in stdout without being worried about other messages.\n. I found a few more minor issues. Please take a look.\nAlso can you leave a message here if you have updated this PR, since otherwise I won't get any notification. \nThanks!\n. I found a few more issues after merging this PR, I wonder if you'd like to take a look.\nI don't have mingw so I cannot test them, but I hope there are less env detect directives as possible.\n. No I didn't mean it doesn't work, instead I meant we might be able to simplify the code utilizing mingw.\nAfter all we are using a POSIX environment instead of calling specific system APIs.\n\nFor example cygwin provide posix-compatible headers such that we do not need to test the cygwin macro all the time, and I wonder how we can do so similarly with mingw without as few `_WIN32` as possible.\n. Another problem, `_WIN32` may also affects cygwin, while you are only targeting at mingw. I think it's better to revert the commits and merge it again once you get all of them polished. \n. I found that mingw provides its own mkdir, stat etc, so it's better to use them instead of win32 api, to reduce the maintenance cost.\n\nI've cleaned all detection for WIN32, instead of reverting the commits since the new option is included.\n\nPlease file a new PR if necessary and sorry for the inconvenience, I should have been more careful before merging it.\n. @marcsanfacon I'll comment in the new PR. Thanks.\n. Hi, currently there's no plan for this feature.\nMaybe this is a duplicate of #196 ?\n. I'll check it out. Thanks!\n. I tried this one before, but didn't work for me on iPad 1. It caused tearing and tiling.\n. I tried translateZ on ipad1, not perfect but helps a lot, maybe ipad1 is too old (but (even lower budget) android devices seem to be fine) \n\nI'll add it.\nThanks!\n. Nope, seems that the effects are similar with or without translateZ.\nBut maybe I'll just add it, not sure if there will be any side effects.\n\nI wonder if you could test if adding translateZ only to pf or pc would help. I guess only one would be enough?\n. marked as duplicate of #30. Actually I've tried translateZ before.\nNot sure if it only works for ipad >1\n. I'm sorry that I cannot fix this myself, as I cannot find Safari around me. That's why I didn't list it as officially supported.\n\nI'll try to fix the issue on Chrome and see if it helps here.\n. I cannot reproduce it with Chrome 31 + Ubuntu 13.10\n. Yes, I can reproduce it on Windows\n. I saw old posts on stackoverflow, seems that chrome will wrap inline-block elements regardless of the value of white-space.\nThe inline-block property was added for some special cases, when there are negative margins.\nI don't have a good solution right now, unfortunately.\n. https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35443\n\nThis is the webkit bug for this issue. Some one mentioned a workaround in the comments. I'll try that later.\n. The workaround seems to work, I've pushed it. Please have a try.\n. @sporritt No I'm not sure. You may try the latest version of pdf2htmlEX.\n. Please follow the guidance in the wiki and reopen this issue with more info.\n. Actually it was added at some time, but it will increase the specificity, such that I'll have to add the prefix to all the generated CSS rules &mdash; these might increased the size by a few kb.\n\nI guess that the only problematic rule would be `span`, how about changing `span` to `.t span`, does it work?\n. @sathomas For now it's easier to specify different class names. You can just change them in [css_class_names.cmakelists.txt](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/blob/master/src/css_class_names.cmakelists.txt) and rebuild the project.\n\nThe top-level id/class (e.g. loading-indicator you've mentioned) are considered as demos, which can be changed in the `manifest` file, I also left a few interface in the `pdf2htmlEX` js object for specifying different names.\n\nBut indeed there are likely issues when putting two html files together, in which case even adding a prefix selector won't help &mdash we need two different prefixes. If the prefix is determined by the user, or from the name of the PDF file, the difficulty would be to convert existing rules in `base.css`\n. @sathomas Another option is to add a new macro in the `manifest` file, and to prepend it to all generated CSS classes, but the prefix has to be determined the in the compile time, which doesn't sound to be useful.\n\nI've not come up with any good time of processing the .css style though, \n\nBtw, did `.t span` work for you? \n. @sathomas  @nicolaasmatthijs  OK I just added it to base.css\n. @trnelson One possible reason is that you are using a development version, that's released before 0.11 is officially released. Did you get it from the `v0.11` tag?\n. @trnelson Oh, the PPA has not been update for a while #310 \n. @trnelson For now I'd recommend to compile from source, although it might not be a comfortable process. Also please leave more comments to #310 instead of here. Thanks.\n. @duanyao I think it'd be enough to prefix the css rules as @sathomas originally proposed.\nAt first I worried about the performance, but maybe it's fine now.\n. @duanyao How about a random prefix for each document? Not sure if this would be an overkill.\n. Please follow the guidance in the wiki and reopen this issue with more info.\n. @d0ptnow Although I saw your email, I could not see any message here now.\n\nI'm afraid that I cannot test it myself as I don't have an Android device\n. I cannot reproduce it. What's the browser & OS are you using?\n. I can reproduce it now. The unicode values stored in the PDF file are not valid. You can use `--tounicode -1` as a workaround.\n. \u76ee\u524d\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u63a5\u53e3\u53ea\u6709rescale\n\u5982\u679c\u4e0a\u9762\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u5bf9\u4e00\u822cpdf\u90fd\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f00\u4e00\u4e2aissue\n.

Please follow https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md and provide more information\n.

The pdf2htmlEX and depended libraries you are using are too old. Please try newer ones.\n. No, fontforge is still 20120731, which is too old.\n. Actually fontforge has been moved to github, and a version had been released a few weeks ago. \n\nBut I'd recommend staying with the git version.\n. @sathishks  Oh sorry I thought I had replied, but I didn't.\n\nYes, that's the new official website for fontforge, please find latest version there.\n. Indeed all function names have been optimized. But probably the best way is to define externs files for the closure compiler, or through annotations.\n. The JS code provided in pdf2htmlEX is mainly for reference purpose, also to provide a default UI, especially for lazy page loading.\nIt seems to me that most users prefer to use their own UI code, at least an overhaul of the JS code in pdf2htmlEX. So I think currently it's not quite useful to expose the API -- which is not actually not maintained and likely to be changed.\n\nOf course you are welcome to hack the code yourself. In case that many users find the JS code useful, I think there will be a set of API defined then.\n. The script used to generate the demo files is here: https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/blob/gh-pages/demo/gen.sh\n\nAnd indeed they were generated with an earlier version of pdf2htmlEX\n\nYou can file issues if the files are not working on Midori, just make sure to follow the instructions mentioned in wiki. And note that Midori is not official supported.\n. OK, I'll try to install midori and take a look.\nI really do not remember the revision for the demo, maybe you can deduct from the commit and date\n. Seems that the reason is midori does not support fancy.css well, although I have not pin-pointed the exact rule.\nYou can disable fancy.css and try again.\n. seems so\n\nhttp://caniuse.com/woff\n\nOn Fri, Dec 27, 2013 at 11:12 AM, d0ptnow notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> pdf2htmlEX --optimize-text 0 --external-hint-tool=ttfautohint\n> --font-format ttf --fit-width 1024 geneve_1564.pdf\n> \n> This config makes the fonts work on android stock browser.

Merged.\nThanks!\n. @dsablic Wondering if you could take a look at #350?\n. Fixed.\n. I wonder if I didn't make it clear in the previous comments, but you are targeting at mingw instead of win32. So let's use macros for mingw instead of windows. I remember that under some circumstance cygwin also defines `_WIN32`\n\nAbout mkdtemp, here are a few workaround I've found, maybe you can take a look\nhttps://github.com/lambourg/libgit2/commit/537de0889cb2c7b2f964f276e932f74594863371\nhttp://www.tomatosoft.biz/blog/2013/05/22/solution-to-missing-mkstemp-when-you-are-compiling-under-mingw/\n\nI don't want header files like `windows.h` to be included, it'll make the code harder to maintain, and it may also show that functions provided by mingw are not fully utilized.\n\nAnd I guess that a separate file for the new functions is not necessary.\n. I did not mean that windows.h should not be recursively included. I meant it's better not explicitly include it in pdf2htmlEX. It's the implementation detail of mingw to include it or not.\n\nMaybe it works for cygwin, but why? It already works fine with cygwin.\n. Looks much better now. Thank you very much!\n. Try to update your fontforge, which seems to be too old.\nIf that does not work, please provide the PDF file.\n\nSplit pages have to be read on a HTTP server, viewing local files won't work. You can set up a local HTTP server if you want.\n. No. that was 2 years ago. There is a new version released a few weeks ago, but usually I recommend to stay with git.\n. In theory the program should never crash, even for malformed input, in which case the program should show messages about it instead of crashing. So it is a bug if you see seg fault.\n\nOn the other hand, I cannot reproduce the crash. Please leave this issue open if you still see the crash with latest fontforge, otherwise you may close it.\n. Please post questions in the mailing list, read wiki for more detail.\n. Please provide more information as described in the wiki. Also please make a meaningful title.\n. closed due to #290\n. \u6211\u5728linux\u4e0b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6ca1\u6709\u53d1\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u5c1d\u8bd5\u7f16\u8bd1\u6e90\u7801\u3002\n. The warning is not harmful.\nBut I'm not sure about the message aboug gww_iconv_open\n\nIs this the same as #288?\n. Are there anything wrong in the output?\n. I guess it's harmless then. I found that it's reported inside Fontforge, but I'm not quite sure about the reason.\n. I cannot reproduce with your example PDF file. On which page does the issue occur?\n\nBTW, you might need to update your pdf2htmlEX, which is too old.\n. There is no such options for that right now, I guess it's not in the scope of pdf2htmlEX.\n\nOn the other hand, you may modify the source code or post-processing the images for your need.\n. pdf2htmlEX read information from PDF, which does not preserve such information generally. \n\nI'm not sure if tagged pdf in the newer version supports it though.\n. Please try if you can open that file using other utilities from poppler.\n. Do you see the  same error messages when you open the file with poppler tools?\n. I cannot reproduce it, please make sure to update pdf2htmlEX and poppler.\n. Fixed.\n. About issue 1, you may try `pdffonts` on your files. If the PDF file refer to external file (might be restricted MS font in your case), the actually rendering will depend on the renderer's environment. So this could be normal.\n\nI'm not sure about issue 2, maybe you can provide a sample file?\n. `tounicode` is not used for remove special characters, and it might not be possible to do so if relevant information are not stored in PDF.\n. No for now. You can call pdf2htmlEX with `-f` and `-l` using scripts though.\n. I can reproduce it, but it might be a bug in Fontforge. I'll spend more time on it.\n. Sorry for the long delay btw, I've been quite busy.\n. Hmm. Latest FontForge does not crash.\nWait for #358.\n. Can you build pdf2htmlEX with standard building instructions?\n. @spl Thanks!\n. The output of pdf2htmlEX should be completely valid HTML, so not sure what you mean by compatibility.\n\nIndeed the output might be too complicated for most HTML parser/processors, while I'm trying to simplify the structure for the sake of rendering performance, but currently it's not a main concern to adjust for other HTML processors.\n. Hmm.. in that case, it would be difficult to support it, as there could be too many ways of defining those tags. \n. Please specify the following information:\n- The version of poppler you have insalled\n- If you can find `poppler-config.h` in the location where you installed poppler\n- Full cmake log\n. The weird thing is that there's nothing about poppler mentioned in cmake log, which should not happen. I doubt if that's full cmake log.\n. If you have compile the code before, try to remove cmake cache before executing cmake.\n. Probably you need also to setup other env variables, please refer to the wiki article about building.\n. @backwater can you please create a new issue for that?\n. Seems that fontforge no longer uses its custom version of `calloc`.\nI've just fixed it, please try the latest commit.\nThanks for reporting.\n. I cannot find the post in the mailing list (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pdf2htmlex), could you find you post and post a link here?\n. Sorry for the long delay, I've been quite busy.\nI can reproduce this issue, but the cause is still mysterious to me. I'll need to spend more time on it.\n. I'll try to add a new option for rendering annotation.\n. A new option has been added: `--process-annotation`. Please try.\n. fontforge recently changed their build system, probably you should run ./bootstrap first.\nIf that's not working, perhaps you can find help in the fontforge project site.\n. `core` means pdf2htmlEX crashed.\nThe version of fontforge you are using is too old, please update it.\n. I cannot reproduce it, please reopen if it still crashes with latest depended libraries.\n. fontforge should not longer call gcalloc, I suspect that you have an old version of fontforge installed, and the newly installed version is not correctly configured.\n. Actually I saw another one reporting a similar issue. What's the output of `locate glib.h`?\n. Please try my fork if it still doesn't work, as described in https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Building\nAlso please reopen the issue if necessary. \n. I'm not quite sure about these error messages. Please report to the fontforge community.\n. Sorry I've been very busy recently. I'll update the PPA as soon as I can.\n. I found it difficult to pack a recent version of Fontforge. I wonder if any one could help.\nFor now, please refer to https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/blob/master/.travis.yml as a rough instruction to build on Ubuntu.\n. @djvs  at which step will it fail without libltdl ? It could be the problem that I could not build the Fontforge package. Thanks!\n. @uttamk If you go through the issues of pdf2htmlEX, most crashes are caused by outdated Fontforge. It has been nearly 2 years now, and many bugs have been fixed.\n. Another failed try today. [log](https://launchpadlibrarian.net/177118116/buildlog_ubuntu-saucy-i386.fontforge_20140101~pdf2htmlEX-0ubuntu1~saucy1_FAILEDTOBUILD.txt.gz)\nProbably I won't spend more time on this recently. \n. @pengux It could be good idea, but I'm not familiar with it myself. I'd like to include it in the wiki if anyone is interested.\n. Thanks @klokoy , if you can help maintain the image, can you add it to the wiki page \"download\" ? \n. Fixed, finally\n. @Siddhant I'll upgrade my ubuntu and test it before uploading the package.\n. @Siddhant Just found that Utopic is not supported by Fontforge PPA, so we might need to wait for a while.\n. @Siddhant Thanks!\n. Yeah, it's been an old issue (https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/issues/64), I have a solution in mind, but just have not enough time to implement it.\n. 0.11 does not work with latest poppler. Please try the latest git version.\n. Hi, I still don't got time to try on latest fontforge. I'll come back as soon as I have it tested.\nBtw, could you quote the error message? It's rather hard to read right now.\n. What's the output of `locate glib.h`?\n. Btw, I tested with latest fontforge, it works.\n. So you need to install glib header files, not sure how you got fontforge compiled without it.\n. You need to install the headers files. Please check the dependencies of\nfontforge\n\nOn Mon, Mar 10, 2014 at 7:02 PM, sathishks notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> I have installed glib-2.0 package .locate glib i got glib path.but locate\n> glib.h returns empty value.\n> \n> ## \n> \n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/issues/312#issuecomment-37171304\n> .\n. 140313 is fine, the warning message is harmless, it's because fontforge has change the version format. I'll fix it later.\n. It seems that the font embedded in the PDF is rejected by Fontforge, mostly likely the font is malformed but I'm not quite sure so far.\n. For the fontforge issue, not sure if you can find any clue in config.log. But anyway 20120731 is too old, you might want to try the latest version\n\nFor poppler, you can find the version define in poppler-config.h, located in where you have installed it.  poppler is a library, or a set of tools, there's no single program named poppler, instead most tools are called `pdf***`, for example `pdftocairo`, `pdffonts` etc.\n\nI'm not sure how to test the libraries other than running `fontforge` or `pdffonts`.\n. PPA is for ubuntu only, although you might be able to install them with hacking.\n. Please reopen if necessary.\n. Oops, that's a typo in the css. `base.min.css` should be the same for all files. Just fixed.\n. Did you try different values for `--tounicode` ?\n. Just try both 0 and 1 for the `--tounicode` parameter.\n. Oh, it should be 1 and -1\n. Yes, there are issues building with latest fontforge. I'm trying to fix them.\n. While trying to fix this issue, I found even more issues regarding compiling...\n\nPlease try my fork (as described in https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Building) and see if it works. \n. What concerns me is that the user might be actually using the latest fontforge for other reasons.\n. \u53ea\u6709\u9875\u9762\u548c\u4e3bhtml\u5206\u79bb\u65f6\u624d\u4f1a\u51fa\u90a3\u4e2a\u52a8\u753b\u3002\u53e6\u5916\u90a3\u4e2a\u52a8\u753b\u4e0d\u662fgif\u3002\n. \u5927\u6982\u662f`pdf2htmlEX --split-pages 1`\uff0c\u53c2\u8003\u4e00\u4e0bwiki\u3002\u53e6\u5916\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u52a0\u8f7d\u592a\u5feb\u4e86\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c1d\u8bd5\u8c03\u6574\u670d\u52a1\u5668\uff0c\u8ba9\u9875\u9762\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e45\u4e00\u4e9b\n. Looks like something wrong in a recent commit in Fontforge.\n. You may try to downgrade your fontforge, and bisect to find the exact commit that causes the issue.\n. I tried to reproduce the issue, but found out that the file link is dead. Can you update it?\n. @sathishks \nHmm.. I can no longer access the files? Could you upload it again if you want further tests? Or you can just close this issue.\nMeanwhile you can check https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Troubleshooting-Crashes , which might help to isolate the font files and find the real cause.\nI just checked your issue (i.e. 1296) on FontForge, which is not really helpful. You need to provide the font file for them to debug, and pdf2htmlEX is not relevant there.\n. I've got no experience on homebrew, but it seems to be something wrong with the dependencies in homebrew, e.g. poppler requires png15 but freetype requries png16.\n\nProbably you can try to downupgrade some packages.\n. Please try to build from source, if you cannot reproduce the issue from that, it might be better to report the issue to homebrew.\n. As I remember, in PDF fonts do not have an attribute as 'normal' or 'bold', variants are just considered as different fonts. But the flag may still exists in the font file, which will be then interpreted by browsers.\n\nBesides that flag, it's also possible to declare the weight in `@font-face`, I'm not sure how browsers decide the weight when one or both exist. E.g. in your case, 'bold' is declare in the font file but not in `@font-face`\n\nActually pdf2htmlEX guesses the style (see https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/blob/master/src/HTMLRenderer/font.cc#L1071) and tries to declare them in CSS. But basically it's based on font names.\n\nI think it's better to follow the standard, but I think webkit should be good on this. Does it only happen on QtWebkit, or also for other browers/engines? \n. Can you provide a sample PDF file for testing?\n. There seems to be too many aspects of post-processing the images, and a single parameter cannot fulfill everyone's needs. \n\nI might go for #174 , such that users may inject whatever they want in that phase. But unfortunately I got little time myself to implement it for now.\n. Merged to #174 \n. Please provide the sample file and relevant info as described in the wiki.\n. I cannot reproduce this. Please make sure that you have `poppler-data` installed.\nAlso the converted HTML is only 996kb in my case.\n. The message is saying that you don't have fontforge installed, or the version installed is too old.\nDue to the complexity of different distributions, and my limited time, it's not quite possible for me to maintain building instructions/commands. I've wrote general instructions on https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Building\n\nOn the other hand you are required to get familiar with the system prior to using this tool, if you are not, better places to ask for help would be forums or websites like stackoverflow.\n. The version of your fontforge is too old.\n. what's the version of your fontforge\n. That would be too old. \nI've just update the [building instructions](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Building). Please update your fontforge.\n. Did you check the env variabled mentioned in the building instructions?\n. Could you post the output of `pdffonts <you pdf file name>`?\n. Oh seems that you are using Windows, in case that you don't have pdffonts, please provide the PDF file instead.\n. No I did not see it.\n. Please upload it to some online storage service and post a link back here.\n. It turns out that all fonts in the PDF file are external.\nI've created a wiki page explaining the details:\nhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Font-Files#embed-or-not\n. It doesn't seems to be a general feature so I don't think it will be included in pdf2htmlEX.\n\nBut you can do it with some javascript code, to change the font style in CSS, as long as you can locate the section. Not sure if it'll 100% work for werid fonts though.\n. @Gsakthivel  Could to wrap the message with backquotes properly, such that they can be viewed nicely on GitHub. On the other hand, since it's all about fontforge, I'd suggest you report it to fontforge developers. I'm not quite sure what's going on here. \n. I double if you are using my fork, there should not be any reference to `xalloc.h`. What's the commit you are using?\n. There's no special parameter necessary.\n\nCan you compare the `fontforge.h` installed and the one in the repo? I don't see a reference to `xalloc.h`.\n. Probably you didn't switch to the `pdf2htmlEX` branch\n. Have you tried to clear the cmake cache and rerun cmake?\n. just go ahead find the package containing libtiff and install it.\n\nOn Fri, Apr 11, 2014 at 1:03 AM, Chad Brown notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> Removed CMakeCache.txt and re-ran cmake .. and presto no errors!\n> \n> However it seems like libtiff.so is no missing! ahh!\n> \n> Here's the error when I run pdf2htmlEX from the command\n> \n> pdf2htmlEX: error while loading shared libraries: libtiff.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n> \n> ## \n> \n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/issues/331#issuecomment-40110845\n> .\n. I guess that libtiff5 is required by the latest poppler.\nThanks for you input.\n. #310 \n. @seebrown  I wonder how you managed to have the latest fontforge work. I'm having trouble with that.\n. @seebrown the zip file you mentioned is not the pdf2htmlEX branch, but I guess you are using that branch since you can build pdf2htmlEX along with it.\n\nAnd also @lystor , please allow some time before I can reach my build environment, that machine's broken right now.\n. I can reproduce the crash, and it's likely to be something wrong in FontForge.\nCan you go through https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Troubleshooting-Crashes ?\n. You don't need `test.py`, it's for testing.\nThe error message means you didn't install pdf2htmlEX.\nAnd there's no file called `pdfwhtmlex.py`\n. Confirmed.\nAt first I thought it's the image has been scaled, but it seems that the images still fit each page, but the content are scaled and displayed in the center.\nI'll try with the latest poppler code\n.

I suspect that the crash happened in fontforge, you may try to open those font files (mostly likely the last one) in the tmp dir and try to convert them with fontforge.\nI don't have access to my build environment so I'm afraid that I cannot verify it myself.\n. @djdiego88 So clearly it's a bug of fontforge, can you report it to the fontforge developers?\n. Please make sure to provide the relevant files while submitting a bug to FontForge.\nThis link might help:\nhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Troubleshooting-Crashes\n. Hmm. Latest FontForge does not crash.\nWait for #358.\n. I think the error message is pretty clear: just go head and install the dependencies.\n. I'd suggest you try to build the official fontforge (although it cannot be linked with pdf2htmlEX) and see if it works. If it doesn't, it'd better to report to the fontforge developers.\n. Not quite sure, but it looks like a bad installation of glib, or misconfiguration of the env variables.\n. Hi @ritchiea  which version of fontforge are you using?\nAnd what's the path of your 'glibconfig.h'.\n. Maybe it's about the path delimiter. Try using `/`\n. OK :)\n. Hmm.. any other error messages you might find helpful? I cannot tell from only `Error 1` and `Error 2` here.\n. @shalecraig check your message, you don't have fontforge installed that is new enough\n. That's an older version, which is not compatible with latest poppler.\n. I've just tried compiling pdf2htmlEX with the git version of poppler (on Linux), and there was no problem.\nPlease make sure to update pdf2htmlEX to latest version and try again. And feel free to reopen the issue when you have more information.\n. Actually I don't know how to specify `libpoppler??` with `>=`\n. > And it the library is automatically imported in the dependencies in the binary package with the version it has be build with (required anyway): \n\nCan you please tell me how it works? No idea how they are 'automatically imported'\n\nThere seems to be a problems though, as you mentioned the automatically imported dependency is `poppler >= 0.24.5`, which is too high.\n. Closed due to #346 \n. try a larger value for heps\n. `--heps` is already a fault tolerance for spaces. There reason that you see so many tags is because they are spaces of different widths, say 1cm, 2cm or 3cm etc. If a standard space is 2cm, and `--heps` is small, then only 2cm spaces will be replaced with a space character; when `--heps` is at least `1cm`, all spaces between 1cm and 3cm will be replaced with a space character.\n\nI don't have a better solution yet, can you propose one?\n. You mean to use multiple characters for a single space?\n. It was designed so to maintain correct text, whenever you select some text and copy them out, they will remain the same as in the PDF. Multiple characters will break it.\n\nAlso I'm not sure if this will actually help that much, suppose that each space char s 1cm, then 2-space-char  will only help for 2cm spaces. How about 1.5cm space then?\n\nCan you also provide a sample PDF file?\n. letter-spacing has been considered already, which doesn't help a lot.\n\n> Usually people don't type one and a half spaces.\n\nThis is not true,  for example LaTeX often take care of [each single space](http://coolwanglu.github.io/pdf2htmlEX/demo/demo.html) to make it perfect.\n. So, can you provide some sample PDF files for analysis?\n\nOn Fri, Jun 6, 2014 at 5:08 PM, djvs notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Sure, but in other contexts besides LaTeX, spacing is usually uniform for\n> a\n> text field, relative to character width.

This file seems to be produced by LaTeX. Try `pdfinfo` on it.\n. I see. There were people doing the same thing AFAIK.\nThe output of pdf2htmlEX was not designed to be easily edited, and I don't have a good solution for that without breaking the format. \n\nThere are on going work trying to minimize the number of elements while minimizing the change in format, but I don't have enough time to finish it.\n. No I'm afraid, it was a prototype and not finished.\n. Seems that there was a bug about `heps`, which has been fixed in #375, please test the latest `incoming` branch and see if that helps.\n\n@peterpisljar are you using font hinting tools?\n. @peterpisljar If you were testing on Chrome on Windows, it has poor font rendering. Otherwise could you file a separate issue?\n\nGenerally the `<span>` tags are actually reflecting the information in PDF, and I don't have a good solution to remove them without hurting the format. \n\nSee also #418, hopefully there will be a PDF optimizer that 'tags' PDF file with recognized text lines and paragraphs.\n. I'm not familiar with owncloud, so please be specific about the features.\nBtw, please post questions to the mailing list instead of here. Issue tracker is used to track bugs of the source code.\n.

Thanks!\n\nI wonder if we can also remove png jpeg and fontforge in this way. \n\nCannot test it myself right now, sorry.\n. I realized that it might make sense, as png and jpeg are actually depended by libpoppler, and they are not directly depended by pdf2htmlEX.\n\nCould you please also remove them and I'll merge then.\nThanks!\n.

But latest PDF standard might support some), so it's not an easy job.\n\nGenerally please post to the mailing list for discussion.\n. I remembered that I've left a note at the [wiki page](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Download)\nSee #310 \n. Thanks for reporting!\n\nHopefully the author of that PR would show up and test it again, as poppler might have been changed during this period.\n\nIt'd be OK to add a new option, but I'd be better to figure out the actual meaning/effects, or it will be only a blind switch.\n\nBTW, the `Cairo***` files in the pdf2htmlEX repo might not match the latest version of poppler, wondering if you have tried a matching set of them?\n. Still need some time before I can access my build env. \nLater I will also update the CairoOutpuDev files.\n. OK I'll just revert it.\n. A quick googling suggested that it might be MacOS specific, but I've never seen this message before myself.\n. If the rendering remains the same, it's unlikely that the engine is wrong. You might want to inspect the elements and check if the bounding boxes (using the width value you specified) just match the text. If so, it should be correct.\n. The width you saw is not essentially the width of the box, because they are not in the same coordinate system.\n. It's the correct width, but may be in a different coordinate system. If you\nare familiar with PDF internals, you should know the transformations stuffs.\n\nYou need also check the transformation matrix while you want to check the\nwidth, for example the text might be zoomed or rotated.\n\nOn Wed, May 28, 2014 at 8:36 PM, Thomas Buick notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> The width i use is the:\n> HTMLTextLine->width\n> \n> Is there a more appropriate one ?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/issues/351#issuecomment-44400357\n> .\n.

In the `share` folder, you will see the original css files, you can just copy them to where you have installed pdf2htmlEX, and override the installed files.\n\nProbably it's better to add a switch for this later.\n. Oh, did you mean that pdf2htmlEX is generating minified and not minified css files on different machines?\n. It seems that you are using different versions of pdf2htmlEX, which might explain the difference.\n\nAnd by overriding installed files, I meant to change the filename accordingly; or you can change the manifest file.\n.

In my opinion this is a good feature, but the way you implemented might be too dirty.\nI don't like the idea of doing the fallback in `CairoBackgroundRenderer`, a cleaner way is to do that outside them: \n\n```\nauto img = cairo_renderer.render();\nif(too_large(img))\n    img = splash_render.render();\n```\n\nAnother thing is that counting the number of `<`'s might be too hacky, are there any other ways to do thing, for example you can stop processing once you see too many tags generated.\n. Better not touch `CairoOutputDev` files, these files are directly copied from poppler, which will be synced time to time. It's done like this because they are not exposed in poppler's API.\n\nI do believe that counting '<' should work, it's just not that elegant.\n\nAnother way is just exit with an error message when there are too many nodes, and let the user to re run the program.\n. Instead of using bitmap or something, the coordinator does not need to know\nthe details, it could be\n\n```\ncairo_dev.render();\nif(!cairo_dev.ok())\n   splash_dev.render();\n```\n\nHow about this?\n\nOn Sat, Jun 7, 2014 at 12:25 AM, Duan Yao notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> I see, I'll keep CairoOutputDev untouched.\n> \n> svg_nodes_limit is applied to individual pages, and only pages' with too\n> many svg nodes' fall back to bitmap bg, other pages are not affected, so\n> that the overall quality will not be degraded too much.\n> So exit-and-re-run is not an alternative.\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/pull/356#issuecomment-45403769.\n.

I've read through your patch, this is a cool feature. Thank you!\nLet's just discuss further to make it perfect.\n. What are DCT images btw?\n. Oh I cannot see any notification about new commits. Please just ping me after making changes.\nLet me read through the patch again.\n. This PR is still for `master`, please change it to `incoming`.\n. btw I see #356 is merged here, why?\nBut anyway both of them seem ready for merging, maybe #356 can be closed?\n. deprecated by #364\n. I heard of successful build on CentOS, so there must be a way of doing that. But I'm not sure.\nYou might want to take a look at relevant wiki pages, about troubleshooting build errors, and the status of PPA.\n. I just fixed it on the incoming branch, please have a try.\nCan I use this PDF file for a test case, which will be included here: https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX-tests\n. @yu-liang-kono OK, I'll try to make one myself then.\n. I think the PR is ready now.\nAgain, I think the features are quite useful.\nThank you very much for your efforts!\n. :)\n. Thanks for the patch! This is one of the most wanted features.\n\nSorry I do not got enough time to read through the patch right now, will do that later.\nHere are some thoughts.\n- I see implementation in DrawTracer replies on cairo, but I really hope it will be universal.\n- I remember that `SplashOutputDev` has an api to check the bounding box of area changed, we might take advantage of that.\n- Didn't check how you are handling text that are partially covered.\n- CSS drawing can be removed that, it was just an early experiment.\n- Indeed we might need to store the elements, analyze the visibility and draw that again. Not sure how to do that.\n\nHere are some other ways of doing this\n\n:one:We can mix rendering of text and images, and let the browser handle it. For example\n\n``` html\n<div> text1 </div>\n<img> image 1</img>\n<div> text2 </div>\n<img> image 2</img>\n```\n\nBut this might need quite some efforts.\n\n:two:We can just generate a whole bg image with all the text, and put a transparent text layer on top of it. It's actually just the `fallback` mode. This is definitely stupid for raster images, but not sure about svg.\n. I mean that patch would make `cairo` a hard dependency, which is optional now.\nThis might be a good time to investigate crocodoc again, I'll do that.\n. @duanyao Let me see later if we can use functions inside poppler.\n. I think this feature makes more sense for the bitmap backend, i.e. `splash`, because the background image might not be easily broke up.\n\nAt some point we might move forward to the svg backend, and in this case, I think it might makes more sense to break the background image into parts and actually make them overlap with each other in HTML, as mentioned above. \n\nAnother way of tackling this is to render a hidden text layer and a full svg -- but we export the fonts in the current way and use them inside SVG -- which might sound clearer.\n. How about a chat some time, I'm not sure how I can help. Especially I really want to convince the poppler people to expose more about the CairoOutputDev interfaces.\n. @duanyao Shall we try #pdf2htmlEX at freenode? Not sure if you are available now.\n. I'll try to keep online in the next few hours :)\n. `correct` might look like an adjective instead of verb here, hmm...\nI don't like `check` now even if I proposed it.\n\nHow about `--text-visibility-accuracy`? I cannot come up with better ones... If you don't like it, please just use `--correct` or `--check`. Hopefully in the near future we don't even need an option for this.\n. Just FYI, I've just opened a new repo for test cases: https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX-tests\n\nWondering if you would like to submit one or more for this feature?\n. Thank you very much! I'll do some further code cleaning, e.g. removing css drawing.\n. @maxsdw It's been landed in git, so you can try the latest master branch.\n. @cdeblois Yes it's included. Please find a new issue for the compilation error.\n. #95 is more than 1 year ago, might be deprecated.\nAs the messages say, you don't have (a recent version of) fontforge installed, and your compiler does not support C++0x\n. You need to install/upgrade fontforge/compiler\n. @alexpoon2000  Probably you can find better answers from fontforge developers and/or stackoverflow. \n. @taodaola \u4e66\u7b7e\u662f\u4f9d\u8d56pdf\u5185\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5982\u679c\u9700\u8981\u4e66\u7b7e\u7684\u8bdd\u5e94\u8be5\u5728\u751f\u6210pdf\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u52a0\u5165\u3002\npdf2htmlEX\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\uff0c\u81f3\u4e8e\u4f60\u8bf4\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6548\u679c\u5e76\u4e0d\u662fpdf\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u4e0d\u5c5e\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u8303\u7574\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u81ea\u884c\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\n. \u5206\u9875\u4e0d\u662fhtml\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u5355\u72ec\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8bf7\u53c2\u89c1\uff08\u4e2d\u6587\uff09\u90ae\u4ef6\u5217\u8868\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u3002\u56de\u5934\u6211\u52a0\u5230wiki\u91cc\u3002\n\u4e66\u7b7e\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2aissue\u91cc\u56de\u7b54\u8fc7\u4e86\u3002\n. \u786e\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u7684\u7248\u672c\u751f\u6210\u591a\u9875html\u540e\u9700\u8981\u67b6\u4e00\u4e2ahttp\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u3002\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5728\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u5df2\u7ecf\u4fee\u590d\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u8fd8\u662f\u8ddf\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u8bbe\u7f6e\u6709\u5173\u3002\n\n\u4f60\u7684pdf\u6211\u8bd5\u4e86\uff0c\u6ca1\u53d1\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u4f60\u81ea\u5df1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6e90\u7801\u3002\n. \u6211\u8fd9\u91cc\u4e0d\u80fd\u91cd\u73b0\u3002\n\u4f60\u81ea\u5df1\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u52a0`--embed o`\u5462\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5c31\u662f\u53bb\u6389\u76ee\u5f55\n. Hey, this is definitely a cool feature. I used to manually tweak `drawChar` back and forth, which is terrible.\n\nI wonder if `proof_state` is actually necessary, and I think it it might be better to use `GfxState` only, such that both backends can share a same set of functions consistently.\n\nOn the other hand, probably it's better to sync with `CairoOutputDev` from latest poppler code, I'll do that.\n. Is the old save/restore method not working well, or you think it's too costly that way?\n. @duanyao OK, I think your current method is good. Just out of my curiosity.\n. I think so, I did `proof 1` myself before, but that was because `1` is much\neasier to implement.\n\nOn Thu, Jun 26, 2014 at 7:46 PM, Duan Yao notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> @coolwanglu https://github.com/coolwanglu Do you think --proof 1\n> (rendering text in bg in original colors) is useful?

Looks good now.\nThanks!\n. Placing your question everywhere is not helpful. Let's discuss on the mailing list.\n. I wonder if you are using the `pdf2htmlEX` branch in the fork of fontforge.\n. `library_version_configuration` was part of fontforge when I forked its repo, but then it got removed.\nI'm afraid that I don't have a mingw available, maybe you can try the `incoming` branch of pdf2htmlEX plus the `master` branch of official fontforge.\n\nI'll test if I can make latest fontforge working on my Linux machine.\n. This is about poppler, please review the instructions in wiki about building from source.\nProbably your poppler is not recent enough, its API has kept changing.\n. Oh no sorry, indeed you need the lastest git code of pdf2htmlEX, the error you saw has been fixed, and pdf2htmlEX should support multiple versions of poppler.\n. What's the version of poppler you are using?\n. @jatmew  See https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/blob/master/src/util/unicode.cc#L122\nSince `mapNameToUnicodeText` is being compiled, there must be something wrong that cmake thought you are using a poppler later than 0.25.0. Or it's a bug somewhere in the detection.\n. @jatmew I'll try to test latest fontforge. Usually fontforge is not full tested for linking.\n. OK, glad to hear that.\nI have difficulties compiling the latest version of fontforge myself, not sure if it's because of some latest commits.\n. Good catch! Thanks!\n. To match some other fonts, you can replace the font in PDF with others. pdf2htmlEX, as a PDF converter, or viewer in some sense, does not have the rights to change the fonts.\n. @vivin I think I mentioned that in the building instruction. Where did you find it, maybe I missed some.\n. @vivin Yeah, makes sense. Just fixed it. Thanks.\n. OK :)\n.

Most likely this is because the fonts inside the PDF are not well formed. Usually it takes more information to convert it for web than to render them directly.\nPlease also report your fontforge version.\n. @jatmew As I mentioned earlier, it's about font conversion (using Fontforge). Usually this happens when the fonts in the PDF files are malformed, but it might be something else since you've been testing on the demo files. I'll need more time to diagnose. \n. @jatmew It actually made more sense in 2013, when people were using latest git version at that time. AFAIK FontForge didn't have any official releases in 2013, so probably you can find some commit there, or maybe performance a git bisect if necessary.\n. @jatmew [This page](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Troubleshooting-Crashes) might help. You can dump the font files according to the instructions and ask in the fontforge community.\n. Usually Fontforge is not well maintained for linkage usage, so I won't expect all future releases of Fontforge are link-friendly. The latest git version of Fontforge has not been well tested (for pdf2htmlEX to link with), so I think it's better to keep the fork for now.\n. I think that fontforge is not well maintained for linking, so the future releases might not be guaranteed to work (to link with)\n. There has already been a `output-filename` option, it's like `pdf2htmlEX input.pdf output.whatever`\n. Thanks!\n. Hi @josch , thank you very much for your patches! \n\nI picked a few patches, and added you into the `AUTHORS` file. However it could be easier for us to discuss if you created pull requests.\n\nI'd like to explain a few of them I didn't apply:\n\n`use-rsvg` and the png files: right, technically speaking the svg files are source files and png files are generated from them. But these are logo files, which are unlikely to be changed in the future. I just included the svg file and the script for my (and possibly others') convenience. So I don't think it's that necessary to generate png after installation. Another consideration is that I want the png to be official, what if users generate different png files?\n\n`pdf.js`: `compatibility.js` is indeed from PDF.js, but I removed something from it that are not necessary here. I think it's better to keep this copy to make sure that it's always compatible with pdf2htmlEX.\n\n`closure` vs `yui-compressor`: it might look weird since I'm including both of them. But closure seemed to be better than yui-compressor on JS, yet it cannot handle CSS. So I'm using closure for JS and yui for CSS. \n\n`unused js file`: some supporting JS files are minimized before included in the output html file. But in HTML, it's very likely that the user want to examine the content, or to make changes, which cannot be done on minimized files. That's why I'm shipping those original source files even if they appear not to be used. Especially since the files might be changing time to time, it'll be painful for the users to find the files if not shipped in the first place.\n. @josch It's fine, I've merged them :) Thanks.\n\nI think using `compatiblity.js` from pdf.js would work, I only removed some lines not necessary, but the original version should still work.\n. Oh it should be GPLv3+, I'll fix them.\n. Fixed in the `incoming` branch.\n. Reopening #261 for this.\n. There should be a `xxx.html` generated as the loader, and you can check `pdf2htmlEX.js` for the mechanism.\n. Yes, the demo is `pdf2htmlEX.js`, which can be found in the source folder. It loads the split pages and renders them.\n. You can probably follow the guidance on the wiki and file a new issue.\n. Please follow the guide in the wiki, and provide a sample file.\n. Not sure if that's possible. Actually for some options, the default value is `auto`, and pdf2htmlEX tries to find the best value itself. But for others it might be difficult to tell 'which is best'. Especially fonts are handled by FontForge, so I have no access to the font info at all.\n\nOn the other hand, generally it's good to try to report the possible issues, and there are some warnings. If you can list a number of specific items, I might try to examine them and see if any of them can be implemented.\n. Probably you can modify the source code of pdf2htmlEX and compile it as a php module. Please refer to the php manual.\n. Looks like a duplicate of #342 \n. Please follow the instruction on wiki and provide more info.\n. @duanyao  Thanks! Let me try to update the `pdf2htmlEX` branch.\n. It seems that latest fontforge still crashes, reported fontforge/fontforge#1642\n. Fixed by #407.\n. This file uses type 3 fonts, so you need the `--process-type3` option. \nHowever seems that something wrong with the fonts, that cairo refuses to convert them.\n. Could you create a PR for this, and please add yourself in `AUTHORS`.\nBTW you may use `std::swap` for convenience.\n. Seems to be fixed. Cannot remember which commit though (or maybe in poppler).\n. Oh wait, it's not fixed. I made a mistake.\n. Right. I've included the fix in `incoming`. Can I use any PDF in that zip for a test case?\n. Thanks.\nAnd sorry for the long delay btw. I've been quite busy.\n. test case added.\n. It seems to be a bug of poppler, `pdftocairo -svg` also produces a blank svg.\n. I've submitted to poppler: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=82879\n. @davidhedley Can you confirm whether this issue is fixed with PR #408 ?\n. Why do we have 'padding' chars? I thought all the text are part of the original PDF?\n. Oh I see.\nHow about storing another array for the raw text?\n. @duanyao Oh right, I was wrong, I thought the two arrays are separate.\n\nActually I'm not satisfied with the current data structure, it was an easy hack in easy versions, just enough for output, but later I found it very difficult to optimize, due to it's complicated structures.\n\nMaybe a linked list of `union{ char, state, space}` would be better?\n. Oh I didn't mean 'linked' list, just a list, could be a vector etc. Sorry.\n\nI see `PDFChar` is good way of integrating state and characters, if multiple characters are sharing the same state, we can set `state` of the those following the first one to be `nullptr` or the same pointer as the first one.\n\nWhat are `decomposed_idx` and `offset`?\n. PR merged. Thanks!\n. If a pdf viewer can render it correctly, there must be a way of decoding it in a standard way. \nThere are relevant functions in poppler/Gfx, not sure if we can use that.\n\nI think that disabling dumping bitmap for CMYK would confuse users, as it's not obvious that the embedded images are CMYK or not.\n. @duanyao It makes sense. Could you describe this behavior in the manpage? Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. What's a 'token'?\nI feel it is not that easy to read this way, generally I saw\n\n```\n#if DEBUG\n   do something\n#endif\n```\n\nor\n\n```\nDEBUG_PRINT(\"%s\\n\", something)\n```\n\nBut your `DT_DEBUG` looks like a function, but it's not. Could be less readable than #if/#endif\n. Not sure if minimizing token would have any advantages for us.\n\nAbout 'mimic a function', it's for readability, the macro you defined looks like a function, but does something quite different than it appears. \n\nFor example\n\n```\nDEBUG(int i);\n.. something else ...\nDEBUG(cout << i);\n```\n\nIt's not obvious that DEBUG(int i) defines a local variable in the scope, and the lines are harder to read -- unless the reader find the definition of DEBUG\n\nOn the other hand, for the `#if DEBUG` and `DEBUG_PRINT` cases, I bet most reader can understand it just as normal statements.\n\nAnother reason would be, it hurts syntax highlighting.\n\nHope that it makes sense to you.\n. Oh, if those macros are only for your own debug purpose, probably you should not leave them there. I thought you might ask people to enable them and show you the message for diagnosis.\n. In that case, I think readability is more important, that's why we put so\nmuch efforts in comments and coding styles when we share code. What do you\nthink?\n\nOn Wed, Aug 6, 2014 at 1:23 AM, Duan Yao notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Not for normal users.

I just feel it very weird to define a local variable like `DEBUG(int i)`.\n\n`DEBUG(printf(...))` looks a little bit better, but why not `DEBUG_PRINT` etc?\n. How would you write a loop then\n\n```\nDEBUG(for(...) {)\nDEBUG(...)\nDEBUG(})\n```\n\nlike this?\n. I think that just hurts readability too much. \n\nActually I haven't noticed the printf inside until you use this multi-line versison. I guess DEBUG_PRINTF is enough for most cases, and elsewhere you could use #if. When would do you a single-line `DEBUG(...)` that is not printing something?\n\nAlso I've been thinking, if you want the messages from the users, maybe it makes more sense to make it a runtime option, either go directly with `--debug`, or using a mask for DrawTracer. Many users are actually using the binary directly.\n. By `DEBUG_PRINTF` I mean something like this\n\n```\n#define debug_printf(...) fprintf (stderr, __VA_ARGS__)\n```\n\nDo you think a function is better than this form?\nBut indeed you are right about `cerr`, not sure how to do that with a macro.\n\nI was just thinking about creating a 'unified' function for debug messages and discourage the usage of single_line macros.\n\nAlso I think a macro for multi-line statements would also be a good switch for `debug_printf`, or your `DT_DEBUG`, could be better than switching comments.\n\nUsually for multi-line debug stuffs, I'd also enclose them with a scope, just to make sure that the local variable won't pollute the outside:\n\n```\n#if DT_DEBUG\n{\n  int i;\n  do something with i;\n  cerr << i;\n}\n#endif\n```\n\nMy recommendation would be, it's fine if you want to stick with `DT_DEBUG`, but never use it with multiple lines, especially do not define local variables there.\nInstead, use another macro, say `DRAWTRACER_DEBUG` for multi-line stuffs, and either enclose the content with a scope, or use special names to make sure that it won't affect other parts.\nAlso `DRAWTRACER_DEBUG` could be a switch of `DT_DEBUG`, and actually why not use a shorter name for `DT_DEBUG`? say `D`?\n. It could be like this\n\n```\n#define LOG(msg) if(GLOBAL_LOG_MASK & THIS_LOG_MASK) printf(msg)\n```\n\nThen we define `THIS_LOG_MASK` in each .cpp file.\n\nOr more easily, we can define `ENABLE_LOG` for each cpp file we want to enable log, somewhat like `assert`\n. How about `constexpr bool`?\n. @duanyao It's a compile-time constant.\n. It's the same I think. \n. Merged.\nThanks!\n. The error message is hard to read. Please reformat it.\n. It seems that your compiler does not support C++11 lambda, which one are you using?\n. You can of course try to compile a simple C++ program with lambda.\nIf you are not sure, just update your compiler to a recent version.\n\nregards,\n- Lu\n\nOn Tue, Aug 5, 2014 at 10:25 PM, itsjamil notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> I am using gcc.\n> \n> [root@centos6 ~]# gcc --version\n> gcc (GCC) 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 4.4.7-4)\n> Copyright (C) 2010 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n> This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.

A wild guess, if you install poppler manually, the shared object will go in `/usr/local/lib`. If you can run pdf2htmlEx correctly, you might already have LD_LIBRARY_PATH set, but not sure why php is not following that.\nA quick fix would be just to install everything to `/usr` instead of `/usr/local`\n. Thanks for the patch!\nI just reviewed it, and found several places that are not fitting the conventions in pdf2htmlEX.\nAccording the email, would you like me to put more comments such that you can change, or do you want me to rewrite base on your code?\n. Sorry for the delay, I've been quite busy in the past month.\nPlease review my comments.\n. BTW, could you change this PR to the `incoming` branch?\n. And, can you provide a test case to https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX-tests/ ?\n. You need also to add one item in the manifest file, and generate a\nreference image.\nPlease also run the test suite to make sure that your patch does not lead\nto regression.\n\nOn Sat, Nov 15, 2014 at 12:09 AM, Simon Chenard notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> For the test suite : do I only need to add a file in the files/ folder\n> (grey and one page only)?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/pull/413#issuecomment-63086957.\n. @afrosimon I've integrated a new test framework, so you need to add a pdf file, add a new `test_**` in `test_conversion.py`, and generate a new reference image via `P2H_TEST_GEN=1 ./test.py test_**`\n. Thanks!\n. Please provide the file and the command line you used.\n. I cannot reproduce it.  But just a guess, if you are using `--split-page` and open the files with `file://` instead of `http://`, there might be a program for some browsers.\nDoes it occur to all the browsers?\n. The preprocessor only check text, I don't remember there's anything related to images.\n\nCan you provide a sample file?\n. I guess that the file name of the logo image is changed into the format `bgxx.png` ( I cannot remember the exact template), such that when the logo image is introduced, it overwrites the background image of a page. This also explains why it occurs on the same page number.\n\nBut since I cannot reproduce it by all means, it could be something wrong in your configuration. can you show the manifest file?\n. @duanyao Thanks for the analysis!\n\nI cannot reproduce it after #414, @afrosimon could you test again with latest `incoming` branch?\n. @duanyao OK, I can reproduce it now. The `inline-block` rule is not only for whitespaces, but also for negative offsets, e.g.\n\n```\n<span>Hello <span style=\"margin-left:-10px\">World!</span></span>\n```\n\nI remember that without this rule, Things after `World` are not positioned correctly.\n. @duanyao It was for negative shifts, e.g. http://jsfiddle.net/v19q42nh/2/\nBasically after a negative shift, we want following letters to be place directly after the shift.\n\nIf it's getting overridden, it looks like a bug. \n. Yes I did actually.\nBut what shall we use without it?\n. @duanyao I see, and I remember that there is code for this: we don't close a `span` tag if it starts with negative margin until the end of the line. So instead of\n`<span style=\"margin-left:-1em\">Text</span><span class=\"class\">Other text</span>`\nwe do\n`<span style=\"margin-left:-1em\">Text<span class=\"class\">Other text</span></span>`\n\nSo probably we can modify the default style for `span` for now, and in the future we add more test cases to verify.\n. @davidhedley Can you suggest a workaround for this issue?\n. @afrosimon Seems that it's been fixed via #484. Can you verify this? Also is it ok to use this file as a test case in pdf2htmlEX?\n. There's no optimizations, but something might be done during font conversion.\n\nOne thing that might be relevant is that, in the preprocessing stage, pdf2htmlEX tries to collect all the characters used in the file. \n\nHave you tried different font formats?\n\nFor the test case it would be best if you create a public test case, which would be easier to track for everyone. \n. Should have been fixed.\n. No, there is not currently.\n. What about `/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/*fontforge*`\n. @micha-nerdlichter Now the latest fontforge can be used, if it cannot be compiled, please file a issue in their repo.\n. I cannot access the URL.\n. Could you upload it again?\n. Is it the same as #430 ?\n. Could you try to compile from source, or submit the issue to homebrew?\n. Please provide a sample input.\n. If there's a line of width 0.5px, and we zoom the PDF file by 2x when converting it to html, will it be 1px or 2px in the output?\n\nI think the best solution would be to create a new option, and set the default value to shape maybe.\n. Sorry for the delay. I think the patch is ready to merge. Please just change the PR from `master` to the `incoming` branch.\nThanks!\n. I heard that pdf2htmlEX had been included in several Gentoo overlays, not sure if they are still working.\n. Oh I see. Thanks!\n. It seems that Fontforge has update such that pdf2htmlEX can be linked with the latest version now.\n. Thanks!\n. I see only a epub file there. Please try the latest `incoming` branch.\nIf the problem still exists, please upload the file again and provide a link here.\n. The error message seems to come from ttfautohint. Is there a difference if you do no use ttfautohint?\n. The font may not look well without ttfautohint, especially on Windows.\nPlease make sure that you are using the latest version of ttfautohint, and please consider filing a bug to ttfautohint if the problem still exists.\n. I'm closing this as it's duplicate of #349 \nIt seems that for some period of time I can no longer maintain the ubuntu ppa. If you can help maintain it, please set up a ppa and post the link on the wiki. Thanks!\n. No, while you can easily generate thumbnails with other tools like `pdftocairo`.\n. Can you try to isolate the font file according to https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Troubleshooting-Crashes ?\nIf it's caused by font files, please test with fontforge.\n. Most likely it means the encoding in the PDF file is corrupted.\n. See #213 \n. @moshere  I meant this is a known issue.\n. Is any of `glib.h` in your search path for header files?\n. Search paths are defined such that the compiler can find pre-defined system header files. The files have to be located in those folders, or to be specified via commandline  options, in order to be found.\n. @duanyao What do you think now?\n. For the new parameter, can you provided a test case to https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX-tests/\n. @davidhedley I agree with @duanyao , that it takes less efforts, and could be safer to implement the counting in `setMimeData`. One downside is that this depends on the internal behavior of CairoOutputDev, which might be changed in the future, but it won't be too much a problem with proper test cases.\n. @davidhedley I've finished test framework, can you add a test case for this?\n. @davidhedley For now, please add one in `test_naming.py`, since this involves checking the output files. I'll rename the files later.\n. I'm about to merge this, but we need a test case for the patch.\n. @davidhedley  Oh I see, take your time. If you find anything not intuitive while adding test cases, please let me know. \n. `--space-as-offset` may not guarantee to work if either the ToUnicode mapping for the font encoding is corrupted.  In fact I had a few test cases before, where the font encoding is OK yet ToUnicode is missing or corrupted. According to my experience, there are more issues in the ToUnicode mappings, especially for old PDF files. \n\nSeems that old PDF generators/converters were not able to handle this well -- after all this has nothing to do with printing. And ToUnicode is indeed optional in the standard.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a good solution. Or possible we can take consideration of the `--to-unicode` parameter, that whether we trust the mapping.\n. Further, I'm planning to disable `DrawTracer` completely when `ENABLE_SVG` is off:\n- Fontforge now depends on cairo, so probably cairo will be mandatory in the future\n- In the future DrawTracer may not depend on cairo any more \n. Closing it as it does not seem to be necessary for now.\n. Fixed.\n. Most likely your compiler might bee too old. Which version is it?\n. cmake is not a compiler. I meant your c++ compiler.\n2014-11-18 \u4e0b\u53481:41\u4e8e \"tonypius\" notifications@github.com\u5199\u9053\uff1a\n\n> My cmake compiler version is 2.8..

I wonder if it's solved now.\n. travis is failing because of test cases.\nWhich script do you mean?\n. Did you add the Fontforge PPA (https://launchpad.net/~fontforge/+archive/ubuntu/fontforge)?\nIf not, please add it, update the packages and see if it helps.\n\nI thought the Fontforge PPA should be automatically dependency by pdf2htmlEX PPA, but maybe not.\n. I've copied the fontforge packages into pdf2htmlEX PPA. Please try again.\nPlease close the issue if it's fixed.\n. Done.\n. I cannot access the link. I got a \"403 Forbidden\" error.\n\nUsually letter spacing comes from the original PDF file, unless text optimization is turned on. \n. I can reproduce it. Yet given the size of the pdf file, especially the image with high resolutions, I don't think the cpu usage is too high.\n. flatten is a step of processing fonts in pdf2htmlEX. Can you provide a sample PDF file?\n. Just fixed in `incoming`.\n. I'll test again.\n. OK.\n. @IvanSolovjev Did the `master` branch not work for you?\n. No\uff0c this is not a PDF viewer would do. You may need to manipulate the file yourself.\n. @duanyao how about creating a repo on GitHub, and let user provide files using pull requests. Might be easier to make reference that way.\n\nAbout this issue, I will add code to show warning when `--space-as-offset` is used on such fonts.\n. @duanyao I can create the repo. Anonymous submits will not be allowed, and we may add license stuffs to allow us to use the files as test cases. How about that?\n. Can you provide a sample input?\n. I can no longer access the URL. Can you upload it again?\n. I tested with you PDF file.\n\nThe first page uses a CID Type0 OpenType font, which was not supported by pdf2htmlEX before. And I've just fixed in the `incoming` branch.\n\nFor the rest 2 pages, unfortunately seems that the font files used cannot be supported by poppler. You may not be able to view the files correctly with a PDF viewer using poppler. You may report a bug to poppler if you like :)\n\nThanks for reporting, can I use the PDF file as a test case for pdf2htmlEX?\n. Remarks on poppler, there's a warning `Syntax Warning: Mismatch between font type and embedded font file`, so it could be something wrong in the PDF file instead.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks! Let me take a look.\n. Thanks for the PR! It looks in good shape to me, just need a few more modifications.\n\nIt seems that Travis CI failed with this patch, can you find the reason? Are you able to run the test cases locally?\n. Oh, and don't forget to add yourself to `AUTHORS` :)\n. @afrosimon the `SAUCE` stuff is protected, so probably only I can test it, and I will do it.\nSo don't worry about the test cases, I'll take it here.\n\nPlease add yourself to `AUTHORS`\n. Looks good to me now. Thanks for your effort!\nI'll try to fix the tests.\n. @afrosimon I found that the test case you provided triggers #483, I wonder if you can provided a simpler test case, just to fix the auto tests.\n. @afrosimon Yes, I will also use this file to test that bug. What I meant was to release a version before I fix this bug, as I didn't manage to solve it. \nBut seems that I have a potential solution now, so a 'simpler' case is not necessary for now. I will ask you again if I cannot fix #483. Thanks.\n. I cannot reproduce it. Please try the latest `incoming` branch.\n. It is possible to do that, but you might want to understand the css rules defined by pdf2htmlEX in order to hack them.\n. It seems that you need to hack the source code of pdf2htmlEX, or write an (external) post-processor for your task. Unfortunately it is not supported by pdf2htmlEX now. There are use cases integrating pdf2htmlEX's output in their web pages, and you might want to figure out how they did that. \n. @gabrieltong Is it solved now?\n. Hope it works for you.\nGenerally configure & install poppler is not relevant here.\n. I'm not sure if you have enabled --correct-text-visiblity without enabling svg, in which case bounding boxes will be used to estimated the border.\n\nOr, the image itself may be rectangular, although some part of it appear to be visually blank.\n\nCan you identify which situation it is?\n. There used to be such a feature, but removed, as it didn't work well.\nBut anyway this is kind of a 'PDF optimization' feature, which is not likely to be included in pdf2htmlEX in the future.\n. \u6211\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709windows\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bf7\u63d0\u4f9b\u6837\u4f8b\u8f93\u5165\u3002\n. Right, could be harder than I expected. I'll take a look.\n. Fixed in the incoming branch. Thanks!\n. I have no idea. You should probably ask Mediafire. \n. Just fixed in `incoming`.\n. Let's move the discussion to the mailing list.\n. This is not yet supported. You can convert single pages, but the resource files are not shared that way.\n. @duanyao I can mark it as 'illegal', and never output it in HTML, like what we did for other similar codes: https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/blob/incoming/src/util/unicode.cc#L51 \n. @djvs Can I use this PDF file as a test case for pdf2htmlEX?\n. Fixed in the incoming branch. Please have a try.\n. If we map it to space, there will be other weird stuffs, say, `word-space`.\n. In the context where both normal spaces, zero-width spaces are used, how can you map zero-width spaces to normal spaces?\n. What if normal spaces and zero-width spaces have different widths defined, as in the font files in PDF?\n. @duanyao  I see, so we can just apply `--space-as-offset` to those chars.\n. @djvs can you verify with the lastest vesrion? And can we use your PDF as a testcase?\n. @djvs  How about the PDF file as testcase?\n. @djvs  The screenshot looks good. About the PDF file, I meant we need to make sure that the PDF is available for us to included in the test suites of pdf2htmlEX. Is it the case?\n. Thanks.\n. I don't have environments with Windows, if it happens only for specific files, please provide a sample.\n. PPA is usually the stable version, which may not include the latest commits.\nHave you tried the latest git version?\n. It looks like something wrong in fontforge to me.\n. I cannot reproduce it on Mac, with Chrome or Firefox.\n. Sorry I didn't write it clearly. I converted the files in Linux, and viewed the output on Mac. I've got only a headless linux.\n. @duanyao Looks like #87, which I did not find a solution for.\n. @hermesramos One way of solving this kind of issue, is for you to set up a VM, installing a minimal Linux, and try to reproduce it. If you can, then I can receive the VM image and continue working on it. Otherwise you may try to find the difference between the VM and your problematic environment.\n. @hermesramos Since it says 2048, the VM will be no use to us. It shows that pdf2htmlEX would work in that VM (is the output of pdf2htmlEX in the VM correct?). In this case, you need to compare and find the cause. Well I'm thinking roughly the same as @duanyao, probably something wrong with your build of fontforge, could be old dependencies.\n. @hermesramos Oh I could be wrong. When you meant 2048, is that in the original environment, or the new VM?\n. Did it work with text visibility option?\n. @sathishks It seems that the version you are using is too old. Are you using the 0.12 release, or any (git) version before the release.\nAnyways, I'd recommend updating to the latest git version.\n. The latest version is 0.13\nhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/blob/incoming/CMakeLists.txt#L12\n\nMaybe you are not using the incoming branch?\n\nOn Fri, Mar 13, 2015 at 5:27 PM, sathishks notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> @coolwanglu https://github.com/coolwanglu : I am already using latest\n> version.\n> \n> version info:\n> \n> pdf2htmlEX -v\n> pdf2htmlEX version 0.12\n> Copyright 2012-2014 Lu Wang coolwanglu@gmail.com and other contributers\n> Libraries:\n> poppler 0.25.0\n> libfontforge 20140221\n> Default data-dir: /usr/local/share/pdf2htmlEX\n> Supported image format: png jpg\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/issues/480#issuecomment-78885554\n> .\n.

Please try the latest `incoming` branch. (and reopen if necessary)\n. Seems that it works well now. Thanks @duanyao !\n. Thanks!\n\nThe negative offsets were introduced for chars with kerning, e.g. when `T` and `r` are together, they are often putting closer. In that case, a 'negative space' is put between the characters, which does not work unless it is `inline`. \n\nSeems that you patch would disable it. While we can create new `div` for each character, by selecting and copying the text out we will get an extra newline in between. \n\nFor now I believe that a correct visual is more important that text selection, but it would be best to solve both.\n. I will create a test case.\n. There is another case, when we have `<span>some text<span class=\"_\"></span><span>Hello</span></span>`, with text optimization is on, the two inner spans will be merged, into something like `<span>some text<span \"margin-left:xxx\">Hello</span></span>`, and the inner span must be `inline-block` if `margin-left` is negative.\n\nOn the other hand, this optimization seemed not to be as useful as I expected. So I'll disable that trick and focus on the correctness of the layout.\n. Please wrap the output with ```\nWhich version are you using?\n. Just fixed in `incoming`.

Wow, this is great. Thanks!\nCould you rebase to the latest incoming branch, as I just added one commit there.\n. Thanks @duanyao \nIt might make sense for Firefox to assume that the font are always well formed. But historically there are lots of PDF files with bad fonts. Yet the conversion by Fontforge is also not perfect.\n\nPersonally I'm not good at nor interested in these edge-case font issues. How about properly label them and see it will affect other people?\n. Should have been fixed.\n. Thanks for the patch! Maybe we can enabled it also for `--space-as-offset`, or just wait until such kind of PDF files emerge.\n\nOne thing I don't quite like is that touching `Cairo*` is not recommended, would make it harder to maintain.\n\nI feel that this patch adds too many states/variables, making the renderer even more messy. Of course this is due to the ugly design of the HTMLRenderer currently. I wonder if we may delay this until the overhual is finished, such that this feature may be implemented as a separated self-enclosing pass.\n\nFinally, could you also add a test case for this (maybe after we have no issues left for the code).\n\nOther possible methods I was thinking of\n- To detect empty chars using FontForge, but Type 3 fonts might not be supported, and the FontForge API could be messy\n- To detect empty chars by painting them (e.g. with SplashOutputDev), and to check if there's any update, which could be done in the preprocessor\n. Further, it seems that this is better done in `Preprocessor`, as checking if a glyph is empty might be expensive, we may check each glyph used in the document first, and store the results along with the mapping info.\nBut again, it would be better to do so after the overhaul.\n. Thanks.\n. The design of the hierarchy structures is toward the HTML output, but not according to the PDF instructions. If the design does not reflect that, maybe something is still wrong with the design. In case you were mentioning the behavior of `TextPageBuilder`, it is supposed to convert/adapt the PDF instructions to our structures in an intuitive and fast way, such that we can start working on the structures as soon as possible. \n\nYes I've been thinking about to continue using the flatten char array, just like the current design. But the problem I found is that we need to maintain lots of conditions manually. For example, if a `char` is removed (due to hidden by an image, or we decide to covert it to an offset), we need to find the `word` containing it and modify it accordingly. Then I was thinking, if we have to maintain this relationship of belonging, why don't we make it so in the structure and design API functions accordingly? This should be easier for others to understand and extend it, and potentially there could be fewer bugs.\n\nMaybe you are right about most passes are char-wised, yet we may provide a char_iterator for `TextSegment`. The overhead should be small. In fact I had also considered the design of storing all the `char`'s in a list, and defining `TextWord`'s with two iterators, but in the end I thought that the benefit of iterating characters is not worth sacrificing a better set of APIs. At least we could write something like this:\n\n```\nfor (auto & word : segment) {\n  for (auto & c : word) {\n    // do stuffs\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd about `vector` vs `list`. In the current design we are using indices as iterators, because `vector`'s iterators may be invalidated in lots of situations, and I found it ugly and error-prone to write code this way. There should less problems with `list`. And yes of course, we can always build a new array for each pass, but who is responsible to maintain the states, API designers or users? In the former case, I believe that the API could be complicated, and in the latter case (API designers can also be users here), the problem comes back again: the users have to carefully maintain the conditions while implementing the algorithm.\n\nGenerally I think for flatten-or-not, vector-or-list, both cases are equivalent in theory, but I would like to ease the process of implementing the passes on top of it.\n. OK, that sounds good to me. So we do not restrict that the same structure is used in each pass, which makes sense here.\n\nBut during the offset<->space convertion, it is possible that we add more offsets in between in order to connect words. Of course we can do so by building a new array, but I'm thinking if it will be easy to do so.\n\nAnother problem is, right after we build `TextWord`, we need to make sure that the char array will never be modified, I'm not sure if this constraint is too strong. \n\n`std::list` or intrusive list may be used to solve both problems, I wonder if there are anything we need from `vector`?\n. Oh, about transparent char, I was thinking of the case like this, suppose that we have \"ABC\", in which the letter B is covered by some image, then probably we will be able to merge A and C. But this could be edge cases.\n\nI do not remember exactly which characters are shown, some characters are transparent as defined in PDF, and some are hidden due to overlapping. Shall we show both of them in HTML (transparently)?\n. And about `inserting offset to connect words`, actually it can be done by adding a field `space_after` in the class `TextWord`, so right now I cannot think of a pass that inserting new elements in the array, which is good. \n. I do think that intrusive list is an overkill here, it's just convenient for the prototype, my plan was to use `std::list` or our own implementations eventually. I will think again about `vector` vs `list`\n\nAnd about the passes, I just realized that, if we dump all the chars first, we need to store all the styles for each char, the combine them by comparing the styles again. Could be a waste, but maybe it will be fast enough.\n. I've listed all possible passes in my mind.  Please comment.\n\nWe could discuss the implementation accordingly.\n. Yes, pointers to a style node would be a good solution.\n. I'm not sure if we can do so in step1, it depends on whether merging the word would need the information of the words. \n\nSo after some thoughts, I decided to implement the char-vector with indices. Let's see if it will work well.\n. I think that it's not easy to do so, for example, supposed that we have two words \"Hello World\", which are drawn on the canvas with different matrices (I've seen PDF files which moves to positions by changing CTM). It is possible to check that the `o` and `W` may be connected by normalizing the matrices and then adding an offset in between.\n\nHowever changing the styles on the char array might not be a good idea, usually style is used for one or more words, and I find it more natural to perform matrix-normalizing pass on the word array.\n\nCurrently the plan is to add 'shift_after_x' and 'shift_after_y' for each `Char` and `Word`. What're the benefits of Shift/Offset nodes over this design?\n. > There are quite a few chances that normal chars and offsets are converted to each other or even merged. E.g. illegal chars may be converted to offsets and further merged with surrounding offsets/whitespaces. So I think is would be convenient that both normal chars and offsets are represented by CharNode so the convertion/merging can be done in-place.\n\nWe may convert chars to offsets, but when shall we covert offsets to chars?\n\n> As to styles, I think TextStyle can be made immutable. If we want to change a CharNode's style, we usually push a new TextStyle object into the per-page array of TextStyle, and modify the CharNode's style pointer to point to the new TextStyle. Unused TextStyles are not reclaimed until end of the renderring of the page, but this should not be a big problem.\n\nBy modifying styles, usually I meant re-scaling the matrix as well as the font size, or tweaking the positions, and most of time this happens word-wise. While you can covert style for individual chars, we will get lots of new duplicated styles, which is in my mind not natural or elegant.\n\nAn example of changing the styles: [...] & fs denote the CTM and font size\n- [2,0,0,2,0,0] & 1 -> [1,0,0,1,0,0] & 2\n  So a ID matrix with font_size 2 is more natural than the former case, but there are lots of PDF doing the former way. In the old design, as well as the new one in my mind, whenever we change a style in this way, we should update all the elements using this style, instead of creating new styles for each of them. So the current design of `Segment` acts like a use-list for the style.\n\nI'm considering removing the addition `shift` field in `Char`, leaving it only in `Word`. So `char->offset` means breaking a `Word` into two, and `offset->char` means merging two `Word`'s into one. How's that to you?\n\nWith this semantic, there could be even no need to actually merge the offsets in the char-array. We may simply do that in the word-array. In this way the char-array remain the same (but the individual chars may be modified). I really prefer iterators to indices.\n\nAbout `Word`s, they may be allocated in buffers, but I think (intrusive) list might be better here as they are meant to be split or merged frequently.\n. OK, I'll finish it. In fact I found a few issues while using vector, I'm considering switching back.\n. After a few attempts, I could not find a good solution, yet I realized that the benefit could be less than I had thought. So I'm closing it. However I will try to merge char, unicode and bbox together later.\n. Thanks!\nWould you add yourself in the `AUTHORS` file?\n. Thanks!\n. Fixed in the `incoming` branch.\n. There were old issues about this, see #56 \nCurrently there's no plan to support reflowable text in pdf2htmlEX, but see #418, a plan is to supported tagged PDF, which can be created using other tools.\n\nThere's also a relevant option `--optimize-text`, which is not working quite well unfortunately.\n. What kind of messages would you like to mute?\n. Can you show some example? It would be easy to disable the progress, but mostly I saw messages from FontForge, which I'm not sure how to disable.\n. It seems to be a bug, as the output filename is optional.\nBut I cannot reproduce it.\n. Thanks for the PR, I knew that some (individual) users would like a default viewer, but seems that most users are embedding the output of pdf2htmlEX into their own pages.\n\nThe changes in this PR seem intrusive, the output can no longer be embedded this way, and there are likely to be conflicts in CSS rules as common names are used.\n\nIt would be best to make an options for this.\n. Fixed in `incoming`. Thanks~\n. @hojuruku  Right. Thanks for the explanation.\n. Fixed. Thanks!\n. You don't have sufficient dependencies installed.\n. Thanks!\nI simply removed it, as the version of fontforge is checked in cmake.\n. Hmm, I do not understand the feature you are proposing. Do you mean showing two types of output together, with a UI button that switching between them?\n. I'm not sure if there's a standard for auto-choosing video resolution, but the server may choose the best resolution according to the user-agent, or the video may be dynamically loaded via Javascript. Which could be similar for the case of PDF.\n\nRegarding ClearScan, could you provide a sample file? Yet maybe I'm still not quite understanding it, how is it relevant to pdf2htmlEX?\n. There is a `--page-filename` options, is that what you want?\n. Right now there's `--data-dir` option, but an option to specify manifest filename sounds good.\n. I remember that SVG fonts was introduced for Safari series (desktop & mobile) which are still supported now. Maybe we can remove it once it triggers more problem. There's not much effort to maintain it (as long as Fontforge supports it)\n\nRegarding outputting multiple font formats, it's been an old issue #83, but seems that nobody's interested in implementing it.\n\nSVG+CSS, yes, I've been thinking about it. Especially the motivations was to support vector graphics better, and also provided correct overlapping among text and image. (Therefore we won't need `--text-visibility` as for png backgrounds). \n\nBut mixing text and images turns out to be quite complicated. The SVG output is done by the `CairoOutputDev` from poppler. The files are not exposed in poppler as API so they are copied here and synced periodically. Once I tried to make an SVG+CSS output, but I didn't find a solution to inject font rules via cairo, which is the SVG library used. I haven't investigate since them. Maybe things have gone better now, or maybe not.\n\nRegarding `CairoOutputDev` itself, it's painful to make any modifications here, as we will need to make it sync with poppler, which changes their internal APIs often. Yet I'm not sure if they will accept any modifications to make it SVG+CSS, hope so, if not we may need to fork CairoOutputDev ourselves.\n\nOverall I definitely agree that SVG+CSS is a good idea, just hope some one would have the motivation and energy to work on it.\n. I think that PDF->SVG usually means a single SVG file as output, which is slightly (or not) different from SVG+CSS.\n. @duanyao That might be the reason why crocodoc(box.net) still use a bitmap background despite that a svg layer is being used.\n. How about mixing text and images in HTML, and we use SVG to render vector graphics and bitmaps with special effects (e.g. clipping). That way we may still use `CairoOutputDev` as a black box.\n. I was actually thinking of calling CairoOutputDev something like this\n\n```\nstruct HTMLOutputDev : OutputDev \n{\nvoid text_operations() {\n  if(!cairo_dev.empty()) {\n    cairo_dev.output_svg();\n    cairo_dev.clear(); // maybe allocate a new one\n  }\n}\n\nvoid non_test_operations(){\n  //forward to cairo_dev\n}\n\nCairoOutputDev cairo_dev;\n}\n\n```\n. What concerns me is the complexity of both CairoOutputDev and cairo-svg.\n. Yes I think so.\n\nOn Sun, May 3, 2015 at 4:11 PM, Duan Yao notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> So maybe doing all the SVG output ourselves is a more clean approch.\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/issues/516#issuecomment-98453647\n> .\n. #467 is related to this.\n. @hojuruku I think I'm losing you.

This guide only works on (specific versions) of Ubuntu. You may add it to a wiki page if you like.\nFor example, add a `Links` section in https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Building\n. You can try to tweak the dpi through parameters.\nHowever note that the size of images may not follow these values, as the empty margins may get trimmed.\n. `--zoom` and `--fit-width/height` adjust the parameters of the viewer. The quality is not altered as the users may zoom in/out themselves, and we do not want to lower the quality due to a small default zoom factor.\n. If `--split-pages` is not enabled, text should be static in the HTML.\n. I agree with @duanyao . It seems that there's few thing we can do on this side.\n. Maybe it's not very hard to support multi-html pages, using `iframe`'s. Yet special care must be taken to proper include necessary css files.\n\nBut over the years I don't feel that it's required by many people, nor any would be interested enough to send a patch.\n. For the header files, try to install `poppler-dev`\n. Or maybe named `libpoppler-dev` \n. Oh there is also a package named `libpoppler-private-dev`\n. Due to a recent bug, PSnames of the fonts are wiped out by pdf2htmlEX.\nOn the other hand, try `pdffonts`, which is a utility from poppler\n. Thanks. Probably I'll create a wiki page for user created scripts.\n. Can you copy the text out using a pdf viewer?

Possibly you can provide an example with commands you used.\n. That does not sound relative to pdf2htmlEX... You should probably ask in other places.\n.

Why discuss it here? I think you might want to report bugs to the software, unless you found that the output of pdf2htmlEX is not valid HTML.\n. Please send PR to the `incoming` branch.\n. Hi @witwall, I wonder if you tested the availability of `libgen.h`. I believe it's not a standard c++ header, and seems gnulib is required? Unfortunatley this might break build for lots of users.\n\nref: https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/manual/html_node/libgen_002eh.html\n. You need to install Cairo with SVG support. Maybe check the configure parameters and dependencies of cairo.\n. Hmm. so the code may not be compatible with some versions of poppler. I need to investigate.\n. That version is too old, pdf2htmlEX won't work well with it.\n. As shown in the message \"Error: no SVG support found in Cairo\"\n\nEither you install cairo with svg support, or disable svg support.\n. There's already such a tool in poppler, please try it.\n. That's most likely browser bugs. If I remember correctly, Firefox has this bug for a long time, but Chrome should work.\nAnd it doesn't matter how the svg is generated, in fact the svg generation code are from poppler.\n. This is probably not something a converter should do. Maybe you can find such a tool for PDF files, and split the files before converting them into HTML.\n. I'd like to add this if anyone would like to maintain it.\n. Yes this feature has been one of the most desired ones. Yet it's not easily to do so.\n\nHere's the wiki page for discussions: https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Reflowable-Text\n\nIt might be relatively easy if there's corresponding tag information in PDF. And you might also try if this works for you http://latex2html5.com/\n. Thanks!\n. Cannot reproduce on my machine.\n. Most likely it's because the numbers (font sizes, widths) are rounded in the browser. Maybe you can try a larger number of `--font-size-multiplier`.\n\nIn the future we can improve this by preventing long whitespace\n. I cannot reproduce with Firefox + Mac.\nWhat's the command and the browser you used?\n. I haven't got time to set up a Cent OS myself.\nYou can just check the dependencies in the wiki page.\n.

Can you provide a simple test case?\n. Thanks for the update :)\nJust to make sure, which command were you using to generate this file?\n. Some tools may work with specific PDF files, but in general this is not supported by pdf2htmlEX.\n. Duplicate of #219\n. One possible way is to read the output dir and check the page files. \n. The reason for the root directory is probably because [there's no temp dir found](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/blob/master/src/util/mingw.cc#L58).\n\nHowever I'm not sure about the filenames, what's the filename of the input file?\n. These files could be generated by Fontforge or other libraries, yet I'm not sure.\n. I wonder if the `use_cropbox` parameter would help\n. Seems that the poppler mailing list is a better place to discuss about it, as pdfimages is part of poppler.\n. I believe this is beyond the scope of pdf2htmlEX, it looks to me a PDF optimization task: to reduce the number of fonts without altering the rendering.\n. https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Unfeatures\n. The name 'ignore-partial-clipping' could be ambiguous, for those chars partially clipped, are we ignoring the clipping (so the chars will be displayed), or the chars (otherwise).\n\nI'd suggest something like --partial-clipped-text=[auto|hidden|shown]\n. There was a idea about support custom prefix for all the class names, which can be specified via commandline. But it has not been implemented yet unfortunately.\n. @duanyao is right, the project has not been optimizing for SEO unfortunately.\n. @fmalina Interesting project! Thanks for sharing.\n. It seems that you want to embed jquery code into html, which might be too long for the parser?\nTry to use external js files maybe?\n.

It appears that homebrew is using my fork of fontforge, which is not well maintained. \n\nThanks for mentioning the input. I'll add it to the wiki\n. Not sure if this is worth a dedicated parameter, but you can hack `font.cc` where the fonts are named, maybe you can use the internal ID as part of the filename.\n. Thanks!\n. It's not supported yet. Can you provide a sample pdf?\n. I'm not familiar with how transliteration works, you might want to take a look at `HTMLRenderer/text.cc`, or `HTMLTextLine.cc` where the characters are collected and rendered.\n\nAnd do you know why translit mess up the formatting?\n. ?\n. I checked the pdf, the text are rendered twice, at the exact same position. \nMaybe we can detect and remove same text at the same position as `pdftohtml` does\n. use `--no-drm`\n. This has never been considered, but I believe you will always get the same output for the same input.\n\nEach `y` class means a `y`-value for the elements, usually a new class is generated when a new value is found.\n\nI don't think pdf2htmlEX is suitable for your task. How about `pdftotext`, or to decompress the PDF files (e.g. with pdftk) and then simply `diff` the PDF files?\n. Hi, thanks for reporting.\n\nFrom the first stack trace you provided, it does look like something wrong in FontForge, #1 through #9 are all FontForge function.\n\nAbout the updated issue, it's a bug in pdf2htmlEX, for a quick fix:\n\n``` diff\ndiff --git a/src/pdf2htmlEX.cc b/src/pdf2htmlEX.cc\nindex cf568b2..96e58ea 100644\n--- a/src/pdf2htmlEX.cc\n+++ b/src/pdf2htmlEX.cc\n@@ -111,7 +111,7 @@ void prepare_directories()\n\n     errno = 0;\n\n-    unique_ptr<char> pBuf(new char[tmp_dir.size() + 1]);\n+    unique_ptr<char[]> pBuf(new char[tmp_dir.size() + 1]);\n     strcpy(pBuf.get(), tmp_dir.c_str());\n     auto p = mkdtemp(pBuf.get());\n     if(p == nullptr)\n```\n.

There must be an earlier bug for this, but I couldn't find it.\n\nThe problem is there's nowhere in the font file nor in the ToUnicode File that marks this glyph as a whitespace. The only thing we know is that the glyph is empty. \n\nOne thing I can do is to create a flag something like `--empty-glyph-to-offset`.\n. Yes, if there's nothing in the glyph, it will be treated as an offset shift, not necessary but often a whitespace.\n\nNot sure about PDF viewers, but I guess so.\n. Although not 100% sure, it looks like a crash in FontForge.\nCan try [this](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Troubleshooting-Crashes)?\n. I'm feeling that this is beyond the scope of pdf2htmlEX, can you elaborate what do you need from pdf2htmlEX?\n. I cherry picked your commits.\nThanks for the patch!\n\nPlease also add yourself to `AUTHORS`\n. Previously I had a partial patch for that, but didn't managed to merge it.\nSo far it's not supported in pdf2htmlEX, but maybe you can try the SVG format\n. Please read the manpage about the `--bg-format` param.\n. Thanks for your PR, can you squash the commits?. Hi, please use the incoming branch, and merge your commits.. Please merge your commit.\r\n\r\nAlso I think you need to rebase the branch, there are so many irrelevant commits in this PR.. It should have been implemented. Can you please provide a PDF that pdf2htmlEX doesn't work with?\n. Bug identified and fixed.\nPlease have a check :)\n. Not exactly, in pdf the spacings are defined in absolute units.\nBut you are right, I should have multiple it by draw_scale and transform matrix.\n\nI wonder if you have a pdf with non-zero spacing. I've been looking for one for debugging.\n. Thanks for the pdf.\n\nI've heard about the recommendation of using 'em'. I'm assuming that it don't hurt or improve the performance (of web browsers) comparing with 'px'.\n\nBut currently there's a problem with the browsers, they may now use the exact font size as I have specified.\nFor example 8px may be used even if 8.3px has been specified.\n\nSo using relative distances with 'em' may hurt the display effect in this case. the line will be stretched or squeezed.\n. Fixed. Please have a try.\n. \u8ddf\u8bed\u8a00\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0d\u5927\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u5b57\u4f53\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u3002\nCJK\u7cfb\u5217\u4e00\u822c\u4f1a\u7528CID\u5b57\u4f53\uff0c\u53ea\u8981popppler\u80fd\u8ba4\u7406\u8bba\u4e0apdf2htmlEX\u4e5f\u80fd\u8ba4\u3002\n\u4e0d\u8fc7\u76ee\u524d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u592a\u591f\uff0c\u624b\u8fb9\u6ca1\u6709\u592a\u591a\u4e2d\u6587pdf\u3002\u5e76\u4e0d\u662f\u8bf4\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u7528\u5230\u5404\u79cd\u5947\u602a\u7f16\u7801\u7684pdf\u3002\n\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u62ff\u4e2d\u6587pdf\u8bd5\u4e00\u4e0b\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u6709\u95ee\u9898\u63d0bug\u5c31\u597d\u4e86\u3002\n. \u65b0\u589e\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e2d\u6587demo\u9875\n\nhttp://coolwanglu.github.com/pdf2htmlEX/demo/chn.html\n. \u80fd\u4e0d\u80fd\u53d1\u6211\uff1f\n\nOn Sunday, September 2, 2012, reverland wrote:\n\n> \u4f60\u8bf4\u7684\u5947\u602a\u7684\u4e2d\u6587pdf\uff0c\u6211\u8fd9\u91cc\u597d\u50cf\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\uff0c\u5728linux\u4e0b\u6839\u672c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u51fa\u4e2d\u6587\u2026\u2026\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/issues/3#issuecomment-8217481.\n. \u8fd9\u4e2apdf\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u662f\n1 \u6ca1\u6709\u5185\u5d4c\u5b57\u4f53 \uff08\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4e5f\u4e0d\u7b97\u95ee\u9898\u4e86\uff09\n2 \u7136\u540e\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5b57\u4f53\u7684\u5b57\u4f53\u540d\u7f16\u7801\u4e0d\u5bf9\uff0c\u662f\u7528gb\u4e0d\u662futf8\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2apdf2htmlEX\u6709\u7279\u5224\n3 \u6700\u540e\u6ca1\u6709\u8bf4\u660e\u5185\u5d4c\u5b57\u4f53\u7684\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u65e0\u6cd5\u8f6c\u6210unicode\n\n\u7531\u4e8e2\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0cpoppler\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u627e\u4e0d\u5230\u5b57\u4f53\n\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u88c5\u4e86gb\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u5b8b\u4f53\uff0c\u8bd5\u8bd5--embed-external-font 1\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u6216\u8bb8\u80fd\u6210\u529f\n\nOn Sun, Sep 2, 2012 at 2:01 PM, reverland notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> @coolwanglu https://github.com/coolwanglu \u5df2\u53d1\u90ae\u7bb1\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/issues/3#issuecomment-8219317.\n. \u8981\u8bf4\u8fd9\u79cd\u7f16\u7801\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u539f\u6765mp3 tag\n\u90fd\u662fwindows\u641e\u7684\u9b3c\u3002\u3002\u3002\n. I see, so ffi is interpreted as f f i instead of a single unicode value.\nThe font is ok, if you replace the \"ffi\" with \"&#xfb03;\" in the html, you'll see the correct one.\n\nSo I may need special process for this kind of characters.\nCan you please show me some reference if you are familiar with it. I know nothing but fi, ff and ffi.\n. And the bad thing is, once 'ffi' is interpreted as a single character, you can no longer reach it by searching for 'ffi' (at least for Firefox).\n\nMay need an option for it.\n. Well my Firefox or Chrome cannot connect 'ffi' automatically.\nCan you please send me the html file you got? \nAmazing.\n. The HTML file doesn't work on my machine (ubuntu 12.04)\nI heard that at least firefox should recognize those ligatures automatically, and thus there are tutorials about disabling it.\n\nI'll keep an eye on it. Maybe I should add some information in the font.\n. well, in my browser utf-8 is default.\nAnd still no ligatures, tried firefox, chrome in Ubuntu and safari in ios.\n\nI've seen some css properties that would enable ligatures, but none works for me\n. seems that I didn't add ligature info to the font, which should be found using fontforge.\nhowever, still I don't know how to do it.\nmaybe I'll output 0xfb03 unicode instead of translated 'ffi'\n. I don't remove any glyphs, and the encoding is provided in the PDF.\n\nBy translating, I didn't mean only 0xfb03 to ffi, it was for text copying.\n\nSome PDF use fonts with special encodings, for example \"Hello\" may be internally stored as #%{{}, and a ToUnicode map may be provided, with which you will get Hello when you select and copy that word.\n\nThere is no such mechanism in HTML, so I have to translate myself.\n\nNow according to the map, 0xfb03 ''means\" 'ffi', so that's the cause.\nAnd what's more, maybe some other meaningless code is used for it, for example, '!', so I cannot simply disable the translation.\n\nI think it's the responsibility (or freedom) of brower to recognize (or not) ligatures, but probably I should add such info into fonts.\nBut currently I've got no idea how to do it.\n\nBtw, what do you mean by using larger font sizes?\n. oh you mean the size of font files.\n\nusually pdf generaters embed only necessary glyphs, you may use the option --clean-tmp 0on your pdf, and examine the ttf files.\n\nthe files are directly dumped from the pdf file, with only re-encoding. I think it doesn't increase the size too much.\n\nIf you find the html file is too large, usually it is the text part, i.e., pure html part. you see pdf is usually compressed, but I cannot do it for html.\n\nIf it is a big problem , I will consider compressing the html file, and decode it using javascript inthe future. Which is however not a concern right now.\n. and seems that ligature info will not be more than a few bytes. I will try to make sure.\n. Well if it is ok for you, you may render everything in images, but text\nselection won't work anymore.\nIn that case, actually images will be much much larger than now.\n\nYou can comment the line with 'if' in bgrenderer.cc ane give a try.\n\nOn Monday, August 20, 2012, Deepak wrote:\n\n> Yeah you are right about it. it's just necessary glyphs.

The problem should not be about letter space, but actually absolute positioned strings.\n\nI've been optimizing mainly for scientific papers. Some pdf generaters, e.g. LaTeX, try to handle all the spaces themselves. So in the pdf file you will not see any space charecter, but all positined string pieces.\nSo actually the whitespaces were added intendedly, to make text copy works better.\n\nYou may find the code in text.cc, just search for the string \"span\", and remove the whitespace inside each span tag.\n\nIf that works for you, I may consider adding an option for this.\n. oops\nit should be line 294 of state.cc\n. By 'shows fonts correctly', do you mean that 'ffi' is connected now? Which browser are you using?\n. pdf2htmlEX does not do special check on these spaces, it just follows the instructions in PDF.\nHow do you distinguish a normal space between a positional one, without understanding the context?\n. Have to be off for hours now. Will be back and check the ffi thing then.\n. Yes, I'm also doing rectangle merging, for lines. Normally the words are connected automatically as there is no space in the middle.\n\nSo for [Hello] and [ guys!], or [Hel] and [lo guys!], both will be merged into [Hello guys!]\n\nIn your case, the key thing is that there IS a space between 'fa' and 'mi'.\nAnd do you want an option removing all the spaces? \nI think it'll be kind of weird though.\n. I noticed that the word space is negative, and I tried to removed those whitespaces whose width + word space is 0.\n\nHowever it doesn't work, because there is also a negative letter space...\n\nSo maybe in your case, we need to examine each whtiespace, check its final width and decide if there should be a real whitespace in the output.\n\nBut currently indeed it's not easy to implement that. \n\nAnyway I think this feature would be helpful, at least evince handles this well.\n\nPatches are welcome whenever you get a better algorithm on this.\n. I think your method should work, but the threshold may be variant for\ndifferent pdf.\nWhat do you mean by 'didn't work accurately', is it 'removing too much\nspace', or 'missed too much space'?\n\nBut seems that sometimes I cannot get correct width of ' ' through poppler.\n\nOn Wed, Aug 22, 2012 at 4:01 PM, Deepak notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> I tried three different technique the one with look ahead with whitespace\n> works the best but it breaks some visual stuff which is unacceptable.\n> \n> I scanned characters and check if whitespace between this and next char is\n> less than threshold and current character is space then trim it off.\n> Worked fine for some pdf but some didn't work accurately.

I've just fixed a bug that might affect this issue, could you please merge your code with the lastest devv branch?\nAlso please try the latest exp branch.\n. margin-left is for negative shifting, I've got no better solution than this.\n\nI've just fixed another bug that affecting install_whitespace, please check if it helps.\n. Please check if the --space-as-offset option in the latest 'exp' branch works for you\n. The problem is the ToUnicode map provided in the PDF is bad. both 'e' and 'E' are mapped to 'e'.\nIt's not the fault of poppler nor pdf2htmlEX.\n\nI'll add an option that ignore the ToUnicode map for a specified font, as I've seen many bad ToUnicode maps. With the optioned enabled, pdf2htmlEX will work as if there's no such map, in which case the font should be able to render correctly, but text selection may not work\n. I've just hacked the pdf, that removing the ToUnicode map of the font. Then I got the correct characters.\nNow I need a ToUnicode mapping based only on the font info, without ToUnicode map provided in PDF.\nThere's a function I can use in poppler, but no public. \nI'm contacting with poppler guys before I have to rewrite the function.\n. I used another method for it. Now tounicode is disabled for nonTTF fonts by default.\nPlease test it as much as you can :)\n. No, I embed the 'entire font' in the PDF. Previously I meant that usually\nPDF generators embed only necessary glyphs.\nProbably I'll consider this in the future, as currently I don't have an\neasy to manipulating the glyphs, or counting used ones.\n\nOn Tue, Aug 28, 2012 at 9:08 PM, Deepak notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Tested intensively on variety of PDFs.

Hi @iapain \nIn the latest devv branch, I've change the default behaviour when --tounicode=0\nBasically when **--tounicode=1**, the ToUnicode Map will be forced applied, when **--tounicode=-1**, the map will be completely ignored.\n\nWhen **--tounicode=0**, the map is attempted to be applied. If anything wrong is found, it'll be dropped.\n\nI changed the behaviour because I have received many PDF files where there are Type 1 fonts embedded without proper font names in the font, whereas proper ToUnicode CMaps are provided. These are actually more consistent with the PDF Standard.\n\nWhat do you say about it?\n. I mean the default behavior is not good the that PDF.\nAnd there's a typo, please specify \"-1\" to force disabling tounicode map,\ni.e. for that PDF.\n\nOn Mon, Sep 24, 2012 at 7:00 PM, Deepak notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> I think it's very wise decision.

Thanks for reporting, but please open a new issue instead of simply leaving message here.\n\npdf2htmlEX is a converter, it always follows the original content in PDF. So if you see spaces among letter, that would means there ARE spaces in the PDF. And it's not possible for pdf2htmlEX to recognize the words.\n\nAbout zooming, indeed there are problems for different browsers, the problem should not be with the spaces, but font sizes. The browser may round the font size, such that letter will be larger or smaller than they should be. To check if it's the problem you saw, just zoom in, when the letters are large enough, there should never be any problem with font sizes (and thus spaces). \n\nCurrently I don't have any solutions to this, but you may want to check the manpage about the --font-size-multiplier parameter.\n. Can you point out the location of the word 'arbeitsmarkt' in the PDF? or\nshow me a pdf with only that word. I want to compare the visuals.\n\nI didn't mean ' ' either, but consider this:\n\nIn PDF, almost everything is absolutely positioned. For the word apple,\nsuppose all letter are of width 10px, in PDF, the following two operations\nshould be the same\n\n(1) write 'apple' at (0,0) with font size 10px\n(2) write 'app' at (0,0) and 'le' at (30,0), both with font size 10px\n\nand there is no ' '\n\n(2) actually often appears in PDF, I don't know why but it's the truth.\n\npdf2htmlEX cannot and will not recognize the word 'apple' in (2), and will\ngenerate the HTML code you saw.\n\nThe problems when you zoom out, say 33%, idealy (2) should become\n(2) write 'app' at (0,0) and 'le' at (10,0), with font size 3.33px.\nBut the browser may not be happy with '3.33px', it may use '3px' or '3.5px'\nor something else, such that the letters may overlapped or be separated.\n\nAlso notice that there is no ' ' inside the <span> tag except for the last\none, which is correct.\n\nOn Mon, Jan 7, 2013 at 7:00 PM, nmm notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> OK i will make new issue for the last problem with \"g\" character.\n> About the spaces, please note that i don't mean space literal, just a\n> visualized whitespace where there is no space literals.\n> here is the zoomed + selected screenshot of the word:\n> https://www.dropbox.com/s/qehunz8qq9jc4ll/Arbeits_marktZoomedSelected.PNG\n> I am wondering can we remove these empty span tags, as in pdf there is\n> nothing between characters for the word - i think this will resolve the\n> issue?\n> Shall i make another issue for this too?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/issues/7#issuecomment-11947768.\n.

Why do you remove those js code?\nThey are not equivalent.\nThe js code loads the pages one by one asynchronously,\nwhich prevents page rendering blocks UI events.\n. With that line of CSS, the browser will still try to redraw everything\nbefore it can response user's actions.\n\nSo when the browser loads all the pages gradually, it'll test if the new\nnode should be drawn.\nWith your CSS, still all nodes are drawn as soon as they are loaded,\nmeanwhile you can get no response of actions like scrolling, so the users\nmay feel stuck.\n\nBut with my CSS, all pages are hidden at first, so the browser knows that\nthere's nothing to draw at the beginning.\nThe JS tell the browser to set 'display:block' for each page, and the key\npoint is that it's done with setTimeOut, which is just a new event. And the\nevent is in the same queue as UI events (scrolling etc.) So user actions\ncan be responed before next pages are revealed.\n\nOn Fri, Sep 7, 2012 at 2:15 PM, Deepak notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Wouldn't CSS will do the same here.

So fontforge may built with or without spiro.\nAnd pdf2htmlEX should be built in the same envrionment.\n\nThere's a macro _NO_LIBSPIRO defined (or not, if your fontforge was built\nwith spiro), and it affects header files like spinefont.h\n\nAccording to your cmake log, config.h should be found, which should be in\nthe same folder as fontforge.h\n\nOne possible situation is that fontforge was built with spiro, but you\ndidn't install the headers of libspiro.\nBut everything should be fine if you compiled fontforge yourself.\n\nSeg fault, hmm, can you please check the stack?\n\nThanks a lot!\n\nBe 'right' back after some sleep.\n\nOn Mon, Sep 17, 2012 at 3:19 AM, Deepak notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> BTW installing libspiro helped but it result in segmentation fault.

Since there's no change of the code calling fontforge, still I guess the program is about config.h, as you see error of missing header files or libspiro.\n\nFirst I guess you need to remove libspiro.\nThen run make VERBOSE=1, check the line of ff.c, see if there is  \"-include xxx/fontforge/config.h\"\n. @Kamek It's ok if you see \"libfontforge not detected\", because that's for fontforge about a few weeks ago.\n. And there's another check. In ff_load_font of ff.c, and GenerateScript in fontforge/savefont.c\n\nTry print out sizeof(struct SplineFont)\nThey should be the same.\n. I tried to diff with the old version.\nlibgunicode is linked with (which is not before). \nI hope that's not the cause..\n. @Kamek did you get the same stack dump as @iapain ?\n\nIf so, maybe you can try to comment out all the content of ff_save in ff.c\nBut that's not the correct way, I hope the real cause could be found.\n. Interestingly, I reproduced this on Windows, and I changed CMakeList accordingly.\nWondering it'd help in your cases.\n. crashing in ff_save, it remind me that I've found a similar crashing.\nThe reason was that struct SplineFont has been defined differently in pdf2htmlEX and fontforge.\n. I'm closing it and open a new one for ff_save\n. @Kamek could you please try the latest master branch, if should be able to compile.\ncould you please try if it still crashes?\n\nAccording to @iapain , if he install pdf2htmlEX from macports, everything would be fine. \nBut it would crash if he compile it manually...weird.\n.

Hi, thank you for your attention and your thoughts.\nFirst of all, I wrote this stuff for fun, but not to provide a great tool.\nIf it's useful for others, I'll be glad, but that's side effect.\n\nI'll definitely take consideration of the features you mentioned, but I'll just pick those attractive to me. Especially I don't want to do anything about UI, which is annoying to me. However, patches are always welcome.\n\nI've actually using a little bit jquery there. You see everything is open now comparing to PDF, you can actually do anything you had imagined with JS, as you have full control of the document now.\n\nAbout LaTeX,  yes, it's true that it'll be better if convert directly from LaTeX. But pdf2htmlEX is not for PDF generated by LaTeX only, and there needs lots of work dealing with the interfaces of LaTeX, that's not some trivial work.\n\nFor now, I guess LaTeX->PDF->HTML would be acceptable for most people.\n. Hi, If you are focused on user experience only, I suggest you convert a simple PDF and read the generated HTML, it should be simple enough to understand, basically, absolute positioning + a few optimization.\n\nIf you want to change pdf2htmlEX itself, first I suggest you learn the PDF format a little bit, such that pdf2htmlEX itself will be quite straightforward.\n\nBlog plot...hmm...., one problem is that the design is still being changed, I knew nothing about PDF format before I wrote pdf2htmlEX, and I'm still learning. It'd better if you ask a specific question, such that it'll be easier for me to answer.\n. There are several ways as far as I know.\n\nThere's an render mode, although not very sure, in which text are rendered transparently, which is for OCR document. But it may not be suitable for your case, as it'll be actually rendered by pdf2htmlEX in the future.\n\nActually I'm considering something similar, I guess annotation might be a good choice, and probably a special prefix should be necessary. But annotation is somewhat independent from text : they are separated rectangles, but not property of text.\n\nMaybe I'll be able to find something useful when I have a better understanding of PDF.\n. Cannot reproduce it on my machine. I can convert it without any problem\nAre you using the latest master branch?\n. solved as discussed\n. Confirmed.\nThanks for reporting.\n. Not sure what I have done, but seems this has been fixed.\nPlease check with latest master branch.\n. How about -ggdb\n. Wondering why you need to toggle '-Wall'\n\nTo me it's more natural to add a switch between '-O2' and '-ggdb', something like DEBUG vs RELEASE, but would be more convenience I guess.\n. I actually prefer this one.\nbtw, just noticed 'pdftohtmlEX' in the very beginning, could you please also change it to 'pdf2htmlEX'\nThanks a lot!\n. Great, could you please push it to your repo such that I can merge it?\n. I can get only a patch from your gist.\n\nI mean if I can merge your fork, your commit will be logged and credited.\n\nOn Sun, Sep 23, 2012 at 8:21 PM, hasufell notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> should be:\n> git pull git://gist.github.com/3769756.git\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/pull/28#issuecomment-8797852.\n. Merged.\nThanks!\n. It's a known issue, optimization for mobile devices will be done later, and, as @iapain said, might be a work of the frontend.\n. Can you elaborate what should be done, for example, especially for iphone5 ?\n. Yes, somebody asked me about this before.\n\nI've not found a trivial way to make GetOpt accepting a file as\nsupplementary parameters.\n\nSo maybe I need parse some format myself.\n\nI'll use JSON if I'm writing in Python, but how about C++?\n\nAnyway it'll be a 'user-experience' feature, but not a 'technical'\nfeatures, which is far less interesting to me...\n\nSpeaking of mobile devices, will it be faster if images are not included,\nsay --process-nontext 0. Or maybe it will improve loading time only?\n\nOn Wed, Oct 3, 2012 at 6:58 PM, Deepak notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Pardon me, what these options going to do?

You are right about the memory issue, actually there's similar things done with Javascript, where the invisible pages are hidden, for smoother scrolling on PC.\nI'm actually trying to find a way to reduce the number of elements, but 'to not render unnecessary pages' is the job of viewers, and pdf2htmlEX provides only content conversion.\nBtw, did you mean PDF or converted HTML?\n\n@iapain issue65_en.pdf itself is 18M, and the size of converted HTML is similar, so 10+ MB did not surprise me.\nflowable text is in the TODO list, I will probably start working on it after finishing css/svg.\nHow much speed gain do you think can be brought by flowable text?\n. After a quick searching, it does not seem to be as easy as I've thought of, there are many rules related to grammar, space, positions.\nSo I'll take some time for this after finishing the background staffs.\n. @deathlord87 Thanks for your effort.\n. @deathlord87 What do you mean by UI? \n\npdf2htmlEX should extract and provide enough information from the PDF file, such that UI interface can be implemented on top of it, for example, zoom/link/outline/thumbnails etc. pdf2htmlEX should provide no UI, because I assume that publisher is likely to design their own UI theme in order to to match their websites.\n\nHowever there should be a demo UI, such that others may understand the structure of generated HTML better, you can actually find javascript script code in the repo. Currently what it does are:\n- hide necessary pages ( set display:none )\n- handle internal link jumps\n- handle zoom in/out (disabled currently)\n\nwhat's- missing for a demo UI include\n- UI elements\n  - buttons\n  - navbar\n- corresponding functions for UI elements above for the Viewer object\n- effects\n\nIn principle, the Viewer object should be out-of-the-box providing necessary function, and UI designers may directly use them.\n\nI suggest jQuery, because it's being used in the repo. Also there's a mobile version.\n\nHowever as pdf2htmlEX is for general platforms, so I don't suggest use a mobile version directly.\n. @deathlord87 I'm not familiar with Sencha Mobile, but I've used ExtJS, which is not lightweight enough to me.\n. @deathlord87 sorry for the misunderstanding. Still recommend jQuery in this case.\n. I've tested a few HTML pages produced by pdf2htmlEX, on a few low-level Android devices.\nThe results vary, depending on the browsers. Also it's not recommended to open the produced HTML files directly, since usually web browsers do not optimize in the same way as PDF readers.\n\nBut probably there will be ajax loading in the pdf2htmlEX.js\n. Can it decrease performance in any cases?\n\nOn Sat, Mar 9, 2013 at 9:32 PM, Deepak notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> We were able to increase performance by triggering hardware acceleration.\n> I have tested it with iOS device but in theory it should work same way on\n> Android Browsers as well.

Thanks @iapain, I guess that before long this issue will be solved 'automatically'...\n. @micred From my experience, it's just lagging, on all operations (zoom in/out, scroll up/down).\n. Hi @bachboss, I think that if you remove that line of CSS, the following pages won't show up. I don't have those devices so I cannot test, but it is so on Firefox.\n. @josefnorlin Are there any issues with the current version?\n. @bmatto I guess it'd be better to specify your device and browser.\n. @josefnorlin Can you provide both versions (fast and slow) of your HTML file? Maybe I will be able to find some clues.\n\nSpeaking of mobile devices, currently I've got only an iPad 1, which might be too slow for pdf2htmlEX. For a long time I have not tested pdf2htmlEX's output on modern devices, and I'm not sure if recent ones are fast enough. On the other hand, the lack of devices is not the main reason that I've not been able to fix this issue, there are even performance issues on PC for some PDF files! Although I've been working on it, there doesn't seems to be much progress :( Maybe it's just my lack of knowledge.\n\nI really appreciate your willingness for donation. However I'm afraid that I cannot make any guarantee at this moment, it's not like compatibility issues which are likely to be solved given enough time. On the bright side, as a start I would like to try to optimize the output at least for specific documents on specific devices. Can you please propose some devices (also browsers on them) which match your clients the best? I'll then try to pick the 'easiest' one for me as a start.\n. @bmatto Seems to be an interesting CSS property. Just learned. Thanks!\n. @josefnorlin Great. So I'll include this one and also the 3d transform property in the css file later.\n. I'll give my ipad to my parents in a month as they need it. Before that I would like to test the 3d transformation rule and the `webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;`, and I'll make some quick optimizations.\n\nIf any of you would like to provide some sample PDF that might are slow on mobile devices, please post a link here, or I'll just test some random ones from my collection.\n. @Toneti777 thanks! I've just downloaded the file, you may remove it now.\n. I've tested a few tricks mentioned in this thread on Safari / ipad 1G\n\nTest file is demo.pdf as used in pdf2htmlEX demo.,\n\n**webkit-overflow-scrolling** : scrolling become smoother, but the white background for each page is lost. And it makes Safari crashed a lot.\n\n**removing hidden pages out of DOM**: I used `xxx.innerHTML=''`, which does not really help\n\n**triggering 3d transformation**: tried `translateZ` and `translate3d`, did not observe any performance boost.\n\nSo I did not find any one that seems to be useful. Perhaps it depends on the document.\n. @typoheads I did read some output for PC browser, but I haven't done that for mobile browsers.\nI'm not familiar with mobile web, but I just realized that I could modify user agent. \nWill do that soon. Thanks for the reminder.\n. @typoheads  Indeed.\n\nThere is actually an SVG backend in pdf2htmlEX, which is far from mature right now though.\n. I've created a wiki page summarizing tricks that might help improving the performance on mobile devices:\nhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Mobile-Devices\nThank you very much for reporting them.\nHope it helps, and please feel free to add more if you have found new ones.\n\nIt's been nearly 2 years since this issue was created, and mobile technologies have changed a lot. It seems to me that most performance issues happened on iOS devices (am I right?). But I don't think I can confirm it with my iPad 1G, which lag on almost all output of pdf2htmlEX.\nA possible reason is due to limitations/defaults of (mobile) Safari, the latest iOS seems to be more open, not sure if it'll help.\n\nNow the issue seems vague to me, some said it's slow, some said it's OK. Some tricks seemed to work for some PDF files, but not for others. **If you have certain information for specific types of devices, please also add to that wiki page**. For example `some kind of files` are slow on `some kind of devices`. Which should help.\n\nSVG might be a solution, or we can just wait until devices become even faster.\n. @cdelgadob The method of removing pages would be up to the actual UI framework, so I haven't come up with a proper general example.\n\nI think a 3d transform in the outermost container would be enough, but I'm not sure. I guess you need to do some experiments.\n.

Sample5 fixed, it's actually a weird (but standard) pdf file, that all text are shown as clipped images.\n. For sample4, still it's about clipping, but have not found a solution so far. Will come back later.\n. I'm creating a new issue for Sample4, and closing this one.\n. by default all files will be generated in the 'current dir'\nyou may specify --dest-dir\n. according to the standard, it should have been in std::\n::hypot is not standard.\n\nI'll try to remove that function though\n. fixed in the master branch.\nplease have a try.\n. One possible solution is: text should be rendered as image when it's clipped, or further when there is an image object on top of it.\n. http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/masking/adobe/\n\nThe `clip-path` CSS property will be useful, even SVG paths are supported.\nHowever this property is not (well) supported by browsers (other than Firefox)\n. @jahewson \nYeah, I meant that property actually, both of them have been introduced in html5rocks link\n\nI've just taken a look at Crocdoc's output of the \"typeface\" PDF, not surprised by their solution.\n\nI'm about to work on this issue. You mentioned that you've been working on this one, what's the progress? We may support only rectangles for a start\n. Now I think that estimation in rectangles is fair, although I've been worried about the accuracy in other (rare) cases.\nSVG has to be involved in order to provide accurate clipping, but in that case, #116 should be the right thing to do.\n. A simple clipping (for rectangle) has been implemented in v0.8. Which should cover most cases.\n\nSVG path may be used for complicated paths, which is not a high-priority issue right now. So just wait for some one mentioning this.\n. It's an old known issue, and has been in the TODO list for quite well.\nCurrently printing is not of high priority, as you can also provide the original PDF for printing, e.g. Wikipedia.\n. Hmm, now I'm working on improving the background images, and there are quite a number of things to do after that. No guarantee on the speed, as I'm doing it in my spare time.\n\nYou may consider filing a [commision](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/FAQ#wiki-feature_commission) if you want it be done soon.\n. could you please send me an email (which can be found in the project home\npage)?\n\nOn Mon, Oct 15, 2012 at 11:02 PM, stanbellcom notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> that might be a possibility,\n> \n> now that you know the issue, you could perhaps tell me what would be an\n> estimate price to speed up this feature appearance?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/issues/40#issuecomment-9448114.\n. Yes, it should be about CSS, here are the things I'll need to do.\n\nTo calculate (separatedly) the metrics for printing, like height/width and\nfont sizes\nTo tweak the css for several elements, hide the visual effects\n\nThese should not be hard, but I'm investigating why the fonts are not\nworking, they should be.\n\nOn Fri, Oct 19, 2012 at 3:35 PM, Deepak notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Isn't adding css to \"print\" would solve this?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/issues/40#issuecomment-9592081.\n. @stanbellcom I guess you can store only the original PDF, and generate an temporary annotated PDF when a user request for printing. But probably would make your system more complicated.\n. According to my research on this, there are two major issues prevent it to be done\n- Firefox & Chrome do not print the pages with fonts introduced by @font-face\n- Paging cannot be controlled - the latest CSS standard is not supported by browsers right now, SVG might work for this.\n\nSo I guess this has to be done for quite a while.\n\nIf any one find a solution for this, please kindly tell me.\n. I have created a [Wiki page](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Printing) for this issues and updated the issue description.\n. @jahewson\nThanks for the info. \n\nSo before this can be solved with some future version of CSS or SVG, providing the original PDF is the best solution.\n. @purem, thanks for the info, but as also mentioned in that link, Firefox currenlty does not support this.\n.

Right, I'll do that.\n. I cannot reproduce it, there should already a newline character there.\nCould you please provide an affected PDF files?\n. I guess it's a bug of the browsers then, I remember that for div, a 'newline' should be appended by the browser.\n. @iapain  Let me try again.\n. @iapain I cannot reproduce it, e.g. `demo.pdf` which is one of the demo files of pdf2htmlEX. Can you please provide an example PDF? \n. @iapain Which browser are you using? \n. @iapain As we've discussed before, this has always been the behaviour of Chrome.\n\nFor Firefox 22, I've just tested on Windows and Linux (Ubuntu), If you select the text and paste them to a multi-line text editor, you will see the line breaks, but if you paste them to the location bar, the Linux version will consume all the line breaks, and the Windows version will convert them into whitespaces.\n\nSo I think it's how the location bar handles the line breaks, but the line breaks are there.\n\nCan you please verify this?\n. @iapain This is indeed an issues, and I'll reopen it. But I don't have a good solution right row. \n. @iapain Thanks! Maybe we can discuss about your solution before you implement it.\n. @iapain I think you can add a `<br>` there, but I'm not sure how you can git rid of the newline there.\n. @iapain We should never modify the content unless necessary. When you see a char `0xa`, which is supposed to be a char, it might be actually something else, due to the evil encodings of the fonts, which is exactly the reason that sometimes characters could be lost due to `--space-as-offset`.\n\nAlso in PDF file there are rarely actually line break characters, afaik, instead text are simply repositioned with a PDF instruction.\n. @iapain  No it didn't work. I've tested on Firefox and Chrome on Windows.\nI remembered that all whitespaces between tags are ignored in HTML.\n. There are dots right now, each dot indicates one page has been processed. Isn't that OK?\n. Ok then, I'll implement an easy one, but it might be changed in the future. You can always define your own 'protocol' as you wish.\n. done in the master branch.\n. Yes, it's not supported right now. One reason is that I've never seen one.\n\nI'll try to find a way to render it in HTML efficiently, not quite sure about this.\n. There is a CSS property called 'writing-mode', but seems not to work well on my browsers (Firefox, Chrome).\n\nIt would be too costy to place each single characters, so for now I'll make them rendered as images.\n. It's done, ugly but working. Please try the latest master branch.\n. What's the output of pkg-config --libs poppler\n\nAnd what's the content of /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/poppler.pc\n.

Hello, I've been busy with my own research for the past weeks, and just came back now.\n\nLike @iapain said, I think pdftohtml or pdftotext might be the best choice for you, for now. \n\nI'm not sure what you want CSS removed, because even those are gone, still you cannot edit the HTML file generated (easily).\n\nThings prevent easy editing include:\n- The space padding between words, because in many PDF there are spaces of variant lengths.\n- The lines are not reflowable, so if you change the length of a line, it will look ugly\n- Fonts, often only necessary glyphs are embedded in PDF files, so if you introduce new characters, they won't show up correctly\n  \n  And the solutions to each of them:\n- To remove the padding spaces with space characters, at the cost of alignment\n- Reflowable text, I've tried once, but it's not only an issue of position, but also things like spelling, e.g. sometimes the dash at the end of a line should be removed in order to connect with the next line\n- If the PDF file provides with a valid semantic encoding, you can easily substitute the font as you wish; otherwise I think you have to fix it manually.\n\nThe essential issue is that PDF has been designed for publishing, not editing.\n. I'm going to try to implement the first two soon, and the third one is 'automatically' if there's a valid encoding.\n. @404pnf Thanks for your explanation.\n\nConverting pdf to html with corresponding tags would be quite difficult and annoying for me to do, as a hobby. That'd be recognition rather than conversion.\n\nFor example\n\ntable: to recognize aligned columns, as well as borders\nli: not sure about this, maybe to recognize bullet?\nh1/h2... : several rules based on the position and font sizes\n\nTo me, maybe h1/h2 would be the most difficult thing to do, because I cannot make a formula that works for all the PDF, the rules should be adaptive and adjustable, which might lead to lots of more options. I guess Acrobat does it well because it has lots of samples, and years of adjustment.\n\nI remembered that pdftohtml can also export to xml, but didn't try it.\n\nFor now my concern is to output an html with reflowable and editable, making a small step towards structure-oriented html than visual-oriented.\n. Indeed, Acrobat should have been guessing, but with more confidence with their well tuned heuristics\n\nI'll implement unwarping lines, there have been a few people asking about editing the HTML, and publishers like @iapain also needs it. But it will be at the cost of losing some visual accuracy.\n\nAbout file size, PDF supports in-file compression, while HTML does not, so it's not fair. But you can enable deflate on your http server. If you gzip the HTML file, most of time the file size is comparable with the original PDF.\n\nComparing with PDF.js. pdf2htmlEX started as a toy, as an alternate to PDF.js when a friend of mine needed to display PDF online. The problem with PDF.js (for now) is the slowness, and text handling. The advantage of pdf2htmlEX is all conversion/optimization is done background on the servers, which is done only once, such that they are not imposed on the users -- but seems that PDF.js will do a server-side version.\n\nIn short, pdf2htmlEX is for publishers, and PDF.js is for viewers.\n\nThe purpose of pdf2htmlEX is to provide a choice, for those who intended to publish in HTML, but was forced to PDF because the lack of tools. Also HTML, together with CSS and Javascript, allows better integration with your web site (themes, links etc), and more creative works --  how about google analytics embedded in your CV online? \n\nIf you would like to help pdf2htmlEX, thank you and here are a few possibilities that you don't have to code.\n- Just use it and report bugs.\n- Credit it on your sites such that others would be aware of pdf2htmlEX\n- Make a small donation if there is a commercial organization behind -- I'd suggest you make a feature request meanwhile\n. I've been trying to create reflowable text, but thing is more complicated than I had thought of.\nI'll create a wiki page for this issue.\n. Created a new issues for it. #56\n. You might need to take a look at \n\nvoid HTMLRenderer::process(PDFDoc *doc)\n\nin general.cc.\n\nYou can disable text by removing a few lines there.\n. Not sure on Fedora, but on Ubuntu /usr/local precedes /usr in the searching path.\nWhat's the output of `pkg-config --libs poppler`? Maybe you need to set some environmental variables for pkg-config.\n\nAbout fontforge, the header files is found in /usr/include but libraries are in /usr/local, how could that happen? So you have two versions of fontforge installed?\n. I think you may need to prepend /usr/local in your system include paths,\nsuch that cmake will search at /usr/local/include first.\nmake sure there is /usr/local/include/fontforge/fontforge.h\n\nthen you should be ready to compile pdf2htmlEX.\n\nOn Thu, Nov 15, 2012 at 10:55 PM, True Merrill notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> Good questions.

Since you can still run pdf2htmlEX.\n. GlobalParams comes from poppler, so make sure you have it installed properly, especially when you have multiple versions installed.\n.

Hey thanks a lot for your effort!\nI'm going to examine and merge your changes soon.\n. I've made a pass about your modification. All make perfect sense except for HTMLDevice.\n\nI guess you make it 'more general', such that we can support similar formats, but it's more like the relationship between poppler and HTMLRenderer, where the former parses PDF files and the latter output necessary bits for the specific format.\n\nBesides, most functions and behaviours etc of HTMLRenderer was designed exactly for HTML/CSS, so I wonder what kind of other formats can be supported, maybe XML?\n. I don't know why you move LineBuffer::State outside, because it's not used outside the scope.\n\nI'm going to refactor the code, to split utill.cc, and create helper classes in order to make HTMLRenderer.h shorter and cleaner.\n. @filodej Actually you don't have to worry about the reverting, because I can carefully cherrypick the commits I need.\nAnd I'm actually working on the install/export functions, I will create classes for them in order to have them easily managed.\n. It's been manually merged.\nI'll try to refine and reorganize the code as there's finally someone reading it :)\n. I've cleaned the code a little bit today, and pushed them into the master\nbranch. Hope that this won't lead to bugs...\n\nI've also considered a dedicated class for manage the css classes, but not\nas easy as I have thought about... need more time.\n\nOn Thu, Nov 29, 2012 at 5:29 PM, filodej notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Thank you.

PDF and HTML are all used in wide variant situations, people have different needs. Just thinking about recognizing and showing messages about the collision of --fit-width and --fit-width-every is quite annoying to me. \n\nSo here is what I do:\n-  I've tagged this issue 'need vote', so hope that people support this parameter would leave comments here, to convince me that it is necessary. OR\n- You may hack it yourself and issue a pull request, and I will review the patch. Just make sure it won't confuse the users (with all other parameters)\n. It's not about the names of the parameters, but values. What should be done\nwhen people specify both parameters, and even different values?\n\nOn Mon, Dec 10, 2012 at 4:31 AM, Simanas notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> I agree the name is annoying to me to ... how about just one parameter\n> --zoom-every: [1/0] ?\n> And great idea to make a voting :) So my vote you alredy know [image:\n> :+1:]\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/issues/55#issuecomment-11175516.\n. What's the difference of --zoom when --zoom-every is set to 0 and 1?\n\nAnyway I'll need to make sure that this parameter is something worthy.\n. Closing it as we have #57 \n. @iapain, I remember that you have shown me a video for reflowing text in pdf, but I forgot the name. Could you please tell me?\n. As a start we may make some assumptions and start from the easiest case:\n\nNo header, footer, figure, table. And single column of text.\n\nThe task is to combine text lines in the same paragraph. We can further extend this to two-column layouts, as text rendering order is usually the same as reading order.\n\nSpacing might be a problem, I think it's hard to preserve the exact spacing (width of letter-space, word-space, space-char), need to relax and estimate them.\n\nThe process should be easy if facilitated with manual marking/adjustments.\n\nRef: http://scribdtech.wordpress.com/2012/02/29/why-zooming-on-mobile-is-broken-and-how-to-fix-it/\n\nAnother direction is to tag the PDF in some way, and to utilize tag information in PDF file.\n. Lots of useful information here:\nhttp://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/PDF\n. @alvisty Thanks for your information! \n\nIt seems to have been actively developed, and it looks promising. I'll check it out and see how it works.\n. I wouldn't say \"reflowing is achivevable\" based on these videos. For example in the first video, the page box is (or maybe has to be) provided by manually drawing it. The document seems to be well formed, single-column, the paragraphs are quite aligned (no item lists etc), and I didn't see any tables in the video.\n\nBut I do believe that it's doable with some assumptions on the document type and format. \n\nThe OCR example is indeed amazing, but I couldn't try my own files due to maintenance. \n. @iapain k2pdfopt seems to be image based, I'll try to read more of its code later. For now I'll try to create a new text model for the reflowable text in the future. The new model will be somewhat like Crocodoc's, which consists of  text groups with relative positioned text lines.\n. Thanks for your effort. I'm reviewing the commit.\nStill I think it should be part of a PDF manipulating tool, how about the feature to reorder the pages?\n\nCan you provide with the PDF you mentioned, with different sizes of each page? (but you want them equal)\n. Yeah I believe they exist, but I've never seen one. I just want to know why the sizes are different while they should have been.\n. So if a few pages are in the wrong direction, why would you fix it by zooming instead of rotating?\n. I mean the zoom function can be done in HTML with JS, which is consistent\nwith other PDF viewer.\n\nAlso I just realized that, different zoom factors for different pages would\nhurt the JS code, you may also need to fix that.\n\nOn Thu, Dec 13, 2012 at 8:03 PM, Simanas notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Because in real life it is meant to be read in landscape mode, while the\n> others in portrait, therefore an author of pdf file had flipped these pages\n> 90 degrees so you don't have to rotate your computer screen, while trying\n> to read such a page of a report via adobe acrobat reader.\n> \n> But this is not the only case...

There's no option to make all of them a same width.\n. @Simanas Please relax, I appreciate your efforts, but I just don't think \"to convert a html document with exactly 960px in width, from a pdf file contains pages with different widths\" is a common feature that should be included.\n\nI need more evidence about this, and that's why I've left it open and marked it as 'need vote' instead of just closing it.\n\nPlease keep in mind that I'm the author & maintainer, once this feature is included, it has to be \"maintained\". Suppose another people really wants all odd pages rotated CW and even pages rotated CCW, do you think it should be included in pdf2htmlEX ? I've actually created special features for a few people, for different purposes, but I never merged them into master.\n\nAlso note that there is no 2nd people supports this request till now, despite of the 'need vote' label. \n\nAs I said earlier, I'm waiting for more evidences. Testimonies, similar features in other PDF CONVERSION tools etc.\n. @Simanas, When I'm stuck at some missing options of some software, I modify it myself.\nWhen I submit the patch but rejected by the author, I know that it's my personal need, and I'm still happy with my fork.\n. According to your definition, it is a PDF viewer (from the HTML point of\nview). By to mine, it's conversion of format, which does not MODIFY the\nPDF.\n\nWhen you mean \"convert to your needs\", I say it's MANIPULATION, because it\nchanges PDF.\n\nYou may check out PDFtk, probably the best in your case.\n\nOn Tue, Jan 29, 2013 at 9:38 PM, Simanas notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> So please tell me is this piece of software is aimed to serve as a pdf\n> VIEWER or is it aimed to be a CONVERTER, because all your args are from\n> series: \"Usual pdf viewers do not have such a functionality, therefore...\"\n> \n> If it is only a VIEWER, than please apologize me, I was to emotional.

You don't want to see anything changed if you convert a PNG to a JPEG, do you? \n\nEarlier I've tried to make text reflowable, which might be something like what you meant about \"representation of the content\", or \"True HTML\". But [this link](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Reflowable-Text) shows the difficulties I encountered. I will do that once I find a solution some day. I still want to optimize for HTML without breaking visual accuracy.\n\nI'm the one who is responsible for the quality of pdf2htmlEX, so I'm now playing the AUTHOR card. As written in README, accurate rendering is the #1 concern of pdf2htmlEX. And according to your definitions, pdf2htmlEX is absolutely a PDF viewer.\n\n@Simanas, still I appreciate your efforts, including the patch and all argument here. I believe that it's useful for you and some other people, but _right now_ I don't think it's the right feature for pdf2htmlEX. Anyone can possibly change/consolidate my mind by showing:\n- Agreement/disagreement with this feature\n- Existence/absence of similar functions in other PDF conversion tools\n\nI will still leave it open for a few months, but might not always response to all messages\n.

You got the point.\n\nYes, for Linux and Mac, they use freetype or something similar, such that\nfonts on screen look like the same as printed on papers - thanks to Apple\nBut Windows, with ClearType, focuses on \"readable\".\n\nI think the fonts in PDF standards are similar with Linux/Mac, because I\ncan't quite tell the difference (visually) between a PDF file and a\nconverted HTML.\nIt should be so since PDF is a format for printing.\n\nAFAIK Adobe Reader on Windows should render all fonts by itself, but web\nbrowsers will call Windows API for this, by default the effect could be\nvery bad since most embedded fonts (in PDF) are lack of proper hinting --\nthe PDF viewer is supposed to handle this.\n\nttfautohint may add some hinting with freetype, which is currently the best\nsolution I have found.\nI guess the --external-hint-tool is flexible enough for you, you just feed\na executable or script to it, and don't even need --single-html.\n\nIf you find a better solution, please tell me.\n\nOn Tue, Jan 8, 2013 at 1:26 PM, sudesh-poojari notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> [image: eng]https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/3097644/49325/556dfd2c-5953-11e2-9f2f-cf98a01fc5cf.jpg\n> [image: noneng]https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/3097644/49326/5595f412-5953-11e2-8a0d-d0a2377d01d0.jpg\n> \n> Attached is images how the non english pdf looks in windows7 and how\n> english pdf looks in windows 7 across browsers.\n> \n> I tried everything, seems to be something with how these browsers render\n> fonts in windows 7.\n> \n> Mac looks completely fine.\n> \n> Tried lot of css tricks, but those tricks cannot be applied to whole pdf\n> (depending on font weight and other stuff)\n> \n> thanks a lot for your help for guiding me, I m not giving up yet may be\n> look at some other way to overcome\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/issues/60#issuecomment-11985216.\n.

Just inspected the file, this should be issue #39 \n. The reason is that there is some distance between the letters. The distance is not literally a space ' ', just a positional shift.\n\nIt's a known issue, I cannot add a space there since otherwise if you copy & paste the text, you will see an extra space. \n\nThere are only 2 possible workarounds\n- specify a larger value for \"--heps\" might help, which would hurt accuracy however\n- handle selection with Javascript, say you recognize the selected part and draw a rectangle there -- which is beyond the scope of pdf2htmlEX\n\nIf you have better solutions, please tell me.\n\nMarked this issue as \"need solution\"\n.

At this point, Chrome would consider the selection ends to the beginning -- might be valid in some sense?\n\nIt might be solved with JavaScript, I guess. But I doubt if it will be worth it. \n. I think you only need to remove CMakeCache.txt\n. Confirmed and working on it.\n. This pdf first displays the text, then the scanned image on top of the text. Such that the real text are covered, invisible, but still selectable.\n\npdf2htmlEX currently cannot detects this, it always tries to grab all text and put them on the top text layer.\n\nI'll try to find a workaround for this.\n. Is it true (or very common) that, for scanned pdf files, all text are hidden or covered by the scanned image.\nIf so I may add an option like 'hide-text' for a workaround.\n\nEDIT: I mean you can actually add more text there, above the images, with any PDF manipulation tool. So --hide-text may break the PDF again. But it's OK if this is not common.\n. No, in our case, one is text, the other is on image, so they are not\n`duplicate`\n\nOn Sat, Feb 2, 2013 at 11:23 PM, John Hewson notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> It's relatively common, but was a poor decision on the part of the OCR\n> program - it should have used hidden text rather than just placing an image\n> over the text.

Yes, the current design of pdf2htmlEX maybe too naive, maybe these will fix it somewhat\n- detect and hide all text completely covered by images\n- detect and hide all text partially covered, and add a hidden text layer\n\nbut it might be slow and ugly..\n\nbtw, can I have that PDF for debugging?\n.

Usually this would increase the output size, but not for scanned PDFs. So please give it a try.\n. @duanyao Cool!\nI'm a little bit worried about the performance, you might want to take a look at rtree in boost. Or you can leave the interface flexible such that I can fix it later.\nAnd It might not be a good idea to create a separate `char_covere` array, would make it more difficult to optimized in the future. Currently it's similar as in PDF, where we record text and state changes. But it's not elegant either. Probably I need to make it an array and storing the state for each character.\n. I think you can keep `chars_covered` for now, as probably I don't have time to rework the data structure. I wonder if `std::vector<char>` would be better, because I remember that `std::vector<bool>` will use `bitset` for saving memory, but rather slow.\n\nCan you create a separate class for the hittest? I don't want everything inside `HTMLRenderer`. Besides, it will be easier to adapt to other data structures.\n\nRtree should give an average time of O(n logm), and O(n sqrt(m)) at least. 0.2s is not fast, as I see sites using pdf2htmlEX to convert thousands of PDF, or a single file containing thousands of pages. But other the other hand, font & image processing may be even slower, so this may not be the bottleneck.\n\nCan you create an option for this? This is experimental right now. Somebody might prefer performance.\n. @duanyao Probably you could create a PR when you think it's ready, and it'll be a better place to discuss. Thanks!\n. I'm closing this issue as there's already an implementation for this.\nPlease create new issue with sample files if it's not working well.\n. fixed in master branch\n. The fact should be all non-type3 fonts are below than they should be, as type3 fonts are rendered as images.\n\nCan you try zoom in and out for a little bit and see if they come to the right position, or even more higher? If so, the position depends on the zoom ratio and the browser behavior.\n. Could you please provide the converted HTML file? As I cannot reproduce it myself.\nIf possible, please convert only 1 page that is affected.\n. I found the reason.\n\nThat part of non-Type3 font is one of the default 14 fonts in PDF, which are not embedded and should be provided by the pdf viewer.\n\nBy default I'll translate them to proper font names, and the final result will depend on the environment of the viewer's browser, which is \"undefined\" theoretically, but should be fine most of the time.\n\nYou can force embedding fonts chosen by poppler, by specifying --embed-base-font 1, which would increase the size of HTML file. \n\nPlease give a try and see if it helps.\n. duplicate of #39 \nyeah, you are right, I'll try to fix this part.\n. A quick hack is to remove pdf2htmlEXl.js from the manifest.\nIf you still need part of its functions, you can disable pre_hide_pages and schedule_render\n.

Um sorry for the confusing, I meant it's possible to specify the format, but not implemented yet.\n. duplicate of #56 \n. It's not about identifying. pdf2htmlEX is a converter, which converts everything shown in a page. And it does not understand which part is for what purpose.\n\nWhat you are looking for should be a PDF manipulating tool, not a conversion tool.\n. Merged.\n\nThanks!\n. I'm not sure about Travis, what is it for? Why do I need it?\n. OK, Thanks for the explanation. I'll try it.\n. Merged & Thanks\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks a lot for the efforts. \n\nI've received many complains about it, and I've been thinking it for a long time, but I've got no elegant solution.\n\nBesides the inline comments, here are a few concerns about it.\n- About the prefix --dont, or verbs with opposite meanings:\n  - It's hard to memorize, unless you support the prefix for all flags, like --enable/disable or --with/without in autoconf.It will be a little bit more confusing while reading the default values, especially squeeze_wide_glyph vs dont_shrink_wide_glyph\n  - It's annoying to change the default value, and there might be compatible problems. For example, when I first implemented auto-hint, it's not mature enough and is turned off by default; but later it can be enabled by default, I have to change it to --dont-auto-hint, and all scripts for older versions of pdf2htmlEX will be invalid.\n  - There are no such problems with the 0/1 solution, neither for --enable/disable or --with/without as in autoconf\n- Coding \n  - I want the parameters names the same as in the struct Param, \n  - Also the orders in Param.h, pdf2htmlEX.cc and manpage should be the same, for easier maintenance.\n  - With the lambda hack, how do you make the sure the default values are 0? I don't see an initialization\n  - And when you use the lambda hack so often, there should be a new feature in ArgParser.\n\nI've thought a default configuration file, written in unix conf style, or JSON. Users can modify it, or specify command line arguments to override them. But it's too complicated and I'm not well motivated.\n\nMaybe we can discuss about the solution before you going on.\n. Just realized that your old lambda hack cannot handle the default values.\n\nThe 0 in ArgParser::add will have no effect, as ArgParser has no idea what your lambda will do.\n.  ArgParser & ArgParser::add(const char \\* optname, const char \\* description, ArgParserCallBack callback)\n{\n    return add<char>(optname, nullptr, 0, description, callback, true);\n}\n\nlocation is nullptr\n. Thanks a lot for the efforts!\n\nThe old `--option-name <arg> (=default) description` came from the boost options library. In the beginning I used boost::options, but later implemented my own ArgParser because I heard complains about the dependency of Boost.\n\nNow it becomes --option-name <arg> description (default is xx), to me, the default value near <arg> looks more convenient.

Great.\nThanks a lot !\n. How about new font types, e.g. svgz -- maybe a mapping file will help, but the mapping is not 1-to-1. OpenType Fonts may have suffixes .otf, .ttf or .ttc\n\nFor .ttf, google chrome will behave differently when you specify truetype and opentype.

I just broke the text stroke simulation in Firefox, in order to \"show\" hidden text in HTML (render==3).\nThis will be useful for scanned PDF files, where there is a hidden text layer above the scanned image.\n. The naming can be seen in HTMLRenderer.h. And I'm actually changing it.\n\nYou can actually set a larger value for --heps, many elements should have been merged automatically\n. For rounding, you can also change the round() function in pdf2htmlEX\n. I don't use Windows (for programming). But I've tested pdf2htmlEX on Cygwin.

Please run with `--debug 1` and provide the output.\n. Sorry, never mind about `--debug 1`.\n\nSeems that the fontforge you are using is from pdf2htmlEX PPA but not the default one provided in Ubuntu repo. Indeed I have not updated it for a while, not sure if that is the problem.\n. @idledk Is it possible for you to update your fontforge?\n\nMeanwhile I will add some debug code to collect more info from your environment.\n. could you please try the `debug` branch, and show me the output\n. I see, indeed the values dumped are quite different from what I got.\n\nSeems that Fontforge cannot read the values correctly, they are all default values (for _, win, typo & hhead)\n. Are you using 32bit or 64bit machine ?\n. hmm.. please try this\n\nrun with `pdf2htmlEX --clean-tmp 0 xxx.pdf`, then in `/tmp/pdf2htmlEX-****`, you will find `f2.cff` and `f2.ttf`.\n\nPlease send me these 2 files.\n. @jahewson so it's still something changed in pdf2htmlEX. But I've got no clues right now.\n. Thanks for the files, let me see what I can get from them.\nUsually we use Dropbox or other public links for sharing files.\n. @idledk seems that somehow fontforge changed em size on your machine.\nCould you please try the latest `debug` branch again? I've added more info.\n. In your log, right after the line `font 1 1.974 -0.42`, there is a `raw em size 1000`. This info is about font f2, which should be retrieved from the raw font dumped from the PDF, i.e. the f2.cff you sent to me. \n\nThis value should be 2048, and the fontforge on my machine reports the correct value from your f2.cff. Also this means that poppler and pdf2htmlEX worked well on your machine.\n\nSo I think that there's something wrong with the Fontforge on your machine.\n\nTo verify this, please open the `f2.cff` with Fontforge, then through the menu:\n\n`Element -> Font Info -> General`, you should see `Ascent 1638; Descent 410; Em Size 2048`, but I guess you will see `800 200 1000`. If it's 1000 indeed, maybe it's a bug of fontforge or some weird & mysterious configuration (compiling flags/libs). \n\nIn a few days, I'll set up a clean ubuntu 12.04 and try to reproduce it.\n\n@jahewson could you please also verify the value 2048?\n. @idledk  Cannot reproduce it in a clean Lubuntu 12.04, the default fontforge shows the correct value...\nI suspect that there are something special in your environment, for example misconfigured env variables, linked libraries etc. Do you have any clues about it? How much difference is your environment from a fresh install?\n. I don't think it's about gs fonts, since the problem now is that\n\"fontforge cannot parse a cff font correctly\".\nI suspect that it's about locale, env variable, libraries or something, but\nI don't have any clue right now...\n\nOn Thu, Feb 28, 2013 at 5:04 PM, idledk notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Hmm, well, must be my installation.

But I guess a relative positioning is necessary.\n. As I have checked, you can remove `position:absolute` at any time as long as you change other codes to maintain the UI.\n\nI've added more comments in the `base.css`, actually most CSS are free to modify. \n. I'll write a wiki page about the default css and js\n. `position:fixed` and `$window` do not make sense to me. It prevents people embedding documents in a small fraction of their web pages.\n\nBut indeed currently it's not easy to show the document in `window`.\n. Visibility of pages are determined by the difference between offsets of\nthat page element and the PDF container element (#pdf-main).\n\nOffsets are relative to `document`, and jQuery does not require any\n`position` properties. So maybe `position:absolute` can be removed.\n\nI'll try it in a few days.\n\nOn Wed, Feb 20, 2013 at 4:22 PM, Deepak notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> $(window) should automatically handle frameset.

I've tested the code, the layout works, but it breaks the js code which determines the visibility of the pages.\n\n`position:absolute` is not necessary, `.offset()` in jQuery always works.\n\nThe lazy page loading code is broken, because now there is no limit on the height of the pdf container. \n\nBut overall, I think `position:fixed` and the usage of `$(window)` reduce the usability, so I'm closing this pull request.\n\nEDIT: page visibility test is not broken, but since the container is tall enough, the pages are always `visible`\n. I won't be available for the next few days, so please allow a few more days for the diagnose.\n. try with the parameter `--squeeze-wide-glyphs 0`\n\nThis parameter is useful when the glyph widths declared in PDF are not the same as in the embedded font, or as in the local matched font.\n\nI'll consider if this should be turned on by default.\n. This issue has nothing to do with space-threshold. It's about font manipulation. If you copy the text out, you should not be able to see extra spaces inserted.\n\nAnd to me, absolute positioning is much more than \"occasional\". I did not hear any complaints about `space-threshold`, so I believe the default value works for most PDF files.\n. This PDF is kind of special, the reason you need to turn off\n`squeeze-wide-glyph` is that the letter \"M\" is much narrower than it looks\nlike. If you select the word in the HTML, you may notice the thin highlight\nbox under \"M\".\n\nThe thin value is the actual width in the font, so if you actually write\n\"Man\" with this font, you will see overlapping between M and a. There is no\noverlapping in this PDF because there is position shift between M and a, or\na is absolute positioned. So logically, there is a quite wide gap there,\nand inserting a space there is \"logically\" correct.\n\nOn the other hand, I cannot simply measure the gap between the actually\nbounding boxes between glyphs, for example the letter 'Q' in the demo page\nof pdf2htmlEX named \"Typography\".\n\nI've just tested this PDF in Adobe Reader X, and I got \"M nagement\" copying\nthat word out.\n. More info, the width of a glyph is how much you should shift the current\nposition horizontally before you can put the next glyph. And bounding box\nis the actual size of the painted area of that glyph.\n\nOn Fri, Feb 22, 2013 at 9:13 PM, \u738b\u7490 coolwanglu@gmail.com wrote:\n\n> This PDF is kind of special, the reason you need to turn off\n> `squeeze-wide-glyph` is that the letter \"M\" is much narrower than it looks\n> like.

The width of  'M' in the font is half as it looks like. Suppose 'M' looks\nlike 2mm width, and 'a' is 1mm width.\nSo for the word \"Management\", from the font renderer's point of view,\nthey're 1cm 'M' + 1cm gap + 1cm 'a'. And it should be OK if we insert a\nspace there.\n\nA larger space-threshold should eat up this space, by design, but also eats\nup all other spaces equal or less than this width, so other parts of the\ndocument might be affected.\n\nThe main problem is the bad info in the embedded font in this PDF.\n\nIn my previous comment (which didn't show up correctly on github), I said \"\nOn the other hand, I cannot simply measure the gap between the actually\nbounding boxes between glyphs, for example the letter 'Q' in the demo page\nof pdf2htmlEX named \"Typography\".\n\nI've just tested this PDF in Adobe Reader X, and I got \"M nagement\" copying\nthat word out.\n\"\n\nSo hope this makes sense to you.\n\nOn Fri, Feb 22, 2013 at 10:23 PM, arski notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Darn.. kind of stupid considering that these PDFs are generated from real\n> text documents of some sort and now you have to reverse-engineer some\n> stupid spaces..\n> \n> Why isn't it possible to measure the gaps then?

In PDF, glyphs are positioned by the origin, so the ascent/descent info in embedded fonts are not useful.\n\nBut in HTML, all positioning rely on ascent/descent, so here I retrieve the actual value (instead of the values from the meta data of the embedded fonts in PDF) with Fontforge.\n\nThere are 3 sets of ascent/descent (win, os2, typo).

Thanks for the patch. \n\nThere might be a security problem if we release too much freedom here, for example '%n'.\nSo in order to support this, I think we need to limit to a few modifiers, and list all of them in the documentation.\nAlso we need to check the format specified by the user, in order to prevent unexpected situations or stack overflow attacks.\n. I've checked the source code of gnuplot, which support customized format for input data, they indeed check and limit the the user-specified format.\n. Thank you for your hard work!

There are too many pages for it. I've just checked `pdftohtml` from poppler, which is able to process the same file very fast. I'll try to find the cause.\n\nOne possible solution is to use multiple threads, since rendering background image of each page is independent to each other. And fortunately, poppler has just become thread-safe since a recent version.\n\nVisibility test, indeed, even harder than #39 where we may simply estimate the clipping path as a rectangle. I've been thinking about this, but no good idea so far. Maybe we may estimate each object by its bounding box, and test the visibility in the preprocessor.\n\nAbout cutting the background image. That should be intuitive and useful, how did you do that?\n\nActually I've tried to dump every image object in PDF and put them directly into HTML. But it did not work due to clipping paths, also there may be other drawing objects.  I also tried to at least detect \"if there is anything on the background\", (there is a bg_integrate branch, which has not been maintained for a while), which did not work well either, since a simple header/footer will make the background nonempty.\n\nIn the bg_integrated path, I also attempted to employ SVG for the visibility issue, but it turned out to be too complicated to me. Crocdoc seems to support render in SVG now, I  never succeeded in viewing them though, they always froze my browsers.\n. @iclems  My email is available in README\n. @jahewson  I wonder if per-path images would introduce too many overhead. For example, why people use CSS sprites? I think maybe we need some clustering algorithms.\n\nAbout polygon clipper, do you know any light-weight geometry libraries, for example CGAL?\n\nAbout image objects can also be clipped, and thus cannot be directly dumped and inserted to HTML.\n. Looks great, but seems that bezier curves are not supported.\n\nBezier curves might be used in cilpping paths, drawing objects. \n\nhmm..\n. @iclems \nFuther tests suggest that pdftohtml was not so fast.\n\nPreviously I was not using the `-c` parameter, such that images are not processed `carefully`\nWith the `-c` paramter, the speed of pdftohtml is similar as pdf2thmlEX (with the same scaling)\n\nI guess this is the best poppler can do (with current parameters)\n. Just realized that #64 is about visibility test\n. The first item seems not to be able to bring performance improvements. Probably the only good thing about it is that it would possibly prevent vertical overlapping caused by rounded font sizes by the browsers, which never happened to me.\n\nI've created HTMLTextPage which allows future optimizations, but the rest part seems to be dull to me.\n\nThe last 2 items have been implemented and indeed improve the performance.\n. I think you can build it as long as you can build poppler & fontforge. \nYou may file new issues if you cannot compile it for ARM.\n. What do you mean by fitting, is `--fit-width` what you want?\n. None is provided by pdf2htmlEX.\nThe first one is about recognition rather than conversion.\nThe second one is a UI feature, you may implement with a few lines of JS.\n. No, IE <= 9 is not supported due to the lack of CSS3 support.\n. https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Browser-Requirements\n. I've disabled a recent added function. \nI can confirm missing links (p8) and wrong letter space for vertical text (p12)\nI also observe a number of \"boxes\" what are supposed to be invisible.\n. @PunkBuster Is it possible for you to tell me the password, or provide me with an decrypted version? I need to inspect the links, which are not typical annotation links.\n. I think I've fixed the format problem, it's about the line merging procedure, which has been very wrong...\nPlease try the lastest master branch.\n\nI'm going to deal with the blank boxes.\n. @jahewson The missing links seem to be Widget Annotations. Maybe support it in the future\n. @PunkBuster Actually I didn't solve the overlapping text. There are two parts\n- Text with clipping path, as john mentioned, duplicated of #39 \n- Text covered by images, similar as #39 but harder.\n\nBut other problems should have been fixed. Please reopen the issue if the problem still exists.\n. Thanks for reporting.\n\nYes, please provide a sample PDF file.\n\nI'm not sure if it'll be easy to \"physically\" remove them, that parameter actually just triggers a switch of a poppler API.\n. I see. I didn't find an easy way, and this issue can be viewed as a simple case of #39. So marked as duplicated.\n. There are \"hdpi\" and \"vdpi\" available. \n\nIf you mean \"native\" resolution, since all Type 3 fonts and drawing are printed also printed on the background, technically there is no \"native\" resolution.\n.

While reading the code, I kept thinking, it might be easier to use `clip` CSS properties, than detecting inside-or-out ourselves. Further, if we will support all kinds of paths in the future, we can export the path into SVG and use `clip-path`, without doing the complicated job of handling the paths.\n\nAnd to export the rectangles, we just need the values from getClipBBox and the current transform matrix, it would be much easier than the careful jobs done in this pull request.\n\nWhat do you think?\n. Since getClipBBox is in device coordinate system, even current matrix is not relevant...\n. - `GfxState` already provides clip x/y min/max in user space\n- Translating into user space would bring more error in the estimation\n- Actually I don't need coordinates in user-space, the HTML file is in the device space, so probably the format will be\n\n``` html\n<div clip=\"...\">\n<div>text line 1</div>\n<div>text line 2</div>\n</div>\n<!-- clip bbox changed -->\n<div clip=\"...\">\n<div>text line 1</div>\n<div>text line 2</div>\n</div>\n```\n- For each line, if I want to add the `clip` property, I will need to translate the clip-bbox into text-space, not user-space\n. yes, clip is evaluated before transform.\nbut in my example, I created outter div elements for clipping, and\ntransform are applied on inner div elements.\n\nOn Monday, April 8, 2013, John Hewson wrote:\n\n> Yeah that could work, I thought divs were transformed though?

Please reopen with more info\n. I've taken a look at the code of pdftocairo, the output is a multi-page SVG, which is not quite suitable for HTML. I have to make it an svg image per page. I even failed to that since pdftocairo supports a number of formats, and the code was kind of a mess.\n\nI will give it another try will I have time again, but now I know that it is not trivial.\n. @iclems `poppler_page_for_printing` is just a simple wrapper of the `CairoOutputDev` interfaces. In order to remove the text, I guess we still need to work on `CairoOutputDev`, like what I did with `SplashOutputDev`. \n\nBut a problem is that this interface use its won Font embedding and text placement systems, but ideally we want it the same way as in HTML, more precisely, use `@font-face` and CSS to specify fonts. And I don't know how to do that.\n\nThere is a pretty old branch called `bg_integrate`, which saves my early attempt, you may want to take a quick glance, but the code was a mess.\n\nYou are very welcome to do it now, as I've marked this issue as `future`, which means I don't expect enough time working on this in a near future.\n\nThanks.\n. A (very) experimental implementation of SVG support is in the `svg` branch, which can be turned on with `-DENABLE_SVG=ON` cmake option. It disables the old png backend automatically.\n. Now the format can be specified at run time.\nI guess this issue can be closed now.\n. Can you provide a sample PDF?\n\nUsually (unless it is a bug) pdf2htmlEX never duplicates fonts. So the reason you got too many fonts should be that there _are_ actually those _different_ fonts in the PDF. Here different fonts means different objects in PDF, which have different IDs.\n\nAnd pdf2htmlEX (so far) does not detect duplicated fonts by the shape of glyphs.\n. I found that there are font comparison functions in Fontforge. So theoretically duplicated fonts can be detected and merged. But it might be quite slow.\n\nPlease provide a sample PDF for debugging.\n\nAs this is not a critical  issue right now, please do not expect that it will be fixed soon.\n. Done. Please remove it.\n\nThanks!\n. For an embedded font, how do you know if it is 'common' or not?\n\nOn Tue, May 7, 2013 at 10:06 PM, fmalina notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> For common fonts, such as Verdana, Arial, Georgia etc., is is possible to\n> skip embedding entirely and just write css such as font-family: verdana,\n> sans-serif?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/issues/117#issuecomment-17544080\n> .\n. Sometimes yes. If you have installed poppler, there is a command `pdffonts` available. The first column shows the names.\n\nThe names are not reliable. The accuracy of the HTML depends on the metrics of the glyphs and the encoding of the font. There may be two sets of metrics stored in a PDF, one is defined in the embedded font, and the other stored in the font descriptor in PDF. When they are not consistent, the second one should be used, which means the font have to be transformed -- which can not be done by the browser.\n\nEncoding, if you expect a good font at the client side, the text must be encoded in Unicode correctly, which is not reliable either -- there are too many PDF files whose text cannot be copied out correctly.\n\nSince PDF is not designed for Web, actually I don't see these fonts often used in PDF (except for Times), at least in my test cases. You may verify this use `pdffonts`.\n\nSo my point is that it might be worth it to do so. But later I may export the embedded names in CSS, such that you may do post-procssing if you wan. And this should be done carefully since malicious code could be injected in this way.\n. Well, actuall the bold variant is a new font, Usually a bold font is not\njust the regular font with wider strokes, since lots of tuning would be\nnecessary. Although it is possbile to simulate that by setting\n`font-weight` in CSS, I don't want to do the recognition here.\n\nDuplicated fonts, actually, is what a PDF generator should concern, not\nthis converter. But I will try to make it smarter if a local font is\nmatched for multiple external fonts in PDF.\n\nOn Wednesday, May 8, 2013, drinkupper wrote:\n\n> I admire the depth of your knowledge on the subject.\n> Having a font name, available at least as a clue would be valuable for\n> post processing.

My thought about this issue is that the fonts are not introduced by pdf2htmlEX, they have been there in the PDF file. So probably you are looking for a PDF optimization tool. \n\npdf2htmlEX is meant to be a conversion tool, so if there are multiple fonts in the PDF file, there should also be in the HTML output. \n\nImagine a JPG->PNG tool, you don't expect it will retouch the images for you, do you?\n. Please refer to https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Unfeatures for an explanation of what pdf2htmlEX does not do. Sorry for having lasting this so long.\n. @Toneti777  That's actually what I mean, if you can do that with a PDF optimizer, you should do it. While pdf2htmlEX is focused only on conversion. \n\nYou can always optimize the PDF file before feed it into pdf2htmlEX.\n. @Toneti777 And please remove the links, if necessary I might ask you for some smaller examples. Thanks.\n. OK, that sounds like a bug of pdf2htmlEX. Is it possible for you to provide a smaller file?\n. Hi @Toneti777 , I have checked both lne and lne_opt, according to the `pdffonts` command, they have exactly the same (132) fonts embedded. \n\nWhat kind of optimizations did you apply?\n. @Toneti777 Yes, I see that in Adobe Reader. Let me check if this is something defined in the PDF standard, or some trick done by the reader.\n. @Toneti777 Seems that there is only one font \u201cstored\", other fonts refer to the same binary with different encodings. This can be done in PDF but unfortunately I don't find a counterpart in HTML. Currently I have to store separated, reencoded fonts in HTML.\n\nOn the other hand, such fonts might be merged into one if their encodings are same. But this should be out of scope of pdf2htmlEX.\n. @Toneti777 Yes, you points make sense, this is indeed something extra created by pdf2htmlEX, so I'm opening it.\n\nBut right now I don't have a good solution for it. I'll think about it.\n. @Toneti777 Unfortunately I have not found the solution yet. I'm not sure if this happens for only specific PDF files or a number of them.\n\nAlso there doesn't seems to be others suffering from this issue, which keeps this issue at a low priority. Maybe you can consider sponsor this issue and see if any one else would like to solve it. \n. @mickgiles I've updated the issue description. The comparison part is more like a PDF optimization job. The one concerned here is about encodings.\n. @mickgiles Please first check (with `pdffonts`) if there are actually many fonts in the PDF, otherwise it may be the linking case here. \nThere is a tool called `sfddiff` in fontforge, not sure if that will work for you. Also you might try to write Fontforge scripts with python or its native syntax.\nhttp://fontforge.org/scripting-tutorial.html\nhttp://fontforge.org/python.html\n. @duanyao Yes indeed, that should be optimized without much difficulties.\n\nBut sometimes I would hesitate about these features. Do you think that there should be a PDF optimizer for this, or this feature should be integrated into a converter?\n. @duanyao Thanks for your input!\n. [Wiki page] added. \nI wonder if @Toneti777 could verify it works for the original issue. \n. Yes, it's a bug of FontForge.\nI guess you should probably make more comments there such that more attentions could be drawn.\nCurrently maybe you can use the 'tmp' branch of my Fontforge fork, but there is no guarantee...\n. @oknoorap As I've mentioned above, please use my fork of fontforge right now. I'll also update README later.\n. Please post the result of `git branch`\n. As mentioned in the message, you should install `gettext` which provides the `msgfmt` command\n. Installation of what?\n\nBtw, if you are using Ubuntu, you can install Fontforge from my PPA, which you can found in the 'Download' wiki page.\n. OK great :)\n. @easytag please post the following things\n\noutput of `git branch`\nthe first few lines of the output of `git log`\nthe `config.log` file\n. @easytag seems that it's about collab\nplease try `./configure --without-libzmq --without-x --without-iconv --disable-python-scripting --disable-python-extension`\n. OK, I'll add something like `--printing 0/1`\n. If you only want to reduce the file size, actually I just found that using `rem` in CSS might be a good idea.\n. Done.\n. The problem is that the PDF file refer to external fonts, whose info in unavailable in PDF.\nTry the `--embed-external-font` parameter\n. Yes, I saw the crash too. It should be something wrong in Fontforge.\nFor now, please use `--remove-unused-glyph 0`\n. @ankit042 I've found that the problematic font cannot be parsed by FontForge correctly. It complained about `/BaseFontname`.\n\nI'm not sure about the syntax, but seems that the font is derived from another font, which cannot be located by FontForge. I'll check the PDF spec again.\n. .page is not a standalone HTML file, it contains just necessary DOM elements, which is for dynamic page loading.\n\nPlease read the manpage about parameters for specifying pages and width.\n. I will update it soon. Since PPA is for people who do not want to compile the source, usually I upload only stable versions. \n. I noticed this issue before, it should be something wrong with Fontforge.\nTry the parameter `--remove-unused-glyph 0`\n. Oops, sorry about that.\n. Please allow a few days before I will have time to diagnose this issue.\n. Which version of FontForge are you using?\n. @SapraJI  I cannot reproduce crash with your pdf, please specify your OS environment, and the output of `pdf2htmlEX -v`\n. @SapraJI @ankit042 Oh I can reproduce it now.  which was about `--split-pages`. Not sure if this is the issue you have seen. Could you please try the latest git version?\n. @SapraJI Oh that was a subtle bug due to my ugly design. The memory was not correctly handled while building the file names for splitted pages.\n. @ankit042 It seems to be about space or text optimization. I'll create a separate issue for it.\nAbout speed, yes, it has been a long issue, the slowest parts are font processing and background image generation.\n\nFont processing is done with FontForge, whose code is quite a mess to me, and I don't believe it is thread safe. Maybe I will be able to speed it up by using multiple processes.\n\nAbout background image generation, I've started to investigate, seems that it is possible, since poppler has just become thread-safe.\n\nBut anyway speed is not as important as accuracy and stability to me, I think I'll focus on crashing and inaccuracy bugs first.\n. What is the full message? The message should have the content of the line printed out.\n. Hmm, so it looks like an empty line. Can you please post your manifest file? The file should be locate data-dir, try `pdf2htmlEX -v`\n\nAnd did pdf2htmlEX produce a good HTML output?\n. @dpfranklin Hmm, I cannot produce it. But I guess it's about white spaces.\nI've add line numbers in the error log, and the spaces are now be trimmed for each line. \n\nCan you please try the latest git version, and see if the message is still there?\n. OK, I'm closing it.\n. @anurag29  use `--single-html 0`?\n\nBut in that case no file will be embedded. Do you want only base.css while others still being embedded?\n. OK, I think I will implement paramters like `--embed-css`, `--embed-image` etc.\n. #141 opened.\nFor now, a workaround is to use `--clean-tmp 0`, such that you can find the components in the temp dir. But you will have to clean the dir manually then.\n. Thanks for reporting, I'm diagnosing.\n. [3rd], please try `--embed-external-font 1`, maybe I need to make it default, since there are many reports regarding this parameter\n\n[4th], I cannot reproduce it, may be it is because I'm using a newer version of Fontforge. Is it possible for you to update your FontForge?\n\nI'm not sure about your problem, what do you mean by 'typography-wise improvements'. I'm new to specific typography design.\n\nBTW the table is cool! Have you published any results of your comparison? I may need to 'steal' (I mean learn) more ideas from them.\n. It's actually [a bug of FontForge](https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge/issues/465). I'm now trying to work with them to fix it.\n\nFor now, please use my fork [https://github.com/coolwanglu/fontforge/tree/tmp], the `tmp` branch.\n. Are you using the latest git version? Probably I will need to add a git signature in `-v`.\nIf so, it must be a regression that I cannot reproduce :(\nCan you specify your environment?\n. @szepeshazi  Is it 32bit or 64bit? I've got a few VM available, so let me try to reproduce it.\n. @szepeshazi Oh I cannot reproduce it. So please provide your VM image.\n. @szepeshazi  Thanks! I can reproduce it in your VM image. Will come back later.\n. @szepeshazi OK, so I've found the cause. I guess you won't see the problem if you install the `gsfonts` package.\n\nIn your environment, poppler choose a different font, which pdf2htmlEX cannot handle correctly. I'll try to fix it.\n. @szepeshazi Please try the latest git again.\n\nSeems that the 'vertical shifting' info was not cleared when necessary.\n. Oh I mean I've got the bug fixed, so you may remove `gsfonts` if you like.\n\nI'm not sure about what you meant by 'decline in text readability', I just see font changed, both are OK to me (ubuntu 13.04 + Fx 21). But I'm not an font expert so I don't trust my 'OK'.\n\nWhat's your environment of viewing the HTML? Can you please provided the screenshot of the HTML files?\n. @szepeshazi Oh yes, Chrome on Windows is lack of font hinting. I strongly recommend ttfautohint, which should help a lot. Alternatively you may use something like `-webkit-font-smoothing` or similar CSS tricks, but I don't like them.\n\nAnd thank you for your input, this bug is tricky!\n. A workaround has been implemented.\n. @vineet89 seems that it's about the '-' symbols in the previous column, which are missing.\nI'll work on it.\n. @vineet89 Found the cause. The PDF maps the normal '-' into a soft hyphen, and the browsers will hide the symbol since the line does not break there. So essentially it's because the PDF provides a bad encoding.\n\nPlease update to the latest git version, and use `--to-unicode=-1`, which should fixes the problem.\n\nHowever I'll need to test with more files, this behaviour may be changed later.\n. @vineet89  Did you update your git repo? I can see a correct output here.\n\nLet me briefly explain this:\n\nIn PDF there are two set of encodings, one for displaying (such that a PDF viewer can choose the correct glyphs to show), and the other is for text extraction (such that you can get correct text if you copy & paste). But there can be only one set in HTML, and sometimes it is not possible to achieve both visual accuracy and text accuracy (at least for now). \n\nIn the case of this PDF file, the situation is slightly different, but if you select \"xx-Nov-2012\" and copy them out from a PDF viewer, I guess you don't see the hyphens, and the reason is that those are soft-hyphens, which should not be. This is provided by the '2nd set of encoding', and fortunately the 1st encoding is correct, and `--to-unicode=-1` forces pdf2htmlEX to use that set if possible. (When the 1st set is not even correct, there is no parameter right now, but maybe I can work out one)\n\nFor strictly standard compliant well-formed PDFs, you never need to worry about these issues, but in the wild world of PDF, I'm afraid that it might not be possible to find a set of parameters that works for all.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some possible hackings \n- Just convert all soft-hyphens into normal hyphens, since this symbol has special meaning in Unicode\n- Mark `soft-hyphens` as invalid, just as NBSP\n\nBut none of them are perfect solutions, the first one may break the layout when both normal hyphens and soft hyphens appears in the font; and the second still does not give you correct text.\n\nI wonder if I may hear some suggestions from you?\n. @vineet89 Currently I decide to mark 'soft hyphen' as invalid, such that by default the HTML is visually correct.\nThis behaviour might be changed in the future, I hope I can find a better design later.\n. @vineet89  The two sets of encodings are stored in the PDF, which can be any mappings. Currently if you add `--debug 1` and `--clean-tmp 0`, you will be able to find both sets of encodings in `/tmp/pdf2htmlEX-xxx`.\n\nI've just tried again, and pdf2htmlEX gives correct output without any parameters. Please let me know if it doesn't work for you.\n. @vineet89 great!\n. A same reason as discussed in #117. Maybe this feature should be removed.\n. Removed.\n. This behaviour has been stated in the manpage actually. \n\nIn PDF there are two set of encoding, one for rendering and the other is for text extraction. But in HTML there is only one.\n\n`space-as-offset`, as a workaround option, now reads only the first set. Maybe I can add a new value to double check the other encoding. \n\nFor now it's recommended to turn if off unless there are many positional spaces there, anyway this option has no (good) effect where there is no positional spaces.\n. Maybe I can add a new value for this option, such that both encodings are checked. But anyway this option is a workaround, so let me just wait for more reports about it.\n\nThanks for reporting.\n. Did you read the wiki pages? \nE.g.\nhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/QuickStart\n. Oh I didn't understand your question, what do you mean by \"next page\" and \"previous page\"?\n. I see. So seems that you may need to retrieve some info in HTML, \nprobably with JavaScript.\n\nCurrently there's no simple way to do that, and you have to hack it \nyourself. For example you can create an invisible DOM element with some \ninfo store in its attributes.\n. Please read the manpage and about the `--zoom` and `--fit-*`  parameters. \nAlso the wiki pages I've mentioned above.\n. Hi, I didn't realized that there was nothing about `--zoom`, sorry about that.\nWhy do you create a new issue anyway? You can still comment in the old one.\n\nYou can zoom the page by just passing something like `--zoom 1.5` to the program.\n. @micred I noticed that for an empty background, the image would be 7kb... which is too large. Of course you can compress it in this case, but I am not sure about the compression ratio when  there are many small pieces.\n\n@iclems's code records the bounding box of each stroke, and merges all overlapping ones. The result is a number of parts occpied in the background, which are not overlapping. The results are pretty good for my samples. In case that there are too many of them, I think I can pack them into one and use CSS sprite.\n\nGeneral PNG compression may be applied after that, they are not exclusive.\n. @iclems  See https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/issues/116\n\nIt has been planned. And actually I had spent a couple of weeks on that. But there's lots of works to do, since most svg are not optimized for web.\n\nAnd there are other problems, for example text in svg are not selectable in Firefox etc..\n.

I really don't want to put too much efforts into supporting legacy browsers, there are even people asking about IE6 and Firefox 2...\n\nBut there is `--fallback` available, which might be what you want.\n. Still about 'fallback', the size and position should be actually the same as in the normal mode, this parameter was originally designed for text that are covered by images, which should be hidden, but pdf2htmlEX would reveal them by design. Therefore if normal mode does not work, fallback mode won't either.\n\nThere are probably two problems, font and size. About font perhaps #83 would help, with woff or eot. It would be implemented in the future, probably when woff becomes popular. But My problem is that I don't have a Windows that I can install softwares... I am not against patches though, as long as they don't bring in too many ugly workarounds.\n\nAbout size, I remember that IE 8 does not support CSS transform? In that case, you may want to try setting 'font-size-multiplier' to 1, which might work (maybe even for normal mode).\n\nSorry that I don't have the environment to verify my guesses.\n. Still I think the compatibility to IE8 is not a worthy job. There are quite a few essential things that have to be compromised. So I'm closing this issue.\n\nThanks for reporting.\n. Can you please post a screenshot and specify your environment?\n. @micred Are you using IE8? `rescale` actually uses CSS `transform`.\n. I see, `rescale` has been inconsistent with the content now. I'll try to fix it.\n\nBut right now `rescale` is not used anywhere by default. Kind of abandoned.\n. 'em' is not likely to work, since it cascades. I've been thinking about\nusing 'rem', which should work, but might not be a good idea for embedding\ndocuments.\n\nOn Tue, May 7, 2013 at 10:11 PM, micred notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> I was wondering: can I use a relative unit of measurement (em in place of\n> pt) and change font-size to zoom content?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/issues/137#issuecomment-17544435\n> .\n.

Yes, seems so. So the function was implemented when there was no `pd`, and has not been updated accordingly since them. I'll fix it in a few days.\n. I'm not getting it. Can you please elaborate the 'but fram eis not tied to' part?\n. Hi, now I'm coming back for this issue.\n\nPlease elaborate more about your solution with `pl`, I'm feeling that we can apply CSS transformation on `pf` without introductin a new `<div>`, but I'll change `pf` to absolute width/height\n. Ah, now I truly understand what you meant 'not tied'. Let me try to figure it out...\n. Originally, `pf` was introduced to hold the place when `pc` is scaled. At that moment there was no `pd`.\n\nI guess now we can move `pf` outside `pd` to do the trick, what do you think? I may create a branch for this.\n. Oh I found something while trying to do this.\n\n`pf` was introduced to help locate page and determine if a page is visible. There should be no border of it because of the offset calculation.\n\nNow the border (of `pd`) and the transformation might cause problems for that part of code, let me see if it can be resolved.\n. I mean the broders for `pd`\n. Haven't finished yet. I'll show you later.\n. Please check out the `rescale_fix` branch. Seems that there's no problem as I predicted.\nCan you please test your rescale fixes there?\n. I guess I can close this issue due to your pull request?\nThanks!\n. Recently I removed page_decoration without hurting the visibility test of each page. I also test the code without smooth rescaling, which seems to work, so I removed that part of code. Would you like to have a try the `dev` branch?\nThanks!\n. Yes, that would involve lots of work about recognition. \n\nFor example I'm not sure if there is an easy way to extract the title, given that there are so many LaTeX templates, and some documents don't even have a title.\n. I cannot reproduce it. Which version are you using? Please post the output of `pdf2htmlEX -v`\n. Can you please also send me the output HTML for the first page (use `-l 1`)?\n. Um, seems that attachments in email don't work here. Maybe use public links like pastebin,gist or dropbox?\n. I see, it's about clipping, which have been implemented in the git version.\n\nSeems that you need to update your pdf2htmlEX and try again.\n. Are you using `--optimize-text 1`? If so, please disable it for now. There is a bug about it.\n. \u8fd9\u4e2a\u4e0d\u5c5e\u4e8e\u201c\u6587\u4ef6\u683c\u5f0f\u8f6c\u6362\u201d\u7684\u8303\u7574\u4e86\uff0cpdf2htmlEX\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u662f\u8ba9HTML\u6839\u539f\u59cbPDF\u4e00\u6837\u3002\n. Done.\n. Ok, so this issue affects many people. It's just been mentioned in #125 and I've opened #141 for a possible solution.\n\nSorry about the inconvenience, the reason I made this change is that actually the original design was ugly, there were many people asking about how to combine the components together, and I did think that this should be a master HTML file.\n\nFor now, here are a few options:\n- Revert the commit for #125 and wait for #141 \n- Use `--clean-tmp 0` and find the components there\n- Remove everything in `manifest` except for the line `$css`\n\nAnd please except about 1-2 weeks before I will have time for this issue. Thanks.\n. @anurag29  base.css and fancy.css can be found in `<data-dir>` (check `pdf2htmlEX -v`)\n. @akwok currently there is no way to remove the tags, you might want to do some post processing.\nSorry for the inconvenience.\n. A new set of options: `--embed` and `--embed-***` have been implemented. You can now specify whether to embed each specific type of element.\n\nPlease have a try.\n. I cannot reproduce it. I can get the file converted on my machine.\n\nThe 'Bus error' error looks mytersious to me.\n\nCan you please show the result of `pdf2htmlEX -v`?\n. Do you see this error for other PDF files? And how about use `-l 10` to limit the number of pages for this PDF?\n. Currently there's no way to simply skip one page, however you can use `-f 1 -l 40` to select the first 40 pages, and you can use `-f 42` to select the the 42nd and the following pages.\nIf you really want to combine them, you may want to process the PDF file with tools like pdftk.\n\nThere is no problem for me to compile the 40-42 pages. \n\nI'm not sure about the 'bus error' message, I'll try to do some research on this.\n. Right, that would make sense.\n\nRight now there is no way to combine the html files, but actually I don't recommend you to combine them, since the HTML file will try to load all the pages, which might blow your device up. Have you tried to view the 100-page HTML on your Kindle?\n. @arjun-iyer  I guess I can close this issue?\n. OK, then I'll try to gather more information about it.\n\nOn Sat, May 18, 2013 at 2:59 PM, arjun-iyer notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> It does occur for some pages though.

I'm sorry that I'm not familiar with OS X, and I don't find anything useful through Google...\n\nDo you have any idea about the meaning of 1064?\n. Still the info is not sufficient, please reopen with more info.\n. Thanks for reporting.\n\nPlease post CMakeCache and version of your g++\n. Also please test if your can compile the following source code with `-std=c++0x`\n\n``` c++\nint main(){ auto i = 0; return 0; }\n```\n. Please reopen this issue when you can provide more information.\n. please read the manpage about the process-nontext parameter.\n. Thank you very much for your effort!\n\nPlease add yourself in `AUTHORS'`, and review my comments.\n. Thanks for reporting.\n\n#62 was about the text selection issue.\n\nIn earlier versions, images were actually placed with `background-image`. And I switched it to the img tag for an easier printing. On fx or chrome users have to tweak the setting to print background images, and the one in fx was not easy to find. Also I had to use js to disable dragging in the same way as in the current version.\n. Suppose that text and image are not overlaid, #213 could be a cure.\n. Please read the manpage about the `--dest-dir` parameter.\n. It's been planned, but I've got no sample files.\nPlease provide a few if possible.\nThanks.\n. @leonzinger Can you please provide a screenshot of a correct rendering? Since I've got no idea about the Hebrew language.\n. I've added a css there, hopefully it would work.\n\nPlease try the latest git version.\n\nHowever I guess that if you copy the text out, still you get the reversed string, the problem is that in PDF the character are indeed placed from left to right. \n\nFor now, at least I want the visual is correct, such that people can read the document.\n. I see that a \"Hello\" word in RTL language (such that you actually want to see \"olleH\") in placed left to right, char-by-char in PDF, such that it would be \"olleH\" in a normal (LTR) environment. After all PDF is designed for printing, so this is reasonable. \n\nHowever the browser would recognize the Hebrew characters and try to use the \"correct\" direction, such that it would be reversed again, into \"Hello\", which is wrong.\n\nThe best solution is to recognize the characters and reverse it, such that we can copy the correct text out. But I don't see a simple solution, given the complicated character positioning rules and the possibility of mixed usage of LTR and RTL languages.\n. Can anyone please verify if this has been fixed?\n. Please reopen this issue if the problem still exists.\n. Please check the `--process-outline` option.\n. manpage is actually pretty standard, and actually I have mentioned some where, e.g. [this wiki page](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/QuickStart).\n\nCreating a wiki page may not be easy to maintain, since the the options are likely to change. But I'll add a notice there.\n\nThanks!\n. Thanks for the patch.\n\nI hid the object because I didn't expect people would use my JS code. And there might be a problem if there are multiple `pdf2htmlEX.Viewer`s in a single HTML. How would you plan to deal with that?\n. Oh my previous comment may not make much sense. And I think it'd be OK to export it.\n\nI'd suggest a few changes:\n- Move the reference into the `pdf2htmlEX` namespace object, or maybe even inside `pdf2htmlEX.Viewer`\n- 'pdf2htmlEXViewerInstance` does not look like a perfect name to me, but I've got no better ones.\n. Viewer cannot be made singleton, because there can be multiple viewers in a single window. Here we are just talking about the single Viewer used in the default HTML template.\n\nI wanted `pdf2htmlEX` works like a namespace, such that there is as least name pollution as possible -- everything introduced in pdf2htmlEX will be inside `window.pdf2htmlEX`. It's something like `std::cout` in C++. \n\nHow about `pdf2htmlEX.defaultViewer`?\n. And please add yourself to `AUTHORS` :) I'll merge then.\n. Thanks for reporting.\nIt looks like a bug, and I'll try to diagnose.\n. And what options did you use for the conversion?\n. I cannot reproduce it. Which version of pdf2htmlEX are you using?\n. OK, so I see you are not using the latest version and `--optimize-text` is on by default, which is buggy.\n\nWhich version of Ubuntu are you using? I'll update the PPA.\n. PPA updated. Please try again.\n. Thanks for reporting.\n\nI cannot reproduce it. I can convert it with the default option.\n\nPlease specify your environment, provide the output of `pdf2htmlEX -v` and the log of conversion with option `--debug 1`\n. Tables in PDF are nothing but grid positioned text with line drawing. \nAnd pdf2htmlEX does not recognize them.\n. Please reopen this issue with a stack trace.\n. Thanks for reporting. \n\nI see strings like `\\n/Type /Pattern\\n` in the log, which are raw PDF materials, so I guess it's about poppler.\n\nCan you please also try `pdf2cairo` or `evince` (or other PDF viewers based on poppler) and see if they suffer from the same issue?\n. OK, I'll close it then.\n. Yes, I can reproduce it.\n\nThanks for reporting.\n. Should have been just fixed.\nPlease try the git version again.\n. Please reopen this issue if the problem still exists.\n. I cannot reproduce it.\n\nPlease show me the output of `pdf2htmlEX -v`\n. @bilalmughal Do you see a similar crash if you use `pdftohtml -c -s` on the same PDF file?\n. @bilalmughal  I usually use the git version.\n. You can modify the `manifest` file and remove the line for jquery.\n. Thanks!\n. Yes, I see what you mean.\nYou may want to take a look at the `embed_file` function in `src/HTMLRenderer/general.cc`.\n`resource_path` looks a little bit confusing to me, at the first glance I thought that it's about the resources of pdf2htmlEX. Maybe `resource_prefix` ?\n. Can you please provide the following information:\n- output of `pdf2htmlEX -v`\n- a link of the problematic PDF file\n- your OS spec (OS, version, 32/64 etc)\n. Hi, I cannot reproduce it. But I did hear about the crash on Mac OS.\n\nCan you provide a stack trace? Or it'd be almost impossible for me to debug.\n. Please reopen this issue with a stack back trace\n. Thanks for the patch.\nI'm new to Travis CI, I'll try to figure it out.\n. I tried to add it in travis ci, hopefully it will work.\n. No for now. \nI might need to introduce a prefs system later...something like in Firefox.\n. Seems that double-tap & hold triggers the word selection, while the normal letter-by-letter selection is not working.\n\nRight now I cannot find the cause, I'm not quite familiar with safari.\n. @josefnorlin text are already above the background image.\n. I've found the cause, and I think I've fixed it.\nCan you please try the git version?\n. FIXED confirmed by email.\n. I cannot confirm this, please provide the output of `pdf2htmlEX -v`\n. NOT VALID confirmed by email.\n. Hi @rcampbell , I just checked this issue again. The causes are:\n- Browsers will round the font sizes specified in the page. [ref](http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2010/02/10/rounding-off/)\n  - That's why `--font-size-multiplier` works\n- In your PDF, a sentence is cut into two parts, the second part has a clipping path and therefore the two parts cannot be merged. Now due to the problem above, the first part is longer than we expected, so the end of the first part will overlap with the beginning of the second half.\n\nThis is indeed an issue of pdf2htmlEX, but probably not a 'bug'. So far I have no good solutions in my mind.\n\nThe vertical shift issue might be compensated by a smaller value of `--veps`.\n\nFinally, I wonder why `--space-as-offset` would help, can you please give an example?\n. please use `--dest-dir`\n. why `pdf2htmlEX.js.in` is now executable (755)?\n. Looks great! Thanks!\n\nPlease check out my comments.\n. OK, I think we're ready to merge this.\nThank you very much for your efforts!\n. A CSS rules might be used for multiple pages. So separating them will likely to increase the size a lot.\nOn the other hand you may use -f and -l to generate a stand-alone html for each pdf page.\n. I cannot reproduce this.\n\nWhat's the output of `pdf2htmlEX -v`, and which version of getopt are you using?\n. The comments are useless in CSS, I don't want to expose them, plus I have to handle special characters in order to prevent injection.\nHow about export them in a log file?\n. I think I will add the name to the list of font-family, which should make sense.\n. @drinkupper Now I make font names printed if you use the `--debug 1` parameter, is that enough for you?\n\nI've just checked the CSS standard about identity names, and there are quite some rules, e.g. an identity name cannot start with a digit. So I don't think it's easy and safe to put it in `font-family`. But debug output is always safe to me.\n. Please reopen if necessary.\n. I am not sure about your question, there is an option for the output filenames.\n. Thanks for reporting.\n\n I have just tested evernote clipper with one of the demo pages, and I found some problems :+1: \n- Only the first page is shown\n  - To make it smoother, only the visible pages are rendered, others are hidden. This is handled by Javascript. You may remove the lines of js from the manifest file\n-  The background\n  - You may edit base.css for that\n- Wrong fonts\n  - Seems that the clipper cannot handle embedded fonts correctly. Or maybe there are options I do not know.\n. For now, I don't think any evernote-specific features should be added to pdf2htmlEX, which has nothing to do with the pdf-to-html conversion.\n\nAnd so far I don't know what I can do about the font problem, it's more like an issue of the clipper.\n. `--optimize-text` is still buggy, and that's why I disable it by default.\nI'll work on it later, and there's no other way of optimizations so far.\n. Hi @myusernameistaken , I'm now trying to tackle this issue, can you please provide the pdf file?\n. I made a fix, can you please try the latest git repo and see if we have a better result?\n. Yes, I'm aware of this. It's mostly because the height of the pdf container is fixed, so technically the browser does not see anything outside the screen.\n\nUsually I don't work on UI stuffs, but I will be glad to merge if you can create a patch.\n. I guess a few lines of JavaScript should work.\n. Although #181 is merged, it is not enabled by default. I think I'll add a new parameter for this.\n. Thanks for your patch!\n\nPlease check my comments.\n. Don't worry about the `window` stuff, let's see if any one will complain about this.\n\nPlease review my new comments, also don't forget to add yourself in `AUTHORS`\n. Don't worry about the `window` stuff, let's see if any one will complain about this.\n\nPlease review my new comments, also don't forget to add yourself in `AUTHORS`\n. Manually merged. While I still have to disable the key handler by default, I'll try to work out a way for that.\nThanks!\n. oops..\n\nThank you very much!\n. Have you tried `ttfautohint` ? You may find more info in the wiki.\n. @iapain OK, I'll check it out, probably it will be the default if everything is fine.\n. According to http://caniuse.com woff is not widely supported as ttf, actually only on android mobile.\n\nThe main problem here is still about hinting, I'm not quite sure if I need to add hinting information there for Windows, if so, I don't find a counterpart for ttfautohint right now.\n. @iapain  I'll try on my windows machine later.\n. According to my tests, woff is better in both size and visual effect (comparing with ttf without ttfautohint).\nHowever I found a few bugs for Firefox/Chrome on Linux, probably further due to their backend parsing woff.\n\nI think we will definitely switch to woff, but still we need more time. Currently ttf+ttfautohint seems still to be the best solution overall.\n. #83 is relevant.\n. Currenty if `--font-format=woff` is used, seems that all italic text cannot be rendered correctly in Firefox + Windows.\n\nIt seems to be my fault though.\n. I tried with the `demo.pdf` in `README`. The fonts seem to be OK (viewed in font viewer), but some italic ones are not recognized by browsers.\nI think I can make woff the default type after fixing this issue.\n. ironically, those fonts work well in IE\n. filed a new issue #238\n. `woff` is the default format now.\n. Thanks for your effort. I've not finished reading your code, but seems that you are trying to draw the intermediate frames with JS, which are too heavy weighted to me... I wonder if a smooth animation is worthy for that much of CPU usage.\n\nBTW, I cannot merge this right now, since you add global handlers, which might affect existing users. I'm planning to create a 'standalone mode', where we are free to add UI features.\n. By global handlers I meant those registered in `zoom_fixer`.\n\nThere are a few problems in the JS codes I can see so far:\n1. There have been some people who were complaining about the high cpu usage of existing dom elements, so I wonder if it'll be OK to add more cpu intensive features. Usually people do not use my JS codes, they build their UI themselves, so I don't received complaints about UI features often.\n2. The JS codes is not well organized, partially because I did not expect people use my code. I'll try to reorganize and add more comments inside. Meanwhile, I think some of your code are not easy to understand, e.g. `NR_PAGES_TO_PRERENDER_ON_ZOOM`, what can you tell from this name, even with the following comments?\n\nI'll go on reading your code and make comments if necessary.\n\nThanks!\n. @micred  I will merge them of course, I just need to make sure there won't be bad side effects.\n. Merged. Thanks!\n\nBut I'll still disable `zoom_fixer` by default.\n. Please do a thorough remake (make clean && cmake . && make) if you have updated poppler.\n\nAlso please provide the affected pdf for debug.\n\nThanks.\n. @doublex It seems to be something wrong with FontForge. I'll try to fix it.\n. @doublex I think I have fixed it. Please try the lastest git version.\n. Can you check the location of poppler header files? Where are they stored?\n. Please specify which version and where have fontforge installed.\n. @git4ajay Your version of FF is too old, please review the dependencies of pdf2htmlEX. \n. Please reopen if the issue still exists with a recent version of FF\n. There's no unicode information in the pdf file. \nIf you open the pdf file with a pdf viewer, then try to copy and paste some text, you won't see much meaningful characters.\n. \u8bf7\u63d0\u4f9bpdf\u6587\u4ef6\u4f9b\u8c03\u8bd5\uff0c\u8c22\u8c22\n. \u6211\u770b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e0b\uff0c\u6ca1\u53d1\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\u3002\n\u4f60\u7684pdf2htmlEX\u7248\u672c\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u5206\u522b\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f\n. \u8bf7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u6807\u8bb0reopen\n. I've checked your code, I see you added a new dependency for the mkdtemp implementation. \n\nI don't think it's good here, ideally I want a simple implementation which relies on windows header files only. For example, the implementation on http://oku.edu.mie-u.ac.jp/~okumura/texwiki/?pdf2htmlEX#d9c5cb24 looks good to me.\n. I'm afraid that I cannot merge this pull request right now. I really don't want to introduce extra dependencies, especially for Windows, which is not a main supported OS by pdf2htmlEX.\n\nProbably the best solution is to use random numbers or PID. I'll just wait for some one improve the patch.\n. @witwall we still need the headers files for only one function, which doesn't seems to worth it. Also poppler can be built without glib, we don't want those users install glib only for this function.\n\nI briefly checked your library, but did not find the code for Windows, I wonder if how long is that part? After all in the site I mentioned previously, there are only less than 20 lines.\n. Actually in earlier versions of pdf2htmlEX I did use `mktemp` for this, but if you read the documentation about `mkstemp`, their might be race conditions in `mktemp`. This could be a problem when you run multiple instances of pdf2htmlEX at the same time.\n\nThis is also the reason that I have not merged the solution on Tex Wiki\n. Yes glib-2.0 is a hard dependency of fontforge, thanks for pointing that out.\nFontforge depends on only glib 2.6, however `g_mkdtemp` is not introduced until glib 2.30...\n\nBased on this one https://github.com/witwall/mktemp/blob/master/mkdtemp.c\nand also https://code.google.com/p/bsd-xdr/source/browse/trunk/src/mkdtemp.c?r=9\nI'd propose you improve your last implementation:\n- Replace `mktemp` with your own implementation, there are several documentations against `mktemp`, mostly because old poor implementations\n- Add a few more tries, e.g. 100, in case of collision.\n. Another side effect of introducing new libraries is that some users who are using old versions will be confused, when a newer version won't compile. So I'll try to prevent this as much as possible.\n. I remembered that someone had the same issue, and the reason was the getopt library.\nPlease check the version, and maybe you can check previous issues for clues.\n. Please see if #173  is your case.\n. No. In that case the size of the HTML file will be too large.\n. Can you give an example? I'm not quite sure about your case.\n. Still I'm not getting it, I don't see any advantage of inline CSS right now.\n\nMaybe you can try to separte PDF first, then convert each page into a separte HTML?\n. I've actually not planned any UI features, or maybe most UI features. There are people told me that they are trying to build UI, but I have not heard anything new from them.\n\nAs I mentioned in the blog, I'm planning for a 'standalone' mode where we can add any UI features without thinking about many different embedding cases. I'll also merge all UI pull requests created by you and others.\n\nI guess this is a bonus but not essential feature, I'll be glad to merge if you implement it.\n. @mickgiles I'm not sure about the definition of two-page view here.\nWhile @micred first mentioned it, I thought it's like the (vertical) two page view as in Adobe Reader.\n\nBut are you talking about the mode for some magazines, like in issuu.com? Please specify your requirements. And maybe it's better to open a new issue for that.\n. Looks like the encoding is not handled correctly.\nLet me try on my Linux tomorrow.\n. pdf2htmlEX crashes on this file, and I'm not quite sure about it.\nI'll work on it later.\n. I have fixed the crash. And I did not see any problem in the result. I suspect it's something wrong in the windows packaging. If possible, please try to compile pdf2htmlEX with cygwin and see if the problem still exists. Otherwise I'll suggest you to contact the packager as listed in https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Download\n. I'm not sure what's your use case. Intermediate files still have to be created and processed anyway, for example font conversion and image processing. And what shall we do with this parameter when there are multiple files?\n. @dhsto I don't think this will boost the performance in a large factor\n- Since intermediate files must be generated, removing the time for the final file could save at most 1/2 time, which is however not likely because:\n- The bottleneck is usually font & image processing, e.g. if you use `--process-nontext 0`, you'll see a large performance gain\n\nI suggest you try to do a profiling shows that this feature will help before you actually implement it\n. Please provide the pdf file\n. @chriskuhar  I don't think you can attach file in mail reply, please post the first few lines of the backtrace, and also the output of `pdf2htmlEX -v`.\n\nPlease also try the lastest git version, in case the bug has been fixed. \n. It's kind of strange to me, I have never seen gconv linked, especially MACINTOSH.so, maybe it's a hidden dependency of fontforge.\n\nI see that the version of fontforge is too old, maybe you should update it.\n. Please reopen if the problem still exists.\n. Where did you install cairo?\nPlease post `CMakeCache.txt` if possible.\n. Seems that cairo is not found? Please attache the full output of `cmake`\n. Please reopen if the problem still exists.\n. Oh, I'll try to fix build for poppler 0.24 then\n. I cannot reproduced it, it works well with poppler 0.24.\nPlease reopen if you see the error again.\n. Generally transformations are not generated due to the multiplier, most of them are indeed transformations defined in PDF. \n\nJust to make sure, can you provide a sample PDF file?\n. `--font-size-multiplier=1` disables all transformations generated by pdf2htmlEX, but transformations in PDF are still there.\nPlease provide a sample PDF file and reopen this issue.\n. I think this is a duplicate of #162 \n. Seems that there is something wrong with your `cmake`, please check your installation.\n. I'm not sure about this error, never seen it before.\nAs I doubted it's about your cmake installation, maybe you can try if it works for other projects. If not, I think there's not much things I can do. Maybe you'd better search for the error message and seek for help in cmake forums.\n. Just fixed, please try the latest git version\n. Please provide the pdf file.\n. I cannot reproduce it. Please specify the version of pdf2htmlEX, your browser and OS.\n. Please reopen if the problem still exists.\n. Yes confirmed, I'll try to find the cause.\n. Just fixed, Thanks!\nPlease suggest a name and email such that I can add you in `AUTHORS`. Or you can create a pull request for that.\n. Currently all supported formats are directly generated via poppler. I don't think it is worthy to support some formats separately in this project.\n\nAs there are already great conversion tools for images, maybe the better way is to inject converter during the process of pdf2htmlEX, see #174 \n. Try to remove `CMakeCache.txt` and then rebuild the project. \n. How did you install poppler? If you installed via git, you should update it.\n. can you post the `CMakeCache.txt` file?\n. I downloaded poppler 0.22.2, and the `SplashOutputDev.h` file is not the same as shown in your message.\nI'm not sure what's wrong with it but I suggest you to re-download and install poppler\n. Great!\n\nOn Thu, Sep 26, 2013 at 8:03 PM, Toni Sanju\u00e1n notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> Finally I update poppler via git and all work correctly..\n> \n> Thanks\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/issues/210#issuecomment-25162075\n> .\n. Did you check the wiki for troubleshooting, seems that you did not install header files of poppler\n. Did you check the wiki? Might be helpful.\n. Please reopen if the problem still exists.\n. Already fixed.\n. what's the version of your poppler?\n. Please attach the log of cmake, also CMakeCache.txt if possible\n. Yes, as I suspected, you did not specify correct INCLUDE dir, such that the poppler installed in `/usr/lib` was used.\n. Or, it's because you did not specify correct path for pkgconfig, you should not use `cat /usr/local/lib/`... instead you should use `pkg-config --libs poppler`\n. So as I said, the one installed in `/usr` was used, but you need to set correct pkgconfig path to locate the one installed in `/usr/local`\n. @tienle Is it working now?\n. @Chrismarsh Thanks. Probably I should add it to FAQ since lots of Fedora users complaint about that.\n. Please read the messages again carefully, you do not have (a new enough version of) poppler installed.\n. Did you try `--heps`, I wonder if that would help.\n. @yu-liang-kono Cannot confirm with Firefox/MacOS. Which browser and OS are you using?\n. The typo has been fixed, please test if there is still any error.\nI'll test on IE10 later.\n.

Please reopen the issue if necessary.\n. oops, that's a typo. I'll fix it soon.\n. Please test again.\n. In very early version of pdf2htmlEX, some metadata (e.g. title, author) are retrieved, I wanted to extract title and put it as the title of HTML. However I found that that piece of info of lots of PDF generated from LaTeX were inaccurate, due to the intermediate conversions (tex -> dvi -> ps -> pdf). So I dropped those code.\n\nIt's not hard to extract those information, but I'm not sure what's the proper way of storing them into HTML. I'm almost sure that I should use `<meta>` tag, but not sure about the property names.\n. @mrshu It's something like this: https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/blob/paperclub/src/PaperClub.h#L146 but maybe you need to read poppler code and PDF spec for complete keys.\n. From what I got from the Internet, css is case insensitive but class names are, because they are attributes defined in HTML -- just as you have mentioned. I did see a few articles suggesting not to use case insensitive matching class names.\n\nI wonder if you can write an example of 'injecting css via javascript', I'm not sure about how it works.\n. It seems to be a bug about javascript of chrome: http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=74750\n\nI'll change the class name anyway.\n. Fixed. Thanks!\n. I don't think it's a memory leak. I notice that there are more than 73000 fonts defined in the PDF, according to `pdffonts`, although most of them are not embedded. So I suggest you use the `--embed-external-font 0` option.\n. Hi, the warning message is about malformed encoding inside PDF.\nThere are two sets of encodings in PDF, one for rendering and the other for Unicode, and pdf2thmlEX tries to merge them for HTML, but it is not always possible to do so. \n\nWhen `-tounicode` is not specified, pdf2htmlEX would try to ensure the visual correctness by reencoding some glyphs (but they will become garbage text when copied out). However if `--tounicode 1` is specified, the mapping defined in PDF will always be used even if some glyphs will become missing.\n\nTheoretically this issue can be solved by creating extra fonts for the conflicted encoding, which is not worth the time at this moment. But I'll create an issue for that later anyway.\n. Great!\n. Cannot reproduce it.\nPlease specify the output of `pdf2htmlEX -v` and your environment.\n. I'm also using ubuntu gnome 13.10, and the only difference is that you are using an older version of fontforge than mine. So I guess that's the problems.\n\nPlease rerun pdf2htmlEX with `--debug 1`, when it crashed,  find the fonts in the `/tmp/pdf2htmlEX-xxx` directory.\nFor each font there, open it with fontforge and click file -> generate fonts -> uncheck \"validate\" -> generate. If any of these failes, it should be some Fontforge bug.\n. No this one doesn't crash either.\n. Often I build from git. Since there have been always bugs and fixes...\n. According to a recent bug report, 20120731 of fontforge is faulty, I guess you can fix it by updating fontforge.\nPlease reopen if necessary.\n. Thanks!\n. `replace` is not possible, at least for now. I don't think it's event supported by PDF readers. I also doubt for `add bookmarks`\n\n`search in PDF bookmarks`  also sounds like a rare use case to me.\n\nI'm not sure if `innerText` or `:contains` is enough for these features: see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12445020/javascript-window-find-doesnt-work-absolutely\n\nBut indeed there is a problem when lazy loading is enabled: pages are not loaded until viewed, so we need to load them before searching for any text.\n. https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Unfeatures#ui\n\nUI is never a focus of pdf2htmlEX, publisher are meant to provide their UI with `pdf2htmlEX.js` as a reference. \n\nI'm closing this one as a duplicate of #219 \n. Is it duplicate of #166 or #148 ?\n. duplicate of #30 \n. How about using `border-image`, e.g. https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/web/viewer.css#L1243\n. IE 11 supports it http://caniuse.com/border-image\n. How about this ugly hack?\nhttp://css-tricks.com/how-to-create-an-ie-only-stylesheet/\n. No.\nPlease post questions to the mailing list instead of here.\n. Seems that there are special unicode characters. I'll try to find more info.\n. As shown in http://jsfiddle.net/coolwanglu/puaDa/\nIndeed the behavior of chrome is different from others.\n\nI don't have a good solution so far, but seems that `--space-as-offset` is a workaround\n. Oh I didn't mention it.\nWhite-space is supposed to be append after  each white space, but seems that it's applied only one in Chrome for multiple white space character in the beginning.\n. https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge/issues/926\n. Since `ttf->woff` first, now a `ttf` font is always generated before converted to the final format.\n. Please specify the output of `pdf2htmlEX -v` and a sample file.\n. The image looks fine on Win 8.1. And I cannot test on Android since I don't have any Android devices.\n\nSince you mentioned that the images work on most browsers, it's likely to be something wrong of those two browsers, or a bug of poppler.\n\nYou can test `pdftohtml -c -s` from poppler, see if the same thing happens, if so, you may want to report the bug to poppler.\n. @hussainb I don't think it's about cmyk, pdf2htmlEX always uses RGB.\n@godwin668 please test the output of `pdftohtml -c -s`\n. @godwin668 Indeed imagemagick also complains about the png image. I'll try to find out the reason.\n. @godwin668 Previously I tested with the image you provided, but I cannot reproduce it with my build. So the problem must be in the windows version. You may want to report to the maintainer, or try to build pdf2htmlEX from source.\n. what's the browser you are using?\n. Should have been fixed. Please check.\n. `--single-html` has been deprecated, please use `--embed***` now, check the manpage.\n\nIndeed this option is still mentioned in the examples of the manpage, I'll clean it.\n. Please also post the cmake log and the version of g++.\n\nIt seems that the dynamic libraries cannot be correctly linked with, but I'm still not sure about the reason right now.\n. Just a wild guess, please run `ldconfig` and try to rebuild.\n. Do you have other installations of poppler? I guess that some other poppler lib is linked with. What's the output of `locate libpoppler.` ?\nFor the second part, you need to install the python-dev package including header files, libraries and pkg-config files, and then re-cmake pdf2htmlEX. Also you can disable python when configuring fontforge.\n. I reviewed again the information you have provided, but still having no clue. \nFrom my understanding so far, it appears to be more likely misconfiguration in your system than a bug of pdf2htmlEX.  I think you can close this issue if you don't need it. Or maybe we can still work on it until it's get resolved &mdash; it's up to you.\n\nSince you can build and install poppler, I assume that you can also run utilities from poppler (e.g. pdffonts), can you please provide the output of `ldd `which pdffonts`` and `file /usr/lib/libpoppler.so`?\n\nMaybe you can try to build another software that is linked with poppler.\n. As I didn't find a simple solution these days, I'll just close it until someone really needs want to solve it.\n. Do you mean #56?\nAnd please post questions to the mailing list.\n. I cannot reproduce it on Ubuntu 13.10.\nPlease provide the output of `pdf2htmlEX -v`, and maybe a stack trackback if possible.\n. Hmm. I wonder if you have trimmed the first line of the output.\nThe depended libraries look fine though.\n\nTo create a backtrace:\n- install `gdb`\n- If you built pdf2htmlEX from source, re-cmake with `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` and then build and install it &mdash; this would get all the function names shown in the backtrace\n- run `gdb pdf2htmlEX`\n- type `r [options] foobar.pdf`, you should get the backtrace there\n- type `quit` to quit\n. Actually you may remove all the lines starting with 'warning:', they are of no use.\n\nI guess that the problem is about the fontforge you have installed, I wonder if you can install a newer version.\n. great\n. Currently I update the PPA when there's a stable release or some important commit I feel it better landed into PPA.\nI wonder if there is any one who would like to maintain a stable PPA.\n\nI'm not quite sure what do you mean by 'private PPA', I guess you should refer to official documentations.\n. How about this, I'll release only stable version in the PPA from now on.\n. Did [this](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Building#troubleshooting) help?\n. Sorry I cannot test it myself for a few days.\n\nDid you try different values for `--to-unicode` ? And are there any output of pdf2htmlEX with this file?\n. What's the version you are using?  Please post the output of `pdf2htmlEX -v`\n\nEncoding should have been specified in the html file since an early version.\n\nPost also post the `manifest` file you are using (located in the `data-dir` in the output above)\n. Actually text are rendered into images, while hidden text layer is provided for selection.\n\nIn this way the hidden text layer may be not so accurate, and that's why lots of styles may be removed.\n. (1) and part of (2) should be done with `--optimize-text`, althought it's still faulty for some tricky PDF>\n\nI'd actually been planning to do 3 and 4, at the cost of some inaccuracy. Not finished yet. \n. @Toneti777 There are other concerns of item 2, `<span>` elements are usually added to adjust inner-word space, or due to the change of font or other styles. If you remove the span elements and merge the text, accuracy cannot be preserved. \n. @Toneti777 But if you managed to optimize the output a lot with item 1 and 2, it sounds like a bug of pdf2htmlEX &mdash; producing unnecessary span elements. In that case, can you please file a new bug with sample files?\n. Maybe you can try a larger value for `--heps` and `--optimize-text 1`\n. I think this is a duplicate of #56 so I close this one.\n. There is already a `fit_width` function of `pdf2htmlEX.Viewer`, you may call that function in `init_after_***()` &mdash; which is called after DOM is loaded.\n. Can you provide a sample PDF? Thanks!\n. Please provide a sample file, as well as for #253\n. Seems that there's nothing I can do about it:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/10684392/can-i-force-text-to-print-as-white\n\nThe fix for Chrome is already includes, and that's why it works on Chrome.\n\nHopefully there will be an option for Firefox in the future.\n. I cannot reproduce it (Chromium 31 + Ubuntu 13.10)\n\nDoes it happen on only this file or all files produced by pdf2htmlEX ?\n. I cannot reproduce it on Chrome 35 + Mac OS.\nIf you can still reproduce it, probably it's a bug of Chrome on Linux.\n. Sorry that I didn't have enough time for the review.\nI just left a few comments, please check them out.\n\nThanks for the patch!\n. btw, don't forget to add yourself in `AUTHORS`\n. I just noticed the `quiet` parameter, and I wonder how it could be useful.\nTo make it making sense, all the output in the future will have to be wrapper by a `if(!param.quiet)`, which is quite likely to be error prune.\nOn the other hand you can simply use a redirection to remove all the messages.\n. Usually I'd use cerr for messages, and cout for output. For example, potentially you can dump the output html in stdout without being worried about other messages.\n. I found a few more minor issues. Please take a look.\nAlso can you leave a message here if you have updated this PR, since otherwise I won't get any notification. \nThanks!\n. I found a few more issues after merging this PR, I wonder if you'd like to take a look.\nI don't have mingw so I cannot test them, but I hope there are less env detect directives as possible.\n. No I didn't mean it doesn't work, instead I meant we might be able to simplify the code utilizing mingw.\nAfter all we are using a POSIX environment instead of calling specific system APIs.\n\nFor example cygwin provide posix-compatible headers such that we do not need to test the cygwin macro all the time, and I wonder how we can do so similarly with mingw without as few `_WIN32` as possible.\n. Another problem, `_WIN32` may also affects cygwin, while you are only targeting at mingw. I think it's better to revert the commits and merge it again once you get all of them polished. \n. I found that mingw provides its own mkdir, stat etc, so it's better to use them instead of win32 api, to reduce the maintenance cost.\n\nI've cleaned all detection for WIN32, instead of reverting the commits since the new option is included.\n\nPlease file a new PR if necessary and sorry for the inconvenience, I should have been more careful before merging it.\n. @marcsanfacon I'll comment in the new PR. Thanks.\n. Hi, currently there's no plan for this feature.\nMaybe this is a duplicate of #196 ?\n. I'll check it out. Thanks!\n. I tried this one before, but didn't work for me on iPad 1. It caused tearing and tiling.\n. I tried translateZ on ipad1, not perfect but helps a lot, maybe ipad1 is too old (but (even lower budget) android devices seem to be fine) \n\nI'll add it.\nThanks!\n. Nope, seems that the effects are similar with or without translateZ.\nBut maybe I'll just add it, not sure if there will be any side effects.\n\nI wonder if you could test if adding translateZ only to pf or pc would help. I guess only one would be enough?\n. marked as duplicate of #30. Actually I've tried translateZ before.\nNot sure if it only works for ipad >1\n. I'm sorry that I cannot fix this myself, as I cannot find Safari around me. That's why I didn't list it as officially supported.\n\nI'll try to fix the issue on Chrome and see if it helps here.\n. I cannot reproduce it with Chrome 31 + Ubuntu 13.10\n. Yes, I can reproduce it on Windows\n. I saw old posts on stackoverflow, seems that chrome will wrap inline-block elements regardless of the value of white-space.\nThe inline-block property was added for some special cases, when there are negative margins.\nI don't have a good solution right now, unfortunately.\n. https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35443\n\nThis is the webkit bug for this issue. Some one mentioned a workaround in the comments. I'll try that later.\n. The workaround seems to work, I've pushed it. Please have a try.\n. @sporritt No I'm not sure. You may try the latest version of pdf2htmlEX.\n. Please follow the guidance in the wiki and reopen this issue with more info.\n. Actually it was added at some time, but it will increase the specificity, such that I'll have to add the prefix to all the generated CSS rules &mdash; these might increased the size by a few kb.\n\nI guess that the only problematic rule would be `span`, how about changing `span` to `.t span`, does it work?\n. @sathomas For now it's easier to specify different class names. You can just change them in [css_class_names.cmakelists.txt](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/blob/master/src/css_class_names.cmakelists.txt) and rebuild the project.\n\nThe top-level id/class (e.g. loading-indicator you've mentioned) are considered as demos, which can be changed in the `manifest` file, I also left a few interface in the `pdf2htmlEX` js object for specifying different names.\n\nBut indeed there are likely issues when putting two html files together, in which case even adding a prefix selector won't help &mdash we need two different prefixes. If the prefix is determined by the user, or from the name of the PDF file, the difficulty would be to convert existing rules in `base.css`\n. @sathomas Another option is to add a new macro in the `manifest` file, and to prepend it to all generated CSS classes, but the prefix has to be determined the in the compile time, which doesn't sound to be useful.\n\nI've not come up with any good time of processing the .css style though, \n\nBtw, did `.t span` work for you? \n. @sathomas  @nicolaasmatthijs  OK I just added it to base.css\n. @trnelson One possible reason is that you are using a development version, that's released before 0.11 is officially released. Did you get it from the `v0.11` tag?\n. @trnelson Oh, the PPA has not been update for a while #310 \n. @trnelson For now I'd recommend to compile from source, although it might not be a comfortable process. Also please leave more comments to #310 instead of here. Thanks.\n. @duanyao I think it'd be enough to prefix the css rules as @sathomas originally proposed.\nAt first I worried about the performance, but maybe it's fine now.\n. @duanyao How about a random prefix for each document? Not sure if this would be an overkill.\n. Please follow the guidance in the wiki and reopen this issue with more info.\n. @d0ptnow Although I saw your email, I could not see any message here now.\n\nI'm afraid that I cannot test it myself as I don't have an Android device\n. I cannot reproduce it. What's the browser & OS are you using?\n. I can reproduce it now. The unicode values stored in the PDF file are not valid.

I remember that you can extract pages with acrobat. If not, I'd suggest you try a few others.\n\nOn the other hand, if you nothing works, please just wait for a few more days, I need to find a better network.\n. I cannot reproduce it.\n\nYou mentioned that the error occurs on one of your computers, but not on the other one. What are the versions of Fontforge installed?\n. You said the error occurred on one computer but not another, what are the version info on **both** ?\n\nThe message about ToUnicode is harmless, just notifying that the information stored in PDF is useless. \n. If the versions are the same, it's weird that you see the error on one but not on the other. I've no idea about it right now.\n\nOn the other hand, I can reproduce the style issue.\n.

I cannot reproduced it.\nPlease try if you can compile this sample file:\n\n```\n// g++ -std=c++0x tmp.cpp\n// tmp.cpp\n#include <iostream>\nint main()\n{\n  auto i = 1;\n  std::cout << i << std::endl;\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n. Maybe you can try to remove the line of checking c++0x in CMakeLists and see if it works.\n. Please follow https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md and provide more information\n. Did you read the section about reporting bugs?\nTo attach files, you can upload them to cloud storage services and post the links here.\nFor plain text, you may use github gists.\n. The pdf2htmlEX and depended libraries you are using are too old. Please try newer ones.\n. No, fontforge is still 20120731, which is too old.\n. Actually fontforge has been moved to github, and a version had been released a few weeks ago. \n\nBut I'd recommend staying with the git version.\n. @sathishks  Oh sorry I thought I had replied, but I didn't.\n\nYes, that's the new official website for fontforge, please find latest version there.\n. Indeed all function names have been optimized. But probably the best way is to define externs files for the closure compiler, or through annotations.\n. The JS code provided in pdf2htmlEX is mainly for reference purpose, also to provide a default UI, especially for lazy page loading.\nIt seems to me that most users prefer to use their own UI code, at least an overhaul of the JS code in pdf2htmlEX. So I think currently it's not quite useful to expose the API -- which is not actually not maintained and likely to be changed.\n\nOf course you are welcome to hack the code yourself. In case that many users find the JS code useful, I think there will be a set of API defined then.\n. The script used to generate the demo files is here: https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/blob/gh-pages/demo/gen.sh\n\nAnd indeed they were generated with an earlier version of pdf2htmlEX\n\nYou can file issues if the files are not working on Midori, just make sure to follow the instructions mentioned in wiki. And note that Midori is not official supported.\n. OK, I'll try to install midori and take a look.\nI really do not remember the revision for the demo, maybe you can deduct from the commit and date\n. Seems that the reason is midori does not support fancy.css well, although I have not pin-pointed the exact rule.\nYou can disable fancy.css and try again.\n. seems so\n\nhttp://caniuse.com/woff\n\nOn Fri, Dec 27, 2013 at 11:12 AM, d0ptnow notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> pdf2htmlEX --optimize-text 0 --external-hint-tool=ttfautohint\n> --font-format ttf --fit-width 1024 geneve_1564.pdf\n> \n> This config makes the fonts work on android stock browser.

Merged.\nThanks!\n. @dsablic Wondering if you could take a look at #350?\n. Fixed.\n. I wonder if I didn't make it clear in the previous comments, but you are targeting at mingw instead of win32. So let's use macros for mingw instead of windows. I remember that under some circumstance cygwin also defines `_WIN32`\n\nAbout mkdtemp, here are a few workaround I've found, maybe you can take a look\nhttps://github.com/lambourg/libgit2/commit/537de0889cb2c7b2f964f276e932f74594863371\nhttp://www.tomatosoft.biz/blog/2013/05/22/solution-to-missing-mkstemp-when-you-are-compiling-under-mingw/\n\nI don't want header files like `windows.h` to be included, it'll make the code harder to maintain, and it may also show that functions provided by mingw are not fully utilized.\n\nAnd I guess that a separate file for the new functions is not necessary.\n. I did not mean that windows.h should not be recursively included. I meant it's better not explicitly include it in pdf2htmlEX. It's the implementation detail of mingw to include it or not.\n\nMaybe it works for cygwin, but why? It already works fine with cygwin.\n. Looks much better now. Thank you very much!\n. Try to update your fontforge, which seems to be too old.\nIf that does not work, please provide the PDF file.\n\nSplit pages have to be read on a HTTP server, viewing local files won't work. You can set up a local HTTP server if you want.\n. No. that was 2 years ago. There is a new version released a few weeks ago, but usually I recommend to stay with git.\n. In theory the program should never crash, even for malformed input, in which case the program should show messages about it instead of crashing. So it is a bug if you see seg fault.\n\nOn the other hand, I cannot reproduce the crash. Please leave this issue open if you still see the crash with latest fontforge, otherwise you may close it.\n. Please post questions in the mailing list, read wiki for more detail.\n. Please provide more information as described in the wiki.

The warning is not harmful.\nBut I'm not sure about the message aboug gww_iconv_open\n\nIs this the same as #288?\n. Are there anything wrong in the output?\n. I guess it's harmless then. I found that it's reported inside Fontforge, but I'm not quite sure about the reason.\n. I cannot reproduce with your example PDF file. On which page does the issue occur?\n\nBTW, you might need to update your pdf2htmlEX, which is too old.\n. There is no such options for that right now, I guess it's not in the scope of pdf2htmlEX.\n\nOn the other hand, you may modify the source code or post-processing the images for your need.\n. pdf2htmlEX read information from PDF, which does not preserve such information generally. \n\nI'm not sure if tagged pdf in the newer version supports it though.\n. Please try if you can open that file using other utilities from poppler.\n. Do you see the  same error messages when you open the file with poppler tools?\n. I cannot reproduce it, please make sure to update pdf2htmlEX and poppler.\n. Fixed.\n. About issue 1, you may try `pdffonts` on your files. If the PDF file refer to external file (might be restricted MS font in your case), the actually rendering will depend on the renderer's environment. So this could be normal.\n\nI'm not sure about issue 2, maybe you can provide a sample file?\n. `tounicode` is not used for remove special characters, and it might not be possible to do so if relevant information are not stored in PDF.\n. No for now. You can call pdf2htmlEX with `-f` and `-l` using scripts though.\n. I can reproduce it, but it might be a bug in Fontforge. I'll spend more time on it.\n. Sorry for the long delay btw, I've been quite busy.\n. Hmm. Latest FontForge does not crash.\nWait for #358.\n. Can you build pdf2htmlEX with standard building instructions?\n. @spl Thanks!\n. The output of pdf2htmlEX should be completely valid HTML, so not sure what you mean by compatibility.\n\nIndeed the output might be too complicated for most HTML parser/processors, while I'm trying to simplify the structure for the sake of rendering performance, but currently it's not a main concern to adjust for other HTML processors.\n. Hmm.. in that case, it would be difficult to support it, as there could be too many ways of defining those tags. \n. Please specify the following information:\n- The version of poppler you have insalled\n- If you can find `poppler-config.h` in the location where you installed poppler\n- Full cmake log\n. The weird thing is that there's nothing about poppler mentioned in cmake log, which should not happen. I doubt if that's full cmake log.\n. If you have compile the code before, try to remove cmake cache before executing cmake.\n. Probably you need also to setup other env variables, please refer to the wiki article about building.\n. @backwater can you please create a new issue for that?\n. Seems that fontforge no longer uses its custom version of `calloc`.\nI've just fixed it, please try the latest commit.\nThanks for reporting.\n. I cannot find the post in the mailing list (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pdf2htmlex), could you find you post and post a link here?\n. Sorry for the long delay, I've been quite busy.\nI can reproduce this issue, but the cause is still mysterious to me. I'll need to spend more time on it.\n. I'll try to add a new option for rendering annotation.\n. A new option has been added: `--process-annotation`. Please try.\n. fontforge recently changed their build system, probably you should run ./bootstrap first.\nIf that's not working, perhaps you can find help in the fontforge project site.\n. `core` means pdf2htmlEX crashed.\nThe version of fontforge you are using is too old, please update it.\n. I cannot reproduce it, please reopen if it still crashes with latest depended libraries.\n. fontforge should not longer call gcalloc, I suspect that you have an old version of fontforge installed, and the newly installed version is not correctly configured.\n. Actually I saw another one reporting a similar issue. What's the output of `locate glib.h`?\n. Please try my fork if it still doesn't work, as described in https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Building\nAlso please reopen the issue if necessary. \n. I'm not quite sure about these error messages. Please report to the fontforge community.\n. Sorry I've been very busy recently. I'll update the PPA as soon as I can.\n. I found it difficult to pack a recent version of Fontforge. I wonder if any one could help.\nFor now, please refer to https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/blob/master/.travis.yml as a rough instruction to build on Ubuntu.\n. @djvs  at which step will it fail without libltdl ? It could be the problem that I could not build the Fontforge package. Thanks!\n. @uttamk If you go through the issues of pdf2htmlEX, most crashes are caused by outdated Fontforge. It has been nearly 2 years now, and many bugs have been fixed.\n. Another failed try today. [log](https://launchpadlibrarian.net/177118116/buildlog_ubuntu-saucy-i386.fontforge_20140101~pdf2htmlEX-0ubuntu1~saucy1_FAILEDTOBUILD.txt.gz)\nProbably I won't spend more time on this recently. \n. @pengux It could be good idea, but I'm not familiar with it myself. I'd like to include it in the wiki if anyone is interested.\n. Thanks @klokoy , if you can help maintain the image, can you add it to the wiki page \"download\" ? \n. Fixed, finally\n. @Siddhant I'll upgrade my ubuntu and test it before uploading the package.\n. @Siddhant Just found that Utopic is not supported by Fontforge PPA, so we might need to wait for a while.\n. @Siddhant Thanks!\n. Yeah, it's been an old issue (https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/issues/64), I have a solution in mind, but just have not enough time to implement it.\n. 0.11 does not work with latest poppler. Please try the latest git version.\n. Hi, I still don't got time to try on latest fontforge. I'll come back as soon as I have it tested.\nBtw, could you quote the error message? It's rather hard to read right now.\n. What's the output of `locate glib.h`?\n. Btw, I tested with latest fontforge, it works.\n. So you need to install glib header files, not sure how you got fontforge compiled without it.\n. You need to install the headers files. Please check the dependencies of\nfontforge\n\nOn Mon, Mar 10, 2014 at 7:02 PM, sathishks notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> I have installed glib-2.0 package .locate glib i got glib path.but locate\n> glib.h returns empty value.\n> \n> ## \n> \n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/issues/312#issuecomment-37171304\n> .\n. 140313 is fine, the warning message is harmless, it's because fontforge has change the version format. I'll fix it later.\n. It seems that the font embedded in the PDF is rejected by Fontforge, mostly likely the font is malformed but I'm not quite sure so far.\n. For the fontforge issue, not sure if you can find any clue in config.log. But anyway 20120731 is too old, you might want to try the latest version\n\nFor poppler, you can find the version define in poppler-config.h, located in where you have installed it.  poppler is a library, or a set of tools, there's no single program named poppler, instead most tools are called `pdf***`, for example `pdftocairo`, `pdffonts` etc.\n\nI'm not sure how to test the libraries other than running `fontforge` or `pdffonts`.\n. PPA is for ubuntu only, although you might be able to install them with hacking.\n. Please reopen if necessary.\n. Oops, that's a typo in the css. `base.min.css` should be the same for all files. Just fixed.\n. Did you try different values for `--tounicode` ?\n. Just try both 0 and 1 for the `--tounicode` parameter.\n. Oh, it should be 1 and -1\n. Yes, there are issues building with latest fontforge. I'm trying to fix them.\n. While trying to fix this issue, I found even more issues regarding compiling...\n\nPlease try my fork (as described in https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Building) and see if it works. \n. What concerns me is that the user might be actually using the latest fontforge for other reasons.\n. \u53ea\u6709\u9875\u9762\u548c\u4e3bhtml\u5206\u79bb\u65f6\u624d\u4f1a\u51fa\u90a3\u4e2a\u52a8\u753b\u3002\u53e6\u5916\u90a3\u4e2a\u52a8\u753b\u4e0d\u662fgif\u3002\n. \u5927\u6982\u662f`pdf2htmlEX --split-pages 1`\uff0c\u53c2\u8003\u4e00\u4e0bwiki\u3002\u53e6\u5916\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u52a0\u8f7d\u592a\u5feb\u4e86\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c1d\u8bd5\u8c03\u6574\u670d\u52a1\u5668\uff0c\u8ba9\u9875\u9762\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e45\u4e00\u4e9b\n. Looks like something wrong in a recent commit in Fontforge.\n. You may try to downgrade your fontforge, and bisect to find the exact commit that causes the issue.\n. I tried to reproduce the issue, but found out that the file link is dead. Can you update it?\n. @sathishks \nHmm.. I can no longer access the files? Could you upload it again if you want further tests? Or you can just close this issue.\nMeanwhile you can check https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Troubleshooting-Crashes , which might help to isolate the font files and find the real cause.\nI just checked your issue (i.e. 1296) on FontForge, which is not really helpful. You need to provide the font file for them to debug, and pdf2htmlEX is not relevant there.\n. I've got no experience on homebrew, but it seems to be something wrong with the dependencies in homebrew, e.g. poppler requires png15 but freetype requries png16.\n\nProbably you can try to downupgrade some packages.\n. Please try to build from source, if you cannot reproduce the issue from that, it might be better to report the issue to homebrew.\n. As I remember, in PDF fonts do not have an attribute as 'normal' or 'bold', variants are just considered as different fonts. But the flag may still exists in the font file, which will be then interpreted by browsers.\n\nBesides that flag, it's also possible to declare the weight in `@font-face`, I'm not sure how browsers decide the weight when one or both exist. E.g. in your case, 'bold' is declare in the font file but not in `@font-face`\n\nActually pdf2htmlEX guesses the style (see https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/blob/master/src/HTMLRenderer/font.cc#L1071) and tries to declare them in CSS. But basically it's based on font names.\n\nI think it's better to follow the standard, but I think webkit should be good on this. Does it only happen on QtWebkit, or also for other browers/engines? \n. Can you provide a sample PDF file for testing?\n. There seems to be too many aspects of post-processing the images, and a single parameter cannot fulfill everyone's needs. \n\nI might go for #174 , such that users may inject whatever they want in that phase. But unfortunately I got little time myself to implement it for now.\n. Merged to #174 \n. Please provide the sample file and relevant info as described in the wiki.\n. I cannot reproduce this. Please make sure that you have `poppler-data` installed.\nAlso the converted HTML is only 996kb in my case.\n. The message is saying that you don't have fontforge installed, or the version installed is too old.\nDue to the complexity of different distributions, and my limited time, it's not quite possible for me to maintain building instructions/commands. I've wrote general instructions on https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Building\n\nOn the other hand you are required to get familiar with the system prior to using this tool, if you are not, better places to ask for help would be forums or websites like stackoverflow.\n.

That would be too old. \nI've just update the [building instructions](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Building). Please update your fontforge.\n.

Oh seems that you are using Windows, in case that you don't have pdffonts, please provide the PDF file instead.\n. No I did not see it.\n. Please upload it to some online storage service and post a link back here.\n. It turns out that all fonts in the PDF file are external.\nI've created a wiki page explaining the details:\nhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Font-Files#embed-or-not\n. It doesn't seems to be a general feature so I don't think it will be included in pdf2htmlEX.\n\nBut you can do it with some javascript code, to change the font style in CSS, as long as you can locate the section.

On the other hand, since it's all about fontforge, I'd suggest you report it to fontforge developers. I'm not quite sure what's going on here. \n. I double if you are using my fork, there should not be any reference to `xalloc.h`. What's the commit you are using?\n. There's no special parameter necessary.\n\nCan you compare the `fontforge.h` installed and the one in the repo? I don't see a reference to `xalloc.h`.\n.

I'm having trouble with that.\n. @seebrown the zip file you mentioned is not the pdf2htmlEX branch, but I guess you are using that branch since you can build pdf2htmlEX along with it.\n\nAnd also @lystor , please allow some time before I can reach my build environment, that machine's broken right now.\n. I can reproduce the crash, and it's likely to be something wrong in FontForge.\nCan you go through https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Troubleshooting-Crashes ?\n. You don't need `test.py`, it's for testing.\nThe error message means you didn't install pdf2htmlEX.\nAnd there's no file called `pdfwhtmlex.py`\n.

I suspect that the crash happened in fontforge, you may try to open those font files (mostly likely the last one) in the tmp dir and try to convert them with fontforge.\nI don't have access to my build environment so I'm afraid that I cannot verify it myself.\n. @djdiego88 So clearly it's a bug of fontforge, can you report it to the fontforge developers?\n. Please make sure to provide the relevant files while submitting a bug to FontForge.\nThis link might help:\nhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Troubleshooting-Crashes\n. Hmm. Latest FontForge does not crash.\nWait for #358.\n. I think the error message is pretty clear: just go head and install the dependencies.\n. I'd suggest you try to build the official fontforge (although it cannot be linked with pdf2htmlEX) and see if it works. If it doesn't, it'd better to report to the fontforge developers.\n. Not quite sure, but it looks like a bad installation of glib, or misconfiguration of the env variables.\n. Hi @ritchiea  which version of fontforge are you using?\nAnd what's the path of your 'glibconfig.h'.\n. Maybe it's about the path delimiter. Try using `/`\n. OK :)\n. Hmm.. any other error messages you might find helpful? I cannot tell from only `Error 1` and `Error 2` here.\n. @shalecraig check your message, you don't have fontforge installed that is new enough\n. That's an older version, which is not compatible with latest poppler.\n. I've just tried compiling pdf2htmlEX with the git version of poppler (on Linux), and there was no problem.\nPlease make sure to update pdf2htmlEX to latest version and try again. And feel free to reopen the issue when you have more information.\n. Actually I don't know how to specify `libpoppler??` with `>=`\n. > And it the library is automatically imported in the dependencies in the binary package with the version it has be build with (required anyway): \n\nCan you please tell me how it works? No idea how they are 'automatically imported'\n\nThere seems to be a problems though, as you mentioned the automatically imported dependency is `poppler >= 0.24.5`, which is too high.\n. Closed due to #346 \n. try a larger value for heps\n. `--heps` is already a fault tolerance for spaces. There reason that you see so many tags is because they are spaces of different widths, say 1cm, 2cm or 3cm etc. If a standard space is 2cm, and `--heps` is small, then only 2cm spaces will be replaced with a space character; when `--heps` is at least `1cm`, all spaces between 1cm and 3cm will be replaced with a space character.\n\nI don't have a better solution yet, can you propose one?\n. You mean to use multiple characters for a single space?\n. It was designed so to maintain correct text, whenever you select some text and copy them out, they will remain the same as in the PDF. Multiple characters will break it.\n\nAlso I'm not sure if this will actually help that much, suppose that each space char s 1cm, then 2-space-char  will only help for 2cm spaces. How about 1.5cm space then?\n\nCan you also provide a sample PDF file?\n. letter-spacing has been considered already, which doesn't help a lot.\n\n> Usually people don't type one and a half spaces.\n\nThis is not true,  for example LaTeX often take care of [each single space](http://coolwanglu.github.io/pdf2htmlEX/demo/demo.html) to make it perfect.\n. So, can you provide some sample PDF files for analysis?\n\nOn Fri, Jun 6, 2014 at 5:08 PM, djvs notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Sure, but in other contexts besides LaTeX, spacing is usually uniform for\n> a\n> text field, relative to character width.

This file seems to be produced by LaTeX. Try `pdfinfo` on it.\n. I see. There were people doing the same thing AFAIK.\nThe output of pdf2htmlEX was not designed to be easily edited, and I don't have a good solution for that without breaking the format. \n\nThere are on going work trying to minimize the number of elements while minimizing the change in format, but I don't have enough time to finish it.\n. No I'm afraid, it was a prototype and not finished.\n. Seems that there was a bug about `heps`, which has been fixed in #375, please test the latest `incoming` branch and see if that helps.\n\n@peterpisljar are you using font hinting tools?\n. @peterpisljar If you were testing on Chrome on Windows, it has poor font rendering. Otherwise could you file a separate issue?\n\nGenerally the `<span>` tags are actually reflecting the information in PDF, and I don't have a good solution to remove them without hurting the format. \n\nSee also #418, hopefully there will be a PDF optimizer that 'tags' PDF file with recognized text lines and paragraphs.\n. I'm not familiar with owncloud, so please be specific about the features.\nBtw, please post questions to the mailing list instead of here. Issue tracker is used to track bugs of the source code.\n.

Thanks!\n\nI wonder if we can also remove png jpeg and fontforge in this way. \n\nCannot test it myself right now, sorry.\n. I realized that it might make sense, as png and jpeg are actually depended by libpoppler, and they are not directly depended by pdf2htmlEX.\n\nCould you please also remove them and I'll merge then.\nThanks!\n.

But latest PDF standard might support some), so it's not an easy job.\n\nGenerally please post to the mailing list for discussion.\n. I remembered that I've left a note at the [wiki page](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Download)\nSee #310 \n. Thanks for reporting!\n\nHopefully the author of that PR would show up and test it again, as poppler might have been changed during this period.\n\nIt'd be OK to add a new option, but I'd be better to figure out the actual meaning/effects, or it will be only a blind switch.\n\nBTW, the `Cairo***` files in the pdf2htmlEX repo might not match the latest version of poppler, wondering if you have tried a matching set of them?\n. Still need some time before I can access my build env. \nLater I will also update the CairoOutpuDev files.\n. OK I'll just revert it.\n. A quick googling suggested that it might be MacOS specific, but I've never seen this message before myself.\n. If the rendering remains the same, it's unlikely that the engine is wrong. You might want to inspect the elements and check if the bounding boxes (using the width value you specified) just match the text. If so, it should be correct.\n. The width you saw is not essentially the width of the box, because they are not in the same coordinate system.\n. It's the correct width, but may be in a different coordinate system. If you\nare familiar with PDF internals, you should know the transformations stuffs.\n\nYou need also check the transformation matrix while you want to check the\nwidth, for example the text might be zoomed or rotated.\n\nOn Wed, May 28, 2014 at 8:36 PM, Thomas Buick notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> The width i use is the:\n> HTMLTextLine->width\n> \n> Is there a more appropriate one ?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/issues/351#issuecomment-44400357\n> .\n. Do you think it's a bug, or the source code is unclear (need more comments)\n. In the `share` folder, you will see the original css files, you can just copy them to where you have installed pdf2htmlEX, and override the installed files.\n\nProbably it's better to add a switch for this later.\n. Oh, did you mean that pdf2htmlEX is generating minified and not minified css files on different machines?\n. It seems that you are using different versions of pdf2htmlEX, which might explain the difference.\n\nAnd by overriding installed files, I meant to change the filename accordingly; or you can change the manifest file.\n. If you built them from the git repository instead of stable releases, the version remains the same for a bunch of commits.\n.

In my opinion this is a good feature, but the way you implemented might be too dirty.\nI don't like the idea of doing the fallback in `CairoBackgroundRenderer`, a cleaner way is to do that outside them: \n\n```\nauto img = cairo_renderer.render();\nif(too_large(img))\n    img = splash_render.render();\n```\n\nAnother thing is that counting the number of `<`'s might be too hacky, are there any other ways to do thing, for example you can stop processing once you see too many tags generated.\n. Better not touch `CairoOutputDev` files, these files are directly copied from poppler, which will be synced time to time. It's done like this because they are not exposed in poppler's API.\n\nI do believe that counting '<' should work, it's just not that elegant.\n\nAnother way is just exit with an error message when there are too many nodes, and let the user to re run the program.\n. Instead of using bitmap or something, the coordinator does not need to know\nthe details, it could be\n\n```\ncairo_dev.render();\nif(!cairo_dev.ok())\n   splash_dev.render();\n```\n\nHow about this?\n\nOn Sat, Jun 7, 2014 at 12:25 AM, Duan Yao notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> I see, I'll keep CairoOutputDev untouched.\n> \n> svg_nodes_limit is applied to individual pages, and only pages' with too\n> many svg nodes' fall back to bitmap bg, other pages are not affected, so\n> that the overall quality will not be degraded too much.\n> So exit-and-re-run is not an alternative.\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/pull/356#issuecomment-45403769.\n.

I just fixed it on the incoming branch, please have a try.\nCan I use this PDF file for a test case, which will be included here: https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX-tests\n. @yu-liang-kono OK, I'll try to make one myself then.\n. I think the PR is ready now.\nAgain, I think the features are quite useful.\nThank you very much for your efforts!\n. :)\n. Thanks for the patch! This is one of the most wanted features.\n\nSorry I do not got enough time to read through the patch right now, will do that later.\nHere are some thoughts.\n- I see implementation in DrawTracer replies on cairo, but I really hope it will be universal.\n- I remember that `SplashOutputDev` has an api to check the bounding box of area changed, we might take advantage of that.\n- Didn't check how you are handling text that are partially covered.\n- CSS drawing can be removed that, it was just an early experiment.\n- Indeed we might need to store the elements, analyze the visibility and draw that again. Not sure how to do that.\n\nHere are some other ways of doing this\n\n:one:We can mix rendering of text and images, and let the browser handle it. For example\n\n``` html\n<div> text1 </div>\n<img> image 1</img>\n<div> text2 </div>\n<img> image 2</img>\n```\n\nBut this might need quite some efforts.\n\n:two:We can just generate a whole bg image with all the text, and put a transparent text layer on top of it. It's actually just the `fallback` mode. This is definitely stupid for raster images, but not sure about svg.\n. I mean that patch would make `cairo` a hard dependency, which is optional now.\nThis might be a good time to investigate crocodoc again, I'll do that.\n. @duanyao Let me see later if we can use functions inside poppler.\n. I think this feature makes more sense for the bitmap backend, i.e. `splash`, because the background image might not be easily broke up.\n\nAt some point we might move forward to the svg backend, and in this case, I think it might makes more sense to break the background image into parts and actually make them overlap with each other in HTML, as mentioned above. \n\nAnother way of tackling this is to render a hidden text layer and a full svg -- but we export the fonts in the current way and use them inside SVG -- which might sound clearer.\n. How about a chat some time, I'm not sure how I can help. Especially I really want to convince the poppler people to expose more about the CairoOutputDev interfaces.\n. @duanyao Shall we try #pdf2htmlEX at freenode? Not sure if you are available now.\n. I'll try to keep online in the next few hours :)\n. `correct` might look like an adjective instead of verb here, hmm...\nI don't like `check` now even if I proposed it.\n\nHow about `--text-visibility-accuracy`? I cannot come up with better ones... If you don't like it, please just use `--correct` or `--check`. Hopefully in the near future we don't even need an option for this.\n. Just FYI, I've just opened a new repo for test cases: https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX-tests\n\nWondering if you would like to submit one or more for this feature?\n. Thank you very much! I'll do some further code cleaning, e.g. removing css drawing.\n. @maxsdw It's been landed in git, so you can try the latest master branch.\n. @cdeblois Yes it's included. Please find a new issue for the compilation error.\n. #95 is more than 1 year ago, might be deprecated.\nAs the messages say, you don't have (a recent version of) fontforge installed, and your compiler does not support C++0x\n.

Looks good now.\nThanks!\n. Placing your question everywhere is not helpful. Let's discuss on the mailing list.\n. I wonder if you are using the `pdf2htmlEX` branch in the fork of fontforge.\n. `library_version_configuration` was part of fontforge when I forked its repo, but then it got removed.\nI'm afraid that I don't have a mingw available, maybe you can try the `incoming` branch of pdf2htmlEX plus the `master` branch of official fontforge.\n\nI'll test if I can make latest fontforge working on my Linux machine.\n. This is about poppler, please review the instructions in wiki about building from source.\nProbably your poppler is not recent enough, its API has kept changing.\n. Oh no sorry, indeed you need the lastest git code of pdf2htmlEX, the error you saw has been fixed, and pdf2htmlEX should support multiple versions of poppler.\n. What's the version of poppler you are using?\n. @jatmew  See https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/blob/master/src/util/unicode.cc#L122\nSince `mapNameToUnicodeText` is being compiled, there must be something wrong that cmake thought you are using a poppler later than 0.25.0. Or it's a bug somewhere in the detection.\n. @jatmew I'll try to test latest fontforge. Usually fontforge is not full tested for linking.\n. OK, glad to hear that.\nI have difficulties compiling the latest version of fontforge myself, not sure if it's because of some latest commits.\n. Good catch! Thanks!\n. To match some other fonts, you can replace the font in PDF with others. pdf2htmlEX, as a PDF converter, or viewer in some sense, does not have the rights to change the fonts.\n. @vivin I think I mentioned that in the building instruction. Where did you find it, maybe I missed some.\n. @vivin Yeah, makes sense. Just fixed it. Thanks.\n. OK :)\n. Thanks :)\n. \u770b\u4e0a\u53bb\u662f\u6ca1\u88c5`poppler-data`\uff0c\u4f60\u5b89\u88c5\u4e86\u5417?\n. @feixm \u4e4b\u524d\u4f3c\u4e4e\u6709\u4eba\u6709\u7c7b\u4f3c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u4f60\u641c\u7d22\u4e00\u4e0b\u3002\u6211\u8fd9\u91cc\u4e0d\u80fd\u91cd\u73b0\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5177\u4f53\u539f\u56e0\u4e0d\u592a\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u6211\u60f3\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bd5\u8bd5\u8bbe\u7f6eINCLUDE_PATH\u4e4b\u7c7b\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u3002\n. @feixm \u6211\u628a\u5173\u4e8eglib.h\u7684\u52a0\u5230wiki\u91cc\u4e50\uff0c\u6050\u6015\u662f\u4f60\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u91cc`/usr/include/glib-2.0`\u4e0d\u5728\u641c\u7d22\u8def\u5f84\u91cc\u3002\n. Most likely this is because the fonts inside the PDF are not well formed. Usually it takes more information to convert it for web than to render them directly.\nPlease also report your fontforge version.\n. @jatmew As I mentioned earlier, it's about font conversion (using Fontforge). Usually this happens when the fonts in the PDF files are malformed, but it might be something else since you've been testing on the demo files. I'll need more time to diagnose. \n. @jatmew It actually made more sense in 2013, when people were using latest git version at that time. AFAIK FontForge didn't have any official releases in 2013, so probably you can find some commit there, or maybe performance a git bisect if necessary.\n. @jatmew [This page](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Troubleshooting-Crashes) might help. You can dump the font files according to the instructions and ask in the fontforge community.\n. Usually Fontforge is not well maintained for linkage usage, so I won't expect all future releases of Fontforge are link-friendly. The latest git version of Fontforge has not been well tested (for pdf2htmlEX to link with), so I think it's better to keep the fork for now.\n. I think that fontforge is not well maintained for linking, so the future releases might not be guaranteed to work (to link with)\n. There has already been a `output-filename` option, it's like `pdf2htmlEX input.pdf output.whatever`\n. Thanks!\n. Hi @josch , thank you very much for your patches! \n\nI picked a few patches, and added you into the `AUTHORS` file. However it could be easier for us to discuss if you created pull requests.\n\nI'd like to explain a few of them I didn't apply:\n\n`use-rsvg` and the png files: right, technically speaking the svg files are source files and png files are generated from them. But these are logo files, which are unlikely to be changed in the future. I just included the svg file and the script for my (and possibly others') convenience. So I don't think it's that necessary to generate png after installation. Another consideration is that I want the png to be official, what if users generate different png files?\n\n`pdf.js`: `compatibility.js` is indeed from PDF.js, but I removed something from it that are not necessary here. I think it's better to keep this copy to make sure that it's always compatible with pdf2htmlEX.\n\n`closure` vs `yui-compressor`: it might look weird since I'm including both of them. But closure seemed to be better than yui-compressor on JS, yet it cannot handle CSS. So I'm using closure for JS and yui for CSS. \n\n`unused js file`: some supporting JS files are minimized before included in the output html file. But in HTML, it's very likely that the user want to examine the content, or to make changes, which cannot be done on minimized files. That's why I'm shipping those original source files even if they appear not to be used. Especially since the files might be changing time to time, it'll be painful for the users to find the files if not shipped in the first place.\n. @josch It's fine, I've merged them :) Thanks.\n\nI think using `compatiblity.js` from pdf.js would work, I only removed some lines not necessary, but the original version should still work.\n. Oh it should be GPLv3+, I'll fix them.\n. Fixed in the `incoming` branch.\n. Reopening #261 for this.\n. There should be a `xxx.html` generated as the loader, and you can check `pdf2htmlEX.js` for the mechanism.\n. Yes, the demo is `pdf2htmlEX.js`, which can be found in the source folder. It loads the split pages and renders them.\n. You can probably follow the guidance on the wiki and file a new issue.\n. Please follow the guide in the wiki, and provide a sample file.\n. Not sure if that's possible. Actually for some options, the default value is `auto`, and pdf2htmlEX tries to find the best value itself. But for others it might be difficult to tell 'which is best'. Especially fonts are handled by FontForge, so I have no access to the font info at all.\n\nOn the other hand, generally it's good to try to report the possible issues, and there are some warnings. If you can list a number of specific items, I might try to examine them and see if any of them can be implemented.\n. Probably you can modify the source code of pdf2htmlEX and compile it as a php module. Please refer to the php manual.\n. Looks like a duplicate of #342 \n. Please follow the instruction on wiki and provide more info.\n. @duanyao  Thanks! Let me try to update the `pdf2htmlEX` branch.\n. It seems that latest fontforge still crashes, reported fontforge/fontforge#1642\n. Fixed by #407.\n. This file uses type 3 fonts, so you need the `--process-type3` option. \nHowever seems that something wrong with the fonts, that cairo refuses to convert them.\n. Could you create a PR for this, and please add yourself in `AUTHORS`.\nBTW you may use `std::swap` for convenience.\n. Seems to be fixed. Cannot remember which commit though (or maybe in poppler).\n. Oh wait, it's not fixed. I made a mistake.\n. Right. I've included the fix in `incoming`. Can I use any PDF in that zip for a test case?\n. Thanks.\nAnd sorry for the long delay btw. I've been quite busy.\n. test case added.\n. It seems to be a bug of poppler, `pdftocairo -svg` also produces a blank svg.\n. I've submitted to poppler: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=82879\n. @davidhedley Can you confirm whether this issue is fixed with PR #408 ?\n. Why do we have 'padding' chars? I thought all the text are part of the original PDF?\n. Oh I see.\nHow about storing another array for the raw text?\n. @duanyao Oh right, I was wrong, I thought the two arrays are separate.\n\nActually I'm not satisfied with the current data structure, it was an easy hack in easy versions, just enough for output, but later I found it very difficult to optimize, due to it's complicated structures.\n\nMaybe a linked list of `union{ char, state, space}` would be better?\n. Oh I didn't mean 'linked' list, just a list, could be a vector etc. Sorry.\n\nI see `PDFChar` is good way of integrating state and characters, if multiple characters are sharing the same state, we can set `state` of the those following the first one to be `nullptr` or the same pointer as the first one.\n\nWhat are `decomposed_idx` and `offset`?\n. PR merged. Thanks!\n. If a pdf viewer can render it correctly, there must be a way of decoding it in a standard way. \nThere are relevant functions in poppler/Gfx, not sure if we can use that.\n\nI think that disabling dumping bitmap for CMYK would confuse users, as it's not obvious that the embedded images are CMYK or not.\n. @duanyao It makes sense. Could you describe this behavior in the manpage? Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. What's a 'token'?\nI feel it is not that easy to read this way, generally I saw\n\n```\n#if DEBUG\n   do something\n#endif\n```\n\nor\n\n```\nDEBUG_PRINT(\"%s\\n\", something)\n```\n\nBut your `DT_DEBUG` looks like a function, but it's not. Could be less readable than #if/#endif\n. Not sure if minimizing token would have any advantages for us.\n\nAbout 'mimic a function', it's for readability, the macro you defined looks like a function, but does something quite different than it appears. \n\nFor example\n\n```\nDEBUG(int i);\n.. something else ...\nDEBUG(cout << i);\n```\n\nIt's not obvious that DEBUG(int i) defines a local variable in the scope, and the lines are harder to read -- unless the reader find the definition of DEBUG\n\nOn the other hand, for the `#if DEBUG` and `DEBUG_PRINT` cases, I bet most reader can understand it just as normal statements.\n\nAnother reason would be, it hurts syntax highlighting.\n\nHope that it makes sense to you.\n. Oh, if those macros are only for your own debug purpose, probably you should not leave them there. I thought you might ask people to enable them and show you the message for diagnosis.\n. In that case, I think readability is more important, that's why we put so\nmuch efforts in comments and coding styles when we share code. What do you\nthink?\n\nOn Wed, Aug 6, 2014 at 1:23 AM, Duan Yao notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Not for normal users.

I just feel it very weird to define a local variable like `DEBUG(int i)`.\n\n`DEBUG(printf(...))` looks a little bit better, but why not `DEBUG_PRINT` etc?\n. How would you write a loop then\n\n```\nDEBUG(for(...) {)\nDEBUG(...)\nDEBUG(})\n```\n\nlike this?\n. I think that just hurts readability too much. \n\nActually I haven't noticed the printf inside until you use this multi-line versison. I guess DEBUG_PRINTF is enough for most cases, and elsewhere you could use #if. When would do you a single-line `DEBUG(...)` that is not printing something?\n\nAlso I've been thinking, if you want the messages from the users, maybe it makes more sense to make it a runtime option, either go directly with `--debug`, or using a mask for DrawTracer. Many users are actually using the binary directly.\n. By `DEBUG_PRINTF` I mean something like this\n\n```\n#define debug_printf(...) fprintf (stderr, __VA_ARGS__)\n```\n\nDo you think a function is better than this form?\nBut indeed you are right about `cerr`, not sure how to do that with a macro.\n\nI was just thinking about creating a 'unified' function for debug messages and discourage the usage of single_line macros.\n\nAlso I think a macro for multi-line statements would also be a good switch for `debug_printf`, or your `DT_DEBUG`, could be better than switching comments.\n\nUsually for multi-line debug stuffs, I'd also enclose them with a scope, just to make sure that the local variable won't pollute the outside:\n\n```\n#if DT_DEBUG\n{\n  int i;\n  do something with i;\n  cerr << i;\n}\n#endif\n```\n\nMy recommendation would be, it's fine if you want to stick with `DT_DEBUG`, but never use it with multiple lines, especially do not define local variables there.\nInstead, use another macro, say `DRAWTRACER_DEBUG` for multi-line stuffs, and either enclose the content with a scope, or use special names to make sure that it won't affect other parts.\nAlso `DRAWTRACER_DEBUG` could be a switch of `DT_DEBUG`, and actually why not use a shorter name for `DT_DEBUG`? say `D`?\n. It could be like this\n\n```\n#define LOG(msg) if(GLOBAL_LOG_MASK & THIS_LOG_MASK) printf(msg)\n```\n\nThen we define `THIS_LOG_MASK` in each .cpp file.\n\nOr more easily, we can define `ENABLE_LOG` for each cpp file we want to enable log, somewhat like `assert`\n. How about `constexpr bool`?\n. @duanyao It's a compile-time constant.\n. It's the same I think. \n. Merged.\nThanks!\n. The error message is hard to read. Please reformat it.\n. It seems that your compiler does not support C++11 lambda, which one are you using?\n. You can of course try to compile a simple C++ program with lambda.\nIf you are not sure, just update your compiler to a recent version.\n\nregards,\n- Lu\n\nOn Tue, Aug 5, 2014 at 10:25 PM, itsjamil notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> I am using gcc.\n> \n> [root@centos6 ~]# gcc --version\n> gcc (GCC) 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 4.4.7-4)\n> Copyright (C) 2010 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n> This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.

A wild guess, if you install poppler manually, the shared object will go in `/usr/local/lib`. If you can run pdf2htmlEx correctly, you might already have LD_LIBRARY_PATH set, but not sure why php is not following that.\nA quick fix would be just to install everything to `/usr` instead of `/usr/local`\n. Thanks for the patch!\nI just reviewed it, and found several places that are not fitting the conventions in pdf2htmlEX.\nAccording the email, would you like me to put more comments such that you can change, or do you want me to rewrite base on your code?\n. Sorry for the delay, I've been quite busy in the past month.\nPlease review my comments.\n. BTW, could you change this PR to the `incoming` branch?\n. And, can you provide a test case to https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX-tests/ ?\n. You need also to add one item in the manifest file, and generate a\nreference image.\nPlease also run the test suite to make sure that your patch does not lead\nto regression.\n\nOn Sat, Nov 15, 2014 at 12:09 AM, Simon Chenard notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> For the test suite : do I only need to add a file in the files/ folder\n> (grey and one page only)?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/pull/413#issuecomment-63086957.\n. @afrosimon I've integrated a new test framework, so you need to add a pdf file, add a new `test_**` in `test_conversion.py`, and generate a new reference image via `P2H_TEST_GEN=1 ./test.py test_**`\n. Thanks!\n. Please provide the file and the command line you used.\n. I cannot reproduce it.  But just a guess, if you are using `--split-page` and open the files with `file://` instead of `http://`, there might be a program for some browsers.\nDoes it occur to all the browsers?\n. The preprocessor only check text, I don't remember there's anything related to images.\n\nCan you provide a sample file?\n. I guess that the file name of the logo image is changed into the format `bgxx.png` ( I cannot remember the exact template), such that when the logo image is introduced, it overwrites the background image of a page. This also explains why it occurs on the same page number.\n\nBut since I cannot reproduce it by all means, it could be something wrong in your configuration. can you show the manifest file?\n. @duanyao Thanks for the analysis!\n\nI cannot reproduce it after #414, @afrosimon could you test again with latest `incoming` branch?\n. @duanyao OK, I can reproduce it now. The `inline-block` rule is not only for whitespaces, but also for negative offsets, e.g.\n\n```\n<span>Hello <span style=\"margin-left:-10px\">World!</span></span>\n```\n\nI remember that without this rule, Things after `World` are not positioned correctly.\n. @duanyao It was for negative shifts, e.g. http://jsfiddle.net/v19q42nh/2/\nBasically after a negative shift, we want following letters to be place directly after the shift.\n\nIf it's getting overridden, it looks like a bug. \n. Yes I did actually.\nBut what shall we use without it?\n. @duanyao I see, and I remember that there is code for this: we don't close a `span` tag if it starts with negative margin until the end of the line. So instead of\n`<span style=\"margin-left:-1em\">Text</span><span class=\"class\">Other text</span>`\nwe do\n`<span style=\"margin-left:-1em\">Text<span class=\"class\">Other text</span></span>`\n\nSo probably we can modify the default style for `span` for now, and in the future we add more test cases to verify.\n. @davidhedley Can you suggest a workaround for this issue?\n. @afrosimon Seems that it's been fixed via #484. Can you verify this? Also is it ok to use this file as a test case in pdf2htmlEX?\n. There's no optimizations, but something might be done during font conversion.\n\nOne thing that might be relevant is that, in the preprocessing stage, pdf2htmlEX tries to collect all the characters used in the file. \n\nHave you tried different font formats?\n\nFor the test case it would be best if you create a public test case, which would be easier to track for everyone. \n. Should have been fixed.\n. No, there is not currently.\n. What about `/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/*fontforge*`\n. @micha-nerdlichter Now the latest fontforge can be used, if it cannot be compiled, please file a issue in their repo.\n. I cannot access the URL.\n. Could you upload it again?\n. Is it the same as #430 ?\n. Could you try to compile from source, or submit the issue to homebrew?\n. Please provide a sample input.\n. If there's a line of width 0.5px, and we zoom the PDF file by 2x when converting it to html, will it be 1px or 2px in the output?\n\nI think the best solution would be to create a new option, and set the default value to shape maybe.\n. Sorry for the delay. I think the patch is ready to merge. Please just change the PR from `master` to the `incoming` branch.\nThanks!\n. I heard that pdf2htmlEX had been included in several Gentoo overlays, not sure if they are still working.\n. Oh I see. Thanks!\n. It seems that Fontforge has update such that pdf2htmlEX can be linked with the latest version now.\n. Thanks!\n. I see only a epub file there. Please try the latest `incoming` branch.\nIf the problem still exists, please upload the file again and provide a link here.\n. The error message seems to come from ttfautohint. Is there a difference if you do no use ttfautohint?\n. The font may not look well without ttfautohint, especially on Windows.\nPlease make sure that you are using the latest version of ttfautohint, and please consider filing a bug to ttfautohint if the problem still exists.\n. I'm closing this as it's duplicate of #349 \nIt seems that for some period of time I can no longer maintain the ubuntu ppa. If you can help maintain it, please set up a ppa and post the link on the wiki. Thanks!\n. No, while you can easily generate thumbnails with other tools like `pdftocairo`.\n. Can you try to isolate the font file according to https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Troubleshooting-Crashes ?\nIf it's caused by font files, please test with fontforge.\n. Most likely it means the encoding in the PDF file is corrupted.\n. See #213 \n. @moshere  I meant this is a known issue.\n. Is any of `glib.h` in your search path for header files?\n. Search paths are defined such that the compiler can find pre-defined system header files. The files have to be located in those folders, or to be specified via commandline  options, in order to be found.\n. @duanyao What do you think now?\n. For the new parameter, can you provided a test case to https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX-tests/\n. @davidhedley I agree with @duanyao , that it takes less efforts, and could be safer to implement the counting in `setMimeData`. One downside is that this depends on the internal behavior of CairoOutputDev, which might be changed in the future, but it won't be too much a problem with proper test cases.\n. @davidhedley I've finished test framework, can you add a test case for this?\n. @davidhedley For now, please add one in `test_naming.py`, since this involves checking the output files. I'll rename the files later.\n. I'm about to merge this, but we need a test case for the patch.\n. @davidhedley  Oh I see, take your time. If you find anything not intuitive while adding test cases, please let me know. \n. `--space-as-offset` may not guarantee to work if either the ToUnicode mapping for the font encoding is corrupted.  In fact I had a few test cases before, where the font encoding is OK yet ToUnicode is missing or corrupted. According to my experience, there are more issues in the ToUnicode mappings, especially for old PDF files. \n\nSeems that old PDF generators/converters were not able to handle this well -- after all this has nothing to do with printing. And ToUnicode is indeed optional in the standard.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a good solution. Or possible we can take consideration of the `--to-unicode` parameter, that whether we trust the mapping.\n. Further, I'm planning to disable `DrawTracer` completely when `ENABLE_SVG` is off:\n- Fontforge now depends on cairo, so probably cairo will be mandatory in the future\n- In the future DrawTracer may not depend on cairo any more \n. Closing it as it does not seem to be necessary for now.\n. Fixed.\n. Most likely your compiler might bee too old. Which version is it?\n. cmake is not a compiler. I meant your c++ compiler.\n2014-11-18 \u4e0b\u53481:41\u4e8e \"tonypius\" notifications@github.com\u5199\u9053\uff1a\n\n> My cmake compiler version is 2.8..

I wonder if it's solved now.\n. travis is failing because of test cases.\nWhich script do you mean?\n. Did you add the Fontforge PPA (https://launchpad.net/~fontforge/+archive/ubuntu/fontforge)?\nIf not, please add it, update the packages and see if it helps.\n\nI thought the Fontforge PPA should be automatically dependency by pdf2htmlEX PPA, but maybe not.\n. I've copied the fontforge packages into pdf2htmlEX PPA. Please try again.\nPlease close the issue if it's fixed.\n. Done.\n. I cannot access the link. I got a \"403 Forbidden\" error.\n\nUsually letter spacing comes from the original PDF file, unless text optimization is turned on. \n. I can reproduce it. Yet given the size of the pdf file, especially the image with high resolutions, I don't think the cpu usage is too high.\n. flatten is a step of processing fonts in pdf2htmlEX. Can you provide a sample PDF file?\n. Just fixed in `incoming`.\n. I'll test again.\n. OK.\n. @IvanSolovjev Did the `master` branch not work for you?\n. No\uff0c this is not a PDF viewer would do. You may need to manipulate the file yourself.\n. @duanyao how about creating a repo on GitHub, and let user provide files using pull requests. Might be easier to make reference that way.\n\nAbout this issue, I will add code to show warning when `--space-as-offset` is used on such fonts.\n. @duanyao I can create the repo. Anonymous submits will not be allowed, and we may add license stuffs to allow us to use the files as test cases. How about that?\n. Can you provide a sample input?\n. I can no longer access the URL. Can you upload it again?\n. I tested with you PDF file.\n\nThe first page uses a CID Type0 OpenType font, which was not supported by pdf2htmlEX before. And I've just fixed in the `incoming` branch.\n\nFor the rest 2 pages, unfortunately seems that the font files used cannot be supported by poppler. You may not be able to view the files correctly with a PDF viewer using poppler. You may report a bug to poppler if you like :)\n\nThanks for reporting, can I use the PDF file as a test case for pdf2htmlEX?\n. Remarks on poppler, there's a warning `Syntax Warning: Mismatch between font type and embedded font file`, so it could be something wrong in the PDF file instead.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks! Let me take a look.\n. Thanks for the PR! It looks in good shape to me, just need a few more modifications.\n\nIt seems that Travis CI failed with this patch, can you find the reason? Are you able to run the test cases locally?\n. Oh, and don't forget to add yourself to `AUTHORS` :)\n. @afrosimon the `SAUCE` stuff is protected, so probably only I can test it, and I will do it.\nSo don't worry about the test cases, I'll take it here.\n\nPlease add yourself to `AUTHORS`\n. Looks good to me now. Thanks for your effort!\nI'll try to fix the tests.\n. @afrosimon I found that the test case you provided triggers #483, I wonder if you can provided a simpler test case, just to fix the auto tests.\n. @afrosimon Yes, I will also use this file to test that bug. What I meant was to release a version before I fix this bug, as I didn't manage to solve it. \nBut seems that I have a potential solution now, so a 'simpler' case is not necessary for now. I will ask you again if I cannot fix #483. Thanks.\n. I cannot reproduce it. Please try the latest `incoming` branch.\n. It is possible to do that, but you might want to understand the css rules defined by pdf2htmlEX in order to hack them.\n. It seems that you need to hack the source code of pdf2htmlEX, or write an (external) post-processor for your task. Unfortunately it is not supported by pdf2htmlEX now. There are use cases integrating pdf2htmlEX's output in their web pages, and you might want to figure out how they did that. \n. @gabrieltong Is it solved now?\n. Hope it works for you.\nGenerally configure & install poppler is not relevant here.\n. I'm not sure if you have enabled --correct-text-visiblity without enabling svg, in which case bounding boxes will be used to estimated the border.\n\nOr, the image itself may be rectangular, although some part of it appear to be visually blank.\n\nCan you identify which situation it is?\n. There used to be such a feature, but removed, as it didn't work well.\nBut anyway this is kind of a 'PDF optimization' feature, which is not likely to be included in pdf2htmlEX in the future.\n. \u6211\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709windows\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bf7\u63d0\u4f9b\u6837\u4f8b\u8f93\u5165\u3002\n. Right, could be harder than I expected. I'll take a look.\n. Fixed in the incoming branch. Thanks!\n. I have no idea. You should probably ask Mediafire. \n. Just fixed in `incoming`.\n. Let's move the discussion to the mailing list.\n. This is not yet supported. You can convert single pages, but the resource files are not shared that way.\n. @duanyao I can mark it as 'illegal', and never output it in HTML, like what we did for other similar codes: https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/blob/incoming/src/util/unicode.cc#L51 \n. @djvs Can I use this PDF file as a test case for pdf2htmlEX?\n. Fixed in the incoming branch. Please have a try.\n. If we map it to space, there will be other weird stuffs, say, `word-space`.\n. In the context where both normal spaces, zero-width spaces are used, how can you map zero-width spaces to normal spaces?\n. What if normal spaces and zero-width spaces have different widths defined, as in the font files in PDF?\n. @duanyao  I see, so we can just apply `--space-as-offset` to those chars.\n. @djvs can you verify with the lastest vesrion? And can we use your PDF as a testcase?\n. @djvs  How about the PDF file as testcase?\n. @djvs  The screenshot looks good. About the PDF file, I meant we need to make sure that the PDF is available for us to included in the test suites of pdf2htmlEX. Is it the case?\n. Thanks.\n. I don't have environments with Windows, if it happens only for specific files, please provide a sample.\n. PPA is usually the stable version, which may not include the latest commits.\nHave you tried the latest git version?\n. It looks like something wrong in fontforge to me.\n. I cannot reproduce it on Mac, with Chrome or Firefox.\n. Sorry I didn't write it clearly. I converted the files in Linux, and viewed the output on Mac. I've got only a headless linux.\n. @duanyao Looks like #87, which I did not find a solution for.\n. @hermesramos One way of solving this kind of issue, is for you to set up a VM, installing a minimal Linux, and try to reproduce it. If you can, then I can receive the VM image and continue working on it. Otherwise you may try to find the difference between the VM and your problematic environment.\n. @hermesramos Since it says 2048, the VM will be no use to us. It shows that pdf2htmlEX would work in that VM (is the output of pdf2htmlEX in the VM correct?). In this case, you need to compare and find the cause. Well I'm thinking roughly the same as @duanyao, probably something wrong with your build of fontforge, could be old dependencies.\n. @hermesramos Oh I could be wrong. When you meant 2048, is that in the original environment, or the new VM?\n. Did it work with text visibility option?\n. @sathishks It seems that the version you are using is too old. Are you using the 0.12 release, or any (git) version before the release.\nAnyways, I'd recommend updating to the latest git version.\n. The latest version is 0.13\nhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/blob/incoming/CMakeLists.txt#L12\n\nMaybe you are not using the incoming branch?\n\nOn Fri, Mar 13, 2015 at 5:27 PM, sathishks notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> @coolwanglu https://github.com/coolwanglu : I am already using latest\n> version.\n> \n> version info:\n> \n> pdf2htmlEX -v\n> pdf2htmlEX version 0.12\n> Copyright 2012-2014 Lu Wang coolwanglu@gmail.com and other contributers\n> Libraries:\n> poppler 0.25.0\n> libfontforge 20140221\n> Default data-dir: /usr/local/share/pdf2htmlEX\n> Supported image format: png jpg\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/issues/480#issuecomment-78885554\n> .\n. Micro version number will be introduced to mark the git commits more precisely. Hopefully it will be useful.\n. I opened the file with Adobe Reader, and the content turn out to be visible.\n. I cannot reproduce it. Or it has been fixed in a recent commit in `incoming`.\nPlease reopen if the problem still exists for the `incoming` branch on your machine.\n. I cannot reproduce it. Please try the latest `incoming` branch. (and reopen if necessary)\n. Seems that it works well now. Thanks @duanyao !\n. Thanks!\n\nThe negative offsets were introduced for chars with kerning, e.g. when `T` and `r` are together, they are often putting closer. In that case, a 'negative space' is put between the characters, which does not work unless it is `inline`. \n\nSeems that you patch would disable it. While we can create new `div` for each character, by selecting and copying the text out we will get an extra newline in between. \n\nFor now I believe that a correct visual is more important that text selection, but it would be best to solve both.\n. I will create a test case.\n. There is another case, when we have `<span>some text<span class=\"_\"></span><span>Hello</span></span>`, with text optimization is on, the two inner spans will be merged, into something like `<span>some text<span \"margin-left:xxx\">Hello</span></span>`, and the inner span must be `inline-block` if `margin-left` is negative.\n\nOn the other hand, this optimization seemed not to be as useful as I expected. So I'll disable that trick and focus on the correctness of the layout.\n. Please wrap the output with ```\nWhich version are you using?\n. Just fixed in `incoming`. It should work with poppler 0.32 now.\n. \u6211\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u4e00\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b57\u4f53\u540d\u5982\u679c\u542b\u6709\u975e\u6cd5\u5b57\u7b26\uff0c\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u62d2\u7edd\u52a0\u8f7d\u5b57\u4f53\u3002\n\u521a\u521a\u5728incoming\u5206\u652f\u4fee\u6b63\u4e86\u3002\n. seems ok now. weird.\n. Wow, this is great. Thanks!\nCould you rebase to the latest incoming branch, as I just added one commit there.\n. Thanks @duanyao \nIt might make sense for Firefox to assume that the font are always well formed. But historically there are lots of PDF files with bad fonts. Yet the conversion by Fontforge is also not perfect.\n\nPersonally I'm not good at nor interested in these edge-case font issues. How about properly label them and see it will affect other people?\n. Should have been fixed.\n. Thanks for the patch! Maybe we can enabled it also for `--space-as-offset`, or just wait until such kind of PDF files emerge.\n\nOne thing I don't quite like is that touching `Cairo*` is not recommended, would make it harder to maintain.\n\nI feel that this patch adds too many states/variables, making the renderer even more messy. Of course this is due to the ugly design of the HTMLRenderer currently. I wonder if we may delay this until the overhual is finished, such that this feature may be implemented as a separated self-enclosing pass.\n\nFinally, could you also add a test case for this (maybe after we have no issues left for the code).\n\nOther possible methods I was thinking of\n- To detect empty chars using FontForge, but Type 3 fonts might not be supported, and the FontForge API could be messy\n- To detect empty chars by painting them (e.g. with SplashOutputDev), and to check if there's any update, which could be done in the preprocessor\n. Further, it seems that this is better done in `Preprocessor`, as checking if a glyph is empty might be expensive, we may check each glyph used in the document first, and store the results along with the mapping info.\nBut again, it would be better to do so after the overhaul.\n. Thanks.\n. The design of the hierarchy structures is toward the HTML output, but not according to the PDF instructions. If the design does not reflect that, maybe something is still wrong with the design. In case you were mentioning the behavior of `TextPageBuilder`, it is supposed to convert/adapt the PDF instructions to our structures in an intuitive and fast way, such that we can start working on the structures as soon as possible. \n\nYes I've been thinking about to continue using the flatten char array, just like the current design. But the problem I found is that we need to maintain lots of conditions manually. For example, if a `char` is removed (due to hidden by an image, or we decide to covert it to an offset), we need to find the `word` containing it and modify it accordingly. Then I was thinking, if we have to maintain this relationship of belonging, why don't we make it so in the structure and design API functions accordingly? This should be easier for others to understand and extend it, and potentially there could be fewer bugs.\n\nMaybe you are right about most passes are char-wised, yet we may provide a char_iterator for `TextSegment`. The overhead should be small. In fact I had also considered the design of storing all the `char`'s in a list, and defining `TextWord`'s with two iterators, but in the end I thought that the benefit of iterating characters is not worth sacrificing a better set of APIs. At least we could write something like this:\n\n```\nfor (auto & word : segment) {\n  for (auto & c : word) {\n    // do stuffs\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd about `vector` vs `list`. In the current design we are using indices as iterators, because `vector`'s iterators may be invalidated in lots of situations, and I found it ugly and error-prone to write code this way. There should less problems with `list`. And yes of course, we can always build a new array for each pass, but who is responsible to maintain the states, API designers or users? In the former case, I believe that the API could be complicated, and in the latter case (API designers can also be users here), the problem comes back again: the users have to carefully maintain the conditions while implementing the algorithm.\n\nGenerally I think for flatten-or-not, vector-or-list, both cases are equivalent in theory, but I would like to ease the process of implementing the passes on top of it.\n. OK, that sounds good to me. So we do not restrict that the same structure is used in each pass, which makes sense here.\n\nBut during the offset<->space convertion, it is possible that we add more offsets in between in order to connect words. Of course we can do so by building a new array, but I'm thinking if it will be easy to do so.\n\nAnother problem is, right after we build `TextWord`, we need to make sure that the char array will never be modified, I'm not sure if this constraint is too strong. \n\n`std::list` or intrusive list may be used to solve both problems, I wonder if there are anything we need from `vector`?\n. Oh, about transparent char, I was thinking of the case like this, suppose that we have \"ABC\", in which the letter B is covered by some image, then probably we will be able to merge A and C. But this could be edge cases.\n\nI do not remember exactly which characters are shown, some characters are transparent as defined in PDF, and some are hidden due to overlapping. Shall we show both of them in HTML (transparently)?\n. And about `inserting offset to connect words`, actually it can be done by adding a field `space_after` in the class `TextWord`, so right now I cannot think of a pass that inserting new elements in the array, which is good. \n. I do think that intrusive list is an overkill here, it's just convenient for the prototype, my plan was to use `std::list` or our own implementations eventually. I will think again about `vector` vs `list`\n\nAnd about the passes, I just realized that, if we dump all the chars first, we need to store all the styles for each char, the combine them by comparing the styles again. Could be a waste, but maybe it will be fast enough.\n. I've listed all possible passes in my mind.  Please comment.\n\nWe could discuss the implementation accordingly.\n. Yes, pointers to a style node would be a good solution.\n. I'm not sure if we can do so in step1, it depends on whether merging the word would need the information of the words. \n\nSo after some thoughts, I decided to implement the char-vector with indices. Let's see if it will work well.\n. I think that it's not easy to do so, for example, supposed that we have two words \"Hello World\", which are drawn on the canvas with different matrices (I've seen PDF files which moves to positions by changing CTM). It is possible to check that the `o` and `W` may be connected by normalizing the matrices and then adding an offset in between.\n\nHowever changing the styles on the char array might not be a good idea, usually style is used for one or more words, and I find it more natural to perform matrix-normalizing pass on the word array.\n\nCurrently the plan is to add 'shift_after_x' and 'shift_after_y' for each `Char` and `Word`. What're the benefits of Shift/Offset nodes over this design?\n. > There are quite a few chances that normal chars and offsets are converted to each other or even merged. E.g. illegal chars may be converted to offsets and further merged with surrounding offsets/whitespaces. So I think is would be convenient that both normal chars and offsets are represented by CharNode so the convertion/merging can be done in-place.\n\nWe may convert chars to offsets, but when shall we covert offsets to chars?\n\n> As to styles, I think TextStyle can be made immutable. If we want to change a CharNode's style, we usually push a new TextStyle object into the per-page array of TextStyle, and modify the CharNode's style pointer to point to the new TextStyle. Unused TextStyles are not reclaimed until end of the renderring of the page, but this should not be a big problem.\n\nBy modifying styles, usually I meant re-scaling the matrix as well as the font size, or tweaking the positions, and most of time this happens word-wise. While you can covert style for individual chars, we will get lots of new duplicated styles, which is in my mind not natural or elegant.\n\nAn example of changing the styles: [...] & fs denote the CTM and font size\n- [2,0,0,2,0,0] & 1 -> [1,0,0,1,0,0] & 2\n  So a ID matrix with font_size 2 is more natural than the former case, but there are lots of PDF doing the former way. In the old design, as well as the new one in my mind, whenever we change a style in this way, we should update all the elements using this style, instead of creating new styles for each of them. So the current design of `Segment` acts like a use-list for the style.\n\nI'm considering removing the addition `shift` field in `Char`, leaving it only in `Word`. So `char->offset` means breaking a `Word` into two, and `offset->char` means merging two `Word`'s into one. How's that to you?\n\nWith this semantic, there could be even no need to actually merge the offsets in the char-array. We may simply do that in the word-array. In this way the char-array remain the same (but the individual chars may be modified). I really prefer iterators to indices.\n\nAbout `Word`s, they may be allocated in buffers, but I think (intrusive) list might be better here as they are meant to be split or merged frequently.\n. OK, I'll finish it. In fact I found a few issues while using vector, I'm considering switching back.\n. After a few attempts, I could not find a good solution, yet I realized that the benefit could be less than I had thought. So I'm closing it. However I will try to merge char, unicode and bbox together later.\n. Thanks!\nWould you add yourself in the `AUTHORS` file?\n. Thanks!\n. Fixed in the `incoming` branch.\n. There were old issues about this, see #56 \nCurrently there's no plan to support reflowable text in pdf2htmlEX, but see #418, a plan is to supported tagged PDF, which can be created using other tools.\n\nThere's also a relevant option `--optimize-text`, which is not working quite well unfortunately.\n. What kind of messages would you like to mute?\n. Can you show some example? It would be easy to disable the progress, but mostly I saw messages from FontForge, which I'm not sure how to disable.\n. It seems to be a bug, as the output filename is optional.\nBut I cannot reproduce it.\n. Thanks for the PR, I knew that some (individual) users would like a default viewer, but seems that most users are embedding the output of pdf2htmlEX into their own pages.\n\nThe changes in this PR seem intrusive, the output can no longer be embedded this way, and there are likely to be conflicts in CSS rules as common names are used.\n\nIt would be best to make an options for this.\n. Fixed in `incoming`. Thanks~\n. @hojuruku  Right. Thanks for the explanation.\n. Fixed. Thanks!\n. You don't have sufficient dependencies installed.\n. Thanks!\nI simply removed it, as the version of fontforge is checked in cmake.\n. Hmm, I do not understand the feature you are proposing. Do you mean showing two types of output together, with a UI button that switching between them?\n. I'm not sure if there's a standard for auto-choosing video resolution, but the server may choose the best resolution according to the user-agent, or the video may be dynamically loaded via Javascript. Which could be similar for the case of PDF.\n\nRegarding ClearScan, could you provide a sample file? Yet maybe I'm still not quite understanding it, how is it relevant to pdf2htmlEX?\n. There is a `--page-filename` options, is that what you want?\n. Right now there's `--data-dir` option, but an option to specify manifest filename sounds good.\n. I remember that SVG fonts was introduced for Safari series (desktop & mobile) which are still supported now. Maybe we can remove it once it triggers more problem. There's not much effort to maintain it (as long as Fontforge supports it)\n\nRegarding outputting multiple font formats, it's been an old issue #83, but seems that nobody's interested in implementing it.\n\nSVG+CSS, yes, I've been thinking about it. Especially the motivations was to support vector graphics better, and also provided correct overlapping among text and image. (Therefore we won't need `--text-visibility` as for png backgrounds). \n\nBut mixing text and images turns out to be quite complicated. The SVG output is done by the `CairoOutputDev` from poppler. The files are not exposed in poppler as API so they are copied here and synced periodically. Once I tried to make an SVG+CSS output, but I didn't find a solution to inject font rules via cairo, which is the SVG library used. I haven't investigate since them. Maybe things have gone better now, or maybe not.\n\nRegarding `CairoOutputDev` itself, it's painful to make any modifications here, as we will need to make it sync with poppler, which changes their internal APIs often. Yet I'm not sure if they will accept any modifications to make it SVG+CSS, hope so, if not we may need to fork CairoOutputDev ourselves.\n\nOverall I definitely agree that SVG+CSS is a good idea, just hope some one would have the motivation and energy to work on it.\n. I think that PDF->SVG usually means a single SVG file as output, which is slightly (or not) different from SVG+CSS.\n. @duanyao That might be the reason why crocodoc(box.net) still use a bitmap background despite that a svg layer is being used.\n. How about mixing text and images in HTML, and we use SVG to render vector graphics and bitmaps with special effects (e.g. clipping). That way we may still use `CairoOutputDev` as a black box.\n. I was actually thinking of calling CairoOutputDev something like this\n\n```\nstruct HTMLOutputDev : OutputDev \n{\nvoid text_operations() {\n  if(!cairo_dev.empty()) {\n    cairo_dev.output_svg();\n    cairo_dev.clear(); // maybe allocate a new one\n  }\n}\n\nvoid non_test_operations(){\n  //forward to cairo_dev\n}\n\nCairoOutputDev cairo_dev;\n}\n\n```\n. What concerns me is the complexity of both CairoOutputDev and cairo-svg.\n. Yes I think so.\n\nOn Sun, May 3, 2015 at 4:11 PM, Duan Yao notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> So maybe doing all the SVG output ourselves is a more clean approch.\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/issues/516#issuecomment-98453647\n> .\n. #467 is related to this.\n. @hojuruku I think I'm losing you.

This guide only works on (specific versions) of Ubuntu. You may add it to a wiki page if you like.\nFor example, add a `Links` section in https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Building\n. You can try to tweak the dpi through parameters.\nHowever note that the size of images may not follow these values, as the empty margins may get trimmed.\n. `--zoom` and `--fit-width/height` adjust the parameters of the viewer. The quality is not altered as the users may zoom in/out themselves, and we do not want to lower the quality due to a small default zoom factor.\n. If `--split-pages` is not enabled, text should be static in the HTML.\n. I agree with @duanyao . It seems that there's few thing we can do on this side.\n. Maybe it's not very hard to support multi-html pages, using `iframe`'s. Yet special care must be taken to proper include necessary css files.\n\nBut over the years I don't feel that it's required by many people, nor any would be interested enough to send a patch.\n. For the header files, try to install `poppler-dev`\n. Or maybe named `libpoppler-dev` \n. Oh there is also a package named `libpoppler-private-dev`\n. Due to a recent bug, PSnames of the fonts are wiped out by pdf2htmlEX.\nOn the other hand, try `pdffonts`, which is a utility from poppler\n. Thanks. Probably I'll create a wiki page for user created scripts.\n. Can you copy the text out using a pdf viewer? If not, probably there's nothing we can do.\n. https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/FAQ\nYou can try different values of `--tounicode`.\nThe mapping from internal encoding to unicode is specific for each PDF file. Generally speaking you have to deduce the mapping manually, if that information has been lost.\n. Is there anything wrong in the output?\n. Did the wiki page about troubleshooting crashes help?\n\nOn Sat, May 30, 2015 at 11:27 PM, JensHH notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Output? There is no output because the program crashed.

Possibly you can provide an example with commands you used.\n. That does not sound relative to pdf2htmlEX... You should probably ask in other places.\n. It's definitely useful for lots of users, but it's beyond the scope of pdf2htmlEX. I think it is worth a separate project.\n. Using `pointer-events` is indeed a good idea. \nI'll test and add it.\n\nThanks!\n. PR merged. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Oh, just found that this is for the `master` branch, which should be `incoming`.\nI'll merge it this time though.\n. Please verify that the header files of fontforge have been installed properly.\n. So what's the bug/issue? It seems to me that there's something wrong in the PDF file.\n. You should probably try other PDF utilities, for example some provided in poppler.\n.

Why discuss it here? I think you might want to report bugs to the software, unless you found that the output of pdf2htmlEX is not valid HTML.\n. Please send PR to the `incoming` branch.\n. Hi @witwall, I wonder if you tested the availability of `libgen.h`. I believe it's not a standard c++ header, and seems gnulib is required? Unfortunatley this might break build for lots of users.\n\nref: https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/manual/html_node/libgen_002eh.html\n. You need to install Cairo with SVG support. Maybe check the configure parameters and dependencies of cairo.\n. Hmm. so the code may not be compatible with some versions of poppler. I need to investigate.\n. That version is too old, pdf2htmlEX won't work well with it.\n. As shown in the message \"Error: no SVG support found in Cairo\"\n\nEither you install cairo with svg support, or disable svg support.\n. There's already such a tool in poppler, please try it.\n. That's most likely browser bugs. If I remember correctly, Firefox has this bug for a long time, but Chrome should work.\nAnd it doesn't matter how the svg is generated, in fact the svg generation code are from poppler.\n. This is probably not something a converter should do. Maybe you can find such a tool for PDF files, and split the files before converting them into HTML.\n. I'd like to add this if anyone would like to maintain it.\n. Yes this feature has been one of the most desired ones. Yet it's not easily to do so.\n\nHere's the wiki page for discussions: https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Reflowable-Text\n\nIt might be relatively easy if there's corresponding tag information in PDF. And you might also try if this works for you http://latex2html5.com/\n. Thanks!\n. Cannot reproduce on my machine.\n. Most likely it's because the numbers (font sizes, widths) are rounded in the browser. Maybe you can try a larger number of `--font-size-multiplier`.\n\nIn the future we can improve this by preventing long whitespace\n. I cannot reproduce with Firefox + Mac.\nWhat's the command and the browser you used?\n. I haven't got time to set up a Cent OS myself.\nYou can just check the dependencies in the wiki page.\n.

Some tools may work with specific PDF files, but in general this is not supported by pdf2htmlEX.\n. Duplicate of #219\n. One possible way is to read the output dir and check the page files. \n. The reason for the root directory is probably because [there's no temp dir found](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/blob/master/src/util/mingw.cc#L58).\n\nHowever I'm not sure about the filenames, what's the filename of the input file?\n. These files could be generated by Fontforge or other libraries, yet I'm not sure.\n. I wonder if the `use_cropbox` parameter would help\n. Seems that the poppler mailing list is a better place to discuss about it, as pdfimages is part of poppler.\n. I believe this is beyond the scope of pdf2htmlEX, it looks to me a PDF optimization task: to reduce the number of fonts without altering the rendering.\n. https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Unfeatures\n. The name 'ignore-partial-clipping' could be ambiguous, for those chars partially clipped, are we ignoring the clipping (so the chars will be displayed), or the chars (otherwise).\n\nI'd suggest something like --partial-clipped-text=[auto|hidden|shown]\n. There was a idea about support custom prefix for all the class names, which can be specified via commandline. But it has not been implemented yet unfortunately.\n. @duanyao is right, the project has not been optimizing for SEO unfortunately.\n. @fmalina Interesting project! Thanks for sharing.\n. It seems that you want to embed jquery code into html, which might be too long for the parser?\nTry to use external js files maybe?\n.

Not sure if this is worth a dedicated parameter, but you can hack `font.cc` where the fonts are named, maybe you can use the internal ID as part of the filename.\n. Thanks!\n. It's not supported yet. Can you provide a sample pdf?\n. I'm not familiar with how transliteration works, you might want to take a look at `HTMLRenderer/text.cc`, or `HTMLTextLine.cc` where the characters are collected and rendered.\n\nAnd do you know why translit mess up the formatting?\n. ?\n. I checked the pdf, the text are rendered twice, at the exact same position. \nMaybe we can detect and remove same text at the same position as `pdftohtml` does\n. use `--no-drm`\n. This has never been considered, but I believe you will always get the same output for the same input.\n\nEach `y` class means a `y`-value for the elements, usually a new class is generated when a new value is found.\n\nI don't think pdf2htmlEX is suitable for your task. How about `pdftotext`, or to decompress the PDF files (e.g. with pdftk) and then simply `diff` the PDF files?\n.

Thanks for the patch!\nIt's intended to use `cerr` rather than `cout` for messages, as they are not \"outputs\".\nAnd please make PR to the `incoming` branch.\n. There must be an earlier bug for this, but I couldn't find it.\n\nThe problem is there's nowhere in the font file nor in the ToUnicode File that marks this glyph as a whitespace. The only thing we know is that the glyph is empty. \n\nOne thing I can do is to create a flag something like `--empty-glyph-to-offset`.\n. Yes, if there's nothing in the glyph, it will be treated as an offset shift, not necessary but often a whitespace.\n\nNot sure about PDF viewers, but I guess so.\n. Although not 100% sure, it looks like a crash in FontForge.\nCan try [this](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Troubleshooting-Crashes)?\n. I'm feeling that this is beyond the scope of pdf2htmlEX, can you elaborate what do you need from pdf2htmlEX?\n. I cherry picked your commits.\nThanks for the patch!\n\nPlease also add yourself to `AUTHORS`\n. Previously I had a partial patch for that, but didn't managed to merge it.\nSo far it's not supported in pdf2htmlEX, but maybe you can try the SVG format\n. Please read the manpage about the `--bg-format` param.\n. Thanks for your PR, can you squash the commits?. Hi, please use the incoming branch, and merge your commits.. Please merge your commit.\r\n\r\nAlso I think you need to rebase the branch, there are so many irrelevant commits in this PR.. ",

I probably should go though your recent changelog.\n. If you switch encoding to `UTF-8` in your browser then it should work. Don't know why it's set to ISO-8859-1 by default. Probably Dropbox issue.\n. Is it only adding gylph that's used in PDF or all gylphs to fonts? IMO making font size larger does not make much sense if browsers are capable of doing that. It worth trying the outputting unicode instead of it's translated value.\n. What I actually meant was that fonts are already quite heavy and we should not make them more bulkier by adding more information into it, if browser can do these things for us. However it'd propose some kind of font compression i.e. use only that glyphs which were used into pdf to keep font size sane.\n. Yeah you are right about it. it's just necessary glyphs. My concern is to make it work smoother on mobile devices I guess bigger html is a problem but rendering page one by one with smaller background image should also work.\n\nBTW I am against any changes which would make font more heavier unnecessary :) \n. Cool. I just noticed it's still buggy. `fl` is encoded as one character.\n. When i copy i still see corrupted char when pasted somewhere else. I guess it's some bug will wait until you finish.\n. Just comming back to this issue, Couldn't it be solved by simply looking into map and if not found then just ascii/unicode of key? On the contrary, problem are just with `fi` `fl` something with f might be a minor bug in encoding.\n. Hehe sorry my bad. I thought it's some other ticket. :)\n. I found one problem today that when you copy and paste test from `fi` `ff` like characters then it's invalid char.\n. Here you go [https://dl.dropbox.com/u/23258300/a.pdf](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/23258300/a.pdf) . Please find `fleste` in second line when you copy and paste this `fl` is interpreted wrong.\n.

Amazingly, it fixed #4 but this problem still persists. Removing whitespace from line 294 of `state.cc` now shows fonts correctly. Probably line merge needs some improvements.\n. Yeah `ffi` thingy now corrected if I remove this extra space from `span`. In both Firefox and WebKit based browsers it's fixed.\n. Your argument makes complete sense to me, theoretically it should be hard to distinguish between normal space and positional one. I know that poppler has got `pdftotext` utility which has got `TextWord` class which does rectangle merging to keep character in one word.\n. I realize this might be probably out of scope. Hence I am closing this as well.\n. Sure, I am going to patch it in my clone. Will send you merge request. Anyways thanks, you have already done lots of good work with this project.\n. I tried three different techniques the one with look ahead with whitespace works the best but it breaks some visual stuff which is unacceptable. \n\nI scanned characters and check if whitespace between this and next char is less than threshold and current character is `space` then trim it off. Worked fine for some pdf but some didn't work accurately. I guess for the time being I am not sure if there is a any other better technique which would work, Still I will try one more technique which pdftotext use.\n. I should have used consistently instead of accurately. There were few problems\n- It does not always trim positional whitespace (since it's based on threshold and in some cases it just doesn't cross threshold).\n- The main problem was in few cases it just strip real `space` I cannot fuzzily determine the threshold.\n\nBTW if you want then I can submit threshold patch tomorrow but it doesn't really solve any problem. \n. It's relative threshold. For now it's half of the `space` probably your idea will leads to better result. I'll try and check in my code and will let you know. Re-opening this ticket.\n. Thx Lu, I am on the move will be back on Monday. Thanks for letting me know.\n. I have done some cleanup after your code changes. I am wondering how why this margin-left in spacing is added. It almost work but I guess I am not doing something correct to make it work perfectly. iapain/pdf2htmlEX@7bf6fe616f337c495f103ca60a7f9d70d6c6211a\n. Bug still persist. Lets keep this on hold. I hope I'll also have some time to look into it.\n. This option would be great :) Thx.\n. Tested intensively on variety of PDFs. Works great. Thanks!\nBTW I noticed that glyphs that were unused on page they were also encoded in font. That is quite weird because it should just encode used glyphs.\n. It'd be nice future add-on. Font size will dramatically reduced in graphical PDFs. Also this would benefit mobile viewing.\n. I think it's very wise decision. In the end it's all how similar is output to pdf matters. I think `--tounicode=0` will make HTML looks similar to PDF.\n\nBy the way, I found that this option is not working for me. Try it on the PDF refereed on this ticket. I think we need to speed up testing to avoid regressions, I will start contributing.\n. Now I get it clearer. I am okay with this behaviour. I agree with you that default **auto** mode should be smart enough. I tried some PDF with Type2 font with collision in font map. I didn\u2019t see any error messages in debug mode about \"drop\". I guess it needs to be tested well.\n. Wouldn't CSS will do the same here. Please look at it carefully , it's child node selector in CSS. So it would be exactly the same way, I\nMight be wrong but that's what I found in my tests:)\n\nCheers\nDeepak\n\n---\n\nSent from iPhone\n\nDeepak Thukral\nDeveloper\nFagbokforlaget & VB\n\nOn 6 wrz 2012, at 23:24, Lu Wang notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Whyy do you remove those js code?\n> They are not equivalent.\n> The js code loads the pages one by one asynchronously,\n> which prevents page rendering blocks UI events.\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. epub3 still needs lots of work on fixed layout books. However I am working on a module to convert html from pdf2htmlEX to `hpub` its Baker specific format.\n. tailing zero is different than setting precision. Let me elaborate with some more examples:\n\n`100.1023453 -> 100.1023453`\n`100.0000000 -> 100`\n\nI know it wont save much but for editors it's easy to adjust these values than with more zeros at end.\n. How about this convert double into string buffer and remove all trailing zeros and then output string. It only requires in css and styles etc.\n. @antonywu I will add home-brew formula for this.\n. Great! You may use 0.3.1 tag. Feel free to submit yourself just let us know the link or the status of your issue/merge request.\n\nPS: If you want I can have a quick review.\n. @coolwanglu It's still hanging out there. I can release my own macport repo which user can clone and then they will be able to install it via local macport repo.\n. @coolwanglu I will open up a repository which with all instructions.\n. @coolwanglu Here is macport local repo https://github.com/iapain/pdf2htmlEX-macport\n. Deepak Thukral, iapain @iapa.in thanks :)\n. @jamiely I didn't try your formula yet but I can tell those who reported error used an old compiler.\n\n@coolwanglu I think it makes sense to add these all checks in cmake file.\n. @coolwanglu In cmake there is a `CheckCCompilerFlag.cmake` just include it and check what compiler supports. I was thinking about it when I was implementing clang support but thought it's just too much.\n. I can confirm this. BTW @Kamek you dont need to compile it with gcc-4.7 if you have latest Xcode you may use clang (apple g++) equiv.\n\n@coolwanglu Looks like some problem with new `CMakeList` will test it further.\n. ```\n-- The C compiler identification is GNU 4.2.1\n-- The CXX compiler identification is Clang 4.0.0\n-- Checking whether C compiler has -isysroot\n-- Checking whether C compiler has -isysroot - yes\n-- Checking whether C compiler supports OSX deployment target flag\n-- Checking whether C compiler supports OSX deployment target flag - yes\n-- Check for working C compiler: /usr/bin/gcc\n-- Check for working C compiler: /usr/bin/gcc -- works\n-- Detecting C compiler ABI info\n-- Detecting C compiler ABI info - done\n-- Check for working CXX compiler: /usr/bin/c++\n-- Check for working CXX compiler: /usr/bin/c++ -- works\n-- Detecting CXX compiler ABI info\n-- Detecting CXX compiler ABI info - done\n-- Found PKG_CONFIG: /opt/local/bin/pkg-config (found version \"0.27.1\") \n-- checking for module 'poppler>=0.20.0'\n--   found poppler, version 0.20.3\n-- checking for module 'libfontforge>=2.0.0'\n--   package 'libfontforge>=2.0.0' not found\nFound fontforge.h: /usr/local/include/fontforge/fontforge.h\nFound fontforge: /usr/local/lib/libfontforge.dylib\nFound gunicode: /usr/local/lib/libgunicode.dylib\nLooking for libraries of python, which is required by fontforge, if you can link fontforge without python, you may disable this\n-- checking for one of the modules 'python;python-2.7'\n-- Configuring done\n-- Generating done\n-- Build files have been written to: /Users/iapain/prj/pdf2htmlEX\n```\n. BTW installing libspiro helped but it result in segmentation fault. I remember libspiro was never required in past.\n. No my FF is compiled without libspiro, Looks like ff trying to access spiro but it wasn't compiled with it so it result this segmentation fault. I guess if we compile with ff we libspiro then it'll resolve this problem. \n\nOn the other hand that it'll just add another undesired dependency.

Since config.h is too generic name so first one comes from some other library you need to use `NO_DEFAULT_PATH` option in find_path.\n\nYup old one worked because we were looking for `fontforge/config.h` instead of `config.h`\n. It's very lame but doc says\n\n**_If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional paths are added to the search.**_\n. stackdump\n\n```\nReason: KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at address: 0x0000000000000010\n0x0000000100017f63 in ff_save ()\n(gdb) bt\n#0  0x0000000100017f63 in ff_save ()\n#1  0x0000000100015133 in pdf2htmlEX::HTMLRenderer::embed_font ()\n#2  0x0000000100010e0d in pdf2htmlEX::HTMLRenderer::install_base_font ()\n#3  0x000000010001058a in pdf2htmlEX::HTMLRenderer::install_font ()\n#4  0x000000010000f811 in pdf2htmlEX::HTMLRenderer::check_state_change ()\n#5  0x0000000100015437 in pdf2htmlEX::HTMLRenderer::drawString ()\n#6  0x0000000100093d42 in Gfx::doShowText ()\n#7  0x000000010008668a in Gfx::opShowSpaceText ()\n#8  0x000000010008bc57 in Gfx::go ()\n#9  0x000000010008b6c2 in Gfx::display ()\n#10 0x00000001000cf820 in Page::displaySlice ()\n#11 0x00000001000cf6de in Page::display ()\n#12 0x00000001000d22ad in PDFDoc::displayPage ()\n#13 0x0000000100009fd7 in pdf2htmlEX::HTMLRenderer::process ()\n#14 0x000000010000330d in main ()\n```\n\nAfter commenting out ff_save\n\n```\nProgram received signal EXC_BAD_ACCESS, Could not access memory.\nReason: KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at address: 0x0000000000000000\n0x00000001002a81db in FontViewBase_Close ()\n(gdb) bt\n#0  0x00000001002a81db in FontViewBase_Close ()\n#1  0x0000000100017c28 in ff_close ()\n#2  0x0000000100015258 in pdf2htmlEX::HTMLRenderer::embed_font ()\n#3  0x0000000100010f2d in pdf2htmlEX::HTMLRenderer::install_base_font ()\n#4  0x00000001000106aa in pdf2htmlEX::HTMLRenderer::install_font ()\n#5  0x000000010000f931 in pdf2htmlEX::HTMLRenderer::check_state_change ()\n#6  0x0000000100015557 in pdf2htmlEX::HTMLRenderer::drawString ()\n#7  0x0000000100093d42 in Gfx::doShowText ()\n#8  0x000000010008668a in Gfx::opShowSpaceText ()\n#9  0x000000010008bc57 in Gfx::go ()\n#10 0x000000010008b6c2 in Gfx::display ()\n#11 0x00000001000cf820 in Page::displaySlice ()\n#12 0x00000001000cf6de in Page::display ()\n#13 0x00000001000d22ad in PDFDoc::displayPage ()\n#14 0x000000010000a0f7 in pdf2htmlEX::HTMLRenderer::process ()\n#15 0x000000010000342d in main ()\n```\n.

Yeah I saw that, I am also using GCC shipped with LLMV which is MacOS default gcc. It worked in past so I am pretty sure it should work without having a need of gnu gcc.\n. Okay sorted it out.

By the the even if libint.h was not found still it should have worked\n. I can't access these dropbox links 403 error.\n. Try loading pages one by one in dom via ajax. It works better.\n. Pardon me, what these options going to do? Problem is that PDF is usually fixed layout document and text won't re-flow on mobile devices, that is the core problem on small screen devices.\n\nHowever, I am in a favour of adding support for preset files. e.g. `ipad.preset` which would contain something like this `--zoom 1.33 --space-as-offset 1 --tounicode -1`.\n. @coolwanglu IMO single line key-value would be ideal for preset file e.g.\n\n```\nf=1\nl=1\noutput-dir=~/Documents\nspace-as-offset=1\n```\n\nI can patch this if you want. I still don\u2019t see it as top priority work.\n\nRegarding Mobile devices @coolwanglu problem is not exactly with width and viewports. It's more related to memory optimization in iOS which degrades some features when memory warning is received. There are quite a few tricks to make it more responsive as mentioned here.\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/9941972/slow-list-view-scrolling-on-ipad-when-scrolling-in-an-overflowauto-div\n\n@deathlord87 Based on my tests on iPad. I have found that scrolling is very laggy, rest all works with proper zoom option.\n. @deathlord87 It would be nice if you can benchmark iOS safari performance with and without hardware acceleration. You can trigger hardware acceleration simply by doing some graphic stuff in css.\n. @deathlord87 Thanks for your investigation. I think the only way to make work inside Safari is to write your own viewer. pdf2htmlEx does support split output.\n\nRegarding memory leaks, It might be safari bugs. I also tried to optimize and what I out that loading one page one time helps. I am not sure if we should report it to webkit. I need to further investigate about what are the limits and if hardware acceleration helps.\n\nBTW 10+ MB on scrolling is huge, @coolwanglu may it worth exploring flowable text.\n. @coolwanglu Flowable text can dramatically ease Safari rendering problems. On the top of that the result output can fit in any screen which is equally important.\n. @deathlord87 Looks decent.\n. We were able to increase performance by triggering hardware acceleration. I have tested it with iOS device but in theory it should work same way on Android Browsers as well. I have heard some browsers on Android like Dolphin they enable hardware acceleration by default so that might be the reason why you observed different results.\n\nYou can try to trigger hardware acceleration by a 3D transformation in CSS. You may also wants to look at Zapto instead of using jQuery. Zapto is minimal jQuery clone.\n. @coolwanglu If you mean Zapto then I am pretty sure it wont. In general @jahewson is correct about limited memory assigned to GPU but I think `split-pages` option makes it worth trying, on mobile device we can render pages from split pages instead of huge DOM.\n\nIt's out of scope of `pdf2htmlEX` to implement a specialized reader for mobile but at least we can have kind of optimized css which hardware accelerates. \n. @coolwanglu Sorry I meant [Zepto](http://zeptojs.com/). Its minimal jQuery implementation. It's quite faster than jquery itself. We use it heavily on mobile HTML.\n. I tried it on both iPad (iOS 5) and iPad 2 (iOS 6). iPad 2 is almost 30% faster in our test cases. We did some minor tricks in css to trigger hardware acceleration. Haven't tried lazy loading but still large source is resource hungry. \n. @coolwanglu that's true and existing options in converter are sufficient to strip down fonts and split pages. So, I guess slowness can be easily controlled by changing default options.\n. @micred Exactly, it'll about \"load time\", \"scroll lag\" and \"zoom lag\". Unfortunately, It's very naive benchmarking which we (in our company) did 6 months ago. I am not sure if it'll be useful now.\n. @coolwanglu @bachboss with `--split-page` options it's indeed makes it faster on iOS devices.\n. You can easily compile it without gcc/g++ on mac. Make sure your xcode is upto date and then use `make && sudo make install`.\n\nJust looking at error I can assure you that your default gcc/g++ is not 4.7. Please run `gcc -v` and if it's the case then export proper compiler before compiling if you dont wants to use LLMV compiler.\n. and `g++ -v` ?\n. Also, your `/opt/local/bin/gcc` is GCC 4.4.7 as you can see in cmake log. Force C and CXX compiler to 4.7 in cmake.\n. @coolwanglu We should do all these checks in CMakeList instead of Portfile or  BrewFormula.\n. Your point is valid if we see compiler as dependency. To me compiler is very important asset, I hate when some program updates or override my compiler settings. Well, you decide. I can inject proper compiler dependency. For those who have properly installed Xcode (with all updates) will never be an issue. \n. +1 for annotation, probably not a high priority but makes complete sense to add this in pdf2htmlEX. Probably, it'll need some designs to keep them in page.\n\n@deathlord87 I think easiest work around for you to have separate backend for annotations and you draw annotations from your backend via svg on top of html. You can also export them into PDF.\n. Looks like a valid bug. Font color is wrongly interpreted.\n. Isn't adding css to \"print\" would solve this?\n. Thanks :+1:\n. I can still produce it (only on mobile devices). Obvious fix is to introduce space between line div. Probably you may close it as it might be not relevant for some usecases.\n. I'd encourage to re-open this. As of Firefox 22 it can be now reproduced in both firefox and webkit based browsers. To repeat it, select text (multiline) and paste it. Last word would overlap with first work of newline.\n. @coolwanglu See this attached screenshot. I tried this demo.pdf as well and I was able to repeat it.\n\nSteps:\n- Select text multiline. (as shown in image).\n- Paste this text. It'll **not** have _extra space_ as it should have between last char of first and first char of next line.\n\n![case_without_space](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/35413/817556/be2db2ca-ef77-11e2-94ea-b7b833d0381f.png)\n. @coolwanglu That screenshot is from Firefox 22 but I can also repeat it on Google Chrome 27\n. @coolwanglu You're right about Firefox but still it fails on both WebKit based browsers and IE 9/10.\n\nLooks like:\nWebkit omits newline char.\nIE 9/10 preserver it as newline (and if you paste it then it keeps the text before newline char)\nFirefox convert it to space. \n\nIn my opinion we should unify this behaviour.\n. @coolwanglu I will try to patch this bug.\n. @coolwanglu Possible solution is to get rid of newline char as in HTML it has no or little influence and substitute it with proper HTML equivalent. Do you have a better idea?\n. @coolwanglu `<br>` is not really required, I was thinking about scanning line and if end of line is a new line char then just replace it with empty space.\n. @coolwanglu You're correct about that but I found much more simpler way. It'd be great if you can test it with IE. I have tested it with gecko and webkit.\n. The problem with dots are that they are undeterministic. We don't know how many dots to expect. So something like this 1/20, 2/20 ... tells us that there are 20 pages and 2nd page is being converted, one can easily render this information in custom progress bar.\n. My idea behind this task is just, people who extend pdf2htmlEX, they should be able to grab progress. Currently it's bit awkward, you may choose any format, just keep it deterministic. :)\n. Thanks! that works excellent with external plugin :)\n. Pay attention to error message it says `package 'poppler>=0.20.0' not found`\n. It does try to locate poppler. Could you please check your poppler version?\n. can you locate your libpoppler.so ?\n. That's pretty odd. IMO cmake seems to be doing something weird while locating poppler. I don't have access to centOS so cannot say anything. BTW patches are always welcome here :)\n. CSS is responsible for placing content and transformations. If CSS is removed then content is not placed properly. I guess you need to elaborate the usecase.\n. I see your point. Did you try **pdftohtml** and **pdftotext** which comes with poppler. We are planning work on re-flowable text which may open doors for this feature. For now, I can say this feature may take longtime. @coolwanglu makes final decision on priority, so lets wait what he says.\n. Install fontforge\n. Is your poppler installed with `--enable-xpdf-headers` looks like poppler is the problem in this case.\n. Looks neat. \n. The obvious work around for this is to convert page by page and use `--fit-width` and `--fit-height` or you can crop your PDF file before doing conversion.\n. :-1: I see a very easy workaround to this problem over new option in codebase.\n. @coolwanglu Here it is: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VjVlhJGs6I\n. Feel free to tweak javascript, we are doing lazy loading to minimize memory overhead. If you load all pages together then browser search will work as expected.\n. I understand it's for demo and it can be easily changed but while shipping out of box solution it'd be nice to have better css. I'll attach merge request and hopefully it'll clarify things.\n. Sorry about that, it have to go away from both `#pdf-outline` and `#pdf-main`. Updated merge request.\n. It works fine for me. Could you please share your PDF with us.\n. Could you please share PDF. It's tested, plz pay attention to CSS reset\n\nSent from my iPad\n\nOn 18 lut 2013, at 20:42, John Hewson notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> No... it really does break the page loading in pdf2htmlEX.js this is not a PDF-specific issue. Only the first page is visible in any converted PDF.\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Let me go technical for you. CSS `position:absolute` place content anywhere on page provided `left,top,right,bottom` etc. What we're doing in css is defining everything 0 and placing div absolute to 0. My argument is instead of doing this absolute by just placing it to 0,0 and that's what patch provides. First, it reset the co-ordinates and then it place div normally without absolute positioning. Here is an example and it works for me in IE8+, Chrome, FFx, Safari.\n\n[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/75853179/10.1.1.172.6050.html](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/75853179/10.1.1.172.6050.html)\n. I know it's not going to work and changes are required to make it work properly. I just wanted to elaborate that using position absolute is not wise for usability and accessibility. It's work is progress and Lu and I totally aware of it. Point is to slowly get rid of absolute from the pdf-main container.\n\n---\n\nSent from iPhone\n\nDeepak Thukral\nDeveloper\nFagbokforlaget & VB\n\nOn 19 lut 2013, at 13:12, John Hewson notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> I figured out why we were seeing different results with multi-page documents without an outline - I was applying your CSS change manually via Chrome's inspector, but the lazy loading code in pdf2htmlEX.js. had already hidden all subsequent pages.\n> \n> When I modify the manifest file with your changes, then I see the same result as you.

Thanks\n. `$(window)` should automatically handle `frameset`. You're right about all other kinds of embed inside page, but I am wondering it might have also broken with `position:absolute` since you force coordinate system to (0,0).\n. Thanks. I am almost done, just need to check compatibility with rescaling in js code.\n. @coolwanglu Why `.woff` is not default in options. WOFF is now W3C recommended.\n. AFAIK WOFF support was added in ICS. I just tested it on my Android device (4.1) WOFF renders properly. In addition to that I found this http://blog.typekit.com/2012/02/21/update-to-typekits-android-support/\n. We intensively use `woff` we never found any issue with italic text :)\n. @coolwanglu Just to add it looks like output looks horribly bad on chrome/webkit than Firefox.\n. Doesn't really fix it :(\n. Possible solution would be either searching text nodes in DOM and highlight them or generate inverted index to use in search (using https://github.com/fagbokforlaget/pdfiijs or pdftotext and feed it into indexing system).\n.

I probably should go though your recent changelog.\n. If you switch encoding to `UTF-8` in your browser then it should work. Don't know why it's set to ISO-8859-1 by default. Probably Dropbox issue.\n. Is it only adding gylph that's used in PDF or all gylphs to fonts? IMO making font size larger does not make much sense if browsers are capable of doing that. It worth trying the outputting unicode instead of it's translated value.\n. What I actually meant was that fonts are already quite heavy and we should not make them more bulkier by adding more information into it, if browser can do these things for us. However it'd propose some kind of font compression i.e. use only that glyphs which were used into pdf to keep font size sane.\n. Yeah you are right about it. it's just necessary glyphs. My concern is to make it work smoother on mobile devices I guess bigger html is a problem but rendering page one by one with smaller background image should also work.\n\nBTW I am against any changes which would make font more heavier unnecessary :) \n. Cool. I just noticed it's still buggy. `fl` is encoded as one character.\n. When i copy i still see corrupted char when pasted somewhere else. I guess it's some bug will wait until you finish.\n. Just comming back to this issue, Couldn't it be solved by simply looking into map and if not found then just ascii/unicode of key? On the contrary, problem are just with `fi` `fl` something with f might be a minor bug in encoding.\n. Hehe sorry my bad. I thought it's some other ticket. :)\n. I found one problem today that when you copy and paste test from `fi` `ff` like characters then it's invalid char.\n.

Amazingly, it fixed #4 but this problem still persists. Removing whitespace from line 294 of `state.cc` now shows fonts correctly. Probably line merge needs some improvements.\n. Yeah `ffi` thingy now corrected if I remove this extra space from `span`. In both Firefox and WebKit based browsers it's fixed.\n. Your argument makes complete sense to me, theoretically it should be hard to distinguish between normal space and positional one. I know that poppler has got `pdftotext` utility which has got `TextWord` class which does rectangle merging to keep character in one word.\n. I realize this might be probably out of scope. Hence I am closing this as well.\n. Sure, I am going to patch it in my clone. Will send you merge request. Anyways thanks, you have already done lots of good work with this project.\n. I tried three different techniques the one with look ahead with whitespace works the best but it breaks some visual stuff which is unacceptable. \n\nI scanned characters and check if whitespace between this and next char is less than threshold and current character is `space` then trim it off. Worked fine for some pdf but some didn't work accurately. I guess for the time being I am not sure if there is a any other better technique which would work, Still I will try one more technique which pdftotext use.\n. I should have used consistently instead of accurately. There were few problems\n- It does not always trim positional whitespace (since it's based on threshold and in some cases it just doesn't cross threshold).\n- The main problem was in few cases it just strip real `space` I cannot fuzzily determine the threshold.\n\nBTW if you want then I can submit threshold patch tomorrow but it doesn't really solve any problem. \n. It's relative threshold. For now it's half of the `space` probably your idea will leads to better result. I'll try and check in my code and will let you know. Re-opening this ticket.\n. Thx Lu, I am on the move will be back on Monday. Thanks for letting me know.\n. I have done some cleanup after your code changes. I am wondering how why this margin-left in spacing is added. It almost work but I guess I am not doing something correct to make it work perfectly. iapain/pdf2htmlEX@7bf6fe616f337c495f103ca60a7f9d70d6c6211a\n. Bug still persist. Lets keep this on hold. I hope I'll also have some time to look into it.\n. This option would be great :) Thx.\n. Tested intensively on variety of PDFs. Works great. Thanks!\nBTW I noticed that glyphs that were unused on page they were also encoded in font. That is quite weird because it should just encode used glyphs.\n. It'd be nice future add-on. Font size will dramatically reduced in graphical PDFs. Also this would benefit mobile viewing.\n. I think it's very wise decision. In the end it's all how similar is output to pdf matters. I think `--tounicode=0` will make HTML looks similar to PDF.\n\nBy the way, I found that this option is not working for me. Try it on the PDF refereed on this ticket. I think we need to speed up testing to avoid regressions, I will start contributing.\n. Now I get it clearer. I am okay with this behaviour. I agree with you that default **auto** mode should be smart enough. I tried some PDF with Type2 font with collision in font map. I didn\u2019t see any error messages in debug mode about \"drop\". I guess it needs to be tested well.\n. Wouldn't CSS will do the same here. Please look at it carefully , it's child node selector in CSS. So it would be exactly the same way, I\nMight be wrong but that's what I found in my tests:)\n\nCheers\nDeepak\n\n---\n\nSent from iPhone\n\nDeepak Thukral\nDeveloper\nFagbokforlaget & VB\n\nOn 6 wrz 2012, at 23:24, Lu Wang notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Whyy do you remove those js code?\n> They are not equivalent.\n> The js code loads the pages one by one asynchronously,\n> which prevents page rendering blocks UI events.\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. epub3 still needs lots of work on fixed layout books.

It's very lame but doc says\n\n**_If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional paths are added to the search.**_\n. stackdump\n\n```\nReason: KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at address: 0x0000000000000010\n0x0000000100017f63 in ff_save ()\n(gdb) bt\n#0  0x0000000100017f63 in ff_save ()\n#1  0x0000000100015133 in pdf2htmlEX::HTMLRenderer::embed_font ()\n#2  0x0000000100010e0d in pdf2htmlEX::HTMLRenderer::install_base_font ()\n#3  0x000000010001058a in pdf2htmlEX::HTMLRenderer::install_font ()\n#4  0x000000010000f811 in pdf2htmlEX::HTMLRenderer::check_state_change ()\n#5  0x0000000100015437 in pdf2htmlEX::HTMLRenderer::drawString ()\n#6  0x0000000100093d42 in Gfx::doShowText ()\n#7  0x000000010008668a in Gfx::opShowSpaceText ()\n#8  0x000000010008bc57 in Gfx::go ()\n#9  0x000000010008b6c2 in Gfx::display ()\n#10 0x00000001000cf820 in Page::displaySlice ()\n#11 0x00000001000cf6de in Page::display ()\n#12 0x00000001000d22ad in PDFDoc::displayPage ()\n#13 0x0000000100009fd7 in pdf2htmlEX::HTMLRenderer::process ()\n#14 0x000000010000330d in main ()\n```\n\nAfter commenting out ff_save\n\n```\nProgram received signal EXC_BAD_ACCESS, Could not access memory.\nReason: KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at address: 0x0000000000000000\n0x00000001002a81db in FontViewBase_Close ()\n(gdb) bt\n#0  0x00000001002a81db in FontViewBase_Close ()\n#1  0x0000000100017c28 in ff_close ()\n#2  0x0000000100015258 in pdf2htmlEX::HTMLRenderer::embed_font ()\n#3  0x0000000100010f2d in pdf2htmlEX::HTMLRenderer::install_base_font ()\n#4  0x00000001000106aa in pdf2htmlEX::HTMLRenderer::install_font ()\n#5  0x000000010000f931 in pdf2htmlEX::HTMLRenderer::check_state_change ()\n#6  0x0000000100015557 in pdf2htmlEX::HTMLRenderer::drawString ()\n#7  0x0000000100093d42 in Gfx::doShowText ()\n#8  0x000000010008668a in Gfx::opShowSpaceText ()\n#9  0x000000010008bc57 in Gfx::go ()\n#10 0x000000010008b6c2 in Gfx::display ()\n#11 0x00000001000cf820 in Page::displaySlice ()\n#12 0x00000001000cf6de in Page::display ()\n#13 0x00000001000d22ad in PDFDoc::displayPage ()\n#14 0x000000010000a0f7 in pdf2htmlEX::HTMLRenderer::process ()\n#15 0x000000010000342d in main ()\n```\n.

Yeah I saw that, I am also using GCC shipped with LLMV which is MacOS default gcc. It worked in past so I am pretty sure it should work without having a need of gnu gcc.\n. Okay sorted it out.

Pardon me, what these options going to do? Problem is that PDF is usually fixed layout document and text won't re-flow on mobile devices, that is the core problem on small screen devices.\n\nHowever, I am in a favour of adding support for preset files. e.g. `ipad.preset` which would contain something like this `--zoom 1.33 --space-as-offset 1 --tounicode -1`.\n. @coolwanglu IMO single line key-value would be ideal for preset file e.g.\n\n```\nf=1\nl=1\noutput-dir=~/Documents\nspace-as-offset=1\n```\n\nI can patch this if you want. I still don\u2019t see it as top priority work.\n\nRegarding Mobile devices @coolwanglu problem is not exactly with width and viewports. It's more related to memory optimization in iOS which degrades some features when memory warning is received. There are quite a few tricks to make it more responsive as mentioned here.\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/9941972/slow-list-view-scrolling-on-ipad-when-scrolling-in-an-overflowauto-div\n\n@deathlord87 Based on my tests on iPad. I have found that scrolling is very laggy, rest all works with proper zoom option.\n. @deathlord87 It would be nice if you can benchmark iOS safari performance with and without hardware acceleration. You can trigger hardware acceleration simply by doing some graphic stuff in css.\n. @deathlord87 Thanks for your investigation. I think the only way to make work inside Safari is to write your own viewer. pdf2htmlEx does support split output.\n\nRegarding memory leaks, It might be safari bugs. I also tried to optimize and what I out that loading one page one time helps. I am not sure if we should report it to webkit. I need to further investigate about what are the limits and if hardware acceleration helps.\n\nBTW 10+ MB on scrolling is huge, @coolwanglu may it worth exploring flowable text.\n. @coolwanglu Flowable text can dramatically ease Safari rendering problems. On the top of that the result output can fit in any screen which is equally important.\n. @deathlord87 Looks decent.\n. We were able to increase performance by triggering hardware acceleration. I have tested it with iOS device but in theory it should work same way on Android Browsers as well. I have heard some browsers on Android like Dolphin they enable hardware acceleration by default so that might be the reason why you observed different results.\n\nYou can try to trigger hardware acceleration by a 3D transformation in CSS. You may also wants to look at Zapto instead of using jQuery. Zapto is minimal jQuery clone.\n. @coolwanglu If you mean Zapto then I am pretty sure it wont. In general @jahewson is correct about limited memory assigned to GPU but I think `split-pages` option makes it worth trying, on mobile device we can render pages from split pages instead of huge DOM.\n\nIt's out of scope of `pdf2htmlEX` to implement a specialized reader for mobile but at least we can have kind of optimized css which hardware accelerates. \n. @coolwanglu Sorry I meant [Zepto](http://zeptojs.com/). Its minimal jQuery implementation. It's quite faster than jquery itself. We use it heavily on mobile HTML.\n. I tried it on both iPad (iOS 5) and iPad 2 (iOS 6). iPad 2 is almost 30% faster in our test cases. We did some minor tricks in css to trigger hardware acceleration. Haven't tried lazy loading but still large source is resource hungry. \n. @coolwanglu that's true and existing options in converter are sufficient to strip down fonts and split pages. So, I guess slowness can be easily controlled by changing default options.\n. @micred Exactly, it'll about \"load time\", \"scroll lag\" and \"zoom lag\". Unfortunately, It's very naive benchmarking which we (in our company) did 6 months ago. I am not sure if it'll be useful now.\n. @coolwanglu @bachboss with `--split-page` options it's indeed makes it faster on iOS devices.\n. You can easily compile it without gcc/g++ on mac. Make sure your xcode is upto date and then use `make && sudo make install`.\n\nJust looking at error I can assure you that your default gcc/g++ is not 4.7. Please run `gcc -v` and if it's the case then export proper compiler before compiling if you dont wants to use LLMV compiler.\n. and `g++ -v` ?\n. Also, your `/opt/local/bin/gcc` is GCC 4.4.7 as you can see in cmake log. Force C and CXX compiler to 4.7 in cmake.\n. @coolwanglu We should do all these checks in CMakeList instead of Portfile or  BrewFormula.\n. Your point is valid if we see compiler as dependency. To me compiler is very important asset, I hate when some program updates or override my compiler settings. Well, you decide. I can inject proper compiler dependency. For those who have properly installed Xcode (with all updates) will never be an issue. \n. +1 for annotation, probably not a high priority but makes complete sense to add this in pdf2htmlEX. Probably, it'll need some designs to keep them in page.\n\n@deathlord87 I think easiest work around for you to have separate backend for annotations and you draw annotations from your backend via svg on top of html. You can also export them into PDF.\n. Looks like a valid bug. Font color is wrongly interpreted.\n. Isn't adding css to \"print\" would solve this?\n. Thanks :+1:\n. I can still produce it (only on mobile devices). Obvious fix is to introduce space between line div. Probably you may close it as it might be not relevant for some usecases.\n. I'd encourage to re-open this. As of Firefox 22 it can be now reproduced in both firefox and webkit based browsers. To repeat it, select text (multiline) and paste it. Last word would overlap with first work of newline.\n. @coolwanglu See this attached screenshot. I tried this demo.pdf as well and I was able to repeat it.\n\nSteps:\n- Select text multiline. (as shown in image).\n- Paste this text. It'll **not** have _extra space_ as it should have between last char of first and first char of next line.\n\n![case_without_space](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/35413/817556/be2db2ca-ef77-11e2-94ea-b7b833d0381f.png)\n. @coolwanglu That screenshot is from Firefox 22 but I can also repeat it on Google Chrome 27\n. @coolwanglu You're right about Firefox but still it fails on both WebKit based browsers and IE 9/10.\n\nLooks like:\nWebkit omits newline char.\nIE 9/10 preserver it as newline (and if you paste it then it keeps the text before newline char)\nFirefox convert it to space. \n\nIn my opinion we should unify this behaviour.\n. @coolwanglu I will try to patch this bug.\n. @coolwanglu Possible solution is to get rid of newline char as in HTML it has no or little influence and substitute it with proper HTML equivalent. Do you have a better idea?\n. @coolwanglu `<br>` is not really required, I was thinking about scanning line and if end of line is a new line char then just replace it with empty space.\n. @coolwanglu You're correct about that but I found much more simpler way. It'd be great if you can test it with IE. I have tested it with gecko and webkit.\n. The problem with dots are that they are undeterministic. We don't know how many dots to expect. So something like this 1/20, 2/20 ... tells us that there are 20 pages and 2nd page is being converted, one can easily render this information in custom progress bar.\n. My idea behind this task is just, people who extend pdf2htmlEX, they should be able to grab progress. Currently it's bit awkward, you may choose any format, just keep it deterministic. :)\n. Thanks! that works excellent with external plugin :)\n. Pay attention to error message it says `package 'poppler>=0.20.0' not found`\n. It does try to locate poppler. Could you please check your poppler version?\n. can you locate your libpoppler.so ?\n. That's pretty odd. IMO cmake seems to be doing something weird while locating poppler. I don't have access to centOS so cannot say anything. BTW patches are always welcome here :)\n. CSS is responsible for placing content and transformations. If CSS is removed then content is not placed properly. I guess you need to elaborate the usecase.\n. I see your point. Did you try **pdftohtml** and **pdftotext** which comes with poppler. We are planning work on re-flowable text which may open doors for this feature. For now, I can say this feature may take longtime. @coolwanglu makes final decision on priority, so lets wait what he says.\n. Install fontforge\n. Is your poppler installed with `--enable-xpdf-headers` looks like poppler is the problem in this case.\n. Looks neat. \n. The obvious work around for this is to convert page by page and use `--fit-width` and `--fit-height` or you can crop your PDF file before doing conversion.\n. :-1: I see a very easy workaround to this problem over new option in codebase.\n. @coolwanglu Here it is: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VjVlhJGs6I\n. Feel free to tweak javascript, we are doing lazy loading to minimize memory overhead. If you load all pages together then browser search will work as expected.\n. I understand it's for demo and it can be easily changed but while shipping out of box solution it'd be nice to have better css. I'll attach merge request and hopefully it'll clarify things.\n. Sorry about that, it have to go away from both `#pdf-outline` and `#pdf-main`. Updated merge request.\n. It works fine for me. Could you please share your PDF with us.\n. Could you please share PDF. It's tested, plz pay attention to CSS reset\n\nSent from my iPad\n\nOn 18 lut 2013, at 20:42, John Hewson notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> No... it really does break the page loading in pdf2htmlEX.js this is not a PDF-specific issue.

CSS `position:absolute` place content anywhere on page provided `left,top,right,bottom` etc. What we're doing in css is defining everything 0 and placing div absolute to 0. My argument is instead of doing this absolute by just placing it to 0,0 and that's what patch provides. First, it reset the co-ordinates and then it place div normally without absolute positioning. Here is an example and it works for me in IE8+, Chrome, FFx, Safari.\n\n[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/75853179/10.1.1.172.6050.html](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/75853179/10.1.1.172.6050.html)\n. I know it's not going to work and changes are required to make it work properly. I just wanted to elaborate that using position absolute is not wise for usability and accessibility. It's work is progress and Lu and I totally aware of it. Point is to slowly get rid of absolute from the pdf-main container.\n\n---\n\nSent from iPhone\n\nDeepak Thukral\nDeveloper\nFagbokforlaget & VB\n\nOn 19 lut 2013, at 13:12, John Hewson notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> I figured out why we were seeing different results with multi-page documents without an outline - I was applying your CSS change manually via Chrome's inspector, but the lazy loading code in pdf2htmlEX.js. had already hidden all subsequent pages.\n> \n> When I modify the manifest file with your changes, then I see the same result as you.

Thanks\n. `$(window)` should automatically handle `frameset`. You're right about all other kinds of embed inside page, but I am wondering it might have also broken with `position:absolute` since you force coordinate system to (0,0).\n. Thanks. I am almost done, just need to check compatibility with rescaling in js code.\n. @coolwanglu Why `.woff` is not default in options. WOFF is now W3C recommended.\n. AFAIK WOFF support was added in ICS. I just tested it on my Android device (4.1) WOFF renders properly. In addition to that I found this http://blog.typekit.com/2012/02/21/update-to-typekits-android-support/\n.

Well here's what I have https://gist.github.com/3758431\nI'm not sure about some of the dependencies but I'd assume everyone wants libpng for background images.\nAlso not sure if I have the libpoppler xpdf's deps right, I think enable-xpdf is standard on the homebrew build all they offer is enable-glib and qt4. \n. Also for the test part of the formula, pdf2htmlex --version doesn't return a successful value I think so brew thinks the test failed.\n. Oh ok cool, we'll go with that then. Thanks man!\n. Should probably change the readme's dependencies then, as mac doesn't come with gcc >= 4.4.6 of any sort.\n. Got it to build this way:\nbrew install libspiro\nbrew install fontforge --with-libspiro, --with-pango, --with-cairo\n\nthen compiled. It still didn't detect libfontforge but found the headers and dylib and it seems to run without segfaulting.\n\nUpdate: nevermind, it does segfault.\n. Let me know if there's anything I can do. My C is rusty but my knowledge of osx, objective-c and homebrew is good.\n. I still get a seg fault: \nWorking: [1]    1870 segmentation fault  pdf2htmlex 'Cocoa Fundamentals - Apple (2010).pdf'\n\nI still have libspiro and crap installed, what are the new deps for mac now?\n. Removed libspiro, recompiled fontforge with cairo and pango only, no more segfault! Not sure why libspiro would be causing a segfault but I can't wait to use pdf2htmlex so I'll take it. Like I said my C is not so good so. I'll hopefully have a homebrew formula done in a day or so.\n. That would be awesome as lot's of mac users use brew.\n.

Most of the pdf2html converters dont support mobile devices and most of mobile devices has inbuilt javascript based rendering mechanism which screws up the UI.

I hope i'm making clear of the objective and not deviating.\n\n@coolwanglu  you can use some online simulations like http://quirktools.com/screenfly/ which will help you to view on simulators, its very close to a real device but its never = to a real device.\n. yeah I tried --fit-width but the issue arised when turning the device to landscape and portrait mode. The grey spaces will show up when turning the devices.\n. the pages when rotating the device must adjust to fit the screen's new width after rotation.\n. yes the scrolling is slow only because of the javascript. Try removing the jquery in manifest and run on iPad. Its better than the app with the jquery. i really dont understand what the javascript does. \n\nAbout memory warnings. It's beacause of the scrollable div area as I've read. Thats why i suggested iscroll dont know if that will work either, its all about performance. \n\n@iapain also try compiling the sources with loading the html with the following change in manifest.\n\n<!body>\n<!div id=\"pdf-main\">\n\nto \n\n<!body id=\"pdf-main\">\n\nIt loads a bit better. I will run performance tests with instruments in mac and give some ideas of memory peaks.\n. Hey everyone, As @iapain as asked i've benchmarked the ios safari and profiled it. The memory peaks as and when we scroll the pages. Safari crashes/freezes when it reaches 14-18MB mark. \n\nWhen used in UIWebView (Safari View for app development) it crashes at 10+ MB loaded. The memory needs to be handled efficiently so that the scrolling is not laggy. also the page which is visible + 1 back and +1 forward pages alone should be rendered all the other pages need not be rendered. I think too many <div> elements are the reason for crashing.\n\nCurrently when scrolling through the PDF the memory is loaded with the Full PDF and as we scroll the pages on the top is still live in memory, though Its not visible to the user.\n\nI tried with issue65_en.pdf - http://dl.fullcirclemagazine.org/issue65_en.pdf which is loaded as an example. When I reach page 6-10 Its crashing.\n. @coolwanglu the 18M is the size of the full HTML, its not necessary for the Devices be it mobile/desktop to eat up 18+ MB's of RAM for just viewing 1 page at a time. \nAnd yes! ,you are right the purpose of the project is to enable conversion of content, and 8/10 the conversion happens properly thanks to all your effort.

The code compiled and executed fine. I also tried converting a simple pdf to html and it worked fine. :) I want to convert the html back to pdf once again...!! after manupulations on the html. Is it possible ?? \n. I was using the command line\n\npdf2htmlex demo.pdf --fit-width 1024px --fit-height 768px\n\nThe pdf file is the same one used one of your examples in Readme.MD\n\nhttp://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.148.349&rep=rep1&type=pdf\n. I managed to create annotations on pdf using ghostscript also there's libharu framework based on c-lang, which helps in annotating but somehow the rendering the pdf is messing it all up.\nLooking for a way or method which will help annotating.\n. I think you can re-use the annotation that is followed in the pdf.js, they have a annotation support for basic annotations like stiky.\n. yeah sorry for the trouble. I got it right this time :)\n. @stanstanbellcom\n for annotating you could use ghostscript and add annotations on your pdf. By this your pdf's are modified and not the html. Annotations view for pdf2htmlEX is already requested and is being worked on :+1: \n. @stanbellcom \n\nghostscript only takes in input as text files for annotations text and the the location/rect for annotation. You can create individual text files for each user accessing your app. (tryout HTML5 LocalStorage). When the user clicks download pdf then the GhostScript can be executed with the text to annotate his/her own pdfs.\n. @jamiely  I use snow leopard and it works fine when compiled from sources.\n.

The code compiled and executed fine. I also tried converting a simple pdf to html and it worked fine. :) I want to convert the html back to pdf once again...!! after manupulations on the html. Is it possible ?? \n. I was using the command line\n\npdf2htmlex demo.pdf --fit-width 1024px --fit-height 768px\n\nThe pdf file is the same one used one of your examples in Readme.MD\n\nhttp://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.148.349&rep=rep1&type=pdf\n. I managed to create annotations on pdf using ghostscript also there's libharu framework based on c-lang, which helps in annotating but somehow the rendering the pdf is messing it all up.\nLooking for a way or method which will help annotating.\n. I think you can re-use the annotation that is followed in the pdf.js, they have a annotation support for basic annotations like stiky.\n. yeah sorry for the trouble. I got it right this time :)\n. @stanstanbellcom\n for annotating you could use ghostscript and add annotations on your pdf. By this your pdf's are modified and not the html. Annotations view for pdf2htmlEX is already requested and is being worked on :+1: \n. @stanbellcom \n\nghostscript only takes in input as text files for annotations text and the the location/rect for annotation. You can create individual text files for each user accessing your app. (tryout HTML5 LocalStorage). When the user clicks download pdf then the GhostScript can be executed with the text to annotate his/her own pdfs.\n. ",

Multiple pages are [part of SVG 1.2 Full](http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-SVG12-20041027/multipage.html), however SVG 1.2 Full was abandoned, and replaced by SVG 1.2 Tiny which some browsers support, but it does not include multiple pages.\n\nThe next version of SVG will be SVG 2.0, at some point in the distant future.\n. That Firefox bug has \"Status: RESOLVED FIXED\" since October 2012.\n\nI'm using Firefox 18, and web fonts now print correctly :smile: \n. Printing pdf2htmlEX output in Chrome (23) is broken for me - I always get a single blank page. However, Chrome _can_ print webfonts, because http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Kavoon prints fine.\n. @purem font files are big, you don't really want to be serving up multiple formats if you can avoid it - especially as pdf2htmlEX embed the fonts as base64 data URIs.\n\nTrueType works cross-browser everywhere except oldIE, which isn't supported by pdf2htmlEX. FontForge can't generate EOT files anyway. WOFF is now a viable option too, it's essentially a gzipped ttf file.\n\n@coolwanglu maybe WOFF should be the default font format?\n. > I remember that WOFF did not works for all...\n> \n> Embedding is optional, so it's ok if you generate multiple files, and load\n> one of them according to the browser.\n\nThere's no point - all browsers that currently support WOFF already support TrueType.\n. > So now here are the things to do\n> ...\n> - Set a separate CSS file for printing, basically to change units (px->pt)\n\nNo need, [a CSS pixel is a 1/96\"](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#absolute-length-units).\n. > But what's wrong with ttf?\n\nNothing really. WOFF files are compressed OTF files, so there's a size advantage. WOFF is supported almost everywhere worth bothering with now.\n\nEDIT: turns out WOFF is not supported on Android.\n. TrueType is a good default, keep it as it is. Serving up gzipped TrueType with `content-encoding: gzip` is going to work everywhere except oldIE.\n. > I meant the px and pt thing, I will have to create two sets of rules, for different media.\n\nHa ok. To get different rules for different media you need a [CSS media query](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/) for `print` which overrides your usual styles. This is similar to the WebKit stroked text hack I used.\n. > Best for iOS Safari -> SVG\n\n@purem, that's very out of date. TTF has been supported since iOS 4.2, and WOFF since iOS 5.0.\n. > IE only has partial support of TTF with @font-face.\n\nNot really. Just turn off the font's \"installable\" flag in the TTF header. \n\n@coolwanglu, does pdf2htmlEX do this? It needs to if not...\n. > SVG has best compatibility, its good to have it there just in case. Its minimal effort anyway.\n\n@purem - no, they're not supported by Firefox or IE. That's hardly \"best compatibility\". They don't contain hints so look like rubbish on Windows. A few years ago they were the only way to get web fonts on mobile, but not anymore.\n. > Not sure if this will fix for IE <9, due to the html 5 tags used.\n\nIE <9 only supports EOT fonts, which FontForge can't produce.\n. @purem, ok that's more like it, though the original post said \"best\", not \"best compatibility\". From a compatibility point of view it's a waste of time serving SVG fonts to iOS < 4.2 users, because that's only the first generation iPod Touch and iPhone. You're talking <1% of iPhone users, stuck on 5 year old technology.\n\n> Supporting more browsers will not be that much work and is a good thing.\n\nIt's a huge amount of work to actually test on these browsers, and you need to use an ancient iPhone which hasn't been updated to iOS 4.2. That's the wasted time, not the time it takes to code it. I guess you could just output the SVG font, stick it in the @font-face and hope for the best, but you have no idea if it actually works or not. Does the html and CSS for pdf2htmlEX content even render on iOS < 4.2 anyway, given that it's HTML5? Fonts are only one aspect of browser support.\n. > That is what I meant, they are still two rules.\n\n@coolwanglu what exactly is the problem with that?\n. Yes, lots to do!\n. Ok I found out why printing is broken in Chrome, it ignores absolute content when deciding the page size. There's a simple fix:\n\n**1. delete the following CSS attributes from `#pdf-main`:**\n\n``` css\nposition: absolute;\ntop: 0; \nleft: 0;\nbottom: 0;\nright: 0;\n```\n\n**2. add the declaration:**\n\n``` css\nbody {\n   margin: 0;\n}\n```\n\nNow printing in Chrome will work. It still needs some improvement though...\n. Looks like CSS has page-breaks http://davidwalsh.name/css-page-breaks\n. > Does `body {margin:0}` remove the page margin when printing ?\n\nNo, but this might:\n\n``` css\n@page {\n    margin: 0;\n}\n```\n\nUltimately the print margins are decided by the browser, OS, and print driver.\n. @haisum why not use Yum?\n. I mean use Yum to install Poppler and FontForge\n. It's not the usual behaviour of PDF readers to re-scale on a page-by-page basis. I just checked Adobe Acrobat, Chrome, and OSX Preview, and non of them do that. The standard method is \"Zoom to Fit\" where the entire document is scaled by a single factor. This is the same behaviour as `--fit-width <arg>` provides.\n\n@Simanas, `--fit-width` and `--zoom` are mutually exclusive. If you're trying to fit to a given width such as 960px then use `--fit-width`. If you're trying to implement \"Zoom to Fit\" then you'll need to do that in CSS in the browser. However if you're trying to zoom each page with it's own specific scale, then this is not a standard feature of PDF viewers, as it is _no longer a faithful rendering of the document_. If you want to do that, then I'd recommend pre-processing the PDF via another tool.\n\nMy vote is that pdf2htmlEX should stick to doing one thing and do it well, and avoid feature creep.\n. @Simanas a _conversion_ should faithfully reproduce the input, just in a different format. You're wanting to _manipulate_ the output by re-sizing individual pages, which actually means you're breaking the concept of page size.\n\nSo while re-scaling individual pages may fix your problem, it is fundamentally wrong. You can easily manipulate a PDF file in this manner using other tools, before converting the file with pdf2htmlex. There is no need to change pdf2htmlex to achieve this.\n\nIf you can achieve your goal by manipulating a PDF file beforehand, then you can see it is not a good candidate feature for pdf2htmlex. There has to be a separation of concerns, there's no point re-implementing functionality which you can get from existing tools\n. The fact is that PDF is a fixed layout format, and breaking that breaks what a PDF fundamentally is. In a broader context if you're genuinely concerned about content then you shouldn't be using PDFs in the first place!\n\nThere's nothing to stop you pre-processing your PDFs to mess-up their pages sizes, go for it, it's your call. Use pdf2htmlex as one of many stages in your conversion pipeline, there is no need to add a new feature to pdf2htmlex, for the same reason that pdf2htmlex doesn't need to rotate pages, or crop pages, or do OCR, or support in-browser annotations and generate a new annotated PDF file, or send e-mail.\n\nOn 29 Jan 2013, at 14:57, Simanas notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Ok now we are clear.

A screenshot of the output of pdftohtmlex should look exactly like a screenshot of a PDF in Adobe Acrobat. Don't you see that the manipulation you want to do has nothing to do with HTML? Why do you think Acrobat does it that way?\n\nOn 29 Jan 2013, at 15:59, Simanas notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> I know I can use different tools to achieve this but it makes me no sense.

I may have found a solution to this problem. Placing a non-absolutely positioned `<div>` at the start of the page fixes it:\n\n``` html\n<div id=\"pdf-main\">\n  <div class=\"d\" style=\"width:595.320000px;height:841.920000px;\">\n    <div id=\"p1\" data-page-no=\"1\" class=\"p\">\n      <div class=\"b\" style=\"background-image:url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAA...5CYII=');background-position:0 0;background-size:595.320000px 841.920000px;background-repeat:no-repeat;\">\n      <div><!-- adding this empty div gives the page some non-absolute content--></div>\n      <div style=\"left:70.824000px;bottom:760.780000px;\" class=\"l t1 h0\">\n        <span class=\"f1 s1 c0 l0 w0 r0\">Lorem ipsum...\n```\n\nEdit: actually I may have been confused about the original problem - this is a fix for flickering/blinking when changing the selection quickly, not jumping. Though the original post did mention that the selection \"blinks\".\n. I was using Chrome 23 on OS X - it may be a Chrome bug...\n. It's relatively common, but was a poor decision on the part of the OCR program - it should have used hidden text rather than just placing an image over the text. Obviously it's too late to do anything about that.\n\nPoppler's **pdftohtml** has some code to handle this specific problem at [line 522 of HtmlOutputDev.cc](http://fossies.org/dox/poppler-0.22.0/HtmlOutputDev_8cc_source.html#l00522) which is probably a good starting point.\n\n``` c++\n522   //----- discard duplicated text (fake boldface, drop shadows)\n523   if( !complexMode )\n524   { /* if not in complex mode get rid of duplicate strings */\n525     HtmlString *str3;\n526     GBool found;\n527     while (str1)\n528     {\n529         double size = str1->yMax - str1->yMin;\n530         double xLimit = str1->xMin + size * 0.2;\n531         found = gFalse;\n532         for (str2 = str1, str3 = str1->yxNext;\n533             str3 && str3->xMin < xLimit;\n534             str2 = str3, str3 = str2->yxNext)\n535         {\n536             if (str3->len == str1->len &&\n537                 !memcmp(str3->text, str1->text, str1->len * sizeof(Unicode)) &&\n538                 fabs(str3->yMin - str1->yMin) < size * 0.2 &&\n539                 fabs(str3->yMax - str1->yMax) < size * 0.2 &&\n540                 fabs(str3->xMax - str1->xMax) < size * 0.2)\n541             {\n542                 found = gTrue;\n543                 //printf(\"found duplicate!\\n\");\n544                 break;\n545             }\n546         }\n547         if (found)\n548         {\n549             str2->xyNext = str3->xyNext;\n550             str2->yxNext = str3->yxNext;\n551             delete str3;\n552         }\n553         else\n554         {\n555             str1 = str1->yxNext;\n556         }\n557     }       \n558   } /*- !complexMode */\n```\n. Oh I see... that's annoying. I thought the image was a Type 3 font, but it's not - it really is an image.\n. I've zoomed in all the way in Firefox and this still happens - it's consistent, the positions don't jump around as the zoom level changes.\n\nActually, on the same page (though not in the screenshot) in the sentence \"Each _d_ bin shape context is quantized to its [...]\" The letter _d_ appears too far **below** the baseline, as do many others on the page.\n\nAs you say, it seems that the problem is actually that all the non-Type3 fonts have slightly incorrect baselines. But some seem to be too high and others too low?\n. http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4305166/mori-cvpr01-page4.html\n\nnote: Dropbox overrides the text encoding to be ASCII in the HTTP header which messes up some characters - ignore that.\n.

I added a DRM override flag, taken from [this line](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/tree/utils/pdftohtml.cc#n254) in Poppler's **pdftohtml**.\n.

Travis is free hosted _continuous integration_ for GitHub, it does a build after every commit, this is great because:\n- it integrates with GitHub to let you know that a Pull Request won't break the build (see the green \"good to merge\" banner above)\n- it lets you add a a real-time [status image](http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/status-images/) to your GitHub page, to let others know that **master** will work\n- it's used by Mozilla, Rails, node.js, and is rapidly becoming the _de facto_ standard for high quality open source projects\n- potentially, you could add some tests and get Travis to run them, which lets you know that Pull Requests don't cause a regression, and likewise lets your users know that **master** does not contain regressions.\n. Ok, this Pull Request is ready now.

Ahhhhh! I see :frowning: \n. > Now it becomes --option-name description (default is xx), to me, the default value near looks more convenient. Especially when you are already familar with the names and you don't need to read the descriptions.\n\nI wouldn't asume people are familiar.

Try this PDF file which uses text rendering mode 2 (fill + stroke)\n\nhttp://libharu.sourceforge.net/demo/text_demo.pdf\n\nIt works fine in Firefox.\n.

Any font embeded in a PDF is presumably already licensed for embedding. The problem is that bit 2 and bit 3 set embedding only and printing/viewing only which are valid on the context of embeded fonts in a PDF.\n\nThe purpose of the restrictions is to stop the entire font being reproduced, but pdf2htmlEX is dealing with subsetted fonts, so it's probably not an issue. It my turn out that PDF generators just clear this bit anyway - I've not encountered it.\n\nThere's a simple workaround - serve WOFF to IE9.\n. Documentation here http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/os2.htm#fst\n. **Workaround:** serve WOFF to IE9 via http://www.kltf.de/kltf_notes_ie9ttfembeddingbits.htm.\n. The PDF file you linked to works fine for me on OS X, can you post the HTML file please? Also what browser/version are you using?\n. @coolwanglu it seems that the glyphs in the embedded font files have been stretched...\n. I'm using the same version of fontforge, but that's quite an old poppler you've got there\n. I can't reproduce this either\n. I'm confused, you're talking about `#pdf-main` but you'ved edited `#pdf-outline`. The table of contents goes in  `#pdf-outline` such as in [this pdf](http://acroeng.adobe.com/Test_Files/bookmarks//PDFLOverview.pdf)\n. Ok, but removing`position:absolute` breaks the lazy page loading code in pdf2htmlEX.js. Try a multi-page document... you'll only see the first page.\n. ...it really does break the page loading in pdf2htmlEX.js this is not a PDF-specific issue. Only the first page is visible in any converted PDF.\n. Also it completely messes up the **outline**. Did you intend this, or has the change just not been tested?\n. There's a reason why these elements use absolute positioning - you can't just turn it off and expect things to work. By removing the absolute positioning you've broken the **outline** - this is obviously the only possible impact of the changes you've made... it's what _has_ to happen when you change `absolute` -> `static`. It's got nothing to do with my PDF files.\n. I figured out why we were seeing different results with multi-page documents **without an outline** - I was applying your CSS change manually via Chrome's inspector, but the lazy loading code in `pdf2htmlEX.js` had already hidden all subsequent pages.\n\nWhen I modify the `manifest` file with your changes, then I see the same result as you. However, you've still broken the lazy loading code - pages are supposed to be loaded _as they are scrolled into view_, but the JavaScript code relies on `absolute` positioning logic. Instead, with your change _all pages are immediately visible_, which is ok for your test document but will cause degraded performance on longer documents with lots of images. You'll need to update the lazy loading logic in `pdf2htmlEX.js` to account for non-`absolute` positioning.\n\nNone of this affects the **outline**, which is still broken. Do you know what an outline is?\n. Try using TrueType fonts\n. I just tried it myself with the latest code from `master`, and can confirm that there is a bug. Font settings make no difference.\n. > Is there any way I/you/someone could check if this is an inherent problem in the source PDF that this project can do little about or if this is an actual bug? A particular program or something I could use on Ubuntu to check the PDF?\n\nThe stretched fonts are certainly a bug in pdf2htmlEX, but the weird spaces are probably due to PDF being a poor format for storing text, and so the readers have to \"infer\" where the spaces are, there is a `--space-threshold` parameter to control this which you might like to experiment with. If that doesn't solve it then the weird spaces are probably also a pdf2htmlEX bug.\n. Thanks!\n. +1, reducing the number of `<div>`s and `<span>`s will be a huge boost to performance.\n. Could sub/superscripts use CSS `vertical-align` with a _length_ ?\n. Hi @iclems, I have a similar background - familiarity with Poppler, and now starting to make some small contributions to pdf2htmlEX. I'm actually working on #39 at the moment, rather slowly.\n\nThis issue - reducing the number of divs - is in my opinion one of the most important because of the impact on performance. I'd recommend trying out some of your typical PDFs and seeing if any features you care about are missing - that's how I ended up adding stroked text.\n. > 10% performance gain\n\nWould that be DOM memory, HTML file size, or frame rate?\n. Ok. Btw - I think you should keep the un-optimized text generation mode, and have a flag `--optimize-text` which is `1` by default, for debugging.\n. Have you tried looking at the DOM memory in the Chrome's Task Manager?\n. > @jahewson what does proportional memory (the last column) mean?\n\n@coolwanglu the columns should be:\n- **Resident:** Amount of memory that is present in physical RAM.\n- **Shared:** Amount of memory that is present in physical RAM and can be shared with another process.\n- **Private:** Amount of memory that is present in physical RAM and can not be shared with another process.\n- **Virtual:** Amount of address space allocated in virtual memory.\n\nThe most important value is _Resident_, which is the first column. So you're seing a 23% reduction in RAM with your optimizations - great! (93MB -> 72MB)\n. @iclems, yep these are tricky issues:\n\n> - \"z-index\" issue : the eternal issue with the approach consisting in placing everything that is not text in the background takes place one you have \"elements\" hiding text (a lot of designers do it in InDesign => they just hide some text elements with a white square, or put an image on top of it and never remove the text behind) = it's quite complicated to find an issue to this issue as it would involve for each object to check its \"visibility\"\n\nIt could be done by sending all the drawing commands to a polygon clipper, and pruning any text which gets drawn over (where the text rectangle intersects the drawing polygon). It's a very big job.\n\nAlternatively, if each drawing command was rendered to a separate transparent PNG image, then the problem goes away, as does the problem below.\n\n> - reducing the background-image issue : part of the poppler speed issue is due IMO to the rasterizing of the big background-image. In some cases, I have noticed that a non transparent background color can lead to generating one big image for each page. Do you know anything about this ? Do you consider it an issue ? I had as well been working a year ago on a custom approach trying to cut the background image in non-empty smaller images which would just be positioned absolutely. What do you think ?\n> \n> [...] best would be to be able to put the background color in CSS and have a \"per image\" absolute positioning\n\n \"per image\" absolute positioning, for image objects that's fine, but what about paths? These would need to be rendered into separate images, it _could_ be done.\n\nThe simplest approach might be to keep track of the min/max x and y values used for drawing, and crop the background to that size.\n. > I wonder if per-path images would introduce too many overhead.\n\nThere's only one way to find out...\n\n> For example, why people use CSS sprites?\n\nBecause they look good on retina displays, and scale well with zoom. I don't think that size or overhead are the reasons people choose CSS sprites.\n. > About polygon clipper, do you know any light-weight geometry libraries, for example CGAL?\n\nhttp://www.angusj.com/delphi/clipper.php\n. > Convert two column into one column;\n\nWhat do you do when figure spans two columns?\n. Confirmed. [Here's the HTML](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4305166/typeface.html.zip) from my machine using the latest `master`. \n\nThe problems are:\n- p4 - large \"Be\" text too low\n- p5 - large \"abg\" text has wrong spacing\n- p8 - missing/incorrectly placed hyperlink text\n- p12 - vertical text has wrong spacing\n\nAlso: 6, 7, 12, 13 - overlapping text due to clipping path (this is a known issue, see #39)\n\n@coolwanglu, any thoughts on what's going wrong?\n. @coolwanglu the problems I found are all regressions, I tried it with 3ed576b5c8dbcad72ed7ba71d122a30add2e400e and works fine except for the vertical text on p12. Maybe a problem with the newer state tracking code?\n. @Toneti777 you could probably use JavaScript with a CSS3 transform\n.

Hardware acceleration is not a panacea. Mobile devices have a limited memory devoted to the GPU, and once you fill this, performance degrades or the browser crashes. Mixing non-accelerated with accelerated elements can cause rendering problems. Hardware acceleration tends to be to the detriment of font anti-aliasing, but this varies a lot between browsers and platforms.\n\nSo yes, it's worth looking at, but don't assume you can hardware-accelerate a 10MB+ DOM\n. There's also the CSS `clip` property which supports a rectangular clipping path, which is widely supported http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visufx.html#clipping\n. I have code which discards text which is completely outside the clipping area   . I don't do anything fancy with css clip, but this could be added for partially-clipped text. I already approximate the clipping area to a rectangle for visibility checking.\n\nI can probably commit the code in the next day or so.                               \n\nOn 4 Apr 2013, at 17:02, Lu Wang notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> @jahewson \n> Yeah, I meant that property actually, both of them have been introduced in html5rocks link\n> \n> I've just taken a look at Crocdoc's output of the \"typeface\" PDF, not surprised by their solution.\n> \n> I'm about to work on this issue.

Multiple pages are [part of SVG 1.2 Full](http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-SVG12-20041027/multipage.html), however SVG 1.2 Full was abandoned, and replaced by SVG 1.2 Tiny which some browsers support, but it does not include multiple pages.\n\nThe next version of SVG will be SVG 2.0, at some point in the distant future.\n. That Firefox bug has \"Status: RESOLVED FIXED\" since October 2012.\n\nI'm using Firefox 18, and web fonts now print correctly :smile: \n. Printing pdf2htmlEX output in Chrome (23) is broken for me - I always get a single blank page. However, Chrome _can_ print webfonts, because http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Kavoon prints fine.\n. @purem font files are big, you don't really want to be serving up multiple formats if you can avoid it - especially as pdf2htmlEX embed the fonts as base64 data URIs.\n\nTrueType works cross-browser everywhere except oldIE, which isn't supported by pdf2htmlEX. FontForge can't generate EOT files anyway. WOFF is now a viable option too, it's essentially a gzipped ttf file.\n\n@coolwanglu maybe WOFF should be the default font format?\n. > I remember that WOFF did not works for all...\n> \n> Embedding is optional, so it's ok if you generate multiple files, and load\n> one of them according to the browser.\n\nThere's no point - all browsers that currently support WOFF already support TrueType.\n. > So now here are the things to do\n> ...\n> - Set a separate CSS file for printing, basically to change units (px->pt)\n\nNo need, [a CSS pixel is a 1/96\"](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#absolute-length-units).\n. > But what's wrong with ttf?\n\nNothing really. WOFF files are compressed OTF files, so there's a size advantage. WOFF is supported almost everywhere worth bothering with now.\n\nEDIT: turns out WOFF is not supported on Android.\n. TrueType is a good default, keep it as it is. Serving up gzipped TrueType with `content-encoding: gzip` is going to work everywhere except oldIE.\n. > I meant the px and pt thing, I will have to create two sets of rules, for different media.\n\nHa ok. To get different rules for different media you need a [CSS media query](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/) for `print` which overrides your usual styles. This is similar to the WebKit stroked text hack I used.\n. > Best for iOS Safari -> SVG\n\n@purem, that's very out of date. TTF has been supported since iOS 4.2, and WOFF since iOS 5.0.\n. > IE only has partial support of TTF with @font-face.\n\nNot really. Just turn off the font's \"installable\" flag in the TTF header. \n\n@coolwanglu, does pdf2htmlEX do this? It needs to if not...\n. > SVG has best compatibility, its good to have it there just in case. Its minimal effort anyway.\n\n@purem - no, they're not supported by Firefox or IE. That's hardly \"best compatibility\". They don't contain hints so look like rubbish on Windows. A few years ago they were the only way to get web fonts on mobile, but not anymore.\n. > Not sure if this will fix for IE <9, due to the html 5 tags used.\n\nIE <9 only supports EOT fonts, which FontForge can't produce.\n. @purem, ok that's more like it, though the original post said \"best\", not \"best compatibility\". From a compatibility point of view it's a waste of time serving SVG fonts to iOS < 4.2 users, because that's only the first generation iPod Touch and iPhone. You're talking <1% of iPhone users, stuck on 5 year old technology.\n\n> Supporting more browsers will not be that much work and is a good thing.\n\nIt's a huge amount of work to actually test on these browsers, and you need to use an ancient iPhone which hasn't been updated to iOS 4.2. That's the wasted time, not the time it takes to code it. I guess you could just output the SVG font, stick it in the @font-face and hope for the best, but you have no idea if it actually works or not. Does the html and CSS for pdf2htmlEX content even render on iOS < 4.2 anyway, given that it's HTML5? Fonts are only one aspect of browser support.\n. > That is what I meant, they are still two rules.\n\n@coolwanglu what exactly is the problem with that?\n. Yes, lots to do!\n. Ok I found out why printing is broken in Chrome, it ignores absolute content when deciding the page size. There's a simple fix:\n\n**1. delete the following CSS attributes from `#pdf-main`:**\n\n``` css\nposition: absolute;\ntop: 0; \nleft: 0;\nbottom: 0;\nright: 0;\n```\n\n**2. add the declaration:**\n\n``` css\nbody {\n   margin: 0;\n}\n```\n\nNow printing in Chrome will work. It still needs some improvement though...\n. Looks like CSS has page-breaks http://davidwalsh.name/css-page-breaks\n. > Does `body {margin:0}` remove the page margin when printing ?\n\nNo, but this might:\n\n``` css\n@page {\n    margin: 0;\n}\n```\n\nUltimately the print margins are decided by the browser, OS, and print driver.\n. @haisum why not use Yum?\n. I mean use Yum to install Poppler and FontForge\n. It's not the usual behaviour of PDF readers to re-scale on a page-by-page basis. I just checked Adobe Acrobat, Chrome, and OSX Preview, and non of them do that. The standard method is \"Zoom to Fit\" where the entire document is scaled by a single factor. This is the same behaviour as `--fit-width <arg>` provides.\n\n@Simanas, `--fit-width` and `--zoom` are mutually exclusive. If you're trying to fit to a given width such as 960px then use `--fit-width`. If you're trying to implement \"Zoom to Fit\" then you'll need to do that in CSS in the browser. However if you're trying to zoom each page with it's own specific scale, then this is not a standard feature of PDF viewers, as it is _no longer a faithful rendering of the document_. If you want to do that, then I'd recommend pre-processing the PDF via another tool.\n\nMy vote is that pdf2htmlEX should stick to doing one thing and do it well, and avoid feature creep.\n. @Simanas a _conversion_ should faithfully reproduce the input, just in a different format. You're wanting to _manipulate_ the output by re-sizing individual pages, which actually means you're breaking the concept of page size.\n\nSo while re-scaling individual pages may fix your problem, it is fundamentally wrong. You can easily manipulate a PDF file in this manner using other tools, before converting the file with pdf2htmlex. There is no need to change pdf2htmlex to achieve this.\n\nIf you can achieve your goal by manipulating a PDF file beforehand, then you can see it is not a good candidate feature for pdf2htmlex. There has to be a separation of concerns, there's no point re-implementing functionality which you can get from existing tools\n. The fact is that PDF is a fixed layout format, and breaking that breaks what a PDF fundamentally is. In a broader context if you're genuinely concerned about content then you shouldn't be using PDFs in the first place!\n\nThere's nothing to stop you pre-processing your PDFs to mess-up their pages sizes, go for it, it's your call. Use pdf2htmlex as one of many stages in your conversion pipeline, there is no need to add a new feature to pdf2htmlex, for the same reason that pdf2htmlex doesn't need to rotate pages, or crop pages, or do OCR, or support in-browser annotations and generate a new annotated PDF file, or send e-mail.\n\nOn 29 Jan 2013, at 14:57, Simanas notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Ok now we are clear.

I may have found a solution to this problem. Placing a non-absolutely positioned `<div>` at the start of the page fixes it:\n\n``` html\n<div id=\"pdf-main\">\n  <div class=\"d\" style=\"width:595.320000px;height:841.920000px;\">\n    <div id=\"p1\" data-page-no=\"1\" class=\"p\">\n      <div class=\"b\" style=\"background-image:url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAA...5CYII=');background-position:0 0;background-size:595.320000px 841.920000px;background-repeat:no-repeat;\">\n      <div><!-- adding this empty div gives the page some non-absolute content--></div>\n      <div style=\"left:70.824000px;bottom:760.780000px;\" class=\"l t1 h0\">\n        <span class=\"f1 s1 c0 l0 w0 r0\">Lorem ipsum...\n```\n\nEdit: actually I may have been confused about the original problem - this is a fix for flickering/blinking when changing the selection quickly, not jumping. Though the original post did mention that the selection \"blinks\".\n. I was using Chrome 23 on OS X - it may be a Chrome bug...\n. It's relatively common, but was a poor decision on the part of the OCR program - it should have used hidden text rather than just placing an image over the text. Obviously it's too late to do anything about that.\n\nPoppler's **pdftohtml** has some code to handle this specific problem at [line 522 of HtmlOutputDev.cc](http://fossies.org/dox/poppler-0.22.0/HtmlOutputDev_8cc_source.html#l00522) which is probably a good starting point.\n\n``` c++\n522   //----- discard duplicated text (fake boldface, drop shadows)\n523   if( !complexMode )\n524   { /* if not in complex mode get rid of duplicate strings */\n525     HtmlString *str3;\n526     GBool found;\n527     while (str1)\n528     {\n529         double size = str1->yMax - str1->yMin;\n530         double xLimit = str1->xMin + size * 0.2;\n531         found = gFalse;\n532         for (str2 = str1, str3 = str1->yxNext;\n533             str3 && str3->xMin < xLimit;\n534             str2 = str3, str3 = str2->yxNext)\n535         {\n536             if (str3->len == str1->len &&\n537                 !memcmp(str3->text, str1->text, str1->len * sizeof(Unicode)) &&\n538                 fabs(str3->yMin - str1->yMin) < size * 0.2 &&\n539                 fabs(str3->yMax - str1->yMax) < size * 0.2 &&\n540                 fabs(str3->xMax - str1->xMax) < size * 0.2)\n541             {\n542                 found = gTrue;\n543                 //printf(\"found duplicate!\\n\");\n544                 break;\n545             }\n546         }\n547         if (found)\n548         {\n549             str2->xyNext = str3->xyNext;\n550             str2->yxNext = str3->yxNext;\n551             delete str3;\n552         }\n553         else\n554         {\n555             str1 = str1->yxNext;\n556         }\n557     }       \n558   } /*- !complexMode */\n```\n. Oh I see... that's annoying. I thought the image was a Type 3 font, but it's not - it really is an image.\n.

I've worked extensively with xpdf and poppler in the past, so I'm happy to contribute were I can.\n. http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4305166/OCL%202.2%20Spec.html\n\nnote: Dropbox forces the encoding to ASCII in the HTTP header, which breaks things.\n. `gcc version 4.2.1 (Based on Apple Inc. build 5658) (LLVM build 2336.11.00)`\n.

Travis is free hosted _continuous integration_ for GitHub, it does a build after every commit, this is great because:\n- it integrates with GitHub to let you know that a Pull Request won't break the build (see the green \"good to merge\" banner above)\n- it lets you add a a real-time [status image](http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/status-images/) to your GitHub page, to let others know that **master** will work\n- it's used by Mozilla, Rails, node.js, and is rapidly becoming the _de facto_ standard for high quality open source projects\n- potentially, you could add some tests and get Travis to run them, which lets you know that Pull Requests don't cause a regression, and likewise lets your users know that **master** does not contain regressions.\n. Ok, this Pull Request is ready now. You'll need to sign-in with Travis with your GitHub account and enable automatic building of coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX for the README status image to work.\n. > It's hard to memorize, unless you support the prefix for all flags, like --enable/disable or --with/without in autoconf.It\n\nYeah, I see what you mean.\n\n> It's annoying to change the default value, and there might be compat[ability] problems. \n\nI didn't think of that.

It's a crappy font format anyway.\n\n> OpenType Fonts may have suffixes .otf, .ttf or .ttc\n\nThis doesn't matter, the suffixes are not stored in the PDF file.

If your goal is old browser support, then supporting old fonts is not necessarily enough.\n. > The first declaration is for IE9 / IE10 as EOT is the prefered font\n\nEOT is only needed for IE <= 8, IE10 supports WOFF and TrueType, IE9 supports TrueType (with \"installable\" flag set). \n. > To support anything before IE 9 you need to use EOT.\n\nYes, but FontForge won't produce EOT files. Another tool will be needed...\n. > I'll try to find an IE8 first though...\n\nTry https://browserlab.adobe.com/en-us/index.html\n. No its not an IE bug, its a feature. Any font embeded in a PDF is presumably already licensed for embedding. The problem is that bit 2 and bit 3 set embedding only and printing/viewing only which are valid on the context of embeded fonts in a PDF.\n\nThe purpose of the restrictions is to stop the entire font being reproduced, but pdf2htmlEX is dealing with subsetted fonts, so it's probably not an issue. It my turn out that PDF generators just clear this bit anyway - I've not encountered it.\n\nThere's a simple workaround - serve WOFF to IE9.\n. Documentation here http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/os2.htm#fst\n. **Workaround:** serve WOFF to IE9 via http://www.kltf.de/kltf_notes_ie9ttfembeddingbits.htm.\n. The PDF file you linked to works fine for me on OS X, can you post the HTML file please? Also what browser/version are you using?\n. @coolwanglu it seems that the glyphs in the embedded font files have been stretched...\n. I'm using the same version of fontforge, but that's quite an old poppler you've got there\n. I can't reproduce this either\n. I'm confused, you're talking about `#pdf-main` but you'ved edited `#pdf-outline`. The table of contents goes in  `#pdf-outline` such as in [this pdf](http://acroeng.adobe.com/Test_Files/bookmarks//PDFLOverview.pdf)\n. Ok, but removing`position:absolute` breaks the lazy page loading code in pdf2htmlEX.js. Try a multi-page document... you'll only see the first page.\n. ...it really does break the page loading in pdf2htmlEX.js this is not a PDF-specific issue. Only the first page is visible in any converted PDF.\n. Also it completely messes up the **outline**. Did you intend this, or has the change just not been tested?\n. There's a reason why these elements use absolute positioning - you can't just turn it off and expect things to work. By removing the absolute positioning you've broken the **outline** - this is obviously the only possible impact of the changes you've made... it's what _has_ to happen when you change `absolute` -> `static`. It's got nothing to do with my PDF files.\n. I figured out why we were seeing different results with multi-page documents **without an outline** - I was applying your CSS change manually via Chrome's inspector, but the lazy loading code in `pdf2htmlEX.js` had already hidden all subsequent pages.\n\nWhen I modify the `manifest` file with your changes, then I see the same result as you. However, you've still broken the lazy loading code - pages are supposed to be loaded _as they are scrolled into view_, but the JavaScript code relies on `absolute` positioning logic. Instead, with your change _all pages are immediately visible_, which is ok for your test document but will cause degraded performance on longer documents with lots of images. You'll need to update the lazy loading logic in `pdf2htmlEX.js` to account for non-`absolute` positioning.\n\nNone of this affects the **outline**, which is still broken. Do you know what an outline is?\n. Try using TrueType fonts\n. I just tried it myself with the latest code from `master`, and can confirm that there is a bug. Font settings make no difference.\n. > Is there any way I/you/someone could check if this is an inherent problem in the source PDF that this project can do little about or if this is an actual bug? A particular program or something I could use on Ubuntu to check the PDF?\n\nThe stretched fonts are certainly a bug in pdf2htmlEX, but the weird spaces are probably due to PDF being a poor format for storing text, and so the readers have to \"infer\" where the spaces are, there is a `--space-threshold` parameter to control this which you might like to experiment with. If that doesn't solve it then the weird spaces are probably also a pdf2htmlEX bug.\n. Thanks!\n. +1, reducing the number of `<div>`s and `<span>`s will be a huge boost to performance.\n. Could sub/superscripts use CSS `vertical-align` with a _length_ ?\n. Hi @iclems, I have a similar background - familiarity with Poppler, and now starting to make some small contributions to pdf2htmlEX. I'm actually working on #39 at the moment, rather slowly.\n\nThis issue - reducing the number of divs - is in my opinion one of the most important because of the impact on performance. I'd recommend trying out some of your typical PDFs and seeing if any features you care about are missing - that's how I ended up adding stroked text.\n. > 10% performance gain\n\nWould that be DOM memory, HTML file size, or frame rate?\n. Ok. Btw - I think you should keep the un-optimized text generation mode, and have a flag `--optimize-text` which is `1` by default, for debugging.\n. Have you tried looking at the DOM memory in the Chrome's Task Manager?\n. > @jahewson what does proportional memory (the last column) mean?\n\n@coolwanglu the columns should be:\n- **Resident:** Amount of memory that is present in physical RAM.\n- **Shared:** Amount of memory that is present in physical RAM and can be shared with another process.\n- **Private:** Amount of memory that is present in physical RAM and can not be shared with another process.\n- **Virtual:** Amount of address space allocated in virtual memory.\n\nThe most important value is _Resident_, which is the first column. So you're seing a 23% reduction in RAM with your optimizations - great! (93MB -> 72MB)\n. @iclems, yep these are tricky issues:\n\n> - \"z-index\" issue : the eternal issue with the approach consisting in placing everything that is not text in the background takes place one you have \"elements\" hiding text (a lot of designers do it in InDesign => they just hide some text elements with a white square, or put an image on top of it and never remove the text behind) = it's quite complicated to find an issue to this issue as it would involve for each object to check its \"visibility\"\n\nIt could be done by sending all the drawing commands to a polygon clipper, and pruning any text which gets drawn over (where the text rectangle intersects the drawing polygon). It's a very big job.\n\nAlternatively, if each drawing command was rendered to a separate transparent PNG image, then the problem goes away, as does the problem below.\n\n> - reducing the background-image issue : part of the poppler speed issue is due IMO to the rasterizing of the big background-image. In some cases, I have noticed that a non transparent background color can lead to generating one big image for each page. Do you know anything about this ? Do you consider it an issue ? I had as well been working a year ago on a custom approach trying to cut the background image in non-empty smaller images which would just be positioned absolutely. What do you think ?\n> \n> [...] best would be to be able to put the background color in CSS and have a \"per image\" absolute positioning\n\n \"per image\" absolute positioning, for image objects that's fine, but what about paths? These would need to be rendered into separate images, it _could_ be done.\n\nThe simplest approach might be to keep track of the min/max x and y values used for drawing, and crop the background to that size.\n. > I wonder if per-path images would introduce too many overhead.\n\nThere's only one way to find out...\n\n> For example, why people use CSS sprites?\n\nBecause they look good on retina displays, and scale well with zoom. I don't think that size or overhead are the reasons people choose CSS sprites.\n. > About polygon clipper, do you know any light-weight geometry libraries, for example CGAL?\n\nhttp://www.angusj.com/delphi/clipper.php\n. > Convert two column into one column;\n\nWhat do you do when figure spans two columns?\n.

Would that transform the clip too?\n\nOn 8 Apr 2013, at 15:48, Lu Wang notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> GfxState already provides clip x/y min/max in user space\n> Translating into user space would bring more error in the estimation\n> Actually I don't need coordinates in user-space, the HTML file is in the device space, so probably the format will be\n> \n> <div clip=\"...\">\n> <div>text line 1</div>\n> <div>text line 2</div>\n> </div>\n> \n> <!-- clip bbox changed -->\n> \n> <div clip=\"...\">\n> <div>text line 1</div>\n> <div>text line 2</div>\n> </div>\n> \n> For each line, if I want to add the clip property, I will need to translate the clip-bbox into text-space, not user-space\n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Ok, so the clip div is in device space. Seems like it should work then.\n\nOn 8 Apr 2013, at 16:48, Lu Wang notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> yes, clip is evaluated before transform. \n> but in my example, I created outter div elements for clipping, and \n> transform are applied on inner div elements. \n> \n> On Monday, April 8, 2013, John Hewson wrote: \n> \n> > Yeah that could work, I thought divs were transformed though?

    "Toneti777": "Hello, how do you render the pages after transform the pdf with --split-pages??\n\nDo you have any example?\n\nI try it and include in the new html page de link to the css and make accesible the images... after include a code of one .page in a div of that page..\n\nIn the view I see the image first and after the text without format..\n\nI will apreciate some help... thanks..\n. Thanks for the trick..\n\nI don't know if I can help you...\nI don't use de pdfhtmlEx.js but if I use \"display:none\" in the pageContainer element when it isn't on the actual view I'll improve the swipping page performance..\n. Here are a complex example..\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5581427/lanuevaespana_oviedo_20130909.pdf\n\nI have some problems when try to zoom in an out quickly on ipads..The rendering is slower than android and sometimes safari or chrome suddenly closes.\n\nLet me know when you have the sample for delete the link.\n. It would be a great improvement if you can modify a little factors of background image. I need to obtain a smaller file size too.\nIn the last comment you said \"compressionString is for TIFF only\"...\nDoes the project have any options to choose the exit format of the background image?\n\nThanks a lot and sorry about my English...\n. Ok, and how do you specify the format? Maybe if I can obtain images in jpeg they have a smaller size than png.\nI don't see the option in the man page...\nI tried \"--fmt jpeg\" like pdftohtml or \"--jpeg\" like pdftocairo..but I got \"invalid option...\"\n\nThanks @coolwanglu \n. Ok, this would be a great improvement..\n\nExample: File png -> 2 MB  /// convert file.png file.jpeg /// file.jpeg -> 400 KB.  The images have the same width/hight and the same aspect at a glance.\n. Ok, I'll try it and return feedback.\nTranks.\n. I've reviewed the code of pdf2htmlEX.js and I think there is bug if you try to use the rescale function...\n\nI saw that this function is not being used in any case since the line of \"this.zoom_fixer();\" is comment...\n\nIn my opinion it work better if you delete these lines:\nthis.p.height(this.b.height() \\* this.set_r);\nthis.p.width(this.b.width() \\* this.set_r);\n\nThese lines produce that text don't render well because change the size of pc div two times...\n. In my tests only delete the two lines works well..\n. Sorry, you're rigth...If I no change the paga size the slower content is displayed well but in a piece of page...\n\nThe problem apear when try to resize de page...'divs' with text don't resize well and hava a bad position..\n. Ok, you are rigth. We create this PDF with a merge of a lot of single page PDF and this merge  dose not detect duplicated fonts.\nI'm going to change the merge process.\n\nIt would be a great improvement detect duplicated fonts even by the name or type font.\n\nThanks.\n. Even a test with a good merge pdf with a 20 diferents fonts (view in adobe acrobat pro). The pdf2htmlEX increase the number of exit font files when I execute program with a major number of pages procesess.\n. An example... please download and tell me for erase it...\n\nThanks..\n. I'll apreciate very much the solution of this topic...\nI think other people agree.\nIt would help to improve the charge time minimizing requests.\n. I'm not agree with you..\nAt first I thank that you are right and saw the pdf properties and is true that it had a duplicated fonts..\n\nThe problem is that I optimized the pdf with Acrobat and deleted duplicate fonts and other optimizations...it weigth 3 times less.\n\nAfter I run the conversion and I obtain the same number of font files in both cases (786).\n\nI think that is good idea rewiew this issue..\n\nThanks a lot..\n\nI share the 2 pdf examples for you...Tell me when can I delete the link...(The first without optimization)\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s....\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/4qty0xje...\n. I do that!\nAnd I obtain duplicated fonts too..\nIn both cases the result of pdf2htmlEX is the same...\n. Yes..\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/lbfrnr10c6qcbv8/lne.pdf\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/6i0e78qj88o3450/lne_opt.pdf\n. Sorry for delay... I was on hollidays..\n\nI check it out in Acrobat or Adobe reader and the first one have 132 (and you can see how repeat the name of font) but the optimization one only around 40 fonts.\n. I think this isn't out of scope, becouse in the optimized one there are only one font refer for one binary. In this case, the pdf2htmlEX library create lot of output files for the same font.\n\nI can't do anything in this case, if my input file have the same reference for all the ocurrences of the same \"stored\" font and the library duplicate them..\n\nI and other people will apreciate you if you can check it out..\n\nThanks..\n. This library is awesome but for complete my project with garanties I need to reduce the size and files that the process creates. \nI'll apreciate very much some improvements about duplicate fonts problem. A lot of people that use large pdf can take advantage.\n. I have try the solution, but don't work for me.\nI still have a lot of duplicate fonts on pdf2htmlEX result.\n\nI receive this...\n\n-ERROR>Working: 0/48\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-11][2014-10-24 08:57:44,238]-ERROR>No glyph for the key character to derive standard width and height.\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-11][2014-10-24 08:57:44,238]-ERROR>For the latin script, this key character is `o' (U+006F).\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-11][2014-10-24 08:57:44,305]-ERROR>No glyph for the key character to derive standard width and height.\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-11][2014-10-24 08:57:44,305]-ERROR>For the latin script, this key character is`o' (U+006F).\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-11][2014-10-24 08:57:44,758]-ERROR>No glyph for the key character to derive standard width and height.\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-11][2014-10-24 08:57:44,759]-ERROR>For the latin script, this key character is `o' (U+006F).\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-11][2014-10-24 08:57:44,829]-ERROR>No glyph for the key character to derive standard width and height.\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-11][2014-10-24 08:57:44,830]-ERROR>For the latin script, this key character is`o' (U+006F).\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-11][2014-10-24 08:57:45,103]-ERROR>No glyph for the key character to derive standard width and height.\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-11][2014-10-24 08:57:45,104]-ERROR>For the latin script, this key character is `o' (U+006F).\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-11][2014-10-24 08:57:45,179]-ERROR>No glyph for the key character to derive standard width and height.\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-11][2014-10-24 08:57:45,180]-ERROR>For the latin script, this key character is`o' (U+006F).\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-11][2014-10-24 08:57:45,338]-ERROR>No glyph for the key character to derive standard width and height.\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-11][2014-10-24 08:57:45,338]-ERROR>For the latin script, this key character is `o' (U+006F).\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-11][2014-10-24 08:57:45,405]-ERROR>No glyph for the key character to derive standard width and height.\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-11][2014-10-24 08:57:45,406]-ERROR>For the latin script, this key character is`o' (U+006F).\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-11][2014-10-24 08:57:45,469]-ERROR>No glyph for the key character to derive standard width and height.\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-11][2014-10-24 08:57:45,469]-ERROR>For the latin script, this key character is `o' (U+006F).\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-11][2014-10-24 08:57:45,635]-ERROR>No glyph for the key character to derive standard width and height.\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-11][2014-10-24 08:57:45,635]-ERROR>For the latin script, this key character is`o' (U+006F).\n. @yu-liang-kono In my case, optimization with GS like:\ngs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile='optimize.pdf' -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH original.pdf\nonly remove a few fonts, remains more than 500.\n\nIn your python optimization then number of fonts have been reduce to 132.  The problem here is that the font result on the visualization isn't the same than before..\n\nYou can try with this pdf:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/ba1tzdx7lpyoe36/prePDF_fddd5.pdf?dl=0\n\nI tried another gs optimizations, and I've proved other libraries but I don't find a good result.\n\nThanks\n. During the process you generate page by page result.\nI think you read the fonts used in each page and add them to result.\nYou don't check if actual font has already created in previous pages.\n\nI think this is a solution.\n. My solution is: convert de png files into jpg... and change ref in the html code..\n\nmogrify -format jpg *.png\nmogrify -despeckle -quality 30 -trim *.jpg\n\nsed -i 's/.png/.jpg/g' *.page\n\nI reduce size of background image in a 10X rate...\n.

Finally I update poppler via git and all work correctly..\n\nThanks\n. I think I have problems on Internet Explorer related to this problem.\nOn Internet Explorer 10 it's a error, no warning.\n. On IE10 there is still the same error yet..\n\nI test it in otf and woff format embed in css file.\n\nThe error said : \"CSS3111: @font-face encountered unknown error\"\n. I've tried to run changing some parameters and I havn't found any good chance..\n\"--space-as-offset\" make a random catpital letters in text..\nIs there a solution while we wait for the \"extra fonts\"?\nCan I find what fonts have problems or reformat the pdf?\n\nThanks in advance.\n. The best option form me is ...\n\n --tounicode 0 --optimize-text 1 --space-as-offset 0\n\nI obtain a good solution with this paramenters...\n\nThanks..\n. Ok, I've seen now...\n\nIt isn't so good than first appearance...\n\nThanks.\n\nThis library is better...I only miss lighter html code and solve duplicated fonts problem..;-)\nVery good job..\n. High optimization without lose accurate.\n\nI've proved to reduce the amount of html elements of the html result...\n\nI've found a patter that could be useful...I can't improve like this changing library parameters.\n\n1 - Found neighbors divs (corresponding to lines) that have the same \"m x h fs fc sc ls ws\" classes...\n2 - Remove the span elements and join all text of this divs in only one div.\n3 - Remove the divs excess.\n4 - Put a width size to div. Sum the all divs height and update the div height. Deduct the dib removed height to \"bottom\" atribute. Change \"white-spaces\" to \"inherit\". Add \"line-heiht\" and letter-spacing.\n\nNow text flows through the div space and you can obtain the similar result...I'll prove it on a Crhome debugger...\n\nMaybe is dificult to obtain the line-height or letter-spacing...but I think the improvement will be tremendous...\n\nWhat do you think??\n. In 1) I have one problem about how calculate the width of line when merge two or more lines. The library build one div by line and I think it might be inprove. I manually try it and it's perfect but I'm lost to find width for a automatic process, maybe inside your library is easier.\n\nIn 2) I try to delete the span elements with very low value in margin-left attribute. For my pdfs on each line, library puts a lot of span elements between letters of each word. Most of them have a low value and it might be fixed with letter-spacing or word-spacing on div element. I obtain a much less complex html output.\n. I get the same error...\nI think there is no problem about pdf...I try with test pdf and get the same error.\n. I can install new fontforge updating kernel of debian distribution..This alow me to install last versions of dependences.\n\nBut I still get the same \"segfault\" error...\n\n....\nPreprocessing: 95/96\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-27][2014-07-28 11:44:03,323]->Preprocessing: 96/96\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-27][2014-07-28 11:44:03,326]->Add new temporary file: /tmp/pdf2htmlEX-eLGkwb/__pages\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-27][2014-07-28 11:44:03,327]->Working: 0/96\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-27][2014-07-28 11:44:04,104]->Install font 1: (868 0) TJZMAA+Amplitude-Regular\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-27][2014-07-28 11:44:04,106]->Add new temporary file: /tmp/pdf2htmlEX-eLGkwb/f1.cff\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-27][2014-07-28 11:44:04,107]->Embed font: /tmp/pdf2htmlEX-eLGkwb/f1.cff 1\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-27][2014-07-28 11:44:04,297]->/RENR/usr/local/datos/AplicacionesJava/convertirPDF.sh: l\u00c3\u00adnea 97: 32607 Violaci\u00c3\u00b3n de segmento  pdf2htmlEX --debug 1 --use-cropbox 1 --printing 0 --embed-external-font 1 --embed cFijo --split-pages 1 --tounicode 0 --optimize-text 1 --space-as-offset 0 --font-format woff --font-size-multiplier 6.0 --bg-format jpg --dest-dir $rutaDestino $rutaPdf --page-filename ${nombrePDF##*\\/}%03d.page\n.

Hello, how do you render the pages after transform the pdf with --split-pages??\n\nDo you have any example?\n\nI try it and include in the new html page de link to the css and make accesible the images... after include a code of one .page in a div of that page..\n\nIn the view I see the image first and after the text without format..\n\nI will apreciate some help... thanks..\n. Thanks for the trick..\n\nI don't know if I can help you...\nI don't use de pdfhtmlEx.js but if I use \"display:none\" in the pageContainer element when it isn't on the actual view I'll improve the swipping page performance..\n. Here are a complex example..\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5581427/lanuevaespana_oviedo_20130909.pdf\n\nI have some problems when try to zoom in an out quickly on ipads..The rendering is slower than android and sometimes safari or chrome suddenly closes.\n\nLet me know when you have the sample for delete the link.\n. It would be a great improvement if you can modify a little factors of background image. I need to obtain a smaller file size too.\nIn the last comment you said \"compressionString is for TIFF only\"...\nDoes the project have any options to choose the exit format of the background image?\n\nThanks a lot and sorry about my English...\n. Ok, and how do you specify the format? Maybe if I can obtain images in jpeg they have a smaller size than png.\nI don't see the option in the man page...\nI tried \"--fmt jpeg\" like pdftohtml or \"--jpeg\" like pdftocairo..but I got \"invalid option...\"\n\nThanks @coolwanglu \n. Ok, this would be a great improvement..\n\nExample: File png -> 2 MB  /// convert file.png file.jpeg /// file.jpeg -> 400 KB.  The images have the same width/hight and the same aspect at a glance.\n. Ok, I'll try it and return feedback.\nTranks.\n. I've reviewed the code of pdf2htmlEX.js and I think there is bug if you try to use the rescale function...\n\nI saw that this function is not being used in any case since the line of \"this.zoom_fixer();\" is comment...\n\nIn my opinion it work better if you delete these lines:\nthis.p.height(this.b.height() \\* this.set_r);\nthis.p.width(this.b.width() \\* this.set_r);\n\nThese lines produce that text don't render well because change the size of pc div two times...\n. In my tests only delete the two lines works well..\n. Sorry, you're rigth...If I no change the paga size the slower content is displayed well but in a piece of page...\n\nThe problem apear when try to resize de page...'divs' with text don't resize well and hava a bad position..\n. Ok, you are rigth. We create this PDF with a merge of a lot of single page PDF and this merge  dose not detect duplicated fonts.\nI'm going to change the merge process.\n\nIt would be a great improvement detect duplicated fonts even by the name or type font.\n\nThanks.\n. Even a test with a good merge pdf with a 20 diferents fonts (view in adobe acrobat pro). The pdf2htmlEX increase the number of exit font files when I execute program with a major number of pages procesess.\n. An example... please download and tell me for erase it...\n\nThanks..\n. I'll apreciate very much the solution of this topic...\nI think other people agree.\nIt would help to improve the charge time minimizing requests.\n. I'm not agree with you..\nAt first I thank that you are right and saw the pdf properties and is true that it had a duplicated fonts..\n\nThe problem is that I optimized the pdf with Acrobat and deleted duplicate fonts and other optimizations...it weigth 3 times less.\n\nAfter I run the conversion and I obtain the same number of font files in both cases (786).\n\nI think that is good idea rewiew this issue..\n\nThanks a lot..\n\nI share the 2 pdf examples for you...Tell me when can I delete the link...(The first without optimization)\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s....\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/4qty0xje...\n. I do that!\nAnd I obtain duplicated fonts too..\nIn both cases the result of pdf2htmlEX is the same...\n. Yes..\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/lbfrnr10c6qcbv8/lne.pdf\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/6i0e78qj88o3450/lne_opt.pdf\n. Sorry for delay... I was on hollidays..\n\nI check it out in Acrobat or Adobe reader and the first one have 132 (and you can see how repeat the name of font) but the optimization one only around 40 fonts.\n. I think this isn't out of scope, becouse in the optimized one there are only one font refer for one binary. In this case, the pdf2htmlEX library create lot of output files for the same font.\n\nI can't do anything in this case, if my input file have the same reference for all the ocurrences of the same \"stored\" font and the library duplicate them..\n\nI and other people will apreciate you if you can check it out..\n\nThanks..\n. This library is awesome but for complete my project with garanties I need to reduce the size and files that the process creates. \nI'll apreciate very much some improvements about duplicate fonts problem. A lot of people that use large pdf can take advantage.\n. I have try the solution, but don't work for me.\nI still have a lot of duplicate fonts on pdf2htmlEX result.\n\nI receive this...\n\n-ERROR>Working: 0/48\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-11][2014-10-24 08:57:44,238]-ERROR>No glyph for the key character to derive standard width and height.\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-11][2014-10-24 08:57:44,238]-ERROR>For the latin script, this key character is `o' (U+006F).\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-11][2014-10-24 08:57:44,305]-ERROR>No glyph for the key character to derive standard width and height.\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-11][2014-10-24 08:57:44,305]-ERROR>For the latin script, this key character is`o' (U+006F).\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-11][2014-10-24 08:57:44,758]-ERROR>No glyph for the key character to derive standard width and height.\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-11][2014-10-24 08:57:44,759]-ERROR>For the latin script, this key character is `o' (U+006F).\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-11][2014-10-24 08:57:44,829]-ERROR>No glyph for the key character to derive standard width and height.\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-11][2014-10-24 08:57:44,830]-ERROR>For the latin script, this key character is`o' (U+006F).\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-11][2014-10-24 08:57:45,103]-ERROR>No glyph for the key character to derive standard width and height.\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-11][2014-10-24 08:57:45,104]-ERROR>For the latin script, this key character is `o' (U+006F).\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-11][2014-10-24 08:57:45,179]-ERROR>No glyph for the key character to derive standard width and height.\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-11][2014-10-24 08:57:45,180]-ERROR>For the latin script, this key character is`o' (U+006F).\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-11][2014-10-24 08:57:45,338]-ERROR>No glyph for the key character to derive standard width and height.\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-11][2014-10-24 08:57:45,338]-ERROR>For the latin script, this key character is `o' (U+006F).\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-11][2014-10-24 08:57:45,405]-ERROR>No glyph for the key character to derive standard width and height.\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-11][2014-10-24 08:57:45,406]-ERROR>For the latin script, this key character is`o' (U+006F).\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-11][2014-10-24 08:57:45,469]-ERROR>No glyph for the key character to derive standard width and height.\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-11][2014-10-24 08:57:45,469]-ERROR>For the latin script, this key character is `o' (U+006F).\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-11][2014-10-24 08:57:45,635]-ERROR>No glyph for the key character to derive standard width and height.\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-11][2014-10-24 08:57:45,635]-ERROR>For the latin script, this key character is`o' (U+006F).\n. @yu-liang-kono In my case, optimization with GS like:\ngs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile='optimize.pdf' -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH original.pdf\nonly remove a few fonts, remains more than 500.\n\nIn your python optimization then number of fonts have been reduce to 132.

During the process you generate page by page result.\nI think you read the fonts used in each page and add them to result.\nYou don't check if actual font has already created in previous pages.\n\nI think this is a solution.\n.

Finally I update poppler via git and all work correctly..\n\nThanks\n. I think I have problems on Internet Explorer related to this problem.\nOn Internet Explorer 10 it's a error, no warning.\n. On IE10 there is still the same error yet..\n\nI test it in otf and woff format embed in css file.\n\nThe error said : \"CSS3111: @font-face encountered unknown error\"\n. I've tried to run changing some parameters and I havn't found any good chance..\n\"--space-as-offset\" make a random catpital letters in text..\nIs there a solution while we wait for the \"extra fonts\"?\nCan I find what fonts have problems or reformat the pdf?\n\nThanks in advance.\n. The best option form me is ...\n\n --tounicode 0 --optimize-text 1 --space-as-offset 0\n\nI obtain a good solution with this paramenters...\n\nThanks..\n. Ok, I've seen now...\n\nIt isn't so good than first appearance...\n\nThanks.\n\nThis library is better...I only miss lighter html code and solve duplicated fonts problem..;-)\nVery good job..\n. High optimization without lose accurate.\n\nI've proved to reduce the amount of html elements of the html result...\n\nI've found a patter that could be useful...I can't improve like this changing library parameters.\n\n1 - Found neighbors divs (corresponding to lines) that have the same \"m x h fs fc sc ls ws\" classes...\n2 - Remove the span elements and join all text of this divs in only one div.\n3 - Remove the divs excess.\n4 - Put a width size to div. Sum the all divs height and update the div height. Deduct the dib removed height to \"bottom\" atribute. Change \"white-spaces\" to \"inherit\". Add \"line-heiht\" and letter-spacing.\n\nNow text flows through the div space and you can obtain the similar result...I'll prove it on a Crhome debugger...\n\nMaybe is dificult to obtain the line-height or letter-spacing...but I think the improvement will be tremendous...\n\nWhat do you think??\n. In 1) I have one problem about how calculate the width of line when merge two or more lines. The library build one div by line and I think it might be inprove. I manually try it and it's perfect but I'm lost to find width for a automatic process, maybe inside your library is easier.\n\nIn 2) I try to delete the span elements with very low value in margin-left attribute. For my pdfs on each line, library puts a lot of span elements between letters of each word. Most of them have a low value and it might be fixed with letter-spacing or word-spacing on div element. I obtain a much less complex html output.\n. I get the same error...\nI think there is no problem about pdf...I try with test pdf and get the same error.\n. I can install new fontforge updating kernel of debian distribution..This alow me to install last versions of dependences.\n\nBut I still get the same \"segfault\" error...\n\n....\nPreprocessing: 95/96\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-27][2014-07-28 11:44:03,323]->Preprocessing: 96/96\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-27][2014-07-28 11:44:03,326]->Add new temporary file: /tmp/pdf2htmlEX-eLGkwb/__pages\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-27][2014-07-28 11:44:03,327]->Working: 0/96\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-27][2014-07-28 11:44:04,104]->Install font 1: (868 0) TJZMAA+Amplitude-Regular\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-27][2014-07-28 11:44:04,106]->Add new temporary file: /tmp/pdf2htmlEX-eLGkwb/f1.cff\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-27][2014-07-28 11:44:04,107]->Embed font: /tmp/pdf2htmlEX-eLGkwb/f1.cff 1\n INFO-es.renr.gdr.hemeroteca.utils.StreamControl-[Thread-27][2014-07-28 11:44:04,297]->/RENR/usr/local/datos/AplicacionesJava/convertirPDF.sh: l\u00c3\u00adnea 97: 32607 Violaci\u00c3\u00b3n de segmento  pdf2htmlEX --debug 1 --use-cropbox 1 --printing 0 --embed-external-font 1 --embed cFijo --split-pages 1 --tounicode 0 --optimize-text 1 --space-as-offset 0 --font-format woff --font-size-multiplier 6.0 --bg-format jpg --dest-dir $rutaDestino $rutaPdf --page-filename ${nombrePDF##*\\/}%03d.page\n.

WOW! Exactly, CSS transforms not supported and --font-size-multiplier 1 make a great change! Thank you, results seems acceptable, I will test it deeper on older browsers.\n. Well, it's a bit complex and results are not great.\nUsing  --font-size-multiplier 1 results can be acceptable because viewer depend less on css transform, that are not supported by IE8.\nIE8 has zoom property that are similar to transform:scale() so you can patch the code to use zoom property, but it's not a definitive solution. In many cases you can't rely only on scale (think about rotated text/pages). You can think about using -ms-filter with the transformation matrix provided by pdf2htmlEX, but you can't set the transformation origin in IE8, so you should also do a translation matrix after that. Here's some details:\nhttp://www.useragentman.com/IETransformsTranslator/doc.html\nhttps://github.com/heygrady/transform/wiki/correcting-transform-origin-and-translate-in-ie\n\nThan you should convert fonts to EOT.\n\nAnyway try with --fallback 1 and you get raster image of the pdf with transparant text overlied (be careful: position of the transparent text is the same as with --fallback 0).\n. Screenshot is not useful since nothing happen.\n\nTell me if I'm wrong, I go to\nhttp://coolwanglu.github.io/pdf2htmlEX/demo/cheat.html\n\nAnd in console I do:\n\n``` javascript\n$('#page-container').html('');\nviewer = new pdf2htmlEX.Viewer({\n    container_id : 'page-container', \n    sidebar_id : 'sidebar',\n    outline_id : 'outline',\n    page_urls : [\n'cheat1.page','cheat2.page','cheat3.page','cheat4.page','cheat5.page','cheat6.page','cheat7.page','cheat8.page','cheat9.page','cheat10.page']});\n```\n\nand then\n\n``` javascript\nviewer.rescale(1.1, true);\n```\n\nNothing happen.\n. In Firefox 20 and Chromium 25 on Ubuntu 13.04 I get this:\n![schermata del 2013-05-07 14 26 02](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/511434/471181/0b610acc-b712-11e2-82f6-a0783f836401.png)\n\nFor IE8 compatibility I will try using zoom in place of CSS transform (http://stackoverflow.com/a/7806191/930720).\n. Ok, no problem. Just to report.\nThank you.\n. I was wondering: can I use a relative unit of measurement (em in place of pt) and change font-size to zoom content?\n. And what about applying CSS transform to the whole page? e.g.  `$('#pf1').css('transform', 'scale(0.5)');`\n. no, now transform is applied to #pc1 and height and width are changed in #pf1\n. I find the problem:\n\n``` css\n.pc {\n...\nwidth: 100%;\nheight: 100%\n...\n}\n```\n\nThe page is scaled with css transform on .pc and width and height are changed on .pf,\nso when I rescale div .pc is scaled both by css transform and by inherit width/height by .pf.\n\nI think solutions can be:\n1) css transform on .pc and width/height on .pd, setting absolute pc width/height.\n2) css transform on .pd (where w0 and h0 are set) fixing spacing between pages.\n\nAm I right?\n. I've already fixed it, take a look at branch zoomfix of https://github.com/micred/pdf2htmlEX\n\nI've also add fit_width/fit_height.\nAnyway I've not done a pull request yet because I'm not satisfied with the user experience: zoom works but, as you know, page flickers when zooming because 1) content is hidden, 2) page_frame is resized and 3) the content shown up again.\nI've tried to prevent hiding and putting a CSS3 transition to zoom in and zoom out, but looks bad because content (pc) is zoomed smoothly but frame (pf) is not tied to. Here a video:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Re0yOcE0h4&feature=youtu.be\n\nI have a suggestion to resolve the problem and give a better user experience but it's needed to add a div and I don't know if you agree.\nIf we apply CSS transform to page_decoration (pd) we can have a fluid result and without flickering, but we have to add a div for layout (e.g. pl). pl will be parent of pd and will change in height as now is page_decoration (but with overflow:hidden).\n\nWhat do you think about it?\n. eheh, sorry for my english :-) \nAs you see in the video, scaling of the frame is not tied to scaling of the content. So if you want to avoid hide-show flickering you see: resize of the frame, resize and reflow of the content separately.\n. Yes, I've applied transformation on `pf` but if page border is on `pd` results are not good, because animation is not in sync as I said above. And it's slow due to content reflow when changing `pd` size.\nHonestly I've no idea how to do it smoothly without adding a new `<div>`.\nI can apply transformation to `pd` but I don't like it because positioning will be mess up.\n. ok :-)\nlet's work to a solution that let's us easily implement 2-pages view or a more advance page layout.\n. Sounds good, I can't see any drawbacks at the moment. OK create a new\nbranch, in the weekend I'm merging my mods to it. I've also done some nice\ntweaks, like keeping the page view aligned while zooming.\n. Which offset? border and padding on `pd` are 0px and top/bottom margin are fixed. No? I don't get the point\n. Border of `pd` should be 0px right now. I don't understand, what's the exact problem? Push the new branch so I can take a look.\n. Sure, I'll do as soon as I can.\n. I've do my best integrating smooth scrolling as I thought but I am in a dead line. There is a time gap between CSS transform and HTML re-positioning (when changing height) that make all the stuff choppy.\nAnyone wants to help can see results on my `rescale_fix` branch, I'll dismiss it.\n\nAnyway I find a nice way to import the changes on the main branch (without pf/pd switched).\n\nTake a look at the pull request.\n. Sure, give me a couple of days I'm out of town.\n. No, you are wrong, if user set NR_PAGES_TO_PRERENDER_ON_ZOOM = 0, behavior is like the current and CPU usage is no more than the current.\nIn that case algorith is like you set: user zoom, all pages are hidden, after a delay they are redrawn (schedule_render).\n\nIf user want a more reactive UI, he can set NR_PAGES_TO_PRERENDER_ON_ZOOM to an integer (suggested value 4). In that case when user zoom and pages shown in the viewer are less then 4, the pages are zoomed instantly, without being hidden and redraw after a delay (function schedule_render).\n\nWhich global handlers do you mean? Let me know.\n. ok, I understand your focus, I'll make a few changes but there are no problems if you don't want to merge this UI stuff in your code.\n. @iapain please define \"slow\", rendering is slow? scrolling is sluggish? zooming?

Screenshot is not useful since nothing happen.\n\nTell me if I'm wrong, I go to\nhttp://coolwanglu.github.io/pdf2htmlEX/demo/cheat.html\n\nAnd in console I do:\n\n``` javascript\n$('#page-container').html('');\nviewer = new pdf2htmlEX.Viewer({\n    container_id : 'page-container', \n    sidebar_id : 'sidebar',\n    outline_id : 'outline',\n    page_urls : [\n'cheat1.page','cheat2.page','cheat3.page','cheat4.page','cheat5.page','cheat6.page','cheat7.page','cheat8.page','cheat9.page','cheat10.page']});\n```\n\nand then\n\n``` javascript\nviewer.rescale(1.1, true);\n```\n\nNothing happen.\n. In Firefox 20 and Chromium 25 on Ubuntu 13.04 I get this:\n![schermata del 2013-05-07 14 26 02](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/511434/471181/0b610acc-b712-11e2-82f6-a0783f836401.png)\n\nFor IE8 compatibility I will try using zoom in place of CSS transform (http://stackoverflow.com/a/7806191/930720).\n. Ok, no problem. Just to report.\nThank you.\n. I was wondering: can I use a relative unit of measurement (em in place of pt) and change font-size to zoom content?\n. And what about applying CSS transform to the whole page? e.g.  `$('#pf1').css('transform', 'scale(0.5)');`\n. no, now transform is applied to #pc1 and height and width are changed in #pf1\n. I find the problem:\n\n``` css\n.pc {\n...\nwidth: 100%;\nheight: 100%\n...\n}\n```\n\nThe page is scaled with css transform on .pc and width and height are changed on .pf,\nso when I rescale div .pc is scaled both by css transform and by inherit width/height by .pf.\n\nI think solutions can be:\n1) css transform on .pc and width/height on .pd, setting absolute pc width/height.\n2) css transform on .pd (where w0 and h0 are set) fixing spacing between pages.\n\nAm I right?\n. I've already fixed it, take a look at branch zoomfix of https://github.com/micred/pdf2htmlEX\n\nI've also add fit_width/fit_height.\nAnyway I've not done a pull request yet because I'm not satisfied with the user experience: zoom works but, as you know, page flickers when zooming because 1) content is hidden, 2) page_frame is resized and 3) the content shown up again.\nI've tried to prevent hiding and putting a CSS3 transition to zoom in and zoom out, but looks bad because content (pc) is zoomed smoothly but frame (pf) is not tied to. Here a video:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Re0yOcE0h4&feature=youtu.be\n\nI have a suggestion to resolve the problem and give a better user experience but it's needed to add a div and I don't know if you agree.\nIf we apply CSS transform to page_decoration (pd) we can have a fluid result and without flickering, but we have to add a div for layout (e.g. pl). pl will be parent of pd and will change in height as now is page_decoration (but with overflow:hidden).\n\nWhat do you think about it?\n. eheh, sorry for my english :-) \nAs you see in the video, scaling of the frame is not tied to scaling of the content. So if you want to avoid hide-show flickering you see: resize of the frame, resize and reflow of the content separately.\n. Yes, I've applied transformation on `pf` but if page border is on `pd` results are not good, because animation is not in sync as I said above. And it's slow due to content reflow when changing `pd` size.\nHonestly I've no idea how to do it smoothly without adding a new `<div>`.\nI can apply transformation to `pd` but I don't like it because positioning will be mess up.\n. ok :-)\nlet's work to a solution that let's us easily implement 2-pages view or a more advance page layout.\n. Sounds good, I can't see any drawbacks at the moment. OK create a new\nbranch, in the weekend I'm merging my mods to it. I've also done some nice\ntweaks, like keeping the page view aligned while zooming.\n. Which offset? border and padding on `pd` are 0px and top/bottom margin are fixed. No? I don't get the point\n. Border of `pd` should be 0px right now. I don't understand, what's the exact problem? Push the new branch so I can take a look.\n. Sure, I'll do as soon as I can.\n. I've do my best integrating smooth scrolling as I thought but I am in a dead line. There is a time gap between CSS transform and HTML re-positioning (when changing height) that make all the stuff choppy.\nAnyone wants to help can see results on my `rescale_fix` branch, I'll dismiss it.\n\nAnyway I find a nice way to import the changes on the main branch (without pf/pd switched).\n\nTake a look at the pull request.\n. Sure, give me a couple of days I'm out of town.\n. No, you are wrong, if user set NR_PAGES_TO_PRERENDER_ON_ZOOM = 0, behavior is like the current and CPU usage is no more than the current.\nIn that case algorith is like you set: user zoom, all pages are hidden, after a delay they are redrawn (schedule_render).\n\nIf user want a more reactive UI, he can set NR_PAGES_TO_PRERENDER_ON_ZOOM to an integer (suggested value 4). In that case when user zoom and pages shown in the viewer are less then 4, the pages are zoomed instantly, without being hidden and redraw after a delay (function schedule_render).\n\nWhich global handlers do you mean? Let me know.\n. ok, I understand your focus, I'll make a few changes but there are no problems if you don't want to merge this UI stuff in your code.\n. ",

Definitely not looking for a \"native\" resolution; I'm already using the hdpi/vdpi options. What I am looking is a way for the `div.pd` width & height to match the dimensions of its background image. \n. So, for example, using `--vdpi=300` and `--hdpi=300` I always get an image at 2700 x 2700px. (Using the same sample.pdf I provided in my other filed Issue: http://db.tt/EljRDO2s)\n\nExamples:\n\n`pdf2htmlEX --zoom=1 --vdpi=300 --hdpi=300 --single-html=0 --split-pages=1 sample.pdf`\n\nResults in `div.pd` sized at `648.024 x 648.024px`\n\n`pdf2htmlEX --zoom=2 --vdpi=300 --hdpi=300 --single-html=0 --split-pages=1 sample.pdf`\n\nResults in `div.pd` sized at `1296.048 x 1296.048px` \n\nGoing to `--zoom=3` results in `1944 x 1944px` and so on...\n\nUsing `--fit-width=x --fit-height=y`:\n\n`pdf2htmlEX --fit-width=2700 --fit-height=2700 --vdpi=300 --hdpi=300 --single-html=0 --split-pages=1 sample.pdf`\n\nResults in `div.pd` sized at `2471.277966 x 2471.277966px`\n\nHow can I get `div.pd` to be the same size as the background image, in this case 2700 x 2700px?\n. Thanks\n. Interesting. I just checked pdftotext and see similar results. \n\n```\nSTEP 2: Repeat step 1 about\nforty times!

Otherwise we can remove problem divs manually... but an automated option is ideal even if it's simply a flat image for problem pages.\n. Sorry I haven't had a chance to test in Acrobat, yet. I will look at it tonight.\n\nRegarding `--font-size-multiplier`, is there any expectation that a value of 1 can result in the extracted text containing unexpected spaces?\n\nI have a case where a value of `1` may result in `L orem ip sum dol or sit amet...` and the default `4` results in the expected `Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...` in the HTML fragment that is output by pdf2htmlEX. In my mind the multiplier would only affect the font-size and CSS transform, but I admit I'm not well versed on the internals of the PDF format. \n\nCan provide a sample (or open another issue.)\n. Thanks. I'll comment over there in the morning. \n\n(Sorry if this task was redundant; but in the meanwhile it might serve as useful information for anyone that is compiling fontforge from source before installing pdf2htmlEX and are running into this. I only happened upon your bug report through a search of `_FVMenuSaveAs`. _sigh_)\n. We would like to reduce the file size of the CSS, as our intended use of the output does not target printing. Additionally, we output this to a tablet device that does not support media types. Right now I just remove that entire block in post-processing, but having the `--printing` option here would be a plus. Thank you!\n.

(Using the same sample.pdf I provided in my other filed Issue: http://db.tt/EljRDO2s)\n\nExamples:\n\n`pdf2htmlEX --zoom=1 --vdpi=300 --hdpi=300 --single-html=0 --split-pages=1 sample.pdf`\n\nResults in `div.pd` sized at `648.024 x 648.024px`\n\n`pdf2htmlEX --zoom=2 --vdpi=300 --hdpi=300 --single-html=0 --split-pages=1 sample.pdf`\n\nResults in `div.pd` sized at `1296.048 x 1296.048px` \n\nGoing to `--zoom=3` results in `1944 x 1944px` and so on...\n\nUsing `--fit-width=x --fit-height=y`:\n\n`pdf2htmlEX --fit-width=2700 --fit-height=2700 --vdpi=300 --hdpi=300 --single-html=0 --split-pages=1 sample.pdf`\n\nResults in `div.pd` sized at `2471.277966 x 2471.277966px`\n\nHow can I get `div.pd` to be the same size as the background image, in this case 2700 x 2700px?\n. Thanks\n. Interesting. I just checked pdftotext and see similar results. \n\n```\nSTEP 2: Repeat step 1 about\nforty times!

Otherwise we can remove problem divs manually... but an automated option is ideal even if it's simply a flat image for problem pages.\n. Sorry I haven't had a chance to test in Acrobat, yet. I will look at it tonight.\n\nRegarding `--font-size-multiplier`, is there any expectation that a value of 1 can result in the extracted text containing unexpected spaces?\n\nI have a case where a value of `1` may result in `L orem ip sum dol or sit amet...` and the default `4` results in the expected `Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...` in the HTML fragment that is output by pdf2htmlEX. In my mind the multiplier would only affect the font-size and CSS transform, but I admit I'm not well versed on the internals of the PDF format. \n\nCan provide a sample (or open another issue.)\n. Thanks. I'll comment over there in the morning. \n\n(Sorry if this task was redundant; but in the meanwhile it might serve as useful information for anyone that is compiling fontforge from source before installing pdf2htmlEX and are running into this. I only happened upon your bug report through a search of `_FVMenuSaveAs`. _sigh_)\n. We would like to reduce the file size of the CSS, as our intended use of the output does not target printing. Additionally, we output this to a tablet device that does not support media types. Right now I just remove that entire block in post-processing, but having the `--printing` option here would be a plus. Thank you!\n.

Say we have a pdf document in which the first page is 30 cm wide, all other pages are only 15 cm wide. This is a common case when some of the pages in pdf documment are flipped in 90 degrees.\nWe want to convert this document in to one html document where every page is exactly 960px wide. Now if I we set --fit-width to 960 (typical web page width) only pages that are 30cm wide will be 960px and the rest ones will be 430px wide. So --fit-width-every feature should fit every page in pdf document to desired width when conversion performed.\nI have looked a little bit to the code and noticed that you are calculating zoom factor for entire document. In this case zoom factor should be calculated for every page to fit desired width/height.\n. In my personal opinion not to do something, just because others don't do it, blocks you from developing better software. Although yet this best pdf 2 html converter in the WORLD! :) \n\nWhy to modify html with js on the fly if you are 100% sure that you want all pages to be 960px wide. It just overhead for the browsers.\n\nOk I will hack the code by my self.\n. Anyway you are the boss here! :) But I think this is a common situation, since output is html and input is a pdf. As we know pdf is for maintaining original look of the content in a fixed format/layout, while html is for the content it self to deliver it online. So here we have a conceptual collision. You have done a remarkable job by implementing precise conversion, but to make this converter even more sophisticated I would say it is about the time to start improving its abilities to convert from one concept to the other.  Don't you think so? :)\n. I agree the name is annoying to me to ... how about just one parameter --zoom-every: [1/0] ?\nAnd great idea to make a voting :) So my vote you alredy know :+1: \n. This is why I have suggested parameter --zoom-every. If set to 1 it would use --fit-width/height --zoom to zoom EVERY page to desired zoom level, if --zoom-every is not set or set to 0 it would perform as usual.\n. Hmmm... since it should affect only --fit-width/height parameters, we may name it --fit-every instead of --zoom-every and it would work only if --fit-width/height is presented.\n. I made this improvement because I really needed it, although c++ is not my favorite language. If I needed this, there is a high probability that it will be needed for someone else in the future. \nSince you share your code, I share my improvement to. Anyway you are the master here and you decide include this to your master branch or not. :) \nThere is no need to provide any pdf file to prove that pdf's with different page sizes exists. They just exists.\n. In most cases that I have seen is that some of the pages are flipped 90 degrees. For example some report where most of the pages are in portrait mode, but some are in landscape because they contain charts, tables etc... \n. Because in real life it is meant to be read in landscape mode, while the others in portrait, therefore an author of pdf file had flipped these pages 90 degrees so you don't have to rotate your computer screen, while trying to read such a page of a report via adobe acrobat reader.\n\nBut this is not the only case... Since every page in a pdf document can have its own width/height and it is absolutely acceptable in pdf document (you can easily zoom in and zoom out with any pdf viewer), it may  be absolutely unacceptable when you want to produce one consistent 960px wide html document. \n. Man you are blocked your self really serious! razamobin gaved you a perfect example of such a document! There is plenty of them all around the world and if you want to convert unlimited amount of documents to html where html document always has to be exactly 960px in width you are stuck if you do not have this option in your converter! \n\nIf you want your product to be the best you have to click \"accept button\" in your head and here more often!\n\nSorry for my anger, but you drive me crazy with this. I have done all the work, it is only one option now which is perfectly functional and all you have to do is to click accept.\n. whatever...\n. So please tell me is this piece of software is aimed to serve as a pdf VIEWER or is it aimed to be a CONVERTER, because all your args are from series: \"Usual pdf viewers do not have such a functionality, therefore...\"\n\nIf it is only a VIEWER, than please apologize me, I was to emotional. The less options you have, the more easy to use and understand your viewer gets, since you just plug the pdf and pull the html. I agree, than it has to bee simple as 2 \\* 2. Afterwards it is probably the most complicated way to represent pdf documents on the web. \n\nBut if you treat it as a CONVERTER, then you would probably like to have a bunch of possible options to produce converted result that suits to your needs the best. The more options you can chose from before you start processing the a unlimited amount of files, the more universal and flexible CONVERTER gets.\n. Ok now we are clear. Now I understand your vision.\n\nI think, that if you are converting something from one format to the other you should think not only on how to convert it so that it would be exactly the same looking and acting thing like it was in the original format, but you have to think on the different concepts of formats. \n\nAs I mentioned earlier pdf is dedicated to representa a content in a FIXED style and layout, while HTML has a very different manner. It is intended to represent CONTENT in a format that is the best for web browser. \n\nYou will probably never want to manipulate original pdf layout sizes to fit them to e.g. 960dpi, since it is intended to be as it was originally designed, but if you want to extract the content from those layouts and display it on a screen, you will need this solution.\n\nIt makes me a perfect sense to have such an option in this converter, since you are converting from one concept of data visualization to the other. I treat it not as a manipulation, because I see this piece of software in a much broader, than just technical context.\n. I know I can use different tools to achieve this but it makes me no sense. I see that we are in a never ending discussion and I think that there is no one \"best\" way how to treat this. \n\n> The fact is that PDF is a fixed layout format, and breaking that breaks what a PDF fundamentally is\n\nI think we are already breaking things down just by converting a content form pdf to html. \nWe are pulling out a html not pdf, so why we should bother our selves on how to not break fundamental pdf rules? It makes me no sense to follow pdf rules, since it is no longer a pdf document. \nWhy not to add as much as possible flexibility to create true HTML, not only a replica of pdf in a html format.\n.

Thanks Lu, I meant the latter all along.

Now there's several ways to tinker include paths with cmake or make files created by it. I chose adding /usr/share/local/poppler in the `include_directories` statement of CMakeLists.txt. which solved it. And the equivalent for `ink_directories`. Any idea about why the environment variables might not take effect?\n. I'm still curious about why the environment variables have no effect... \nbut that aside in case you'd care commenting a bit further about the build - it appears that with my fresh successful build, I get `Error: Cannot open the manifest file`, which is solved by `make install`. Could I avoid that last step, and run my built project without the `install` phase which sprinkles files into global directories and requires sudo privilege? \n. Well, I am set up now, many thanks.\nMaybe I'd fix the \"building\" document if I were sure the env variables were\nnot my setup issue. It would just hope it is not necessary to run `sudo\nmake install` after every compilation...\n\nOn Tue, May 19, 2015 at 3:11 PM, Duan Yao notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> It seems a problem of cmake, although I don't know why.

    "duanyao": "@coolwanglu \nI have implemented [\"covered text handling\"](https://github.com/duanyao/pdf2htmlEX/commits/covered_text_handling) initially.\nCharacters covered by images are detected and (1) are made transparent in text layer, (2) are drawn in background layer.\n\nThere are still things to do:\n- Fix SplashBackgroundRenderer. The covered text handling requires that text layer is drawn before background, but SplashBackgroundRenderer currently doesn't support this mode, so only svg bg works for now.\n- Detect characters covered by paths.\n- Handling clip area.\n- Speed. The hitting test algorithm is naive, may be slow for complicated pages.\n- Merge neighboring transparent chars. Now each char has a `<span>`.\n. - The only public interface is `std::vector<bool> & HTMLRenderer::get_chars_covered()`. Optimization could be done in `HTMLRenderer::add_non_char_bbox(double * bbox, int index)` who makes hitting test.\n- We have to do char-drawing at least two passes, one for hitting test, one for selective drawing on background. The problem is, how to hint the second pass which chars should be drawn? I don't know a better way than a `chars_covered` array. I'm afraid the data structures used internally in the first pass is irreverent here.\n- The Big-O complexity of current algorithm is estimated as O(m*n), m for char count, n for non-char graphics count, if very few chars are covered. Assume each hitting test use 100 CPU cycles, and for a page where m=n=2000, the total time is 0.4G cycles, or 0.2s on a 2GHz core. This is not quite fast, but satisfying me for now, as most of my PDF pages are not that complex. \n\nThanks for recommending rtree, I'll take a look at it later.\n. Sure. Firstly I want to fix the broken SplashBackgroundRenderer, and this may introduce conflicts with [pending PR 360](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/pull/360), so I want to do it after #360 it merged.\n. @zogwarg, how did you test the \"covered text\"? Did you build [covered_text_handling](https://github.com/duanyao/pdf2htmlEX/tree/covered_text_handling) branch with `cmake -DENABLE_SVG=ON`, and pass `--correct-text-visibility 1` at runtime? It is off by default.\n\nI tested your PDF's p15, `--correct-text-visibility 1` worked as expected.\n. @bilalmughal I can reproduce your issue. However it is not related to `--correct-text-visibility`, but seems a problem of poppler(or cario)'s SVG renderer. Using poppler's `pdftocario -svg` command to convert your file, the output SVG file also looks blank in chrome, firefox, and inkscape, though shows some texts in gnome image viewer. I suggest you to report the `pdftocario -svg` bug to poppler (https://bugs.freedesktop.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=poppler&list_id=457322) if you can.\n. @bilalmughal could you post the link to the poppler's bug so that we can track the progress?\n. EOT is for IE8-, however pdf2htmlEX is not targeting at IE8-, because they don't support CSS transform, which would ruin the entire layout.\n\nIt seems ttf/otf + woff are needed to cover all modern browsers. If you don't care stock android browser before 4.4, woff is enough(http://caniuse.com/#search=woff); if you don't care IE mobile, ttf/otf is enough (http://caniuse.com/#search=ttf).\n. I also encountered this issue for some pdf files recently. \nThere are fonts share a same `DescendantFonts`, and has different `ToUnicode` tables, and these tables are compatible. In this case, I think pdf2htmlEx should be able to avoid duplicated fonts.\n\nExample:\nthe first font:\n\n```\n379 0 obj\n<<\n/BaseFont /AGKMCI+FZDBSJW--GB1-0\n/DescendantFonts [1146 0 R]\n/Encoding /Identity-H\n/Subtype /Type0\n/ToUnicode 1152 0 R\n/Type /Font\n>>\nendobj\n\n1152 0 obj\n<<\n/Length 380\n>>\nstream\n/CIDInit /ProcSet findresource begin\n12 dict begin\nbegincmap\n/CIDSystemInfo\n<< /Registry (Adobe)\n/Ordering (UCS) /Supplement 0 >> def\n/CMapName /Adobe-Identity-UCS def\n/CMapType 2 def\n1 begincodespacerange\n<0000> <FFFF>\nendcodespacerange\n4 beginbfchar\n<040B> <5143>\n<1284> <7B2C>\n<02B7> <4E00>\n<04ED> <5355>\nendbfchar\nendcmap CMapName currentdict /CMap defineresource pop end end\n\nendstream\nendobj\n```\n\nthe second font.\n\n```\n628 0 obj\n<<\n/BaseFont /YOLBEC+FZDBSJW--GB1-0\n/DescendantFonts [1146 0 R]\n/Encoding /Identity-H\n/Subtype /Type0\n/ToUnicode 1176 0 R\n/Type /Font\n>>\nendobj\n\n1176 0 obj\n<<\n/Length 380\n>>\nstream\n/CIDInit /ProcSet findresource begin\n12 dict begin\nbegincmap\n/CIDSystemInfo\n<< /Registry (Adobe)\n/Ordering (UCS) /Supplement 0 >> def\n/CMapName /Adobe-Identity-UCS def\n/CMapType 2 def\n1 begincodespacerange\n<0000> <FFFF>\nendcodespacerange\n4 beginbfchar\n<0304> <4E8C>\n<040B> <5143>\n<1284> <7B2C>\n<04ED> <5355>\nendbfchar\nendcmap CMapName currentdict /CMap defineresource pop end end\n\nendstream\nendobj\n```\n. These pdf's are produced by acrobat X's optimizer (ghostscript complains about them so no result), so I think it's unlikely that most PDF optimizers would handle this situation. After all, these structures in a pdf don't introduce much bloat.\n. @coolwanglu \nUpdate: I re-tested with ghostscript 9.10, and it does optimize these fonts in my pdf's. After that, pdf2htmlEX will not produce duplicated fonts. However, both acrobat and ghostscript have their limitations.\n\nI think this could be a low priority feature, and I suggest that people who encounter this issue give ghostscript a try. These docs may be useful:\n\n[PDF manipulation tips, Part 1 Ghostscript](http://www.peteryu.ca/tutorials/publishing/pdf_manipulation_tips)\n[Ghostscript pdfwrite options](http://git.ghostscript.com/?p=ghostpdl.git;a=blob_plain;f=gs/doc/Ps2pdf.htm;hb=master#Options)\n. @yu-liang-kono \nWould you try ghostscript to optimize your pdf? As I said above, ghostscript can probably merge fonts with same name.\n. @yu-liang-kono \nYou are welcome. Ghostscript is awesome!\n. `pointer-events: none` can disable dragging img (also disable \"copy image\" in context menu), and `user-select: none` can disable selection. If there are no known bad side-effect, I'll create a PR.\n. In the result of http://djvs.co/c4e83676-437a-46a8-8402-533faf3b622e.pdf \n\"8\"s are actually spaces, however displayed as \"8\" in that font. Why this happen is still to be investigated.\n\nEven without `--optimize-text 1`, the \"8\"s are still there, however they are wrapped in `span._`, which happen to have `color: transparent`, so looks \"correct\".\n\nSo the problem @djvs reported seems not a bug of `--optimize-text`.\n. I believe scoped CSS is a perfect solution for this type of issue, however only Firefox support it for now (http://caniuse.com/#search=scoped). There is a [polyfill](https://github.com/PM5544/scoped-polyfill) for other browsers, but I haven't tried.\n\nAnother solution is the good old iframe.\n. @coolwanglu conflict introduced by putting 2 generated htm together is still not resolved, as you discussed above. However the ability to add prefix to css is better than nothing.\n. I think random prefix is a good idea. We may let users to specify the length of prefix.\n. @Helidium No progress yet. Is iframe feasible in your case?\n. @Helidium iframes can be considered as parts of their parent document. You may also consider merging those PDFs before converting to html, if they are actually parts of one document.\n\nFor css generation codes, look at [`all_manager.xxx.install()`](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/blob/2edf41eaa1234298241e05b66b6cbadb77c0bd93/src/HTMLTextLine.cc#L159). Maybe you can add a random number to those classes for each conversion to avoid collision.\n. @dsablic You pdf is converted without setPrinting(false), the color is correct, except that the image contains \"WILEY-VCH\" at the bottom-right corner is invisible, probably due to wrong positioning. Poppler's pdftocairo also has this problem.\n\nThis image is drawn by `CairoOutputDev::drawImageMask()` method, and it walks different paths when `printing` is true/false.\n\nMy poppler version is 0.24.5.\n. @coolwanglu I checked out pdf2htmlEX v0.11, and poppler version is 0.24.5.\n. 1. Let `BackgroundRenderer::render_page()` returns an 'image' or something may require quite a few refactors, and make `HTMLRenderer::process` a little more complicated. I'd like to find a better way.\n2. Maybe we can count drawing commands in `CairoOutputDev`, and throw an exception if it exceeds a given limit? `HTMLRenderer::process` can catch the exception and fall back to `SplashBackgroundRenderer`. However, I'm not sure this is enough, I see that `CairoOutputDev` is also used by type3 font rendering.\n   PS, I think counting the number of <'s is OK because <'s in XML text are escaped, and comments, processing instructions, CDATAs, and DTDs are rare in SVG. \n. I see, I'll keep `CairoOutputDev` untouched.\n\n`svg_nodes_limit` is applied to individual pages, and only pages' with too many svg nodes fall back to bitmap bg, other pages are not affected, so that the overall quality will not be degraded too much.\nSo exit-and-re-run is not an alternative.\n. Currently HTMLRenderer don't care about the actual type of `bg_renderer`, it's just a `BackgroundRenderer`. Not all BackgroundRenderer's sub classes need a fallback, and only the sub-class known which sub-class it want to fall back to. so I'd rather add an optional property 'fallback_renderer' to HTMLRenderer:\n\n```\nfallback = bg_renderer->get_fallback_renderer();\nbg_renderer->init(doc);\nif (fallback != nullptr)\n  fallback->init(doc);\n...\n\nbg_renderer->render_page(...);\nif(!bg_renderer->ok() && fallback != nullptr)\n{\n   fallback->render_page(...);\n}\n...\n\nif(bg_renderer->ok())\n  bg_renderer->embed_image(pageNum);\nelse\n  fallback->embed_image(pageNum);\n```\n\nHowever, I don't think this approach is cleaner than the original implementation.\n. OK, I'll try this way.\n. Please hold the merging, I'll rebase the branch.\n. Rebased ok.\n. All problems are fixed, I think.\n. It depends on how browsers apply same-origin policy to local files.\nFirefox [allow access to local files in same dir](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Same-origin_policy_for_file:_URIs);\nChrome doesn't allow access to local files by default, but has some [command line options to enable it](http://joshuamcginnis.com/2011/02/28/how-to-disable-same-origin-policy-in-chrome/).\nIE doesn't allow access to local files.\n. I fixed the order.\n. I found a bug in this patch, please wait.\n. The bug is fixed.\n. PDF call the jpeg image's filter `DCTEncode`.\n. @coolwanglu \nIs there still any problem?\n. Now the code is cleaned and rebased to incoming.\n. Just because these 2 features have some interopration, so I rebased #360 on #356. #356 can be closed.\n. It seems I'm unable to change a PR's base branch, even if I've rebased my branch. So I created a new one #364.\n. Repaced with #365\n. You are welcome. [My company](http://mainbo.com) is evaluating pdf2htmlEX for e-textbook applications so I need to improve this tool to meet our requirements. I'd like to also thank you for this excellent tool!\n. Now stroked path handling is improved by breaking path into steps, each step forms a bbox and takes part in the covering test.\n. I use cairo because CairoOutputDev already depends on cairo, and I can borrow some codes from it. If there are more suitable 2D graphics library, we can make another version of DrawingTracer.\n\nCairo also has apis to check the bounding box of area changed, e.g. cairo_fill_extents, cairo_stoke_extents, and are already used. But we want to do more than that, e.g. [break path being stroked into steps](https://github.com/duanyao/pdf2htmlEX/commit/96b8438a45c0365ea64afadbffe86e2b7cfe7659).\n\nPartially covered/clipped chars are treated as covered chars.\n\nHTML lacks support of universial drawing (except canvas). Fallback mode with SVG works fine. However texts are converted to paths, and may result in quite complicated, bloated SVG, which makes mobile devices had to render. That's one of the motives of this patch.\n. A very initial implemantion of this patch doesn't depend on cairo, but can only handle text covered by image, and the clip is not considered. If some users definitedly don't want cairo, we may degrade DrawingTracer to that level.\n. > Another way of tackling this is to render a hidden text layer and a full svg -- but we export the fonts in the current way and use them inside SVG -- which might sound clearer.\n\nYes, a pure SVG solution is probably the final answer, if the rendering performance is not degraded significantly. Maybe a hidden text layer is not necessary, because firefox has already been able to select texts in SVG. \n. > How about a chat some time, I'm not sure how I can help. Especially I really want to convince the poppler people to expose more about the CairoOutputDev interfaces.\n\nI' OK for a chat. I'm not sure what type of CairoOutputDev interfaces we need at this time.\n. > At some point we might move forward to the svg backend, and in this case, I think it might makes more sense to break the background image into parts and actually make them overlap with each other in HTML\n\nYou mean interleaving SVG and HTML elements? I think this can be quite complex to implement, and breaking a single big SVG into several small ones may offer almost no size or performance benefits. Using SVG exclusively may be better.\n. @coolwanglu Sorry I was stuck on an bug and didn't check my email. Now I've managed to join #pdf2htmlEX.\n. @coolwanglu I made some improvements.\nHow about the option name? Is `--correct-text-visibility` OK?\n. Well, I'll use `--correct-text-visibility` then.\n. @coolwanglu option name changed.\n. I have made some PDFs for testing, I'll submit some later.\n. @cdeblois give `incoming` branch a try please. If the problem still persisits, please fill a bug with a sample PDF page.\n. Almost. Note that you should `cmake -DENABLE_SVG=ON .`, or `--correct-text-visibility` only has limited capbility.\n. This patch is a little tricky, because GfxState is probably not expected to be changed by the OutputDev code. So I try to not affect other drawing behaviors by saving/restoring GfxState. \nHowever, there are still PDFs that are not rendered with expected color in proof mode.\n. This patch has been improved significantly: \n1. Move most code to `BackgroundRenderer`, duplicated codes are removed. \n2. Use a new `GfxState` instance to 'chreat' `OutputDev`, instead of save/restore mechanism. \n3. Set proof color in `beginString()` instead of `beginTextObject()` because color can be changed inside text object.\n4. Select proof color according to color distance.\n. Inside a PDF text object, the color can be changed (e.g. by `g` operator), but I don't known whether save/restore operators can be used there. Even if save/restore works, the code is more complex and costly.\n. @coolwanglu Do you think `--proof 1` (rendering text in bg in original colors) is useful? I always use `--proof 2` myself.\n. Is it OK to remove the original-color mode? So this option would be easier to remember and use. \n. That's right, so I leave it.\nIn future we may always fill and stroke the texts in bg in different colors, say red/white, then no matter what the bg color is, the texts are visible. This technology has been used by some subtitles of video.\n. @coolwanglu problems fixed\n. With the latest commit, no matter what the bg color is, the texts on bg are visible.\n. This fix 2 issue:\n1. render modes rather than 0 (fill) are often set inside text objects, if we only save render modes in beginTextObject, we loose track of them.\n2. if text matrix rotates by 45 degree, one of `lx` and `ly` is transformed to 0, so the line width is set to 0, which is not correct. So change line width to 1/70 diagonal of font size.\n\nAnothor thing: `--proof 2` use fill & stroke for background texts, however in PDF stroke can overwrite part of the filled area, which makes small sized text less legible. What I really want is something like CSS `text-shadow`, but I don't known how to achieve this. \n. Oh I wasn't aware of that. Reverted output-filename.\n. Some of the issues are probably due to the old poppler you are using, try poppler 0.26 or higher.\nSome of the issues can be reproduced by myself, however you'd better create a separate bug report for each type issue.\n. I'm using poppler 0.26.1.\n. `poppler/Gfx.h` has not been changed between 0.26.1 and 0.26.3, so maybe your poppler was not installed properly. What system are you using?  Poppler packages for Ubuntu can be downloaded from https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/poppler .\n. Yes.\nPage-1 from VKG-ALL-IPADQUICK.pdf , Pages from VISTAIR_Brochure.pdf, Page-605 from AXM-EZD-OMD.pdf: images' color is correct as long as `--svg-embed-bitmap 0` not set, and --svg-embed-bitmap 0 should dump .jpg files.\n\nSo maybe it's a problem related to cairo? my cairo version is 1.13.1.\n\nPlease raise a separate issue for each test case. But I think the svg position/size problems is a same issue.\n. Well, if you set `--svg-embed-bitmap 0`, you should also set `--embed-image 0` or `--embed i`, or the dumped bitmaps can't be loaded.\n. It is my commit 39e171a73760c5120a7bd4c30d4fd4b06974b0b1 \"Improve covered text handling\", I'll look into it later.\nCan you send the pdf to my mail box 'duanyao at mainbo.com'? I have difficulty to access dropbox.\n. Confirmed. `--space-as-offset 1` is not handled correctly.\n. This bug occurs when both `--optimize-text 1 --space-as-offset 1` is on, and there are spaces at the beginning of a line.\nThis bug has been fixed by #406. All your sample files should be rendered correctly now.\n\nAnother tip: your files need a larger `--font-size-multiplier` (e.g. 20) to position texts accurately, see #369, and you can verify the result by `--proof 2`.\n. Reproducible on Ubuntu. pdf2htmlEX crashes in fontforge with one of its embedded fonts (`__raw_font_3.ttf`).\nFontforge GUI from the pdf2htmlEX branch (7df63eff7f9536ade6f6b9ca0525198f5c44f091) also crash with this font, however master branch (e963b7f7b27e836da64d12688550f25d5ef37d25) don't.\n. Currently there is no format conversion when `--svg-embed-bitmap 0` is set, the dumped jpg files are just copied from the PDF; in contrast, `--svg-embed-bitmap 1` may convert format (in this case jpg->png).\n\nThe dumped jpg files are actually not corrupted, they are in CMYK color space. Unfortunately, it seems most programs can't display them correctly (browsers, GIMP), except 'display' utility in imagemagick. It seems poppler is aware of this issue so it convert these images to png when producing SVG.\n\nMost open source programs use IJG libjpeg to handle jpg. When I test its djpeg utility with the dumped images (`djpeg -bmp -rgb o24.jpg`), it says \"Unsupported color conversion request\" and fails, so I doubt it support CMYK or not?\n\nSo this is arguably a bug in libjpeg or browsers. But If we can't figure out a better solution in short time, I'll workaround this issue by ignoring `--svg-embed-bitmap 0` when non-RGB/gray jpg is encountered. \n\nBy the way, it is better to convert color space of PDF to RGB before feeding to pdf2htmlEX, this not only workaround this issue, but also significantly reduces the output file size (CMYK has 4 channels). You can use acrobat or ghostscript to do this. The command for the latter can be: \n`gs -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dColorConversionStrategy=/sRGB -sOutputFile=output.pdf input.pdf`\nSee also https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Optimizing-PDF-Files\n. Update: \n\nIt seems in PDF, CMYK jpg's color is interpreted inverted against most other programs. I converted a PDF to CMYK by ghostscript and then converted it by pdf2htmlEX, and the dumped jpeg is still in inverted color.\n\nAlso 'display' utility in imagemagick seems always show CMYK jpg in inverted color, even the CMYK jpg is generated by imagemagick 'convert' utility. This happens to be consistent with PDF, so it show the images \"correctly\".\n\nI don't know much about CMYK and jpeg, maybe we have to ignore --svg-embed-bitmap 0 for CMYK jpeg.\n\n@coolwanglu any idea?\n. Further reach show that PDF does treat CMYK jpeg inverted in contrast to most other programs.\n\nIf create a PDF from a CMYK jpeg file by acrobat, the resulting image dictionary has a `/Decode [1.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 0.0]` entry, which effectively invert all color components. pdf2htmlEX can dump jpeg in this PDF without problem.\n\nThe pdf in this bug report, in contrast, don't have such inverting `/Decode` entries, and the default ones are `[ 0.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 ]`, which is an identity transform, so the dumped jpegs have inverted color.\n\nOn the other hand, if create a PDF from a RGB jpeg file by acrobat, no `/Decode` entry is presented.\n\nHowever, I can't find the statement in PDF spec saying that \"CMYK jpeg(or all format?) should be intercepted in inverted color\". Anyone can help?\n\nSo we may check the `/Decode` entry before dumping images: for cmyk jpeg, dump only if inverting `/Decode` exists; for rgb jpeg, dump only if no `/Decode` or identity `/Decode` exists.\n. @davidhedley \n Poppler and cairo create the SVG, and most of the work is done by cairo. Poppler provides a hook to allow client code to decide what to do with images inside a PDF. If client code don't want to handle images (`--svg-embed-bitmap 1`), poppler's default behavior is embedding all images into SVG, and convert format if necessary. It seems poppler decides that CMYK jpeg need to be converted (and color-inverted) to png, so the result is correct.\n. @davidhedley \nThanks! It helped a lot.  See also: [JPEG file embedded in PDF (CMYK)](https://forums.adobe.com/thread/975777).\n\nMy conclusion is: PDF readers do color conversion incompatibly with most other programs (including browsers): other programs invert CMYK color if 'Adobe' marker (app14) presents in a jpeg file; while PDF readers don't, they solely rely on /Decode array to invert color. \n\nIn your PDF, the CMYK jpegs' color is not inverted, and have no /Decode array. However they have 'Adobe' marker (you can see them by a hex editor), so if they are dumped, browsers will show them in inverted color.\n\nWhy 'Adobe' marker triggers color inverting? This is due to an old photoshop bug (according to doc of libjpeg) -- it wrote CMYK jpeg in inverted color (and wrote 'Adobe' marker), and this became a convention (sigh). However, PostScript and PDF decided not to follow this convention (sigh).\n\nNow this issue is fixed by not dumping CMYK jpeg, see #407.\n. This a a known limitation, we use bounding boxes of chars, images, and paths to evaluate chars' visibility. This is simple and fast, but sometimes too conservative.\nIn your PDF, there are some non-rectangular paths. They don't overlap any text, however their bounding boxes do, so the overlapped texts is treated as if obscured.\n. Because spaces may be remove by `--space-as-offset 1`, so previously the char indexes were changed in the text layer, which would affects covered text handling. So I insert a padding char ('\\0') as a placeholder for each removed space. Also, ligature decomposing has an opposite effect, so the decomposed chars are stored separately.\n. Then we'll need a way to maintain the mapping between the two type of texts, I suspect it is equally or more complicated.\n. How about:\n\n```\nstruct PDFChar\n{\n  State * state;\n  union\n  {\n    uint ch; // unicode\n    int decomposed_idx;\n    float offset;\n  }\n  enum \n  {\n    Character,\n    Offset,\n    Padding,\n    Ligature // ligature that to be decomposed. \n  } type;\n}\n```\n\nOffset type can add more PDFChar, however when doing covered text handling they can be easily skipped.\n\nP.S. What is the purpose of using a linked list?\n. `type == Ligature` means this PDFChar is a decomposed ligature, and `decomposed_idx` is the index of the decomposed ligature in `HTMLTextLine::decomposed_text`.\n\n`type == Offset` means this PDFChar represents a x-offset, and the value is `offset`. This replaces the `HTMLTextLine::offsets`.\n. In current implementation, \"dump\" means copy image data to external file unmodified, and this requires browsers and PDF viewers to handle the image data in a same way. Unfortunately, in case of CMYK jpeg,  this is usually not true, as I posted in bug #400.\n\nPoppler of cause can decode CMYK jpeg and do color conversion properly, but it can't re-encode image into jpeg (it can re-encode into png). Actually we can get the decoded image from poppler, but re-encoding-and-dumping feature is just not implemented yet. This means not only CMYK jpeg, images that are not jpeg can't be dumped either.\n\nI'd suggest users to pre-process their PDFs by ghostscript or acrobat, converting all images therein to RGB/Gray jpeg, to ensure that dumping works properly. This also reduces file size a lot.\n. Done, is that OK?\n. Well, it is a trade-off: we need define another marco (ENABLE_DT_DEBUG) to be able to use #if/#endif, and #if/#endif only saves one token for a 3-line DT_DEBUG group. However in most cases a single line DT_DEBUG is enough. \n. Tokens are the minimum unit of the lexer's output, i.e '#ifdef','DT_DEBUG','printf' are all tokens.\nYes, DT_DEBUG() is arguably less readable, and it is not like a function -- one should read it as a 'mini-#ifdef'.\nBut why should a macro mimic a function? If it is like a function, one should write a function instead. Macro is supposed to do things that function can't.\n. I agree DT_DEBUG() is less readable for new readers, but it only take a few seconds to read and understand its definition. When debugging, one my add quite a few DT_DEBUG() here and there, so it is important to be easy to input.\n\nIn your example, inserting non-debugging codes between related debugging code should be avoided.\n. Not for normal users. But I think other developers who want to debug positioning related bugs would find these output useful, even if not related to covered text handling.\n. My personal opinion is that the readability of  DT_DEBUG() is not that bad, and developers should not take long to be accustomed with it. This is not a new idea, `CairoOutputDev.cc` already use a similar macro `LOG()`.\n\nAlso I think `#ifdef` has its weak point in readability too: If being used too much, it clutter codes significantly. There are already many `#if ENABLE_SVG` there.\n\nSo I think we need some trade-off. Of cause, If you insist, I can change them to `#ifdef`.\n. Maybe using #ifdef for multi-line debug code is better in some sense. However if you read it as a mini-ifdef, it is perhaps not that weird.\n\n`DEBUG(printf(...))` is more flexible -- you can put any expression in it, like `cerr << ...` or a custom logging function, not just a wraper of printf().\n. Good point. I think I'll never write that. For more compicated debug codes, #ifdef is necessary.\nFor very simple loop, maybe `DT_DEBUG(for(int i=0;i<4;i++) printf(\"%d\", i);)` is ok.\n. One may want to print something to stderror instead of stdout, or just prefers C++ style cout/cerr. Also, DT_DEBUG don't hurt code highlight/assist (at least eclipse CDT ok). If we feel DEBUG_PRINTF is enough, it is better to define it as a function, not a marco, and use #ifdef in its body. However, DT_DEBUG is still  easier to implement.\n\nCurrently I don't feel it is useful for normal users to submit a DrawingTracer log, because debugging posisioning issues always needs the PDF file, and we can reproduce the issue ourselves.\n. Yes, I mean debug_printf(...) is better being implemented as a function:\n\n```\nvoid debug_printf(const char* str, ...)\n{\n#if XXX_DEBUG\n  va_list vl;\n  va_start(vl, str);\n  vfprintf(stderr, str, vl);\n  va_end(vl);\n#endif\n}\n```\n\nwe can even add logging level to the function.\n\nI also remeber that we can switch debug log by a const:\n\n```\nconst static boolean DT_DEBUG = true;\n...\nif (DT_DEBUG)\n{\n    int i;\n    do something with i;\n    cerr << i;\n}\n...\nif (DT_DEBUG) cerr << 'bla'; // Is one-line if acceptable to you?\n```\n\nThis should be even more readable than macros, and still simple. \nWhen the const is set to false, these dead codes should be optimized out.\ngcc doesn't warn this (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22852364/is-there-a-gcc-warning-for-conditional-expression-is-constant), however MSVC warns if highest warning level is enabled.\n. About \"a 'unified' function for debug messages\", I think it has a small disadvantage. Ususally we know a bug exists in a certain module, and want to see logs from that module only. If logs of from all modules are switched on at once, we'll have to filter the logs.\n. Then how about define `const static bool GLOBAL_ENABLE_LOG = true;` in a global header, and\ndefine `const static bool ENABLE_LOG = GLOBAL_ENABLE_LOG && true;` in each cpp?\n. I changed `DT_DEBUG` to a `static const bool`. Is that OK?\n. I was not familiar with `constexpr`, but it seems that [\"a constexpr specifier used in an object declaration implies const\"](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constexpr), so what's the difference?\n. I see. const in this case should also imply a compile-time constant, <del>maybe in rare case it depends on compilers?</del>while constexpr enforces a compile-time constant, so it is more clear.\n. If the generated page is renderred OK in some browsers but not in others, it is probably a bug of browsers (or in rare case, bug of web standards). For example, fontsize100.html is 'garbage' in firefox because of this bug: \nhttps://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1027580\n, and I also discussed it in #369.\n\nIf you can narrow down the relavent html/css and confirm it is a browser's bug, you may submit a bug to that browser. Of cause, it is still worthwhile to file a issue here, so that we can figure out a workaround before buggy browsers disapear.\n\nPS. I'm not able to access dropbox, maybe due to the limiation of chinese network. Could you send it to duanyao at mainbo dot com ?\n. I think this issue is actually a bug of chrome: it doesn't apply CSS `word-spacing` to the space at the beginning of a line.\n\nIf both `--optimize-text` and `--space-as-offset` is on, some lines of your converted html file contain leading spaces, and have non-zero `word-spacing` and `white-space:pre` style, so they are not rendered correctly by chrome. So this issue is not related to `--font-size-multiplier`, but `--optimize-text` and `--space-as-offset`.\n\nSimplified test case (also available [at jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/60dvtceh/)):\n\n``` html\n<div style=\"word-spacing:1em; white-space:pre; border:1px red solid;\"> Has leading  space, style=\"word-spacing:1em; white-space:pre\"</div>\n<div style=\"white-space:pre; border:1px red solid;\"> Has leading  space, style=\"white-space:pre\"</div>\n<div style=\"border:1px red solid;\"> Has leading  space, style=\"\"</div>\n```\n\nI tested other browsers, webkit also has this bug, IE11 and firefox work as expected.\n\nAccording to [CSS spec](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-text/#word-spacing-property):\n\n> Word spacing affects each space (U+0020) and non-breaking space (U+00A0), left in the text after the white space processing rules have been applied.\n\nIf `white-space:pre` is applied, leading spaces are \"left in the text after the white space processing rules  have been applied\", so `word-spacing` should be applied to them too. However, chrome/webkit always give leading spaces normal width regardless of `word-spacing`.\n\nSo we may want to report the bug to chrome/webkit (I added [one for chrome](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=404444)). Meanwhile, before browsers have fixed this bug, pdf2htmlEX should avoid generating leading spaces.\n. Done ()\n. This is a chrome/webkit bug.\n\nA simplified test case (also [here](http://jsfiddle.net/q434vyu6/2/)):\n\n``` html\n<style>\n#span1:after { /* content:''; */ }\n</style>\n<div>Any thing here.<span id=\"span1\" style=\"white-space:pre; word-spacing:-1px; display: inline-block;\"> Span1 begins with a space. <span id=\"span2\" style=\"display: inline-block;\">Span2</span></span></div>\n```\n\nIn chrome/webkit, the `#span2` is wrapped to a next line.\n\nThis problem requires quite a few conditions to reproduce:\n- one span nested in another span.\n- the inner span is the last node of the outer span.\n- the 2 spans are both `inline-block`.\n- the outer span has `white-space:pre`.\n- the outer span's text content starts with a space.\n- the outer span's `word-spacing` is negative, no matter how small it is.\n\nIf any of above conditions is not satisfied, the problem disappears.\n\nChrome/webkit actually support negative `word-spacing`, I was wrong with this.\n\nI suspect this bug is a combined effect of 2 chrome/webkit bugs:\n1. [ inline-block not honored as white-space:pre's last-child of a line](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35443)\n    Sadly, this bug was reported 4 years ago and still not fixed!\n2. [word-spacing doesn't correctly applied to leading spaces](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=404444)\n\npdf2htmlEX already has workarounds for the 2 bug. For the first one, adds a node to the end of divs:\n\n``` css\n.t:after {\n  content: '';\n}\n```\n\nFor the second one, pdf2htmlEX avoids put spaces at the beginning of divs.\n\nUnfortunately, none of them cover the nested-span situation.\n\n<del>If change `.t:after` in CSS to `.t:after, .t span:after`, this bug can be workarounded. However, I don't know the performance hit of this method. @coolwanglu, what do you think?</del>\n\nActually, chrome/webkit also don't apply `word-spacing` to the leading spaces of a `inline-block` span if the `word-spacing` is just specified on that span. So anyway we must also avoid leading spaces in a `inline-block` span which has non-zero `word-spacing`. What a mess!\n. @coolwanglu I can reproduce with latest incoming branch, no matter what params are specified.\nWithout params, the 4th `div.t` which is rendered wrongly in chrome/webkit is:\n\n``` html\n<div class=\"t m0 x3 h4 y4 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0\">Les chercheurs de fossiles<span class=\"ls1 ws1\"> <span class=\"_ _4\"></span>..............................................<span class=\"_ _3\"></span><span class=\"ff4 ls0 ws0\">2</span></span></div>\n```\n\nNote the space at the beginning of the first span, and ws1 is negative.\n\nThe md5sum of the pdf in question is `ba002d9655a9da87a9bdb699a66d4a75`.\n. If we don't style `.t span` as `inline-blobk` in base.css, this bug can be workarounded, and at least this file looks correct.\n\nAs I understand, some spans contains only spaces need to be `inline-blobk`, because their `width` needs to be specified. Spans contains only spaces are already assigned with `inline-blobk` in content css, e.g. \n\n``` css\n._5 {\ndisplay: inline-block;\nwidth: 1.051200px;\n}\n```\n\nSo I think maybe it is safe to not style `.t span` as `inline-blobk`. The workaround `.t:after` may also be removed.\n. Negative margin also works on inline elements, and I didn't found any difference after change them to inline. Are there other browser bugs involved?\n\nI noticed that negative offsets are made `inline` in a rule, althouth it is overriden by the `.t span` rule:\n\n``` css\n._3 {\n    display: inline;\n    margin-left: -5.808px;\n}\n```\n\nWhat is the purpose?\n. @coolwanglu Do you notice that your sample looks different in IE 11, chrome and firefox? Currently I don't know which one is correct, but it seems `inline-block` is an area full of browsers' bugs, so we'd better use it sparsely. I suggest only use `inline-block` for positive offsets and white spaces with positive width.\n. Use `inline` for `.t span` by default, and `inline-block` for `._N` with positive `width` only.\nThis (inline-block removed) looks the same in all browsers:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/v19q42nh/3/\n. It seems browsers disagree with how should [shrink-to-fit](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-box/#shrink-to-fit) work with negative margins, because the spec is unclear. This affects the width calculation of not only `inline-block`, but also `float` and `position:absolute` elements. See http://jsfiddle.net/et37getw/2/.\n\nHowever, this is a little off-topic.\n. @davidhedley For this issue, the solution could be more simpler, as I said above: avoid unnecessary `inline-block`, just use `inline` where possible. However I just have no time to do this.\n\nChromium has admitted the word-spacing bug, so I think it won't take too long to be fixed.\n. Is this issue specific to mobile safari and not to desktop safari? Which version of webkit does your mobile safari use? I don't have mobile safari to test, but epiphany 3.10.3 which uses webkit 538.15 renders `MobileSafariSpacing.pdf` perfectly. The params I used are `--font-size-multiplier 10 --proof 2` or `--optimize-text 1 --space-as-offset 1 --font-size-multiplier 10 --proof 2`. Probably this was bug in webkit that has been fixed.\n\n`--optimize-text 1 --space-as-offset 1` can merge continious spaces, can this make mobile safari work? \n\nP.S.  I don't think Chrome/Firefox etc collapse spaces because we set `white-space: pre` on `.t`.\n. `--space-as-offset 1` replaces spaces by \"offsets\"(`<span>`s with widths/margins), while  `--optimize-text 1` converts offsets between words to spaces where possible, so the combined effect is merging continious spaces. The downside of `--space-as-offset 1` is that it drops spaces.\n\nIt seems your Mobile Safari use a very new webkit, so it may be a regression. I think it is likely a webkit bug, though it is also possible due to apple's private changes to webkit. Maybe it is better to report the bug to apple with a minimum test case.\n. I'm also using ubuntu 14.04 and have no problem building fontforge. \nI built it like this:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/coolwanglu/fontforge.git fontforge.git\ncd fontforge.git\ngit checkout pdf2htmlEX\n\nsudo apt-get install -qq autotools-dev libjpeg-dev libtiff4-dev libpng12-dev libgif-dev libxt-dev autoconf automake libtool bzip2 libxml2-dev libuninameslist-dev libspiro-dev python-dev libpango1.0-dev libcairo2-dev chrpath uuid-dev uthash-dev\n\n./autogen.sh\n\n./configure --enable-debug\nmake V=1\nsudo make install\nfontforge -version\n\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib\nexport LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib\n```\n\nDid the error only occur when building pdf2htmlEX branch? How about master branch?\n. gcc 4.8.2 should be new enough. Just a guess, do you have other C/C++ compilers installed? Try `c++ -v` and `cc -v`. See also #144 .\n. This is a same issue as #416.\nHowever I'm suprised that old chromium had worked.\n. Text selection issue in your file is not related to `--correct-text-visibility`, it also occurs without any params.\n\nThe problem is: there is a `div.c` near the end of the first page of the generated html, which covers the whole page, so that makes almost all texts unselectable -- except itself.\n\nA `div.c` coresponds to a clip path in PDF file and uses `overflow:hidden` to achieve  a clipping effect. Unfortunately, it has the side effect of blocking user interactions (including seletion) with elements below a `div.c`.\n\nIn fact, `--correct-text-visibility` already handles clipping quite well, and should not have such side effect. So can we suppress `div.c` when `--correct-text-visibility` is on? Can we use CSS clipping when `--correct-text-visibility` is off? Or just get rid of  `div.c` completely?\n\n@cdeblois, your issue title and content seem not quite accurate, can you modify it?\n. Yes, that's ok.\n. @cdeblois I think it isn't a trival task to fix this in pdf2htmlEX and may take time.\nIf you can afford modifying the output html by hand, you can locate the problematic `div.c` and assign `z-index: -1` style to it. However sometimes this can make stacking order of texts incorrect.\n. `div.c` means `div` elements that have class `c` -- in pdf2htmlEX generated html, class `c` means \"clip\". \nYes, this issue depends on how a PDF using clips. You can use devtools in browers (ususlly `F12` key) to locate the problematic `div.c`, and modify it by a text editor.\n\nIntroduction to devtools in browers:\nhttp://www.labnol.org/software/chrome-dev-tools-tutorial/28131/\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector\n. No, don't remove `div.c`(or some texts will be removed also), you should add an attribute `style=\"z-index:-1\"` to it. If you are not familiar with html & css and don't understand what I say, you have to wait until this issue get fixed -- however there is no schedule, sorry. \n. It seems you need to add a rule `.pc { z-index: 0; }` to make the `z-index: -1` trick work in chrome. The complete rules could be:\n\n``` css\n.c { z-index: -1; }\n.bf { z-index: -1; } /* bring background image below .c */\n.pc { z-index: 0; } /* ensure a new stacking context on chrome*/\n```\n\nRemoving class `c` is more problematic, because its children are positioned relative to it, and clipped by it.\n\nThose questions were asked to other developers of pdf2htmlEX.\n. Add all the 3 rules to the CSS. It works in firefox and chrome for me. What browsers did you test?\n\nOh, probably you are using png/jpg background image (I was using svg), In this case `.bf` becomes `.bi`, so the rules to be added are:\n\n``` css\n.c, .bf, .bi { z-index: -1; }\n.pc { z-index: 0; }\n```\n. This CSS trick should be considered as a hack, not a universal solution. If there are multiple `.c` elements in a page and are overlapping each other, some of the texts will still be unselectable. Additionally the z-order of texts is altered, sometimes may result in undesired appearance.\n\nSo I'd like to keep this bug open.\n. Where is your fontforge installed? See `which fontforge` and `which fontforge` --version.\nAlso, commit `a0126eda4d27b83da27b63fc90bb4dfcb5a9fff3` is not in `pdf2htmlEX` branch of fontforge and won't work. See also #420 .\n. Comile & install fontforge to `/usr/local` should be OK. Ubuntu may install an old fontforge deb to `/usr`, and pdf2htmlEX should pick up the former.\n\nI built fontforge like this:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/coolwanglu/fontforge.git fontforge.git\ncd fontforge.git\ngit checkout pdf2htmlEX\n\nsudo apt-get install -qq autotools-dev libjpeg-dev libtiff4-dev libpng12-dev libgif-dev libxt-dev autoconf automake libtool bzip2 libxml2-dev libuninameslist-dev libspiro-dev python-dev libpango1.0-dev libcairo2-dev chrpath uuid-dev uthash-dev\n\n./autogen.sh\n\n./configure --enable-debug\nmake V=1\nsudo make install\n```\n\nI also set\n\n```\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib\nexport LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib\n```\n\nIn my `~/.profile`.\n\nThe PPA version of pdf2htmlEX is a little old.\n. Specify higher `--hdpi` and `--vdpi` should help.\n. Can you provide the sample PDF? I tested a  `<img style=\"width:0.5px; height:50px\"/>` in firefox and chrome, it is visible at 150%+ zooming level in firefox and visible at 90%+ zooming level in chrome, so chrome is better with my test case.\n\nAnyway, I think this is a valid issue, because too small background image can not be reliablely rendered. I suggest reopen this issue and provide more descriptive title and content.\n. Interesting. \n\nMy test show that `pdftocairo` works a little better than `pdftoppm` (without other parameters), but can still lose thin lines in your PDF. \n\nActually `pdftoppm` has an option `-thinlinemode`, values can be `none | solid | shape`, and `solid` is exactly what your patch is trying to do. `shape` seems utilize gray level to represent lines thinner than 1px. However, `none` is the default which can lose thin lines. Maybe we want to expose this option to pdf2htmlEX users. @davidhedley, would you like to do this?\n\nCairo backend has been already used by pdf2htmlEX for SVG background output, so I think it is not hard to do (1). However, `pdftocairo` don't have `-thinlinemode` or something similar, so `pdftoppm` and splash back end still looks superior as far as bitmap output is concerned.\n. I'm OK to have `-thinlinemode shape` by default, but others may prefer `solid`. I don't know why does `pdftoppm` let `none` be the default, maybe it is faster?\n\nMy popper is 0.26.1, seems a little outdated.\n. According to the PDF spec:\n\n10.6.4 Scan Conversion Rules\n...\nA shape shall be scan-converted by painting any pixel whose square region intersects the shape, no matter\nhow small the intersection is. This ensures that no shape ever disappears as a result of unfavourable\nplacement relative to the device pixel grid, as might happen with other possible scan conversion rules. The\narea covered by painted pixels shall always be at least as large as the area of the original shape. This rule\napplies both to fill operations and to strokes with nonzero width. Zero-width strokes may be done in an\nimplementation-defined manner that may include fewer pixels than the rule implies.\n...\n\nIt seems the spec doesn't allow any shape being dropped, no matter whether \"Stroke Adjustment\" is on. So it is still a bug of splash back end.\n. Maybe you want to try `--bg-format svg` and `--svg-embed-bitmap 0`.\n. It seems an old windows build without SVG support.\nYou can try newer versions (https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Download), or build from source by yourself.\n. Is it crash for other PDFs? Try some more PDFs and open new issue(s) for those files cause crash, and provide those files .\n\nHowever I don't have a windows build environment so may not be able to reproduce your problem.\nIf you can play with linux it is better to build from lastest source to figure out the problem (https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Troubleshooting-Crashes).\n. If it crash for every PDF, maybe that windows build itself is broken. I'll try it myself.\n. The windows build of 0.12 also crash any PDF on my ubuntu under wine, so it may be broken. I suggest you try the linux or mac version, or contact the author(rubypdf@gmail.com) of windows build.\n. I think these patches are OK. However I still suggest implementing `--svg-image-count-limit` in `setMimeData()` because it is more elegant and efficient.\n. I think it is OK now.\nP.S. Poppler/cario also only generates one `<image>` elements in the output SVG for an image stream used in a PDF page; if the image stream is drawn multiple times, it generates multiple `<use>` elements. So your previous implementation (count `<image>`) was almost equvalent to the current one. If you want to count image drawing times, do it in `drawImage()` etc.\n. The text drawing code in PDF is `[(\\033\\036\\036\\023.\\020\\r \\023\\007)10.479(\\013\\024\\026\"\\007)]TJ`, corresponding to \"Effective From\". The 8th char(after `\\r`) in PDF is a space, but it is mapped to 'v' in the font's encoding. So when `--space-as-offset` is on, the space is converted to a offset, not 'v'.\n\nAccording to [the comment in pdf2htmlEX code](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/blob/67dac7d9934c8092a1698347073ca2045d16c747/src/HTMLRenderer/text.cc#L88-L100), this is a known limitation.\n\n@coolwanglu can we make `--space-as-offset` more restricted? E.g. change [text.cc:102](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/blob/67dac7d9934c8092a1698347073ca2045d16c747/src/HTMLRenderer/text.cc#L102) from `if(is_space && (param.space_as_offset))` to \n`if(is_space && (param.space_as_offset)  && (uLen == 1) && (u[0] == ' '))`. This seems to bring the 'v' back.\n. I tried to fix this in #446, @davidhedley can you test the patch with your PDFs?\n. If ToUnicode is missing, can we just ignore `--space-as-offset 1` for that font automaticly? We can also add `--space-as-offset 2` to force it on even if ToUnicode is missing. However it seems impossible to detect whether ToUnicode or font encoding is corrupted.\n. For non-graphic-rich PDFs, the performance hit of `--correct-text-visibility` is neglectable, e.g. a 141-page middle school IT textbook, 37.535s(user time) with it and 37.861s without it. For graphic-rich PDFs, the performance hit is noticable, e.g. a 108-page middle school geography textbook, 1m56.841s with it and 1m34.782s without it. That is, increased 0.2s/page.\n\nSo I'm not very concerned about the performance currently, and would rather try to deal with the non-rectanglar path problem such as #405. An initial idea is: convert paths that are filled/stroked to clips in a hidden canvas, and test whether chars are in those clips. This would require more CPU power and need more optimization.\n. I have network problem to access your pdf. Can you create an issue [here](https://bitbucket.org/duanyao/pdf2htmlex/issues?status=new&status=open) and attach your pdf? And then link that issue with this one in two directions :)\n\n@coolwanglu In order to overcome the limitation of github's issue tracker, I created that repo on bitbucket as a supplementary issue tracker, because it accept arbitrary type of attachments. Anonymous users can also create issues there.\n. This pdf file has an issue: it maps ASCII space (32) to an arabic character, so if `--space-as-offset` is on, this character is replaced by a offset, which is invisible. The converted unicodes are wrong, so pdf2htmlEX has no way to tell this space is a real space or not.\n\nSo I think this bug won't be fixed, and you have to avoid  `--space-as-offset` on these files.\n\nP.S. this pdf can be obtained from [bitbucket issue tracker](https://bitbucket.org/duanyao/pdf2htmlex/issue/3/charaters-lost-in-space-as-offset).\n. Yeah, it is OK to me.\n. These bitmap is embeded in the svg via data: url, while the svg is refed by the html via `<img>`.\nIn this case, webkit doesn't show the bitmap, while Chrome (uses blink, a fork of webkit) works fine.\n\nThis is obviously a bug of webkit (https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99677). Because a fix is in progress in webkit, I think there is no need to add `--svg-use-object-tag`.\n\nAs a workaround, you can try `--svg-embed-bitmap 0`, and you must make sure the bitmaps in your pdfs are in jpeg format and in RGB or Gray colorspace.\n. > there is no way I can make sure that bitmaps used in pdfs are in jpeg format.\n\nYou can use Ghostscript or Adobe Acrobat to convert all bitmaps in pdfs to jpeg. Actually our team do this.\n\n`<object>` or `<embed>` are more expensive than `<img>`, because browsers create nested browsing contexts for them, so we use `<img>` where possible.\n. > how does it behave in case of transparent images etc\n\nConverted to soft marked images.\n\n> i had to embed svg, as single file \n\nI see, in this case `<object>` or `<embed>` must be used. Do your pdfs contain many drawings? If not, png background can also be used.\n. Because https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99677 has been fixed for a while, close this bug.\n. The problem in the first file (http://djvs.co/Untitleddocument.pdf) is caused by zero width space.\n\nThe PDF contains zero width space character (U+200B). This char by definition has zero width, but according to the font dictionary and embeded font file, its width is not zero, but 1 (means same as font size). This is not a problem in PDF, because PDF just treats zero width space as a normal char, i.e. respects the char width defined in the font dictionary or the font file.\n\nBut it seems that browsers _always_ display U+200B as zero width, no matter what width is defined in the font file. So in the output html file, characters after U+200B are shifted to left in comparison with the PDF.\nI don't know whether this behavior is defined by any web standards, it seems that [CSS Fonts spec](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-fonts/) says nothing about this.\n\nOne possible solution is, in `HTMLRenderer::drawString()`, append a offset of the width reported by `GfxFont::getNextChar` if we meet U+200B. However, if the font in pdf maps U+200B to a visible glyph, we still loose it after conversion.\n. @coolwanglu it seems not enough to just add ZWSP, it is a long list, see #488.\n. It is still unforturnate that all white spaces in this PDF becomes weird private unicodes after conversion. I think maybe we can improve this by checking the glyph before mapping a invalid char: if its glyph does not exist or is empty, map the char to a space, otherwise map it to a private unicode.\n. I think this is not a problem, the mapped spaces also have widths assigned, and CSS `word-spacing`s are calculated based on those widths.\n. Both normal spaces and zero-width spaces are mapped to normal spaces, if they all have no glyph. Note that in PDF, zero-width spaces are not neccessarily \"zero-width\", so it is reasonable to convert them to spaces.\n. Then some of the spaces will be wrapped in spans, with width assigned.\n. @hermesramos can you upload your pdf here so I can have a look?\nhttps://bitbucket.org/duanyao/pdf2htmlex/issues\n\nBecause many foreign web storage services are not usable in China.\n. @hermesramos you uploaded a html file.\n. I can convert the file perfectly with pdf2htmlEX, version 568dc8e65029097cae1aef84d902f5e1c311c35b of incoming branch.\n\nfontforge 's git version is 5f85fd7be65a0a198cd97376e79136e6482deb57\n\npoppler version is bc8076d8f638ccb44f8e3b94aaae96850b025deb\n. What browser you used? I've expericenced that firefox sometimes fails to load web fonts, restart firefox or rename the html file may help. If the problem persists, please upload the converted html.\n. Please upload to bitbucket.\n. Some fonts in the converted html are weired, some glyphs are stretched about 1 time taller. If your fontforge has same version as mine, I would guess some dependencies of fontforge caused the problem. Can you post the result of `configure` when you built your fontforge? \n. Some stretched fonts (JAGEOG+Arial-BoldItalicMT, JAGEOF+Arial-ItalicMT) in hermesramos's output have em size 1000 but same fonts in my output have em size 2048. @coolwanglu Do you have any idea why the em sizes differs?\n. @coolwanglu Yes, looks very much like #87 .\n\n@hermesramos Your fontforge has less optional libraries than mine.\nYours:\n\n```\n  cairo         check   yes http://www.cairographics.org/\n  giflib        check   no  http://giflib.sourceforge.net/\n  libjpeg       check   no  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libjpeg\n  libpng        check   yes http://www.libpng.org/\n  libreadline       check   no  http://www.gnu.org/software/readline\n  libspiro      check   no  https://github.com/fontforge/libspiro\n  libtiff       check   no  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libtiff\n  libuninameslist   check   no  https://github.com/fontforge/libuninameslist\n  zeromq (libzmq)       no  http://www.zeromq.org/\n  X Window System       yes\n```\n\nMine:\n\n```\n  cairo         check   yes http://www.cairographics.org/\n  giflib        check   yes http://giflib.sourceforge.net/\n  libjpeg       check   yes http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libjpeg\n  libpng        check   yes http://www.libpng.org/\n  libreadline       check   yes http://www.gnu.org/software/readline\n  libspiro      check   yes https://github.com/fontforge/libspiro\n  libtiff       check   yes http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libtiff\n  libuninameslist   check   yes https://github.com/fontforge/libuninameslist\n  zeromq (libzmq)       no  http://www.zeromq.org/\n  X Window System       yes\n```\n\nI built it like this:\n\n```\nsudo apt-get install autotools-dev libjpeg-dev libtiff4-dev libpng12-dev libgif-dev libxt-dev autoconf automake libtool bzip2 libxml2-dev libuninameslist-dev libspiro-dev python3-dev libpango1.0-dev libcairo2-dev chrpath uuid-dev python-dev\n\n./bootstrap\n./configure --enable-debug\nmake\nsudo make install\n```\n\nBefore you rebuild your fontforge, can you test it as follow?\n1. open your PDF with fontforge (by GUI or command line `fontforge INPDFViewer.pdf`)\n2. select font \"JAGEOG+Arial-BoldItalicMT\"\n3. open menu \"Element->Font Info->General\".\n\nWhat's the \"Em size\"? it should be 2048.\n. So it seems your fontforge can parse the font correctly. Then you can try to convert \"JAGEOG+Arial-BoldItalicMT\" etc. to woff format by fontforge, and check whether the EM sizes are changed or glyphs are stretched. \n\nP.S. Were your VMs created by yourself? how about download a prepared VM image like http://www.osboxes.org/ubuntu/ ?\n. If the problem persists, please upload your VM to MEGA (I can't access google drive or dropbox).\n. Maybe you want to add `append_padding_char()` before `append_offset()` to compensate the char counter.\n. Propbaly we don't have to avoid leading spaces, as chrome issue #404444 can be workarounded in CSS by adding a pseudo element at the beginning of a line. We can also remove `display:inline-block` for normal `<span>`s, to workaround negative word-spacing problem (#416). After this, #414 may be also removed.\n\nI just reinstalled my system, so the following patch hasn't been compiled & tested yet.\n\n```\ndiff --git a/share/base.css.in b/share/base.css.in\nindex a15a23f..3763301 100644\n--- a/share/base.css.in\n+++ b/share/base.css.in\n@@ -161,10 +161,13 @@\n   /* Workaround for https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35443 */\n   content: '';\n }\n+.@CSS_LINE_CN@:before {\n+  /* Workaround blink/webkit bug of word-spacing with leading spaces (https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=404444) */\n+  content: '';\n+  display: inline-block;\n+}\n .@CSS_LINE_CN@ span { /* text blocks within a line */\n   position:relative;\n-  /* _<id> for spaces may need display:inline, which will override this */ \n-  display:inline-block;\n   unicode-bidi:bidi-override; /* For rtl languages, e.g. Hebrew, we don't want the default Unicode behaviour */\n }\n .@CSS_WHITESPACE_CN@ { /* text shift */\ndiff --git a/src/StateManager.h b/src/StateManager.h\nindex a02a673..53493ed 100644\n--- a/src/StateManager.h\n+++ b/src/StateManager.h\n@@ -246,14 +246,14 @@ public:\n     double default_value(void) { return 0; }\n     void dump_value(std::ostream & out, double value) { \n         out << ((value > 0) ? \"display:inline-block;width:\" \n-                            : \"display:inline;margin-left:\")\n+                            : \"margin-left:\")\n             << round(value) << \"px;\";\n     }\n     void dump_print_value(std::ostream & out, double value, double scale) \n     {\n         value *= scale;\n         out << ((value > 0) ? \"display:inline-block;width:\" \n-                            : \"display:inline;margin-left:\")\n+                            : \"margin-left:\")\n             << round(value) << \"pt;\";\n     }\n };\n```\n.

So I keep normal spans inline. \n\n`inline` does has problem in blink/webkit if it is empty and surrounded by spaces, e.g. \n`<div style=\"white-space:pre; word-spacing:1em;\"> Any thing here <span style=\"margin-left:-0.7em;\"></span> span begins with a space.</div>`\nOutput of this file has this problem: \nhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/blob/incoming/test/browser_tests/with_form.pdf\n. You are welcome. Rebased.\n. I can't download your PDF. You can create an issue in https://bitbucket.org/duanyao/pdf2htmlex/issues, upload the file and reference it here.\n. Unfortunately mediafire's \"download\" function seems not accessible from China, although I can see the preview.\n. Can you test it with pdf2htmlEX 0.13.6? The result looks fine to me.\n. What's the version of libfontforge are you using? Try `pkg-config --print-provides libfontforge`.\nMy output is `libfontforge = 2.0.20140101` and the result is OK, however with some different warnings:\n\n```\nToUnicode CMap is not valid and got dropped for font: 7\nToUnicode CMap is not valid and got dropped for font: 8\nToUnicode CMap is not valid and got dropped for font: e\n```\n\nUpdate: it seems pkg-config can't get accurate version libfontforge, use `fontforge --version` instead. I installed it from recent source so the output is:\n\n```\n Based on sources from 23:48 CST 15-Mar-2015-ML-D.\n Based on source from git with hash: 5f85fd7be65a0a198cd97376e79136e6482deb57\n...\nfontforge 23:48 CST 15-Mar-2015\nlibfontforge 20150315\n```\n. It seems this issue is windows browsers specifc -- as indicated by the title. The result html works fine on linux browsers. Unfortunately, I overlooked this strange platform-dependent behavior of browsers.\n\nI tried multiple font formats output for this file, and found that woff and ttf doesn't work on all 3 windows browsers (FF, chrome, IE11); otf works well on FF, largely work on chrome, but not work in IE (permission error).\n\nI also tried 360 browser (http://chrome.360.cn/) which is based on chromium, and found it can render woff, ttf well, and largely otf.\n. > XMLHttpRequest cannot load file:///D:/tmp/pdf2htmlEX-win32-0.13.6/original1.page.

Created an issue for Firefox: [Some woff fonts not rendered on windows, but work well on linux](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1176842).\n. mozilla guys replied:\n\nhttps://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1176842\n\n> Font is a poorly hacked up version of Helvetica Neue Light, taken from an OSX install.\n> \n> Renders fine under OSX or Windows 8/GDI but no glyphs are painted when running under DirectWrite (content can be selected).

Actually this engine don't have to depend on cairo, only depends on poppler and freetype. Detecting empty glyph with freetype seems simple enough and should be much faster than actually drawing chars.\n\n> I feel that this patch adds too many states/variables, making the renderer even more messy. \n\nYeah, I also plan to simplify it a little in following days, especially in `drawSting()`.\n\n> Finally, could you also add a test case for this (maybe after we have no issues left for the code).\n\nThe sample file in #477 was used to test this patch.\n\nUnforturnately I found a problem in browsers, FF and webkit disagree with whether add letter-spacing around ZWSP:\n`<div style=\"font-size:30px;letter-spacing:10px\">M&#x200B;M</div>`\nThis means we can't output ZWSP if letter-spacing is not zero. Can we can just omit ZWSP in this case? it should be rare.\n. OK, I agree.\n. After some thought, I think most (if not all) \"illegal html unicode without glyph\" should be converted to a `<span class=\"_ _N\">&#x20;<span>`, because:\n- Browsers implement `letter-spacing` for ZWSP etc differently (should not apply, [FF and IE have bugs](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=253143) ), while implement `letter-spacing` for `inline-block` consistently (not apply at all). So converting an illegal unicode to a ZWSP + offset pair is not ideal.\n- In order to largely maintain the sematic, most illegal html unicodes should be converted to delimiters (space or something), not just empty spans. P.S. I think if `--space-as-offset` is on, at least one space should also be retained for each converted offset.\n\nIn order to accomplish this, `HTMLTextLine::append_offset(double width)` may be extended to `HTMLTextLine::append_offset(double width, Unicode char)`, means a char (in most cases a space) can be assosiated to the offset. This is called \"mixed offset\"\n\n`HTMLTextLine::text` field can also be extended to type `vector<HTMLTextUnit>`, and `HTMLTextUnit` is defined as:\n\n```\nstruct HTMLTextUnit\n{\n  HTMLTextState * state; // or int state, index of HTMLTextLine::states\n  int char_count; // corresponding to how many CharCode\n  Unicode unicode;\n  float width; // width of offset\n}\n```\n\nType of `HTMLTextUnit` is implied:\n- Normal text: char_count == 1, unicode > 0, width is NaN (means defined by font/state)\n- Pure offset:  char_count == 0, unicode == 0, width != 0\n- Mixed offset: char_count > 0, unicode == 0x20 (may be extended), width is not NaN\n- Repeating spaces: char_count > 1, unicode == 0x20, width is NaN\n- Decomposed ligature\n  - First: same as normal text\n  - Followings: char_count == 0, unicode > 0\n- Not in use: char_count == 0, unicode == 0, width == 0\n\nSome notes:\n- `char_count` can be used to sync with `CovertTextDetector`\n- Pure/mixed offsets may be merged during text optimazition, and `char_count` and `width` are added up. After merging, removed `HTMLTextUnit` can be marked as \"not in use\" (don't have to compact the vector).\n- <del>Large offsets may converted to \"repeating spaces\" during text optimazition</del><ins>no, this will invalidate char_count. Large offsets may be converted to muliple normal text units.</ins>.\n- `HTMLTextLine::offsets` and `HTMLTextLine::decomposed_text` are not needed anymore.\n. `DrawingTracer::update_ctm` traces `OutputDev::updateCTM`, and `OutputDev::updateCTM` provides us with the update to the CTM (which should be muliplied with CTM), not the updated CTM. This behavior seems not stated in poppler's document, but you can see `CairoOutputDev::updateCTM`, it is almost the same as `DrawingTracer::update_ctm`.\n. Some thoughts:\nI think integrating `DrawingTracer` codes into `TextPageBuilder` is feasible, and putting `bbox` into `CharNode` is good.\n\nHowever, I'd prefer one flatten array of `CharNode` for all chars in each page, rather than multi-level indirection (TextPage/TextSegment/TextWord/CharNode), because:\n- Most post processing algorithms (such as text visibility checking, layout analysis) are bottom-up and only care about individual char's properties, so this indirection is not very useful to them.\n- TextSegment/TextWord are built according to certain PDF drawing commands, but in many cases this is sub-optimal so we have `--optimize-text`. I believe an advanced optimization algorithm would unlikely rely on PDF drawing commands, and would rather build a new TextSegment/TextWord tree from bottom up by analyzing the array of `CharNode`.\n\nSo we can do this:\n\n```\nclass CharNode\n{\n  ...\n  TextStyle * style; // or int style_index, or merge TextStyle into CharNode\n}\nclass TextPage\n{\n  vector<CharNode> chars;\n  vector<TextStyle> styles;\n  vector<TextSegment> segments;\n}\n\nTextWord\n{\n  ...\n  int start; // starting index in TextPage::chars\n  int end; // ending index in TextPage::chars\n}\n```\n\nAnother question: what's the advantage of `boost::intrusive::list` over `std:vector` ? Inserting/removing nodes seems rather rare, because during post processings we can (and probably prefer to) just build a new tree and drop the old one. P.S. I don't think \"all hidden characters should be removed from the structure\", because we want to output transparent texts for them (at least for partially visible chars), so setting a flag on invisible `CharNode` should be enough.\n. > For example, if a char is removed (due to hidden by an image, or we decide to covert it to an offset), we need to find the word containing it and modify it accordingly. \n\nHidden char should not be removed, just marking it as \"transparent\" should be OK. Because text style is changed, the TextWord containing the hidden char have to be splitted, this seems complicated.\n\nI'd recommend this workflow to avoid such mess:\n1. Build an array of CharNode as well as an array of TextStyle while drawing a page.\n   -  (Optional)  Run CovertedTextDetector during the drawing, and mark hidden chars in that array. We may push more TextStyles into the TextStyle array and let hidden chars reference them.\n2. Do offset <-> space convertion/merging in the array of CharNode (implement offset as a special CharNode). Push more TextStyles if necessary.\n3. Iterate over the array of CharNode, and group chars in a same line (according to x/y coordinate) and with same TextStyle into TextWords, put those TextWords into an array. Push more TextStyles if necessary.\n4. Iterate over the array of TextWord, and group them into TextSegments, put those TextSegments into an array. Push more TextStyles if necessary.\n5. Travel through the tree, generate HTML/CSS codes.\n6. Draw background image, and draw hidden chars according to the array of CharNodes.\n\nSo we don't have to modify any TextWord/TextSegment/TextStyle but just build them, so iterator invalidation is not an issue.\n\nThis workflow is inspired by [PDFMiner](http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/python/pdfminer/index.html)'s layout analysis algoritm (which I had ported to C++).\n. > some characters are transparent as defined in PDF, and some are hidden due to overlapping. Shall we show both of them in HTML (transparently)?\n\nWe can add a flag to CharNode to distinguish them. However, it is quite hard to tell whether an char covered by an image is meaningless or not. It is also hard to tell whether an char is completely invisible -- what if the covering image is semi-transparent or clipped? So the safest way is to show all covered/clipped chars as transparent.\n. > std::list or intrusive list may be used to solve both problems, I wonder if there are anything we need from vector?\n\nContainers in STL are debugger friendly, I can view them in eclipse CDT or VC++, I'm not sure about boost. I'd also prefer index over iterator, because during debugging I always know the progress of a iteration by check the value of the index.\n\nVector's other advantages are memory alloaction/dellocation speed and less memory fragment, this may be important or not. If the data structure is not quite dynamic, vector is prefered.\n. > if we dump all the chars first, we need to store all the styles for each char, the combine them by comparing the styles again\n\nIf we store a pointer or index to TextStyle in each CharNode, we can compare the pointer/index first, which should be fast. At least CharNodes generated by a single drawString() call share a same TextStyle object. If we merge TextStyle into CharNode, we can also add a flag inicating \"has same style as last char\".\n. > And about inserting offset to connect words, actually it can be done by adding a field space_after in the class TextWord\n\nI think this can also be done by adding all possible offsets in step 1. If we find some offsets that are not needed when building TextWord/TextSegment, just ignore them.\n. I mean we can pre-allocate all possible offsets in step 1, so that don't have to insert offsets when we decide to merge words afterward.\n. When a char is to be appended to the CharNode array, unless we are sure that there is no preceding offset (e.g. \"e\" in \"Hello World\"), we always append an CharNode with \"offset\" type before that char (e.g. \"W\" in \"Hello World\"). If the width of the offset is yet to be determined, we can assgin 0 to it so that in following steps we can calculate the actual width.\n\nThere are quite a few chances that normal chars and offsets are converted to each other or even merged. E.g. illegal chars may be converted to offsets and further merged with surrounding offsets/whitespaces. So I think is would be convenient that both normal chars and offsets are represented by CharNode so the convertion/merging can be done in-place.\n\nAs to styles, I think TextStyle can be made immutable. If we want to change a CharNode's style, we usually push a new TextStyle object into the per-page array of TextStyle, and modify the CharNode's style pointer to point to the new TextStyle. Unused TextStyles are not reclaimed until end of the renderring of the page, but this should not be a big problem.\n. > We may convert chars to offsets, but when shall we covert offsets to chars?\n\nSome PDFs use offsets instead of spaces. We may convert an offset between words to a space (or an offset containing a space).\n\n> By modifying styles, usually I meant re-scaling the matrix as well as the font size, or tweaking the positions, and most of time this happens word-wise.\n\nBecause chars in a word have same style, we can only create a new TextStyle and update all CharNodes in the TextWord at once.\n\nIf the style duplication is really a problem, we can put TextStyle in a set instead of an array.\n\nP.S. is it possible to keep font size constant globally, and only change the matrix? As I suggested in #369 .\n\n> So char->offset means breaking a Word into two, and offset->char means merging two Word's into one.\n\nYou mean offsets can not live in Words? How about kerning?\n\nI think now it is difficult to discuss more details before really implement it, so you may do it in your manner.\n. \u4f60\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u7ed3\u679c\uff08 http://pan.baidu.com/s/1eQdB394 \uff09\u5df2\u7ecf\u5305\u542b\u4e86\u539f pdf \u91cc\u7684\u6587\u672c\u3002\u6211\u731c\u4f60\u7684\u610f\u601d\u662f\u6587\u672c\u65e0\u6cd5\u88ab\u9009\u4e2d\u548c\u590d\u5236\uff1f\u8fd9\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u5927\u672c\u5206\u6587\u672c\u88ab\u4e0a\u5c42\u7684\u94fe\u63a5\uff08`<a>`\uff09\u548c\u88c1\u526a\u533a\uff08`div.c`\uff09\u6321\u4f4f\u4e86\u3002\n\npdf\u7684\u94fe\u63a5\u91cc\u5e76\u4e0d\u5305\u62ec\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u8fd9\u662fpdf\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e5f\u88ab\u5e26\u5230\u4e86\u8f6c\u6362\u540e\u7684html\u4e2d\u3002\u6211\u80fd\u60f3\u5230\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\uff081\uff09\u7528js\u6765\u53d6\u4ee3`<a>`\u7684\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u4ee3\u4ef7\u662f\u5728js\u4e0d\u80fd\u7528\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u94fe\u63a5\u5c31\u5931\u6548\u4e86)\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u628a\u94fe\u63a5\u52a0\u5165\u5230\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6587\u672c\uff08`div.t`\uff09\u5185\u90e8\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e48\u505a\u6bd4\u8f83\u590d\u6742\u3002\n\n\u81f3\u4e8e\u88c1\u526a\u533a\uff08`div.c`\uff09\uff0c\u6211\u5df2\u7ecf\u5728 #423 \u5efa\u8bae\u53d6\u6d88\u3002\n. \u6211\u4e0d\u660e\u767d\u4f60\u7684\u610f\u601d\u3002\u4f60\u662f\u60f3\u8bf4\u8f6c\u6362\u540e\u7684\u6587\u672c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u591f\u597d\uff1f\u5177\u4f53\u662f\u54ea\u91cc\u4e0d\u6ee1\u610f\uff1f\n\u53e6\u5916\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u7f51\u9875\u5feb\u7167\u529f\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u7ecf\u8fc7PDF\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1f\n. \"\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u5e38\u597d\u7684\u6837\u5f0f\"\u2014\u2014\u201c\u597d\u201d\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u542b\u4e49\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u539f\u6765\u7684html\u5417\uff1f\u7531\u4e8ehtml->pdf->html\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u5fc5\u7136\u4f1a\u4e22\u5931\u5f88\u591a\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u662f\u5f88\u96be\u8fd8\u539f\u539f\u6765\u7684html\u7684\u3002\n\n\u4f60\u7684\u7f51\u9875\u5feb\u7167\u7a0b\u5e8f\u9700\u8981\u628a\u7f51\u9875\u5f15\u7528\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5185\u5d4c\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u6709\u4e2a chrome \u6269\u5c55\u5c31\u662f\u505a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\u7684\uff08 https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile \uff09\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e0d\u662f\u547d\u4ee4\u884c\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u5df1\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u3002\n. \u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u90ae\u4ef6\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6216\u8005 webmail \u5bf9 html \u7684\u652f\u6301/\u9650\u5236\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u6240\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6307\u671b\u590d\u6742\u7684 html \u90ae\u4ef6\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u90fd\u6b63\u5e38\u663e\u793a\u6050\u6015\u662f\u6709\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u3002\u6211\u770b\u5230\u4f60\u7684\u622a\u56fe\u4e2d pdf2htmlEX \u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u5728email\u4e2d\u4e5f\u6709\u5f88\u591a\u663e\u793a\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u4f60\u8bf4\u201c\u6548\u679c\u5f88\u597d\u201d\u5462\uff1f\n\n\u201c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u90ae\u4ef6\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u201d\u6050\u6015\u5df2\u7ecf\u8d85\u51fa\u4e86 pdf2htmlEX \u548c singleFile \u7684\u76ee\u6807\u8303\u56f4\u4e86\u3002\u6211\u8ba4\u4e3a\u53d8\u901a\u7684\u529e\u6cd5\u662f\uff1a\u628a\u4f60\u7684\u7f51\u9875\u5feb\u7167\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9644\u4ef6\u53d1\u9001\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u53d1\u9001\u5230\u7f51\u9875\u5feb\u7167\u7684\u94fe\u63a5\uff0c\u8ba9\u7528\u6237\u7528\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u6253\u5f00\u7f51\u9875\u5feb\u7167\u3002\n. Seems you are using an old version. Latest codes in incoming branch converts your file correctly.\n. Try `--optimize-text 1`, this option is supposed to convert offsets to `letter-spacing/word-spacing`.\n. We can adapt the text output codes in pdf2htmlEX to generate SVG `<text>/<tspan>` instead of `<div>/<span>`, this just requires modest effort. However, the benefit is also small, because a background image is still required (the output becomes SVG text layer + background image).\n\nIn order to output high quality HTML or SVG, we need to handle 3 things: texts/fonts, vector graphics, and bitmaps.\n- poppler + cairo (CairoOutputDev) is good at handling vector graphics and bitmaps, but handle texts badly (convert texts to graphics in output SVG).\n- pdf2htmlEX itself is good at handling texts/fonts, but lacks the ability to handle vector graphics and bitmaps (delegate them to poppler and cairo). This is the main reason why a output page is composed by a text layer and a background image.\n\nSo the situation is: In order to output high quality SVG without text/background separation, pdf2htmlEX needs to gain the ability to handle vector graphics and bitmaps, or cairo needs to gain the ability to handle texts/fonts.\n\nJust a thought: maybe it is better to fork `cairo_svg_surface` codes, and merge pdf2htmlEX's text/font handling code into it. As long as the public API of our forked `cairo_svg_surface` keeps unchanged, we don't have to touch `CairoOutputDev`'s code.\n\nHowever, pure SVG solution also has it drawback: resource consumption of browsers to render the output SVGs is not always bouded -- it can be very high for complicated PDF pages. This is why `--svg-node-count-limit` exists. I think it is still worth to keep a ablility to fallback to (SVG) text layer + bitmap background.\n. @hojuruku Thanks for metioning https://github.com/pramodhkp/pdf2svg . I didn't notice that PDF.js had been able to convert PDF to SVG, and the output looks promising. Sometimes I find that PDF.js renders PDFs more correctly than poppler + cario does.\n. That means we want to handle bitmaps ourselves (not by SplashOutputDev/CairoOutputDev)? If so, I'd suggest output SVG insead of HTML, it is actually simpler: `font-size-multiplier` will be unnecessary, and paths, clips, text strokes and masked images can be mapped directly to SVG counterparts. Thus, both SplashOutputDev/CairoOutputDev are not needed in most cases.\n\nIf the output SVG is too complex, we would still need SplashOutputDev, and delegate vector graphics to it. In this case, we need to correct the visibility of texts and bitmaps remained in the SVG layer like what we currently do.\n\nSo maybe we don't need CairoOutputDev anymore :).\n. So maybe doing all the SVG output ourselves is a more clean approch.\n. `--hdpi` and `--vdpi` affect size of jpg/png background images. You can also try `--bg-format svg --svg-embed-bitmap 0` to dump raw images in the PDF, this usually generate smaller output. See the man page for more info.\n. I'm not sure the rationale why `--zoom` doesn't affect sizes of background images, maybe @coolwanglu can answer you. Maybe some users want high resolution background images for mobile/pad because these devices usually have high resolution screens.\n. I know very little about SEO. Do you think it will be helpful to just change `<div>` used by pdf2htmlEX to more semantic `<hN>` and `<p>`?\n. pdf2htmlEX should be able to convert links in PDF to HTML links;. If not, you can file an issue.\n\nPDFs are not supported by all browsers natively (maybe never will), so if you want your PDFs to be reliably accessible on the web, converting to HTML is a good idea. \n\nIf you want to add more dynamic contents, you can always edit the converted HTML/JS.\n. I'm afraid I don't have necessary environment to do trial and error on SEO. If you can figure out why the output of pdf2htmlEX is not searchable by google, maybe I can improve it.\n. @KrishnaPG Thanks for the detailed suggestion!\n\nHowever, I would be suprised if search engines couldn't handle noise of span tags -- just removing these tags while keeping text nodes should produce correct text. Do you have any references on this?\n\nUsing `<hN>` and `<p>` instead of `<div>` and adding `<title>` are doable, however I'm not sure how to test the effect. If anyone can test, I suggest manually editing (or scripting if you can) the output of pdf2htmlEx and see what will happen.\n. @fmalina Interesting, thanks!\n@GarrettHartley can you try https://github.com/fmalina/transcript and see whether it makes difference?\n. It seems you are using an old version. Recent versions in incoming branch doesn't crash with your file. Also remember to update fontforge & poppler.\n. The latest release version is 0.13.6. Maybe you have to build from the source yourself.\n. Just FYI, there is a pending PR for Homebrew to update poppler and its dependencies (including pdf2htmlEX): \nhttps://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/pull/37280\n\nHowever I don't have a mac to test it.\n. You have to rebuild pdf2htmlEX after you installed a new version of libfontforge. Or wait for a new binary release of pdf2htmlEX.\n. Ideally a browser should never crash no matter what you feed to it; if it does, it is a bug of the browser. However, in practice complicated pages can cause a browser to run out of memory, and get killed. I don't think `--split-pages` should result in more memory usage. can you monitor the memory usage of your browsers?\n\n`-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch` uses more memory, and seems did cause crashes:\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/12665641/ios-browser-crashing-when-using-webkit-overflow-scrolling-touch\n. `-f N -l N` options can generate a standalone HTML for page N of a PDF.\n\nYou can also add necessary header/footer to each .page files generated by `--split-pages` yourself to make them complete HTML files.\n. I believe .page files should contain links.\n. Those links need some transform, because they are pointing to the ids of other pages, and they should point to the file names of other pages in your case. You can write a post-processing program to add header/footer to each .page files and transform links in them.\n\nP.S. What's the benefit of separated HTML file for each page over each .page files for each page?\n. As the error message said, see `config.log' for more details.\n\nIf the error is only a fontforge error, maybe it is better to ask at https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge .\n. Run `pkg-config --print-provides --cflags --libs poppler` to check whether poppler is installed.\n\nRun `make clean` and `make SHELL=\"/bin/bash -x\"` in pdf2htmlEX source dir to check the compiler command actually used.\n. It seems a problem of cmake, although I don't know why. Try to remove cmake's temp files listed in `.gitignore`, and re-run cmake. If the problem persists, check `cmake.log` file in the source dir.\n\nTo change installation dir, try adding `-DDESTINATION=<dir>` when running cmake (haven't tried myself). If you don't want to install at all, you can specify `--data-dir <sourcedir>/share` when runing pdf2htmlEX.\n. Did you find the root cause of the failing build previously?\n\nBy the way, you don't have to run `sudo make install` after a compilation if you haven't modified files under `./share` dir.\n. > So our question is, is there a way to figure out from the font embedded if the text associated with the font is bolded or not.\n\nThis can not be done reliably, because in PDF files, texts don't have properties like \"bold\" or \"italic\", instead it relies on bold/italic fonts. So best thing you can do is check whether there are strings \"bold\" or \"italic\" in a font name (open the dumped font files by fontforge).\n\nThere is also no concept \"underline\" in PDF, it is just a independent line. So there is also no underlined text in pdf2htmlEX-genrated html.\n. Use `--embed-font 0` to dump font files, or font files are embedded in the HTML file. See the wiki for more info (e.g. https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Quick-Start).\n\nOpen the font files by fontforge, open menu \"element->font info->PS name\", you will see the font name.\n. This is a bug of chrome/webkit, and has been workarounded by https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/pull/484/ . You need to update to the leatest release.\n. Try `--correct-text-visibility 1`, and read man for more info.\n. What do you mean by \"images\"? If you are referring to background images, use `--vdpi` and `--hdpi`.\n. PDFs usually don't have any information about tables (tables are just represented as texts and lines) ( [read this article for more info](https://blog.idrsolutions.com/2009/04/pdf-text/)), so there is nothing pdf2htmlEX can do. HTML class 'c' denotes 'clip' in pdf2htmlEX, which has nothing to do with tables.\n\nIf you want to recognize tables in PDFs, you'll need some [layout analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_layout_analysis) tools.\n. Are you using svg background?\n. What does \"screenshot image\" mean? For background images, use `--hdpi` and `-vdpi`.\n. Thanks for investigate this issue. Can you create a pull request for this change?\nAlso could you add some instructions on building for windows in the wiki page? I have little experience on it.\nhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Building\n. Can't reproduce. JS should have no effect on font in pdf2htmlEX.\nWhat browsers you tested with? How did you disable JS? \n. NoScript also block web fonts by default, and this is configurable (options->embeddings-Forbid @font-face).\n. Is this issue specific to Safari browser on MacOS? How other browsers on MacOS behave? Looks like a safari bug.\n. @josiasmontag Maybe you want to report this issue to Apple or try [webcompat](https://webcompat.com/).\n. I don't know why this is happening. However this problem only happens when the cursor is between two lines, not when the cursor is on a line, so you can still select text of multiple lines.\n. It seems this test file doesn't suffer from this issue:\nhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/tree/master/test/browser_tests/geneve_1564\n\nHowever I had a hard time to figure out the difference. Do you have any idea?\n. With SVG background image and `--svg-embed-bitmap 0` you can save images individually (only RGB or Gray JPEG bitmaps in PDF are supported now). But you need to animate the images in the SVG files, not in the HTML.\n. Build the recent source, and SVG should be enabled by default.\nhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Building\n. Feel free to comment if you have other problem.\n. Duplicated background images should be not very common -- though it is a waste when it does occur.\nI suggest you try `--bg-format svg --svg-embed-bitmap 0` and see if there are still duplicated images.\n\nIt should be not hard to de-duplicate background images in pdf2htmlEx itself. It may compute checksum of each generated background images and check if there is a duplicated one. Would you like to implement this feature?\n. Is a partially processed PDF useful for your user? If what you want is just a output size limit, I suggest \n1. Let pdf2htmlEx convert the entire PDF, make sure there is adequate disk space.\n2. Messure the size of the output, if too large, remove it and report error to the user.\n\nP.S. if the the output of pdf2htmlEx is much more large than the PDF file, it may be a bug. You may also try to [optimize the PDF](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Optimizing-PDF-Files) before feed it to pdf2htmlEx.\n. FYI https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/issues/148#issuecomment-166507332\n. I believe removing margins of background images reduces memory consumption of browsers. Why the margins are important to you?\n. If all you want is converting PDF to full page images, maybe poppler's [`pdftocairo`](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man1/pdftocairo.1.html) or pdfbox's [`PDFToImage`](https://pdfbox.apache.org/1.8/commandline.html) do a better job.\n. Can you attach the PDF directly in this issue?\n. What purpose do you want to achieve? Small images are not always less important than big images. In fact in some PDFs a big \"image\" may be actually a tiled one by many small images.\n. Run the follow commands to check the installation of poppler:\n\n```\nldd /usr/local/bin/pdf2htmlEX | grep poppler\nfind /usr/local/lib -name \"libpoppler.so*\"\n```\n. Thanks for reporting!\nI'm the author of `--correct-text-visibility`. Can you describ how those documents were broken? Charaters that should be visible are removed, or those should be invisible are shown?\nAre the clip areas' dimentions are similar or smaller than the charaters' in question? As I noted in the code, \"even if 4 corners of the char are all in or all out of the clip area, it could still be partially clipped\", I suspected this is the problem.\n. A single-page sample should be useful! You can also remove sensitive contents by some PDF edting tools like acrobat.\n. Maybe related: #520 . As indicated in that issue, you may want to turn off `--split-pages` for SEO.\n\nUnfortunately we have very little info on SEO currently.\n. Most PDF files don't have semantic information (except [Tagged PDF](http://blogs.adobe.com/acrolaw/2006/01/understanding_t_1/)), so it is challenging for pdf2htmlEX (and any pdf converter) to produce semantic output.\n\nWhat you need seems a [layout analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_layout_analysis) tool, and [pdfminer](https://github.com/euske/pdfminer) has [one for pdf](https://euske.github.io/pdfminer/#pdf2txt).\n\nOf cause it would be nice to incorperate some sort of layout analysis feature like pdfminer into pdf2htmlEX, so we could have both semantic and high fidelity output, however it may turn out complicated to do.\n. `--space-as-offset 1 --optimize-text 1` may help.\n. Please attach the pdf directly, thanks!\n. Converting output of pdf2htmlex to epub3 is definitely doable (we did that actually). Of cause you have to do some programing to generate the navigation document and the OPF.\n\nWhat epub readers are you targeting? I believe most epub3 readers are based on morden browser engines, and SVG produced by pdf2htmlex (via cario) should be viewable in browsers. Morden browsers support a mixture of SVG 1.1 and SVG 1.2 tiny, by the way.\n\nI think `unicode-bidi:bidi-override` is related to right-to-left scripts (see #595). Why it must be removed?\n. It seems the latest [EPUB3 spec](http://www.idpf.org/epub/301/spec/epub-contentdocs.html#sec-css-2.1) still forbids `unicode-bidi`. However if major epub3 readers accept `unicode-bidi`, I think it is not a big problem to violate the spec. If you must have the generated EPUB to pass a validator, you may dynamicly insert the `unicode-bidi` rule via JS.\n. @anteprandium I did convert output of pdf2htmlex to epub3, however it is not [fixed layout epub3](http://www.idpf.org/epub/31/spec/epub-contentdocs.html#sec-fixed-layouts). In my opionin, fixed layout epub3 is poor in page transition performance because each page is a xhtml file, and can not be easily viewed in browsers. Instead, I put all pages into one xhtml file and implemented custom page transition and fullscreen in JS, so these features are independent to epub readers and can be viewed directly in browsers.\n\nThe converting tool I wrote is JS code running in browser. It parses the output xhtml of pdf2htmlex, and generates OPF, navigation and content files, and packages them into epub using [zip.js](https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/zip.js). The output files of pdf2htmlex is also packaged as zip before converting. This tool is part of a commercial software and is not publicly available yet, sorry. If you don't have special requirements, maybe using [sigil](https://sigil-ebook.com/) to import the output of pdf2htmlEX is easier, as mentioned by the original post.\n\nThe params of pdf2htmlEX I used looks like (hope helpful):\n\n```\n#!/bin/sh\npdf2htmlEX --fit-width 800 --hdpi 200 --vdpi 200 --font-size-multiplier 10 --heps 0.5 --veps 0.5 --css-filename content.css --embed cfijO --bg-format svg --svg-node-count-limit 1000 --svg-embed-bitmap 0 --correct-text-visibility 1 --dest-dir $1.sout $1 content.xhtml\n```\n. A PDF file can't be read sequentially, and the output of pdf2htmlEX is not always a single file.\n. Buffering the entire PDF consumes more memory than necessary. What problem are you trying to solve?\n. No, pdf2htmlEX loads and processes one page of PDF one time, so the memory reqiurement for processing PDF is constant, not proportional to page numbers.\n\nHow do you generate your PDF files? PDF format is not designed for streaming, so you have to wait until a entire PDF is generated to start pdf -> html conversion.\n\nFor output streaming, I think you may use [tmpfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmpfs) to avoid creating physical files and use node.js [`fs.watch()`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_watch_filename_options_listener) to monitor the output file. I think you want the output to be a file rather than a stream, because the network connection may break in the middle and users want to retry in this case.\n\nHowever, currently pdf2htmlEX is not quite suitable for streaming-while-converting, because the html and css are generated after all pages of PDF are processed, and changing this is non-trivial (but possible).\n. Yeah, I am aware of the limitation of `--svg-node-count-limit` and `--force-png-background` can be a rescue. But I can't promise to implement this feature any time soon. Patch is welcome!\n\nP.S. pdf2htmlEX use poppler's cairo backend to produces SVG, so if the SVG background looks wrong, you can try poppler's `pdf2cairo -svg` tool to reproduce the problem and report it at https://bugs.freedesktop.org/ (under product poppler or cairo).\n. Please attach the PDF directly.\n\nThis may be due to that those characters' bounding boxes overlap slightly, so `--correct-text-visibility` thinks them should be renderred as image to achieve correct visibility. Maybe I should consider slightly overlapping characters not overlapping. However, this won't solve all bluring problems.\n\n`--bg-format svg` should avoid the text bluring problems, however the renderring difference between html and svg is usually still noticable.\n. \u8bf7\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u95ee\u9898\u7684PDF\u6587\u4ef6\u3002\n. \u4e71\u7801\u548c\u56fe\u7247\u4e0d\u663e\u793a\u4f3c\u4e4e\u662f\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bf7\u5206\u522b\u521b\u5efabug\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u5e76\u9644\u4e0a\u6709\u95ee\u9898\u7684PDF\u6587\u4ef6\u3002\n. `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .` to enable debug build.\n. Does this happen to all PDF files you tried or a perticular PDF file?\n. See if this helps: https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Troubleshooting-Crashes\n. That's because we must handle closed sub path in which case we loop back to the first point.\nThe actual index `j` should never reach `n`:\n\nhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/blob/master/src/DrawingTracer.cc#L246\n\n``` C++\n            if (p == n)\n            {\n                if (subpath->isClosed())\n                    j = 0; // if sub path is closed, go back to starting point\n                else\n                    break;\n            }\n            else\n                  j = p;\n```\n\nDo you have a test case to reproduce the issue?\n. Oh I didn't know that there are paths which have only one point. You can attach PDF in this issue.\n. What do you mean by 'static'? You can provide a customized `pdf2htmlEx.js` via `--data-dir` option (https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Command-Line-Options ).. Searching \"themes.googleusercontent.com\" in this repo returns zero result. Maybe it is from a 3rd party lib or a browser extension. Can you provide the url to your converted file?. @coolwanglu \nI have implemented [\"covered text handling\"](https://github.com/duanyao/pdf2htmlEX/commits/covered_text_handling) initially.\nCharacters covered by images are detected and (1) are made transparent in text layer, (2) are drawn in background layer.\n\nThere are still things to do:\n- Fix SplashBackgroundRenderer. The covered text handling requires that text layer is drawn before background, but SplashBackgroundRenderer currently doesn't support this mode, so only svg bg works for now.\n- Detect characters covered by paths.\n- Handling clip area.\n- Speed. The hitting test algorithm is naive, may be slow for complicated pages.\n- Merge neighboring transparent chars. Now each char has a `<span>`.\n. - The only public interface is `std::vector<bool> & HTMLRenderer::get_chars_covered()`. Optimization could be done in `HTMLRenderer::add_non_char_bbox(double * bbox, int index)` who makes hitting test.\n- We have to do char-drawing at least two passes, one for hitting test, one for selective drawing on background. The problem is, how to hint the second pass which chars should be drawn? I don't know a better way than a `chars_covered` array. I'm afraid the data structures used internally in the first pass is irreverent here.\n- The Big-O complexity of current algorithm is estimated as O(m*n), m for char count, n for non-char graphics count, if very few chars are covered. Assume each hitting test use 100 CPU cycles, and for a page where m=n=2000, the total time is 0.4G cycles, or 0.2s on a 2GHz core. This is not quite fast, but satisfying me for now, as most of my PDF pages are not that complex. \n\nThanks for recommending rtree, I'll take a look at it later.\n. Sure. Firstly I want to fix the broken SplashBackgroundRenderer, and this may introduce conflicts with [pending PR 360](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/pull/360), so I want to do it after #360 it merged.\n. @zogwarg, how did you test the \"covered text\"? Did you build [covered_text_handling](https://github.com/duanyao/pdf2htmlEX/tree/covered_text_handling) branch with `cmake -DENABLE_SVG=ON`, and pass `--correct-text-visibility 1` at runtime? It is off by default.\n\nI tested your PDF's p15, `--correct-text-visibility 1` worked as expected.\n. @bilalmughal I can reproduce your issue. However it is not related to `--correct-text-visibility`, but seems a problem of poppler(or cario)'s SVG renderer. Using poppler's `pdftocario -svg` command to convert your file, the output SVG file also looks blank in chrome, firefox, and inkscape, though shows some texts in gnome image viewer. I suggest you to report the `pdftocario -svg` bug to poppler (https://bugs.freedesktop.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=poppler&list_id=457322) if you can.\n. @bilalmughal could you post the link to the poppler's bug so that we can track the progress?\n. EOT is for IE8-, however pdf2htmlEX is not targeting at IE8-, because they don't support CSS transform, which would ruin the entire layout.\n\nIt seems ttf/otf + woff are needed to cover all modern browsers. If you don't care stock android browser before 4.4, woff is enough(http://caniuse.com/#search=woff); if you don't care IE mobile, ttf/otf is enough (http://caniuse.com/#search=ttf).\n. I also encountered this issue for some pdf files recently. \nThere are fonts share a same `DescendantFonts`, and has different `ToUnicode` tables, and these tables are compatible. In this case, I think pdf2htmlEx should be able to avoid duplicated fonts.\n\nExample:\nthe first font:\n\n```\n379 0 obj\n<<\n/BaseFont /AGKMCI+FZDBSJW--GB1-0\n/DescendantFonts [1146 0 R]\n/Encoding /Identity-H\n/Subtype /Type0\n/ToUnicode 1152 0 R\n/Type /Font\n>>\nendobj\n\n1152 0 obj\n<<\n/Length 380\n>>\nstream\n/CIDInit /ProcSet findresource begin\n12 dict begin\nbegincmap\n/CIDSystemInfo\n<< /Registry (Adobe)\n/Ordering (UCS) /Supplement 0 >> def\n/CMapName /Adobe-Identity-UCS def\n/CMapType 2 def\n1 begincodespacerange\n<0000> <FFFF>\nendcodespacerange\n4 beginbfchar\n<040B> <5143>\n<1284> <7B2C>\n<02B7> <4E00>\n<04ED> <5355>\nendbfchar\nendcmap CMapName currentdict /CMap defineresource pop end end\n\nendstream\nendobj\n```\n\nthe second font.\n\n```\n628 0 obj\n<<\n/BaseFont /YOLBEC+FZDBSJW--GB1-0\n/DescendantFonts [1146 0 R]\n/Encoding /Identity-H\n/Subtype /Type0\n/ToUnicode 1176 0 R\n/Type /Font\n>>\nendobj\n\n1176 0 obj\n<<\n/Length 380\n>>\nstream\n/CIDInit /ProcSet findresource begin\n12 dict begin\nbegincmap\n/CIDSystemInfo\n<< /Registry (Adobe)\n/Ordering (UCS) /Supplement 0 >> def\n/CMapName /Adobe-Identity-UCS def\n/CMapType 2 def\n1 begincodespacerange\n<0000> <FFFF>\nendcodespacerange\n4 beginbfchar\n<0304> <4E8C>\n<040B> <5143>\n<1284> <7B2C>\n<04ED> <5355>\nendbfchar\nendcmap CMapName currentdict /CMap defineresource pop end end\n\nendstream\nendobj\n```\n. These pdf's are produced by acrobat X's optimizer (ghostscript complains about them so no result), so I think it's unlikely that most PDF optimizers would handle this situation. After all, these structures in a pdf don't introduce much bloat.\n. @coolwanglu \nUpdate: I re-tested with ghostscript 9.10, and it does optimize these fonts in my pdf's. After that, pdf2htmlEX will not produce duplicated fonts. However, both acrobat and ghostscript have their limitations.\n\nI think this could be a low priority feature, and I suggest that people who encounter this issue give ghostscript a try. These docs may be useful:\n\n[PDF manipulation tips, Part 1 Ghostscript](http://www.peteryu.ca/tutorials/publishing/pdf_manipulation_tips)\n[Ghostscript pdfwrite options](http://git.ghostscript.com/?p=ghostpdl.git;a=blob_plain;f=gs/doc/Ps2pdf.htm;hb=master#Options)\n. @yu-liang-kono \nWould you try ghostscript to optimize your pdf? As I said above, ghostscript can probably merge fonts with same name.\n. @yu-liang-kono \nYou are welcome. Ghostscript is awesome!\n. `pointer-events: none` can disable dragging img (also disable \"copy image\" in context menu), and `user-select: none` can disable selection. If there are no known bad side-effect, I'll create a PR.\n. In the result of http://djvs.co/c4e83676-437a-46a8-8402-533faf3b622e.pdf \n\"8\"s are actually spaces, however displayed as \"8\" in that font. Why this happen is still to be investigated.\n\nEven without `--optimize-text 1`, the \"8\"s are still there, however they are wrapped in `span._`, which happen to have `color: transparent`, so looks \"correct\".\n\nSo the problem @djvs reported seems not a bug of `--optimize-text`.\n. I believe scoped CSS is a perfect solution for this type of issue, however only Firefox support it for now (http://caniuse.com/#search=scoped). There is a [polyfill](https://github.com/PM5544/scoped-polyfill) for other browsers, but I haven't tried.\n\nAnother solution is the good old iframe.\n. @coolwanglu conflict introduced by putting 2 generated htm together is still not resolved, as you discussed above. However the ability to add prefix to css is better than nothing.\n. I think random prefix is a good idea. We may let users to specify the length of prefix.\n. @Helidium No progress yet. Is iframe feasible in your case?\n. @Helidium iframes can be considered as parts of their parent document. You may also consider merging those PDFs before converting to html, if they are actually parts of one document.\n\nFor css generation codes, look at [`all_manager.xxx.install()`](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/blob/2edf41eaa1234298241e05b66b6cbadb77c0bd93/src/HTMLTextLine.cc#L159). Maybe you can add a random number to those classes for each conversion to avoid collision.\n. @dsablic You pdf is converted without setPrinting(false), the color is correct, except that the image contains \"WILEY-VCH\" at the bottom-right corner is invisible, probably due to wrong positioning. Poppler's pdftocairo also has this problem.\n\nThis image is drawn by `CairoOutputDev::drawImageMask()` method, and it walks different paths when `printing` is true/false.\n\nMy poppler version is 0.24.5.\n. @coolwanglu I checked out pdf2htmlEX v0.11, and poppler version is 0.24.5.\n. 1. Let `BackgroundRenderer::render_page()` returns an 'image' or something may require quite a few refactors, and make `HTMLRenderer::process` a little more complicated. I'd like to find a better way.\n2. Maybe we can count drawing commands in `CairoOutputDev`, and throw an exception if it exceeds a given limit? `HTMLRenderer::process` can catch the exception and fall back to `SplashBackgroundRenderer`. However, I'm not sure this is enough, I see that `CairoOutputDev` is also used by type3 font rendering.\n   PS, I think counting the number of <'s is OK because <'s in XML text are escaped, and comments, processing instructions, CDATAs, and DTDs are rare in SVG. \n. I see, I'll keep `CairoOutputDev` untouched.\n\n`svg_nodes_limit` is applied to individual pages, and only pages' with too many svg nodes fall back to bitmap bg, other pages are not affected, so that the overall quality will not be degraded too much.\nSo exit-and-re-run is not an alternative.\n. Currently HTMLRenderer don't care about the actual type of `bg_renderer`, it's just a `BackgroundRenderer`. Not all BackgroundRenderer's sub classes need a fallback, and only the sub-class known which sub-class it want to fall back to. so I'd rather add an optional property 'fallback_renderer' to HTMLRenderer:\n\n```\nfallback = bg_renderer->get_fallback_renderer();\nbg_renderer->init(doc);\nif (fallback != nullptr)\n  fallback->init(doc);\n...\n\nbg_renderer->render_page(...);\nif(!bg_renderer->ok() && fallback != nullptr)\n{\n   fallback->render_page(...);\n}\n...\n\nif(bg_renderer->ok())\n  bg_renderer->embed_image(pageNum);\nelse\n  fallback->embed_image(pageNum);\n```\n\nHowever, I don't think this approach is cleaner than the original implementation.\n. OK, I'll try this way.\n. Please hold the merging, I'll rebase the branch.\n. Rebased ok.\n. All problems are fixed, I think.\n. It depends on how browsers apply same-origin policy to local files.\nFirefox [allow access to local files in same dir](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Same-origin_policy_for_file:_URIs);\nChrome doesn't allow access to local files by default, but has some [command line options to enable it](http://joshuamcginnis.com/2011/02/28/how-to-disable-same-origin-policy-in-chrome/).\nIE doesn't allow access to local files.\n. I fixed the order.\n. I found a bug in this patch, please wait.\n. The bug is fixed.\n. PDF call the jpeg image's filter `DCTEncode`.\n. @coolwanglu \nIs there still any problem?\n. Now the code is cleaned and rebased to incoming.\n. Just because these 2 features have some interopration, so I rebased #360 on #356. #356 can be closed.\n. It seems I'm unable to change a PR's base branch, even if I've rebased my branch. So I created a new one #364.\n. Repaced with #365\n. You are welcome. [My company](http://mainbo.com) is evaluating pdf2htmlEX for e-textbook applications so I need to improve this tool to meet our requirements. I'd like to also thank you for this excellent tool!\n. Now stroked path handling is improved by breaking path into steps, each step forms a bbox and takes part in the covering test.\n. I use cairo because CairoOutputDev already depends on cairo, and I can borrow some codes from it. If there are more suitable 2D graphics library, we can make another version of DrawingTracer.\n\nCairo also has apis to check the bounding box of area changed, e.g. cairo_fill_extents, cairo_stoke_extents, and are already used. But we want to do more than that, e.g. [break path being stroked into steps](https://github.com/duanyao/pdf2htmlEX/commit/96b8438a45c0365ea64afadbffe86e2b7cfe7659).\n\nPartially covered/clipped chars are treated as covered chars.\n\nHTML lacks support of universial drawing (except canvas). Fallback mode with SVG works fine. However texts are converted to paths, and may result in quite complicated, bloated SVG, which makes mobile devices had to render. That's one of the motives of this patch.\n. A very initial implemantion of this patch doesn't depend on cairo, but can only handle text covered by image, and the clip is not considered. If some users definitedly don't want cairo, we may degrade DrawingTracer to that level.\n. > Another way of tackling this is to render a hidden text layer and a full svg -- but we export the fonts in the current way and use them inside SVG -- which might sound clearer.\n\nYes, a pure SVG solution is probably the final answer, if the rendering performance is not degraded significantly. Maybe a hidden text layer is not necessary, because firefox has already been able to select texts in SVG. \n. > How about a chat some time, I'm not sure how I can help. Especially I really want to convince the poppler people to expose more about the CairoOutputDev interfaces.\n\nI' OK for a chat. I'm not sure what type of CairoOutputDev interfaces we need at this time.\n. > At some point we might move forward to the svg backend, and in this case, I think it might makes more sense to break the background image into parts and actually make them overlap with each other in HTML\n\nYou mean interleaving SVG and HTML elements? I think this can be quite complex to implement, and breaking a single big SVG into several small ones may offer almost no size or performance benefits. Using SVG exclusively may be better.\n. @coolwanglu Sorry I was stuck on an bug and didn't check my email. Now I've managed to join #pdf2htmlEX.\n. @coolwanglu I made some improvements.\nHow about the option name? Is `--correct-text-visibility` OK?\n. Well, I'll use `--correct-text-visibility` then.\n. @coolwanglu option name changed.\n. I have made some PDFs for testing, I'll submit some later.\n. @cdeblois give `incoming` branch a try please. If the problem still persisits, please fill a bug with a sample PDF page.\n. Almost. Note that you should `cmake -DENABLE_SVG=ON .`, or `--correct-text-visibility` only has limited capbility.\n. This patch is a little tricky, because GfxState is probably not expected to be changed by the OutputDev code. So I try to not affect other drawing behaviors by saving/restoring GfxState. \nHowever, there are still PDFs that are not rendered with expected color in proof mode.\n. This patch has been improved significantly: \n1. Move most code to `BackgroundRenderer`, duplicated codes are removed. \n2. Use a new `GfxState` instance to 'chreat' `OutputDev`, instead of save/restore mechanism. \n3. Set proof color in `beginString()` instead of `beginTextObject()` because color can be changed inside text object.\n4. Select proof color according to color distance.\n. Inside a PDF text object, the color can be changed (e.g. by `g` operator), but I don't known whether save/restore operators can be used there. Even if save/restore works, the code is more complex and costly.\n. @coolwanglu Do you think `--proof 1` (rendering text in bg in original colors) is useful? I always use `--proof 2` myself.\n. Is it OK to remove the original-color mode? So this option would be easier to remember and use. \n. That's right, so I leave it.\nIn future we may always fill and stroke the texts in bg in different colors, say red/white, then no matter what the bg color is, the texts are visible. This technology has been used by some subtitles of video.\n. @coolwanglu problems fixed\n. With the latest commit, no matter what the bg color is, the texts on bg are visible.\n. This fix 2 issue:\n1. render modes rather than 0 (fill) are often set inside text objects, if we only save render modes in beginTextObject, we loose track of them.\n2. if text matrix rotates by 45 degree, one of `lx` and `ly` is transformed to 0, so the line width is set to 0, which is not correct. So change line width to 1/70 diagonal of font size.\n\nAnothor thing: `--proof 2` use fill & stroke for background texts, however in PDF stroke can overwrite part of the filled area, which makes small sized text less legible. What I really want is something like CSS `text-shadow`, but I don't known how to achieve this. \n. Oh I wasn't aware of that. Reverted output-filename.\n. Some of the issues are probably due to the old poppler you are using, try poppler 0.26 or higher.\nSome of the issues can be reproduced by myself, however you'd better create a separate bug report for each type issue.\n. I'm using poppler 0.26.1.\n. `poppler/Gfx.h` has not been changed between 0.26.1 and 0.26.3, so maybe your poppler was not installed properly. What system are you using?  Poppler packages for Ubuntu can be downloaded from https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/poppler .\n. Yes.\nPage-1 from VKG-ALL-IPADQUICK.pdf , Pages from VISTAIR_Brochure.pdf, Page-605 from AXM-EZD-OMD.pdf: images' color is correct as long as `--svg-embed-bitmap 0` not set, and --svg-embed-bitmap 0 should dump .jpg files.\n\nSo maybe it's a problem related to cairo? my cairo version is 1.13.1.\n\nPlease raise a separate issue for each test case. But I think the svg position/size problems is a same issue.\n. Well, if you set `--svg-embed-bitmap 0`, you should also set `--embed-image 0` or `--embed i`, or the dumped bitmaps can't be loaded.\n. It is my commit 39e171a73760c5120a7bd4c30d4fd4b06974b0b1 \"Improve covered text handling\", I'll look into it later.\nCan you send the pdf to my mail box 'duanyao at mainbo.com'? I have difficulty to access dropbox.\n. Confirmed. `--space-as-offset 1` is not handled correctly.\n. This bug occurs when both `--optimize-text 1 --space-as-offset 1` is on, and there are spaces at the beginning of a line.\nThis bug has been fixed by #406. All your sample files should be rendered correctly now.\n\nAnother tip: your files need a larger `--font-size-multiplier` (e.g. 20) to position texts accurately, see #369, and you can verify the result by `--proof 2`.\n. Reproducible on Ubuntu. pdf2htmlEX crashes in fontforge with one of its embedded fonts (`__raw_font_3.ttf`).\nFontforge GUI from the pdf2htmlEX branch (7df63eff7f9536ade6f6b9ca0525198f5c44f091) also crash with this font, however master branch (e963b7f7b27e836da64d12688550f25d5ef37d25) don't.\n. Currently there is no format conversion when `--svg-embed-bitmap 0` is set, the dumped jpg files are just copied from the PDF; in contrast, `--svg-embed-bitmap 1` may convert format (in this case jpg->png).\n\nThe dumped jpg files are actually not corrupted, they are in CMYK color space. Unfortunately, it seems most programs can't display them correctly (browsers, GIMP), except 'display' utility in imagemagick. It seems poppler is aware of this issue so it convert these images to png when producing SVG.\n\nMost open source programs use IJG libjpeg to handle jpg. When I test its djpeg utility with the dumped images (`djpeg -bmp -rgb o24.jpg`), it says \"Unsupported color conversion request\" and fails, so I doubt it support CMYK or not?\n\nSo this is arguably a bug in libjpeg or browsers. But If we can't figure out a better solution in short time, I'll workaround this issue by ignoring `--svg-embed-bitmap 0` when non-RGB/gray jpg is encountered. \n\nBy the way, it is better to convert color space of PDF to RGB before feeding to pdf2htmlEX, this not only workaround this issue, but also significantly reduces the output file size (CMYK has 4 channels). You can use acrobat or ghostscript to do this. The command for the latter can be: \n`gs -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dColorConversionStrategy=/sRGB -sOutputFile=output.pdf input.pdf`\nSee also https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Optimizing-PDF-Files\n. Update: \n\nIt seems in PDF, CMYK jpg's color is interpreted inverted against most other programs. I converted a PDF to CMYK by ghostscript and then converted it by pdf2htmlEX, and the dumped jpeg is still in inverted color.\n\nAlso 'display' utility in imagemagick seems always show CMYK jpg in inverted color, even the CMYK jpg is generated by imagemagick 'convert' utility. This happens to be consistent with PDF, so it show the images \"correctly\".\n\nI don't know much about CMYK and jpeg, maybe we have to ignore --svg-embed-bitmap 0 for CMYK jpeg.\n\n@coolwanglu any idea?\n. Further reach show that PDF does treat CMYK jpeg inverted in contrast to most other programs.\n\nIf create a PDF from a CMYK jpeg file by acrobat, the resulting image dictionary has a `/Decode [1.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 0.0]` entry, which effectively invert all color components. pdf2htmlEX can dump jpeg in this PDF without problem.\n\nThe pdf in this bug report, in contrast, don't have such inverting `/Decode` entries, and the default ones are `[ 0.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 ]`, which is an identity transform, so the dumped jpegs have inverted color.\n\nOn the other hand, if create a PDF from a RGB jpeg file by acrobat, no `/Decode` entry is presented.\n\nHowever, I can't find the statement in PDF spec saying that \"CMYK jpeg(or all format?) should be intercepted in inverted color\". Anyone can help?\n\nSo we may check the `/Decode` entry before dumping images: for cmyk jpeg, dump only if inverting `/Decode` exists; for rgb jpeg, dump only if no `/Decode` or identity `/Decode` exists.\n. @davidhedley \n Poppler and cairo create the SVG, and most of the work is done by cairo. Poppler provides a hook to allow client code to decide what to do with images inside a PDF. If client code don't want to handle images (`--svg-embed-bitmap 1`), poppler's default behavior is embedding all images into SVG, and convert format if necessary. It seems poppler decides that CMYK jpeg need to be converted (and color-inverted) to png, so the result is correct.\n. @davidhedley \nThanks! It helped a lot.  See also: [JPEG file embedded in PDF (CMYK)](https://forums.adobe.com/thread/975777).\n\nMy conclusion is: PDF readers do color conversion incompatibly with most other programs (including browsers): other programs invert CMYK color if 'Adobe' marker (app14) presents in a jpeg file; while PDF readers don't, they solely rely on /Decode array to invert color. \n\nIn your PDF, the CMYK jpegs' color is not inverted, and have no /Decode array. However they have 'Adobe' marker (you can see them by a hex editor), so if they are dumped, browsers will show them in inverted color.\n\nWhy 'Adobe' marker triggers color inverting? This is due to an old photoshop bug (according to doc of libjpeg) -- it wrote CMYK jpeg in inverted color (and wrote 'Adobe' marker), and this became a convention (sigh). However, PostScript and PDF decided not to follow this convention (sigh).\n\nNow this issue is fixed by not dumping CMYK jpeg, see #407.\n. This a a known limitation, we use bounding boxes of chars, images, and paths to evaluate chars' visibility. This is simple and fast, but sometimes too conservative.\nIn your PDF, there are some non-rectangular paths. They don't overlap any text, however their bounding boxes do, so the overlapped texts is treated as if obscured.\n. Because spaces may be remove by `--space-as-offset 1`, so previously the char indexes were changed in the text layer, which would affects covered text handling. So I insert a padding char ('\\0') as a placeholder for each removed space. Also, ligature decomposing has an opposite effect, so the decomposed chars are stored separately.\n. Then we'll need a way to maintain the mapping between the two type of texts, I suspect it is equally or more complicated.\n. How about:\n\n```\nstruct PDFChar\n{\n  State * state;\n  union\n  {\n    uint ch; // unicode\n    int decomposed_idx;\n    float offset;\n  }\n  enum \n  {\n    Character,\n    Offset,\n    Padding,\n    Ligature // ligature that to be decomposed. \n  } type;\n}\n```\n\nOffset type can add more PDFChar, however when doing covered text handling they can be easily skipped.\n\nP.S. What is the purpose of using a linked list?\n. `type == Ligature` means this PDFChar is a decomposed ligature, and `decomposed_idx` is the index of the decomposed ligature in `HTMLTextLine::decomposed_text`.\n\n`type == Offset` means this PDFChar represents a x-offset, and the value is `offset`. This replaces the `HTMLTextLine::offsets`.\n. In current implementation, \"dump\" means copy image data to external file unmodified, and this requires browsers and PDF viewers to handle the image data in a same way. Unfortunately, in case of CMYK jpeg,  this is usually not true, as I posted in bug #400.\n\nPoppler of cause can decode CMYK jpeg and do color conversion properly, but it can't re-encode image into jpeg (it can re-encode into png). Actually we can get the decoded image from poppler, but re-encoding-and-dumping feature is just not implemented yet. This means not only CMYK jpeg, images that are not jpeg can't be dumped either.\n\nI'd suggest users to pre-process their PDFs by ghostscript or acrobat, converting all images therein to RGB/Gray jpeg, to ensure that dumping works properly. This also reduces file size a lot.\n. Done, is that OK?\n. Well, it is a trade-off: we need define another marco (ENABLE_DT_DEBUG) to be able to use #if/#endif, and #if/#endif only saves one token for a 3-line DT_DEBUG group. However in most cases a single line DT_DEBUG is enough. \n. Tokens are the minimum unit of the lexer's output, i.e '#ifdef','DT_DEBUG','printf' are all tokens.\nYes, DT_DEBUG() is arguably less readable, and it is not like a function -- one should read it as a 'mini-#ifdef'.\nBut why should a macro mimic a function? If it is like a function, one should write a function instead. Macro is supposed to do things that function can't.\n. I agree DT_DEBUG() is less readable for new readers, but it only take a few seconds to read and understand its definition. When debugging, one my add quite a few DT_DEBUG() here and there, so it is important to be easy to input.\n\nIn your example, inserting non-debugging codes between related debugging code should be avoided.\n. Not for normal users. But I think other developers who want to debug positioning related bugs would find these output useful, even if not related to covered text handling.\n. My personal opinion is that the readability of  DT_DEBUG() is not that bad, and developers should not take long to be accustomed with it. This is not a new idea, `CairoOutputDev.cc` already use a similar macro `LOG()`.\n\nAlso I think `#ifdef` has its weak point in readability too: If being used too much, it clutter codes significantly. There are already many `#if ENABLE_SVG` there.\n\nSo I think we need some trade-off. Of cause, If you insist, I can change them to `#ifdef`.\n. Maybe using #ifdef for multi-line debug code is better in some sense. However if you read it as a mini-ifdef, it is perhaps not that weird.\n\n`DEBUG(printf(...))` is more flexible -- you can put any expression in it, like `cerr << ...` or a custom logging function, not just a wraper of printf().\n. Good point. I think I'll never write that. For more compicated debug codes, #ifdef is necessary.\nFor very simple loop, maybe `DT_DEBUG(for(int i=0;i<4;i++) printf(\"%d\", i);)` is ok.\n. One may want to print something to stderror instead of stdout, or just prefers C++ style cout/cerr. Also, DT_DEBUG don't hurt code highlight/assist (at least eclipse CDT ok). If we feel DEBUG_PRINTF is enough, it is better to define it as a function, not a marco, and use #ifdef in its body. However, DT_DEBUG is still  easier to implement.\n\nCurrently I don't feel it is useful for normal users to submit a DrawingTracer log, because debugging posisioning issues always needs the PDF file, and we can reproduce the issue ourselves.\n. Yes, I mean debug_printf(...) is better being implemented as a function:\n\n```\nvoid debug_printf(const char* str, ...)\n{\n#if XXX_DEBUG\n  va_list vl;\n  va_start(vl, str);\n  vfprintf(stderr, str, vl);\n  va_end(vl);\n#endif\n}\n```\n\nwe can even add logging level to the function.\n\nI also remeber that we can switch debug log by a const:\n\n```\nconst static boolean DT_DEBUG = true;\n...\nif (DT_DEBUG)\n{\n    int i;\n    do something with i;\n    cerr << i;\n}\n...\nif (DT_DEBUG) cerr << 'bla'; // Is one-line if acceptable to you?\n```\n\nThis should be even more readable than macros, and still simple. \nWhen the const is set to false, these dead codes should be optimized out.\ngcc doesn't warn this (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22852364/is-there-a-gcc-warning-for-conditional-expression-is-constant), however MSVC warns if highest warning level is enabled.\n. About \"a 'unified' function for debug messages\", I think it has a small disadvantage. Ususally we know a bug exists in a certain module, and want to see logs from that module only. If logs of from all modules are switched on at once, we'll have to filter the logs.\n. Then how about define `const static bool GLOBAL_ENABLE_LOG = true;` in a global header, and\ndefine `const static bool ENABLE_LOG = GLOBAL_ENABLE_LOG && true;` in each cpp?\n. I changed `DT_DEBUG` to a `static const bool`. Is that OK?\n. I was not familiar with `constexpr`, but it seems that [\"a constexpr specifier used in an object declaration implies const\"](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constexpr), so what's the difference?\n. I see. const in this case should also imply a compile-time constant, <del>maybe in rare case it depends on compilers?</del>while constexpr enforces a compile-time constant, so it is more clear.\n. If the generated page is renderred OK in some browsers but not in others, it is probably a bug of browsers (or in rare case, bug of web standards). For example, fontsize100.html is 'garbage' in firefox because of this bug: \nhttps://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1027580\n, and I also discussed it in #369.\n\nIf you can narrow down the relavent html/css and confirm it is a browser's bug, you may submit a bug to that browser. Of cause, it is still worthwhile to file a issue here, so that we can figure out a workaround before buggy browsers disapear.\n\nPS. I'm not able to access dropbox, maybe due to the limiation of chinese network. Could you send it to duanyao at mainbo dot com ?\n. I think this issue is actually a bug of chrome: it doesn't apply CSS `word-spacing` to the space at the beginning of a line.\n\nIf both `--optimize-text` and `--space-as-offset` is on, some lines of your converted html file contain leading spaces, and have non-zero `word-spacing` and `white-space:pre` style, so they are not rendered correctly by chrome. So this issue is not related to `--font-size-multiplier`, but `--optimize-text` and `--space-as-offset`.\n\nSimplified test case (also available [at jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/60dvtceh/)):\n\n``` html\n<div style=\"word-spacing:1em; white-space:pre; border:1px red solid;\"> Has leading  space, style=\"word-spacing:1em; white-space:pre\"</div>\n<div style=\"white-space:pre; border:1px red solid;\"> Has leading  space, style=\"white-space:pre\"</div>\n<div style=\"border:1px red solid;\"> Has leading  space, style=\"\"</div>\n```\n\nI tested other browsers, webkit also has this bug, IE11 and firefox work as expected.\n\nAccording to [CSS spec](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-text/#word-spacing-property):\n\n> Word spacing affects each space (U+0020) and non-breaking space (U+00A0), left in the text after the white space processing rules have been applied.\n\nIf `white-space:pre` is applied, leading spaces are \"left in the text after the white space processing rules  have been applied\", so `word-spacing` should be applied to them too. However, chrome/webkit always give leading spaces normal width regardless of `word-spacing`.\n\nSo we may want to report the bug to chrome/webkit (I added [one for chrome](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=404444)). Meanwhile, before browsers have fixed this bug, pdf2htmlEX should avoid generating leading spaces.\n. Done ()\n. This is a chrome/webkit bug.\n\nA simplified test case (also [here](http://jsfiddle.net/q434vyu6/2/)):\n\n``` html\n<style>\n#span1:after { /* content:''; */ }\n</style>\n<div>Any thing here.<span id=\"span1\" style=\"white-space:pre; word-spacing:-1px; display: inline-block;\"> Span1 begins with a space. <span id=\"span2\" style=\"display: inline-block;\">Span2</span></span></div>\n```\n\nIn chrome/webkit, the `#span2` is wrapped to a next line.\n\nThis problem requires quite a few conditions to reproduce:\n- one span nested in another span.\n- the inner span is the last node of the outer span.\n- the 2 spans are both `inline-block`.\n- the outer span has `white-space:pre`.\n- the outer span's text content starts with a space.\n- the outer span's `word-spacing` is negative, no matter how small it is.\n\nIf any of above conditions is not satisfied, the problem disappears.\n\nChrome/webkit actually support negative `word-spacing`, I was wrong with this.\n\nI suspect this bug is a combined effect of 2 chrome/webkit bugs:\n1. [ inline-block not honored as white-space:pre's last-child of a line](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35443)\n    Sadly, this bug was reported 4 years ago and still not fixed!\n2. [word-spacing doesn't correctly applied to leading spaces](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=404444)\n\npdf2htmlEX already has workarounds for the 2 bug. For the first one, adds a node to the end of divs:\n\n``` css\n.t:after {\n  content: '';\n}\n```\n\nFor the second one, pdf2htmlEX avoids put spaces at the beginning of divs.\n\nUnfortunately, none of them cover the nested-span situation.\n\n<del>If change `.t:after` in CSS to `.t:after, .t span:after`, this bug can be workarounded. However, I don't know the performance hit of this method. @coolwanglu, what do you think?</del>\n\nActually, chrome/webkit also don't apply `word-spacing` to the leading spaces of a `inline-block` span if the `word-spacing` is just specified on that span. So anyway we must also avoid leading spaces in a `inline-block` span which has non-zero `word-spacing`. What a mess!\n. @coolwanglu I can reproduce with latest incoming branch, no matter what params are specified.\nWithout params, the 4th `div.t` which is rendered wrongly in chrome/webkit is:\n\n``` html\n<div class=\"t m0 x3 h4 y4 ff3 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0\">Les chercheurs de fossiles<span class=\"ls1 ws1\"> <span class=\"_ _4\"></span>..............................................<span class=\"_ _3\"></span><span class=\"ff4 ls0 ws0\">2</span></span></div>\n```\n\nNote the space at the beginning of the first span, and ws1 is negative.\n\nThe md5sum of the pdf in question is `ba002d9655a9da87a9bdb699a66d4a75`.\n. If we don't style `.t span` as `inline-blobk` in base.css, this bug can be workarounded, and at least this file looks correct.\n\nAs I understand, some spans contains only spaces need to be `inline-blobk`, because their `width` needs to be specified. Spans contains only spaces are already assigned with `inline-blobk` in content css, e.g. \n\n``` css\n._5 {\ndisplay: inline-block;\nwidth: 1.051200px;\n}\n```\n\nSo I think maybe it is safe to not style `.t span` as `inline-blobk`. The workaround `.t:after` may also be removed.\n. Negative margin also works on inline elements, and I didn't found any difference after change them to inline. Are there other browser bugs involved?\n\nI noticed that negative offsets are made `inline` in a rule, althouth it is overriden by the `.t span` rule:\n\n``` css\n._3 {\n    display: inline;\n    margin-left: -5.808px;\n}\n```\n\nWhat is the purpose?\n. @coolwanglu Do you notice that your sample looks different in IE 11, chrome and firefox? Currently I don't know which one is correct, but it seems `inline-block` is an area full of browsers' bugs, so we'd better use it sparsely. I suggest only use `inline-block` for positive offsets and white spaces with positive width.\n. Use `inline` for `.t span` by default, and `inline-block` for `._N` with positive `width` only.\nThis (inline-block removed) looks the same in all browsers:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/v19q42nh/3/\n. It seems browsers disagree with how should [shrink-to-fit](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-box/#shrink-to-fit) work with negative margins, because the spec is unclear. This affects the width calculation of not only `inline-block`, but also `float` and `position:absolute` elements. See http://jsfiddle.net/et37getw/2/.\n\nHowever, this is a little off-topic.\n. @davidhedley For this issue, the solution could be more simpler, as I said above: avoid unnecessary `inline-block`, just use `inline` where possible. However I just have no time to do this.\n\nChromium has admitted the word-spacing bug, so I think it won't take too long to be fixed.\n. Is this issue specific to mobile safari and not to desktop safari? Which version of webkit does your mobile safari use? I don't have mobile safari to test, but epiphany 3.10.3 which uses webkit 538.15 renders `MobileSafariSpacing.pdf` perfectly. The params I used are `--font-size-multiplier 10 --proof 2` or `--optimize-text 1 --space-as-offset 1 --font-size-multiplier 10 --proof 2`. Probably this was bug in webkit that has been fixed.\n\n`--optimize-text 1 --space-as-offset 1` can merge continious spaces, can this make mobile safari work? \n\nP.S.  I don't think Chrome/Firefox etc collapse spaces because we set `white-space: pre` on `.t`.\n. `--space-as-offset 1` replaces spaces by \"offsets\"(`<span>`s with widths/margins), while  `--optimize-text 1` converts offsets between words to spaces where possible, so the combined effect is merging continious spaces. The downside of `--space-as-offset 1` is that it drops spaces.\n\nIt seems your Mobile Safari use a very new webkit, so it may be a regression. I think it is likely a webkit bug, though it is also possible due to apple's private changes to webkit. Maybe it is better to report the bug to apple with a minimum test case.\n. I'm also using ubuntu 14.04 and have no problem building fontforge. \nI built it like this:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/coolwanglu/fontforge.git fontforge.git\ncd fontforge.git\ngit checkout pdf2htmlEX\n\nsudo apt-get install -qq autotools-dev libjpeg-dev libtiff4-dev libpng12-dev libgif-dev libxt-dev autoconf automake libtool bzip2 libxml2-dev libuninameslist-dev libspiro-dev python-dev libpango1.0-dev libcairo2-dev chrpath uuid-dev uthash-dev\n\n./autogen.sh\n\n./configure --enable-debug\nmake V=1\nsudo make install\nfontforge -version\n\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib\nexport LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib\n```\n\nDid the error only occur when building pdf2htmlEX branch? How about master branch?\n. gcc 4.8.2 should be new enough. Just a guess, do you have other C/C++ compilers installed? Try `c++ -v` and `cc -v`. See also #144 .\n. This is a same issue as #416.\nHowever I'm suprised that old chromium had worked.\n. Text selection issue in your file is not related to `--correct-text-visibility`, it also occurs without any params.\n\nThe problem is: there is a `div.c` near the end of the first page of the generated html, which covers the whole page, so that makes almost all texts unselectable -- except itself.\n\nA `div.c` coresponds to a clip path in PDF file and uses `overflow:hidden` to achieve  a clipping effect. Unfortunately, it has the side effect of blocking user interactions (including seletion) with elements below a `div.c`.\n\nIn fact, `--correct-text-visibility` already handles clipping quite well, and should not have such side effect. So can we suppress `div.c` when `--correct-text-visibility` is on? Can we use CSS clipping when `--correct-text-visibility` is off? Or just get rid of  `div.c` completely?\n\n@cdeblois, your issue title and content seem not quite accurate, can you modify it?\n. Yes, that's ok.\n. @cdeblois I think it isn't a trival task to fix this in pdf2htmlEX and may take time.\nIf you can afford modifying the output html by hand, you can locate the problematic `div.c` and assign `z-index: -1` style to it. However sometimes this can make stacking order of texts incorrect.\n. `div.c` means `div` elements that have class `c` -- in pdf2htmlEX generated html, class `c` means \"clip\". \nYes, this issue depends on how a PDF using clips. You can use devtools in browers (ususlly `F12` key) to locate the problematic `div.c`, and modify it by a text editor.\n\nIntroduction to devtools in browers:\nhttp://www.labnol.org/software/chrome-dev-tools-tutorial/28131/\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector\n. No, don't remove `div.c`(or some texts will be removed also), you should add an attribute `style=\"z-index:-1\"` to it. If you are not familiar with html & css and don't understand what I say, you have to wait until this issue get fixed -- however there is no schedule, sorry. \n. It seems you need to add a rule `.pc { z-index: 0; }` to make the `z-index: -1` trick work in chrome. The complete rules could be:\n\n``` css\n.c { z-index: -1; }\n.bf { z-index: -1; } /* bring background image below .c */\n.pc { z-index: 0; } /* ensure a new stacking context on chrome*/\n```\n\nRemoving class `c` is more problematic, because its children are positioned relative to it, and clipped by it.\n\nThose questions were asked to other developers of pdf2htmlEX.\n. Add all the 3 rules to the CSS. It works in firefox and chrome for me. What browsers did you test?\n\nOh, probably you are using png/jpg background image (I was using svg), In this case `.bf` becomes `.bi`, so the rules to be added are:\n\n``` css\n.c, .bf, .bi { z-index: -1; }\n.pc { z-index: 0; }\n```\n. This CSS trick should be considered as a hack, not a universal solution. If there are multiple `.c` elements in a page and are overlapping each other, some of the texts will still be unselectable. Additionally the z-order of texts is altered, sometimes may result in undesired appearance.\n\nSo I'd like to keep this bug open.\n. Where is your fontforge installed? See `which fontforge` and `which fontforge` --version.\nAlso, commit `a0126eda4d27b83da27b63fc90bb4dfcb5a9fff3` is not in `pdf2htmlEX` branch of fontforge and won't work. See also #420 .\n. Comile & install fontforge to `/usr/local` should be OK. Ubuntu may install an old fontforge deb to `/usr`, and pdf2htmlEX should pick up the former.\n\nI built fontforge like this:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/coolwanglu/fontforge.git fontforge.git\ncd fontforge.git\ngit checkout pdf2htmlEX\n\nsudo apt-get install -qq autotools-dev libjpeg-dev libtiff4-dev libpng12-dev libgif-dev libxt-dev autoconf automake libtool bzip2 libxml2-dev libuninameslist-dev libspiro-dev python-dev libpango1.0-dev libcairo2-dev chrpath uuid-dev uthash-dev\n\n./autogen.sh\n\n./configure --enable-debug\nmake V=1\nsudo make install\n```\n\nI also set\n\n```\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib\nexport LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib\n```\n\nIn my `~/.profile`.\n\nThe PPA version of pdf2htmlEX is a little old.\n. Specify higher `--hdpi` and `--vdpi` should help.\n. Can you provide the sample PDF? I tested a  `<img style=\"width:0.5px; height:50px\"/>` in firefox and chrome, it is visible at 150%+ zooming level in firefox and visible at 90%+ zooming level in chrome, so chrome is better with my test case.\n\nAnyway, I think this is a valid issue, because too small background image can not be reliablely rendered. I suggest reopen this issue and provide more descriptive title and content.\n. Interesting. \n\nMy test show that `pdftocairo` works a little better than `pdftoppm` (without other parameters), but can still lose thin lines in your PDF. \n\nActually `pdftoppm` has an option `-thinlinemode`, values can be `none | solid | shape`, and `solid` is exactly what your patch is trying to do. `shape` seems utilize gray level to represent lines thinner than 1px. However, `none` is the default which can lose thin lines. Maybe we want to expose this option to pdf2htmlEX users. @davidhedley, would you like to do this?\n\nCairo backend has been already used by pdf2htmlEX for SVG background output, so I think it is not hard to do (1). However, `pdftocairo` don't have `-thinlinemode` or something similar, so `pdftoppm` and splash back end still looks superior as far as bitmap output is concerned.\n. I'm OK to have `-thinlinemode shape` by default, but others may prefer `solid`. I don't know why does `pdftoppm` let `none` be the default, maybe it is faster?\n\nMy popper is 0.26.1, seems a little outdated.\n. According to the PDF spec:\n\n10.6.4 Scan Conversion Rules\n...\nA shape shall be scan-converted by painting any pixel whose square region intersects the shape, no matter\nhow small the intersection is. This ensures that no shape ever disappears as a result of unfavourable\nplacement relative to the device pixel grid, as might happen with other possible scan conversion rules. The\narea covered by painted pixels shall always be at least as large as the area of the original shape. This rule\napplies both to fill operations and to strokes with nonzero width. Zero-width strokes may be done in an\nimplementation-defined manner that may include fewer pixels than the rule implies.\n...\n\nIt seems the spec doesn't allow any shape being dropped, no matter whether \"Stroke Adjustment\" is on. So it is still a bug of splash back end.\n. Maybe you want to try `--bg-format svg` and `--svg-embed-bitmap 0`.\n. It seems an old windows build without SVG support.\nYou can try newer versions (https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Download), or build from source by yourself.\n. Is it crash for other PDFs? Try some more PDFs and open new issue(s) for those files cause crash, and provide those files .\n\nHowever I don't have a windows build environment so may not be able to reproduce your problem.\nIf you can play with linux it is better to build from lastest source to figure out the problem (https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Troubleshooting-Crashes).\n. If it crash for every PDF, maybe that windows build itself is broken. I'll try it myself.\n. The windows build of 0.12 also crash any PDF on my ubuntu under wine, so it may be broken. I suggest you try the linux or mac version, or contact the author(rubypdf@gmail.com) of windows build.\n. I think these patches are OK. However I still suggest implementing `--svg-image-count-limit` in `setMimeData()` because it is more elegant and efficient.\n. I think it is OK now.\nP.S. Poppler/cario also only generates one `<image>` elements in the output SVG for an image stream used in a PDF page; if the image stream is drawn multiple times, it generates multiple `<use>` elements. So your previous implementation (count `<image>`) was almost equvalent to the current one. If you want to count image drawing times, do it in `drawImage()` etc.\n. The text drawing code in PDF is `[(\\033\\036\\036\\023.\\020\\r \\023\\007)10.479(\\013\\024\\026\"\\007)]TJ`, corresponding to \"Effective From\". The 8th char(after `\\r`) in PDF is a space, but it is mapped to 'v' in the font's encoding. So when `--space-as-offset` is on, the space is converted to a offset, not 'v'.\n\nAccording to [the comment in pdf2htmlEX code](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/blob/67dac7d9934c8092a1698347073ca2045d16c747/src/HTMLRenderer/text.cc#L88-L100), this is a known limitation.\n\n@coolwanglu can we make `--space-as-offset` more restricted? E.g. change [text.cc:102](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/blob/67dac7d9934c8092a1698347073ca2045d16c747/src/HTMLRenderer/text.cc#L102) from `if(is_space && (param.space_as_offset))` to \n`if(is_space && (param.space_as_offset)  && (uLen == 1) && (u[0] == ' '))`. This seems to bring the 'v' back.\n. I tried to fix this in #446, @davidhedley can you test the patch with your PDFs?\n. If ToUnicode is missing, can we just ignore `--space-as-offset 1` for that font automaticly? We can also add `--space-as-offset 2` to force it on even if ToUnicode is missing. However it seems impossible to detect whether ToUnicode or font encoding is corrupted.\n. For non-graphic-rich PDFs, the performance hit of `--correct-text-visibility` is neglectable, e.g. a 141-page middle school IT textbook, 37.535s(user time) with it and 37.861s without it. For graphic-rich PDFs, the performance hit is noticable, e.g. a 108-page middle school geography textbook, 1m56.841s with it and 1m34.782s without it. That is, increased 0.2s/page.\n\nSo I'm not very concerned about the performance currently, and would rather try to deal with the non-rectanglar path problem such as #405. An initial idea is: convert paths that are filled/stroked to clips in a hidden canvas, and test whether chars are in those clips. This would require more CPU power and need more optimization.\n. I have network problem to access your pdf. Can you create an issue [here](https://bitbucket.org/duanyao/pdf2htmlex/issues?status=new&status=open) and attach your pdf? And then link that issue with this one in two directions :)\n\n@coolwanglu In order to overcome the limitation of github's issue tracker, I created that repo on bitbucket as a supplementary issue tracker, because it accept arbitrary type of attachments. Anonymous users can also create issues there.\n. This pdf file has an issue: it maps ASCII space (32) to an arabic character, so if `--space-as-offset` is on, this character is replaced by a offset, which is invisible. The converted unicodes are wrong, so pdf2htmlEX has no way to tell this space is a real space or not.\n\nSo I think this bug won't be fixed, and you have to avoid  `--space-as-offset` on these files.\n\nP.S. this pdf can be obtained from [bitbucket issue tracker](https://bitbucket.org/duanyao/pdf2htmlex/issue/3/charaters-lost-in-space-as-offset).\n. Yeah, it is OK to me.\n. These bitmap is embeded in the svg via data: url, while the svg is refed by the html via `<img>`.\nIn this case, webkit doesn't show the bitmap, while Chrome (uses blink, a fork of webkit) works fine.\n\nThis is obviously a bug of webkit (https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99677). Because a fix is in progress in webkit, I think there is no need to add `--svg-use-object-tag`.\n\nAs a workaround, you can try `--svg-embed-bitmap 0`, and you must make sure the bitmaps in your pdfs are in jpeg format and in RGB or Gray colorspace.\n. > there is no way I can make sure that bitmaps used in pdfs are in jpeg format.\n\nYou can use Ghostscript or Adobe Acrobat to convert all bitmaps in pdfs to jpeg. Actually our team do this.\n\n`<object>` or `<embed>` are more expensive than `<img>`, because browsers create nested browsing contexts for them, so we use `<img>` where possible.\n. > how does it behave in case of transparent images etc\n\nConverted to soft marked images.\n\n> i had to embed svg, as single file \n\nI see, in this case `<object>` or `<embed>` must be used. Do your pdfs contain many drawings? If not, png background can also be used.\n. Because https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99677 has been fixed for a while, close this bug.\n. The problem in the first file (http://djvs.co/Untitleddocument.pdf) is caused by zero width space.\n\nThe PDF contains zero width space character (U+200B). This char by definition has zero width, but according to the font dictionary and embeded font file, its width is not zero, but 1 (means same as font size). This is not a problem in PDF, because PDF just treats zero width space as a normal char, i.e. respects the char width defined in the font dictionary or the font file.\n\nBut it seems that browsers _always_ display U+200B as zero width, no matter what width is defined in the font file. So in the output html file, characters after U+200B are shifted to left in comparison with the PDF.\nI don't know whether this behavior is defined by any web standards, it seems that [CSS Fonts spec](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-fonts/) says nothing about this.\n\nOne possible solution is, in `HTMLRenderer::drawString()`, append a offset of the width reported by `GfxFont::getNextChar` if we meet U+200B. However, if the font in pdf maps U+200B to a visible glyph, we still loose it after conversion.\n. @coolwanglu it seems not enough to just add ZWSP, it is a long list, see #488.\n. It is still unforturnate that all white spaces in this PDF becomes weird private unicodes after conversion. I think maybe we can improve this by checking the glyph before mapping a invalid char: if its glyph does not exist or is empty, map the char to a space, otherwise map it to a private unicode.\n. I think this is not a problem, the mapped spaces also have widths assigned, and CSS `word-spacing`s are calculated based on those widths.\n. Both normal spaces and zero-width spaces are mapped to normal spaces, if they all have no glyph. Note that in PDF, zero-width spaces are not neccessarily \"zero-width\", so it is reasonable to convert them to spaces.\n. Then some of the spaces will be wrapped in spans, with width assigned.\n. @hermesramos can you upload your pdf here so I can have a look?\nhttps://bitbucket.org/duanyao/pdf2htmlex/issues\n\nBecause many foreign web storage services are not usable in China.\n. @hermesramos you uploaded a html file.\n. I can convert the file perfectly with pdf2htmlEX, version 568dc8e65029097cae1aef84d902f5e1c311c35b of incoming branch.\n\nfontforge 's git version is 5f85fd7be65a0a198cd97376e79136e6482deb57\n\npoppler version is bc8076d8f638ccb44f8e3b94aaae96850b025deb\n. What browser you used? I've expericenced that firefox sometimes fails to load web fonts, restart firefox or rename the html file may help. If the problem persists, please upload the converted html.\n. Please upload to bitbucket.\n. Some fonts in the converted html are weired, some glyphs are stretched about 1 time taller. If your fontforge has same version as mine, I would guess some dependencies of fontforge caused the problem. Can you post the result of `configure` when you built your fontforge? \n. Some stretched fonts (JAGEOG+Arial-BoldItalicMT, JAGEOF+Arial-ItalicMT) in hermesramos's output have em size 1000 but same fonts in my output have em size 2048. @coolwanglu Do you have any idea why the em sizes differs?\n. @coolwanglu Yes, looks very much like #87 .\n\n@hermesramos Your fontforge has less optional libraries than mine.\nYours:\n\n```\n  cairo         check   yes http://www.cairographics.org/\n  giflib        check   no  http://giflib.sourceforge.net/\n  libjpeg       check   no  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libjpeg\n  libpng        check   yes http://www.libpng.org/\n  libreadline       check   no  http://www.gnu.org/software/readline\n  libspiro      check   no  https://github.com/fontforge/libspiro\n  libtiff       check   no  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libtiff\n  libuninameslist   check   no  https://github.com/fontforge/libuninameslist\n  zeromq (libzmq)       no  http://www.zeromq.org/\n  X Window System       yes\n```\n\nMine:\n\n```\n  cairo         check   yes http://www.cairographics.org/\n  giflib        check   yes http://giflib.sourceforge.net/\n  libjpeg       check   yes http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libjpeg\n  libpng        check   yes http://www.libpng.org/\n  libreadline       check   yes http://www.gnu.org/software/readline\n  libspiro      check   yes https://github.com/fontforge/libspiro\n  libtiff       check   yes http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libtiff\n  libuninameslist   check   yes https://github.com/fontforge/libuninameslist\n  zeromq (libzmq)       no  http://www.zeromq.org/\n  X Window System       yes\n```\n\nI built it like this:\n\n```\nsudo apt-get install autotools-dev libjpeg-dev libtiff4-dev libpng12-dev libgif-dev libxt-dev autoconf automake libtool bzip2 libxml2-dev libuninameslist-dev libspiro-dev python3-dev libpango1.0-dev libcairo2-dev chrpath uuid-dev python-dev\n\n./bootstrap\n./configure --enable-debug\nmake\nsudo make install\n```\n\nBefore you rebuild your fontforge, can you test it as follow?\n1. open your PDF with fontforge (by GUI or command line `fontforge INPDFViewer.pdf`)\n2. select font \"JAGEOG+Arial-BoldItalicMT\"\n3. open menu \"Element->Font Info->General\".\n\nWhat's the \"Em size\"? it should be 2048.\n. So it seems your fontforge can parse the font correctly. Then you can try to convert \"JAGEOG+Arial-BoldItalicMT\" etc. to woff format by fontforge, and check whether the EM sizes are changed or glyphs are stretched. \n\nP.S. Were your VMs created by yourself? how about download a prepared VM image like http://www.osboxes.org/ubuntu/ ?\n. If the problem persists, please upload your VM to MEGA (I can't access google drive or dropbox).\n. Maybe you want to add `append_padding_char()` before `append_offset()` to compensate the char counter.\n. Propbaly we don't have to avoid leading spaces, as chrome issue #404444 can be workarounded in CSS by adding a pseudo element at the beginning of a line. We can also remove `display:inline-block` for normal `<span>`s, to workaround negative word-spacing problem (#416). After this, #414 may be also removed.\n\nI just reinstalled my system, so the following patch hasn't been compiled & tested yet.\n\n```\ndiff --git a/share/base.css.in b/share/base.css.in\nindex a15a23f..3763301 100644\n--- a/share/base.css.in\n+++ b/share/base.css.in\n@@ -161,10 +161,13 @@\n   /* Workaround for https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35443 */\n   content: '';\n }\n+.@CSS_LINE_CN@:before {\n+  /* Workaround blink/webkit bug of word-spacing with leading spaces (https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=404444) */\n+  content: '';\n+  display: inline-block;\n+}\n .@CSS_LINE_CN@ span { /* text blocks within a line */\n   position:relative;\n-  /* _<id> for spaces may need display:inline, which will override this */ \n-  display:inline-block;\n   unicode-bidi:bidi-override; /* For rtl languages, e.g. Hebrew, we don't want the default Unicode behaviour */\n }\n .@CSS_WHITESPACE_CN@ { /* text shift */\ndiff --git a/src/StateManager.h b/src/StateManager.h\nindex a02a673..53493ed 100644\n--- a/src/StateManager.h\n+++ b/src/StateManager.h\n@@ -246,14 +246,14 @@ public:\n     double default_value(void) { return 0; }\n     void dump_value(std::ostream & out, double value) { \n         out << ((value > 0) ? \"display:inline-block;width:\" \n-                            : \"display:inline;margin-left:\")\n+                            : \"margin-left:\")\n             << round(value) << \"px;\";\n     }\n     void dump_print_value(std::ostream & out, double value, double scale) \n     {\n         value *= scale;\n         out << ((value > 0) ? \"display:inline-block;width:\" \n-                            : \"display:inline;margin-left:\")\n+                            : \"margin-left:\")\n             << round(value) << \"pt;\";\n     }\n };\n```\n. My patch keeps normal `span`s `inline` and makes spaces (`span._`) `inline-block`. Previously, all `span`s are `inline-block`, because of the strongest rule `.t span { display: inline-block;}`.\n\nIt seems `inline-block` doesn't introduce an extra newline while copied, e.g. \"Text\" in file `test/browser_tests/basic_text.pdf`.\n. `inline` itself has no problem with negative `margin-left` in all browsers, and blink/webkit also don't apply word-spacing to leading spaces of a `inline-block`( see http://jsfiddle.net/vxyqL3d1/ ). So I keep normal spans inline. \n\n`inline` does has problem in blink/webkit if it is empty and surrounded by spaces, e.g. \n`<div style=\"white-space:pre; word-spacing:1em;\"> Any thing here <span style=\"margin-left:-0.7em;\"></span> span begins with a space.</div>`\nOutput of this file has this problem: \nhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/blob/incoming/test/browser_tests/with_form.pdf\n.

Detecting empty glyph with freetype seems simple enough and should be much faster than actually drawing chars.\n\n> I feel that this patch adds too many states/variables, making the renderer even more messy. \n\nYeah, I also plan to simplify it a little in following days, especially in `drawSting()`.\n\n> Finally, could you also add a test case for this (maybe after we have no issues left for the code).\n\nThe sample file in #477 was used to test this patch.\n\nUnforturnately I found a problem in browsers, FF and webkit disagree with whether add letter-spacing around ZWSP:\n`<div style=\"font-size:30px;letter-spacing:10px\">M&#x200B;M</div>`\nThis means we can't output ZWSP if letter-spacing is not zero. Can we can just omit ZWSP in this case? it should be rare.\n. OK, I agree.\n. After some thought, I think most (if not all) \"illegal html unicode without glyph\" should be converted to a `<span class=\"_ _N\">&#x20;<span>`, because:\n- Browsers implement `letter-spacing` for ZWSP etc differently (should not apply, [FF and IE have bugs](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=253143) ), while implement `letter-spacing` for `inline-block` consistently (not apply at all). So converting an illegal unicode to a ZWSP + offset pair is not ideal.\n- In order to largely maintain the sematic, most illegal html unicodes should be converted to delimiters (space or something), not just empty spans. P.S. I think if `--space-as-offset` is on, at least one space should also be retained for each converted offset.\n\nIn order to accomplish this, `HTMLTextLine::append_offset(double width)` may be extended to `HTMLTextLine::append_offset(double width, Unicode char)`, means a char (in most cases a space) can be assosiated to the offset. This is called \"mixed offset\"\n\n`HTMLTextLine::text` field can also be extended to type `vector<HTMLTextUnit>`, and `HTMLTextUnit` is defined as:\n\n```\nstruct HTMLTextUnit\n{\n  HTMLTextState * state; // or int state, index of HTMLTextLine::states\n  int char_count; // corresponding to how many CharCode\n  Unicode unicode;\n  float width; // width of offset\n}\n```\n\nType of `HTMLTextUnit` is implied:\n- Normal text: char_count == 1, unicode > 0, width is NaN (means defined by font/state)\n- Pure offset:  char_count == 0, unicode == 0, width != 0\n- Mixed offset: char_count > 0, unicode == 0x20 (may be extended), width is not NaN\n- Repeating spaces: char_count > 1, unicode == 0x20, width is NaN\n- Decomposed ligature\n  - First: same as normal text\n  - Followings: char_count == 0, unicode > 0\n- Not in use: char_count == 0, unicode == 0, width == 0\n\nSome notes:\n- `char_count` can be used to sync with `CovertTextDetector`\n- Pure/mixed offsets may be merged during text optimazition, and `char_count` and `width` are added up. After merging, removed `HTMLTextUnit` can be marked as \"not in use\" (don't have to compact the vector).\n- <del>Large offsets may converted to \"repeating spaces\" during text optimazition</del><ins>no, this will invalidate char_count. Large offsets may be converted to muliple normal text units.</ins>.\n- `HTMLTextLine::offsets` and `HTMLTextLine::decomposed_text` are not needed anymore.\n. `DrawingTracer::update_ctm` traces `OutputDev::updateCTM`, and `OutputDev::updateCTM` provides us with the update to the CTM (which should be muliplied with CTM), not the updated CTM. This behavior seems not stated in poppler's document, but you can see `CairoOutputDev::updateCTM`, it is almost the same as `DrawingTracer::update_ctm`.\n. Some thoughts:\nI think integrating `DrawingTracer` codes into `TextPageBuilder` is feasible, and putting `bbox` into `CharNode` is good.\n\nHowever, I'd prefer one flatten array of `CharNode` for all chars in each page, rather than multi-level indirection (TextPage/TextSegment/TextWord/CharNode), because:\n- Most post processing algorithms (such as text visibility checking, layout analysis) are bottom-up and only care about individual char's properties, so this indirection is not very useful to them.\n- TextSegment/TextWord are built according to certain PDF drawing commands, but in many cases this is sub-optimal so we have `--optimize-text`. I believe an advanced optimization algorithm would unlikely rely on PDF drawing commands, and would rather build a new TextSegment/TextWord tree from bottom up by analyzing the array of `CharNode`.\n\nSo we can do this:\n\n```\nclass CharNode\n{\n  ...\n  TextStyle * style; // or int style_index, or merge TextStyle into CharNode\n}\nclass TextPage\n{\n  vector<CharNode> chars;\n  vector<TextStyle> styles;\n  vector<TextSegment> segments;\n}\n\nTextWord\n{\n  ...\n  int start; // starting index in TextPage::chars\n  int end; // ending index in TextPage::chars\n}\n```\n\nAnother question: what's the advantage of `boost::intrusive::list` over `std:vector` ? Inserting/removing nodes seems rather rare, because during post processings we can (and probably prefer to) just build a new tree and drop the old one. P.S. I don't think \"all hidden characters should be removed from the structure\", because we want to output transparent texts for them (at least for partially visible chars), so setting a flag on invisible `CharNode` should be enough.\n. > For example, if a char is removed (due to hidden by an image, or we decide to covert it to an offset), we need to find the word containing it and modify it accordingly. \n\nHidden char should not be removed, just marking it as \"transparent\" should be OK. Because text style is changed, the TextWord containing the hidden char have to be splitted, this seems complicated.\n\nI'd recommend this workflow to avoid such mess:\n1. Build an array of CharNode as well as an array of TextStyle while drawing a page.\n   -  (Optional)  Run CovertedTextDetector during the drawing, and mark hidden chars in that array. We may push more TextStyles into the TextStyle array and let hidden chars reference them.\n2. Do offset <-> space convertion/merging in the array of CharNode (implement offset as a special CharNode). Push more TextStyles if necessary.\n3. Iterate over the array of CharNode, and group chars in a same line (according to x/y coordinate) and with same TextStyle into TextWords, put those TextWords into an array. Push more TextStyles if necessary.\n4. Iterate over the array of TextWord, and group them into TextSegments, put those TextSegments into an array. Push more TextStyles if necessary.\n5. Travel through the tree, generate HTML/CSS codes.\n6. Draw background image, and draw hidden chars according to the array of CharNodes.\n\nSo we don't have to modify any TextWord/TextSegment/TextStyle but just build them, so iterator invalidation is not an issue.\n\nThis workflow is inspired by [PDFMiner](http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/python/pdfminer/index.html)'s layout analysis algoritm (which I had ported to C++).\n. > some characters are transparent as defined in PDF, and some are hidden due to overlapping. Shall we show both of them in HTML (transparently)?\n\nWe can add a flag to CharNode to distinguish them. However, it is quite hard to tell whether an char covered by an image is meaningless or not. It is also hard to tell whether an char is completely invisible -- what if the covering image is semi-transparent or clipped? So the safest way is to show all covered/clipped chars as transparent.\n. > std::list or intrusive list may be used to solve both problems, I wonder if there are anything we need from vector?\n\nContainers in STL are debugger friendly, I can view them in eclipse CDT or VC++, I'm not sure about boost. I'd also prefer index over iterator, because during debugging I always know the progress of a iteration by check the value of the index.\n\nVector's other advantages are memory alloaction/dellocation speed and less memory fragment, this may be important or not. If the data structure is not quite dynamic, vector is prefered.\n. > if we dump all the chars first, we need to store all the styles for each char, the combine them by comparing the styles again\n\nIf we store a pointer or index to TextStyle in each CharNode, we can compare the pointer/index first, which should be fast. At least CharNodes generated by a single drawString() call share a same TextStyle object. If we merge TextStyle into CharNode, we can also add a flag inicating \"has same style as last char\".\n. > And about inserting offset to connect words, actually it can be done by adding a field space_after in the class TextWord\n\nI think this can also be done by adding all possible offsets in step 1. If we find some offsets that are not needed when building TextWord/TextSegment, just ignore them.\n. I mean we can pre-allocate all possible offsets in step 1, so that don't have to insert offsets when we decide to merge words afterward.\n. When a char is to be appended to the CharNode array, unless we are sure that there is no preceding offset (e.g. \"e\" in \"Hello World\"), we always append an CharNode with \"offset\" type before that char (e.g. \"W\" in \"Hello World\"). If the width of the offset is yet to be determined, we can assgin 0 to it so that in following steps we can calculate the actual width.\n\nThere are quite a few chances that normal chars and offsets are converted to each other or even merged. E.g. illegal chars may be converted to offsets and further merged with surrounding offsets/whitespaces. So I think is would be convenient that both normal chars and offsets are represented by CharNode so the convertion/merging can be done in-place.\n\nAs to styles, I think TextStyle can be made immutable. If we want to change a CharNode's style, we usually push a new TextStyle object into the per-page array of TextStyle, and modify the CharNode's style pointer to point to the new TextStyle. Unused TextStyles are not reclaimed until end of the renderring of the page, but this should not be a big problem.\n. > We may convert chars to offsets, but when shall we covert offsets to chars?\n\nSome PDFs use offsets instead of spaces. We may convert an offset between words to a space (or an offset containing a space).\n\n> By modifying styles, usually I meant re-scaling the matrix as well as the font size, or tweaking the positions, and most of time this happens word-wise.\n\nBecause chars in a word have same style, we can only create a new TextStyle and update all CharNodes in the TextWord at once.\n\nIf the style duplication is really a problem, we can put TextStyle in a set instead of an array.\n\nP.S. is it possible to keep font size constant globally, and only change the matrix? As I suggested in #369 .\n\n> So char->offset means breaking a Word into two, and offset->char means merging two Word's into one.\n\nYou mean offsets can not live in Words? How about kerning?\n\nI think now it is difficult to discuss more details before really implement it, so you may do it in your manner.\n. \u4f60\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u7ed3\u679c\uff08 http://pan.baidu.com/s/1eQdB394 \uff09\u5df2\u7ecf\u5305\u542b\u4e86\u539f pdf \u91cc\u7684\u6587\u672c\u3002\u6211\u731c\u4f60\u7684\u610f\u601d\u662f\u6587\u672c\u65e0\u6cd5\u88ab\u9009\u4e2d\u548c\u590d\u5236\uff1f\u8fd9\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u5927\u672c\u5206\u6587\u672c\u88ab\u4e0a\u5c42\u7684\u94fe\u63a5\uff08`<a>`\uff09\u548c\u88c1\u526a\u533a\uff08`div.c`\uff09\u6321\u4f4f\u4e86\u3002\n\npdf\u7684\u94fe\u63a5\u91cc\u5e76\u4e0d\u5305\u62ec\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u8fd9\u662fpdf\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e5f\u88ab\u5e26\u5230\u4e86\u8f6c\u6362\u540e\u7684html\u4e2d\u3002\u6211\u80fd\u60f3\u5230\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\uff081\uff09\u7528js\u6765\u53d6\u4ee3`<a>`\u7684\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u4ee3\u4ef7\u662f\u5728js\u4e0d\u80fd\u7528\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u94fe\u63a5\u5c31\u5931\u6548\u4e86)\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u628a\u94fe\u63a5\u52a0\u5165\u5230\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6587\u672c\uff08`div.t`\uff09\u5185\u90e8\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e48\u505a\u6bd4\u8f83\u590d\u6742\u3002\n\n\u81f3\u4e8e\u88c1\u526a\u533a\uff08`div.c`\uff09\uff0c\u6211\u5df2\u7ecf\u5728 #423 \u5efa\u8bae\u53d6\u6d88\u3002\n. \u6211\u4e0d\u660e\u767d\u4f60\u7684\u610f\u601d\u3002\u4f60\u662f\u60f3\u8bf4\u8f6c\u6362\u540e\u7684\u6587\u672c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u591f\u597d\uff1f\u5177\u4f53\u662f\u54ea\u91cc\u4e0d\u6ee1\u610f\uff1f\n\u53e6\u5916\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u7f51\u9875\u5feb\u7167\u529f\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u7ecf\u8fc7PDF\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1f\n. \"\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u5e38\u597d\u7684\u6837\u5f0f\"\u2014\u2014\u201c\u597d\u201d\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u542b\u4e49\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u539f\u6765\u7684html\u5417\uff1f\u7531\u4e8ehtml->pdf->html\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u5fc5\u7136\u4f1a\u4e22\u5931\u5f88\u591a\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u662f\u5f88\u96be\u8fd8\u539f\u539f\u6765\u7684html\u7684\u3002\n\n\u4f60\u7684\u7f51\u9875\u5feb\u7167\u7a0b\u5e8f\u9700\u8981\u628a\u7f51\u9875\u5f15\u7528\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5185\u5d4c\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u6709\u4e2a chrome \u6269\u5c55\u5c31\u662f\u505a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\u7684\uff08 https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile \uff09\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e0d\u662f\u547d\u4ee4\u884c\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u5df1\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u3002\n. \u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u90ae\u4ef6\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6216\u8005 webmail \u5bf9 html \u7684\u652f\u6301/\u9650\u5236\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u6240\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6307\u671b\u590d\u6742\u7684 html \u90ae\u4ef6\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u90fd\u6b63\u5e38\u663e\u793a\u6050\u6015\u662f\u6709\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u3002\u6211\u770b\u5230\u4f60\u7684\u622a\u56fe\u4e2d pdf2htmlEX \u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u5728email\u4e2d\u4e5f\u6709\u5f88\u591a\u663e\u793a\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u4f60\u8bf4\u201c\u6548\u679c\u5f88\u597d\u201d\u5462\uff1f\n\n\u201c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u90ae\u4ef6\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u201d\u6050\u6015\u5df2\u7ecf\u8d85\u51fa\u4e86 pdf2htmlEX \u548c singleFile \u7684\u76ee\u6807\u8303\u56f4\u4e86\u3002\u6211\u8ba4\u4e3a\u53d8\u901a\u7684\u529e\u6cd5\u662f\uff1a\u628a\u4f60\u7684\u7f51\u9875\u5feb\u7167\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9644\u4ef6\u53d1\u9001\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u53d1\u9001\u5230\u7f51\u9875\u5feb\u7167\u7684\u94fe\u63a5\uff0c\u8ba9\u7528\u6237\u7528\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u6253\u5f00\u7f51\u9875\u5feb\u7167\u3002\n. Seems you are using an old version. Latest codes in incoming branch converts your file correctly.\n. Try `--optimize-text 1`, this option is supposed to convert offsets to `letter-spacing/word-spacing`.\n. We can adapt the text output codes in pdf2htmlEX to generate SVG `<text>/<tspan>` instead of `<div>/<span>`, this just requires modest effort. However, the benefit is also small, because a background image is still required (the output becomes SVG text layer + background image).\n\nIn order to output high quality HTML or SVG, we need to handle 3 things: texts/fonts, vector graphics, and bitmaps.\n- poppler + cairo (CairoOutputDev) is good at handling vector graphics and bitmaps, but handle texts badly (convert texts to graphics in output SVG).\n- pdf2htmlEX itself is good at handling texts/fonts, but lacks the ability to handle vector graphics and bitmaps (delegate them to poppler and cairo). This is the main reason why a output page is composed by a text layer and a background image.\n\nSo the situation is: In order to output high quality SVG without text/background separation, pdf2htmlEX needs to gain the ability to handle vector graphics and bitmaps, or cairo needs to gain the ability to handle texts/fonts.\n\nJust a thought: maybe it is better to fork `cairo_svg_surface` codes, and merge pdf2htmlEX's text/font handling code into it. As long as the public API of our forked `cairo_svg_surface` keeps unchanged, we don't have to touch `CairoOutputDev`'s code.\n\nHowever, pure SVG solution also has it drawback: resource consumption of browsers to render the output SVGs is not always bouded -- it can be very high for complicated PDF pages. This is why `--svg-node-count-limit` exists. I think it is still worth to keep a ablility to fallback to (SVG) text layer + bitmap background.\n. @hojuruku Thanks for metioning https://github.com/pramodhkp/pdf2svg . I didn't notice that PDF.js had been able to convert PDF to SVG, and the output looks promising. Sometimes I find that PDF.js renders PDFs more correctly than poppler + cario does.\n. That means we want to handle bitmaps ourselves (not by SplashOutputDev/CairoOutputDev)? If so, I'd suggest output SVG insead of HTML, it is actually simpler: `font-size-multiplier` will be unnecessary, and paths, clips, text strokes and masked images can be mapped directly to SVG counterparts. Thus, both SplashOutputDev/CairoOutputDev are not needed in most cases.\n\nIf the output SVG is too complex, we would still need SplashOutputDev, and delegate vector graphics to it. In this case, we need to correct the visibility of texts and bitmaps remained in the SVG layer like what we currently do.\n\nSo maybe we don't need CairoOutputDev anymore :).\n. So maybe doing all the SVG output ourselves is a more clean approch.\n. `--hdpi` and `--vdpi` affect size of jpg/png background images. You can also try `--bg-format svg --svg-embed-bitmap 0` to dump raw images in the PDF, this usually generate smaller output. See the man page for more info.\n. I'm not sure the rationale why `--zoom` doesn't affect sizes of background images, maybe @coolwanglu can answer you. Maybe some users want high resolution background images for mobile/pad because these devices usually have high resolution screens.\n. I know very little about SEO. Do you think it will be helpful to just change `<div>` used by pdf2htmlEX to more semantic `<hN>` and `<p>`?\n. pdf2htmlEX should be able to convert links in PDF to HTML links;. If not, you can file an issue.\n\nPDFs are not supported by all browsers natively (maybe never will), so if you want your PDFs to be reliably accessible on the web, converting to HTML is a good idea. \n\nIf you want to add more dynamic contents, you can always edit the converted HTML/JS.\n. I'm afraid I don't have necessary environment to do trial and error on SEO. If you can figure out why the output of pdf2htmlEX is not searchable by google, maybe I can improve it.\n. @KrishnaPG Thanks for the detailed suggestion!\n\nHowever, I would be suprised if search engines couldn't handle noise of span tags -- just removing these tags while keeping text nodes should produce correct text. Do you have any references on this?\n\nUsing `<hN>` and `<p>` instead of `<div>` and adding `<title>` are doable, however I'm not sure how to test the effect. If anyone can test, I suggest manually editing (or scripting if you can) the output of pdf2htmlEx and see what will happen.\n. @fmalina Interesting, thanks!\n@GarrettHartley can you try https://github.com/fmalina/transcript and see whether it makes difference?\n. It seems you are using an old version. Recent versions in incoming branch doesn't crash with your file. Also remember to update fontforge & poppler.\n. The latest release version is 0.13.6. Maybe you have to build from the source yourself.\n. Just FYI, there is a pending PR for Homebrew to update poppler and its dependencies (including pdf2htmlEX): \nhttps://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/pull/37280\n\nHowever I don't have a mac to test it.\n. You have to rebuild pdf2htmlEX after you installed a new version of libfontforge. Or wait for a new binary release of pdf2htmlEX.\n. Ideally a browser should never crash no matter what you feed to it; if it does, it is a bug of the browser. However, in practice complicated pages can cause a browser to run out of memory, and get killed. I don't think `--split-pages` should result in more memory usage. can you monitor the memory usage of your browsers?\n\n`-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch` uses more memory, and seems did cause crashes:\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/12665641/ios-browser-crashing-when-using-webkit-overflow-scrolling-touch\n. `-f N -l N` options can generate a standalone HTML for page N of a PDF.\n\nYou can also add necessary header/footer to each .page files generated by `--split-pages` yourself to make them complete HTML files.\n. I believe .page files should contain links.\n. Those links need some transform, because they are pointing to the ids of other pages, and they should point to the file names of other pages in your case. You can write a post-processing program to add header/footer to each .page files and transform links in them.\n\nP.S. What's the benefit of separated HTML file for each page over each .page files for each page?\n. As the error message said, see `config.log' for more details.\n\nIf the error is only a fontforge error, maybe it is better to ask at https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge .\n. Run `pkg-config --print-provides --cflags --libs poppler` to check whether poppler is installed.\n\nRun `make clean` and `make SHELL=\"/bin/bash -x\"` in pdf2htmlEX source dir to check the compiler command actually used.\n. It seems a problem of cmake, although I don't know why. Try to remove cmake's temp files listed in `.gitignore`, and re-run cmake. If the problem persists, check `cmake.log` file in the source dir.\n\nTo change installation dir, try adding `-DDESTINATION=<dir>` when running cmake (haven't tried myself). If you don't want to install at all, you can specify `--data-dir <sourcedir>/share` when runing pdf2htmlEX.\n. Did you find the root cause of the failing build previously?\n\nBy the way, you don't have to run `sudo make install` after a compilation if you haven't modified files under `./share` dir.\n. > So our question is, is there a way to figure out from the font embedded if the text associated with the font is bolded or not.\n\nThis can not be done reliably, because in PDF files, texts don't have properties like \"bold\" or \"italic\", instead it relies on bold/italic fonts. So best thing you can do is check whether there are strings \"bold\" or \"italic\" in a font name (open the dumped font files by fontforge).\n\nThere is also no concept \"underline\" in PDF, it is just a independent line. So there is also no underlined text in pdf2htmlEX-genrated html.\n. Use `--embed-font 0` to dump font files, or font files are embedded in the HTML file. See the wiki for more info (e.g. https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Quick-Start).\n\nOpen the font files by fontforge, open menu \"element->font info->PS name\", you will see the font name.\n. This is a bug of chrome/webkit, and has been workarounded by https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/pull/484/ . You need to update to the leatest release.\n. Try `--correct-text-visibility 1`, and read man for more info.\n. What do you mean by \"images\"? If you are referring to background images, use `--vdpi` and `--hdpi`.\n. PDFs usually don't have any information about tables (tables are just represented as texts and lines) ( [read this article for more info](https://blog.idrsolutions.com/2009/04/pdf-text/)), so there is nothing pdf2htmlEX can do. HTML class 'c' denotes 'clip' in pdf2htmlEX, which has nothing to do with tables.\n\nIf you want to recognize tables in PDFs, you'll need some [layout analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_layout_analysis) tools.\n. Are you using svg background?\n. What does \"screenshot image\" mean? For background images, use `--hdpi` and `-vdpi`.\n. Thanks for investigate this issue. Can you create a pull request for this change?\nAlso could you add some instructions on building for windows in the wiki page? I have little experience on it.\nhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Building\n. Can't reproduce. JS should have no effect on font in pdf2htmlEX.\nWhat browsers you tested with? How did you disable JS? \n. NoScript also block web fonts by default, and this is configurable (options->embeddings-Forbid @font-face).\n. Is this issue specific to Safari browser on MacOS? How other browsers on MacOS behave? Looks like a safari bug.\n. @josiasmontag Maybe you want to report this issue to Apple or try [webcompat](https://webcompat.com/).\n. I don't know why this is happening. However this problem only happens when the cursor is between two lines, not when the cursor is on a line, so you can still select text of multiple lines.\n. It seems this test file doesn't suffer from this issue:\nhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/tree/master/test/browser_tests/geneve_1564\n\nHowever I had a hard time to figure out the difference. Do you have any idea?\n. With SVG background image and `--svg-embed-bitmap 0` you can save images individually (only RGB or Gray JPEG bitmaps in PDF are supported now). But you need to animate the images in the SVG files, not in the HTML.\n. Build the recent source, and SVG should be enabled by default.\nhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Building\n. Feel free to comment if you have other problem.\n. Duplicated background images should be not very common -- though it is a waste when it does occur.\nI suggest you try `--bg-format svg --svg-embed-bitmap 0` and see if there are still duplicated images.\n\nIt should be not hard to de-duplicate background images in pdf2htmlEx itself. It may compute checksum of each generated background images and check if there is a duplicated one. Would you like to implement this feature?\n. Is a partially processed PDF useful for your user? If what you want is just a output size limit, I suggest \n1. Let pdf2htmlEx convert the entire PDF, make sure there is adequate disk space.\n2. Messure the size of the output, if too large, remove it and report error to the user.\n\nP.S. if the the output of pdf2htmlEx is much more large than the PDF file, it may be a bug. You may also try to [optimize the PDF](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Optimizing-PDF-Files) before feed it to pdf2htmlEx.\n. FYI https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/issues/148#issuecomment-166507332\n. I believe removing margins of background images reduces memory consumption of browsers. Why the margins are important to you?\n. If all you want is converting PDF to full page images, maybe poppler's [`pdftocairo`](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man1/pdftocairo.1.html) or pdfbox's [`PDFToImage`](https://pdfbox.apache.org/1.8/commandline.html) do a better job.\n. Can you attach the PDF directly in this issue?\n. What purpose do you want to achieve? Small images are not always less important than big images. In fact in some PDFs a big \"image\" may be actually a tiled one by many small images.\n. Run the follow commands to check the installation of poppler:\n\n```\nldd /usr/local/bin/pdf2htmlEX | grep poppler\nfind /usr/local/lib -name \"libpoppler.so*\"\n```\n. Thanks for reporting!\nI'm the author of `--correct-text-visibility`. Can you describ how those documents were broken? Charaters that should be visible are removed, or those should be invisible are shown?\nAre the clip areas' dimentions are similar or smaller than the charaters' in question? As I noted in the code, \"even if 4 corners of the char are all in or all out of the clip area, it could still be partially clipped\", I suspected this is the problem.\n. A single-page sample should be useful! You can also remove sensitive contents by some PDF edting tools like acrobat.\n. Maybe related: #520 . As indicated in that issue, you may want to turn off `--split-pages` for SEO.\n\nUnfortunately we have very little info on SEO currently.\n. Most PDF files don't have semantic information (except [Tagged PDF](http://blogs.adobe.com/acrolaw/2006/01/understanding_t_1/)), so it is challenging for pdf2htmlEX (and any pdf converter) to produce semantic output.\n\nWhat you need seems a [layout analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_layout_analysis) tool, and [pdfminer](https://github.com/euske/pdfminer) has [one for pdf](https://euske.github.io/pdfminer/#pdf2txt).\n\nOf cause it would be nice to incorperate some sort of layout analysis feature like pdfminer into pdf2htmlEX, so we could have both semantic and high fidelity output, however it may turn out complicated to do.\n. `--space-as-offset 1 --optimize-text 1` may help.\n. Please attach the pdf directly, thanks!\n. Converting output of pdf2htmlex to epub3 is definitely doable (we did that actually). Of cause you have to do some programing to generate the navigation document and the OPF.\n\nWhat epub readers are you targeting? I believe most epub3 readers are based on morden browser engines, and SVG produced by pdf2htmlex (via cario) should be viewable in browsers. Morden browsers support a mixture of SVG 1.1 and SVG 1.2 tiny, by the way.\n\nI think `unicode-bidi:bidi-override` is related to right-to-left scripts (see #595). Why it must be removed?\n. It seems the latest [EPUB3 spec](http://www.idpf.org/epub/301/spec/epub-contentdocs.html#sec-css-2.1) still forbids `unicode-bidi`. However if major epub3 readers accept `unicode-bidi`, I think it is not a big problem to violate the spec. If you must have the generated EPUB to pass a validator, you may dynamicly insert the `unicode-bidi` rule via JS.\n. @anteprandium I did convert output of pdf2htmlex to epub3, however it is not [fixed layout epub3](http://www.idpf.org/epub/31/spec/epub-contentdocs.html#sec-fixed-layouts). In my opionin, fixed layout epub3 is poor in page transition performance because each page is a xhtml file, and can not be easily viewed in browsers. Instead, I put all pages into one xhtml file and implemented custom page transition and fullscreen in JS, so these features are independent to epub readers and can be viewed directly in browsers.\n\nThe converting tool I wrote is JS code running in browser. It parses the output xhtml of pdf2htmlex, and generates OPF, navigation and content files, and packages them into epub using [zip.js](https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/zip.js). The output files of pdf2htmlex is also packaged as zip before converting. This tool is part of a commercial software and is not publicly available yet, sorry. If you don't have special requirements, maybe using [sigil](https://sigil-ebook.com/) to import the output of pdf2htmlEX is easier, as mentioned by the original post.\n\nThe params of pdf2htmlEX I used looks like (hope helpful):\n\n```\n#!/bin/sh\npdf2htmlEX --fit-width 800 --hdpi 200 --vdpi 200 --font-size-multiplier 10 --heps 0.5 --veps 0.5 --css-filename content.css --embed cfijO --bg-format svg --svg-node-count-limit 1000 --svg-embed-bitmap 0 --correct-text-visibility 1 --dest-dir $1.sout $1 content.xhtml\n```\n. A PDF file can't be read sequentially, and the output of pdf2htmlEX is not always a single file.\n. Buffering the entire PDF consumes more memory than necessary. What problem are you trying to solve?\n. No, pdf2htmlEX loads and processes one page of PDF one time, so the memory reqiurement for processing PDF is constant, not proportional to page numbers.\n\nHow do you generate your PDF files? PDF format is not designed for streaming, so you have to wait until a entire PDF is generated to start pdf -> html conversion.\n\nFor output streaming, I think you may use [tmpfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmpfs) to avoid creating physical files and use node.js [`fs.watch()`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_watch_filename_options_listener) to monitor the output file. I think you want the output to be a file rather than a stream, because the network connection may break in the middle and users want to retry in this case.\n\nHowever, currently pdf2htmlEX is not quite suitable for streaming-while-converting, because the html and css are generated after all pages of PDF are processed, and changing this is non-trivial (but possible).\n. Yeah, I am aware of the limitation of `--svg-node-count-limit` and `--force-png-background` can be a rescue. But I can't promise to implement this feature any time soon. Patch is welcome!\n\nP.S. pdf2htmlEX use poppler's cairo backend to produces SVG, so if the SVG background looks wrong, you can try poppler's `pdf2cairo -svg` tool to reproduce the problem and report it at https://bugs.freedesktop.org/ (under product poppler or cairo).\n. Please attach the PDF directly.\n\nThis may be due to that those characters' bounding boxes overlap slightly, so `--correct-text-visibility` thinks them should be renderred as image to achieve correct visibility. Maybe I should consider slightly overlapping characters not overlapping. However, this won't solve all bluring problems.\n\n`--bg-format svg` should avoid the text bluring problems, however the renderring difference between html and svg is usually still noticable.\n. \u8bf7\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u95ee\u9898\u7684PDF\u6587\u4ef6\u3002\n. \u4e71\u7801\u548c\u56fe\u7247\u4e0d\u663e\u793a\u4f3c\u4e4e\u662f\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bf7\u5206\u522b\u521b\u5efabug\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u5e76\u9644\u4e0a\u6709\u95ee\u9898\u7684PDF\u6587\u4ef6\u3002\n. `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .` to enable debug build.\n. Does this happen to all PDF files you tried or a perticular PDF file?\n. See if this helps: https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Troubleshooting-Crashes\n. That's because we must handle closed sub path in which case we loop back to the first point.\nThe actual index `j` should never reach `n`:\n\nhttps://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/blob/master/src/DrawingTracer.cc#L246\n\n``` C++\n            if (p == n)\n            {\n                if (subpath->isClosed())\n                    j = 0; // if sub path is closed, go back to starting point\n                else\n                    break;\n            }\n            else\n                  j = p;\n```\n\nDo you have a test case to reproduce the issue?\n. Oh I didn't know that there are paths which have only one point. You can attach PDF in this issue.\n. What do you mean by 'static'? You can provide a customized `pdf2htmlEx.js` via `--data-dir` option (https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Command-Line-Options ).. Searching \"themes.googleusercontent.com\" in this repo returns zero result. Maybe it is from a 3rd party lib or a browser extension. Can you provide the url to your converted file?. ",

In some cases, I have noticed that a non transparent background color can lead to generating one big image for each page. Do you know anything about this ? Do you consider it an issue ? I had as well been working a year ago on a custom approach trying to cut the background image in non-empty smaller images which would just be positioned absolutely. What do you think ? \n. @coolwanglu \n\nThanks for the long reply :) Could I have your mail to send you a link to some source ? \n\nI think visibility test is not the #1 priority. Most probably :  \n1) fixing the background issue which both increases the generation time and makes the page weight much bigger than required (best would be to be able to put the background color in CSS and have a \"per image\" absolute positioning / otherwise, a quick compare would help to reduce the file size as most probably a lot of background images will just be the same if it's only about the background color...)\n2) improving generation speed, (may be a lot improved by #1)\n3) testing fonts (at that time, I had a lot of pain with specific font issues), \n. That sounds nice. What I meant was: why not use the current tech which is able to display properly the text in HTML, and just render everything that is not text in SVG (as currently done for the background, nop?) ?\n\nSorry for the duplicate. So if I understand well, the issue is that you can easily output a page to SVG based on Cairo , but you can't easily remove part of the page (like text, for instance) and hence change what's rendered to SVG right ?\n. You can have a look at pdf2svg which does the same job as pdf2cairo but enables the creation of 1 SVG per page. I can try to work on this if you want. There's this very simple convertPage(PopplerPage _page, const char_ svgFilename) which seems especially interesting to me. The only question is if it is possible to pass our context currently used for the background (ie the page without _most of_ the text?) : \n\n```\npoppler_page_get_size (page, &width, &height);\n\n// Open the SVG file\nsurface = cairo_svg_surface_create(svgFilename, width, height);\ndrawcontext = cairo_create(surface);\n\n// Render the PDF file into the SVG file\npoppler_page_render_for_printing(page, drawcontext);\ncairo_show_page(drawcontext);\n\n// Close the SVG file\ncairo_destroy(drawcontext);\ncairo_surface_destroy(surface);\n```\n. Thinking about this, I was wondering why we don't move to a more \"Crocodocs\"-like approach. Why don't we output the background image we have to SVG thanks to Cairo ? It would really take us one step closer to the best approach possible, and also help reduce a LOT the background size as most of the time it may only be a color, a few vectors, and so on. \n\nHave you already seen this example ? https://github.com/wagle/pdf2svg/blob/master/pdf2svg.c\n.

    "Rafiot": "okay, I will try it out and let you know in case we have issues. \n. I just tried to compile the package without the explicit mention of the library in the binary package: \n\n```\n< Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, libpoppler27 (>= 0.20.3) | libpoppler28 | libpoppler43, libpng12-0, libjpeg8, libfontforge1\n> Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, libpng12-0, libjpeg8, libfontforge1\n```\n\nAnd it the library is automatically imported in the dependencies in the binary package with the version it has be build with (required anyway): \n\n```\nDepends: libc6 (>= 2.4), libfontforge1, libgcc1 (>= 1:4.4.0), libpoppler44 (>= 0.24.5), libpython2.7 (>= 2.7), libstdc++6 (>= 4.8), libpng12-0, libjpeg8\n```\n\nSo I would suggest to let dpkg deal with it automatically: as you enforce the version in the build dependencies (libpoppler-dev (>= 0.20.3)), it should to be safe anyway.\n\nAs we are at it, when building, dpkg complains about the (useless?) dependency on python-dev:\n\n```\ndpkg-shlibdeps: warning: package could avoid a useless dependency if debian/pdf2htmlex/usr/bin/pdf2htmlEX was not linked against libpython2.7.so.1.0 (it uses none of the library's symbols)\n```\n\nMaybe you could just remove it.\n\nThank you very much bot the great job.\n. In my case, it is required, as it is build on a system with libpoppler44 installed. Trying to install the package anywhere else will fail at runtime. \n\nIf you look at the package in the PPA[1], it is the same (the version of libpoppler installed in the building system is in the deps): \n\n```\nDepends: libc6 (>= 2.14), libfontforge1, libgcc1 (>= 1:4.1.1), libpoppler43 (>= 0.24.1), libstdc++6 (>= 4.8), libpng12-0, libjpeg8\n```\n\n[1] https://launchpad.net/~coolwanglu/+archive/pdf2htmlex/+sourcepub/3660881/+listing-archive-extra\n\nAll the dependencies listed here except libpng12-0 and libjpeg8 come from ${shlibs:Depends} (I just tried a build).

I will try it out tomorrow and tell you. \n. I just did it: if I remove png and jpeg, they are not imported in the dependency list. I don't know exactly why... But fontforge is.\n. sure, and done :)\n\nThank you! \n. okay, I will try it out and let you know in case we have issues. \n. I just tried to compile the package without the explicit mention of the library in the binary package: \n\n```\n< Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, libpoppler27 (>= 0.20.3) | libpoppler28 | libpoppler43, libpng12-0, libjpeg8, libfontforge1\n> Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, libpng12-0, libjpeg8, libfontforge1\n```\n\nAnd it the library is automatically imported in the dependencies in the binary package with the version it has be build with (required anyway): \n\n```\nDepends: libc6 (>= 2.4), libfontforge1, libgcc1 (>= 1:4.4.0), libpoppler44 (>= 0.24.5), libpython2.7 (>= 2.7), libstdc++6 (>= 4.8), libpng12-0, libjpeg8\n```\n\nSo I would suggest to let dpkg deal with it automatically: as you enforce the version in the build dependencies (libpoppler-dev (>= 0.20.3)), it should to be safe anyway.\n\nAs we are at it, when building, dpkg complains about the (useless?) dependency on python-dev:\n\n```\ndpkg-shlibdeps: warning: package could avoid a useless dependency if debian/pdf2htmlex/usr/bin/pdf2htmlEX was not linked against libpython2.7.so.1.0 (it uses none of the library's symbols)\n```\n\nMaybe you could just remove it.\n\nThank you very much bot the great job.\n. In my case, it is required, as it is build on a system with libpoppler44 installed. Trying to install the package anywhere else will fail at runtime. \n\nIf you look at the package in the PPA[1], it is the same (the version of libpoppler installed in the building system is in the deps): \n\n```\nDepends: libc6 (>= 2.14), libfontforge1, libgcc1 (>= 1:4.1.1), libpoppler43 (>= 0.24.1), libstdc++6 (>= 4.8), libpng12-0, libjpeg8\n```\n\n[1] https://launchpad.net/~coolwanglu/+archive/pdf2htmlex/+sourcepub/3660881/+listing-archive-extra\n\nAll the dependencies listed here except libpng12-0 and libjpeg8 come from ${shlibs:Depends} (I just tried a build).

    "sathomas": "Full context on [github](https://github.com/sathomas/3akai-ux/blob/docpreview/node_modules/oae-core/documentpreview/js/documentpreview.js), but the code itself is simple enough.\n\nEither:\n\n```\n$.ajax({\n    url: '/path/to/base.css',\n    dataType: 'text'\n})\n.done(function(response) {\n    var domNode = domNode || document.createElement('style');\n    domNode.type = 'text/css';\n    if (domNode.styleSheet) {\n        domNode.styleSheet.cssText = response;\n    } else {\n        domNode.appendChild(document.createTextNode(response));\n    }\n    var head = document.head || document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0];\n    head.appendChild(domNode);\n})\n```\n\nOr:\n\n```\n$('head').append('<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/path/to/base.css\"/>');\n```\n\nBoth will expose the bug in the stylesheet. Apparently, when Safari or Chrome (I haven't checked other browsers) retrieves the referenced style sheet, it converts all CSS selectors to lower case. You can see from the developer console that the server delivers the file with mixed case:\n\n![screen shot 2013-10-22 at 8 50 07 am](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1731910/1381130/fb0447e8-3b19-11e3-95a2-b6f0f19e863f.png)\n\nBut when the browser determines which selectors to apply, it's converted all selectors to lowercase, which again is evident from the developer console.\n\n![screen shot 2013-10-22 at 8 49 10 am](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1731910/1381232/4f4e1624-3b1c-11e3-8141-c2c2a1530b66.png)\n\nAs a result, even though the image has a class of `bi`, it's getting the CSS rules for both `.bi` and `.Bi` and the `top` property is getting set to `0` which, as the original screen shot demonstrates, places the image in the wrong place on the page.\n. I sure wish we didn't have to support IE9 (and IE10 once IE11 is released). Alas, that's not possible for us just yet. One change you might consider is adding a `1px` top and left border with a color of `#ccc`. Here's what that looks like in IE9 (the example on the right):\n\n![border-ie](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1731910/1448126/4d3c73c0-4252-11e3-8ff1-c332c43208be.png)\n\nAnd it seems reasonable in other browsers as well:\n\n![border-ok](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1731910/1448133/586d25b4-4252-11e3-8083-e35ed8624b50.png)\n\nIt's definitely not perfect, but maybe a decent compromise.\n\nHere's a [blog post](http://blog.sathomas.me/post/css-box-shadows-and-browser-differences) on the issue that you can reference if you like.\n\nStephen\n. Internet Explorer sure is painful. Unfortunately IE-only style sheets won't work for version 10 (and presumably version 11 which I'm guessing has the same implementation of box shadow). I haven't been able to think of an alternative to borders, but I'll do some more experimenting and maybe something will come up. \n. FWIW, the problem is definitely present in Chrome 31 on both OS X 10.9.1 and Windows 7. On both systems the display is identical. Interestingly, the problem is not present in Chrome 31 on Android 4.1. (Checking the latter on my cheap Huawei smartphone was definitely an adventure ;^)\n. @coolwanglu, you're definitely right on both counts:\n1. The `<span>` rule in `base.css` is the most problematic, as that will almost certainly conflict with other elements on a page. The suggestion to add a `t` class will definitely help.\n2. Adding a unique class to all of the CSS selectors will definitely increase the size of the styles. As a check, I looked at the [Scientific Paper](http://coolwanglu.github.io/pdf2htmlEX/demo/demo.html) example as something of a worst case. The total number of selectors in all three `<style>` blocks is 2292, so adding a 12-byte class selector to all of them (e.g. `.pdf2htmlex ' including the trailing space) will increase the file size by about 27,500 bytes.\n\nOTOH, there are some additional factors to consider:\n1. The total size of the example (without the unique class) is about 1.8 Mbytes, so adding the class only increases the total size by 1.5%. (For smaller and less complex documents, the increase would be a greater percentage.)\n2. Any good web server will be using gzip compression which reduces the absolute size of the files (including the additional class selector) by at least a factor of 2. (Even with compression, though, there would still be a significant increase, e.g. 14KB in the example.)\n3. There are some other rules in the `base.css` file that are fairly common in web pages (e.g. `#sidebar` or  `.loading-indicator`) and could well conflict with a larger web page.\n4. Even for the abbreviated classes that pdf2htmlex uses, it's impossible to know for certain that there won't be conflicts. I suppose the worst-case possibility would be a web page that wanted to display two translated PDF documents side-by-side. In that case nearly all the style rules would conflict.\n\nI can't read C++ well enough to assess how much extra effort it would take to add a command-line option to include (or not) an additional CSS selector, but if that's feasible, it might be the most straightforward way to deal with all concerns. (Well, it would at least leave the decision up to the implementation).\n. The change `.t span` is definitely a big help; it resolves the most obvious issues. I'm not sure I'd recommend a compile time option since, as you note, that wouldn't completely address the problem. The simplest approach might be to just post-process the css files by running them through LESS.\n. Although I haven't looked at the code, I can guess the reason for this. When the CSS scale transform is applied to content, the browser still uses the natural height (e.g. the height before zooming) when calculating the size of the elements. To counteract this problem, you can set the height (and width) explicitly. The approach we used is to set the width as a percentage (e.g. 50% zoom sets `scale(0.5)` and `width: 50%`) and adjust the `top-margin` of subsequent content. Implementation [here]((https://github.com/sathomas/3akai-ux/tree/docpreview/node_modules/oae-core/documentpreview).\n\nHere's the relevant code:\n\n```\nvar zoomPages = function() {\n    // keep track of how much margin for next page\n    var nextMargin = CONTENT_PAGE_SPACING;\n\n    _.every(pages, function(page) {\n        // only process pages that have content\n        if (page.$el) {\n            // Scale the page\n            page.$el.css({\n                'margin-top': nextMargin + 'px',\n                'transform': 'scale(' + state.zoomLevel + ')',\n                'width': 100 / state.zoomLevel + '%'\n            });\n            // Cache the extra margin that was added\n            page.marginTop = nextMargin;\n\n            // When zooming in(/out) one page, we need to move the following\n            // page down(/up) because the browser won't do it automatically\n            nextMargin = (page.height * state.zoomLevel - page.height) +\n                CONTENT_PAGE_SPACING * state.zoomLevel;\n\n            // Return true to continue to next page\n            return true;\n\n        } else {\n            // Return false to skip remaining pages\n            return false;\n        }\n    });\n}\n```\n. Me neither. Just guessing, but I think Homebrew cleans up everything on a failed installation. I'm hoping the problem can be reproduced with a standard Unix build when trying to use the latest poppler.\n. Full context on [github](https://github.com/sathomas/3akai-ux/blob/docpreview/node_modules/oae-core/documentpreview/js/documentpreview.js), but the code itself is simple enough.\n\nEither:\n\n```\n$.ajax({\n    url: '/path/to/base.css',\n    dataType: 'text'\n})\n.done(function(response) {\n    var domNode = domNode || document.createElement('style');\n    domNode.type = 'text/css';\n    if (domNode.styleSheet) {\n        domNode.styleSheet.cssText = response;\n    } else {\n        domNode.appendChild(document.createTextNode(response));\n    }\n    var head = document.head || document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0];\n    head.appendChild(domNode);\n})\n```\n\nOr:\n\n```\n$('head').append('<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/path/to/base.css\"/>');\n```\n\nBoth will expose the bug in the stylesheet. Apparently, when Safari or Chrome (I haven't checked other browsers) retrieves the referenced style sheet, it converts all CSS selectors to lower case. You can see from the developer console that the server delivers the file with mixed case:\n\n![screen shot 2013-10-22 at 8 50 07 am](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1731910/1381130/fb0447e8-3b19-11e3-95a2-b6f0f19e863f.png)\n\nBut when the browser determines which selectors to apply, it's converted all selectors to lowercase, which again is evident from the developer console.\n\n![screen shot 2013-10-22 at 8 49 10 am](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1731910/1381232/4f4e1624-3b1c-11e3-8141-c2c2a1530b66.png)\n\nAs a result, even though the image has a class of `bi`, it's getting the CSS rules for both `.bi` and `.Bi` and the `top` property is getting set to `0` which, as the original screen shot demonstrates, places the image in the wrong place on the page.\n. I sure wish we didn't have to support IE9 (and IE10 once IE11 is released). Alas, that's not possible for us just yet. One change you might consider is adding a `1px` top and left border with a color of `#ccc`. Here's what that looks like in IE9 (the example on the right):\n\n![border-ie](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1731910/1448126/4d3c73c0-4252-11e3-8ff1-c332c43208be.png)\n\nAnd it seems reasonable in other browsers as well:\n\n![border-ok](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1731910/1448133/586d25b4-4252-11e3-8083-e35ed8624b50.png)\n\nIt's definitely not perfect, but maybe a decent compromise.\n\nHere's a [blog post](http://blog.sathomas.me/post/css-box-shadows-and-browser-differences) on the issue that you can reference if you like.\n\nStephen\n. Internet Explorer sure is painful. Unfortunately IE-only style sheets won't work for version 10 (and presumably version 11 which I'm guessing has the same implementation of box shadow). I haven't been able to think of an alternative to borders, but I'll do some more experimenting and maybe something will come up. \n. FWIW, the problem is definitely present in Chrome 31 on both OS X 10.9.1 and Windows 7. On both systems the display is identical.

Thanks to @duanyao and thanks to a friend I think I have solved my issues. \n. Here are the steps I used.\n\nTested on a fresh and updated Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS x86_64.  \nInstall build tools.  \n~$ sudo apt-get install build-essential\nInstall and check dependencies.  \n~$ sudo apt-get install cmake pkg-config  \n~$ getopt -V  \ngetopt from util-linux 2.20.1  \nInstall dependencies to compile poppler.  \n~$ sudo apt-get install libpng12-0 libpng12-dev libjpeg62 libjpeg62-dev fontconfig libfontconfig1-dev  \nInstall poppler-data from sources.  \n~$ wget http://poppler.freedesktop.org/poppler-data-0.4.7.tar.gz  \n~$ tar zxvf poppler-data-0.4.7.tar.gz  \n~$ cd poppler-data-0.4.7  \n~$ make  \n~$ sudo make install  \nInstall poppler from sources.  \n~$ wget http://poppler.freedesktop.org/poppler-0.26.4.tar.xz  \n~$ tar xJvf poppler-0.26.4.tar.xz  \n~$ cd poppler-0.26.4  \n~$ ./configure --enable-xpdf-headers  \n~$ make  \n~$ sudo make install  \nInstall fontforge from sources   (coolwanglu fork).\n~$ sudo apt-get install packaging-dev pkg-config python-dev libpango1.0-dev libglib2.0-dev  \n~$ libxml2-dev giflib-dbg libjpeg-dev libtiff-dev uthash-dev  \n~$ wget https://github.com/coolwanglu/fontforge/archive/pdf2htmlEX.zip  \n~$ unzip pdf2htmlEX.zip  \n~$ cd fontforge-pdf2htmlEX  \n~$ ./autogen.sh  \n~$ ./configure  \n~$ make  \n~$ sudo make install  \n~$ sudo ldconfig  \nInstall pdf2htmlEX from sources.  \n~$ git clone git://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX.git  \n~$ cd pdf2htmlEX  \n~$ cmake . && make && sudo make install  \n. @duanyao - Is that title better for you?\n. @duanyao, please let me know if you think you can make the suggested changes for me to try out.\n\nThanks\n. Not sure I understand what you mean by div.c ?  My understanding is that it's not always the same div causing the glass effect.\n. Thanks.  Optimally, we are looking for a programmatic solution here as I don't have the option to do this manually, however, a programmatic solution to give options to the users may be workable.\n\nSo, do you believe that if this class 'c' is removed that it will resolve this issue of non-selectable text?  \nIs it only this class 'c' that would be causing these types of issues?\n\nI've tried manually removing the class 'c' in articles where this issue exists and It seems to mess up the formatting when it's removed unless you update the right div tag to remove that class and even then there is still formatting loss in some cases.\n\nI'm just thinking that we could offer to user to remove one class 'c' at a time and have them visually inspect result and if no help or messes up formatting then we would give the user option to try another class 'c' removal.\n. My observation is that when doing this it actually causes text to be removed versus just removing \"c\" from the class list.  Most of the manual tests I've tried with a variety of documents seem to allow text to be selected after just removing the \"c\" class from the div.\n\nNo changes\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/625867/4144491/c9f90c4e-33e1-11e4-93b6-751994460b96.png)\nthis text is not selectable  \nWith only the style=\"z-index:-1\" added to div (<div class=\"c x0 y0 w2 h0\" style=\"z-index: -1\") or added to the class (.c {border: 0 none; display: block; margin: 0; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; position: absolute;   z-index: -1;}:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/625867/4144496/0503cf68-33e2-11e4-943b-3c1b35fe4337.png)\nthere is missing content  \nWith only the \"c\" class removed from list (<div class=\"x0 y0 w2 h0\"):\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/625867/4144515/3c941258-33e2-11e4-95e2-1e6c5078f883.png)\nthe text is selectable\n\nSeems that the selective removal of the \"c\" class is solving most of our problems here.  Not sure I'm seeing much apparent value when the \"c\" class is being used.  Does this make any sense to you?\n\nAlso, I guess I didn't understand who your questions above were directed to:  \n\"So can we suppress div.c when --correct-text-visibility is on? Can we use CSS clipping when --correct-text-visibility is off? Or just get rid of div.c completely?\"  Seems like I decided to run with one of your ideas and it is working for me.\n. @duanyao, are you suggesting to selectively apply the above?  Reason I ask is because if you apply it globally as you have shown the result after doing so is all content is removed in all browsers.\n. @duanyao, that seems better, Thx!....I will retest with the 4 document examples I've been looking at and see how it all works out.  We support all the major browsers.\n. @duanyao, Everything looks fine now.  I think this a reasonable solution for us here.  Please let me know if it warrants a consideration for a pdf2htmlEX flag/option and thanks again!\n. Yes, for now we are exploring the \"hack\" results through some exhaustive testing.  Yes, I'm ok with leaving it open.  What I do believe is possible though in our case is an interactive solution where \"c\" class is the focus.  Remove one, consider output, repeat as necessary.\n.

As an update to this, I pre-processed that page with ghostscript first to embed fonts and clean it up.

These are all cases where the page has a rotation which is not being catered for in CairoBackgroundRenderer.\n\nThe solution is as simple as adding:\n\n```\n        int pageRotate = doc->getPageRotate(pageno);\n\n        if (pageRotate == 90 || pageRotate == 270) {\n                double tmp = page_height;\n                page_height = page_width;\n                page_width = tmp;\n        }\n```\n\nto `CairoBackgroundRenderer::render_page(PDFDoc * doc, int pageno)`\nThis fixes all the test cases in the example ZIP file I provided\n\nCould you include this fix in the next release?\n.

I have added the information below to the poppler bug report. I will have a look through the poppler code to see if there is an easy fix, as it doesn't look like anyone from poppler has looked at the issue yet.\n\n------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<\n\nAs an update to this, the error is in the matrix computed for the image mask.\n\nIn the SVG this is set to:\n\ntransform=\"matrix(0.00057971,0,0,-0.000407166,0,1)\"\n\nWhen it should be something closer to:\n\ntransform=\"matrix(0,0.35,-0.20,0,450,0)\" \n\nin order to get something like the correct result.\n. I have now tracked this issue to Cairo's SVG backend. The issue was first raised last year here:\nhttps://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=71861\n\nThere is a patch submitted on that report which fixes the issue in cairo 1.13.1\n. Yes looks good to me thanks\n. In fact, dot leaders seem to cause some layout headaches in general. Here is another test case:\n\n http://download.vistair.com/pdf2htmlEX/Page-12fromFDB-B737-QRH_nowatermark.pdf\n. Strangely, I can no longer reproduce these issues. I'm wondering if there is an interaction between remote desktop and Firefox that was causing the fonts to display incorrectly on my screen. I will re-open the issue when/if I can reproduce it.\n. From the command line, what does the following report?\n\n```\nldd `which pdf2htmlEX` | grep poppler\n```\n\nYou may need to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to include the poppler directory reported by the above command\n. I have also seen the issue of word-spacing not being correctly handled in Chrome/Webkit with leading spaces.\nMy current solution is to insert a U+200B (Zero width non-break space) character at the start of any text node with a leading space. Chrome will then handle the word-spacing setting correctly (it has no impact on Firefox rendering).\n\nGiven how differently different browsers interprest word-spacing, can we just avoid using it for adjusting the layout and instead explicitly space words if required?\n. There are still issues with word spacing on Mobile Safari even with the changes made in the `incoming` branch.\nSee for example: http://download.vistair.com/pdf2htmlEX/MobileSafariSpacing.pdf\n\nThe affected HTML is:\n\n```\n<div class=\"t m0 x0 h1 y5 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls1 ws1\">F2.3 <span class=\"_ _2\"></span> <span class=\"_ _3\"></span>Property <span class=\"_ _0\"></span>(including <span class=\"_ _2\"></span>Fire <span class=\"_ _0\"></span>Protection)<span class=\"_ _5\"> </span>1</div>\n```\n\nThe key is the sequence `F2.3[space]<span class=\"_ _2\"></span>[space]<span class=\"_ _3\"></span>Property...`\n\nChrome/Firefox etc collapse the 2 spaces and treat the text as `F2.3[space]Property` = 2 words with a single word space, however Mobile Safari is treating the 2 spaces separately and inserting a word-space between them which shifts everything else to the right on the line.\n\nGiven how inconsistent word-spacing is being applied between browsers, is it possible to avoid its use?\n. My current workaround is to convert the first space of a text node which begins with a space to a non-break space (\\u00a0). This corrects the issue on Mobile Safari. I haven't looked at how this affects Chrome/IE/Firefox. I will run some tests and let you know.\n. I have done some testing with this example, and replacing the first leading space with a non-break space means this page renders now correctly on Mobile Safari/Chrome/IE/Firefox.\n. `--space-as-offset 1` is sufficient for it to render correctly on Mobile Safari. This is Safari that comes with iOS 8.1. It says \"AppleWekKit/600.1.4\". I'm not sure how that relates to the base WebKit version.\nIs there a downside to using `--space-as-offset 1`? If not, shouldn't it be the default?\n. Having done some experimenting with `--space-as-offset 1`, it appears to have some serious bugs - I am seeing letters dropping out in the middle of words. I will try to get a test case tomorrow.\n. I will close this and re-open when I have a suitable test case\n. Actually I found the issue.\nThe background image that was generated was only 1px wide and in the HTML the CSS rule set width: 0.5px. \nIn Firefox the image was still rendered, but in Webkit the background image was not being displayed.\n\nYou might want to add a check to ensure the minimum height/width of the background image is 1px\n. You are right - it does not affect Chrome, it is just Mobile Safari that has the issue.\n\nAn example PDF is here: http://download.vistair.com/pdf2htmlEX/linetest.pdf\n\nThe line on the background image is not visible in Mobile Safari.\n. No it's different - it's purely a CSS/img style issue\n. I tried pdftocairo 0.24.5 and it lost some lines on the example PDF, but testing with pdftocairo 0.26.3, they were all present so I assumed this issue had been fixed.\n\nI didn't realise about the thinlinemode in pdftoppm - that seems like it would be the best solution. Does it really need to be an option or should we just set it to \"shape\" by default?\n. And in fact the thinlinemode produces a much better result. So in SplashBackgroundRenderer we just change:\n\n```\nSplashBackgroundRenderer::SplashBackgroundRenderer(const string & imgFormat, HTMLRenderer * html_renderer, const Param & param)\n    : SplashOutputDev(splashModeRGB8, 4, gFalse, (SplashColorPtr)(&white), gTrue, gTrue)\n    , html_renderer(html_renderer)\n    , param(param)\n    , format(imgFormat)\n```\n\nto\n\n```\nSplashBackgroundRenderer::SplashBackgroundRenderer(const string & imgFormat, HTMLRenderer * html_renderer, const Param & param)\n    : SplashOutputDev(splashModeRGB8, 4, gFalse, (SplashColorPtr)(&white), gTrue, gTrue, splashThinLineShape)\n    , html_renderer(html_renderer)\n    , param(param)\n    , format(imgFormat)\n```\n\nIs any reason why you would _not_ want to enable thinlinemode?\n. Actually the default for Splash is not strictly \"none\". From `SplashTypes.h`:\n\n```\nenum SplashThinLineMode {\n  splashThinLineDefault,  // if SA on: draw solid if requested line width, transformed into\n                          // device space, is less than half a pixel and a shaped line else\n  splashThinLineSolid,     // draw line solid at least with 1 pixel\n  splashThinLineShape     // draw line shaped at least with 1 pixel\n};\n```\n\nSo default behaviour is dependent on the Stroke Adjustment setting in the PDF. However I guess if SA is off, then nothing happens to thin lines and they get dropped which is not good.\n\nI'm doing some testing now, but it would seem that splashThinLineShape produces good results - much more uniform line weights than the \"solid\" setting.\n. I redone the image counting in setMimeData. Note there are some differences now:\n- images declared once and used multiple times will only count as one image.\n- setMimeData is sometimes called on images which don't make it into the output SVG (they are outside the clipped area), resulting in an overestimate of the number of images on the page\n\nNeither of these issues are particularly significant\n. OK but that might take a while as there are several changes in this patch and each will need a separate test case. Most of my own internal test cases are customer data and are not easily distributable in their current form.\n. As an update to this, `--optimize-text` is also broken in the same way - it should not make any changes to the text unless the character encoding is \"standard\". There are many subsetted fonts out there that use character 32 as a normal character and _not_ a space.\n. And also `--space-threshold` is similarly broken. We need a flag for the current font to say \"custom font encoding - leave alone\", and then skip `--optimize-text`, `--space-as-offset` and `--space-threshold` for characters in that font as they are breaking the output.\n. It is most likely Chrome being dumb and trying to use a \"ti\" ligature which doesn't exist in the font. \nThere are CSS rules to turn off this behaviour however they do not work in all cases (e.g. iOS mobile safari). The only robust solution to this is to process all text on the page and split up any potential ligatures.\n\nYou can either post-process the HTML files to split potential ligatures, or do it on the fly in javascript as follows:\n\n```\nvar ligatureMatch = new RegExp('([ft])([ftlibhkj])', 'gi');\nvar htmlMatch = new RegExp(\"[&<]\", \"g\");\n\n// Horrible hack to stop iPad from trying to use ligatures. We can't use\n// font-variant-ligatures:none as\n// this breaks the font metrics for Helvetica Type 1 font\nfunction fixLigatures(elem) {\n    if (elem.nodeType == Node.ELEMENT_NODE) {\n        var tag = elem.nodeName.toLowerCase();\n        if (tag != 'script' && tag != 'style') {\n            for (var i = 0; i < elem.childNodes.length; i++) {\n                fixLigatures(elem.childNodes[i]);\n            }\n        }\n    } else if (elem.nodeType == Node.TEXT_NODE) {\n        if (ligatureMatch.test(elem.nodeValue)) {\n            var newChild = document.createElement(\"span\");\n            var newText = elem.nodeValue.replace(htmlMatch, function(m) {\n                if (m == \"&\") {\n                    return \"&amp;\";\n                } else {\n                    return \"&lt;\";\n                }\n            }).replace(ligatureMatch, \"$1<span></span>$2\");\n            newChild.innerHTML = newText;\n            elem.parentNode.replaceChild(newChild, elem);\n        }\n    }\n}\n// call as follows:\nfixLigatures(document.body);\n```\n. I have seen several cases where getNumPoints() == 1 - i.e. there is only one point in the path (just a  \"moveto\") but the path is never closed. In this case the loop will execute at least once, reading garbage for the \"second\" point. Also in the simple case where the stroked path is just a rectangle, getNumPoints() == 5 but from that you are creating 2 bboxes - one correct one and one zero one (not a big issue as the second just gets ignored but it shows the logic is not right in the loop). You can see this by enabling DrawingTracer debugging.\n\nI do have a test case for this. What is the best way of getting it to you?\n. Also you do not need to do anything for a closed subPath - poppler has already joined up the path for you. From GfxState.cc:\n\n```\nvoid GfxSubpath::close() {\n  if (x[n-1] != x[0] || y[n-1] != y[0]) {\n    lineTo(x[0], y[0]);\n  }\n  closed = gTrue;\n}\n```\n. [l4.pdf](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/files/500496/l4.pdf)\n\nThis is a simple test case. The visibility test thinks the text is covered by the box when it isn't\n. Unlikely ever to happen. Lambda supported only Node.js, Java and Python. pdf2htmlEX is C++ and relies on a whole bunch of supporting libraries.\n. It is an error message from fontforge. You can ignore it. It will not go on for ever, only while it is outputting the problem font.\n. Yes it is entirely possible. Just search through the fontforge source and anywhere you see: `time(&now);` add: `now=0;` after it. You will then get identical binaries etc after each generation..

I am not sure how your system is architected - you are using poppler and Cairo in addition to your own code. Which component creates the SVG? It would seem that whatever is converting the JPGs to PNGs to embed in the SVG is doing the job correctly as the embedded PNGs are correct.\n\nWhen --svg-embed-bitmap 0 is set, you could simply take the embedded PNG format images and output them to separate files?\n\nSent from my iPad\n\nOn 2 Aug 2014, at 11:57, \"Duan Yao\" <notifications@github.com<mailto:notifications@github.com>> wrote:\n\nFurther reach show that PDF does treat CMYK jpeg inverted in contrast to most other programs.\n\nIf create a PDF from a CMYK jpeg file by acrobat, the resulting image dictionary has a /Decode [1.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 0.0] entry, which effectively invert all color components. pdf2htmlEX can dump jpeg in this PDF without problem.\n\nThe pdf in this bug report, in contrast, don't have such inverting /Decode entries, and the default ones are [ 0.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 ], which is an identity transform, so the dumped jpegs have inverted color.\n\nOn the other hand, if create a PDF from a RGB jpeg file by acrobat, no /Decode entry is presented.\n\nHowever, I can't find the statement in PDF spec saying that \"CMYK jpeg(or all format?) should be intercepted in inverted color\".

As an update to this, I pre-processed that page with ghostscript first to embed fonts and clean it up. The test case is here:\nhttp://download.vistair.com/pdf2htmlEX/Page-1fromTCX-B757-AFM-28A_nowatermark.processed.pdf\n\nOn the original file:\n\n```\npdf2htmlEX --process-type3 1 Page-1fromTCX-B757-AFM-28A_nowatermark.pdf\nPreprocessing: 1/1\nError: Cairo error: invalid matrix (not invertible)\n```\n\nResult = no text on page.\n\nWhen I try the \"cleaned\" PDF, I get:\n\n```\npdf2htmlEX --process-type3 1 Page-1fromTCX-B757-AFM-28A_nowatermark.processed.pdf\nPreprocessing: 1/1\nzsh: segmentation fault (core dumped)  pdf2htmlEX --process-type3 1 Page-1fromTCX-B757-AFM-28A_nowatermark.processed.pdf\n```\n\nOn different Linux system, instead of a core dump, pdf2htmlEX hangs forever.\n. These are all cases where the page has a rotation which is not being catered for in CairoBackgroundRenderer.\n\nThe solution is as simple as adding:\n\n```\n        int pageRotate = doc->getPageRotate(pageno);\n\n        if (pageRotate == 90 || pageRotate == 270) {\n                double tmp = page_height;\n                page_height = page_width;\n                page_width = tmp;\n        }\n```\n\nto `CairoBackgroundRenderer::render_page(PDFDoc * doc, int pageno)`\nThis fixes all the test cases in the example ZIP file I provided\n\nCould you include this fix in the next release?\n. OK will do. Thanks for the tip - I have very little C++ experience!\n. I have now done this.

I have added the information below to the poppler bug report. I will have a look through the poppler code to see if there is an easy fix, as it doesn't look like anyone from poppler has looked at the issue yet.\n\n------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<\n\nAs an update to this, the error is in the matrix computed for the image mask.\n\nIn the SVG this is set to:\n\ntransform=\"matrix(0.00057971,0,0,-0.000407166,0,1)\"\n\nWhen it should be something closer to:\n\ntransform=\"matrix(0,0.35,-0.20,0,450,0)\" \n\nin order to get something like the correct result.\n. I have now tracked this issue to Cairo's SVG backend. The issue was first raised last year here:\nhttps://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=71861\n\nThere is a patch submitted on that report which fixes the issue in cairo 1.13.1\n. Yes looks good to me thanks\n. In fact, dot leaders seem to cause some layout headaches in general. Here is another test case:\n\n http://download.vistair.com/pdf2htmlEX/Page-12fromFDB-B737-QRH_nowatermark.pdf\n. Strangely, I can no longer reproduce these issues. I'm wondering if there is an interaction between remote desktop and Firefox that was causing the fonts to display incorrectly on my screen. I will re-open the issue when/if I can reproduce it.\n. From the command line, what does the following report?\n\n```\nldd `which pdf2htmlEX` | grep poppler\n```\n\nYou may need to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to include the poppler directory reported by the above command\n. I have also seen the issue of word-spacing not being correctly handled in Chrome/Webkit with leading spaces.\nMy current solution is to insert a U+200B (Zero width non-break space) character at the start of any text node with a leading space. Chrome will then handle the word-spacing setting correctly (it has no impact on Firefox rendering).\n\nGiven how differently different browsers interprest word-spacing, can we just avoid using it for adjusting the layout and instead explicitly space words if required?\n. There are still issues with word spacing on Mobile Safari even with the changes made in the `incoming` branch.\nSee for example: http://download.vistair.com/pdf2htmlEX/MobileSafariSpacing.pdf\n\nThe affected HTML is:\n\n```\n<div class=\"t m0 x0 h1 y5 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls1 ws1\">F2.3 <span class=\"_ _2\"></span> <span class=\"_ _3\"></span>Property <span class=\"_ _0\"></span>(including <span class=\"_ _2\"></span>Fire <span class=\"_ _0\"></span>Protection)<span class=\"_ _5\"> </span>1</div>\n```\n\nThe key is the sequence `F2.3[space]<span class=\"_ _2\"></span>[space]<span class=\"_ _3\"></span>Property...`\n\nChrome/Firefox etc collapse the 2 spaces and treat the text as `F2.3[space]Property` = 2 words with a single word space, however Mobile Safari is treating the 2 spaces separately and inserting a word-space between them which shifts everything else to the right on the line.\n\nGiven how inconsistent word-spacing is being applied between browsers, is it possible to avoid its use?\n. My current workaround is to convert the first space of a text node which begins with a space to a non-break space (\\u00a0). This corrects the issue on Mobile Safari. I haven't looked at how this affects Chrome/IE/Firefox. I will run some tests and let you know.\n. I have done some testing with this example, and replacing the first leading space with a non-break space means this page renders now correctly on Mobile Safari/Chrome/IE/Firefox.\n. `--space-as-offset 1` is sufficient for it to render correctly on Mobile Safari. This is Safari that comes with iOS 8.1. It says \"AppleWekKit/600.1.4\". I'm not sure how that relates to the base WebKit version.\nIs there a downside to using `--space-as-offset 1`? If not, shouldn't it be the default?\n. Having done some experimenting with `--space-as-offset 1`, it appears to have some serious bugs - I am seeing letters dropping out in the middle of words. I will try to get a test case tomorrow.\n. I will close this and re-open when I have a suitable test case\n. Actually I found the issue.\nThe background image that was generated was only 1px wide and in the HTML the CSS rule set width: 0.5px. \nIn Firefox the image was still rendered, but in Webkit the background image was not being displayed.\n\nYou might want to add a check to ensure the minimum height/width of the background image is 1px\n. You are right - it does not affect Chrome, it is just Mobile Safari that has the issue.\n\nAn example PDF is here: http://download.vistair.com/pdf2htmlEX/linetest.pdf\n\nThe line on the background image is not visible in Mobile Safari.\n. No it's different - it's purely a CSS/img style issue\n. I tried pdftocairo 0.24.5 and it lost some lines on the example PDF, but testing with pdftocairo 0.26.3, they were all present so I assumed this issue had been fixed.\n\nI didn't realise about the thinlinemode in pdftoppm - that seems like it would be the best solution. Does it really need to be an option or should we just set it to \"shape\" by default?\n. And in fact the thinlinemode produces a much better result. So in SplashBackgroundRenderer we just change:\n\n```\nSplashBackgroundRenderer::SplashBackgroundRenderer(const string & imgFormat, HTMLRenderer * html_renderer, const Param & param)\n    : SplashOutputDev(splashModeRGB8, 4, gFalse, (SplashColorPtr)(&white), gTrue, gTrue)\n    , html_renderer(html_renderer)\n    , param(param)\n    , format(imgFormat)\n```\n\nto\n\n```\nSplashBackgroundRenderer::SplashBackgroundRenderer(const string & imgFormat, HTMLRenderer * html_renderer, const Param & param)\n    : SplashOutputDev(splashModeRGB8, 4, gFalse, (SplashColorPtr)(&white), gTrue, gTrue, splashThinLineShape)\n    , html_renderer(html_renderer)\n    , param(param)\n    , format(imgFormat)\n```\n\nIs any reason why you would _not_ want to enable thinlinemode?\n. Actually the default for Splash is not strictly \"none\". From `SplashTypes.h`:\n\n```\nenum SplashThinLineMode {\n  splashThinLineDefault,  // if SA on: draw solid if requested line width, transformed into\n                          // device space, is less than half a pixel and a shaped line else\n  splashThinLineSolid,     // draw line solid at least with 1 pixel\n  splashThinLineShape     // draw line shaped at least with 1 pixel\n};\n```\n\nSo default behaviour is dependent on the Stroke Adjustment setting in the PDF. However I guess if SA is off, then nothing happens to thin lines and they get dropped which is not good.\n\nI'm doing some testing now, but it would seem that splashThinLineShape produces good results - much more uniform line weights than the \"solid\" setting.\n. I redone the image counting in setMimeData. Note there are some differences now:\n- images declared once and used multiple times will only count as one image.\n- setMimeData is sometimes called on images which don't make it into the output SVG (they are outside the clipped area), resulting in an overestimate of the number of images on the page\n\nNeither of these issues are particularly significant\n. OK but that might take a while as there are several changes in this patch and each will need a separate test case. Most of my own internal test cases are customer data and are not easily distributable in their current form.\n. As an update to this, `--optimize-text` is also broken in the same way - it should not make any changes to the text unless the character encoding is \"standard\". There are many subsetted fonts out there that use character 32 as a normal character and _not_ a space.\n. And also `--space-threshold` is similarly broken. We need a flag for the current font to say \"custom font encoding - leave alone\", and then skip `--optimize-text`, `--space-as-offset` and `--space-threshold` for characters in that font as they are breaking the output.\n. It is most likely Chrome being dumb and trying to use a \"ti\" ligature which doesn't exist in the font. \nThere are CSS rules to turn off this behaviour however they do not work in all cases (e.g. iOS mobile safari). The only robust solution to this is to process all text on the page and split up any potential ligatures.\n\nYou can either post-process the HTML files to split potential ligatures, or do it on the fly in javascript as follows:\n\n```\nvar ligatureMatch = new RegExp('([ft])([ftlibhkj])', 'gi');\nvar htmlMatch = new RegExp(\"[&<]\", \"g\");\n\n// Horrible hack to stop iPad from trying to use ligatures. We can't use\n// font-variant-ligatures:none as\n// this breaks the font metrics for Helvetica Type 1 font\nfunction fixLigatures(elem) {\n    if (elem.nodeType == Node.ELEMENT_NODE) {\n        var tag = elem.nodeName.toLowerCase();\n        if (tag != 'script' && tag != 'style') {\n            for (var i = 0; i < elem.childNodes.length; i++) {\n                fixLigatures(elem.childNodes[i]);\n            }\n        }\n    } else if (elem.nodeType == Node.TEXT_NODE) {\n        if (ligatureMatch.test(elem.nodeValue)) {\n            var newChild = document.createElement(\"span\");\n            var newText = elem.nodeValue.replace(htmlMatch, function(m) {\n                if (m == \"&\") {\n                    return \"&amp;\";\n                } else {\n                    return \"&lt;\";\n                }\n            }).replace(ligatureMatch, \"$1<span></span>$2\");\n            newChild.innerHTML = newText;\n            elem.parentNode.replaceChild(newChild, elem);\n        }\n    }\n}\n// call as follows:\nfixLigatures(document.body);\n```\n. I have seen several cases where getNumPoints() == 1 - i.e. there is only one point in the path (just a  \"moveto\") but the path is never closed. In this case the loop will execute at least once, reading garbage for the \"second\" point. Also in the simple case where the stroked path is just a rectangle, getNumPoints() == 5 but from that you are creating 2 bboxes - one correct one and one zero one (not a big issue as the second just gets ignored but it shows the logic is not right in the loop). You can see this by enabling DrawingTracer debugging.\n\nI do have a test case for this. What is the best way of getting it to you?\n. Also you do not need to do anything for a closed subPath - poppler has already joined up the path for you. From GfxState.cc:\n\n```\nvoid GfxSubpath::close() {\n  if (x[n-1] != x[0] || y[n-1] != y[0]) {\n    lineTo(x[0], y[0]);\n  }\n  closed = gTrue;\n}\n```\n. [l4.pdf](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/files/500496/l4.pdf)\n\nThis is a simple test case. The visibility test thinks the text is covered by the box when it isn't\n. Unlikely ever to happen. Lambda supported only Node.js, Java and Python. pdf2htmlEX is C++ and relies on a whole bunch of supporting libraries.\n. It is an error message from fontforge. You can ignore it. It will not go on for ever, only while it is outputting the problem font.\n. Yes it is entirely possible. Just search through the fontforge source and anywhere you see: `time(&now);` add: `now=0;` after it. You will then get identical binaries etc after each generation.. ",

However, I have not figure out how to tackle to this issue. If I find a solution, I will post back here.\n. Were you able to test latest fontforge? I was able to remove undefined reference to GetACP in libiconv by getting the source and commenting out the lines reference GetACP, which is only used for Cygwin. \n. I was able to get Pdf2htmlEx to build with the pdf2htmlex incoming branch. I followed the directions here http://marc-sanfacon.blogspot.com/2014_02_01_archive.html by adding all of the programs. Then I edited the CmakeLists.txt to add the dependencies (libraries) as stated in the blog.\n. I have been using fontforge-master, which should be the latest https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge. \n.

Will try another fontforge build to see if that clears up anything with pdf2htmlEx.\n. @coolwanglu, I still haven't been able to resolve these errors I listed at the top. Are these errors resulting from fontforge library calls or another library/code that pdf2htmlEx program is using?\n\nBasically, I am stuck at how to resolve the following errors whenever I tried to run any of your examples.\n\n```\nInternal Error: Attempt to output 2147483647 into a 16-bit field.

So I put some cerr in the code to see where the errors are happening and it seems on the call `doc->displayPage()` in `HTMLRenderer.process()` in general.cc. This call is on poppler PDFDoc object yet the error seems to be related to fontforge and not poppler. So I am even more confused what is causing the error since there is no fontforge code call and poppler doesn't throw such errors.\n. Oh ok.\n. @coolwanglu  Where can I get a 2013 snapshot of fontforge? I want to see if the issue I am having is with the current snapshot as the 2013 version is known to work with pdf2htmlEx version 11. I am going to build version 11 too to see if it is simply newer versions of fontforge and pdf2htmlEx that is causing issues in my environment. Thanks.\n. Thanks, that is what I am doing. I am trying to patch 2013 to get it to compile and then test with Pdf2htmlEx. Hopefully it will work since a pre-built version was working on a computer with similar environment (Windows 7 64bit).\n. @coolwanglu So I tried 2013 fontforge version with pdf2html-incoming and I still get the same errors.

I guess that's where I'm hung up.  Is there another way to link to it?\n. That seemed to work, it took some hacking unfortunately, so I'm pretty sure that I've got something in the wrong place.  Maybe this is a clue.  \n\n@duanyao, the version of fontforge I used is the one that's in the build instructions, so I'm puzzled as to why that commit isn't the right one.  I tried installing with --HEAD previously, but ran into other problems.\n\nI'm still going to keep working on this, I might try installing on OSX.\n\ndaniel@dho-miner2:~/pdf2htmlEX$ make clean\ndaniel@dho-miner2:~/pdf2htmlEX$ sudo cmake . && make && sudo make install\n-- Configuring done\n-- Generating done\n-- Build files have been written to: /home/daniel/pdf2htmlEX\nBuilding CXX object CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/pdf2htmlEX.cc.o\nBuilding CXX object CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/HTMLRenderer/draw.cc.o\nBuilding CXX object CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/HTMLRenderer/general.cc.o\nBuilding CXX object CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/HTMLRenderer/image.cc.o\nBuilding CXX object CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/HTMLRenderer/font.cc.o\nBuilding CXX object CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/HTMLRenderer/link.cc.o\nBuilding CXX object CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/HTMLRenderer/outline.cc.o\nBuilding CXX object CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/HTMLRenderer/state.cc.o\nBuilding CXX object CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/HTMLRenderer/text.cc.o\nBuilding CXX object CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/BackgroundRenderer/BackgroundRenderer.cc.o\nBuilding CXX object CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/BackgroundRenderer/SplashBackgroundRenderer.cc.o\nBuilding CXX object CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/BackgroundRenderer/CairoBackgroundRenderer.cc.o\nBuilding CXX object CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/util/const.cc.o\nBuilding CXX object CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/util/encoding.cc.o\nBuilding C object CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/util/ffw.c.o\nBuilding CXX object CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/util/math.cc.o\nBuilding CXX object CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/util/misc.cc.o\nBuilding CXX object CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/util/path.cc.o\nBuilding CXX object CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/util/unicode.cc.o\n/home/daniel/pdf2htmlEX/src/util/unicode.cc: In function \u2018Unicode pdf2htmlEX::unicode_from_font(CharCode, GfxFont_)\u2019:\n/home/daniel/pdf2htmlEX/src/util/unicode.cc:125:40: error: \u2018class GlobalParams\u2019 has no member named \u2018mapNameToUnicodeText\u2019\n             Unicode ou = globalParams->mapNameToUnicodeText(cname);\n                                        ^\nmake[2]: *_\\* [CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/util/unicode.cc.o] Error 1\nmake[1]: **\\* [CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/all] Error 2\nmake: **\\* [all] Error 2\n. @duanyao -- I see here (https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/issues/374 ) that the clone of the fontforge fork could be giving me the wrong version.

I was just looking around on the web some more and I came across this blog post... http://blog.framebench.com/our-love-for-open-source/ I tried it with little hope... but presto... it works!!  I ran one test doc... we'll see if it continues to work out... I'm not sure why it does, looks like it's a older version of fontforge, and of pdf2htmlEX.  \n\ndaniel@dho-miner2:~/pdf2htmlEX$ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:coolwanglu/pdf2htmlex\n[sudo] password for

I did. I even tried updating a few. But my centOS 'yum install' packages are all pretty old. So I'm manually updating.Because of that every now and then I'm getting path variable errors since manual installation goes to usr/local/bin and yum install will install it in usr/bin. I'll get back once I've checked everything. \n.

I need a name for the UCS-4 encoding and I can't find one. Reconfigure --without-iconv. Bye._\n\nI didn't find a way, to get static builds work.\n. It's a little bit tricky. First of all you have to verify, that all dependencies are available as static libraries (fontforge, poppler, libjpeg, ...). As there is no built in possibility to make it static, you have to find out the linker call. For this you compile pdf2htmlEX as usual. When it's done, you remove only the generated pdf2htmlEX executable so it is relinked, when you call make again.

Unfortunatly it's not possible anymore with the newer fontforge versions as of the mentioned iconv issue. But cou can make a dynamic linked build and ship all needed libraries and call the executable via your ld-linux.so. Or you could use tools like http://appimage.org/. I tried to make static builds for quite a long time. Until v0.11 it worked because an older version of fontforge could be used, where character conversions were done by internal functions. Since v0.12 newer fontforge versions are needed, which uses only glibc's iconv. And iconv dynamically loads the libraries of the encodings. So if you manage to build a static version of pdf2htmlEX and you want to run it, you get an error message like:\n\n_I can't figure out your version of iconv(). I need a name for the UCS-4 encoding and I can't find one. Reconfigure --without-iconv. Bye._\n\nI didn't find a way, to get static builds work.\n. It's a little bit tricky. First of all you have to verify, that all dependencies are available as static libraries (fontforge, poppler, libjpeg, ...). As there is no built in possibility to make it static, you have to find out the linker call. For this you compile pdf2htmlEX as usual. When it's done, you remove only the generated pdf2htmlEX executable so it is relinked, when you call make again. Now you call make in Verbose mode: `VERBOSE=1 make`\nNow there should be a line starting with `/usr/bin/c++` (depending on the linker you are using, but usually with gcc this should be the command). Now you take this line and add `-static` as extra parameter and every needed library added with `-llibrary-name`. You also have to find out the correct ordering of the libraries. For example my line was first\n\n``` bash\n/usr/bin/c++    -Wall -std=c++0x -O2 -DNDEBUG    CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/3rdparty/poppler/git/CairoFontEngine.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/3rdparty/poppler/git/CairoRescaleBox.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/3rdparty/poppler/git/CairoOutputDev.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/pdf2htmlEX.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/HTMLRenderer/draw.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/HTMLRenderer/general.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/HTMLRenderer/image.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/HTMLRenderer/font.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/HTMLRenderer/form.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/HTMLRenderer/link.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/HTMLRenderer/outline.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/HTMLRenderer/state.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/HTMLRenderer/text.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/BackgroundRenderer/BackgroundRenderer.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/BackgroundRenderer/SplashBackgroundRenderer.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/BackgroundRenderer/CairoBackgroundRenderer.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/util/const.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/util/encoding.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/util/ffw.c.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/util/math.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/util/misc.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/util/path.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/util/unicode.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/util/mingw.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/ArgParser.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/Base64Stream.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/Color.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/CoveredTextDetector.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/DrawingTracer.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/HTMLTextLine.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/HTMLTextPage.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/Preprocessor.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/StringFormatter.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/TmpFiles.cc.o  -o pdf2htmlEX -rdynamic -L/usr/local/lib -lpoppler -lcairo -lfreetype -lfontforge -static -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/lib:\n```\n\nFinally it was something like\n\n``` bash\n/usr/bin/g++    -Wall -std=c++0x -O2 -DNDEBUG   CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/3rdparty/poppler/git/CairoFontEngine.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/3rdparty/poppler/git/CairoRescaleBox.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/3rdparty/poppler/git/CairoOutputDev.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/pdf2htmlEX.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/HTMLRenderer/draw.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/HTMLRenderer/general.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/HTMLRenderer/image.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/HTMLRenderer/font.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/HTMLRenderer/form.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/HTMLRenderer/link.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/HTMLRenderer/outline.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/HTMLRenderer/state.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/HTMLRenderer/text.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/BackgroundRenderer/BackgroundRenderer.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/BackgroundRenderer/SplashBackgroundRenderer.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/BackgroundRenderer/CairoBackgroundRenderer.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/util/const.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/util/encoding.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/util/ffw.c.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/util/math.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/util/misc.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/util/path.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/util/unicode.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/util/mingw.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/ArgParser.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/Base64Stream.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/Color.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/CoveredTextDetector.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/DrawingTracer.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/HTMLTextLine.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/HTMLTextPage.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/Preprocessor.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/StringFormatter.cc.o CMakeFiles/pdf2htmlEX.dir/src/TmpFiles.cc.o  -o pdf2htmlEX -rdynamic -lpoppler -lcairo -lfreetype -lfontforge -llcms2 -lgunicode -lgutils -lz -lxml2 -lfontconfig -lopenjpeg -ljpeg -lpng -ltiff -lpixman-1 -lbz2 -lltdl -lgif -lreadline -luninameslist -lgio-2.0 -lgutils   -lglib-2.0 -lgobject-2.0 -lglib-2.0 -lgobject-2.0  -lpthread -lrt -lz -lfreetype -lexpat -ldl -lncurses -lgmodule-2.0 -lresolv -lffi -lglib-2.0  -static\n```\n\nAnd as I already mentioned: even if you manage to link it as static binary, I don't think it will succesfully convert a pdf because of the iconv issue in fontforge.\n.

This is then mapped back to 0x20, and this collides with the very first character in the CMap.\n\n```\nUnicode unicode_from_font (CharCode code, GfxFont * font)\n{\n    if(!font->isCIDFont())\n    {\n        char * cname = dynamic_cast<Gfx8BitFont*>(font)->getCharName(code);\n        if(cname)\n        {\n            Unicode ou = globalParams->mapNameToUnicodeText(cname);\n            if(!is_illegal_unicode(ou))\n                return ou;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return map_to_private(code);\n```\n\nAll the other ligatures managed to avoid the \"if(cname)\" block, and reached \"map_to_private(code)\".\n\nI'm not clear yet whether this is therefore a bug in poppler?\n. I manually created some pdfs in LibreOffice, and I only see the problems with the font \"DejaVu Sans\".  There are two issues:\n- \"ToUnicode CMap is not valid and got dropped\" only happens when the \"fl\" ligature is included.\n- If you remove the word \"flair\" from the pdf, then you still get \"E\ue01eective con\ue01fdent\" when you inspect the HTML.\n\n**Edit:** DejaVu fonts happen to be on github and are a freedesktop.org project.  The test pdf used version 2.35 of that font, but I can reproduce these issues with version 2.37.  My copy of evince (i.e. poppler) renders all my test PDFs fine, and can search/copy the text correctly, so I think there must legitimately be a pdf2htmlEX bug with how ligatures are expanded.\n. This hack avoids the first problem, but doesn't fix the second:\n\n``` diff\n--- a/src/util/unicode.cc\n+++ b/src/util/unicode.cc\n@@ -38,7 +38,7 @@ Unicode map_to_private(CharCode code)\n\n Unicode unicode_from_font (CharCode code, GfxFont * font)\n {\n-    if(!font->isCIDFont())\n+    if(!font->isCIDFont() && font->getName()->getChar(6) != '+')\n     {\n         char * cname = dynamic_cast<Gfx8BitFont*>(font)->getCharName(code);\n         // may be untranslated ligature\n```\n\nThis works on the basis that it doesn't make sense to map the names of subsetted fonts, and those fonts will always have six random characters and then a plus sign in the name.  There's probably a better way to do that...\n. @coolwanglu This PDF and derived HTML demonstrates the second problem more precisely, sidestepping the first bug (so note that the \"ToUnicode CMap is not valid and got dropped\" only happens when a ligature gets mapped to 0x20?):\n\n[659-deja-vu-sans.pdf](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/files/444398/659-deja-vu-sans.pdf)\n[659-deja-vu-sans.html.txt](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/files/444403/659-deja-vu-sans.html.txt)\n\nThe generated HTML contains: `e4ective con5dent e6cient 7air e8uent`, because the ligatures ended up in the normal places for those digits.  [**EDIT:** But when viewed in a browser, this looks fine, because the digits are mapped to the ligatures by the font.  I guess the ideal would be to decompose the ligatures in the HTML, but still have the font display the ligatures in the browser, if that's possible.]\n\nPassing \"--decompose-ligature 1\" does avoid this issue, but then ligature glyphs are not shown at all in the HTML output.\n. This appears to be a separate issue to #459, because in the generated output on that issue, I can see \"fi\" in the HTML - I don't think that used a subsetted font.  @lano1106 mentioned these ligature problems on that report, though.\n. Comparing the subsetted \"f1.ttf\" font left in /tmp with the original DejaVu-Sans.ttf in fontforge, I can see that the substitution tables have been left out when embedding the font in the PDF.  To get ligatures to work in the WOFF version, we'd need to recreate the necessary substitutions, I think, by looking at the decomposed unicode chars provided in the CMap.\n\nThe PDF's CMap does not provide a way to get the original unicode codepoints \"U+FB00\" etc. for the ligatures.  I've also found references online to fonts such as Carlito, which provide a \"ti\" ligature with no standard unicode codepoint for the glyph.  So this suggests to me that we won't have much luck trying to place the ligatures in their \"correct\" codepoints and using these directly in the HTML - rather, the ligatures ought always to be decomposed in the HTML, and the font itself should be upgraded to handle the substitution.\n\nHere's an example PDF with Carlito \"ti\" and \"tti\" ligatures, displaying similar problems:\n[carlito-ligatures.pdf](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/files/444692/carlito-ligatures.pdf)\n. @venkatnr I've seen a similar thing with a permissions issue - i.e. when my code couldn't read the input file, it accidentally passed a zero-length file to pdf2htmlEX, which came out blank.\n.

Initially tried on a remote Amazon Linux EC2 instance but the output didn't work on Lambda.\r\n2. After this move the required libraries & binaries to a lambda function on your host machine.\r\n3. Run on a image that replicates your desired lambda environment, my test script basically was:\r\n```docker run -v \\\"$PWD\\\":/var/task lambci/lambda:nodejs6.10 index.handler '{\"some\":\"event\"}'``` using a [child process](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v6.x/api/child_process.html) inside node.js to call pdf2htmlEX from node.\r\n4.

Have the same problem and tracked it down to the encoding pointers in ffw.c:\r\n\r\n```\r\nstatic Encoding * original_enc = NULL;\r\nstatic Encoding * unicodefull_enc = NULL;\r\nstatic Encoding * enc_head = NULL;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese are set in the function `void ffw_init(int debug)` but the returned addresses from fontforge do not match, e.g:\r\n```\r\nFUNC _FindOrMakeEncoding: return enc address from enclist: 0x7f2f07cf0320\r\nFUNC ffw_init: original_enc address: 0x7cf0320\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe returned address in this example only contains the last 4bytes and the preceding part 7f2f0 is omitted. I generated the output via:\r\n`printf(\"ffw_init original_enc address: %p\\n\", original_enc);`\r\nand\r\n`printf(\"_FindOrMakeEncoding enc address from enclist: %p\\n\", enc);`\r\n\r\nI hope the printf code is correct and does not provide false information. Can't fathom why the addresses do not match.\r\n\r\n. Managed to build it with poppler-0.59.0.\r\n\r\nThe poppler API regarding the class \"Object\" has changed. The code in `font.cc` and `CairoBackgroundRenderer.cc` uses the older API.\r\n\r\nI had to remove all calls to `free()` and change for example following calls:\r\nold `font.cc line 81`:\r\n```\r\nif(dict->lookup(\"DescendantFonts\", &font_obj2)->isArray())\r\n```\r\nnew `font.cc 81`:\r\n```\r\nfont_obj2 = dict->lookup(\"DescendantFonts\");\r\nif(font_obj2.isArray())\r\n```\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\nI encountered another problem described in [722](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/issues/722) and unfortunately cannot test if the code changes above also ensure correct behavior.\r\n.
