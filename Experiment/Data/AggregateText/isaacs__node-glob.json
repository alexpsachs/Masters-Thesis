    "isaacs": "fixed on head, or npm install glob\n. I'm not familiar with ndistro.  Wanna submit a patch to make it work?  What's involved?\n\nnode-glob works fine with npm.\n. NetBSD has an implementation that's BSD-licensed.  So that'd work.\n. Implemented in v2.0.0\n. implemented in 2.0.0.  `require('glob').glob` has the `GLOB_` constants, and `require('glob').fnmatch` has the `FNMATCH_` constants.\n. Whoops!  Thanks.\n. Closed by f3e2da0ea0e0989e0d337bd487e8d246405704ff Add strlcpy if not defined\n. thanks :)\n. Fixed on version 2.0.4\n. Yep :)\n\nJust have to figure out how to make it build on Solaris, now.\n. What's `uname -a` say?\n. Should work on linux now.  Just published the fixes.\n. dachev: Can you pull the latest source from github and run `node-waf configure build` on it?\n. If it works with what's in git HEAD right now, then that's fantastic. I still need to get it to build properly on Solaris, and then I'll npm publish again and update this issue so you all get emailed about it.\n. Ok, try 2.0.4, just published.  Should build and run properly on Mac, Linux, and Solaris.\n. Will be solved by #23\n. That was supposed to be for #48, whoops.\n. Could it be that npm isn't re-building the bundles?  What version of npm are you using?\n. If you do `npm bundle rebuild glob` then does it work?  What's the output of npm when you install the package with the bundled glob in it?\n. Great!  The good news is that I just checked, and this is already\nfixed in 1.0.  Since you've got a workaround, I'm gonna go ahead and\nnot bother investigating whatever is broken in 0.3.15 :)\n. 1. what version of glob are you using?\n2. what operating system?\n3. what version of node?\n4. I'm pretty sure `*/.js` is not going to match anything.  Sure you didn't mean `*.js`?\n. Ok, cool.  See if the problem goes away by upgrading node to 0.4.5 (it might).\n\nI'm going to port glob to be just in js soon.  It won't be quite as fast, but it will be way more stable and portable that way.\n. You could maybe do `path.resolve(\"./**/*.js\")` then, in the meantime.\n\nIf you could run it in gdb, I'd love a stack trace.  Otherwise closing this for now.\n. ```\necho 'require(\"glob\").glob(\"./**/*.js\", function (er, paths) { console.error(er, paths) })' > g.js\ngdb node\n# in gdb:\nset args g.js\nrun\n```\n\nThe \"help\" command is helpful :)\n. Ah, right, so, at that point, do this:\n\n```\n(gdb) backtrace\n```\n\nI can repro this on my linux box (was missing something obvious before).

Hopefully not too many people published binary packages!  Thanks for the heads-up.\n. Those are fine.\n. Will be solved by #23\n. If at all possible, it's best to use npm 1.0, _especially_ if you prefer the \"bundle\" approach to dependency management.\n\nThis is a known issue with npm 0.x when bundling packages that have build steps, and will not be fixed.\n. The fix will be to port it to use my js implementation.  I've got most of the parts already, just need to assemble them behind the same API that glob has.\n. Does it work using node stable (v0.4.11)?\n. I'm going to port this to a pure JavaScript version.  Keeping this portable is too annoying.\n. Use node stable, v0.4\n. Has nothing to do with lion.  It doesn't work with node 0.5\n. Check out `minimatch`.  It's what I've been using in npm to parse globs.\n. mimimatch is this: https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch or `npm install minimatch`\n. No, the plan is to use minimatch's matching, but add file system traversal, so that it's the same API.\n\nI'm not interested in porting bsdglob.c.\n. Yes, that is the plan.\n\nOn Fri, Nov 18, 2011 at 16:08, August Lilleaas\nreply@reply.github.com\nwrote:\n\n> So the plan is to update the glob module by depending on minimatch and using the fs module to traverse the file system?\n> \n> ---\n> \n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\n> https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/issues/23#issuecomment-2796183\n. Done.\n. No longer a C program.  Should work fine now.\n. The scons build system is going away, so this is at best a stop gap measure.  But it seems like a pretty reasonable stop-gap, so why not?\n\nLanded on master, published as 2.1.0\n. This should work well on Windows using recent versions of node 0.6.  Please comment here with more details and I'll reopen the issue if it's still a problem.\n. d'oh.  Thanks!\n\nMerged into master and --force published to npm.\n. What for?  https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/commit/d344c63cd0a802d6f9c30d2886a77173fa8ac88c\n. Sorry, @TooTallNate beat you to this one.\n. Nice find.  I'm a bit ashamed I missed that, it's so obvious.  Fix coming very soon.\n. Yeah, it's a bug.  Haven't had a chance to fix it yet.\n\nThe solution is to detect whether each pattern in the set is absolute or not, and only strip the cwd from each result if it was not an absolute pattern.\n\nAlso, weird though it may be, there were previous cases where `{/foo,/foo}` would return the same thing more than once, so each match needs to be tied to a given glob in the set.  That's the ultimate solution, though @TooTallNate's workaround is ok for the short-term.\n. Fixed on master, published as glob 3.1\n. Yeah, that's a bug.\n. Can you please try with the latest push to master?  Also published as glob@3.1.0.\n. Could you explain a little bit what \"not working for me at all now\" means?\n\nIs it throwing an error?  Hanging?  Doesn't install?\n. Aha.  It's getting confused when the cwd isn't process.cwd.\n. v3.1.3 should have what you need.  Thanks!\n. `root` is used when you want patterns starting with `/` to be interpreted as being in some specific directory.\n\nSeems like that's broken atm too, though.\n. Say you have this structure:\n\n```\na\n+-- b\n|    `-- c\n+-- c\n```\n\nThen `glob('/c', {root: 'a', cwd: 'a/b'})` would match `a/c` but not `a/b/c`.  If you drop the slash, then you see that `glob('c', {root:'a',cwd:'a/b'})` would match the `a/b/c` file, but not the `a/c` file.\n\nWhat's not immediately clear is how best to express this in the results.  I'm thinking that any and all patterns that start with `/` should show up in the results as a full absolute path, with the `root` config pre-pended.\n\nAnother option would be to resolve everything against the cwd, but that breaks the symmetry with how it works by default, when cwd is process.cwd(), and root is /.  The \"evil owl\" pattern `{*,/*}` returns `/etc, /usr, /home, etc...` for the \"absolute\" part, but `foo, bar, baz, ...` for the \"relative\" part.\n\nSetting a root is important for handling situations like ignore files.  `/foo.txt` in a .gitignore will prevent `./foo.txt` from being included, but not `./bar/foo.txt`.\n\nWhen building a tarball or something, though, you probably don't want to get the full path, since that'll result in adding a bunch of noise into your tarball, so this will have to be configurable, with the default perhaps being to prepend the root, and an option to disable, akin to rsync's '--no-implied-dirs' option.\n. Because the default `root` is `/`, not the cwd.  The evil owl `{/*,*}` needs to return everything in `/` as well as everything in `.`.  So, by default, yes it _is_ prefixed.\n\nIf you want to disable this, set `{ nomount: true }` in the options object.\n. The glob tests are a little tricky right now.  You have go have bash4 installed, and turn on extglob and globstar in your shell.\n\nIt'd be nice to bundle a standalone bsdglob or something for reference, but I haven't done that yet.\n. Yes that is a bug.\n\nOn Monday, February 6, 2012, Johan Nordberg <\nreply@reply.github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Yep, installed bash4 and all tests pass.

Try `**/*.txt`.  See the documentation in the minimatch readme file.\n\nTHe stray console.error is removed on 3.1.2.\n. Use node 0.6.\n. Nevertheless, fixed in glob 3.1.6 :)\n. I don't know what you're actually asking for.  What change would have to be made in node-glob?\n. I see.  Yes, supporting an array of glob patterns is planned for ignorefile support, but it'll probably be a different module.  Something like this:\n\n``` javascript\nvar mg = new MultiGlob(['a/b/c', 'd/e', '!test'], options)\nmg.on('match', doSomething)\n```\n\nIf it turns out to not be much of a change, or too difficult to do externally, I might fold this into node-glob directly, and just have Glob take an array or a single pattern. Would this API satisfy your use-case?\n. Turns out this is complicated and hard, and I ended up doing IgnoreFile as its own module.\n. e8f420866ebf4aed0f2e043dcda2dbb23a650889\n. Oh, also, 83939fc8bcbc330d2baff92936e2ce589d2c71c2\n. Landed on 7246f640be49401845d7935f9ec2f07137c39a5d, published as 3.1.7, thanks!\n. Doing gitignore handling is a much more involved process, since it requires the ability to pause and resume the walk at any arbitrary point.\n\nI write https://github.com/isaacs/fstream-ignore to do this.  It's very extensible.  I'm using it in https://github.com/isaacs/fstream-npm.  However, if you just want the list of matches, it's a bit heavy, since it stats and reads every file.\n\nIf you want to add this functionality to glob, it should be a separate module.  This is strictly an implementation of glob(3) in javascript.\n. Fixed in the latest release.\n. Confirmed.  That is a bug.\n. Working on latest release.\n. Yep.  That's the bug, alright.  Thanks.\n. I'm gonna call that a wontfix.  If you have a patch that does this in some elegant way, then fine, but otherwise just normal paths work with glob.\n. Landed on 3.1.14.  Thanks!\n. > it appears that graceful-fs is causing hanging write operations.\n\nWhat does this mean?  Can you provide a test-case that reproduces what you're talking about?\n. Fixed on isaacs/node-graceful-fs@3f391309b97e5c61bb8cf633911d0a02f095b024\n\nThanks!\n. +1. Patch welcome.\n. Fixed by 1b0c060, put the wrong issue number in it.\n. Interesting. So the directory filtering is failing.\n. Yeah, definitely a bug.  Patch welcome.\n. Works properly on Unix.\n. Seems like it works properly on Windows as well:\n\n```\nC:\\globtest\\node-glob\\test>cat g.js\nvar glob = require('glob');\nvar path = require('path');\n\nglob(__dirname + '/**/*', function (err, matches) {\n console.log(matches); // matches is ok\n});\n\nC:\\globtest\\node-glob\\test>node g.js\n[ 'C:\\\\globtest\\\\node-glob\\\\test/00-setup.js',\n  'C:\\\\globtest\\\\node-glob\\\\test/bash-comparison.js',\n  'C:\\\\globtest\\\\node-glob\\\\test/bash-results.json',\n  'C:\\\\globtest\\\\node-glob\\\\test/cwd-test.js',\n  'C:\\\\globtest\\\\node-glob\\\\test/g.js',\n  'C:\\\\globtest\\\\node-glob\\\\test/mark.js',\n  'C:\\\\globtest\\\\node-glob\\\\test/pause-resume.js',\n  'C:\\\\globtest\\\\node-glob\\\\test/root-nomount.js',\n  'C:\\\\globtest\\\\node-glob\\\\test/root.js',\n  'C:\\\\globtest\\\\node-glob\\\\test/zz-cleanup.js' ]\n```\n. This is using glob 3.1.17, btw.\n. I installed the msysutil suite with git, but it's normal cmd otherwise.  I just don't know most of the windows equivalents.\n\nWhat is the actual output?\n. That is, what is the output if `glob(__dirname + '/**/*')` vs the output of `glob('**/*')`?\n. Also, what is `node -v`?\n. Type Alt-Space, E, K, then select with your mouse, then press Enter.  This copies the output to your clipboard, and you can paste it into a code block with ```\n. Put a `/` in front of `'test'`.  Echo out the actual path that you're globbing, you'll see the problem right away, I'm sure.  (`__dirname` doesn't end in a slash.)\n. ``` diff\n-glob(__dirname + 'test/**/*', function (err, matches) {\n+glob(__dirname + '/test/**/*', function (err, matches) {\n```\n. Aha!  Ok, reproducing now:\n\n``` javascript\nvar glob = require('glob');\n\nvar p1 = 'test/**/*';\nglob(p1, function (err, matches) {\n    console.log(p1, matches);\n});\n\nvar p2 = __dirname + '/' + p1;\nglob(p2, function (er, matches) {\n    console.log(p2, matches);\n});\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nc:\\globtest\\Helena>node test.js\nc:\\globtest\\Helena/test/**/* []\ntest/**/* [ 'test/asdasd.txt',\n  'test/dir',\n  'test/dir/a.txt',\n  'test/dir/b.txt',\n  'test/dsadsa.txt' ]\n```\n\nFolder structure:\n\n```\ntest/\ntest/asdasd.txt\ntest/dir/\ntest/dir/a.txt\ntest/dir/b.txt\ntest/dsadsa.txt\n```\n.

Note, a \"fresh install of windows\" doesn't matter if you're using an old install of node and glob.  Do `npm ls glob` to see which version you're using, and `npm install glob@latest` to make sure to install the latest one.\n. Ha!  I was the one using an outdated glob!  Apparently this was fixed in 3.1.14, but regressed in 3.2.\n\n```\nC:\\globtest\\x>C:\\node-v0.10.12\\Release\\node.exe t.js\n[ 'C:/globtest/x' ]\nglob version 3.2.1\nnode version v0.10.12\n\nassert.js:92\n  throw new assert.AssertionError({\n        ^\nAssertionError: \"C:/globtest/x\" == \"C:/globtest/x/\"\n    at C:\\globtest\\x\\t.js:9:12\n    at Glob.<anonymous> (C:\\globtest\\node_modules\\glob\\glob.js:90:7)\n    at Glob.EventEmitter.emit (events.js:95:17)\n    at Glob._processEmitQueue (C:\\globtest\\node_modules\\glob\\glob.js:294:10)\n    at Glob.emitMatch (C:\\globtest\\node_modules\\glob\\glob.js:271:10)\n    at Glob._finish (C:\\globtest\\node_modules\\glob\\glob.js:232:8)\n    at Glob.<anonymous> (C:\\globtest\\node_modules\\glob\\glob.js:173:27)\n    at Glob.cb (C:\\globtest\\node_modules\\glob\\glob.js:315:11)\n    at Glob.<anonymous> (C:\\globtest\\node_modules\\glob\\glob.js:355:16)\n    at Glob._afterStat (C:\\globtest\\node_modules\\glob\\glob.js:561:6)\n```\n. Yes, I'm emulating windows 7 in VMWare.  I don't have a \"real\" bare-metal windows machine.\n. Fixed on latest release.  Issue was that `path.resolve()` removes trailing slashes.\n. Whoops!  Sorry, thought i'd removed those already.  Landed on master.\n. done on 3.2\n. landed in master, thanks.\n. Very tricksy!  The reason is that, if you don't have any magic in the pattern, glob \"shortcuts\" and just checks for the exact string you gave it.  Since it's a case-sensitive file system, that means that it will only find that one exact thing, regardless of the `nocase` flag.\n\nIt would be nice if there were a way to detect a case-sensitive file system, but afaik, there is no such way.  I think perhaps we just need to treat `nocase` patterns as if they had magic at all levels, even if they don't.  Consider this:\n\n```\nmkdir /tMp\ntouch /tmp/foo\ntouch /tmp/fOo\ntouch /tMp/Foo\ntouch /tMp/foO\n\nglob.sync('/tmp/foo', {nocase: true})\n// expect all 4, so we need to test *every* part of the pattern!\n```\n\nA test would be awesome.  The only way I can see to test this would be to mock out the fs object, which is tedious, but not super hard.  You've messed around with glob a lot, wanna try writing a patch?  Probably just a matter of changing some check somewhere to assume that patterns are always magical if nocase is set.\n. I think it's just in minimatch, iirc.  Search for `hasMagic`.  It should\ndefault to `true` if nocase is set.  I think it currently defaults to\nfalse, then gets set to true if there are any magic chars.  If there's no\nmagic, then it returns a string instead of a regexp.\n\nOn Thu, Feb 21, 2013 at 7:45 AM, Ben Alman notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Is this entirely handled in minimatch, or is it in glob as well?

Patch welcome\n. Landed in 3.2.1\n. Yep, this is a bug.\n. It's not property respecting the `this.minimatch.negate` flag, which should flip all the comparisons.\n. Patch welcome.\n. I'm not familiar with glob-whatev.  But this module should behave 100% the way that the documentation says it does.  If you find a case where it doesn't, then that's a bug.\n\nBy default, it supports everything under \"Pattern Matching\" in `man bash`, except for Tilde Expansion, and adds \"negation\" as well (like in .gitignore file patterns).  You can turn off any options you want.\n. Er, turn off any options you _don't_ want, I guess ;)\n. Issues on this repo are for bugs in this repo.  It's not an effective way to post a question to users of node-glob, since most of them never see this page.\n\nIt'd be better to post to the nodejs mailing list, probably.\n. Right, I see why this is happening.\n\nLet's say you have a tree like this:\n\n```\n.\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 y/\n \u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 d/\n \u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 e.c\n \u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 a\n \u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 a.c\n \u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 b\n \u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 b.c\n```\n\nand you search for the glob pattern: `**/*.c`.  You want to find these things:\n\n```\ny/a.c\ny/b.c\ny/d/e.c\n```\n\nWhen it has a globstar, that can match 0 or more path segments.  So, the way that it does that is to read the dir, then test each child as if they were below the globstar, and if they replace the globstar.\n\nSo, you have a pattern like `[**, *.c]`.  So, you read the cwd, and get `[x, y]`.  For each child, test if it matches without the globstar, if the child replaces the globstar (to find its grandchildren) and also below the globstar (for further descendants).  This results in the following patterns:\n\n```\n[ *.c ]\n[ y, *.c ]\n[ y, **, *.c ]\n```\n\nWe then process each of those.\n\nThe first matches nothing.\n\nThe children of y are `[a a.c b b.c d]`.  For the first pattern, this is simple, and then for the next, we do the same special globstar approach.\n\n```\n[ *.c ] --> [] (no matches)\n[ y, *.c ] --> [ y/a.c, y/b.c ]\n[ y, **, *.c ] -->\n  [ y, *.c ] (without the globstar, note the duplicate!)\n  [ y, a.c, *.c ]\n  [ y, a.c, **, *.c ]\n  [ y, b.c, *.c ]\n  [ y, a, *.c ]\n  [ y, a, **, *.c ]\n  [ y, b, *.c ]\n  [ y, b, **, *.c ]\n  [ y, d, *.c ]\n  [ y, d, **, *.c ]\n```\n\nI'm not sure just how much of a problem this really is.  After all, if you listen on the 'end' event (or just use the top-level function instead of the object) then you'll get the deduped list.  Solving this problem without breaking the other trickier examples would be pretty tough.\n. This is exactly a duplicate of #64 (posted by @chbrown).  Apparently it was a mistake to close that one, since more people are clearly affected by it :)\n\nThere's an explanation in #64 about why this is happening.  The trivial fix breaks a bunch of tests, but this is indeed a bug.\n. > Ouch. The issue immediately before this one...\n\nHaha, no worries.  I guess it just shows that more people are affected by this than I'd thought, that's all.\n\n> how do the post-processing methods de-dupe?\n\nYes, it's using Object keys, as long as you don't set `nounique:true` in the options.  That flag is important if you want brace-expanded portions to behave exactly like Bash (where dupes will show in that case).\n\nI think the right solution is not to dedupe along the way, but rather to find an algorithm for globstar that doesn't suffer from this shortcoming.\n. Actually, whatever, just dedupe the patterns that globstar resolves to.\n. The reason is that it's aggressively caching stat results to save syscalls.  Each of those is an object, and with a whole lot of them, it gets considerable.\n\nIt'd probably be possible to replace the simple object caches with a LRU or something using the https://github.com/isaacs/node-lru-cache module\n. I suspect that this is no longer an issue, as this module has been heavily refactored and slimmed down since then.  Closing for now, but please do pipe up if it's still a problem in the latest release.\n. Expected behavior.\n\nYou're looking for `c/**/f.json`, right?  Well, glob does a readdir on a dir like `c/w`, and gets `f.json, w.js` as results.  At that point, it doesn't know whether the items returned are directories or files.  And, it doesn't care: `c/w/f.json` is a match, but if `f.json` is a dir, then `c/w/f.json/f.json` would also be a match, and `c/w/f.json/a/b/c/d/e/f/g/f.json` would be a match as well.  So, it does a readdir on `c/w/f.json`, which tells it two things: (1) Is f.json a dir? and (2) if it's a dir, what's inside it?  The ENOTDIR tells is that it's not a directory, and it moves on.\n\nThe fact that it's calling stat at all is a bit odd in this case.  Can you please provide an actual test script in JavaScript, with a real folder structure?\n. In general it seems fine, and won't break anything on the Unix side.  Can you add a test that specifically addresses the problem in #61?\n\nAlso, I prefer to do package.json changes myself, but I can rebase that out.  You can point your package.json dependency at your github fork while waiting for this to be merged.\n. Landed on f3105a3cfc12d3c6e0a2c931d8cf7f1a6a1ff49a.  Thanks!\n. Maybe someday, but not likely any time soon.\n. I'd accept a PR to add a `glob.Stream` class that is a readable stream.  But I'd rather not change the `glob.Glob` class itself.  Just have `glob.Stream` wrap a `glob.Glob` object internally, and inherit from `stream.Readable`.\n. Rather than land this in this module, here's a quick wrapper that anyone can use\n\n``` javascript\n// copyright Isaac Z. Schlueter. Public Domain.\nvar glob = require('glob')\nvar Readable = require('stream').Readable\nvar util = require('util')\nutil.inherits(GlobStream, Readable)\nfunction GlobStream (pattern, options) {\n  Readable.call(this, options)\n  var self = this\n  this.glob = glob(pattern, options)\n  this.glob.on('match', function (m) {\n    self.push(m)\n  })\n  this.glob.on('end', function () {\n    self.push(null)\n  })\n  this.glob.on('abort', function () {\n    self.push(null)\n  })\n  this.glob.on('error', function (er) {\n    self.emit('error', er)\n  })\n})\n```\n. Already fixed on https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/commit/1bf9d36cc8bb3081ed2c2978eb74dbc33bcdedf1 ;)\n. is this still an issue?  Tests seem to be passing, as far as I can tell.\n. Yeah, this isn't a bug.  Just an annoying thing.\n. Sorry for the delay, I've been meaning to get to this, and hoped that I would over the thanksgiving holiday, but it slipped.\n\nI'll try to land this week.  Thanks for your patience.\n. Don't worry about rebasing on master, I think the patch should land pretty cleanly, and it's relatively simple, so it shouldn't be too hard for me to pull forward if necessary.\n. @stefanpenner et al: See #146. I need a test that passes with the patch, and _doesn't_ pass without the patch.\n\nNothing can be landed in this library with a valid test.  I'm sorry for being so strict about this, but it's the only thing that makes maintenance of this module even remotely possible.\n. Yes, the test needs to run on Unix (mostly so I don't inadvertently destroy it some day, which I probably will otherwise).\n\nWindows CI would be awesome, and I'd greatly appreciate getting this module running somewhere.  But it's not a replacement for a test that runs on Unix.\n. Yes, plus one, would merge.  I suggest hijacking or mocking whatever is necessary to make the patch in #146 testable on unix.  That's actually all that's missing from getting to UNC support; appveyor is optional.\n. There isn't a working fix to merge, or else I would have done so by now.  What you're waiting for is not \"this fix to land\", but rather \"a fix to exist\".\n\nHere's what's needed for a valid solution, to this or any defect in any code I maintain:\n1. Code that fixes the problem.\n2. Tests that fail without the patch, and pass with the patch.\n3. Those tests have to run on Unix systems (mock everything, I don't care, but the test has to actually run)\n\nWithout (2), it's not clear that the code actually works.  Without (3), the tests will start failing some day and no one will notice.  These aren't weird desert island requirements or unrealistic doom and gloom predictions.  They're just what happens.\n\nI haven't had time to dig into this particular issue.  @stefanpenner made a courageous attempt, but then seems to have faded away with an ominous last message about a Pandora's Box.\n\nI understand that this is important to you all.  That importance does not change the fact that I cannot accept changes that are going to reduce test quality.  Maybe if one of you work at a company that benefits from having a glob implementation in JavaScript, and is affected by this Windows-specific issue, you can try to convince your boss to let you spend a few days working on it.\n. Yeah, I think it'd be ok to add a feature to let you pass in a JavaScript sort function (of the kind passed to Array.sort), but the default built in sorting will remain as it currently is.\n. Fixed in 4.1.\n\n```\nreaddir called with args { '0': 'test', '1': [Function] }\nreaddir called with args { '0': 'test/a', '1': [Function] }\nreaddir called with args { '0': 'test/a/abcdef', '1': [Function] }\nreaddir called with args { '0': 'test/a/abcfed', '1': [Function] }\nreaddir called with args { '0': 'test/a/b', '1': [Function] }\nreaddir called with args { '0': 'test/a/bc', '1': [Function] }\nreaddir called with args { '0': 'test/a/c', '1': [Function] }\nreaddir called with args { '0': 'test/a/cb', '1': [Function] }\nreaddir called with args { '0': 'test/a/symlink', '1': [Function] }\nreaddir called with args { '0': 'test/a/abcdef/g', '1': [Function] }\nreaddir called with args { '0': 'test/a/abcfed/g', '1': [Function] }\nreaddir called with args { '0': 'test/a/b/c', '1': [Function] }\nreaddir called with args { '0': 'test/a/bc/e', '1': [Function] }\nreaddir called with args { '0': 'test/a/c/d', '1': [Function] }\nreaddir called with args { '0': 'test/a/cb/e', '1': [Function] }\nreaddir called with args { '0': 'test/a/symlink/a', '1': [Function] }\nreaddir called with args { '0': 'test/a/c/d/c', '1': [Function] }\nreaddir called with args { '0': 'test/a/symlink/a/b', '1': [Function] }\n```\n. Hm.  Seems like it'd be better to just make this work.\n. Why doesn't broccoli use `glob.sync` then?  It's a command-line builder-type app, right? (Or am I missing the point of it...?)\n\nExcept in extremely rare scenarios, async fs I/O will _always_ be strictly slower than sync fs I/O.  If you don't _need_ to be doing many things in parallel, there is no benefit.\n\nThis is my primary objection to saying \"Just add `await`!\" or other coro-style approaches to making code \"look sync\".  How it looks is the smallest downside of asynchronous code!  If you need to run lots of stuff in parallel, and responding consistently is worth a bit of a slowdown across the board, and a huge percentage of your time is spent in a waiting sleep mode, then async I/O is great.\n\nThis describes most web servers, but _not_ most command-line programs, which typically do a small number of things at a time, and care more about just blasting through it all as fast as possible.\n. Oh, ok.  Then yeah, it's just slow.  I've done a lot of combing through it to remove unnecessary syscalls, but haven't profiled the JS itself.  Would love patches to make it faster.\n. Ok!  Initial investigation suggests that the biggest source of the delay is reliance on node's `fs.readdir` to determine both directory-ness and contents.  Since this uses a file descriptor, it's getting wrapped by `graceful-fs` which is explicitly designed to trade speed in favor of managed resource utilization.  So that sucks.\n\nAdditionally, there's some just plain shoddy JavaScript that's accreted over time in the readdir callback handling that V8 is having trouble optimizing.  I think that whole area needs a thorough refactoring to remove a few steps, and especially since glob matching is being used in some very time-sensitive applications, all of the `.bind()` and `.call()` usage needs to be eliminated.  Wrapping callbacks to do stuff at the end, tons of anonymous closures being defined inside of methods, it's kind of a giant mess.  I have enlisted the help of [The Dark Pony Zalgo](http://blog.izs.me/post/59142742143/designing-apis-for-asynchrony) to have a single code path that is used for both sync and async behavior.  I thought that I could preserve sanity if His Dark Tendrils were buried deep enough below the API layer.  I was wrong.\n\nLastly, in the globstar case specifically, both bash 4.3 and the next version of node-glob have to do an `lstat` on all directories encountered in the crawl, since symlinks to directories should _not_ be crawled.  So, the `Node statSync and readdirSync timing` benchmark test is not quite an apples-to-apples comparison.  It should probably lstatSync each directory as well as readdiring it.  It's still a LOT faster than the node-glob tests, but falls a bit more behind the bash/zsh test cases, as one would expect.\n\nI've got the bash43 style globstar behavior implemented properly on a branch now, but it's even slower.  I'd like to refactor and optimize it to get the speed up before merging into master, which will make this much better.\n. On the splitsync branch, I added another 10x to the benchmark script, and got these numbers:\n\n```\nBash timing: real   3m26.991s\nZsh timing: real    1m56.420s\nNode statSync and readdirSync timing: real  2m0.762s\nNode readdirSync error-catching timing: real    1m52.183s\nNode glob.sync timing: real 3m43.829s\nNode glob async timing:\nFATAL ERROR: CALL_AND_RETRY_2 Allocation failed - process out of memory\nbenchmark.sh: line 70: 52477 Abort trap: 6           node -e '\n  var glob=require(\"../\");\n  glob(\"**/*.txt\", function (er, files) {\n    console.log(files.length)\n  })'\n```\n\n`glob.sync` is comparable to Bash 4.3 on a huge dataset, and the master async glob runs out of memory.\n\nWith the 100000 file set, it's this:\n\n```\nBash timing: real   0m5.656s\nZsh timing: real    0m3.711s\nNode statSync and readdirSync timing: real  0m3.291s\nNode glob.sync timing: real 0m12.116s\nNode glob async timing: real    0m39.727s\n```\n\nThe sync approach is about 2.5 times Bash 4.3, 4x zsh and the naive node sync approach.\n\nNext step is to refactor the async approach similarly, and then it's profile time.\n. Currently, `glob.sync` is about 1.5 to 2x the time of bash 4.3, and `glob` is about 4-5x the bash time.  Zsh is a little bit faster, but that's because its globstar still crawls symlinked dirs, so it gets away with saving an extra lstat call.\n\nCalling this mission accomplished!  Look for massive speed improvements on glob 4.1.\n. @bpasero Even if you do the file actions asynchronously, there is usually a limit to just how async the fs can be, and there is a hard limit to how many threads node will use to perform async fs operations.  (Once upon a time that was 4, but I recall it being increased, maybe there's a cleverer heuristic involved since last I saw that code, which was a few years ago.  It might not be as \"hard\", but there is still definitely a limit.)\n\nSo, if you are parallelizing more fs ops than node allocates threads, it's going to back up, and be effectively serialized anyway.  (Of course, \"serialized\" with multiple parallel tracks, as each thread finishes what it's doing and then takes on a new job.)\n\nHowever, all of this is ultimately limited by the file system itself!  Spinning disks can only be in one position, so if you're trying to read 2 files in parallel, the fs will either thrash (making both operations slower than they would've been), or make one operation wait for the other.\n\nStat and readdir calls are less thrashy and more cacheable by the fs, since they're only dealing with the file link table (at least, on most Unixy systems).  But in fact, if every bit of data is available in the operating system's fs cache, they'll be very fast, and adding the async thread management overhead will be relevant.\n\n\"Parallelizing\" operations on a single machine (whether that's a single cpu or a single disk) is more like \"multitasking\" than \"teamwork\".  When you parallelize things across a _network_, of course, it's a whole different story, which is why things like Hadoop are so great for massively big data problems, compared with writing a simpler program for a single machine.  But when you parallelize a bunch of operations that are effectively throttled by a single bit of hardware, as a general rule, you're almost certainly not going to make things faster.\n\nLots of qualifiers there.  It's highly dependent on a lot of factors, like what specific type of disk is involved, the operating system, the file system type, as well as just whatever else the machine happens to be doing at the time.\n\nIf you _are_ doing many things in parallel (for example, it's a web server, where you don't want to pause in replying to one user's HTTP request while you read a file for another user), then async is absolutely the way to go.  Node makes this the \"default\" path because it's designed for building network programs, where this usually matters.\n\nIf you're a web server, then providing users with a consistently fast connection pick-up, and a predictable first-byte time, is all that really matters.  The \"average file read time\" is 100% worthless as a metric, if you lost business because some unlucky user had to wait 2s for a web page to load, and decided to hit the back button.\n\nBut if you're a cli utility, especially one that doesn't make network requests, then the situation is completely reversed.  The better approach is to avoid thrashing the disk, and since you have exactly one user who is going to wait for every single task to be completed, reducing the average task time is the way to go, so sync isn't just _easier_, it's also _better_.\n. > If all you do is just walking through the file system, I would not expect sync to be much slower than async.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that your expectation is wrong. You should expect sync to be _faster_ than async.  Async is always slower, it just has less of an effect on slowing down _other_ things (servers etc.)\n. Thanks, @joliss \n. I think this is not such a great idea.  But I'd be happy to accept a pull request that made it throw when no cb is provided and sync is not set to true, since I agree that's almost always going to be a mistake.\n\nYou can also use `glob.sync(...)`, by the way.\n. Yeah, I guess that's getting added after the 'match' event is emitted.\n\nThis is a bug.  Patch welcome.\n. Works for me in latest releases of 0.8, 0.10, and 0.11.\n\n```\n$ cat g.js\nvar glob = require('glob')\nglob('**', {mark:true}, function(er, c) {\n  console.error('cb', er, c)\n}).on('match', function(m) {\n  console.error('match', m)\n}).on('end', function(c) {\n  console.error('end', c)\n})\n\n$ node g.js\nmatch deep/\nmatch g.js\nmatch deep/deep.txt\nmatch deep/deeper/\nmatch deep/deeper/deeper.txt\nmatch deep/deeper/deepest/\nmatch deep/deeper/deepest/deepest.txt\ncb null [ 'deep/',\n  'deep/deep.txt',\n  'deep/deeper/',\n  'deep/deeper/deeper.txt',\n  'deep/deeper/deepest/',\n  'deep/deeper/deepest/deepest.txt',\n  'g.js' ]\nend [ 'deep/',\n  'deep/deep.txt',\n  'deep/deeper/',\n  'deep/deeper/deeper.txt',\n  'deep/deeper/deepest/',\n  'deep/deeper/deepest/deepest.txt',\n  'g.js' ]\n\n$ find .\n.\n./.g.js.swp\n./deep\n./deep/deep.txt\n./deep/deeper\n./deep/deeper/deeper.txt\n./deep/deeper/deepest\n./deep/deeper/deepest/deepest.txt\n./g.js\n```\n\nPlease share your standalone script that's behaving incorrectly.\n.

So, even though `foo/bar/foo/foofile` would match, it detects that `foo/bar/foo` refers to the `foo/` part of itself, so it doesn't explore that bit.\n\nFurthermore, this `**` behavior appears to have changed between Bash 4.1 and Bash 4.3!  Probably because it is unwieldy to deal with a gigantic mess of results when there are recursive symbolic links.\n\nThe crash that you're seeing is happening because there are a large _number_ of recursive symbolic links, rather than a particularly _deep_ set of them, so you're hitting the memory limit before hitting the ECYCLE error from the fs.  Updating to Bash 4.3-style behavior would fix the problem.\n. Your test is interesting, but non-authoritative.  The reference implementation that node-glob targets is bash 4's globstar and extglob behavior.  The example I posted above does show that Bash 4.1 and Bash 4.3 have different behavior, and it seems that Bash 4.3's globstar behavior is superior, so that's what we should target.\n\nIt doesn't matter what zsh or tab-completion do, ultimately, though this is one example of a use-case where the more \"conservative\" results are much more useful.\n. No, I don't have bash 4.1 installed any longer (upgraded due to shellshock some time ago).\n\nBut if I re-generate the test fixtures with bash 4.3, I see different results.  So, yeah, we're doing the wrong thing now (but only because \"the right thing\" changed!)\n. Here's the diff in the test fixture results from bash 4.1 (used to generate them originally) and bash 4.3 (which I have now) https://gist.github.com/isaacs/f748618f744f61756f55\n. So, it seems like the behavior can be summed up as: \"While expanding matches for a `**` section, do not explore any directories already part of that particular `**` expansion\".\n\nThis, of course, is _after_ consecutive `**` segments are collapsed.\n. Landed in 4.0, made MUCH faster in 4.1.\n. Landed, but using the `once` module instead of juggling event handlers.  Since presumably the glob object is going to be disposed of shortly in the event of an error callback, removing the handler is unnecessary, provided there is a hard guarantee that the cb is not fired again (which `once` provides).\n. minimatch is more like fnmatch, not an exact corrollary to glob.\n\nGlob is doing brace expansion, which is a shell-ism, rather than a glob-ism, per se.  On the shell, when you do `echo *.{a,b,c}` you are literally doing the exact same thing as `echo *.a *.b *.c`.  Check it out:\n\n```\n$ node -p process.argv *.{a,b,c}\n[ 'node', '*.a', '*.b', '*.c' ]\n```\n\nI'd be happy to accept a doc patch that clarifies that brace expansion happens before anything else, just like with the shell.\n. Function declarations are hoisted in JavaScript, and JSLint has kind of a bad attitude.\n\nNo thanks.\n. Well, it may not be unreasonable, but it _is_ incorrect.\n\n```\n$ echo {*}\n{*}\n\n$ echo {*,}\nLICENSE README.md examples glob.js node_modules package.json test\n```\n. https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/pull/96\n. I would accept a patch to do something like this.  If it's expensive in terms of performance then it should be optional.\n. https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/pull/96\n. I bumped the major version for this.\n\n_Seriously_, though, people, you _have_ to update your npm versions.  It has been almost a year since `^` support was added, and a few months since it's been the default.  You're getting left behind if you don't upgrade.\n\nDo this, everywhere:\n\n```\nnpm install npm -g\n```\n. You'll have to upgrade your version of Node to the latest 0.10 to build this package.\n. Aww, how sweet! Thanks!\n. The issue isn't with Node v0.8.  The issue is with npm 1.2.\n\nhttps://github.com/joyent/node/pull/7669\n. Fixed by 0414fb0\n. Something in your tree is depending on glob 4.x.  Probably it's doing either a `\"glob\":\"*\"` or `\"glob\":\">= <something>\"`.  Neither of these are safe or advisable options.\n\nThe bug isn't in node-glob, the bug is in whatever is depending on it too loosely.\n\nTry doing `npm ls glob` in your project after a fresh `npm install`, and you'll see all the places where glob is getting installed.\n.

In the short-run, you can avoid this by having a dependency at the top level on `\"glob\":\"3\"` it looks like.\n. What's happened is that you installed both browserify and glob.  Since browserify's glob dep was satisfied by the fact that you already had a glob 3.x there, it didn't install a second copy.  However, when you then installed glob 4.x, that clobbered the glob that browserify was depending on.\n\n`npm i browserify` will fix the situation.\n. @mreinstein YES! this is something I'm sorta working on part-time, whenever I'm slacking from my CEO duties.  It's part of the \"refactor install to not be so dumb\" project.\n. This does seem to be a bug, yes.\n. Wait a minute... how are you passing an array to glob?  This module doesn't support that, last I checked.\n. Yeah... it looks like negation is just broken?  I'm not sure what it would do...\n\nThis seems to work fine:\n\n``` javascript\nvar glob = require('./glob');\n\nglob('!(node_modules)/**', {nonegate:true}, function (err, files) {\n    console.log(files);\n});\n\n\n```\n. Thanks, but I'm going to pass on this for now.  It's easy enough to wrap a callback-taking function in a promise, and this is not the best place to be doing that.\n. 03daf204c935fa04e90fb605f4e3c6cde07c2d43 thanks!\n. Landed and pushed. Thanks!\n. Fixed by 5f9bc8391924aa9ecf20814bc1ca431abd5acd74.  Thanks.\n. Bumped minimatch to 1.0.0, and glob to 4.0.5.\n. It always uses \"/\".  Doc patch welcome.\n. Landed on globstar43 branch.  Will be in master soon.  Probably this weekend.\n. already fixed.\n. I like how this approach at an API is more explicit than the weirdness around negated globs today.\n\nPatch welcome, but it'll have to have lots of tests and some very clear docs.  Note that it'll have to be implemented for both sync and async approaches separately.  (That is, `glob.js` and `sync.js` are similar logic, implemented in parallel.)\n.

Done on globstar43 branch already.  That'll be merged into master once the perf is a bit better.\n. Sorry, I'm not interested in maintaining two metadata files.\n. Can you please provide a standalone glob test that does not involve gulp?\n. The negation semantics are really odd, actually, and I've thought a lot about ripping them out.  It shouldn't have anything to do with symlinks, though.\n. @impinball Yeah, totally.  It's just weird when it involves `**` stuff, and also it still only is limited to whatever non-globby prefix you provide, since this library takes a TON of shortcuts to avoid unnecessary directory walking.\n\nSo, for example, the pattern `!b*/c` will match anything named `c` that is not in the directories starting with `b`.  `!b/*` will not return anything.  `!b*/**` will match anything at any depth under any directory other than those that match `b*`.\n\nThis is clearly all wrong.\n\nWhat I think you usually want is more like `** but not anything matching the pattern`.\n\nFor example, if my pattern is `!app/*` then it should match any file in the cwd, but _not_ anything in the `app` dir.  But should it match `app/x/y`?  That isn't matched by `app/*`, so it seems like perhaps it should be matched by `!app/*`?  But that means that `!` will always imply a massive `**` walk, and you might be very surprised for it to go more than one level deep.\n\nDo you see what I'm getting at?  I'm a bit hesitant to change the negation behavior unless the change is to (a) completely remove it, or (b) first define what would be sensible.\n. If you are interested in making it sensible, please go weigh in at https://gist.github.com/isaacs/fc635c852c64ffabf2fd\n\nFor the time being, unfortunately, this issue will not be addressed, because any change will make things worse.\n. I'm going to leave in test, though the test _fixture_ is already ignored (because that is generated by the test scripts anyway).\n\nThe gif is already excluded on the `globstar43` branch, which will be merged in as soon as I can get the performance a bit better (or before getting the performance improved, if it ends up taking too long.)\n. This repo hasn't used travis-ci for about a year now, so that link is out of date and irrelevant.\n\nI'm curious about the two unit tests that fail locally.  I cloned your gist and tested it locally, and there is a bug in it.  You are setting `sync:true` in your options, but providing a callback.  That's not ever going to work.\n\n4.1.2 will contain a check for this, to throw a TypeError if you do that.\n\nWhat system are you running this on?  Do you have Bash 4.3?  Have you regenerated the test cases?\n. 4.1.2 published.\n. If you `git reset --hard` then it'll reset to the tests generated on my system with Bash 4.3, and it should pass.\n\nAlso!  I highly recommend getting Bash 4.3 so you can use globstar in your day to day command line globbing :) http://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=bash\n. @ekweible Can you please gist the entire test output?  I can't begin to debug this without knowing which pattern is failing.  Thanks.\n\nClosing until further details provided.  Will re-open if root-cause requires any changes.\n. Tests are included on purpose.\n. makes it easier for people to run the tests in strange environments.  But I suppose I could put a small test script that just tells you to download the git repo to run them.\n. Where are you using glob that it is too large?  The tarball is tiny, and not that much tinier with this patch.  Even over cheap internet, you're going to spend almost as much on HTTP headers as you do with this thing.\n\nIf you had truly limited disk space, or just a hella slow disk, such that the cost of unpacking these files was high, I could _maybe_ see it.  But even then, what are you doing using glob?  It's a bit of a memory hog and really only can be used on a server FS in the first place.\n\nA few people just told me that they support your right to publish micro packages, but they are grumpy when tests are not included, thus requiring an extra step to run them.\n. Yeah, re-enabled it last night :)\n. Thanks!  Added a test, but yes, this is a bug, not an intentional API change.\n. Symlinked directories are no longer explored.  This is the same behavior as Bash 4.3.  If you find a case where it doesn't behave the same as Bash 4.3, then please let me know.  Otherwise yes, this is by design.  See the discussion in https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/issues/86\n. If you rely on this behavior you should pin your glob dependency version at `3.x`.  This change was introduced in 4.0.\n. Indeed, you've found a discrepancy between bash 4.3 and node-glob!  This is a bug!  Posted as https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/issues/135\n\nThe solution is not \"follow symlinked dirs\" as suggested in the OP here.  The correct behavior is \"stop following symlinked dirs as part of a globstar match, but still resolve their contents against subsequent parts of pattern\".\n. @clintwood Yes, in the latest release you can do `{follow: true}` in the options, and it'll happily go along until it gets an ELOOP error from the fs.\n. @nathanjessup @seanmwalker Can you try pulling the GH-135 branch and see if that fixes things for you?  You can do `npm i isaacs/node-glob#GH-135` to install it in your project directly from GitHub.\n. Sweet.  It is closer to bash 4.3 behavior on this branch, and doesn't break any other tests, so I'm gonna go ahead and merge.\n. Landed and published as 4.1.6.\n. @seanmwalker \n\nThe intent wiht node-glob v4 is to match the behavior of Bash 4.3.  This is a breaking change, hence the bumped major version number.\n\nSo, with this structure:\n\n```\n~/my-module\n~/my-module/lib\n~/my-module/lib/aSymlinkedFolder -> ~/symDir\n~/my-module/lib/localFolder\n~/my-module/lib/localFolder/aScriptFile.js\n~/my-module/package.json\n~/my-module/server.js\n~/symDir\n~/symDir/bar\n~/symDir/bar/anotherThing.js\n~/symDir/foo\n~/symDir/foo/deeper\n~/symDir/foo/deeper/more.js\n~/symDir/foo/something.js\n```\n\nBash 4.3 returns this:\n\n```\n$ echo $BASH_VERSION\n4.3.30(6)-release\n\n$ for i in ~/my-module/lib/**/*; do echo $i; done\n/Users/isaacs/my-module/lib/aSymlinkedFolder\n/Users/isaacs/my-module/lib/aSymlinkedFolder/bar\n/Users/isaacs/my-module/lib/aSymlinkedFolder/foo\n/Users/isaacs/my-module/lib/localFolder\n/Users/isaacs/my-module/lib/localFolder/aScriptFile.js\n```\n\nBash 3.2 does this:\n\n```\n$ echo $BASH_VERSION\n3.2.48(1)-release\n\n$ for i in ~/my-module/lib/**/*; do echo $i; done\n/Users/isaacs/my-module/lib/aSymlinkedFolder/bar\n/Users/isaacs/my-module/lib/aSymlinkedFolder/foo\n/Users/isaacs/my-module/lib/localFolder/aScriptFile.js\n```\n\nNode-glob does this:\n\n```\n$ node -p 'require(\"glob\").sync(process.env.HOME + \"/my-module/lib/**/*\").join(\"\\n\")'\n/Users/isaacs/my-module/lib/aSymlinkedFolder\n/Users/isaacs/my-module/lib/aSymlinkedFolder/bar\n/Users/isaacs/my-module/lib/aSymlinkedFolder/foo\n/Users/isaacs/my-module/lib/localFolder\n/Users/isaacs/my-module/lib/localFolder/aScriptFile.js\n```\n\nwhich is identical to Bash 4.3, working as designed.\n. I am open to a \"Follow all symlinks forever\" option.  Maybe `follow:true`?  Please open a new issue requesting the feature, and if I don't get to it, maybe someone else will.  The patch to the code would be just a few lines in `glob.js` and `sync.js` to skip over the lstat stuff, but it'll need plenty of tests.\n. I don't usually delete branches. You can ignore them.\n. This project's goal is to match the behavior of Bash 4.3.  Any changes that bring it closer to the matching semantics of Bash 4.3 are considered bugfixes and bump the patch version.\n\nOpt-in features that provide alternative behavior are considered additive changes, and bump the minor version.  Minor versions may also include bugfixes.\n\nRemoval of opt-in features, or changes to the API surface, are considered breaking changes, and bump the major version.  Major versions may also include bugfixes and additive changes.\n\nIf you are a depending on a bug, then a bugfix will break your system.\n\nI'm happy to include a changelog, but I'd rather use a tool to generate it manually, as this is quite tedious.  Do you have any recommendations?\n. From #135 \n\n> I am open to a \"Follow all symlinks forever\" option. Maybe `follow:true`? Please open a new issue requesting the feature, and if I don't get to it, maybe someone else will. The patch to the code would be just a few lines in glob.js and sync.js to skip over the lstat stuff, but it'll need plenty of tests.\n. Patch welcome.  Make sure to add tests for both sync and async behavior.  The option should be `realpath:true` (to better match `stat:true` behavior).\n. Make sure to take advantage of the cache option to fs.realpath, so that it can avoid statting the same paths multiple times.\n. I see, so gulp is responding to `match` events rather than the list of all results which is sorted at the end.\n\nGlob no longer uses graceful-fs, so that would be why the change happened.\n. @contra @heikki I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news.\n\nIt turns out that sorting the readdir results isn't actually enough of a fix, and in fact, it _can't_ be reliably fixed in the general case without some truly awful things.\n\nConsider this:\n\n```\na\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 b/\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 z/\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 c/\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 z/\n```\n\nIf you glob for `a/*/z` then it does the first readdir on the `a/` dir.  Some platforms this returns `['b','c']` and others, `['c','b']`.  So, we sort it.\n\nThen, for each of those two dirs, _in parallel_, it does a `readdir` to see if there's a `z` inside.  They'll both hit the thread pool at effectively the same time, just a few ns off.  But sometimes, `readdir('a/c')` will return before `readdir('a/b')`, so even though we sort every readdir, we still get `a/c/z` before `a/b/z`.\n\nTo truly fix this, we'd have to somehow sort the `readdir` responses _and also_ sort the return processing from each child branch to manage the order that they return in.  That's way beyond my threshold for complexity.  A simpler approach would be to serialize the processing of each child dir, but then we'll be leaving a lot of performance on the table (like, 4x in some cases).\n\nWith that in mind, I'm going to revert this \"fix\", because it adds complexity and CPU cycles for no benefit.\n\nYou'll just have to handle out-of-order results.  They are sorted in the final tally, though, so you can either have them sooner (and maybe out of order), or all at once (and sorted).  Trade-off appropriately for your use case, I guess.\n. Thanks!\n. This will be fixed soon. It's a regression in minimatch. Sorry for the hassle. \n. Fixed in Glob 4.3.1\n. @StoneCypher The basic for most modules is `npm install` first to install deps, and then `npm test` to run tests.  If you find that is too much typing, then `npm i` and `npm t` also work.\n\nIn this case, it's because of a change in a dependency of a dependency, so tracking down the culprit can be a bit tricky and require human brain power.\n. Needs a test that fails without this patch, and passes with this patch.\n. Awesome, thanks.\n\nMy concern is that it's only running the test on Windows, and since most of the development (and ci) is running on unix, this won't catch it if I later break this functionality.  But now, since the tests pass on your windows system, at least I believe that it works ;)\n\nA better approach might be to mock out the parts of the system so that the functionality can be tested on a Unix system as well.  The general pattern would be something like:\n\n``` javascript\n// pretend to be windows\nprocess.platform = 'win32'\n// load glob before we muck around with fs's guts\nvar glob = require('../')\n// mock out whatever we need to\nvar originalStat = fs.stat\nfs.stat = function (path, cb) {\n  // do whatever we want, based on the path\n}\nvar originalReaddir = fs.readdir\nfs.readdir = function (path, cb) {\n  // whatever\n}\n\ntest('wildcards in unc path', function (t) {\n  glob('\\\\\\\\whatever\\\\*', function (er, results) {\n    // make sure this is what we expect\n    t.end()\n  })\n})\n```\n. It looks like this is confusing `options.realpath` and `options.follow`.\n\n`options.realpath` should make it return the realpath rather than the symlink.  But, it should _not_ change the symlink-following behavior.\n\n`options.follow` should make it follow symlinks until it hits `ELOOP`, like glob 3.x did.  But it should not cause it to realpath the results.\n\nThese should be two separate patches, each with separate tests and docs.\n. This should be a separate utility module. It is not glob's place to change the EE semantics. \n. @vegetableman The tests are thorough, and it looks like you've got the API pretty much perfect and working.  Good job!\n\nHowever, there's a **lot** of stuff in this patch that is not relevant to the change.  I started commenting on it, but gave up after a while.\n1. Single quotes have been changed to double.  Including in words like `isn't` in comments, even.  Don't do that.  This project uses single-quotes exclusively for strings, as of 82b8568.\n2. The if/else formatting has been changed in many places.  There are two ways that this project does if blocks.  If it is a single-line, it should not use braces.  If it is a multi-line, it should use braces of the form of `} else {` all on one line.\n3. Spacing around conditionals and function calls.  There should be spaces between the `if` and the opening `(` of the conditional.  Function definitions should have a space between the name and the opening `(`.\n4. Many unnecessary `setImmediate` calls are added, I'm not sure why.  They aren't relevant to this feature.  If you are finding cases with strange timing errors, please provide example code and post a new issue about that.\n\nThese things make it much harder than necessary to review the change.\n\nIn general, a commit for a feature should be as small as possible, and no smaller; it should do exactly the feature that is being added, and nothing else; it should match the style of the surrounding code so well that no one can tell that the original author didn't write it themselves.\n. Oh, also, semicolons added to line endings in many places.\n. Note: Travis error is spurious, fixed on aaffe249119c4640ed71e186d40516aa8e7e2d4e.\n\n> Is it supposed to behave differently?. right now, fetching `foo/**` and `foo/**/**/**` return the same number of results.\n\nNo, it's supposed to behave the same, but the issue is that you're doing special treatment for things that end in `/**`, and stripping it off.  Why not `.replace(/(\\/\\*\\*)+$/, '')` instead, to strip off all trailing `/**` segments?\n. Just another thought, if you have this structure:\n\n```\na\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 b/\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 bc/\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 c/\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 bc/\n```\n\nAnd you glob for `a/**/b*` with an ignore of `a/b`.\n\nWithout any ignore, you get three matches:\n\n```\n> g.sync(\"a/**/b*\")\n[ 'a/b', 'a/b/bc', 'a/c/bc' ]\n```\n\nBut with it, I'd think that only the explicit `a/b` match should be ignored.  Instead, I get:\n\n```\n> g.sync(\"a/**/b*\",{ignore: [\"a/b\"]})\n[ 'a/c/bc' ]\n```\n\nThat seems like a bug to me.  Since there are no magic chars in the ignore (eg, it's not ignoring `a/b/**` or `a/b/*` then only the explicit `a/b` match should be omitted.\n. @vegetableman I pulled in 4c71eaebe0e09e69d59d5a95bc9c58c882e0fdec\n\n```\n> g.sync('a/**/b*')\n[ 'a/b', 'a/b/bc', 'a/c/bc' ]\n> g.sync('a/**/b*', {ignore:'a/b'})\n[ 'a/c/bc' ]   <--- Expect: [ 'a/b/bc', 'a/c/bc' ]\n```\n. ```\n$ git lg -n5\n*   ddf2c1c vegetableman (HEAD, vegetableman/fix-ignore-branch) Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/master' into fix-ignore-branch (6 seconds ago)\n|\\\n| * aaffe24 isaacs (origin/master, master) make readdir-order test deterministic (48 minutes ago)\n* | 4c71eae vegetableman New: Added ignore option (fixes #115) (7 hours ago)\n|/\n* 82b8568 isaacs Settle on single quotes (4 days ago)\n* 941d53c isaacs (tag: v4.3.2, vegetableman/master) v4.3.2 (3 weeks ago)\n```\n. Still slightly incorrect.\n\n```\n> g.sync('a/**/b*')\n[ 'a/b', 'a/b/bc', 'a/c/bc' ]\n> g.sync('a/b/*')\n[ 'a/b/bc' ]\n> g.sync('a/**/b*', {ignore:'a/b/*'})\n[ 'a/c/bc' ]\n```\n\nIf you're ignoring `a/b/*`, then that should _only_ exclude files that are matched by `a/b/*`.  Since `a/b` isn't matched by `a/b/*`, it should not be excluded.\n\nAlso:\n\n```\n> g.sync('a/**/b*', {ignore:'a/**b/**'})\n[]\n```\n\nI think all the \"ends with star\" or \"ends with globstar\" bits need to be ripped out.  It's a premature optimization.\n. The principle has to be this:\n\nThe result of `glob(pattern, {ignore:set})` is equal to to the complete subset of `glob(pattern)` not found in the union of the glob expansions of every pattern in the ignore set.\n. Sorry, I was unclear.  I'm not saying that the optimization is not a requirement for release of this feature.\n\nI'm saying it's premature in advance of correct behavior.\n\nThe first step should be to implement the contract correctly, and provide a mountain of tests for every conceivable edge case. _Then_ add optimizations, each time also adding more tests to guarantee that the optimization's new edge cases don't break the contracts.\n\nI'll review again tomorrow and see if I can poke any new holes in it ;)\n. @vegetableman Thanks for your patience on this, btw.  I know it's frustrating when you make a contribution and the author puts you through the ringer, but since this module is used by many high-profile fs libs, it's important to be really careful about anything that can introduce surprising edge cases.  In the worst case, they end up depending on those bugs, and then when we fix them, it causes problems.\n. I don't think \"negative ignores\" is a good idea.  Maybe we should just throw in that case.  If you want something to not be ignored, then put it in the pattern.  It opens the door for folks to do crazy stuff like `glob('**', {ignore:['!thing-i-want', '!other-thing-i-want']})` so now we're into double-negative territory.  If that's a worthwhile use-case, then let's just add multi-glob support with some sensible API surface.\n\nAdded one minor comment, will review in more detail later.\n. Let's discuss multi-glob and streaming in other issues, plz.\n. @vegetableman Getting closer, but logic's still not quite right.\n\n```\n> g.sync('test/a/c/**')\n[ 'test/a/c',\n  'test/a/c/d',\n  'test/a/c/d/c',\n  'test/a/c/d/c/b' ]\n> g.sync('test/a/c/*')\n[ 'test/a/c/d' ]\n> g.sync('test/a/c/**', {ignore:'test/a/c/*'})\n[]\n```\n\nIn this case, it should _only_ ignore patterns that would be matched by `test/a/c/*`, that is, `test/a/c/d`.\n\nHowever, as you can see, it's failing to even explore the child directories in `test/a/c`, because of the star handling logic.  The expected value here would be:\n\n```\n> g.sync('test/a/c/**').filter(function(p) { return p !== 'test/a/c/d' })\n[ 'test/a/c',\n  'test/a/c/d/c',\n  'test/a/c/d/c/b' ]\n```\n. Ok!  Landed this on master.\n\n@vegetableman I had a few other suggestions, which were mostly pretty minor, and I went ahead and just made the changes myself.  Since we've gone back and forth a bunch on this, and you seemed to be getting something out of the process, I want to share the reasoning behind both:\n1. The two tests were merged into a single test that just lists cases and has less repeated code.  This makes it a lot easier to add new tests, and reduces the likelihood that one day we'll add a new ignore test, and forget to update the sync test as well, etc.\n2. I split up the `isIgnored` function into `isIgnored` and `childrenIgnored`, in order to remove the boolean argument.  In general, a boolean argument is often an indication that you probably are putting two different functions in the same place, and it'd be better to just have them go ahead and be two separate functions.\n3. I de-inlined the argument to `ignore.map()`, since it doesn't actually need access to the closure state.\n\nWill release with a bumped minor later today.  Might try to get a few other PRs in there as well.\n. Yeah, I'm going to deprecate comments and negation in the next major release, coming up soon.\n. `[` is a magic char in globs, just like regexps.  It'd be looking for:\n\n```\nC:\\Build\\7D - refonte\\Myproject\\\nC:\\Build\\7e - refonte\\Myproject\\\nC:\\Build\\7v - refonte\\Myproject\\\n```\n\nEscape the `[` with a `\\` char, like `\"C:\\\\Build\\\\7\\\\[Dev\\\\] - refonte\\\\\\Myproject\\\\\"` in js.\n. `*.(xxx|yyy)` isn't a valid glob pattern.  `(xxx|yyy)` is a regexp, which is equivalent to the `@(xxx|yyy)` glob pattern.\n. You'd want to do `*.@(xxx|yyy)`\n. Compare to Bash 4.3\n\n```\n$ echo *.@(xxx|yyy)\nfoo.xxx foo.yyy\n\n$ echo *.(xxx|yyy)\nbash: syntax error near unexpected token `('\n\n$ node -p \"require('../glob').sync('*.(xxx|yyy)')\"\n[]\n\n$ node -p \"require('../glob').sync('*.@(xxx|yyy)')\"\n[ 'foo.xxx', 'foo.yyy' ]\n```\n. Try this:\n\n``` javascript\nvar Glob = require('glob').Glob\nvar g = new Glob(somePattern, { stat: true })\ng.on('stat', function (file, stat) {\n  // do your stuff here\n})\n```\n. That definitely looks like a bug to me.  It should never match a file with a trailing `/`.\n. Thanks for getting this started!\n\nBefore this can be accepted, though, there are two things that need to be done.\n\nFirst, it needs a test added (something that fails before the patch, and passes with the patch).  You can either modify an existing test to add the new case, or add a new one.   (Note that if you do add a new test, you'll have to run `npm run test-regen` on a Mac or Linux box to re-generate the bash comparison test cases.)\n\nSecond, I'm pretty sure that all of these glob.sync errors are _also_ errors in the async case.  If you look through the code, you'll see that they follow one another pretty closely.  So, each of these changes in the sync flow have to have the corresponding change made in the async flow.\n\nLet me know if you are/aren't interested in doing these bits, or if you need any help with them.  Eventually, I'm sure I or someone else will get to it if you don't find the time, but it might take a bit longer to get to.\n. Fixed by 0b729c83f15c3d78f5235f893c1ed912e6386eb7.  Thanks!\n. Well, as you say, glob is working fine.\n\nI am not the maintainer of Grunt, and have no idea exactly what it's doing with glob internally.  node-glob-whatev is over 2 years old, and LOTS of bugs have been fixed since then, both on Windows and Unix.\n\nI'd try posting the bug over on grunt's issue tracker.  If it turns out glob is doing the wrong thing, then we can take a look at it.\n. Just end the pattern in a `/`.  Example:\n\n```\nglob('**/', function (er, dirs) {\n  if (er) throw er // or handle or whatever\n  console.log('all dirs:', dirs)\n})\nglob('*/', function (er, dirs) {\n  if (er) throw er // or handle or whatever\n  console.log('first-level dirs:', dirs)\n})\n```\n. Pass an `ignore: ...` option in. \n. Try this:\n\n``` javascript\nglob('**', { ignore: [ 'index.html', 'js/main.js' ], nodir: true }, console.log)\n```\n\nNegative extglob patterns like `!(foo)` cannot contain slashes.  So, another approach might be to do something like one of these, depending on how many _other_ files are in there that youer' trying to exclude.\n\n``` javascript\n> glob.sync('!(*.html)/!(main.js)', { nonegate: true })\n[ 'js/lib.js' ]\n> glob.sync('js/!(main.js)', { nonegate: true })\n[ 'js/lib.js' ]\n> glob.sync('js/!(main.js)')\n[ 'js/lib.js' ]\n```\n\n(Note that the `nonegate` is required for now to interpret the first part as a negative extglob section rather than a fully negated pattern.  The next major release will deprecate using negated patterns, in favor of using ignores instead.)\n. @iLanbiala yes it does. \n. So, lemme make sure I get this right.  You're saying that the test case in the original post here should return an empty array, and as far as I can tell, it does:\n\n```\n$ tree fixtures/\nfixtures/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 .swag\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 test.coffee\n\n0 directories, 2 files\n\n$ node -e 'require(\"./glob.js\")(\"./fixtures/*swag\", { ignore: \"./fixtures/**\", dot: true }, console.log)'\nnull []\n```\n\nIs there a simple case you can provide where that doesn't work as expected?\n. Aha!  This is two bugs, then!\n\nThe gstarmatcher thing is broken in this case, also:\n\n```\n$ node -e 'require(\"./glob.js\")(\"./fixtures/.*\", { ignore: \"./fixtures/**\" }, console.log)'\nnull []\n```\n\nIn that case, I'd expect it to only be ignoring things matched by `./fixtures/**`, ie `./fixtures/test.coffee`.\n\nIt seems reasonable to me that the options provided to the top-level matching should also be passed to the ignore matcher, so this patch gets a tentative +1 from me, once I get a chance to review in a bit more detail.\n\nRegarding the other issue, I'm not sure the best approach... dropping the optimization for `**` in an ignore seems like it's going to be problematic, since it means we have to potentially walk a huge directory tree for no reason.  On the other hand, detecting the case where this might be a problem (when `dot` isn't set and the matching pattern contains some explicit dot-portion which falls somewhere within the globstar section) is potentially tricky.  (Or maybe what I just wrote in the previous sentence is an adequate heuristic and we can go with that?)\n\nWill think on this a little bit and set a reminder to take a look at this again very soon.\n. Can you try with the patch in #227 and see if that is less surprising?\n. I'll upgrade the error message to provide clearer instructions here.\n. Spaces are a valid char to have in a filename, so no, that would mean a different thing.\n\nIf you're suggesting that we auto-trim the braced sections, that would be a breaking change and a departure from Bash behavior, so that's not going to happen.\n. What version of glob are you using?  When I set up a test to raise EACCES, it just acts as if the files aren't there, because the stats and readdirs fail.\n. What is `g.continue()`?  Are you sure you're using this module, and not something else?\n. Yeah, it should probably be doing an `lstat` to figure out existence, and then just try to `readdir` to see if it's a directory if it shows up as either a dir or symlink.\n\nGood find!  This is indeed a bug.\n. I suspect that this is causing isaacs/rimraf#65 and ember-cli/ember-cli#3413.\n. Yes, this was on purpose.\n\n`rimraf` version 2.3.0 depends on `glob@^4.4.1`, which has a bug that is not present in `glob@4.4.2`.\n\nBecause `rimraf` is so widely used, this caused a major problem for many users.\n. Discussion in https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/pull/130\n\nIf you want to run tests and benchmarks, check out the git repo.\n. I would be open to a change to support back-slashes on windows machines.  Probably the best solution would be to, on windows, replace all back-slashes with forward-slashes, and then swap back to back-slashes in the result.\n\nPart of the blocker to doing stuff for windows is that I don't have a windows environment for CI tests, and it's quite tedious to run tests in Windows since I develop in a unix environment.  Do you have any tips on this?\n. No, I mean, at the very start, we replace `\\` with `/`, so that the logic all works as it is.  Then, before emitting a `match` event or calling the cb with the results, we swap back to `\\` so that you get paths that match the system.  (Of course, this is a bit complicated, because UNC paths in windows have to remain with `/` chars.)\n\nSuch a change would have to come with tests, and I'd want to run those tests regularly to make sure they don't break.\n. Looks like this is a regression in the `cwd` handling.  @nikku, I can't reproduce your test case without setting a `cwd` option, and only in sync mode, is that what you're seeing as well?\n\n```\n$ tree test\ntest\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 posts/\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 folder/\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 a.md\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 b.md\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 c.md\n\n2 directories, 3 files\n$ cd test\n\n$ node -e 'require(\"glob\")(\"**/*\", {nodir:true}, console.log)'\nnull [ 'posts/a.md', 'posts/b.md', 'posts/c.md' ]\n\n$ node -p 'require(\"glob\").sync(\"**/*\", {nodir:true})'\n[ 'posts/a.md', 'posts/b.md', 'posts/c.md' ]\n\n$ cd ..\n\n$ node -e 'require(\"glob\")(\"**/*\", {cwd:\"test\",nodir:true}, console.log)'\nnull [ 'posts/a.md', 'posts/b.md', 'posts/c.md' ]\n\n$ node -p 'require(\"glob\").sync(\"**/*\", {cwd:\"test\",nodir:true})'\n[ 'posts',\n  'posts/a.md',\n  'posts/b.md',\n  'posts/c.md',\n  'posts/folder' ]\n```\n\nWill investigate and publish a 4.5.1 and 5.0.1 with the fix.\n. Same with non-globstar as well:\n\n```\n$ cd test\n\n$ node -e 'require(\"glob\")(\"*/*\", {nodir:true}, console.log)'\nnull [ 'posts/a.md', 'posts/b.md', 'posts/c.md' ]\n\n$ node -p 'require(\"glob\").sync(\"*/*\", {nodir:true})'\n[ 'posts/a.md', 'posts/b.md', 'posts/c.md' ]\n\n$ cd ..\n\n$ node -e 'require(\"glob\")(\"*/*\", {cwd:\"test\",nodir:true}, console.log)'\nnull [ 'posts/a.md', 'posts/b.md', 'posts/c.md' ]\n\n$ node -p 'require(\"glob\").sync(\"*/*\", {cwd:\"test\",nodir:true})'\n[ 'posts/a.md', 'posts/b.md', 'posts/c.md', 'posts/folder' ]\n```\n. No problem at all, @nikku.  Thanks for confirming.\n\nFixed on 4.5.1 and 5.0.1.\n. @dzire187 Can you clarify exactly what you mean by \"this issue\"?  Are you using exactly the same pattern and folder structure as presented in the original post, or do you have a different test case that is failing in a similar way? \n. You want minimatch, not this module. \n. Good patch, good test.  Thanks!  <3\n. Use the \"ignore\" feature.\n\n```\nglob('**/*.js', { ignore: '{c,d}/**' }, cb)\n```\n. The issue here is that you can't put slashes inside of extglob patterns.  They can only refer to path portions.\n. Yep, that's a bug.  Good find!\n. updated travis to match my other projects.\n. Doc patch welcome.\n\nThe `match` event is the specific thing that matched, as matches are found.  It is not deduplicated in the normal case, and is not yet resolved to a realpath.  If we had to move the `fs.realpath` call up earlier in the process, then this would require some inconvenient refactoring.\n. Landed on master, thanks!\n. Fixed already by another PR.\n. Landed on master.  Thanks!\n. landed, thanks!\n. This is tricky.\n\nThe idea for ignores is \"exclude all potential matches which would be returned by a search for any of the ignore patterns\".  It's not \"exclude all potential matches which refer to files that would be found by any of the ignore patterns\".\n\nSo, for example, `/a/b/c` _doesn't_ return `a/b/c` as a match, even if that file exists.\n\n```\n> matches = glob.sync('tmp/x/y/z', { cwd: '/' })\n[ 'tmp/x/y/z' ]\n> ignore = glob.sync('/tmp/x/y/z', { cwd: '/' })\n[ '/tmp/x/y/z' ]\n> require('array-intersection')(matches, ignore)\n[]\n```\n\nIf we tell it to give us the realpath value, then it'll do the right thing:\n\n```\n> real = glob.sync('tmp/x/y/z', { cwd: '/', ignore: '/private/tmp/x/y/z', realpath: true })\n[]\n```\n\nThat's because the `real` option makes it so that you only get absolute paths.\n\nIn order to satisfy the test in #190, we'd have to add a `path.resolve` and double-check any non-absolute results.  And I'm not sure it's really the ideal semantics, but it's worth discussing the trade-offs.  At least, it's a breaking change.\n\nRegarding feross/standard#116, it's worth noting that `glob('**', { ignore: gitignoreLines })` is not quite what an ignore file does, anyway.  The patterns and the file names all need to be mounted on the directory where the ignore file lives.  You could check out https://github.com/npm/fstream-ignore if you want to use the same file selection logic that npm uses for ignore files in packages.\n. In JavaScript, you must always double-up your back-slashes because backslash is the escape character.  So, for example, `a\\nx` is the string `{0x61 0x0a 0x78}` (a, LF, x), but `'a\\\\nx` is the string `{0x61 0x5c 0x6e 0x78}` (a, slash, n, x).\n\nGlob has some difficulties with UNC paths.  I'm guessing this is a duplicate of #74.\n. This is pretty close!\n\nI inadvertently optimized away your minimatch change, but then I fixed it on 2.0.7.\n\nI am still running into a bit of a weird issue with the test, because the `path-is-absolute` module is rather insistent on using `process.platform`, and it's also used throughout the codebase a bit.  I was able to get this specific test to work, but only because `isAbsolute('/baz')` is the same on Windows and Posix.\n\nI think the right approach here, though it's more lines changed, is to pass the platform as an option to Glob, and then load all the appropriate separator/absolute/etc stuff onto the glob object, so it never has to look at `process.platform` or `path.sep` or whatever.\n\nI'm thinking something like this in the `setopts` function in `common.js`:\n\n``` javascript\nself.platform = opts.platform || process.platform\nself.isAbsolute = isAbsolute[self.platform] || isAbsolute;\nself.resolve = path[self.platform].resolve || path.resolve;\nself.sep = path[self.platform].sep || path.sep;\n```\n\nAnd then, throughout `glob.js` and `sync.js`, make sure to always call the methods off of `this` rather than `path.<whatever>()` or `process.platform`.\n\nThis also means that, if at some point we need to change just one of these fields, or use AOP to debug those function calls, we can either make those fields configurable, or instantiate an object and just change the relevant bits.\n\nOf course, this can lead to glob doing something weird in some cases, but it'd make it so that we can test other windows irregularities in the future more easily, with a lot less module cache tinkering.\n\nWhat do you think?\n. I'm totally ok with involved changes that improve testability, windows support, and make the code easier to follow (including fewer hacky workarounds in tests).\n\nOf course, bigger PR size tends to make for more back and forth in the review process, but I think we're pretty aligned on what needs to happen for this.\n. UGGHHHH that's right.\n\nI'd say just skip that test in node <= 0.10.  The code should still work fine, and since this is really just a matter of string juggling stuff, it should be fine to run the tests in only later versions.\n. I'd throw something like this in there:\n\n``` javascript\nvar skip = false\nif (/^v0\\.(10|[0-9])\\./.test(process.version)) {\n  skip = 'Does not work on Node < 0.12'\n}\n\ntest('some test name', { skip: skip }, function (t) { ...\n```\n. If you wanna just leave the tests failing in 0.10, that's fine, too.  I can work it out when I merge it in.  If it's passing in 0.12 and io.js, then I can take it from there :)\n. Ok, just reviewed.  The test looks perfect, and nothing in the code jumps out at me as problematic.\n\nIf you think this is ready to go, I can merge and release this weekend or early next week.\n. It looks like the issue is that the WinPath stuff in the `setopts` function in `common.js` is messing with root and path in a weird way, such that `glob(process.cwd())` can't return anything, because it ends up having a `root` setting of `c:` and a pattern of `/path/to/cwd`.\n\nThe mocking and testing stuff looks pretty good.  I think it's the right approach.\n\nOn master right now, all the tests pass on Windows.  I'd recommend rebasing, and then applying the changes one by one and making sure that tests pass at each commit.\n. True story: I saw the title of the email and for a second I was scared this issue was a C&D from Williams St for copyright violation.\n. (or I guess it'd be Frederator? I'm not sure who owns AT.)\n. @mik01aj You should use `ignore: ['**/*-integration-test.js']`.  As you've written it, it'll only ignore `*-integration-test.js` files that are not in a sub-directory.\n. Patch welcome for this.  Probably just need to find the bits where `match` is emitted and call `isIgnored` like @mlmorg is doing in the workaround.  I'll get to it soon-ish if no one else does.  (Note that patches require a test!)\n. I've noticed that with this module, and a few others, about half the time I say \"patch welcome\" I end up just writing it later that afternoon...\n. Thanks for the report!  fixed on 5.0.7\n. Landed #222 instead, thanks.\n. I don't see the error you're describing.  How are you getting this?\n. That's totally fine in ECMAScript strict mode.  Function expressions may be in conditionals, just not function declarations.\n\nFor example, this would throw:\n\n```\n'use strict'\n\nif (true) {\n  function foo() { return 1 }\n}\n```\n\nBut this is totally fine:\n\n```\n'use strict'\n\nif (true) {\n  var foo = function foo() { return 1 }\n}\n```\n. You are getting confused about the difference between \"function declaration\" and \"function expression\".\n\nA function used as a callback like `fs.readdir(dir, function (er, entries) { ... })` is not a function declaration.  It is a function expression.\n\nFurthermore, the issue in V8's strict mode where it says \"functions can only be declared at top level or immediately within another function\", is in fact not compliant with the ES6 specification.  The actual rule is that function declarations inside of blocks in strict mode are local to the block.  Io.js and future versions of Node have newer versions of V8 which observe the ES6 specification in this regard.  Observe: https://gist.github.com/isaacs/ea2b667d7336b64843e1\n\nNo, I will not be changing node glob.  It functions properly in strict mode, both in old (incorrect) versions of V8 as well as new (correct) versions of V8.  The error you cite is not applicable in either case, because these are function expressions, not function declarations.\n. @jvoccia Right, but `L:/05**/*.dwg` ought to match the same things as `L:/05*/*.dwg`.  I gather that's the bug.\n. @jmorrisIII What's the L: drive in this case?  Network share or something?  Does it work in C:?\n. You're providing a callback to the sync glob function. That's not allowed. The error message tells you where to fix it in your code. \n. Yeah, I wonder if there are any other cases where `ENOTSUP` might be raised by `readdir` other than \"this is a regular file\".\n\nOne approach might be to stat the file when we get an `ENOTSUP` just to make sure it is a real file that exists?\n. Meh. Adding stat is a pita.  Just gonna treat ENOTSUP the same as ENOTDIR.  It already was shown on a previous `readdir` call, so it's probably there.\n. I'd rather not.\n\nMost promise libs have easy shorthands for promise-ifying a callback-taking function.  I'd rather let node-glob focus on globbing, and stick to the simplest possible API pattern for asynchrony: a function.\n. The `ignore` option is a glob pattern string.  To replicate the RegExp you're providing, it'd be `\"*wfl.d.ts\"`\n\ndoc patch welcome.\n. What version of glob are you using?  There was a very recent change to how ENOTSUP is handled.\n. Weird... I just added a test that exercises that bit of the code, and it works fine.\n\nCan you please provide a full reproducible test case, and the exact error you see when running it?\n. That's strange.  Getting an `ENOTSUP` on a readdir call should be exactly the same as getting `ENOTDIR`.\n\nAre you quite sure that it's `glob@5.0.13` that's reporting this?  Can you run `npm ls glob` to see if there are any other versions in use?\n. Ohhh... are you using `glob.sync` or `glob`?\n. Oh, sorry, I'm dumb, apparently.\n\n```\n* c47d451 isaacs (HEAD -> master, tag: v5.0.14, origin/master) v5.0.14 (12 seconds ago)\n* 821fac8 isaacs Handle ENOTSUP for sync glob as well as async (4 minutes ago)\n* 9625618 isaacs Test for when readdir raises ENOTSUP (25 hours ago)\n* 0a2b519 isaacs Generate fixtures more effectively, with -O instead of eval (9 days ago)\n* f96190b isaacs Use js for benchmark cleanup (12 days ago)\n* 957fd93 isaacs Fix some 'use strict' errors (12 days ago)\n* bf3381e isaacs Treat ENOTSUP like ENOTDIR in readdir (12 days ago)\n* 507733d isaacs (tag: v5.0.13) v5.0.13 (12 days ago)\n```\n\nNotice anything interesting?  I never released the ENOTSUP fix.  That explains it!\n\nThe good news is that I never released _half_ the ENOTSUP fix, so it now works on 5.0.14 for both sync and async glob.  Can you re-install and let me know?\n\nSorry for not catching that!\n. Can you provide a simple test script that demonstrates what you're seeing?\n\nExplaining in english < explaining in JavaScript ;)\n. I've put off adding `~` support until Node has cross-platform passwd functions (coming to io.js soon, I believe?)  Then we can do stuff like `~root/foo` and `~bob/bar` and have it expand with the home dir of the specified user.\n. @fenwick67 Is there any way to get the home directory of someone other than the current user?  (Ie, resolve something like `~root/foo` to `/root/foo` and resolve `~user/foo` to `/home/user/foo`, etc?)\n. fixed on latest release\n. `find(1)` is not the model that this module matches, but rather the globbing pattern-matching behavior in Bash 4.3.\n\n```\n$ mkdir -p dir/subdir/subsub\n$ for i in dir/**; do echo $i; done\ndir/\ndir/subdir\ndir/subdir/subsub\n```\n. Bash 3 didn't have globstar support, so of course it would not do anything special with `**`; it'd be the same as `dir/*/*`.  (You can emulate this behavior by setting `{ noglobstar: true }` in the options object.)\n\nI'm not super familiar with zsh, so I can't speak to how that works.\n. @UltCombo It's not doing globstar matching at all, that's why.  You're getting the same results as `dir/*/*`.\n\nYou can observe this if you do `mkdir -p dir/a/b/c/d/e/f/g` and see what it matches.\n. Wild!  Yeah, that's totally different.  What does `dir/**/` match?\n\n> Also, if `dir/**/*` was treated the same as `dir/*/*`, it would not match `dir/subdir` in the comment above, right?\n\nAh, good point.\n\nAnyway, zsh's globbing is not the reference implementation that this module targets :)\n. Not a node-glob issue.\n. Different versions of V8.\n\nIn 0.12:\n\n```\n$ node -p '\"abc\".localeCompare(\"XYZ\")'\n-1\n\n$ node -v\nv0.12.7\n```\n\ncompare to v0.10 (and io.js)\n\n```\n$ node -p '\"abc\".localeCompare(\"XYZ\")'\n9\n\n$ node -v\nv0.10.40\n```\n\nand io.js:\n\n```\n$ node -p '\"abc\".localeCompare(\"XYZ\")'\n9\n\n$ node -v\nv2.2.1\n```\n\nLooks like there was a bug in 0.12 that then got fixed in later versions of V8?\n. Can you share the program that's raising this error?  It doesn't look like node-glob is anywhere in that stack trace.\n. A) How would you like the API to look?  (Note that this may involve some trade-offs that turn out to not be too costly.)\n\nB) How does that differ from just using `{,,,}` to break up your patterns?  Eg, instead of doing `glob([pattern1, pattern2], cb)` you could do `glob('{' + pattern1 + ',' + pattern2 + '}', cb)`.  I guess it's different if the patterns have `,` chars in them?  Is there any other reason why this workaround is objectionable?\n. Especially: if a file matches more than one pattern, should it be included in the results more than once?  And, do you need to know which pattern a file matched?\n. I took a look at globby.  It seems like it just extends node-glob to take an array of patterns, and uses a Promise for the async API rather than a callback.\n\nUnless this feature gets a champion willing to do the work, I'm not super excited to do it myself, especially since globby already exists.  There are some interesting optimizations that could maybe be taken advantage of (like having the multiple different glob instances share cache objects, for example), but no one's complaining about the speed of globby right now.\n. This is incorrect.  In glob patterns, `?` matches exactly 1 character.\n\n```\n$ touch fo foo fob\n\n$ echo fo?\nfob foo\n\n$ node -p 'require(\"./\").sync(\"fo?\")'\n[ 'fob', 'foo' ]\n\n$ echo fo*\nfo fob foo\n\n$ node -p 'require(\"./\").sync(\"fo*\")'\n[ 'fo', 'fob', 'foo' ]\n```\n. I'm seeing files in there:\n\n```\n$ npm view glob dist.tarball | xargs curl -s | tar ztv\n-rw-r--r--  0 501    20        985 Jul 14 18:34 package/package.json\n-rw-r--r--  0 501    20      15445 Jun 18 15:23 package/README.md\n-rw-r--r--  0 501    20        765 Jul 28  2014 package/LICENSE\n-rw-r--r--  0 501    20       6155 May 21 09:44 package/common.js\n-rw-r--r--  0 501    20      18625 Jul 14 18:26 package/glob.js\n-rw-r--r--  0 501    20      11461 Jul 14 18:26 package/sync.js\n```\n\nMaybe run `npm cache clean` and try again?\n.

Aha! Turns out there was a minor operational issue this morning that resulted in a small percentage of zero-byte tarballs being served.  I should probably commit `da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709` to memory, because that shasum always indicates a problem ;)\n\nEven though it was a very small percentage, if you were one of the (un)lucky few to get it, it would be cached by the CDN, and keep serving a zero-byte response until our ops folk flushed the caches.  All should be resolved now.\n. Fixed on 7.0.2.  Thanks for finding the bug!\n. This is a bit more complicated of a situation than it might appear.  (More conversation at https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/pull/166 that might be interesting to review.)\n\nI'd like to see a lot more testing and thought around the cases here:\n1. `dot: false`, search for `a/**`, ignore `a/x/**`, file at `a/x/.y/z` exists.  Should `a/x/.y/z` be included in matches?\n2. `dot: true`, search for `a/**`, ignore `a/x/**`, file at `a/x/.y/z` exists.  Should `a/x/.y/z` be included in matches?\n3. `dot: false`, search for `a/**`, ignore `a/**/z`, file at `a/x/.y/z` exists.  Should `a/x/.y/z` be included in matches?\n4. `dot: true`, search for `a/**`, ignore `a/**/z`, file at `a/x/.y/z` exists.  Should `a/x/.y/z` be included in matches?\n\nIf the answer to (1) is \"no\", then we should set `dot: true` for the gsmatcher always.  If the answer is \"yes\", then this patch seems appropriate, but then the optimization around ignoring `**` needs to be removed, which will make things a lot more complicated.\n\nThe answer to (2) and (4) seems to be \"no\" always, so this patch looks correct from that pov.\n\nThe really tricky bit is (3), and I'm not sure I have a good answer here.  People seem to be confused either way.  It might be acceptable to just say, look, for `ignore` patterns, they match dot files, that's just how it is, as long as that's documented clearly.  Another approach might be to say that it follows the same `dot` setting as the overall pattern, which is what this patch does.\n\nTo be honest, I've been procrastinating making a decision on this because I'm not sure what the right call is, and it's probably a breaking change either way.\n\nWhat're your thoughts on this, as a person using glob in your program?\n. Other cases:\n- `dot: false`, search for `a/**/.y/z`, ignore `a/x/**`\n- `dot: true`, search for `a/**/.y/z`, ignore `a/x/**`\n\nReally, we need a comprehensive matrix of test cases and a clear decision on each one.\n. Another interesting case:\n\n`dot: false`, search for `a/**/.y`, ignore `a/x/**`.  Files at `a/x/.y` and `a/z/.y` both exist.  What gets returned?  Does it ignore `a/x/.y`, or not?  (Note that `a/x/.y` does not match `a/x/**` if `dot` is false, but it does match `a/**/.y`, because of the explicit dot.)\n\nThe more I think about this, the more I think that `dot:true` should be set for ignore patterns always.  It should be documented that way and just take the major version hit.\n. Feel free to mess around with the patch in #227 and let me know if it is more or less surprising in practice. \n. Let's simplify this a bit by looking only at the first braced group section.  Clearly it's not the second part of the pattern that's matching, since it doesn't end in `bower_components`.\n\n`**/node_modules/!(grunt*)` will match `node_modules/grunt/node_modules/foo` because the `**` matches `node_modules/grunt/node_modules` and then `foo` is not `grunt*`, so there you go.  The pattern will match any thing containing `node_modules` that doesn't _end in_ `grunt*`, so this will match most of grunt's deps.\n\nI think what you probably want is to drop the `**`, and just use this: `node_modules/!(grunt*)`, or combined with the `bower_components`, `{node_modules/!(grunt*),**/bower_components}`.\n. Landed on master, thanks.\n. If anyone wants to weigh in on the substantial change here, take a look at these test cases: https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/blob/dot-ignore/test/ignore.js#L34-L39\n\nThe relevant file structure looks like this:\n\n```\n$ tree a/{x,z}\na/x\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 .y/\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 b\na/z\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 .y/\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 b\n\n2 directories, 2 files\n```\n\nThe linked test cases go `[pattern, ignore, results]`.  So, eg, a pattern of `a/**/.y/b`, with an ignore set to `a/x/**` will prevent `a/x/.y/b` from matching, even though the `**` would not normally match the `.y` path portion.\n. Alright, the requisite time for objection and testing has passed, and it seems to make everyone's use cases better.  I'm gonna go ahead and land this.  It's a SemVer-major bump, because of the change in behavior, but it's the right change, I believe.\n. @UltCombo I don't understand the question.\n\nI think experience thus far has shown that having ignore patterns not match dot files is always more confusing than the alternative, even when the main pattern doesn't have `dot: true`.\n. Not really that interested.  Passing in a function works fine, and you can wrap it in a promise if you really need to.\n. I decided to just `<code>` them all with backticks. Thanks for the nudge :)\n. @thirdcreed Only the \"negate the whole pattern by prefixing with a !\" has been deprecated.  This kind of negation should still work.\n\n@dangreen what does your file tree look like?  What gets returned?\n. As far as I can tell, this is behaving exactly like bash 4.3\n\n```\n[gh:node-glob/master]isaacs@urdva:~/dev/js/glob/a node@v4.0.0\n$ tree\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 b/\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 c/\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 bar.dyn.css\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 foo.css\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 bar.dyn.css\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 foo.css\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 bar.dyn.css\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 foo.css\n\n2 directories, 6 files\n\n[gh:node-glob/master]isaacs@urdva:~/dev/js/glob/a node@v4.0.0\n$ for i in ./**/*!(.dyn).css ; do echo $i; done\n./b/bar.dyn.css\n./b/c/bar.dyn.css\n./b/c/foo.css\n./b/foo.css\n./bar.dyn.css\n./foo.css\n\n[gh:node-glob/master]isaacs@urdva:~/dev/js/glob/a node@v4.0.0\n$ node -p 'require(\"../\").sync(\"./**/*!(.dyn).css\")'\n[ './b/bar.dyn.css',\n  './b/c/bar.dyn.css',\n  './b/c/foo.css',\n  './b/foo.css',\n  './bar.dyn.css',\n  './foo.css' ]\n```\n\nWhat's happening here is that if you have a file like `foo.dyn.css`, then the `*` matches `fo`, and then `o.dyn` is not equal to `.dyn`, and then the `.css` matches `.css`.\n. If you do use an `ignore` pattern like @thirdcreed suggests, then it works as you probably want:\n\n```\n$ node -p 'require(\"../\").sync(\"./**/*.css\",{ignore:\"./**/*.dyn.css\"})'\n[ './b/c/foo.css', './b/foo.css', './foo.css' ]\n```\n. Indeed!  Fixed on 7.0.1.\n. It looks like the only difference is the sorting.  Can you provide the script you're using to generate this output?\n\nNote that if you set `nosort: true` in the options, then it won't be sorted.  Also, `match` events fire in whatever order they're encountered, which is different on different file systems.\n. Yeah, I see the same results on both.\n\nMy only guess is that readdir is implemented differently on one of your systems, or you're using different versions of glob.  Try calling `result.sort()` if you need a consistent ordering.\n. Without seeing the code, I have no way to know what might need to change.\n\nBut the `path.basename()` function probably will do what you want.\n. Fixed on master.  Had to bump the major, since this is raising a new error, and so it might cause a currently-working program to break.\n\nTough call, since it feels like a \"bugfix\" rather than a breaking change, but I've learned to err on the side of being overly cautious when it comes to raising errors for things that were previously allowed, even if they were incorrectly allowed.\n. No idea, sorry.  Looks like you're using glob right.\n\nDo you have a test that _doesn't_ use mocha?  I'm not very familiar with it.\n. Interesting.\n\nIf you use [tap](http://npm.im/tap) then it supports throws in async tests.  Just sayin ;)\n. If the file system is case insensitive, then this module will be case insensitive. There's not much to be done about that, since all the fs functions will play along with the \"wrong\" case. \n. It is only case preserving in some cases.  In this case, node-glob and bash do the same thing:\n\n```\n$ mkdir -p A/B/C\n$ echo a/**\na/ a/B a/B/C\n$ node -p 'require(\"./\").sync(\"a/**\")'\n[ 'a', 'a/B', 'a/B/C' ]\n```\n\nHowever, there IS a discrepancy here:\n\n```\n$ echo readme.*\nREADME.md\n$ node -p 'require(\"./\").sync(\"readme.*\")'\n[]\n```\n\nGonna open a new bug for this.  Thanks for helping to find it :)\n. Also, maybe related, but maybe a separate issue, note the difference:\n\n```\n$ echo A/**\nA/ A/B A/B/C\n\n$ echo A*/**\nA A/B A/B/C\n\n$ node -p 'require(\"./\").sync(\"A/**\")'\n[ 'A', 'A/B', 'A/B/C' ]\n\n$ node -p 'require(\"./\").sync(\"A*/**\")'\n[ 'A', 'A/B', 'A/B/C' ]\n```\n\nThe `A*/**` doesn't preserve the `/` on `A/`, but `A/**` does preserve the `/`.  Technically they're both correct results, but the difference is a minor bug.\n. Indeed!  Landed this with a comment so that I don't go breaking it again.  Thanks for the patch.\n. I have no idea what to do about this.  I don't manage the webjars repo at all, and that version range syntax is not one I'm familiar with.\n. Sorry for the delay responding to this.\n\nUnfortunately, there's a bug here.  Instead of removing the test fixture and replacing it with something else, just add the new one.

If you've got any ideas, that's welcome too :)\n. Ah, I see the problem.\n\n> This PR fixes async and sync behaviour, adds tests for both in the specific eslint use case and deals with a bash oddity: whilst *\\* doesn't follow a symlink */ will. This may be an edge-case bug in the bash implementation too - but I don't want to follow this rabbit-hole any deeper right now.\n\nUnfortunately, you'll find that this module exists at the bottom of a rather deep rabbit hole :)\n\nBy definition, from the point of view of this module, Bash 4.3's glob behavior is correct.  That's the reference implementation that this module intends to follow 100%, even when that behavior is arguably \"weird\".\n\nBy default, each of the optional flags are either true, or default behavior.  So, `follow: false` doesn't mean \"never follow symbolic links\".  It means, \"only follow symbolic links in the cases where Bash 4.3 follows symbolic links.\"  `follow: true`, on the other hand, means \"follow all symbolic links always\" (which, incidentally is how Bash 4.1 handled symlinks encountered in globstar traversals, and how this module used to do it until Bash 4.3 changed its behavior, and I locked the reference implementation version that this module targets in JavaScript.)\n\nTo deviate from Bash 4.3 behavior, we'd have to add a flag which is off by default, but we've already got a lot of flags, and adding a `nofollow: true` reminds me of spammy email opt-in/out checkboxes (\"don't not uncheck this box unless you don't want to stay unsubscribed to our newsletter\").  Plus, what do you do with `{follow:true,nofollow:true}`?\n\nWe _could_ conceivably say that `follow:false` means \"no symlinks ever\", and `follow: true` means \"follow all symlinks\", and `follow: null/undefined` means \"do what Bash 4.3 does\".  I don't love that either, because now if you just try to un-set a config by setting `globOpt.follow = false`, you can end up deviating from Bash behavior.  In my experience, the true/false/null option always just ends up getting confusing, and it's best to just keep it to 2 options with a boolean cast.\n\nSo, any of these are going to be breaking changes, and additional complexity.\n\nI'm sorry for what probably seems like unnecessarily pedantic adherence to an arbitrary code contract.  Because a lot of popular command line tools rely on this module, I've learned to be very careful about any semantic changes.\n. > But you could use `globOpt.follow = null`\n\nYes, that is what one would have to do.  But that is still a very subtle breaking change.\n\nIt's fine to say that this is \"unexpected behavior\", but it's behaving exactly like the reference implementation it's intending to emulate.  So... unexpected by whom?  If `false` and `null` start having different effects on a field that looks like a boolean flag, then that's also pretty unexpected.\n\nMaybe the answer is a `--no-glob` option for eslint?\n\nOverloading the `follow` flag is not the right call here.\n. Glob never had a \"do not follow any symlinks\" option. `follow` was added to force it to follow symlinks in globstar traversals, unlike bash. \n\nEsliny could have an option to just not use glob at all. Then you wouldn't have to worry about following symbolic links. But maybe that won't work either?\n\nI'm not sure the best answer for your use case. I know that deviating from bash behavior in this module is a bad idea, though, and pseudo-boolean-three-state option flags are flaky and error prone. \n\nYou could also turn on `realpath:true` in the glob options for eslint. Then you'll always get the full real path, and there will never be duplicates that refer to the same actual file. \n. I'm not opposed to this in principle, however:\n1. This should be a standalone module that can promisify a thing given an EventEmitter and a \"resolution\" event (with \"error\" considered the \"rejected\" event, of course).  Flow-control boilerplate doesn't belong in this module.\n2. That module should work on Nodes less than 0.12 (I'm told Bluebird is the thing all the cool kids use these days for their cross-platform promises.)  That's what's breaking the Travis-CI test.\n3. It seems like this isn't matching the Promises/A+ spec, which says that `.catch()` should behave quite a bit differently from how it's implemented here.\n\nAnother approach would be, rather than tacking `.then()` and `.catch()` onto the Glob prototype, just create a `glob.promise(pattern, [options]) => Promise` method, since that's really what you'd probably want to use anyway, and that's pretty trivial.  Might look something like this:\n\n``` javascript\nglob.promise = function (pattern, options) {\n  return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\n    var g = new Glob(pattern, options)\n    g.once('end', resolve)\n    g.once('error', reject)\n  })\n}\n```\n. Another route is just to promise up the (lower case) `glob()` function of a callback isn't provided, but if that returns a Glob instance today, it'd be a breaking change. \n. What do you get when you call `fs.statSync('deleteMe.txt')`?  Or run the glob with `glob.sync('deleteMe.txt', { stat: true })`?\n. Hm.  Ok, that seems kinda like a bug to me.  It should be handling `EPERM` from readdir calls as an indication that the thing is either not a directory or not traversable, but an `EPERM` on a file seems like it should be an error.\n\nI'll have to review the code to be sure there isn't some method to this madness, but I agree that it seems like an oversight somewhere, and I'll try to figure out what bash does.  On Unix, there's no combination of permissions that will prevent you from being able to stat a file, so this is probably just a windows-ism that I didn't think to account for.\n. Anyone affected by this error, please try the following:\n\n```\nnpm install isaacs/node-glob#fix-245\n```\n\nAnd let me know if the problem goes away.\n. @schnittstabil Do you think it _should_ return an error if `{ stat: true }` is used?\n. Right, sorry, when I said \"return an error\", I meant throw from sync or first arg to cb from async.\n\nIt's an interesting edge case.  I could see someone thinking that if they do `stat: true`, then that means that the stat call should be required to succeed.  It'd be easy enough to make it work that way.\n. @schnittstabil I can't reproduce that.  What error is thrown?  Can you provide a test program and the output of the crash?  Thanks.\n. @schnittstabil When you say \"it _throws_ an error\", what does that mean, exactly?  Being a JavaScripter, I'd assume it means something like what happens when you do `throw new Error('oops')`\n. @schnittstabil Oh, I see, so if the `fs.readdir` call gets an error, then that fails.\n\nWhat it's saying is \"this is a very strange error, and _probably_ you want to know about it, but the glob process can continue.\"  If you pass `silent: true` in as an option, then it is quiet about it.\n\nI don't know why it's warning in async and throwing in sync, though, that's strange.  It looks like readdir failures need to be cleaned up a little bit as well.  That's definitely a separate issue (though related cause.)\n. I'm not sure what this question is about, but it doesn't seem like it's about this module.\n\nDid you post this issue to the right repo?\n. You're almost there.\n\n``` javascript\nglob.sync('./routes/**/*.js').forEach(function (file) {\n  var f = file.replace(/^\\.\\/routes/, '').replace(/(index)?\\.js$/, '')\n  app.use(f, require(file))\n})\n```\n\nMaybe also relevant: https://nodejs.org/api/path.html#path_path_basename_p_ext\n. > do you think it's a good pratice expose the routes automatically like this?\n\nI have no opinion on the matter. It's your program, do as you like :)\n. Probably what you're looking for is [minimatch](http://npm.im/minimatch)\n. Hm. Yeah, that seems like a bug for sure.  `/build/goat.png` would match `c:/build/goat.png` on win32 systems, so that ignore pattern should prevent `c:/build/goat.png` from being returned in the results.\n. Sorry, I don't know what `--no-instrument-glob` means.\n\nWhat program are you running?  Does it use this module?\n. Here's the problem: without using inflight, this module can end up doing a **lot** more syscalls.\n\nDo you have a reduced test case that shows how glob leaks callbacks when a callback throws?\n. @phated Ah, this is the glob bug you were talking about!  Thanks.\n\nYes, this should be fixed with the latest `inflight` release.  \n. Interesting!  It looks like you'e running it in a working directory in the `G:` drive.  Works for me on `C:`, but it looks like I need to make that test not be drive-specific.\n. Should be fixed on 68f2509d237babec64cf03adf72531127fd80339\n. How is this different from `follow: true`?\n\nCan you explain the use case in more detail?  And, is there a way to phrase the option so that it doesn't default to `true`?  Most of the other flags default to false, and I'd prefer to stick to that model.\n. So, you want to follow symbolic links, but _not_ symbolic links that have already been traversed, is that correct?\n\nIf I'm understanding the use-case properly, you can do get almost this behavior today by setting `realpath: true` in the options.  (Then you're guaranteed to only get each path once.)\n\n```\n> require('./').sync('test/fixtures/a/symlink/**')\n[ 'test/fixtures/a/symlink',\n  'test/fixtures/a/symlink/a',\n  'test/fixtures/a/symlink/a/b',\n  'test/fixtures/a/symlink/a/b/c' ]\n> require('./').sync('test/fixtures/a/symlink/**', { follow: true }).length\n100\n> require('./').sync('test/fixtures/a/symlink/**', { follow: true, realpath: true })\n[ '/Users/isaacs/dev/js/glob/test/fixtures/a/symlink',\n  '/Users/isaacs/dev/js/glob/test/fixtures/a/symlink/a',\n  '/Users/isaacs/dev/js/glob/test/fixtures/a/symlink/a/b' ]\n```\n\nOf course, the issue is that setting `{ follow: true, realpath: true }` is filling up with duplicate symbolic links and then filtering them down at the very end.  It'd be much better for performance to call `fs.realpath` along the way instead, and avoid traversing directories multiple times if `realpath: true` is set, since they won't end up in the result set anyway.  (This would also fix the weird issue that `realpath: true` glob objects still emit `match` events with the non-realpath paths, which would be a breaking change, but an improvement, imo.)\n\nIf you want output that lists the symbolic links, but and want to follow those symbolic links, and _don't_ want them to be realpath'ed in the result set, then that's going to have to be a different option.  But I think there's a cheaper way to do that than calling `fs.realpath`.\n\n> strict option being true by default\n\nHistorical accident :)  Once upon a time, it was false by default.\n. Note that, if you don't traverse any directories that have been seen already (or worse, resolve them to a realpath along the way), then you can run into weird situations.\n\nFor example, if you have `foo/a/b/c` and `bar @-> foo`, then the pattern `{foo/a,bar/*/b/*}` would match on `foo/a` and then would have to know that it SHOULD traverse `bar` (and re-traverse bar/a) to find `bar/a/b/c`, because that path doesn't match the pattern if we're calling `bar` by its realpath name, `foo`.\n. ``` javascript\nglob('**/*.js', { exclude: '**/*.exclude.js' }, cb)\n```\n. Oh, sorry, I skimmed past that, I guess. Seems like it'd be good if that library let you pass options to glob somehow, then. \n. Am I correct in thinking this has no functional impact?\n\nThis way is fine, of course, but I usually don't accept patches that don't make some kind of measurable change.\n. @phated Thanks!\n. Fixed by falling back to the old implementation of fs.realpath on Node 6 when new errors are thrown from the `realpath` syscall.  Using http://npm.im/fs.realpath module.\n. Wow, didn't notice that uv has realpath now. \n\nSomeone should confirm that it's not using the realpath(3) UNIX function, since that's notoriously insecure. (That's why node had a realpath in JS in the first place.)\n\nIf it is, then it's better for glob to refuse to use realpath in those versions of node. \n. @TheAlphaNerd I haven't followed the conversation in depth, but I see the some ^Lift folks got involved.  If @jlamendo is happy with where node 6 lands on this, then I'm happy supporting it.\n. Digging into this more, it's almost impossible to fix without either (a) making a significant breaking change to glob, or (b) porting the pre-node6 fs.realpath into a standalone module and using that instead.  Both options are nontrivial.\n\nThe tests are breaking because Node broke behavior.  `fs.realpath` no longer works like it used to, and any module that exposed any kind of realpath API surface is almost certainly failing tests as well (provided that their test coverage was sufficient to detect it.)\n\nThe patch here simply ignores `ELOOP` errors that are raised by the fs.realpath call.  That does work in the one case where a test is failing, but digging in a bit deeper, I'm not convinced that it's the correct solution in every case.  In Node 6, node-glob simply cannot do what it used to be able to do.  I am concerned that ignoring ELOOP will violate its contract.  (Also, what about ENAMETOOLONG?  It's purely lucky happenstance that the test is not raising that instead.)\n\nIt's going to take some time to fix issues like this.  In the meantime, in my opinion, people should either know that they're using a not-ready-for-prime-time version of the platform (and thus, expect test failures), or avoid Node 6 until it and the ecosystem have had time to get stable.  This new work lands on the laps of many part-time maintainers who weren't planning for it.  I have no idea when I'll even get to it, but it's not at the top of my list.  I've already spent several hours debugging new issues that Node 6 raised.\n\nBreaking changes  break stuff.  This is what it looks like when a platform is unstable.  It's costly.\n. Already fixed, looks like?\n. The minimatch dep is already updated on latest, and hopefully 1728df825b1401351c326e04b905192debf862fb fixes the appveyor issue.  (Seems to work properly on my local Windows vm.)\n. The CI failures are because one of tap's deps added a dependency on a version of request that doesn't exist.\n\nIt's fixed, and also, I already bumped the minimatch version to `^3.0.2` before seeing this, so it's fine now.\n\nThanks.\n. Can you provide any more details?  Like, the depth of paths, pattern being used, etc?\n\nI'm sure it's something that could probably be addressed, but a reproducible test case would be the first step.\n. Yes. Pass `nodir: true` in the options object.  From the readme:\n\n> - `nodir` Do not match directories, only files. (Note: to match only directories, simply put a `/` at the end of the pattern.)\n. I don't know what `glob-all` is, but this is working for me.\n\n```\n$ tree\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 css/\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 one.css\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 one.txt\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 two.css\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 two.txt\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 js/\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 one.js\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 one.txt\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 two.js\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 two.txt\n\n2 directories, 8 files\n\n$ for i in */*.!(css|js); do echo $i; done\ncss/one.txt\ncss/two.txt\njs/one.txt\njs/two.txt\n\n$ node -p 'require(\"glob\").sync(\"*/*.!(css|js)\")'\n[ 'css/one.txt', 'css/two.txt', 'js/one.txt', 'js/two.txt' ]\n```\n. @jrbenito Doesn't make a different in this case.\n\n```\n$ node -p 'require(\"glob\").sync(\"*/*.!(css|js)\")'\n[ 'css/one.txt', 'css/two.txt', 'js/one.txt', 'js/two.txt' ]\n\n$ node -p 'require(\"glob\").sync(\"**/*.!(css|js)\")'\n[ 'css/one.txt', 'css/two.txt', 'js/one.txt', 'js/two.txt' ]\n```\n\nWhat version of node-glob are you using?  Run `npm ls glob`.\n. Ah, you've got a filename with multiple parts.  I missed that!  So yes, you'll have to use that more complicated pattern, then.\n\nWhat `*.!(js|css)` says is \"some characters, followed by a dot, followed by something that isn't `js` or `css`, followed by the end of the string\".  So, if you have `multi.part.js` then you have `multi` (some characters) followed by `.`, followed by `part.js` (which isn't `js` or `css`).\n\nWhat `*.!(*(*.)js|*(*.)css)` says is \"some characters, followed by a dot, followed by something that is not zero or more instances of (character followed by dot) and then `js` or zero or more (characters followed by a dot) and then `css`\".\n\nIf you were comfortable getting file entries that don't have dots in them (which will mostly be folders, but you can avoid by using the `nodir` option passed to glob) you can use the somewhat simpler pattern `**/!(*.css|*.js)`, which says \"something that isn't `*.js` or `*.css`.\n\nThis matches bash's pattern matching logic:\n\n```\n$ for i in **/*.!(css|js); do echo $i; done\ncss/multi.part.css\ncss/multi.part.js\ncss/multi.part.txt\ncss/one.txt\ncss/two.txt\njs/multi.part.css\njs/multi.part.js\njs/multi.part.txt\njs/one.txt\njs/two.txt\n\n$ for i in **/*.!(*(*.)css|*(*.)js); do echo $i; done\ncss/multi.part.txt\ncss/one.txt\ncss/two.txt\njs/multi.part.txt\njs/one.txt\njs/two.txt\n\n$ for i in **/!(*.css|*.js); do echo $i; done\ncss\ncss/multi.part.txt\ncss/one.txt\ncss/two.txt\njs\njs/multi.part.txt\njs/one.txt\njs/two.txt\n```\n. It is correct that slashes do not work inside of extglob patterns such as `!(a|b)`.  Those can only be used to indicate path parts, not entire paths.  This is how Bash works as well.  In that case, the pattern is read as a file named `b)` inside of a folder named `!(a`, which is weird, but not impossible.\n\nThat being said, you _have_ found a bug here, because it should not throw if you use a pattern like that.\n. You can take a look at how fstream-ignore does it.  That's what npm uses for .npmignore files.  https://github.com/npm/fstream-ignore\n. This is a result of passing an empty string to hasMagic.\n\nIt's fixed in the latest release.\n. Note: You should probably investigate why you're calling `rimraf('')` though.  That seems like a bug that will result in attempting to recursively delete the current working directory.  Are you _sure_ that's what you want to do?\n. Well, this is weird.  Glob can't very well give you a list of files if it can't list the files in a directory.  I'm not sure how I'd even go about addressing that.\n. I'd still call this a bug.  `c:\\\\*` should be functionally equivalent to `/*` on Windows.\n. Something like this?\n\n``` js\n// gs.js\nvar Readable = require('stream').Readable\nvar util = require('util')\nvar glob = require('./')\n\nmodule.exports = GlobStream\n\nutil.inherits(GlobStream, Readable)\n\nfunction GlobStream (pattern, options) {\n  Readable.call(this, { objectMode: true })\n  this._glob = new glob.Glob(pattern, options)\n  this._glob.on('match', function (filename) {\n    if (!this.push(filename)) {\n      this._glob.pause()\n    }\n  }.bind(this))\n  this._glob.on('end', function () {\n    this.push(null)\n  }.bind(this))\n}\n\nGlobStream.prototype._read = function () {\n  this._glob.resume()\n}\n```\n\nUsage:\n\n``` js\nvar GS = require('./gs.js')\nvar gs = new GS('**/*.js')\ngs.on('data', function (filename) {\n  console.log('%j', filename)\n})\ngs.on('end', function () {\n  console.log('END')\n})\n```\n. Anyway, yes, you can pause() whenever, and you should get no match events while paused.  But if your goal is to push it into a stream, then the stream can handle a few pushes while it's buffering.\n. I would accept a PR to add something like this, yes.  Maybe just `absolute: true` as an option.\n. I think you could basically just `this.emit('match', this._absolute ? abs : e)` in that function, and set `this._absolute = !!options.absolute` in the ctor.  Then tests and docs, and you're done :)\n. Published as 7.1.0.  Thanks!\n. Thanks! this'll go out in the next release.  I also wanna fix the thing with the stat errors on Windows, in #245.\n. The object is not filled up synchronously, even on a non-network drive it'll be empty.\n\nTry this:\n\n``` js\nvar g = new glob.Glob(pattern, options)\ng.on('end', function (matches) {\n  if (g.found.length > 0) { ... whatever ... }\n})\n```\n\nOr, perhaps simpler:\n\n```\nvar g = new glob.Glob(pattern, options, function (error, matches) {\n  if (error) { ... handle error ... }\n  if (g.found.length > 0) { ... whatever ... }\n})\n```\n. I'm not interested in maintaining version, description, and dependency information in more than one place.\n\nYou are welcome to float this patch on your own branch, and use that with bower.\n. You don't have to do anything special to clean up the memory.  Just remove references to it.\r\n\r\nIf you put the glob object in a list, you can kill whatever it's currently doing by calling `myGlob.abort()`.  You can see its results by listening for the `end` event.  If you just want to check on it some time later, you can do something like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar myGlob = new Glob(somePattern)\r\nmyGlob.on('end', function () {\r\n  this.done = true\r\n})\r\n\r\n// some time later...\r\n\r\nif (myGlob.done) {\r\n  console.log('it is done', myGlob.matches)\r\n} else {\r\n  console.log('still working')\r\n}\r\n```. Thanks!. Probably the command-line specific stuff shouldn't be in this library.  A lot of cli stuff does use node-glob to parse path options, especially since the shell doesn't do that for you on windows.\r\n\r\nWhat would you want to add here?. > Is there a minimum Node version supported by node-glob?\r\n\r\nYes, but it's 0.10 :)\r\n\r\nIf I had to guess, what's happening is that some module is requiring `glob`, but isn't listing it as a dependency or peer dependency.  But, since some _other_ module in your tree requires glob, it \"works by accident\" in npm version 3 and above, because of tree-flattening.\r\n\r\nRun `npm i glob -S` in your project and see if that fixes it.\r\n. You're installing an outdated version of glob, then.  Upgrade to the latest and greatest.. Yeah, what @bitstrider said.\r\n\r\nGlobs are not regular expressions.  Type `man bash` in your terminal, and look for the section on Pattern Matching.. https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/commit/057569cbcde510173a79b2d668e808023c09bb01. fixed on head, or npm install glob\n. I'm not familiar with ndistro.  Wanna submit a patch to make it work?  What's involved?\n\nnode-glob works fine with npm.\n. NetBSD has an implementation that's BSD-licensed.  So that'd work.\n. Implemented in v2.0.0\n. implemented in 2.0.0.  `require('glob').glob` has the `GLOB_` constants, and `require('glob').fnmatch` has the `FNMATCH_` constants.\n. Whoops!  Thanks.\n. Closed by f3e2da0ea0e0989e0d337bd487e8d246405704ff Add strlcpy if not defined\n. thanks :)\n. Fixed on version 2.0.4\n. Yep :)\n\nJust have to figure out how to make it build on Solaris, now.\n. What's `uname -a` say?\n. Should work on linux now.  Just published the fixes.\n. dachev: Can you pull the latest source from github and run `node-waf configure build` on it?\n. If it works with what's in git HEAD right now, then that's fantastic. I still need to get it to build properly on Solaris, and then I'll npm publish again and update this issue so you all get emailed about it.\n. Ok, try 2.0.4, just published.  Should build and run properly on Mac, Linux, and Solaris.\n. Will be solved by #23\n. That was supposed to be for #48, whoops.\n. Could it be that npm isn't re-building the bundles?  What version of npm are you using?\n. If you do `npm bundle rebuild glob` then does it work?  What's the output of npm when you install the package with the bundled glob in it?\n. Great!  The good news is that I just checked, and this is already\nfixed in 1.0.  Since you've got a workaround, I'm gonna go ahead and\nnot bother investigating whatever is broken in 0.3.15 :)\n. 1. what version of glob are you using?\n2. what operating system?\n3. what version of node?\n4. I'm pretty sure `*/.js` is not going to match anything.  Sure you didn't mean `*.js`?\n. Ok, cool.  See if the problem goes away by upgrading node to 0.4.5 (it might).\n\nI'm going to port glob to be just in js soon.  It won't be quite as fast, but it will be way more stable and portable that way.\n. You could maybe do `path.resolve(\"./**/*.js\")` then, in the meantime.\n\nIf you could run it in gdb, I'd love a stack trace.  Otherwise closing this for now.\n. ```\necho 'require(\"glob\").glob(\"./**/*.js\", function (er, paths) { console.error(er, paths) })' > g.js\ngdb node\n# in gdb:\nset args g.js\nrun\n```\n\nThe \"help\" command is helpful :)\n. Ah, right, so, at that point, do this:\n\n```\n(gdb) backtrace\n```\n\nI can repro this on my linux box (was missing something obvious before).  Here's what I'm seeing:\n\n```\n#0  0x00007fffd1f9a4d1 in g_lstat (fn=0x0, sb=0x0, pglob=0x0) at ../deps/glob/glob.c:1156\n#1  0x00007fffd1f998e8 in glob3 (pathbuf=0x7ffff7e18e40, pathend=0x7ffff7e18e8e, pathlim=0x7ffff7e1ae40, pattern=0x7ffff7e1ae9a, restpattern=0x7ffff7e1aea2, \n    pglobstar=0x7ffff7e1aea2, pglob=0xc16490, limit=0x7ffff7e1ef60) at ../deps/glob/glob.c:827\n#2  0x00007fffd1f99652 in glob2 (pathbuf=0x7ffff7e18e40, pathend=0x7ffff7e18e8e, pathlim=0x7ffff7e1ae40, pattern=0x7ffff7e1ae9a, pglob=0xc16490, \n    limit=0x7ffff7e1ef60) at ../deps/glob/glob.c:766\n#3  0x00007fffd1f9983f in glob3 (pathbuf=0x7ffff7e18e40, pathend=0x7ffff7e18e8e, pathlim=0x7ffff7e1ae40, pattern=0x7ffff7e1ae94, restpattern=0x7ffff7e1ae98, \n    pglobstar=0x7ffff7e1ae94, pglob=0xc16490, limit=0x7ffff7e1ef60) at ../deps/glob/glob.c:821\n#4  0x00007fffd1f99652 in glob2 (pathbuf=0x7ffff7e18e40, pathend=0x7ffff7e18e8e, pathlim=0x7ffff7e1ae40, pattern=0x7ffff7e1ae94, pglob=0xc16490, \n    limit=0x7ffff7e1ef60) at ../deps/glob/glob.c:766\n#5  0x00007fffd1f99d26 in glob3 (pathbuf=0x7ffff7e18e40, pathend=0x7ffff7e18e7c, pathlim=0x7ffff7e1ae40, pattern=0x7ffff7e1ae94, restpattern=0x7ffff7e1ae98, \n    pglobstar=0x7ffff7e1ae94, pglob=0xc16490, limit=0x7ffff7e1ef60) at ../deps/glob/glob.c:931\n#6  0x00007fffd1f99652 in glob2 (pathbuf=0x7ffff7e18e40, pathend=0x7ffff7e18e7c, pathlim=0x7ffff7e1ae40, pattern=0x7ffff7e1ae94, pglob=0xc16490, \n    limit=0x7ffff7e1ef60) at ../deps/glob/glob.c:766\n#7  0x00007fffd1f99d26 in glob3 (pathbuf=0x7ffff7e18e40, pathend=0x7ffff7e18e74, pathlim=0x7ffff7e1ae40, pattern=0x7ffff7e1ae94, restpattern=0x7ffff7e1ae98, \n    pglobstar=0x7ffff7e1ae94, pglob=0xc16490, limit=0x7ffff7e1ef60) at ../deps/glob/glob.c:931\n#8  0x00007fffd1f99652 in glob2 (pathbuf=0x7ffff7e18e40, pathend=0x7ffff7e18e74, pathlim=0x7ffff7e1ae40, pattern=0x7ffff7e1ae94, pglob=0xc16490, \n    limit=0x7ffff7e1ef60) at ../deps/glob/glob.c:766\n#9  0x00007fffd1f99d26 in glob3 (pathbuf=0x7ffff7e18e40, pathend=0x7ffff7e18e64, pathlim=0x7ffff7e1ae40, pattern=0x7ffff7e1ae94, restpattern=0x7ffff7e1ae98, \n    pglobstar=0x7ffff7e1ae94, pglob=0xc16490, limit=0x7ffff7e1ef60) at ../deps/glob/glob.c:931\n#10 0x00007fffd1f99652 in glob2 (pathbuf=0x7ffff7e18e40, pathend=0x7ffff7e18e64, pathlim=0x7ffff7e1ae40, pattern=0x7ffff7e1ae94, pglob=0xc16490, \n    limit=0x7ffff7e1ef60) at ../deps/glob/glob.c:766\n#11 0x00007fffd1f99d26 in glob3 (pathbuf=0x7ffff7e18e40, pathend=0x7ffff7e18e58, pathlim=0x7ffff7e1ae40, pattern=0x7ffff7e1ae94, restpattern=0x7ffff7e1ae98, \n    pglobstar=0x7ffff7e1ae94, pglob=0xc16490, limit=0x7ffff7e1ef60) at ../deps/glob/glob.c:931\n#12 0x00007fffd1f99652 in glob2 (pathbuf=0x7ffff7e18e40, pathend=0x7ffff7e18e58, pathlim=0x7ffff7e1ae40, pattern=0x7ffff7e1ae94, pglob=0xc16490, \n    limit=0x7ffff7e1ef60) at ../deps/glob/glob.c:766\n#13 0x00007fffd1f99d26 in glob3 (pathbuf=0x7ffff7e18e40, pathend=0x7ffff7e18e44, pathlim=0x7ffff7e1ae40, pattern=0x7ffff7e1ae94, restpattern=0x7ffff7e1ae98, \n    pglobstar=0x7ffff7e1ae94, pglob=0xc16490, limit=0x7ffff7e1ef60) at ../deps/glob/glob.c:931\n#14 0x00007fffd1f99652 in glob2 (pathbuf=0x7ffff7e18e40, pathend=0x7ffff7e18e44, pathlim=0x7ffff7e1ae40, pattern=0x7ffff7e1ae94, pglob=0xc16490, \n    limit=0x7ffff7e1ef60) at ../deps/glob/glob.c:766\n#15 0x00007fffd1f991ea in glob1 (pattern=0x7ffff7e1ae90, pglob=0xc16490, limit=0x7ffff7e1ef60) at ../deps/glob/glob.c:670\n#16 0x00007fffd1f99063 in glob0 (pattern=0x7ffff7e1cf50, pglob=0xc16490, limit=0x7ffff7e1ef60) at ../deps/glob/glob.c:616\n#17 0x00007fffd1f98697 in globexp1 (pattern=0x7ffff7e1cf50, pglob=0xc16490, limit=0x7ffff7e1ef60) at ../deps/glob/glob.c:333\n#18 0x00007fffd1f985aa in myglob (pattern=0xbe46c8 \"./**/*.js\", flags=33920, errfunc=0, pglob=0xc16490) at ../deps/glob/glob.c:306\n#19 0x00007fffd1f97269 in EIO_Glob (req=0xc164f0) at ../src/glob.cc:86\n#20 0x0000000000542890 in eio_execute (thr_arg=<value optimized out>) at ../deps/libeio/eio.c:1826\n#21 etp_proc (thr_arg=<value optimized out>) at ../deps/libeio/eio.c:1635\n#22 0x00007ffff683aa04 in start_thread () from /lib/libpthread.so.0\n#23 0x00007ffff65a3d4d in clone () from /lib/libc.so.6\n#24 0x0000000000000000 in ??

Hopefully not too many people published binary packages!  Thanks for the heads-up.\n. Those are fine.\n. Will be solved by #23\n. If at all possible, it's best to use npm 1.0, _especially_ if you prefer the \"bundle\" approach to dependency management.\n\nThis is a known issue with npm 0.x when bundling packages that have build steps, and will not be fixed.\n. The fix will be to port it to use my js implementation.  I've got most of the parts already, just need to assemble them behind the same API that glob has.\n. Does it work using node stable (v0.4.11)?\n. I'm going to port this to a pure JavaScript version.  Keeping this portable is too annoying.\n. Use node stable, v0.4\n. Has nothing to do with lion.  It doesn't work with node 0.5\n. Check out `minimatch`.  It's what I've been using in npm to parse globs.\n. mimimatch is this: https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch or `npm install minimatch`\n. No, the plan is to use minimatch's matching, but add file system traversal, so that it's the same API.\n\nI'm not interested in porting bsdglob.c.\n. Yes, that is the plan.\n\nOn Fri, Nov 18, 2011 at 16:08, August Lilleaas\nreply@reply.github.com\nwrote:\n\n> So the plan is to update the glob module by depending on minimatch and using the fs module to traverse the file system?\n> \n> ---\n> \n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\n> https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/issues/23#issuecomment-2796183\n. Done.\n. No longer a C program.  Should work fine now.\n. The scons build system is going away, so this is at best a stop gap measure.  But it seems like a pretty reasonable stop-gap, so why not?\n\nLanded on master, published as 2.1.0\n. This should work well on Windows using recent versions of node 0.6.  Please comment here with more details and I'll reopen the issue if it's still a problem.\n. d'oh.  Thanks!\n\nMerged into master and --force published to npm.\n. What for?  https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/commit/d344c63cd0a802d6f9c30d2886a77173fa8ac88c\n. Sorry, @TooTallNate beat you to this one.\n. Nice find.  I'm a bit ashamed I missed that, it's so obvious.  Fix coming very soon.\n. Yeah, it's a bug.  Haven't had a chance to fix it yet.\n\nThe solution is to detect whether each pattern in the set is absolute or not, and only strip the cwd from each result if it was not an absolute pattern.\n\nAlso, weird though it may be, there were previous cases where `{/foo,/foo}` would return the same thing more than once, so each match needs to be tied to a given glob in the set.  That's the ultimate solution, though @TooTallNate's workaround is ok for the short-term.\n. Fixed on master, published as glob 3.1\n. Yeah, that's a bug.\n. Can you please try with the latest push to master?  Also published as glob@3.1.0.\n. Could you explain a little bit what \"not working for me at all now\" means?\n\nIs it throwing an error?  Hanging?  Doesn't install?\n. Aha.  It's getting confused when the cwd isn't process.cwd.\n. v3.1.3 should have what you need.  Thanks!\n. `root` is used when you want patterns starting with `/` to be interpreted as being in some specific directory.\n\nSeems like that's broken atm too, though.\n. Say you have this structure:\n\n```\na\n+-- b\n|    `-- c\n+-- c\n```\n\nThen `glob('/c', {root: 'a', cwd: 'a/b'})` would match `a/c` but not `a/b/c`.  If you drop the slash, then you see that `glob('c', {root:'a',cwd:'a/b'})` would match the `a/b/c` file, but not the `a/c` file.\n\nWhat's not immediately clear is how best to express this in the results.  I'm thinking that any and all patterns that start with `/` should show up in the results as a full absolute path, with the `root` config pre-pended.\n\nAnother option would be to resolve everything against the cwd, but that breaks the symmetry with how it works by default, when cwd is process.cwd(), and root is /.  The \"evil owl\" pattern `{*,/*}` returns `/etc, /usr, /home, etc...` for the \"absolute\" part, but `foo, bar, baz, ...` for the \"relative\" part.\n\nSetting a root is important for handling situations like ignore files.  `/foo.txt` in a .gitignore will prevent `./foo.txt` from being included, but not `./bar/foo.txt`.\n\nWhen building a tarball or something, though, you probably don't want to get the full path, since that'll result in adding a bunch of noise into your tarball, so this will have to be configurable, with the default perhaps being to prepend the root, and an option to disable, akin to rsync's '--no-implied-dirs' option.\n. Because the default `root` is `/`, not the cwd.  The evil owl `{/*,*}` needs to return everything in `/` as well as everything in `.`.  So, by default, yes it _is_ prefixed.\n\nIf you want to disable this, set `{ nomount: true }` in the options object.\n. The glob tests are a little tricky right now.  You have go have bash4 installed, and turn on extglob and globstar in your shell.\n\nIt'd be nice to bundle a standalone bsdglob or something for reference, but I haven't done that yet.\n.

Try `**/*.txt`.  See the documentation in the minimatch readme file.\n\nTHe stray console.error is removed on 3.1.2.\n. Use node 0.6.\n. Nevertheless, fixed in glob 3.1.6 :)\n. I don't know what you're actually asking for.  What change would have to be made in node-glob?\n. I see.  Yes, supporting an array of glob patterns is planned for ignorefile support, but it'll probably be a different module.  Something like this:\n\n``` javascript\nvar mg = new MultiGlob(['a/b/c', 'd/e', '!test'], options)\nmg.on('match', doSomething)\n```\n\nIf it turns out to not be much of a change, or too difficult to do externally, I might fold this into node-glob directly, and just have Glob take an array or a single pattern. Would this API satisfy your use-case?\n. Turns out this is complicated and hard, and I ended up doing IgnoreFile as its own module.\n. e8f420866ebf4aed0f2e043dcda2dbb23a650889\n. Oh, also, 83939fc8bcbc330d2baff92936e2ce589d2c71c2\n. Landed on 7246f640be49401845d7935f9ec2f07137c39a5d, published as 3.1.7, thanks!\n. Doing gitignore handling is a much more involved process, since it requires the ability to pause and resume the walk at any arbitrary point.\n\nI write https://github.com/isaacs/fstream-ignore to do this.  It's very extensible.  I'm using it in https://github.com/isaacs/fstream-npm.  However, if you just want the list of matches, it's a bit heavy, since it stats and reads every file.\n\nIf you want to add this functionality to glob, it should be a separate module.  This is strictly an implementation of glob(3) in javascript.\n. Fixed in the latest release.\n. Confirmed.  That is a bug.\n. Working on latest release.\n. Yep.  That's the bug, alright.  Thanks.\n. I'm gonna call that a wontfix.  If you have a patch that does this in some elegant way, then fine, but otherwise just normal paths work with glob.\n. Landed on 3.1.14.  Thanks!\n. > it appears that graceful-fs is causing hanging write operations.\n\nWhat does this mean?  Can you provide a test-case that reproduces what you're talking about?\n. Fixed on isaacs/node-graceful-fs@3f391309b97e5c61bb8cf633911d0a02f095b024\n\nThanks!\n. +1. Patch welcome.\n. Fixed by 1b0c060, put the wrong issue number in it.\n. Interesting. So the directory filtering is failing.\n. Yeah, definitely a bug.  Patch welcome.\n. Works properly on Unix.\n. Seems like it works properly on Windows as well:\n\n```\nC:\\globtest\\node-glob\\test>cat g.js\nvar glob = require('glob');\nvar path = require('path');\n\nglob(__dirname + '/**/*', function (err, matches) {\n console.log(matches); // matches is ok\n});\n\nC:\\globtest\\node-glob\\test>node g.js\n[ 'C:\\\\globtest\\\\node-glob\\\\test/00-setup.js',\n  'C:\\\\globtest\\\\node-glob\\\\test/bash-comparison.js',\n  'C:\\\\globtest\\\\node-glob\\\\test/bash-results.json',\n  'C:\\\\globtest\\\\node-glob\\\\test/cwd-test.js',\n  'C:\\\\globtest\\\\node-glob\\\\test/g.js',\n  'C:\\\\globtest\\\\node-glob\\\\test/mark.js',\n  'C:\\\\globtest\\\\node-glob\\\\test/pause-resume.js',\n  'C:\\\\globtest\\\\node-glob\\\\test/root-nomount.js',\n  'C:\\\\globtest\\\\node-glob\\\\test/root.js',\n  'C:\\\\globtest\\\\node-glob\\\\test/zz-cleanup.js' ]\n```\n. This is using glob 3.1.17, btw.\n. I installed the msysutil suite with git, but it's normal cmd otherwise.  I just don't know most of the windows equivalents.\n\nWhat is the actual output?\n. That is, what is the output if `glob(__dirname + '/**/*')` vs the output of `glob('**/*')`?\n. Also, what is `node -v`?\n. Type Alt-Space, E, K, then select with your mouse, then press Enter.  This copies the output to your clipboard, and you can paste it into a code block with ```\n. Put a `/` in front of `'test'`.  Echo out the actual path that you're globbing, you'll see the problem right away, I'm sure.  (`__dirname` doesn't end in a slash.)\n. ``` diff\n-glob(__dirname + 'test/**/*', function (err, matches) {\n+glob(__dirname + '/test/**/*', function (err, matches) {\n```\n. Aha!  Ok, reproducing now:\n\n``` javascript\nvar glob = require('glob');\n\nvar p1 = 'test/**/*';\nglob(p1, function (err, matches) {\n    console.log(p1, matches);\n});\n\nvar p2 = __dirname + '/' + p1;\nglob(p2, function (er, matches) {\n    console.log(p2, matches);\n});\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nc:\\globtest\\Helena>node test.js\nc:\\globtest\\Helena/test/**/* []\ntest/**/* [ 'test/asdasd.txt',\n  'test/dir',\n  'test/dir/a.txt',\n  'test/dir/b.txt',\n  'test/dsadsa.txt' ]\n```\n\nFolder structure:\n\n```\ntest/\ntest/asdasd.txt\ntest/dir/\ntest/dir/a.txt\ntest/dir/b.txt\ntest/dsadsa.txt\n```\n. Now I'm confused about why it's working sometimes, but not in this specific case...  Very strange.\n. @satazor Separate issue.  Please file a separate bug with a reproduction case.\n. I see this.  Can you please try with 3.1.19?  Should be fixed now.\n. Debug messages are fixed by #55\n. Hm, I can't seem to reproduce.\n\n```\nc:\\globtest\\node-glob>node g.js\nc:\\globtest\\node-glob\\ [ 'c:/globtest/node-glob/' ]\nc:\\globtest\\node-glob [ 'c:/globtest/node-glob/' ]\n\nc:\\globtest\\node-glob>cd test\n\nc:\\globtest\\node-glob\\test>node ../g.js\nc:\\globtest\\node-glob\\ [ 'c:/globtest/node-glob/' ]\nc:\\globtest\\node-glob [ 'c:/globtest/node-glob/' ]\n\nc:\\globtest\\node-glob\\test>cp ../g.js ./g.js\n\nc:\\globtest\\node-glob\\test>node g.js\nc:\\globtest\\node-glob\\test\\ [ 'c:/globtest/node-glob/test/' ]\nc:\\globtest\\node-glob\\test [ 'c:/globtest/node-glob/test/' ]\n\nc:\\globtest\\node-glob\\test>cd ..\n\nc:\\globtest\\node-glob>cd ..\n\nc:\\globtest>cd ..\n\nc:\\>node c:\\globtest\\node-glob\\test\\g.js\nc:\\globtest\\node-glob\\test\\ [ 'c:/globtest/node-glob/test/' ]\nc:\\globtest\\node-glob\\test [ 'c:/globtest/node-glob/test/' ]\n\nc:\\>z:\n\nZ:\\>node c:\\globtest\\node-glob\\test\\g.js\nc:\\globtest\\node-glob\\test\\ [ 'c:/globtest/node-glob/test/' ]\nc:\\globtest\\node-glob\\test [ 'c:/globtest/node-glob/test/' ]\n```\n\nIs it possible that you were using a different version of glob or something?\n. Any chance to try to repro this?\n. Actually, this seems to work for me.\n\n``` javascript\n// t.js\nvar glob = require('glob');\nvar assert = require('assert');\n\nglob(__dirname + '\\\\', { mark: true }, function (err, matches) {\n    // Should contain the dirname with / on the end\n    console.log(matches);\n    console.log(\"glob version %s\", require('glob/package.json').version);\n    console.log(\"node version %s\", process.version);\n    assert.equal(matches[0], __dirname.replace(/\\\\+/g, '/') + '/');\n    console.log('ok');\n});\n```\n\n```\nC:\\globtest\\x>C:\\node-v0.10.12\\Release\\node.exe t.js\n[ 'C:/globtest/x/' ]\nglob version 3.1.14\nnode version v0.10.12\nok\n```\n\nAre you sure you're using the latest version of glob?\n. Note, a \"fresh install of windows\" doesn't matter if you're using an old install of node and glob.  Do `npm ls glob` to see which version you're using, and `npm install glob@latest` to make sure to install the latest one.\n. Ha!  I was the one using an outdated glob!

Yes, I'm emulating windows 7 in VMWare.  I don't have a \"real\" bare-metal windows machine.\n. Fixed on latest release.  Issue was that `path.resolve()` removes trailing slashes.\n. Whoops!  Sorry, thought i'd removed those already.  Landed on master.\n. done on 3.2\n. landed in master, thanks.\n. Very tricksy!  The reason is that, if you don't have any magic in the pattern, glob \"shortcuts\" and just checks for the exact string you gave it.  Since it's a case-sensitive file system, that means that it will only find that one exact thing, regardless of the `nocase` flag.\n\nIt would be nice if there were a way to detect a case-sensitive file system, but afaik, there is no such way.  I think perhaps we just need to treat `nocase` patterns as if they had magic at all levels, even if they don't.  Consider this:\n\n```\nmkdir /tMp\ntouch /tmp/foo\ntouch /tmp/fOo\ntouch /tMp/Foo\ntouch /tMp/foO\n\nglob.sync('/tmp/foo', {nocase: true})\n// expect all 4, so we need to test *every* part of the pattern!\n```\n\nA test would be awesome.  The only way I can see to test this would be to mock out the fs object, which is tedious, but not super hard.  You've messed around with glob a lot, wanna try writing a patch?  Probably just a matter of changing some check somewhere to assume that patterns are always magical if nocase is set.\n. I think it's just in minimatch, iirc.  Search for `hasMagic`.  It should\ndefault to `true` if nocase is set.  I think it currently defaults to\nfalse, then gets set to true if there are any magic chars.  If there's no\nmagic, then it returns a string instead of a regexp.\n\nOn Thu, Feb 21, 2013 at 7:45 AM, Ben Alman notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Is this entirely handled in minimatch, or is it in glob as well?

Patch welcome\n. Landed in 3.2.1\n. Yep, this is a bug.\n. It's not property respecting the `this.minimatch.negate` flag, which should flip all the comparisons.\n. Patch welcome.\n. I'm not familiar with glob-whatev.  But this module should behave 100% the way that the documentation says it does.  If you find a case where it doesn't, then that's a bug.\n\nBy default, it supports everything under \"Pattern Matching\" in `man bash`, except for Tilde Expansion, and adds \"negation\" as well (like in .gitignore file patterns).  You can turn off any options you want.\n. Er, turn off any options you _don't_ want, I guess ;)\n. Issues on this repo are for bugs in this repo.  It's not an effective way to post a question to users of node-glob, since most of them never see this page.\n\nIt'd be better to post to the nodejs mailing list, probably.\n. Right, I see why this is happening.\n\nLet's say you have a tree like this:\n\n```\n.\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 y/\n \u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 d/\n \u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 e.c\n \u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 a\n \u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 a.c\n \u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 b\n \u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 b.c\n```\n\nand you search for the glob pattern: `**/*.c`.  You want to find these things:\n\n```\ny/a.c\ny/b.c\ny/d/e.c\n```\n\nWhen it has a globstar, that can match 0 or more path segments.  So, the way that it does that is to read the dir, then test each child as if they were below the globstar, and if they replace the globstar.\n\nSo, you have a pattern like `[**, *.c]`.  So, you read the cwd, and get `[x, y]`.  For each child, test if it matches without the globstar, if the child replaces the globstar (to find its grandchildren) and also below the globstar (for further descendants).  This results in the following patterns:\n\n```\n[ *.c ]\n[ y, *.c ]\n[ y, **, *.c ]\n```\n\nWe then process each of those.\n\nThe first matches nothing.\n\nThe children of y are `[a a.c b b.c d]`.  For the first pattern, this is simple, and then for the next, we do the same special globstar approach.\n\n```\n[ *.c ] --> [] (no matches)\n[ y, *.c ] --> [ y/a.c, y/b.c ]\n[ y, **, *.c ] -->\n  [ y, *.c ] (without the globstar, note the duplicate!)\n  [ y, a.c, *.c ]\n  [ y, a.c, **, *.c ]\n  [ y, b.c, *.c ]\n  [ y, a, *.c ]\n  [ y, a, **, *.c ]\n  [ y, b, *.c ]\n  [ y, b, **, *.c ]\n  [ y, d, *.c ]\n  [ y, d, **, *.c ]\n```\n\nI'm not sure just how much of a problem this really is.  After all, if you listen on the 'end' event (or just use the top-level function instead of the object) then you'll get the deduped list.  Solving this problem without breaking the other trickier examples would be pretty tough.\n. This is exactly a duplicate of #64 (posted by @chbrown).  Apparently it was a mistake to close that one, since more people are clearly affected by it :)\n\nThere's an explanation in #64 about why this is happening.  The trivial fix breaks a bunch of tests, but this is indeed a bug.\n. > Ouch. The issue immediately before this one...\n\nHaha, no worries.  I guess it just shows that more people are affected by this than I'd thought, that's all.\n\n> how do the post-processing methods de-dupe?\n\nYes, it's using Object keys, as long as you don't set `nounique:true` in the options.  That flag is important if you want brace-expanded portions to behave exactly like Bash (where dupes will show in that case).\n\nI think the right solution is not to dedupe along the way, but rather to find an algorithm for globstar that doesn't suffer from this shortcoming.\n. Actually, whatever, just dedupe the patterns that globstar resolves to.\n. The reason is that it's aggressively caching stat results to save syscalls.  Each of those is an object, and with a whole lot of them, it gets considerable.\n\nIt'd probably be possible to replace the simple object caches with a LRU or something using the https://github.com/isaacs/node-lru-cache module\n. I suspect that this is no longer an issue, as this module has been heavily refactored and slimmed down since then.  Closing for now, but please do pipe up if it's still a problem in the latest release.\n. Expected behavior.\n\nYou're looking for `c/**/f.json`, right?  Well, glob does a readdir on a dir like `c/w`, and gets `f.json, w.js` as results.  At that point, it doesn't know whether the items returned are directories or files.  And, it doesn't care: `c/w/f.json` is a match, but if `f.json` is a dir, then `c/w/f.json/f.json` would also be a match, and `c/w/f.json/a/b/c/d/e/f/g/f.json` would be a match as well.  So, it does a readdir on `c/w/f.json`, which tells it two things: (1) Is f.json a dir? and (2) if it's a dir, what's inside it?  The ENOTDIR tells is that it's not a directory, and it moves on.\n\nThe fact that it's calling stat at all is a bit odd in this case.  Can you please provide an actual test script in JavaScript, with a real folder structure?\n. In general it seems fine, and won't break anything on the Unix side.  Can you add a test that specifically addresses the problem in #61?\n\nAlso, I prefer to do package.json changes myself, but I can rebase that out.  You can point your package.json dependency at your github fork while waiting for this to be merged.\n. Landed on f3105a3cfc12d3c6e0a2c931d8cf7f1a6a1ff49a.  Thanks!\n. Maybe someday, but not likely any time soon.\n. I'd accept a PR to add a `glob.Stream` class that is a readable stream.  But I'd rather not change the `glob.Glob` class itself.  Just have `glob.Stream` wrap a `glob.Glob` object internally, and inherit from `stream.Readable`.\n. Rather than land this in this module, here's a quick wrapper that anyone can use\n\n``` javascript\n// copyright Isaac Z. Schlueter. Public Domain.\nvar glob = require('glob')\nvar Readable = require('stream').Readable\nvar util = require('util')\nutil.inherits(GlobStream, Readable)\nfunction GlobStream (pattern, options) {\n  Readable.call(this, options)\n  var self = this\n  this.glob = glob(pattern, options)\n  this.glob.on('match', function (m) {\n    self.push(m)\n  })\n  this.glob.on('end', function () {\n    self.push(null)\n  })\n  this.glob.on('abort', function () {\n    self.push(null)\n  })\n  this.glob.on('error', function (er) {\n    self.emit('error', er)\n  })\n})\n```\n. Already fixed on https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/commit/1bf9d36cc8bb3081ed2c2978eb74dbc33bcdedf1 ;)\n. is this still an issue?  Tests seem to be passing, as far as I can tell.\n. Yeah, this isn't a bug.  Just an annoying thing.\n. Sorry for the delay, I've been meaning to get to this, and hoped that I would over the thanksgiving holiday, but it slipped.\n\nI'll try to land this week.  Thanks for your patience.\n. Don't worry about rebasing on master, I think the patch should land pretty cleanly, and it's relatively simple, so it shouldn't be too hard for me to pull forward if necessary.\n. @stefanpenner et al: See #146. I need a test that passes with the patch, and _doesn't_ pass without the patch.\n\nNothing can be landed in this library with a valid test.  I'm sorry for being so strict about this, but it's the only thing that makes maintenance of this module even remotely possible.\n. Yes, the test needs to run on Unix (mostly so I don't inadvertently destroy it some day, which I probably will otherwise).\n\nWindows CI would be awesome, and I'd greatly appreciate getting this module running somewhere.  But it's not a replacement for a test that runs on Unix.\n. Yes, plus one, would merge.  I suggest hijacking or mocking whatever is necessary to make the patch in #146 testable on unix.  That's actually all that's missing from getting to UNC support; appveyor is optional.\n. There isn't a working fix to merge, or else I would have done so by now.  What you're waiting for is not \"this fix to land\", but rather \"a fix to exist\".\n\nHere's what's needed for a valid solution, to this or any defect in any code I maintain:\n1. Code that fixes the problem.\n2. Tests that fail without the patch, and pass with the patch.\n3. Those tests have to run on Unix systems (mock everything, I don't care, but the test has to actually run)\n\nWithout (2), it's not clear that the code actually works.  Without (3), the tests will start failing some day and no one will notice.  These aren't weird desert island requirements or unrealistic doom and gloom predictions.  They're just what happens.\n\nI haven't had time to dig into this particular issue.  @stefanpenner made a courageous attempt, but then seems to have faded away with an ominous last message about a Pandora's Box.\n\nI understand that this is important to you all.  That importance does not change the fact that I cannot accept changes that are going to reduce test quality.  Maybe if one of you work at a company that benefits from having a glob implementation in JavaScript, and is affected by this Windows-specific issue, you can try to convince your boss to let you spend a few days working on it.\n. Yeah, I think it'd be ok to add a feature to let you pass in a JavaScript sort function (of the kind passed to Array.sort), but the default built in sorting will remain as it currently is.\n. Fixed in 4.1.\n\n```\nreaddir called with args { '0': 'test', '1': [Function] }\nreaddir called with args { '0': 'test/a', '1': [Function] }\nreaddir called with args { '0': 'test/a/abcdef', '1': [Function] }\nreaddir called with args { '0': 'test/a/abcfed', '1': [Function] }\nreaddir called with args { '0': 'test/a/b', '1': [Function] }\nreaddir called with args { '0': 'test/a/bc', '1': [Function] }\nreaddir called with args { '0': 'test/a/c', '1': [Function] }\nreaddir called with args { '0': 'test/a/cb', '1': [Function] }\nreaddir called with args { '0': 'test/a/symlink', '1': [Function] }\nreaddir called with args { '0': 'test/a/abcdef/g', '1': [Function] }\nreaddir called with args { '0': 'test/a/abcfed/g', '1': [Function] }\nreaddir called with args { '0': 'test/a/b/c', '1': [Function] }\nreaddir called with args { '0': 'test/a/bc/e', '1': [Function] }\nreaddir called with args { '0': 'test/a/c/d', '1': [Function] }\nreaddir called with args { '0': 'test/a/cb/e', '1': [Function] }\nreaddir called with args { '0': 'test/a/symlink/a', '1': [Function] }\nreaddir called with args { '0': 'test/a/c/d/c', '1': [Function] }\nreaddir called with args { '0': 'test/a/symlink/a/b', '1': [Function] }\n```\n. Hm.  Seems like it'd be better to just make this work.\n. Why doesn't broccoli use `glob.sync` then?  It's a command-line builder-type app, right? (Or am I missing the point of it...?)\n\nExcept in extremely rare scenarios, async fs I/O will _always_ be strictly slower than sync fs I/O.  If you don't _need_ to be doing many things in parallel, there is no benefit.\n\nThis is my primary objection to saying \"Just add `await`!\" or other coro-style approaches to making code \"look sync\".  How it looks is the smallest downside of asynchronous code!  If you need to run lots of stuff in parallel, and responding consistently is worth a bit of a slowdown across the board, and a huge percentage of your time is spent in a waiting sleep mode, then async I/O is great.\n\nThis describes most web servers, but _not_ most command-line programs, which typically do a small number of things at a time, and care more about just blasting through it all as fast as possible.\n. Oh, ok.  Then yeah, it's just slow.  I've done a lot of combing through it to remove unnecessary syscalls, but haven't profiled the JS itself.  Would love patches to make it faster.\n. Ok!  Initial investigation suggests that the biggest source of the delay is reliance on node's `fs.readdir` to determine both directory-ness and contents.  Since this uses a file descriptor, it's getting wrapped by `graceful-fs` which is explicitly designed to trade speed in favor of managed resource utilization.  So that sucks.\n\nAdditionally, there's some just plain shoddy JavaScript that's accreted over time in the readdir callback handling that V8 is having trouble optimizing.  I think that whole area needs a thorough refactoring to remove a few steps, and especially since glob matching is being used in some very time-sensitive applications, all of the `.bind()` and `.call()` usage needs to be eliminated.  Wrapping callbacks to do stuff at the end, tons of anonymous closures being defined inside of methods, it's kind of a giant mess.  I have enlisted the help of [The Dark Pony Zalgo](http://blog.izs.me/post/59142742143/designing-apis-for-asynchrony) to have a single code path that is used for both sync and async behavior.  I thought that I could preserve sanity if His Dark Tendrils were buried deep enough below the API layer.  I was wrong.\n\nLastly, in the globstar case specifically, both bash 4.3 and the next version of node-glob have to do an `lstat` on all directories encountered in the crawl, since symlinks to directories should _not_ be crawled.  So, the `Node statSync and readdirSync timing` benchmark test is not quite an apples-to-apples comparison.  It should probably lstatSync each directory as well as readdiring it.  It's still a LOT faster than the node-glob tests, but falls a bit more behind the bash/zsh test cases, as one would expect.\n\nI've got the bash43 style globstar behavior implemented properly on a branch now, but it's even slower.  I'd like to refactor and optimize it to get the speed up before merging into master, which will make this much better.\n. On the splitsync branch, I added another 10x to the benchmark script, and got these numbers:\n\n```\nBash timing: real   3m26.991s\nZsh timing: real    1m56.420s\nNode statSync and readdirSync timing: real  2m0.762s\nNode readdirSync error-catching timing: real    1m52.183s\nNode glob.sync timing: real 3m43.829s\nNode glob async timing:\nFATAL ERROR: CALL_AND_RETRY_2 Allocation failed - process out of memory\nbenchmark.sh: line 70: 52477 Abort trap: 6           node -e '\n  var glob=require(\"../\");\n  glob(\"**/*.txt\", function (er, files) {\n    console.log(files.length)\n  })'\n```\n\n`glob.sync` is comparable to Bash 4.3 on a huge dataset, and the master async glob runs out of memory.\n\nWith the 100000 file set, it's this:\n\n```\nBash timing: real   0m5.656s\nZsh timing: real    0m3.711s\nNode statSync and readdirSync timing: real  0m3.291s\nNode glob.sync timing: real 0m12.116s\nNode glob async timing: real    0m39.727s\n```\n\nThe sync approach is about 2.5 times Bash 4.3, 4x zsh and the naive node sync approach.\n\nNext step is to refactor the async approach similarly, and then it's profile time.\n. Currently, `glob.sync` is about 1.5 to 2x the time of bash 4.3, and `glob` is about 4-5x the bash time.  Zsh is a little bit faster, but that's because its globstar still crawls symlinked dirs, so it gets away with saving an extra lstat call.\n\nCalling this mission accomplished!  Look for massive speed improvements on glob 4.1.\n. @bpasero Even if you do the file actions asynchronously, there is usually a limit to just how async the fs can be, and there is a hard limit to how many threads node will use to perform async fs operations.  (Once upon a time that was 4, but I recall it being increased, maybe there's a cleverer heuristic involved since last I saw that code, which was a few years ago.  It might not be as \"hard\", but there is still definitely a limit.)\n\nSo, if you are parallelizing more fs ops than node allocates threads, it's going to back up, and be effectively serialized anyway.  (Of course, \"serialized\" with multiple parallel tracks, as each thread finishes what it's doing and then takes on a new job.)\n\nHowever, all of this is ultimately limited by the file system itself!  Spinning disks can only be in one position, so if you're trying to read 2 files in parallel, the fs will either thrash (making both operations slower than they would've been), or make one operation wait for the other.\n\nStat and readdir calls are less thrashy and more cacheable by the fs, since they're only dealing with the file link table (at least, on most Unixy systems).  But in fact, if every bit of data is available in the operating system's fs cache, they'll be very fast, and adding the async thread management overhead will be relevant.\n\n\"Parallelizing\" operations on a single machine (whether that's a single cpu or a single disk) is more like \"multitasking\" than \"teamwork\".  When you parallelize things across a _network_, of course, it's a whole different story, which is why things like Hadoop are so great for massively big data problems, compared with writing a simpler program for a single machine.  But when you parallelize a bunch of operations that are effectively throttled by a single bit of hardware, as a general rule, you're almost certainly not going to make things faster.\n\nLots of qualifiers there.  It's highly dependent on a lot of factors, like what specific type of disk is involved, the operating system, the file system type, as well as just whatever else the machine happens to be doing at the time.\n\nIf you _are_ doing many things in parallel (for example, it's a web server, where you don't want to pause in replying to one user's HTTP request while you read a file for another user), then async is absolutely the way to go.  Node makes this the \"default\" path because it's designed for building network programs, where this usually matters.\n\nIf you're a web server, then providing users with a consistently fast connection pick-up, and a predictable first-byte time, is all that really matters.  The \"average file read time\" is 100% worthless as a metric, if you lost business because some unlucky user had to wait 2s for a web page to load, and decided to hit the back button.\n\nBut if you're a cli utility, especially one that doesn't make network requests, then the situation is completely reversed.  The better approach is to avoid thrashing the disk, and since you have exactly one user who is going to wait for every single task to be completed, reducing the average task time is the way to go, so sync isn't just _easier_, it's also _better_.\n. > If all you do is just walking through the file system, I would not expect sync to be much slower than async.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that your expectation is wrong. You should expect sync to be _faster_ than async.  Async is always slower, it just has less of an effect on slowing down _other_ things (servers etc.)\n. Thanks, @joliss \n. I think this is not such a great idea.  But I'd be happy to accept a pull request that made it throw when no cb is provided and sync is not set to true, since I agree that's almost always going to be a mistake.\n\nYou can also use `glob.sync(...)`, by the way.\n. Yeah, I guess that's getting added after the 'match' event is emitted.\n\nThis is a bug.  Patch welcome.\n.

So, even though `foo/bar/foo/foofile` would match, it detects that `foo/bar/foo` refers to the `foo/` part of itself, so it doesn't explore that bit.\n\nFurthermore, this `**` behavior appears to have changed between Bash 4.1 and Bash 4.3!  Probably because it is unwieldy to deal with a gigantic mess of results when there are recursive symbolic links.\n\nThe crash that you're seeing is happening because there are a large _number_ of recursive symbolic links, rather than a particularly _deep_ set of them, so you're hitting the memory limit before hitting the ECYCLE error from the fs.  Updating to Bash 4.3-style behavior would fix the problem.\n. Your test is interesting, but non-authoritative.  The reference implementation that node-glob targets is bash 4's globstar and extglob behavior.  The example I posted above does show that Bash 4.1 and Bash 4.3 have different behavior, and it seems that Bash 4.3's globstar behavior is superior, so that's what we should target.\n\nIt doesn't matter what zsh or tab-completion do, ultimately, though this is one example of a use-case where the more \"conservative\" results are much more useful.\n. No, I don't have bash 4.1 installed any longer (upgraded due to shellshock some time ago).\n\nBut if I re-generate the test fixtures with bash 4.3, I see different results.  So, yeah, we're doing the wrong thing now (but only because \"the right thing\" changed!)\n. Here's the diff in the test fixture results from bash 4.1 (used to generate them originally) and bash 4.3 (which I have now) https://gist.github.com/isaacs/f748618f744f61756f55\n. So, it seems like the behavior can be summed up as: \"While expanding matches for a `**` section, do not explore any directories already part of that particular `**` expansion\".\n\nThis, of course, is _after_ consecutive `**` segments are collapsed.\n. Landed in 4.0, made MUCH faster in 4.1.\n. Landed, but using the `once` module instead of juggling event handlers.  Since presumably the glob object is going to be disposed of shortly in the event of an error callback, removing the handler is unnecessary, provided there is a hard guarantee that the cb is not fired again (which `once` provides).\n. minimatch is more like fnmatch, not an exact corrollary to glob.\n\nGlob is doing brace expansion, which is a shell-ism, rather than a glob-ism, per se.  On the shell, when you do `echo *.{a,b,c}` you are literally doing the exact same thing as `echo *.a *.b *.c`.  Check it out:\n\n```\n$ node -p process.argv *.{a,b,c}\n[ 'node', '*.a', '*.b', '*.c' ]\n```\n\nI'd be happy to accept a doc patch that clarifies that brace expansion happens before anything else, just like with the shell.\n. Function declarations are hoisted in JavaScript, and JSLint has kind of a bad attitude.\n\nNo thanks.\n. Well, it may not be unreasonable, but it _is_ incorrect.\n\n```\n$ echo {*}\n{*}\n\n$ echo {*,}\nLICENSE README.md examples glob.js node_modules package.json test\n```\n. https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/pull/96\n. I would accept a patch to do something like this.  If it's expensive in terms of performance then it should be optional.\n. https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/pull/96\n. I bumped the major version for this.\n\n_Seriously_, though, people, you _have_ to update your npm versions.  It has been almost a year since `^` support was added, and a few months since it's been the default.  You're getting left behind if you don't upgrade.\n\nDo this, everywhere:\n\n```\nnpm install npm -g\n```\n. You'll have to upgrade your version of Node to the latest 0.10 to build this package.\n. Aww, how sweet! Thanks!\n. The issue isn't with Node v0.8.  The issue is with npm 1.2.\n\nhttps://github.com/joyent/node/pull/7669\n. Fixed by 0414fb0\n. Something in your tree is depending on glob 4.x.  Probably it's doing either a `\"glob\":\"*\"` or `\"glob\":\">= <something>\"`.  Neither of these are safe or advisable options.\n\nThe bug isn't in node-glob, the bug is in whatever is depending on it too loosely.\n\nTry doing `npm ls glob` in your project after a fresh `npm install`, and you'll see all the places where glob is getting installed.\n.

In the short-run, you can avoid this by having a dependency at the top level on `\"glob\":\"3\"` it looks like.\n. What's happened is that you installed both browserify and glob.  Since browserify's glob dep was satisfied by the fact that you already had a glob 3.x there, it didn't install a second copy.  However, when you then installed glob 4.x, that clobbered the glob that browserify was depending on.\n\n`npm i browserify` will fix the situation.\n. @mreinstein YES! this is something I'm sorta working on part-time, whenever I'm slacking from my CEO duties.  It's part of the \"refactor install to not be so dumb\" project.\n. This does seem to be a bug, yes.\n. Wait a minute... how are you passing an array to glob?  This module doesn't support that, last I checked.\n. Yeah... it looks like negation is just broken?  I'm not sure what it would do...\n\nThis seems to work fine:\n\n``` javascript\nvar glob = require('./glob');\n\nglob('!(node_modules)/**', {nonegate:true}, function (err, files) {\n    console.log(files);\n});\n\n\n```\n. Thanks, but I'm going to pass on this for now.  It's easy enough to wrap a callback-taking function in a promise, and this is not the best place to be doing that.\n. 03daf204c935fa04e90fb605f4e3c6cde07c2d43 thanks!\n. Landed and pushed. Thanks!\n. Fixed by 5f9bc8391924aa9ecf20814bc1ca431abd5acd74.  Thanks.\n. Bumped minimatch to 1.0.0, and glob to 4.0.5.\n. It always uses \"/\".  Doc patch welcome.\n. Landed on globstar43 branch.  Will be in master soon.  Probably this weekend.\n. already fixed.\n. I like how this approach at an API is more explicit than the weirdness around negated globs today.\n\nPatch welcome, but it'll have to have lots of tests and some very clear docs.  Note that it'll have to be implemented for both sync and async approaches separately.  (That is, `glob.js` and `sync.js` are similar logic, implemented in parallel.)\n. The latest version of graceful-fs is safe to drop in. We should just make\nit a proper dep.\n\nPatch welcome.\n\nOn Monday, September 8, 2014, Peter Braden notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Of course, after looking at the code, graceful-fs is an optional\n> dependency...\n> \n> Without knowing any of the context behind this, I assume that graceful-fs\n> can't be seamlessly dropped in (hence the optionalDep).\n> \n> Is there any way to get glob to open less files?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/issues/116#issuecomment-54834611.\n. landed on master\n.

How many copies of glob do you have in your project?\n. I don't understand the question.\n\nWhat is a \"flat file\"?\n. So you mean, you want to know if it has any special characters in the glob pattern?\n. Well, technically speaking, _any_ pattern might expand to 0 files.  But it's not hard to add a function that just returns true or false if the glob has any pattern segments in it.\n. The fact that you say \"one more more\" files is confusing to me.  I'm going to add a `hasMagic` function since it's pretty easy and would be very useful, and I _think_ it meets your needs, but I'm going to need more detail if not.\n\nThanks.\n. Ok, great.

Done on globstar43 branch already.  That'll be merged into master once the perf is a bit better.\n. Sorry, I'm not interested in maintaining two metadata files.\n. Can you please provide a standalone glob test that does not involve gulp?\n. The negation semantics are really odd, actually, and I've thought a lot about ripping them out.  It shouldn't have anything to do with symlinks, though.\n. @impinball Yeah, totally.  It's just weird when it involves `**` stuff, and also it still only is limited to whatever non-globby prefix you provide, since this library takes a TON of shortcuts to avoid unnecessary directory walking.\n\nSo, for example, the pattern `!b*/c` will match anything named `c` that is not in the directories starting with `b`.  `!b/*` will not return anything.  `!b*/**` will match anything at any depth under any directory other than those that match `b*`.\n\nThis is clearly all wrong.\n\nWhat I think you usually want is more like `** but not anything matching the pattern`.\n\nFor example, if my pattern is `!app/*` then it should match any file in the cwd, but _not_ anything in the `app` dir.  But should it match `app/x/y`?  That isn't matched by `app/*`, so it seems like perhaps it should be matched by `!app/*`?  But that means that `!` will always imply a massive `**` walk, and you might be very surprised for it to go more than one level deep.\n\nDo you see what I'm getting at?  I'm a bit hesitant to change the negation behavior unless the change is to (a) completely remove it, or (b) first define what would be sensible.\n. If you are interested in making it sensible, please go weigh in at https://gist.github.com/isaacs/fc635c852c64ffabf2fd\n\nFor the time being, unfortunately, this issue will not be addressed, because any change will make things worse.\n. I'm going to leave in test, though the test _fixture_ is already ignored (because that is generated by the test scripts anyway).\n\nThe gif is already excluded on the `globstar43` branch, which will be merged in as soon as I can get the performance a bit better (or before getting the performance improved, if it ends up taking too long.)\n. This repo hasn't used travis-ci for about a year now, so that link is out of date and irrelevant.\n\nI'm curious about the two unit tests that fail locally.  I cloned your gist and tested it locally, and there is a bug in it.  You are setting `sync:true` in your options, but providing a callback.  That's not ever going to work.\n\n4.1.2 will contain a check for this, to throw a TypeError if you do that.\n\nWhat system are you running this on?  Do you have Bash 4.3?  Have you regenerated the test cases?\n. 4.1.2 published.\n. If you `git reset --hard` then it'll reset to the tests generated on my system with Bash 4.3, and it should pass.\n\nAlso!  I highly recommend getting Bash 4.3 so you can use globstar in your day to day command line globbing :) http://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=bash\n. @ekweible Can you please gist the entire test output?  I can't begin to debug this without knowing which pattern is failing.  Thanks.\n\nClosing until further details provided.  Will re-open if root-cause requires any changes.\n. Tests are included on purpose.\n. makes it easier for people to run the tests in strange environments.  But I suppose I could put a small test script that just tells you to download the git repo to run them.\n. Where are you using glob that it is too large?  The tarball is tiny, and not that much tinier with this patch.  Even over cheap internet, you're going to spend almost as much on HTTP headers as you do with this thing.\n\nIf you had truly limited disk space, or just a hella slow disk, such that the cost of unpacking these files was high, I could _maybe_ see it.  But even then, what are you doing using glob?  It's a bit of a memory hog and really only can be used on a server FS in the first place.\n\nA few people just told me that they support your right to publish micro packages, but they are grumpy when tests are not included, thus requiring an extra step to run them.\n. Yeah, re-enabled it last night :)\n. Thanks!  Added a test, but yes, this is a bug, not an intentional API change.\n. Symlinked directories are no longer explored.  This is the same behavior as Bash 4.3.  If you find a case where it doesn't behave the same as Bash 4.3, then please let me know.  Otherwise yes, this is by design.  See the discussion in https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/issues/86\n. If you rely on this behavior you should pin your glob dependency version at `3.x`.  This change was introduced in 4.0.\n. Indeed, you've found a discrepancy between bash 4.3 and node-glob!  This is a bug!  Posted as https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/issues/135\n\nThe solution is not \"follow symlinked dirs\" as suggested in the OP here.  The correct behavior is \"stop following symlinked dirs as part of a globstar match, but still resolve their contents against subsequent parts of pattern\".\n. @clintwood Yes, in the latest release you can do `{follow: true}` in the options, and it'll happily go along until it gets an ELOOP error from the fs.\n. @nathanjessup @seanmwalker Can you try pulling the GH-135 branch and see if that fixes things for you?  You can do `npm i isaacs/node-glob#GH-135` to install it in your project directly from GitHub.\n. Sweet.  It is closer to bash 4.3 behavior on this branch, and doesn't break any other tests, so I'm gonna go ahead and merge.\n. Landed and published as 4.1.6.\n. @seanmwalker \n\nThe intent wiht node-glob v4 is to match the behavior of Bash 4.3.  This is a breaking change, hence the bumped major version number.\n\nSo, with this structure:\n\n```\n~/my-module\n~/my-module/lib\n~/my-module/lib/aSymlinkedFolder -> ~/symDir\n~/my-module/lib/localFolder\n~/my-module/lib/localFolder/aScriptFile.js\n~/my-module/package.json\n~/my-module/server.js\n~/symDir\n~/symDir/bar\n~/symDir/bar/anotherThing.js\n~/symDir/foo\n~/symDir/foo/deeper\n~/symDir/foo/deeper/more.js\n~/symDir/foo/something.js\n```\n\nBash 4.3 returns this:\n\n```\n$ echo $BASH_VERSION\n4.3.30(6)-release\n\n$ for i in ~/my-module/lib/**/*; do echo $i; done\n/Users/isaacs/my-module/lib/aSymlinkedFolder\n/Users/isaacs/my-module/lib/aSymlinkedFolder/bar\n/Users/isaacs/my-module/lib/aSymlinkedFolder/foo\n/Users/isaacs/my-module/lib/localFolder\n/Users/isaacs/my-module/lib/localFolder/aScriptFile.js\n```\n\nBash 3.2 does this:\n\n```\n$ echo $BASH_VERSION\n3.2.48(1)-release\n\n$ for i in ~/my-module/lib/**/*; do echo $i; done\n/Users/isaacs/my-module/lib/aSymlinkedFolder/bar\n/Users/isaacs/my-module/lib/aSymlinkedFolder/foo\n/Users/isaacs/my-module/lib/localFolder/aScriptFile.js\n```\n\nNode-glob does this:\n\n```\n$ node -p 'require(\"glob\").sync(process.env.HOME + \"/my-module/lib/**/*\").join(\"\\n\")'\n/Users/isaacs/my-module/lib/aSymlinkedFolder\n/Users/isaacs/my-module/lib/aSymlinkedFolder/bar\n/Users/isaacs/my-module/lib/aSymlinkedFolder/foo\n/Users/isaacs/my-module/lib/localFolder\n/Users/isaacs/my-module/lib/localFolder/aScriptFile.js\n```\n\nwhich is identical to Bash 4.3, working as designed.\n. I am open to a \"Follow all symlinks forever\" option.  Maybe `follow:true`?  Please open a new issue requesting the feature, and if I don't get to it, maybe someone else will.  The patch to the code would be just a few lines in `glob.js` and `sync.js` to skip over the lstat stuff, but it'll need plenty of tests.\n. I don't usually delete branches. You can ignore them.\n. This project's goal is to match the behavior of Bash 4.3.  Any changes that bring it closer to the matching semantics of Bash 4.3 are considered bugfixes and bump the patch version.\n\nOpt-in features that provide alternative behavior are considered additive changes, and bump the minor version.  Minor versions may also include bugfixes.\n\nRemoval of opt-in features, or changes to the API surface, are considered breaking changes, and bump the major version.  Major versions may also include bugfixes and additive changes.\n\nIf you are a depending on a bug, then a bugfix will break your system.\n\nI'm happy to include a changelog, but I'd rather use a tool to generate it manually, as this is quite tedious.  Do you have any recommendations?\n. From #135 \n\n> I am open to a \"Follow all symlinks forever\" option. Maybe `follow:true`? Please open a new issue requesting the feature, and if I don't get to it, maybe someone else will. The patch to the code would be just a few lines in glob.js and sync.js to skip over the lstat stuff, but it'll need plenty of tests.\n. Patch welcome.  Make sure to add tests for both sync and async behavior.  The option should be `realpath:true` (to better match `stat:true` behavior).\n. Make sure to take advantage of the cache option to fs.realpath, so that it can avoid statting the same paths multiple times.\n. I see, so gulp is responding to `match` events rather than the list of all results which is sorted at the end.\n\nGlob no longer uses graceful-fs, so that would be why the change happened.\n. @contra @heikki I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news.\n\nIt turns out that sorting the readdir results isn't actually enough of a fix, and in fact, it _can't_ be reliably fixed in the general case without some truly awful things.\n\nConsider this:\n\n```\na\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 b/\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 z/\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 c/\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 z/\n```\n\nIf you glob for `a/*/z` then it does the first readdir on the `a/` dir.  Some platforms this returns `['b','c']` and others, `['c','b']`.  So, we sort it.\n\nThen, for each of those two dirs, _in parallel_, it does a `readdir` to see if there's a `z` inside.  They'll both hit the thread pool at effectively the same time, just a few ns off.  But sometimes, `readdir('a/c')` will return before `readdir('a/b')`, so even though we sort every readdir, we still get `a/c/z` before `a/b/z`.\n\nTo truly fix this, we'd have to somehow sort the `readdir` responses _and also_ sort the return processing from each child branch to manage the order that they return in.  That's way beyond my threshold for complexity.  A simpler approach would be to serialize the processing of each child dir, but then we'll be leaving a lot of performance on the table (like, 4x in some cases).\n\nWith that in mind, I'm going to revert this \"fix\", because it adds complexity and CPU cycles for no benefit.\n\nYou'll just have to handle out-of-order results.  They are sorted in the final tally, though, so you can either have them sooner (and maybe out of order), or all at once (and sorted).  Trade-off appropriately for your use case, I guess.\n. Thanks!\n. This will be fixed soon. It's a regression in minimatch. Sorry for the hassle. \n. Fixed in Glob 4.3.1\n. @StoneCypher The basic for most modules is `npm install` first to install deps, and then `npm test` to run tests.  If you find that is too much typing, then `npm i` and `npm t` also work.\n\nIn this case, it's because of a change in a dependency of a dependency, so tracking down the culprit can be a bit tricky and require human brain power.\n. Needs a test that fails without this patch, and passes with this patch.\n. Awesome, thanks.\n\nMy concern is that it's only running the test on Windows, and since most of the development (and ci) is running on unix, this won't catch it if I later break this functionality.  But now, since the tests pass on your windows system, at least I believe that it works ;)\n\nA better approach might be to mock out the parts of the system so that the functionality can be tested on a Unix system as well.  The general pattern would be something like:\n\n``` javascript\n// pretend to be windows\nprocess.platform = 'win32'\n// load glob before we muck around with fs's guts\nvar glob = require('../')\n// mock out whatever we need to\nvar originalStat = fs.stat\nfs.stat = function (path, cb) {\n  // do whatever we want, based on the path\n}\nvar originalReaddir = fs.readdir\nfs.readdir = function (path, cb) {\n  // whatever\n}\n\ntest('wildcards in unc path', function (t) {\n  glob('\\\\\\\\whatever\\\\*', function (er, results) {\n    // make sure this is what we expect\n    t.end()\n  })\n})\n```\n. It looks like this is confusing `options.realpath` and `options.follow`.\n\n`options.realpath` should make it return the realpath rather than the symlink.  But, it should _not_ change the symlink-following behavior.\n\n`options.follow` should make it follow symlinks until it hits `ELOOP`, like glob 3.x did.  But it should not cause it to realpath the results.\n\nThese should be two separate patches, each with separate tests and docs.\n. This should be a separate utility module. It is not glob's place to change the EE semantics. \n. @vegetableman The tests are thorough, and it looks like you've got the API pretty much perfect and working.  Good job!\n\nHowever, there's a **lot** of stuff in this patch that is not relevant to the change.  I started commenting on it, but gave up after a while.\n1. Single quotes have been changed to double.  Including in words like `isn't` in comments, even.  Don't do that.  This project uses single-quotes exclusively for strings, as of 82b8568.\n2. The if/else formatting has been changed in many places.  There are two ways that this project does if blocks.  If it is a single-line, it should not use braces.  If it is a multi-line, it should use braces of the form of `} else {` all on one line.\n3. Spacing around conditionals and function calls.  There should be spaces between the `if` and the opening `(` of the conditional.  Function definitions should have a space between the name and the opening `(`.\n4. Many unnecessary `setImmediate` calls are added, I'm not sure why.  They aren't relevant to this feature.  If you are finding cases with strange timing errors, please provide example code and post a new issue about that.\n\nThese things make it much harder than necessary to review the change.\n\nIn general, a commit for a feature should be as small as possible, and no smaller; it should do exactly the feature that is being added, and nothing else; it should match the style of the surrounding code so well that no one can tell that the original author didn't write it themselves.\n. Oh, also, semicolons added to line endings in many places.\n. Note: Travis error is spurious, fixed on aaffe249119c4640ed71e186d40516aa8e7e2d4e.\n\n> Is it supposed to behave differently?. right now, fetching `foo/**` and `foo/**/**/**` return the same number of results.\n\nNo, it's supposed to behave the same, but the issue is that you're doing special treatment for things that end in `/**`, and stripping it off.  Why not `.replace(/(\\/\\*\\*)+$/, '')` instead, to strip off all trailing `/**` segments?\n. Just another thought, if you have this structure:\n\n```\na\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 b/\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 bc/\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 c/\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 bc/\n```\n\nAnd you glob for `a/**/b*` with an ignore of `a/b`.\n\nWithout any ignore, you get three matches:\n\n```\n> g.sync(\"a/**/b*\")\n[ 'a/b', 'a/b/bc', 'a/c/bc' ]\n```\n\nBut with it, I'd think that only the explicit `a/b` match should be ignored.  Instead, I get:\n\n```\n> g.sync(\"a/**/b*\",{ignore: [\"a/b\"]})\n[ 'a/c/bc' ]\n```\n\nThat seems like a bug to me.  Since there are no magic chars in the ignore (eg, it's not ignoring `a/b/**` or `a/b/*` then only the explicit `a/b` match should be omitted.\n. @vegetableman I pulled in 4c71eaebe0e09e69d59d5a95bc9c58c882e0fdec\n\n```\n> g.sync('a/**/b*')\n[ 'a/b', 'a/b/bc', 'a/c/bc' ]\n> g.sync('a/**/b*', {ignore:'a/b'})\n[ 'a/c/bc' ]   <--- Expect: [ 'a/b/bc', 'a/c/bc' ]\n```\n. ```\n$ git lg -n5\n*   ddf2c1c vegetableman (HEAD, vegetableman/fix-ignore-branch) Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/master' into fix-ignore-branch (6 seconds ago)\n|\\\n| * aaffe24 isaacs (origin/master, master) make readdir-order test deterministic (48 minutes ago)\n* | 4c71eae vegetableman New: Added ignore option (fixes #115) (7 hours ago)\n|/\n* 82b8568 isaacs Settle on single quotes (4 days ago)\n* 941d53c isaacs (tag: v4.3.2, vegetableman/master) v4.3.2 (3 weeks ago)\n```\n. Still slightly incorrect.\n\n```\n> g.sync('a/**/b*')\n[ 'a/b', 'a/b/bc', 'a/c/bc' ]\n> g.sync('a/b/*')\n[ 'a/b/bc' ]\n> g.sync('a/**/b*', {ignore:'a/b/*'})\n[ 'a/c/bc' ]\n```\n\nIf you're ignoring `a/b/*`, then that should _only_ exclude files that are matched by `a/b/*`.  Since `a/b` isn't matched by `a/b/*`, it should not be excluded.\n\nAlso:\n\n```\n> g.sync('a/**/b*', {ignore:'a/**b/**'})\n[]\n```\n\nI think all the \"ends with star\" or \"ends with globstar\" bits need to be ripped out.  It's a premature optimization.\n. The principle has to be this:\n\nThe result of `glob(pattern, {ignore:set})` is equal to to the complete subset of `glob(pattern)` not found in the union of the glob expansions of every pattern in the ignore set.\n. Sorry, I was unclear.  I'm not saying that the optimization is not a requirement for release of this feature.\n\nI'm saying it's premature in advance of correct behavior.\n\nThe first step should be to implement the contract correctly, and provide a mountain of tests for every conceivable edge case. _Then_ add optimizations, each time also adding more tests to guarantee that the optimization's new edge cases don't break the contracts.\n\nI'll review again tomorrow and see if I can poke any new holes in it ;)\n. @vegetableman Thanks for your patience on this, btw.  I know it's frustrating when you make a contribution and the author puts you through the ringer, but since this module is used by many high-profile fs libs, it's important to be really careful about anything that can introduce surprising edge cases.  In the worst case, they end up depending on those bugs, and then when we fix them, it causes problems.\n. I don't think \"negative ignores\" is a good idea.  Maybe we should just throw in that case.  If you want something to not be ignored, then put it in the pattern.  It opens the door for folks to do crazy stuff like `glob('**', {ignore:['!thing-i-want', '!other-thing-i-want']})` so now we're into double-negative territory.  If that's a worthwhile use-case, then let's just add multi-glob support with some sensible API surface.\n\nAdded one minor comment, will review in more detail later.\n. Let's discuss multi-glob and streaming in other issues, plz.\n. @vegetableman Getting closer, but logic's still not quite right.\n\n```\n> g.sync('test/a/c/**')\n[ 'test/a/c',\n  'test/a/c/d',\n  'test/a/c/d/c',\n  'test/a/c/d/c/b' ]\n> g.sync('test/a/c/*')\n[ 'test/a/c/d' ]\n> g.sync('test/a/c/**', {ignore:'test/a/c/*'})\n[]\n```\n\nIn this case, it should _only_ ignore patterns that would be matched by `test/a/c/*`, that is, `test/a/c/d`.\n\nHowever, as you can see, it's failing to even explore the child directories in `test/a/c`, because of the star handling logic.  The expected value here would be:\n\n```\n> g.sync('test/a/c/**').filter(function(p) { return p !== 'test/a/c/d' })\n[ 'test/a/c',\n  'test/a/c/d/c',\n  'test/a/c/d/c/b' ]\n```\n. Ok!  Landed this on master.\n\n@vegetableman I had a few other suggestions, which were mostly pretty minor, and I went ahead and just made the changes myself.  Since we've gone back and forth a bunch on this, and you seemed to be getting something out of the process, I want to share the reasoning behind both:\n1. The two tests were merged into a single test that just lists cases and has less repeated code.  This makes it a lot easier to add new tests, and reduces the likelihood that one day we'll add a new ignore test, and forget to update the sync test as well, etc.\n2. I split up the `isIgnored` function into `isIgnored` and `childrenIgnored`, in order to remove the boolean argument.  In general, a boolean argument is often an indication that you probably are putting two different functions in the same place, and it'd be better to just have them go ahead and be two separate functions.\n3. I de-inlined the argument to `ignore.map()`, since it doesn't actually need access to the closure state.\n\nWill release with a bumped minor later today.  Might try to get a few other PRs in there as well.\n. Yeah, I'm going to deprecate comments and negation in the next major release, coming up soon.\n. `[` is a magic char in globs, just like regexps.  It'd be looking for:\n\n```\nC:\\Build\\7D - refonte\\Myproject\\\nC:\\Build\\7e - refonte\\Myproject\\\nC:\\Build\\7v - refonte\\Myproject\\\n```\n\nEscape the `[` with a `\\` char, like `\"C:\\\\Build\\\\7\\\\[Dev\\\\] - refonte\\\\\\Myproject\\\\\"` in js.\n. `*.(xxx|yyy)` isn't a valid glob pattern.  `(xxx|yyy)` is a regexp, which is equivalent to the `@(xxx|yyy)` glob pattern.\n. You'd want to do `*.@(xxx|yyy)`\n. Compare to Bash 4.3\n\n```\n$ echo *.@(xxx|yyy)\nfoo.xxx foo.yyy\n\n$ echo *.(xxx|yyy)\nbash: syntax error near unexpected token `('\n\n$ node -p \"require('../glob').sync('*.(xxx|yyy)')\"\n[]\n\n$ node -p \"require('../glob').sync('*.@(xxx|yyy)')\"\n[ 'foo.xxx', 'foo.yyy' ]\n```\n. Try this:\n\n``` javascript\nvar Glob = require('glob').Glob\nvar g = new Glob(somePattern, { stat: true })\ng.on('stat', function (file, stat) {\n  // do your stuff here\n})\n```\n. That definitely looks like a bug to me.  It should never match a file with a trailing `/`.\n. Thanks for getting this started!\n\nBefore this can be accepted, though, there are two things that need to be done.\n\nFirst, it needs a test added (something that fails before the patch, and passes with the patch).  You can either modify an existing test to add the new case, or add a new one.   (Note that if you do add a new test, you'll have to run `npm run test-regen` on a Mac or Linux box to re-generate the bash comparison test cases.)\n\nSecond, I'm pretty sure that all of these glob.sync errors are _also_ errors in the async case.  If you look through the code, you'll see that they follow one another pretty closely.  So, each of these changes in the sync flow have to have the corresponding change made in the async flow.\n\nLet me know if you are/aren't interested in doing these bits, or if you need any help with them.  Eventually, I'm sure I or someone else will get to it if you don't find the time, but it might take a bit longer to get to.\n. Fixed by 0b729c83f15c3d78f5235f893c1ed912e6386eb7.  Thanks!\n. Well, as you say, glob is working fine.\n\nI am not the maintainer of Grunt, and have no idea exactly what it's doing with glob internally.  node-glob-whatev is over 2 years old, and LOTS of bugs have been fixed since then, both on Windows and Unix.\n\nI'd try posting the bug over on grunt's issue tracker.  If it turns out glob is doing the wrong thing, then we can take a look at it.\n. Just end the pattern in a `/`.  Example:\n\n```\nglob('**/', function (er, dirs) {\n  if (er) throw er // or handle or whatever\n  console.log('all dirs:', dirs)\n})\nglob('*/', function (er, dirs) {\n  if (er) throw er // or handle or whatever\n  console.log('first-level dirs:', dirs)\n})\n```\n. Pass an `ignore: ...` option in. \n. Try this:\n\n``` javascript\nglob('**', { ignore: [ 'index.html', 'js/main.js' ], nodir: true }, console.log)\n```\n\nNegative extglob patterns like `!(foo)` cannot contain slashes.  So, another approach might be to do something like one of these, depending on how many _other_ files are in there that youer' trying to exclude.\n\n``` javascript\n> glob.sync('!(*.html)/!(main.js)', { nonegate: true })\n[ 'js/lib.js' ]\n> glob.sync('js/!(main.js)', { nonegate: true })\n[ 'js/lib.js' ]\n> glob.sync('js/!(main.js)')\n[ 'js/lib.js' ]\n```\n\n(Note that the `nonegate` is required for now to interpret the first part as a negative extglob section rather than a fully negated pattern.  The next major release will deprecate using negated patterns, in favor of using ignores instead.)\n. @iLanbiala yes it does. \n. So, lemme make sure I get this right.  You're saying that the test case in the original post here should return an empty array, and as far as I can tell, it does:\n\n```\n$ tree fixtures/\nfixtures/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 .swag\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 test.coffee\n\n0 directories, 2 files\n\n$ node -e 'require(\"./glob.js\")(\"./fixtures/*swag\", { ignore: \"./fixtures/**\", dot: true }, console.log)'\nnull []\n```\n\nIs there a simple case you can provide where that doesn't work as expected?\n. Aha!  This is two bugs, then!\n\nThe gstarmatcher thing is broken in this case, also:\n\n```\n$ node -e 'require(\"./glob.js\")(\"./fixtures/.*\", { ignore: \"./fixtures/**\" }, console.log)'\nnull []\n```\n\nIn that case, I'd expect it to only be ignoring things matched by `./fixtures/**`, ie `./fixtures/test.coffee`.\n\nIt seems reasonable to me that the options provided to the top-level matching should also be passed to the ignore matcher, so this patch gets a tentative +1 from me, once I get a chance to review in a bit more detail.\n\nRegarding the other issue, I'm not sure the best approach... dropping the optimization for `**` in an ignore seems like it's going to be problematic, since it means we have to potentially walk a huge directory tree for no reason.  On the other hand, detecting the case where this might be a problem (when `dot` isn't set and the matching pattern contains some explicit dot-portion which falls somewhere within the globstar section) is potentially tricky.  (Or maybe what I just wrote in the previous sentence is an adequate heuristic and we can go with that?)\n\nWill think on this a little bit and set a reminder to take a look at this again very soon.\n. Can you try with the patch in #227 and see if that is less surprising?\n. I'll upgrade the error message to provide clearer instructions here.\n. Spaces are a valid char to have in a filename, so no, that would mean a different thing.\n\nIf you're suggesting that we auto-trim the braced sections, that would be a breaking change and a departure from Bash behavior, so that's not going to happen.\n. What version of glob are you using?  When I set up a test to raise EACCES, it just acts as if the files aren't there, because the stats and readdirs fail.\n. What is `g.continue()`?  Are you sure you're using this module, and not something else?\n. Yeah, it should probably be doing an `lstat` to figure out existence, and then just try to `readdir` to see if it's a directory if it shows up as either a dir or symlink.\n\nGood find!  This is indeed a bug.\n. I suspect that this is causing isaacs/rimraf#65 and ember-cli/ember-cli#3413.\n. Yes, this was on purpose.\n\n`rimraf` version 2.3.0 depends on `glob@^4.4.1`, which has a bug that is not present in `glob@4.4.2`.\n\nBecause `rimraf` is so widely used, this caused a major problem for many users.\n. Discussion in https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/pull/130\n\nIf you want to run tests and benchmarks, check out the git repo.\n. I would be open to a change to support back-slashes on windows machines.  Probably the best solution would be to, on windows, replace all back-slashes with forward-slashes, and then swap back to back-slashes in the result.\n\nPart of the blocker to doing stuff for windows is that I don't have a windows environment for CI tests, and it's quite tedious to run tests in Windows since I develop in a unix environment.  Do you have any tips on this?\n. No, I mean, at the very start, we replace `\\` with `/`, so that the logic all works as it is.  Then, before emitting a `match` event or calling the cb with the results, we swap back to `\\` so that you get paths that match the system.  (Of course, this is a bit complicated, because UNC paths in windows have to remain with `/` chars.)\n\nSuch a change would have to come with tests, and I'd want to run those tests regularly to make sure they don't break.\n. Looks like this is a regression in the `cwd` handling.  @nikku, I can't reproduce your test case without setting a `cwd` option, and only in sync mode, is that what you're seeing as well?\n\n```\n$ tree test\ntest\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 posts/\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 folder/\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 a.md\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 b.md\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 c.md\n\n2 directories, 3 files\n$ cd test\n\n$ node -e 'require(\"glob\")(\"**/*\", {nodir:true}, console.log)'\nnull [ 'posts/a.md', 'posts/b.md', 'posts/c.md' ]\n\n$ node -p 'require(\"glob\").sync(\"**/*\", {nodir:true})'\n[ 'posts/a.md', 'posts/b.md', 'posts/c.md' ]\n\n$ cd ..\n\n$ node -e 'require(\"glob\")(\"**/*\", {cwd:\"test\",nodir:true}, console.log)'\nnull [ 'posts/a.md', 'posts/b.md', 'posts/c.md' ]\n\n$ node -p 'require(\"glob\").sync(\"**/*\", {cwd:\"test\",nodir:true})'\n[ 'posts',\n  'posts/a.md',\n  'posts/b.md',\n  'posts/c.md',\n  'posts/folder' ]\n```\n\nWill investigate and publish a 4.5.1 and 5.0.1 with the fix.\n. Same with non-globstar as well:\n\n```\n$ cd test\n\n$ node -e 'require(\"glob\")(\"*/*\", {nodir:true}, console.log)'\nnull [ 'posts/a.md', 'posts/b.md', 'posts/c.md' ]\n\n$ node -p 'require(\"glob\").sync(\"*/*\", {nodir:true})'\n[ 'posts/a.md', 'posts/b.md', 'posts/c.md' ]\n\n$ cd ..\n\n$ node -e 'require(\"glob\")(\"*/*\", {cwd:\"test\",nodir:true}, console.log)'\nnull [ 'posts/a.md', 'posts/b.md', 'posts/c.md' ]\n\n$ node -p 'require(\"glob\").sync(\"*/*\", {cwd:\"test\",nodir:true})'\n[ 'posts/a.md', 'posts/b.md', 'posts/c.md', 'posts/folder' ]\n```\n. No problem at all, @nikku.  Thanks for confirming.\n\nFixed on 4.5.1 and 5.0.1.\n. @dzire187 Can you clarify exactly what you mean by \"this issue\"?  Are you using exactly the same pattern and folder structure as presented in the original post, or do you have a different test case that is failing in a similar way? \n. You want minimatch, not this module. \n. Good patch, good test.  Thanks!  <3\n. Use the \"ignore\" feature.\n\n```\nglob('**/*.js', { ignore: '{c,d}/**' }, cb)\n```\n. The issue here is that you can't put slashes inside of extglob patterns.  They can only refer to path portions.\n. Yep, that's a bug.  Good find!\n. updated travis to match my other projects.\n. Doc patch welcome.\n\nThe `match` event is the specific thing that matched, as matches are found.  It is not deduplicated in the normal case, and is not yet resolved to a realpath.  If we had to move the `fs.realpath` call up earlier in the process, then this would require some inconvenient refactoring.\n. Landed on master, thanks!\n. Fixed already by another PR.\n. Landed on master.  Thanks!\n. landed, thanks!\n. This is tricky.\n\nThe idea for ignores is \"exclude all potential matches which would be returned by a search for any of the ignore patterns\".  It's not \"exclude all potential matches which refer to files that would be found by any of the ignore patterns\".\n\nSo, for example, `/a/b/c` _doesn't_ return `a/b/c` as a match, even if that file exists.\n\n```\n> matches = glob.sync('tmp/x/y/z', { cwd: '/' })\n[ 'tmp/x/y/z' ]\n> ignore = glob.sync('/tmp/x/y/z', { cwd: '/' })\n[ '/tmp/x/y/z' ]\n> require('array-intersection')(matches, ignore)\n[]\n```\n\nIf we tell it to give us the realpath value, then it'll do the right thing:\n\n```\n> real = glob.sync('tmp/x/y/z', { cwd: '/', ignore: '/private/tmp/x/y/z', realpath: true })\n[]\n```\n\nThat's because the `real` option makes it so that you only get absolute paths.\n\nIn order to satisfy the test in #190, we'd have to add a `path.resolve` and double-check any non-absolute results.  And I'm not sure it's really the ideal semantics, but it's worth discussing the trade-offs.  At least, it's a breaking change.\n\nRegarding feross/standard#116, it's worth noting that `glob('**', { ignore: gitignoreLines })` is not quite what an ignore file does, anyway.  The patterns and the file names all need to be mounted on the directory where the ignore file lives.  You could check out https://github.com/npm/fstream-ignore if you want to use the same file selection logic that npm uses for ignore files in packages.\n. In JavaScript, you must always double-up your back-slashes because backslash is the escape character.  So, for example, `a\\nx` is the string `{0x61 0x0a 0x78}` (a, LF, x), but `'a\\\\nx` is the string `{0x61 0x5c 0x6e 0x78}` (a, slash, n, x).\n\nGlob has some difficulties with UNC paths.  I'm guessing this is a duplicate of #74.\n. This is pretty close!\n\nI inadvertently optimized away your minimatch change, but then I fixed it on 2.0.7.\n\nI am still running into a bit of a weird issue with the test, because the `path-is-absolute` module is rather insistent on using `process.platform`, and it's also used throughout the codebase a bit.  I was able to get this specific test to work, but only because `isAbsolute('/baz')` is the same on Windows and Posix.\n\nI think the right approach here, though it's more lines changed, is to pass the platform as an option to Glob, and then load all the appropriate separator/absolute/etc stuff onto the glob object, so it never has to look at `process.platform` or `path.sep` or whatever.\n\nI'm thinking something like this in the `setopts` function in `common.js`:\n\n``` javascript\nself.platform = opts.platform || process.platform\nself.isAbsolute = isAbsolute[self.platform] || isAbsolute;\nself.resolve = path[self.platform].resolve || path.resolve;\nself.sep = path[self.platform].sep || path.sep;\n```\n\nAnd then, throughout `glob.js` and `sync.js`, make sure to always call the methods off of `this` rather than `path.<whatever>()` or `process.platform`.\n\nThis also means that, if at some point we need to change just one of these fields, or use AOP to debug those function calls, we can either make those fields configurable, or instantiate an object and just change the relevant bits.\n\nOf course, this can lead to glob doing something weird in some cases, but it'd make it so that we can test other windows irregularities in the future more easily, with a lot less module cache tinkering.\n\nWhat do you think?\n. I'm totally ok with involved changes that improve testability, windows support, and make the code easier to follow (including fewer hacky workarounds in tests).\n\nOf course, bigger PR size tends to make for more back and forth in the review process, but I think we're pretty aligned on what needs to happen for this.\n. UGGHHHH that's right.\n\nI'd say just skip that test in node <= 0.10.  The code should still work fine, and since this is really just a matter of string juggling stuff, it should be fine to run the tests in only later versions.\n. I'd throw something like this in there:\n\n``` javascript\nvar skip = false\nif (/^v0\\.(10|[0-9])\\./.test(process.version)) {\n  skip = 'Does not work on Node < 0.12'\n}\n\ntest('some test name', { skip: skip }, function (t) { ...\n```\n. If you wanna just leave the tests failing in 0.10, that's fine, too.  I can work it out when I merge it in.  If it's passing in 0.12 and io.js, then I can take it from there :)\n. Ok, just reviewed.  The test looks perfect, and nothing in the code jumps out at me as problematic.\n\nIf you think this is ready to go, I can merge and release this weekend or early next week.\n. It looks like the issue is that the WinPath stuff in the `setopts` function in `common.js` is messing with root and path in a weird way, such that `glob(process.cwd())` can't return anything, because it ends up having a `root` setting of `c:` and a pattern of `/path/to/cwd`.\n\nThe mocking and testing stuff looks pretty good.  I think it's the right approach.\n\nOn master right now, all the tests pass on Windows.  I'd recommend rebasing, and then applying the changes one by one and making sure that tests pass at each commit.\n. True story: I saw the title of the email and for a second I was scared this issue was a C&D from Williams St for copyright violation.\n. (or I guess it'd be Frederator? I'm not sure who owns AT.)\n. @mik01aj You should use `ignore: ['**/*-integration-test.js']`.  As you've written it, it'll only ignore `*-integration-test.js` files that are not in a sub-directory.\n. Patch welcome for this.  Probably just need to find the bits where `match` is emitted and call `isIgnored` like @mlmorg is doing in the workaround.  I'll get to it soon-ish if no one else does.  (Note that patches require a test!)\n. I've noticed that with this module, and a few others, about half the time I say \"patch welcome\" I end up just writing it later that afternoon...\n. Thanks for the report!  fixed on 5.0.7\n. Landed #222 instead, thanks.\n. I don't see the error you're describing.  How are you getting this?\n. That's totally fine in ECMAScript strict mode.  Function expressions may be in conditionals, just not function declarations.\n\nFor example, this would throw:\n\n```\n'use strict'\n\nif (true) {\n  function foo() { return 1 }\n}\n```\n\nBut this is totally fine:\n\n```\n'use strict'\n\nif (true) {\n  var foo = function foo() { return 1 }\n}\n```\n. You are getting confused about the difference between \"function declaration\" and \"function expression\".\n\nA function used as a callback like `fs.readdir(dir, function (er, entries) { ... })` is not a function declaration.  It is a function expression.\n\nFurthermore, the issue in V8's strict mode where it says \"functions can only be declared at top level or immediately within another function\", is in fact not compliant with the ES6 specification.  The actual rule is that function declarations inside of blocks in strict mode are local to the block.  Io.js and future versions of Node have newer versions of V8 which observe the ES6 specification in this regard.  Observe: https://gist.github.com/isaacs/ea2b667d7336b64843e1\n\nNo, I will not be changing node glob.  It functions properly in strict mode, both in old (incorrect) versions of V8 as well as new (correct) versions of V8.  The error you cite is not applicable in either case, because these are function expressions, not function declarations.\n. @jvoccia Right, but `L:/05**/*.dwg` ought to match the same things as `L:/05*/*.dwg`.  I gather that's the bug.\n. @jmorrisIII What's the L: drive in this case?  Network share or something?  Does it work in C:?\n. You're providing a callback to the sync glob function. That's not allowed. The error message tells you where to fix it in your code. \n. Yeah, I wonder if there are any other cases where `ENOTSUP` might be raised by `readdir` other than \"this is a regular file\".\n\nOne approach might be to stat the file when we get an `ENOTSUP` just to make sure it is a real file that exists?\n. Meh. Adding stat is a pita.  Just gonna treat ENOTSUP the same as ENOTDIR.  It already was shown on a previous `readdir` call, so it's probably there.\n. I'd rather not.\n\nMost promise libs have easy shorthands for promise-ifying a callback-taking function.  I'd rather let node-glob focus on globbing, and stick to the simplest possible API pattern for asynchrony: a function.\n. The `ignore` option is a glob pattern string.  To replicate the RegExp you're providing, it'd be `\"*wfl.d.ts\"`\n\ndoc patch welcome.\n. What version of glob are you using?  There was a very recent change to how ENOTSUP is handled.\n. Weird... I just added a test that exercises that bit of the code, and it works fine.\n\nCan you please provide a full reproducible test case, and the exact error you see when running it?\n. That's strange.  Getting an `ENOTSUP` on a readdir call should be exactly the same as getting `ENOTDIR`.\n\nAre you quite sure that it's `glob@5.0.13` that's reporting this?  Can you run `npm ls glob` to see if there are any other versions in use?\n. Ohhh... are you using `glob.sync` or `glob`?\n. Oh, sorry, I'm dumb, apparently.\n\n```\n* c47d451 isaacs (HEAD -> master, tag: v5.0.14, origin/master) v5.0.14 (12 seconds ago)\n* 821fac8 isaacs Handle ENOTSUP for sync glob as well as async (4 minutes ago)\n* 9625618 isaacs Test for when readdir raises ENOTSUP (25 hours ago)\n* 0a2b519 isaacs Generate fixtures more effectively, with -O instead of eval (9 days ago)\n* f96190b isaacs Use js for benchmark cleanup (12 days ago)\n* 957fd93 isaacs Fix some 'use strict' errors (12 days ago)\n* bf3381e isaacs Treat ENOTSUP like ENOTDIR in readdir (12 days ago)\n* 507733d isaacs (tag: v5.0.13) v5.0.13 (12 days ago)\n```\n\nNotice anything interesting?  I never released the ENOTSUP fix.  That explains it!\n\nThe good news is that I never released _half_ the ENOTSUP fix, so it now works on 5.0.14 for both sync and async glob.  Can you re-install and let me know?\n\nSorry for not catching that!\n. Can you provide a simple test script that demonstrates what you're seeing?\n\nExplaining in english < explaining in JavaScript ;)\n. I've put off adding `~` support until Node has cross-platform passwd functions (coming to io.js soon, I believe?)  Then we can do stuff like `~root/foo` and `~bob/bar` and have it expand with the home dir of the specified user.\n. @fenwick67 Is there any way to get the home directory of someone other than the current user?  (Ie, resolve something like `~root/foo` to `/root/foo` and resolve `~user/foo` to `/home/user/foo`, etc?)\n. fixed on latest release\n. `find(1)` is not the model that this module matches, but rather the globbing pattern-matching behavior in Bash 4.3.\n\n```\n$ mkdir -p dir/subdir/subsub\n$ for i in dir/**; do echo $i; done\ndir/\ndir/subdir\ndir/subdir/subsub\n```\n. Bash 3 didn't have globstar support, so of course it would not do anything special with `**`; it'd be the same as `dir/*/*`.  (You can emulate this behavior by setting `{ noglobstar: true }` in the options object.)\n\nI'm not super familiar with zsh, so I can't speak to how that works.\n. @UltCombo It's not doing globstar matching at all, that's why.  You're getting the same results as `dir/*/*`.\n\nYou can observe this if you do `mkdir -p dir/a/b/c/d/e/f/g` and see what it matches.\n. Wild!  Yeah, that's totally different.  What does `dir/**/` match?\n\n> Also, if `dir/**/*` was treated the same as `dir/*/*`, it would not match `dir/subdir` in the comment above, right?\n\nAh, good point.\n\nAnyway, zsh's globbing is not the reference implementation that this module targets :)\n. Not a node-glob issue.\n. Different versions of V8.\n\nIn 0.12:\n\n```\n$ node -p '\"abc\".localeCompare(\"XYZ\")'\n-1\n\n$ node -v\nv0.12.7\n```\n\ncompare to v0.10 (and io.js)\n\n```\n$ node -p '\"abc\".localeCompare(\"XYZ\")'\n9\n\n$ node -v\nv0.10.40\n```\n\nand io.js:\n\n```\n$ node -p '\"abc\".localeCompare(\"XYZ\")'\n9\n\n$ node -v\nv2.2.1\n```\n\nLooks like there was a bug in 0.12 that then got fixed in later versions of V8?\n. Can you share the program that's raising this error?  It doesn't look like node-glob is anywhere in that stack trace.\n. A) How would you like the API to look?  (Note that this may involve some trade-offs that turn out to not be too costly.)\n\nB) How does that differ from just using `{,,,}` to break up your patterns?  Eg, instead of doing `glob([pattern1, pattern2], cb)` you could do `glob('{' + pattern1 + ',' + pattern2 + '}', cb)`.  I guess it's different if the patterns have `,` chars in them?  Is there any other reason why this workaround is objectionable?\n. Especially: if a file matches more than one pattern, should it be included in the results more than once?  And, do you need to know which pattern a file matched?\n. I took a look at globby.  It seems like it just extends node-glob to take an array of patterns, and uses a Promise for the async API rather than a callback.\n\nUnless this feature gets a champion willing to do the work, I'm not super excited to do it myself, especially since globby already exists.  There are some interesting optimizations that could maybe be taken advantage of (like having the multiple different glob instances share cache objects, for example), but no one's complaining about the speed of globby right now.\n. This is incorrect.  In glob patterns, `?` matches exactly 1 character.\n\n```\n$ touch fo foo fob\n\n$ echo fo?\nfob foo\n\n$ node -p 'require(\"./\").sync(\"fo?\")'\n[ 'fob', 'foo' ]\n\n$ echo fo*\nfo fob foo\n\n$ node -p 'require(\"./\").sync(\"fo*\")'\n[ 'fo', 'fob', 'foo' ]\n```\n. I'm seeing files in there:\n\n```\n$ npm view glob dist.tarball | xargs curl -s | tar ztv\n-rw-r--r--  0 501    20        985 Jul 14 18:34 package/package.json\n-rw-r--r--  0 501    20      15445 Jun 18 15:23 package/README.md\n-rw-r--r--  0 501    20        765 Jul 28  2014 package/LICENSE\n-rw-r--r--  0 501    20       6155 May 21 09:44 package/common.js\n-rw-r--r--  0 501    20      18625 Jul 14 18:26 package/glob.js\n-rw-r--r--  0 501    20      11461 Jul 14 18:26 package/sync.js\n```\n\nMaybe run `npm cache clean` and try again?\n. Correct shasum, too:\n\n```\n$ npm cache clean\n\n$ npm cache add glob\n\n$ npm cache ls\n~/.npm\n~/.npm/glob/\n~/.npm/glob/5.0.14/\n~/.npm/glob/5.0.14/package.tgz\n~/.npm/glob/5.0.14/package/\n~/.npm/glob/5.0.14/package/package.json\n~/.npm/registry.npmjs.org/\n~/.npm/registry.npmjs.org/glob/\n~/.npm/registry.npmjs.org/glob/.cache.json\n\n$ shasum ~/.npm/glob/5.0.14/package.tgz\na811d507acb605441edd6cd2622a3c6f06cc00e1  /Users/isaacs/.npm/glob/5.0.14/package.tgz\n\n$ npm view glob dist.shasum\na811d507acb605441edd6cd2622a3c6f06cc00e1\n```\n. Aha! Turns out there was a minor operational issue this morning that resulted in a small percentage of zero-byte tarballs being served.  I should probably commit `da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709` to memory, because that shasum always indicates a problem ;)\n\nEven though it was a very small percentage, if you were one of the (un)lucky few to get it, it would be cached by the CDN, and keep serving a zero-byte response until our ops folk flushed the caches.  All should be resolved now.\n. Fixed on 7.0.2.  Thanks for finding the bug!\n. This is a bit more complicated of a situation than it might appear.  (More conversation at https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/pull/166 that might be interesting to review.)\n\nI'd like to see a lot more testing and thought around the cases here:\n1. `dot: false`, search for `a/**`, ignore `a/x/**`, file at `a/x/.y/z` exists.  Should `a/x/.y/z` be included in matches?\n2. `dot: true`, search for `a/**`, ignore `a/x/**`, file at `a/x/.y/z` exists.  Should `a/x/.y/z` be included in matches?\n3. `dot: false`, search for `a/**`, ignore `a/**/z`, file at `a/x/.y/z` exists.  Should `a/x/.y/z` be included in matches?\n4. `dot: true`, search for `a/**`, ignore `a/**/z`, file at `a/x/.y/z` exists.  Should `a/x/.y/z` be included in matches?\n\nIf the answer to (1) is \"no\", then we should set `dot: true` for the gsmatcher always.  If the answer is \"yes\", then this patch seems appropriate, but then the optimization around ignoring `**` needs to be removed, which will make things a lot more complicated.\n\nThe answer to (2) and (4) seems to be \"no\" always, so this patch looks correct from that pov.\n\nThe really tricky bit is (3), and I'm not sure I have a good answer here.  People seem to be confused either way.  It might be acceptable to just say, look, for `ignore` patterns, they match dot files, that's just how it is, as long as that's documented clearly.  Another approach might be to say that it follows the same `dot` setting as the overall pattern, which is what this patch does.\n\nTo be honest, I've been procrastinating making a decision on this because I'm not sure what the right call is, and it's probably a breaking change either way.\n\nWhat're your thoughts on this, as a person using glob in your program?\n. Other cases:\n- `dot: false`, search for `a/**/.y/z`, ignore `a/x/**`\n- `dot: true`, search for `a/**/.y/z`, ignore `a/x/**`\n\nReally, we need a comprehensive matrix of test cases and a clear decision on each one.\n. Another interesting case:\n\n`dot: false`, search for `a/**/.y`, ignore `a/x/**`.  Files at `a/x/.y` and `a/z/.y` both exist.  What gets returned?  Does it ignore `a/x/.y`, or not?  (Note that `a/x/.y` does not match `a/x/**` if `dot` is false, but it does match `a/**/.y`, because of the explicit dot.)\n\nThe more I think about this, the more I think that `dot:true` should be set for ignore patterns always.  It should be documented that way and just take the major version hit.\n. Feel free to mess around with the patch in #227 and let me know if it is more or less surprising in practice. \n. Let's simplify this a bit by looking only at the first braced group section.  Clearly it's not the second part of the pattern that's matching, since it doesn't end in `bower_components`.\n\n`**/node_modules/!(grunt*)` will match `node_modules/grunt/node_modules/foo` because the `**` matches `node_modules/grunt/node_modules` and then `foo` is not `grunt*`, so there you go.  The pattern will match any thing containing `node_modules` that doesn't _end in_ `grunt*`, so this will match most of grunt's deps.\n\nI think what you probably want is to drop the `**`, and just use this: `node_modules/!(grunt*)`, or combined with the `bower_components`, `{node_modules/!(grunt*),**/bower_components}`.\n. Landed on master, thanks.\n. If anyone wants to weigh in on the substantial change here, take a look at these test cases: https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/blob/dot-ignore/test/ignore.js#L34-L39\n\nThe relevant file structure looks like this:\n\n```\n$ tree a/{x,z}\na/x\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 .y/\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 b\na/z\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 .y/\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 b\n\n2 directories, 2 files\n```\n\nThe linked test cases go `[pattern, ignore, results]`.  So, eg, a pattern of `a/**/.y/b`, with an ignore set to `a/x/**` will prevent `a/x/.y/b` from matching, even though the `**` would not normally match the `.y` path portion.\n. Alright, the requisite time for objection and testing has passed, and it seems to make everyone's use cases better.  I'm gonna go ahead and land this.  It's a SemVer-major bump, because of the change in behavior, but it's the right change, I believe.\n. @UltCombo I don't understand the question.\n\nI think experience thus far has shown that having ignore patterns not match dot files is always more confusing than the alternative, even when the main pattern doesn't have `dot: true`.\n. Not really that interested.  Passing in a function works fine, and you can wrap it in a promise if you really need to.\n. I decided to just `<code>` them all with backticks. Thanks for the nudge :)\n. @thirdcreed Only the \"negate the whole pattern by prefixing with a !\" has been deprecated.  This kind of negation should still work.\n\n@dangreen what does your file tree look like?  What gets returned?\n. As far as I can tell, this is behaving exactly like bash 4.3\n\n```\n[gh:node-glob/master]isaacs@urdva:~/dev/js/glob/a node@v4.0.0\n$ tree\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 b/\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 c/\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 bar.dyn.css\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 foo.css\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 bar.dyn.css\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 foo.css\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 bar.dyn.css\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 foo.css\n\n2 directories, 6 files\n\n[gh:node-glob/master]isaacs@urdva:~/dev/js/glob/a node@v4.0.0\n$ for i in ./**/*!(.dyn).css ; do echo $i; done\n./b/bar.dyn.css\n./b/c/bar.dyn.css\n./b/c/foo.css\n./b/foo.css\n./bar.dyn.css\n./foo.css\n\n[gh:node-glob/master]isaacs@urdva:~/dev/js/glob/a node@v4.0.0\n$ node -p 'require(\"../\").sync(\"./**/*!(.dyn).css\")'\n[ './b/bar.dyn.css',\n  './b/c/bar.dyn.css',\n  './b/c/foo.css',\n  './b/foo.css',\n  './bar.dyn.css',\n  './foo.css' ]\n```\n\nWhat's happening here is that if you have a file like `foo.dyn.css`, then the `*` matches `fo`, and then `o.dyn` is not equal to `.dyn`, and then the `.css` matches `.css`.\n. If you do use an `ignore` pattern like @thirdcreed suggests, then it works as you probably want:\n\n```\n$ node -p 'require(\"../\").sync(\"./**/*.css\",{ignore:\"./**/*.dyn.css\"})'\n[ './b/c/foo.css', './b/foo.css', './foo.css' ]\n```\n. Indeed!  Fixed on 7.0.1.\n. It looks like the only difference is the sorting.  Can you provide the script you're using to generate this output?\n\nNote that if you set `nosort: true` in the options, then it won't be sorted.  Also, `match` events fire in whatever order they're encountered, which is different on different file systems.\n. Yeah, I see the same results on both.\n\nMy only guess is that readdir is implemented differently on one of your systems, or you're using different versions of glob.  Try calling `result.sort()` if you need a consistent ordering.\n. Without seeing the code, I have no way to know what might need to change.\n\nBut the `path.basename()` function probably will do what you want.\n. Fixed on master.  Had to bump the major, since this is raising a new error, and so it might cause a currently-working program to break.\n\nTough call, since it feels like a \"bugfix\" rather than a breaking change, but I've learned to err on the side of being overly cautious when it comes to raising errors for things that were previously allowed, even if they were incorrectly allowed.\n. No idea, sorry.  Looks like you're using glob right.\n\nDo you have a test that _doesn't_ use mocha?  I'm not very familiar with it.\n. Interesting.\n\nIf you use [tap](http://npm.im/tap) then it supports throws in async tests.  Just sayin ;)\n. If the file system is case insensitive, then this module will be case insensitive. There's not much to be done about that, since all the fs functions will play along with the \"wrong\" case. \n. It is only case preserving in some cases.  In this case, node-glob and bash do the same thing:\n\n```\n$ mkdir -p A/B/C\n$ echo a/**\na/ a/B a/B/C\n$ node -p 'require(\"./\").sync(\"a/**\")'\n[ 'a', 'a/B', 'a/B/C' ]\n```\n\nHowever, there IS a discrepancy here:\n\n```\n$ echo readme.*\nREADME.md\n$ node -p 'require(\"./\").sync(\"readme.*\")'\n[]\n```\n\nGonna open a new bug for this.  Thanks for helping to find it :)\n. Also, maybe related, but maybe a separate issue, note the difference:\n\n```\n$ echo A/**\nA/ A/B A/B/C\n\n$ echo A*/**\nA A/B A/B/C\n\n$ node -p 'require(\"./\").sync(\"A/**\")'\n[ 'A', 'A/B', 'A/B/C' ]\n\n$ node -p 'require(\"./\").sync(\"A*/**\")'\n[ 'A', 'A/B', 'A/B/C' ]\n```\n\nThe `A*/**` doesn't preserve the `/` on `A/`, but `A/**` does preserve the `/`.  Technically they're both correct results, but the difference is a minor bug.\n. Indeed!  Landed this with a comment so that I don't go breaking it again.  Thanks for the patch.\n. I have no idea what to do about this.  I don't manage the webjars repo at all, and that version range syntax is not one I'm familiar with.\n. Sorry for the delay responding to this.\n\nUnfortunately, there's a bug here.  Instead of removing the test fixture and replacing it with something else, just add the new one.

If you've got any ideas, that's welcome too :)\n. Ah, I see the problem.\n\n> This PR fixes async and sync behaviour, adds tests for both in the specific eslint use case and deals with a bash oddity: whilst *\\* doesn't follow a symlink */ will. This may be an edge-case bug in the bash implementation too - but I don't want to follow this rabbit-hole any deeper right now.\n\nUnfortunately, you'll find that this module exists at the bottom of a rather deep rabbit hole :)\n\nBy definition, from the point of view of this module, Bash 4.3's glob behavior is correct.  That's the reference implementation that this module intends to follow 100%, even when that behavior is arguably \"weird\".\n\nBy default, each of the optional flags are either true, or default behavior.  So, `follow: false` doesn't mean \"never follow symbolic links\".  It means, \"only follow symbolic links in the cases where Bash 4.3 follows symbolic links.\"  `follow: true`, on the other hand, means \"follow all symbolic links always\" (which, incidentally is how Bash 4.1 handled symlinks encountered in globstar traversals, and how this module used to do it until Bash 4.3 changed its behavior, and I locked the reference implementation version that this module targets in JavaScript.)\n\nTo deviate from Bash 4.3 behavior, we'd have to add a flag which is off by default, but we've already got a lot of flags, and adding a `nofollow: true` reminds me of spammy email opt-in/out checkboxes (\"don't not uncheck this box unless you don't want to stay unsubscribed to our newsletter\").  Plus, what do you do with `{follow:true,nofollow:true}`?\n\nWe _could_ conceivably say that `follow:false` means \"no symlinks ever\", and `follow: true` means \"follow all symlinks\", and `follow: null/undefined` means \"do what Bash 4.3 does\".  I don't love that either, because now if you just try to un-set a config by setting `globOpt.follow = false`, you can end up deviating from Bash behavior.  In my experience, the true/false/null option always just ends up getting confusing, and it's best to just keep it to 2 options with a boolean cast.\n\nSo, any of these are going to be breaking changes, and additional complexity.\n\nI'm sorry for what probably seems like unnecessarily pedantic adherence to an arbitrary code contract.  Because a lot of popular command line tools rely on this module, I've learned to be very careful about any semantic changes.\n. > But you could use `globOpt.follow = null`\n\nYes, that is what one would have to do.  But that is still a very subtle breaking change.\n\nIt's fine to say that this is \"unexpected behavior\", but it's behaving exactly like the reference implementation it's intending to emulate.  So... unexpected by whom?  If `false` and `null` start having different effects on a field that looks like a boolean flag, then that's also pretty unexpected.\n\nMaybe the answer is a `--no-glob` option for eslint?\n\nOverloading the `follow` flag is not the right call here.\n. Glob never had a \"do not follow any symlinks\" option. `follow` was added to force it to follow symlinks in globstar traversals, unlike bash. \n\nEsliny could have an option to just not use glob at all. Then you wouldn't have to worry about following symbolic links. But maybe that won't work either?\n\nI'm not sure the best answer for your use case. I know that deviating from bash behavior in this module is a bad idea, though, and pseudo-boolean-three-state option flags are flaky and error prone. \n\nYou could also turn on `realpath:true` in the glob options for eslint. Then you'll always get the full real path, and there will never be duplicates that refer to the same actual file. \n. I'm not opposed to this in principle, however:\n1. This should be a standalone module that can promisify a thing given an EventEmitter and a \"resolution\" event (with \"error\" considered the \"rejected\" event, of course).  Flow-control boilerplate doesn't belong in this module.\n2. That module should work on Nodes less than 0.12 (I'm told Bluebird is the thing all the cool kids use these days for their cross-platform promises.)  That's what's breaking the Travis-CI test.\n3. It seems like this isn't matching the Promises/A+ spec, which says that `.catch()` should behave quite a bit differently from how it's implemented here.\n\nAnother approach would be, rather than tacking `.then()` and `.catch()` onto the Glob prototype, just create a `glob.promise(pattern, [options]) => Promise` method, since that's really what you'd probably want to use anyway, and that's pretty trivial.  Might look something like this:\n\n``` javascript\nglob.promise = function (pattern, options) {\n  return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\n    var g = new Glob(pattern, options)\n    g.once('end', resolve)\n    g.once('error', reject)\n  })\n}\n```\n. Another route is just to promise up the (lower case) `glob()` function of a callback isn't provided, but if that returns a Glob instance today, it'd be a breaking change. \n. What do you get when you call `fs.statSync('deleteMe.txt')`?  Or run the glob with `glob.sync('deleteMe.txt', { stat: true })`?\n. Hm.  Ok, that seems kinda like a bug to me.  It should be handling `EPERM` from readdir calls as an indication that the thing is either not a directory or not traversable, but an `EPERM` on a file seems like it should be an error.\n\nI'll have to review the code to be sure there isn't some method to this madness, but I agree that it seems like an oversight somewhere, and I'll try to figure out what bash does.  On Unix, there's no combination of permissions that will prevent you from being able to stat a file, so this is probably just a windows-ism that I didn't think to account for.\n. Anyone affected by this error, please try the following:\n\n```\nnpm install isaacs/node-glob#fix-245\n```\n\nAnd let me know if the problem goes away.\n. @schnittstabil Do you think it _should_ return an error if `{ stat: true }` is used?\n. Right, sorry, when I said \"return an error\", I meant throw from sync or first arg to cb from async.\n\nIt's an interesting edge case.  I could see someone thinking that if they do `stat: true`, then that means that the stat call should be required to succeed.  It'd be easy enough to make it work that way.\n. @schnittstabil I can't reproduce that.  What error is thrown?  Can you provide a test program and the output of the crash?  Thanks.\n. @schnittstabil When you say \"it _throws_ an error\", what does that mean, exactly?  Being a JavaScripter, I'd assume it means something like what happens when you do `throw new Error('oops')`\n. @schnittstabil Oh, I see, so if the `fs.readdir` call gets an error, then that fails.\n\nWhat it's saying is \"this is a very strange error, and _probably_ you want to know about it, but the glob process can continue.\"  If you pass `silent: true` in as an option, then it is quiet about it.\n\nI don't know why it's warning in async and throwing in sync, though, that's strange.  It looks like readdir failures need to be cleaned up a little bit as well.  That's definitely a separate issue (though related cause.)\n. I'm not sure what this question is about, but it doesn't seem like it's about this module.\n\nDid you post this issue to the right repo?\n. You're almost there.\n\n``` javascript\nglob.sync('./routes/**/*.js').forEach(function (file) {\n  var f = file.replace(/^\\.\\/routes/, '').replace(/(index)?\\.js$/, '')\n  app.use(f, require(file))\n})\n```\n\nMaybe also relevant: https://nodejs.org/api/path.html#path_path_basename_p_ext\n. > do you think it's a good pratice expose the routes automatically like this?\n\nI have no opinion on the matter. It's your program, do as you like :)\n. Probably what you're looking for is [minimatch](http://npm.im/minimatch)\n. Hm. Yeah, that seems like a bug for sure.  `/build/goat.png` would match `c:/build/goat.png` on win32 systems, so that ignore pattern should prevent `c:/build/goat.png` from being returned in the results.\n. Sorry, I don't know what `--no-instrument-glob` means.\n\nWhat program are you running?  Does it use this module?\n. Here's the problem: without using inflight, this module can end up doing a **lot** more syscalls.\n\nDo you have a reduced test case that shows how glob leaks callbacks when a callback throws?\n. @phated Ah, this is the glob bug you were talking about!  Thanks.\n\nYes, this should be fixed with the latest `inflight` release.  \n. Interesting!  It looks like you'e running it in a working directory in the `G:` drive.  Works for me on `C:`, but it looks like I need to make that test not be drive-specific.\n. Should be fixed on 68f2509d237babec64cf03adf72531127fd80339\n. How is this different from `follow: true`?\n\nCan you explain the use case in more detail?  And, is there a way to phrase the option so that it doesn't default to `true`?  Most of the other flags default to false, and I'd prefer to stick to that model.\n. So, you want to follow symbolic links, but _not_ symbolic links that have already been traversed, is that correct?\n\nIf I'm understanding the use-case properly, you can do get almost this behavior today by setting `realpath: true` in the options.  (Then you're guaranteed to only get each path once.)\n\n```\n> require('./').sync('test/fixtures/a/symlink/**')\n[ 'test/fixtures/a/symlink',\n  'test/fixtures/a/symlink/a',\n  'test/fixtures/a/symlink/a/b',\n  'test/fixtures/a/symlink/a/b/c' ]\n> require('./').sync('test/fixtures/a/symlink/**', { follow: true }).length\n100\n> require('./').sync('test/fixtures/a/symlink/**', { follow: true, realpath: true })\n[ '/Users/isaacs/dev/js/glob/test/fixtures/a/symlink',\n  '/Users/isaacs/dev/js/glob/test/fixtures/a/symlink/a',\n  '/Users/isaacs/dev/js/glob/test/fixtures/a/symlink/a/b' ]\n```\n\nOf course, the issue is that setting `{ follow: true, realpath: true }` is filling up with duplicate symbolic links and then filtering them down at the very end.  It'd be much better for performance to call `fs.realpath` along the way instead, and avoid traversing directories multiple times if `realpath: true` is set, since they won't end up in the result set anyway.  (This would also fix the weird issue that `realpath: true` glob objects still emit `match` events with the non-realpath paths, which would be a breaking change, but an improvement, imo.)\n\nIf you want output that lists the symbolic links, but and want to follow those symbolic links, and _don't_ want them to be realpath'ed in the result set, then that's going to have to be a different option.  But I think there's a cheaper way to do that than calling `fs.realpath`.\n\n> strict option being true by default\n\nHistorical accident :)  Once upon a time, it was false by default.\n. Note that, if you don't traverse any directories that have been seen already (or worse, resolve them to a realpath along the way), then you can run into weird situations.\n\nFor example, if you have `foo/a/b/c` and `bar @-> foo`, then the pattern `{foo/a,bar/*/b/*}` would match on `foo/a` and then would have to know that it SHOULD traverse `bar` (and re-traverse bar/a) to find `bar/a/b/c`, because that path doesn't match the pattern if we're calling `bar` by its realpath name, `foo`.\n. ``` javascript\nglob('**/*.js', { exclude: '**/*.exclude.js' }, cb)\n```\n. Oh, sorry, I skimmed past that, I guess. Seems like it'd be good if that library let you pass options to glob somehow, then. \n. Am I correct in thinking this has no functional impact?\n\nThis way is fine, of course, but I usually don't accept patches that don't make some kind of measurable change.\n. @phated Thanks!\n. Fixed by falling back to the old implementation of fs.realpath on Node 6 when new errors are thrown from the `realpath` syscall.  Using http://npm.im/fs.realpath module.\n. Wow, didn't notice that uv has realpath now. \n\nSomeone should confirm that it's not using the realpath(3) UNIX function, since that's notoriously insecure. (That's why node had a realpath in JS in the first place.)\n\nIf it is, then it's better for glob to refuse to use realpath in those versions of node. \n. @TheAlphaNerd I haven't followed the conversation in depth, but I see the some ^Lift folks got involved.  If @jlamendo is happy with where node 6 lands on this, then I'm happy supporting it.\n. Digging into this more, it's almost impossible to fix without either (a) making a significant breaking change to glob, or (b) porting the pre-node6 fs.realpath into a standalone module and using that instead.  Both options are nontrivial.\n\nThe tests are breaking because Node broke behavior.  `fs.realpath` no longer works like it used to, and any module that exposed any kind of realpath API surface is almost certainly failing tests as well (provided that their test coverage was sufficient to detect it.)\n\nThe patch here simply ignores `ELOOP` errors that are raised by the fs.realpath call.  That does work in the one case where a test is failing, but digging in a bit deeper, I'm not convinced that it's the correct solution in every case.  In Node 6, node-glob simply cannot do what it used to be able to do.  I am concerned that ignoring ELOOP will violate its contract.  (Also, what about ENAMETOOLONG?  It's purely lucky happenstance that the test is not raising that instead.)\n\nIt's going to take some time to fix issues like this.  In the meantime, in my opinion, people should either know that they're using a not-ready-for-prime-time version of the platform (and thus, expect test failures), or avoid Node 6 until it and the ecosystem have had time to get stable.  This new work lands on the laps of many part-time maintainers who weren't planning for it.  I have no idea when I'll even get to it, but it's not at the top of my list.  I've already spent several hours debugging new issues that Node 6 raised.\n\nBreaking changes  break stuff.  This is what it looks like when a platform is unstable.  It's costly.\n. Already fixed, looks like?\n. The minimatch dep is already updated on latest, and hopefully 1728df825b1401351c326e04b905192debf862fb fixes the appveyor issue.  (Seems to work properly on my local Windows vm.)\n. The CI failures are because one of tap's deps added a dependency on a version of request that doesn't exist.\n\nIt's fixed, and also, I already bumped the minimatch version to `^3.0.2` before seeing this, so it's fine now.\n\nThanks.\n. Can you provide any more details?  Like, the depth of paths, pattern being used, etc?\n\nI'm sure it's something that could probably be addressed, but a reproducible test case would be the first step.\n. Yes. Pass `nodir: true` in the options object.  From the readme:\n\n> - `nodir` Do not match directories, only files. (Note: to match only directories, simply put a `/` at the end of the pattern.)\n. I don't know what `glob-all` is, but this is working for me.\n\n```\n$ tree\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 css/\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 one.css\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 one.txt\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 two.css\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 two.txt\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 js/\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 one.js\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 one.txt\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 two.js\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 two.txt\n\n2 directories, 8 files\n\n$ for i in */*.!(css|js); do echo $i; done\ncss/one.txt\ncss/two.txt\njs/one.txt\njs/two.txt\n\n$ node -p 'require(\"glob\").sync(\"*/*.!(css|js)\")'\n[ 'css/one.txt', 'css/two.txt', 'js/one.txt', 'js/two.txt' ]\n```\n. @jrbenito Doesn't make a different in this case.\n\n```\n$ node -p 'require(\"glob\").sync(\"*/*.!(css|js)\")'\n[ 'css/one.txt', 'css/two.txt', 'js/one.txt', 'js/two.txt' ]\n\n$ node -p 'require(\"glob\").sync(\"**/*.!(css|js)\")'\n[ 'css/one.txt', 'css/two.txt', 'js/one.txt', 'js/two.txt' ]\n```\n\nWhat version of node-glob are you using?  Run `npm ls glob`.\n. Ah, you've got a filename with multiple parts.  I missed that!  So yes, you'll have to use that more complicated pattern, then.\n\nWhat `*.!(js|css)` says is \"some characters, followed by a dot, followed by something that isn't `js` or `css`, followed by the end of the string\".  So, if you have `multi.part.js` then you have `multi` (some characters) followed by `.`, followed by `part.js` (which isn't `js` or `css`).\n\nWhat `*.!(*(*.)js|*(*.)css)` says is \"some characters, followed by a dot, followed by something that is not zero or more instances of (character followed by dot) and then `js` or zero or more (characters followed by a dot) and then `css`\".\n\nIf you were comfortable getting file entries that don't have dots in them (which will mostly be folders, but you can avoid by using the `nodir` option passed to glob) you can use the somewhat simpler pattern `**/!(*.css|*.js)`, which says \"something that isn't `*.js` or `*.css`.\n\nThis matches bash's pattern matching logic:\n\n```\n$ for i in **/*.!(css|js); do echo $i; done\ncss/multi.part.css\ncss/multi.part.js\ncss/multi.part.txt\ncss/one.txt\ncss/two.txt\njs/multi.part.css\njs/multi.part.js\njs/multi.part.txt\njs/one.txt\njs/two.txt\n\n$ for i in **/*.!(*(*.)css|*(*.)js); do echo $i; done\ncss/multi.part.txt\ncss/one.txt\ncss/two.txt\njs/multi.part.txt\njs/one.txt\njs/two.txt\n\n$ for i in **/!(*.css|*.js); do echo $i; done\ncss\ncss/multi.part.txt\ncss/one.txt\ncss/two.txt\njs\njs/multi.part.txt\njs/one.txt\njs/two.txt\n```\n. It is correct that slashes do not work inside of extglob patterns such as `!(a|b)`.  Those can only be used to indicate path parts, not entire paths.  This is how Bash works as well.  In that case, the pattern is read as a file named `b)` inside of a folder named `!(a`, which is weird, but not impossible.\n\nThat being said, you _have_ found a bug here, because it should not throw if you use a pattern like that.\n. You can take a look at how fstream-ignore does it.  That's what npm uses for .npmignore files.  https://github.com/npm/fstream-ignore\n. This is a result of passing an empty string to hasMagic.\n\nIt's fixed in the latest release.\n. Note: You should probably investigate why you're calling `rimraf('')` though.  That seems like a bug that will result in attempting to recursively delete the current working directory.  Are you _sure_ that's what you want to do?\n. Well, this is weird.  Glob can't very well give you a list of files if it can't list the files in a directory.  I'm not sure how I'd even go about addressing that.\n. I'd still call this a bug.  `c:\\\\*` should be functionally equivalent to `/*` on Windows.\n. Something like this?\n\n``` js\n// gs.js\nvar Readable = require('stream').Readable\nvar util = require('util')\nvar glob = require('./')\n\nmodule.exports = GlobStream\n\nutil.inherits(GlobStream, Readable)\n\nfunction GlobStream (pattern, options) {\n  Readable.call(this, { objectMode: true })\n  this._glob = new glob.Glob(pattern, options)\n  this._glob.on('match', function (filename) {\n    if (!this.push(filename)) {\n      this._glob.pause()\n    }\n  }.bind(this))\n  this._glob.on('end', function () {\n    this.push(null)\n  }.bind(this))\n}\n\nGlobStream.prototype._read = function () {\n  this._glob.resume()\n}\n```\n\nUsage:\n\n``` js\nvar GS = require('./gs.js')\nvar gs = new GS('**/*.js')\ngs.on('data', function (filename) {\n  console.log('%j', filename)\n})\ngs.on('end', function () {\n  console.log('END')\n})\n```\n. Anyway, yes, you can pause() whenever, and you should get no match events while paused.  But if your goal is to push it into a stream, then the stream can handle a few pushes while it's buffering.\n. I would accept a PR to add something like this, yes.  Maybe just `absolute: true` as an option.\n. I think you could basically just `this.emit('match', this._absolute ? abs : e)` in that function, and set `this._absolute = !!options.absolute` in the ctor.  Then tests and docs, and you're done :)\n. Published as 7.1.0.  Thanks!\n. Thanks! this'll go out in the next release.  I also wanna fix the thing with the stat errors on Windows, in #245.\n. The object is not filled up synchronously, even on a non-network drive it'll be empty.\n\nTry this:\n\n``` js\nvar g = new glob.Glob(pattern, options)\ng.on('end', function (matches) {\n  if (g.found.length > 0) { ... whatever ... }\n})\n```\n\nOr, perhaps simpler:\n\n```\nvar g = new glob.Glob(pattern, options, function (error, matches) {\n  if (error) { ... handle error ... }\n  if (g.found.length > 0) { ... whatever ... }\n})\n```\n. I'm not interested in maintaining version, description, and dependency information in more than one place.\n\nYou are welcome to float this patch on your own branch, and use that with bower.\n. You don't have to do anything special to clean up the memory.  Just remove references to it.\r\n\r\nIf you put the glob object in a list, you can kill whatever it's currently doing by calling `myGlob.abort()`.  You can see its results by listening for the `end` event.  If you just want to check on it some time later, you can do something like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar myGlob = new Glob(somePattern)\r\nmyGlob.on('end', function () {\r\n  this.done = true\r\n})\r\n\r\n// some time later...\r\n\r\nif (myGlob.done) {\r\n  console.log('it is done', myGlob.matches)\r\n} else {\r\n  console.log('still working')\r\n}\r\n```. Thanks!. Probably the command-line specific stuff shouldn't be in this library.  A lot of cli stuff does use node-glob to parse path options, especially since the shell doesn't do that for you on windows.\r\n\r\nWhat would you want to add here?. > Is there a minimum Node version supported by node-glob?\r\n\r\nYes, but it's 0.10 :)\r\n\r\nIf I had to guess, what's happening is that some module is requiring `glob`, but isn't listing it as a dependency or peer dependency.  But, since some _other_ module in your tree requires glob, it \"works by accident\" in npm version 3 and above, because of tree-flattening.\r\n\r\nRun `npm i glob -S` in your project and see if that fixes it.\r\n. You're installing an outdated version of glob, then.  Upgrade to the latest and greatest.. Yeah, what @bitstrider said.\r\n\r\nGlobs are not regular expressions.  Type `man bash` in your terminal, and look for the section on Pattern Matching.. https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/commit/057569cbcde510173a79b2d668e808023c09bb01. ",

I added an \"end\" listener to the script:\n\n``` js\nvar glob = require('glob');\n\nvar g = glob.Glob('**d*/**', {mark: true}, function(err, result) {\n  console.log('cb', result);\n});\n\ng.on('match', function(filepath) {\n  console.log('match: %s', filepath);\n});\n\ng.on('end', function(result) {\n  console.log('end', result);\n});\n```\n\nResult (WTF)\n\n```\n$ node sample.js\nmatch: deep/deep.txt\nmatch: deep/deeper/\nmatch: deep/deeper/deeper.txt\nmatch: deep/deeper/deepest/\nmatch: deep/deeper/deepest/deepest.txt\ncb [ 'deep/deep.txt',\n  'deep/deeper/',\n  'deep/deeper/deeper.txt',\n  'deep/deeper/deepest/',\n  'deep/deeper/deepest/deepest.txt' ]\nend [ 'deep/deep.txt',\n  'deep/deeper/',\n  'deep/deeper/deeper.txt',\n  'deep/deeper/deepest/',\n  'deep/deeper/deepest/deepest.txt' ]\nmatch: deep/\n\n$ node sample.js\nmatch: deep/deep.txt\nmatch: deep/deeper/\nmatch: deep/deeper/deeper.txt\nmatch: deep/deeper/deepest/\nmatch: deep/\nmatch: deep/deeper/deepest/deepest.txt\ncb [ 'deep/',\n  'deep/deep.txt',\n  'deep/deeper/',\n  'deep/deeper/deeper.txt',\n  'deep/deeper/deepest/',\n  'deep/deeper/deepest/deepest.txt' ]\nend [ 'deep/',\n  'deep/deep.txt',\n  'deep/deeper/',\n  'deep/deeper/deeper.txt',\n  'deep/deeper/deepest/',\n  'deep/deeper/deepest/deepest.txt' ]\n```\n.

I can work on the fix either way.\n. @isaacs I'm going to try to implement options 2 as the README seems to imply that `makeRe` is supposed to be used anyway.\n. Although now I'm confused. Upon further inspection this commit: https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch/commit/b458f5ddc281a07ca51de994f64e477191787b2a is from 2 and half years ago is when `makeRe` was removed from use in favor of `parse`. The commit message only mentions a \"rewrite\". Not really sure which is the best path to take. It seems that `parse` and `makeRe` are duplicating effort\n. @isaacs there were other failing tests in the `bash-comparison.js` test file\n. ",

I can confirm that @staticshock's fix appears to work.\n\n@isaacs just a friendly reminder in-case this one has falling off your radar.\n. > Nothing can be landed in this library with a valid test. I'm sorry for being so strict about this, but it's the only thing that makes maintenance of this module even remotely possible.\n\nI absolutely agree, good coverage is paramount.\n\nI was sending the ping, not to merge, but to make sure you had not forgotten the issue in the first place. As there may have been a small chance you have time to address your own concerns. I suspect based on the comment you do not.\n\nAlthough I have a work-around, I would prefer to not have to play wack-a-mole going forward. So let me see if I can nail down that test case for you this afternoon.\n. @isaacs ah, it seems like this library should actually be run on a windows CI as well. What are your thoughts on this? I will gladly do the work to make it run on appveyor. \n\nBut, If it must provide \"full coverage\" on *nix, I can also dig in. Although doing it elegantly might require some more refactoring.\n. > Windows CI would be awesome, and I'd greatly appreciate getting this module running somewhere. But it's not a replacement for a test that runs on Unix.\n\nproposed resolution:\n- get this project working running / testing on appveyor\n- ensure @staticshock's scenario is also testable in some way on nix\n\nc/d ?\n. > Yes, plus one, would merge. I suggest hijacking or mocking whatever is necessary to make the patch in #146 testable on unix. That's actually all that's missing from getting to UNC support; appveyor is optional.\n\nAlright, I will look into this later this afternoon. I refuse to play wack-a-mole, so I am down for doing the leg work to @staticshock's fix in.\n. > I haven't had time to dig into this particular issue. @stefanpenner made a courageous attempt, but then seems to have faded away with an ominous last message about a Pandora's Box.\n\nI also forgot about it after a vacation. Adding it to my calendar, will revive this weekend.\n. If memory serves a mixture of UNC and `cwd` was the pandoras box I noticed. Basically if `cwd` was a UNC path, fun things would happen.\n\nMy PR (although some more massaging needed)  even without the `cwd` support, would be a really good step in the correct direction. Fixing all the scenarios I could come across, except if a user changed the `cwd` to a UNC path. I suspect the `cwd` stuff could also be tackled, but maybe at a later time.\n\n@isaacs would you be alright with improved UNC support being merged, but leaving some scenarios related to `cwd` also being on a UNC path for a future PR ?\n\nAlthough not ideal, it would likely fix most users problems, without introducing any known regressions.\n. @staticshock  & @isaacs I believe this is ready for review. I'll gladly make changes, so keep me posted.\n. ~~the faking code needs more work actually, although the final code works in windows. The test fails, investigating further.~~ that specific test passes in windows now, but many other unrelated failures exist.\n. > What do you think?\n\nI'm on-board with passing platform in. In-fact it was something I considered but opting out of merely to avoid a more controversial PR. So if you are +1, I'll make it so.\n\nJust a heads-up I'll likely have time again tomorrow to work on this. That being said, with more drastic changes I will likely want to get all the windows tests working. So the changes will likely be a-bit more involved. Is that ok?\n. > Of course, bigger PR size tends to make for more back and forth in the review process, but I think we're pretty aligned on what needs to happen for this.\n\nYa I'm fine with thorough back + forth, as this module had `11,577,444 downloads in the last month` quality and compatibility should be of upmost priority.\n. @isaacs sorry for the delay, been under the weather. Anyways, this is ready for another review.\n\nOne question (and the last failing test), is path in node `0.10.x` doesn't have `path[platform]`...\n- should I polyfil it ?\n- am i missing something more obvious ?\n. @isaacs whats the ideal way to detect node 10? Something like https://www.npmjs.com/package/nversion ? Or a funky regexp\n. > If you wanna just leave the tests failing in 0.10, that's fine, too. I can work it out when I merge it in. If it's passing in 0.12 and io.js, then I can take it from there :)\n\nI'll add the `skip` :package: \n\n> Ok, just reviewed. The test looks perfect, and nothing in the code jumps out at me as problematic.\n\n:+1: \n\n> If you think this is ready to go, I can merge and release this weekend or early next week.\n\nMy use-cases work correct, I tried several ways to break it and couldn't find anything. I am fairly confident. But full disclosure, my windows-foo is weak.\n\nAlso, I will be on vacation new week. So if you release I wont be able to deal with fall-out, it will be on you. If you wait a week, I can help out with any fall out.\n\nYour call sir.\n. sorry, i am unclear why the skip isn't working as expected :(\n. lets actually hold off, I may have noticed other scenarios... such pandora's box.\n. rebased, going to fire up the old windows gaming rig after breakfast and see whats next.\n. Tests should now correctly run, even on old versions of node. Switching to windows now, lets see whats left on this side of things.\n. @isaacs i have added the appveyor configuration, is it possible for you to set up the appveyor.com side of things? I would doit, but then node-glob would end-up stefanpenner/node-glob on appveyor.\n\nIt should be as simple as singing up for the free tier, and adding this repository. As for making the tests pass on windows, I have put together a short triage list, and will work on them this afternoon. If I run into any blockers, I will report back.\n. Ah, just ran into this one as well. I can confirm that @staticshock's fix appears to work.\n\n@isaacs just a friendly reminder in-case this one has falling off your radar.\n. > Nothing can be landed in this library with a valid test. I'm sorry for being so strict about this, but it's the only thing that makes maintenance of this module even remotely possible.\n\nI absolutely agree, good coverage is paramount.\n\nI was sending the ping, not to merge, but to make sure you had not forgotten the issue in the first place. As there may have been a small chance you have time to address your own concerns. I suspect based on the comment you do not.\n\nAlthough I have a work-around, I would prefer to not have to play wack-a-mole going forward. So let me see if I can nail down that test case for you this afternoon.\n. @isaacs ah, it seems like this library should actually be run on a windows CI as well. What are your thoughts on this? I will gladly do the work to make it run on appveyor. \n\nBut, If it must provide \"full coverage\" on *nix, I can also dig in. Although doing it elegantly might require some more refactoring.\n. > Windows CI would be awesome, and I'd greatly appreciate getting this module running somewhere. But it's not a replacement for a test that runs on Unix.\n\nproposed resolution:\n- get this project working running / testing on appveyor\n- ensure @staticshock's scenario is also testable in some way on nix\n\nc/d ?\n. > Yes, plus one, would merge. I suggest hijacking or mocking whatever is necessary to make the patch in #146 testable on unix. That's actually all that's missing from getting to UNC support; appveyor is optional.\n\nAlright, I will look into this later this afternoon. I refuse to play wack-a-mole, so I am down for doing the leg work to @staticshock's fix in.\n. > I haven't had time to dig into this particular issue. @stefanpenner made a courageous attempt, but then seems to have faded away with an ominous last message about a Pandora's Box.\n\nI also forgot about it after a vacation. Adding it to my calendar, will revive this weekend.\n. If memory serves a mixture of UNC and `cwd` was the pandoras box I noticed. Basically if `cwd` was a UNC path, fun things would happen.\n\nMy PR (although some more massaging needed)  even without the `cwd` support, would be a really good step in the correct direction. Fixing all the scenarios I could come across, except if a user changed the `cwd` to a UNC path. I suspect the `cwd` stuff could also be tackled, but maybe at a later time.\n\n@isaacs would you be alright with improved UNC support being merged, but leaving some scenarios related to `cwd` also being on a UNC path for a future PR ?\n\nAlthough not ideal, it would likely fix most users problems, without introducing any known regressions.\n. @staticshock  & @isaacs I believe this is ready for review. I'll gladly make changes, so keep me posted.\n. ~~the faking code needs more work actually, although the final code works in windows. The test fails, investigating further.~~ that specific test passes in windows now, but many other unrelated failures exist.\n. > What do you think?\n\nI'm on-board with passing platform in. In-fact it was something I considered but opting out of merely to avoid a more controversial PR. So if you are +1, I'll make it so.\n\nJust a heads-up I'll likely have time again tomorrow to work on this. That being said, with more drastic changes I will likely want to get all the windows tests working. So the changes will likely be a-bit more involved. Is that ok?\n. > Of course, bigger PR size tends to make for more back and forth in the review process, but I think we're pretty aligned on what needs to happen for this.\n\nYa I'm fine with thorough back + forth, as this module had `11,577,444 downloads in the last month` quality and compatibility should be of upmost priority.\n. @isaacs sorry for the delay, been under the weather. Anyways, this is ready for another review.\n\nOne question (and the last failing test), is path in node `0.10.x` doesn't have `path[platform]`...\n- should I polyfil it ?\n- am i missing something more obvious ?\n. @isaacs whats the ideal way to detect node 10? Something like https://www.npmjs.com/package/nversion ? Or a funky regexp\n. > If you wanna just leave the tests failing in 0.10, that's fine, too. I can work it out when I merge it in. If it's passing in 0.12 and io.js, then I can take it from there :)\n\nI'll add the `skip` :package: \n\n> Ok, just reviewed. The test looks perfect, and nothing in the code jumps out at me as problematic.\n\n:+1: \n\n> If you think this is ready to go, I can merge and release this weekend or early next week.\n\nMy use-cases work correct, I tried several ways to break it and couldn't find anything. I am fairly confident. But full disclosure, my windows-foo is weak.\n\nAlso, I will be on vacation new week. So if you release I wont be able to deal with fall-out, it will be on you. If you wait a week, I can help out with any fall out.\n\nYour call sir.\n. sorry, i am unclear why the skip isn't working as expected :(\n. lets actually hold off, I may have noticed other scenarios... such pandora's box.\n. rebased, going to fire up the old windows gaming rig after breakfast and see whats next.\n. Tests should now correctly run, even on old versions of node. Switching to windows now, lets see whats left on this side of things.\n. @isaacs i have added the appveyor configuration, is it possible for you to set up the appveyor.com side of things? I would doit, but then node-glob would end-up stefanpenner/node-glob on appveyor.\n\nIt should be as simple as singing up for the free tier, and adding this repository. As for making the tests pass on windows, I have put together a short triage list, and will work on them this afternoon. If I run into any blockers, I will report back.\n. ",

But `fs.readdirSync('.')` returns `['deleteMe.txt', \u2026]`\n. > Do you think it should return an error if `{ stat: true }` is used?\n\nUm, no, I think `glob.sync('deleteMe.txt', { stat: true })` should `return` filenames, not errors!? :wink: \u2013 dunno if it should `throw` an error\u2026\nI've only mentioned it for the sake of completeness\u2026\n. @isaacs Thanks a lot, works as expected on my VM.\nBtw, executing `glob('d/**')` on a directory `d` without permission entries works too, it _throws_ an error \u2013 similar to `dir d`.\n\n## \n\n> if they do `stat: true`, then that means that the stat call should be required to succeed.\n\nIMO it only means that `stat` is called on all results. However, one may expect appropriate `statCache` entries, thus `glob(\u2026 {stat: true})` should set some error entries.\n. > Btw, executing `glob('d/**')` on a directory `d` without permission entries **works too**, it _throws_ an error \u2013 similar to dir `d`.\n\n@isaacs Thus, no crash, works as expected.\n. Sorry, for the misunderstanding. To be more clear:\n1. I've created a directory `d`\n2. and removed all permission entries (Windows Explorer) of `d`\n\n## \n\nAs expected:\n\n``` js\nconsole.log(glob.sync('d/**'));\n```\n\n```\nC:\\Dokumente und Einstellungen\\Administrator\\Desktop\\glob-test>node index.js\nError: EPERM: operation not permitted, scandir 'C:\\Dokumente und Einstellungen\\Administrator\\Desktop\\glob-test\\d'\n    at Error (native)\n    at Object.fs.readdirSync (fs.js:808:18)\n    at GlobSync._readdir (C:\\Dokumente und Einstellungen\\Administrator\\Desktop\\glob-test\\node_modules\\glob\\sync.js:288:41)\n    at GlobSync._processGlobStar (C:\\Dokumente und Einstellungen\\Administrator\\Desktop\\glob-test\\node_modules\\glob\\sync.js:350:22)\n    at GlobSync._process (C:\\Dokumente und Einstellungen\\Administrator\\Desktop\\glob-test\\node_modules\\glob\\sync.js:130:10)\n    at new GlobSync (C:\\Dokumente und Einstellungen\\Administrator\\Desktop\\glob-test\\node_modules\\glob\\sync.js:48:10)\n    at Function.globSync [as sync] (C:\\Dokumente und Einstellungen\\Administrator\\Desktop\\glob-test\\node_modules\\glob\\sync.js:26:10)\n    at Object.<anonymous> (C:\\Dokumente und Einstellungen\\Administrator\\Desktop\\glob-test\\index.js:3:18)\n    at Module._compile (module.js:409:26)\n    at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:416:10)\n```\n\n## \n\nHowever, I don't know if this is intended, but I don't understand why the following error gets printed:\n\n``` js\ntry {\n    glob('d/**', function (err, files) {});\n} catch (err) {\n}\n```\n\n``` js\nC:\\Dokumente und Einstellungen\\Administrator\\Desktop\\glob-test>node index.js\nglob error { [Error: EPERM: operation not permitted, scandir 'C:\\Dokumente und Einstellungen\\Administrator\\Desktop\\glob-test\\d']\n  errno: -4048,\n  code: 'EPERM',\n  syscall: 'scandir',\n  path: 'C:\\\\Dokumente und Einstellungen\\\\Administrator\\\\Desktop\\\\glob-test\\\\d'\n}\n```\n. Just for the sake of completeness, `errSync` and `errAsync` are essential the same `'EPERM'` error:\n\n``` js\ntry {\n    glob.sync('d/**');\n} catch (errSync) {}\n\nglob('d/**', errAsync => {});\n```\n\nThe additional `glob error {\u2026}`, which only happens in async, has puzzled me a bit\u2026\n. > I don't know why it's warning in async and throwing in sync, though, that's strange. \n\nFound it:\n[sync.js#L336-L342](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/blob/f65f9eb7eda113528c5257b58fac4ca685ee6c4f/sync.js#L336-L342):\n\n``` js\n    default: // some unusual error.
