I think this was fixed by downloading the platform-tools artifact.\n. Sweet!\n. Why was the SDK folder deleted? This is an intentional failure since the project is specifying where it thinks the SDK is but it's not actually there.\n. It will download it if there is no `local.properties` and an `ANDROID_HOME` pointing at a specific folder. The presence of a `local.properties` means that the project was pointed at a real SDK and I treat its absence as a bug. \n. Excellent. Will fix! I'll take your word for it since I don't have a Windows box to test on (but I do remember the escaping horror from way back in the days that I did).\n. 07878b83f0371eb38c9ba9c5e77a00fdd6f0fe28\n\nI'd appreciate if you could test on Windows. I uploaded a 0.9.2-SNAPSHOT to Sonatype's snapshot Maven repository.\n. I'm not going to make the plugin install system packages. Downloading the SDK archive is one thing but installing packages is a whole different ball game. If compatibilities packages are needed then it is the responsibility of something else to install them.\n. I squashed and merged this onto `master`.\n. I'll add an extension so you can define extra artifacts to be downloaded in the `build.gradle`.\n. Closing in favor of the other issue. Hoping to get to this soon!\n. Won't have a chance to look until this weekend.\n. > Turns out the Android Gradle plugin is not including the M2 repositories anymore, and the dependencies cannot be resolved.\n\nI don't understand how this can be the case. If you have a dependency on the support library how is it adding the dependency then?\n.

Squashed, merged, and released.\n. Update to 0.10.x.\n. Are you using Hugo 1.1?\n. Awesome! Sadly it's too late to change Hugo over to a versioning scheme to match the Android plugin :(\n. I guess the thing this tool can do is check for empty directories. As to the failing of the unzip step, there's not really anything I can do there since that takes place inside of the Android SDK Manager.\n. Cool. I'll add that too.\n.

However, you can change your setup a bit to make it work properly.\n\nEnvironment variables declared in shell-specific init files aren't not honored for GUI applications on OS X (e.g., `.bash_profile`). You have to specify environment variables using `launchctl`:\n\n```\nlaunchctl setenv ANDROID_HOME /Development/android-sdk\n```\n\nIn order for this to be honored you will need to reboot (or maybe just log out and log back in).\n.

Merged manually with a tiny syntax tweak. Thanks!\n. I don't think this is the right approach to solve the problem. We should simply ignore the `android` closure bits when an android plugin has not been applied.\n. If all you have is a Robolectric dependency in a java module with a transitive dependency on the support library you don't need the build tools therefore the plugin should not download it.\n.

This is an intentional failure since the project is specifying where it thinks the SDK is but it's not actually there.\n. It will download it if there is no `local.properties` and an `ANDROID_HOME` pointing at a specific folder. The presence of a `local.properties` means that the project was pointed at a real SDK and I treat its absence as a bug. \n. Excellent. Will fix! I'll take your word for it since I don't have a Windows box to test on (but I do remember the escaping horror from way back in the days that I did).\n. 07878b83f0371eb38c9ba9c5e77a00fdd6f0fe28\n\nI'd appreciate if you could test on Windows. I uploaded a 0.9.2-SNAPSHOT to Sonatype's snapshot Maven repository.\n. I'm not going to make the plugin install system packages. Downloading the SDK archive is one thing but installing packages is a whole different ball game. If compatibilities packages are needed then it is the responsibility of something else to install them.\n. I squashed and merged this onto `master`.\n. I'll add an extension so you can define extra artifacts to be downloaded in the `build.gradle`.\n. Closing in favor of the other issue. Hoping to get to this soon!\n. Won't have a chance to look until this weekend.\n. > Turns out the Android Gradle plugin is not including the M2 repositories anymore, and the dependencies cannot be resolved.\n\nI don't understand how this can be the case.

As to the failing of the unzip step, there's not really anything I can do there since that takes place inside of the Android SDK Manager.\n. Cool. I'll add that too.\n.

Yes, gradle will do this scan anyway to determine if all dependencies are present for the build and can cache already downloaded values, but do we want to do it at the plugin? May not be obvious why for the plugin users.\n\nProof of concept is here: https://github.com/JakeWharton/sdk-manager-plugin/pull/98\n. That's a known issue already. (https://github.com/JakeWharton/sdk-manager-plugin/issues/10, https://github.com/JakeWharton/sdk-manager-plugin/issues/47)\n\nThis is due to the way gradle resolves dependency scope before any task is ever run and don't update it later.\n\nUse next workaround:\n\n```\n./gradlew clean --continue\n./gradlew clean assemble\n```\n. @ncalexan My best guess is that due to code\n\n```\n  def findDependenciesWithGroup(String group) {\n    def deps = []\n    for (Configuration configuration : project.configurations) {\n      for (Dependency dependency : configuration.dependencies) {\n        if (group.equals(dependency.group)) {\n          deps.add dependency\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    return deps\n  }\n```\n\nfrom here https://github.com/JakeWharton/sdk-manager-plugin/blob/master/src/main/groovy/com/jakewharton/sdkmanager/internal/PackageResolver.groovy#L271-L274 \nwhere sdk-manager-plugin scans project dependencies to find support libraries it also triggers gradle to resolve configuration. \nBecause of support lib isn't downloaded yet at that point and because of gradle caches resolved configuration then project sees unresolved dependencies (even though they are downloaded).\n\nUnfortunately, I don't see an api to skip cache and force to resolve dependencies again after downloading. https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.artifacts.Configuration.html#org.gradle.api.artifacts.Configuration:resolvedConfiguration\nIf you know how to trigger it, maybe a fix for this issue.\n. While Jake is busy with his pet project\\* we can use `jitpack.io` to get binaries:\n\n```\nbuildscript {\n    repositories {\n        jcenter()\n        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }\n    }\n    dependencies {\n        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:1.2.3'\n        classpath 'com.github.JakeWharton:sdk-manager-plugin:0ce4cdf08009d79223850a59959d9d6e774d0f77'\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhere `0ce4cdf08009d79223850a59959d9d6e774d0f77` is the HEAD commit SHA.\nIt's even better then -SNAPSHOT releases because we can fix source state by commit. \n\n\\* See what I did here with Moshi\n. That's a known issue already. See solution here:\nhttps://github.com/JakeWharton/sdk-manager-plugin/issues/73#issuecomment-106747867\n. this issue is tracked here https://github.com/JakeWharton/sdk-manager-plugin/issues/70\nSupport repository is downloaded, but gradle already resolved that dependency as missing and cached it. It's is unclear atm how to trigger gradle to force resolve dependencies again.\n. Travis can't download gradle wrapper... Could be temporal\nIs okay at mine fork https://travis-ci.org/plastiv/sdk-manager-plugin/builds/90905253\n. org.gradle.api.plugins:gradle-nexus-plugin:0.7.1 is not available at mavenCentral, I guess that is why jcenter is added already https://github.com/JakeWharton/sdk-manager-plugin/blob/master/build.gradle#L3\n\nBut latest version com.bmuschko:gradle-nexus-plugin:2.3.1 is present at mavenCentral. so that is not an issue. \n\nI wanted to keep single repository reference to avoid confusion, but it provoked more discussion then benefit :)\n. Same thing could be done for play-services check\n. This project directly depends on android gradle plugin api and has to be updated everytime googlers break that.\nIt would be nice to cut current changes into last 1.x release before migrating to 2.x.\n. Until release it is possible to use jitpack (replace commit sha with the latest one)\nhttps://github.com/JakeWharton/sdk-manager-plugin/issues/73#issuecomment-106747867\n. Before installing build tools `23.0.2` you need to upgrade android sdk to the latest version (`24.4.1` atm).\nForcing sdk to update is possible with this PR #87\n\nTo make sure if this is your case you can quickly check by appliyng fork with this PR included like this:\n\n```\nbuildscript {\n    repositories {\n        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }\n    }\n    dependencies {\n        classpath 'com.github.plastiv:sdk-manager-plugin:b04aea1cddf87e78db9a4372794d678f9e568c48'\n    }\n}\napply plugin: 'android-sdk-manager'\n\nsdkManager {\n    minSdkToolsVersion '24.4.1'\n}\n```\n\nAnd run `assemble`.\n. Right now plugin scans only top level dependencies, listed at the `build.gradle`. \nhttps://github.com/JakeWharton/sdk-manager-plugin/blob/master/src/main/groovy/com/jakewharton/sdkmanager/internal/PackageResolver.groovy#L272\nTo understand, that next library has nested child dependency\n\n```\ndependencies {    \n    compile 'com.etsy.android.grid:library:1.0.4'\n}\n```\n\nIn general case it is required to make internet connection to the repository to download pom file, for example. \nWhich means, that plugin wouldn't do local scan anymore and those numbers from the readme \n\n```\nIt currently takes about 100ms on average to check all of the above conditions.\n```\n\nmay no longer be true. Yes, gradle will do this scan anyway to determine if all dependencies are present for the build and can cache already downloaded values, but do we want to do it at the plugin? May not be obvious why for the plugin users.\n\nProof of concept is here: https://github.com/JakeWharton/sdk-manager-plugin/pull/98\n. That's a known issue already. (https://github.com/JakeWharton/sdk-manager-plugin/issues/10, https://github.com/JakeWharton/sdk-manager-plugin/issues/47)\n\nThis is due to the way gradle resolves dependency scope before any task is ever run and don't update it later.\n\nUse next workaround:\n\n```\n./gradlew clean --continue\n./gradlew clean assemble\n```\n. @ncalexan My best guess is that due to code\n\n```\n  def findDependenciesWithGroup(String group) {\n    def deps = []\n    for (Configuration configuration : project.configurations) {\n      for (Dependency dependency : configuration.dependencies) {\n        if (group.equals(dependency.group)) {\n          deps.add dependency\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    return deps\n  }\n```\n\nfrom here https://github.com/JakeWharton/sdk-manager-plugin/blob/master/src/main/groovy/com/jakewharton/sdkmanager/internal/PackageResolver.groovy#L271-L274 \nwhere sdk-manager-plugin scans project dependencies to find support libraries it also triggers gradle to resolve configuration. \nBecause of support lib isn't downloaded yet at that point and because of gradle caches resolved configuration then project sees unresolved dependencies (even though they are downloaded).\n\nUnfortunately, I don't see an api to skip cache and force to resolve dependencies again after downloading. https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.artifacts.Configuration.html#org.gradle.api.artifacts.Configuration:resolvedConfiguration\nIf you know how to trigger it, maybe a fix for this issue.\n. While Jake is busy with his pet project\\* we can use `jitpack.io` to get binaries:\n\n```\nbuildscript {\n    repositories {\n        jcenter()\n        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }\n    }\n    dependencies {\n        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:1.2.3'\n        classpath 'com.github.JakeWharton:sdk-manager-plugin:0ce4cdf08009d79223850a59959d9d6e774d0f77'\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhere `0ce4cdf08009d79223850a59959d9d6e774d0f77` is the HEAD commit SHA.\nIt's even better then -SNAPSHOT releases because we can fix source state by commit. \n\n\\* See what I did here with Moshi\n. That's a known issue already. See solution here:\nhttps://github.com/JakeWharton/sdk-manager-plugin/issues/73#issuecomment-106747867\n. this issue is tracked here https://github.com/JakeWharton/sdk-manager-plugin/issues/70\nSupport repository is downloaded, but gradle already resolved that dependency as missing and cached it. It's is unclear atm how to trigger gradle to force resolve dependencies again.\n. Travis can't download gradle wrapper... Could be temporal\nIs okay at mine fork https://travis-ci.org/plastiv/sdk-manager-plugin/builds/90905253\n. org.gradle.api.plugins:gradle-nexus-plugin:0.7.1 is not available at mavenCentral, I guess that is why jcenter is added already https://github.com/JakeWharton/sdk-manager-plugin/blob/master/build.gradle#L3\n\nBut latest version com.bmuschko:gradle-nexus-plugin:2.3.1 is present at mavenCentral. so that is not an issue. \n\nI wanted to keep single repository reference to avoid confusion, but it provoked more discussion then benefit :)\n. Same thing could be done for play-services check\n.

FYI: I thought it was happening because I was using an old version of play services, but I get this also when using latest (4.4.+)\n. Looks like, didn't see them because they were closed.\nHowever, the fix should be released, but by using 0.10.+ I still have this problem.\nIs there any info I can provide to help understanding why?\n. Perhaps this extract at debug level might be enough.

Strange.\n. I think I found the issue, you need to use listAll instead of listUpdate android command because once installed the tools don't appear in the list anymore\n. Your correct. Thanks\n. Yes\n. ",
