I have to decide supported jQuery versions. IMO supporting jQuery (>=1.7.0) makes sense because the Backbone also supports the same versions. Any idea? Thanks.\n. Summary of the above comment:\n- When we calculate the multiple CSS properties of an element using `jQuery.fn.css`, the efficiency of the method between ver. < 1.8 and >= 1.8 are quite different.\n  - Both of them invokes the `getComputedStyle` native function to get the final used values of all the CSS properties of an element.\n  - In ver. >= 1.8, the jQuery method can be executed with the array of properties. Then the native function will be invoked once.\n  - In ver. < 1.8, we have to execute the jQuery method many times. It means that the native function will also be invoked same times.\n  - Function invocation is really heavy in JavaScript.\n- Because `jQuery.fn.on` is being used and it is supported by jQuery >= 1.7, supporting 1.7 or later makes sense.\n  - I have already found that the current code can work with jQuery 1.7.2.\n\n---\n\nI got it.

I think textcomplete will be attached to the initially initialized editor instance, but not attached to instances initialized later. Isn't it? (I'm not familiar with the API of CKEditor). @ThomasVandenbon OK, I'll merge this patch and release the next version soon. @ThomasVandenbon jquery-textcomplete@1.8.1 is out \ud83d\ude04 . jquery-textcomplete@1.8.2 was released. Close in favor of 6186768661e6373fcf7e3d1eb4bc4897bef2cb3e. v1.8.4 was released with this patch. @mvlabat v1.8.3 was released . In your script, the `args` is already an Array object not `arguments`, so I ran new script as follows:\n\n``` js\nconsole.time('for');\n(function () {\n  return toArrayUsingFor(arguments);\n})(args);\nconsole.timeEnd('for');  // for: 0.279ms\n\nconsole.time('slice');\n(function () {\n  return toArrayUsingSlice(arguments);\n})(args);\nconsole.timeEnd('slice');  // slice: 0.136ms\n```\n\n200% faster!! Thank you for your PR :+1: \n. Hi!
