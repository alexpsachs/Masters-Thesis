    "jp9000": "CS_OWNDC shouldn't have anything to do with the hotkey control.  I've tested the hotkey controls and they seem fine as far as I can tell.  I used CS_OWNDC because I didn't want the text to draw onto the main window when it gets too long, but I now realize that I'm using the wrong text drawing function anyway, so I might adjust it\n. I don't know muf, I just download audacity and its volume meters are indeed quite good.  It seems to get the best of both.  As long as the code executes fast I have no problems with it personally.\n\nThat being said, I think most of these things are fairly subjective.\n\nAlso you have to acknowledge how awesome it is that someone came along and added this in.  Minor subjective details aside, this guy deserves a medal.  Especially after having to browse through my rather uncommented code :)\n. Keep your newer code handy, I'm going to put back in your older code so I can put in the newer audio code, as merging may be a bit painful at the moment, and I need to get this update out soon - also in this code I'm about to upload I had slightly modified your previous code to act more responsive, was just playing around with it at the time.\n\nI'm not too experienced with git, so forgive me in advance\n. Ah wait, I could have merged this..  okay, going to try to get everything back in order with your new code\n. And there we go, fixed it back to the new meter code..  sorry about that.  Wow I think I'm going to get smartgit as r1ch suggested to me after that.\n. Hey, by the way, I had to revert the main volume control code temporarily because people were totally confused by the new set up - sorry about that..  for example, if you set it to like 80%, the output levels would actually be somewhere around 30%, and people were getting really confused and thought it was a bug, so I just reverted it temporarily\n. Feel free to contribute to the project, I added you as a contributer, so if you wish to push changes feel free.  I'm still dabbling with the audio code though.  Audio timestamping issues have been a nightmare.  I'm still working to get the kinks out of the system unfortunately.\n\nMost of the time using the timestamp from IAudioCaptureClient::GetBuffer is fine, but on some mics/sound cards, time stamp information can basically end up being inaccurate or flat out invalid.  They're supposed to use QPC time in 100ns time, but they unfortunately don't always seem to use it, or sometimes don't care about time at all.  I am still trying to work out some solutions.  Fairly nightmarish situation.\n. I applied some of your patch internally and will be uploading it soon\n. Sounds good to me, citations and everything.  Sounded good when you showed it to me as well\n. Well this actually calls attention a design issue I think, if you add it for this source, then why not all, for example?  So I'm not entirely sure what to think..  it feels like a bandaid to my poorer design decisions.  I wouldn't mind necessarily doing it, but I need to think about it for a short while to see if there's a better way.  I'll probably end up adding it if I can't think of a better way\n. I'm sorry, I just haven't been able to really focus on things at the moment.  I don't really know how to deal with this issue yet.\n\nThe best idea I have at the moment is having a menu with common resolutions that can easily be selected and changed through.  I don't really know how to \"perfectly\" deal with it but unfortunately this sort of fix doesn't feel right.  Perhaps I'm being too picky, I don't quite know.  Though I can understand the frustration of having to deal with this situation it feels like there has to be a better way about solving this.\n. Oh okay, I see the problem then..  hmm, good point.  I'll add it then.\n. lol\n. Just so you know, if you use the original english translation for something, there's no real need to add it because it'll automatically default to the english translation anyway\n. I'm going to close this for the reason stated above - hope you don't mind.  If you wish I'll add it to the file manually later though, just message me on IRC\n. Ah, woops, unfortunately merged right after I just made a new release..  This will definitely be in all upcoming releases then.\n. thank you kindly!  manually merged in commit 490c79a4044329cc7fd3f17c30d0288df9b20fcf\n. Wow, how on earth did that happen..  Thank you for pointing that out\n. Hmm, looks good, thank you very much.  Also feel free to come and chat any time on the obsproject channel.\n. Thank you very much\n. I apologize if something was lost in translation to other languages.  It was originally meant as a joke.  If someone is changing the language away from the current language, then it's a joke that just says \"but I suppose you can't read this anyway\", a joke which they probably can't read, which is also a part of the joke.  I think arkkis is usually the one who does the finnish translations and keeps them up to date.\n\nI'll take it out because I'm not entirely sure it was translated with the same meaning.\n. Hold on, before I merge this code, I want you to make sure that it's not getting called every time the user drags the frame.  I don't want the swap chain to be recreated every time a user drags the edges of the window to resize\n. actually, looks okay, I'll check it after\n. duplicate pull request\n. _blinks_  ..What the..  I think I can easily say on behalf of everyone that you are godlike for taking the time to implement quicksync.  Just going to do a few tests and then merge it.  I give you my absolute most humble thanks\n. Email me some time if you wish to talk further more in depth, and I'm always around on IRC.  would love to talk to you about this some time.\n\nBy the way I didn't check the code too thoroughly, need to go over it some more and do some more testing, but it seems you're returning the encoded frame the same encoder call, which causes an unnecessary stall to the capture thread (I think).  If you do say a 20-frame delay with threading or something you could make the call asynchronous and give the encoder all the time it needs to encode the frame.  The encode function is designed to be asynchronous like that.\n. Well it stalls the main thread at the moment, as I mentioned above, I don't think it's operating asynchronously\n. I've fixed up some of the issues of async, though the frames have issues due to the fact that they're being overwritten constantly.  I will try copying the frames before sending to the encoder so the data doesn't get changed\n. Thanks again!\n. oh woops, I missed those.  thank you very much\n. thank you very much for your time\n. shousa!  it's good to see you.  hope all is well.  thank you for the translations again\n. Hey shousa - you actually can already use slower and any other preset by doing:  preset=slower as a custom x264 command; the reason why I did not include it and lower ones in the combo box is because users who didn't quite know what they were doing would select the slower presets.  I suppose the point is moot if the other slower presets are included, but they're more meant for lower resolutions.  I didn't really see any benefit added from slower even at lower resolutions, and I figured if someone really needed the preset, they could just type the preset manually as an x264 command.\n\nI know my reasoning probably isn't the best, but what do you think?\n. Oh, limited by bitrate?  Well I suppose you make a valid argument.  Okay, I'll include it.\n\n(Also you guys really need a better streaming service if you're restricted -that- much)\n. It also looks like you changed from CRLF to LF (which is fine, but messes up the commit a bit).\n\nIf you do this through crowdin, should this pull request be closed?\n\nI can't seem to merge it anyway due to conflicts.\n. should this be closed?\n. _twitches_\n. _kills Gol-D-Ace_\n. SACRELIGE\n. thanks, done, will be in next update\n. Thank you kindly\n. I don't mind, but two things before accepting:\n\n1.) Your virtual function placement breaks the API.  All new functions added to the class must go at the bottom of the class definition, otherwise it breaks all current plugins.\n\n2.) OBS1 doesn't use tabs.\n. Shousa - could you update that code and post again when it's good to go?\n. Woops, sorry for the delayed response, I'll check this out and verify this later today.\n\nI had actually turned off notifications because github is very verbose in how it sends out emails\n. reviewing\n. For example, I have one entry in my own from the directshow plugin that causes the entire thing to break:\n\ndevice : \\?\\usb#vid_041d&pid_082d&mi_10#7&14543079&0&0010#{65e8373d-8f56-11d0-a3b9-00a0c9221196}{bbefb6c7-2dc4-4139-bb8b-a58fba724083}\n\nThis is actually a valid entry.  Anyway, I already actually made the XConfig file parse json because we needed it for the auto-updater, so I'm sort of confused about what sort of json files you had been having troubles with.\n\nIn OBS2 we're just using the library jansson for parsing all config files rather than a custom parser.  My custom parser was meant to be a bit more like HJSON rather than JSON, but it should parse regular JSON just fine as well.\n. Could you give me an example json file that breaks the parser?\n. It's not valid JSON - as I said the parser is supposed to be able to parse both the HJSON-esque format I use for OBS files (which I'm ending up regretting having used originally) and JSON.  I'll check out your string\n. https://github.com/jp9000/OBS/commit/9de723ceb6a4157d0f19bbb427b87218e36eb17b\n\nDon't kill me, but I just ended up doing this myself because I felt like trying to distinguish the formats was more work than necessary in this case.  Let me know if I missed anything.\n\nThe reason why it worked with the JSON we were using was because the JSON we use for the auto updater had newlines, where as your string was all on one line, and I simply had forgot to account for that.\n\nI'm really sorry about you going to all that work\n. So with those defines in place to enable/disable it, does that mean it's safe for me to pull either way?  Just checking.\n\nSorry I didn't get to it right away.\n. sorry that this went under my rader. I will check it out.\n. Hey, wow I took a really long time to get around to answering this particular PR -- we don't actually really need it because the repo will eventually technically become deprecated.  We're trying to focus on the new version at https://github.com/jp9000/obs-studio\n. Oh thank you, I had been meaning to do this\n. You can edit your branch commits by using the interactive rebase to edit, squash, or reorder commits.  If you need to make a change to an earlier commit, you can use the interactive rebase and use 'edit' to edit the contents of that commit and/or its message.  When complete, force push your new fixes, and it will update the pull request and your commits on it.\n\nIf you made a change that you want to merge in to an earlier commit, interactive rebase can also do that with the 'fixup' command.  When doing the interactive rebase, place the offending commit that you wish to squash below the commit that you wish to squash it in to, and label it as 'fixup'.\n\nAlso, if you are not experienced with this and need help, let us know on the dev chat.  It's perfectly okay to not be experienced with git, just let us know and we'll help best we can.  #obs-dev on quakenet is the IRC channel if you need help with it.\n. We took a look over it and it's nice.  However, there is one minor thing -- in general settings and on the menu, it's just called 'scenes'.  We felt that was confusing because 'scenes' already occupies a name for a UI object, which is the main scenes list box.  Perhaps 'scene layout' would be better?  Not sure what to call it.\n. Is video even being used in this case?  If it's not, maybe it would be better to add an option to disable the video stream\n. https://github.com/jp9000/OBS/commit/bb8418deae449d943c1a56f71f6aa1696925af43 -- 3 commits in your pull request here are superfluous, so I just added it myself because I'm about to make a new update.\n\nIf you mess up a pull request, you can always fix it before it's merged by rebasing to alter history and then forcing updates to the branch.\n. Hm, interesting.  Thanks for pointing it out.\n. Okay, will take a look when I get a chance.\n. Appears to be a conflict by the way.  When you guys feels it's ready you'll have to rebase with master and resolve it.\n. I really should have read the original post.  I was originally assuming that you could import global sources from any other scene collection or scene collection file.  I don't like forcing the user to have some \"main\" scene collection, and I don't like that it makes it so that you can only import that way.\n\nIf there's some programming limitation that makes it a lot of work to do otherwise, then that's still better to deal with than forcing the problem on the user.\n. I've been in similar situations myself where I try a change and the design doesn't really work out -- it doesn't mean you didn't work hard on it.  I've done similar things in the past, and people have ended up yelling at me for them.  That's why it's always necessary to get more opinions, get more review.\n\nOn my own repos, I've actually stopped making big changes without having them reviewed.  You'll notice that almost all of my own big changes in the obs-studio repo recently have been pull requests.  People will discuss the changes and go over what they like and dislike.  It's actually a healthy environment.\n\nStill thinking about these changes though.  There doesn't seem to be any really 'ideal' solution in this case.  The whole scenes/sources ideology is probably what causes these sort of problems more than anything.\n. I AM PLEASED.  You don't have to worry about what I think. it's what the users will think.  You just have to remember that there are some users out there that have difficulty figuring out how to even turn on their own computer, so things always have to make sense and not have unusual or implicit functionality.\n\nI made the mistake of implicit functionality with OBS1 too many times, so I'm simply sharing from experience there.\n. If the pull request is only partially working or has bugs then I'm somewhat hesitant to merge it.\n. The parsing stuff as I said doesn't need to be included, but it really can't have major bugs like that.  I'm sure there are ways of dealing with that situation aren't there?  In OBS1 if a source is no longer in use it's simply destroyed.  It should be possible to communicate with the thread to get it to shut down.\n. Wait wait!  We can help you fix it or something if you want.  I don't want you to just close it.  It's good stuff\n. Or are you just closing it to try to fix it?  I don't want you to toss out the code or anything.\n. I have a backup of your code.  I will fix the thread issue and post it on a branch, and I am going to merge it unless there are any objections.  Most likely the more ideal way to handle it would be by doing the HTTP stuff in tick instead of using a thread.\n. I did a checkout of it.  As it currently is, I feel like it should be renamed to \"export scene\" perhaps.\n\nIf you want to export to another scene collection, it'd probably be better to have a sub-menu that lists the scenes to export it to.  For example, you click on \"Copy To\" and it would pop up a sub-menu from there with the list of the other scene collections currently available.\n. Eep, no no, I'm terrible sorry, what I meant was that if it exports to a file, it should be labelled export.  If it copies to another scene collection, then 'copy to' feels more correct.  Sorry about the confusion.\n. Okay, looks good.\n\nFew more things:\n1.) You should make it so it excludes the current scene collection.\n2.) It also seems to copy over the references to global sources even if global sources don't exist in the target scene collection.\n. Seems to work alright for me.  Thanks for listening to all of our feedback.\n. I know it's been a while -- but new and duplicate function identically.  New should bring up a clean unmodified profile.  Would be nice to have.\n\nI'm sorry I haven't had much time to get around to OBS1 pull requests.\n. Merged here with modifications, (kept the buttons in the general dialog pane, a little redundancy doesn't hurt):  https://github.com/jp9000/OBS/commit/ffe212bdee2efd2e2b3e8ec582e4221f776f43b6\n. Sorry for the delay.  Been more caught up in OBS2 stuff than OBS1 stuff.  New virtual functions must be inserted at the end of the class, not in the middle of the class among other functions, lest it break ABI.\n. Modified and manually merged:  https://github.com/jp9000/OBS/commit/658800ee2ea760f3d232d0f4405d75d1d4c4af18\n. Merged, with a slight modification:  https://github.com/jp9000/OBS/commit/1a9d90c8452848fa4c0de39418c7f2959484e835\n. Terribly sorry about the confusion, but due to the way we have our translation handling set up, you need to use crowdin for translation additions/changes/discussion, the page is here:  https://crowdin.com/project/obsproject\n. Thank you, though readme isn't necessary for this project at the moment, this particular repo is kind of going to be deprecated soon, in favor of the newer version (as soon as I finish the rest of the features and get it back to parity).  If a readme is created, it'll probably end up pointing people toward the newer version of the project.\n\n(I also sort of prefer text-only as well, markup is nice for browsers but it's not very nice if you aren't viewing it with a regular old text editor.  I admit I might be somewhat old-fashioned.)\n. Yep, this needs to be added via crowdin.  Thank you for pointing it out.\n. Thank you very much for fixing this issue.  It works great.\n. Merged here:  https://github.com/jp9000/OBS/commit/6ed7721c7d4c43ef2a7409bf3c2f49e0ca1806da\n\n1.) got rid of whitespace and changed the commit formatting.\n2.) Squished those last two commits together.\n3.) Also fixed up a case where buffering might not have been turned on automatically\n. I think you're looking for the VCE thread here:  https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/obs-branch-with-amd-vce-support.13996/\n\nWhat you did here was made a pull request for the main project, which appears to be not what you were aiming to do.\n. If you really want this functionality for whatever reason I'd recommend using the multiplatform version which has no limits.\n\nNot that anyone can really live encode at 144 frames per second.\n. We're not really working on the project anymore (we're working on https://github.com/jp9000/obs-studio ), although I suppose I don't mind because it's a small bugfix, and your solution works\n. We're not really accepting this sort of stuff at this point in time.  There are very good reasons why the project isn't being actively developed, as you've seen.  We're accepting only bug fixes and minor tweaks at this point.  Feel free to run the static analysis and fix the bugs you encounter with them, I'm willing to merge them if you do that, but at this point those of us who are doing active development are on the new version of the project.\n\nSo if you have time, fix the static analysis bugs, submit, and if they're okay I'll merge.  I'm not personally going to go through all the static analysis results myself though at this point in time though.\n. Finally got this confirmed.\n. yea, going to revert and hotfix\n. CS_OWNDC shouldn't have anything to do with the hotkey control.  I've tested the hotkey controls and they seem fine as far as I can tell.  I used CS_OWNDC because I didn't want the text to draw onto the main window when it gets too long, but I now realize that I'm using the wrong text drawing function anyway, so I might adjust it\n.

We're trying to focus on the new version at https://github.com/jp9000/obs-studio\n. Oh thank you, I had been meaning to do this\n. You can edit your branch commits by using the interactive rebase to edit, squash, or reorder commits.  If you need to make a change to an earlier commit, you can use the interactive rebase and use 'edit' to edit the contents of that commit and/or its message.  When complete, force push your new fixes, and it will update the pull request and your commits on it.\n\nIf you made a change that you want to merge in to an earlier commit, interactive rebase can also do that with the 'fixup' command.  When doing the interactive rebase, place the offending commit that you wish to squash below the commit that you wish to squash it in to, and label it as 'fixup'.\n\nAlso, if you are not experienced with this and need help, let us know on the dev chat.  It's perfectly okay to not be experienced with git, just let us know and we'll help best we can.  #obs-dev on quakenet is the IRC channel if you need help with it.\n. We took a look over it and it's nice.  However, there is one minor thing -- in general settings and on the menu, it's just called 'scenes'.  We felt that was confusing because 'scenes' already occupies a name for a UI object, which is the main scenes list box.  Perhaps 'scene layout' would be better?  Not sure what to call it.\n. Is video even being used in this case?  If it's not, maybe it would be better to add an option to disable the video stream\n. https://github.com/jp9000/OBS/commit/bb8418deae449d943c1a56f71f6aa1696925af43 -- 3 commits in your pull request here are superfluous, so I just added it myself because I'm about to make a new update.\n\nIf you mess up a pull request, you can always fix it before it's merged by rebasing to alter history and then forcing updates to the branch.\n. Hm, interesting.  Thanks for pointing it out.\n. Okay, will take a look when I get a chance.\n. Appears to be a conflict by the way.  When you guys feels it's ready you'll have to rebase with master and resolve it.\n. I really should have read the original post.  I was originally assuming that you could import global sources from any other scene collection or scene collection file.  I don't like forcing the user to have some \"main\" scene collection, and I don't like that it makes it so that you can only import that way.\n\nIf there's some programming limitation that makes it a lot of work to do otherwise, then that's still better to deal with than forcing the problem on the user.\n. I've been in similar situations myself where I try a change and the design doesn't really work out -- it doesn't mean you didn't work hard on it.  I've done similar things in the past, and people have ended up yelling at me for them.  That's why it's always necessary to get more opinions, get more review.\n\nOn my own repos, I've actually stopped making big changes without having them reviewed.  You'll notice that almost all of my own big changes in the obs-studio repo recently have been pull requests.  People will discuss the changes and go over what they like and dislike.  It's actually a healthy environment.\n\nStill thinking about these changes though.  There doesn't seem to be any really 'ideal' solution in this case.  The whole scenes/sources ideology is probably what causes these sort of problems more than anything.\n. I AM PLEASED.  You don't have to worry about what I think. it's what the users will think.  You just have to remember that there are some users out there that have difficulty figuring out how to even turn on their own computer, so things always have to make sense and not have unusual or implicit functionality.\n\nI made the mistake of implicit functionality with OBS1 too many times, so I'm simply sharing from experience there.\n. If the pull request is only partially working or has bugs then I'm somewhat hesitant to merge it.\n. The parsing stuff as I said doesn't need to be included, but it really can't have major bugs like that.  I'm sure there are ways of dealing with that situation aren't there?  In OBS1 if a source is no longer in use it's simply destroyed.  It should be possible to communicate with the thread to get it to shut down.\n. Wait wait!  We can help you fix it or something if you want.  I don't want you to just close it.  It's good stuff\n. Or are you just closing it to try to fix it?  I don't want you to toss out the code or anything.\n. I have a backup of your code.  I will fix the thread issue and post it on a branch, and I am going to merge it unless there are any objections.  Most likely the more ideal way to handle it would be by doing the HTTP stuff in tick instead of using a thread.\n. I did a checkout of it.  As it currently is, I feel like it should be renamed to \"export scene\" perhaps.\n\nIf you want to export to another scene collection, it'd probably be better to have a sub-menu that lists the scenes to export it to.  For example, you click on \"Copy To\" and it would pop up a sub-menu from there with the list of the other scene collections currently available.\n. Eep, no no, I'm terrible sorry, what I meant was that if it exports to a file, it should be labelled export.  If it copies to another scene collection, then 'copy to' feels more correct.  Sorry about the confusion.\n. Okay, looks good.\n\nFew more things:\n1.) You should make it so it excludes the current scene collection.\n2.) It also seems to copy over the references to global sources even if global sources don't exist in the target scene collection.\n. Seems to work alright for me.  Thanks for listening to all of our feedback.\n. I know it's been a while -- but new and duplicate function identically.  New should bring up a clean unmodified profile.  Would be nice to have.\n\nI'm sorry I haven't had much time to get around to OBS1 pull requests.\n. Merged here with modifications, (kept the buttons in the general dialog pane, a little redundancy doesn't hurt):  https://github.com/jp9000/OBS/commit/ffe212bdee2efd2e2b3e8ec582e4221f776f43b6\n. Sorry for the delay.  Been more caught up in OBS2 stuff than OBS1 stuff.  New virtual functions must be inserted at the end of the class, not in the middle of the class among other functions, lest it break ABI.\n. Modified and manually merged:  https://github.com/jp9000/OBS/commit/658800ee2ea760f3d232d0f4405d75d1d4c4af18\n.

Terribly sorry about the confusion, but due to the way we have our translation handling set up, you need to use crowdin for translation additions/changes/discussion, the page is here:  https://crowdin.com/project/obsproject\n. Thank you, though readme isn't necessary for this project at the moment, this particular repo is kind of going to be deprecated soon, in favor of the newer version (as soon as I finish the rest of the features and get it back to parity).  If a readme is created, it'll probably end up pointing people toward the newer version of the project.\n\n(I also sort of prefer text-only as well, markup is nice for browsers but it's not very nice if you aren't viewing it with a regular old text editor.  I admit I might be somewhat old-fashioned.)\n. Yep, this needs to be added via crowdin.  Thank you for pointing it out.\n. Thank you very much for fixing this issue.  It works great.\n. Merged here:  https://github.com/jp9000/OBS/commit/6ed7721c7d4c43ef2a7409bf3c2f49e0ca1806da\n\n1.) got rid of whitespace and changed the commit formatting.\n2.) Squished those last two commits together.\n3.) Also fixed up a case where buffering might not have been turned on automatically\n. I think you're looking for the VCE thread here:  https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/obs-branch-with-amd-vce-support.13996/\n\nWhat you did here was made a pull request for the main project, which appears to be not what you were aiming to do.\n. If you really want this functionality for whatever reason I'd recommend using the multiplatform version which has no limits.\n\nNot that anyone can really live encode at 144 frames per second.\n. We're not really working on the project anymore (we're working on https://github.com/jp9000/obs-studio ), although I suppose I don't mind because it's a small bugfix, and your solution works\n. We're not really accepting this sort of stuff at this point in time.  There are very good reasons why the project isn't being actively developed, as you've seen.  We're accepting only bug fixes and minor tweaks at this point.  Feel free to run the static analysis and fix the bugs you encounter with them, I'm willing to merge them if you do that, but at this point those of us who are doing active development are on the new version of the project.\n\nSo if you have time, fix the static analysis bugs, submit, and if they're okay I'll merge.  I'm not personally going to go through all the static analysis results myself though at this point in time though.\n. Finally got this confirmed.\n. yea, going to revert and hotfix\n. ",
    "notr1ch": "This looks great! I was thinking of doing something similar myself when I had some time. One note, the OBS code makes use of spaces (not tabs) for indentation, it seems your code includes a number of tabs. If you make any further changes, we'd appreciate it if you could switch to spaces for indentation to keep things consistent with the coding style in OBS.\n. I just noticed your code in MultiplyAudioBuffer is only counting two samples of the audio, is this intended? The SSE2 code is scaling the majority of the samples which do not get added to the sum.\n\nAlso the smoothing (alpha) applied to the values seems to cause a delay of the meter updating in response to audio, which could make it difficult to isolate sources causing high volume.\n. I've been playing around with this for an hour or so, some more feedback:\n\nVOL_MAX is set to 6, but since a scale of 1.0 is 0dB, I don't see how the red segment is ever used since it's impossible to go higher than 0dB.\n\nThe display of the volume bar itself could also be logarithmic, eg the range -70 through -20 is pretty quiet, yet the bar jumps around quite a lot, making larger changes in volume across the -20 to 0dB range less apparent. http://www.darkwooddesigns.co.uk/pc2/testgen.html has a good example of a scaled meter, and this program also seems to respond much better to audio changes (eg clapping my hands will instantly register a peak on this app, versus a small increase in OBS).\n. Thanks! One thing that I feel is really strange with this version is that the peak level indicator moves higher than the actual level bar itself. Eg, clapping my hands will result in a 0dB peak / clipping, yet the audio bar itself never even went into the yellow section.

Here's videos of both in action:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pciUSm3mP9M&feature=youtu.be\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzlAMZjpOFA&feature=youtu.be\n\nI think the gradient is nice aesthetically, and you kind of get a sense of where the RMS is. On the other hand with the solid bars the RMS and peaks can be both be seen fairly clearly. The imprecision of the gradient might not be a problem since we're not even labeling the dB ticks or anything. \n\nLet me know what you guys think :)\n. I will point out that the plugin events api provides a mechanism for something like this, your plugin has to export OnStreamStatus and you will receive events for when this changes. Here is a commit that modified some of this stuff https://github.com/jp9000/OBS/commit/28ae32920ead6ef03fe7193e8961f461ba0e8ed8\n\nYou can see where I am using it in OBSRemote: https://github.com/bilhamil/OBSRemote/blob/master/WebSocketAPIPlugin/MessageHandling.cpp#L562\n.

    "mufunyo": "I'm strongly leaning towards ditching RMS altogether. Balancing different sources is a legitimate use for it though.\nIf RMS is important to keep, here's something I proposed on IRC:\n\nhttp://img33.imageshack.us/img33/5172/meterq.png\n\nThe RMS is dark green, and the peak is a gradient between that and light green. It allows you to use the information that RMS gives you without distracting from the important peak reading.\n\nAlso, in the current implementation there are two things that irk me: one is that the background is a darker green/yellow/red, which is distracting imho-- it should just be dark grey. The other is that yellow seems to serve no real purpose. In any normal recording the meter is going to be yellow most of the time, yet that shouldn't be any cause for concern as the sample range for yellow is not even close to clipping. Anything that is \"business as usual\" should be green. I would propose a very small yellow range, and reserve red for true clipping only.\n\nAnother thing is that stereo meters might be useful.\n. Jim, +1 on this being an awesome contribution. There is only so much you can implement yourself, and having someone dedicate time to a single feature is a tremendous help. Lots of people have requested audio levels as well.\n\nAbout what Audacity does, I didn't download it myself and tried to figure out what exactly it is that it does based on the Wiki Talk comments, but I couldn't really figure it out conclusively. Reading what you said, Bill, it's probably along the same lines as what I had in mind (only they use two solid colours and I suggested a gradient). In any case, I'm looking forward to seeing your proposal. :)\n. I think the gradient looks perfect. It might seem a bit imprecise now but once the UI gets updated to show the volume bars vertically they'll be a lot bigger and easier to see. I maintain that the audacity way looks like there are two volume bars which is guaranteed to confuse people. Great work, Bill!\n. I'm strongly leaning towards ditching RMS altogether.

Thanks - I was having a major fight with Git.\n. Thanks Jim. Pretty sure I'm running the directshow plugin so surprised that didn't show up.\n\nThe JSON I'm parsing is straight out of a PHP website. It is on a single line - so using ',' as a seperator between name/value pairs. I put an example web API response in a comment.\n\nAre you okay with the concept here? It allows me to wire OBS into services like Brightcove where the stream URL and/or key rotates every 30 seconds (it allows them to manage capacity on the servers but makes it awkward for OBS users since they need to get their stream started quickly).\n.
