The fullscreen api is meant to be used on a single page.

Keep questions on StackOverflow ;)\n. Unfortunately that wouldn't work as it can be only be brought into fullscreen by a real user even on an element on the page (bookmarklet button doesn't count).\n. I also don't see the point. Browsers have built-in functionality in its GUI for toggling fullscreen.\n. http://chrome.google.com\n. No thanks. You can easily use the RJS shim config.\n. `MSFullscreenerror` too then I assume?\n. Thanks :)\n. That's strange, but as you said; it's happening with the native events, which I can't really do anything about.\n. https://github.com/sindresorhus/negative-array/issues/2\n. You don't need screenfull for the video element API, just use it directly. I'm not going to complicate the code for an outdated edge case like this.\n. I don't know, but I would ask on StackOverflow as this is more a general question about the JS Fullscreen API.\n. https://github.com/sindresorhus/screenfull.js#request\n\n> Keep in mind that the browser will only enter fullscreen when initiated by user events like click, touch, key.\n\nThis is a security measure in the browser itself. Nothing can be done about it.\n. lgtm. thanks!\n. Questions => StackOverflow\n. _slaps_ @sindresorhus\n. Thanks :)\n. 0.2.1\n. Definitely not an issue with screenfull.js as it's just a sugar upon the native API. Sounds like a Chrome bug.\n. Why? It doesn't work server-side anyways.\n. Browser libs assumes a browser environment. Just exclude this lib and any others you don't need there.\n. Thanks, but I don't want to disable zooming.\n. no thanks\n. > RequireJS something you have no interest in supporting?\n\nyes\n. No, but feel free to do it if you want to ;)\n. That's how the fullscreen API works in Chrome. This lib doesn't implement the actual fullscreening, but rather wraps it in a nicer and cross-browser API.\n. iOS doesn't support the Fullscreen API.\n. The fullscreen on the iPad is completely different from what's used here. Once upon a time Apple invented their own way to do fullscreening for videos, and only videos. That's what the iPad uses. I'm not adding support for it as it's legacy, properitary and only supports fullscreening videos.\n. Already mentioned in the readme: https://github.com/sindresorhus/screenfull.js#support ;)\n. fixed https://github.com/sindresorhus/screenfull.js/commit/1ad2c970569da1b0317cb74bdb41d683b6b1993d\n. Not really. Only way I can think of is browser-sniffing and not super interested in adding that.\n. Not that I'm aware of. At least in Chrome the \"native\" fullscreen is also different from the programmatic fullscreen, where the former shows the tabs. So you would still want to enter the programmatic fullscreen even if the user is already in the former one.\n. This module is just a wrapper around the native APIs. Any behaviour bug is a bug in the browser itself.\n. For CommonJS it's using `module.exports`, not window: https://github.com/sindresorhus/screenfull.js/blob/46c1db251b1fece41a7097eece969a74100788b1/src/screenfull.js#L145-L146\n. iOS8 doesn't support the fullscreen API: http://caniuse.com/#feat=fullscreen\n.

You have to expand to see it as it's only a tag. I guess I can add a message, but you can just as easily look at the commit history. Nothing interesting anyways. Just removed a couple of deprecated methods.\n\n> And sadly, on https://cdnjs.com/libraries/screenfull.js it's only 1.0.4\n\nYeah. No idea how to update that. And don't really care tbh. Feel free to do it though.\n. A feature. Bower packages shouldn't contain minified files.\n\nNothing new in this release other than removal of a couple of deprecated methods though. So just don't upgrade.\n. https://github.com/sindresorhus/screenfull.js/issues/66\n. Oops, thanks for letting me know. Done ;)\n. Sounds like a bug with Chrome. This plugin just wraps the native APIs so not much I can do about it.\n\nMake sure you're fullscreening the document though, and not an element. You could also try setting the body/html width/height to 100%.\n\nMight also want to open a Chrome bug ticket (though make sure to include a reproducible test case):\nhttps://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list\n. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask\n. That's intentional. You absolutely shouldn't directly link that. GitHub has hotlink limits. Rather use the referenced CDN link if you want to directly link to the script ;)\n. No thanks\n. Use StackOverflow for support questions: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask\n. Duplicate of #67 \n. I agree, PR welcome ;)\n. Tape or Mocha.\n. I really hope nobody does. No reason to uselessly wrap it in jQuery.\n. That's how the native API works. This is just a small wrapper. Nothing I can do anything about.\n. I would usually agree, but Angular is super popular, so why not. If we get many more I'll just move them to links at the bottom instead.\n. From the readme:\n\n> Safari doesn't support use of the keyboard in fullscreen.\n. This module is made for the browser. If you want to do server-side rendering with browser libs it's your responsibility to shim document/window, not the responsibility of every single lib you use.\n. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask\n. You need to listen to the [`fullscreenchange` event](https://github.com/sindresorhus/screenfull.js#raw). Your issue is just JS, though. Nothing specifically to do with this module.\n. That is intentional. See closed issues.\n. Both. I wrote that Bower guideline.\n. No thanks.\n\nhttps://github.com/sindresorhus/screenfull.js/releases/tag/v3.0.0\n. No thanks\n. Thanks :)\n. I appreciate the PR, but this module is feature complete, so not interested in adding those properties. You can access them at `screenfull.raw.fullscreenchange` and `screenfull.raw.fullscreenerror`.. The methods also needs to be documented in the readme.. Thanks, but I don't want to add more bloat to the readme. It already documents way more than I would have liked..
