I somehow didn't understand how pull requests work until now, because I pushed this commit after I made the pull request and thought it won't be included in the pull request this way, sorry for that! The other commits are meant to be included though :)\n\ncheers Matthias\n. Thanks for merging. The old debate about indentation-styles, always a pleasure to discuss :) This was on oversight of mine, I normally adapt my coding style in favour of the predominant style if I contribute to OpenSource-Projects.\n\nThanks for the attributions, but I guess my friend Peter (@steipete) deserves them more then me, because all I did was the refactoring and copy-paste :)\n.
