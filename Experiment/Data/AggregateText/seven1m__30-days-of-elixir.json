Thanks!!\n. Sorry I haven't played with Elixir since version 0.13, but it appears that the list comprehension syntax changed before 1.0 was released. It appears that this:\n\n```\nsome = lc n inlist sample, String.first(n) < \"M\", do: n <> \" Morgan\"\n```\n\n...should become this:\n\n```\nsome = for n <- sample, String.first(n) < \"M\", do: n <> \" Morgan\"\n```\n\nSee here: http://elixir-lang.org/getting_started/18.html\n\nI haven't tried this, but if it works, would you make a Pull Request to fix it? I'd like to update this repo to work with Elixir 1.0.\n\nThanks!\n. Awesome, thanks!!!\n. Closed with #8.\n. Awesome!\n. Cool thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Great thanks!\n. @eddwardo this same thing was done on day 24. I'd like to leave it there as it's a more advanced topic.\n. Looks great! With exception of the regex feedback, would merge.\n. Great!
