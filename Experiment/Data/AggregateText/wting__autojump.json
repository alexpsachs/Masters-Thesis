    "joelthelion": "Thank you very much for the bug report! I don't know what caused the problem (it could be a ton of things), but since a few weeks, I've added code that keeps a backup version of the database, updated everyday. In the next few days I will add code to automatically recover from the backup in the case you report.\n. I just commited a fix, It should be fixed now. Can you test the new version for a few days and tell me if you encounter any problems?\n. Closing the issue. Don't hesitate to reopen if the issue is not solved for you :)\n. Oops, this sucks!\n\nThe difference between v7 and this commit is just a change in the README, so I doubt this update is the cause of your problem. Just to be sure, can you try logging in from a console? (Alt+Ctrl+2 for example, I hope ubuntu has these)\nSend me any error message you get.\n. It's probably not doing the PROMPT_COMMAND. Can you give me the output of the following command?\n\n```\necho $PROMPT_COMMAND\n```\n\nAlso, which shell are you using?\n. > I am using git-prompt (http://github.com/lvv/git-prompt/)\n> \n> I'm using bash\n> \n> echo $PROMPT_COMMAND\n> prompt_command_function\n\nIt seems git-prompt is not playing nicely, and overrides the prompt command. Autojump won't work if the prompt command is overwritten. Autojump on the other hand respects other tools in the prompt command and adds itself to the list without removing the other ones.\n\nLong story short: either reinstall autojump or submit a bug report to the git-prompt maintainer (or better, do both :))\n\nPS: please answer in the issue; i nearly missed your message.\n. Hi!\n\nIt's really OS X that's broken in this case, because in all the other distros the bash_profile already calls the bashrc. Hence adding it to the bash_profile with the installer would add it twice for all the other users...\n\nMaybe we should create an OS X-specific installer? If you think this is a good idea, can you fork the project, and add your fixed version of the installer? (install.macosx.sh ?)\n\nI'll then add it to my repo.\n. That seems to be a good idea as well.\n. I won't hesitate :)\n. echo is fine. Autojump doesn't work with sh anyways. Thanks for the patch!\n. I've added the shebang as well.\n. Could you elaborate? What do you mean by \"it doesn't work right\"? Does it spit out some error messages? If so, it could be useful to post them.\n. It looks like the alias ('j' is a bash alias) isn't being set properly.\n. Can you try sourcing .bashrc manually and see if it works better?\n\n```\nsource ~/.bashrc\n```\n\nAlso, not that it makes a difference, but j is actually a bash function, not an alias.\n. > Also joel I just read your article on java schools and as someone who took intro CS at Penn I feel a little cheated.\n\nI think you're mistaking me for someone else :) But hey I'm glad you finally got autojump to work.\n. Is this simply a matter of fixing the installer? If that's the case I think it's a trivial fix...\n\nI unfortunately don't have access to a mac, so I can't really do it myself, but if you submit a fix, I'll gladly integrate it.\n. OK, I agree, but how should I do it? is PREFIX an environment variable I should poll?\n. Would it work with a environment variable as well? It would be a lot simpler to implement than the command line parsing.\n. DataSurfer (or someone else) : would you be willing to write the homebrew formula if I implement the prefix in the installer?\n. > I find it perplexing that the getopts function in bash does not support GNU extension long flag names\n\nSame here :) Maybe we should just rewrite the installer in python?\n. > I'll volunteer to write the formula.\n\nGreat! Just give me a few days to find a good solution to the prefix problem.\n. Ok, I have pushed an implementation of --prefix for the bash installer. Let me know if it works for you!\n. Neat! I merged in your patch. Can I close the issue now?\n. Could you tell me what still needs to be done?\n. I just tried\n\n```\n./install.zsh --prefix /usr\n```\n\nand it seems to work on my machine? I don't think we should use getopts, I tried using it in the past and didn't like it much.\n. I'll just assume this works now, closing.\n. Ah yes, I know what the problem is, your python version is too old for generator expression. Is it possible for you to upgrade to a more recent python version. If it's not, I can try to make it compatible, but I don't know if it is possible easily. No guarantees :)\n. This is because + and \\* are special characters in regular expressions. I could use a simple search instead, but people who use regexps might not be happy about it...\n\nI need some time to think this through. Thanks for the report!\n. Should be fixed now. Please reopen if it still doesn't work.\n. Hi,\n\nI will look into it as soon as I get a chance.\n\njoel\n. Bonjour Olivier,\n\nIt should be fixed now. Can you confirm that it works?\n. > I keep making autojump huge publicity (b\u00e9po, zeitgeist\u2026).\n\nGreat! That means a lot to me :)\n. Hi!\n\nI understand your 'problem' perfectly, but I think things are working fine! Actually, when I first started autojump, it worked the way you describe; but I found out that the amount of work you perform in a directory is what counts, not the number of times you \"cd\" to it.\n\nIn any case, this would be pretty easy for you to change, but I'd suggest using the standard autojump for a week or two before making the change. You might change your mind :)\n. Hi,\n\nCould you give me the output of the the \"alias\" and the \"jumpstat\" command, and tell me what directory you are trying to complete? (give me the state of the command line when you press tab, as well as the directory you think it should complete).\n. Hi Jake,\n\nI think everything is actually working properly! Autojump isn't a replacement for cd, but a complement. You should wait a bit more for the database to fill itself, and then you'll be able to use autojump to move back and forth between your most used directories, using autocompletion if you want. For now since you have only one directory in the database, it's not very useful yet :)\n\nLet me know if you need more help!\n\njoel\n. Indeed, it actually learns every time you type a command, not only when you change directories. You can check the current state of the database with \"jumpstat\".\n. Good point :) I guess I'll have to think of a new tagline...\n. I agree that would be nice, but I don't think all major distros respect that specification (yet). I just tested on my opensuse system, and these environment variables aren't enabled. I also highly doubt that cygwin and mac set them correctly (these are a big part of my users).\n\nSo in conclusion: why not in a few years, but I think this is a bit premature for now.\n. Not a bad idea :) I'll have to think of a way to seamlessly migrate people, though.\n. I tried to implement your idea; can you comment on it? Note that for simplicity I put everything in the XDG_DATA_HOME directory.\n. Great! Thanks for the input!\n. What prevents you from putting autojump on the remote hosts? At least, that's how I do it. (note that you don't have to be root to install autojump, you simply have to install it manually in that case).\n. Why would you need to convince other people to use it? (note that I don't doubt you have a good reason for this, I just want to make sure I understand your use case; it's people like you who have helped me make autojump as good as it is now :) )\n. Another way you could do this is by sharing the autojump data files between the different machines: recent autojump versions ignore directories that don't exist.\n. > I want to restrict it to my main computer because I work on customers' productions systems, and I don't want to install (please, bare with the term) \"exotic\" software on it yet.\n\nHeck, I wouldn't do it either! :-D\n\nTo come back to your original question, I really don't have a clue as to how you would implement that without installing software on the remote machine. The whole point of ssh is that the commands you send are executed remotely and not locally! If you think of a solution, I'd be glad to hear it, though :)\n. I'd love to help you out, but I use bash myself and zsh completion works perfectly on all of my machines...\n\nIs autojump the only application that has a problem? What distro are you using? Can you try using autojump on a fresh user account to see if one of your customizations could be the problem?\n. Could you provide a patch for the zsh installer? I could probably do it, but since I don't use zsh, there's a significant probability that I would mess up :)\n\nAbout the bash installer, I guess the problem is in a patch from another guy I merged in recently. But I can't reproduce the problem on my computer...\n. Ok, I think I've solved the problem. What do you think of the solution?\n\nhttp://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/commit/512db419e1470af77c544ecbedad5dae9221ddda\n. Ok, I'm considering the issue to be closed. Don't hesitate to reopen if that is not the case!\n. Hi, thanks for the report! That's a very weird error... Could you send me the contents of your ~/.local/share/autojump directory (pm me for email) as well as the output of \"python -v\"?\n\nThanks!\n. Did you update autojump recently? If not, please do so, and tell me if the problem persists.\n. I'm glad it works for you now, although I suspect there is a robustness issue to be solved somewhere...\n. Thanks for the report! I can't reproduce on my computer, so could you send me the contents of your ~/.local/share/autojump/ directory? Could you also send me the output of \"autojump --completion main\"?\nAlso, are you sure both directories exist (could they be on a removable drive?) at the moment you try to use the completion?\n. Ok, don't hesitate to reopen if the problem reappears!\n. Hi,\n\nThat seems like a good idea, but I'm afraid it could mess things up for the (many) people who have already installed to /usr. Any idea on how to make the transition smooth?\n. I agree this is the way it should be, but I won't fix it, because,\n\n1) it will cause problems with existing installs,\nand 2) it's not worth it.\n. I've added a few files. Let me know if more are missing.\n. Thanks, good job, but i'll stick with python2 for a while. The reason is, many of my users don't have python3 on their systems. When python3 becomes more widely distributed, I'll make the switch. As you said, it's not that big a deal.\n. Actually, the current version of autojump is compatible with both versions of python: it should support everything from 2.6 to 3.x.\n. I'm glad you found a version that works for you!\n\nThe decision of abandoning old versions of python was a bit difficult to take, but I think supporting python 3 is more important in the long run.\n. It's weird that it's working for a lot of people and not for you... A few questions before we try anything else:\n\nAre you 100% sure the problem comes from autojump? What else did you install/change before the problem appeared?\n\nDo you have any weird things in your vim configuration?\n\nDoes autojump work?\n. Can you give the location of the installed _j file, the _vim file, and the contents of your FPATH variable? This is a bit difficult for me to debug as I don't use zsh myself :)\n. Reopen if you still have problems.\n. Hi and thanks for the report. I have a question though:\n\nAren't these supposed to exist on any self-respecting distro? What happens if they do? I certainly don't want my users to see ugly error messages...\n. Good point. I'll integrate your patch as soon as I get a moment.\n\n> btw, it would be preferable if the default prefix was \"/usr/local\" instead of \"/usr\"\n\nI'm aware of the problem, but until someone supplies me with a good way of transitioning existing users who upgrade with ./install.sh seamlessly, it will stay as it is :-/\n. Done!\n. Any idea on how to implement this? Something that would work automatically with git would be pretty nice.\n. This is solved now (see pull request 73)\n. That's not how autojump works. It doesn't add weight when you use cd, but every time the prompt is displayed, so basically every time you type a command.\n\nLet me know if the problem persists.\n. I understand your problem better now, and I think it's an interesting problem, because I had never had that case before.\n\nCould you please send me the output of \"df -h -T\", \"pwd\" and \"pwd -P\" when in the ~/www directory?\n. You may well have found a bug in bash :) From the bash documentation:\n\n[joel@mouton ~]$ help pwd\npwd: pwd [-LP]\n    Print the name of the current working directory.\n\n```\nOptions:\n  -L    print the value of $PWD if it names the current working\n    directory\n  -P    print the physical directory, without any symbolic links\n```\n. Ah, maybe the issue is specific to zsh then. I'll try to investigate a bit if I get the time.\n. I've tried to reproduce your problem, but I couldn't reproduce it, neither with bash nor with zsh...\n. I tried with a different computer, and I still can't reproduce your problem. Please re-open if the problem persists.\n. Hi jostein,\n\nDo you have the latest version? I used to have a similar problem, but I thought I have fixed it in a recent commit.\n. Hi!\n\nI'm sorry this is still an issue for you. I'll try to investigate, but it will be a bit difficult since I haven't had the problem myself for a while.\n\nIn the meantime, could you send me all the information that seems relevant to you? Examples: content of the $PROMPT_COMMAND variable, permissions and ownership on the folder and all the files in ~/.local/share/autojump, content of autojump_errors, shell you're using, ...\n. Some more questions: do you often work as root? What do you use? su? sudo? Do you remember what you were doing (especially as root) when the problem appeared?\n. Thanks a lot for your help!\n. Great news: thanks to your explanations, I've finally been able to reproduce the problem. I'll try to work on a fix this week end.\n. I've just pushed a fix for this problem, can you tell me if you still have the problem with \"su\"?\n. Huh, weird, I don't have the same problem.\n\nDid you unset the PROMPT_COMMAND (or reboot) since upgrading?\n. Great to know it works for you!\n\nJust note that you shouldn't need to unset the prompt command in your bashrc, it should only be needed once when upgrading.\n. Thanks for reporting! I guess what happened is that homebrew has an older version than you initially had. I try to preserve backwards compatibility, but not forward compatibility. You did the right thing by removing the autojump_py file.\n. Hi,\n\nI'm sorry but I really don't want to go down this route. I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of Unix: do one thing, and do it well. Autojump is a tool for jumping between directories, and that's it, I don't want to re-implement a whole shell :)\n\nThe good news is, it should be very easy to write a \"jl\" function which does exactly what you want :)\n. Yes, that's how it's supposed to work. The idea is that no matter how many symlinks you have pointing to the same directory, they will be counted together. You could then use\n\n```\nj S\n```\n\nfor example to go in the target directory. In any case, if you really want to change this behavior, replace \"pwd -P\" in autojump.{bash,zsh} by simply \"pwd\". It should do what you want.\n. thelastnode is absolutely right. Be careful not to use it with dangerous commands though... I would definitely not recommend\n\n```\nrm -rf $(autojump abc)\n```\n\n:-)\n. Thanks!\n. Of course! Thanks!\n. Hi,\n\nI just saw your commit and I find it interesting. The fact that it calls autojump -a every time you enter a command is in fact something people commonly don't like about autojump.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure that it will work well enough with this implementation, because there will be a lot less data to learn from.\n\nI suggest that you use your implementation for a while and contact me again in one or two months if you like it. Would that be acceptable for you?\n. I understand your reflexion perfectly :) I prefer to forget about autojump completly, which is why I like hooking it on the prompt command.\n\nI don't like the idea of the \"purge\" option because one of the good things about autojump is that it remembers very old directories. There already is a feature that deletes keys if the database becomes really too big.\n\nI think I'll merge the \"remove\" option, because this is really something autojump has been missing for a while.\n\nAnyways, thanks for your patches, it's great to have other people poking at the code from time to time.\n. Closing.\n. It's probably because your .bashrc doesn't source /etc/profile.\n\nThe installer tries its best to work on all platforms, but it's hard to handle every case right. That said, I'd be happy if you can provide a patch for your case :)\n. The current version of autojump is supposed to be compatible with python3, precisely for Arch Linux.\n\nWhich version are you using? Can you be more specific?\n. What are you talking about? If you install the package \"python\" (which is in fact python3), you get the following files:\n\npython /usr/\npython /usr/bin/\npython /usr/bin/idle\npython /usr/bin/idle3\npython /usr/bin/pydoc\npython /usr/bin/pydoc3\npython /usr/bin/python\n...\n\nAnd there you have it, \"python\" in the standard path. Now if you install autojump with pacman, it is patched to depend on python2, so there is no problem either.\n. Not a real issue, closing.\n. What version are you using? The latest release is supposed to fix this.\n\nUnfortunately a simple test like you propose doesn't cover all use cases, but this commit: ( https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/commit/c877a51ad6b2d53ad20c7822f1d39312d3ce88a2 ) is supposed to fix them all.\n. Interesting, thanks for the info. I'll take a look when I have a moment.\n. I can't reproduce :-/ I've tried to \"sudo bash\" on two different distros with no problems. What distro are you using? Any specific custom environment?\n. Both of them, I think, I don't remember very well. The issue is tricky because there are many ways to gain root permissions: su, su -, sudo su, sudo bash, ...\n\nCould you please post the output of the \"env\" command before and after you sudo bash?\n. No answer --> closing. Will reopen if I get more info.\n. Good point. Fixed!\n. What python version are you using?\n. Too old :) Is it possible for you to upgrade? If not, I can try to find a solution, but it's pretty difficult to support old 2.x versions and 3.x at the same time!\n. Ok, closing.\n. I'm working on a better installer; but in the meantime, there is nothing stopping you from installing it yourself without root. I can help if you're stuck.\n. Thanks for your report.\n. I'll work with wting to merge his changes into the main tree.\n. Good point! I've pushed two commits that should solve your problem. Can you confirm that they work?\n. No answer, I'm assuming this is solved.\n. You need 2.6 at the moment, but the good news is, if you download autojum version 12, it should work out fine with python 2.5.\n\nI should probably write that information down somewhere, thanks for the reminder :)\n. Hi and thanks for the report! Are you using the latest git version or a previous release? I've had the same problem in the past, but I thought it was fixed now.\n\nAlso, do you have an idea of the command that caused the problem? What distro are you using?\n. I've just pushed a tentative fix. I can't test it because sudo is properly better configured under Arch, so I can't reproduce the problem. However I believe this patch should fix the problem. Can you confirm?\n. Great! I'll close the issue for now; don't hesitate to re-open if needed.\n\nI'll probably wait a week or so to make sure everything is ok, then I'll make a new release.\n. Good idea, but could you remove the corresponding python code? It won't be needed anymore if we implement this change. \n. I understand your rationale, but something that's even worse in my mind is duplicated code.\n\nDoes this optimization really make things faster? Otherwise maybe it's best not to do it at all.\n. No input --> closing.\n. I works for me. Are you still having this problem?\n. Try it :)\n\nIf you want to write documentation for it, I'll gladly integrate it; but I won't put any effort into the applet myself as I don't use it (it's a contribution).\n. Normally it opens a task bar icon that you can use by right clicking, it's really straightforward! Did you see the icon?\n. Mmm, it seems jumpapplet still uses the old database. I'll try to fix it when I get a few minutes :)\n. This is done on purpose, but I understand it doesn't necessarily match the workflow of everyone. Fortunately, it's quite simple to patch it to suit your needs. In autojump.bash, replace this line:\n\nAUTOJUMP='{ [[ \"$AUTOJUMP_HOME\" == \"$HOME\" ]] && (autojump -a \"$(pwd -P)\"&)>/dev/null 2>>${AUTOJUMP_DATA_DIR}/autojump_errors;} 2>/dev/null'\n\nwith\n\nAUTOJUMP='{ [[ \"$AUTOJUMP_HOME\" == \"$HOME\" ]] && (autojump -a \"$(pwd)\"&)>/dev/null 2>>${AUTOJUMP_DATA_DIR}/autojump_errors;} 2>/dev/null'\n\nYou could also call autojump twice if you want to add both paths.\n. Could you tell me what distro you're using? Did you install autojump with the installer, or with the distro's packages?\n\nI'm glad you were able to solve the problem, but if I can do anything to avoid other people running into the problem, I'd be glad as well!\n. Ok, let's forget about this for now :) Don't hesitate to re-open if you find some additional info.\n. Hi wting,\n\nThis is what I used to do in the beginning, but I've since then decided against it, as it goes against the Unix philosophy of doing one thing well, and only one thing. In my mind the important point is that it is easy to change if you want to, which is what you just did :)\n. Thanks for the fix!\n. Hi,\n\nThanks for your patch. I have already merged the grep fix.\n\nI don't think I want to merge the /usr/local fix, for various reasons:\n\n1) the prefix should be customizable (easy to fix)\n2) It might conflict with versions installed by package managers (most users now)\n3) It's just not worth the hassle.\n\nI hope you won't take it personally. I really appreciate people sending me patches, but I think this issue is too tiny to justify the effort.\n. Great! Thanks for looking into it.\n. I understand your need. However, I'm not convinced about this change for most people, because if there is a problem, I'd rather see it fail with an error message than silently.\n\nIf other people have this problem, I'll point them to your branch.\n. @wting: are you still willing to take care of the install scripts? If so, I'm ready to merge :)\n. Hi wting,\n\nI haven't had the time to review your contribution, but I have a proposal for you: would you be willing to maintain the install script for autojump? That would mean that I would (almost) blindly merge your commits on the install scripts. In counterpart, you would try to support the scripts and fix related issues.\n\nOf course there is really no pressure to accept, but since you seem interested in autojump and since I have less and less time to devote to it, I think it could be beneficial for everybody. Any thoughts?\n. jumpstat is a bash alias for \"autojump --stat\". So you can type autojump --stat.\n\nOf course, further integration would be nice, but I don't use mc, so I won't do it :)\n. Hi and thanks for the patch. I haven't looked at the code yet, but here are my first feelings:\n\nI have mixed feelings on the idea of approximate matching. I find autojump already dangerous enough (you get used to a sequence making you jump somewhere, and if it changes somehow, you can end up doing stuff in the wrong place). Isn't approximate matching going to increase this?\n\nAlso, I don't really understand the need. I usually use autojump with two or three letter patterns, so I rarely have typos. Is it a real problem for you? How do you use autojump?\n\nIn any case, I find the performance improvements and the profiling very interesting. I'll try to inspect them and merge them ASAP.\n. Hi int3,\n\nsorry for the delay in answering, I'm pretty busy and don't have a lot of time to spend on autojump! But I'm still interested in your contribution.\n\nI suppose you've been using your version for a while now, so I'd be interested in hearing your feedback. Does approximate matching improve your experience? Did you implement the \"bold or different color\" idea?\n. Sure, I just haven't taken the time to try it yet. Have you? I'd be interested in feedback from people actually using this.\n. Can someone please create a fork and merge this for everyone to try? That way we can learn from it, and possibly improve it, before we possibly decide to integrate it into the main autojump tree.\n. @shelhamer : great! Don't forget to keep me updates.\n\n@arronmabrey : Would you be willing to remake autojump's presentation video (the youtube video linked on the top of the wiki page). I'm not a native english speaker and I suck at making videos, so a new one would be great.\n. Thanks for the fix! I knew this would turn out to be a problem, but I somehow _had_ to use the latest version of the protocol :)\n. Could you try the following and report back?\n\n```\nmv ~/.local/share/autojump ~/.local/share/autojump.old\n```\n. I'm glad :)\n. This is a frequently asked question. The problem is that both ways to do it are correct.\n\nChanging it is a simple removing the '-P' in the PROMPT_COMMAND. I might add an example in the source to make it easier in the future.\n. Thanks for the fix, and sorry for the late answer!\n. Hi, and sorry for the late answer!\n\nAbout the workaround: unsetting the prompt command will surely work, but autojump needs it in order to record paths. So it won't work properly if you do that.\n\nAbout the problem itself: are you sure the \"update_terminal_cwd\" isn't the cause of the problem? What happens if you remove it?\n\nNot having a mac at hand to test makes it hard to diagnose the problem, but if you can narrow it down a bit, I'm sure we can solve this :)\n. @pcarrier: thanks for the help!\n\nNow the question is, what is this \"update_terminal_cwd\", and why does it end the prompt command with \";\". Do you need it?\n. I think gnome3 uses a different protocol for displaying applets. I don't know about lxde. So the part that displays the icon would need to be rewritten. If anyone wants to work on this, I can try to merge it later.\n. Normally paths that don't exist anymore are not used in the ranking, so autojump should still work properly. They are still kept in the database in case they were on a removable drive, so that you will be able to use autojump with removable drives.\n\nIs there any specific reason you want to remove these paths from the database?\n. I think you have a good point. I see two options here: either add an option to autojump to remove paths, which is easy but not very flexible; or switch to a text format for the autojump file. What do you think?\n. I've implemented a new text format in a new branch (text_format). I haven't written the migration code yet, but you can already try it, it will simply create a new database file.\n\nComments welcome!\n. The code is now ready in the \"text_format\" branch, can you test it and tell me what you think?\n. I've merged the code into master. Been using it for a few days, and it works great. Please re-open if there is a problem.\n. Hi Tanguy,\n\nI haven't checked your code yet, but you can find the explanation why XDG is commented out in the git history: the problem is that in the distributions that I have checked, the XDG env variables are not updated correctly when the user uses sudo or su. Thus his database is updated as root, then the autojump file belongs to root and the user is locked with permission problems.\n\nI'm all for implementing and following the standard, so if you can find a way of implementing this that is compatible with the use of su and sudo, I will merge it.\n\nAny comments?\n. > I suggest that we simply follow the specification but adding a security check: if $XDG_DATA_HOME does not belong to the current user, simply disable autojump.\n\nCan you add this check? I will gladly merge your contribution.\n. I have merged your branch. Does it seem correct to you?\n. In this case, if it's OK with you, I'll close this issue and issue a new release. Thanks for your contribution!\n. I have just merged the fix by shelhamer, can you confirm that it solves the issue?\n. I'll do it as soon as I get a moment. Sorry for the delay.\n. OK, I just tagged a new release. Can we consider this to be fixed?\n. I've re-uploaded the file, to no avail. I've contacted github about this.\n. Great then! Thanks to everyone for reporting and helping to fix this issue.\n. I'm pretty sure your brew (or whatever it's called, I don't use a mac) isn't up to date. Version 17 has been released a while ago now.\n. Apparently they decided to remove autojump from homebrew: https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/issues/9470\n\nI don't really understand why.\n. I think copying the files around _is_ the good thing to do. It's what all the linux distros do, and it allows to cope with the diversity of systems. The autojump installer is just there to help people who don't have access to a packaging system. To be frank, it is a pain to maintain it.\n. Sorry about this. The correct behavior would be to hide the file as it is only useful when debugging. I'll try to fix that ASAP.\n. This should be solved now. Can you test with the latest git head?\n. OK, great, closing. Don't hesitate to reopen if the issue reappears.\n. Thanks for the fix!\n. I can confirm this is not normal at all :)\n\nCan you try sourcing /etc/profile.d/autojump.bash (assuming you're using bash) directly in your bashrc? Then j and jumpstat should be defined (they're bash aliases), and the PROMPT_COMMAND environment variable should contain autojump related stuff.\n. I'd be interested if another ubuntu user can comment on this?\n. @cbrunos: would you mind pasting the output of \n\ndpkg -L autojump\n. I've asked the debian maintainer about this problem, and you need to source /usr/share/autojump.bash (instead of /etc/profile.d/autojump.bash) in your bashrc, as described in the documentation of the package.\n. Thanks!\n. Could you try again with the latest git version?\n. No problem, thanks for reporting!\n. Salut David,\n\nThat sounds a lot like a corrupted pickle file, or maybe could be caused by going back and forth between python2 and python3. In any case, an easy workaround is to scratch everything in your ~/.local/share/autojump directory (or alternatively remove .autojump\\* in your home directory if you don't have a .local/share directory). I think it should work.\n\nBefore you scratch them, could you please send me the incriminated files for inspection?\n. I'm glad it works! Just send me the original autojump_py file if you still have it, or the autojump_py.bak file.\n. Can you try the latest git version? I've just (as a pure coincidence) pushed a commit related to this issue, maybe it solves your problem?\n. Works for me. Please re-open if you're still experiencing this problem.\n. Hi and thanks for your patch!\n\nBefore I merge it, I have a few comments/questions:\n- it seems that git rev-parse always returns the commit ID. While this is correct, outputting \"version 17\" would be nicer for the user than outputting \"version e1ee1724379a0ea9bdaba24838a2e3f0bd5d8a59\". Any comments?\n- It would be nice to add this to make_release.sh, which is the script I use to create releases. Of course if you don't want to do it yourself, I can do it :)\n- Minor remark: you can use sed -i instead of copying and renaming the file.\n. Sorry but I'm not merging this. I don't want to use a makefile, and I'm not merging a patch that seems to change every line from autojump. Please go back to your previous version.\n. Hi xiaonaitong,\n\nThanks for this very nice set of patches. I have just a few questions/remarks:\n- Why did you replace os.rename with shutil.copy? I don't think we want to keep the temporary files.\n- Could you add a comment before the line that checks for nt, and explain why you check for it?\n- I'm unsure about the completion patch. Are you _certain_ that it handle files with spaces correctly?\n- Let's get rid of sudo altogether in the install scripts. The user that needs it can simply run \"sudo ./install.sh\".\n. I'll try to have a look ASAP. I don't care at all about the commit history, as long as I can get a diff I'm OK.\n. @orefalo : before I merge this, can you test it also works for you?\n. @orefalo: do you still plan to test?\n. @orefalo: I've used msysgit and it would be great if autojump worked in this contest. However if you don't have time to test it now, maybe I'll merge this pull request anyway and we can work on supporting mysgit later.\n. BTW I think xiaonaitong is right, msysgit has a full-fledged bash, so adding the normal python version and adding it to the path in .bashrc should do the trick. \n. Thanks for testing! I've merged it, I hope it works well!\n. Thanks for your patch!\n. Any advice on how this library should be named and where it should be placed?\n. Thinking a bit more about this issue, can't you consider autojump as a stand-alone executable file **and** a library, possibly symlinking it to the place where libraries should be? I really want to keep autojump standalone.\n. Great! Thanks for trying.\n. I'm assuming this issue is closed, don't hesitate to re-open if needed.\n. (sorry for not answering earlier. I am very interested in your patch, but I'm trying to fix other issues first and I don't have a lot of time to dedicate to autojump).\n. The problem I see with your patch is that the user is never going to find $prefix/etc/autojump/autojump.bash . I think it would be better to copy those two files in $prefix/bin along with autojump and jumpapplet. What do you think?\n. I've merged your pull request manually, thanks!\n\nHowever I think it would be better to have the same options for zsh and bash. Wting has contributed a --local option for zsh, I think it would be nice to have for bash. Something to improve in the future, I guess :)\n. Hi,\n\nthis looks a lot like this closed issue:\n\nhttps://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/issues/62\n\nDoes the info in this thread help you?\n\nIn any case, in the future, could you include more information and context when reporting issues?\n. I'm glad you solved it.\n. Could you tell me what version of bash you have? (bash --version)\n. Whoops :) Thanks for tracking this down yourself, I was getting a bit nervous :)\n. Hi Sergio,\n\nyou're absolutely right, this should be documented somewhere. For python 2.4/2.5, try release #12. Afterwards I started supporting python3, and that required dropping support for 2.4 and 2.5.\n\nIf you add this to the wiki and the readme (submit a pull request!), I'd be very grateful.\n. Great! Thanks for testing! I look forward to merging your pull request :)\n. I'm with sergio on this one, older releases of autojump are useful for people stuck on old systems. It would be nice to add a message to the installer pointing these people to release #12.\n\nWe'll probably do the same when abandoning python 2.x, which I want to do pretty soon given that even debian stable ships python3.x.\n. Did you update to the latest version, released yesterday? There were some problems with Lion (https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/issues/58), but I thought they were fixed.\n\nIf that doesn't solve your problem, could you send me the value of your $PROMPT_COMMAND environment variable? Also check that you ~/.bashrc adequatly sources the autojump files.\n. Mmm, this isn't right then. The value of your $PROMPT_COMMAND environment variable will probably give us a clue.\n. Great! Thanks for the feedback!\n. Thanks for your contribution!\n. Are you still having issues with autojump? For the record, I didn't close this issue, you did. I can't answer you right now because I'm away for the rest of the week, but I'll try to help you next week if you still request it.\n. I'm all for this, but why did you remove the file \"_j\", which as far as I remember, is used for zsh completion?\n. This pull request doesn't apply cleanly anymore. I guess I must have merged them in the wrong order. However I think most changes are already accounted for in my master branch (from your other pull requests). Am I correct? Can I close this?\n. Can you report this bug to the homebrew packagers instead? I don't think there is anything I can do about it myself.\n. (don't hesitate to re-open if there is indeed something I should do)\n. So do you have the problem when installing with the installer? If not, can we close the issue for good?\n. Ever wondered why autojump is called that way and not \"j\"? Try typing `autojump work` instead of `j p` :)\n\n`j` is just a shell function that cds to the path autojump printed.\n. Thanks!\n. Mmm, that's pretty stupid, I wasn't aware of that. Re-opened.\n. Bonjour Tanguy,\n\nThere are two ways to achieve this currently:\n1. Keep pressing on the \"enter\" key for a few seconds.\n2. Manually edit the autojump.txt file (usually in ~/.local/share)\n\nDoes this meet your needs? If not, I'd be curious about what you would like exactly and how you would implement it. Maybe a simple bit of documentation is the solution?\n. This is an interesting issue... Autojump uses sys.getfilesystemencoding() (http://docs.python.org/library/sys.html#sys.getdefaultencoding) to figure out the encoding of the filesystem. However, this function doesn't take an argument, so it's bound to fail if different filesystems have different encodings.\n\nDoes anyone know what the right thing to do would be? Is this a bug in the python standard library? How are you supposed to find out the encoding of a filesystem on the various Unixes?\n. Hi Thibault,\n\nIt should be solved now. Can you check?\n. Ooh, I like that! I've hated this redundency for a loooong time, but I never got around to doing it.\n. Thanks again! I've merged everything, but I haven't taken the time to \nlook at it yet. I'll try to test ASAP.\n\nabout the path for _j, you could possibly (I don't know if this is a \ngood idea!) launch zsh just to retrieve the value of the variable? ie, \nfrom bash, something like:\n\nfpath= $(zsh -c \"echo '${fpath}'\")\n\nWould that by any chance work?\n\nOn 02/08/2012 09:11 PM, William Ting wrote:\n\n> The only major change is that I've hardcoded the copy of `_j` in global zsh installations to the default function directory `/usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/`.

Hello Khalid,\n\nThanks for your contribution. I'm afraid I'm not going to be able to pull this pull request as is:\n- Adding a new, one-letter alias for all my users doesn't seem like a great idea. I must say though , your implementation is pretty elegant, and it would be nice to have as an option.\n- About the second change, I'm thinking about removing -P by default. One problem that arises if you remove -P is that the same directory will be counted in different entries, so I'm not entirely sure about this. Any comments for other people?\n. Thanks for contributing!\n. Hi Fabio,\n\nIf you find shift so expensive, why do you use capitals in your app's name (honnest question!)?\n\nI understand why you'd want this change, but unless there is overwhelming support for this, I'd rather leave it the way it is, because I think it makes sense to distinguish capitals from lowercase letters if the filesystem does.\n\nNote that as a work around, you can use any part of the name of the directory as a dirspec, so `j pp` would probably work. You can also change the behavior of autojump by patching it, it should be pretty straight forward (and I can help you if you're stuck).\n. @wting : I'll love your input on that question!\n. @wting any idea where those binary modules come from? Is this something I'm not aware of?\n. No worries, I just find it very weird to see .so files in the autojump user directory. Have a great conference!\n. We discussed a similar issue a while ago:\n\nhttps://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/issues/90\n\nI'm not fundamentally against adding an option, but keep in mind that it's already not that hard to do it. One advantage of the option would be better visibility for users who are not familiar with the way autojump works.\n. About the man page: I've written it directly using `groff` or whatever that's called, but it would probably be better to generate it directly from the README using pandoc for example. Maybe something similar could be done for the main wiki page as well.\n. What should it do? Should it display the help message instead?\n\nThat makes me think, should we use argparse instead of getopt? It seems like the current accepted way of parsing command lines argument. If we're going to change that piece of code, we could take the opportunity to do that change as well.\n. `j` is a bash alias, `autojump` is the actual command. `autojump --help` will work as expected.\n\nMaybe a smarter alias could detect an error code returned by autojump, for example?\n. I can't reproduce on my work machine with autojump on commit 448696ef9b1a3b799e6ce3b0397d7bcf98590700, which was a few weeks ago. Could this be due to your fix on issue #114?\n. We already have a recommended version for very old versions of python (v12). I think we can safely say that from v20 onwards you need at least python2.7 to run autojump.\n. BTW, IIRC you had a warning about this in the install script, maybe you should add a warning about argparse?\n. Hi jkuan,\n\nFor some reason github says your pull request \"cannot be automatically merged.\". Can you rebase it on the latest commit?\n. This was done by the debian package maintainer a while ago, after discussing the issue with me.\n\nI don't understand the problem. Isn't autojump supposed to work with python 3.x?\n. Reposting my email:\n\n## \n\nI must say I don't understand the problem you're describing. Python 2\nand 3 can perfectly live together on the same system. On Debian,\n/usr/bin/python is python2 and will stay that way, at least that's what\nTanguy told me. So I told him that in the long run we would drop 2.x\ncompatibility, and that since autojump is compatible with 3.x today, he\ncould start using it with 3.x on Debian right away.\n\nIf autojump doesn't work with 3.x, I think it's a bug we need to fix;\nbut I don't understand why the choice to use 3.x on Debian (for autojump\nonly!) is supposed to be a problem.\n. Use \"autojump\" instead of \"j\": `mv file $(autojump backup)`.\n\nKeep in mind that what you're doing is pretty dangerous :)\n. Are you trying to use the autojump command directly, as in `autojump directory`? If yes, that explains it. If you want to jump you need to use the \"j\" atlas, ie. `j directory`.\n. I suffer from this problem as well. I never thought of those damned **init**.py files when I devised the autojump completion mechanism a long time ago. Plus, at that time only \"j\" had completion so there was no problem!\n\nI still think the completion mechanism is useful for vim and friends, so maybe you're right and we should make these underscores configurable. I'd like to hear wting's take on the problem as well.\n. I don't think we should go down bloat alley, but I really like the completion functionality for other commands. The rationale for it is that in some cases, `cd` is not enough. The `cp` command, for instance, takes 2 arguments, which can be in very different directories. Vim works the same when you want to open multiple unrelated files.\n\nCould we maybe implement it differently? I don't like the idea of a configuration file with too many settings, I think we should strive as much as we can to find a set of reasonable settings that can work for everybody.\n. I do have in mind a complete readline replacement/enhancement that would generalize the idea behind autojump to everything you perform in the shell. But it's a completely different project :-D\n. I fully agree with your rationale, this is an issue that has been bugging me for a while. However the problem is that there is no good way to decide that two directories have \"similar scores\". Any ideas on how to implement this in a way that is both deterministic and simple to understand and predict by the user?\n. Autojump has had that feature for ages, just try it :) Except that the patterns are no longer regexes, if I recall correctly.\n. Here is a simpler implementation: \n\n```\nfunction jo { nautilus $(autojump $1); }\n```\n\nOr even, \"j whatever; nautilus .\" is what I used to do.\n\nMaybe a suggestion in the readme would be enough? I'm not sure how many commands we can add before user start complaining about namespace pollution. \n. function jo { xdg-open $(autojump $@); } is actually pretty cool, I think it's going to stay for a while in my .bashrc :)\n. Doesn't that require making j stateful?\n. It's been a while since I last worked on autojump, but isn't this already the case? The PROMPT_COMMAND is executed every time a prompt is displayed, which should happen only in interactive mode. If this is not the case in your system, than I would wager something is wrong with it.\n. It's working as designed. I agree it's not very intuitive.\n\nWhat you need to do is press tab another time. Then you will be presented with a list of options with numbers. Now type in the number you want, then <enter>, and that should make you jump where you want.\n. What does 'j wor' do? Does it jump anywhere?\n. Ooooh, I really like that idea! Thanks for the vim tip, too!\n. You probably didn't source the required file in your .bashrc. Read the comments for the package, I think they explain what you should do.\n. Isn't autojump supposed to be disabled in non-interactive shells? What's special about virtualenv?\n. Hi yaykyle,\n\nThe great news is, you don't need another flag, this is exactly what the \"autojump\" command does:\n\n```\n[joel@panda flickrapi]$ autojump foo\n/home/joel/workspace/LazyFooHaskell\n[joel@panda flickrapi]$\n```\n\nThe `j` shell function actually uses the autojump command behind the scenes to perform its work.\n. The red color is important because the destination directory is unpredictable. So it's important to draw the user's attention on where he ended up.\n\nThat said, maybe `j` could detect whether the output is a TTY.\n. Could'nt agree more. This has been ongoing since the very early days of autojump. I think #415 is the most promising here. Another idea could be to rename the autojump binary to something less tempting, since after all it's mostly an internal tool.\n. Thank you very much for the bug report! I don't know what caused the problem (it could be a ton of things), but since a few weeks, I've added code that keeps a backup version of the database, updated everyday. In the next few days I will add code to automatically recover from the backup in the case you report.\n. I just commited a fix, It should be fixed now. Can you test the new version for a few days and tell me if you encounter any problems?\n. Closing the issue. Don't hesitate to reopen if the issue is not solved for you :)\n. Oops, this sucks!\n\nThe difference between v7 and this commit is just a change in the README, so I doubt this update is the cause of your problem. Just to be sure, can you try logging in from a console? (Alt+Ctrl+2 for example, I hope ubuntu has these)\nSend me any error message you get.\n. It's probably not doing the PROMPT_COMMAND. Can you give me the output of the following command?\n\n```\necho $PROMPT_COMMAND\n```\n\nAlso, which shell are you using?\n. > I am using git-prompt (http://github.com/lvv/git-prompt/)\n> \n> I'm using bash\n> \n> echo $PROMPT_COMMAND\n> prompt_command_function\n\nIt seems git-prompt is not playing nicely, and overrides the prompt command. Autojump won't work if the prompt command is overwritten. Autojump on the other hand respects other tools in the prompt command and adds itself to the list without removing the other ones.\n\nLong story short: either reinstall autojump or submit a bug report to the git-prompt maintainer (or better, do both :))\n\nPS: please answer in the issue; i nearly missed your message.\n. Hi!\n\nIt's really OS X that's broken in this case, because in all the other distros the bash_profile already calls the bashrc. Hence adding it to the bash_profile with the installer would add it twice for all the other users...\n\nMaybe we should create an OS X-specific installer? If you think this is a good idea, can you fork the project, and add your fixed version of the installer? (install.macosx.sh ?)\n\nI'll then add it to my repo.\n. That seems to be a good idea as well.\n. I won't hesitate :)\n. echo is fine. Autojump doesn't work with sh anyways. Thanks for the patch!\n. I've added the shebang as well.\n. Could you elaborate? What do you mean by \"it doesn't work right\"? Does it spit out some error messages? If so, it could be useful to post them.\n. It looks like the alias ('j' is a bash alias) isn't being set properly.\n. Can you try sourcing .bashrc manually and see if it works better?\n\n```\nsource ~/.bashrc\n```\n\nAlso, not that it makes a difference, but j is actually a bash function, not an alias.\n. > Also joel I just read your article on java schools and as someone who took intro CS at Penn I feel a little cheated.\n\nI think you're mistaking me for someone else :) But hey I'm glad you finally got autojump to work.\n. Is this simply a matter of fixing the installer? If that's the case I think it's a trivial fix...\n\nI unfortunately don't have access to a mac, so I can't really do it myself, but if you submit a fix, I'll gladly integrate it.\n. OK, I agree, but how should I do it? is PREFIX an environment variable I should poll?\n. Would it work with a environment variable as well? It would be a lot simpler to implement than the command line parsing.\n. DataSurfer (or someone else) : would you be willing to write the homebrew formula if I implement the prefix in the installer?\n. > I find it perplexing that the getopts function in bash does not support GNU extension long flag names\n\nSame here :) Maybe we should just rewrite the installer in python?\n. > I'll volunteer to write the formula.\n\nGreat! Just give me a few days to find a good solution to the prefix problem.\n. Ok, I have pushed an implementation of --prefix for the bash installer. Let me know if it works for you!\n. Neat! I merged in your patch. Can I close the issue now?\n. Could you tell me what still needs to be done?\n. I just tried\n\n```\n./install.zsh --prefix /usr\n```\n\nand it seems to work on my machine? I don't think we should use getopts, I tried using it in the past and didn't like it much.\n. I'll just assume this works now, closing.\n. Ah yes, I know what the problem is, your python version is too old for generator expression. Is it possible for you to upgrade to a more recent python version. If it's not, I can try to make it compatible, but I don't know if it is possible easily. No guarantees :)\n. This is because + and \\* are special characters in regular expressions. I could use a simple search instead, but people who use regexps might not be happy about it...\n\nI need some time to think this through. Thanks for the report!\n. Should be fixed now. Please reopen if it still doesn't work.\n. Hi,\n\nI will look into it as soon as I get a chance.\n\njoel\n. Bonjour Olivier,\n\nIt should be fixed now. Can you confirm that it works?\n. > I keep making autojump huge publicity (b\u00e9po, zeitgeist\u2026).\n\nGreat! That means a lot to me :)\n. Hi!\n\nI understand your 'problem' perfectly, but I think things are working fine! Actually, when I first started autojump, it worked the way you describe; but I found out that the amount of work you perform in a directory is what counts, not the number of times you \"cd\" to it.\n\nIn any case, this would be pretty easy for you to change, but I'd suggest using the standard autojump for a week or two before making the change. You might change your mind :)\n. Hi,\n\nCould you give me the output of the the \"alias\" and the \"jumpstat\" command, and tell me what directory you are trying to complete? (give me the state of the command line when you press tab, as well as the directory you think it should complete).\n. Hi Jake,\n\nI think everything is actually working properly! Autojump isn't a replacement for cd, but a complement. You should wait a bit more for the database to fill itself, and then you'll be able to use autojump to move back and forth between your most used directories, using autocompletion if you want. For now since you have only one directory in the database, it's not very useful yet :)\n\nLet me know if you need more help!\n\njoel\n. Indeed, it actually learns every time you type a command, not only when you change directories. You can check the current state of the database with \"jumpstat\".\n. Good point :) I guess I'll have to think of a new tagline...\n. I agree that would be nice, but I don't think all major distros respect that specification (yet). I just tested on my opensuse system, and these environment variables aren't enabled. I also highly doubt that cygwin and mac set them correctly (these are a big part of my users).\n\nSo in conclusion: why not in a few years, but I think this is a bit premature for now.\n. Not a bad idea :) I'll have to think of a way to seamlessly migrate people, though.\n. I tried to implement your idea; can you comment on it? Note that for simplicity I put everything in the XDG_DATA_HOME directory.\n. Great! Thanks for the input!\n. What prevents you from putting autojump on the remote hosts? At least, that's how I do it. (note that you don't have to be root to install autojump, you simply have to install it manually in that case).\n. Why would you need to convince other people to use it? (note that I don't doubt you have a good reason for this, I just want to make sure I understand your use case; it's people like you who have helped me make autojump as good as it is now :) )\n. Another way you could do this is by sharing the autojump data files between the different machines: recent autojump versions ignore directories that don't exist.\n. > I want to restrict it to my main computer because I work on customers' productions systems, and I don't want to install (please, bare with the term) \"exotic\" software on it yet.\n\nHeck, I wouldn't do it either! :-D\n\nTo come back to your original question, I really don't have a clue as to how you would implement that without installing software on the remote machine. The whole point of ssh is that the commands you send are executed remotely and not locally! If you think of a solution, I'd be glad to hear it, though :)\n. I'd love to help you out, but I use bash myself and zsh completion works perfectly on all of my machines...\n\nIs autojump the only application that has a problem? What distro are you using? Can you try using autojump on a fresh user account to see if one of your customizations could be the problem?\n. Could you provide a patch for the zsh installer? I could probably do it, but since I don't use zsh, there's a significant probability that I would mess up :)\n\nAbout the bash installer, I guess the problem is in a patch from another guy I merged in recently. But I can't reproduce the problem on my computer...\n. Ok, I think I've solved the problem. What do you think of the solution?\n\nhttp://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/commit/512db419e1470af77c544ecbedad5dae9221ddda\n. Ok, I'm considering the issue to be closed. Don't hesitate to reopen if that is not the case!\n. Hi, thanks for the report! That's a very weird error... Could you send me the contents of your ~/.local/share/autojump directory (pm me for email) as well as the output of \"python -v\"?\n\nThanks!\n. Did you update autojump recently? If not, please do so, and tell me if the problem persists.\n. I'm glad it works for you now, although I suspect there is a robustness issue to be solved somewhere...\n. Thanks for the report! I can't reproduce on my computer, so could you send me the contents of your ~/.local/share/autojump/ directory? Could you also send me the output of \"autojump --completion main\"?\nAlso, are you sure both directories exist (could they be on a removable drive?) at the moment you try to use the completion?\n. Ok, don't hesitate to reopen if the problem reappears!\n. Hi,\n\nThat seems like a good idea, but I'm afraid it could mess things up for the (many) people who have already installed to /usr. Any idea on how to make the transition smooth?\n. I agree this is the way it should be, but I won't fix it, because,\n\n1) it will cause problems with existing installs,\nand 2) it's not worth it.\n. I've added a few files. Let me know if more are missing.\n. Thanks, good job, but i'll stick with python2 for a while. The reason is, many of my users don't have python3 on their systems. When python3 becomes more widely distributed, I'll make the switch. As you said, it's not that big a deal.\n. Actually, the current version of autojump is compatible with both versions of python: it should support everything from 2.6 to 3.x.\n. I'm glad you found a version that works for you!\n\nThe decision of abandoning old versions of python was a bit difficult to take, but I think supporting python 3 is more important in the long run.\n. It's weird that it's working for a lot of people and not for you... A few questions before we try anything else:\n\nAre you 100% sure the problem comes from autojump? What else did you install/change before the problem appeared?\n\nDo you have any weird things in your vim configuration?\n\nDoes autojump work?\n. Can you give the location of the installed _j file, the _vim file, and the contents of your FPATH variable? This is a bit difficult for me to debug as I don't use zsh myself :)\n. Reopen if you still have problems.\n. Hi and thanks for the report. I have a question though:\n\nAren't these supposed to exist on any self-respecting distro? What happens if they do? I certainly don't want my users to see ugly error messages...\n. Good point. I'll integrate your patch as soon as I get a moment.\n\n> btw, it would be preferable if the default prefix was \"/usr/local\" instead of \"/usr\"\n\nI'm aware of the problem, but until someone supplies me with a good way of transitioning existing users who upgrade with ./install.sh seamlessly, it will stay as it is :-/\n. Done!\n. Any idea on how to implement this? Something that would work automatically with git would be pretty nice.\n. This is solved now (see pull request 73)\n. That's not how autojump works. It doesn't add weight when you use cd, but every time the prompt is displayed, so basically every time you type a command.\n\nLet me know if the problem persists.\n. I understand your problem better now, and I think it's an interesting problem, because I had never had that case before.\n\nCould you please send me the output of \"df -h -T\", \"pwd\" and \"pwd -P\" when in the ~/www directory?\n. You may well have found a bug in bash :) From the bash documentation:\n\n[joel@mouton ~]$ help pwd\npwd: pwd [-LP]\n    Print the name of the current working directory.\n\n```\nOptions:\n  -L    print the value of $PWD if it names the current working\n    directory\n  -P    print the physical directory, without any symbolic links\n```\n. Ah, maybe the issue is specific to zsh then. I'll try to investigate a bit if I get the time.\n. I've tried to reproduce your problem, but I couldn't reproduce it, neither with bash nor with zsh...\n. I tried with a different computer, and I still can't reproduce your problem. Please re-open if the problem persists.\n. Hi jostein,\n\nDo you have the latest version? I used to have a similar problem, but I thought I have fixed it in a recent commit.\n. Hi!\n\nI'm sorry this is still an issue for you. I'll try to investigate, but it will be a bit difficult since I haven't had the problem myself for a while.\n\nIn the meantime, could you send me all the information that seems relevant to you? Examples: content of the $PROMPT_COMMAND variable, permissions and ownership on the folder and all the files in ~/.local/share/autojump, content of autojump_errors, shell you're using, ...\n. Some more questions: do you often work as root? What do you use? su? sudo? Do you remember what you were doing (especially as root) when the problem appeared?\n. Thanks a lot for your help!\n. Great news: thanks to your explanations, I've finally been able to reproduce the problem. I'll try to work on a fix this week end.\n. I've just pushed a fix for this problem, can you tell me if you still have the problem with \"su\"?\n. Huh, weird, I don't have the same problem.\n\nDid you unset the PROMPT_COMMAND (or reboot) since upgrading?\n. Great to know it works for you!\n\nJust note that you shouldn't need to unset the prompt command in your bashrc, it should only be needed once when upgrading.\n. Thanks for reporting! I guess what happened is that homebrew has an older version than you initially had. I try to preserve backwards compatibility, but not forward compatibility. You did the right thing by removing the autojump_py file.\n. Hi,\n\nI'm sorry but I really don't want to go down this route. I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of Unix: do one thing, and do it well. Autojump is a tool for jumping between directories, and that's it, I don't want to re-implement a whole shell :)\n\nThe good news is, it should be very easy to write a \"jl\" function which does exactly what you want :)\n. Yes, that's how it's supposed to work. The idea is that no matter how many symlinks you have pointing to the same directory, they will be counted together. You could then use\n\n```\nj S\n```\n\nfor example to go in the target directory. In any case, if you really want to change this behavior, replace \"pwd -P\" in autojump.{bash,zsh} by simply \"pwd\". It should do what you want.\n. thelastnode is absolutely right. Be careful not to use it with dangerous commands though... I would definitely not recommend\n\n```\nrm -rf $(autojump abc)\n```\n\n:-)\n. Thanks!\n. Of course! Thanks!\n. Hi,\n\nI just saw your commit and I find it interesting. The fact that it calls autojump -a every time you enter a command is in fact something people commonly don't like about autojump.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure that it will work well enough with this implementation, because there will be a lot less data to learn from.\n\nI suggest that you use your implementation for a while and contact me again in one or two months if you like it. Would that be acceptable for you?\n. I understand your reflexion perfectly :) I prefer to forget about autojump completly, which is why I like hooking it on the prompt command.\n\nI don't like the idea of the \"purge\" option because one of the good things about autojump is that it remembers very old directories. There already is a feature that deletes keys if the database becomes really too big.\n\nI think I'll merge the \"remove\" option, because this is really something autojump has been missing for a while.\n\nAnyways, thanks for your patches, it's great to have other people poking at the code from time to time.\n. Closing.\n. It's probably because your .bashrc doesn't source /etc/profile.\n\nThe installer tries its best to work on all platforms, but it's hard to handle every case right. That said, I'd be happy if you can provide a patch for your case :)\n. The current version of autojump is supposed to be compatible with python3, precisely for Arch Linux.\n\nWhich version are you using? Can you be more specific?\n. What are you talking about? If you install the package \"python\" (which is in fact python3), you get the following files:\n\npython /usr/\npython /usr/bin/\npython /usr/bin/idle\npython /usr/bin/idle3\npython /usr/bin/pydoc\npython /usr/bin/pydoc3\npython /usr/bin/python\n...\n\nAnd there you have it, \"python\" in the standard path. Now if you install autojump with pacman, it is patched to depend on python2, so there is no problem either.\n. Not a real issue, closing.\n. What version are you using? The latest release is supposed to fix this.\n\nUnfortunately a simple test like you propose doesn't cover all use cases, but this commit: ( https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/commit/c877a51ad6b2d53ad20c7822f1d39312d3ce88a2 ) is supposed to fix them all.\n. Interesting, thanks for the info. I'll take a look when I have a moment.\n. I can't reproduce :-/ I've tried to \"sudo bash\" on two different distros with no problems. What distro are you using? Any specific custom environment?\n. Both of them, I think, I don't remember very well. The issue is tricky because there are many ways to gain root permissions: su, su -, sudo su, sudo bash, ...\n\nCould you please post the output of the \"env\" command before and after you sudo bash?\n. No answer --> closing. Will reopen if I get more info.\n. Good point. Fixed!\n. What python version are you using?\n. Too old :) Is it possible for you to upgrade? If not, I can try to find a solution, but it's pretty difficult to support old 2.x versions and 3.x at the same time!\n. Ok, closing.\n. I'm working on a better installer; but in the meantime, there is nothing stopping you from installing it yourself without root. I can help if you're stuck.\n. Thanks for your report.\n. I'll work with wting to merge his changes into the main tree.\n. Good point! I've pushed two commits that should solve your problem. Can you confirm that they work?\n. No answer, I'm assuming this is solved.\n. You need 2.6 at the moment, but the good news is, if you download autojum version 12, it should work out fine with python 2.5.\n\nI should probably write that information down somewhere, thanks for the reminder :)\n. Hi and thanks for the report! Are you using the latest git version or a previous release? I've had the same problem in the past, but I thought it was fixed now.\n\nAlso, do you have an idea of the command that caused the problem? What distro are you using?\n. I've just pushed a tentative fix. I can't test it because sudo is properly better configured under Arch, so I can't reproduce the problem. However I believe this patch should fix the problem. Can you confirm?\n. Great! I'll close the issue for now; don't hesitate to re-open if needed.\n\nI'll probably wait a week or so to make sure everything is ok, then I'll make a new release.\n. Good idea, but could you remove the corresponding python code? It won't be needed anymore if we implement this change. \n. I understand your rationale, but something that's even worse in my mind is duplicated code.\n\nDoes this optimization really make things faster? Otherwise maybe it's best not to do it at all.\n. No input --> closing.\n. I works for me. Are you still having this problem?\n. Try it :)\n\nIf you want to write documentation for it, I'll gladly integrate it; but I won't put any effort into the applet myself as I don't use it (it's a contribution).\n. Normally it opens a task bar icon that you can use by right clicking, it's really straightforward! Did you see the icon?\n. Mmm, it seems jumpapplet still uses the old database. I'll try to fix it when I get a few minutes :)\n. This is done on purpose, but I understand it doesn't necessarily match the workflow of everyone. Fortunately, it's quite simple to patch it to suit your needs. In autojump.bash, replace this line:\n\nAUTOJUMP='{ [[ \"$AUTOJUMP_HOME\" == \"$HOME\" ]] && (autojump -a \"$(pwd -P)\"&)>/dev/null 2>>${AUTOJUMP_DATA_DIR}/autojump_errors;} 2>/dev/null'\n\nwith\n\nAUTOJUMP='{ [[ \"$AUTOJUMP_HOME\" == \"$HOME\" ]] && (autojump -a \"$(pwd)\"&)>/dev/null 2>>${AUTOJUMP_DATA_DIR}/autojump_errors;} 2>/dev/null'\n\nYou could also call autojump twice if you want to add both paths.\n. Could you tell me what distro you're using? Did you install autojump with the installer, or with the distro's packages?\n\nI'm glad you were able to solve the problem, but if I can do anything to avoid other people running into the problem, I'd be glad as well!\n. Ok, let's forget about this for now :) Don't hesitate to re-open if you find some additional info.\n. Hi wting,\n\nThis is what I used to do in the beginning, but I've since then decided against it, as it goes against the Unix philosophy of doing one thing well, and only one thing. In my mind the important point is that it is easy to change if you want to, which is what you just did :)\n. Thanks for the fix!\n. Hi,\n\nThanks for your patch. I have already merged the grep fix.\n\nI don't think I want to merge the /usr/local fix, for various reasons:\n\n1) the prefix should be customizable (easy to fix)\n2) It might conflict with versions installed by package managers (most users now)\n3) It's just not worth the hassle.\n\nI hope you won't take it personally. I really appreciate people sending me patches, but I think this issue is too tiny to justify the effort.\n. Great! Thanks for looking into it.\n. I understand your need. However, I'm not convinced about this change for most people, because if there is a problem, I'd rather see it fail with an error message than silently.\n\nIf other people have this problem, I'll point them to your branch.\n. @wting: are you still willing to take care of the install scripts? If so, I'm ready to merge :)\n. Hi wting,\n\nI haven't had the time to review your contribution, but I have a proposal for you: would you be willing to maintain the install script for autojump? That would mean that I would (almost) blindly merge your commits on the install scripts. In counterpart, you would try to support the scripts and fix related issues.\n\nOf course there is really no pressure to accept, but since you seem interested in autojump and since I have less and less time to devote to it, I think it could be beneficial for everybody. Any thoughts?\n. jumpstat is a bash alias for \"autojump --stat\". So you can type autojump --stat.\n\nOf course, further integration would be nice, but I don't use mc, so I won't do it :)\n. Hi and thanks for the patch. I haven't looked at the code yet, but here are my first feelings:\n\nI have mixed feelings on the idea of approximate matching. I find autojump already dangerous enough (you get used to a sequence making you jump somewhere, and if it changes somehow, you can end up doing stuff in the wrong place). Isn't approximate matching going to increase this?\n\nAlso, I don't really understand the need. I usually use autojump with two or three letter patterns, so I rarely have typos. Is it a real problem for you? How do you use autojump?\n\nIn any case, I find the performance improvements and the profiling very interesting. I'll try to inspect them and merge them ASAP.\n. Hi int3,\n\nsorry for the delay in answering, I'm pretty busy and don't have a lot of time to spend on autojump! But I'm still interested in your contribution.\n\nI suppose you've been using your version for a while now, so I'd be interested in hearing your feedback. Does approximate matching improve your experience? Did you implement the \"bold or different color\" idea?\n. Sure, I just haven't taken the time to try it yet. Have you? I'd be interested in feedback from people actually using this.\n. Can someone please create a fork and merge this for everyone to try? That way we can learn from it, and possibly improve it, before we possibly decide to integrate it into the main autojump tree.\n. @shelhamer : great! Don't forget to keep me updates.\n\n@arronmabrey : Would you be willing to remake autojump's presentation video (the youtube video linked on the top of the wiki page). I'm not a native english speaker and I suck at making videos, so a new one would be great.\n. Thanks for the fix! I knew this would turn out to be a problem, but I somehow _had_ to use the latest version of the protocol :)\n. Could you try the following and report back?\n\n```\nmv ~/.local/share/autojump ~/.local/share/autojump.old\n```\n. I'm glad :)\n. This is a frequently asked question. The problem is that both ways to do it are correct.\n\nChanging it is a simple removing the '-P' in the PROMPT_COMMAND. I might add an example in the source to make it easier in the future.\n. Thanks for the fix, and sorry for the late answer!\n. Hi, and sorry for the late answer!\n\nAbout the workaround: unsetting the prompt command will surely work, but autojump needs it in order to record paths. So it won't work properly if you do that.\n\nAbout the problem itself: are you sure the \"update_terminal_cwd\" isn't the cause of the problem? What happens if you remove it?\n\nNot having a mac at hand to test makes it hard to diagnose the problem, but if you can narrow it down a bit, I'm sure we can solve this :)\n. @pcarrier: thanks for the help!\n\nNow the question is, what is this \"update_terminal_cwd\", and why does it end the prompt command with \";\". Do you need it?\n. I think gnome3 uses a different protocol for displaying applets. I don't know about lxde. So the part that displays the icon would need to be rewritten. If anyone wants to work on this, I can try to merge it later.\n. Normally paths that don't exist anymore are not used in the ranking, so autojump should still work properly. They are still kept in the database in case they were on a removable drive, so that you will be able to use autojump with removable drives.\n\nIs there any specific reason you want to remove these paths from the database?\n. I think you have a good point. I see two options here: either add an option to autojump to remove paths, which is easy but not very flexible; or switch to a text format for the autojump file. What do you think?\n. I've implemented a new text format in a new branch (text_format). I haven't written the migration code yet, but you can already try it, it will simply create a new database file.\n\nComments welcome!\n. The code is now ready in the \"text_format\" branch, can you test it and tell me what you think?\n. I've merged the code into master. Been using it for a few days, and it works great. Please re-open if there is a problem.\n. Hi Tanguy,\n\nI haven't checked your code yet, but you can find the explanation why XDG is commented out in the git history: the problem is that in the distributions that I have checked, the XDG env variables are not updated correctly when the user uses sudo or su. Thus his database is updated as root, then the autojump file belongs to root and the user is locked with permission problems.\n\nI'm all for implementing and following the standard, so if you can find a way of implementing this that is compatible with the use of su and sudo, I will merge it.\n\nAny comments?\n. > I suggest that we simply follow the specification but adding a security check: if $XDG_DATA_HOME does not belong to the current user, simply disable autojump.\n\nCan you add this check? I will gladly merge your contribution.\n. I have merged your branch. Does it seem correct to you?\n. In this case, if it's OK with you, I'll close this issue and issue a new release. Thanks for your contribution!\n. I have just merged the fix by shelhamer, can you confirm that it solves the issue?\n. I'll do it as soon as I get a moment. Sorry for the delay.\n. OK, I just tagged a new release. Can we consider this to be fixed?\n. I've re-uploaded the file, to no avail. I've contacted github about this.\n. Great then! Thanks to everyone for reporting and helping to fix this issue.\n. I'm pretty sure your brew (or whatever it's called, I don't use a mac) isn't up to date. Version 17 has been released a while ago now.\n. Apparently they decided to remove autojump from homebrew: https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/issues/9470\n\nI don't really understand why.\n. I think copying the files around _is_ the good thing to do. It's what all the linux distros do, and it allows to cope with the diversity of systems. The autojump installer is just there to help people who don't have access to a packaging system. To be frank, it is a pain to maintain it.\n. Sorry about this. The correct behavior would be to hide the file as it is only useful when debugging. I'll try to fix that ASAP.\n. This should be solved now. Can you test with the latest git head?\n. OK, great, closing. Don't hesitate to reopen if the issue reappears.\n. Thanks for the fix!\n. I can confirm this is not normal at all :)\n\nCan you try sourcing /etc/profile.d/autojump.bash (assuming you're using bash) directly in your bashrc? Then j and jumpstat should be defined (they're bash aliases), and the PROMPT_COMMAND environment variable should contain autojump related stuff.\n. I'd be interested if another ubuntu user can comment on this?\n. @cbrunos: would you mind pasting the output of \n\ndpkg -L autojump\n. I've asked the debian maintainer about this problem, and you need to source /usr/share/autojump.bash (instead of /etc/profile.d/autojump.bash) in your bashrc, as described in the documentation of the package.\n. Thanks!\n. Could you try again with the latest git version?\n. No problem, thanks for reporting!\n. Salut David,\n\nThat sounds a lot like a corrupted pickle file, or maybe could be caused by going back and forth between python2 and python3. In any case, an easy workaround is to scratch everything in your ~/.local/share/autojump directory (or alternatively remove .autojump\\* in your home directory if you don't have a .local/share directory). I think it should work.\n\nBefore you scratch them, could you please send me the incriminated files for inspection?\n. I'm glad it works! Just send me the original autojump_py file if you still have it, or the autojump_py.bak file.\n. Can you try the latest git version? I've just (as a pure coincidence) pushed a commit related to this issue, maybe it solves your problem?\n. Works for me. Please re-open if you're still experiencing this problem.\n. Hi and thanks for your patch!\n\nBefore I merge it, I have a few comments/questions:\n- it seems that git rev-parse always returns the commit ID. While this is correct, outputting \"version 17\" would be nicer for the user than outputting \"version e1ee1724379a0ea9bdaba24838a2e3f0bd5d8a59\". Any comments?\n- It would be nice to add this to make_release.sh, which is the script I use to create releases. Of course if you don't want to do it yourself, I can do it :)\n- Minor remark: you can use sed -i instead of copying and renaming the file.\n. Sorry but I'm not merging this. I don't want to use a makefile, and I'm not merging a patch that seems to change every line from autojump. Please go back to your previous version.\n. Hi xiaonaitong,\n\nThanks for this very nice set of patches. I have just a few questions/remarks:\n- Why did you replace os.rename with shutil.copy? I don't think we want to keep the temporary files.\n- Could you add a comment before the line that checks for nt, and explain why you check for it?\n- I'm unsure about the completion patch. Are you _certain_ that it handle files with spaces correctly?\n- Let's get rid of sudo altogether in the install scripts. The user that needs it can simply run \"sudo ./install.sh\".\n. I'll try to have a look ASAP. I don't care at all about the commit history, as long as I can get a diff I'm OK.\n. @orefalo : before I merge this, can you test it also works for you?\n. @orefalo: do you still plan to test?\n. @orefalo: I've used msysgit and it would be great if autojump worked in this contest. However if you don't have time to test it now, maybe I'll merge this pull request anyway and we can work on supporting mysgit later.\n. BTW I think xiaonaitong is right, msysgit has a full-fledged bash, so adding the normal python version and adding it to the path in .bashrc should do the trick. \n. Thanks for testing! I've merged it, I hope it works well!\n. Thanks for your patch!\n. Any advice on how this library should be named and where it should be placed?\n. Thinking a bit more about this issue, can't you consider autojump as a stand-alone executable file **and** a library, possibly symlinking it to the place where libraries should be? I really want to keep autojump standalone.\n. Great! Thanks for trying.\n. I'm assuming this issue is closed, don't hesitate to re-open if needed.\n. (sorry for not answering earlier. I am very interested in your patch, but I'm trying to fix other issues first and I don't have a lot of time to dedicate to autojump).\n. The problem I see with your patch is that the user is never going to find $prefix/etc/autojump/autojump.bash . I think it would be better to copy those two files in $prefix/bin along with autojump and jumpapplet. What do you think?\n. I've merged your pull request manually, thanks!\n\nHowever I think it would be better to have the same options for zsh and bash. Wting has contributed a --local option for zsh, I think it would be nice to have for bash. Something to improve in the future, I guess :)\n. Hi,\n\nthis looks a lot like this closed issue:\n\nhttps://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/issues/62\n\nDoes the info in this thread help you?\n\nIn any case, in the future, could you include more information and context when reporting issues?\n. I'm glad you solved it.\n. Could you tell me what version of bash you have? (bash --version)\n. Whoops :) Thanks for tracking this down yourself, I was getting a bit nervous :)\n. Hi Sergio,\n\nyou're absolutely right, this should be documented somewhere. For python 2.4/2.5, try release #12. Afterwards I started supporting python3, and that required dropping support for 2.4 and 2.5.\n\nIf you add this to the wiki and the readme (submit a pull request!), I'd be very grateful.\n. Great! Thanks for testing! I look forward to merging your pull request :)\n. I'm with sergio on this one, older releases of autojump are useful for people stuck on old systems. It would be nice to add a message to the installer pointing these people to release #12.\n\nWe'll probably do the same when abandoning python 2.x, which I want to do pretty soon given that even debian stable ships python3.x.\n. Did you update to the latest version, released yesterday? There were some problems with Lion (https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/issues/58), but I thought they were fixed.\n\nIf that doesn't solve your problem, could you send me the value of your $PROMPT_COMMAND environment variable? Also check that you ~/.bashrc adequatly sources the autojump files.\n. Mmm, this isn't right then. The value of your $PROMPT_COMMAND environment variable will probably give us a clue.\n. Great! Thanks for the feedback!\n. Thanks for your contribution!\n. Are you still having issues with autojump? For the record, I didn't close this issue, you did. I can't answer you right now because I'm away for the rest of the week, but I'll try to help you next week if you still request it.\n. I'm all for this, but why did you remove the file \"_j\", which as far as I remember, is used for zsh completion?\n. This pull request doesn't apply cleanly anymore. I guess I must have merged them in the wrong order. However I think most changes are already accounted for in my master branch (from your other pull requests). Am I correct? Can I close this?\n. Can you report this bug to the homebrew packagers instead? I don't think there is anything I can do about it myself.\n. (don't hesitate to re-open if there is indeed something I should do)\n. So do you have the problem when installing with the installer? If not, can we close the issue for good?\n. Ever wondered why autojump is called that way and not \"j\"? Try typing `autojump work` instead of `j p` :)\n\n`j` is just a shell function that cds to the path autojump printed.\n. Thanks!\n. Mmm, that's pretty stupid, I wasn't aware of that. Re-opened.\n. Bonjour Tanguy,\n\nThere are two ways to achieve this currently:\n1. Keep pressing on the \"enter\" key for a few seconds.\n2. Manually edit the autojump.txt file (usually in ~/.local/share)\n\nDoes this meet your needs? If not, I'd be curious about what you would like exactly and how you would implement it. Maybe a simple bit of documentation is the solution?\n. This is an interesting issue... Autojump uses sys.getfilesystemencoding() (http://docs.python.org/library/sys.html#sys.getdefaultencoding) to figure out the encoding of the filesystem. However, this function doesn't take an argument, so it's bound to fail if different filesystems have different encodings.\n\nDoes anyone know what the right thing to do would be? Is this a bug in the python standard library? How are you supposed to find out the encoding of a filesystem on the various Unixes?\n. Hi Thibault,\n\nIt should be solved now. Can you check?\n. Ooh, I like that! I've hated this redundency for a loooong time, but I never got around to doing it.\n. Thanks again! I've merged everything, but I haven't taken the time to \nlook at it yet.

Hello Khalid,\n\nThanks for your contribution. I'm afraid I'm not going to be able to pull this pull request as is:\n- Adding a new, one-letter alias for all my users doesn't seem like a great idea. I must say though , your implementation is pretty elegant, and it would be nice to have as an option.\n- About the second change, I'm thinking about removing -P by default. One problem that arises if you remove -P is that the same directory will be counted in different entries, so I'm not entirely sure about this. Any comments for other people?\n. Thanks for contributing!\n. Hi Fabio,\n\nIf you find shift so expensive, why do you use capitals in your app's name (honnest question!)?\n\nI understand why you'd want this change, but unless there is overwhelming support for this, I'd rather leave it the way it is, because I think it makes sense to distinguish capitals from lowercase letters if the filesystem does.\n\nNote that as a work around, you can use any part of the name of the directory as a dirspec, so `j pp` would probably work. You can also change the behavior of autojump by patching it, it should be pretty straight forward (and I can help you if you're stuck).\n. @wting : I'll love your input on that question!\n. @wting any idea where those binary modules come from? Is this something I'm not aware of?\n. No worries, I just find it very weird to see .so files in the autojump user directory. Have a great conference!\n. We discussed a similar issue a while ago:\n\nhttps://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/issues/90\n\nI'm not fundamentally against adding an option, but keep in mind that it's already not that hard to do it. One advantage of the option would be better visibility for users who are not familiar with the way autojump works.\n. About the man page: I've written it directly using `groff` or whatever that's called, but it would probably be better to generate it directly from the README using pandoc for example. Maybe something similar could be done for the main wiki page as well.\n. What should it do? Should it display the help message instead?\n\nThat makes me think, should we use argparse instead of getopt? It seems like the current accepted way of parsing command lines argument. If we're going to change that piece of code, we could take the opportunity to do that change as well.\n. `j` is a bash alias, `autojump` is the actual command. `autojump --help` will work as expected.\n\nMaybe a smarter alias could detect an error code returned by autojump, for example?\n. I can't reproduce on my work machine with autojump on commit 448696ef9b1a3b799e6ce3b0397d7bcf98590700, which was a few weeks ago. Could this be due to your fix on issue #114?\n. We already have a recommended version for very old versions of python (v12). I think we can safely say that from v20 onwards you need at least python2.7 to run autojump.\n. BTW, IIRC you had a warning about this in the install script, maybe you should add a warning about argparse?\n. Hi jkuan,\n\nFor some reason github says your pull request \"cannot be automatically merged.\". Can you rebase it on the latest commit?\n. This was done by the debian package maintainer a while ago, after discussing the issue with me.\n\nI don't understand the problem. Isn't autojump supposed to work with python 3.x?\n. Reposting my email:\n\n## \n\nI must say I don't understand the problem you're describing. Python 2\nand 3 can perfectly live together on the same system. On Debian,\n/usr/bin/python is python2 and will stay that way, at least that's what\nTanguy told me. So I told him that in the long run we would drop 2.x\ncompatibility, and that since autojump is compatible with 3.x today, he\ncould start using it with 3.x on Debian right away.\n\nIf autojump doesn't work with 3.x, I think it's a bug we need to fix;\nbut I don't understand why the choice to use 3.x on Debian (for autojump\nonly!) is supposed to be a problem.\n. Use \"autojump\" instead of \"j\": `mv file $(autojump backup)`.\n\nKeep in mind that what you're doing is pretty dangerous :)\n. Are you trying to use the autojump command directly, as in `autojump directory`? If yes, that explains it. If you want to jump you need to use the \"j\" atlas, ie. `j directory`.\n. I suffer from this problem as well. I never thought of those damned **init**.py files when I devised the autojump completion mechanism a long time ago. Plus, at that time only \"j\" had completion so there was no problem!\n\nI still think the completion mechanism is useful for vim and friends, so maybe you're right and we should make these underscores configurable. I'd like to hear wting's take on the problem as well.\n. I don't think we should go down bloat alley, but I really like the completion functionality for other commands. The rationale for it is that in some cases, `cd` is not enough. The `cp` command, for instance, takes 2 arguments, which can be in very different directories. Vim works the same when you want to open multiple unrelated files.\n\nCould we maybe implement it differently? I don't like the idea of a configuration file with too many settings, I think we should strive as much as we can to find a set of reasonable settings that can work for everybody.\n. I do have in mind a complete readline replacement/enhancement that would generalize the idea behind autojump to everything you perform in the shell. But it's a completely different project :-D\n. I fully agree with your rationale, this is an issue that has been bugging me for a while. However the problem is that there is no good way to decide that two directories have \"similar scores\". Any ideas on how to implement this in a way that is both deterministic and simple to understand and predict by the user?\n. Autojump has had that feature for ages, just try it :) Except that the patterns are no longer regexes, if I recall correctly.\n. Here is a simpler implementation: \n\n```\nfunction jo { nautilus $(autojump $1); }\n```\n\nOr even, \"j whatever; nautilus .\" is what I used to do.\n\nMaybe a suggestion in the readme would be enough? I'm not sure how many commands we can add before user start complaining about namespace pollution. \n. function jo { xdg-open $(autojump $@); } is actually pretty cool, I think it's going to stay for a while in my .bashrc :)\n. Doesn't that require making j stateful?\n. It's been a while since I last worked on autojump, but isn't this already the case? The PROMPT_COMMAND is executed every time a prompt is displayed, which should happen only in interactive mode. If this is not the case in your system, than I would wager something is wrong with it.\n. It's working as designed. I agree it's not very intuitive.\n\nWhat you need to do is press tab another time. Then you will be presented with a list of options with numbers. Now type in the number you want, then <enter>, and that should make you jump where you want.\n. What does 'j wor' do? Does it jump anywhere?\n. Ooooh, I really like that idea! Thanks for the vim tip, too!\n. You probably didn't source the required file in your .bashrc. Read the comments for the package, I think they explain what you should do.\n. Isn't autojump supposed to be disabled in non-interactive shells? What's special about virtualenv?\n. Hi yaykyle,\n\nThe great news is, you don't need another flag, this is exactly what the \"autojump\" command does:\n\n```\n[joel@panda flickrapi]$ autojump foo\n/home/joel/workspace/LazyFooHaskell\n[joel@panda flickrapi]$\n```\n\nThe `j` shell function actually uses the autojump command behind the scenes to perform its work.\n. The red color is important because the destination directory is unpredictable. So it's important to draw the user's attention on where he ended up.\n\nThat said, maybe `j` could detect whether the output is a TTY.\n. Could'nt agree more. This has been ongoing since the very early days of autojump. I think #415 is the most promising here. Another idea could be to rename the autojump binary to something less tempting, since after all it's mostly an internal tool.\n. ",

Yeah I'm fine with that. :)\n. Continuation of @shelhamer's post from #110 since it's more appropriate here:\n\n> This raises the broader issue of ranking matches given both scores and match quality. The approx matching thread might be the place for this discussion. I'm mulling over whether or not it would ever be desirable to rank an approximate match with high scores over an exact match with almost zero score. This might be another matter of taste that could be configurable?\n\nI think exact matching should always take priority over higher weighted approximate matching. I second the exact > case insensitive > flex > approx match priority approach.\n\nI looked at the Vimeo video, and it looks like Quicksilver treats exact and flex string match results the same prioritizing higher weights. While I think that works well for Launchy / Quicksilver where the primary task is opening programs, autojump's primary task is finding directory names where acronyms are not used as much.\n. To anyone still interested in fuzzy searching, I've implemented a basic fuzzy search in d7cea406. The previous implementations have experienced bit rot, and I've been refactoring the code over the weekend.\n\nTo clarify autojump's matching priority:\n1. Try exact match.\n2. Try case insensitive match.\n3. Try fuzzy match.\n\nFuzzy matching is a last case scenario, and there are certain limitations to the current fuzzy matching implementation:\n- It is case insensitive.\n- It only matches against the end directory of any path:\n  \n  `bar` given path `/usr/bin/lib/foo/bar`\n- It returns the highest weighted entry that matches at least 60% using Python's [difflib.get_close_match()](http://docs.python.org/library/difflib.html#difflib.get_close_matches).\n  \n  It uses [SequenceMatcher](http://docs.python.org/library/difflib.html) to return a list of good enough matches. I've tested it with simple transposing / missing characters and it works well enough.\n- It does _not_ handle multiple directory matching: e.g. `j foo bar` will only use `bar` to match with.\n- It does _not_ handle acronyms or give extra priority to first character of letters: e.g. `j MIT` will not match against `~/Massachusetts Institution of Technology`\n  \n  Quicksilver-style works well when you have instant feedback as you're typing, in addition many program names are multiple words. On the other hand, autojump feedback is comparatively slow. Also, I don't think multiple word directories are prevalent except on Windows.\n\nSo basically if you accidentally misspell a long directory name (e.g. `j thisreallylongnam`), the current implementation has a good chance of finding the correct directory. However if you're using 2-3 character jumps (e.g. `j lib`) it probably won't work as you would expect since there's a high chance of getting an exact / case insensitive match.\n. I've implemented this 3 weeks ago and it has worked well enough for me over that period. As a result I'm going to go ahead and close this pull request.\n\nAs always, feel free to reopen this issue or create a new one if you have problems with approximate / fuzzy matching.\n. This has been fixed in @statik213's commit cfda2d0. To enable this setting, use the latest autojump version and set the environmental variable `export AUTOJUMP_KEEP_SYMLINKS=1` in your .bashrc or .zshrc.\n. Closed as won't fix. GNOME shell incompatibility is mentioned in documentation. \n. @daveshah: Next time can you create a new issue and link to this one rather than revive an old thread? This way the other users don't need to get unnecessarily notified.\n\nLast week when I submitted the patch to homebrew I tested it on 10.6.8 and it worked fine then. I'll retest it again once I get access to a MBP over the weekend.\n. This is most likely due to a Debian policy where we're not allowed to modify user profile files upon installation. Since Ubuntu is downstream, it's unlikely they've changed behavior back to what should be expected unless they repatched over Debian's patch.\n. @yugal: I'll need to look into it, but don't have time right now.\n\nIn the mean time you should [manually install](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/#manual-installation) autojump.\n. Yeah, I wish we could do it automatically for users but that runs afoul of Debian's guidelines. :crying_cat_face: \n. There is no easy way to catch syntax error within a Python script, this was the closest [answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/446052/python-best-way-to-check-for-python-version-in-program-that-uses-new-language-f?answertab=votes#tab-top) I could find.\n\nIt seems like the best resolution is to put a wrapper script around `autojump` that tests Python version. I'm not sure if you want to go down this route, and if not then issue can be closed.\n. The installation scripts are in bash and a pull request as already been submitted [here](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/pull/105).\n\nI'm not sure referring older releases for older Python versions is the right thing to do.\n. An incomplete zsh uninstall script got pushed to the wrong branch. I've rolled it back.\n. Yup, changes have been merged in already.\n. @shelhamer Would you mind submitting a pull request into autojump with the zsh tab completion fix?\n\nI'm testing it out and j + tab auto completion does not work in Linux with / without oh-my-zsh.\n. What version of autojump and how are you installing it?\n\nI mistakenly removed `__j` (which is needed for tab completion) and added it back in later. It's possible there's a lag in the homebrew version, but I don't have a Mac so it's not easy for me to test.\n. FYI, from [Python3UnicodeDecodeError](http://wiki.python.org/moin/Python3UnicodeDecodeError):\n\n> On UNIX (and other operating systems), it's possible to mount different file systems using different charsets. sys.getdefaultencoding() will be the same for the different file systems since this encoding is only used between Python and the Linux kernel, not between the kernel and the file system which may uses a different charset.\n\nI tried to reproduce the bug locally but couldn't, so I've requested more info in the RedHat bug report.\n. Thanks for following up on this issue.\n\nI need to set aside some time to work on it. However at the same time, I'm hoping when RedHat upgrades to a newer version of Autojump using Python 3 these Unicode related problems will _magically_ go away. One can hope...\n. Yes.\n\nRight now Autojump supports Python 2 and 3. When it detects Python 2, it applies a basic UTF wrapping around strings. The traceback from the second bug shows a problem with one of those functions (called `encode()` and `decode()`). Since Python  3 uses Unicode strings natively, I'm hoping that will solve the 2nd bug.\n\nWhat Tanguy Ortolo (Debian maintainer) did was apply a quick [patch](http://packages.debian.org/sid/autojump) to replace the first line of autojump with `#!/usr/bin/python` \u2192 `#!/usr/bin/python3` and change the respective package dependencies.\n. No problem. I hope to release v21 in a month or two. v21-rc is available right now, I've been quite busy over the past few months ([changelog](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/blob/v21-rc/ChangeLog)).\n. @tnorth: I've fixed this issue in faf0854, and commented on the RedHat bug as well.\n\nI'm closing this issue due to inactivity. If the behavior reappears please let us know (preferably here, but I'm subscribed to the RedHat bug report as well).\n. Finished in [issue 100](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/pull/100) and [issue 101](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/pull/101).\n. That was one of the first things I tried but unfortunately not.\n. Full path doesn't bother me, but that's probably because I use a [2 line prompt](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4109351/pics/gnzh-zsh-theme.png).\n\nI do have an issue with duplicate entries though, since sometimes I'll use the symlink and other times the full path and would like them weighted the same. However the fix may not be worth the hassle.\n\nWhy not just have the symlink feature available as an option with some caveats? Enable it using an environmental variable and let users worry about duplicate entries.\n. Thanks for explaining, that makes more sense.\n\nWhy not just strip the s function and submit another pull request? The zsh changes would be identical with the exception of single -> double braces.\n. @kevinburke: This has been fixed in the latest commit e96dc4c.\n\nThe problem was making sure zsh's compinit was loaded. If you prefer not to upgrade autojump, you can also fix the problem by adding this line to your ~/.zshrc: `autoload -U compinit; compinit`.\n. ZSH tab completion was not working at all before.

I don't think there should be a reason we can't support this, but as with this and fuzzy/flex matching people are going to start having separate opinions as to preferred behavior.\n\nI think we should start implementing a way to modify autojump's behavior, either through the use of an `~/.autojumprc` or environmental variables.\n. @irrationalfab : Pull the latest commit and set the environmental variable `export AUTOJUMP_IGNORE_CASE=1`. autojump will ignore case and return the highest matching path.\n. It was a quick fix and I've bumped it to v20-5. Reinstall and let me know how it goes.\n\n``` console\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa ~/Cocoa \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a \u2039ruby-1.9.3\u203a \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  echo $AUTOJUMP_IGNORE_CASE\n1\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa ~ \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a \u2039ruby-1.9.3\u203a \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  js | grep cocoa\n21.9:   /home/ting/feeds.cocoapods.org\n61.3:   /home/ting/Cocoa\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa ~ \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a \u2039ruby-1.9.3\u203a \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  j coco\n/home/ting/Cocoa\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa ~/Cocoa \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a \u2039ruby-1.9.3\u203a \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4\n```\n. @joelthelion I'm currently traveling over the next two weeks attending a conference so I won't have time to look into right now, but am aware of this.\n\n@lukexor The installer only checks for a minimum Python version, as the base Python install should cover all the required modules (as tested on Arch/Ubuntu/Debian/Cygwin/OS X).\n\nThe only changes in `autojump` between v19 and current is the try-catch block for full disk errors.\n. The installer just dumps files from the repo into `~/.autojump` after\nchecking a few environmental settings, no .so files should be there.\n\nOn Fri, Mar 23, 2012 at 7:04 PM, Joel Schaerer <\nreply@reply.github.com\n\n> wrote:\n> \n> No worries, I just find it very weird to see .so files in the autojump\n> user directory.

Thanks for the comments, I'll look into making these issues aren't present in v22.0.\n. Oh then it's primarily a documentation issue then. I mean the two places I checked (`--help` and man page) didn't contain anything about it.\n\nI've been meaning to update both for a while now when I get some free time...\n\nIn the meantime this can go on the back burner.\n. There's no need for a rewrite. Then again, there really isn't a reason not to migrate to argparse either now that optparse is deprecated as of 2.7.\n\nIf something fails, it should fail cleanly. A help message explaining missing arguments is sufficient. Take `rm` as an example:\n\n```\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa /tmp  \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  rm -v                                                                                                   2012.03.28 22:10:21 JST \nrm: missing operand\nTry `rm --help' for more information.\n```\n. Fixed in the latest commit 465ca79. The `j` function now tests the existence of the directory autojump returns before changing directories.\n. Autojump does not print out any errors if the directory does not exist. Also, `j --help` calls `autojump --help` which prints the help message and returns a 0 exit status. That makes it difficult to test against.\n\nI've updated the `j` function to print out an error message when it doesn't jump to a directory when called.\n. I just reproduced it on Arch and Ubuntu Server with the latest  commit 8decc17f3e, both running under Python v2.7.2.\n. Reading through the code, apparently jumping to the current directory is not allowed because the directory may no longer exist.\n. Thanks for the notice, the rewrite to use argparse over optparse bumped up minimum version Python version to 2.7.\n\nv20 supports v2.7+, v3.2+.\nv19 supports v2.6+, v3.0+.\nv12 supports v2.4+.\n\nI just tested v20 on my Ubuntu server with only Python 2.7.2 installed and it works fine.\n. @jkuan: Hmm, you could try upgrading Python to v2.7. It's probably better in the long run.\n\nHow should we handle this?\n1. Direct them to download and use v19.\n2. Ask users to upgrade Python to v2.7. Python site [recommendation](http://www.python.org/download/mac/) is to have users separately install Python since OS X's Python is 1-2 years behind when release anyway.\n3. Ask users to install argparse separately using `pip install`.\n4. [Bundle argparse](https://code.google.com/p/argparse/) with autojump.\n5. Roll back to use optparse instead of argparse.\n. Thanks @jkuan!\n. This is fixed in commit 8decc17f3e.\n\nDocumentation and install.sh now direct users to upgrade Python or install older versions. A -f / --force option is added to install.sh to bypass dependency checks.\n. I'm sorry to hear you're having problems. How did you install autojump?\n\nI grepped the latest commit and v19 source code, but `update_terminal_cwd` is not referenced anywhere. On my Linux machine running the latest version in bash:\n\n```\n[test@noa autojump]$ echo $PROMPT_COMMAND\n{ [[ \"$AUTOJUMP_HOME\" == \"$HOME\" ]] && (autojump -a \"$(pwd ${_PWD_ARGS})\"&)>/dev/null 2>>\"${AUTOJUMP_DATA_DIR}/.autojump_errors\";} 2>/dev/null ; printf \"\\033]0;%s@%s:%s\\007\" \"${USER}\" \"${HOSTNAME%%.*}\" \"${PWD/#$HOME/~}\"\n```\n\nAs you said, `autojump.bash` just uses whatever `$PROMPT_COMMAND` was being set to before. Is it possible you have something else modifying `$PROMPT_COMMAND`?\n. Apple Terminal adds the function `update_terminal_cwd()` to `/etc/bashrc` for updating terminal window titles.\n\nIt looks like it checks if it's inside emacs, and only runs if it is not. However your emacs is not properly setting the `$INSIDE_EMACS` environmental variable, thus trying to call `update_terminal_cwd()` when it shouldn't be.\n\nYour solution is to use a different terminal (I'd suggest [iTerm](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home)), or properly set `$INSIDE_EMACS` whenever running emacs.\n\nIf this does not resolve your issue, please feel free to reopen it.\n. If you're on 2.6, the alternative is also to use `pip install argparse`. In the long term, we're looking to stabilize autojump on 2.7 and 3+.\n\nEdit: From what I understand you're asking that autojump includes the argparse module with the program?\n. The root problem is that OS X will always ship with a minimum 1-2 year old Python version. The overwhelming Mac community recommendation is to separately install and upgrade the system's version of Python.\n\nThe problem is there is a disconnect between OS X users that use the command line a lot (autojump's target demographic) but doesn't upgrade Python (i.e. non-Python devs). I'm hoping that `pip install argparse` is a viable compromise.\n\nIt's difficult to balance backwards compatibility and continue improving autojump. While Debian is on 2.5, and OS X on 2.6, Cygwin / Linux is on 2.7 for a while now. 2.7 is also a planned \"LTS\" release as well, so I feel that should be an acceptable bare minimum target Python.\n. @blueyed: Thanks for the pull request, it's been merged!\n. Thanks for giving us a heads up.\n\nCan you reply back with the output from these two commands:\n1. `python --version`\n2. `/usr/bin/autojump --version`\n\nI'm on Arch, but will install Ubuntu 12.04 on a VM to test this out within a few days.\n. Sorry, try an `aptitude show autojump`. If aptitude doesn't exist, please use apt-get to install it.\n. Hi Philip,\n\nI had a friend run `sudo apt-get install autojump && autojump --version` on Ubuntu 12.04 and it worked fine. However he was using the distro default Python 3.2.3. I also tested release v18 under Python 2.7.3 with no problems, which leads me to think you might have a problem with your (custom?) Python installation.\n\nTry:\n\n```\n$ python\nPython 2.7.3 (default, Apr 24 2012, 00:00:54) \n[GCC 4.7.0 20120414 (prerelease)] on linux2\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> from __future__ import division, print_function\n>>> \n```\n\nIf there's any errors, then it would indicate a problem with your Python install.\n. That was modified by the package maintainer.\n\nRelease 18 uses `#!/usr/bin/env python` because autojump supports both Python 2 and 3. When you ran the `aptitude show autojump` earlier, it specified that the package depends on Python 3.\n\nI need to track down if this downstream modification was done by the Debian package maintainer or the Ubuntu package maintainer.\n\nThanks again for opening this issue.\n. @joelthelion: You're right, I've gone ahead and closed the Debian bug report.\n\nThis seems to be a localized problem to @philip's install of Python 3.\n\n```\n\u256d\u2500wting@ps95950 ~ \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a \u2039system\u203a \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  cat /etc/issue\nDebian GNU/Linux 6.0 \\n \\l\n\u256d\u2500wting@ps95950 ~ \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a \u2039system\u203a \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  python3\nPython 3.1.3 (r313:86834, Nov 28 2010, 10:01:07) \n[GCC 4.4.5] on linux2\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> from __future__ import division, print_function\n>>> \n```\n\n```\n\u256d\u2500ting@punk ~ \u2039python-2.7.2\u203a \u2039ruby-1.9.3\u203a \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  cat /etc/issue\nUbuntu 12.04 LTS \\n \\l\n\u256d\u2500ting@punk ~ \u2039python-2.7.2\u203a \u2039ruby-1.9.3\u203a \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  python3\nPython 3.2.2 (default, Sep  5 2011, 22:09:30) \n[GCC 4.6.1] on linux2\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> from __future__ import division, print_function\n>>> \n```\n\n```\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa ~ \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a \u2039ruby-1.9.3\u203a \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  uname -r\n3.3.4-1-ARCH\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa ~ \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a \u2039ruby-1.9.3\u203a \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  python3\nPython 3.2.3 (default, Apr 23 2012, 23:14:44) \n[GCC 4.7.0 20120414 (prerelease)] on linux2\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> from __future__ import division, print_function\n>>> \n```\n. Please run `autojump --version` and let me know the output.\n\nAlso, what is the `plugins=()` line in your ~/.zshrc contain?\n. The autojump plugin is unnecessary as long as you have the `[[ -s ... ]] && source` line from install.sh in your ~/.zhsrc.\n\nWhat's the output of these commands:\n\n``` console\n$ ls -al ~/.local/share/autojump\n$ autojump --add /tmp\n$ ls -al ~/.local/share/autojump\n$ tail ~/.local/share/autojump/autojump.txt\n```\n. Sorry for the late response, I've been a bit busy these days.\n\nIt looks like you're upgrading over from an older installation since autojump_py hasn't been used since release-v15. There is some migration code in place for older versions but it's possible that it's not working.\n\nI haven't tested it extensively, but it's now on my to do list when I have time to get around to it. Thanks for bringing it to my attention though.\n. @eallik I just wanted to mention that it has been in the README and manpage for ~1 month now, although it was implemented earlier. If you have an older version of autojump the manpages may not have been updated yet.\n. Symlink option works fine on my end.\n\n``` console\n[test@noa ~]$ autojump --version\nautojump release-v20-9\n[test@noa ~]$ export AUTOJUMP_KEEP_SYMLINKS=1\n[test@noa ~]$ mkdir test\n[test@noa ~]$ ln -s test test-sym\n[test@noa ~]$ j sym\nautojump: directory 'sym' not found\nTry `autojump --help` for more information.\n[test@noa ~]$ cd test-sym\n[test@noa test-sym]$ cd\n[test@noa ~]$ j sym\n/home/test/test-sym\n[test@noa test-sym]$ \n```\n\n@eallik: Statik is just trying to help, no need to get defensive.\n\nYou must enter a directory before it is added into autojump's database. That's why your example didn't work.\n\n``` console\n~$ export AUTOJUMP_KEEP_SYMLINKS=1\n~$ mkdir testdir\n~$ ln -s testdir testdir-sym\n~$ j testdir-sym\nautojump: directory 'testdir-sym' not found\nTry `autojump --help` for more information.\n~$ j testdir\n/Users/erik.allik/testdir\n```\n\nThat last line `j testdir` should not work _unless_ you've already created the directory before and it was pre-existing in the database.\n\nAlso, what @statik213 said was correct. Let's say your database looks like this:\n\n```\n100        /testdir\n```\n\nYou create a new symlink and add it to the database:\n\n```\n100        /testdir\n10         /testdir-sym\n```\n\nIf you type `j test`, autojump will still jump to the first entry because it's weighted higher. @statik213's point was that even if you add a symlink without resetting your database, if the names are overlapping you will still visit the full path, higher weighted database entry instead of the new symlink entry.\n\nIf you want to always prioritize symlinks over full paths, your best option is to zero out the current database and start over. Simply run `> ~/.local/share/autojump.txt`.\n. ```\n~$ j foobarbaz\n/Users/erik.allik/foobarbaz\n```\n\nAs I stated before, this should never happen unless you have a pre-existing entry in your database. Autojump does not know anything about your file system until you've entered that directory.\n1. Check which version of autojump you're running: `autojump --version`\n2. Git rid of the existing autojump database: `mv ~/.local/share/autojump/ ~/`\n3. Make sure the setting is enabled: `export AUTOJUMP_KEEP_SYMLINKS=1`\n\nYou should be fine after those steps.\n. I created a new test user, downloaded and installed autojump v20, and tested symlinks. I can't reproduce your behavior:\n\n``` console\n\n[test@noa ~]$ cd ~/code/autojump/\n[test@noa autojump]$ git checkout release-v20\nNote: checking out 'release-v20'.\n[test@noa autojump]$ ./install.sh \n\nInstalling bash version of autojump to /home/test/.autojump ...\n\n\u2018icon.png\u2019 -> \u2018/home/test/.autojump/share/autojump/icon.png\u2019\n\u2018jumpapplet\u2019 -> \u2018/home/test/.autojump/bin/jumpapplet\u2019\n\u2018autojump\u2019 -> \u2018/home/test/.autojump/bin/autojump\u2019\n\u2018autojump.1\u2019 -> \u2018/home/test/.autojump/share/man/man1/autojump.1\u2019\n\u2018autojump.sh\u2019 -> \u2018/home/test/.autojump/etc/profile.d/autojump.sh\u2019\n\u2018autojump.bash\u2019 -> \u2018/home/test/.autojump/etc/profile.d/autojump.bash\u2019\n\nPlease add the line to ~/.bashrc :\n\n    [[ -f ~/.autojump/etc/profile.d/autojump.bash ]] && source ~/.autojump/etc/profile.d/autojump.bash\n\nYou need to run 'source ~/.bashrc' before you can start using autojump.\n\nTo remove autojump, run './uninstall.sh'\n\n[test@noa autojump]$ vim ~/.bashrc\n[test@noa autojump]$ source ~/.bashrc \n[test@noa autojump]$ autojump --version\nautojump release-v20\n[test@noa autojump]$ export AUTOJUMP_KEEP_SYMLINKS=1\n[test@noa autojump]$ > ~/.local/share/autojump/autoju[test@noa autojump]$ source ~/.bashrcmp.txt\n[test@noa autojump]$ cat ~/.local/share/autojump/autojump.txt\n1.0 /home/test/code/autojump\n[test@noa autojump]$ cd ~/test-sym\n[test@noa test-sym]$ cat ~/.local/share/autojump/autojump.txt\n2.0 /home/test/code/autojump\n1.0 /home/test/test-sym\n[test@noa test-sym]$ \n```\n\nMy only suggestion at this point is to wipe out autojump and it's database and start over with the latest version.\n\n``` console\n$ rm -fr ~/.autojump\n$ rm -fr ~/.local/share/autojump\n$ git clone git://github.com/joelthelion/autojump.git\n$ cd autojump\n$ ./install.sh\n$ source ~/.bashrc\n```\n. By default, autojump.bash uses `pwd -P` (physical full path) to add the directory the database. If the symlinks = 1, then it uses just regular `pwd`.\n\nWith Linux, `pwd` == `pwd -L`. Is this not the case for OS X? Unfortunately I don't use / have access to a Mac to test with.\n\nTry modifying `~/.autojump/etc/profile.d/autojump.bash` line 54 to `_PWD_ARGS=\"-L\"`. Does that solve the symlink issue?\n. ``` python\ntry:\n    current_dir = decode(os.path.realpath(os.curdir))\nexcept OSError:\n    current_dir = None\n```\n\n`current_dir` is only used to make sure the user doesn't jump into the current directory. Granted this is still a bug with symlinks, but not one that should be causing the problems in this thread. Both adding and searching the database does resolve to physical path.\n\n``` python\nclass Database:\n    def add(self, path, increment = 10):\n        \"\"\"\n        Increment existing paths or initialize new ones to 10.\n        \"\"\"\n        if path not in self.data:\n            self.data[path] = increment\n        else:\n            import math\n            self.data[path] = math.sqrt((self.data[path]**2)+(increment**2))\n        self.save()\n```\n\nIf you look up all instances of the variable `patterns`, you'll notice it's never modified to resolve to real path.\n\nIn either case, I've fixed this in the latest commit 3a7f211fb6.\n. I borrowed a friend's MBP (10.6.8) for testing.\n\n``` console\nmacbook-wlan:~ ting$ bash --version\nGNU bash, version 3.2.48(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin10.0)\nCopyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nmacbook-wlan:~ ting$ autojump --version\nautojump release-v20-9\nmacbook-wlan:~ ting$ echo $AUTOJUMP_KEEP_SYMLINKS\n1\nmacbook-wlan:~ ting$ ls -al | grep test\ndrwxr-xr-x   2 ting  staff    68 Jun  6 22:07 test\nlrwxr-xr-x   1 ting  staff     4 Jun  6 22:07 test-sym -> test\nmacbook-wlan:~ ting$ >~/.local/share/autojump/autojump.txt\nmacbook-wlan:~ ting$ j -s\nTotal key weight: 0.

Try it out and let me see if that works for you.\n. This should be doable, I'll look into it.\n. Implemented in above commit. Please install the latest version to test it out.\n. Problem eliminated in commit f41d0fb.\n. Implementation shouldn't be difficult (add `autojump.fish` wrapper), but not a priority. You're more than welcome to add it and send a pull request.\n. Every directory you visit needs to be added to the database via a shell hook. This is done in Bash by modifying `$PROMPT_COMMAND`, and adding a function to Zsh's `preexec_functions`. I'm not sure what the fish equivalent would be.\n. Closed as duplicate of #127.\n. Thanks!\n. This a narrow use case and I'd rather not make the change.\n\nIf you are cloning the repo into ~/.autojump, can't you just modify .zshrc and add ~/.autojump/bin to the $fpath after calling autojump.zsh?\n. Unfortunately I don't have any good metrics of how people are using autojump. I only have a very rough idea from Ubuntu / Debian package popularity count and the issues that get reported.\n\nFrom what I can tell, most users install using package managers and not from source. For source users, I've tried to minimize setup / teardown as much as possible with the install / uninstall scripts.\n\nFor my dev and testing machines I just symlink everything from ~/.autojump to the source files. However other machines I just do a `git pull && ./install.sh`.\n. > I have some entries in the autojump database which match \"down\" but do not exist.\n\nMissing directories are not auto-purged because some users will mount drives temporarily (usb drives, network locations, etc).\n. Sorry for the terrible turnaround time.\n\nIt would be better if missing entries were not jumped to, but it also involves checking each entry that matches. This can cause certain lag problems (e.g. hdd's that require spin up) so I'm not sure if I should fix it or not.\n. Closed as no longer relevant in v22+.\n\n`j path__1__/totally/fake/directory<tab>` will be replaced with `j /totally/fake/directory`.\n. I'll look into this. Autojump should definitely support directories with hyphens in the middle though.\n. @JrCs: Should be working now, let me know if you still have problems.\n. Thanks for bringing this up, I didn't realize that was standard etiquette. I've gone ahead and removed it from `autojump.zsh` and updated the documentation to reflect the changes.\n\nUsers now need to manually add compinit loading to `~/.zshrc` if they want tab completion.\n. Closed as duplicate of #136, has been fixed in RC.2.\n. Can you copy paste the output from these commands please?\n\n``` console\n$ autojump --version\n$ zsh --version\n$ python --version\n$ setopt\n```\n. No problem, glad you got everything working.\n. Sorry about the long delay. I can't seem to reproduce the issue.\n\n``` bash\n[test@noa ~]$ echo $SHELL\n/bin/bash\n[test@noa ~]$ echo $PROMPT_COMMAND\n{ [[ \"$AUTOJUMP_HOME\" == \"$HOME\" ]] && (autojump -a \"$(pwd ${_PWD_ARGS})\"&)>/dev/null 2>>\"${AUTOJUMP_DATA_DIR}/.autojump_errors\";} 2>/dev/null ; printf \"\\033]0;%s@%s:%s\\007\" \"${USER}\" \"${HOSTNAME%%.*}\" \"${PWD/#$HOME/~}\"\n[test@noa ~]$ cat test.sh \n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nexit 1\n[test@noa ~]$ ./test.sh \n[test@noa ~]$ echo $?\n1\n[test@noa ~]$ \n```\n. Thanks for the explanation and the patch!\n. FYI your patch causes problems for OS X 10.8.x users so I've reversed the changes in v21.0.5.\n. Your patched worked with me on 10.6.8, so I'm not sure why other users are having problems with the same line.\n\nPlease refer to issues #159 and #160.\n. Thanks for the bug report and doing a lot of the legwork.\n\nIt's not documented anywhere, but running autojump in bash allows you to auto complete certain commands such as vim. Unfortunately you ran into a bug with this.\n\nIn my opinion, tools should do one thing well and for `autojump` that should be `cd` only. However, as @joelthelion was the one who made this commit I'll let him make the final decision.\n. Another issue is this isn't implemented in the zsh version, so now we have the additional problem of different functionality between bash and zsh version. \n. Use `export AUTOJUMP_AUTOCOMPLETE_CMDS='cp vim emacs'` in your ~/.bashrc.\n. Thanks for the patch. Unfortunately, while I believe PEP 8 is important I do not believe strict adherence is necessary.\n. I can't seem to reproduce your problem:\n\n``` zsh\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa /tmp \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a \u2039ruby-1.9.3\u203a \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  mkdir vcmcnipovpoivxzoivvcxzvcxvcxz                              2012.10.30 22:22:47 CDT \n\u256d\u2500ting@noa /tmp \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a \u2039ruby-1.9.3\u203a \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  cd vcmcnipovpoivxzoivvcxzvcxvcxz                                 2012.10.30 22:23:03 CDT \n\u256d\u2500ting@noa /tmp/vcmcnipovpoivxzoivvcxzvcxvcxz \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a \u2039ruby-1.9.3\u203a \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  ..                                                               2012.10.30 22:23:04 CDT \n\u256d\u2500ting@noa /tmp \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a \u2039ruby-1.9.3\u203a \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  j vcmcnip                                                        2012.10.30 22:23:05 CDT \n/tmp/vcmcnipovpoivxzoivvcxzvcxvcxz\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa /tmp/vcmcnipovpoivxzoivvcxzvcxvcxz \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a \u2039ruby-1.9.3\u203a \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  j vcmcnip                                                        2012.10.30 22:23:09 CDT \n/tmp/vcmcnipovpoivxzoivvcxzvcxvcxz\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa /tmp/vcmcnipovpoivxzoivvcxzvcxvcxz \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a \u2039ruby-1.9.3\u203a \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4                                                                   2012.10.30 22:23:13 CDT \n```\n\nWhat version of autojump are you using? I remember running into this problem in the past and patched it a while ago.\n. Closed because I can't reproduce and no response from OP.\n. This is due to an upstream Debian policy not to modify user's ~/.*rc files. I'll look into asking Ubuntu if they can unpatch Debian's modifications.\n. Closed as duplicate of #65 (but am still working on this issue).\n. This can be achieved by typing `j<tab><tab>`. On ZSH, you need to load the `compinit` module in your `~/.zshrc`.\n\nYou can also partially complete the menu by typing `j directory<tab><tab>`.\n. Something like that would need to be much more interactive and/or persistent. Sorry, but that's out of the scope of autojump. \n. Closed as will not implement. :(\n. Another possible method is to use multiple arguments. Say you have the following structure:\n\n```\n~/appweb\n~/dev/app\n```\n\nTo jump to the second entry, you can use `j dev a` (or something similar). However if `app` and `appweb` are in the same directory then this method doesn't work.\n. > Couldn't you look at the top entries (sorted by score) and the apply a length-based filter on them?\n\nIf the database was:\n\n```\n$ j -s\n20.0 foobar\n10.0 foo\n$ j foo\n```\n\nWhy would you want the normal behavior to return `foo` instead of `foobar`?\n\n> If there is no score property available, you may want to sort the top five(?) entries by length - but that would mix in totally unrelated entries probably.\n\nAll entries in a database have an initial score of 10.0. Also, sorting top n entries would require parsing the entire database for every search (right now it quits at first match).\n\nA better option is probably to provide an exact match option, e.g. `j (-e|--exact) foo`which only matches against same length directory names.\n. I wanted to mention that in the latest version (v21.2.0) I added `jc`. It basically restricts autojump to sub-directories of the current working directory. This may help alleviate OP's problem in certain situations.\n. Closed as `wontfix`.\n. I'll go ahead and close it, if you can reproduce it just update this issue.\n. I'll go ahead and add this into man pages for the next release.\n. Ha, I think I submitted a pull request that did this a year ago to Joel.\n\nAnyway, this is pretty easy to change on an individual basis. At these 2 lines at the end of `~/.autojump/etc/profile.d/autojump.bash` (or `.zsh`):\n\n``` shell\n    new_path=\"$(autojump $@)\"\n    if [ -d \"${new_path}\" ]; then\n        echo -e \"\\\\033[31m${new_path}\\\\033[0m\"\n        cd \"${new_path}\"\n        clear\n        ls\n    else\n        echo \"autojump: directory '${@}' not found\"\n        echo \"Try \\`autojump --help\\` for more information.\"\n        false\n    fi\n```\n. Sure that'd be fine. However I'm not sure how HomeBrew works, so when autojump gets upgraded it may overwrite your symlink.\n. Yeah there are a lot of ways to do this and a lot of ways to customize this, which is why I'd prefer this be implemented as a shell tweak.\n. That's odd, as I'm running nearly the exact configuration. What's the output of `autojump --complete` and `autojump --version`?\n. You say you checked out commit 16e0c51, but the version number for that commit is [v21-rc2](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/blob/16e0c51bae6d1ff4948d39ba57ced1b0e79bee06/bin/autojump#L37).\n\nv17 is fairly old, but I would remove autojump and try installing it again:\n\n``` zsh\n$ rm -fr ~/.autojump/\n$ git clone git://github.com/joelthelion/autojump.git /tmp/autojump/\n$ /tmp/autojump/install.sh\n$ source ~/.zshrc\n$ autojump --version\n$ autojump --complete\n```\n. I just checked out master branch, it's on v21-rc2. Run `which autojump`, you may be running a distro version.\n. First, remove it from your package manager, run the uninstall script, then try the install script:\n\n```\n$ sudo aptitude purge -y autojump\n$ git clone git://github.com/joelthelion/autojump.git\n$ sudo ./uninstall.sh\n$ ./install.sh\n$ source ~/.zshrc\n$ autojump --version\n```\n. After running `install.sh`, can you double check that `~/.autojump/etc/profile.d/autojump.zsh` exists and if so, manually source it?\n. If autojump.zsh exists, then this line in your ~/.zshrc should be sourcing the file properly: \n\n``` zsh\n [[ -s ~/.autojump/etc/profile.d/autojump.zsh ]] && source ~/.autojump/etc/profile.d/autojump.zsh\n```\n. If you can run that above command from the terminal and get autojump working, then at this point there is something wrong with your system loading `~/.zshrc` and not much I can help with. Perhaps try temporarily removing oh my zsh?\n. Thanks for the pull request!\n. Which version are you running? `autojump --version`\n\nI have inconsistent access to a Mac, so it may take me a while to track down the root cause.\n. `autojump <dir>` should always display the matching directory, but not jump to it. The `j` function is used for changing directories.\n\nAre you on bash / zsh? Does the output directory exist? Are you using a `-` when using `j`? Is there a `-` in the directory name? Can you copy / paste the terminal output?\n\nI just tested on a friend's MBP (OS 10.6.8, bash 3.2.48) with the latest github version and it worked fine in both zsh and bash.\n. @stephenluu: You're not supposed to call autojump directly, but rather source the relevant shell (e.g. [bash](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/blob/master/bin/autojump.bash)). This is setup when you run `./install.py`.\n. This was a problem with oh-my-zsh and not autojump.\n. Are you running into the same problems as #146?\n\nOr do you want to set this as default behavior? Or do you want to pass a flag to enable this option?\n. Ahh missed that, thanks. \n. Thanks for the pull request!\n. Since #159 and #160 are duplicates but that one has more users participating I'll only update that issue to prevent discussion fragmentation.\n. Thanks for the bug report.\n\nThat line was recently changed so I've reverted the line back to the original statement. I'll be updating the Homebrew formula shortly.\n. I've submitted a Homebrew [pull request](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/pull/16196) to fix this issue downstream.\n. Hi, can someone with the original problem please test JrCs's [command-prompt branch](https://github.com/JrCs/autojump/tree/command-prompt) and verifies that it doesn't cause problems?\n\nUnfortunately, I don't have access to OS 10.8 to test this myself.\n. Thanks for the rewrite.\n\nI had to modify it quite a bit to get it working for a bunch of different use cases, but it's merged into master now.\n. Thanks for the info! I've made the changes in master branch.\n. Thanks for your patch. Once someone in the original issues thread has successfully tested it I'll merge it.\n. Thanks for catching that. I've handled it further down in the switch statement instead.\n. Oops you're right. I blame the turkey. Merged your commit bcb7ffe.\n. Thanks for the patch!\n. This was removed a while back. Please refer to:\n\n``` bash\n$ autojump --help\n```\n\nOn a side note, the `j` command now accepts options so this is completely valid:\n\n``` bash\n$ j -s\n```\n. Really busy over the next 2 weeks, will look into this when I can.\n. I need some clarification.\n\n`j bundle` should always jump to `/srv/example.com/current/vendor/dotsunited/bundlefu`, regardless of the current directory.\n\nIs `j bundle__2__/home/user/.dotfiles/vim/bundle` not changing directory as expected?\n. Hmm, this was the behavior in past releases. It looks like I borked it somewhere. I'll look into fixing it.\n. I fixed this in a99183bf8b7cf322161ca42bcf4d70dbc3741673. Can you verify that it works for you?\n. > I have another issue in this context: autojump will return no results if the current directory matches, but gets skipped now (again). Also, j will return an error (because of the empty result from autojump).\n\nThis is the expected behavior if it would match. The end result is you're still in the # 1 matching directory, albeit with an error.\n. I tried reproducing it on ArchLinux but couldn't. I average 3 seconds per `cd` to a remote sshfs mount, with or without autojump. I then tested it on a LAN sshfs and still average 0-1 second per `cd` with autojump.\n\nNeed to borrow a Mac and test on a LAN sshfs mount when I get a chance.\n\nEvery time you `cd` it calls `autojump -a <directory name>` to update the database. That's probably what is causing the lag.\n\nCan you verify this by running these two lines and seeing if there's a discrepancy?\n\n``` bash\n$ autojump -a /tmp\n$ autojump -a <sshfs mount directory>\n```\n. > Another odd thing is that, when on the remote mount, even giving me back a prompt after doing a simple ls takes much longer with autojump loaded. I do a j Volumes gmm and it shows me the correct directory in red almost immediately, then stalls before giving me my prompt back.\n\nThis is the entire jump function:\n\n``` bash\nfunction j { \n    if [[ ${@} =~ ^-{1,2}.* ]]; then\n        autojump ${@}\n        return\n    fi  \n\n    new_path=\"$(autojump $@)\" # calls autojump <args> for correct directory to jump to\n    if [ -d \"${new_path}\" ]; then\n        echo -e \"\\\\033[31m${new_path}\\\\033[0m\" # print directory in red\n        cd \"${new_path}\" # switch to new directory\n    else\n        echo \"autojump: directory '${@}' not found\"\n        echo \"Try \\`autojump --help\\` for more information.\"\n        false\n    fi  \n}\n```\n\nThere should be no conceivable lag on autojump's part between the two lines, except for the time to execute `cd` (sshfs lag).\n\nCan you try these two things?\n1. With autojump loaded, run `unset PROMPT_COMMAND`. This will remove the autojump hook. Does it still lag for `cd`, `ls`, etc?\n2. Reload autojump. Unmount all sshfs. Mount `sshfs localhost:/tmp/ /home/user/tmp/`. Does it lag?\n. Run these commands:\n1. reload autojump\n2. `unset PROMPT_COMMAND`\n3. `cd /tmp/ && autojump_add_to_database`\n   Any lag?\n4. Repeat step 3 except with an sshfs mount. Any lag?\n\nI noticed you're in UT CS. I'm doing undergrad research with Shmatikov btw. :p\n. > 1. Autojump is loaded, and I j volumes gmm<TAB> (request autocompletion suggestions) for somewhere in the remote mount. Not a big deal, and understandable why it might be laggy.\n\nautojump is finding all matching directories, and then checking to make sure they exist. That last part is probably what is causing the lag for remote systems.\n\n> 1. Autojump is loaded, my pwd is somewhere in the remote mount, and bash needs to show me the prompt. Doesn't matter if I've just j'ed in, or cd'd to a subdirectory, or exited sbt -- it lags before showing prompt.\n\nThis bothers me quite a bit, as autojump should not be causing lag in this situation. From what I can tell, it's caused by something in `PROMPT_COMMAND` but not by `autojump_add_to_database()`. If you have the time, I would look in autojump.bash.\n\nIn the bash wrapper, `PROMPT_COMMAND` is essentially set to a beefed up version of `autojump_add_to_database`, so I'm curious as to why it causes lag in certain cases, but not when called explicitly.\n\nOops, sorry for the wrong label. I saw linguistics and naturally thought of NLP. Ironic since my wife has a masters in linguistics. I took Mooney's info retrieval class a while back, great professor.\n. Closed due to inactivity.\n. Thanks for the commit!\n. No you haven't. Truth be told, `jumpapplet` was written 4 years ago and hasn't been updated since, so it has experienced significant bit rot.\n\nI'm looking at `git blame` for the file and it should have been broken as of 6+ months ago, but the fact that we receive no reports means it's unlikely anyone is using it. There are better application launchers for both Linux (Gnome Do, Unity Dash) and Mac (Quicksilver), or built-in (Windows 7, gnome-shell) so this is a redundant feature in a crowded space.\n\nI'm going to go ahead and remove it.\n. `jumpapplet` removed in 4ce2cb5929.\n. Closed as not an autojump bug, refer to this [comment](https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/32669#comment104483).\n. The installer script doesn't touch modify user's environmental settings due to Debian policy (and the fact that each distro is different). If that's not an issue for Arch, please go ahead and do it.\n. Hmm, which of these commands work and which of these fail?\n\n```\n$ source /usr/local/Cellar/autojump/21.3.0/etc/autojump.sh\n$ zsh /usr/local/Cellar/autojump/21.3.0/etc/autojump.sh\n$ source /usr/local/Cellar/autojump/21.3.0/etc/autojump.zsh\n```\n\nWhat's the output from these commands?\n\n```\n$ echo ${SHELL}\n$ echo ${SHELL} | awk -F/ '{ print $NF }'\n```\n. Try taking out all the oh-my-zsh stuff, create a new terminal and check `$SHELL` again. If it's set, then it's oh-my-zsh's problem.\n\nIf it's not, you can always cheat and set it yourself in `~/.zhsrc` before calling autojump.\n. Thanks @jsliang.\n\nI was thinking about this exact feature during the past week; guess I wasn't the only one!\n. Sorry it's kind of buried in the documentation, but zsh autocompletion requires [additional configuration](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/#additional-configuration).\n. It may be a bug. I don't have time right now but I'll look into it further when I can.\n. You need to add the `autoload -U compinit && compinit` line after loading autojump to get zsh tab completion working.\n. Possibly, but when I rolled back and installed that version I didn't get tab completion back.\n. Ok, it should work for sure now. T_T\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks for catching that.\n. Thanks again!\n. Thanks for all the patches so far. :D\n. Sounds like a good idea.\n. Off the top of my head I'm not sure how autocomplete for `jc` and `jco` would work. Say you had a directory `/foo/bar/baz` and typed in `jc fo ba`. How would you know which element to autocomplete?\n. Just a follow up, this isn't a bad idea but to be honest it's a lot of work. If you or someone else decides to implement this I'd be more than happy to merge the pull request.\n. I don't use Sublime, but if you get around to writing the plugin feel free to update this issue with the repo / plugin link and I'll add it to documentation.\n. Sounds good, looking forward to it. :D\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks @andreineculau and @xuhdev.\n. I haven't forgotten about this pull request but currently don't have time to test the changes.\n. Unfortunately I can't merge this because it introduces a few regression bugs, and ignores the same lines in the zsh version.\n\nAlso, `--bash` and `--zsh` was taken out because installation now installs both versions, and sourcing `autojump.sh` will determine which version to run at runtime depending on `$SHELL`.\n. Closing due to inactivity, feel free to recomment / reopen.\n. Thanks!\n. Unfortunately I can't merge this. Keeping both the relative and absolute path in the database is intentional as many users prefer to use relative paths over absolute ones. If you only use absolute paths, they get cd'ed into those when using autojump.\n\nUsually this is because users are using symlinks to a long path name and prefer the shorter name.\n. The Homebrew formula was updated recently, can you guys reinstall and see if you're having the same problems?\n. Just to clarify there has always been multiple wrapper shell files (`autojump.bash`, `autojump.zsh`, etc). However `autojump.sh` is supposed to be intelligently figure out which shell you're actually using and load the right file.\n\n@jbranchaud: The behavior of `autojump.sh` has changed relatively recently. If you're unable to load correctly with `autojump.sh`, could you open a ticket with the version of autojump you're using?\n. You shouldn't have to. Your .bashrc should source autojump.sh, which sources autojump.bash or .zsh depending on your shell. `jc` is defined in both of those files.\n\nCan you run a quick `autojump --version` and `echo $SHELL` please?\n. `jc` was added in v21.3.0.\n. No problem, glad everything worked out.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks.\n. Sounds like a good idea, as the current `j` just jumps to the most heavily weighted entry that's not the current directory. Also seems to solve #146 as well.\n. Well autojump is already stateful with all the side effects being stored in the database.\n\nAnother option is to treat the last directory of the current path as the directory to rotate on. That means rotating between `~/a/foo` and `~/b/foo` is fine, but once they move to another directory it'll mess things up.\n. Do you think `j` should bounce between the top 2 `foo` entries or rotate through all `foo` entries?\n. After further thought, I'm not inclined to make autojump stateful. It may be confusing to users why `j` behaves differently every time it's called.\n\nI think tab completion will probably solve your usage case.\n. Thanks for catching that!\n. Nice catch, thanks!\n. Thanks for the report!\n. Not sure, is `$SHELL` set in the first case? That's how `autojump.sh` determines which version to load at runtime.\n. Closing as duplicate of #196.\n. I'll keep it in mind. I increment the version number fairly regularly and tag once a version is \"stable\".\n. Could you provide more info as to what's broken? Also what version are you on?\n. Closed due to inactivity.\n. Thanks for catching this, fixed in latest commit.\n. Do you have a missing or empty autojump, or are just some entries missing?\n. Are you able to reproduce it consistently? If so, can you list the reproduction steps?\n. What version are you running? How did you install it?\n. I'm closing this issue since autojump has been basically rewritten from scratch since this issue's original date.\n\nIf you can reproduce this error on v22.0 (master HEAD) then please reopen.\n. I have a pretty good idea of the root cause, let's consolidate conversation to #391.\n. Traveling at the moment, but I'll test and merge your commit once I can.\n. I've updated the install script to support fish in the [fish_support branch](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/tree/fish_support), however there are a few problems.\n1. autojump sources `autojump.sh` to find the shell and figure out which version to run. Fish can't source this file properly.\n2. I'm unable to source `autojump.fish` as well:\n   \n   ```\n   ting@noa ~/c/autojump> . ~/.autojump/etc/profile.d/autojump.fish \n   fish: Unknown command \u201cexport\u201d\n   /home/ting/.autojump/etc/profile.d/autojump.fish (line 16):     export PATH ~/.autojump/bin $PATH\n                                                                   ^\n   in . (source) call of file \u201c/home/ting/.autojump/etc/profile.d/autojump.fish\u201d,\n       called on standard input,\n   ```\n. You may be right about the `.sh` wrapper, it's a holdover from old code that doesn't make a lot of sense now. It was intended to solve some issue in the past, can't remember what it was though. Thoughts @joelthelion?\n. @jkuan: I moved install script to recommend the wrapper over shell specific calls a while ago, but not sure how many people install autojump via source vs package managers.\n\nI may start migrating away from the wrapper in the install script while leaving it alone to not break backwards compatibility.\n. The `.sh` wrapper is used by Homebrew as well since it ignores the install script and doesn't give a shell specific message.\n. Thanks for the patch!\n. Not exactly how you've described. Autojump does not crawl through directory structure beforehand, so you can only jump to directories you've visited before.\n\nThat being said, you can use `jc` (jump child) to jump into previously visited subdirectories of the current directory.\n. autojump uses change directory hooks ([zsh](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/blob/master/bin/autojump.zsh#L32)) or modifies `$prompt_command` ([bash](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/blob/master/bin/autojump.bash#L68)).\n. Intentional, only documentation changes between the two versions.\n. I've bumped the version and updated the Homebrew formula.\n. Thanks for the PR!\n. `jo <dir>` opens OS specific file browser.\n\n`autojump <dir>` prints the first match. If not passed any arguments, autojump prints the most frequently used directory.\n\nIf you need more information, use `autojump --stats` and any combination of awk / sed / tr / etc.\n. @nateuni: iElectric's solution will work for now. I've fixed the bug but it will take a while before the Homebrew recipe gets updated and installs the updated version. Thanks for opening up the issue!\n. FYI `j --add` (which is really just a wrapper for `autojump --add`) already exists.\n\nSo you can already do recursive adding like so:\n\n```\nfind -type d -exec autojump --add {} \\;\n```\n\nI'm not inclined to add this feature since functionality already exists unless someone can convince me why it should be built in.\n. Thanks for contributing!\n. Closing as unnecessary bloat.\n. Or [Asciinema](https://asciinema.org/).\n. Can you checkout master HEAD and reproduce this? This was fixed in b0957e50.\n\nautojump now adds directories in the background and thus should be non-blocking / no lag. There's the overhead of the subshell fork, but I don't have access to any non-SSD machines to test this.\n. Closing due to inactivity. Please reopen or create a new issue if it persists.\n. Thanks for following up @vitorgalvao!\n. The size of the database really doesn't have an impact as to performance, but this functionality already exists as `autojump --purge`. You can find more information with `man autojump` or `autojump --help`.\n. Autojump supports multiple arguments. In your example it would simply be `j mu end`.\n. I suggested this a while back but we decided not to do it.\n\nYou're better off just creating a new shell function that does what you want or modifying the `j` alias to add `ls` to the end of each jump. For example, add this to your `~/.bashrc`:\n\n``` bash\nfunction jls {\n    j ${@} && ls\n}\n```\n. GitHub came out with [Releases](https://github.com/blog/1547-release-your-software) to replace upload functionality.\n\nThe tag and resulting tarball name is up to the developer, but I'm not inclined to change the current pattern. Also the package name has always been in the URL.\n. Sorry, I don't have any spare cycles or experience with fish.\n. @uri Can you reproduce this problem with the latest version (v22)?\n. Thanks for catching that!\n. Thanks for the cleanup.\n. Relevant lines are currently illegible in man pages, but after the change markdown only looks mildly odd. Merged!\n. That sounds like a great idea. I'm a big fan of how smart casing works in vim, just never thought about implementing it in autojump.\n\nRight now you can manually set case insensitivity via an environment variable, but I'm inclined to make smart casing default behavior once implemented.\n. I've already implemented this in my [rewrite branch](https://github.com/wting/autojump/tree/rewrite/), but am looking into fixing the bash tab completion, install.sh problems, and adding unit tests before merging into the master branch.\n. Implemented in d9b205c935.\n. I was unable to reproduce this but I do have a pre-existing `autojump.txt`. I was able to install and source it just fine:\n\n``` zsh\n\u256d\u2500wting@wireless-10-145-209-229.public.utexas.edu ~  \u2039python-2.7.5\u203a\n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  brew uninstall autojump && brew update && brew install autojump                         2013.12.13 16:54:25 CST\nUninstalling /usr/local/Cellar/autojump/21.6.9...\nAlready up-to-date.\n==> Downloading https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/archive/release-v21.6.9.tar.gz\nAlready downloaded: /Library/Caches/Homebrew/autojump-21.6.9.tar.gz\n==> Caveats\nAdd the following line to your ~/.bash_profile or ~/.zshrc file (and remember\nto source the file to update your current session):\n  [[ -s `brew --prefix`/etc/autojump.sh ]] && . `brew --prefix`/etc/autojump.sh\n\nzsh completion has been installed to:\n  /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions\n==> Summary\n  /usr/local/Cellar/autojump/21.6.9: 11 files, 104K, built in 2 seconds\n\u256d\u2500wting@wireless-10-145-209-229.public.utexas.edu ~  \u2039python-2.7.5\u203a\n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  source `brew --prefix` /etc/autojump.sh                                                 2013.12.13 19:59:21 CST\n\u256d\u2500wting@wireless-10-145-209-229.public.utexas.edu ~  \u2039python-2.7.5\u203a\n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  j --version                                                                             2013.12.13 19:59:59 CST\nautojump release-v21.6.9\n\u256d\u2500wting@wireless-10-145-209-229.public.utexas.edu ~  \u2039python-2.7.5\u203a\n\u2570\u2500\u27a4                                                                                          2013.12.13 20:00:02 CST\n```\n. Thanks!\n. CentOS 6 EOL is 2020, and is currently the only system still on Python 2.6 that I'm aware of. I don't plan on supporting Python 2.6 until the end of time, so please let me know when CentOS moves to Python 2.7 please. :)\n. Thanks for bringing this up, I still need to test migration from v21.6.9.\n. Hmm, it should be handled within the app and not installation process in case someone deletes / resets their data later on. I'll look into this.\n. I can't reproduce this. I've uninstalled, removed data folder, reinstalled and the data folder gets recreated properly. I've then deleted `~/.local/share/autojump` multiple times and it always gets recreated.\n\nAre you able to reproduce this error?\n. That's odd. I've tested this on Ubuntu and OS X but can't reproduce the behavior.\n. Yeah I caught that a few hours later and fixed it in 573c1ea4.\n. Thanks.\n. Also you might want to look into using a linter (autojump has config settings for [flake8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8). It's just some minor stuff like non-multiple of 4 indents and missing spaces.\n. This is fine if you don't feel like doing it, but your shell wrapper doesn't redirect autojump errors to an errors.log file.\n. Not at all, thanks for all your work so far!\n. Thanks!\n. There's a couple issues opened for this problem, please use #297 to discuss instead.\n. Hmm, there's a check to make sure directories exist before showing that's causing this.\n. Yeah the rewritten of `find_matches()` is a lot easier to modify.\n. Closing as duplicate of #235.\n. > Same problem here, without the float error. In my case ~/.local/share/autojump/data.tmp actually doesn't exist. Should I manually create it?\n\nWhat's the exact error you get? `data.tmp` shouldn't be manually created.\n. Thanks for the stack trace. I think it _might_ be a race condition, but I won't have time to look into it until later.\n. @halilim: Thanks for the call that invokes the crash.\n\nI'm pretty sure it's a race condition when saving the database. autojump is called anytime `cd` is invoked, and in the past this was a blocking action. On slower, spinning hdds or network drives people were annoyed by this lag every time they changed directory so I made it async.\n\nHowever saving the database is a two step action to prevent data loss (save to temp file, then overwrite database with temp file). What's happening when you spam a bunch of `cd` commands at once is the multiple instances of autojump are clobbering each other.\n\nA quick fix is probably to use a `tempfile.TemporaryFile()` and copy over the existing database. This means that some directory changes may be lost during race conditions, but it's acceptable and certainly better than crashing and showing a stack trace.\n\nAnother fix is to use a semaphore with a lock file, and basically block writes until that process holds the lock. I think this process is overkill since most of the dropped writes with the above suggested implementation are from `cd` spamming. Also if autojump ever crashes in a middle of a write it could leave the system in an inconsistent state requiring user intervention to fix.\n. @halilim: Your issue should be fixed. Please try the latest commit and let me know if you still have problems.\n\n@xuhdev: I can't reproduce your issue. If it happens again please reopen this issue.\n. It should be.\n. lol yeah... that's something that would've been caught by static typing. :unamused: \n. Yeah I just added an assertion in 5ba2774ff.\n. Thanks for the report!\n. Thanks for the bug report.\n. I don't have any spare cycles right now. If you need to get autojump working, I suggest installing the stable version through `yum` or installing the latest git tag `release-v21.6.9`.\n. Can you try this again with the latest autojump?\n\nTo be honest this shouldn't be happening, as it's complaining that it can't read a line in `autojump.txt`. However if this is a clean installation then `autojump.txt` should be missing and it should never enter the relevant code block that tries to read lines from the data file.\n. You can manually do this via `autojump --purge`.\n\nThe main reason this isn't done automatically is because many users want to preserve folders from usb or network drives. Also this would require checking all database paths each time `cd` is invoked, unnecessarily lagging the system when slow IO devices are available.\n. Ubuntu gets autojump downstream from Debian, and I think it's a bit behind. Ubuntu 12.04 LTS reports v18 which is from 2011/11/18. If you want to use `jc`, I suggest you install from source from the latest [stable version](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/tree/release-v21.6.9).\n. Hmm, I just reinstalled the Homebrew version for use on OSX / zsh and can't reproduce the issue. Going back into git blame history that pipe (`|`) has been there since the beginning of the project (2009).\n\nTry temporarily emptying out your `.zshrc` except for the Homebrew autojump.sh line. Do you still get the error? Also #232 may be relevant.\n. Have you tried the almost empty `.zshrc` suggestion I mentioned earlier?\n. Please try it with an empty `.zshrc` without oh-my-zsh.\n. You have a leftover `source` line in your  `~/.bashrc` that needs to be removed.\n. Glad everything worked out.\n. What list of completions do you want without providing a needle?\n. Thanks everyone for reporting this issue / drilling down to the root cause.\n. Thanks for trying out master and reporting this. Zsh tab completion is working for me, but behavior has been changed such that you need to pass the full entry to autojump and not just the number.\n\nAre you saying that zsh tab completion for `j intent__<tab>` only produces a single `.` entry? What's the result of `j -s | grep intent | wc -l`?\n. Ubuntu gets autojump from Debian, and Debian will only release stable versions. The current version is still unstable so it probably won't get updated for a while. My suggestion is to checkout and use the GitHub version and submit tickets if you run into issues. :smiling_imp: \n. The reason autojump is not in PyPI is because the installation process requires installing shell scripts into random directories and some user setup in `.bashrc`.\n. Of course! I always try to tag releases once stable, but I guess I've forgotten to do it before the last batch of changes. In any case, I just tagged v21.7.1 and it's available as a tarball [here](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/releases).\n\nBTW thanks for maintaining autojump for distros!\n. @blueyed submitted a 27a01662a5e a few months back which should fix the issue. Can you reproduce with the latest version?\n. 5538cf7 is has been merged into master and a new version will be released once the PRs I've opened have been merged and marinated a bit.\n. If you run `j -s` do any directories get listed? Is \"C:\\github\" listed?\n. @Kazark: Directories only get added to the database after you visiting them once autojump is installed.\n\n@thegreendroid: Unfortunately I don't have a Windows machine to debug issues on, although your issue seems to be more Python 3.4 regex related. :sweat_smile:\n. You shouldn't have to, as autojump is supposed to support both Python 2.x and 3.x.\n. I'm sorry to hear about database issues. What version are you running? (`autojump -v`)\n\nI have the same settings in my `.zshrc` and they're necessary for tab completion. However you mentioned that you have it in your bash setup? Which shell are you running? (`echo $SHELL`)\n. What do you mean by losing settings? Do you have any `export AUTOJUMP_` lines in your .zshrc? Is the database completely disappearing, or are you just losing entries?\n. When you mentioned settings, I thought you were referring to various environmental variables that could be used to modify autojump. e.g. `export AUTOJUMP_IGNORE_CASE`.\n\nWhen you type `j -s | grep {folder}` does the entry come up?\n. So autojump does periodic database maintenance removing the bottom 10% if it gets too large. It's possible that the trimming is removing those entries. Maintenance has been removed in the current version of autojump.\n\nFor now, edit `~/.autojump/bin/autojump` and remove line 508: `db.maintenance()`. Entries should no longer drop off. Let me know if this does or doesn't fix your issue.\n. I assumed a user local installation, how'd you install autojump?\nOn May 17, 2014 8:57 AM, \"Chris Hough\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> hmmm.... that file does not exist on my machine?\n> \n> ## \n> \n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/issues/285#issuecomment-43391003\n> .\n.

I'm can't reproduce this. I tested v21.7.1 with Ubuntu 12.04 (13 levels deep, spinning hdd) and OSX (11 levels deep, ssd).\n\nEvery time you change directory, autojump loads the db from disk into memory, updates an entry, and writes it back to disk as a blocking action. If there was slowness I would attribute it to a large database or slow disk and it would affect all entries. I'm kind of surprised by the 8 directory deep cutoff, as that doesn't make any sense.\n\nCan you post the results of these commands please?\n\n``` shell\n$ time autojump --add /1/2/3/4/5\n$ time autojump --add /1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/0\n```\n\nFor what it's worth, adding paths is non-blocking in v22.0-alpha.\n. Yeah, I get that too since activating venvs triggers autojump. I'll have to think about how to config / add this.\n. `virtualenvwrapper` is a commonly used and it provides convenience scripts for creating / activating venvs. However venv shell functions `workon()` and `deactivate()` triggers a change to ~/.virtualenvs. Since this is done in an interactive shell, the directory changes are caught by autojump.\n. Homebrew's autojump formula uses v21.7.1 which hasn't been updated since Nov 2013. Also, your alias is breaking autojump since the actual `j()` function [does a little bit more](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/blob/release-v21.7.1/bin/autojump.zsh#L35). The autojump program itself only outputs the correct directory to jump to, but the wrapper function is the one actually changing the directory.\n. You added the alias in [13 days ago](https://github.com/callumacrae/dotfiles/commit/068201907828c6acb97f05b79e4dd89144cc628d). :neutral_face: \n. Mostly to avoid setup on @joelthelion's part and I wasn't sure if I was sticking to the tests. I've been using it to run tests on my [own fork](https://travis-ci.org/wting/autojump).\n\nWe should probably make CI testing an actual thing for this project.\n. I'm in favor of switching to py.test as well. I only used Testify out of familiarity.\n. @joelthelion: Can you enable Travis builds for autojump please?\n\nI've moved py.test migration into #300.\n. I'm in favor of 1. The original `jc()` was sort of a hacky implementation because I wasn't sure if the feature was going to be used or not. Turns out people like it enough, so we should probably do it the right way by adding a `--child` option and explicitly filtering for paths that contain `pwd` only.\n\nThe second option results in a case where people can start fuzzy matching into the middle of paths. I tend to remember and jump to the last directory of a path and assumed others used it the same way.\n\nBTW if you want to work on an issue assign yourself so we don't end up duplicating work. :+1: \n. Thanks!\n. Initialization scripts belong in `/etc/profile.d/`.\n. Superseded by #321. \n. Thanks!\n. autojump is moving over to Travis and py.test (#293) which should fix this issue.\n. This is probably something that needs to be tested and fixed, but we're all contributing on a volunteer basis and have busy schedules.\n. You don't use `autojump` directly to jump between directories; use `j` instead.\n. Hmm, this has always been the behavior. It was changed relatively recently to do this in the background now instead.\n\nWhat version are you running?\n. Can you please install the latest version from git (v22.0.0-alpha) and see if you can reproduce the behavior?\n. This repo's master is v22.x.\n. #303 is using an outdated version of autojump (v21.6.9) that blocks and adds paths to the database. The latest version (v22) is no longer blocking.\n. Follow these [instructions](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/#manual).\n. tcsh is not supported. The shell wrappers requires a `cd` hook and a couple of functions (look at `autojump.bash` as an example). I'd be happy to merge a PR if you or someone adds support.\n. Can you run `which j` please?\n. This was manually merged in c889aa013, not sure why GitHub didn't automatically close this issue.\n\nThanks for the pull request!\n. @mdlawson is the best contact for Windows / Clink questions. I don't have a Windows box. :/\n. Thanks for the PR!\n. Fixed in b4cbcc2fd.\n. This feature has been removed from autojump.\n. I'm not inclined to change this since I find the current behavior useful.\n. This is intentional. You can always use `cd` to switch to home directories quickly.\n. We suggest appending to `$PROMPT_COMMAND` if you wish to customize it, [example](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/#known-issues).\n. Version numbers should always be ascending, I'm trying to make a better effort about adhering to [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).\n. What shell and autojump version are you running? Tab completion works fine for me with v22.5.0 on zsh.. Can you try installing the version from this repo and seeing if you have the same issue?. On which distro / bash version is it not linux-gnu?\n. Thanks for the patch!\n. You can run `autojump --version` to see what version you're using. The Debian / `apt-get` version is at least 2 years out of date so I recommend using `git clone` and installing it from source.\n. Thanks for the PR!\n. Thanks for the PR!\n. I created a python directory, entered, jumped to it, etc and could not reproduce. This is not a problem with autojump, but rather your `$PYTHONPATH` is messed up.\n\n``` python\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/tempfile.py\", line 32, in \nimport io as io\nFile \"/usr/local/caffe/python/caffe/io.py\", line 2, in \nimport skimage.io\n```\n\nWhen Python tries to import io, it is importing `/usr/local/caffe/python/caffe/io.py` instead of the system library `/usr/lib/python2.7/io.py'.\n. I've fixed `modify_autojump_sh()` in fa3ff58d. Can you guys check if this is still a problem in the latest version?\n. Sorry, forgot about; done!\n. I accidentally only pushed it to my fork (which I use for dev). Just pushed it to this repo.\n. Nice catch, thanks for the PR!\n. Thanks for the detailed bug report. It should work in the latest version, but if not please comment here and I'll reopen.\n. I'd be more than happy to accept pull requests. However due to lack of time and access to a Windows I can't add support myself.\n. This must be related to xonsh hitting HackerNews front page, thanks for searching instead of opening another ticket!\n\nThat said, I'm pretty swamped these days but am happy to accept pull requests. Basically one would need to write a shell wrapper that does the following at a minimum:\n- on every directory change add it to autojump's db\n- add a `j` function\n. Thanks!\n. This sounds like a pretty good idea.\n\nI need to think about how to add the ability for people to customize program behavior. In the past I used env vars but it became unwieldy, I may just end up using a config file.\n. Thanks!\n. Hey, so `README.md` is automatically generated from `docs/`. I've gone ahead and updated those docs and regenerated `README.md` in 113a84f9f0.\n\nThanks for updating the docs!\n. Try these steps and please paste the output here:\n1. Remove `autojump` from `plugins=(git osx autojump)` in `.zshrc`\n2. Close the terminal and open up another one.\n3. `cat head $(brew --prefix)/etc/profile.d/autojump.sh`\n4. `which j`\n5. `j --version`\n. `j` is just a wrapper around `autojump`. Does `mv doc.md $(autojump Markdown)` work for you?\n. So we're trying to separate two things here. `autojump` is the thing that works with input / output to find the best response. `j` is a thin wrapper around `autojump`. `j` isn't removing functionality, rather it's adding functionality for command line use.\n. Pretty sure @blueyed  meant this:\n\n> `j` is not meant to be used with $(\u2026), but **`autojump`** is.\n. Fixed in `release-v22.3.0` from @johannesgerer's patch.\n. @ElArtista: Thanks for the PR!\n\n@i-cant-git: Thanks for the bump!\n. Ugh, sorry I lost this PR in the noise. I'm collecting all related info in #391 \n\nClosing this not because I don't care, but trying to consolidate information. I'll see if this implementation solves the root issue.\n\nThanks for the PR!\n. The database should have been moved to `~/Library/autojump` for OSX installations.\n. Hey, thanks for opening this issue.\n\nYou can remove non-existent paths via `j --purge` (more info: `j --help` or `autojump --help`). The reason this isn't default behavior is because people use network or thumb drives that are mounted / unmounted often.\n\nIf this doesn't answer your question, please reopen this issue.\n. Sorry for the late response but I have a rough idea of what's happening and how to fix it.\n\nOn every directory change autojump locks the data file and updates an entry, stored in a \"database\" like format. There's a race condition (exacerbated by shell scripts / commands that traverse directories like `find`) where the lock fails and the db gets overwritten.\n\nThe proper way to fix is either:\n1. Fix the file locking to be race condition safe.\n2. Switch from a database like format to an append only log (like `.bash_history`, `.zsh_history`, etc), and only calculate the weights when someone invokes autojump to switch directories (aka `j`).\n. Unless there's a lot of demand for this functionality, I'm inclined to prefer users to modify the source data itself. The text file is pretty easy to understand, and trying to predict what people are trying to delete based off a search is more error prone / higher cost of failure (compared to changing directories).\n\nThis is no different than removing an entry from `~/.bash_history`.\n. Could you explain the motivation for adding multiple path support?\n\nAlso this change will require tests before it will be merged.\n. Well the Unixy thing to do is instead add this functionality into `autojump`, we should use other commands to compose the desired behavior:\n\n``` shell\n$ find . -type d -exec autojump --add {} \\;\n```\n\nAnd if you do this often enough a convenience function is simply:\n\n``` bash\nadd_subdirs_to_autojump() {\n    find $1 -type d -exec autojump --add {} \\;\n}\n```\n. Oops, thanks for finding that!. Please read the [usage](https://github.com/wting/autojump#usage) section or man pages.\n. This relates to #154, but let's keep conversation here. @turing-king: Try this:\n\n``` shell\n$ echo $SHELL\n$ which j\n$ declare -f j\n```\n. `j` should not be aliased to `autojump`, it's overriding the `j` shell function.\n. You're not supposed to use it directly, you're supposed to be using the `j` function to jump to previously visited directories.\n. Thanks for the patch!\n. Thanks!\n. What shell are you using? In Bash and zsh, `*` gets expanded before it's passed to `cd`. For example in zsh:\n\n``` zsh\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa ~ \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a\n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  mkdir \"*top\"\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa ~ \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a\n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  cd *top\ncd:cd:10: string not in pwd: Desktop\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa ~ \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a\n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  ls\nbin/  code/  Desktop/  downloads/  *top/\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa ~ \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a\n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  cd \\*top\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa ~/*top \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a\n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  ..\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa ~ \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a\n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  rm -fr \\*top\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa ~ \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a\n\u2570\u2500\u27a4\n```\n. k, I'm using zsh v4.3.17. This might be related to [glob expansion](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Expansion.html).\n\nWhat's the result of `setopt | grep glob`?\n. Even mimicking your settings I can't reproduce. I'll need to retry this with zsh v5 when I have more time:\n\n``` zsh\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa ~ \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a\n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  setopt | grep glob\nnocaseglob\nextendedglob\nkshglob\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa ~ \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a\n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  autojump *top\n.\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa ~ \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a\n\u2570\u2500\u27a4\n```\n\nBasically the `*` is not being expanded and is passed to autojump which then tries to interpret the string as a regex string but fails (since the valid regex would be `.*top`).\n. FYI the [fix](https://github.com/wting/autojump/blob/master/bin/autojump_match.py#L81) was pushed recently. If this is still a problem on non-Windows machines, please re-open.\n. Yeah... autojump doesn't C (at least not directly).\n. @najamkhn Thanks for helping out!\n\nRelated to #416.\n. @jared-hess: Never knew that about that change in later versions of Python. I guess it's a good way to make sure people don't depend on implicit sorting.\n\nDo you mind submitting a PR for that commit? Or I can go ahead and just make that change directly?\n. Thanks for getting this started and finding a better solution than manually escaping strings (#281).\n\nIt turns out the test runner was broken this entire time so I've taken the opportunity to start adding test coverage for at least the `match_*` functions. I've gotten a decent start [here](https://github.com/wting/autojump/commits/add_match_tests) and will merge the branch into master once I've finished adding tests.\n. FYI the [fix](https://github.com/wting/autojump/blob/master/bin/autojump_match.py#L81) was pushed recently. If this is still a problem on non-Windows machines, please re-open.\n. Thanks for the help @bendem! This issue constantly comes up all the time so I need to tackle it head on. I've dumped some of my thoughts on fixing it in #416.\n. Probably because it's using `echo $SHELL` to check shell.\n\nYou're more than welcome to maintain a fork that has Android terminal support, but given the small user base and incompatible customizations I'm not inclined to merge related patches.\n. A simpler invocation would be `j ebooks`.\n\n`j My eBooks` passes _two separate parameters_ to `autojump`, which is handled differently. What you probably want is `j \"My eBooks\"` to pass it as a single parameter.\n\nMultiple parameter invocation matches one parameter per node. For example given `C:\\Program Files\\Adobe\\data` you can jump that path via `j adobe data` or `j program adobe data`.\n. Thanks for the update! I've confirmed this when writing tests.\n. No, as I am pre-occupied with other things. The problem is with how [regex is splitting up Windows paths](https://github.com/wting/autojump/blob/master/bin/autojump#L277).\n\nPull requests are more than welcome though.\n. If you don't have _that_ many Unicode paths, you can fand remove the individual entry the autojump data file: `~/.local/share/autojump/autojump.txt`. If you're on OS X it's in: `~/Library/autojump/<something>`\n. Yeah, I'm pretty sure #391 is the culprit. If this happens again and/or you have more info please re-open. Thanks!\n. From the [README](https://github.com/wting/autojump#description).\n\n> Directories must be visited first before they can be jumped to.\n\nAlso run these commands:\n\n``` shell\n$ echo $SHELL\n$ which j\n$ declare -f j\n```\n. Related to #416.\n. Should be fixed in v22.3.5 from @hwartig's PR. Please re-open this issue if the bug persists.\n. Yeah, use multiple arguments as described in the [usage section](https://github.com/wting/autojump#usage). In your case it'd be `j 1 test1` (or `j project src`).\n\n> $ j temp1\n\nThe reason this doesn't work is you have to visit a directory before it's stored in the database.\n. Thanks for the PR!\n. Hey @bytor99999,\n\nThe Homebrew post install message should have included additional instructions on how to finish installing and using autojump. Please try re-installing autojump and following those instructions (unfortunately there's no easily linkable documentation at the moment).\n. Thanks, I'll make sure to improve that common alias in future versions.\n. Doh, that line needs a better debug info / better error handling.\n\nFor now the easiest way to fix that is to open `~/.local/share/autojump/autojump.txt` and remove the offending directory entry. If you have multiple Unicode paths, I'd remove all of them.\n. ^^ that should fix the problem. If you're still having problems please re-open this issue.\n. Thanks!\n. `jo` is just a wrapper around Mac's `open` command. It'll open the path with whatever is the default behavior for a folder.\n. By default `open` uses Finder for directory links. I confirmed it a few hours ago and again just now (on a new MBP). If it opens in Terminal instead, it means it's a user-local configuration and not an issue related to autojump.\n\nUnfortunately I'm not fluent enough in OSX to help further.\n. Sounds like an issue with your shell's login script or the fish post-installation message.\n. Rolling the Windows crash exceptions into #436.\n. Hey thanks for the detailed bug report!\n\nUnfortunately I don't have access to a Windows machine. Can you update [these Windows tests](https://github.com/wting/autojump/blob/master/tests/unit/autojump_match_test.py#L55) such that they reproduce the error you have? That way we can prevent future regression bugs.\n. You can mock it out for tests like so:\n\n``` python\nIn [1]: import os, mock\n\nIn [2]: os.sep\nOut[2]: '/'\n\nIn [3]: with mock.patch.object(os, 'sep', '\\\\'):\n   ...:     print(os.sep)\n   ...:     \n\\\n```\n. `autojump` is a search engine that returns a result in the form of a directory path.\n- `jo` takes that result and opens a file browser (different per OS).\n- `j` takes the result and \"jumps\" to it via `cd`\n\nIf you want to jump _and_ open a directory then it'd be: `j scottming && jo scottming`\n\nIf you do this often, you can shorten it as a shell function:\n\n``` bash\njump_and_open() {\n    j ${1} && jo ${1}\n}\n```\n. Thanks for the PR and explanation!\n. I can't reproduce this.\n\n``` bash\n\u256d\u2500@eikyo ~ \u2039python-2.7.12\u203a\n\u2570\u2500 brew install autojump                                                                                    2016.09.16 15:00:51 PDT\n==> Auto-updated Homebrew!\nUpdated Homebrew from 9fd97dd to a54c968.\nUpdated 3 taps (homebrew/core, homebrew/fuse, homebrew/versions).\n[..]\n==> Renamed Formulae\nsonar -> sonarqube\n==> Deleted Formulae\nhomebrew/versions/solr4    jing                       pyqwt                      sqsh                       yap\n\n==> Downloading https://homebrew.bintray.com/bottles/autojump-22.3.5.el_capitan.bottle.tar.gz\n######################################################################## 100.0%\n==> Pouring autojump-22.3.5.el_capitan.bottle.tar.gz\n==> Caveats\nAdd the following line to your ~/.bash_profile or ~/.zshrc file (and remember\nto source the file to update your current session):\n  [[ -s $(brew --prefix)/etc/profile.d/autojump.sh ]] && . $(brew --prefix)/etc/profile.d/autojump.sh\n\nIf you use the Fish shell then add the following line to your ~/.config/fish/config.fish:\n  [ -f /usr/local/share/autojump/autojump.fish ]; and source /usr/local/share/autojump/autojump.fish\n\nzsh completion has been installed to:\n  /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions\n==> Summary\n\ud83c\udf7a  /usr/local/Cellar/autojump/22.3.5: 19 files, 166.5K\n\u256d\u2500@eikyo ~ \u2039python-2.7.12\u203a\n\u2570\u2500 autojump --version                                                                                       2016.09.16 15:01:33 PDT\nautojump v22.3.5\n\u256d\u2500@eikyo ~ \u2039python-2.7.12\u203a\n\u2570\u2500 cd Movies                                                                                                2016.09.16 15:01:50 PDT\n\u256d\u2500@eikyo ~/Movies \u2039python-2.7.12\u203a\n\u2570\u2500 cd                                                                                                       2016.09.16 15:01:55 PDT\n\u256d\u2500@eikyo ~ \u2039python-2.7.12\u203a\n\u2570\u2500 j Movies                                                                                                 2016.09.16 15:01:55 PDT\n/Users/wting/Movies\n\u256d\u2500@eikyo ~/Movies \u2039python-2.7.12\u203a\n\u2570\u2500                                                                                                          2016.09.16 15:01:57 PDT\n```\n\nAre you using the oh-my-zsh autojump plugin?\n\nIf you're familiar with git, have you tried clone this repository and using `install.py`?\n.

Can you please reproduce these performance results with the version from GitHub (v22.3.5)?\n. > local brew_prefix=${BREW_PREFIX:-$(brew --prefix)}\n\nlol that's some fancy paremater expansion.\n\nYeah I'd love a PR! BTW thanks for doing the legwork on this and investigating.\n. Thanks for the PR!\n. FYI this was reverted in b2f243ee because it causes issues on systems that don't have Homebrew installed.\n. Unfortunately OSX doesn't support XDG spec and it's preferred to use the OSX's equivalents.\n. It's not a matter of can you do it, but rather should you do it.\n\nXDG is a standard for freedesktop.org projects, which includes GNOME, KDE, XFCE, etc. It is a Linux thing, not a BSD or OSX thing.\n\nUsing XDG spec on OSX is like creating a \"My Documents\" folder on a Linux distro.\n. Thanks for the suggestion, I would love to package autojump as a pure Python package and host it on PyPI.\n\nThe problem I have is autojump needs to add / modify shell files, which is a bit difficult to implement or test in a pure Python implementation.\n. Thanks for the PR!. Yeah, this definitely frustrates me occasionally as well.\n\nSo there's two use cases I see. One is when the first entry is incorrect and the user wants to jump again:\n\n``` bash\n[~] $ j foo\n[~/foobar] $ j foo # I'm in the wrong foo directory\n[~/project/foobar] $\n```\n\nThe other is the one you describe, muscle memory:\n\n``` bash\n[~] $ j foo\n[~/foobar] $ j foo # muscle memory\n[~/project/foobar] $ # ugh, I want to go back\n```\n\nOne quick workaround is to simply use `cd -` to jump to the previously used directory (or `-` in zsh), which I use often.\n\nLet's say we remove jumping to next best directory.\n\n``` bash\n[~] $ j foo\n[~/foobar] $ j foo\n[~/foobar] $ # Nothing happened, why?\n```\n\n^^ I think that will be confusing to people because they're running a command and nothing is happening, but it seems random and doesn't explain why. I'm not sure that would be a experience for most users.\n. I think it's a better design principle to build something that does what the user asks, rather than try and do better by anticipating the users' intent. In the last scenario, what is the user's intent?\n1. Jump to a better result. (This action is reversible.)\n2. User made a mistake, do nothing. (This action is not reversible.)\n. Thanks for letting me know! `readme.md` is actually generated from `docs/*`. As a result I've gone ahead and fixed the issue in https://github.com/wting/autojump/commit/0bf1ad5ba92bd8b6580d01424954737501efd428.. `d` is not a command provided by autojump, a built-in bash or zsh command, or a default command for OSX or Ubuntu. I'm not sure which program provides it, but running the following command on your laptop should provide more info:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ which d\r\n$ cat $(which d)\r\n```. Sounds like you already have an answer for yourself. :stuck_out_tongue: \r\n\r\nWhile it's a good idea, it's difficult to support different file managers on different OS'es.. Autojump has multi argument weighting, so you could do `j 2015 stuff` (`j 15 stuff` might work).\r\n\r\nctime or mtime as a signal might be an interesting signal for search, but that probably requires hooking into the filesystem or constantly polling files at lookup time.. Thanks for the descriptive bug report.\r\n\r\nI've fixed this in https://github.com/wting/autojump/commit/6a529f4f929042a37e7394d8c91ba31b479189a2. Let me test this locally for a while before cutting a release.. We need joelthelion to come up with a versioning scheme for this to work, since he can just manually update the version number when merging pull requests.\n. Never mind, I realize this is an issue with the default /etc/profile and not autojump itself.  I've gotten around it by just sourcing /etc/profile.d/autojump.bash directly.\n. I installed Autojump on 3x Ubuntu 10.10 servers through Github clone and install.sh as root.\n\njumpstats was aliased and working but not being updated by my `cd` commands.  I then read on Github wiki to source /etc/profile in .bashrc which allowed jumpstats to be updated properly but then led to the default non-colored prompt.\n\nI tried to duplicate this behavior just now but couldn't, as install.sh was properly adding that line into my .bashrc.  I'm not sure why the install script wasn't working before.\n. I can't duplicate this problem on my machine.\n\nHave you tried pulling down the source again and reinstalling?  You might also try commenting that line out, does your .bash_history still get overwritten?\n. At beginning ask whether to install for one user or all users (root required).\n\nAll users: install into /usr/local/bin/\nOne user: install into ~/.autojump/\n\nOn a side note, I don't have a ~/.local/share/ on Ubuntu server editions so Autojump creates empty autojump_error files in my home directory that I can't get rid of.\n. @joelthelion : I reset my fork to release-v19 and rewrote the Linux z-shell version [here](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/pull/85).\n. @joelthelion : Can you go ahead and close this issue?\n. Yeah I'm fine with that. :)\n. Continuation of @shelhamer's post from #110 since it's more appropriate here:\n\n> This raises the broader issue of ranking matches given both scores and match quality. The approx matching thread might be the place for this discussion. I'm mulling over whether or not it would ever be desirable to rank an approximate match with high scores over an exact match with almost zero score. This might be another matter of taste that could be configurable?\n\nI think exact matching should always take priority over higher weighted approximate matching. I second the exact > case insensitive > flex > approx match priority approach.\n\nI looked at the Vimeo video, and it looks like Quicksilver treats exact and flex string match results the same prioritizing higher weights. While I think that works well for Launchy / Quicksilver where the primary task is opening programs, autojump's primary task is finding directory names where acronyms are not used as much.\n. To anyone still interested in fuzzy searching, I've implemented a basic fuzzy search in d7cea406. The previous implementations have experienced bit rot, and I've been refactoring the code over the weekend.\n\nTo clarify autojump's matching priority:\n1. Try exact match.\n2. Try case insensitive match.\n3. Try fuzzy match.\n\nFuzzy matching is a last case scenario, and there are certain limitations to the current fuzzy matching implementation:\n- It is case insensitive.\n- It only matches against the end directory of any path:\n  \n  `bar` given path `/usr/bin/lib/foo/bar`\n- It returns the highest weighted entry that matches at least 60% using Python's [difflib.get_close_match()](http://docs.python.org/library/difflib.html#difflib.get_close_matches).\n  \n  It uses [SequenceMatcher](http://docs.python.org/library/difflib.html) to return a list of good enough matches. I've tested it with simple transposing / missing characters and it works well enough.\n- It does _not_ handle multiple directory matching: e.g. `j foo bar` will only use `bar` to match with.\n- It does _not_ handle acronyms or give extra priority to first character of letters: e.g. `j MIT` will not match against `~/Massachusetts Institution of Technology`\n  \n  Quicksilver-style works well when you have instant feedback as you're typing, in addition many program names are multiple words. On the other hand, autojump feedback is comparatively slow. Also, I don't think multiple word directories are prevalent except on Windows.\n\nSo basically if you accidentally misspell a long directory name (e.g. `j thisreallylongnam`), the current implementation has a good chance of finding the correct directory. However if you're using 2-3 character jumps (e.g. `j lib`) it probably won't work as you would expect since there's a high chance of getting an exact / case insensitive match.\n. I've implemented this 3 weeks ago and it has worked well enough for me over that period. As a result I'm going to go ahead and close this pull request.\n\nAs always, feel free to reopen this issue or create a new one if you have problems with approximate / fuzzy matching.\n. This has been fixed in @statik213's commit cfda2d0. To enable this setting, use the latest autojump version and set the environmental variable `export AUTOJUMP_KEEP_SYMLINKS=1` in your .bashrc or .zshrc.\n. Closed as won't fix. GNOME shell incompatibility is mentioned in documentation. \n. @daveshah: Next time can you create a new issue and link to this one rather than revive an old thread? This way the other users don't need to get unnecessarily notified.\n\nLast week when I submitted the patch to homebrew I tested it on 10.6.8 and it worked fine then. I'll retest it again once I get access to a MBP over the weekend.\n. This is most likely due to a Debian policy where we're not allowed to modify user profile files upon installation. Since Ubuntu is downstream, it's unlikely they've changed behavior back to what should be expected unless they repatched over Debian's patch.\n. @yugal: I'll need to look into it, but don't have time right now.\n\nIn the mean time you should [manually install](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/#manual-installation) autojump.\n. Yeah, I wish we could do it automatically for users but that runs afoul of Debian's guidelines. :crying_cat_face: \n. There is no easy way to catch syntax error within a Python script, this was the closest [answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/446052/python-best-way-to-check-for-python-version-in-program-that-uses-new-language-f?answertab=votes#tab-top) I could find.\n\nIt seems like the best resolution is to put a wrapper script around `autojump` that tests Python version. I'm not sure if you want to go down this route, and if not then issue can be closed.\n. The installation scripts are in bash and a pull request as already been submitted [here](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/pull/105).\n\nI'm not sure referring older releases for older Python versions is the right thing to do.\n. An incomplete zsh uninstall script got pushed to the wrong branch. I've rolled it back.\n. Yup, changes have been merged in already.\n. @shelhamer Would you mind submitting a pull request into autojump with the zsh tab completion fix?\n\nI'm testing it out and j + tab auto completion does not work in Linux with / without oh-my-zsh.\n. What version of autojump and how are you installing it?\n\nI mistakenly removed `__j` (which is needed for tab completion) and added it back in later. It's possible there's a lag in the homebrew version, but I don't have a Mac so it's not easy for me to test.\n. FYI, from [Python3UnicodeDecodeError](http://wiki.python.org/moin/Python3UnicodeDecodeError):\n\n> On UNIX (and other operating systems), it's possible to mount different file systems using different charsets. sys.getdefaultencoding() will be the same for the different file systems since this encoding is only used between Python and the Linux kernel, not between the kernel and the file system which may uses a different charset.\n\nI tried to reproduce the bug locally but couldn't, so I've requested more info in the RedHat bug report.\n. Thanks for following up on this issue.\n\nI need to set aside some time to work on it. However at the same time, I'm hoping when RedHat upgrades to a newer version of Autojump using Python 3 these Unicode related problems will _magically_ go away. One can hope...\n. Yes.\n\nRight now Autojump supports Python 2 and 3. When it detects Python 2, it applies a basic UTF wrapping around strings. The traceback from the second bug shows a problem with one of those functions (called `encode()` and `decode()`). Since Python  3 uses Unicode strings natively, I'm hoping that will solve the 2nd bug.\n\nWhat Tanguy Ortolo (Debian maintainer) did was apply a quick [patch](http://packages.debian.org/sid/autojump) to replace the first line of autojump with `#!/usr/bin/python` \u2192 `#!/usr/bin/python3` and change the respective package dependencies.\n. No problem. I hope to release v21 in a month or two. v21-rc is available right now, I've been quite busy over the past few months ([changelog](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/blob/v21-rc/ChangeLog)).\n. @tnorth: I've fixed this issue in faf0854, and commented on the RedHat bug as well.\n\nI'm closing this issue due to inactivity. If the behavior reappears please let us know (preferably here, but I'm subscribed to the RedHat bug report as well).\n. Finished in [issue 100](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/pull/100) and [issue 101](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/pull/101).\n. That was one of the first things I tried but unfortunately not.\n. Full path doesn't bother me, but that's probably because I use a [2 line prompt](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4109351/pics/gnzh-zsh-theme.png).\n\nI do have an issue with duplicate entries though, since sometimes I'll use the symlink and other times the full path and would like them weighted the same. However the fix may not be worth the hassle.\n\nWhy not just have the symlink feature available as an option with some caveats? Enable it using an environmental variable and let users worry about duplicate entries.\n. Thanks for explaining, that makes more sense.\n\nWhy not just strip the s function and submit another pull request? The zsh changes would be identical with the exception of single -> double braces.\n. @kevinburke: This has been fixed in the latest commit e96dc4c.\n\nThe problem was making sure zsh's compinit was loaded. If you prefer not to upgrade autojump, you can also fix the problem by adding this line to your ~/.zshrc: `autoload -U compinit; compinit`.\n. ZSH tab completion was not working at all before. Now it is working regardless if you have `menucomplete` enabled or not.\n\n``` console\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa ~ \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a \u2039\u203a \u2039ruby-1.9.3\u203a \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  setopt nomenucomplete\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa ~ \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a \u2039\u203a \u2039ruby-1.9.3\u203a \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  j aut<tab><tab>\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa ~ \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a \u2039\u203a \u2039ruby-1.9.3\u203a \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  j aut__<1><enter>\n/home/ting/code/autojump\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa ~/code/autojump \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a \u2039\u203a \u2039ruby-1.9.3\u203a \u2039master\u203a \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4 \n```\n\n``` console\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa ~ \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a \u2039\u203a \u2039ruby-1.9.3\u203a \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  setopt menucomplete\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa ~ \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a \u2039\u203a \u2039ruby-1.9.3\u203a \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  j aut<tab><tab>\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa ~ \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a \u2039\u203a \u2039ruby-1.9.3\u203a \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  j aut__<3><enter>\n/home/ting/.local/share/autojump\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa ~/.local/share/autojump \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a \u2039\u203a \u2039ruby-1.9.3\u203a \u2039master\u203a \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4 \n```\n\nAfter seeing the menu and making a number selection, you can <enter> to jump to the entry.

I wasn't exactly sure what your question was, glad it was just miscommunication.\n\nIn either case, I'm just glad to have fixed this long standing issue.\n. Yup.\n. I don't think there should be a reason we can't support this, but as with this and fuzzy/flex matching people are going to start having separate opinions as to preferred behavior.\n\nI think we should start implementing a way to modify autojump's behavior, either through the use of an `~/.autojumprc` or environmental variables.\n. @irrationalfab : Pull the latest commit and set the environmental variable `export AUTOJUMP_IGNORE_CASE=1`. autojump will ignore case and return the highest matching path.\n.

The installer just dumps files from the repo into `~/.autojump` after\nchecking a few environmental settings, no .so files should be there.\n\nOn Fri, Mar 23, 2012 at 7:04 PM, Joel Schaerer <\nreply@reply.github.com\n\n> wrote:\n> \n> No worries, I just find it very weird to see .so files in the autojump\n> user directory.

Thanks for the comments, I'll look into making these issues aren't present in v22.0.\n. Oh then it's primarily a documentation issue then. I mean the two places I checked (`--help` and man page) didn't contain anything about it.\n\nI've been meaning to update both for a while now when I get some free time...\n\nIn the meantime this can go on the back burner.\n. There's no need for a rewrite. Then again, there really isn't a reason not to migrate to argparse either now that optparse is deprecated as of 2.7.\n\nIf something fails, it should fail cleanly. A help message explaining missing arguments is sufficient. Take `rm` as an example:\n\n```\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa /tmp  \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  rm -v                                                                                                   2012.03.28 22:10:21 JST \nrm: missing operand\nTry `rm --help' for more information.\n```\n. Fixed in the latest commit 465ca79. The `j` function now tests the existence of the directory autojump returns before changing directories.\n. Autojump does not print out any errors if the directory does not exist. Also, `j --help` calls `autojump --help` which prints the help message and returns a 0 exit status. That makes it difficult to test against.\n\nI've updated the `j` function to print out an error message when it doesn't jump to a directory when called.\n. I just reproduced it on Arch and Ubuntu Server with the latest  commit 8decc17f3e, both running under Python v2.7.2.\n. Reading through the code, apparently jumping to the current directory is not allowed because the directory may no longer exist.\n. Thanks for the notice, the rewrite to use argparse over optparse bumped up minimum version Python version to 2.7.\n\nv20 supports v2.7+, v3.2+.\nv19 supports v2.6+, v3.0+.\nv12 supports v2.4+.\n\nI just tested v20 on my Ubuntu server with only Python 2.7.2 installed and it works fine.\n. @jkuan: Hmm, you could try upgrading Python to v2.7. It's probably better in the long run.\n\nHow should we handle this?\n1. Direct them to download and use v19.\n2. Ask users to upgrade Python to v2.7. Python site [recommendation](http://www.python.org/download/mac/) is to have users separately install Python since OS X's Python is 1-2 years behind when release anyway.\n3. Ask users to install argparse separately using `pip install`.\n4. [Bundle argparse](https://code.google.com/p/argparse/) with autojump.\n5. Roll back to use optparse instead of argparse.\n. Thanks @jkuan!\n. This is fixed in commit 8decc17f3e.\n\nDocumentation and install.sh now direct users to upgrade Python or install older versions. A -f / --force option is added to install.sh to bypass dependency checks.\n. I'm sorry to hear you're having problems. How did you install autojump?\n\nI grepped the latest commit and v19 source code, but `update_terminal_cwd` is not referenced anywhere. On my Linux machine running the latest version in bash:\n\n```\n[test@noa autojump]$ echo $PROMPT_COMMAND\n{ [[ \"$AUTOJUMP_HOME\" == \"$HOME\" ]] && (autojump -a \"$(pwd ${_PWD_ARGS})\"&)>/dev/null 2>>\"${AUTOJUMP_DATA_DIR}/.autojump_errors\";} 2>/dev/null ; printf \"\\033]0;%s@%s:%s\\007\" \"${USER}\" \"${HOSTNAME%%.*}\" \"${PWD/#$HOME/~}\"\n```\n\nAs you said, `autojump.bash` just uses whatever `$PROMPT_COMMAND` was being set to before. Is it possible you have something else modifying `$PROMPT_COMMAND`?\n. Apple Terminal adds the function `update_terminal_cwd()` to `/etc/bashrc` for updating terminal window titles.\n\nIt looks like it checks if it's inside emacs, and only runs if it is not. However your emacs is not properly setting the `$INSIDE_EMACS` environmental variable, thus trying to call `update_terminal_cwd()` when it shouldn't be.\n\nYour solution is to use a different terminal (I'd suggest [iTerm](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home)), or properly set `$INSIDE_EMACS` whenever running emacs.\n\nIf this does not resolve your issue, please feel free to reopen it.\n. If you're on 2.6, the alternative is also to use `pip install argparse`. In the long term, we're looking to stabilize autojump on 2.7 and 3+.\n\nEdit: From what I understand you're asking that autojump includes the argparse module with the program?\n. The root problem is that OS X will always ship with a minimum 1-2 year old Python version. The overwhelming Mac community recommendation is to separately install and upgrade the system's version of Python.\n\nThe problem is there is a disconnect between OS X users that use the command line a lot (autojump's target demographic) but doesn't upgrade Python (i.e. non-Python devs). I'm hoping that `pip install argparse` is a viable compromise.\n\nIt's difficult to balance backwards compatibility and continue improving autojump. While Debian is on 2.5, and OS X on 2.6, Cygwin / Linux is on 2.7 for a while now. 2.7 is also a planned \"LTS\" release as well, so I feel that should be an acceptable bare minimum target Python.\n. @blueyed: Thanks for the pull request, it's been merged!\n. Thanks for giving us a heads up.\n\nCan you reply back with the output from these two commands:\n1. `python --version`\n2. `/usr/bin/autojump --version`\n\nI'm on Arch, but will install Ubuntu 12.04 on a VM to test this out within a few days.\n. Sorry, try an `aptitude show autojump`. If aptitude doesn't exist, please use apt-get to install it.\n. Hi Philip,\n\nI had a friend run `sudo apt-get install autojump && autojump --version` on Ubuntu 12.04 and it worked fine. However he was using the distro default Python 3.2.3. I also tested release v18 under Python 2.7.3 with no problems, which leads me to think you might have a problem with your (custom?) Python installation.\n\nTry:\n\n```\n$ python\nPython 2.7.3 (default, Apr 24 2012, 00:00:54) \n[GCC 4.7.0 20120414 (prerelease)] on linux2\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> from __future__ import division, print_function\n>>> \n```\n\nIf there's any errors, then it would indicate a problem with your Python install.\n. That was modified by the package maintainer.\n\nRelease 18 uses `#!/usr/bin/env python` because autojump supports both Python 2 and 3. When you ran the `aptitude show autojump` earlier, it specified that the package depends on Python 3.\n\nI need to track down if this downstream modification was done by the Debian package maintainer or the Ubuntu package maintainer.\n\nThanks again for opening this issue.\n. @joelthelion: You're right, I've gone ahead and closed the Debian bug report.\n\nThis seems to be a localized problem to @philip's install of Python 3.\n\n```\n\u256d\u2500wting@ps95950 ~ \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a \u2039system\u203a \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  cat /etc/issue\nDebian GNU/Linux 6.0 \\n \\l\n\u256d\u2500wting@ps95950 ~ \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a \u2039system\u203a \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  python3\nPython 3.1.3 (r313:86834, Nov 28 2010, 10:01:07) \n[GCC 4.4.5] on linux2\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> from __future__ import division, print_function\n>>> \n```\n\n```\n\u256d\u2500ting@punk ~ \u2039python-2.7.2\u203a \u2039ruby-1.9.3\u203a \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  cat /etc/issue\nUbuntu 12.04 LTS \\n \\l\n\u256d\u2500ting@punk ~ \u2039python-2.7.2\u203a \u2039ruby-1.9.3\u203a \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  python3\nPython 3.2.2 (default, Sep  5 2011, 22:09:30) \n[GCC 4.6.1] on linux2\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> from __future__ import division, print_function\n>>> \n```\n\n```\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa ~ \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a \u2039ruby-1.9.3\u203a \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  uname -r\n3.3.4-1-ARCH\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa ~ \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a \u2039ruby-1.9.3\u203a \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  python3\nPython 3.2.3 (default, Apr 23 2012, 23:14:44) \n[GCC 4.7.0 20120414 (prerelease)] on linux2\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> from __future__ import division, print_function\n>>> \n```\n.

That's why your example didn't work.\n\n``` console\n~$ export AUTOJUMP_KEEP_SYMLINKS=1\n~$ mkdir testdir\n~$ ln -s testdir testdir-sym\n~$ j testdir-sym\nautojump: directory 'testdir-sym' not found\nTry `autojump --help` for more information.\n~$ j testdir\n/Users/erik.allik/testdir\n```\n\nThat last line `j testdir` should not work _unless_ you've already created the directory before and it was pre-existing in the database.\n\nAlso, what @statik213 said was correct. Let's say your database looks like this:\n\n```\n100        /testdir\n```\n\nYou create a new symlink and add it to the database:\n\n```\n100        /testdir\n10         /testdir-sym\n```\n\nIf you type `j test`, autojump will still jump to the first entry because it's weighted higher. @statik213's point was that even if you add a symlink without resetting your database, if the names are overlapping you will still visit the full path, higher weighted database entry instead of the new symlink entry.\n\nIf you want to always prioritize symlinks over full paths, your best option is to zero out the current database and start over. Simply run `> ~/.local/share/autojump.txt`.\n. ```\n~$ j foobarbaz\n/Users/erik.allik/foobarbaz\n```\n\nAs I stated before, this should never happen unless you have a pre-existing entry in your database. Autojump does not know anything about your file system until you've entered that directory.\n1. Check which version of autojump you're running: `autojump --version`\n2. Git rid of the existing autojump database: `mv ~/.local/share/autojump/ ~/`\n3. Make sure the setting is enabled: `export AUTOJUMP_KEEP_SYMLINKS=1`\n\nYou should be fine after those steps.\n. I created a new test user, downloaded and installed autojump v20, and tested symlinks. I can't reproduce your behavior:\n\n``` console\n\n[test@noa ~]$ cd ~/code/autojump/\n[test@noa autojump]$ git checkout release-v20\nNote: checking out 'release-v20'.\n[test@noa autojump]$ ./install.sh \n\nInstalling bash version of autojump to /home/test/.autojump ...\n\n\u2018icon.png\u2019 -> \u2018/home/test/.autojump/share/autojump/icon.png\u2019\n\u2018jumpapplet\u2019 -> \u2018/home/test/.autojump/bin/jumpapplet\u2019\n\u2018autojump\u2019 -> \u2018/home/test/.autojump/bin/autojump\u2019\n\u2018autojump.1\u2019 -> \u2018/home/test/.autojump/share/man/man1/autojump.1\u2019\n\u2018autojump.sh\u2019 -> \u2018/home/test/.autojump/etc/profile.d/autojump.sh\u2019\n\u2018autojump.bash\u2019 -> \u2018/home/test/.autojump/etc/profile.d/autojump.bash\u2019\n\nPlease add the line to ~/.bashrc :\n\n    [[ -f ~/.autojump/etc/profile.d/autojump.bash ]] && source ~/.autojump/etc/profile.d/autojump.bash\n\nYou need to run 'source ~/.bashrc' before you can start using autojump.\n\nTo remove autojump, run './uninstall.sh'\n\n[test@noa autojump]$ vim ~/.bashrc\n[test@noa autojump]$ source ~/.bashrc \n[test@noa autojump]$ autojump --version\nautojump release-v20\n[test@noa autojump]$ export AUTOJUMP_KEEP_SYMLINKS=1\n[test@noa autojump]$ > ~/.local/share/autojump/autoju[test@noa autojump]$ source ~/.bashrcmp.txt\n[test@noa autojump]$ cat ~/.local/share/autojump/autojump.txt\n1.0 /home/test/code/autojump\n[test@noa autojump]$ cd ~/test-sym\n[test@noa test-sym]$ cat ~/.local/share/autojump/autojump.txt\n2.0 /home/test/code/autojump\n1.0 /home/test/test-sym\n[test@noa test-sym]$ \n```\n\nMy only suggestion at this point is to wipe out autojump and it's database and start over with the latest version.\n\n``` console\n$ rm -fr ~/.autojump\n$ rm -fr ~/.local/share/autojump\n$ git clone git://github.com/joelthelion/autojump.git\n$ cd autojump\n$ ./install.sh\n$ source ~/.bashrc\n```\n. By default, autojump.bash uses `pwd -P` (physical full path) to add the directory the database. If the symlinks = 1, then it uses just regular `pwd`.\n\nWith Linux, `pwd` == `pwd -L`. Is this not the case for OS X? Unfortunately I don't use / have access to a Mac to test with.\n\nTry modifying `~/.autojump/etc/profile.d/autojump.bash` line 54 to `_PWD_ARGS=\"-L\"`. Does that solve the symlink issue?\n. ``` python\ntry:\n    current_dir = decode(os.path.realpath(os.curdir))\nexcept OSError:\n    current_dir = None\n```\n\n`current_dir` is only used to make sure the user doesn't jump into the current directory. Granted this is still a bug with symlinks, but not one that should be causing the problems in this thread. Both adding and searching the database does resolve to physical path.\n\n``` python\nclass Database:\n    def add(self, path, increment = 10):\n        \"\"\"\n        Increment existing paths or initialize new ones to 10.\n        \"\"\"\n        if path not in self.data:\n            self.data[path] = increment\n        else:\n            import math\n            self.data[path] = math.sqrt((self.data[path]**2)+(increment**2))\n        self.save()\n```\n\nIf you look up all instances of the variable `patterns`, you'll notice it's never modified to resolve to real path.\n\nIn either case, I've fixed this in the latest commit 3a7f211fb6.\n. I borrowed a friend's MBP (10.6.8) for testing.\n\n``` console\nmacbook-wlan:~ ting$ bash --version\nGNU bash, version 3.2.48(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin10.0)\nCopyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nmacbook-wlan:~ ting$ autojump --version\nautojump release-v20-9\nmacbook-wlan:~ ting$ echo $AUTOJUMP_KEEP_SYMLINKS\n1\nmacbook-wlan:~ ting$ ls -al | grep test\ndrwxr-xr-x   2 ting  staff    68 Jun  6 22:07 test\nlrwxr-xr-x   1 ting  staff     4 Jun  6 22:07 test-sym -> test\nmacbook-wlan:~ ting$ >~/.local/share/autojump/autojump.txt\nmacbook-wlan:~ ting$ j -s\nTotal key weight: 0.

Thanks for the patch!\n. @KenMacD: Using `-pcre-match` as opposed to `=~` was causing problems on my end (`error: -pcre-match not found`, zsh v4.3.17). I've modified autojump.zsh to test zsh version and use the appropriate condition. Can you pull down the latest version and confirm it works for you?\n. `[[ foo = bar ]]` isn't a substring match.\n\n``` console\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa ~ \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a \u2039\u203a \u2039ruby-1.9.3\u203a \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  zsh --version                                                                                                                1 \u21b5 2012.05.27 12:55:52 HST \nzsh 4.3.17 (x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu)\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa ~ \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a \u2039\u203a \u2039ruby-1.9.3\u203a \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  [[ ting =~ t ]] && echo 1                                                                                                        2012.05.27 12:56:20 HST \n1\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa ~ \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a \u2039\u203a \u2039ruby-1.9.3\u203a \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  [[ ting = t ]] && echo 1                                                                                                         2012.05.27 12:56:26 HST \n\u256d\u2500ting@noa ~ \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a \u2039\u203a \u2039ruby-1.9.3\u203a \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4 \n```\n\nI used the method described [here](http://stackoverflow.com/q/229551/195139) instead in the latest [commit](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/commit/1b765ab8a6d278a3737e8b94af77b33d9b2b735c). Try it out and let me see if that works for you.\n. This should be doable, I'll look into it.\n. Implemented in above commit. Please install the latest version to test it out.\n. Problem eliminated in commit f41d0fb.\n. Implementation shouldn't be difficult (add `autojump.fish` wrapper), but not a priority. You're more than welcome to add it and send a pull request.\n. Every directory you visit needs to be added to the database via a shell hook. This is done in Bash by modifying `$PROMPT_COMMAND`, and adding a function to Zsh's `preexec_functions`. I'm not sure what the fish equivalent would be.\n. Closed as duplicate of #127.\n. Thanks!\n. This a narrow use case and I'd rather not make the change.\n\nIf you are cloning the repo into ~/.autojump, can't you just modify .zshrc and add ~/.autojump/bin to the $fpath after calling autojump.zsh?\n. Unfortunately I don't have any good metrics of how people are using autojump. I only have a very rough idea from Ubuntu / Debian package popularity count and the issues that get reported.\n\nFrom what I can tell, most users install using package managers and not from source. For source users, I've tried to minimize setup / teardown as much as possible with the install / uninstall scripts.\n\nFor my dev and testing machines I just symlink everything from ~/.autojump to the source files. However other machines I just do a `git pull && ./install.sh`.\n. > I have some entries in the autojump database which match \"down\" but do not exist.\n\nMissing directories are not auto-purged because some users will mount drives temporarily (usb drives, network locations, etc).\n. Sorry for the terrible turnaround time.\n\nIt would be better if missing entries were not jumped to, but it also involves checking each entry that matches. This can cause certain lag problems (e.g. hdd's that require spin up) so I'm not sure if I should fix it or not.\n. Closed as no longer relevant in v22+.\n\n`j path__1__/totally/fake/directory<tab>` will be replaced with `j /totally/fake/directory`.\n. I'll look into this. Autojump should definitely support directories with hyphens in the middle though.\n. @JrCs: Should be working now, let me know if you still have problems.\n. Thanks for bringing this up, I didn't realize that was standard etiquette. I've gone ahead and removed it from `autojump.zsh` and updated the documentation to reflect the changes.\n\nUsers now need to manually add compinit loading to `~/.zshrc` if they want tab completion.\n. Closed as duplicate of #136, has been fixed in RC.2.\n. Can you copy paste the output from these commands please?\n\n``` console\n$ autojump --version\n$ zsh --version\n$ python --version\n$ setopt\n```\n. No problem, glad you got everything working.\n. Sorry about the long delay. I can't seem to reproduce the issue.\n\n``` bash\n[test@noa ~]$ echo $SHELL\n/bin/bash\n[test@noa ~]$ echo $PROMPT_COMMAND\n{ [[ \"$AUTOJUMP_HOME\" == \"$HOME\" ]] && (autojump -a \"$(pwd ${_PWD_ARGS})\"&)>/dev/null 2>>\"${AUTOJUMP_DATA_DIR}/.autojump_errors\";} 2>/dev/null ; printf \"\\033]0;%s@%s:%s\\007\" \"${USER}\" \"${HOSTNAME%%.*}\" \"${PWD/#$HOME/~}\"\n[test@noa ~]$ cat test.sh \n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nexit 1\n[test@noa ~]$ ./test.sh \n[test@noa ~]$ echo $?\n1\n[test@noa ~]$ \n```\n. Thanks for the explanation and the patch!\n. FYI your patch causes problems for OS X 10.8.x users so I've reversed the changes in v21.0.5.\n. Your patched worked with me on 10.6.8, so I'm not sure why other users are having problems with the same line.\n\nPlease refer to issues #159 and #160.\n. Thanks for the bug report and doing a lot of the legwork.\n\nIt's not documented anywhere, but running autojump in bash allows you to auto complete certain commands such as vim. Unfortunately you ran into a bug with this.\n\nIn my opinion, tools should do one thing well and for `autojump` that should be `cd` only. However, as @joelthelion was the one who made this commit I'll let him make the final decision.\n. Another issue is this isn't implemented in the zsh version, so now we have the additional problem of different functionality between bash and zsh version. \n. Use `export AUTOJUMP_AUTOCOMPLETE_CMDS='cp vim emacs'` in your ~/.bashrc.\n. Thanks for the patch. Unfortunately, while I believe PEP 8 is important I do not believe strict adherence is necessary.\n. I can't seem to reproduce your problem:\n\n``` zsh\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa /tmp \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a \u2039ruby-1.9.3\u203a \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  mkdir vcmcnipovpoivxzoivvcxzvcxvcxz                              2012.10.30 22:22:47 CDT \n\u256d\u2500ting@noa /tmp \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a \u2039ruby-1.9.3\u203a \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  cd vcmcnipovpoivxzoivvcxzvcxvcxz                                 2012.10.30 22:23:03 CDT \n\u256d\u2500ting@noa /tmp/vcmcnipovpoivxzoivvcxzvcxvcxz \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a \u2039ruby-1.9.3\u203a \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  ..                                                               2012.10.30 22:23:04 CDT \n\u256d\u2500ting@noa /tmp \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a \u2039ruby-1.9.3\u203a \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  j vcmcnip                                                        2012.10.30 22:23:05 CDT \n/tmp/vcmcnipovpoivxzoivvcxzvcxvcxz\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa /tmp/vcmcnipovpoivxzoivvcxzvcxvcxz \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a \u2039ruby-1.9.3\u203a \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  j vcmcnip                                                        2012.10.30 22:23:09 CDT \n/tmp/vcmcnipovpoivxzoivvcxzvcxvcxz\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa /tmp/vcmcnipovpoivxzoivvcxzvcxvcxz \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a \u2039ruby-1.9.3\u203a \n\u2570\u2500\u27a4                                                                   2012.10.30 22:23:13 CDT \n```\n\nWhat version of autojump are you using? I remember running into this problem in the past and patched it a while ago.\n. Closed because I can't reproduce and no response from OP.\n. This is due to an upstream Debian policy not to modify user's ~/.*rc files. I'll look into asking Ubuntu if they can unpatch Debian's modifications.\n. Closed as duplicate of #65 (but am still working on this issue).\n. This can be achieved by typing `j<tab><tab>`. On ZSH, you need to load the `compinit` module in your `~/.zshrc`.\n\nYou can also partially complete the menu by typing `j directory<tab><tab>`.\n. Something like that would need to be much more interactive and/or persistent. Sorry, but that's out of the scope of autojump. \n. Closed as will not implement. :(\n. Another possible method is to use multiple arguments. Say you have the following structure:\n\n```\n~/appweb\n~/dev/app\n```\n\nTo jump to the second entry, you can use `j dev a` (or something similar). However if `app` and `appweb` are in the same directory then this method doesn't work.\n. > Couldn't you look at the top entries (sorted by score) and the apply a length-based filter on them?\n\nIf the database was:\n\n```\n$ j -s\n20.0 foobar\n10.0 foo\n$ j foo\n```\n\nWhy would you want the normal behavior to return `foo` instead of `foobar`?\n\n> If there is no score property available, you may want to sort the top five(?) entries by length - but that would mix in totally unrelated entries probably.\n\nAll entries in a database have an initial score of 10.0. Also, sorting top n entries would require parsing the entire database for every search (right now it quits at first match).\n\nA better option is probably to provide an exact match option, e.g. `j (-e|--exact) foo`which only matches against same length directory names.\n. I wanted to mention that in the latest version (v21.2.0) I added `jc`. It basically restricts autojump to sub-directories of the current working directory. This may help alleviate OP's problem in certain situations.\n. Closed as `wontfix`.\n. I'll go ahead and close it, if you can reproduce it just update this issue.\n. I'll go ahead and add this into man pages for the next release.\n. Ha, I think I submitted a pull request that did this a year ago to Joel.\n\nAnyway, this is pretty easy to change on an individual basis. At these 2 lines at the end of `~/.autojump/etc/profile.d/autojump.bash` (or `.zsh`):\n\n``` shell\n    new_path=\"$(autojump $@)\"\n    if [ -d \"${new_path}\" ]; then\n        echo -e \"\\\\033[31m${new_path}\\\\033[0m\"\n        cd \"${new_path}\"\n        clear\n        ls\n    else\n        echo \"autojump: directory '${@}' not found\"\n        echo \"Try \\`autojump --help\\` for more information.\"\n        false\n    fi\n```\n. Sure that'd be fine. However I'm not sure how HomeBrew works, so when autojump gets upgraded it may overwrite your symlink.\n. Yeah there are a lot of ways to do this and a lot of ways to customize this, which is why I'd prefer this be implemented as a shell tweak.\n. That's odd, as I'm running nearly the exact configuration. What's the output of `autojump --complete` and `autojump --version`?\n. You say you checked out commit 16e0c51, but the version number for that commit is [v21-rc2](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/blob/16e0c51bae6d1ff4948d39ba57ced1b0e79bee06/bin/autojump#L37).\n\nv17 is fairly old, but I would remove autojump and try installing it again:\n\n``` zsh\n$ rm -fr ~/.autojump/\n$ git clone git://github.com/joelthelion/autojump.git /tmp/autojump/\n$ /tmp/autojump/install.sh\n$ source ~/.zshrc\n$ autojump --version\n$ autojump --complete\n```\n. I just checked out master branch, it's on v21-rc2. Run `which autojump`, you may be running a distro version.\n. First, remove it from your package manager, run the uninstall script, then try the install script:\n\n```\n$ sudo aptitude purge -y autojump\n$ git clone git://github.com/joelthelion/autojump.git\n$ sudo ./uninstall.sh\n$ ./install.sh\n$ source ~/.zshrc\n$ autojump --version\n```\n. After running `install.sh`, can you double check that `~/.autojump/etc/profile.d/autojump.zsh` exists and if so, manually source it?\n. If autojump.zsh exists, then this line in your ~/.zshrc should be sourcing the file properly: \n\n``` zsh\n [[ -s ~/.autojump/etc/profile.d/autojump.zsh ]] && source ~/.autojump/etc/profile.d/autojump.zsh\n```\n. If you can run that above command from the terminal and get autojump working, then at this point there is something wrong with your system loading `~/.zshrc` and not much I can help with. Perhaps try temporarily removing oh my zsh?\n. Thanks for the pull request!\n. Which version are you running? `autojump --version`\n\nI have inconsistent access to a Mac, so it may take me a while to track down the root cause.\n. `autojump <dir>` should always display the matching directory, but not jump to it. The `j` function is used for changing directories.\n\nAre you on bash / zsh? Does the output directory exist? Are you using a `-` when using `j`? Is there a `-` in the directory name? Can you copy / paste the terminal output?\n\nI just tested on a friend's MBP (OS 10.6.8, bash 3.2.48) with the latest github version and it worked fine in both zsh and bash.\n. @stephenluu: You're not supposed to call autojump directly, but rather source the relevant shell (e.g. [bash](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/blob/master/bin/autojump.bash)). This is setup when you run `./install.py`.\n. This was a problem with oh-my-zsh and not autojump.\n. Are you running into the same problems as #146?\n\nOr do you want to set this as default behavior? Or do you want to pass a flag to enable this option?\n. Ahh missed that, thanks. \n. Thanks for the pull request!\n. Since #159 and #160 are duplicates but that one has more users participating I'll only update that issue to prevent discussion fragmentation.\n. Thanks for the bug report.\n\nThat line was recently changed so I've reverted the line back to the original statement. I'll be updating the Homebrew formula shortly.\n. I've submitted a Homebrew [pull request](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/pull/16196) to fix this issue downstream.\n. Hi, can someone with the original problem please test JrCs's [command-prompt branch](https://github.com/JrCs/autojump/tree/command-prompt) and verifies that it doesn't cause problems?\n\nUnfortunately, I don't have access to OS 10.8 to test this myself.\n. Thanks for the rewrite.\n\nI had to modify it quite a bit to get it working for a bunch of different use cases, but it's merged into master now.\n. Thanks for the info! I've made the changes in master branch.\n. Thanks for your patch. Once someone in the original issues thread has successfully tested it I'll merge it.\n. Thanks for catching that. I've handled it further down in the switch statement instead.\n. Oops you're right. I blame the turkey. Merged your commit bcb7ffe.\n. Thanks for the patch!\n. This was removed a while back. Please refer to:\n\n``` bash\n$ autojump --help\n```\n\nOn a side note, the `j` command now accepts options so this is completely valid:\n\n``` bash\n$ j -s\n```\n. Really busy over the next 2 weeks, will look into this when I can.\n. I need some clarification.\n\n`j bundle` should always jump to `/srv/example.com/current/vendor/dotsunited/bundlefu`, regardless of the current directory.\n\nIs `j bundle__2__/home/user/.dotfiles/vim/bundle` not changing directory as expected?\n. Hmm, this was the behavior in past releases. It looks like I borked it somewhere. I'll look into fixing it.\n. I fixed this in a99183bf8b7cf322161ca42bcf4d70dbc3741673. Can you verify that it works for you?\n. > I have another issue in this context: autojump will return no results if the current directory matches, but gets skipped now (again). Also, j will return an error (because of the empty result from autojump).\n\nThis is the expected behavior if it would match. The end result is you're still in the # 1 matching directory, albeit with an error.\n. I tried reproducing it on ArchLinux but couldn't. I average 3 seconds per `cd` to a remote sshfs mount, with or without autojump. I then tested it on a LAN sshfs and still average 0-1 second per `cd` with autojump.\n\nNeed to borrow a Mac and test on a LAN sshfs mount when I get a chance.\n\nEvery time you `cd` it calls `autojump -a <directory name>` to update the database. That's probably what is causing the lag.\n\nCan you verify this by running these two lines and seeing if there's a discrepancy?\n\n``` bash\n$ autojump -a /tmp\n$ autojump -a <sshfs mount directory>\n```\n. > Another odd thing is that, when on the remote mount, even giving me back a prompt after doing a simple ls takes much longer with autojump loaded. I do a j Volumes gmm and it shows me the correct directory in red almost immediately, then stalls before giving me my prompt back.\n\nThis is the entire jump function:\n\n``` bash\nfunction j { \n    if [[ ${@} =~ ^-{1,2}.* ]]; then\n        autojump ${@}\n        return\n    fi  \n\n    new_path=\"$(autojump $@)\" # calls autojump <args> for correct directory to jump to\n    if [ -d \"${new_path}\" ]; then\n        echo -e \"\\\\033[31m${new_path}\\\\033[0m\" # print directory in red\n        cd \"${new_path}\" # switch to new directory\n    else\n        echo \"autojump: directory '${@}' not found\"\n        echo \"Try \\`autojump --help\\` for more information.\"\n        false\n    fi  \n}\n```\n\nThere should be no conceivable lag on autojump's part between the two lines, except for the time to execute `cd` (sshfs lag).\n\nCan you try these two things?\n1. With autojump loaded, run `unset PROMPT_COMMAND`. This will remove the autojump hook. Does it still lag for `cd`, `ls`, etc?\n2. Reload autojump. Unmount all sshfs. Mount `sshfs localhost:/tmp/ /home/user/tmp/`. Does it lag?\n. Run these commands:\n1. reload autojump\n2. `unset PROMPT_COMMAND`\n3. `cd /tmp/ && autojump_add_to_database`\n   Any lag?\n4. Repeat step 3 except with an sshfs mount. Any lag?\n\nI noticed you're in UT CS. I'm doing undergrad research with Shmatikov btw. :p\n. > 1. Autojump is loaded, and I j volumes gmm<TAB> (request autocompletion suggestions) for somewhere in the remote mount. Not a big deal, and understandable why it might be laggy.\n\nautojump is finding all matching directories, and then checking to make sure they exist. That last part is probably what is causing the lag for remote systems.\n\n> 1. Autojump is loaded, my pwd is somewhere in the remote mount, and bash needs to show me the prompt. Doesn't matter if I've just j'ed in, or cd'd to a subdirectory, or exited sbt -- it lags before showing prompt.\n\nThis bothers me quite a bit, as autojump should not be causing lag in this situation. From what I can tell, it's caused by something in `PROMPT_COMMAND` but not by `autojump_add_to_database()`. If you have the time, I would look in autojump.bash.\n\nIn the bash wrapper, `PROMPT_COMMAND` is essentially set to a beefed up version of `autojump_add_to_database`, so I'm curious as to why it causes lag in certain cases, but not when called explicitly.\n\nOops, sorry for the wrong label. I saw linguistics and naturally thought of NLP. Ironic since my wife has a masters in linguistics. I took Mooney's info retrieval class a while back, great professor.\n. Closed due to inactivity.\n. Thanks for the commit!\n. No you haven't. Truth be told, `jumpapplet` was written 4 years ago and hasn't been updated since, so it has experienced significant bit rot.\n\nI'm looking at `git blame` for the file and it should have been broken as of 6+ months ago, but the fact that we receive no reports means it's unlikely anyone is using it. There are better application launchers for both Linux (Gnome Do, Unity Dash) and Mac (Quicksilver), or built-in (Windows 7, gnome-shell) so this is a redundant feature in a crowded space.\n\nI'm going to go ahead and remove it.\n. `jumpapplet` removed in 4ce2cb5929.\n. Closed as not an autojump bug, refer to this [comment](https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/32669#comment104483).\n. The installer script doesn't touch modify user's environmental settings due to Debian policy (and the fact that each distro is different). If that's not an issue for Arch, please go ahead and do it.\n. Hmm, which of these commands work and which of these fail?\n\n```\n$ source /usr/local/Cellar/autojump/21.3.0/etc/autojump.sh\n$ zsh /usr/local/Cellar/autojump/21.3.0/etc/autojump.sh\n$ source /usr/local/Cellar/autojump/21.3.0/etc/autojump.zsh\n```\n\nWhat's the output from these commands?\n\n```\n$ echo ${SHELL}\n$ echo ${SHELL} | awk -F/ '{ print $NF }'\n```\n. Try taking out all the oh-my-zsh stuff, create a new terminal and check `$SHELL` again. If it's set, then it's oh-my-zsh's problem.\n\nIf it's not, you can always cheat and set it yourself in `~/.zhsrc` before calling autojump.\n. Thanks @jsliang.\n\nI was thinking about this exact feature during the past week; guess I wasn't the only one!\n. Sorry it's kind of buried in the documentation, but zsh autocompletion requires [additional configuration](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/#additional-configuration).\n. It may be a bug. I don't have time right now but I'll look into it further when I can.\n. You need to add the `autoload -U compinit && compinit` line after loading autojump to get zsh tab completion working.\n. Possibly, but when I rolled back and installed that version I didn't get tab completion back.\n. Ok, it should work for sure now. T_T\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks for catching that.\n. Thanks again!\n. Thanks for all the patches so far. :D\n. Sounds like a good idea.\n. Off the top of my head I'm not sure how autocomplete for `jc` and `jco` would work. Say you had a directory `/foo/bar/baz` and typed in `jc fo ba`. How would you know which element to autocomplete?\n. Just a follow up, this isn't a bad idea but to be honest it's a lot of work. If you or someone else decides to implement this I'd be more than happy to merge the pull request.\n. I don't use Sublime, but if you get around to writing the plugin feel free to update this issue with the repo / plugin link and I'll add it to documentation.\n. Sounds good, looking forward to it. :D\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks @andreineculau and @xuhdev.\n. I haven't forgotten about this pull request but currently don't have time to test the changes.\n. Unfortunately I can't merge this because it introduces a few regression bugs, and ignores the same lines in the zsh version.\n\nAlso, `--bash` and `--zsh` was taken out because installation now installs both versions, and sourcing `autojump.sh` will determine which version to run at runtime depending on `$SHELL`.\n. Closing due to inactivity, feel free to recomment / reopen.\n. Thanks!\n. Unfortunately I can't merge this. Keeping both the relative and absolute path in the database is intentional as many users prefer to use relative paths over absolute ones. If you only use absolute paths, they get cd'ed into those when using autojump.\n\nUsually this is because users are using symlinks to a long path name and prefer the shorter name.\n. The Homebrew formula was updated recently, can you guys reinstall and see if you're having the same problems?\n. Just to clarify there has always been multiple wrapper shell files (`autojump.bash`, `autojump.zsh`, etc). However `autojump.sh` is supposed to be intelligently figure out which shell you're actually using and load the right file.\n\n@jbranchaud: The behavior of `autojump.sh` has changed relatively recently. If you're unable to load correctly with `autojump.sh`, could you open a ticket with the version of autojump you're using?\n. You shouldn't have to. Your .bashrc should source autojump.sh, which sources autojump.bash or .zsh depending on your shell. `jc` is defined in both of those files.\n\nCan you run a quick `autojump --version` and `echo $SHELL` please?\n. `jc` was added in v21.3.0.\n. No problem, glad everything worked out.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks.\n. Sounds like a good idea, as the current `j` just jumps to the most heavily weighted entry that's not the current directory. Also seems to solve #146 as well.\n. Well autojump is already stateful with all the side effects being stored in the database.\n\nAnother option is to treat the last directory of the current path as the directory to rotate on. That means rotating between `~/a/foo` and `~/b/foo` is fine, but once they move to another directory it'll mess things up.\n. Do you think `j` should bounce between the top 2 `foo` entries or rotate through all `foo` entries?\n. After further thought, I'm not inclined to make autojump stateful. It may be confusing to users why `j` behaves differently every time it's called.\n\nI think tab completion will probably solve your usage case.\n. Thanks for catching that!\n. Nice catch, thanks!\n. Thanks for the report!\n. Not sure, is `$SHELL` set in the first case? That's how `autojump.sh` determines which version to load at runtime.\n. Closing as duplicate of #196.\n. I'll keep it in mind. I increment the version number fairly regularly and tag once a version is \"stable\".\n. Could you provide more info as to what's broken? Also what version are you on?\n. Closed due to inactivity.\n. Thanks for catching this, fixed in latest commit.\n. Do you have a missing or empty autojump, or are just some entries missing?\n. Are you able to reproduce it consistently? If so, can you list the reproduction steps?\n. What version are you running? How did you install it?\n. I'm closing this issue since autojump has been basically rewritten from scratch since this issue's original date.\n\nIf you can reproduce this error on v22.0 (master HEAD) then please reopen.\n. I have a pretty good idea of the root cause, let's consolidate conversation to #391.\n. Traveling at the moment, but I'll test and merge your commit once I can.\n. I've updated the install script to support fish in the [fish_support branch](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/tree/fish_support), however there are a few problems.\n1. autojump sources `autojump.sh` to find the shell and figure out which version to run. Fish can't source this file properly.\n2. I'm unable to source `autojump.fish` as well:\n   \n   ```\n   ting@noa ~/c/autojump> . ~/.autojump/etc/profile.d/autojump.fish \n   fish: Unknown command \u201cexport\u201d\n   /home/ting/.autojump/etc/profile.d/autojump.fish (line 16):     export PATH ~/.autojump/bin $PATH\n                                                                   ^\n   in . (source) call of file \u201c/home/ting/.autojump/etc/profile.d/autojump.fish\u201d,\n       called on standard input,\n   ```\n. You may be right about the `.sh` wrapper, it's a holdover from old code that doesn't make a lot of sense now. It was intended to solve some issue in the past, can't remember what it was though. Thoughts @joelthelion?\n. @jkuan: I moved install script to recommend the wrapper over shell specific calls a while ago, but not sure how many people install autojump via source vs package managers.\n\nI may start migrating away from the wrapper in the install script while leaving it alone to not break backwards compatibility.\n. The `.sh` wrapper is used by Homebrew as well since it ignores the install script and doesn't give a shell specific message.\n. Thanks for the patch!\n. Not exactly how you've described. Autojump does not crawl through directory structure beforehand, so you can only jump to directories you've visited before.\n\nThat being said, you can use `jc` (jump child) to jump into previously visited subdirectories of the current directory.\n. autojump uses change directory hooks ([zsh](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/blob/master/bin/autojump.zsh#L32)) or modifies `$prompt_command` ([bash](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/blob/master/bin/autojump.bash#L68)).\n. Intentional, only documentation changes between the two versions.\n. I've bumped the version and updated the Homebrew formula.\n. Thanks for the PR!\n. `jo <dir>` opens OS specific file browser.\n\n`autojump <dir>` prints the first match. If not passed any arguments, autojump prints the most frequently used directory.\n\nIf you need more information, use `autojump --stats` and any combination of awk / sed / tr / etc.\n. @nateuni: iElectric's solution will work for now. I've fixed the bug but it will take a while before the Homebrew recipe gets updated and installs the updated version. Thanks for opening up the issue!\n. FYI `j --add` (which is really just a wrapper for `autojump --add`) already exists.\n\nSo you can already do recursive adding like so:\n\n```\nfind -type d -exec autojump --add {} \\;\n```\n\nI'm not inclined to add this feature since functionality already exists unless someone can convince me why it should be built in.\n. Thanks for contributing!\n. Closing as unnecessary bloat.\n. Or [Asciinema](https://asciinema.org/).\n. Can you checkout master HEAD and reproduce this? This was fixed in b0957e50.\n\nautojump now adds directories in the background and thus should be non-blocking / no lag. There's the overhead of the subshell fork, but I don't have access to any non-SSD machines to test this.\n. Closing due to inactivity. Please reopen or create a new issue if it persists.\n. Thanks for following up @vitorgalvao!\n. The size of the database really doesn't have an impact as to performance, but this functionality already exists as `autojump --purge`. You can find more information with `man autojump` or `autojump --help`.\n. Autojump supports multiple arguments. In your example it would simply be `j mu end`.\n. I suggested this a while back but we decided not to do it.\n\nYou're better off just creating a new shell function that does what you want or modifying the `j` alias to add `ls` to the end of each jump. For example, add this to your `~/.bashrc`:\n\n``` bash\nfunction jls {\n    j ${@} && ls\n}\n```\n. GitHub came out with [Releases](https://github.com/blog/1547-release-your-software) to replace upload functionality.\n\nThe tag and resulting tarball name is up to the developer, but I'm not inclined to change the current pattern. Also the package name has always been in the URL.\n. Sorry, I don't have any spare cycles or experience with fish.\n. @uri Can you reproduce this problem with the latest version (v22)?\n. Thanks for catching that!\n. Thanks for the cleanup.\n. Relevant lines are currently illegible in man pages, but after the change markdown only looks mildly odd. Merged!\n. That sounds like a great idea. I'm a big fan of how smart casing works in vim, just never thought about implementing it in autojump.\n\nRight now you can manually set case insensitivity via an environment variable, but I'm inclined to make smart casing default behavior once implemented.\n. I've already implemented this in my [rewrite branch](https://github.com/wting/autojump/tree/rewrite/), but am looking into fixing the bash tab completion, install.sh problems, and adding unit tests before merging into the master branch.\n. Implemented in d9b205c935.\n. I was unable to reproduce this but I do have a pre-existing `autojump.txt`. I was able to install and source it just fine:\n\n``` zsh\n\u256d\u2500wting@wireless-10-145-209-229.public.utexas.edu ~  \u2039python-2.7.5\u203a\n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  brew uninstall autojump && brew update && brew install autojump                         2013.12.13 16:54:25 CST\nUninstalling /usr/local/Cellar/autojump/21.6.9...\nAlready up-to-date.\n==> Downloading https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/archive/release-v21.6.9.tar.gz\nAlready downloaded: /Library/Caches/Homebrew/autojump-21.6.9.tar.gz\n==> Caveats\nAdd the following line to your ~/.bash_profile or ~/.zshrc file (and remember\nto source the file to update your current session):\n  [[ -s `brew --prefix`/etc/autojump.sh ]] && . `brew --prefix`/etc/autojump.sh\n\nzsh completion has been installed to:\n  /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions\n==> Summary\n  /usr/local/Cellar/autojump/21.6.9: 11 files, 104K, built in 2 seconds\n\u256d\u2500wting@wireless-10-145-209-229.public.utexas.edu ~  \u2039python-2.7.5\u203a\n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  source `brew --prefix` /etc/autojump.sh                                                 2013.12.13 19:59:21 CST\n\u256d\u2500wting@wireless-10-145-209-229.public.utexas.edu ~  \u2039python-2.7.5\u203a\n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  j --version                                                                             2013.12.13 19:59:59 CST\nautojump release-v21.6.9\n\u256d\u2500wting@wireless-10-145-209-229.public.utexas.edu ~  \u2039python-2.7.5\u203a\n\u2570\u2500\u27a4                                                                                          2013.12.13 20:00:02 CST\n```\n.

Thanks for bringing this up, I still need to test migration from v21.6.9.\n. Hmm, it should be handled within the app and not installation process in case someone deletes / resets their data later on. I'll look into this.\n. I can't reproduce this. I've uninstalled, removed data folder, reinstalled and the data folder gets recreated properly. I've then deleted `~/.local/share/autojump` multiple times and it always gets recreated.\n\nAre you able to reproduce this error?\n. That's odd. I've tested this on Ubuntu and OS X but can't reproduce the behavior.\n. Yeah I caught that a few hours later and fixed it in 573c1ea4.\n. Thanks.\n. Also you might want to look into using a linter (autojump has config settings for [flake8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8). It's just some minor stuff like non-multiple of 4 indents and missing spaces.\n. This is fine if you don't feel like doing it, but your shell wrapper doesn't redirect autojump errors to an errors.log file.\n. Not at all, thanks for all your work so far!\n. Thanks!\n. There's a couple issues opened for this problem, please use #297 to discuss instead.\n. Hmm, there's a check to make sure directories exist before showing that's causing this.\n. Yeah the rewritten of `find_matches()` is a lot easier to modify.\n. Closing as duplicate of #235.\n. > Same problem here, without the float error. In my case ~/.local/share/autojump/data.tmp actually doesn't exist. Should I manually create it?\n\nWhat's the exact error you get? `data.tmp` shouldn't be manually created.\n. Thanks for the stack trace. I think it _might_ be a race condition, but I won't have time to look into it until later.\n. @halilim: Thanks for the call that invokes the crash.\n\nI'm pretty sure it's a race condition when saving the database. autojump is called anytime `cd` is invoked, and in the past this was a blocking action. On slower, spinning hdds or network drives people were annoyed by this lag every time they changed directory so I made it async.\n\nHowever saving the database is a two step action to prevent data loss (save to temp file, then overwrite database with temp file). What's happening when you spam a bunch of `cd` commands at once is the multiple instances of autojump are clobbering each other.\n\nA quick fix is probably to use a `tempfile.TemporaryFile()` and copy over the existing database. This means that some directory changes may be lost during race conditions, but it's acceptable and certainly better than crashing and showing a stack trace.\n\nAnother fix is to use a semaphore with a lock file, and basically block writes until that process holds the lock. I think this process is overkill since most of the dropped writes with the above suggested implementation are from `cd` spamming. Also if autojump ever crashes in a middle of a write it could leave the system in an inconsistent state requiring user intervention to fix.\n. @halilim: Your issue should be fixed. Please try the latest commit and let me know if you still have problems.\n\n@xuhdev: I can't reproduce your issue. If it happens again please reopen this issue.\n. It should be.\n. lol yeah... that's something that would've been caught by static typing. :unamused: \n. Yeah I just added an assertion in 5ba2774ff.\n. Thanks for the report!\n. Thanks for the bug report.\n. I don't have any spare cycles right now. If you need to get autojump working, I suggest installing the stable version through `yum` or installing the latest git tag `release-v21.6.9`.\n. Can you try this again with the latest autojump?\n\nTo be honest this shouldn't be happening, as it's complaining that it can't read a line in `autojump.txt`. However if this is a clean installation then `autojump.txt` should be missing and it should never enter the relevant code block that tries to read lines from the data file.\n. You can manually do this via `autojump --purge`.\n\nThe main reason this isn't done automatically is because many users want to preserve folders from usb or network drives. Also this would require checking all database paths each time `cd` is invoked, unnecessarily lagging the system when slow IO devices are available.\n. Ubuntu gets autojump downstream from Debian, and I think it's a bit behind. Ubuntu 12.04 LTS reports v18 which is from 2011/11/18. If you want to use `jc`, I suggest you install from source from the latest [stable version](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/tree/release-v21.6.9).\n. Hmm, I just reinstalled the Homebrew version for use on OSX / zsh and can't reproduce the issue. Going back into git blame history that pipe (`|`) has been there since the beginning of the project (2009).\n\nTry temporarily emptying out your `.zshrc` except for the Homebrew autojump.sh line. Do you still get the error? Also #232 may be relevant.\n. Have you tried the almost empty `.zshrc` suggestion I mentioned earlier?\n. Please try it with an empty `.zshrc` without oh-my-zsh.\n. You have a leftover `source` line in your  `~/.bashrc` that needs to be removed.\n. Glad everything worked out.\n. What list of completions do you want without providing a needle?\n. Thanks everyone for reporting this issue / drilling down to the root cause.\n. Thanks for trying out master and reporting this. Zsh tab completion is working for me, but behavior has been changed such that you need to pass the full entry to autojump and not just the number.\n\nAre you saying that zsh tab completion for `j intent__<tab>` only produces a single `.` entry? What's the result of `j -s | grep intent | wc -l`?\n. Ubuntu gets autojump from Debian, and Debian will only release stable versions. The current version is still unstable so it probably won't get updated for a while. My suggestion is to checkout and use the GitHub version and submit tickets if you run into issues. :smiling_imp: \n. The reason autojump is not in PyPI is because the installation process requires installing shell scripts into random directories and some user setup in `.bashrc`.\n. Of course! I always try to tag releases once stable, but I guess I've forgotten to do it before the last batch of changes. In any case, I just tagged v21.7.1 and it's available as a tarball [here](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/releases).\n\nBTW thanks for maintaining autojump for distros!\n. @blueyed submitted a 27a01662a5e a few months back which should fix the issue. Can you reproduce with the latest version?\n. 5538cf7 is has been merged into master and a new version will be released once the PRs I've opened have been merged and marinated a bit.\n. If you run `j -s` do any directories get listed? Is \"C:\\github\" listed?\n. @Kazark: Directories only get added to the database after you visiting them once autojump is installed.\n\n@thegreendroid: Unfortunately I don't have a Windows machine to debug issues on, although your issue seems to be more Python 3.4 regex related. :sweat_smile:\n. You shouldn't have to, as autojump is supposed to support both Python 2.x and 3.x.\n. I'm sorry to hear about database issues. What version are you running? (`autojump -v`)\n\nI have the same settings in my `.zshrc` and they're necessary for tab completion. However you mentioned that you have it in your bash setup? Which shell are you running? (`echo $SHELL`)\n. What do you mean by losing settings? Do you have any `export AUTOJUMP_` lines in your .zshrc? Is the database completely disappearing, or are you just losing entries?\n. When you mentioned settings, I thought you were referring to various environmental variables that could be used to modify autojump. e.g. `export AUTOJUMP_IGNORE_CASE`.\n\nWhen you type `j -s | grep {folder}` does the entry come up?\n. So autojump does periodic database maintenance removing the bottom 10% if it gets too large. It's possible that the trimming is removing those entries. Maintenance has been removed in the current version of autojump.\n\nFor now, edit `~/.autojump/bin/autojump` and remove line 508: `db.maintenance()`. Entries should no longer drop off. Let me know if this does or doesn't fix your issue.\n. I assumed a user local installation, how'd you install autojump?\nOn May 17, 2014 8:57 AM, \"Chris Hough\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> hmmm.... that file does not exist on my machine?\n> \n> ## \n> \n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/issues/285#issuecomment-43391003\n> .\n.

I'm can't reproduce this. I tested v21.7.1 with Ubuntu 12.04 (13 levels deep, spinning hdd) and OSX (11 levels deep, ssd).\n\nEvery time you change directory, autojump loads the db from disk into memory, updates an entry, and writes it back to disk as a blocking action. If there was slowness I would attribute it to a large database or slow disk and it would affect all entries. I'm kind of surprised by the 8 directory deep cutoff, as that doesn't make any sense.\n\nCan you post the results of these commands please?\n\n``` shell\n$ time autojump --add /1/2/3/4/5\n$ time autojump --add /1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/0\n```\n\nFor what it's worth, adding paths is non-blocking in v22.0-alpha.\n. Yeah, I get that too since activating venvs triggers autojump. I'll have to think about how to config / add this.\n. `virtualenvwrapper` is a commonly used and it provides convenience scripts for creating / activating venvs. However venv shell functions `workon()` and `deactivate()` triggers a change to ~/.virtualenvs. Since this is done in an interactive shell, the directory changes are caught by autojump.\n. Homebrew's autojump formula uses v21.7.1 which hasn't been updated since Nov 2013. Also, your alias is breaking autojump since the actual `j()` function [does a little bit more](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/blob/release-v21.7.1/bin/autojump.zsh#L35). The autojump program itself only outputs the correct directory to jump to, but the wrapper function is the one actually changing the directory.\n. You added the alias in [13 days ago](https://github.com/callumacrae/dotfiles/commit/068201907828c6acb97f05b79e4dd89144cc628d). :neutral_face: \n. Mostly to avoid setup on @joelthelion's part and I wasn't sure if I was sticking to the tests. I've been using it to run tests on my [own fork](https://travis-ci.org/wting/autojump).\n\nWe should probably make CI testing an actual thing for this project.\n. I'm in favor of switching to py.test as well. I only used Testify out of familiarity.\n. @joelthelion: Can you enable Travis builds for autojump please?\n\nI've moved py.test migration into #300.\n. I'm in favor of 1. The original `jc()` was sort of a hacky implementation because I wasn't sure if the feature was going to be used or not. Turns out people like it enough, so we should probably do it the right way by adding a `--child` option and explicitly filtering for paths that contain `pwd` only.\n\nThe second option results in a case where people can start fuzzy matching into the middle of paths. I tend to remember and jump to the last directory of a path and assumed others used it the same way.\n\nBTW if you want to work on an issue assign yourself so we don't end up duplicating work. :+1: \n. Thanks!\n. Initialization scripts belong in `/etc/profile.d/`.\n. Superseded by #321. \n. Thanks!\n. autojump is moving over to Travis and py.test (#293) which should fix this issue.\n. This is probably something that needs to be tested and fixed, but we're all contributing on a volunteer basis and have busy schedules.\n. You don't use `autojump` directly to jump between directories; use `j` instead.\n. Hmm, this has always been the behavior. It was changed relatively recently to do this in the background now instead.\n\nWhat version are you running?\n. Can you please install the latest version from git (v22.0.0-alpha) and see if you can reproduce the behavior?\n. This repo's master is v22.x.\n. #303 is using an outdated version of autojump (v21.6.9) that blocks and adds paths to the database. The latest version (v22) is no longer blocking.\n. Follow these [instructions](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/#manual).\n. tcsh is not supported. The shell wrappers requires a `cd` hook and a couple of functions (look at `autojump.bash` as an example). I'd be happy to merge a PR if you or someone adds support.\n. Can you run `which j` please?\n. This was manually merged in c889aa013, not sure why GitHub didn't automatically close this issue.\n\nThanks for the pull request!\n. @mdlawson is the best contact for Windows / Clink questions. I don't have a Windows box. :/\n. Thanks for the PR!\n. Fixed in b4cbcc2fd.\n. This feature has been removed from autojump.\n. I'm not inclined to change this since I find the current behavior useful.\n. This is intentional. You can always use `cd` to switch to home directories quickly.\n. We suggest appending to `$PROMPT_COMMAND` if you wish to customize it, [example](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/#known-issues).\n. Version numbers should always be ascending, I'm trying to make a better effort about adhering to [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).\n. What shell and autojump version are you running? Tab completion works fine for me with v22.5.0 on zsh.. Can you try installing the version from this repo and seeing if you have the same issue?. On which distro / bash version is it not linux-gnu?\n. Thanks for the patch!\n. You can run `autojump --version` to see what version you're using. The Debian / `apt-get` version is at least 2 years out of date so I recommend using `git clone` and installing it from source.\n. Thanks for the PR!\n. Thanks for the PR!\n. I created a python directory, entered, jumped to it, etc and could not reproduce. This is not a problem with autojump, but rather your `$PYTHONPATH` is messed up.\n\n``` python\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/tempfile.py\", line 32, in \nimport io as io\nFile \"/usr/local/caffe/python/caffe/io.py\", line 2, in \nimport skimage.io\n```\n\nWhen Python tries to import io, it is importing `/usr/local/caffe/python/caffe/io.py` instead of the system library `/usr/lib/python2.7/io.py'.\n. I've fixed `modify_autojump_sh()` in fa3ff58d. Can you guys check if this is still a problem in the latest version?\n. Sorry, forgot about; done!\n. I accidentally only pushed it to my fork (which I use for dev). Just pushed it to this repo.\n. Nice catch, thanks for the PR!\n. Thanks for the detailed bug report. It should work in the latest version, but if not please comment here and I'll reopen.\n. I'd be more than happy to accept pull requests. However due to lack of time and access to a Windows I can't add support myself.\n. This must be related to xonsh hitting HackerNews front page, thanks for searching instead of opening another ticket!\n\nThat said, I'm pretty swamped these days but am happy to accept pull requests. Basically one would need to write a shell wrapper that does the following at a minimum:\n- on every directory change add it to autojump's db\n- add a `j` function\n. Thanks!\n. This sounds like a pretty good idea.\n\nI need to think about how to add the ability for people to customize program behavior. In the past I used env vars but it became unwieldy, I may just end up using a config file.\n. Thanks!\n. Hey, so `README.md` is automatically generated from `docs/`. I've gone ahead and updated those docs and regenerated `README.md` in 113a84f9f0.\n\nThanks for updating the docs!\n. Try these steps and please paste the output here:\n1. Remove `autojump` from `plugins=(git osx autojump)` in `.zshrc`\n2. Close the terminal and open up another one.\n3. `cat head $(brew --prefix)/etc/profile.d/autojump.sh`\n4. `which j`\n5. `j --version`\n. `j` is just a wrapper around `autojump`. Does `mv doc.md $(autojump Markdown)` work for you?\n. So we're trying to separate two things here. `autojump` is the thing that works with input / output to find the best response. `j` is a thin wrapper around `autojump`. `j` isn't removing functionality, rather it's adding functionality for command line use.\n. Pretty sure @blueyed  meant this:\n\n> `j` is not meant to be used with $(\u2026), but **`autojump`** is.\n. Fixed in `release-v22.3.0` from @johannesgerer's patch.\n. @ElArtista: Thanks for the PR!\n\n@i-cant-git: Thanks for the bump!\n. Ugh, sorry I lost this PR in the noise. I'm collecting all related info in #391 \n\nClosing this not because I don't care, but trying to consolidate information. I'll see if this implementation solves the root issue.\n\nThanks for the PR!\n. The database should have been moved to `~/Library/autojump` for OSX installations.\n. Hey, thanks for opening this issue.\n\nYou can remove non-existent paths via `j --purge` (more info: `j --help` or `autojump --help`). The reason this isn't default behavior is because people use network or thumb drives that are mounted / unmounted often.\n\nIf this doesn't answer your question, please reopen this issue.\n. Sorry for the late response but I have a rough idea of what's happening and how to fix it.\n\nOn every directory change autojump locks the data file and updates an entry, stored in a \"database\" like format. There's a race condition (exacerbated by shell scripts / commands that traverse directories like `find`) where the lock fails and the db gets overwritten.\n\nThe proper way to fix is either:\n1. Fix the file locking to be race condition safe.\n2. Switch from a database like format to an append only log (like `.bash_history`, `.zsh_history`, etc), and only calculate the weights when someone invokes autojump to switch directories (aka `j`).\n. Unless there's a lot of demand for this functionality, I'm inclined to prefer users to modify the source data itself. The text file is pretty easy to understand, and trying to predict what people are trying to delete based off a search is more error prone / higher cost of failure (compared to changing directories).\n\nThis is no different than removing an entry from `~/.bash_history`.\n. Could you explain the motivation for adding multiple path support?\n\nAlso this change will require tests before it will be merged.\n. Well the Unixy thing to do is instead add this functionality into `autojump`, we should use other commands to compose the desired behavior:\n\n``` shell\n$ find . -type d -exec autojump --add {} \\;\n```\n\nAnd if you do this often enough a convenience function is simply:\n\n``` bash\nadd_subdirs_to_autojump() {\n    find $1 -type d -exec autojump --add {} \\;\n}\n```\n. Oops, thanks for finding that!. Please read the [usage](https://github.com/wting/autojump#usage) section or man pages.\n. This relates to #154, but let's keep conversation here. @turing-king: Try this:\n\n``` shell\n$ echo $SHELL\n$ which j\n$ declare -f j\n```\n. `j` should not be aliased to `autojump`, it's overriding the `j` shell function.\n. You're not supposed to use it directly, you're supposed to be using the `j` function to jump to previously visited directories.\n. Thanks for the patch!\n. Thanks!\n. What shell are you using? In Bash and zsh, `*` gets expanded before it's passed to `cd`. For example in zsh:\n\n``` zsh\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa ~ \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a\n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  mkdir \"*top\"\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa ~ \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a\n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  cd *top\ncd:cd:10: string not in pwd: Desktop\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa ~ \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a\n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  ls\nbin/  code/  Desktop/  downloads/  *top/\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa ~ \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a\n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  cd \\*top\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa ~/*top \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a\n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  ..\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa ~ \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a\n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  rm -fr \\*top\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa ~ \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a\n\u2570\u2500\u27a4\n```\n. k, I'm using zsh v4.3.17. This might be related to [glob expansion](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Expansion.html).\n\nWhat's the result of `setopt | grep glob`?\n. Even mimicking your settings I can't reproduce. I'll need to retry this with zsh v5 when I have more time:\n\n``` zsh\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa ~ \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a\n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  setopt | grep glob\nnocaseglob\nextendedglob\nkshglob\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa ~ \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a\n\u2570\u2500\u27a4  autojump *top\n.\n\u256d\u2500ting@noa ~ \u2039python-2.7.3\u203a\n\u2570\u2500\u27a4\n```\n\nBasically the `*` is not being expanded and is passed to autojump which then tries to interpret the string as a regex string but fails (since the valid regex would be `.*top`).\n. FYI the [fix](https://github.com/wting/autojump/blob/master/bin/autojump_match.py#L81) was pushed recently. If this is still a problem on non-Windows machines, please re-open.\n. Yeah... autojump doesn't C (at least not directly).\n. @najamkhn Thanks for helping out!\n\nRelated to #416.\n. @jared-hess: Never knew that about that change in later versions of Python. I guess it's a good way to make sure people don't depend on implicit sorting.\n\nDo you mind submitting a PR for that commit? Or I can go ahead and just make that change directly?\n. Thanks for getting this started and finding a better solution than manually escaping strings (#281).\n\nIt turns out the test runner was broken this entire time so I've taken the opportunity to start adding test coverage for at least the `match_*` functions. I've gotten a decent start [here](https://github.com/wting/autojump/commits/add_match_tests) and will merge the branch into master once I've finished adding tests.\n. FYI the [fix](https://github.com/wting/autojump/blob/master/bin/autojump_match.py#L81) was pushed recently. If this is still a problem on non-Windows machines, please re-open.\n. Thanks for the help @bendem! This issue constantly comes up all the time so I need to tackle it head on. I've dumped some of my thoughts on fixing it in #416.\n. Probably because it's using `echo $SHELL` to check shell.\n\nYou're more than welcome to maintain a fork that has Android terminal support, but given the small user base and incompatible customizations I'm not inclined to merge related patches.\n. A simpler invocation would be `j ebooks`.\n\n`j My eBooks` passes _two separate parameters_ to `autojump`, which is handled differently. What you probably want is `j \"My eBooks\"` to pass it as a single parameter.\n\nMultiple parameter invocation matches one parameter per node. For example given `C:\\Program Files\\Adobe\\data` you can jump that path via `j adobe data` or `j program adobe data`.\n. Thanks for the update! I've confirmed this when writing tests.\n. No, as I am pre-occupied with other things. The problem is with how [regex is splitting up Windows paths](https://github.com/wting/autojump/blob/master/bin/autojump#L277).\n\nPull requests are more than welcome though.\n. If you don't have _that_ many Unicode paths, you can fand remove the individual entry the autojump data file: `~/.local/share/autojump/autojump.txt`. If you're on OS X it's in: `~/Library/autojump/<something>`\n. Yeah, I'm pretty sure #391 is the culprit. If this happens again and/or you have more info please re-open. Thanks!\n. From the [README](https://github.com/wting/autojump#description).\n\n> Directories must be visited first before they can be jumped to.\n\nAlso run these commands:\n\n``` shell\n$ echo $SHELL\n$ which j\n$ declare -f j\n```\n. Related to #416.\n. Should be fixed in v22.3.5 from @hwartig's PR. Please re-open this issue if the bug persists.\n. Yeah, use multiple arguments as described in the [usage section](https://github.com/wting/autojump#usage). In your case it'd be `j 1 test1` (or `j project src`).\n\n> $ j temp1\n\nThe reason this doesn't work is you have to visit a directory before it's stored in the database.\n. Thanks for the PR!\n. Hey @bytor99999,\n\nThe Homebrew post install message should have included additional instructions on how to finish installing and using autojump. Please try re-installing autojump and following those instructions (unfortunately there's no easily linkable documentation at the moment).\n. Thanks, I'll make sure to improve that common alias in future versions.\n. Doh, that line needs a better debug info / better error handling.\n\nFor now the easiest way to fix that is to open `~/.local/share/autojump/autojump.txt` and remove the offending directory entry. If you have multiple Unicode paths, I'd remove all of them.\n. ^^ that should fix the problem. If you're still having problems please re-open this issue.\n. Thanks!\n. `jo` is just a wrapper around Mac's `open` command. It'll open the path with whatever is the default behavior for a folder.\n. By default `open` uses Finder for directory links. I confirmed it a few hours ago and again just now (on a new MBP). If it opens in Terminal instead, it means it's a user-local configuration and not an issue related to autojump.\n\nUnfortunately I'm not fluent enough in OSX to help further.\n. Sounds like an issue with your shell's login script or the fish post-installation message.\n. Rolling the Windows crash exceptions into #436.\n. Hey thanks for the detailed bug report!\n\nUnfortunately I don't have access to a Windows machine. Can you update [these Windows tests](https://github.com/wting/autojump/blob/master/tests/unit/autojump_match_test.py#L55) such that they reproduce the error you have? That way we can prevent future regression bugs.\n. You can mock it out for tests like so:\n\n``` python\nIn [1]: import os, mock\n\nIn [2]: os.sep\nOut[2]: '/'\n\nIn [3]: with mock.patch.object(os, 'sep', '\\\\'):\n   ...:     print(os.sep)\n   ...:     \n\\\n```\n. `autojump` is a search engine that returns a result in the form of a directory path.\n- `jo` takes that result and opens a file browser (different per OS).\n- `j` takes the result and \"jumps\" to it via `cd`\n\nIf you want to jump _and_ open a directory then it'd be: `j scottming && jo scottming`\n\nIf you do this often, you can shorten it as a shell function:\n\n``` bash\njump_and_open() {\n    j ${1} && jo ${1}\n}\n```\n. Thanks for the PR and explanation!\n.

You could also put guards in like:\n\nIt looks like you're using an old version of autojump; that code was removed for [security reasons](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/04/25/13). Can you please reproduce these performance results with the version from GitHub (v22.3.5)?\n. > local brew_prefix=${BREW_PREFIX:-$(brew --prefix)}\n\nlol that's some fancy paremater expansion.\n\nYeah I'd love a PR! BTW thanks for doing the legwork on this and investigating.\n. Thanks for the PR!\n. FYI this was reverted in b2f243ee because it causes issues on systems that don't have Homebrew installed.\n. Unfortunately OSX doesn't support XDG spec and it's preferred to use the OSX's equivalents.\n. It's not a matter of can you do it, but rather should you do it.\n\nXDG is a standard for freedesktop.org projects, which includes GNOME, KDE, XFCE, etc. It is a Linux thing, not a BSD or OSX thing.\n\nUsing XDG spec on OSX is like creating a \"My Documents\" folder on a Linux distro.\n. Thanks for the suggestion, I would love to package autojump as a pure Python package and host it on PyPI.\n\nThe problem I have is autojump needs to add / modify shell files, which is a bit difficult to implement or test in a pure Python implementation.\n. Thanks for the PR!. Yeah, this definitely frustrates me occasionally as well.\n\nSo there's two use cases I see. One is when the first entry is incorrect and the user wants to jump again:\n\n``` bash\n[~] $ j foo\n[~/foobar] $ j foo # I'm in the wrong foo directory\n[~/project/foobar] $\n```\n\nThe other is the one you describe, muscle memory:\n\n``` bash\n[~] $ j foo\n[~/foobar] $ j foo # muscle memory\n[~/project/foobar] $ # ugh, I want to go back\n```\n\nOne quick workaround is to simply use `cd -` to jump to the previously used directory (or `-` in zsh), which I use often.\n\nLet's say we remove jumping to next best directory.\n\n``` bash\n[~] $ j foo\n[~/foobar] $ j foo\n[~/foobar] $ # Nothing happened, why?\n```\n\n^^ I think that will be confusing to people because they're running a command and nothing is happening, but it seems random and doesn't explain why. I'm not sure that would be a experience for most users.\n. I think it's a better design principle to build something that does what the user asks, rather than try and do better by anticipating the users' intent. In the last scenario, what is the user's intent?\n1. Jump to a better result. (This action is reversible.)\n2. User made a mistake, do nothing. (This action is not reversible.)\n. Thanks for letting me know! `readme.md` is actually generated from `docs/*`. As a result I've gone ahead and fixed the issue in https://github.com/wting/autojump/commit/0bf1ad5ba92bd8b6580d01424954737501efd428.. `d` is not a command provided by autojump, a built-in bash or zsh command, or a default command for OSX or Ubuntu. I'm not sure which program provides it, but running the following command on your laptop should provide more info:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ which d\r\n$ cat $(which d)\r\n```. Sounds like you already have an answer for yourself. :stuck_out_tongue: \r\n\r\nWhile it's a good idea, it's difficult to support different file managers on different OS'es.. Autojump has multi argument weighting, so you could do `j 2015 stuff` (`j 15 stuff` might work).\r\n\r\nctime or mtime as a signal might be an interesting signal for search, but that probably requires hooking into the filesystem or constantly polling files at lookup time.. Thanks for the descriptive bug report.\r\n\r\nI've fixed this in https://github.com/wting/autojump/commit/6a529f4f929042a37e7394d8c91ba31b479189a2.

This is more a problem of mc, which does not appear to execute aliases.\nThe same happens when trying to execute `foo` with `alias foo='echo bar'`.\n\n(I have only done a quick test using mc in mintty on Cygwin/Windows XP)\n. @wting completion is working for him, but this issue/question is about the handling/configuration of it.\n\n@kevinburke it is working the same for me: hitting 2 after completing/inserting the first option won't work: the \"2\" is meant to complete one of the possibilities and with `menucomplete` you automatically select the first item already.\n(You could undo that using `<C-x>u`)\nI am using `nomenucomplete` (default) and get the behavior you describe in the beginning.\nThe options/ambitious completions will be displayed when you press Tab a second time (after it has been completed to `j php__`). This is also when you can then use numbers, which basically only completes/selects one of the options.\n\nI don't know if there's an option to not use menucomplete, but list the possibilities right away (without having to press Tab a second time).\n. @wting if completion was working before or not depends on your zsh setup and especially if you called compinit after autojump has been added to $fpath.\n\nRegarding your 2nd example with menucomplete, the `j auto<tab><tab>` should have added the first option already when pressing Tab once and moved to the seconds option with the 2nd tab?!\nAre you saying that when you press 3 it completes the previous input, and does not accept the 2nd/selected option and inserting 3 as a new argument to \"j\"?\nThen that is likely to be a configuration thing - if you want input to be used for the current completion or if it should accept the current selection and use that as a new argument.\n. `setopt nolistambiguous` will display the list of possibilities right away, also if there is an ambitious prefix being completed first.\nThis will make `j fo<tab>` complete to `j foo__` and display the list, without having to press Tab again.\n(thanks to Mikachu in #zsh).\n. The `nolistambigious` statement was just meant for information.\n\nOtherwise your behavior appears to be like mine.. I misunderstood your `j aut<tab><tab>` => `j aut__<3><enter>` example given above.\n\nI think this issue could be closed, @kevinburke should have all the information he needs.. :)\n. And just for completeness, pressing any key while having selected a menu entry will use that selected entry and add the key as a new argument for me - this is likely the same for you.\nE.g. `j auto__<tab>` => displays menu => `<tab>` => selects first entry => `3` => accepts first entry and adds \"3\" as 2nd argument.\n. After having worked on servers much too often where only Python 2.6 is available (and the pain to install the current python release in /usr/local has not been big enough), I provide a pull request to make it work with Python 2.6 again (at least) - just by shipping argparse and using it in case it is not available otherwise.\n\nThis might have some drawbacks (verify license, being backward compatible to the shipped argparse), but OTOH being unable to use the (current) autojump release is very frustrating if you're used to it.\n\nPlease consider adopting this pull request, which would make autojump much more useful/usable for the guys maintaining old servers.. :)\n. I am also affected to this: after having run into a permission issue with the db again (after using `sudo -i`), I have upgraded autojump.\n\nBut also after moving .local/share/autojump out, it did not kept adding new directories again.\n\nFrom an strace I have seen that ~/.local/share/autojump/autojump.txt.bak is being accessed..\n\nI wonder what file/state triggers the is-an-upgrade-but-I-will-not-upgrade state.\n. I have tried using \"bin\" directly, but it did not appear to work - I then thought that zsh only considers directories which only contain \"_*\" files.\nAnyway, the symlink is a good enough workaround for me.\n\nI just wanted to bring this up, because I think there are others who like to avoid running some installer, if it is not necessary.\n. Oh.. there is something different involved: it misbehaved for a specific entry only.\n\nApart from that, it completed another entry differently:\n\n```\n% j down__2__/home/user/Downloads\n/etc/network/if-down.d\n```\n\nThis looks like the list for completion is not in sync with the list used by autojump to resolve these special entries.\n. Later, after chosing different entries from this list:\n\n```\n% j down__3__/home/user/Downloads \nautojump: directory 'down__3__/home/user/Downloads' not found\n```\n\nI have some entries in the autojump database which match \"down\" but do not exist.\n\nI guess autojump is removing them from the completion, but not from the list used for resolving \"foo__X__\" paths.\n\nAs a workaround `autojump --purge` will likely resolve this issue, but there appears to be a bug anyway.\n. I think autojump should rather use the path provided after \"**X**\", instead of looking up the database entry X anyway: otherwise the database might have changed in the background in the meantime.\n\nAssumung that the path exists that is; \"**1**\" should always get looked up from the DB, as with \"**1**/does/not/exist\". But \"**1**/tmp\" would always go to \"/tmp\", regardless of the DB.\n. > Missing directories are not auto-purged because some users will mount drives temporarily (usb drives, network locations, etc).\n\nThat makes sense, of course.\nBut while these entries are not shown in the completion list/menu, they are then used when the autojump command is called.\n\nWhat do you think about my previous comment(s), e.g. about just using the provided path?\nHow are you going to address this issue?\n. Well, not checking each entry would be fine.\n\nThe issue is that number X from the completion list is not necessarily the same number in the list of matches without the non-existing ones.\n\nAs said before, not the \"**X**\" prefix should get used for changing the directory, but the path provided afterwards.\n. This is probably dumb, but since I type it, I'll leave it anyway - I have no knowledge about the internals of autojumps list/scores:\n\nCouldn't you look at the top entries (sorted by score) and the apply a length-based filter on them?\nIf there is no score property available, you may want to sort the top five(?) entries by length - but that would mix in totally unrelated entries probably.\n. It would be great, if you could provide a testcase to reproduce this.\n\nE.g. by creating a dir like mentioned above, `cd`ing to it and then using it from autojump.\n\n(It is not that useful having to download a 512mb file - and that would just be the lesser part of the issue)\n\nI am guessing there's an infinite loop involved somewhere, where autojump might be confused about the dir not being added already, while it is.\n. Awesome, thanks!\n\nYou should update the docs accordingly, I have added a pull request for that: https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/pull/151\n. JFI: the `_j` script is only used for completion, and should not be executable.\n\nWith the current `install.py` script that does not appear to be an issue though - so this appears to got reverted (which is good).\n. Ok.\nMy understanding has been that autojump would jump to the second best directory, if the current working directory is the best match already.\nWould that make sense for a feature request then?\n. That fixed it.\nThanks!\n. Re-opening, see my comment at https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/commit/a99183bf8b7cf322161ca42bcf4d70dbc3741673#commitcomment-2324384\n. I have another issue in this context: autojump will return no results if the current directory matches, but gets skipped now (again). Also, `j` will return an error (because of the empty result from `autojump`).\n\nI think this should not get considered to be an error. What do you think?\n. Yes, it's just the error that is irritating.\n. I am closing this issue - I have opened #182 instead for the return code issue.\n. I think the stalling should be addressed/fixed with my pull request, which has been merged:\nhttps://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/pull/169\n. > Not sure if this is the correct approach, it needs another set of eyes.\n\nThis does not make sense, since e.g. `jc foo` is supposed to limit the queries to subdirectories, which is not given anymore then.\n\nRegarding your question on SO: you do not need to replace what's on the user's command line, do you? You only need to change the command used for getting completions.\n\nFWIW, i would be more interested in zsh completion for it.. ;)\n. I think it might be not too confusing (and is what I have expected).\n\nI could imagine solving this by keeping a list of least recently jumped to directories in the current shell, and skip these - until you change to another directory manually, or execute some command (which could be detected using shell hooks, if there is support for this (e.g. with Zsh)).\n. (Probably) not fixed: see my commit note: https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/commit/473c8b8daacee008e20958990d0a72811fbf8f5d#commitcomment-5041730\n. Thanks for fixing it this fast!\n. I would have expected the entry which gets chosen without `--complete` to be also the first with `--complete`.\n. I thought about adding an `assert` to the beginning of the function..\nThis apart, is there any other way to make sure a list gets passed as argument?\n\nIt seems like this issue (accidentally iterating over a string) happens much too often in Python by accident.\n. It seems there was invalid unicode data:\n\n> File \"/root/.autojump/bin/autojump_data.py\", line 68, in\n>     tupleize = lambda x: (x[1], float(x[0]))\n>     UnicodeEncodeError: 'decimal' codec can't encode characters in position 0-65: invalid decimal Unicode string\n\nIt would have been interesting to see your `autojump.txt` file / the broken entry and to find out how it ended up there.\n\nI am closing this issue for now. Feel free to re-open it in case this happens again.\n. Can you please try autojump master?\n\nIt looks like the `autojump -a` line mentioned in the error is quite old already (changed in commit 4716493).\n\nThen, if you still get an error, try to manually invoke the line that's referred to in the error.\n\nWith the original error, it might complain about `>>|`, which might indicate that it's not zsh, which is being invoked as a shell.\n\nIt's also likely that some oh-my-zsh option is interfering here, but then I am using some forked and adjusted omz myself. You could try to reproduce it using `zsh -f` (no config).\n. Like I've assumed before, it is likely that a non-zsh shell picks up this file, especially when it's in /etc/profile.d.\nIs this where ArchLinux installs it? That seems to be wrong then.\n\n@dphilpot \n\n> Still having this error when i execute a \"shell build\" command in sublime text.\n\nThis is also likely to use a non-zsh shell.\nIs it correct that you've installed autojump via `brew`?\nDoes this also add a file into `/etc/profile.d`?\n\nCan you both try `sh -i` and `bash -i` from a terminal, to see if that triggers the error?\nThen `sh -c true` and `bash -c true` might be interesting to try, too.\n. Oh, it seems autojump's install script copies all shell files into `/etc/profile.d`! (https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/blob/master/install.py#L197-L204)\n\nThis appears to be wrong and a bug with the install script/process.\nThere should only be generic, POSIX compatible scripts therein probably, and not all the files for the different flavors autojump supports.\n\nI could imagine having only a single `autojump_init.sh` script therein, which would source/use the matching script for the current shell.\n. It seems like the install script should not use `etc/profile.d` at all, but put the shell scripts (meant to be sourced) into `args.prefix, 'share', 'autojump'`, like it's done with the Debian/Ubuntu package (`/usr/share/autojump/`):\n\n> % cat /tmp/autojump-21.7.1/debian/autojump.install \n> bin/autojump      usr/bin\n> bin/autojump.bash usr/share/autojump\n> bin/autojump.zsh  usr/share/autojump\n> bin/autojump.sh   usr/share/autojump\n> bin/autojump.fish usr/share/autojump\n> bin/_j            usr/share/zsh/functions/Completion/Unix\n. FWIW, you can install it manually easily (for zsh in this case):\n1. `git clone https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump ~/.autojump`\n2. Add `source ~/.autojump/bin/autojump.zsh` to ~/.zshrc\n3. For completion, copy/symlink `~/.autojump/bin/_j` somewhere into your zsh's `fpath` (I have added a symlink in `~/.dotfiles/oh-my-zsh/functions`, which is in my `$fpath`).\n. @erbridge \nIt seems like the executable scripts `/etc/profile.d/*.sh` get sourced upon login (e.g. via LightDM on Ubuntu).\n[autojump.sh](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/blob/master/bin/autojump.sh) detects the current shell and then sources the appropriate file.\nTherefore, everything looks OK, although I still think that autojump should not install the files there.\n\nCan you provide the output of `ls -l /etc/profile.d/autojump*`, please?\nFrom the install script, `autojump.sh` shouldn't be executable.\n\nArchLinux might behave differently regarding the handling of `/etc/profile.d`.\nI assume you have installed `/etc/profile.d/autojump.zsh` manually? In your `~/.zshrc`?\n. All (but limited to the max. number of return values of course), sorted by weight (as with the others).\nIt's just as with any other completion, e.g. `cd <tab>` (usually/can) provide all entries.\n\nWhile at it, it would be nice to have an option to specify the maximum number of values to be returned (in case that's not possible already).\n. I have added a PR for this: #296.\n\nBefore merging it, I would like to get some feedback / OK on it first.\n. The scripts are executable, but the Makefile lines should have a leading `./`.\n\nFixed in https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/commit/8c7f0bf994c778d0f126977aeef8c4807ac75384.\n. Thanks for your PR!\n\nI have looked into merging it, but decided to fix it in a different way: https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/commit/27a01662a5e09118a34ce83c567aec63f1943069\n.

The error is `sre_constants.error: bogus escape: '\\\\U'`.\n\nIt probably comes from autojump incorrectly/not escaping the \"U\" in \"C:\\Users...\".\n\nFrom the Python documentation;\n\n> .. versionchanged:: 3.3\n>    The `'\\u'` and `'\\U'` escape sequences have been added.\n\nI am pushing a fix for this, please retry it with autojump master.\n.

Enjoy it :)\n\nI have pushed some fixes today, so in case you are not using Git's master, but the stable release, you might want to upgrade.\n. We should probably use py.test instead of testify.\n\nAs stated on https://github.com/Yelp/Testify, Yelp is switching to py.test themselves and recommends using it. I haven't used testify myself, but am a fan of py.test.\n\nAlso, I have just noticed that testify does not appear to work on Python 3.4.\n. @joelthelion \nPing. You would need to do step 1 and 2 of http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/.\n\nThanks!\n. @wting \nPlease see the discussion at #267.\n\nI think it would make sense to only have the `.sh` file in `/etc/profile.d`, which detects the shell (but fixed as stated in https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/issues/256#issuecomment-37501647).\n\nI am re-opening this PR to discuss it further.\n.

I am closing the issue for autojump then, there's nothing we can do if a (suffix) alias gets defined afterwards.\n. @wting \nI've amended and fixed the commit now.\n\nIt still needs a fix for fish at least though.\n. The problem is that `$new_path` is defined during the `cd` and powerline is probably using the `chpwd` hook, and you probably have the `autonamedirs` option set:\n\n```\n   AUTO_NAME_DIRS\n          Any parameter that is set to the absolute name of a directory immediately becomes a name\n          for that directory, that will be used by the `%~' and related prompt sequences, and will\n          be  available when completion is performed on a word starting with `~'.  (Otherwise, the\n          parameter must be used in the form `~param' first.)\n```\n. > I'm sure autonamedirs is turned on by oh-my-zsh or something.\n\nYes, probably. I recommend turning it off in general. I use \"hash -d\" to define short directory names explicitly.\n. This could be achieves by some extra option (and maybe an alias for it).\n\nYou could then use this option for your own alias.\n. :+1: \nShould I merge/push it to master?\n\nWhich version should be used?\n-VERSION = '22.0.2-beta'\n+VERSION = '22.1.0-beta'\n. LGTM, but I have no fish shell to test it.\n. Thanks!\n\nLGTM, but untested.\n. Yes, this would need a generic form / all variants of https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/blob/master/install.py#L139-L161 in the README.\n. @EvanDorsky \n`j` is not meant to be used with `$(\u2026)`, but `j` is.\n\nOTOH `j` could maybe detect that it is being used like that and then skip the coloring?!\n. Yeah, sorry for the confusion.\n. Can you provide a traceback and more information in general, please?\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\nThis works as expected.\n. You might be interested in the function `c` which I have created for this myself:\n\n```\nc () {\n        local prev=$PWD\n        [[ -d \"$@\" ]] && cd \"$@\" || j \"$@\"\n        [[ $PWD != $prev ]] && ls $LS_OPTIONS\n}\n```\n. This is more a problem of mc, which does not appear to execute aliases.\nThe same happens when trying to execute `foo` with `alias foo='echo bar'`.\n\n(I have only done a quick test using mc in mintty on Cygwin/Windows XP)\n. @wting completion is working for him, but this issue/question is about the handling/configuration of it.\n\n@kevinburke it is working the same for me: hitting 2 after completing/inserting the first option won't work: the \"2\" is meant to complete one of the possibilities and with `menucomplete` you automatically select the first item already.\n(You could undo that using `<C-x>u`)\nI am using `nomenucomplete` (default) and get the behavior you describe in the beginning.\nThe options/ambitious completions will be displayed when you press Tab a second time (after it has been completed to `j php__`). This is also when you can then use numbers, which basically only completes/selects one of the options.\n\nI don't know if there's an option to not use menucomplete, but list the possibilities right away (without having to press Tab a second time).\n. @wting if completion was working before or not depends on your zsh setup and especially if you called compinit after autojump has been added to $fpath.\n\nRegarding your 2nd example with menucomplete, the `j auto<tab><tab>` should have added the first option already when pressing Tab once and moved to the seconds option with the 2nd tab?!\nAre you saying that when you press 3 it completes the previous input, and does not accept the 2nd/selected option and inserting 3 as a new argument to \"j\"?\nThen that is likely to be a configuration thing - if you want input to be used for the current completion or if it should accept the current selection and use that as a new argument.\n. `setopt nolistambiguous` will display the list of possibilities right away, also if there is an ambitious prefix being completed first.\nThis will make `j fo<tab>` complete to `j foo__` and display the list, without having to press Tab again.\n(thanks to Mikachu in #zsh).\n. The `nolistambigious` statement was just meant for information.\n\nOtherwise your behavior appears to be like mine.. I misunderstood your `j aut<tab><tab>` => `j aut__<3><enter>` example given above.\n\nI think this issue could be closed, @kevinburke should have all the information he needs.. :)\n. And just for completeness, pressing any key while having selected a menu entry will use that selected entry and add the key as a new argument for me - this is likely the same for you.\nE.g. `j auto__<tab>` => displays menu => `<tab>` => selects first entry => `3` => accepts first entry and adds \"3\" as 2nd argument.\n. After having worked on servers much too often where only Python 2.6 is available (and the pain to install the current python release in /usr/local has not been big enough), I provide a pull request to make it work with Python 2.6 again (at least) - just by shipping argparse and using it in case it is not available otherwise.\n\nThis might have some drawbacks (verify license, being backward compatible to the shipped argparse), but OTOH being unable to use the (current) autojump release is very frustrating if you're used to it.\n\nPlease consider adopting this pull request, which would make autojump much more useful/usable for the guys maintaining old servers.. :)\n. I am also affected to this: after having run into a permission issue with the db again (after using `sudo -i`), I have upgraded autojump.\n\nBut also after moving .local/share/autojump out, it did not kept adding new directories again.\n\nFrom an strace I have seen that ~/.local/share/autojump/autojump.txt.bak is being accessed..\n\nI wonder what file/state triggers the is-an-upgrade-but-I-will-not-upgrade state.\n. I have tried using \"bin\" directly, but it did not appear to work - I then thought that zsh only considers directories which only contain \"_*\" files.\nAnyway, the symlink is a good enough workaround for me.\n\nI just wanted to bring this up, because I think there are others who like to avoid running some installer, if it is not necessary.\n. Oh.. there is something different involved: it misbehaved for a specific entry only.\n\nApart from that, it completed another entry differently:\n\n```\n% j down__2__/home/user/Downloads\n/etc/network/if-down.d\n```\n\nThis looks like the list for completion is not in sync with the list used by autojump to resolve these special entries.\n. Later, after chosing different entries from this list:\n\n```\n% j down__3__/home/user/Downloads \nautojump: directory 'down__3__/home/user/Downloads' not found\n```\n\nI have some entries in the autojump database which match \"down\" but do not exist.\n\nI guess autojump is removing them from the completion, but not from the list used for resolving \"foo__X__\" paths.\n\nAs a workaround `autojump --purge` will likely resolve this issue, but there appears to be a bug anyway.\n. I think autojump should rather use the path provided after \"**X**\", instead of looking up the database entry X anyway: otherwise the database might have changed in the background in the meantime.\n\nAssumung that the path exists that is; \"**1**\" should always get looked up from the DB, as with \"**1**/does/not/exist\". But \"**1**/tmp\" would always go to \"/tmp\", regardless of the DB.\n. > Missing directories are not auto-purged because some users will mount drives temporarily (usb drives, network locations, etc).\n\nThat makes sense, of course.\nBut while these entries are not shown in the completion list/menu, they are then used when the autojump command is called.\n\nWhat do you think about my previous comment(s), e.g. about just using the provided path?\nHow are you going to address this issue?\n. Well, not checking each entry would be fine.\n\nThe issue is that number X from the completion list is not necessarily the same number in the list of matches without the non-existing ones.\n\nAs said before, not the \"**X**\" prefix should get used for changing the directory, but the path provided afterwards.\n. This is probably dumb, but since I type it, I'll leave it anyway - I have no knowledge about the internals of autojumps list/scores:\n\nCouldn't you look at the top entries (sorted by score) and the apply a length-based filter on them?\nIf there is no score property available, you may want to sort the top five(?) entries by length - but that would mix in totally unrelated entries probably.\n. It would be great, if you could provide a testcase to reproduce this.\n\nE.g. by creating a dir like mentioned above, `cd`ing to it and then using it from autojump.\n\n(It is not that useful having to download a 512mb file - and that would just be the lesser part of the issue)\n\nI am guessing there's an infinite loop involved somewhere, where autojump might be confused about the dir not being added already, while it is.\n. Awesome, thanks!\n\nYou should update the docs accordingly, I have added a pull request for that: https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/pull/151\n. JFI: the `_j` script is only used for completion, and should not be executable.\n\nWith the current `install.py` script that does not appear to be an issue though - so this appears to got reverted (which is good).\n. Ok.\nMy understanding has been that autojump would jump to the second best directory, if the current working directory is the best match already.\nWould that make sense for a feature request then?\n. That fixed it.\nThanks!\n. Re-opening, see my comment at https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/commit/a99183bf8b7cf322161ca42bcf4d70dbc3741673#commitcomment-2324384\n. I have another issue in this context: autojump will return no results if the current directory matches, but gets skipped now (again). Also, `j` will return an error (because of the empty result from `autojump`).\n\nI think this should not get considered to be an error. What do you think?\n. Yes, it's just the error that is irritating.\n. I am closing this issue - I have opened #182 instead for the return code issue.\n. I think the stalling should be addressed/fixed with my pull request, which has been merged:\nhttps://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/pull/169\n. > Not sure if this is the correct approach, it needs another set of eyes.\n\nThis does not make sense, since e.g. `jc foo` is supposed to limit the queries to subdirectories, which is not given anymore then.\n\nRegarding your question on SO: you do not need to replace what's on the user's command line, do you? You only need to change the command used for getting completions.\n\nFWIW, i would be more interested in zsh completion for it.. ;)\n. I think it might be not too confusing (and is what I have expected).\n\nI could imagine solving this by keeping a list of least recently jumped to directories in the current shell, and skip these - until you change to another directory manually, or execute some command (which could be detected using shell hooks, if there is support for this (e.g. with Zsh)).\n. (Probably) not fixed: see my commit note: https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/commit/473c8b8daacee008e20958990d0a72811fbf8f5d#commitcomment-5041730\n. Thanks for fixing it this fast!\n. I would have expected the entry which gets chosen without `--complete` to be also the first with `--complete`.\n. I thought about adding an `assert` to the beginning of the function..\nThis apart, is there any other way to make sure a list gets passed as argument?\n\nIt seems like this issue (accidentally iterating over a string) happens much too often in Python by accident.\n. It seems there was invalid unicode data:\n\n> File \"/root/.autojump/bin/autojump_data.py\", line 68, in\n>     tupleize = lambda x: (x[1], float(x[0]))\n>     UnicodeEncodeError: 'decimal' codec can't encode characters in position 0-65: invalid decimal Unicode string\n\nIt would have been interesting to see your `autojump.txt` file / the broken entry and to find out how it ended up there.\n\nI am closing this issue for now. Feel free to re-open it in case this happens again.\n. Can you please try autojump master?\n\nIt looks like the `autojump -a` line mentioned in the error is quite old already (changed in commit 4716493).\n\nThen, if you still get an error, try to manually invoke the line that's referred to in the error.\n\nWith the original error, it might complain about `>>|`, which might indicate that it's not zsh, which is being invoked as a shell.\n\nIt's also likely that some oh-my-zsh option is interfering here, but then I am using some forked and adjusted omz myself. You could try to reproduce it using `zsh -f` (no config).\n. Like I've assumed before, it is likely that a non-zsh shell picks up this file, especially when it's in /etc/profile.d.\nIs this where ArchLinux installs it? That seems to be wrong then.\n\n@dphilpot \n\n> Still having this error when i execute a \"shell build\" command in sublime text.\n\nThis is also likely to use a non-zsh shell.\nIs it correct that you've installed autojump via `brew`?\nDoes this also add a file into `/etc/profile.d`?\n\nCan you both try `sh -i` and `bash -i` from a terminal, to see if that triggers the error?\nThen `sh -c true` and `bash -c true` might be interesting to try, too.\n. Oh, it seems autojump's install script copies all shell files into `/etc/profile.d`! (https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/blob/master/install.py#L197-L204)\n\nThis appears to be wrong and a bug with the install script/process.\nThere should only be generic, POSIX compatible scripts therein probably, and not all the files for the different flavors autojump supports.\n\nI could imagine having only a single `autojump_init.sh` script therein, which would source/use the matching script for the current shell.\n. It seems like the install script should not use `etc/profile.d` at all, but put the shell scripts (meant to be sourced) into `args.prefix, 'share', 'autojump'`, like it's done with the Debian/Ubuntu package (`/usr/share/autojump/`):\n\n> % cat /tmp/autojump-21.7.1/debian/autojump.install \n> bin/autojump      usr/bin\n> bin/autojump.bash usr/share/autojump\n> bin/autojump.zsh  usr/share/autojump\n> bin/autojump.sh   usr/share/autojump\n> bin/autojump.fish usr/share/autojump\n> bin/_j            usr/share/zsh/functions/Completion/Unix\n. FWIW, you can install it manually easily (for zsh in this case):\n1. `git clone https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump ~/.autojump`\n2. Add `source ~/.autojump/bin/autojump.zsh` to ~/.zshrc\n3. For completion, copy/symlink `~/.autojump/bin/_j` somewhere into your zsh's `fpath` (I have added a symlink in `~/.dotfiles/oh-my-zsh/functions`, which is in my `$fpath`).\n. @erbridge \nIt seems like the executable scripts `/etc/profile.d/*.sh` get sourced upon login (e.g. via LightDM on Ubuntu).\n[autojump.sh](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/blob/master/bin/autojump.sh) detects the current shell and then sources the appropriate file.\nTherefore, everything looks OK, although I still think that autojump should not install the files there.\n\nCan you provide the output of `ls -l /etc/profile.d/autojump*`, please?\nFrom the install script, `autojump.sh` shouldn't be executable.\n\nArchLinux might behave differently regarding the handling of `/etc/profile.d`.\nI assume you have installed `/etc/profile.d/autojump.zsh` manually? In your `~/.zshrc`?\n. All (but limited to the max. number of return values of course), sorted by weight (as with the others).\nIt's just as with any other completion, e.g. `cd <tab>` (usually/can) provide all entries.\n\nWhile at it, it would be nice to have an option to specify the maximum number of values to be returned (in case that's not possible already).\n. I have added a PR for this: #296.\n\nBefore merging it, I would like to get some feedback / OK on it first.\n. The scripts are executable, but the Makefile lines should have a leading `./`.\n\nFixed in https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/commit/8c7f0bf994c778d0f126977aeef8c4807ac75384.\n. Thanks for your PR!\n\nI have looked into merging it, but decided to fix it in a different way: https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/commit/27a01662a5e09118a34ce83c567aec63f1943069\n. Should be fixed, see https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/pull/262\n. Sorry, I was wrong. I will push a real fix for this.\n. Fixed via https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/pull/262.\n. The error is `sre_constants.error: bogus escape: '\\\\U'`.\n\nIt probably comes from autojump incorrectly/not escaping the \"U\" in \"C:\\Users...\".\n\nFrom the Python documentation;\n\n> .. versionchanged:: 3.3\n>    The `'\\u'` and `'\\U'` escape sequences have been added.\n\nI am pushing a fix for this, please retry it with autojump master.\n.

    "tortolo": "Some questions so that I can implement that.\n1. Why testing if .local/share exists, and falling back to using ~ as the data directory (putting not-hidden files in it!) if it does not? I think it would be simpler to simply comply with the XDG Specification and to use $XDG_DATA_HOME/autojump, creating it, including parent directories, if needed.\n2. What is $AUTOJUMP_HOME for in the Bash script?\n. At bit more about my suggestion of not falling back to ~ as the data directory. Following the XDG Specification and only it, without a custom fallback, would make the scripts simpler and easier to understand and to maintain. Instead of [if $XDG_DATA_HOME exists then \u2026, but if it does not exist, then if .local/share exists then \u2026, else use ~], it would become [we follow the XDG Spec, that is: we use $XDG_DATA_HOME/autojump where $XDG_DATA_HOME default to .local/share] which is more understandable. I think maintaining the alternative of using ~ directly only adds confusion.\n\nIn addition, it would become easier for the Python scripts too (both autojump and jumpapplet): instead of relying on an environment variable $AUTOJUMP_HOME or trying to guess, they could just follow the spec, fullstop.\n. Well, I have just (truly) implemented the XDG Base Directory Specification. You can pick up the code from my branch, if it suits you:\n$ git pull git://git.ortolo.eu/pkg-autojump.git contrib/xdg-base-directory\n. joelthelion, 2011-07-28 02:05 UTC-0700:\n\n> I haven't checked your code yet, but you can find the explanation why XDG is commented out in the git history: the problem is that in the distributions that I have checked, the XDG env variables are not updated correctly when the user uses sudo or su. Thus his database is updated as root, then the autojump file belongs to root and the user is locked with permission problems.\n\nThis is normal, rather a problem between chair and keyboard. Using su\ndirectly instead of su -, or sudo -s instead of sudo -i keeps\nenvironment variables. It is meant to.\n\nHowever, unless someone explicitely sets $XDG_DATA_HOME, this\nenvironment variable is unset and $HOME/.local/share is used instead.\nThus, for most people this problem simply does not exist.\n\n> I'm all for implementing and following the standard, so if you can find a way of implementing this that is compatible with the use of su and sudo, I will merge it.\n\nI suggest that we simply follow the specification but adding a security\ncheck: if $XDG_DATA_HOME does not belong to the current user, simply\ndisable autojump.\n\n## \n\nTanguy Ortolo\n. joelthelion, 2011-09-02 10:11 UTC-0700:\n\n> I have merged your branch. Does it seem correct to you?\n\nGiven that the file ownership check was already there, yes. Thank you!\n:-)\n\n## \n\nTanguy Ortolo\n. Well, it appears that simply copying the functions code is not enough, as they have incompatibilities with the surrounding code, such as a different use of print. So I think we will just get a non-working jumpapplet in Debian, or perhaps better, no jumpapplet at all.\n. Joel Schaerer, 2011-10-03 02:35 UTC-0700:\n\n> Any advice on how this library should be named and where it should be placed?\n\nSomething like \u201cjumplib\u201d? Now, as it comes to sharing functions, I think\nit may become necessary to start using Python distutils to create a\nsetup script, because this project is no longer a standalone executable.\n\n## \n\nTanguy Ortolo\n. Joel Schaerer, 2011-12-11 09:56-0800:\n\n> Thinking a bit more about this issue, can't you consider autojump as a stand-alone executable file **and** a library, possibly symlinking it to the place where libraries should be? I really want to keep autojump standalone.\n\nThat may be tricky but I shall try. Feel free to put this bug on hold, I\nshall tell you what I manage to do.\n\nUltimately, if I do not find a satisfactory way to solve that,\njumpapplet will get out of Debian, since very few people are using it.\n\n## \n\nTanguy Ortolo\n. jkuan, 2011-12-12 06:03-0800:\n\n> I have a question about the original issue: is the problem that\n> applets can't import functions from /usr/bin/autojump, or that it's\n> against debian guidelines to import functions from a file located in\n> the bin directory?\n\nI do not think it is against our guidelines, only weird.

This issue seems to come up time and time again: #65.\n\nYes, I could, but the problem is I really doubt they would see and read \none message in the whole package installation output. I mean, if a user \ndoes not even think of reading autojump's manpage (which I patched to \nindicate it has to be sourced) or the package's README.Debian (standard \nmain information file for any Debian package), or to report such a bug \nto Debian rather than to autojump, I do not see how he could pay any \nattention to installation messages\u2026\n\nI could add a debconf screen for that, which is modal and cannot be \nmissed, but that would probably be an abuse of debconf which is made for \nconfiguring packages, not for displaying information. And it would have \nto be a low priority debconf screen not to block automated \ninstallations, so it would not be displayed on systems configured to \nignore low priority debconf screens, which is usually the case for those \npeople.\n\nNow, I think there is one thing that may be more useful: create and \ninstall a script named /usr/bin/j, that just indicates what has to be \ndone to load autojump for Bash or Zsh.\n\n## \n\n  ,--.\n: /`)   Tanguy Ortolo      <xmpp:tanguy@ortolo.eu>\n|`-'    Debian Developer   irc://irc.oftc.net/Tanguy\n  _\n.

What is $AUTOJUMP_HOME for in the Bash script?\n. At bit more about my suggestion of not falling back to ~ as the data directory. Following the XDG Specification and only it, without a custom fallback, would make the scripts simpler and easier to understand and to maintain. Instead of [if $XDG_DATA_HOME exists then \u2026, but if it does not exist, then if .local/share exists then \u2026, else use ~], it would become [we follow the XDG Spec, that is: we use $XDG_DATA_HOME/autojump where $XDG_DATA_HOME default to .local/share] which is more understandable. I think maintaining the alternative of using ~ directly only adds confusion.\n\nIn addition, it would become easier for the Python scripts too (both autojump and jumpapplet): instead of relying on an environment variable $AUTOJUMP_HOME or trying to guess, they could just follow the spec, fullstop.\n. Well, I have just (truly) implemented the XDG Base Directory Specification. You can pick up the code from my branch, if it suits you:\n$ git pull git://git.ortolo.eu/pkg-autojump.git contrib/xdg-base-directory\n. joelthelion, 2011-07-28 02:05 UTC-0700:\n\n> I haven't checked your code yet, but you can find the explanation why XDG is commented out in the git history: the problem is that in the distributions that I have checked, the XDG env variables are not updated correctly when the user uses sudo or su. Thus his database is updated as root, then the autojump file belongs to root and the user is locked with permission problems.\n\nThis is normal, rather a problem between chair and keyboard. Using su\ndirectly instead of su -, or sudo -s instead of sudo -i keeps\nenvironment variables. It is meant to.\n\nHowever, unless someone explicitely sets $XDG_DATA_HOME, this\nenvironment variable is unset and $HOME/.local/share is used instead.\nThus, for most people this problem simply does not exist.\n\n> I'm all for implementing and following the standard, so if you can find a way of implementing this that is compatible with the use of su and sudo, I will merge it.\n\nI suggest that we simply follow the specification but adding a security\ncheck: if $XDG_DATA_HOME does not belong to the current user, simply\ndisable autojump.\n\n## \n\nTanguy Ortolo\n. joelthelion, 2011-09-02 10:11 UTC-0700:\n\n> I have merged your branch. Does it seem correct to you?\n\nGiven that the file ownership check was already there, yes. Thank you!\n:-)\n\n## \n\nTanguy Ortolo\n. Well, it appears that simply copying the functions code is not enough, as they have incompatibilities with the surrounding code, such as a different use of print. So I think we will just get a non-working jumpapplet in Debian, or perhaps better, no jumpapplet at all.\n. Joel Schaerer, 2011-10-03 02:35 UTC-0700:\n\n> Any advice on how this library should be named and where it should be placed?\n\nSomething like \u201cjumplib\u201d? Now, as it comes to sharing functions, I think\nit may become necessary to start using Python distutils to create a\nsetup script, because this project is no longer a standalone executable.\n\n## \n\nTanguy Ortolo\n. Joel Schaerer, 2011-12-11 09:56-0800:\n\n> Thinking a bit more about this issue, can't you consider autojump as a stand-alone executable file **and** a library, possibly symlinking it to the place where libraries should be? I really want to keep autojump standalone.\n\nThat may be tricky but I shall try. Feel free to put this bug on hold, I\nshall tell you what I manage to do.\n\nUltimately, if I do not find a satisfactory way to solve that,\njumpapplet will get out of Debian, since very few people are using it.\n\n## \n\nTanguy Ortolo\n. jkuan, 2011-12-12 06:03-0800:\n\n> I have a question about the original issue: is the problem that\n> applets can't import functions from /usr/bin/autojump, or that it's\n> against debian guidelines to import functions from a file located in\n> the bin directory?\n\nI do not think it is against our guidelines, only weird. How would you\nimplement that in practice?\n\n## \n\nTanguy Ortolo\n. Joel Schaerer, 2012-01-10 12:27-0800:\n\n> There are two ways to achieve this currently:\n> 1. Keep pressing on the \"enter\" key for a few seconds.\n\nYes, that is right. I was overthinking it, so I missed the most obvious\nsolution! Please close that issue. :-)\n\n## \n\nTanguy\n. William Ting, 2014-01-15 14:13-0800:\n\n> @tortolo: Is it possible for you to add a post installation message asking users to add `source /usr/share/autojump/autojump.sh` to their ~/.bashrc (or shell rc file). This issue seems to come up time and time again: #65.\n\nYes, I could, but the problem is I really doubt they would see and read \none message in the whole package installation output. I mean, if a user \ndoes not even think of reading autojump's manpage (which I patched to \nindicate it has to be sourced) or the package's README.Debian (standard \nmain information file for any Debian package), or to report such a bug \nto Debian rather than to autojump, I do not see how he could pay any \nattention to installation messages\u2026\n\nI could add a debconf screen for that, which is modal and cannot be \nmissed, but that would probably be an abuse of debconf which is made for \nconfiguring packages, not for displaying information. And it would have \nto be a low priority debconf screen not to block automated \ninstallations, so it would not be displayed on systems configured to \nignore low priority debconf screens, which is usually the case for those \npeople.\n\nNow, I think there is one thing that may be more useful: create and \ninstall a script named /usr/bin/j, that just indicates what has to be \ndone to load autojump for Bash or Zsh.\n\n## \n\n  ,--.\n: /`)   Tanguy Ortolo      <xmpp:tanguy@ortolo.eu>\n|`-'    Debian Developer   irc://irc.oftc.net/Tanguy\n  _\n.

The dirname occured several times, with each \u00fc duplicated from one line to the other. Yep, exponential growth - I found my file being roughly 1 GB in size.\n\nSecond, an entry with just the weight, but empty dir. Probably because I had to kill a chroot the hard way, and I can imagine autojump being interrupted while trying to write the line). autojump wasn't able to recover from that, failing to parse the line. Suggestion: if you find an imparsable line (in particular, an empty dir name), just delete it?\n\nWhen I removed the strange unicode entries, autojump immediately started to produce `tmp...` files in the database folder, each of ~16MB, and forked instances again. Restarting autojump helped, and then I was presented a parsing error for the second problem.

I found two strange sorts of entries in the `autojump.txt` database:\n\nFirst, several entries for a directory with an unusual character in the name (a German \u00fc Umlaut), but stored in composed form. The dirname occured several times, with each \u00fc duplicated from one line to the other. Yep, exponential growth - I found my file being roughly 1 GB in size.\n\nSecond, an entry with just the weight, but empty dir. Probably because I had to kill a chroot the hard way, and I can imagine autojump being interrupted while trying to write the line). autojump wasn't able to recover from that, failing to parse the line. Suggestion: if you find an imparsable line (in particular, an empty dir name), just delete it?\n\nWhen I removed the strange unicode entries, autojump immediately started to produce `tmp...` files in the database folder, each of ~16MB, and forked instances again. Restarting autojump helped, and then I was presented a parsing error for the second problem. Not sure if or how the two situations are related, but maybe at least the second one is easily fixable?\n\nThanks a lot for autojump, BTW!\n\nBest\n. ",

Ah, it happened again someday last week, after so long a time since last time.349 entries was removed, file size shrank from 93K to 77K.. Thanks, it's much longer, but works!\n. I've checked my backups. It shows about 11K data, more than 200 lines of history were lost in March 6 or 5. It's longer than what autojump keeps for as backup (only 24 hours) before I realize data loss had happened.\n. @sxe I've forked and made some change to avoid the situation I've described. Would you try that and see if it solves the problem for you?\n. I'm sometimes annoyed when I didn't make a typo, but autojump doesn't have that path (I lost many paths in an incident described in #358 ), so it goes to a rather random place.\n.

Still the same behaviour: autojump works, but no tab completion.\n\ngrota, can you test on your machine?\n. I just updated my zsh from version 4.3.11 (preinstalled) to 5.0.2 (via macports). In that version, everything works as expected. So maybe we should just add this hint somewhere and leave it at that?\n. Same issue here, on Mac 10.7.5 running zsh 4.3.11. I can't get autocompletion working. I tried using the oh-my-zsh plugin, and a plain manual installation. I also tried putting ~/.autojump/bin on the path. Nothing helped.\nAutojump itself works (e.g. \"j src\"), but tab-completion does not. It just shows the files of the current directory.\n\nAnyway, let me express my deep gratitude for all your development work!

I also have this problem on Lubuntu 17.04, and had it on 16.10 as well.\r\n\r\nI don't recall it having been an issue when I first started using autojump.\r\n\r\nThough I haven't yet read the preceding comments in-depth, a race condition seems possible, since I am running many terminals at once and, at some point, closing them en masse when, e.g., I shutdown the computer.. Look like #391 is where discussion of this issue is happening.. ",
    "PorcelainMouse": "Since I implemented a patch proposed in #482, I have not experienced this bug.\r\n\r\nI'm interested in hearing @r-barnes results, too, though.  If successful, is there a reason this \"early locking\" could not be used in autojump?. Argh!  Got an update that overwrote the patch from #482.  It happened on the next reboot.  I don't understand how other people aren't experiencing this.  It happens to me constantly.. I did have 100% success with #482.  April 21 until July 25.  I have 279 entries currently.  This suggests our situations are different, which means there are multiple triggers for this bug.  Whatever I'm doing that causes it, is always related to the different filesystems that autojump uses to managed the db, like @Frefreak suggested.  And, just as I suggested, there could be multiple code paths that lead to the same bug, some of which, I just never use but you do.. What's your distro?  Just trying to assure myself this issue isn't a package problem with my distro.\r\n\r\nYeah, I haven't thought of a way this could happen, so, I figure the authors will know.  I'm glad I'm not the only one experiencing this, too.. @Frefreak Cool, good thinking; I follow your logic. That could be it.\r\nI'd be happy to try that.  I'm using Fedora.\r\n\r\nDo you know the logic that lead to save()?  Just trying to piece together the scenario that causes this.\r\n\r\nI take it you are speculating about a race condition?  Making the move atomic will help, but I think what you really want is to make autojump_data.save() atomic.  Right?  Just fixing move() doesn't completely work, right?  I could be wrong, I just glanced at that function for a second.\r\n\r\nDo you know what I'm getting at? I worry that the problem is multiple entry into save(), not actually the race condition on move().. Hmm, well, I made the change and we'll see how it goes.\r\n\r\nYou should submit your patch, as it seems reasonable and is an improvement, regardless.  I  reused code I found elsewhere like this:\r\n\r\n    xdg_data_home = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), '.local', 'share')\r\n    xdg_aj_home = os.path.join(xdg_data_home, 'autojump')\r\n    temp = NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False, dir=xdg_aj_home)\r\n\r\nThe first thing I don't understand is why there is a difference between new directory entries and truncated db?  Sounds like you found out that autojump sometimes deletes the whole db.  Please share.  Why does autojump ever do that?\r\n\r\nMy other confusion is why you don't consider this a race condition.  The atomic-ness of `mv` is irrelevant for any single thread since `mv` blocks in all cases.  Even if `mv` is interrupted, no single thread could simultaneously call `mv` and read the db.  `mv` could fail, but then autojump would have to ignoring the error and then read.  And, even then, I'm confident `mv` isn't failing with the mv half completed...hmm, okay, I guess I'm not confident, but then why would `mv` only be failing for autojump and not other callers?.

In my case `autojump.txt` became completely binary/\"garbage\" after autojump crash (don't know why). `strings autojump.txt` doesn't give anything useful. Fixed overwriting with `autojump.txt.bak`. Compared side by side with an hex editor and at least at first look I could't find any pattern. Using v22.2.4, Python 2.7.12.. I do the same steps with a directory with a space in it name and work perfectly. The problem is with parentheses. autojump suggest me the alternatives and just paste the whole path with the parentheses there, if I have to go to the start and to the end to put quotes then is not so handy/fast as it supposed. Either way, I tried with quotes **and autojump crash**:\r\n```\r\npablo ~/a(b $ cd ..\r\npablo ~ $ j a__\r\na__1__/home/pablo/Downloads     \r\na__2__/home/pablo/a(b\r\npablo ~ $ j /home/pablo/a(b \r\nbash: syntax error near unexpected token `('\r\npablo ~ $ j \"/home/pablo/a(b\" \r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/usr/bin/autojump\", line 420, in <module>\r\n    sys.exit(main(parse_arguments()))\r\n  File \"/usr/bin/autojump\", line 414, in main\r\n    ['.'])))\r\n  File \"/usr/share/autojump/autojump_utils.py\", line 42, in first\r\n    return it.__next__()\r\n  File \"/usr/bin/autojump\", line 287, in <lambda>\r\n    flags=regex_flags)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.5/re.py\", line 173, in search\r\n    return _compile(pattern, flags).search(string)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.5/re.py\", line 293, in _compile\r\n    p = sre_compile.compile(pattern, flags)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.5/sre_compile.py\", line 536, in compile\r\n    p = sre_parse.parse(p, flags)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.5/sre_parse.py\", line 829, in parse\r\n    p = _parse_sub(source, pattern, 0)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.5/sre_parse.py\", line 437, in _parse_sub\r\n    itemsappend(_parse(source, state))\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.5/sre_parse.py\", line 781, in _parse\r\n    source.tell() - start)\r\nsre_constants.error: missing ), unterminated subpattern at position 13\r\nautojump: directory '/home/pablo/a(b' not found\r\n\\n\\n\r\nTry `autojump --help` for more information.\r\n```\r\nAs you can see on the first line the directory exist..
