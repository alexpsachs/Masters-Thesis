PR is up and we'll be fixing it shortly. thanks!. This is intentional. A timer isn't done until it finishes.\n\nAlso super old task. Sorry! Doing some housecleaning\n. Hey all, this seems super old (sorry, housecleaning) and as noted above it's not quite worth fixing this since our primary concerns are with supporting prototyping with origami Layers rather than QC unit based consumer patches.\n. Sorry, we have no plans to do backwards compatibility :(\n. Thanks for the recommendation. We haven't decided to prioritze this (obviously, commenting after more than 1.5 years), but for now I'd recommend using the shortcuts CMD + . and CMD + R \u2014 it's one more key press but basically just as fast. Sorry!\n. I cannot reproduce this 1.5 years later. Please reopen a new issue if you see this still.\n. Is this an Origami bug? Sounds like a QC issue that full screen just doesnt support the toolbar. Closing.\n. Unfortunately we have no plans to support Interaction masked to a circle. For most prototyping/user testing purposes it doesn't detract from the prototype, so it's a low priority for us/expensive for QC to calculate hit area based on an arbitrary alpha mask.\n. It would be super cool - totally agree :) if we think of a good inexpensive way to do it itd be cool\n\nSent from Outlook Mobile\n\nOn Fri, Dec 25, 2015 at 11:49 AM -0800, \"Jonathan Hammond\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nOk, was really needed in some rial examples of mine last year, but I can understand this might be hard to implement. \n\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Hi all, as noted on the Code Export docs (and from jwebcat above) we only support a few things in Code Export right now:\n- Pop Animation patches\n- Transitions connected to Pop animation patches\n- The connections between those Transitions and Layers\n\nhttp://facebook.github.io/origami/documentation/concepts/CodeExport.html\n\nDaemon-Devarshi, hard to answer without seeing your composition. Can you open a new issue if you are still experiencing the issue?\n. Hi, unfortunately we do not support custom versions in our API for replacing the window chrome. It's possible to do on your own (as we did) but we cannot show you how in this context.\n. I think the best solution we have for now is just prefilling with the search query for Graphics Tools. Unfortunately this gets wiped if you need to log in. Apple...\n. good call. we'll get on this\n. Updated to 2.1.2 public release \u2014 sorry for the delay... \n\nUnfortunately we cannot share the source code due to its heavy use of private APIs.\n. Hi, are you still encountering this? We've fixe a few El Capitan issues since it was in beta August.\n. Thanks for reporting this.\n\nCould you answer an additional question: did you ever install an older version prior to 2.1.2? Did you ever install Avocado?\n. That should be unrelated\n\nI may put up a faq/troubleshooting section to help with this and other common issues. Thanks!\n. Thanks for submitting this. This was actually intentional. If we reverse this `<li>` and `<a>` ordering it bolds the button text, changing the design. Closing.\n. Thanks for the report. \n\nCan you provide steps to reproduce?
