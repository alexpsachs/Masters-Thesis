A couple notes:\n- I think for now we should stick `util.go` in auth since that is where it may be used most. We may choose to move it later. Possibly into a helper function (see #13)\n- This code needs to be formatted. Since the code is in a subpackage (extras/auth) you will need to fmt with `go fmt ./...`. This same concept applies to testing with multiple packages as well `go test ./...`\n. Also, one question for you as a developer:\n\nDoes the `extras` make sense to you or should I rename it to `contrib`? I have also been debating whether or not the contrib package should be a part of the core repo. I will have to check out the semantics for `go get`.

Thanks for putting your best foot forward and converting these tests over. I love what you guys have done with GoConvey and am excited to start using it in all my Go web applications.\n\nFor the sake of keeping the core Martini package clean, I don't want to pull in any other dependencies at this time. Please shoot me an email though because I have some ideas on how Martini/GoConvey can collaborate together. You guys are awesome and I really look forward to working with you soon!\n. FYI: My email is on my GitHub profile\n. I'm not a super huge fan of benchmarks like these. But if someone put some stats together that exposed some major performance issues in Martini I would gladly take that feedback into consideration when optimizing the code.\n\nAgain, Martini is pretty thin on top of the `http` package, only possible performance issue sticking in my mind is the use of reflection. We are currently not cacheing reflection values. Again, without stats I really don't know whether or not it is worth optimizing at the moment. \n. I totally side with Matt here. Benchmarks are typically a bad metric to measure value of a web technology. That being said I will make sure Martini will be optimized in the places where it makes sense to optimize. Martini is about fun programming and good application architecture, not extreme performance.\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\n> On Nov 25, 2013, at 5:01 PM, Matt Silverlock notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> To add to what Dave said: use https://github.com/wg/wrk or \n> https://github.com/lighttpd/weighttp - I much prefer wrk, though. \n> \n> PS: Like I said upthread, \"reliable\" benchmarks are a minefield.

I put together a naive benchmark of reflection overhead specifically. Some people seem to be misinformed that reflection is going to significantly slow down their web app.\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/codegangsta/7678025\n\nBenchmarkFunctionCall 2000000000 0.57 ns/op\nBenchmarkReflectCall 5000000 380 ns/op\nBenchmarkInvoke 5000000 538 ns/op\n\nRaw function call compared to a reflect call compared to an injector.Invoke call.\n\nI'm sure you are thinking ZOMG 10X slower. But we are talking nanoseconds here. A typical Martini request will probably rack up anywhere between 5 and 15 invoke calls. If anyone considers a couple microseconds per-request too much of an overhead then you are not solving the same problems I am :)\n\nAlso feel free to call me out on this benchmark, it is a pretty naive one.\n. closing out as there are a couple of benchmarks already published. namely https://github.com/cypriss/golang-mux-benchmark/\n. This looks awesome so far. Very nice work!\n\nThe *RequireError bit is interesting. I will look into this in more detail in a little bit\n. Seriously this is great stuff. I can't wait to merge it in\n. testing this out and then I will merge\n. Yup. My initial thought is the `Router` interface can have a `NotFound` method that takes a `Handler`. We can have a default `Handler` that does the same thing Martini does now, but we should be able to swap them out easily.\n. I'm taking a look at this one this weekend\n. Yup. The wrapped handler needs to to implement http.Hijackerinterface. It currently does not. Below is a relevant thread on Golang-nuts:\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/zq_i3Hf7Nbs\n\nI definitely want to see this in Martini. It will add a lot of value.\n. Hah whoops. I totally overlooked that. Thanks got catching that\n.

Does `// +build !go1.1` mean 1.1 and later? or do I need to include 1.2 as well?\n\nDo the build constraints contain tags for patch-level versions of go as well as major/minor? \n. closing this. and adding a followup issue for @davecheney 's suggestion\n. I think @DisposaBoy has a point here. `Run()` is meant to be a convenience function to quickly get started, but is not attempting to solve most use cases.

I agree that `Run` has a purpose, and I want to keep it clean and simple.

I'm on this one\n. This would be nice to have. I'm not sure that Martini fits all of the specifications to make for very useful swagger documentation. Swagger is based on REST principals. And while you can create RESTful web services in Martini it is not imposed on you.\n. Yeah, I can do a little more research on this. There has been some work in #76 that will possibly let a third party package have enough access to the routing layer to create a good Swagger integration\n. I believe martini is able to support this with the routes service. If somebody wants to create a package to support martini and swagger they are more than welcome to.

More and more I am seeing the problem crop up where the responsewriter has to be wrapped and every time we have to implement all of the methods. I'm starting to think we need to create a generic `WrappedResponseWriter` that can be embedded into other structs. The benefit of having a WrappedResponseWriter is that we can implement Hijacker and other Interfaces there. This will allow for a safe environment to try type assertions. It will also clean up the many places we will possibly wrap the responsewriter.\n. @noonat I'm gonna spend some time to thing about this dilemma\n. I put up #71 to create a better jumping off point for this issue. We can have our `martini.ResponseWriter` implement `http.Hijacker`\n. Thanks!

Thanks for the help in figuring this out :)\n. Landing this\n. Cool! be sure to add PATCH to the readme under the routing section and I will merge this in.\n\nalso, relevant conversation on golang-nuts:\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/GjngdEKsUXA\n. pulling this down\n. yeah it still doesn't stop us from putting it in the router\n. BAM. Thanks for the contribution!\n. oh whoops totally missed this one. Looking at it now\n. not quite sure how I feel about this. One one hand it is very convenient, on the other hand it muddles up our return value handling even more. At this moment I am wary of merging this in. There might be a better way to accomplish this through a service that could easily handle errors.\n\n``` go\nm.Get(\"/\", func(e martini.ErrorHandler){\n  err, _ = doSomething()\n  e.Check(err) // throw 500 if err != nil\n})\n```\n\nThat can actually clean up code even more since it removes the need to check errors.\nCome to think of it, a package like that would do really well in the martini-contrib repo\n. This is a welcome change. merging\n. you can map whatever `*log.Logger` you want via `Map()`\n\n``` go\nm := martini.Classic()\nmyLogger := log.Logger(...)\nm.Map(myLogger)\n```\n. This is actually a pretty good idea. I will take a look at this soon\n. Cool! I will check this out tomorrow morning!\n. So I have been using this for a couple of routes, and it honestly feels a little bit clunky and not too Go-like.\n\nI think the thing that trips me up is the naming a route with a string when we are getting a route type back from routing now anyway. Something like this might be more idiomatic Go.\n\n``` go\n\nm := martini.Classic()\nLessonRoute := m.Get(\"/lessons/:id\", func() string {\n  return \"Here is a lesson\"\n})\n\nm.Get(\"/\", func(routes martini.Routes) {\n  println(routes.URLFor(LessonRoute, 42))\n})\n\n```\n\nThis should simplify the code a bit more. I can make these changes if you want. Great work btw!\n. Yeah. Your routes would obviously have to be put in global variables or\nexported from the package they are declared in. I think this approach is\ngood for a couple reasons:\n1. No need to name any route you want to reference.\n2. The compiler will bomb when a route name is changed, prompting any\n   references to be renamed.\n\nI do understand what you are saying though, it is a developer discretion\nkind of thing. If you want access to your route object you need to make\nsure it is available.\n\nOn Sun, Nov 24, 2013 at 12:36 PM, Jos\u00e9 Miguel Molina <\nnotifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> @codegangsta https://github.com/codegangsta the only problem I see with\n> your approach is that if you have the route handler in another file you\n> won't be able to get the route.\n> \n> _main.go_\n> \n> m := martini.Classic()LessonRoute := m.Get(\"/lessons/:id\", func() string {\n>   return \"Here is a lesson\"})\n> m.Get(\"/\", myFancyHandler)\n> \n> _whatever.go_\n> \n> func(routes martini.Routes) {\n>   println(routes.URLFor(LessonRoute, 42)) // You don't have access to LessonRoute here}\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/codegangsta/martini/pull/76#issuecomment-29165268\n> .\n.

I am hesitant to merge something like this in. This subtly changes the way martini works on a very foundational level.\n\nI think a better way to think about this solution would be to support context.Next() inside the route handler stack. This will make it more consistent with the middleware API, which in turn would make handlers with `Next()` compatible as route or middleware handlers.\n. btw I do believe this functionality needs to be in Martini. It is just the execution that bothers me\n. Yup. that would essentially be it. I can look into adding Next() support for the router later tonight. This will be a much more consistent approach.

It is a remnant of the original code before we had `NewResponseWriter()`. It could be removed in favor of a type assertion to `martini.ResponseWriter`\n. Nice catch btw\n. IMO it is not worth giving up the modularity because of a 10% hit.\n\nWith the martini-contrib prefix package we can actually have a silo'd off martini.Static handler. That way you won't run through the system call but still be able to serve static assets under a particular route prefix.\n\nAll that said, I think it is fine the way it is now.

The goal of martini is to be modular and tiny. I think that the codebase will soon hit a point of maturity where there will not be any major features added to the repo.\n\nWith the current state of the Go packaging/dependency management ecosystem this is a very good thing. I'm eagerly waiting for the day when I can stamp a 1.0 on martini and promise you guys that the API is completely stable. I think martini is tiny enough to achieve that sooner rather than later.\n\nmartini-contrib https://github.com/codegangsta/martini-contrib is where a lot of valuable functionality is being created. The cool part about martin-contrib is that you grab what you want. Go check out the packages there, I think they are pretty good. \n. Completely agree.

Thanks for putting this together, I have been struggling thinking about this particular feature.\n\nI think this code makes it much clearer to me that if we were to put a feature in like this I would much rather have it done the way you were originally planning where the Router would grab a `ResponseEncoder` interface from the context and use that to encode the return values. It feels much cleaner to me to do this in a middleware:\n\n`context.MapTo(myEncoder, (*martini.ResponseEncoder)(nil))`\n\nI agree that this makes things flexible, and there can definitely be some elegant code written around this. This also rides the line of too much magic for my tastes. The way Martini handles arguments is more explicit than this, and works partially due to it not being order dependent.\n\nI want to make sure I'm not rejecting a feature like this just because I think it doesn't fit. So I would like to open it up to the rest of the community. \n\n_Is this a valuable feature?_\n\n_Will it bring forth better or worse practices when working with Martini?_\n\n@davecheney I would like to know your thoughts on this\n\nRelevant discussion:\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/martini-go/_rq5j0b5ey8\n.

Instead of bailing early if a handler returns something the router will continue to run every handler and then check (via middleware) the return arguments.\n\nWhat happens if I have 2 of these return value handlers in the stack?\n. Cool. Thank for putting that in. Sorry for the delay I am still sitting on this feature. It is very very useful. I'm just trying to figure out whether or not it fits.\n\nIf this gets merged we will have to properly communicate that the proper middleware handler needs to be included for the functionality to work. This is a non-issue for a `martini.Classic()` but can be confusing and non-intuitive for a `martini.New` This is why I kinda like the idea of having a service. It may have some drawbacks, but it won't be sacrifice the consistency of the router return values. Just throwing some thoughts out there.\n\nAgain, sorry for pulling you through the ringer, I am struggling with finding the right implementation of this :P\n. Yeah. I think I like the idea of return values being in the router itself\n. @lukescott I investigated the service approach more and I think it ended up being really really clean without changing the current behavior of martini which I like. Check out #120 \n. closing in favor of #120 \n. :+1: pulling this down\n. Nice job! Thanks for the contribution\n. Thankfully Martini is not by any means a large project. I think it is fine\nto use whatever testing framework/package you want for your own apps. As\nfar as I have seen in the Go world not very many packages use any sort of\nthird party testing framework to write their own tests. Seeing that Martini\ncurrently has only one external package dependency, (Which I have control\nover) I at this time will shy away from bringing in any more.\n\nOn Tue, Dec 10, 2013 at 9:48 AM, Luke Scott notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> @Vladimiroff https://github.com/Vladimiroff testing does not have\n> everything.

Thanks for taking care of this!\n. Cool! This looks great. I'm going to rebase this and merge it in\n. To address your concerns:\n1. You don't inject things into ResponseEncoder, it is a singular purpose function. If you want dependencies you can map the function in a handler and use a closure to grab the dependencies you need.\n2. Whats wrong with `reflect`? Martini doesn't need to completely abstract it away.\n3. Middleware handler return values are already not processed. This is currently _by design_ in Martini. although this can be easily changed if need be.\n4. You don't have to write out the return values. you can choose to do nothing in the function.\n\nThe reason I like this is that it doesn't change the behavior of Martini. I will be honest with you and say that I probably won't use this feature much. I don't find it to be a very good pattern, to me it ruins some of the explicitness that the services provide and creates yet another layer of indirection. I look at this feature as more of an \"advanced\" one and therefore do not want to let any inexperienced developers be bit by the particular way this is implemented.\n\nThe middleware implementation of this in #110 now _requires_ a user to remember to `Use` the `martini.Printer` whenever the user chooses to forego the `martini.Classic()` route. That is not a hit I am willing to take to have this implemented as middleware. It is IMO not a good fit. Of course, pretty much everything you have in the `Writer()` middleware you wrote is accomplished by the implementation in this PR.\n. Hey @lukescott. Thanks for going over this contribution with me, I really and truly appreciate your input. For this first go-round (har har) I think I am going to land this PR and close out #110. I am really happy with this implementation and it should give you the tools to get you where you wanted to be.\n\nThanks again for all the mindshare!\n. Sorry? Use another framework?

I like this. Much more consistent with the rest of the codebase. Thanks for the contribution\n. Thanks for the contribution.\n\nThis PR actually exposes a leak in the service injection abstraction. This particular example can be problematic as it  now required overriders of `http.ResponseWriter` to map both `http.ResponseWriter` and `martini.ResponseWriter` to cover both cases.\n\nIn this instance it might be better to do a type assertion in your handler to get the `martini.ReponseWriter`:\n\n``` go\nfunc MyHandler(res http.ResponseWriter) {\n  rw := res.(martini.ResponseWriter)\n  if rw.Written() {\n    //do stuff here\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis pattern is actually used in the Logger middleware:\nhttps://github.com/codegangsta/martini/blob/master/logger.go#L15-L18\n. Yup. This particular case is not as helpful. I don't want to say \"Never map one instance to multiple types.\" But in this case it may create more headaches than it is worth, since ResponseWriter overwriting is encouraged within middleware.\n\nLike I said, this is a leaky part of the abstraction. In most cases this is not much of a problem.\n\nClosing this out\n. Ah. I see the problem now.\n\nTry using the `ServeHTTP` method from the `websocket.Handler`.\n\n``` go\nm.Get(\"/hello\", websocket.Handler(remoteHandler).ServeHTTP)\n```\n\nThat will give you the correct signature.\n\nMartini is compatible with the `http.HandlerFunc` interface. This can get a little confusing as `http.Handler` doesn't work unless you pass it's ServeHTTP function.\n. @nemothekid Yeah. bytes would probably be better to have as long as it doesn't break existing functionality.\n\nYou can use your own returnhandler by mapping it as a service:\n\n``` go\nm.Map(martini.ReturnHandler(myReturnFunc))\n```\n. Sounds good to me.

Hey, thanks for putting this up. I will check this out soon. It looks like the Routes service was the best place to put it. I'm curious, what ways are you wanting to use the routes service in a middleware?\n. Yeah, it is an unfortunate pitfall of the modularity model we are using. I think this is a great start though. I don't have any issues with the code other than how slow `MethodsFor` can be. We can optimize that later if it ever becomes a problem by maintaining a `map[string][]string` where the key is the route pattern and the map is the methods that it contains. that way we can stop matching when we find the first match.\n\nAnyway, that can be for another day. I'm gonna go ahead and merge this in. Nice work!\n. I would be willing to have Chinese documentation if it is needed. Otherwise, the source code should speak for itself pretty clearly. If any chinese developers write tutorials on martini I am more than happy to link it in the readme\n. closing out this issue. Thanks for the heads up! :)\n. Awesome. Thanks for updating those links!\n. Thx for the rogue issue ;) at least now I know you are heckling out martini\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\n> On Feb 14, 2014, at 8:29 PM, TJ Holowaychuk notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> nvm I see now </noise>\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. URL encoded values can be found with the `*http.Request` service. `martini.Params` only applies to the parameters parsed in the route. For instance \"hello/:foo/:bar\" will fill `martini.Params` with the `foo` and `bar` keys.\n. I know of some people that have integrated gorp with martini without many problems. I personally don't use it myself but I'm sure it shouldn't be too bad for them to work together.\n\nAs for a GopherCast, add a suggestion on our [uservoice](http://gophercasts.uservoice.com/forums/237576-suggestions) account\n.

Sweet. Merging\n. The solution here is to have that particular middleware run after the route is matched but before the handler is hit:\n\n``` go\nm := martini.Classic()\nm.Get(\"/auth/twitter\", TheMiddleware, MyHandler)\n```\n\nThat way the middleware will only be run when that route is matched.\n. I'm looking into this. I would really like this type of interaction to work with martini\n. Unfortunately it is a pretty tricky thing. Removing the initial wrapping will break write detection in the middleware loop. The only thing I can think of at the top of my head is to have a `ResponseWriter()` method on the `martini.ResponseWriter` that will return the ResponseWriter that was wrapped. This doesn't solve how the spdy ResponseWriter may conflict when you use other middleware that wraps it, but it could be a start\n. @pabbott0 if you have the time would you mind submitting a pull request with the implementation you have? it will be useful to have in core :)\n.

Merging this will break some code but I think I am okay with that since this feature was merged not too long ago\n. Merging.\n. a Martini instance implements `http.Handler` so it plays nicely with the rest of the http package:\n\n``` go\nhttp.HandleFunc(\"/\", RootHandler)\n\n// martini goes under \"/api\"\nm := martini.Classic()\n// ...\nhttp.Handle(\"/api/*\", m)\n\nhttp.ListenAndServe(\":8080\", nil)\n```\n\nTry something like boom for http benching https://github.com/rakyll/boom\n. closing\n. `Map`, as well as other functionality, comes from https://github.com/codegangsta/inject package.

Martini has moves to the github.com/go-martini/martini import path. This error is likely happening because you either didn't update an import path somewhere.

A Martini Handler is a callable function. Sometimes we use a kind of Factory pattern in the code where we can return a closure as that function and utilize the parent functions arguments as configuration. Static for instance:\n\n``` go\nfunc Static(dir string) Handler {\n  return func(c martini.Context) {\n    // we now have access to the 'dir' variable\n  }\n}\n```\n. Awesome. Merging\n. There is no reason for it really. The Run() method is simply a convenience\nand http.ListenAndServeTLS is totally compatible with Martini. Perhaps we\ncould have better documentation surrounding the use of it. Otherwise I\ndon't think we can offer enough wins to justify adding another method to\nMartini\n\nOn Sun, May 4, 2014 at 2:06 PM, tarqe39 notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Hi!\n> \n> Was wondering would it be a problem to add SSL support.

Looks like your test is importing the old version of martini \"github.com/codegangsta/martini\". This will present problems when trying to match types.\n. Awesome. Merging\n. @mohamedattahri I agree with @jonathaningram. Let's keep this more like the standard library and just take a string like `http.ListenAndServe`\n. Once that is done I will happily merge this\n. The included martini middlewares are supposed to be useful for most cases,\nbut not necessarily extendable. The extendibility of martini is in adding\nnew or replacing the existing middleware using the m.Handlers function\n\nOn Thu, May 15, 2014 at 9:47 AM, Jos\u00e9 Miguel Molina <\nnotifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> I don't think there's a better way to do this right now.\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/go-martini/martini/issues/266#issuecomment-43235028\n> .\n.

Thanks for the contribution. Merging\n. I'm not sure if this is the right solution.

Thanks!\n. LGTM. Landing\n. Nice catch. I'm happy to merge this in\n. Thanks for the contribution!\n. Excellent. Thanks for the contribution\n. @macedo keep In mind that this will not be safe from a concurrency standpoint unless we add a mutex around our routes collection. I think this will be useful, but I don't want to encourage this unless it will be thread safe\n. Awesome! :+1: \n. Looks great. Merging\n. Works for me!\n. Currently there is no support for this kind of behavior. Right now the `inject` package will panic if a dependency is not met.\nhttps://github.com/codegangsta/inject/blob/master/inject.go#L96\n\nI'm not sure how beneficial it may be to bake some code into Martini for this case. Another possible solution is to recover the panic from inject via a middleware and handle the case there\n. Thanks!\n. This will actually be part of the Action Layer, which will be executed after all middleware. This makes stacking a lot easier\n. The other option is to wrap our responsewriter and check to see if it is written to on iterations. This would be pretty intuitive\n. I think this will be better to do later. It might be too confusing to have a optional development server for martini\n. Thanks for that find. Is it because PORT is reserved for other usage on app engine? Martini is an `http.Handler` So you can have your own http server instance plug into martini if you would like.\n. http://godoc.org/github.com/codegangsta/martini#Martini.ServeHTTP is the link to the doc\n. Not sure I want this anymore. Helper utils can be in `martini-contrib`\n. done and done\n. landed. Closing this issue\n. also. it would be great to have a default favicon. Maybe generate one with go bin-data\n. This might not be needed immediately since we have static middleware by default. It still would be useful to have this though\n. closing this and moving it to `martini-contrib`\n. Looks like we can just use the fileserver handler. Freaking beautiful\n. Unfortunately The fileserver middleware throws a 404 if there is no match, which means we will need to roll our own\n. Easy peasy\n. I think I am going to go with drone.io for this one\n. All good points. I will keep this in mind when designing this handler\n. Moving this to `martini-contrib`. #44 solves the 404 issue somewhat on a Martini core level\n. I'm going to take care of this now\n. ditching this idea. Although there is no explicit documentation. This semantic is not close enough to the vanilla http.ResponseWriter Implementation.\n. This looks like a great improvement! I will check this out more thoroughly in the morning.\n. Cool. nice commit. A couple notes:\n- I think for now we should stick `util.go` in auth since that is where it may be used most. We may choose to move it later. Possibly into a helper function (see #13)\n- This code needs to be formatted. Since the code is in a subpackage (extras/auth) you will need to fmt with `go fmt ./...`. This same concept applies to testing with multiple packages as well `go test ./...`\n. Also, one question for you as a developer:\n\nDoes the `extras` make sense to you or should I rename it to `contrib`? I have also been debating whether or not the contrib package should be a part of the core repo. I will have to check out the semantics for `go get`. (we shouldn't be pulling in all the deps associated with contrib to just use Martini)\n. Oh you are totally right. The Github diffs threw me off\n. @bemurphy I pulled auth out of extras. Auth is still it's own package. But exists in the repo\n. @bemurphy Is this sucker ready to go?\n. :+1:  merging\n. Thanks for the contribution.\n. Love it! Thanks\n. This is an interesting suggestion. I will have to think about how I want to approach the API for this, as the route regex is compiled when the route is created\n. Yup. Close it out!\n. Nice catch. Fixed in the readme\n. Awesome. Thanks for fixing the typo\n. Thanks for the contribution. Reviewing this now\n. Got a couple of nits! Thanks again for putting this PR up\n. @DisposaBoy Great point.\n\nI'm leaning toward option 2 at the moment. I want to keep the default handlers in Martini pretty vanilla and most of all compatible with the majority of terminals. If someone really wants color they can roll their own logging handler or use a more advanced one from _martini-contrib_.\n\nLets nuke it.\n\n@mattn if you want the contribution add a commit to remove the escapes altogether. Otherwise I can nuke them myself.\n. Cool. I will remove them for now\n. That looks like a pretty odd error to me. What version of Go are you running? (`go version`)\n. I updated the readme to require go 1.1\n\nThanks for investigating this.\n. Love it! Thanks for playing with it on GAE. Merging\n. hey @mholt. Thanks for putting your best foot forward and converting these tests over. I love what you guys have done with GoConvey and am excited to start using it in all my Go web applications.\n\nFor the sake of keeping the core Martini package clean, I don't want to pull in any other dependencies at this time. Please shoot me an email though because I have some ideas on how Martini/GoConvey can collaborate together. You guys are awesome and I really look forward to working with you soon!\n. FYI: My email is on my GitHub profile\n. I'm not a super huge fan of benchmarks like these. But if someone put some stats together that exposed some major performance issues in Martini I would gladly take that feedback into consideration when optimizing the code.\n\nAgain, Martini is pretty thin on top of the `http` package, only possible performance issue sticking in my mind is the use of reflection. We are currently not cacheing reflection values. Again, without stats I really don't know whether or not it is worth optimizing at the moment. \n. I totally side with Matt here. Benchmarks are typically a bad metric to measure value of a web technology. That being said I will make sure Martini will be optimized in the places where it makes sense to optimize. Martini is about fun programming and good application architecture, not extreme performance.\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\n> On Nov 25, 2013, at 5:01 PM, Matt Silverlock notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> To add to what Dave said: use https://github.com/wg/wrk or \n> https://github.com/lighttpd/weighttp - I much prefer wrk, though. \n> \n> PS: Like I said upthread, \"reliable\" benchmarks are a minefield.

I put together a naive benchmark of reflection overhead specifically. Some people seem to be misinformed that reflection is going to significantly slow down their web app.\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/codegangsta/7678025\n\nBenchmarkFunctionCall 2000000000 0.57 ns/op\nBenchmarkReflectCall 5000000 380 ns/op\nBenchmarkInvoke 5000000 538 ns/op\n\nRaw function call compared to a reflect call compared to an injector.Invoke call.\n\nI'm sure you are thinking ZOMG 10X slower. But we are talking nanoseconds here. A typical Martini request will probably rack up anywhere between 5 and 15 invoke calls. If anyone considers a couple microseconds per-request too much of an overhead then you are not solving the same problems I am :)\n\nAlso feel free to call me out on this benchmark, it is a pretty naive one.\n. closing out as there are a couple of benchmarks already published. namely https://github.com/cypriss/golang-mux-benchmark/\n. This looks awesome so far. Very nice work!\n\nThe *RequireError bit is interesting. I will look into this in more detail in a little bit\n. Seriously this is great stuff. I can't wait to merge it in\n. testing this out and then I will merge\n. Yup. My initial thought is the `Router` interface can have a `NotFound` method that takes a `Handler`. We can have a default `Handler` that does the same thing Martini does now, but we should be able to swap them out easily.\n. I'm taking a look at this one this weekend\n. Yup. The wrapped handler needs to to implement http.Hijackerinterface. It currently does not. Below is a relevant thread on Golang-nuts:\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/zq_i3Hf7Nbs\n\nI definitely want to see this in Martini. It will add a lot of value.\n. Hah whoops. I totally overlooked that. Thanks got catching that\n.

Does `// +build !go1.1` mean 1.1 and later? or do I need to include 1.2 as well?\n\nDo the build constraints contain tags for patch-level versions of go as well as major/minor? \n. closing this. and adding a followup issue for @davecheney 's suggestion\n. I think @DisposaBoy has a point here. `Run()` is meant to be a convenience function to quickly get started, but is not attempting to solve most use cases. I think the real issue here is a documentation one.\n\nI don't want to try and abstract away the http interface unless we have really good reason to.\n\nI can update the documentation to push toward using http.ListenAndServe() for more configuration unless you feel like taking a crack at it @DrBenton \n. I agree that `Run` has a purpose, and I want to keep it clean and simple. I'm closing this issue and updating the readme with more information\n. @tobstarr Yeah it looks like the issue here is that we are triggering a parser error instead of a compiler error. I'm going to change the check so it can get past the parser stage. I will throw up a PR momentarily\n. I haven't seen it before, but I will check it out.

I'm on this one\n. This would be nice to have. I'm not sure that Martini fits all of the specifications to make for very useful swagger documentation. Swagger is based on REST principals. And while you can create RESTful web services in Martini it is not imposed on you.\n. Yeah, I can do a little more research on this. There has been some work in #76 that will possibly let a third party package have enough access to the routing layer to create a good Swagger integration\n. I believe martini is able to support this with the routes service. If somebody wants to create a package to support martini and swagger they are more than welcome to.

More and more I am seeing the problem crop up where the responsewriter has to be wrapped and every time we have to implement all of the methods. I'm starting to think we need to create a generic `WrappedResponseWriter` that can be embedded into other structs. The benefit of having a WrappedResponseWriter is that we can implement Hijacker and other Interfaces there. This will allow for a safe environment to try type assertions. It will also clean up the many places we will possibly wrap the responsewriter.\n. @noonat I'm gonna spend some time to thing about this dilemma\n. I put up #71 to create a better jumping off point for this issue. We can have our `martini.ResponseWriter` implement `http.Hijacker`\n. Thanks!

I'm fine with how you are testing in for now. Merging this\n. One nit. Fix that and I will land it. Great contribution!\n. pulling it down to play with it\n. Dude this is awesome. Love it\n. merged from rebase\n. done and done!\n. Thanks for filing this. It looks like we are doing a `filepath.Join` where we are not supposed to.\n\nhttp://golang.org/src/pkg/net/http/fs.go#L314\n\nLooks like the http.FileServer just concats \"/index.html\" and checks for that. Do you get good results when that is done?\n. @f-dumont you can just say \"closes\" #68 (without quotes) in the PR and it will close when the PR has landed\n. I might have to think about this for a little bit. I know it is definitely useful. The good news is that it can be worked around with multiple martini apps.\n. Looking into this\n. I fixed it up. Thanks for the help in figuring this out :)\n. Landing this\n. Cool! be sure to add PATCH to the readme under the routing section and I will merge this in.\n\nalso, relevant conversation on golang-nuts:\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/GjngdEKsUXA\n. pulling this down\n. yeah it still doesn't stop us from putting it in the router\n. BAM. Thanks for the contribution!\n. oh whoops totally missed this one. Looking at it now\n. not quite sure how I feel about this. One one hand it is very convenient, on the other hand it muddles up our return value handling even more. At this moment I am wary of merging this in. There might be a better way to accomplish this through a service that could easily handle errors.\n\n``` go\nm.Get(\"/\", func(e martini.ErrorHandler){\n  err, _ = doSomething()\n  e.Check(err) // throw 500 if err != nil\n})\n```\n\nThat can actually clean up code even more since it removes the need to check errors.\nCome to think of it, a package like that would do really well in the martini-contrib repo\n. This is a welcome change. merging\n. you can map whatever `*log.Logger` you want via `Map()`\n\n``` go\nm := martini.Classic()\nmyLogger := log.Logger(...)\nm.Map(myLogger)\n```\n. This is actually a pretty good idea. I will take a look at this soon\n. Cool! I will check this out tomorrow morning!\n. So I have been using this for a couple of routes, and it honestly feels a little bit clunky and not too Go-like.\n\nI think the thing that trips me up is the naming a route with a string when we are getting a route type back from routing now anyway. Something like this might be more idiomatic Go.\n\n``` go\n\nm := martini.Classic()\nLessonRoute := m.Get(\"/lessons/:id\", func() string {\n  return \"Here is a lesson\"\n})\n\nm.Get(\"/\", func(routes martini.Routes) {\n  println(routes.URLFor(LessonRoute, 42))\n})\n\n```\n\nThis should simplify the code a bit more. I can make these changes if you want. Great work btw!\n. Yeah. Your routes would obviously have to be put in global variables or\nexported from the package they are declared in.

It is a remnant of the original code before we had `NewResponseWriter()`. It could be removed in favor of a type assertion to `martini.ResponseWriter`\n. Nice catch btw\n.

The goal of martini is to be modular and tiny.

I think martini is tiny enough to achieve that sooner rather than later.\n\nmartini-contrib https://github.com/codegangsta/martini-contrib is where a lot of valuable functionality is being created.

Thanks for putting this together, I have been struggling thinking about this particular feature.\n\nI think this code makes it much clearer to me that if we were to put a feature in like this I would much rather have it done the way you were originally planning where the Router would grab a `ResponseEncoder` interface from the context and use that to encode the return values. It feels much cleaner to me to do this in a middleware:\n\n`context.MapTo(myEncoder, (*martini.ResponseEncoder)(nil))`\n\nI agree that this makes things flexible, and there can definitely be some elegant code written around this. This also rides the line of too much magic for my tastes. The way Martini handles arguments is more explicit than this, and works partially due to it not being order dependent.\n\nI want to make sure I'm not rejecting a feature like this just because I think it doesn't fit. So I would like to open it up to the rest of the community. \n\n_Is this a valuable feature?_\n\n_Will it bring forth better or worse practices when working with Martini?_\n\n@davecheney I would like to know your thoughts on this\n\nRelevant discussion:\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/martini-go/_rq5j0b5ey8\n.

Instead of bailing early if a handler returns something the router will continue to run every handler and then check (via middleware) the return arguments.\n\nWhat happens if I have 2 of these return value handlers in the stack?\n. Cool. Thank for putting that in. Sorry for the delay I am still sitting on this feature. It is very very useful. I'm just trying to figure out whether or not it fits.\n\nIf this gets merged we will have to properly communicate that the proper middleware handler needs to be included for the functionality to work. This is a non-issue for a `martini.Classic()` but can be confusing and non-intuitive for a `martini.New` This is why I kinda like the idea of having a service. It may have some drawbacks, but it won't be sacrifice the consistency of the router return values. Just throwing some thoughts out there.\n\nAgain, sorry for pulling you through the ringer, I am struggling with finding the right implementation of this :P\n. Yeah. I think I like the idea of return values being in the router itself\n. @lukescott I investigated the service approach more and I think it ended up being really really clean without changing the current behavior of martini which I like. Check out #120 \n. closing in favor of #120 \n. :+1: pulling this down\n. Nice job! Thanks for the contribution\n. Thankfully Martini is not by any means a large project. I think it is fine\nto use whatever testing framework/package you want for your own apps. As\nfar as I have seen in the Go world not very many packages use any sort of\nthird party testing framework to write their own tests. Seeing that Martini\ncurrently has only one external package dependency, (Which I have control\nover) I at this time will shy away from bringing in any more.\n\nOn Tue, Dec 10, 2013 at 9:48 AM, Luke Scott notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> @Vladimiroff https://github.com/Vladimiroff testing does not have\n> everything.

Thanks for taking care of this!\n. Cool! This looks great. I'm going to rebase this and merge it in\n. To address your concerns:\n1. You don't inject things into ResponseEncoder, it is a singular purpose function. If you want dependencies you can map the function in a handler and use a closure to grab the dependencies you need.\n2. Whats wrong with `reflect`? Martini doesn't need to completely abstract it away.\n3. Middleware handler return values are already not processed. This is currently _by design_ in Martini. although this can be easily changed if need be.\n4. You don't have to write out the return values. you can choose to do nothing in the function.\n\nThe reason I like this is that it doesn't change the behavior of Martini. I will be honest with you and say that I probably won't use this feature much. I don't find it to be a very good pattern, to me it ruins some of the explicitness that the services provide and creates yet another layer of indirection. I look at this feature as more of an \"advanced\" one and therefore do not want to let any inexperienced developers be bit by the particular way this is implemented.\n\nThe middleware implementation of this in #110 now _requires_ a user to remember to `Use` the `martini.Printer` whenever the user chooses to forego the `martini.Classic()` route. That is not a hit I am willing to take to have this implemented as middleware. It is IMO not a good fit. Of course, pretty much everything you have in the `Writer()` middleware you wrote is accomplished by the implementation in this PR.\n. Hey @lukescott. Thanks for going over this contribution with me, I really and truly appreciate your input. For this first go-round (har har) I think I am going to land this PR and close out #110. I am really happy with this implementation and it should give you the tools to get you where you wanted to be.\n\nThanks again for all the mindshare!\n. Sorry? Use another framework?

I like this. Much more consistent with the rest of the codebase. Thanks for the contribution\n. Thanks for the contribution.\n\nThis PR actually exposes a leak in the service injection abstraction. This particular example can be problematic as it  now required overriders of `http.ResponseWriter` to map both `http.ResponseWriter` and `martini.ResponseWriter` to cover both cases.\n\nIn this instance it might be better to do a type assertion in your handler to get the `martini.ReponseWriter`:\n\n``` go\nfunc MyHandler(res http.ResponseWriter) {\n  rw := res.(martini.ResponseWriter)\n  if rw.Written() {\n    //do stuff here\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis pattern is actually used in the Logger middleware:\nhttps://github.com/codegangsta/martini/blob/master/logger.go#L15-L18\n. Yup. This particular case is not as helpful. I don't want to say \"Never map one instance to multiple types.\" But in this case it may create more headaches than it is worth, since ResponseWriter overwriting is encouraged within middleware.\n\nLike I said, this is a leaky part of the abstraction. In most cases this is not much of a problem.\n\nClosing this out\n. Ah. I see the problem now.\n\nTry using the `ServeHTTP` method from the `websocket.Handler`.\n\n``` go\nm.Get(\"/hello\", websocket.Handler(remoteHandler).ServeHTTP)\n```\n\nThat will give you the correct signature.\n\nMartini is compatible with the `http.HandlerFunc` interface. This can get a little confusing as `http.Handler` doesn't work unless you pass it's ServeHTTP function.\n. @nemothekid Yeah. bytes would probably be better to have as long as it doesn't break existing functionality.\n\nYou can use your own returnhandler by mapping it as a service:\n\n``` go\nm.Map(martini.ReturnHandler(myReturnFunc))\n```\n.

Awesome. Thanks for fixing that up\n. Works for me\n. You can use a combination of globbing and the `strip` package from martini-contrib:\n\n``` go\nm := martini.Classic()\n\napi := martini.NewRouter()\napi.Get(\"/foobar\", func() string {\n  return \"yo dawg I heard you like routers\"\n})\nm.Get(\"/v1/**\", strip.Prefix(\"/v1\"), api.Handle)\n```\n. like @mvader mentioned. Preprocessor support will probably be an external tool. Martini is a minimal web framework.\n. I have been doing some work here:\n\nhttps://github.com/codegangsta/gin\n\nI probably won't want to have the tool in martini itself. I don't like the idea of pushing use of an external tool to run martini apps. Even if it is completely optional.\n\nclosing this out\n. Yup. Fresh is a good option. I also cleaned up gin a little. I use it on my projects every day https://github.com/codegangsta/gin\n\nI will eventually feature both of these projects in the martini readme since they are both useful\n. Maybe someday. Since we are in pre 1.0 stage it is not too important to have.\n. closing for now\n.

You can inject the context as a request-level dependency:\n\n``` go\nfunc AppEngine(c martini.Context, r *http.Request) {\n    c.Map(appengine.NewContext(r))\n}\n```\n\nYou can then use the new middleware and get the context injected:\n\n``` go\nm.Use(AppEngine)\nm.Get(\"/\", func(c appengine.Context) (int, string) {\n  return 200, \"OK\"\n})\n```\n. Yup. that is a bonus to the dependency injection.

Thanks again for catching that bug\n. This kind of thing sounds like it may be outside the scope of martini itself. You could certainly use Martini as a base to this kind of functionality.\n. Cool. pulling this down to take a look\n. I like this alot! Merging!\n. @djhworld What does your 404 handler look like?\n. @djhworld as @JamesClonk mentioned, prepend your hrefs with a `/` and the browser will request the static asset with the host as the base. No need for absolute paths. I just tested this locally and can confirm that it works properly\n. closing this out. It looks as though this issue is not specific to Martini\n. You have a good point with this PR. although it breaks existing functionality. I'm going to do a github search to get an idea of what projects this breaks.\n. We could call it through inject, although that incurs more runtime performance overhead. passing context at least makes this an opt-in to the performance overhead\n. I'm down with this change. I agree that it is cleaner overall. Nice work on this!\n. This is a good addition. pulling this down to fmt and add tests\n. bam. Merged\n. @elithrar So far I haven't heard of anybody having issues because of a env namespace conflict in this use case.

Hey, thanks for putting this up. I will check this out soon. It looks like the Routes service was the best place to put it. I'm curious, what ways are you wanting to use the routes service in a middleware?\n. Yeah, it is an unfortunate pitfall of the modularity model we are using. I think this is a great start though. I don't have any issues with the code other than how slow `MethodsFor` can be. We can optimize that later if it ever becomes a problem by maintaining a `map[string][]string` where the key is the route pattern and the map is the methods that it contains. that way we can stop matching when we find the first match.\n\nAnyway, that can be for another day. I'm gonna go ahead and merge this in. Nice work!\n. I would be willing to have Chinese documentation if it is needed. Otherwise, the source code should speak for itself pretty clearly. If any chinese developers write tutorials on martini I am more than happy to link it in the readme\n. closing out this issue. Thanks for the heads up! :)\n. Awesome. Thanks for updating those links!\n.

URL encoded values can be found with the `*http.Request` service. `martini.Params` only applies to the parameters parsed in the route. For instance \"hello/:foo/:bar\" will fill `martini.Params` with the `foo` and `bar` keys.\n. I know of some people that have integrated gorp with martini without many problems. I personally don't use it myself but I'm sure it shouldn't be too bad for them to work together.\n\nAs for a GopherCast, add a suggestion on our [uservoice](http://gophercasts.uservoice.com/forums/237576-suggestions) account\n.

Sweet. Merging\n. The solution here is to have that particular middleware run after the route is matched but before the handler is hit:\n\n``` go\nm := martini.Classic()\nm.Get(\"/auth/twitter\", TheMiddleware, MyHandler)\n```\n\nThat way the middleware will only be run when that route is matched.\n. I'm looking into this. I would really like this type of interaction to work with martini\n. Unfortunately it is a pretty tricky thing. Removing the initial wrapping will break write detection in the middleware loop. The only thing I can think of at the top of my head is to have a `ResponseWriter()` method on the `martini.ResponseWriter` that will return the ResponseWriter that was wrapped. This doesn't solve how the spdy ResponseWriter may conflict when you use other middleware that wraps it, but it could be a start\n. @pabbott0 if you have the time would you mind submitting a pull request with the implementation you have? it will be useful to have in core :)\n.

I will check this out soon\n. Sorry, my previous response was confusing with middleware vs service. `martini.Routes` is indeed a service, not a middleware.\n\nOther than the little documentation nits, this looks awesome! I really like the cleanup by removing the `routes` struct. Once those doc fixes are in I will merge this :)\n. Thanks for the contribution!\n. @BurntSushi @DisposaBoy Thanks for looking into this. Closing the issue as it is working as intended\n. The router uses regex to match so you may be able to get away with some regex cleverness\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\n> On Mar 5, 2014, at 8:41 PM, Kevin Powick notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> For a given route with a named parameter\n> \n> m.Get(\"/hello/:name\", func(params martini.Params) string {\n>     return \"Hello \" + params[\"name\"]\n> })\n> How can I ensure that the following requests will be matched to the route, but not affect the casing of the named parameter?\n> \n> /hello/Bubba\n> /HELLO/Bubba\n> /hELlo/Bubba\n> Initially, I thought I had solved route matching regardless of case by creating a simple middleware handler.\n> \n> m.Use(func(req *http.Request) {\n>     req.URL.Path = strings.ToLower(req.URL.Path)\n> })\n> Unfortunately, the above also changes the casing of named parameters.

Merging this will break some code but I think I am okay with that since this feature was merged not too long ago\n. Merging.\n. a Martini instance implements `http.Handler` so it plays nicely with the rest of the http package:\n\n``` go\nhttp.HandleFunc(\"/\", RootHandler)\n\n// martini goes under \"/api\"\nm := martini.Classic()\n// ...\nhttp.Handle(\"/api/*\", m)\n\nhttp.ListenAndServe(\":8080\", nil)\n```\n\nTry something like boom for http benching https://github.com/rakyll/boom\n. closing\n. `Map`, as well as other functionality, comes from https://github.com/codegangsta/inject package. It isn't super obvious that it comes from there though\n. This looks like a really natural extension of how martini works. I will pull this down soon and check it out. I really like the api\n. This looks great. Merging\n. I'm interested in seeing what kind of overhead this brings compared to looking up the type in the injector. I don't wish to bring in too much overhead but I do like the convention here\n. closing, as this looks like too much of a perf hit. maybe when injection is optimized a bit Il will consider it.\n. Agree with @mvader. If we want to put it in it should be optional to do so\n. Awesome! Merging\n. The router is what handles the URL. In a martini.Classic the Action is set to the martini.Router\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\n> On Mar 21, 2014, at 7:43 AM, ggaaooppeenngg notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> func (m *Martini) ServeHTTP(res http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {\n>     m.createContext(res, req).run()\n> }\n> the code seems martini serves every request with a new context,but how it dispatch url?\n> i find no more detail in context.run(). where does it do work like code below?\n> \n> m.Get(\"/\", func() {\n>   // \u663e\u793a\n> })\n> \n> m.Patch(\"/\", func() {\n>   // \u66f4\u65b0\n> })\n> I hava not clearly find out every serveHTTP runs to which part of code to match the url,and dispatch the handler.\n> Could any one show any remind?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Nice and clean. Landing\n. Yup. https://github.com/go-martini/martini#routing outlines this pretty well.\n\n```\nm.Get(\"/hello/**\", func(params martini.Params) string {\n  return \"Hello \" + params[\"_1\"]\n})\n```\n. The logger can be overridden by mapping a new logger to martini. The only problem with this approach is how the logger is used with `m.Run()` https://github.com/go-martini/martini/blob/master/martini.go#L81\n\nIf we look up the logger by getting it from the injector then I think we can have this issue solved.\n.

I updated render. I'm going to update any other packages that I am the owner of and file issues for the other packages so the respective owners can update them :)\n. This may be because of the recent move to `github.com/go-martini/martini` import path. Modifying your path in the code should solve the issue.\n. yup. that should do the trick\n. Struct embedding to the rescue!\n\nThe comments in this issue make this obvious but I will just say it for clarity. The goal of martini is to be minimal on features, but flexible enough for more specific use cases to be easily implemented via extension. It looks like in this particular case Martini gives quite a few good options for case insensitive routing :)\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\n> On Apr 1, 2014, at 6:06 PM, Andrew Gallant notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> @kpowick I know :P Just showing how you could do it cleanly with struct embedding.

A Martini Handler is a callable function. Sometimes we use a kind of Factory pattern in the code where we can return a closure as that function and utilize the parent functions arguments as configuration. Static for instance:\n\n``` go\nfunc Static(dir string) Handler {\n  return func(c martini.Context) {\n    // we now have access to the 'dir' variable\n  }\n}\n```\n. Awesome. Merging\n. There is no reason for it really. The Run() method is simply a convenience\nand http.ListenAndServeTLS is totally compatible with Martini. Perhaps we\ncould have better documentation surrounding the use of it. Otherwise I\ndon't think we can offer enough wins to justify adding another method to\nMartini\n\nOn Sun, May 4, 2014 at 2:06 PM, tarqe39 notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Hi!\n> \n> Was wondering would it be a problem to add SSL support.

Something like MARTINI_HOST would make more sense, although `os.GetEnv` is so simple that it's better to leave it up to the end-user)\n. ",

Well, the code it's still [here](https://github.com/mvader/martini/commit/76621be62da152af48684eaccd77e85806ca83ec) in case you need it :P\n\nI also think it would be better to name routes via string. For example, if you define all the routes in the main function but all the handlers are outside that file \u2014or in another package\u2014 it's a mess to get the url for a route. It happened to me when I was developing an app with Martini a few weeks ago, that's why I proposed the pull request.\n. I saw the issue #103 after submitting the PR. I will submit another one adressing that issue ASAP.\n. @codegangsta yes, that makes more sense than hardcoding if the methods match in an if statement. I will take care of it as soon as I get home.\n. @codegangsta done.\n. IMHO that belongs in martini-contrib rather than in the core framework.\n. What about passing `interface{}` rather than `string`?\n\n``` go\nm.Run(3000) // You can pass an int\nm.Run(\"3000\") // You can pass a string\nm.Run(nil) // Default port\n```\n\nAlso, you need to change line 30 of `martini_test.go` or the tests won't pass.\n. As for the redirect thing you can use the `net/http` redirect method combined with `URLFor`:\n\n``` go\nbarIDNameRoute = router.Get(\"/bar/:id/:name\", func(params Params, routes Routes) {\n                expect(t, routes.URLFor(fooRoute, nil), \"/foo\")\n                expect(t, routes.URLFor(barRoute, 5), \"/bar/5\")\n                expect(t, routes.URLFor(barIDNameRoute, 5, \"john\"), \"/bar/5/john\")\n})\n```\n. I wanted to do that but the only thing I came up with was:\n\n``` go\nimport (\n    // Here be imports\n    \"mypkg\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    // Here be code and martini initialisation\n    m.Get(\"/myroute\", mypkg.MyHandler)\n    // Here be more code\n}\n```\n\nYou still have to do the routing by yourself so it's not so helpful.\n\nSomeone correct me if I'm wrong but I think that there's no way to do what Flask does with Blueprints right now with Martini. It would be great to be able to do that, though.\n. I like this feature. Any ideas of how the interface should look like? For example, `log.Logger` and the mentioned log4go don't have the same names for their methods and, therefore, it's impossible to create an interface that works with both.\n. @BurntSushi You're right. So basically it should look like this, right?\n\n``` go\ntype Logger interface {\n    Fatal(...interface{})\n    Fatalf(string, ...interface{})\n    Fatalln(...interface{})\n    Flags() int\n    Output(int, string) error\n    Panic(...interface{})\n    Panicf(string, ...interface{})\n    Panicln(..interface{})\n    Prefix() string\n    Print(...interface{})\n    Printf( string, ...interface{})\n    Println(...interface{})\n    SetFlags(int)\n    SetPrefix(string)\n}\n```\n\nAny thoughts?\n. Closing.\n. Closing. Adressed in #205.\n. IMHO, that should be optional (some config param) or not visible at all in production.\n. You're right! I didn't think of nested groups when I submitted the PR. I will submit another one with the fix ASAP.\n. Yes, Martini should have a way to customize the logger, imho. Also, I think it is important to find a way to override the default logging middleware. Right now it can be done by creating your own martini (not using martini.Classic(), where the middleware is added).\n\nLet's wait to see what @codegangsta thinks about this.\n. Closing. Adressed in #224.\n. I've been able to reproduce this issue and will look into it ASAP to see if I can't find out why is this happening. \n. ```\n/test/(?P<id>[^/#?]+)([0-9]+)\\/? <--- Pattern\n/test/123 <--- Request path\n[/test/123 12 3] <--- Matches\n```\n\nIt does not only happen with numbers. It happens with any regex.\n\nWith somehting like:\n\n``` go\nm := martini.Classic()\n    m.Get(\"/test/:id([a-z]+[0-9]+)\", func(params martini.Params) string {\n        return \"test: \" + params[\"id\"]\n    })\n    m.Run()\n```\n\nAnd a path like `/test/abc1` it outputs `test: ab`.\n\nI've been able to fix it with an ugly hack but it broke the normal named parameters so it's not really a suitable solution.\n. Closing in favor of #222.\n. That's because static files don't use an absolute path but a relative path by default. If you use `m.Use(martini.Static(\"public\"))` it will look for the public directory under the current working directory.\n\nYou have to use an absolute path or set the path via some configuration file or something.\n. Add this after that line: https://github.com/go-martini/martini/blob/master/router.go#L140\n\n``` go\nfmt.Println(pattern)\n```\n. Not everyone might want all routes to be printed when they\u2019re not in production.

I've been trying to implement this today but I came across a few things:\n- You need context to call the not found handler (you don't have it in the router)\n- You need to call it from Routes without any param (then you don't have context. See point one).\n- Both Martini and Router have a NotFound method already so the name's not available.\n\nAny ideas?\n. I suppose there is a way to do it with context but it doesn't seem like a good approach. What was wrong with invoking NotFound when all handlers have been invoked and nothing has been written? (the other PR where this was discussed)\n. What about adding a DefaultHandler? If nothing has been written DefaultHandler will be invoked (if it is set). If DefaultHandler was not set NotFound would be invoked instead. That way you could send empty responses (that\u2019s the only use case of not sending anything to the browser that I can think of) just set `func(){}` as your DefaultHandler.\n\nOn 11 de abril de 2014 at 17:01:59, Jeremy Saenz (notifications@github.com) wrote:\n\nNothing is wrong with the other approach.

But what's the point of sending an empty response?\n\nTL;DR: 404 sounds just fine.\n. @sevkin could you resend the PR #229? I can't reopen it.\n. All the links on the site redirect to the new org, but they should be changed anyway.\n. I think you could achieve that using the BeforeFunc method on ResponseWriter https://github.com/go-martini/martini/blob/master/response_writer.go#L24\n. You could write your own ReturnHandler.\n. If you're looking for a way to test your handlers you can take a look at this topic at the martini google group https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/martini-go/NBZUvdr3KvQ\n. You could do that yourself with a middleware.\n. Merged.\n. You're right! Looks better that way. I'll push the changes ASAP.\n. @codegangsta done.\n. You can access the requested path from `*http.Request`. But it'd be nice to have access to some info about the active route.\n\n@codegangsta how about mapping in every request a `RouteInfo` that I proposed in #243 adding a Name field?\n\nIt'd look like:\n\n``` go\nm.Get(\"/admin\", sessionauth.LoginRequired, authorize, GetAdmin).Name(\"admin\")\n\nfunc authorize(user sessionauth.User, ri RouteInfo) {\n  // If the route does not have a name you can still access ri.Pattern\n   if user.IsAdmin() && ri.Name == \"admin\" {\n      // do something\n   }\n}\n```\n. Closing, it's been addressed in #250.\n. @codegangsta Ok, no prob.\n. #248 should've fix your problem.\n. Even though X-RemoteAddr seems more obvious I think that X-Real-IP and X-Forwarded-For are more commonly known.\n. Try with:\n\n``` bash\ngo get -t github.com/go-martini/martini\n```\n. @ben-joostens Try removing martini package, installing inject and then martini. That error happened when the package was moved from one repo to another, it should not be happening now.\n. IMHO, the dependency injection in martini is one of its killer features. And it's not that magical. If you map something you will get that something in your handlers. If you don't you won't.\n\nI haven't seen anything about dependency injection on the goji documentation so I suppose that's up to the developer. Meaning that you have to struggle to get your dependencies injected.\n. Closing.\n. You're using as a handler a function that returns a function. A handler can not return a function.\n\nThe handler:\n\n``` go\nfunc authorize(res http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request, c martini.Context) {\n        res.WriteHeader(http.StatusUnauthorized)\n    }\n```\n\nNow this will work:\n\n``` go\nm.Get(\"/secret\", authorize, func() {\n  // ...\n})\n```\n. I edited the readme a few hours ago adding the changes proposed in #222, make sure to include them in the translation.\n. Awesome! Merging.\n. As @codegangsta said, we should add something about serving martini over SSL on the docs. Many people have asked about that.\n. The README was updated recently, the version you translated is outdated, it lacks the regexp documentation on routes and the portugueses translation on the main README.\n. Thanks for the contribution! Merging.\n. Thanks!\n. Closing.\n. I don't think there's a better way to do this right now.\n. It's just how it works. First you find a route that matches the request and then you call the middlewares and, after them, the route handler.\n\nIf you want to do that send a redirect response.\n. You can do\n\n``` go\nif req.RequestURI == \"/\" {\n    // Invoke the handler\n}\n```\n\nIt's not as clean as a redirect but it works. Changing routing to work that way would require a redesign of martini, I guess.\n\nLet's see what @codegangsta thinks.\n. IMHO, you should include a test case for this.\n. Awesome! Merging.\n. Looks good to me. Let's see what @codegangsta thinks.\n. Awesome! Merging!\n. Buena aportaci\u00f3n. \n\nMerging.\n. Thanks! Merging.\n. Great! Could you add some how-to-use on the README before merging?\n. Not that I know of. You can always write your own context middleware.\n. Added to the list :-)\n. Jeremy's approach for Martini has always been to not include any external dependencies. The only dependency martini has is inject which he controls (so, that one is not a problem). I don't think graceful should be added if that's what you were suggesting.\n\nIf graceful works well and can be integrated with martini without any modifications to the core then I think there's no need to add that feature to the core. Just use graceful.\n\nIf this option is doable let me know and then I'll take a look at the proposal.\n. Yeah, that would be great. Maybe with an example of how to use it together with martini?\nSent using CloudMagic\nOn Thu, Oct 30, 2014 at 3:07 PM, Steven Soroka notifications@github.com wrote:It's been working well for me.

I doesn't seem like that is going to change for the time being: https://github.com/go-martini/martini/pull/245\n. @mattkanwisher in the meantime you can just map a custom logger like go-logging to Martini and add a custom logger middleware to replace the builtin one.\n. You can achieve that by yourself by sending the appropriate headers.\n. I like this idea. But before merging it you should add test coverage for this feature.\n. Looks good to me!

It's better that you add it in a global gitignore rather than adding rules in the gitignore for X and Y IDEs.\n.

I will submit another one adressing that issue ASAP.\n. @codegangsta yes, that makes more sense than hardcoding if the methods match in an if statement. I will take care of it as soon as I get home.\n. @codegangsta done.\n. IMHO that belongs in martini-contrib rather than in the core framework.\n. What about passing `interface{}` rather than `string`?\n\n``` go\nm.Run(3000) // You can pass an int\nm.Run(\"3000\") // You can pass a string\nm.Run(nil) // Default port\n```\n\nAlso, you need to change line 30 of `martini_test.go` or the tests won't pass.\n. As for the redirect thing you can use the `net/http` redirect method combined with `URLFor`:\n\n``` go\nbarIDNameRoute = router.Get(\"/bar/:id/:name\", func(params Params, routes Routes) {\n                expect(t, routes.URLFor(fooRoute, nil), \"/foo\")\n                expect(t, routes.URLFor(barRoute, 5), \"/bar/5\")\n                expect(t, routes.URLFor(barIDNameRoute, 5, \"john\"), \"/bar/5/john\")\n})\n```\n. I wanted to do that but the only thing I came up with was:\n\n``` go\nimport (\n    // Here be imports\n    \"mypkg\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    // Here be code and martini initialisation\n    m.Get(\"/myroute\", mypkg.MyHandler)\n    // Here be more code\n}\n```\n\nYou still have to do the routing by yourself so it's not so helpful.\n\nSomeone correct me if I'm wrong but I think that there's no way to do what Flask does with Blueprints right now with Martini. It would be great to be able to do that, though.\n. I like this feature. Any ideas of how the interface should look like? For example, `log.Logger` and the mentioned log4go don't have the same names for their methods and, therefore, it's impossible to create an interface that works with both.\n. @BurntSushi You're right. So basically it should look like this, right?\n\n``` go\ntype Logger interface {\n    Fatal(...interface{})\n    Fatalf(string, ...interface{})\n    Fatalln(...interface{})\n    Flags() int\n    Output(int, string) error\n    Panic(...interface{})\n    Panicf(string, ...interface{})\n    Panicln(..interface{})\n    Prefix() string\n    Print(...interface{})\n    Printf( string, ...interface{})\n    Println(...interface{})\n    SetFlags(int)\n    SetPrefix(string)\n}\n```\n\nAny thoughts?\n. Closing.\n. Closing. Adressed in #205.\n. IMHO, that should be optional (some config param) or not visible at all in production.\n. You're right! I didn't think of nested groups when I submitted the PR. I will submit another one with the fix ASAP.\n. Yes, Martini should have a way to customize the logger, imho. Also, I think it is important to find a way to override the default logging middleware. Right now it can be done by creating your own martini (not using martini.Classic(), where the middleware is added).\n\nLet's wait to see what @codegangsta thinks about this.\n. Closing. Adressed in #224.\n. I've been able to reproduce this issue and will look into it ASAP to see if I can't find out why is this happening. \n. ```\n/test/(?P<id>[^/#?]+)([0-9]+)\\/? <--- Pattern\n/test/123 <--- Request path\n[/test/123 12 3] <--- Matches\n```\n\nIt does not only happen with numbers. It happens with any regex.\n\nWith somehting like:\n\n``` go\nm := martini.Classic()\n    m.Get(\"/test/:id([a-z]+[0-9]+)\", func(params martini.Params) string {\n        return \"test: \" + params[\"id\"]\n    })\n    m.Run()\n```\n\nAnd a path like `/test/abc1` it outputs `test: ab`.\n\nI've been able to fix it with an ugly hack but it broke the normal named parameters so it's not really a suitable solution.\n. Closing in favor of #222.\n. That's because static files don't use an absolute path but a relative path by default. If you use `m.Use(martini.Static(\"public\"))` it will look for the public directory under the current working directory.\n\nYou have to use an absolute path or set the path via some configuration file or something.\n. Add this after that line: https://github.com/go-martini/martini/blob/master/router.go#L140\n\n``` go\nfmt.Println(pattern)\n```\n. Not everyone might want all routes to be printed when they\u2019re not in production. Let\u2019s see what @codegangsta thinks about this.\n\nOn 14 de abril de 2014 at 17:08:51, Harley Laue (notifications@github.com) wrote:\n\nThis might be a good one-off solution.

Looks good to me!\n. @sevkin Wait, you are the owner of this issue, you should be able to reopen it yourself.\n. @sevkin no prob.\n. I've been trying to implement this today but I came across a few things:\n- You need context to call the not found handler (you don't have it in the router)\n- You need to call it from Routes without any param (then you don't have context. See point one).\n- Both Martini and Router have a NotFound method already so the name's not available.\n\nAny ideas?\n. I suppose there is a way to do it with context but it doesn't seem like a good approach. What was wrong with invoking NotFound when all handlers have been invoked and nothing has been written? (the other PR where this was discussed)\n. What about adding a DefaultHandler? If nothing has been written DefaultHandler will be invoked (if it is set). If DefaultHandler was not set NotFound would be invoked instead. That way you could send empty responses (that\u2019s the only use case of not sending anything to the browser that I can think of) just set `func(){}` as your DefaultHandler.\n\nOn 11 de abril de 2014 at 17:01:59, Jeremy Saenz (notifications@github.com) wrote:\n\nNothing is wrong with the other approach.

Molina\nSent with Airmail\n. I think #229 is the best idea. The only case you wouldn't write anything is because you want to send an empty response. But what's the point of sending an empty response?\n\nTL;DR: 404 sounds just fine.\n. @sevkin could you resend the PR #229? I can't reopen it.\n. All the links on the site redirect to the new org, but they should be changed anyway.\n. I think you could achieve that using the BeforeFunc method on ResponseWriter https://github.com/go-martini/martini/blob/master/response_writer.go#L24\n. You could write your own ReturnHandler.\n. If you're looking for a way to test your handlers you can take a look at this topic at the martini google group https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/martini-go/NBZUvdr3KvQ\n. You could do that yourself with a middleware.\n. Merged.\n. You're right! Looks better that way. I'll push the changes ASAP.\n. @codegangsta done.\n. You can access the requested path from `*http.Request`. But it'd be nice to have access to some info about the active route.\n\n@codegangsta how about mapping in every request a `RouteInfo` that I proposed in #243 adding a Name field?\n\nIt'd look like:\n\n``` go\nm.Get(\"/admin\", sessionauth.LoginRequired, authorize, GetAdmin).Name(\"admin\")\n\nfunc authorize(user sessionauth.User, ri RouteInfo) {\n  // If the route does not have a name you can still access ri.Pattern\n   if user.IsAdmin() && ri.Name == \"admin\" {\n      // do something\n   }\n}\n```\n. Closing, it's been addressed in #250.\n. @codegangsta Ok, no prob.\n. #248 should've fix your problem.\n. Even though X-RemoteAddr seems more obvious I think that X-Real-IP and X-Forwarded-For are more commonly known.\n. Try with:\n\n``` bash\ngo get -t github.com/go-martini/martini\n```\n. @ben-joostens Try removing martini package, installing inject and then martini. That error happened when the package was moved from one repo to another, it should not be happening now.\n. IMHO, the dependency injection in martini is one of its killer features. And it's not that magical. If you map something you will get that something in your handlers. If you don't you won't.\n\nI haven't seen anything about dependency injection on the goji documentation so I suppose that's up to the developer. Meaning that you have to struggle to get your dependencies injected.\n. Closing.\n. You're using as a handler a function that returns a function. A handler can not return a function.\n\nThe handler:\n\n``` go\nfunc authorize(res http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request, c martini.Context) {\n        res.WriteHeader(http.StatusUnauthorized)\n    }\n```\n\nNow this will work:\n\n``` go\nm.Get(\"/secret\", authorize, func() {\n  // ...\n})\n```\n. I edited the readme a few hours ago adding the changes proposed in #222, make sure to include them in the translation.\n. Awesome! Merging.\n. As @codegangsta said, we should add something about serving martini over SSL on the docs. Many people have asked about that.\n. The README was updated recently, the version you translated is outdated, it lacks the regexp documentation on routes and the portugueses translation on the main README.\n. Thanks for the contribution! Merging.\n. Thanks!\n. Closing.\n. I don't think there's a better way to do this right now.\n. It's just how it works. First you find a route that matches the request and then you call the middlewares and, after them, the route handler.\n\nIf you want to do that send a redirect response.\n. You can do\n\n``` go\nif req.RequestURI == \"/\" {\n    // Invoke the handler\n}\n```\n\nIt's not as clean as a redirect but it works. Changing routing to work that way would require a redesign of martini, I guess.\n\nLet's see what @codegangsta thinks.\n. IMHO, you should include a test case for this.\n. Awesome! Merging.\n. Looks good to me. Let's see what @codegangsta thinks.\n. Awesome! Merging!\n. Buena aportaci\u00f3n. \n\nMerging.\n. Thanks! Merging.\n. Great! Could you add some how-to-use on the README before merging?\n. Not that I know of. You can always write your own context middleware.\n. Added to the list :-)\n. Jeremy's approach for Martini has always been to not include any external dependencies. The only dependency martini has is inject which he controls (so, that one is not a problem). I don't think graceful should be added if that's what you were suggesting.\n\nIf graceful works well and can be integrated with martini without any modifications to the core then I think there's no need to add that feature to the core. Just use graceful.\n\nIf this option is doable let me know and then I'll take a look at the proposal.\n. Yeah, that would be great. Maybe with an example of how to use it together with martini?\nSent using CloudMagic\nOn Thu, Oct 30, 2014 at 3:07 PM, Steven Soroka notifications@github.com wrote:It's been working well for me.

Maybe we should split this pull request and add only the changes to router.go to the core and move the Slash middleware to a another package outside the core in martini-contrib..\n. Did you send it as a pull request to martini contrib? Closing this.\n. I doesn't seem like that is going to change for the time being: https://github.com/go-martini/martini/pull/245\n. @mattkanwisher in the meantime you can just map a custom logger like go-logging to Martini and add a custom logger middleware to replace the builtin one.\n. You can achieve that by yourself by sending the appropriate headers.\n. I like this idea. But before merging it you should add test coverage for this feature.\n. Looks good to me! Let's see what @codegangsta thinks about that feature being added to the core.\n\nHappy new year to you too @wilk!\n. Group does not group by host but by a part of the path.\n.

It's better that you add it in a global gitignore rather than adding rules in the gitignore for X and Y IDEs.\n.

    "DisposaBoy": "FWIW, I don't think checking for Windows is the correct fix. Not all _nix terminals support colours and you can't assume that you're running in a real terminal, or that stderr (or stdout) is a terminal at all. And even when they are real terminals that support colours, various *hacks_ (environment variables) may be used to indicate to apps that they shouldn't output colour. There are 2 options IMO. Either check if it's a real terminal and handle the the various env vars, or don't output any escapes.\n. Why not just call `http.ListenAndServe` directly (or use `http.Server`).

I'm guessing that whatever Go installation your IDE is using it's not the expected `go1.2`, but `go1.0`\n. @elgs it's not a _feature_. It's a compile error. This is intentional. It's there to give a hint to users of `go1.0` that that version of Go is not supported.\n. @elgs No, it doesn't compile in any version of Go. If you look at the top of the file you'll see the build constraint `+build !go1.1` .. this means that in `go1.1` or `go1.2`, this whole file is ignored.

FWIW, I don't think checking for Windows is the correct fix. Not all _nix terminals support colours and you can't assume that you're running in a real terminal, or that stderr (or stdout) is a terminal at all. And even when they are real terminals that support colours, various *hacks_ (environment variables) may be used to indicate to apps that they shouldn't output colour. There are 2 options IMO. Either check if it's a real terminal and handle the the various env vars, or don't output any escapes.\n. Why not just call `http.ListenAndServe` directly (or use `http.Server`). I feel like this (patch and to a lesser extent the original Run method) is just adding an extra layer for no apparent benefit. Just sayin'\n. is the binary named `public` by any chance. e.g. you put `main.go` in a directory called `public` and then called `go build` or used a tool that does to run it\n. Are you sure you're using `go1.1.2`? you have 3rd party sources in what looks like you `GOROOT` and since `go1.1` IIRC, `go get` will refuse to install anything if your `GOPATH` isn't set or if it's set to `GOROOT` ... also this error is related to `go1`\n. that `filepath.Join` should be a `path.Join` `http.Dir` expects the path to be a url path, i.e forward-slashed\n. I don't think this compiles: `\"path/filepath\"` needs to be removed\n. Previous discussion: https://github.com/codegangsta/martini/pull/48\n. @elgs I think that's the whole idea. Update your Go installation. See http://golang.org/doc/install for instructions\n. I can't reproduce this on Linux in any of `go1.0.3`, `go1.1.2` or `go1.2`. What's the compile error\n. @elgs that code is rejected by all Go compilers regardless of the version. That file contains a build constraint that excludes it if your Go version is `go1.1` or newer. I'm guessing that whatever Go installation your IDE is using it's not the expected `go1.2`, but `go1.0`\n. @elgs it's not a _feature_. It's a compile error. This is intentional. It's there to give a hint to users of `go1.0` that that version of Go is not supported.\n. @elgs No, it doesn't compile in any version of Go. If you look at the top of the file you'll see the build constraint `+build !go1.1` .. this means that in `go1.1` or `go1.2`, this whole file is ignored. That's why you don't get a compilation error.\n.

It might be nice to have it write the response after any registered middleware handlers, that way middleware can not only modify the request, but the outgoing response, too, in the manner I described.\n.

The ResponseEncoder could need other injected components.\n- The focus of writing is shifted away from the middleware Handlers into a proprietary interface. This detracts from the flexible and dynamic nature of Martini. \n- What if I wanted to do more with the return arguments other than encode them?\n- I did not feel it was necessary to add another interface. \n\nSo I got to thinking. What bothered me is that Martini was making an assumption about the return arguments. So I came up with a way to give that control to the Handlers without adding more complexity. Basically Martini does nothing with the return arguments. It defers the responsibility to the Handlers, which is where it belongs. \n\nWhat I love about this approach is that a Handler can bind the request body before the Next() and encode the response after. It's clean, compact, and concise. I do not feel it to be magical at all.

As you've stated on the mailing list, the API is currently subject to change pre-1.0. `martini.New` also doesn't do anything with returns by itself anyway. It's just when you combine `martini.New` and `martini.Router` that's different.\n. The way I have it now the return values can be used even from handlers now within the Router. I currently use this for authentication. I have a handler that reads the Authorization header and returns an `error` when there is an error. That error has a `StatusCode() int` function on it that my response handler uses to set the code. Depending on the `error` this can result in a 401 or a 403.\n\nHere is what I'm using: https://gist.github.com/lukescott/7934533\n. [gocheck](http://labix.org/gocheck) is awesome.

It doesn't have fixtures nor assertions. You have to write more code with `testing` to write the same tests.

It's very useful when your tests fail because it provides a lot of information, like the correct line number(s) and what was obtained vs expected.

The only thing I don't like about it is line 14-15 because it has to use reflect - but that's because of inject's Get function. You'll notice that 3-8 validate the Accept header for the proper encoding. After Next() on line 10 it iterates the return values in reverse encoding the last non-nill value.\n\nI use this simply by doing:\n\nm.Map(Codec{...})\nm.Use(Writer())\n\nI can't do this at all with this implementation.\n. 1. If you haven't noticed I use http.Request to figure out what encoding to use. So I have to use a closure to get to http.Request... ok... Too bad you couldn't Invoke it somehow... You know, like how Handler works. The whole idea behind Martini.\n2. I have a big problem with exposing `reflect`. `reflect.Value` is useless in this context. I cannot pass `reflect.Value` directly into encoding/json's Encode function. I'll have to use Interface() every time. Seems rather messy to me. I'd much rather have []interface{}. You won't find many packages that do expose `reflect`, unless it's a reflect utility package.\n3. And this is a huge inconsistency with Martini. There should be no difference between how Handlers behave regardless of what context they are in. The Router routes. It shouldn't do anything more than what the base Martini does.\n4. Then call it ResponseHandler.\n\nI'm not necessarily against ResponseHandler/Encoder. The one thing I do like about it is it doesn't assume a non-zero value means stop. On the other hand I'm not sure I feel comfortable with write meaning stop either - at least the only way of meaning stop. What happens if a write fails?\n\nJust because you won't use something doesn't mean other people won't. If you wanted something explicit you would have stuck with http.HandlerFunc :). I use it to make non-http specific Handlers. And it's working beautifully.

    "BurntSushi": "I don't think we need to support both. We can make an interface that matches Go's standard library `log` package. Then if someone wants to use `log4go` as the main Martini logger, it's absolutely trivial to write your own type that embeds a `log4go` logger and provides the correct methods expected by Martini (that are actually implemented with, e.g., `log4go.Logf`).\n. Hmm. Now that `*log.Logger` can be overridden, that does kind of change things. So, just to make sure I'm getting things right, here's what I think the problem is. Martini provides, by default, its own logging middleware that does some reasonable default logging for each request. The client may want that logging to be done to a file, or have a certain prefix, or do any one of a number of other things. Before, this wasn't possible. But now that the client can provide their own `*log.Logger` value, it can be done.\n\nAs you said, a `*log.Logger` can be created with any `io.Writer`, so that means it should work with other logging systems. For example, if you're logging to stdout, then:\n\n``` go\nstdLog := log.New(os.Stdout, \"STD LOG: \", 0)\notherLog := log4go.NewConsoleLogWriter()\n// inject stdLog as *log.Logger so the middleware uses it\n// inject otherLog which we'll use in our handlers\n```\n\nThe problem I see with this is that you're forced to create a `*log.Logger` which may or may not write to the destination independently of your own logger (from, e.g., `log4go`). I suppose this could be circumvented by providing an `io.Writer` that proxies everything back through the same logger, but that seems like a kludge.\n\nThe other approach I'm thinking of is writing a much smaller `Logger` interface. Perhaps one that only has the `Print`, `Printf` and `Println` methods. This is all that's needed from within Martini's current middleware. When a client asks for a `martini.Logger`, they'll get something that can only be used to print. Which I suspect is OK. Logger options can be set by injecting your own `Logger` interface value. If you really want access to the rest of the logger, then you can type assert. But this isn't the common case I think. So for example:\n\n``` go\ntype myLogger struct {\n  log4go.ConsoleLogWriter\n}\n\n// Satisfy Logger interface\n\notherLog := log4go.NewConsoleLogWriter()\n// inject otherLog as a martini.Logger\n// which will be used in Martini's middleware and can\n// be used in our handlers.\n// If the logger guarantees that writes from simultaneous\n// goroutines are safe, then this approach is safe.\n```\n\nThe benefit of using an interface here is that it makes it easier for people to plug in other logging frameworks without having to deal with the fact that two loggers may be trying to write to the same destination simultaneously. (One and only one logger should be writing to a destination as it can avoid simultaneous writes, just like the standard `*log.Logger` does.)\n\nI think that if we go the `Logger` interface route, then the user will never actually see a `*log.Logger`. By default, the `Logger` middleware should inject some reasonable `*log.Logger` **as** a `martini.Logger`, which can now be overridden using a similar mechanism as in #224, I think.\n\nThis change would also regrettably break a lot of code, but the fix is simple. (And that fix is to just change `*log.Logger` to `martini.Logger` in your handlers. If the code is using the logger to do things other than `Print{f,ln}`, then there would need to be a type assertion.)\n. Hmm, upon more thought, I think (2) may not be easily possible.\n. Thanks. I think that should settle it then.\n. > Yup. it looks like the ideal would be to expose the martini.Routes service on the martini.Router as well as mapping it to the martini instance.\n\nHow do you want to do it? One idea is to just add the `Routes` interface to the `Router` interface. This would make it easy for people to map the service if they aren't using `martini.Classic`. However, there's a certain asymmetry to this (since users would need to use `Map` instead of `Use`), so you could also add a `Routes` function:\n\n``` go\nfunc Routes(r Router) martini.Handler {\n    return func(c martini.Context) {\n        c.MapTo(r, (*Routes)(nil))\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAlthough we'd need a different name...\n\nLet me know how you want to proceed and I'll update the PR. Maybe there are better ideas...\n\n> This still isn't the most ideal thing as it is yet another point of failure when graduating from a martini.Classic() to a martini.New() implementation. :/\n\nYeah, but I think this can be mitigated with good documentation. Users should understand that moving to New is a bit more raw. (I got that impression anyway.) Plus, the code for `Classic` is so simple that it was easy to look at and see what I would be missing out on if I went with `New`.\n. OK, I've updated the PR to expose `Routes` via the `Router` interface. I've updated documentation in a few places.\n\nI also had to modify the two tests (for methods and URLs) to add the `Routes` middleware.\n\nI didn't add any package level functions since, as you said, `martini.Routes` isn't a service.\n. Ah, right. Sorry about the mixup. Hopefully all fixed now. Thanks!\n. `martini-contrib` has moved. You should use `github.com/martini-contrib/encoder` instead.\n\nI was able to reproduce this just by using Go's standard JSON encoder:\n\n``` go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"encoding/json\"\n    \"log\"\n    \"os\"\n)\n\ntype Some struct {\n    Url string `json:\"login\"`\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    r := &Some{\"https://example.com/inbox&test=totot\"}\n    if err := json.NewEncoder(os.Stdout).Encode(r); err != nil {\n        log.Fatal(err)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\n[andrew@Liger martini] go run 195-json.go \n{\"login\":\"https://example.com/inbox\\u0026test=totot\"}\n```\n\nIt appears this is an undocumented feature of the `encoding/json` package: http://golang.org/src/pkg/encoding/json/encode.go#L815 --- it doesn't explicitly mention `&`, but it's included in line 797.\n\nAs far as I can tell, this is working as intended. The JSON spec allows for unicode characters to be escaped, so any conforming decoder should be able to read your JSON without any problems.\n\nAlso, I think you'll find [`martini.Classic`](http://godoc.org/github.com/codegangsta/martini#Classic) convenient to use.\n. @DisposaBoy Ah excellent. Thanks for the pointer!\n. You can set the case insensitive flag, which is documented in the [syntax for RE2](https://code.google.com/p/re2/wiki/Syntax).\n\ne.g.,\n\n``` go\nm.Get(\"(?i)/hello/:name\", func(params martini.Params) string {\n    return \"Hello \" + params[\"name\"]\n})\n```\n\nYou should also be able to write `\"/(?i:hello)/:name\"`, but it looks like the router code that mangles the regex to find parameter names conflicts with this syntax.\n. RE benchmark: your benchmark is failing because you aren't closing the response you get from `http.Get`.\n\n(If you do come up with a good benchmark, I'm sure a lot folks would be interested to see the results.)\n. [Yes](http://godoc.org/github.com/codegangsta/martini#Params).\n. I think thing here is to realize that the keys of `martini.Params` are taken straight from the named capture groups of the regex. As @mvader pointed out, the full regex ends up looking something like `(?P<id>[^/#?]+)([0-9]+)`. That is, `:name` is syntactic sugar for \"bind a single piece of a URL to the name `name`.\"\n\nSo to get the behavior you want, just introduce the named capture directly. Here's a full working example:\n\n``` go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"log\"\n\n    \"github.com/go-martini/martini\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    m := martini.Classic()\n    m.Get(\"/test/(?P<id>[0-9]+)\", func(p martini.Params) string {\n        return fmt.Sprintf(\"ID %s\", p[\"id\"])\n    })\n    m.Run()\n}\n```\n. I strongly disagree that everything should be case insensitive. Some might want to maintain the property that there is exactly one URL for a page. (I'm not saying everyone _should_ do this all the time, but that it's a reasonable use case.)\n\nI don't have particularly strong feelings about adding a case insensitive option to the public API, but I lean toward not. Consider that you could just wrap a `ClassicMartini` and provide case insensitivity yourself without cluttering up your routes:\n\n``` go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n\n    \"github.com/codegangsta/martini\"\n)\n\ntype ClassicInsensitive struct {\n    *martini.ClassicMartini\n}\n\nfunc (c ClassicInsensitive) Get(s string, hs ...martini.Handler) martini.Route {\n    return c.Router.Get(\"(?i)\" + s, hs...)\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    m := ClassicInsensitive{martini.Classic()}\n    m.Get(\"/hello/:name\", func(p martini.Params) string {\n        return fmt.Sprintf(\"Hello %s\", p[\"name\"])\n    })\n    m.Run()\n}\n```\n\nOf course, you'd have to wrap the other router methods too, but you get the idea.\n. @kpowick I know :P Just showing how you could do it cleanly with struct embedding. (@captncraig was rightly concerned about adding `(?i)` every time becoming a bit unwieldy.)\n. I'm not sure that you really can. The `martini.Params` service only makes sense in the context of a _matched route_, which is what determines the parameter names and values. But middleware doesn't really have any concept of which route is matched.\n\nInstead, you can achieve something similar by just adding handlers to your routes. Here's a full example:\n\n``` go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n\n    \"github.com/go-martini/martini\"\n)\n\nfunc middleware(c martini.Context, params martini.Params) {\n    fmt.Println(\"Middleware\")\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    m := martini.Classic()\n    m.Get(\"/\", middleware, func() string {\n        return \"Hello, world!\"\n    })\n    m.Run()\n}\n```\n. We should also point to the official docs describing the regular expression syntax too: http://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/\n. Firstly, `martini` has a new import path: `github.com/go-martini/martini`.\n\nSecondly, the logger is only enabled by default if you're using classic martini. If you want more fine grained control, then you can build your own custom martini. It's actually very easy. Take a look at the `ClassicMartini` function:\n\n``` go\nfunc Classic() *ClassicMartini {\n    r := NewRouter()\n    m := New()\n    m.Use(Logger())\n    m.Use(Recovery())\n    m.Use(Static(\"public\"))\n    m.MapTo(r, (*Routes)(nil))\n    m.Action(r.Handle)\n    return &ClassicMartini{m, r}\n}\n```\n\nSo you can use that function, except omit the `m.Use(Logger())` line. Here's a full working example:\n\n``` go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"log\"\n\n    \"github.com/go-martini/martini\"\n)\n\ntype myClassic struct {\n    *martini.Martini\n    martini.Router\n}\n\nfunc withoutLogging() *myClassic {\n    r := martini.NewRouter()\n    m := martini.New()\n    m.Use(martini.Recovery())\n    m.Use(martini.Static(\"public\"))\n    m.MapTo(r, (*martini.Routes)(nil))\n    m.Action(r.Handle)\n    return &myClassic{m, r}\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    m := withoutLogging()\n    m.Get(\"/\", func(lg *log.Logger) string {\n        return \"Hello, world!\"\n    })\n    m.Run()\n}\n```\n\nI think if #213 gets fixed, then this wouldn't require making your own `Martini`.\n. Ah, yes, that project has moved too :-)\n\nhttps://github.com/martini-contrib/render\n. I don't think we need to support both.

Consider that you could just wrap a `ClassicMartini` and provide case insensitivity yourself without cluttering up your routes:\n\n``` go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n\n    \"github.com/codegangsta/martini\"\n)\n\ntype ClassicInsensitive struct {\n    *martini.ClassicMartini\n}\n\nfunc (c ClassicInsensitive) Get(s string, hs ...martini.Handler) martini.Route {\n    return c.Router.Get(\"(?i)\" + s, hs...)\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    m := ClassicInsensitive{martini.Classic()}\n    m.Get(\"/hello/:name\", func(p martini.Params) string {\n        return fmt.Sprintf(\"Hello %s\", p[\"name\"])\n    })\n    m.Run()\n}\n```\n\nOf course, you'd have to wrap the other router methods too, but you get the idea.\n. @kpowick I know :P Just showing how you could do it cleanly with struct embedding. (@captncraig was rightly concerned about adding `(?i)` every time becoming a bit unwieldy.)\n. I'm not sure that you really can. The `martini.Params` service only makes sense in the context of a _matched route_, which is what determines the parameter names and values. But middleware doesn't really have any concept of which route is matched.\n\nInstead, you can achieve something similar by just adding handlers to your routes. Here's a full example:\n\n``` go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n\n    \"github.com/go-martini/martini\"\n)\n\nfunc middleware(c martini.Context, params martini.Params) {\n    fmt.Println(\"Middleware\")\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    m := martini.Classic()\n    m.Get(\"/\", middleware, func() string {\n        return \"Hello, world!\"\n    })\n    m.Run()\n}\n```\n. We should also point to the official docs describing the regular expression syntax too: http://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/\n. Firstly, `martini` has a new import path: `github.com/go-martini/martini`.\n\nSecondly, the logger is only enabled by default if you're using classic martini. If you want more fine grained control, then you can build your own custom martini. It's actually very easy. Take a look at the `ClassicMartini` function:\n\n``` go\nfunc Classic() *ClassicMartini {\n    r := NewRouter()\n    m := New()\n    m.Use(Logger())\n    m.Use(Recovery())\n    m.Use(Static(\"public\"))\n    m.MapTo(r, (*Routes)(nil))\n    m.Action(r.Handle)\n    return &ClassicMartini{m, r}\n}\n```\n\nSo you can use that function, except omit the `m.Use(Logger())` line. Here's a full working example:\n\n``` go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"log\"\n\n    \"github.com/go-martini/martini\"\n)\n\ntype myClassic struct {\n    *martini.Martini\n    martini.Router\n}\n\nfunc withoutLogging() *myClassic {\n    r := martini.NewRouter()\n    m := martini.New()\n    m.Use(martini.Recovery())\n    m.Use(martini.Static(\"public\"))\n    m.MapTo(r, (*martini.Routes)(nil))\n    m.Action(r.Handle)\n    return &myClassic{m, r}\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    m := withoutLogging()\n    m.Get(\"/\", func(lg *log.Logger) string {\n        return \"Hello, world!\"\n    })\n    m.Run()\n}\n```\n\nI think if #213 gets fixed, then this wouldn't require making your own `Martini`.\n. Ah, yes, that project has moved too :-)\n\nhttps://github.com/martini-contrib/render\n. ",

Thoughts?\n. I'm going to add an example to the [secure](https://github.com/martini-contrib/secure) contrib package which details redirecting http to https. But I think this should be part of the main readme... would something like this work:\n\n``` go\npackage main\n\nimport \"github.com/go-martini/martini\"\n\nfunc main() {\n    m := martini.New()\n    m.Use(martini.Logger())\n    m.Use(martini.Recovery())\n    m.Use(martini.Static(\"public\"))\n\n    r := martini.NewRouter()\n    m.MapTo(r, (*martini.Routes)(nil))\n    m.Action(r.Handle)\n\n    r.Get(\"/\", func() string {\n        return \"Hello world!\"\n    })\n\n    // HTTP\n    go func() {\n        if err := http.ListenAndServe(\":8080\", m); err != nil {\n            log.Fatal(err)\n        }\n    }()\n\n    // HTTPS\n    // To generate a development cert and key, run the following from your *nix terminal:\n    // go run $GOROOT/src/pkg/crypto/tls/generate_cert.go --host=\"localhost\"\n    if err := http.ListenAndServeTLS(\":8443\", \"cert.pem\", \"key.pem\", m); err != nil {\n        log.Fatal(err)\n    }\n}\n```\n. See the [secure](https://github.com/martini-contrib/secure) README.md for the http -> https documentation.\n. I suspect that you need to rebuilding / rerunning your code as Go does not live update. If you looking for live code reloading see [here](https://github.com/go-martini/martini/#live-code-reload).\n\nI pasted exactly what you have there, returned 404 as expected:\n\n```\n$ curl -v http://localhost:3000/foo\n...\n< HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found\n...\nNot found\n```\n. Hmm, you raise a good point. But I don't think this should be a bug in martini, it should probably be reported as an issue in [Go](https://code.google.com/p/go/issues/list).\n. @rjeczalik thanks for point this out! \n@Unknwon Can you create a pull request with this change?\n. @Unknwon I'm thinking `filepath.IsAbs` would be the cleanest solution.\n.
