One other thing I found is that there's a test for the presence of Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP).  This takes a VERY long time to execute.  Can it be commented out safely?  I did so, and execution time went back to the way it was in a prior version.  I'm only testing for orientation, though.. Exif-js was working perfectly in my app until just recently.
