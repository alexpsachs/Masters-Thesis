    "oesmith": "Should be fixed by f740d80c140c8f075acb72b9ee26a7e63b37af36 - I've added YYYY-MM parsing.\n\nBTW, morris.js expects data that's already been sorted newest-first (ie. the opposite order of your example above).\n\nHope that helps!\n. Heh, no worries! :)\n. GH-pages branch.\n. I've re-written it in coffee-script.  It's a _bit_ prettier.\n. Cool!  I'll merge these later.\n. I've pulled your new examples into the main source tree, and somewhat inspired by your start on the documentation, I've put up a proper site at http://oesmith.github.com/morris.js\n\nAlso note, there's been a couple of small API changes too.  Check the docs! :)\n. Thanks for this (and the Makefile too!).\n. Morris expects your data to be sorted so the most recent point is first in the array. Switching your sort order should fix your problem.\n\n(and I should probably add a .sort somewhere in the code so the order of points passed in doesn't matter)\n. No worries :)\n\n(and I've opened #10 to deal with the sorting)\n. Done in fc4ff279a5 - YAY!\n. Done in dc0a34dcbb4f906fc25705d93b33ceabb5722a5e\n. Merged - thanks!\n. I posted an update to the website an hour or so ago - it should be there by now!\n. Can't believe I missed that one - thanks!\n. Thanks.  I've merged and done a little bit of refactoring - see dc0a34dcbb4f906fc25705d93b33ceabb5722a5e\n. Yup, that's the plan. There's also some refactoring to be done in the rendering code to cope with a different date format internally.\n. Fantastic! :)\n\nI'm planning to move to proper javascript timestamps for the internal time representation, but I think this should be OK to merge in the meantime.  I'll have a proper look later.\n\nThe axis labelling needs a refactor too -- the site I originally build morris.js for was only concerned with annual data, so there's only labels at year boundaries.  In #9 I'll make the labelling a _lot_ smarter, so it should be able to work out the correct labelling intervals automatically.\n. Millisecond-accuracy timestamps are now in v0.2.5!\n. Should be fixed now in master.  A nuance in the implementation got missed when I translated to coffeescript.  Schoolboy error on my part!\n. Try sorting your data in order of newest first.  This should fix your problem.\n\nAlternatively, wait for me to close issue #10!\n. I'm currently working on doing that -- please see issue #9.\n. I'm not seeing that same behaviour here.\n\nCould you post some example code, and let me know which browser you're using?\n. [here](http://jsfiddle.net/gnEGg/) is some example code, which works fine in all the browsers I can get my hands on (even IE6).\n\nClosing this issue.\n. That's not something that I'm currently working on, but I think it's something that I'll definitely get around to doing.\n\nWatch this space!\n. This has just been done in 4fb43d5d374e8bf1c9697c40b61c1890403aa23e.\n\nI'll include it in a v0.2.4 release soon.\n. Yes, you can supply dates in YYYY-MM format and they'll render OK.\n\nHowever, the x-axis labelling code needs work to properly display dates to month accuracy along the axis. At the moment it'll only label year boundaries (this should be rectified when issue #9 is finished).\n. Excellent stuff, thanks!\n. At the moment, that's not possible -- and not currently on the roadmap either.\n\nSorry!\n. All merged - thanks!\n. Are you using integers or strings in your x-values?\n\nMorris.js will attempt to sort the incoming x-values, so it may be getting the sort order messed up if they're strings.\n. I'm not sure what you're trying to do.  Can you post some example code?\n. Try replacing\n\n```\ndata: [$graph],\n```\n\nwith\n\n```\ndata: $graph,\n```\n\nAlso ensure that jQuery's properly parsing the JSON data.  If you're using Chrome or Safari, doing a `console.log($graph);` should dump the contents of $graph to the console, and it'll show you if it's a string (bad) or an object (good!).\n. Great - glad it's working for you now!\n. Great idea - I'll stick it on my TODO list!\n. I'm working on a refactor of the hover labels at the moment.\n\nFollow my work on #134.\n. For negative values, keep your eye on issue #25 - they're on my TODO list.\n\nFor week numbers, make sure you're using at least v0.2.3, then try either formatting them as ISO standard week numbers (ie. `2012 W11`), or set the parseTime option to `false` to skip date parsing and treat your X values as an arbitrary stream.\n. Support for negative numbers has just been added in commit 4fb43d5d374e8bf1c9697c40b61c1890403aa23e\n\nIt'll get included in a v0.2.4 release soon.\n. This is done in bcc034e152534aa8c6f8e5267c77a786ebcb127e (see the units option)\n\nIt'll go into v0.2.4 too\n. None of those are currently on my roadmap.\n\nMy philosophy is to keep morris.js as simple as possible to use, so some of those features might not ever make it into the library.  You might be better served by some of the more fully-featured (and complex) graphing libraries.\n. Millisecond-accuracy timestamps are now in v0.2.5.  Checkout the updated docs at http://oesmith.github.com/morris.js/ and the example code in examples/timestamp.html.\n\nCheers!\n. Yeah, decimal values aren't very well supported at the moment. They're\nin my plan...\n\nSent from my iPad\n\nOn 9 Mar 2012, at 20:33, Pavel Shvedov\nreply@reply.github.com\nwrote:\n\n> Now Morris drows a chart like http://cl.ly/0s0p0u283Z2f3j0J0A3Z for the code like\n> \n> Morris.Line({\n>            element: 'u_price_quotes',\n>            data: [\n> \n> ```\n>                {date: '2010-11-02', value: 10.83},\n>                {date: '2010-11-03', value: 10.45},\n>                {date: '2010-11-04', value: 10.60},\n>                {date: '2010-11-05', value: 10.70}\n>        ],\n>        xkey: 'date',\n>        ykeys: ['value'],\n>        labels: ['Series A']\n>    });\n> ```\n> \n> So, the value is rounded when is displayed in the label.

I've just committed a fix for this in 634179d.  Decimal values will no longer be rounded.\n\nIt'll get included in the next release.\n. Thanks!\n\nI've got a rough idea for doing something similar (one of the graphs on howmanyleft could really do with support for partial series).  I'll keep this implementation in mind when I'm hacking :)\n. Been through this today - your code was great.  Apart from a small tweak, I've merged it straight in.\n\nThanks!\n. At the moment, decimal values will be represented in the line, but the labels are rounded.  See Issue #37.\n. Yeah, the current labelling code is nowhere near good enough to handle anything but annual data.\n\nI'm refactoring the labelling code now to be smarter about this -- to determine a labelling strategy based on the range of the x-axis (so it'll increment the labels in centuries / decades / years / months / days / hours / minutes / seconds / etc depending on what the total range is).  At the same time I'm refactoring the code to accept full javascript timestamps as x-values.\n\nYour approach so far is pretty radically different to the one I'm planning, so I'm not going to merge this code as it stands.  I'm pretty busy at the moment though, so my code's going to take a while to complete. You might be best-off working with your fork for now until mine's ready for release.\n\nHope that helps!\n. Yup, I'll keep in mind relative timestamps.  They won't be in the first drop, but I'll make sure they're on the roadmap (which reminds me, I really should keep a roadmap in these issues!) :)\n. xlabelMargin as an option: great.\n\nYour xlabels, however, aren't ready to be merged.  A complete solution to the labelling challenge needs two further problems solved:\n- _Automatically_ choosing the correct label steps --  If the label margin is 20 px, the width of the x axis is 200 px and the timespan is 10 years, the labels should be years.  If the timespan is a week, then they should be days.\n- The label formatting should make it obvious what the label means.  If it's months, then labelling \"2012-01\" or \"Jan\" gives the right context to understand the label. \"01\" does not.\n\nThanks for the contribution.  I hope we can solve these problems and get some awesome xlabel formatting!\n. Great stuff, but this isn't quite ready to merge yet.\n- Camel-case formatting on the options, please -- that means they should be `drawXLabels` and `drawYLabels`.  Also check your code, there's a mix of drawYlabel and drawYlabel**s**, so Y-axis labelling is broken in this commit.\n- When the labelling is disabled, can you set the bounds of the drawing area to fill the element (rather than having empty space where the labels _would_ have been).\n. This only reads the year, month, day, hour and minute parts of the time spec.  Would it not be easier to just add an optional 'T' to the middle of the regexp for YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM type?\n. I've just pushed a fix in 18b4191 - let me know if it works for you!\n. Thanks for the bug report!\n\nI've just committed a fix in b3ab944 - hopefully everything should be working for you now.\n. Looks great -- it's a good intermediate step towards getting properly 'magic' date/time labelling on the x-axis.\n\nI'll give it a whirl this evening and if it all works well, I'll merge it :)\n. Yeah, I've been considering using moment.js -- but if possible I'd like to get a solution that doesn't need another external dependency.\n. This code wasn't quite in line with the direction I've taken with my own code, so I've skipped merging it.\n\nHowever, my automatic x-labelling code is now merged into master -- see commit fc4ff279a5.  Let me know if it works for you guys!\n. I'm not quite sure what you're attempting to do -- I think the best way to explain this to me is in code, so do please go ahead and submit a pull request! :)\n. Sorry, that's not something that I've any real need for at the moment.\n\nIf you'd like, feel free to contribute some code and I'll consider including it!\n\nAlternatively, g.raphael can make use of the same dependencies as Morris.js and draw pies too.\n\nThanks,\n\nOlly\n. I'm totally an advocate of using Highcharts for complicated stuff too, but area charts shouldn't be complicated to add to morris.js -- I'll add them to my TODO list! :)\n. Ok, you guys win - area charts are the next thing I'll be adding to Morris. Watch this space :+1:\n. OK, area charts are now in master.\n\n[This example](https://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/blob/master/examples/area.html) shows you how it works.\n\n![example image](http://olly.oesmith.co.uk/~oliver/github/morris_area.png)\n. Any reason why you can't use YYYY-MM-DD HH:_00_ ? ;)\n. I've merged this, with one small change.  Local time is used when neither zulu time nor an offset are specified.\n\nThanks for your contribution!\n. This is in now -- I've made a couple of small tweaks that will affect you when you pull in the latest master branch.  Make sure you take a look at the last couple of commits.\n\nThanks loads for the contribution!\n. It's in!  I've made a small change to use camel-case (so the options become `preUnits` and `postUnits`), and a small refactor - see fa8f8c6.\n\nThanks again!\n. Currently, I think Morris.js only properly handles continuous series -- ie. there can be null values at the beginning and end of a series, but not in the middle.\n\nThe difficulty here is in deciding what the behaviour should be for null values -- I presume you need the line plot to be continuous (rather than have gaps where the null values are)?\n. This should be A-OK now.  Let me know if it's working for you.\n. Can you send me an example/jsfiddle showing this?\n. I can't reproduce this at all.  Changing CSS widths on the containing element in all my examples changes the corresponding width of the graph. Closing this issue.\n. Yeah, the current implementation uses a single tooltip which it moves around and rewrites the labels when you hover different points.  Refactoring that won't be straightforward...\n\nBest of luck -- don't forget to send a pull request when you get it working!\n. This is in, although I've removed the deep copy in favour of a shallow one (the only destructive change to the data array is sorting, so a deep copy was overkill).\n\nSee 942e121\n. Hi!\n\nThanks for the pull request....\n\n... however, there's no code changes needed to support more than 7 lines.  The default config for line colours in morris.js only contains 7 colours, so all you need to do is pass your own `lineColors` config parameter with the number of lines that you need.\n\nSee here: http://jsfiddle.net/MKhdW/\n\nHope that helps!\n. Merged at last - thanks!\n. Thanks guys - have fixed in aa67b1a and released 0.2.9.\n. Fixed in aa67b1a. Thanks!\n. Like some other pull requests I've cleared out today, I'm not convinced this one's worth the test/maintenance overhead.\n\nClosing.\n. This should be fixed now in master, and it'll be released in v0.2.10.\n. I've had a hack at this today, and I've added a setData() method to Morris.Line.  Take a look at [the 'updating' example](https://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/blob/master/examples/updating.html) to see how it works.\n\nCurrently this is just on the master branch, but I'll include it in the next release (v0.2.10).  Let me know if it solves your problem.\n. Right now there's no code to support resizing the graph, so I'd expect 'odd' behaviour when resizing.\n\nCan you send me a jsfiddle that reproduces the container width and height problems you're experiencing?\n. Thanks! I've merged and released this in 0.2.10.\n. This is fixed on master now.\n\nI also recommend using an `auto N` value in the `ymax` and/or `ymin` options, so you can set the range that the graph will show when there's absolutely no variance in the data values.\n. Those kinds of requirements are way ahead of Morris.js right now. I suggest you take a look at D3.js, which would do a far better job of satisfying them.\n\nOlly\n. `xLabelFormat` is the option you're looking for (see the docs for more info).  `dateFormat` doesn't affect the x-axis labels because of the automatic 'smart' labelling it uses to work out the most suitable labels for the x-axis date range.\n\n(so bear in mind if you change `xLabelFormat` to always display `DD. MM. YYYY.`, it won't look so great when the date range isn't suitable for labels of that granularity)\n\nHTH\n\nOlly\n. You may need to delay rendering until the containing element is visible on-screen.

This should be fixed in v0.3.0 (available to download now).\n. You're nearly there with removing the quotes from `value` -- Morris.js requires numerical values in that field.\n\nTry using a helper (or maybe a decorator?) to map #to_i against the values.\n. Something like the following, perhaps?\n\n``` ruby\n# in application_helper.rb\ndef donut_json\n  @result_donut.map { |x| {:label => x[:label], :value => x[:value].to_i} }.to_json.to_s.html_safe\nend\n```\n\n.. and then, in your view\n\n``` html\n<script>\nMorris.Donut({\n  element: 'donut',\n  data: <%= donut_json %>\n});\n</script>\n```\n\n_Disclaimer: this is quick and dirty code, so you may want to tidy/reorganise it as you see fit._\n. I've just pushed a solution to master.  You can now pass a function to `Morris.Donut` to format the value however you need to.  Grab the latest `morris.min.js` and give this a go:\n\n``` javascript\nMorris.Donut({\n  element: 'donut',\n  data: /* your data here */\n  formatter: function (x) { return Math.floor(x / 60) + ':' + Morris.pad2(x % 60) }\n});\n```\n\n_Disclaimer: again, a quick+dirty solution - feel free to customize the formatter to fit your needs :)_\n. You can use `xLabelFormat` to add a custom formatter for date labels.\n. The graphs won't draw properly if their container has 'display: none'.  I've worked around this in my bootstrap sites by listening for the 'shown' event on the tab and only initialising charts in the event handler.\n\nHTH!\n\nOlly\n. Try adding `lineColors` to your config with enough colors for all of your series (I think the default config only supports a maximum of 8ish series before it runs out of colors).\n. That last commit removes the `lineColors.length >= ykeys.length` requirement.  It'll cycle color values when they run out.\n. Grab the latest master, then calling `select(n)` on the object that `Morris.Donut(...)` returns.\n\nI've just added some code that _should_ do what you need.\n. Whoops - my fault for coding too late at night! :)\n\nTry again now - should be fixed.\n. Try the latest master, I've slightly modified the ymin/ymax behaviour.  FWIW, I recommend setting `ymax` to `auto N` in these situations (where `N` is a sensible number for your dataset).\n. No problems - I'm glad it's working for you.\n\nCheers!\n\nOlly\n\nOn 26 Sep 2012, at 21:47, Monica Olinescu notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nThanks for the quick fix.

I'm gradually working towards getting more charts in - if you've got some specific ideas for what you'd like to see, I'd be glad to see some mockups or similar designs (or even better, some code!).\n\nI'd avoided including legends in the donut chart because the legend can quickly overwhelm the chart. The donut chart should be a _very_ simple overview of the data, and if you need more information alongside it, I'd recommend adding a table or a different kind of visualisation so that its easily readable and accessible.\n. Thanks to the enthusiasm in the other thread, area charts are next on my list of priorities. Once they're out of the way I'll start investigating bars! :+1:\n. OK, basic support for bars are in now too! See #101 for details.\n. Radars are a pain in the ass (and I'm not convinced they work well on the web), so I'd rather keep them out of morris completely.\n\nGauges are more interesting. They're pretty simple, so should be a quick-ish job to complete. I'll add a separate issue to discuss them.\n\nClosing this issue now, since it's dragged on for a looooooooooooong while.\n. Nice one - thanks!\n. Good spot!  I guess I was just lucky that all my graphs with `parseTime: false` so far have had ordered x-keys :)\n. What are you sending to Morris in the `element` option?\n. Is there a `<div id='stocks_chart' ... >` on your page?\n. Are you running the javascript that calls Morris.Line on pages that _don't_ contain `#stocks_chart`?\n\nMaybe move the call to Morris.Line inside an if statement that checks for the presence of `#stocks_chart` on the page?\n. If you're using rails assets, then it's likely that script will be on every page, yes.  I'd recommend keeping it in your assets folder, but use an `if` statement to stop it from executing on the wrong pages.\n\nSomething like this:\n\n``` coffee-script\njQuery ->\n  if $('#stocks_chart').length\n    Morris.Line\n      element: 'stocks_chart'\n      data: $('#stocks_chart').data('stocks')\n      # ...\n```\n. Are your YYYY time stamps strings or numbers?\n\nMorris will parse strings as years, and numbers as numeric time stamps.\n\nCan you give me an example (using jsbin or similar) of where the code doesn't work?\n. I'm not quite sure I understand the problem. Can you replicate it with some code on jsbin.com or jsfiddle.net and reply with the link?\n. I've changed that first jsbin slightly to insert some dummy data rather than call the PHP code, and it appears to be working fine (I see x-axis labels)\n\nhttp://jsbin.com/igasid/10/edit\n\nDoes that work for you?\n. Try using `xLabels: \"hour\"` - if you force it to use day labels and the data doesn't span any boundaries between days, then you'll get no labels on the x axis.\n. Hmm.. not sure why that's happening.\n\nCan you paste in here the output of console.log(colors)?\n. I'm not sure what to suggest here -- I'm unable to reproduce that behaviour.\n\nCan you check out this jsfiddle and try to get it to show the bug?\n\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/bTR3j/1/\n.

It should make the code a _lot_ simpler and much easier to customise.\n\nWhen I get around to refactoring the hover like I did the grid, then I'll definitely be HTML-ifying it.\n. I've completed the HTML hover refactor, and you can now update the hover content dynamically with an event handler.

I'll be documenting the entire process shortly when I release v0.4.\n\nClosing this issue.\n.

I'd almost be tempted to take an approach similar to the donut chart of only showing the label for the currently selected segment.  After all, a pie chart is just an aid to visualise some tabular data -- so if _all_ of the data is important, you'd have the table alongside the pie chart on the same page...\n\nHope that helps!\n\nOlly\n. A side-comment regarding zero values:\n\nThe 'safe' behaviour for the donut chart is to show zero values as very thin slices so they can be hovered and a zero value can be shown to the end user.\n\nIf you're convinced that your charts shouldn't show zero values (I'm not), then I recommend you remove those values before passing them to the chart to render.\n. Printing isn't a use case I've considered at all when building Morris.js. Does it work at all?\n\nI'm closing this PR, since it's gone stale.\n. What have you tried so far?\n\nPost a link to your code so far on a [jsbin](http://jsbin.com) or [jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.com) and I'll take a look to see if I can work out what you've missed.\n. Yes, in the current version of Morris.js, you'll need to convert those `d` values to millisecond timestamps for `dateFormat` to take effect.\n\n(See also #90, which is for adding support for formatting string values in x labels)\n. Sorry, I meant the `d` values in your `data` should be timestamps in order for `dateFormat` to work.\n\n_Anyway_, I've commited a fix for #90 this morning that should help here.  If you grab the latest version from master, then the following code should work (note the value that is passed to the `dateFormat` callback is a timestamp, not a Date).\n\n```\nMorris.Line({\n  element: 'chart',\n  data: [\n    {d: '2012-10-18', w: 0, n: 1, t: 1 },\n    {d: '2012-10-17', w: 0, n: 1, t: 1 },\n    {d: '2012-10-15', w: 1, n: 0, t: 1 },\n  ],\n  xkey: 'd',\n  ykeys: ['w', 'n', 't'],\n  xLabelFormat: function(d) {\n    return d.getDate()+'/'+(d.getMonth()+1)+'/'+d.getFullYear(); \n  },\n  xLabels:'day',\n  labels: ['Winners', 'Non-winners', 'Total'],\n  lineColors: ['#167f39','#990000', '#000099'],\n  lineWidth: 2,\n  dateFormat: function (ts) {\n    var d = new Date(ts);\n    return d.getYear() + '/' + (d.getMonth() + 1) + '/' + d.getDay();\n  }\n});\n```\n\nLet me know if that works for you.\n. The `ts` value is just a parameter on the `dateFormat` function (the name doesn't matter, you could call it purple_elephants if you wanted).\n\nIf you grab the latest Morris.js code from the github repository, you won't need any more timestamp data.\n. Can you try with the latest master version? I've done some refactoring recently which should have fixed this issue.\n. The hover is designed to _replace_ a fixed legend. I really don't see the value in having a partial hover and adding a legend -- it's putting redundant data on the screen.\n\nDo you see what I mean?\n. As I see it, the hover _is_ showing necessary information (the series colors), even when it isn't showing values for some series.  There is an argument for making the hover less noisy and/or easier to scan when there are missing values though.\n\nIf you're keen to show a legend alongside the chart, then you can access the colors array from the `.options.lineColors` property on the object that `Morris.Line` returns.\n\n``` javascript\n\nvar chart = Morris.Line(/* ... */);\nconsole.log(chart.options.lineColors); // ['#0b62a4', '#7A92A3', ...]\n```\n. I've already switched \"n/a\" for \"-\" in the hover, but I'm still not happy that it's the _right_ solution. I think it could do with some table-alignment of the series labels and values to make it a little prettier.... :confused:\n. If you resize the element that contains the graph and call `redraw()` on the object returned by `Morris.Line`, the graph should be redrawn to fit.\n\nSee the documentation for [`window.onresize()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.onresize) to see how you hook into resize events in javascript.\n\n_Note: I suggest you call redraw() sparingly as it's quite an expensive operation. Try using a setTimeout trick or similar to avoid calling it for intermediate resize events._\n. That's great, thanks!\n\nI'm working on area charts (and beefing up the test suite) at the moment, which is why there's been so much refactoring recently.  I'll try to get this integrated as soon as the area charts are done.\n\n:+1:\n. It's not possible right now, but I'm currently working on it.  See #47.\n. Right now that's not possible, but it's a sensible feature to add.\n\nI'll leave this issue open as a reminder.  Thanks!\n. Closed with #103\n. Cool!\n\nI'm going to hack on this now. I'm thinking of changing the way the x-axis scaling works for bar graphs. Instead of doing a straight time-based interpolation, I'd rather split the chart into equal-sized blocks for each entry in options.data. This should mean we don't need the padding calculations..\n. OK, take a look at e4f4594.  I've taken your work and pared it right down to the absolute bare essentials, removing some unnecessary bits that were leftover from Morris.Line and refactoring anything relating to horizontal positioning.\n\nTo keep the basic functionality of the bar chart clear, I've removed some of your new additions. I've no objections to any of them, I'd just like to build up the features incrementally from a _really_ solid base.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n![Screenshot](http://olly.oesmith.co.uk/~oliver/github/bars1.png)\n.

Honestly, I'm not convinced this is a _really_ necessary core addition to the library. Everybody wants their own combination of weird and wonderful coloring for their bar charts, and this only covers one aspect. My preference would be to make it _completely_ flexible, and make `options.barColors` able to accept a function that generates the correct colors.\n\nSomething like:\n\n``` javascript\nbarColors: function (data, type) {\n  // data: series name/index, x / y values\n  // type: 'hover' or 'bar'\n  if (type === 'hover') {\n    // generate a hover color\n    // ...\n  }\n  else if (type === 'bar') {\n    // generate a bar fill color\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n```\n. I've added the callback code now -- take a look at 236afa4.\n. Looks good to me :+1:\n\nA couple of notes:\n- Math.min / Math.max will treat a null as a zero, so you need to be careful of passing nulls\n- I'm trying to move away from using $.map towards using coffee-script list comprehensions wherever possible (they look tidier to me :grinning:)\n\n(see 8faced7 for the changes I made when merging)\n. There's a lot of overlap in functionality between this and Morris.Donut.

IMHO, the _ideal_ behaviour would be:\n- a `null` value breaks the line\n- an `undefined` value _does not_ break the line\n\nTo maintain backwards compatibility, this new behaviour will need to be off by default.

Finally getting around to looking at this. Looking pretty damned good so far!\n\nHowever, I'm not sure there's any justification for the multiple inheritance (or composition) code here - the hover methods could be declared directly on Morris.Grid, couldn't they?\n.

First check the element is present on the page before attempting to draw it.  \n\n`if ($(\"#element-id\").length > 0) { .... }` will help.\n. ... and the other chart?\n. This has been fixed in master. Closing.\n. Yup, this is definitely out of scope for morris.js.\n. I've done some refactoring, beefed up the tests a little and merged broken-lines into master.\n\nSee d41bea2 for my changes. It's nothing huge - just a little tidying in the tests, and a refactor to createPath & gradients to handle leading and trailing null values.\n\nCheers! :+1:\n. _I've written this comment elsewhere, but here it is again:_\n\nThe 'safe' behaviour for the donut chart is to show zero values as very thin slices so they can be hovered and a zero value can be shown to the end user.\n\nIf you're convinced that your charts shouldn't show zero values (I'm not), then I recommend you remove those values before passing them to the chart to render.\n.

OK, feel free to add new stuff, but you need to support the existing behaviour before I'll consider merging it.\n. Oh, and _please_ try to add some tests when you're adding new features.\n\nI'm disappointed with the existing test coverage in Morris.js, and slamming in new features with no tests isn't helping. :cry: \n. I'm currently working on a complete refactor of the hover code - which will include this feature - so I won't be merging this PR. Please follow my progress on #134.\n. Again, this will be covered by the HTML hover refactor. Follow #134.\n. Fixed and online now. All caused by a single comma! (6ecb432)\n. This PR is next on my list to review. It may require some re-work now that the html hover code is in master (it could be useful to use the new `hitTest` methods on line and bar charts, for example).\n\nAnyway, I promise to review this one soon!\n. It's also worth noting that Raphael will generate VML markup for versions of IE that do not have native SVG support, so CSS classes and DOM events aren't going to work for us there.\n. Yeah, it totally sucks. It's the reason why Morris uses Raphael and isn't just another wrapper around D3 :frowning:\n. OK, this is pretty much all done now, except documentation.  Since the docs are going to go on the gh-pages branch (and won't be published until the v0.4.0 release), I'm merging this PR into master now.\n. Please add any changes to the coffeescript source file (in this case, `lib/morris.donut.coffee`).  I can't accept pull requests that modify the compiled javascript directly. :-1:\n\nFWIW, this is inconsistent with the existing `colors` option for donut charts. For consistency, I'd rather the option here was a `labelColors` array containing a color value for each data row (or similar).\n. See the solution in #139. This will be released in v4.0!\n. Merged! :+1:\n\nI've removed the prefix and suffix options from the formatter callback -- there's little point in pushing user-supplied data back in the callback arguments when it can be whatever the user wants within the callback itself!\n. OK, this is now merged. I have altered the options as follows:\n- _grid_ (true/false) controls rendering of the grid lines\n- _axes_ (true/false) controls rendering of the axis labels\n\nAgain, thanks for the PR! :+1:\n. Could you implement this feature for your charts using the new `hoverCallback` feature instead? It's currently undocumented, but see the example in `decimals-custom-hover`.\n\nI'm not sure this is a common enough use case to justify adding the extra complexity to the core library.\n. Honestly, my gut reaction is that just isn't a great chart.\n\nI want to keep Morris.js simple, so I'm pushing back on more features recently. If you want to do this with Morris.js, I suggest you find an alternative way of showing that data. Otherwise look at Highcharts or something in the D3 ecosystem.\n. I've rejected this #148, so I'm closing this one too.\n. There will _not_ be a placeholder by default in morris.js it's up to you to provide a _meaningful_ message to your users that fits the formatting of your site.\n\nHowever, if there's an issue where an empty data object breaks the chart with setData, then we should fix that.\n. Love it :+1:\n. I'm going to take a DHH-style stand on this and say I don't particularly care for rounded corners, and I don't think the benefits are worth the maintenance and test overhead of having this in the codebase. Hence I'm rejecting this pull request.\n\n_However_, I'd be very interested in any pull requests that improve the x-labelling. I'd _like_ to see something that enables angled or vertical labels in order to fit more labels along the x-axis. **If** I find the time between my Googley responsibilities, I may have a go at this code, but I'd very happy to receive a pull request if you're keen :)\n. There's definitely some readability and testability benefits to encapsulating this drawing code into methods, but (as has been said already), a separate class isn't the place for these. I'd rather see them declared on the class that owns the drawing operations (`drawBar` on Morris.Bar, etc).\n\nMake sense?\n. This is merged - thanks for the contribution! :+1:\n. Merged, with a small tweak.\n. Again, I'm going to take a stand and say I don't think this is a valuable _enough_ feature to be worth the maintenance and test overhead of including it in the repo. IMHO if you want to create multiple stacked columns, you need to re-think your visualisation ideas...\n. Two reasons:\n1. Since joining Google I've had a lot less spare time to spend on Morris.js.  Big PRs are more time-consuming to review and merge, especially where there's a number of dependent new features being added.\n2. I don't think moving the label outside of the donut is a good direction to move in. It certainly doesn't fit the use case I have for donuts.\n. My philosophy for Morris.js is for it to be a _simple_ charting library. It's the one you reach for when you want to do something quick and simple, without sacrificing aesthetics.\n\nFeatures like milti-dimensional donut charts and rich interactivity are beyond that philosophy. I'd very much prefer people to be using more advanced visualisation libraries like D3.\n. Closing this as a dupe of #162.\n. Why have this feature as well as events?\n\nIMHO, it's feature bloat. Morris.js is all about minimalism and simplicity. Do it right _one_ way, or not at all.\n. I'm not sure this is something that's absolutely necessary for Morris.\n. A few comments:\n- I'd rather see pull requests with a single feature - it makes it easier to merge quickly and focus discussion.\n- I'm not sure I see the point of customising the hover CSS prefix. It's already sufficiently namespaced to not conflict with other libraries, and you can have different CSS in different charts by using parent selectors. It seems like a waste of code to me.\n- I like the idea of changing the gravity of the hover box, but I'm not sold on being able to overflow the container - I'd like to retain the old constrained behaviour and make the overflow optional.\n. OK, I think I'll take a pass on this pull request.\n. That's not really possible at the moment. The best you can currently do is a bar chart with multiple data series alongside each other..\n. Please make changes against the coffee-script, not the javascript files.\n\nThe javascript is automatically generated from the coffee-script.\n. Yes, there's definitely scope to improve this code. Fudging the line numbers is _not_ the right answer though. The graph bounds need to be calculated more intelligently and so do the numLines.\n. See also #168.\n. I'll add it to my todo list.\n\nFWIW, I'll be uploading a change with new y-axis labelling this weekend,\nwhich I'd appreciate you all testing!\nOn Thu, Mar 28, 2013 at 5:44 PM, t3chn0r notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Not sure if there's been any work on this but I was looking for an option\n> to only have int numbers on the Y-Axis and couldn't find anything.

Try debugging the values you're passing to morris.js. I suspect they'll be strings and you'll need to `parseInt(x, 10)` them, or something similar.\n.

Yeah, I'd strongly suggest not adding any new chart types for v0.5 - there's plenty of new code already that needs to be documented and released.\n\nAnd for pie charts, well, I've yet to see a beautiful pie chart on the web, and none of the attempts for morris.js so far appear to be any better than the norm. :cry:\n\nI'd be very happy if anyone had any good ideas for making pie charts attractive though!\n. Even that one seems pretty dull. The pie chart itself is incredibly easy (there's already great examples in g.raphael). The difficult part is getting the labelling or legend to work elegantly, which I don't think ember charts have solved yet, unfortunately.\n. Definitely. I think it'd be great to have a choice of horizontal, diagonal or vertical labels.\n. There's a drawXAxis method (or something similar - I don't have the code in\nfront of me to refer to) in Morris.Line and Morris.Bar that handles the\nactual drawing, which is the majority of the code.\n\nThere's also some code somewhere that calculates the height of the x-axis\nlabel area (I think this is in Morris.Grid at the moment), which will\nprobably need significant refactoring to deal with rotated labels.\n\nOlly\n\nOn 27 Jan 2013, at 14:41, James Seigel notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nAny idea what that would take or where I'd have to look to poke at that\npart of the code?\n\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on\nGitHubhttps://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/issues/173#issuecomment-12754973.\n.

I'd suggest using a table as a legend, and assigning colors to your donut segments to match the table.\n\nTrying to hover labels over donut segments is a huge waste of screen space..\n. Interesting -- I'd guess a rounding issue too.\n\nCan you post a jsbin or similar that shows this behaviour?\n. Fixed!\n. Fixed - thanks!\n. I can't merge this because you've modified the compiled javascript rather than the original coffeescript.\n\nHowever, I've ported the fix back to the coffeescript and it's on master now.\n\n Thanks!\n. Hmmmmm.. very interesting. Can you reproduce the problem in a jsbin (or similar)?\n. Whoah! That's the first time I've seen Chrome get stuck like that. I'd guess that's something upsetting the Chrome renderer itself -- usually if a bit of javascript gets stuck in an infinite loop then the tab can usually detect that and kill itself.\n\nI'll see if I can ask the Chrome dev team at work tomorrow if they have any ideas..\n. Nice one! Top debugging effort there!\n\nOn 7 March 2013 10:27, kidplug notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> The hang in my app is occurring in labelSeries but NOT due to negative\n> pxwidth!\n> Analyzing now...\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/issues/191#issuecomment-14552446\n> .\n.

Apologies -- the hideHover behaviour changed in v0.4.0. I've updated the docs to show the correct options.\n.

What do you mean by 'control the number of ticks created'?\n. I think it's the x label rendering causing an issue here - it tries to\nmaintain a margin between labels and will skip a labeled its too close to\nits neighbours. You can reduce the margin using the (undocumented)\nxLabelMargin option.\n\nAlternatively, upgrade to v0.4.3 and use the new xLabelAngle option to draw\nthe labels diagonally, which allows more labels in the same space.\nOn Mon, May 13, 2013 at 9:26 AM, Eirik Hoem notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> My Y axis is a count (number of sales for example) while the X axis is\n> ProductIDs (A,B,C,D,E,F).

When hideHover is true, the legend should not be displayed at all, hence there's no need to hide it.\n\nIf the legend is on-screen at all when hideHover == true, then we have a different problem...\n.

Thanks for the PR, but there's already a copy of raphael.js in spec/vendor/.\n\nI'll switch the examples to use that one instead..\n. Add `parseTime: false` to the chart options. By default, morris expects a time-series and will sort the data it's given (and since your x-values are strings, they don't get sorted numerically).\n. There's a solution in master now. See #111.\n. I'm not entirely sure how this error happened -- it shouldn't be tracking movement on anything outside of the graph element. Can you send me a jsbin that demonstrates the broken behaviour?\n\n(FWIW, if we really do need to filter these events, it's best to do it on the base event handlers in morris.grid.coffee).\n.

IME, something like a `$(\"#metrics_chart\").clear()` call before drawing the new chart should be sufficient to clear the div.\n\nIf you're using resize, there may be a memory leak linked to he redraw event handler -- but I'll try to verify and fix that before the next stable release.\n\nEdit: s/redraw/resize\n. There are `pointFillColors` and `pointStrokeColors` that you can use to customize the appearance of points.\n\nThere's nothing to customize line segments yet though. I'm not sure it'd be an easy job either, I _think_ it'd require separate lines for each segment (rather than one continuous line string as we have now).\n\nPhilosophically, I'd very much rather morris.js provided a generic solution for customising the line/point appearance, rather than having application-specific presets like `first/lastDataPointIncomplete`.\n. Morris.js is optimised for row set-type data sets, like database tables.  Completely independent series is something it won't support without a major rewrite. I suggest, for now, you look for another charting library if this feature is crucial for you.\n. Exactly as @sudodoki has said. I can't run this project alone any more.

I think the xLabels config option would probably help here.\n\nSee docs: http://morrisjs.github.io/morris.js/lines.html\n. I'd rather users built their legends using their own data, as supplied to the `barColors` and `labels` attributes of the config object on the `Morris.Bar` constructor.\n\nI don't see much value in a callback that gives a user back the exact same data that they've already supplied to us.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n. I think we should concentrate on getting the behavior right for v0.5.\n\nThat means, imho, we should at least deprecate `continuousLine`.\n\nIf possible, I'd like the area chart to also make the area non-contiguous on null values.\n. Yeah, that's kind of what I was thinking of. I'll try to make another\niteration on that idea this week. I'll reply to this issue when I have\nsomething to share.\n\nThanks!\nOn Sat, Feb 15, 2014 at 9:48 pm, sudodoki notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Okay, that's how far I got\n> http://embed.plnkr.co/uVkyfNWA2kp2mB3lVfYZ/\n> Changes to code to achieve above plnkr result are\n> sudodoki@47ddf33https://github.com/sudodoki/morris.js/commit/47ddf33fa6872b697ce30904ace60b8af445b9d4\n> @oesmith https://github.com/oesmith I would appreciate your judgement\n> on how to handle this area smooth best.\n> \n> ## \n> \n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/347#issuecomment-35168983\n> .\n. OK, I've done some hacking on this today. I've no code to share, but here's my thinking so far:\n1. When behaveLikeLine is true, everything should behave exactly like a line chart. Since this is so similar to the line chart, I'm tempted to deprecate behaveLikeLine and move the code to fill the area beneath lines to an option on Morris.Line.\n2. Undefined values _cannot_ be spanned in default area charts. Stacking just doesn't work when the values are out of step.\n3. Null values in area charts should break the series, and values above should step down at the break point.\n\nCode to follow...\n.

Thanks!\n. Just merged -- sorry for the wait!\n. I'm not sure I understand what you need. Can you explain (or draw it) for me?\n\nThanks!\n. I'm not sure I understand your problem. Can you create an example using http://jsbin.com?\n. Ooops, looks like I forgot to add that option to the docs!\n\nI've update the doc site at http://morrisjs.github.io/morris.js/lines.html -- look for the xLabelAngle option.\n\nCheers!\n. If you use numeric type arguments, then it'll be interpreted as a timestamp -- in this case, your max time being interpreted as 8.5ms (and unfortunately there's no labelling scheme yet for timespans that small).\n\nI think the easiest way to get this to act as expected is to translate your values into numeric millisecond timestamps or ISO date strings.\n. Yeah, there's unfortunately no unbinding on the resize handler currently. I'll see what I can do to fix this..\n. What you're describing is a scatter plot, not a line chart. Morris.js doesn't support scatter plots, I'm afraid.\n. Try using setTimeout instead of setInterval. setInterval will continue calling the code every 2 seconds until the tab is closed. setTimeout will only update once.\n. JQuery.getJSON is an asynchronous method, so you need to use the success callback to get the result. For your example, you want to use something like the following code:\n\n``` js\n$.getJSON(\"lead_volume\", function (data) {\n  Morris.Line({\n    data: data,\n    element: \"lead_volume\",\n    xkey: \"date\",\n    ykeys: [\"total\"],\n    labels: [\"Total\"],\n  });\n});\n```\n. Yes, that's a somewhat deliberate limitation. If your chart has no data, I would assume your users would prefer to see a friendly message rather than a blank div. Morris does not have a default \"no data\" message to force chart creators to supply a contextually-relevant message of their own.\n. What do you mean by disable? Do you want to disable all interactivity?\n. That's something I would expect your event handlers to deal with. You would just need a 'busy' flag in your event handler to tell it to ignore events if a load is in progress.\n\nAs an aside, and apologies if I'm second-guessing your motives -- wouldn't it be better for your users to support clicking whilst the DataTable is loading? If they accidentally click on the wrong segment, should they be forced to wait for the load to complete before they can select the correct one?\n. There's no solution built into Morris.js, because I don't want to bind myself to any specific AJAX loading mechanism. I suggest you use CSS classes to add placeholder text or images into your graph element then, once you've loaded your data, remove the placeholder class and initialise the Morris.js chart.\n\nRough example:\n\nHTML:\n\n``` html\n<div id=\"my-chart\" class=\"loading\"></div>\n```\n\nCSS:\n\n``` css\n#my-chart.loading {\n  background-image: url(loader.png);\n  background-position: center;\n  background-repeat: no-repeat;\n}\n```\n\nJS:\n\n``` js\n$(function () {\n  $.ajax({\n    dataType: \"json\",\n    url: \"/chart/data\",\n    success: function (data) {\n      $(\"#my-chart\").removeClass(\"loading\");\n      Morris.Line({\n        data: data,\n        // xkey, ykeys, etc...\n      });\n    }\n});\n```\n. Sounds good to me. :+1:\n. The plain css file is minified already, so I've removed the .min part of the URL in the docs.\n\nFixed in 4d59c64\n. LGTM, thanks :+1: \n. LGTM\n. LGTM\n. Nice! LGTM\n. LGTM. Can you double-check the build failure?\n. LGTM, thanks :+1: \n. LGTM, thanks :+1:\n. LGTM :+1:\n. It's just that way to differentiate between lines that need to be broken (null. e.g., to indicate a break in a data series) and lines that need to ignore missing values (undefined).\n. Should be fixed by f740d80c140c8f075acb72b9ee26a7e63b37af36 - I've added YYYY-MM parsing.\n\nBTW, morris.js expects data that's already been sorted newest-first (ie. the opposite order of your example above).\n\nHope that helps!\n. Heh, no worries! :)\n. GH-pages branch.\n. I've re-written it in coffee-script.  It's a _bit_ prettier.\n. Cool!  I'll merge these later.\n. I've pulled your new examples into the main source tree, and somewhat inspired by your start on the documentation, I've put up a proper site at http://oesmith.github.com/morris.js\n\nAlso note, there's been a couple of small API changes too.  Check the docs! :)\n. Thanks for this (and the Makefile too!).\n. Morris expects your data to be sorted so the most recent point is first in the array. Switching your sort order should fix your problem.\n\n(and I should probably add a .sort somewhere in the code so the order of points passed in doesn't matter)\n. No worries :)\n\n(and I've opened #10 to deal with the sorting)\n. Done in fc4ff279a5 - YAY!\n. Done in dc0a34dcbb4f906fc25705d93b33ceabb5722a5e\n. Merged - thanks!\n. I posted an update to the website an hour or so ago - it should be there by now!\n. Can't believe I missed that one - thanks!\n. Thanks.  I've merged and done a little bit of refactoring - see dc0a34dcbb4f906fc25705d93b33ceabb5722a5e\n. Yup, that's the plan. There's also some refactoring to be done in the rendering code to cope with a different date format internally.\n. Fantastic! :)\n\nI'm planning to move to proper javascript timestamps for the internal time representation, but I think this should be OK to merge in the meantime.  I'll have a proper look later.\n\nThe axis labelling needs a refactor too -- the site I originally build morris.js for was only concerned with annual data, so there's only labels at year boundaries.  In #9 I'll make the labelling a _lot_ smarter, so it should be able to work out the correct labelling intervals automatically.\n. Millisecond-accuracy timestamps are now in v0.2.5!\n. Should be fixed now in master.  A nuance in the implementation got missed when I translated to coffeescript.  Schoolboy error on my part!\n. Try sorting your data in order of newest first.  This should fix your problem.\n\nAlternatively, wait for me to close issue #10!\n. I'm currently working on doing that -- please see issue #9.\n. I'm not seeing that same behaviour here.\n\nCould you post some example code, and let me know which browser you're using?\n. [here](http://jsfiddle.net/gnEGg/) is some example code, which works fine in all the browsers I can get my hands on (even IE6).\n\nClosing this issue.\n. That's not something that I'm currently working on, but I think it's something that I'll definitely get around to doing.\n\nWatch this space!\n. This has just been done in 4fb43d5d374e8bf1c9697c40b61c1890403aa23e.\n\nI'll include it in a v0.2.4 release soon.\n. Yes, you can supply dates in YYYY-MM format and they'll render OK.\n\nHowever, the x-axis labelling code needs work to properly display dates to month accuracy along the axis. At the moment it'll only label year boundaries (this should be rectified when issue #9 is finished).\n. Excellent stuff, thanks!\n. At the moment, that's not possible -- and not currently on the roadmap either.\n\nSorry!\n. All merged - thanks!\n. Are you using integers or strings in your x-values?\n\nMorris.js will attempt to sort the incoming x-values, so it may be getting the sort order messed up if they're strings.\n. I'm not sure what you're trying to do.  Can you post some example code?\n. Try replacing\n\n```\ndata: [$graph],\n```\n\nwith\n\n```\ndata: $graph,\n```\n\nAlso ensure that jQuery's properly parsing the JSON data.  If you're using Chrome or Safari, doing a `console.log($graph);` should dump the contents of $graph to the console, and it'll show you if it's a string (bad) or an object (good!).\n. Great - glad it's working for you now!\n. Great idea - I'll stick it on my TODO list!\n. I'm working on a refactor of the hover labels at the moment.\n\nFollow my work on #134.\n. For negative values, keep your eye on issue #25 - they're on my TODO list.\n\nFor week numbers, make sure you're using at least v0.2.3, then try either formatting them as ISO standard week numbers (ie. `2012 W11`), or set the parseTime option to `false` to skip date parsing and treat your X values as an arbitrary stream.\n. Support for negative numbers has just been added in commit 4fb43d5d374e8bf1c9697c40b61c1890403aa23e\n\nIt'll get included in a v0.2.4 release soon.\n. This is done in bcc034e152534aa8c6f8e5267c77a786ebcb127e (see the units option)\n\nIt'll go into v0.2.4 too\n. None of those are currently on my roadmap.\n\nMy philosophy is to keep morris.js as simple as possible to use, so some of those features might not ever make it into the library.  You might be better served by some of the more fully-featured (and complex) graphing libraries.\n. Millisecond-accuracy timestamps are now in v0.2.5.  Checkout the updated docs at http://oesmith.github.com/morris.js/ and the example code in examples/timestamp.html.\n\nCheers!\n. Yeah, decimal values aren't very well supported at the moment.

I've just committed a fix for this in 634179d.  Decimal values will no longer be rounded.\n\nIt'll get included in the next release.\n. Thanks!\n\nI've got a rough idea for doing something similar (one of the graphs on howmanyleft could really do with support for partial series).  I'll keep this implementation in mind when I'm hacking :)\n. Been through this today - your code was great.  Apart from a small tweak, I've merged it straight in.\n\nThanks!\n. At the moment, decimal values will be represented in the line, but the labels are rounded.  See Issue #37.\n. Yeah, the current labelling code is nowhere near good enough to handle anything but annual data.\n\nI'm refactoring the labelling code now to be smarter about this -- to determine a labelling strategy based on the range of the x-axis (so it'll increment the labels in centuries / decades / years / months / days / hours / minutes / seconds / etc depending on what the total range is).  At the same time I'm refactoring the code to accept full javascript timestamps as x-values.\n\nYour approach so far is pretty radically different to the one I'm planning, so I'm not going to merge this code as it stands.  I'm pretty busy at the moment though, so my code's going to take a while to complete. You might be best-off working with your fork for now until mine's ready for release.\n\nHope that helps!\n. Yup, I'll keep in mind relative timestamps.  They won't be in the first drop, but I'll make sure they're on the roadmap (which reminds me, I really should keep a roadmap in these issues!) :)\n. xlabelMargin as an option: great.\n\nYour xlabels, however, aren't ready to be merged.  A complete solution to the labelling challenge needs two further problems solved:\n- _Automatically_ choosing the correct label steps --  If the label margin is 20 px, the width of the x axis is 200 px and the timespan is 10 years, the labels should be years.  If the timespan is a week, then they should be days.\n- The label formatting should make it obvious what the label means.  If it's months, then labelling \"2012-01\" or \"Jan\" gives the right context to understand the label. \"01\" does not.\n\nThanks for the contribution.  I hope we can solve these problems and get some awesome xlabel formatting!\n. Great stuff, but this isn't quite ready to merge yet.\n- Camel-case formatting on the options, please -- that means they should be `drawXLabels` and `drawYLabels`.  Also check your code, there's a mix of drawYlabel and drawYlabel**s**, so Y-axis labelling is broken in this commit.\n- When the labelling is disabled, can you set the bounds of the drawing area to fill the element (rather than having empty space where the labels _would_ have been).\n. This only reads the year, month, day, hour and minute parts of the time spec.  Would it not be easier to just add an optional 'T' to the middle of the regexp for YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM type?\n. I've just pushed a fix in 18b4191 - let me know if it works for you!\n. Thanks for the bug report!\n\nI've just committed a fix in b3ab944 - hopefully everything should be working for you now.\n. Looks great -- it's a good intermediate step towards getting properly 'magic' date/time labelling on the x-axis.\n\nI'll give it a whirl this evening and if it all works well, I'll merge it :)\n. Yeah, I've been considering using moment.js -- but if possible I'd like to get a solution that doesn't need another external dependency.\n. This code wasn't quite in line with the direction I've taken with my own code, so I've skipped merging it.\n\nHowever, my automatic x-labelling code is now merged into master -- see commit fc4ff279a5.  Let me know if it works for you guys!\n. I'm not quite sure what you're attempting to do -- I think the best way to explain this to me is in code, so do please go ahead and submit a pull request! :)\n. Sorry, that's not something that I've any real need for at the moment.\n\nIf you'd like, feel free to contribute some code and I'll consider including it!\n\nAlternatively, g.raphael can make use of the same dependencies as Morris.js and draw pies too.\n\nThanks,\n\nOlly\n. I'm totally an advocate of using Highcharts for complicated stuff too, but area charts shouldn't be complicated to add to morris.js -- I'll add them to my TODO list! :)\n. Ok, you guys win - area charts are the next thing I'll be adding to Morris. Watch this space :+1:\n. OK, area charts are now in master.\n\n[This example](https://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/blob/master/examples/area.html) shows you how it works.\n\n![example image](http://olly.oesmith.co.uk/~oliver/github/morris_area.png)\n. Any reason why you can't use YYYY-MM-DD HH:_00_ ? ;)\n. I've merged this, with one small change.  Local time is used when neither zulu time nor an offset are specified.\n\nThanks for your contribution!\n. This is in now -- I've made a couple of small tweaks that will affect you when you pull in the latest master branch.  Make sure you take a look at the last couple of commits.\n\nThanks loads for the contribution!\n. It's in!  I've made a small change to use camel-case (so the options become `preUnits` and `postUnits`), and a small refactor - see fa8f8c6.\n\nThanks again!\n. Currently, I think Morris.js only properly handles continuous series -- ie. there can be null values at the beginning and end of a series, but not in the middle.\n\nThe difficulty here is in deciding what the behaviour should be for null values -- I presume you need the line plot to be continuous (rather than have gaps where the null values are)?\n. This should be A-OK now.  Let me know if it's working for you.\n. Can you send me an example/jsfiddle showing this?\n. I can't reproduce this at all.  Changing CSS widths on the containing element in all my examples changes the corresponding width of the graph. Closing this issue.\n. Yeah, the current implementation uses a single tooltip which it moves around and rewrites the labels when you hover different points.  Refactoring that won't be straightforward...\n\nBest of luck -- don't forget to send a pull request when you get it working!\n. This is in, although I've removed the deep copy in favour of a shallow one (the only destructive change to the data array is sorting, so a deep copy was overkill).\n\nSee 942e121\n. Hi!\n\nThanks for the pull request....\n\n... however, there's no code changes needed to support more than 7 lines.  The default config for line colours in morris.js only contains 7 colours, so all you need to do is pass your own `lineColors` config parameter with the number of lines that you need.\n\nSee here: http://jsfiddle.net/MKhdW/\n\nHope that helps!\n. Merged at last - thanks!\n. Thanks guys - have fixed in aa67b1a and released 0.2.9.\n. Fixed in aa67b1a. Thanks!\n. Like some other pull requests I've cleared out today, I'm not convinced this one's worth the test/maintenance overhead.\n\nClosing.\n. This should be fixed now in master, and it'll be released in v0.2.10.\n. I've had a hack at this today, and I've added a setData() method to Morris.Line.  Take a look at [the 'updating' example](https://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/blob/master/examples/updating.html) to see how it works.\n\nCurrently this is just on the master branch, but I'll include it in the next release (v0.2.10).  Let me know if it solves your problem.\n. Right now there's no code to support resizing the graph, so I'd expect 'odd' behaviour when resizing.\n\nCan you send me a jsfiddle that reproduces the container width and height problems you're experiencing?\n. Thanks! I've merged and released this in 0.2.10.\n. This is fixed on master now.\n\nI also recommend using an `auto N` value in the `ymax` and/or `ymin` options, so you can set the range that the graph will show when there's absolutely no variance in the data values.\n. Those kinds of requirements are way ahead of Morris.js right now. I suggest you take a look at D3.js, which would do a far better job of satisfying them.\n\nOlly\n. `xLabelFormat` is the option you're looking for (see the docs for more info).  `dateFormat` doesn't affect the x-axis labels because of the automatic 'smart' labelling it uses to work out the most suitable labels for the x-axis date range.\n\n(so bear in mind if you change `xLabelFormat` to always display `DD. MM. YYYY.`, it won't look so great when the date range isn't suitable for labels of that granularity)\n\nHTH\n\nOlly\n. You may need to delay rendering until the containing element is visible on-screen.  IME Raphael.js has issues on IE when the containing element has `display: none` on it.\n\nHTH\n\nOlly  \n\n## \n\nOlly Smith\n\nOn Thursday, 9 August 2012 at 03:35, pcout wrote:\n\n> Hello,\n> I implemented this plugin successfully but i came up with an issue when using it in a modal window.\n> When used in a modal popup (i use ZURB Reveal Modal plugin - https://github.com/zurb/reveal) the graph does not appear in IE 8.  \n> In Firefox it shows correctly.

This should be fixed in v0.3.0 (available to download now).\n. You're nearly there with removing the quotes from `value` -- Morris.js requires numerical values in that field.\n\nTry using a helper (or maybe a decorator?) to map #to_i against the values.\n. Something like the following, perhaps?\n\n``` ruby\n# in application_helper.rb\ndef donut_json\n  @result_donut.map { |x| {:label => x[:label], :value => x[:value].to_i} }.to_json.to_s.html_safe\nend\n```\n\n.. and then, in your view\n\n``` html\n<script>\nMorris.Donut({\n  element: 'donut',\n  data: <%= donut_json %>\n});\n</script>\n```\n\n_Disclaimer: this is quick and dirty code, so you may want to tidy/reorganise it as you see fit._\n. I've just pushed a solution to master.  You can now pass a function to `Morris.Donut` to format the value however you need to.  Grab the latest `morris.min.js` and give this a go:\n\n``` javascript\nMorris.Donut({\n  element: 'donut',\n  data: /* your data here */\n  formatter: function (x) { return Math.floor(x / 60) + ':' + Morris.pad2(x % 60) }\n});\n```\n\n_Disclaimer: again, a quick+dirty solution - feel free to customize the formatter to fit your needs :)_\n. You can use `xLabelFormat` to add a custom formatter for date labels.\n. The graphs won't draw properly if their container has 'display: none'.  I've worked around this in my bootstrap sites by listening for the 'shown' event on the tab and only initialising charts in the event handler.\n\nHTH!\n\nOlly\n. Try adding `lineColors` to your config with enough colors for all of your series (I think the default config only supports a maximum of 8ish series before it runs out of colors).\n. That last commit removes the `lineColors.length >= ykeys.length` requirement.  It'll cycle color values when they run out.\n. Grab the latest master, then calling `select(n)` on the object that `Morris.Donut(...)` returns.\n\nI've just added some code that _should_ do what you need.\n. Whoops - my fault for coding too late at night! :)\n\nTry again now - should be fixed.\n. Try the latest master, I've slightly modified the ymin/ymax behaviour.  FWIW, I recommend setting `ymax` to `auto N` in these situations (where `N` is a sensible number for your dataset).\n. No problems - I'm glad it's working for you.\n\nCheers!\n\nOlly\n\nOn 26 Sep 2012, at 21:47, Monica Olinescu notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nThanks for the quick fix.

Really like morris.js so far.\n\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on\nGitHubhttps://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/issues/80#issuecomment-8905118.\n. I'm gradually working towards getting more charts in - if you've got some specific ideas for what you'd like to see, I'd be glad to see some mockups or similar designs (or even better, some code!).\n\nI'd avoided including legends in the donut chart because the legend can quickly overwhelm the chart. The donut chart should be a _very_ simple overview of the data, and if you need more information alongside it, I'd recommend adding a table or a different kind of visualisation so that its easily readable and accessible.\n. Thanks to the enthusiasm in the other thread, area charts are next on my list of priorities. Once they're out of the way I'll start investigating bars! :+1:\n. OK, basic support for bars are in now too! See #101 for details.\n. Radars are a pain in the ass (and I'm not convinced they work well on the web), so I'd rather keep them out of morris completely.\n\nGauges are more interesting. They're pretty simple, so should be a quick-ish job to complete. I'll add a separate issue to discuss them.\n\nClosing this issue now, since it's dragged on for a looooooooooooong while.\n. Nice one - thanks!\n. Good spot!  I guess I was just lucky that all my graphs with `parseTime: false` so far have had ordered x-keys :)\n. What are you sending to Morris in the `element` option?\n. Is there a `<div id='stocks_chart' ... >` on your page?\n. Are you running the javascript that calls Morris.Line on pages that _don't_ contain `#stocks_chart`?\n\nMaybe move the call to Morris.Line inside an if statement that checks for the presence of `#stocks_chart` on the page?\n. If you're using rails assets, then it's likely that script will be on every page, yes.  I'd recommend keeping it in your assets folder, but use an `if` statement to stop it from executing on the wrong pages.\n\nSomething like this:\n\n``` coffee-script\njQuery ->\n  if $('#stocks_chart').length\n    Morris.Line\n      element: 'stocks_chart'\n      data: $('#stocks_chart').data('stocks')\n      # ...\n```\n. Are your YYYY time stamps strings or numbers?\n\nMorris will parse strings as years, and numbers as numeric time stamps.\n\nCan you give me an example (using jsbin or similar) of where the code doesn't work?\n. I'm not quite sure I understand the problem. Can you replicate it with some code on jsbin.com or jsfiddle.net and reply with the link?\n. I've changed that first jsbin slightly to insert some dummy data rather than call the PHP code, and it appears to be working fine (I see x-axis labels)\n\nhttp://jsbin.com/igasid/10/edit\n\nDoes that work for you?\n. Try using `xLabels: \"hour\"` - if you force it to use day labels and the data doesn't span any boundaries between days, then you'll get no labels on the x axis.\n. Hmm.. not sure why that's happening.\n\nCan you paste in here the output of console.log(colors)?\n. I'm not sure what to suggest here -- I'm unable to reproduce that behaviour.\n\nCan you check out this jsfiddle and try to get it to show the bug?\n\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/bTR3j/1/\n. Is there any CSS on the page that could be influencing the SVG that Morris\nis generating?\n\nOn 7 Oct 2012, at 18:53, joe notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI confirm that removing d3 and other javascript libraries from the project\ndoes not affect the outcome: the lines are still all blue\n\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on\nGitHubhttps://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/issues/86#issuecomment-9210391.\n.

Looks good at a quick glance. I'll give it a proper code review soon.\n\nThanks for the contribution!\n. I'm really keen to replace the hover with an HTML element (rather than a piece of SVG). It should make the code a _lot_ simpler and much easier to customise.\n\nWhen I get around to refactoring the hover like I did the grid, then I'll definitely be HTML-ifying it.\n. I've completed the HTML hover refactor, and you can now update the hover content dynamically with an event handler. I'm not planning to offer this feature by default in morris.js, but you'll be able to customise it yourself if you need. I'll be documenting the entire process shortly when I release v0.4.\n\nClosing this issue.\n. Try the latest version of Morris.js from the github repository - `dateFormat` should now work for _all_ valid dates.\n. What's the use case for smoothing some paths and not others?\n\nI'm becoming increasingly concerned that the list of options for Morris.Line is becoming too long, and I'd like to avoid adding any new options unless it's absolutely necessary.\n. OK cool, I'll try to get this code reviewed this over the weekend.\n\nThanks for the contribs!\n. All merged!\n\nNote I did make the implementation a little more concise - see [my changes](https://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/commit/67fbc481aaa08c48e4d5e4bc5b84c22c72ae17c2).\n.

This is some really good work! :+1:\n\nThere's still a few challenges outstanding before it's ready for release though.\n- a minimum segment size, so that segments don't disappear when they become too small\n- automatic label scaling so large labels don't overlap the pie or overflow the container boundaries\n- smarter label positioning to stop the labels for small adjacent segments from overlapping\n\nLabelling is a _difficult_ problem for pie charts, especially that last problem of overlapping labels.  I'd almost be tempted to take an approach similar to the donut chart of only showing the label for the currently selected segment.  After all, a pie chart is just an aid to visualise some tabular data -- so if _all_ of the data is important, you'd have the table alongside the pie chart on the same page...\n\nHope that helps!\n\nOlly\n. A side-comment regarding zero values:\n\nThe 'safe' behaviour for the donut chart is to show zero values as very thin slices so they can be hovered and a zero value can be shown to the end user.\n\nIf you're convinced that your charts shouldn't show zero values (I'm not), then I recommend you remove those values before passing them to the chart to render.\n. Printing isn't a use case I've considered at all when building Morris.js. Does it work at all?\n\nI'm closing this PR, since it's gone stale.\n. What have you tried so far?\n\nPost a link to your code so far on a [jsbin](http://jsbin.com) or [jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.com) and I'll take a look to see if I can work out what you've missed.\n. Yes, in the current version of Morris.js, you'll need to convert those `d` values to millisecond timestamps for `dateFormat` to take effect.\n\n(See also #90, which is for adding support for formatting string values in x labels)\n. Sorry, I meant the `d` values in your `data` should be timestamps in order for `dateFormat` to work.\n\n_Anyway_, I've commited a fix for #90 this morning that should help here.  If you grab the latest version from master, then the following code should work (note the value that is passed to the `dateFormat` callback is a timestamp, not a Date).\n\n```\nMorris.Line({\n  element: 'chart',\n  data: [\n    {d: '2012-10-18', w: 0, n: 1, t: 1 },\n    {d: '2012-10-17', w: 0, n: 1, t: 1 },\n    {d: '2012-10-15', w: 1, n: 0, t: 1 },\n  ],\n  xkey: 'd',\n  ykeys: ['w', 'n', 't'],\n  xLabelFormat: function(d) {\n    return d.getDate()+'/'+(d.getMonth()+1)+'/'+d.getFullYear(); \n  },\n  xLabels:'day',\n  labels: ['Winners', 'Non-winners', 'Total'],\n  lineColors: ['#167f39','#990000', '#000099'],\n  lineWidth: 2,\n  dateFormat: function (ts) {\n    var d = new Date(ts);\n    return d.getYear() + '/' + (d.getMonth() + 1) + '/' + d.getDay();\n  }\n});\n```\n\nLet me know if that works for you.\n. The `ts` value is just a parameter on the `dateFormat` function (the name doesn't matter, you could call it purple_elephants if you wanted).\n\nIf you grab the latest Morris.js code from the github repository, you won't need any more timestamp data.\n. Can you try with the latest master version? I've done some refactoring recently which should have fixed this issue.\n. The hover is designed to _replace_ a fixed legend. I really don't see the value in having a partial hover and adding a legend -- it's putting redundant data on the screen.\n\nDo you see what I mean?\n. As I see it, the hover _is_ showing necessary information (the series colors), even when it isn't showing values for some series.  There is an argument for making the hover less noisy and/or easier to scan when there are missing values though.\n\nIf you're keen to show a legend alongside the chart, then you can access the colors array from the `.options.lineColors` property on the object that `Morris.Line` returns.\n\n``` javascript\n\nvar chart = Morris.Line(/* ... */);\nconsole.log(chart.options.lineColors); // ['#0b62a4', '#7A92A3', ...]\n```\n. I've already switched \"n/a\" for \"-\" in the hover, but I'm still not happy that it's the _right_ solution. I think it could do with some table-alignment of the series labels and values to make it a little prettier.... :confused:\n. If you resize the element that contains the graph and call `redraw()` on the object returned by `Morris.Line`, the graph should be redrawn to fit.\n\nSee the documentation for [`window.onresize()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.onresize) to see how you hook into resize events in javascript.\n\n_Note: I suggest you call redraw() sparingly as it's quite an expensive operation. Try using a setTimeout trick or similar to avoid calling it for intermediate resize events._\n. That's great, thanks!\n\nI'm working on area charts (and beefing up the test suite) at the moment, which is why there's been so much refactoring recently.  I'll try to get this integrated as soon as the area charts are done.\n\n:+1:\n. It's not possible right now, but I'm currently working on it.  See #47.\n. Right now that's not possible, but it's a sensible feature to add.\n\nI'll leave this issue open as a reminder.  Thanks!\n. Closed with #103\n. Cool!\n\nI'm going to hack on this now. I'm thinking of changing the way the x-axis scaling works for bar graphs. Instead of doing a straight time-based interpolation, I'd rather split the chart into equal-sized blocks for each entry in options.data. This should mean we don't need the padding calculations..\n. OK, take a look at e4f4594.  I've taken your work and pared it right down to the absolute bare essentials, removing some unnecessary bits that were leftover from Morris.Line and refactoring anything relating to horizontal positioning.\n\nTo keep the basic functionality of the bar chart clear, I've removed some of your new additions. I've no objections to any of them, I'd just like to build up the features incrementally from a _really_ solid base.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n![Screenshot](http://olly.oesmith.co.uk/~oliver/github/bars1.png)\n.

Honestly, I'm not convinced this is a _really_ necessary core addition to the library. Everybody wants their own combination of weird and wonderful coloring for their bar charts, and this only covers one aspect. My preference would be to make it _completely_ flexible, and make `options.barColors` able to accept a function that generates the correct colors.\n\nSomething like:\n\n``` javascript\nbarColors: function (data, type) {\n  // data: series name/index, x / y values\n  // type: 'hover' or 'bar'\n  if (type === 'hover') {\n    // generate a hover color\n    // ...\n  }\n  else if (type === 'bar') {\n    // generate a bar fill color\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n```\n. I've added the callback code now -- take a look at 236afa4.\n. Looks good to me :+1:\n\nA couple of notes:\n- Math.min / Math.max will treat a null as a zero, so you need to be careful of passing nulls\n- I'm trying to move away from using $.map towards using coffee-script list comprehensions wherever possible (they look tidier to me :grinning:)\n\n(see 8faced7 for the changes I made when merging)\n. There's a lot of overlap in functionality between this and Morris.Donut.  I'd like to investigate moving some of the common code into a base class.\n\nI'll have a hack at this and see what I can come up with.\n. Closed by #106\n.

IMHO, the _ideal_ behaviour would be:\n- a `null` value breaks the line\n- an `undefined` value _does not_ break the line\n\nTo maintain backwards compatibility, this new behaviour will need to be off by default.

Finally getting around to looking at this. Looking pretty damned good so far!\n\nHowever, I'm not sure there's any justification for the multiple inheritance (or composition) code here - the hover methods could be declared directly on Morris.Grid, couldn't they?\n. I'm carrying on this work in the `html-hover` branch. See #134.\n\nClosing this PR now.\n. LGTM! :+1:\n.

This has been fixed in master. Closing.\n. Yup, this is definitely out of scope for morris.js.\n. I've done some refactoring, beefed up the tests a little and merged broken-lines into master.\n\nSee d41bea2 for my changes. It's nothing huge - just a little tidying in the tests, and a refactor to createPath & gradients to handle leading and trailing null values.\n\nCheers! :+1:\n. _I've written this comment elsewhere, but here it is again:_\n\nThe 'safe' behaviour for the donut chart is to show zero values as very thin slices so they can be hovered and a zero value can be shown to the end user.\n\nIf you're convinced that your charts shouldn't show zero values (I'm not), then I recommend you remove those values before passing them to the chart to render.\n. Going to move the discussion for click events to #172.\n. Isn't the whole point of a donut chart to show the label inside the hole?\n. OK, feel free to add new stuff, but you need to support the existing behaviour before I'll consider merging it.\n. Oh, and _please_ try to add some tests when you're adding new features.\n\nI'm disappointed with the existing test coverage in Morris.js, and slamming in new features with no tests isn't helping. :cry: \n. I'm currently working on a complete refactor of the hover code - which will include this feature - so I won't be merging this PR. Please follow my progress on #134.\n. Again, this will be covered by the HTML hover refactor. Follow #134.\n. Fixed and online now. All caused by a single comma! (6ecb432)\n. This PR is next on my list to review. It may require some re-work now that the html hover code is in master (it could be useful to use the new `hitTest` methods on line and bar charts, for example).\n\nAnyway, I promise to review this one soon!\n. It's also worth noting that Raphael will generate VML markup for versions of IE that do not have native SVG support, so CSS classes and DOM events aren't going to work for us there.\n. Yeah, it totally sucks. It's the reason why Morris uses Raphael and isn't just another wrapper around D3 :frowning:\n. OK, this is pretty much all done now, except documentation.  Since the docs are going to go on the gh-pages branch (and won't be published until the v0.4.0 release), I'm merging this PR into master now.\n. Please add any changes to the coffeescript source file (in this case, `lib/morris.donut.coffee`).  I can't accept pull requests that modify the compiled javascript directly. :-1:\n\nFWIW, this is inconsistent with the existing `colors` option for donut charts. For consistency, I'd rather the option here was a `labelColors` array containing a color value for each data row (or similar).\n. See the solution in #139. This will be released in v4.0!\n. Merged! :+1:\n\nI've removed the prefix and suffix options from the formatter callback -- there's little point in pushing user-supplied data back in the callback arguments when it can be whatever the user wants within the callback itself!\n. OK, this is now merged. I have altered the options as follows:\n- _grid_ (true/false) controls rendering of the grid lines\n- _axes_ (true/false) controls rendering of the axis labels\n\nAgain, thanks for the PR! :+1:\n. Could you implement this feature for your charts using the new `hoverCallback` feature instead? It's currently undocumented, but see the example in `decimals-custom-hover`.\n\nI'm not sure this is a common enough use case to justify adding the extra complexity to the core library.\n. Honestly, my gut reaction is that just isn't a great chart.\n\nI want to keep Morris.js simple, so I'm pushing back on more features recently. If you want to do this with Morris.js, I suggest you find an alternative way of showing that data. Otherwise look at Highcharts or something in the D3 ecosystem.\n. I've rejected this #148, so I'm closing this one too.\n. There will _not_ be a placeholder by default in morris.js it's up to you to provide a _meaningful_ message to your users that fits the formatting of your site.\n\nHowever, if there's an issue where an empty data object breaks the chart with setData, then we should fix that.\n. Love it :+1:\n. I'm going to take a DHH-style stand on this and say I don't particularly care for rounded corners, and I don't think the benefits are worth the maintenance and test overhead of having this in the codebase. Hence I'm rejecting this pull request.\n\n_However_, I'd be very interested in any pull requests that improve the x-labelling. I'd _like_ to see something that enables angled or vertical labels in order to fit more labels along the x-axis. **If** I find the time between my Googley responsibilities, I may have a go at this code, but I'd very happy to receive a pull request if you're keen :)\n. There's definitely some readability and testability benefits to encapsulating this drawing code into methods, but (as has been said already), a separate class isn't the place for these. I'd rather see them declared on the class that owns the drawing operations (`drawBar` on Morris.Bar, etc).\n\nMake sense?\n. This is merged - thanks for the contribution! :+1:\n. Merged, with a small tweak.\n. Again, I'm going to take a stand and say I don't think this is a valuable _enough_ feature to be worth the maintenance and test overhead of including it in the repo. IMHO if you want to create multiple stacked columns, you need to re-think your visualisation ideas...\n. Two reasons:\n1. Since joining Google I've had a lot less spare time to spend on Morris.js.  Big PRs are more time-consuming to review and merge, especially where there's a number of dependent new features being added.\n2. I don't think moving the label outside of the donut is a good direction to move in. It certainly doesn't fit the use case I have for donuts.\n. My philosophy for Morris.js is for it to be a _simple_ charting library. It's the one you reach for when you want to do something quick and simple, without sacrificing aesthetics.\n\nFeatures like milti-dimensional donut charts and rich interactivity are beyond that philosophy. I'd very much prefer people to be using more advanced visualisation libraries like D3.\n. Closing this as a dupe of #162.\n. Why have this feature as well as events?\n\nIMHO, it's feature bloat. Morris.js is all about minimalism and simplicity. Do it right _one_ way, or not at all.\n. I'm not sure this is something that's absolutely necessary for Morris.\n. A few comments:\n- I'd rather see pull requests with a single feature - it makes it easier to merge quickly and focus discussion.\n- I'm not sure I see the point of customising the hover CSS prefix. It's already sufficiently namespaced to not conflict with other libraries, and you can have different CSS in different charts by using parent selectors. It seems like a waste of code to me.\n- I like the idea of changing the gravity of the hover box, but I'm not sold on being able to overflow the container - I'd like to retain the old constrained behaviour and make the overflow optional.\n. OK, I think I'll take a pass on this pull request.\n. That's not really possible at the moment. The best you can currently do is a bar chart with multiple data series alongside each other..\n. Please make changes against the coffee-script, not the javascript files.\n\nThe javascript is automatically generated from the coffee-script.\n. Yes, there's definitely scope to improve this code. Fudging the line numbers is _not_ the right answer though. The graph bounds need to be calculated more intelligently and so do the numLines.\n. See also #168.\n. I'll add it to my todo list.\n\nFWIW, I'll be uploading a change with new y-axis labelling this weekend,\nwhich I'd appreciate you all testing!\nOn Thu, Mar 28, 2013 at 5:44 PM, t3chn0r notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Not sure if there's been any work on this but I was looking for an option\n> to only have int numbers on the Y-Axis and couldn't find anything.

I've just completed the first round of this work and checked it into master. It'll massage the bounds of the chart to fit a 'friendlier' set of y labels. It won't change the number of grid lines or force non-decimal increments for charts over a very small Y range (like @t3chn0r's problem above), but it should improve rendering for the majority of cases.\n\nBefore:\n\n![Screen Shot 2013-04-01 at 20 54 14](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/116292/325287/f5c0af10-9b05-11e2-844a-30bc3a651dd0.png)\n\nAfter:\n\n![Screen Shot 2013-04-01 at 20 53 30](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/116292/325285/ded0887a-9b05-11e2-8657-8621fc68684b.png)\n\nI'll be including this with a v0.4.2 release this week.\n. @Grizzlybearded  I've just pushed a fix for the decimal label overflow problem onto master.\n\n@t3chn0r I'm not sure that fix will work everywhere (for example, false origins and negative y-values will cause problems). I'll keep thinking about it.\n. I'm going to cut a v0.4.2 release now with the new behaviour, so I'll close this. Lets move the integer Y-labels discussion to issue #221.\n. I've merged this into master now. Please note, I've renamed the strokeColor option to backgroundColor, because it better describes the option from a external point of view.\n\nThanks for your contribution! :+1:\n. Try debugging the values you're passing to morris.js. I suspect they'll be strings and you'll need to `parseInt(x, 10)` them, or something similar.\n. There's definitely scope to improve the Y-axis labelling code. Right now it's _very_ naive, and I think I can do better.\n\nWatch this space.\n. Closing this as a dupe of #162. It's not _exactly_ the same problem, but we should fix both at the same time.\n. Yeah, I'd strongly suggest not adding any new chart types for v0.5 - there's plenty of new code already that needs to be documented and released.\n\nAnd for pie charts, well, I've yet to see a beautiful pie chart on the web, and none of the attempts for morris.js so far appear to be any better than the norm. :cry:\n\nI'd be very happy if anyone had any good ideas for making pie charts attractive though!\n. Even that one seems pretty dull. The pie chart itself is incredibly easy (there's already great examples in g.raphael). The difficult part is getting the labelling or legend to work elegantly, which I don't think ember charts have solved yet, unfortunately.\n. Definitely. I think it'd be great to have a choice of horizontal, diagonal or vertical labels.\n. There's a drawXAxis method (or something similar - I don't have the code in\nfront of me to refer to) in Morris.Line and Morris.Bar that handles the\nactual drawing, which is the majority of the code.\n\nThere's also some code somewhere that calculates the height of the x-axis\nlabel area (I think this is in Morris.Grid at the moment), which will\nprobably need significant refactoring to deal with rotated labels.\n\nOlly\n\nOn 27 Jan 2013, at 14:41, James Seigel notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nAny idea what that would take or where I'd have to look to poke at that\npart of the code?\n\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on\nGitHubhttps://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/issues/173#issuecomment-12754973.\n.

You can still grab v0.4.0's JS and CSS from the github repo, but I'll not be putting the v0.4.0 site and zip bundle online until the v0.4.0 docs are complete (volunteers welcome, btw ;)).\n. .... aaaand the v0.4.0 site is up!\n. Does the example in `examples/decimal-custom-hover.html` work for you?\n. Yeah, your assessment looks about right. I'll take a look ASAP.\n. What's the value of `barData` when the success callback is triggered?\n. That looks like it should work. Is there a div on your page with an ID of `bar-error`?\n\nAre there any errors in your JavaScript console?\n. Ah, gotcha! I'll close this then..\n. This isn't something I consider urgent, but I'll always be open to well-written pull requests! :smile:\n. No, and that's not what I envisioned the donut being useful for. I'd suggest using a table as a legend, and assigning colors to your donut segments to match the table.\n\nTrying to hover labels over donut segments is a huge waste of screen space..\n. Interesting -- I'd guess a rounding issue too.\n\nCan you post a jsbin or similar that shows this behaviour?\n. Fixed!\n. Fixed - thanks!\n.

Hmmmmm.. very interesting. Can you reproduce the problem in a jsbin (or similar)?\n. Whoah! That's the first time I've seen Chrome get stuck like that. I'd guess that's something upsetting the Chrome renderer itself -- usually if a bit of javascript gets stuck in an infinite loop then the tab can usually detect that and kill itself.\n\nI'll see if I can ask the Chrome dev team at work tomorrow if they have any ideas..\n. Nice one!

Apologies -- the hideHover behaviour changed in v0.4.0. I've updated the docs to show the correct options.\n.

I think it's the x label rendering causing an issue here - it tries to\nmaintain a margin between labels and will skip a labeled its too close to\nits neighbours.

Since the indices get all messed up by the sort, I've added an extra parameter to the hover callback. See https://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/blob/master/examples/decimal-custom-hover.html#L182 for an example of the new param.\n. Great work, thanks!\n. That's correct - the SVG dimensions aren't correctly calculated if it's initialised in a hidden div.\n\nTry initialising your charts when they become visible instead of at page load. You can hook into the bootstrap tabs \"shown\" event to do this.  See http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/javascript.html#tabs\n. Try using touch events rather than click/hover. See the line chart for an\nexample. I'd be very happy to review a pull request if you can put one\ntogether!\n\nOn Mon Aug 12 2013 at 17:08:33, Roland notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> I'm not sure why but I can see that on Safari Mobile (iOS 6.1) the hover\n> on the donut charts it's not working properly.\n> \n> I have tried to manually bind the click event to the chart and select the\n> bar with the Morris.Donut().select(id) function, but it's pretty slow for\n> some reason.

Merged, thanks! I had to make a couple of small changes to work with other contributions, and I altered some variable and config names to read a little easier.\n\nCould you also write some documentation for these changes?\n\nThanks again :+1:\n. The source for the morris.js site is in this repo too, in the gh-pages branch. I'm not sure this examples folder is a great place to put this info -- maybe you could do a pull request onto the site page instead?\n\nThanks!\n\nOlly\n. By default, Morris will pick an x-label format that fits the date range you provide. You can force it to use a different format using the xLabels option. In your case, `xLabels: \"day\"` should do the job.\n. Great work, thanks! Could you also write some docs for your changes?\n\nThanks again :+1:\n. LGTM :+1:\n\nThanks!\n. I'm still reading all the issues in case there's anything urgent that needs\nfixing, but I'm not actively writing new features.\n\nI'm happy to grant others write access to the repo.

See #111 -- this is now fixed in master.\n. Very cool.\n\nSame feedback as before: could you keep the options namespace flat? Thanks!\n. LGTM, thanks. :+1:\n. Great stuff! Couple of comments:\n- Could you measure the label beforehand (in the calc method) and make sure it fits to the left of the y-axis labels?\n- Flat options namespace, please! :smile:\n. Nice one. Could you maybe split the labels for when there are multiple bars on the same row?\n. Oh, and keep the options namespace flat please. TYVM!\n. FWIW, I'm not a fan of pointer-following legends..\n. I tidied this PR a little -- see my changes here for feedback: 221c837\n\nThanks again! :+1:\n. LGTM, thanks :+1:\n. Thanks for the PR, but there's already a copy of raphael.js in spec/vendor/.\n\nI'll switch the examples to use that one instead..\n. Add `parseTime: false` to the chart options. By default, morris expects a time-series and will sort the data it's given (and since your x-values are strings, they don't get sorted numerically).\n. There's a solution in master now. See #111.\n. I'm not entirely sure how this error happened -- it shouldn't be tracking movement on anything outside of the graph element. Can you send me a jsbin that demonstrates the broken behaviour?\n\n(FWIW, if we really do need to filter these events, it's best to do it on the base event handlers in morris.grid.coffee).\n. LGTM, thanks :+1:\n. Three steps:\n- Save the chart object that Morris.Line returns.\n- Update the options on the chart object.\n- Call redraw() on the chart object.\n\nExample jsbin:\nhttp://jsbin.com/okIpaJu/1/edit?html,output\n\nHTH!\n. IME, something like a `$(\"#metrics_chart\").clear()` call before drawing the new chart should be sufficient to clear the div.\n\nIf you're using resize, there may be a memory leak linked to he redraw event handler -- but I'll try to verify and fix that before the next stable release.\n\nEdit: s/redraw/resize\n. There are `pointFillColors` and `pointStrokeColors` that you can use to customize the appearance of points.\n\nThere's nothing to customize line segments yet though. I'm not sure it'd be an easy job either, I _think_ it'd require separate lines for each segment (rather than one continuous line string as we have now).\n\nPhilosophically, I'd very much rather morris.js provided a generic solution for customising the line/point appearance, rather than having application-specific presets like `first/lastDataPointIncomplete`.\n. Morris.js is optimised for row set-type data sets, like database tables.  Completely independent series is something it won't support without a major rewrite. I suggest, for now, you look for another charting library if this feature is crucial for you.\n. Exactly as @sudodoki has said. I can't run this project alone any more. I'm looking for contributors to add to the repo.\n\nIf you can demonstrate in a pull request that you understand the ethos of the project and can write good, clean code, then please send that pull request and note that you want to become a contributor.\n. I think the xLabels config option would probably help here.\n\nSee docs: http://morrisjs.github.io/morris.js/lines.html\n. I'd rather users built their legends using their own data, as supplied to the `barColors` and `labels` attributes of the config object on the `Morris.Bar` constructor.\n\nI don't see much value in a callback that gives a user back the exact same data that they've already supplied to us.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n. I think we should concentrate on getting the behavior right for v0.5.\n\nThat means, imho, we should at least deprecate `continuousLine`.\n\nIf possible, I'd like the area chart to also make the area non-contiguous on null values.\n. Yeah, that's kind of what I was thinking of. I'll try to make another\niteration on that idea this week. I'll reply to this issue when I have\nsomething to share.\n\nThanks!\nOn Sat, Feb 15, 2014 at 9:48 pm, sudodoki notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Okay, that's how far I got\n> http://embed.plnkr.co/uVkyfNWA2kp2mB3lVfYZ/\n> Changes to code to achieve above plnkr result are\n> sudodoki@47ddf33https://github.com/sudodoki/morris.js/commit/47ddf33fa6872b697ce30904ace60b8af445b9d4\n> @oesmith https://github.com/oesmith I would appreciate your judgement\n> on how to handle this area smooth best.\n> \n> ## \n> \n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/347#issuecomment-35168983\n> .\n. OK, I've done some hacking on this today. I've no code to share, but here's my thinking so far:\n1. When behaveLikeLine is true, everything should behave exactly like a line chart. Since this is so similar to the line chart, I'm tempted to deprecate behaveLikeLine and move the code to fill the area beneath lines to an option on Morris.Line.\n2. Undefined values _cannot_ be spanned in default area charts. Stacking just doesn't work when the values are out of step.\n3. Null values in area charts should break the series, and values above should step down at the break point.\n\nCode to follow...\n. Yes, it's a 2-clause BSD license, and yes, please do configure the license header.\n\nThanks!\n. 0.5.0 hasn't technically been released yet because the doc site hasn't caught up with the codebase.. It'll be tagged and released when it's all up-to-date.\n. LGTM :+1:\n. LGTM :+1:\n. The changelog is _fairly_ up-to-date though, so it should serve as a good guide for updating the main documentation.\n. When the chart is off-screen, it's unable to measure its own width. I'd\nrecommend redrawing the chart whenever it transitions from off-screen\n(display: none) to on-screen (display: block).\n\nHTH\n\nOlly\n\nOn Wednesday, 12 February 2014 02:38:26, Toasterthegamer <\nnotifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> Hi,\n> \n> I'm having issues with the line chart and setting the root div to css\n> 'display:none' and back to 'display: block'.

Thanks!\n. Just merged -- sorry for the wait!\n. I'm not sure I understand what you need. Can you explain (or draw it) for me?\n\nThanks!\n. I'm not sure I understand your problem. Can you create an example using http://jsbin.com?\n. Ooops, looks like I forgot to add that option to the docs!\n\nI've update the doc site at http://morrisjs.github.io/morris.js/lines.html -- look for the xLabelAngle option.\n\nCheers!\n. If you use numeric type arguments, then it'll be interpreted as a timestamp -- in this case, your max time being interpreted as 8.5ms (and unfortunately there's no labelling scheme yet for timespans that small).\n\nI think the easiest way to get this to act as expected is to translate your values into numeric millisecond timestamps or ISO date strings.\n. Yeah, there's unfortunately no unbinding on the resize handler currently. I'll see what I can do to fix this..\n. What you're describing is a scatter plot, not a line chart. Morris.js doesn't support scatter plots, I'm afraid.\n. Try using setTimeout instead of setInterval. setInterval will continue calling the code every 2 seconds until the tab is closed. setTimeout will only update once.\n. JQuery.getJSON is an asynchronous method, so you need to use the success callback to get the result. For your example, you want to use something like the following code:\n\n``` js\n$.getJSON(\"lead_volume\", function (data) {\n  Morris.Line({\n    data: data,\n    element: \"lead_volume\",\n    xkey: \"date\",\n    ykeys: [\"total\"],\n    labels: [\"Total\"],\n  });\n});\n```\n. Yes, that's a somewhat deliberate limitation. If your chart has no data, I would assume your users would prefer to see a friendly message rather than a blank div. Morris does not have a default \"no data\" message to force chart creators to supply a contextually-relevant message of their own.\n. What do you mean by disable? Do you want to disable all interactivity?\n. That's something I would expect your event handlers to deal with. You would just need a 'busy' flag in your event handler to tell it to ignore events if a load is in progress.\n\nAs an aside, and apologies if I'm second-guessing your motives -- wouldn't it be better for your users to support clicking whilst the DataTable is loading? If they accidentally click on the wrong segment, should they be forced to wait for the load to complete before they can select the correct one?\n. There's no solution built into Morris.js, because I don't want to bind myself to any specific AJAX loading mechanism. I suggest you use CSS classes to add placeholder text or images into your graph element then, once you've loaded your data, remove the placeholder class and initialise the Morris.js chart.\n\nRough example:\n\nHTML:\n\n``` html\n<div id=\"my-chart\" class=\"loading\"></div>\n```\n\nCSS:\n\n``` css\n#my-chart.loading {\n  background-image: url(loader.png);\n  background-position: center;\n  background-repeat: no-repeat;\n}\n```\n\nJS:\n\n``` js\n$(function () {\n  $.ajax({\n    dataType: \"json\",\n    url: \"/chart/data\",\n    success: function (data) {\n      $(\"#my-chart\").removeClass(\"loading\");\n      Morris.Line({\n        data: data,\n        // xkey, ykeys, etc...\n      });\n    }\n});\n```\n. Sounds good to me. :+1:\n. The plain css file is minified already, so I've removed the .min part of the URL in the docs.\n\nFixed in 4d59c64\n. LGTM, thanks :+1: \n. LGTM\n. LGTM\n. Nice! LGTM\n. LGTM. Can you double-check the build failure?\n. LGTM, thanks :+1: \n. LGTM, thanks :+1:\n. LGTM :+1:\n. It's just that way to differentiate between lines that need to be broken (null. e.g., to indicate a break in a data series) and lines that need to ignore missing values (undefined).\n. ",

Yes, the callback takes a couple of arguments.\n. check out this example: https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/blob/master/examples/bar.html\n. Yes, you can just do:\n\n``` javascript\nchart.on('click', function(i, row) {\n\n})\n```\n\nlike in this example: https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/blob/master/examples/area.html\n. I'll close this one since it is fixed by #147\n. I'm really unsure what you mean\n. This is not built in, but you should just do something with the data in the row object and use it to do something with the DOM. Like changing the data on the page somewhere.\n.

You should probably take a look at the `transY` function in `grid.coffee`, which takes a value and translates it to an Y position. It currently uses linear scaling, but could probably easily be altered to support logarithmic scaling as well.\n. Bootstrap modals expose an event called `shown.bs.modal` and you should probably use that to redraw the graph.\n. There is no destroy method. I have run into that problem myself as well.

Here is the demo: http://jsbin.com/pucadowa/1/edit?js,output\nAnd it seems to fail again because I changed how the hover it's y position is determined. It was needed to actually have the hover over the correct bar (see demo). What's the reasoning behind the current y positioning? I already thought it was a bit weird.\n. I figured out the reason. It was to make sure the hover didn't block the points in a line graph. I added an extra option to the function to make it centre on y and now all the tests pass.\n. Also, I've just emailed @oesmith to ask for official contributor status. Since I think I know the internals of the lib well enough now to be an asset.\n. Fixed that with #457\n. As you can see, it works fine with the code from my new pull request: \nhttp://jsbin.com/pucadowa/8/edit?js,output\n. First of all the fixes in #460 and #474 should be merged since they fix some bugs and after that some documentation should be written for the new features.\n\nUntil then you can build it yourself, although I suggest you merge #460 since line charts will be broken otherwise. And if you want it on the cdn more quickly you can probably help by writing the documentation.\n.

Hmmm,\n\nThat is indeed a weird bug, I'll try to look into it when I have time.\n. Oh, I see it causes some tests to fail. Will check that later.\n. Updated this to not cause an error when null is supplied.\n. This means mostly that you have to much data to show in the graph. Some code to handle the exception would be nice, but physically you're unable to display the data in the graph on the screen real estate you have. \n. First of all, could you remove the compiled js files from your commit? We'll update those in a separate commit. \n\nAnd I think your second test is broken since it doesn't specify the `freePosition` option. I also saw some problems with the code that did that. Could you make an example in jsbin that shows what these features are supposed to do? You can reuse this one, just copy your compiled/minified js in there and change the example code.\n. You have removed the compiled files and committed that, which is not what I meant :wink:. That is also why the jsbin doesn't work anymore since the compiled file is not in your git repo. \n\nCould you make sure that the js files are not changed by your commit?\n. Good call on the tests. Looking forward to that pull request. I see that you changed one of the tests already in this commit. I think it would be better if that was moved to your next one instead of being hidden in this one. \n\nYou can use `git add -p` to only add certain lines and not whole files.\n. Oh and the functionality looks good btw. I'll try to merge it when I have time.\n. Could you still do this?\n. I have reported it through the link. They will probably unblock it.\n. Fixed\n. It is indeed because of how the bezier curves work. I don't know enough of the SVG code to know how to make sure this doesn't happen. and `smooth: 'false'` should indeed remove the problem.\n. I'm using these for dutch values, I haven't taken the effort to make it general an add it to morris itself.\n\n``` javascript\nvar options = {\n    dateFormat: function(x) {\n        return new Date(x).toLocaleDateString('nl-NL');\n    },\n    xLabelFormat: function(x) {\n        return x.toLocaleDateString('nl-NL');\n    },\n    yLabelFormat: function(x) {\n        return x.toLoceleString('nl-NL');\n    },\n};\n```\n. added `yLabelFormat` as well.\n. Could you show the issue in a jsbin and could you change the coffeescript file instead of the javascript?\n. Closing this one since there was no response.\n. There is no way to force displaying all the labels. You can rotate them however using yLabelAngle\n. No it's just undocumented as far as I know.\n. You could try using positive numbers, but use xLabelFormat to add a minus\nin front.\nOn Sep 19, 2014 4:18 PM, \"umeshwani\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> I am using the Line chart with negative values which are working great.\n> \n> http://jsbin.com/purayivoleco/1/\n> \n> But I have one question I want to have the -ve values starting from -2006\n> instead of -2012\n> is it possible to force that or is there any workaround for the same.\n> \n> Thanks\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/496.\n. Could you make a jsbin that shows the functionality?\n. Looks very cool, merging this.\n. Are all these commits related? If so, could you squash them? If not, could you make separate pull requests for the different things? Also, could you explain what it does, I haven't used donut charts yet.\n. If you use the js file that is currently on the master branch, you can set the pointSize to zero and the points won't grow.\n. First of all, looking good. I like lean projects as well. However, jQuery also has quite a bit of advantages. First of all, browser compatibility. I like it that stuff just works for different platforms.\n\nSecondly, jQuery can also remove bloat from a project. Most people already include it, especially if they use other javascript heavy libs, like this one. As you can see your commits actually added lines to the codebase, because stuff in jQuery needs to be emulated. This can be solved (like some other libs do) by building a version of the library that needs jquery and one that is stand alone. This is something that would have to be added for me to agree to these commits. \n\nI would love to know what de other developers think of this.\n. This is not possible at the moment. It does seem useful however, so it could be that it will be added in the future.\n. Oh, stupid mistake. I added that for testing myself. And I'll look into the callback, think I've missed that one \n. I changed it to a callback named `barClass` to have the same type of interface as the `barColors` callback.\n. Is the code called after document ready? Or did you make a typo in the container element string?\n. I'm quite sure I fixed this with one of my commits relating to horizontal barcharts. Could you check with the latest compiled js file to see if the problem persists? (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/morrisjs/morris.js/master/morris.js)\n. Ah, I see what you mean. You can use the padding option in that case. By default it's 25. It seems undocumented.\n. If you want you can make a pull request against the gh-pages branch to document it.\n. Hmm, I have no clue why this is happening.\n. Yes, it is because of the something in the code on git. Changing the demo to the latest code on github causes the same in that example. The latest release code doesn't have the problem. So you should try using that one.\n. No, you should use the one in the zip on the main site: https://morrisjs.github.io/morris.js/\nThe one on github is an \"unofficial\" build, because a couple of people wanted horizontal bar charts.\n. Could you make a jsbin where you reproduce the error? It's impossible to know what's wrong otherwise.\n. I have the same problem myself, but haven't figured out why it is slow with a lot of data. \n. It is not yet in the compiled js, only in the coffee code. You can build a js file yourself though by cloning the repository and following these instructions: https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js#developer-quick-start\n. Combining angled labels with setting lower xLabelMargin should probably work.\n. I was hoping to help @luben123. For you I would suggest moddifiying your xLabelFormat to output nothing for the months you don't want to show. \nA less hacky option would be making a pull request where you add a quarter option here:\nhttps://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/blob/1c66cfc4ac7b23d324f131bec7739265887e30fc/lib/morris.line.coffee#L431\n. Yes, something like that.\nI think you might need modulo for initialising the start so it will actually be the same months for every plot. Also, I'm quite sure the +3 in the format should be a +1, since I think it is for getting the actual month number instead of a 0 for January.\n\nCould you change that and test it yourself a bit. If it works I could add it to to the coffee, but you could also make a pull request yourself.\n. It's good that you multiplied it by 3, it is used by the auto chooser. What\nI meant with the modulo was this:\n\n```\n  start: function(d) {\n    return new Date(d.getFullYear(), d.getMonth() - (d.getMonth()%3), 1);\n  },\n```\n\nOn 28 October 2014 15:25, Hermann Herz notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> sorry, I'm not that good in js :(!

You can make barColors a function that returns different colours based on\nif the data point is in the weekend.\n. You can alter the options before pushing and calling setData() like this.\n\n``` javascript\nvar chart = Morris.Line(options);\nchart.options.ykeys.push('y');\nchart.setData(new_data);\n```\n. Currently the best way to do this is just define another line that is the goal, this cannot be done in a barchart ofcourse.\n. Could it be that resp is a json string? Or that the actual data is somewhere deeper in resp?\n. What do you mean by zoom option? \n. There's currently no zoom option. However, you can pass the maxy and miny yourself, so if you make those the max and min of your data it should zoom a bit.\n. You can change any of the options if you set them and then call setData().\n\nOn 11 November 2014 08:12, Alplob notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Hello,\n> \n> I am using morris.js on one page dynamically refreshed with ajax.

This has been fixed by #479 \n. This is not possible, but making a pull request should probably not be that hard.\n. It is not built in. You could however convert the time strings to an integer corresponding to the time first (\"08:15:00\" = 81500). This will make Morris make them the correct height. Then you could use the yLabelFormat option to convert it back to a timestring.\n. You can use xLabelFormat to filter out the labels you do't want.\n\nOn 26 November 2014 at 07:49, Varun006 notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> I want to get line chart same as displayed in image..\n> Eg: x-axis = 10,20,30,40\n> I want the data of 15 to display on line chart without adding 15 to x-axis.\n> \n> [image: morrisjs]\n> https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9958681/5197303/2f3d8fd8-7566-11e4-9531-80f65cdefd0d.jpg\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/532.\n.

Something else you can try is giving the small labels to morris.js and use the hoverCallback to change them to large description for use in the hover legend.\n. Maybe you can use hoverCallback to only show the hover when you are not on a touch device.\n. I will probably need this myself in the near future. So this might be in in a couple of weeks.\n. It just exists, it works the same as for the line chart. It just isn't\ndocumented I think.\nOn Jan 23, 2015 3:48 AM, \"David Bennett\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Also in need of this today, @JelteF https://github.com/JelteF did you\n> get anywhere or should I look at adding it in myself?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/538#issuecomment-71139638.\n. The thing that causes the problem is that you don't have data for every point. This could be solved by just  setting unknown values to 0. However, that shouldn't be needed so this is definitely a bug.\n. Thanks for the pull request. I ran in to this bug myself as well, but haven't had the time to fix it yet. Could you change it so that it always falls back to LineColors, but just has an extra `else if` statement that checks for `type is 'trendline'`.\n\nAlso could you remove the compiled javascript from the commit?\n. Looks great. Could you squash the commits and remove the changes to the js files? I will rebuild those in another commit.\n. Looks good, will merge it after Travis gives the OK.\n. I have no experience with publishing something on npm. I don't use node myself, so I don't really want to put much time in it as well. What would have to be changed?\n\nMeanwhile, couldn't you just try installing from a tarball or one of the other suggested options?\n. That doesn't sound to hard :p. I will try to make a profile and publish it in the near future.\n. I have tried to publish the 0.5.1 tag, please let me know if it works as expected. From what I can see it is called 0.5.0 in npm, but that was fixed by a later pull request I think so no luck there for now.\n. Could you give an example in a jsbin/jsfiddle to show what you mean? \n. And as for the resizeCallback I don't believe there is one.\n. Hmmm, that's not really built in functionality since that is not how you normally use the chart. That info is now in the hover. What you could do is try to supply a hoverCallback that does that.\n. You can just change the options dictionary and call setData afterwards with\nthe data. The new options will be used then.\nOn Feb 4, 2015 12:29 PM, \"nabblschnur\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Yes...

You can use the hovercallback to change the hover element in any way you want.\n. Pfew, not a really nice way, but perhaps you could use goals with a really large goalwidth to achieve something like this. \n. If you change the options object in the graph instance before calling setData on it it will use the new options object. So you could change the ymax/ymin there. \n. graph.options.ymin would also work btw.\n. Could you make a simple jsbin with this shown? It sounds cool.\n. Looks cool. One question,  why have you changed fill-opacity to opacity? \n. Sorry, forgot about this a bit. Looks good to me. \n. Thanks for the pull request.\n. Sounds good, could you change it in the less file instead of in the compiled css?\n. I don't think this is possible\n. It looks like the container has a really low `width`, can you reproduce this is a jsbin? That way I can say more.\n. You could use the hoverCallback function to change the default contents of the hover tooltip.\n. See https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/pull/518\n. It only works for horizontal bar charts though\n. You can use the li items yourself to get the data into javascript and supply it to the constructor of the graph.\n. The main reason is that there is a million ways to lay out data on a page and it differs per person how that is done. The lib supplies an easy JS interface to give it the data and it would get bloated if every way of supplying data would be integrated into it.\n. Thanks\n. You should probably try adding the morris css file: https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/blob/master/morris.css\n. That Is only if you use line charts, this is an area chart. In which the amounts are stacked so the total can be seen easily.\n. Use yLabelFormat\n. How hard would it be to implement this? If not to hard, I might put some time into this.\n. I'm currently working on this. Hoping to get it done in the coming week. There's quite a lot of changes that have to be made for this to work.\n. Pretty big, this is a feature a lot of people want.\n.

Yes, the callback takes a couple of arguments.\n. check out this example: https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/blob/master/examples/bar.html\n. Yes, you can just do:\n\n``` javascript\nchart.on('click', function(i, row) {\n\n})\n```\n\nlike in this example: https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/blob/master/examples/area.html\n. I'll close this one since it is fixed by #147\n. I'm really unsure what you mean\n. This is not built in, but you should just do something with the data in the row object and use it to do something with the DOM. Like changing the data on the page somewhere.\n. I'm going to be working on this in a little while. \n. As you guys can see, I've made a pull request for this feature\n. This is fixed in the right way by #447, which was included in #455. It's just an attribute change which you can do yourself if you want. Marking as closed. \n. Any reason why this is not merged yet? Since #297 has been merged.\n. Fixed my merging #498 \n.

You should probably take a look at the `transY` function in `grid.coffee`, which takes a value and translates it to an Y position. It currently uses linear scaling, but could probably easily be altered to support logarithmic scaling as well.\n. Bootstrap modals expose an event called `shown.bs.modal` and you should probably use that to redraw the graph.\n. There is no destroy method. I have run into that problem myself as well.

Here is the demo: http://jsbin.com/pucadowa/1/edit?js,output\nAnd it seems to fail again because I changed how the hover it's y position is determined. It was needed to actually have the hover over the correct bar (see demo). What's the reasoning behind the current y positioning? I already thought it was a bit weird.\n. I figured out the reason. It was to make sure the hover didn't block the points in a line graph. I added an extra option to the function to make it centre on y and now all the tests pass.\n. Also, I've just emailed @oesmith to ask for official contributor status. Since I think I know the internals of the lib well enough now to be an asset.\n. Fixed that with #457\n. As you can see, it works fine with the code from my new pull request: \nhttp://jsbin.com/pucadowa/8/edit?js,output\n. First of all the fixes in #460 and #474 should be merged since they fix some bugs and after that some documentation should be written for the new features.\n\nUntil then you can build it yourself, although I suggest you merge #460 since line charts will be broken otherwise. And if you want it on the cdn more quickly you can probably help by writing the documentation.\n.

Hmmm,\n\nThat is indeed a weird bug, I'll try to look into it when I have time.\n. Oh, I see it causes some tests to fail. Will check that later.\n. Updated this to not cause an error when null is supplied.\n. This means mostly that you have to much data to show in the graph. Some code to handle the exception would be nice, but physically you're unable to display the data in the graph on the screen real estate you have. \n. First of all, could you remove the compiled js files from your commit? We'll update those in a separate commit. \n\nAnd I think your second test is broken since it doesn't specify the `freePosition` option. I also saw some problems with the code that did that. Could you make an example in jsbin that shows what these features are supposed to do? You can reuse this one, just copy your compiled/minified js in there and change the example code.\n. You have removed the compiled files and committed that, which is not what I meant :wink:. That is also why the jsbin doesn't work anymore since the compiled file is not in your git repo. \n\nCould you make sure that the js files are not changed by your commit?\n. Good call on the tests. Looking forward to that pull request. I see that you changed one of the tests already in this commit. I think it would be better if that was moved to your next one instead of being hidden in this one. \n\nYou can use `git add -p` to only add certain lines and not whole files.\n. Oh and the functionality looks good btw. I'll try to merge it when I have time.\n. Could you still do this?\n. I have reported it through the link. They will probably unblock it.\n. Fixed\n. It is indeed because of how the bezier curves work. I don't know enough of the SVG code to know how to make sure this doesn't happen. and `smooth: 'false'` should indeed remove the problem.\n. I'm using these for dutch values, I haven't taken the effort to make it general an add it to morris itself.\n\n``` javascript\nvar options = {\n    dateFormat: function(x) {\n        return new Date(x).toLocaleDateString('nl-NL');\n    },\n    xLabelFormat: function(x) {\n        return x.toLocaleDateString('nl-NL');\n    },\n    yLabelFormat: function(x) {\n        return x.toLoceleString('nl-NL');\n    },\n};\n```\n. added `yLabelFormat` as well.\n. Could you show the issue in a jsbin and could you change the coffeescript file instead of the javascript?\n. Closing this one since there was no response.\n. There is no way to force displaying all the labels. You can rotate them however using yLabelAngle\n. No it's just undocumented as far as I know.\n. You could try using positive numbers, but use xLabelFormat to add a minus\nin front.\nOn Sep 19, 2014 4:18 PM, \"umeshwani\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> I am using the Line chart with negative values which are working great.\n> \n> http://jsbin.com/purayivoleco/1/\n> \n> But I have one question I want to have the -ve values starting from -2006\n> instead of -2012\n> is it possible to force that or is there any workaround for the same.\n> \n> Thanks\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/496.\n. Could you make a jsbin that shows the functionality?\n. Looks very cool, merging this.\n. Are all these commits related? If so, could you squash them? If not, could you make separate pull requests for the different things? Also, could you explain what it does, I haven't used donut charts yet.\n. If you use the js file that is currently on the master branch, you can set the pointSize to zero and the points won't grow.\n. First of all, looking good. I like lean projects as well. However, jQuery also has quite a bit of advantages. First of all, browser compatibility. I like it that stuff just works for different platforms.\n\nSecondly, jQuery can also remove bloat from a project. Most people already include it, especially if they use other javascript heavy libs, like this one. As you can see your commits actually added lines to the codebase, because stuff in jQuery needs to be emulated. This can be solved (like some other libs do) by building a version of the library that needs jquery and one that is stand alone. This is something that would have to be added for me to agree to these commits. \n\nI would love to know what de other developers think of this.\n. This is not possible at the moment. It does seem useful however, so it could be that it will be added in the future.\n. Oh, stupid mistake. I added that for testing myself. And I'll look into the callback, think I've missed that one \n. I changed it to a callback named `barClass` to have the same type of interface as the `barColors` callback.\n. Is the code called after document ready? Or did you make a typo in the container element string?\n. I'm quite sure I fixed this with one of my commits relating to horizontal barcharts. Could you check with the latest compiled js file to see if the problem persists? (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/morrisjs/morris.js/master/morris.js)\n. Ah, I see what you mean. You can use the padding option in that case. By default it's 25. It seems undocumented.\n. If you want you can make a pull request against the gh-pages branch to document it.\n. Hmm, I have no clue why this is happening.\n. Yes, it is because of the something in the code on git. Changing the demo to the latest code on github causes the same in that example. The latest release code doesn't have the problem. So you should try using that one.\n. No, you should use the one in the zip on the main site: https://morrisjs.github.io/morris.js/\nThe one on github is an \"unofficial\" build, because a couple of people wanted horizontal bar charts.\n. Could you make a jsbin where you reproduce the error? It's impossible to know what's wrong otherwise.\n. I have the same problem myself, but haven't figured out why it is slow with a lot of data. \n. It is not yet in the compiled js, only in the coffee code. You can build a js file yourself though by cloning the repository and following these instructions: https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js#developer-quick-start\n. Combining angled labels with setting lower xLabelMargin should probably work.\n. I was hoping to help @luben123. For you I would suggest moddifiying your xLabelFormat to output nothing for the months you don't want to show. \nA less hacky option would be making a pull request where you add a quarter option here:\nhttps://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/blob/1c66cfc4ac7b23d324f131bec7739265887e30fc/lib/morris.line.coffee#L431\n. Yes, something like that.\nI think you might need modulo for initialising the start so it will actually be the same months for every plot. Also, I'm quite sure the +3 in the format should be a +1, since I think it is for getting the actual month number instead of a 0 for January.\n\nCould you change that and test it yourself a bit. If it works I could add it to to the coffee, but you could also make a pull request yourself.\n. It's good that you multiplied it by 3, it is used by the auto chooser. What\nI meant with the modulo was this:\n\n```\n  start: function(d) {\n    return new Date(d.getFullYear(), d.getMonth() - (d.getMonth()%3), 1);\n  },\n```\n\nOn 28 October 2014 15:25, Hermann Herz notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> sorry, I'm not that good in js :(!

You can make barColors a function that returns different colours based on\nif the data point is in the weekend.\n. You can alter the options before pushing and calling setData() like this.\n\n``` javascript\nvar chart = Morris.Line(options);\nchart.options.ykeys.push('y');\nchart.setData(new_data);\n```\n. Currently the best way to do this is just define another line that is the goal, this cannot be done in a barchart ofcourse.\n. Could it be that resp is a json string? Or that the actual data is somewhere deeper in resp?\n. What do you mean by zoom option? \n. There's currently no zoom option. However, you can pass the maxy and miny yourself, so if you make those the max and min of your data it should zoom a bit.\n. You can change any of the options if you set them and then call setData().\n\nOn 11 November 2014 08:12, Alplob notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Hello,\n> \n> I am using morris.js on one page dynamically refreshed with ajax.

This has been fixed by #479 \n. This is not possible, but making a pull request should probably not be that hard.\n. It is not built in. You could however convert the time strings to an integer corresponding to the time first (\"08:15:00\" = 81500). This will make Morris make them the correct height. Then you could use the yLabelFormat option to convert it back to a timestring.\n. You can use xLabelFormat to filter out the labels you do't want.\n\nOn 26 November 2014 at 07:49, Varun006 notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> I want to get line chart same as displayed in image..\n> Eg: x-axis = 10,20,30,40\n> I want the data of 15 to display on line chart without adding 15 to x-axis.\n> \n> [image: morrisjs]\n> https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9958681/5197303/2f3d8fd8-7566-11e4-9531-80f65cdefd0d.jpg\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/532.\n.

Something else you can try is giving the small labels to morris.js and use the hoverCallback to change them to large description for use in the hover legend.\n. Maybe you can use hoverCallback to only show the hover when you are not on a touch device.\n. I will probably need this myself in the near future. So this might be in in a couple of weeks.\n. It just exists, it works the same as for the line chart.

The thing that causes the problem is that you don't have data for every point. This could be solved by just  setting unknown values to 0. However, that shouldn't be needed so this is definitely a bug.\n. Thanks for the pull request. I ran in to this bug myself as well, but haven't had the time to fix it yet. Could you change it so that it always falls back to LineColors, but just has an extra `else if` statement that checks for `type is 'trendline'`.\n\nAlso could you remove the compiled javascript from the commit?\n. Looks great. Could you squash the commits and remove the changes to the js files? I will rebuild those in another commit.\n. Looks good, will merge it after Travis gives the OK.\n. I have no experience with publishing something on npm. I don't use node myself, so I don't really want to put much time in it as well. What would have to be changed?\n\nMeanwhile, couldn't you just try installing from a tarball or one of the other suggested options?\n. That doesn't sound to hard :p. I will try to make a profile and publish it in the near future.\n. I have tried to publish the 0.5.1 tag, please let me know if it works as expected. From what I can see it is called 0.5.0 in npm, but that was fixed by a later pull request I think so no luck there for now.\n. Could you give an example in a jsbin/jsfiddle to show what you mean? \n. And as for the resizeCallback I don't believe there is one.\n. Hmmm, that's not really built in functionality since that is not how you normally use the chart. That info is now in the hover. What you could do is try to supply a hoverCallback that does that.\n. You can just change the options dictionary and call setData afterwards with\nthe data.

You can use the hovercallback to change the hover element in any way you want.\n. Pfew, not a really nice way, but perhaps you could use goals with a really large goalwidth to achieve something like this. \n. If you change the options object in the graph instance before calling setData on it it will use the new options object. So you could change the ymax/ymin there. \n. graph.options.ymin would also work btw.\n. Could you make a simple jsbin with this shown? It sounds cool.\n. Looks cool. One question,  why have you changed fill-opacity to opacity? \n. Sorry, forgot about this a bit. Looks good to me. \n. Thanks for the pull request.\n. Sounds good, could you change it in the less file instead of in the compiled css?\n. I don't think this is possible\n. It looks like the container has a really low `width`, can you reproduce this is a jsbin? That way I can say more.\n. You could use the hoverCallback function to change the default contents of the hover tooltip.\n. See https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/pull/518\n. It only works for horizontal bar charts though\n. You can use the li items yourself to get the data into javascript and supply it to the constructor of the graph.\n. The main reason is that there is a million ways to lay out data on a page and it differs per person how that is done. The lib supplies an easy JS interface to give it the data and it would get bloated if every way of supplying data would be integrated into it.\n. Thanks\n. You should probably try adding the morris css file: https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/blob/master/morris.css\n. That Is only if you use line charts, this is an area chart.

    "tiraeth": "Due to fact that right now values are taken by their position in Array, it's not easy to fork it. The whole hover rendering (and generating) method needs to be replaced to achieve this. I tried and have come to these conclusions.\n\nPersonal opinion: I think that `Morris.Hover` could be separated same way the `Morris.Grid` is, and using multiple inheritance drawing hovers can be more flexible then. After that, the sorting method could be implemented easily with perspectives for future changes.\n. :+1: on that!\n. When you want to show a trend. For example, you have a line graph that shows you the trend of your site's visits for example. And this is a polyline. You want to compare this value to the whole segment (e.g. other sites within the same network). You can show the segment's average value as a smooth path.\n\nThis is one use case for it.\n\nAs another enhancement I would recommend adding styling to the chart so I can modify the font of categories/y-labels and other things. It would be nice to have a map that would be extended with default values, just like Highcharts allows me. Right now the chart itself is not easily customizable. But these are things I may be working on later due to things I am going to use Morris.js with.\n. Cool, thanks! I am thinking about one more (or two) addons/fixes. The grid. I think that it would be useful to have no horizontal lines (right now, as far as I remember, you can't have it configured) or have vertical lines (grid) in chosen configuration (interval or per category).\n\nSome can find useful to draw grid behind the graph. If we could achieve it, it would be awesome.\n. I think that because Morris.Grid has been introduced, this is now easier than before. **Goals** and **Events** could be implemented to `Morris.Grid` class to allow, respectively, mark value goals and date events.\n\nThe question that probably needs an answer is whether grid lines should respect set goals/events in a context of including them in grid drawing cycle.\n\nOther feature that can be implemented are series-related events that would display a flag at chosen position on series' path.\n. PR #103 adds this functionality. I keep my fingers crossed for accepting this feature :-)\n. ##### How to boost user experience?\n\nDisable `dateFormat` for drawing x-axis labels and allow Morris to put raw x-values :-)\n\n##### How to define gradient in `barFillColors`?\n\nTo setup gradient used for filling a particular series' bars, you have to provide colors, separated by space, for each series. You can provide either two or three colors (for creating 2-color or 3-color gradient, respectively), for example:\n\n``` javascript\nMorris.Bar({\n  element: 'graph',\n  data: [\n    {x: '2011 Q1', y: 3, z: 2, a: 3},\n    {x: '2011 Q2', y: 2, z: 1, a: 1},\n    {x: '2011 Q3', y: 0, z: 2, a: 4},\n    {x: '2011 Q4', y: 4, z: 4, a: 3}\n  ],\n  xkey: 'x',\n  ykeys: ['y', 'z', 'a'],\n  labels: ['Y', 'Z', 'A'],\n  barFillColors: [\n    '#aaa #555',      // from light gray to dark gray (top to bottom)\n    '#555 #aaa black' // from dark day, through light gray, to black\n  ]\n});\n```\n\n**Hint:** All color strings valid for `Raphael.color()` can be used with Morris.Bar. Just don't use space when using `rgb`, `hsb`, or `hsl` color description.\n. Waiting for your changes :+1:\n. Sweet!\n\nAnyway, I will still need to fork Morris.Bar because I do need gradient support for fill attribute. I will work on it and try to give you more solid method for defining bar colors/gradients.\n. Set option: `hideHover` to `false`. This will prevent the popup from being constantly displayed on the graph. It will appear only when you hover the bar/group of bars.\n. `Morris.Bar` extends `Morris.Line` and utilizes this parameter. Setting it to `false` should be enough and I assure you it is.\n. Set this parameter to `true`. I can't explain why I was saying it's `false`.\n. That's always a solution. I thought about gradients because the designer which I am working currently with is putting gradient almost everywhere if the design style requires it :grinning: I am fine with the callback solution. To be honest, I am in a need of either callback or built-in support for gradients :smiley:\n. :+1:\n\nCoffeescript's `reduce` is also better than `for` or `$.each` in some cases. I used it in `Morris.Pie` :grinning:\n. Forgot to mention that there is also a `sortData` option with `true|false|\"asc\"|\"desc\"` values (`true` implies `\"asc\"`). This allows you to sort data by value before creating and rendering segments.\n. I thought the same after writing it (I intentionally was mocking function names and behaviour from `Morris.Donut`). Looking forward for the updated version.\n\nCode extraction, IMO, can be done also on hovering (line, area, bar, maybe **scatter** can be added as an additional plot type, or just as an option to `Morris.Line`). But these require other requests/issues to be created.\n. I will prepare a fix in couple of hours.\n. Tyler, I recommend waiting some time. Olly is going to rewrite hover to use HTML popups and customizing it will be much more simpler.\n. This will be difficult as `Morris.Grid` does not support replacing axis.\n. I suppose you both are talking about HTML-ifing hover popups. This is a subject of Olly's current scope on Morris, as far as I know. We have to wait some time until refactorization of popups is done and fully handled by HTML.\n. This is difficult. We have two cases:\n1. Both data collections contain same `xkey` values (same categories).\n2. Each collection has it's own set of categories (different `xkey` values).\n\nOf course case number 1 is easier to implement. Also, we will need to handle grid drawing in such way that right axis is properly scaled using left axis' grid lines. Please also remember that hovering is per category not per series' point.\n. I think this is out of the scope for the functionality that should be provided with Morris. Probably you will need to prepare a hack for yourself thus I haven't seen anything that would work as you want it to work. What's the purpose of hiding axis labels?\n. Please wait some time until `Morris.Hover` is derived for handling popups and co-work with hilights. It's options list will for sure provide an ability to disable popups.\n. They could but I prefer loose coupling between library's elements and picked the multiple inheritance as they way of handling hovering. Anyway, the decision is yours - if you prefer to combine the Morris.Hover with Morris.Grid - you're free to do so. I will be happy with _any_ kind of merge of the functionality.\n\nI am currently thinking of providing same functionality to Morris.Donut and Morris.Pie of mine (which I am looking forward to be merged into master, after some refactoring and combining done with donut, maybe single class?). Having HTML hovering there would handle current labeling for Donut while allowing users to decide how they want to show the popup.\n\nAlso, when I proposed _alerts_ and _goals_ I was waiting for HTML hover to provide functionality also to these two new elements of Line/Area charts.\n\nPreferably, for each hover event a callback (using _on_ for Morris.EventEmitter) for more user action would be triggered. This will for sure allow customizing the position, content, and styling of the popup - if the case requires it.\n. LGTM. Please prepare a separete example file and revert `bar.html` to the original one. This will allow Olly to merge changes with one click :-)\n. Please disable time parsing for first chart. This may be the issue.\n. This is not a scope of functionality that Morris.js provides. To display the gauge directly please use Raphael.\n\nFortunately I was working on such functionality because I needed it too. It's here: https://gist.github.com/4139118\n\nI may prepare a PR for this but I am not sure if such functionality is needed.\n. This is for sure a good thing to have. When Olly merges my HTML popup replacement I will work on providing same functionality for events/goals. Right now it isn't easy to implement labels for events/goals. Please remember that the label shouldn't be covered by a series popup.\n. Each segment has it's own `path`. What does that mean? It means that we can use `Element.click()` on it (http://raphaeljs.com/reference.html#Element.click).\n\nI am currently going to rewrite Pie and Donut as I need them both in my cases and see the usefullness of this feature. Please hold few days until the push request is presented.\n. My PR for Pie and Donut charts include these callbacks. Line/Area/Bar chart do not support it. Yet.\n. https://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/pull/133 Support for `click` event in current `master` branch.\n. In my opinion (and Google's), [not at all](https://www.google.pl/search?q=donut+chart&sugexp=chrome,mod%3D5&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hl=pl&tbm=isch&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi&ei=jWLAUM3ZJITDhAfKkIHAAQ&biw=1163&bih=635&sei=j2LAUNH1II21hAfR_IHYCQ). The whole point of donut is to show **multiple** series. And this is something I am currently working on - multiple series per one donut chart (that's why I presented the class with `@options.width`).\n\nAnyway, when we switch the labelling to HTML (please consider my other PR) it will be possible to customize it so it can be drawn inside the hole.\n\nTherefore I have multiple cases where I need donut chart and don't find it useful to have something inside the hole.\n. So you can merge the PR as it is now or wait few days (maybe just 48hrs) until a commit with multiple series support is added :)\n. Sure, I will provide as much tests as I can for such functionality.\n\nIf it goes to pre-saving existing behaviour. Having fully functioning donut chart (with multiple series) won't work well with label inside the hole. I recommend dropping such functionality. Having current way of displaying the label is sufficient in my opinion. When you decide to include HTML hovers, I can work on Pie and Donut to support it.\n. Olly, can you merge this PR please?\n. Hilight does not utilize css only. So this won't work at all. Also, `Morris` is using some internal events to show the popup and so on.\n\nThe only solution is to provide a public api inside Morris that will be available for users, e.g. hilighting specific data row (but this, I suppose, works now).\n. JavaScript's code gets executed before the DOM contains `#annual` element. Put the javascript after the `div` or use `jQuery.ready()`.\n. As far as I know, this is already done by **dynaum** as stacked bars in #120.\n. I will look into #120 and try to provide such functionality as an add-on to\nstacked bars.\n. **Tomorrow I will introduce a new option** to `Morris.Bar` called `accumulate: true|false (default: true)`. If it's value is `true`, the chart will look as it looks now (for each data row the upper bound for the bar will be the sum of all series in this row) but if you set it to `false`, each data row series will get sorted ascending and drew bottom-up so the upper bound will be the maximum for the given row. In this case, you will achieve exactly what you expect to get.\n. #148 Somehow solves @dynaum's issue, but it requires to have consistent value domain for the whole chart (so no mixing %'s and #'s is allowed).\n. This is UI-specific and in my opinion should be handled on your end. For instance, you can test `.data` property of the object created with `Morris.Line` to see if the data is set correctly and if not - provide a placeholder.\n. The solution is to, in my opinion, provide a multi-usage option `barRadius` which would accept values in exactly the same manner as CSS property `border-radius` does.\n- `barRadius: \"none\"` (no rounded corners)\n- `barRadius: \"5px\"` (all to 5px)\n- `barRadius: \"5px 6px\"` (left corners 5px, right corners 6px\n- `barRadius: \"5px 6px 7px\"` (left corners 5px, right top corner 6px right bottom corner 7px)\n- `barRadius: \"5px 6px 7px 8px\"` (as above but bottom left corner 8px)\n\nAnd get rid of `barShape` option.\n. The encapsulation you proposed breaks **at least one** ([Single Responsibility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle)) of the principles from SOLID and other good practices. If Morris goes that way, don't want to imagine what it will look like after few months.\n\nMaking Morris.js SVG-dependant you're taking at last 15% of the market off the lane for using it. I'd stick to morris-provided events and incrementally update the list of options, providing more customization settings.\n. Very ugly PR, I know. But there are many who are waiting for this.\n. Yes it does.\n\n``` javascript\nvar options = {}; // you know what to do with it...\nvar chart = new Morris.Pie(options);\n\nchart.on('click', function(id, row){\n  console.log(id, row);\n});\n\nchart.on('hover', function(id, row){\n  console.log(id, row);\n});\n```\n. I do understand your POV. But I think that if you want Morris to be used wider (and I think you want) some functionality should be changed to use the ones users are used to.\n\nI think that tooltips should be controlled by CSS (html ones, like in other charts). Displaying the value (and label) as you do right now could be controlled by `hover` event on the chart. I think that you should support the conventional behaviour and give people a way to accomplish more sophisticated changes.\n\nAnd more, I think that donut chart _should_ in near future support multiple series, because that's the purpose of displaying data in donut instead of a pie.\n. Usage simplicity (and small amount of code) does not imply the lack of some functionaltiy. But I understand you and won't insist on pushing functionality you object to. Others can always use one of forked repositories (mine, for instance) if they want to.\n\nThanks for the great work you are doing here :+1:\n. See `/examples` directory. These are using the new charts.\n. This is also something I need. E.g. I am displaying number of people doing something and get yLabels with values like **5.25 people**. Awkward, isn't it ;) ?\n\nProbably I will post a PR in a couple of days. This will also include rounding to nearest `10-th`, `100-th` and so on.\n. Annotations can be series aware while events can't and shouldn't. The idea\nwas to fully replace events with annotations due to users habits.\n1 kwi 2013 22:19, \"Olly Smith\" notifications@github.com napisa\u00b3(a):\n\n> Why have this feature as well as events?\n> \n> IMHO, it's feature bloat.

Please take a look into the source code and see available options.\n. Available in https://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/pull/149. Waiting until @oesmith merges it.\n. First of all, what kind of conflict do you experience? Morris.js **requires** jQuery and Raphael.js. If there is a conflict between MooTools and jQuery, you can try to load jQuery in non-conflict mode.\n\nSecondly, there is **no** problem with loading chart data from json file or even a web service. Make a GET request for the data using jQuery's or MooTool's AJAX utilities and create instance of chosen Morris chart type using the data you received from AJAX request.\n. Escape quote characters inside the tag, because `console.log($('#genders_chart').data('emp_spec_views'))` probably will yeld nothing more that just `[{`.\n. I meant the spot where you display `content_tag`. I suspect that you are displaying something like this (with errors):\n\n``` html\n<div data-emp_spec_views=\"[{\"a\": \"b\"}]\"></div>\n```\n. Three solutions:\n1. Update your `content_tag` in ERB to use `html_safe` string with json code (google it).\n2. Don't use `data` attribute for storing such data - https://gist.github.com/tiraeth/5271207#file-solution1-erb\n3. Don't duplicate data that you already have in the table - https://gist.github.com/tiraeth/5271207#file-solution2-erb\n. In `Morris.Bar` pass `data` variable as `data` key in options, like:\n\n``` javascript\nMorris.Bar({\n  element: 'genders_chart',\n  data: data,\n  xkey: 'specialization_name',\n  ykeys: ['number_of_employees'],\n  labels: ['Number Of Employees'],\n  hideHover: 'true',\n  barColors: function (row, series, type) {\n    if (type === 'bar') {\n      var blue = Math.floor(255 * row.y / this.ymax);\n      return 'rgb(' + blue + ',0,0)';\n    }\n    else {\n      return '#000';\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n. Use `Morris.Donut` instead of `Morris.Bar` to display it in donut chart. There is no pie chart in Morris' `master` branch. You will have to use my fork with new pie/donut charts.\n. `setData()`? This will automatically call `redraw` if second parameter is omitted.\n. ``` javascript\nvar chart = Morris.Pie({ ... });\n\nvar asyncCallback = function(newData) {\n  chart.setData(newData); // this will redraw the chart\n};\n```\n. Perhaps. Why are you replacing the data when you receive a single element? When received, append it to the array (`graph_data`) and call `setData` with the appended array.\n\n``` javascript\nvar graph_data = [{time:\"2013-04-03\", value: \"4\"}];\n\nvar shoreham_g = Morris.Line({\n  element: 'line-example',\n  data: graph_data,\n  xkey: 'time',\n  ykeys: ['value'],\n  labels: ['wind'],\n  gridEnabled: false\n});\n\nvar pusher = new Pusher('xxxx');\nvar channel_weather = pusher.subscribe('weather-channel');\n\nchannel_weather.bind('new_shoreham_event', function(data){\n  graph_data.push({\n    time: data.observation_time,\n    value: data.windspeedMiles\n  });\n\n  shoreham_g.setData(graph_data);\n});\n```\n. Can you provide a code that you are using? Put it in jsbin.com or similiar. No idea what you're doing wrong without taking a look at the code.\n. Which version of Morris are you using? Can you reproduce the error using jsbin.com or similiar?\n. _Edit: I've managed to disable the auto select by commenting out line 1430 in morris.js, but is there a way to deselect the segment after mouse out?_\n\nImpossible in master. Possible in my version of dunut/pie.\n\n_Edit2: Also, is there a callback when entering, leaving a segment? I'd like to create a inner circle div that get's faded in when a user hovers on a segment, and have it faded out when the users leaves it._\n\nAlso not possible. In my version, I support `hover` action, but no separation on over/out. Yet\u2026\n. Replace line https://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/blob/master/lib/morris.donut.coffee#L102 with:\n\n``` coffeescript\n    @fire 'click', idx, @data[idx]\n```\n\nYou can remove line 101.\n\nThe \"unused variable\" in https://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/commit/5d9bf447c517531542a9d294f99d01d963892a8b was used actually there. Also, replacing `idx` with `index` broke the above line.\n\nI will prepare a PR in a sec.\n. @oesmith ping\n. Can you please add some specs to make sure everything works as it should?\n\nAnd why are you displaying a regular date (if it's correct, probably the first day of given week) in `fmt`? Shouldn't it we something like \"2013 W5\"?\n. Commit the changes and push to your branch.\n\nIf it goes to writing specs, take a look in spec folder to see all tests\nfor Morris.\n12 kwi 2013 15:37, \"t3chn0r\" notifications@github.com napisa\u00b3(a):\n\n> Any idea where I have to go to edit the PR? I'm new to Github...\n> \n> ## \n> \n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/pull/219#issuecomment-16293147\n> .\n. To update your PR just push changes to your repository's branch.\n\n``` bash\n$ git commit -m 'some additional updates'\n$ git push origin patch-1\n```\n\nAll new commits for this branch will automatically update this PR.\n. It's not a good idea to add behaviour to existing objects/classes that you don't own. I think that `fmt` function should calculate the week number itself.\n. Yes, **events** are for vertical lines, and **goals** are for horizontal lines.\n. It means that even if you provide dates as xkeys, Morris won't re-order the data like it does for Line and Area charts. It will treat xkeys like categories.\n\nYou probably misunderstood the note.\n. Because you did not use an array in `eventLineColors` option. See code below.\n\n``` javascript\nvar chart = Morris.Line({\n  element: 'line-example',\n  xkey: 'time',\n  xLabelMargin: 1,\n  data: graph_data,\n  ykeys: ['a','b'],\n  labels: ['aa','bb'],\n  events: ['2013-02-01','2013-02-02','2013-02-05'],\n  eventLineColors:[\"#999\"]\n});\n```\n. You can try to use formatter for Y Axis. So provide inversed values (1/y) to `data` and format it properly (once again use 1/y).\n\nhttp://jsbin.com/uqawig/641/\n. You have to also change the data set you're passing to Morris.\n\nhttp://jsbin.com/uqawig/650/\n. Please look into the code next time. You can re-use `Morris.commas` in your formatted (in fact it is used in default formatting callback).\n\nhttp://jsbin.com/uqawig/654/\n. Not possible in **oesmith/master**. Somehow standarized in my fork but also not able to change the styling on-the-fly.\n\nThere was an idea of providing hovers built with HTML (like line charts) so users could style them and even display in the donut's hole. But it's not (and probably won't be) implemented.\n. Can you put the example on jsbin.com or something similar?\n. @oesmith I may find some time and develop xLabels rotation.\n. Though about it too, but wasn't sure if it should be introduced right now. :+1: \n. 1. Add const to bar values.\n2. Use `yLabelFormat` to show the value without the consts.\n\nExample: http://jsbin.com/ufenus/1/ - assumes that `data` is already modified with const of value `40`.\n. You need a server-side tool for conversion. You can use **node.js** with **PhantomJS** for this, for example. SVG can be converted to high-res PNG.\n. I would go with different values for `axes` instead of separate options, like:\n- `true` or `both` for both enabled\n- `false` for both disabled\n- `x` for X enabled, Y disabled\n- `y` for X disabled, Y enabled\n\nThe advantage of the proposed solution is that we're not introducing BCB (you don't do so either but this don't add additional options).\n. Their y-position should be rounded to the nearest pixel and shifted by 0.5px. Prepare a PR if you want to fix this.\n. Due to fact that right now values are taken by their position in Array, it's not easy to fork it. The whole hover rendering (and generating) method needs to be replaced to achieve this. I tried and have come to these conclusions.\n\nPersonal opinion: I think that `Morris.Hover` could be separated same way the `Morris.Grid` is, and using multiple inheritance drawing hovers can be more flexible then. After that, the sorting method could be implemented easily with perspectives for future changes.\n. :+1: on that!\n. When you want to show a trend. For example, you have a line graph that shows you the trend of your site's visits for example. And this is a polyline. You want to compare this value to the whole segment (e.g. other sites within the same network). You can show the segment's average value as a smooth path.\n\nThis is one use case for it.\n\nAs another enhancement I would recommend adding styling to the chart so I can modify the font of categories/y-labels and other things. It would be nice to have a map that would be extended with default values, just like Highcharts allows me. Right now the chart itself is not easily customizable. But these are things I may be working on later due to things I am going to use Morris.js with.\n. Cool, thanks! I am thinking about one more (or two) addons/fixes. The grid. I think that it would be useful to have no horizontal lines (right now, as far as I remember, you can't have it configured) or have vertical lines (grid) in chosen configuration (interval or per category).\n\nSome can find useful to draw grid behind the graph. If we could achieve it, it would be awesome.\n. I think that because Morris.Grid has been introduced, this is now easier than before. **Goals** and **Events** could be implemented to `Morris.Grid` class to allow, respectively, mark value goals and date events.\n\nThe question that probably needs an answer is whether grid lines should respect set goals/events in a context of including them in grid drawing cycle.\n\nOther feature that can be implemented are series-related events that would display a flag at chosen position on series' path.\n. PR #103 adds this functionality. I keep my fingers crossed for accepting this feature :-)\n. ##### How to boost user experience?\n\nDisable `dateFormat` for drawing x-axis labels and allow Morris to put raw x-values :-)\n\n##### How to define gradient in `barFillColors`?\n\nTo setup gradient used for filling a particular series' bars, you have to provide colors, separated by space, for each series. You can provide either two or three colors (for creating 2-color or 3-color gradient, respectively), for example:\n\n``` javascript\nMorris.Bar({\n  element: 'graph',\n  data: [\n    {x: '2011 Q1', y: 3, z: 2, a: 3},\n    {x: '2011 Q2', y: 2, z: 1, a: 1},\n    {x: '2011 Q3', y: 0, z: 2, a: 4},\n    {x: '2011 Q4', y: 4, z: 4, a: 3}\n  ],\n  xkey: 'x',\n  ykeys: ['y', 'z', 'a'],\n  labels: ['Y', 'Z', 'A'],\n  barFillColors: [\n    '#aaa #555',      // from light gray to dark gray (top to bottom)\n    '#555 #aaa black' // from dark day, through light gray, to black\n  ]\n});\n```\n\n**Hint:** All color strings valid for `Raphael.color()` can be used with Morris.Bar. Just don't use space when using `rgb`, `hsb`, or `hsl` color description.\n. Waiting for your changes :+1:\n. Sweet!\n\nAnyway, I will still need to fork Morris.Bar because I do need gradient support for fill attribute. I will work on it and try to give you more solid method for defining bar colors/gradients.\n. Set option: `hideHover` to `false`. This will prevent the popup from being constantly displayed on the graph. It will appear only when you hover the bar/group of bars.\n. `Morris.Bar` extends `Morris.Line` and utilizes this parameter. Setting it to `false` should be enough and I assure you it is.\n. Set this parameter to `true`. I can't explain why I was saying it's `false`.\n. That's always a solution. I thought about gradients because the designer which I am working currently with is putting gradient almost everywhere if the design style requires it :grinning: I am fine with the callback solution. To be honest, I am in a need of either callback or built-in support for gradients :smiley:\n. :+1:\n\nCoffeescript's `reduce` is also better than `for` or `$.each` in some cases. I used it in `Morris.Pie` :grinning:\n. Forgot to mention that there is also a `sortData` option with `true|false|\"asc\"|\"desc\"` values (`true` implies `\"asc\"`). This allows you to sort data by value before creating and rendering segments.\n. I thought the same after writing it (I intentionally was mocking function names and behaviour from `Morris.Donut`). Looking forward for the updated version.\n\nCode extraction, IMO, can be done also on hovering (line, area, bar, maybe **scatter** can be added as an additional plot type, or just as an option to `Morris.Line`). But these require other requests/issues to be created.\n. I will prepare a fix in couple of hours.\n. Tyler, I recommend waiting some time. Olly is going to rewrite hover to use HTML popups and customizing it will be much more simpler.\n. This will be difficult as `Morris.Grid` does not support replacing axis.\n. I suppose you both are talking about HTML-ifing hover popups. This is a subject of Olly's current scope on Morris, as far as I know. We have to wait some time until refactorization of popups is done and fully handled by HTML.\n. This is difficult. We have two cases:\n1. Both data collections contain same `xkey` values (same categories).\n2. Each collection has it's own set of categories (different `xkey` values).\n\nOf course case number 1 is easier to implement. Also, we will need to handle grid drawing in such way that right axis is properly scaled using left axis' grid lines. Please also remember that hovering is per category not per series' point.\n. I think this is out of the scope for the functionality that should be provided with Morris. Probably you will need to prepare a hack for yourself thus I haven't seen anything that would work as you want it to work. What's the purpose of hiding axis labels?\n. Please wait some time until `Morris.Hover` is derived for handling popups and co-work with hilights. It's options list will for sure provide an ability to disable popups.\n. They could but I prefer loose coupling between library's elements and picked the multiple inheritance as they way of handling hovering. Anyway, the decision is yours - if you prefer to combine the Morris.Hover with Morris.Grid - you're free to do so. I will be happy with _any_ kind of merge of the functionality.\n\nI am currently thinking of providing same functionality to Morris.Donut and Morris.Pie of mine (which I am looking forward to be merged into master, after some refactoring and combining done with donut, maybe single class?). Having HTML hovering there would handle current labeling for Donut while allowing users to decide how they want to show the popup.\n\nAlso, when I proposed _alerts_ and _goals_ I was waiting for HTML hover to provide functionality also to these two new elements of Line/Area charts.\n\nPreferably, for each hover event a callback (using _on_ for Morris.EventEmitter) for more user action would be triggered. This will for sure allow customizing the position, content, and styling of the popup - if the case requires it.\n. LGTM. Please prepare a separete example file and revert `bar.html` to the original one. This will allow Olly to merge changes with one click :-)\n. Please disable time parsing for first chart. This may be the issue.\n. This is not a scope of functionality that Morris.js provides. To display the gauge directly please use Raphael.\n\nFortunately I was working on such functionality because I needed it too. It's here: https://gist.github.com/4139118\n\nI may prepare a PR for this but I am not sure if such functionality is needed.\n. This is for sure a good thing to have. When Olly merges my HTML popup replacement I will work on providing same functionality for events/goals. Right now it isn't easy to implement labels for events/goals. Please remember that the label shouldn't be covered by a series popup.\n. Each segment has it's own `path`. What does that mean? It means that we can use `Element.click()` on it (http://raphaeljs.com/reference.html#Element.click).\n\nI am currently going to rewrite Pie and Donut as I need them both in my cases and see the usefullness of this feature. Please hold few days until the push request is presented.\n. My PR for Pie and Donut charts include these callbacks. Line/Area/Bar chart do not support it. Yet.\n. https://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/pull/133 Support for `click` event in current `master` branch.\n. In my opinion (and Google's), [not at all](https://www.google.pl/search?q=donut+chart&sugexp=chrome,mod%3D5&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hl=pl&tbm=isch&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi&ei=jWLAUM3ZJITDhAfKkIHAAQ&biw=1163&bih=635&sei=j2LAUNH1II21hAfR_IHYCQ). The whole point of donut is to show **multiple** series. And this is something I am currently working on - multiple series per one donut chart (that's why I presented the class with `@options.width`).\n\nAnyway, when we switch the labelling to HTML (please consider my other PR) it will be possible to customize it so it can be drawn inside the hole.\n\nTherefore I have multiple cases where I need donut chart and don't find it useful to have something inside the hole.\n. So you can merge the PR as it is now or wait few days (maybe just 48hrs) until a commit with multiple series support is added :)\n. Sure, I will provide as much tests as I can for such functionality.\n\nIf it goes to pre-saving existing behaviour. Having fully functioning donut chart (with multiple series) won't work well with label inside the hole. I recommend dropping such functionality. Having current way of displaying the label is sufficient in my opinion. When you decide to include HTML hovers, I can work on Pie and Donut to support it.\n. Olly, can you merge this PR please?\n. Hilight does not utilize css only. So this won't work at all. Also, `Morris` is using some internal events to show the popup and so on.\n\nThe only solution is to provide a public api inside Morris that will be available for users, e.g. hilighting specific data row (but this, I suppose, works now).\n. JavaScript's code gets executed before the DOM contains `#annual` element. Put the javascript after the `div` or use `jQuery.ready()`.\n. As far as I know, this is already done by **dynaum** as stacked bars in #120.\n. I will look into #120 and try to provide such functionality as an add-on to\nstacked bars.\n. **Tomorrow I will introduce a new option** to `Morris.Bar` called `accumulate: true|false (default: true)`. If it's value is `true`, the chart will look as it looks now (for each data row the upper bound for the bar will be the sum of all series in this row) but if you set it to `false`, each data row series will get sorted ascending and drew bottom-up so the upper bound will be the maximum for the given row. In this case, you will achieve exactly what you expect to get.\n. #148 Somehow solves @dynaum's issue, but it requires to have consistent value domain for the whole chart (so no mixing %'s and #'s is allowed).\n. This is UI-specific and in my opinion should be handled on your end. For instance, you can test `.data` property of the object created with `Morris.Line` to see if the data is set correctly and if not - provide a placeholder.\n. The solution is to, in my opinion, provide a multi-usage option `barRadius` which would accept values in exactly the same manner as CSS property `border-radius` does.\n- `barRadius: \"none\"` (no rounded corners)\n- `barRadius: \"5px\"` (all to 5px)\n- `barRadius: \"5px 6px\"` (left corners 5px, right corners 6px\n- `barRadius: \"5px 6px 7px\"` (left corners 5px, right top corner 6px right bottom corner 7px)\n- `barRadius: \"5px 6px 7px 8px\"` (as above but bottom left corner 8px)\n\nAnd get rid of `barShape` option.\n. The encapsulation you proposed breaks **at least one** ([Single Responsibility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle)) of the principles from SOLID and other good practices. If Morris goes that way, don't want to imagine what it will look like after few months.\n\nMaking Morris.js SVG-dependant you're taking at last 15% of the market off the lane for using it. I'd stick to morris-provided events and incrementally update the list of options, providing more customization settings.\n. Very ugly PR, I know. But there are many who are waiting for this.\n. Yes it does.\n\n``` javascript\nvar options = {}; // you know what to do with it...\nvar chart = new Morris.Pie(options);\n\nchart.on('click', function(id, row){\n  console.log(id, row);\n});\n\nchart.on('hover', function(id, row){\n  console.log(id, row);\n});\n```\n. I do understand your POV. But I think that if you want Morris to be used wider (and I think you want) some functionality should be changed to use the ones users are used to.\n\nI think that tooltips should be controlled by CSS (html ones, like in other charts). Displaying the value (and label) as you do right now could be controlled by `hover` event on the chart. I think that you should support the conventional behaviour and give people a way to accomplish more sophisticated changes.\n\nAnd more, I think that donut chart _should_ in near future support multiple series, because that's the purpose of displaying data in donut instead of a pie.\n. Usage simplicity (and small amount of code) does not imply the lack of some functionaltiy. But I understand you and won't insist on pushing functionality you object to. Others can always use one of forked repositories (mine, for instance) if they want to.\n\nThanks for the great work you are doing here :+1:\n. See `/examples` directory. These are using the new charts.\n. This is also something I need. E.g. I am displaying number of people doing something and get yLabels with values like **5.25 people**. Awkward, isn't it ;) ?\n\nProbably I will post a PR in a couple of days. This will also include rounding to nearest `10-th`, `100-th` and so on.\n. Annotations can be series aware while events can't and shouldn't. The idea\nwas to fully replace events with annotations due to users habits.\n1 kwi 2013 22:19, \"Olly Smith\" notifications@github.com napisa\u00b3(a):\n\n> Why have this feature as well as events?\n> \n> IMHO, it's feature bloat.

You can use a callback function as `lineColors` property. Please refer to the source code and you will find which (and in what order) parameters/variables will be available to you.\n. Right now you have to provide a callback function for `lineColors` options parameter and not rely on the array.\n\nPlease wait until tomorrow and I will provide you with a working example on jsfiddle.com.\n. Here you go mate: http://jsfiddle.net/ZnzbB/\n\nI decided to drop the idea of callback function (the implementation gets longer than it's necessary) so I came up with additional method for Morris.Line (injected using prototype-inheritance). This seems to look nicer.\n. Please find my bug fix in issues list that refer this problem.\n24 sty 2013 11:32, \"adampope\" notifications@github.com napisa\u00b3(a):\n\n> The new HTML only hover info windows from #134https://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/issues/134don't obey the hideHover option so they don't disappear when you move your\n> mouse out of a graph\n> \n> ## \n> \n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/issues/169.\n. https://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/pull/153\n\nThere is no true/false anymore. Please take a look into the source code and see available options.\n. Available in https://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/pull/149. Waiting until @oesmith merges it.\n. First of all, what kind of conflict do you experience? Morris.js **requires** jQuery and Raphael.js. If there is a conflict between MooTools and jQuery, you can try to load jQuery in non-conflict mode.\n\nSecondly, there is **no** problem with loading chart data from json file or even a web service. Make a GET request for the data using jQuery's or MooTool's AJAX utilities and create instance of chosen Morris chart type using the data you received from AJAX request.\n. Escape quote characters inside the tag, because `console.log($('#genders_chart').data('emp_spec_views'))` probably will yeld nothing more that just `[{`.\n. I meant the spot where you display `content_tag`. I suspect that you are displaying something like this (with errors):\n\n``` html\n<div data-emp_spec_views=\"[{\"a\": \"b\"}]\"></div>\n```\n. Three solutions:\n1. Update your `content_tag` in ERB to use `html_safe` string with json code (google it).\n2. Don't use `data` attribute for storing such data - https://gist.github.com/tiraeth/5271207#file-solution1-erb\n3. Don't duplicate data that you already have in the table - https://gist.github.com/tiraeth/5271207#file-solution2-erb\n. In `Morris.Bar` pass `data` variable as `data` key in options, like:\n\n``` javascript\nMorris.Bar({\n  element: 'genders_chart',\n  data: data,\n  xkey: 'specialization_name',\n  ykeys: ['number_of_employees'],\n  labels: ['Number Of Employees'],\n  hideHover: 'true',\n  barColors: function (row, series, type) {\n    if (type === 'bar') {\n      var blue = Math.floor(255 * row.y / this.ymax);\n      return 'rgb(' + blue + ',0,0)';\n    }\n    else {\n      return '#000';\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n. Use `Morris.Donut` instead of `Morris.Bar` to display it in donut chart. There is no pie chart in Morris' `master` branch. You will have to use my fork with new pie/donut charts.\n. `setData()`? This will automatically call `redraw` if second parameter is omitted.\n. ``` javascript\nvar chart = Morris.Pie({ ... });\n\nvar asyncCallback = function(newData) {\n  chart.setData(newData); // this will redraw the chart\n};\n```\n. Perhaps. Why are you replacing the data when you receive a single element? When received, append it to the array (`graph_data`) and call `setData` with the appended array.\n\n``` javascript\nvar graph_data = [{time:\"2013-04-03\", value: \"4\"}];\n\nvar shoreham_g = Morris.Line({\n  element: 'line-example',\n  data: graph_data,\n  xkey: 'time',\n  ykeys: ['value'],\n  labels: ['wind'],\n  gridEnabled: false\n});\n\nvar pusher = new Pusher('xxxx');\nvar channel_weather = pusher.subscribe('weather-channel');\n\nchannel_weather.bind('new_shoreham_event', function(data){\n  graph_data.push({\n    time: data.observation_time,\n    value: data.windspeedMiles\n  });\n\n  shoreham_g.setData(graph_data);\n});\n```\n. Can you provide a code that you are using? Put it in jsbin.com or similiar. No idea what you're doing wrong without taking a look at the code.\n. Which version of Morris are you using? Can you reproduce the error using jsbin.com or similiar?\n. _Edit: I've managed to disable the auto select by commenting out line 1430 in morris.js, but is there a way to deselect the segment after mouse out?_\n\nImpossible in master. Possible in my version of dunut/pie.\n\n_Edit2: Also, is there a callback when entering, leaving a segment? I'd like to create a inner circle div that get's faded in when a user hovers on a segment, and have it faded out when the users leaves it._\n\nAlso not possible. In my version, I support `hover` action, but no separation on over/out. Yet\u2026\n. Replace line https://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/blob/master/lib/morris.donut.coffee#L102 with:\n\n``` coffeescript\n    @fire 'click', idx, @data[idx]\n```\n\nYou can remove line 101.\n\nThe \"unused variable\" in https://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/commit/5d9bf447c517531542a9d294f99d01d963892a8b was used actually there. Also, replacing `idx` with `index` broke the above line.\n\nI will prepare a PR in a sec.\n. @oesmith ping\n. Can you please add some specs to make sure everything works as it should?\n\nAnd why are you displaying a regular date (if it's correct, probably the first day of given week) in `fmt`? Shouldn't it we something like \"2013 W5\"?\n. Commit the changes and push to your branch.\n\nIf it goes to writing specs, take a look in spec folder to see all tests\nfor Morris.\n12 kwi 2013 15:37, \"t3chn0r\" notifications@github.com napisa\u00b3(a):\n\n> Any idea where I have to go to edit the PR?

To update your PR just push changes to your repository's branch.\n\n``` bash\n$ git commit -m 'some additional updates'\n$ git push origin patch-1\n```\n\nAll new commits for this branch will automatically update this PR.\n. It's not a good idea to add behaviour to existing objects/classes that you don't own. I think that `fmt` function should calculate the week number itself.\n. Yes, **events** are for vertical lines, and **goals** are for horizontal lines.\n. It means that even if you provide dates as xkeys, Morris won't re-order the data like it does for Line and Area charts. It will treat xkeys like categories.\n\nYou probably misunderstood the note.\n. Because you did not use an array in `eventLineColors` option. See code below.\n\n``` javascript\nvar chart = Morris.Line({\n  element: 'line-example',\n  xkey: 'time',\n  xLabelMargin: 1,\n  data: graph_data,\n  ykeys: ['a','b'],\n  labels: ['aa','bb'],\n  events: ['2013-02-01','2013-02-02','2013-02-05'],\n  eventLineColors:[\"#999\"]\n});\n```\n. You can try to use formatter for Y Axis. So provide inversed values (1/y) to `data` and format it properly (once again use 1/y).\n\nhttp://jsbin.com/uqawig/641/\n. You have to also change the data set you're passing to Morris.\n\nhttp://jsbin.com/uqawig/650/\n. Please look into the code next time. You can re-use `Morris.commas` in your formatted (in fact it is used in default formatting callback).\n\nhttp://jsbin.com/uqawig/654/\n. Not possible in **oesmith/master**. Somehow standarized in my fork but also not able to change the styling on-the-fly.\n\nThere was an idea of providing hovers built with HTML (like line charts) so users could style them and even display in the donut's hole. But it's not (and probably won't be) implemented.\n. Can you put the example on jsbin.com or something similar?\n. @oesmith I may find some time and develop xLabels rotation.\n. Though about it too, but wasn't sure if it should be introduced right now. :+1: \n. 1. Add const to bar values.\n2. Use `yLabelFormat` to show the value without the consts.\n\nExample: http://jsbin.com/ufenus/1/ - assumes that `data` is already modified with const of value `40`.\n. You need a server-side tool for conversion. You can use **node.js** with **PhantomJS** for this, for example. SVG can be converted to high-res PNG.\n. I would go with different values for `axes` instead of separate options, like:\n- `true` or `both` for both enabled\n- `false` for both disabled\n- `x` for X enabled, Y disabled\n- `y` for X disabled, Y enabled\n\nThe advantage of the proposed solution is that we're not introducing BCB (you don't do so either but this don't add additional options).\n. Their y-position should be rounded to the nearest pixel and shifted by 0.5px. Prepare a PR if you want to fix this.\n. ",

I'm not sure that is the best option for a touch device either, as the screen is likely smaller too. How about using a legend element?\n. Snap is interesting, but IE9+ only. At the moment Raphael gives IE8 support, and provides enough SVG functionality for what is needed. Perhaps something to look at when IE8 support is no longer an issue?\n. ",

    "addymandial": "is there any way to remove onclick event? i am using nested bar graph where it adding onclick two times.\n. is there any way to remove onclick event? i am using nested bar graph where it adding onclick two times.\n. ",
    "sudodoki": "Just deregister handler with $.fn.off for given selector, maybe?\n. Coming back to this PR have few questions:\n1) @oesmith , are you objecting including this Pie-Componennt into core library at all?\n2) @tiraeth, since Morris is rather straightforward, why not implement this as a plugin/component? I did it like this for my build and with few patches it works like a charm.\nOn this matter, too: we should have just a set of common methods, like setData/render etc (this should be laid out somewhere) and anybody will be able to contribute his/her plugin for Morris. I would love to be able to use heatmaps, if needed, without need to switch to some other library.\n. So, there're several implementation PRs for Pie Charts in this repo, namely https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/pull/92, https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/pull/149, https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/pull/128.\nI did use #149, though it had some issues (I commented on PR) and the main flaw is - single label visible at the time, which kind of spoils whole point of pie chart, IMO.\nShould we kick off this discussion? Maybe, this should not be included as part of v0.5 release.\n. > ember charts - pie seems promising.\n\n@mkramchandra are you talking about [this one](http://addepar.github.io/#/ember-charts/pie)? \n. If I understand correctly, this question is outdated. See [main page](http://www.oesmith.co.uk/morris.js/) for example.\n. It's [in](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/blob/07c740414b2553596b5b7c23197a09af4acd933d/lib/morris.line.coffee#L381). It was implemented via https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/commit/b192a00d685ebe4275ba6c00c1c98aa13a0975e2\n. Guys, be sure to see #340. There might be no updates if you don't contribute back. :crying_cat_face: \n. The X label is kinda trivial, because you can append it and position at your chart element with regualr css. \nPure css Y-axis is a bit trickier. Need to test out [this approach](http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/text-rotation/) which should work in IE above version 7. Some additional logic should be applied for label truncating though.\nThe svg Y-label is rather straightforward and PR for that is https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/pull/299.\n. Looks neat and might be really useful. As well might lay ground for vertical bar charts.\n. Hey, @R-osey, is it still reproducible?\n. There're some projects that're working towards this goal.\nI tried [canvg](https://code.google.com/p/canvg/) on view of morris examples and it worked quite decent, so might want to use that if you need client side turning into canvas -> img and cannot use server side rendering.\n. There's also https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/pull/321, which shows how to add AMD support on top of browserify, also. @oesmith do you want wrapper to be added as part of build step, or for it to be present in actual source code?\n. Hey, @wojons, thanks for feedback. \nThe issue is, that svgs are generally slower than canvases. Take a look at [this SO answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/5883032/1976857). So we might in the future try to make Morris faster, but that's not an issue for most part at current moment.\n. I assume newer issue should be opened or #346 used. Nevertheless, PRs are welcome in case you still want to contribute :smile_cat: \n. You can use `setData()` method to change data for element & force redraw.\n. Okay, so main culprit here is probably, this line\nhttps://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/blob/master/lib/morris.grid.coffee#L182\nThe question arise: should callback arity be changed or should we modify options.data as well as data?\n. Duplicate of https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/221\n. Consider consulting related issue https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/349.\n. There's no such thing yet,\nThough, you can add\n`last = @options.startPoint || 0` instead of [this line](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/blob/master/lib/morris.donut.coffee#L72)\nAnd in your options for chart set\n`startPoint: - Math.PI` so that it will start at 12 am.\n. Try using `toUTCString()`\n\n```\n  new Date('2013-06-03T22:27:48Z').toUTCString()  // -> \"Mon, 03 Jun 2013 22:27:48 GMT\"\n```\n\nThe issue here new Date uses your time zone when formatting date, thus the issue. Other possible solution - manually constructing date string, usting getDay(), getFullYear(), getMonth(), getUTCHours(), getUTCMinutes().\n. Please provide plunker or data you set to achieve such result.\n. Hello Daniel, \nit seems to be an issue of rescaling your grid after data update. New scale forces bottom grid line to be not visible.\nAs a temporary solution, you can set padding for your chart.\nhttp://jsbin.com/uqawig/2145/\n. I assume @heruan vocalized this more clearly at https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/322 so will be closing this one for time being.\n. On the failing CI thing: it should install grunt-cli globally now, should I hook it into npm preinstall?\n. There's no bootstrap 3 specific examples in this repo, but there're some in the [wild](http://jsfiddle.net/b3rgstrom/cD6dd/12/).\n. You can do it [like this](http://jsbin.com/UJUkosa/30/edit?js,output).\n. Duplicate of #111.\n. For cdn.oesmith.co.uk to serve library when used with https:// a proper SSL certificate is needed, which needs some financing. Why don't use one from cdnjs?\nIt can be found here: [//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/morris.js/0.4.2/morris.min.js](http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/morris.js/0.4.2/morris.min.js)\n. For this purpose I'm using plain \n\n```\n$(window).on('resize', function() { redoTheChartFunction();});\n```\n\nWorks like a charm, since Morris is all about percentage and calculating sizes dynamically.\nAnd you might consider using something like (underscore's debounce)[http://underscorejs.org/#debounce] so that you aren't repainting in vain.\n. Duplicate of #111.\n. Sorry, but you edited the resulting js and not the source coffee code. Would also love to see plnkr/jsbin with functionality demo.\n. Will work on this as soon as I get some time on my hands. Thanks for feedback. Should I also add example page?\n. Update PR. Will be doing an example for this one as separate PR.\n. In fact. @oesmith, I would love to become a contributor, even if my only help will be with sorting/labeling issues, reviewing PRs, etc. I do understand your position on keeping Morris clean and simple so I wouldn't be pushy around new feature (like #149) though I'd really like to see that and I do value efforts you and others spent to make Morris what it is.\n. Updated PR. Please review.\n. Pull#300 :bowtie: (even if it's not accepted, it's still number Three-Ouh-Ouh)\n. There came to be couple of issues:\n1) fixed labels to be separated for series, never update PR\n2) Issue with two thin bars side by side - their labels would overlap (same is true for highcharts, btw).\n. I will probably update this, when I figure out how to write some tests. Any ideas on that how to approach that?\n. Same probably goes for label calback, it should be properly executed along the color change.\n. Assume duplicate of #111 \n. Please specify type of chart and the part of chart you're talkign about. Plnkr/jsbin would be perfect.\n. I consider this one good to have and not very hard to implement. :+1: \n. > I would be interested in having the possibility to specify the colors of some dots in my line chart.  \n\nWhy not use `lineColors` callback to have something along the lines of\n\n```\n...\nlineColors: function(row, sidx, type) {\n return row.src.color;\n}\n...\n```\n\nin your options after you've added colors to data rows?\nP.S. messing with resulting js instead of recompiling from source probably - rather bad idea, imho.\n. It's probably should be request for 'pointFillColors to be callback' feature, just like `lineColors` is right now.\n. Okay, so to ran that, you have phantomjs binary in your path. I managed to do that by running `npm install -g phantomjs`.\n. No, there's no such thing at the moment. You can suggest a PR to do that. I would assume that would be done over here: https://github.com/sudodoki/morris.js/blob/e8d84dca099f2428fcbebcb96f7de60135f717fa/lib/morris.bar.coffee#L113.\n. Nice one.\nTravis CI failing is odd, tests run smoothly on localhost. \nIt somehow managed to run task in wrong order, might do something with grunt & grunt-cli versioning, which isn't hard-set.\n\n```\nRunning \"concat:wrap\" (concat) task\nFile \"morris.js\" created.\nRunning \"coffee:lib\" (coffee) task\nFile morris-bare.js created.\n```\n\nI'd personally, for the naming, would prefer regular morris.js & morris-amd.js, probably.\n. Can you please provide options/data to reproduce?\n. @kzar, you did good :smile_cat: . I'm closing this issue for now, but if anyone has a steps to reproduce, we'll reopen it.\n. Can you check whether response is a valid JSON object and being treated as such? Try switching  `data: data` to `data: JSON.parse(data)` or accessing single field of data you're getting. \n. Would assume @crollioac answer to be sufficient.\n. Tested and `setData()` changes the label for Bar, Area, Donut, Line.\nPlease provide steps to reproduce. Otherwise I would assume the issue outdated and close after some time.\n. No it didn't/isn't. But it does need our support to continue working on project, since @oesmith recently called to arms. See [Readme.md#contributors-wanted](https://github.com/oesmith/morris.js#contributors-wanted) or #291 \n. There were some changes and now there're some people who will be helping out with this project. Stay tuned & remember to help if you can and want this project to thrive.\n. > Not sure how to edit a PR  \n\nJust add commits to the same branch, it will update PR. Or, in case you want to do single commit, you can use [rebase + squash](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html) though be sure to squash only your commits, so that you're not trying to rewrite history in original repo.\n. @t3chn0r , only issue is you're trying to update build file, instead of editing source coffee files. Sorry for not telling you earilier, did not see it the first time.\n. I did little search and it seems your changes should go around [grid.coffee#L223](https://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/blob/68aa4c36f2b25aa0329ca82f95acaf79be5188ca/lib/morris.grid.coffee#L223). In case you're not familiar with coffee script, there's awesome [Little book of coffee script](http://arcturo.github.io/library/coffeescript/). It's nothing hard and be sure to ping me in case you need any help with that.\n. Thanks for pointing that out @thadin. [Proof that it works.](http://jsfiddle.net/z8uH8/1/)\n. To be more sure that everything works fine, try creating few testcases in \n[https://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/tree/master/spec/lib/grid](grid test folder) and maybe adding an [example page](https://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/tree/master/examples) for clearer visual result. I'm not an authority here, but these steps will make it more probable and easier to integrate into library.\nNo need to check `x is true` for boolean variable, but that really depends on your code style.\n. Is it still reproducible or did you just used some workaround?\n. Hello. What kind of legend do you want to have? You can use regular css & html stuff to display legend.\n. Since you didn't specify, what exactly you need, I just put up a bacis sample.\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/e97YJ/1/\n. We might consider introducing some sort of callback with color & label being passed as arguments to make it easier to draw legend. @oesmith, what's your opinion on this?\n. Possible reasoning for callback:\n1. When using default colors and thus not having your own reference for the colors being used.\n2. Incapsulation (not relying on `options` property being available as a property of your chart instance - what if we change the implementation and make options part of a closure?).\n3. Unified API across chart types (right now colors are set through `barColors`. `colors` [Donut], `lineColors` ).\n. Can you please provide a plnkr/jsbin with example of both Area & Line behavior with designated dataset?\n. Thanks for the plunks and explanation.\n\n> continuousLine is supposed to be false by default \n\nHm, according to [source code](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/blob/07c740414b2553596b5b7c23197a09af4acd933d/lib/morris.line.coffee#L37), its default value is `true`\nResolution:\n- [ ] Fix the [doc](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/blob/gh-pages/lines.html#L323)\n- [x] Decide whether we want Area to be abrupt and play along with `continuousLine` option and implement fix.\n- [ ] Have area chart non-contiguous on null values\n. Okay, that's how far I got\nhttp://embed.plnkr.co/uVkyfNWA2kp2mB3lVfYZ/\nChanges to code to achieve above plnkr result are \nhttps://github.com/sudodoki/morris.js/commit/47ddf33fa6872b697ce30904ace60b8af445b9d4\n@oesmith I would appreciate your judgement on how to handle this area smooth best.\n. Can you pleas provide jsbin/plnkr or at least dataset you're using? That will safe some time to reproduce the issue.\n. There's also another solution: call `redraw()` on tab activation (`shown.bs.tab` event).

Please provide plnkr/jsbin with corresponding dataset.\n. We can also use prettify from [CDN](http://cdnjs.com/libraries/prettify/). If you want to, I can put in [css](//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prettify/r224/prettify.min.css) & [js](//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prettify/r224/prettify.min.js), just don't want to meddle with your commit.\nOn blanket matter: locally I'm too seeing [this message](https://travis-ci.org/morrisjs/morris.js/jobs/18089853#L1054-L1055) & when opening spec/specs.html no tests are ran, but instead I can see 'waiting for blanket...

Just what I mentioned in original message.\n\n> when opening spec/specs.html no tests are ran, but instead I can see 'waiting for blanket... ' in the [browser] console\n\nDo I need to run some other service on top of static server to make that happening?\n. So the question here is whether we want to have coverage printed in console or be still able to run tests by visiting specs/specs.html or there's a way to actually have both (or even more).\n. Added prettify from CDN too.\nHad to update grunt-mocha package to fix npm test command.\nNow the issue is that though every test passes when npm test is ran, spec/specs.html has 1 failing spec: `barSize option svg attributes should set width to @options.barSize if possible`.\nEverything else looks good to me :+1: \n. Visual sample can be seen at https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/415.\n. Thanks @thadin, considering this resolved.\n. Please provide plnkr/jsbin with code you're running and include sample AJAX reponse you're using.\n. Try experimenting with adding next callback to your options.\n\n```\n  xLabelFormat: function(data){\n      var monthNames = [ \"January\", \"February\", \"March\", \"April\", \"May\", \"June\",\n    \"July\", \"August\", \"September\", \"October\", \"November\", \"December\" ];\n    return monthNames[data.getMonth()]\n  },\n```\n. There's built in handler https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/blob/07c740414b2553596b5b7c23197a09af4acd933d/lib/morris.donut.coffee#L50 and there should be `redraw()` method available on your donut instance.\n. Appreciate the effort, though you did change built file, and not *.coffee sources. Do you think you can do that?  \n. Apart from #94, see this sample (code is quite messy, but it seems to work): http://jsbin.com/uqawig/3683/edit\n. LGTM :+1:. @oesmith wanna make it part of 0.5.0 release?\n. https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/morris.js/0.5.0/morris.min.js is up.\n. Did I get you right and you're talking, basically, about https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/347 ?\n. Answer was given in https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/416#issuecomment-44496896.\n. No, there's no such thing at the moment. Also, you can work around this if you would have those values divided by, say 100 & have proper text in tooltip. Although, it wouldn't have any visual feedback of axis being scaled differently.\n. Please provide jsbin/plnkr of this example to better understand this problem.\nInspect your modal: it might be the case chart is there, but with invalid height: it's connected with fact that non-visible elements have height of 0. \nHere's sample of [bootstrap tab workaround](http://jsfiddle.net/b3rgstrom/cD6dd/12/)\n. Considering it being solved. Somehow, somewhere, by someone.\n. There's a pending [PR](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/pull/299) for Y axis label. Chart title & X axis should be rather easy to display using regular css\nI would suggest something like\n<section>\n<header>Your chart name</header>\n\n<figure>\n  <div id='mychart'></div>\n  <figcaption>Bane for the X axis.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</section>\nAlso, Y axis label can be done using css as well, if you're eager to use css-transform.\n. Hope either @brunoneve answer helped you, or you can utilize [this](http://jsbin.com/uqawig/3681/edit).\n. Please provide a sample plunker/jsfiddle/jsbin example with code to reproduce issue.\n. Nicely done, guys! :+1: \n. Nice demo. You changed the resulting built instead of .coffee sources though, it will be the problem for further builds, so be sure to check out [developer guide](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js#development) and update the sources. Also, can you please provide this as a configurable option? Not sure every user would be happy with this animation. Also, there's no ability to change animation duration. Closing this one for now, be sure to open a new PR anytime.\n. The deal is, scaling is done via js calculations, not css. Window resize\ntriggers event, that causes redraw. You can trigger resize or call redraw\nmethod, to force that behavior, whenever your layout changes.\n\nSorry for tyops, I'm doing this via phone.\n16.05.2014 1:55 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \"gudh\" notifications@github.com \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043b:\n\n> First of all, thanks for building this beautiful charts.\n> \n> Charts do redraw themselves when window width changes.

There's currently no built-in solution in Morris, and by what [@oesmith  says](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/430#issuecomment-46036983) I'm not sure there will be. \nThese issues are for bug reports, pull requests & feature requests.\nI would consider going to [stackoverflow](stackoverflow.com) and stating your problem, as it seems to be independent of Morris. You have text file, you need to form JS Object (read: 'parsed JSON') and pass it into Morris chart constructor. Answer @msam1300 gave is a bit flawed, you can check the more proper way to do things in https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/427.\n. Closing as duplicate of #424.\n. (Just for future references: it much more handy to give such examples using [Plunker](plnkr.co/edit), [jsfiddle](jsfiddle.net), [jsbin](jsbin.com), [codepen](codepen.io))\n[Here's somehow modified example](http://plnkr.co/edit/C62xIOIfMZtlAp8nAZ1l?p=preview) you provided that kinda works.\nMain points: .on('click') returns not the chart that has `setData` method. Also, if I recall correctly, Morris 0.4.3 didn't have setData method, it was added later.\n\n@oesmith there came up to be a possible issue: if you init your donut with [no data](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/blob/master/lib/morris.donut.coffee#L45-L48), it would not set [`@raphael` for donut](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/blob/master/lib/morris.donut.coffee#L48) and, as result, will fail at [`#redraw`](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/blob/master/lib/morris.donut.coffee#L60) which is called whenever `#setData` is called. \nPossible solutions:\n1) Call redraw only if any data was there to start with\n2) Still create `@raphael` when there's no data\n3) wrap it in try .. catch\n. You can do that using css. That's pretty much what [morris.css](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/blob/master/morris.css) serves.\n. I would suggest using css pointer-events for this.\n\nSorry for tyops, I'm doing this via phone.\n14.06.2014 3:59 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \"osushil\" notifications@github.com \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043b:\n\n> Let's say, on clicking any label on Donut Chart, it will display data on\n> DataTable, But if there are many records, the \"Progress Bar\" is displayed\n> until they are displayed in the DataTable.\n> Till the time Progress Bar is showing up, \"Hovering or Clicking\" on the\n> Donut Chart should not happen.

You actually modified the output js file. Change should go into [Morris.Donut source](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/blob/master/lib/morris.donut.coffee#L72). \nFor anyone interested I created fiddle with proposed changes, you can play with it [over here](http://jsfiddle.net/8C3UJ/82/).\nIn my project, when I needed similar functionality, I implemented startAngle, to be able to set point from which donut would start drawing, don't know, whether it would make sense to make it 0-1 mapping to 0-2\u03c0.\nBTW, if you don't really care about inner labels being straight, you can use [css transform](http://jsfiddle.net/8C3UJ/83/).\n. I would object to that, given both coffeescript & Raphael has it as goal to support IE8 and I myself had this as a factor when sticking with Morris for my project.\n. Please, be sure to check out [development section](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js#development) of readme to come up with awesome pull requests :sun_with_face: \n. Please, provide plnkr/jsbin with code, that seems not to work\n. Please, use http://plnkr.co/edit/ and provide an example of yours, that wouldn't work in chrome, but would work in firefox.\n. Please, see https://coderwall.com/p/gvnhvwa for sample usage. Only issue is that hidden divs don't have width, so any time you open tab you should redraw chart in it. \n. Sorry, there was a typo, here's the correct link: https://coderwall.com/p/gvnhvw. There was a jsbin with another solution in related issue (search for bootstrap over issues in this repos), but it's 404d me just now.\n. Please, provide a (un)working example using some online sandbox, like [plnkr](http://plnkr.co/edit/) or jsbin/jsfiddle/codepen. Code speaks better than words :smile_cat: \n. Good call! Will be taking a look at this.\n. It's in this repo in gh-pages branch. Probably, [here](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/blob/gh-pages/bars.html#L86-L93).\n. Can you please link to jsbin with compiled version of updated library? Just wanted to take a quick peek.\n. The issue with build was due to bower failure. Fixed via https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/commit/72596faa6f5b59031084b90b0f69232f31a97d55\n. Great work on this one! Can you please rebase against current master? There's an issue with bower https://github.com/bower/bower/pull/1403 -> updated the version, let's see what Travis thinks about these.\n. Can you please provide a sandbox demo of this one? I would love to merge all of PRs as soon as I get some time on my hands. \n. There seem to be an issue with hover tests https://travis-ci.org/morrisjs/morris.js/jobs/29845066#L1210-L1299 :worried: \n. > What's the reasoning behind the current y positioning?\n> I think @oesmith could clarify this for us.\n> Demo looks good to me, maybe, should just account for new values in the test.\n. :clap: awesome\n. :+1: Did the same for my working project.\n. You can use use `barColors` callback to do return some special color for negative values and something else for other colors. See  https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/blob/master/lib/morris.bar.coffee#L190-L195 for implementation details.\n. yep\n. Can you please edit the source coffee file instead of resulting js one?\n. I can tell there's odd change in gruntfile. As to API I would suggest adding classFor callback\n. There's none, just a suggestion to what this feature might look like: `classFor` callback in  your options.\n. :+1:  Good job! Thank you for putting your time & efforts into this library.\n. Just deregister handler with $.fn.off for given selector, maybe?\n. Coming back to this PR have few questions:\n1) @oesmith , are you objecting including this Pie-Componennt into core library at all?\n2) @tiraeth, since Morris is rather straightforward, why not implement this as a plugin/component? I did it like this for my build and with few patches it works like a charm.\nOn this matter, too: we should have just a set of common methods, like setData/render etc (this should be laid out somewhere) and anybody will be able to contribute his/her plugin for Morris. I would love to be able to use heatmaps, if needed, without need to switch to some other library.\n. So, there're several implementation PRs for Pie Charts in this repo, namely https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/pull/92, https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/pull/149, https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/pull/128.\nI did use #149, though it had some issues (I commented on PR) and the main flaw is - single label visible at the time, which kind of spoils whole point of pie chart, IMO.\nShould we kick off this discussion? Maybe, this should not be included as part of v0.5 release.\n. > ember charts - pie seems promising.\n\n@mkramchandra are you talking about [this one](http://addepar.github.io/#/ember-charts/pie)? \n. If I understand correctly, this question is outdated. See [main page](http://www.oesmith.co.uk/morris.js/) for example.\n. It's [in](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/blob/07c740414b2553596b5b7c23197a09af4acd933d/lib/morris.line.coffee#L381). It was implemented via https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/commit/b192a00d685ebe4275ba6c00c1c98aa13a0975e2\n. Guys, be sure to see #340. There might be no updates if you don't contribute back. :crying_cat_face: \n. The X label is kinda trivial, because you can append it and position at your chart element with regualr css. \nPure css Y-axis is a bit trickier. Need to test out [this approach](http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/text-rotation/) which should work in IE above version 7. Some additional logic should be applied for label truncating though.\nThe svg Y-label is rather straightforward and PR for that is https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/pull/299.\n. Looks neat and might be really useful. As well might lay ground for vertical bar charts.\n. Hey, @R-osey, is it still reproducible?\n. There're some projects that're working towards this goal.\nI tried [canvg](https://code.google.com/p/canvg/) on view of morris examples and it worked quite decent, so might want to use that if you need client side turning into canvas -> img and cannot use server side rendering.\n. There's also https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/pull/321, which shows how to add AMD support on top of browserify, also. @oesmith do you want wrapper to be added as part of build step, or for it to be present in actual source code?\n. Hey, @wojons, thanks for feedback. \nThe issue is, that svgs are generally slower than canvases. Take a look at [this SO answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/5883032/1976857). So we might in the future try to make Morris faster, but that's not an issue for most part at current moment.\n. I assume newer issue should be opened or #346 used. Nevertheless, PRs are welcome in case you still want to contribute :smile_cat: \n. You can use `setData()` method to change data for element & force redraw.\n. Okay, so main culprit here is probably, this line\nhttps://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/blob/master/lib/morris.grid.coffee#L182\nThe question arise: should callback arity be changed or should we modify options.data as well as data?\n. Duplicate of https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/221\n. Consider consulting related issue https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/349.\n. There's no such thing yet,\nThough, you can add\n`last = @options.startPoint || 0` instead of [this line](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/blob/master/lib/morris.donut.coffee#L72)\nAnd in your options for chart set\n`startPoint: - Math.PI` so that it will start at 12 am.\n. Try using `toUTCString()`\n\n```\n  new Date('2013-06-03T22:27:48Z').toUTCString()  // -> \"Mon, 03 Jun 2013 22:27:48 GMT\"\n```\n\nThe issue here new Date uses your time zone when formatting date, thus the issue. Other possible solution - manually constructing date string, usting getDay(), getFullYear(), getMonth(), getUTCHours(), getUTCMinutes().\n. Please provide plunker or data you set to achieve such result.\n. Hello Daniel, \nit seems to be an issue of rescaling your grid after data update. New scale forces bottom grid line to be not visible.\nAs a temporary solution, you can set padding for your chart.\nhttp://jsbin.com/uqawig/2145/\n. I assume @heruan vocalized this more clearly at https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/322 so will be closing this one for time being.\n. On the failing CI thing: it should install grunt-cli globally now, should I hook it into npm preinstall?\n. There's no bootstrap 3 specific examples in this repo, but there're some in the [wild](http://jsfiddle.net/b3rgstrom/cD6dd/12/).\n. You can do it [like this](http://jsbin.com/UJUkosa/30/edit?js,output).\n. Duplicate of #111.\n. For cdn.oesmith.co.uk to serve library when used with https:// a proper SSL certificate is needed, which needs some financing. Why don't use one from cdnjs?\nIt can be found here: [//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/morris.js/0.4.2/morris.min.js](http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/morris.js/0.4.2/morris.min.js)\n. For this purpose I'm using plain \n\n```\n$(window).on('resize', function() { redoTheChartFunction();});\n```\n\nWorks like a charm, since Morris is all about percentage and calculating sizes dynamically.\nAnd you might consider using something like (underscore's debounce)[http://underscorejs.org/#debounce] so that you aren't repainting in vain.\n. Duplicate of #111.\n. Sorry, but you edited the resulting js and not the source coffee code. Would also love to see plnkr/jsbin with functionality demo.\n. Will work on this as soon as I get some time on my hands. Thanks for feedback. Should I also add example page?\n. Update PR. Will be doing an example for this one as separate PR.\n. In fact. @oesmith, I would love to become a contributor, even if my only help will be with sorting/labeling issues, reviewing PRs, etc. I do understand your position on keeping Morris clean and simple so I wouldn't be pushy around new feature (like #149) though I'd really like to see that and I do value efforts you and others spent to make Morris what it is.\n. Updated PR. Please review.\n. Pull#300 :bowtie: (even if it's not accepted, it's still number Three-Ouh-Ouh)\n. There came to be couple of issues:\n1) fixed labels to be separated for series, never update PR\n2) Issue with two thin bars side by side - their labels would overlap (same is true for highcharts, btw).\n. I will probably update this, when I figure out how to write some tests. Any ideas on that how to approach that?\n. Same probably goes for label calback, it should be properly executed along the color change.\n. Assume duplicate of #111 \n. Please specify type of chart and the part of chart you're talkign about. Plnkr/jsbin would be perfect.\n. I consider this one good to have and not very hard to implement. :+1: \n. > I would be interested in having the possibility to specify the colors of some dots in my line chart.  \n\nWhy not use `lineColors` callback to have something along the lines of\n\n```\n...\nlineColors: function(row, sidx, type) {\n return row.src.color;\n}\n...\n```\n\nin your options after you've added colors to data rows?\nP.S. messing with resulting js instead of recompiling from source probably - rather bad idea, imho.\n. It's probably should be request for 'pointFillColors to be callback' feature, just like `lineColors` is right now.\n. Okay, so to ran that, you have phantomjs binary in your path. I managed to do that by running `npm install -g phantomjs`.\n. No, there's no such thing at the moment. You can suggest a PR to do that. I would assume that would be done over here: https://github.com/sudodoki/morris.js/blob/e8d84dca099f2428fcbebcb96f7de60135f717fa/lib/morris.bar.coffee#L113.\n. Nice one.\nTravis CI failing is odd, tests run smoothly on localhost. \nIt somehow managed to run task in wrong order, might do something with grunt & grunt-cli versioning, which isn't hard-set.\n\n```\nRunning \"concat:wrap\" (concat) task\nFile \"morris.js\" created.\nRunning \"coffee:lib\" (coffee) task\nFile morris-bare.js created.\n```\n\nI'd personally, for the naming, would prefer regular morris.js & morris-amd.js, probably.\n. Can you please provide options/data to reproduce?\n. @kzar, you did good :smile_cat: . I'm closing this issue for now, but if anyone has a steps to reproduce, we'll reopen it.\n. Can you check whether response is a valid JSON object and being treated as such? Try switching  `data: data` to `data: JSON.parse(data)` or accessing single field of data you're getting. \n. Would assume @crollioac answer to be sufficient.\n. Tested and `setData()` changes the label for Bar, Area, Donut, Line.\nPlease provide steps to reproduce. Otherwise I would assume the issue outdated and close after some time.\n. No it didn't/isn't. But it does need our support to continue working on project, since @oesmith recently called to arms. See [Readme.md#contributors-wanted](https://github.com/oesmith/morris.js#contributors-wanted) or #291 \n. There were some changes and now there're some people who will be helping out with this project. Stay tuned & remember to help if you can and want this project to thrive.\n. > Not sure how to edit a PR  \n\nJust add commits to the same branch, it will update PR. Or, in case you want to do single commit, you can use [rebase + squash](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html) though be sure to squash only your commits, so that you're not trying to rewrite history in original repo.\n. @t3chn0r , only issue is you're trying to update build file, instead of editing source coffee files. Sorry for not telling you earilier, did not see it the first time.\n. I did little search and it seems your changes should go around [grid.coffee#L223](https://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/blob/68aa4c36f2b25aa0329ca82f95acaf79be5188ca/lib/morris.grid.coffee#L223). In case you're not familiar with coffee script, there's awesome [Little book of coffee script](http://arcturo.github.io/library/coffeescript/). It's nothing hard and be sure to ping me in case you need any help with that.\n. Thanks for pointing that out @thadin. [Proof that it works.](http://jsfiddle.net/z8uH8/1/)\n. To be more sure that everything works fine, try creating few testcases in \n[https://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/tree/master/spec/lib/grid](grid test folder) and maybe adding an [example page](https://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/tree/master/examples) for clearer visual result. I'm not an authority here, but these steps will make it more probable and easier to integrate into library.\nNo need to check `x is true` for boolean variable, but that really depends on your code style.\n. Is it still reproducible or did you just used some workaround?\n. Hello. What kind of legend do you want to have? You can use regular css & html stuff to display legend.\n. Since you didn't specify, what exactly you need, I just put up a bacis sample.\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/e97YJ/1/\n. We might consider introducing some sort of callback with color & label being passed as arguments to make it easier to draw legend. @oesmith, what's your opinion on this?\n. Possible reasoning for callback:\n1. When using default colors and thus not having your own reference for the colors being used.\n2. Incapsulation (not relying on `options` property being available as a property of your chart instance - what if we change the implementation and make options part of a closure?).\n3. Unified API across chart types (right now colors are set through `barColors`. `colors` [Donut], `lineColors` ).\n. Can you please provide a plnkr/jsbin with example of both Area & Line behavior with designated dataset?\n. Thanks for the plunks and explanation.\n\n> continuousLine is supposed to be false by default \n\nHm, according to [source code](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/blob/07c740414b2553596b5b7c23197a09af4acd933d/lib/morris.line.coffee#L37), its default value is `true`\nResolution:\n- [ ] Fix the [doc](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/blob/gh-pages/lines.html#L323)\n- [x] Decide whether we want Area to be abrupt and play along with `continuousLine` option and implement fix.\n- [ ] Have area chart non-contiguous on null values\n. Okay, that's how far I got\nhttp://embed.plnkr.co/uVkyfNWA2kp2mB3lVfYZ/\nChanges to code to achieve above plnkr result are \nhttps://github.com/sudodoki/morris.js/commit/47ddf33fa6872b697ce30904ace60b8af445b9d4\n@oesmith I would appreciate your judgement on how to handle this area smooth best.\n. Can you pleas provide jsbin/plnkr or at least dataset you're using? That will safe some time to reproduce the issue.\n. There's also another solution: call `redraw()` on tab activation (`shown.bs.tab` event).

Please provide plnkr/jsbin with corresponding dataset.\n. We can also use prettify from [CDN](http://cdnjs.com/libraries/prettify/). If you want to, I can put in [css](//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prettify/r224/prettify.min.css) & [js](//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prettify/r224/prettify.min.js), just don't want to meddle with your commit.\nOn blanket matter: locally I'm too seeing [this message](https://travis-ci.org/morrisjs/morris.js/jobs/18089853#L1054-L1055) & when opening spec/specs.html no tests are ran, but instead I can see 'waiting for blanket...

Just what I mentioned in original message.\n\n> when opening spec/specs.html no tests are ran, but instead I can see 'waiting for blanket... ' in the [browser] console\n\nDo I need to run some other service on top of static server to make that happening?\n. So the question here is whether we want to have coverage printed in console or be still able to run tests by visiting specs/specs.html or there's a way to actually have both (or even more).\n. Added prettify from CDN too.\nHad to update grunt-mocha package to fix npm test command.\nNow the issue is that though every test passes when npm test is ran, spec/specs.html has 1 failing spec: `barSize option svg attributes should set width to @options.barSize if possible`.\nEverything else looks good to me :+1: \n. Visual sample can be seen at https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/415.\n. Thanks @thadin, considering this resolved.\n. Please provide plnkr/jsbin with code you're running and include sample AJAX reponse you're using.\n. Try experimenting with adding next callback to your options.\n\n```\n  xLabelFormat: function(data){\n      var monthNames = [ \"January\", \"February\", \"March\", \"April\", \"May\", \"June\",\n    \"July\", \"August\", \"September\", \"October\", \"November\", \"December\" ];\n    return monthNames[data.getMonth()]\n  },\n```\n. There's built in handler https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/blob/07c740414b2553596b5b7c23197a09af4acd933d/lib/morris.donut.coffee#L50 and there should be `redraw()` method available on your donut instance.\n. Appreciate the effort, though you did change built file, and not *.coffee sources. Do you think you can do that?  \n. Apart from #94, see this sample (code is quite messy, but it seems to work): http://jsbin.com/uqawig/3683/edit\n. LGTM :+1:. @oesmith wanna make it part of 0.5.0 release?\n. https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/morris.js/0.5.0/morris.min.js is up.\n. Did I get you right and you're talking, basically, about https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/347 ?\n. Answer was given in https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/416#issuecomment-44496896.\n. No, there's no such thing at the moment. Also, you can work around this if you would have those values divided by, say 100 & have proper text in tooltip. Although, it wouldn't have any visual feedback of axis being scaled differently.\n. Please provide jsbin/plnkr of this example to better understand this problem.\nInspect your modal: it might be the case chart is there, but with invalid height: it's connected with fact that non-visible elements have height of 0. \nHere's sample of [bootstrap tab workaround](http://jsfiddle.net/b3rgstrom/cD6dd/12/)\n. Considering it being solved. Somehow, somewhere, by someone.\n. There's a pending [PR](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/pull/299) for Y axis label. Chart title & X axis should be rather easy to display using regular css\nI would suggest something like\n<section>\n<header>Your chart name</header>\n\n<figure>\n  <div id='mychart'></div>\n  <figcaption>Bane for the X axis.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</section>\nAlso, Y axis label can be done using css as well, if you're eager to use css-transform.\n. Hope either @brunoneve answer helped you, or you can utilize [this](http://jsbin.com/uqawig/3681/edit).\n. Please provide a sample plunker/jsfiddle/jsbin example with code to reproduce issue.\n. Nicely done, guys! :+1: \n. Nice demo. You changed the resulting built instead of .coffee sources though, it will be the problem for further builds, so be sure to check out [developer guide](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js#development) and update the sources. Also, can you please provide this as a configurable option? Not sure every user would be happy with this animation. Also, there's no ability to change animation duration. Closing this one for now, be sure to open a new PR anytime.\n. The deal is, scaling is done via js calculations, not css. Window resize\ntriggers event, that causes redraw. You can trigger resize or call redraw\nmethod, to force that behavior, whenever your layout changes.\n\nSorry for tyops, I'm doing this via phone.\n16.05.2014 1:55 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \"gudh\" notifications@github.com \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043b:\n\n> First of all, thanks for building this beautiful charts.\n> \n> Charts do redraw themselves when window width changes.

Please provide a example in any js sandbox, for instance, http://plnkr.co/edit/.\nFrom the way you're describing this, it might be the case of events not being handled correctly (either not propagating or not passing to div needed because of the overlay) - needs a (not)working example.\n. There's currently no built-in solution in Morris, and by what [@oesmith  says](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/430#issuecomment-46036983) I'm not sure there will be. \nThese issues are for bug reports, pull requests & feature requests.\nI would consider going to [stackoverflow](stackoverflow.com) and stating your problem, as it seems to be independent of Morris. You have text file, you need to form JS Object (read: 'parsed JSON') and pass it into Morris chart constructor. Answer @msam1300 gave is a bit flawed, you can check the more proper way to do things in https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/427.\n. Closing as duplicate of #424.\n. (Just for future references: it much more handy to give such examples using [Plunker](plnkr.co/edit), [jsfiddle](jsfiddle.net), [jsbin](jsbin.com), [codepen](codepen.io))\n[Here's somehow modified example](http://plnkr.co/edit/C62xIOIfMZtlAp8nAZ1l?p=preview) you provided that kinda works.\nMain points: .on('click') returns not the chart that has `setData` method. Also, if I recall correctly, Morris 0.4.3 didn't have setData method, it was added later.\n\n@oesmith there came up to be a possible issue: if you init your donut with [no data](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/blob/master/lib/morris.donut.coffee#L45-L48), it would not set [`@raphael` for donut](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/blob/master/lib/morris.donut.coffee#L48) and, as result, will fail at [`#redraw`](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/blob/master/lib/morris.donut.coffee#L60) which is called whenever `#setData` is called. \nPossible solutions:\n1) Call redraw only if any data was there to start with\n2) Still create `@raphael` when there's no data\n3) wrap it in try .. catch\n. You can do that using css. That's pretty much what [morris.css](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/blob/master/morris.css) serves.\n. I would suggest using css pointer-events for this.\n\nSorry for tyops, I'm doing this via phone.\n14.06.2014 3:59 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \"osushil\" notifications@github.com \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043b:\n\n> Let's say, on clicking any label on Donut Chart, it will display data on\n> DataTable, But if there are many records, the \"Progress Bar\" is displayed\n> until they are displayed in the DataTable.\n> Till the time Progress Bar is showing up, \"Hovering or Clicking\" on the\n> Donut Chart should not happen.

You actually modified the output js file.

I would object to that, given both coffeescript & Raphael has it as goal to support IE8 and I myself had this as a factor when sticking with Morris for my project.\n. Please, be sure to check out [development section](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js#development) of readme to come up with awesome pull requests :sun_with_face: \n.

Please, see https://coderwall.com/p/gvnhvwa for sample usage. Only issue is that hidden divs don't have width, so any time you open tab you should redraw chart in it. \n.

There was a jsbin with another solution in related issue (search for bootstrap over issues in this repos), but it's 404d me just now.\n.

Will be taking a look at this.\n. It's in this repo in gh-pages branch. Probably, [here](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/blob/gh-pages/bars.html#L86-L93).\n. Can you please link to jsbin with compiled version of updated library? Just wanted to take a quick peek.\n. The issue with build was due to bower failure. Fixed via https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/commit/72596faa6f5b59031084b90b0f69232f31a97d55\n. Great work on this one! Can you please rebase against current master? There's an issue with bower https://github.com/bower/bower/pull/1403 -> updated the version, let's see what Travis thinks about these.\n. Can you please provide a sandbox demo of this one? I would love to merge all of PRs as soon as I get some time on my hands. \n. There seem to be an issue with hover tests https://travis-ci.org/morrisjs/morris.js/jobs/29845066#L1210-L1299 :worried: \n. > What's the reasoning behind the current y positioning?\n> I think @oesmith could clarify this for us.\n> Demo looks good to me, maybe, should just account for new values in the test.\n. :clap: awesome\n. :+1: Did the same for my working project.\n. You can use use `barColors` callback to do return some special color for negative values and something else for other colors. See  https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/blob/master/lib/morris.bar.coffee#L190-L195 for implementation details.\n. yep\n. Can you please edit the source coffee file instead of resulting js one?\n. I can tell there's odd change in gruntfile. As to API I would suggest adding classFor callback\n. There's none, just a suggestion to what this feature might look like: `classFor` callback in  your options.\n. :+1:  Good job! Thank you for putting your time & efforts into this library.\n. ",

    "t3chn0r": "Not sure if there's been any work on this but I was looking for an option to only have int numbers on the Y-Axis and couldn't find anything. I'm trying to graph the number of visits a profile had during the last 30 days and numbers on the Y-Axis are coming like [0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, 1] when the maximum number of visits for a profile is one.\n\nIt's weird seeing these numbers as there will never be a 0.8 visit to a profile... \n. Hi @oesmith, just an update on my previous comment. I was able to \"patch\" Morris to prevent those fraction numbers in the grid. I did the following, I don't know Coffee script so if you are OK with the changes maybe you or someone else can add the changes to the script:\n\nFirst of all I created a new parameter named \"onlyIntegers\" defaulting to \"false\" to maintain compatibility, so the list of variables now look something like this:\n\n```\n...\nnumLines: 5,\nonlyIntegers: false,\npadding: 25,\n...\n```\n\nThen around line 257 after the ymax value is calculated I added the following lines:\n\n```\n...\nif ( this.options.onlyIntegers ) {\n    this.options.numLines = Math.min( this.ymax + 1, this.options.numLines );\n}\n\nif (this.options.axes === true || this.options.grid === true) {\n...\n```\n\nThat small piece of code adjust the number of lines in the grid according to the max value of Y. I have tested these changes with all my graphs and everything is working perfectly now.\nNot sure if that change might break something else or not (in the case ymax is not set to auto maybe), I guess you will have a better idea.\n\nRegards,\nt3chn0r\n. Something like this perhaps?\n\n``` javascript\nyLabelFormat: function (y) {\n    var parts = y.toString().split(\".\");\n    parts[0] = parts[0].replace(/\\B(?=(\\d{3})+(?!\\d))/g, \".\");\n    return parts.join(\",\");\n}\n```\n. I left displaying of a normal date as adding 2013 W5 would apply only to English... I'll see if I can change it to that...\n\nNot sure what you mean with specs...\n. Any idea where I have to go to edit the PR? I'm new to Github...\n. I really have no idea what I need to do... I'm trying to find an option to edit these changes without creating a new PR but I can't find any option. I guess I will close this one and create a new one.\n. By the way, this is the code I'm using now to display \"2013 W5\", although I don't know Coffee script so I have no idea how to translate it to create a new PR:\n\n```\n        \"week\": {\n            span: 604800000,\n            start: function(d) {\n                return new Date(d.getFullYear(), d.getMonth(), d.getDate());\n            },\n            fmt: function(d) {\n                var thisWeek = new Date( d.getFullYear(), d.getMonth(), d.getDate() );\n                var thisWeekStarts = thisWeek.getTime() + ( 1 - thisWeek.getDay() ) * 86400000;\n                var firstWeek = new Date( d.getFullYear(), 0, 1 );\n                var firstWeekStarts = firstWeek.getTime() + ( 1 - firstWeek.getDay() ) * 86400000;\n                var weekNumber = Math.ceil( ( ( ( thisWeekStarts - firstWeekStarts ) / 86400000 ) ) / 7 );\n\n                return \"\" + ( d.getFullYear() ) + \" W\" + weekNumber;\n            },\n            incr: function(d) {\n                return d.setDate(d.getDate() + 7);\n            }\n        },\n```\n. After doing some more extensive tests I did the following:\nI added getWeek() to Date.prototype:\n\n```\nDate.prototype.getWeek = function() {\n    var thisWeek = new Date( this.getFullYear(), this.getMonth(), this.getDate(), 0, 0, 0 );\n    var thisWeekStarts = thisWeek.getTime() + ( thisWeek.getDay() == 0 ? -6 : 1 - thisWeek.getDay() ) * 86400000;\n    var firstWeek = new Date( this.getFullYear(), 0, 1, 0, 0, 0 );\n    var firstWeekStarts = firstWeek.getTime() + ( firstWeek.getDay() == 0 ? -6 : 1 - firstWeek.getDay() ) * 86400000;\n    var weekNumber = Math.ceil( ( ( ( thisWeekStarts - firstWeekStarts ) / 86400000 ) ) / 7 );\n\n    return ( weekNumber ) ? weekNumber : 52;\n}\n```\n\nThe format function for week in Morris should look like this:\n\n```\nfmt: function(d) {\n                var week = d.getWeek();\n                var year = ( week == 52 && d.getMonth() == 0 ) ? d.getFullYear() - 1 : d.getFullYear();\n                return \"\" + year + \" W\" + week;\n            },\n```\n\nLike I said before I don't know Coffee script so I can't create a PR to implement this... Sorry about that.\n. Yeah, that's why I don't think this PR makes any sense... It's something that I needed for my project and I just wanted to share it but probably there's a better and clearner way to implement it in Morris.\n. Check the examples, there's one named \"events.html\" that shows what you are looking for if I understood correctly.\n. :+1: \n. Hello @oesmith, any update on this one? Regards\n. Hello @sudodoki, I will take a shot at implementing this then and see how it goes... I will take a look at it tomorrow and ask people to test it.\n. Please have a look at PR [#341](https://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/pull/341)... Will appreciate people willing to test the PR and send feedback.\n. Was having the same issue, thanks for the workaround, at least it's working now until a more definitive solution is implemented. :+1: \n. Not sure how to edit a PR... Need to add a small change:\nLine:\n\n``` javascript\nstep = Math.round(step);\n```\n\nShould be:\n\n``` javascript\nstep = Math.max(1, Math.round(step));\n```\n. Done... I think this PR is ready for some testing...\n\nThanks @sudodoki, I was able to add a new edit to the PR... \n. Thanks @sudodoki, didn't realize that... I have no experience whatsoever with Coffee script but I have implemented the changes, hopefully they are good... This is the [new PR](https://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/pull/344). \n\nClosing this one.\n. Not sure if there's been any work on this but I was looking for an option to only have int numbers on the Y-Axis and couldn't find anything. I'm trying to graph the number of visits a profile had during the last 30 days and numbers on the Y-Axis are coming like [0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, 1] when the maximum number of visits for a profile is one.\n\nIt's weird seeing these numbers as there will never be a 0.8 visit to a profile... \n. Hi @oesmith, just an update on my previous comment. I was able to \"patch\" Morris to prevent those fraction numbers in the grid. I did the following, I don't know Coffee script so if you are OK with the changes maybe you or someone else can add the changes to the script:\n\nFirst of all I created a new parameter named \"onlyIntegers\" defaulting to \"false\" to maintain compatibility, so the list of variables now look something like this:\n\n```\n...\nnumLines: 5,\nonlyIntegers: false,\npadding: 25,\n...\n```\n\nThen around line 257 after the ymax value is calculated I added the following lines:\n\n```\n...\nif ( this.options.onlyIntegers ) {\n    this.options.numLines = Math.min( this.ymax + 1, this.options.numLines );\n}\n\nif (this.options.axes === true || this.options.grid === true) {\n...\n```\n\nThat small piece of code adjust the number of lines in the grid according to the max value of Y. I have tested these changes with all my graphs and everything is working perfectly now.\nNot sure if that change might break something else or not (in the case ymax is not set to auto maybe), I guess you will have a better idea.\n\nRegards,\nt3chn0r\n. Something like this perhaps?\n\n``` javascript\nyLabelFormat: function (y) {\n    var parts = y.toString().split(\".\");\n    parts[0] = parts[0].replace(/\\B(?=(\\d{3})+(?!\\d))/g, \".\");\n    return parts.join(\",\");\n}\n```\n. I left displaying of a normal date as adding 2013 W5 would apply only to English... I'll see if I can change it to that...\n\nNot sure what you mean with specs...\n.

I thought you'd ask that!\n\nI just tried to and WAS able to get chrome to hang.\nhttp://jsbin.com/ugavuz/3/\n\nI haven't used jsbin before- but it seems that if you edit anything it re-renders the iframe.\nI was able to get chrome to hang very easily by modifying the \"width\" of the \"chart\" div in the html pane.\n. Try this link - you need to be in edit mode;\nhttp://jsbin.com/ugavuz/4/edit\n\nWatch the console while it renders the iframe.  It should print \"finished\" after drawing the chart.\nEventually for me, it hangs and never reaches that point.  Then I have to kill the whole tab in chrome.\n. Hm - like I said in earlier comment - sometimes during the \"freeze\" the console was actually spewing errors from within the Raphael js code - stuck in an infinite loop of some kind...  \n\nI think the line in the morris code was this:\n\n```\nline 384 i believe\n          _results.push(this.drawGridLine(\"M\" + this.left + \",\" + y + \"H\" + (this.left + this.width)));\n```\n\nI think thats where the H1810 came from in the \"Error parsing\" exception / stacktrace.\n\nIf this were a Chrome rendering issue, I don't think I would have gotten the \"looping\" symptom.\nAlso in my experience Chrome usually DOES kill the tab with \"Aw, Snap\".\n. Doing some debugging:\nhttp://jsbin.com/ugavuz/18/edit\n\nGot it to hang after \"debug 11\" - seems to be triggered by reducing the width of the chart div (eg: 33px).\nSo the freeze is occuring in:\n\n```\nthis.drawXAxis();  (Line.prototype)\n```\n. Found the stuck loop!\ntry this: http://jsbin.com/ugavuz/24/edit\nReduce the width to 33px (instead of 331px).\nMy console is spewing:  debug dx-loop:  \nIn normal / successful completion, this loop should only be 17 iterations.\n. Looks like labelSeries is returning 1.5 million labels instead of 17.  Must be triggered by a width too small.\n---debug dx6b: 1533601 \n. So in labelSeries:\n\n```\nconsole.log(\"==ls: \"+dmin+\" \"+dmax+\" \"+pxwidth);\noutput:\n==ls: 1366434000000 1367967600000 -1 \n```\n\nLooks like it is getting a negative value for pxwidth - probably due to the narrow width (33px) and my declared padding of 10px.\n\nThis results in the endless loop in labelSeries.\nNow I'm not _sure_ this is the cause of the issue in my app, since I am NOT using a narrow width - my width is more like 1800px.  So I will play around with some debugging there and report back.\n. Also here is the latest jsbin showing the 1.5 million labels returned:\nhttp://jsbin.com/ugavuz/25/edit\n\nThis one actually wont hang the browser because I added a safety break out in the next loop.\n. The hang in my app is occurring in labelSeries but NOT due to negative pxwidth!\nAnalyzing now...\n. Thanks - so here is output from my app in the labelSeries loop, building the ret array.\nFirst value is \"t\" and second value is size of ret[].\nThe length SHOULD be 61 on successful loop.\nNotice that on iteration #59, t has NOT increased!  So I guess some issue in the \"incrementer\" ?\n\n```\n===ls loop: 1362870000000 51 \n===ls loop: 1362873600000 52\n===ls loop: 1362877200000 53 \n===ls loop: 1362880800000 54 \n===ls loop: 1362884400000 55 \n===ls loop: 1362888000000 56 \n===ls loop: 1362891600000 57 \n===ls loop: 1362895200000 58 \n===ls loop: 1362895200000 59 \n===ls loop: 1362895200000 60 \n===ls loop: 1362895200000 61 \n===ls loop: 1362895200000 62 \n===ls loop: 1362895200000 63 \n```\n.

I thought you'd ask that!\n\nI just tried to and WAS able to get chrome to hang.\nhttp://jsbin.com/ugavuz/3/\n\nI haven't used jsbin before- but it seems that if you edit anything it re-renders the iframe.\nI was able to get chrome to hang very easily by modifying the \"width\" of the \"chart\" div in the html pane.\n. Try this link - you need to be in edit mode;\nhttp://jsbin.com/ugavuz/4/edit\n\nWatch the console while it renders the iframe.  It should print \"finished\" after drawing the chart.\nEventually for me, it hangs and never reaches that point.  Then I have to kill the whole tab in chrome.\n. Hm - like I said in earlier comment - sometimes during the \"freeze\" the console was actually spewing errors from within the Raphael js code - stuck in an infinite loop of some kind...  \n\nI think the line in the morris code was this:\n\n```\nline 384 i believe\n          _results.push(this.drawGridLine(\"M\" + this.left + \",\" + y + \"H\" + (this.left + this.width)));\n```\n\nI think thats where the H1810 came from in the \"Error parsing\" exception / stacktrace.\n\nIf this were a Chrome rendering issue, I don't think I would have gotten the \"looping\" symptom.\nAlso in my experience Chrome usually DOES kill the tab with \"Aw, Snap\".\n. Doing some debugging:\nhttp://jsbin.com/ugavuz/18/edit\n\nGot it to hang after \"debug 11\" - seems to be triggered by reducing the width of the chart div (eg: 33px).\nSo the freeze is occuring in:\n\n```\nthis.drawXAxis();  (Line.prototype)\n```\n. Found the stuck loop!\ntry this: http://jsbin.com/ugavuz/24/edit\nReduce the width to 33px (instead of 331px).\nMy console is spewing:  debug dx-loop:  \nIn normal / successful completion, this loop should only be 17 iterations.\n. Looks like labelSeries is returning 1.5 million labels instead of 17.  Must be triggered by a width too small.\n---debug dx6b: 1533601 \n. So in labelSeries:\n\n```\nconsole.log(\"==ls: \"+dmin+\" \"+dmax+\" \"+pxwidth);\noutput:\n==ls: 1366434000000 1367967600000 -1 \n```\n\nLooks like it is getting a negative value for pxwidth - probably due to the narrow width (33px) and my declared padding of 10px.\n\nThis results in the endless loop in labelSeries.\nNow I'm not _sure_ this is the cause of the issue in my app, since I am NOT using a narrow width - my width is more like 1800px.  So I will play around with some debugging there and report back.\n. Also here is the latest jsbin showing the 1.5 million labels returned:\nhttp://jsbin.com/ugavuz/25/edit\n\nThis one actually wont hang the browser because I added a safety break out in the next loop.\n. The hang in my app is occurring in labelSeries but NOT due to negative pxwidth!\nAnalyzing now...\n. Thanks - so here is output from my app in the labelSeries loop, building the ret array.\nFirst value is \"t\" and second value is size of ret[].\nThe length SHOULD be 61 on successful loop.\nNotice that on iteration #59, t has NOT increased!  So I guess some issue in the \"incrementer\" ?\n\n```\n===ls loop: 1362870000000 51 \n===ls loop: 1362873600000 52\n===ls loop: 1362877200000 53 \n===ls loop: 1362880800000 54 \n===ls loop: 1362884400000 55 \n===ls loop: 1362888000000 56 \n===ls loop: 1362891600000 57 \n===ls loop: 1362895200000 58 \n===ls loop: 1362895200000 59 \n===ls loop: 1362895200000 60 \n===ls loop: 1362895200000 61 \n===ls loop: 1362895200000 62 \n===ls loop: 1362895200000 63 \n```\n. OK guess what...\nthe incrementer breaks down when crossing day light savings time!\nd.setMinutes(d.getMinutes()+60)  - winds up with SAME value\n\n```\nmsh.incr: Sun Mar 10 2013 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time) min:0 interval:60 morris-0.4.1.js:1006\n===ls loop: 1362895200000 55 morris-0.4.1.js:985\nmsh.incr: Sun Mar 10 2013 01:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time) min:0 interval:60 morris-0.4.1.js:1006\n===ls loop: 1362895200000 56 morris-0.4.1.js:985\nmsh.incr: Sun Mar 10 2013 01:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time) min:0 interval:60 morris-0.4.1.js:1006\n===ls loop: 1362895200000 57 morris-0.4.1.js:985\nmsh.incr: Sun Mar 10 2013 01:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time) min:0 interval:60 morris-0.4.1.js:1006\n===ls loop: 1362895200000 58 morris-0.4.1.js:985\nmsh.incr: Sun Mar 10 2013 01:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time) min:0 interval:60 morris-0.4.1.js:1006\n===ls loop: 1362895200000 59 morris-0.4.1.js:985\nmsh.incr: Sun Mar 10 2013 01:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time) min:0 interval:60 morris-0.4.1.js:1006\n===ls loop: 1362895200000 60 \n\n```\n. Should probably change to getTime() / setTime() using actual milliseconds for interval.\n. So to summarize - \n1) endless loop due to \"negative\" pxwidth\n2) endless loop due to incrementer failing to cross into DST\n\n(Both issues occur in labelSeries fn)\n.

I get this chart whit this quarter code:\n\n``` javascript\n      \"quarter\": {\n      span: 7257600000,\n      start: function(d) {\n        return new Date(d.getFullYear(), d.getMonth(), 1);\n      },\n      fmt: function(d) {\n        return \"\" + (d.getFullYear()) + \"-\" + (Morris.pad2(d.getMonth() + 1));\n      },\n      incr: function(d) {\n        return d.setMonth(d.getMonth() + 3);\n      }\n    },\n```\n\n![chart3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1481680/4809746/3fdacd52-5eae-11e4-9020-f06f915d0ed5.png)\n\n...but I don't really know what the span does (I multiplied the month value \\* 3) and also don't know how to do the modulo you mentioned.\n\nSo if you post some code here I can test it with my above example chart.\n. Ok, so I have jan as beginning (good!). Now it looks like:\n\n``` javascript\n      \"quarter\": {\n      span: 7257600000,\n      start: function(d) {\n        return new Date(d.getFullYear(), d.getMonth() - (d.getMonth()%3), 1);\n      },\n      fmt: function(d) {\n        return \"\" + (d.getFullYear()) + \"-\" + (Morris.pad2(d.getMonth() + 1));\n      },\n      incr: function(d) {\n        return d.setMonth(d.getMonth() + 3);\n      }\n    },\n```\n\n![chart4](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1481680/4810233/cde75252-5eb1-11e4-83da-6b8de84cd526.png)\n. I use this for \"Februar 2016\" for example as legend (mouse over popup) so you get an idea....\n\n``` javascript\ndateFormat: function (x) {\n            var IndexToMonth = [ \"Januar\", \"Februar\", \"M\u00e4rz\", \"April\", \"Mai\", \"Juni\", \"Juli\", \"August\", \"September\", \"Oktober\", \"November\", \"Dezember\" ];\n            var month = IndexToMonth[ new Date(x).getMonth() ];\n            var year = new Date(x).getFullYear();\n            return month + ' ' + year;\n        },\n```\n. xLabelFormat and dateFormat can't be used in a bar chart, is this correct!? Do you plan to support both also for bar charts?\n. I also have that \"problem\" of missing months in my chart, see screenshot\n\n![chart](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1481680/4807836/4f0ab4f0-5e99-11e4-8a5d-687e3856335c.png)\nI use this code to get my month names\n\n``` javascript\n        xLabelAngle: 70,\n        events: ['2013-12-01'],\n        xLabelFormat: function (x) {\n            var IndexToMonth = [ \"Jan\", \"Feb\", \"M\u00e4r\", \"Apr\", \"Mai\", \"Jun\", \"Jul\", \"Aug\", \"Sep\", \"Okt\", \"Nov\", \"Dez\" ];\n            var month = IndexToMonth[ x.getMonth() ];\n            var year = x.getFullYear();\n            return year + ' ' + month;\n        },\n        dateFormat: function (x) {\n            var IndexToMonth = [ \"Januar\", \"Februar\", \"M\u00e4rz\", \"April\", \"Mai\", \"Juni\", \"Juli\", \"August\", \"September\", \"Oktober\", \"November\", \"Dezember\" ];\n            var month = IndexToMonth[ new Date(x).getMonth() ];\n            var year = new Date(x).getFullYear();\n            return month + ' ' + year;\n        },\n```\n\nWhat I've found what could be the problem is: The chart width is too small so all the other month names are cutted out. When I resize the browser window the chart panel gets a little wider and then I can see all months\n![chart2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1481680/4807912/144dba46-5e9a-11e4-8319-c68ab64aa64a.png)\n**So is there a way I can manage how much month names are cutted out? For example show every quarter the month name would be nice.**\n\nThanks\n. @JelteF I'm using xLabelAngle already. I can add any value of \"xLabelMargin: xy,\" nothing changes at all to the chart...\n. So something like \n\n``` javascript\n      \"quarter\": {\n      span: 2419200000,\n      start: function(d) {\n        return new Date(d.getFullYear(), d.getMonth(), 1);\n      },\n      fmt: function(d) {\n        return \"\" + (d.getFullYear()) + \"-\" + (Morris.pad2(d.getMonth() + 3));\n      },\n      incr: function(d) {\n        return d.setMonth(d.getMonth() + 3);\n      }\n    },\n```\n\nshould do it, looking good here.

(I'm pulling data from an API every 3 hours.)\n\nMorris can't handle those numbers and format them into hours, as it's looking at them as a year.\n\nSo, to fix my issue, I'm just going to reformat my hours into actual date object hours and I should be good to go.\n\nHowever, that still leaves open the issue with the browser hanging on developers like me who are trying to use Morris.  It's a simple fix for us, but I imagine a more complicated fix for the developers of Morris.\n\nAnyways, I appreciate the responses and helping me narrow down my problem.\n\nThank you, Thadin.\n. That's perfect, thanks again Thadin!  Hopefully, this post will help others if they have similar problems in the future.\n. ",

You can allways parse your server data before setting up the chart like this:\n\n```\nvar i, len = data.length;\nfor (i = 0; i < len; i++) {\ndata[i].value = data[i].count;\ndelete data[i].count;\n}\n```\n. Yes, you are right.\n. ",
