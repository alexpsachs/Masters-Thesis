Thanks for the work here, and sorry re the delay in responding. I'll have to dig into this, but if I use it, I'd definitely rename `basic_stats`. It's a very general name, and, when sitting next to a file named `file_stats`, also takes on some redundancy. The `-o` option is much faster than `tally_authors`, although other flags seemed slower in a large repo (informal, groggy, early morning assessment here; no actual benchmarking done).\n. thanks! and sorry for the two-year-plus delay. :-)\n. hey, sorry for the colossal (two-year) delay in responding.
