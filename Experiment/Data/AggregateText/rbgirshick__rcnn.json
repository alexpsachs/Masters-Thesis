Model binaries and prototxt files have been upgraded. The demo returns the same results as before. I haven't tested fine-tuning yet, but it should be fine. \n\nI played around a bit with the different CPU BLAS options (MKL, Atlas, and OpenBLAS (multicore)). MKL was usably fast (~45s / image). Atlas was too slow to use (I killed it after a few of minutes). OpenBLAS was much slower than MKL (~220s / image with CPU utilization going between 100% and 1200% on a six-core i7).\n. Thanks for pointing that out.\n. Since this is a Caffe installation question, you should open an issue here: https://github.com/BVLC/caffe.\n. The test code certainly does, since at test time one does not know about (or assume) the presence of objects in the image. The code should also properly handle training images that do not contain any ground truth positive examples, though I haven't tested this case explicitly. \n. ILSVRC training is described here: http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2524. The corresponding code is in the `ilsvrc` branch.\n. I haven't been able to reproduce this error on my ubuntu 12.04 system.

You'll have more success trying to debug this issue over in the BVLC Caffe repository: https://github.com/BVLC/caffe.\n. That URL is incorrect. Please follow the README and use the correct URL in the fetch_data.sh script.\n. Your LD_LIBRARY_PATH must be incorrect. Maybe you compiled caffe using CUDA 5.5, for example, and have the path to the CUDA 6.0 libs in your library path? This is a problem with your particular setup, so I'm going to close it.\n. It is safe to ignore this _warning_. The model was serialized with a pointer to a function that exists only in the ilsvrc branch. The warning does not impair the functionality of the model or demo. (Are you sure that warning wasn't for the ILSVRC13 model? That's where I have seen it.)\n. My recommendation is to the look at the provided demo. It computes\nselective search boxes on an example image. You can generalize that code to\ncompute selective search boxes on your dataset.

You'll have more success trying to debug this issue over in the BVLC Caffe repository: https://github.com/BVLC/caffe.\n. That URL is incorrect. Please follow the README and use the correct URL in the fetch_data.sh script.\n. Your LD_LIBRARY_PATH must be incorrect. Maybe you compiled caffe using CUDA 5.5, for example, and have the path to the CUDA 6.0 libs in your library path? This is a problem with your particular setup, so I'm going to close it.\n. It is safe to ignore this _warning_. The model was serialized with a pointer to a function that exists only in the ilsvrc branch. The warning does not impair the functionality of the model or demo. (Are you sure that warning wasn't for the ILSVRC13 model? That's where I have seen it.)\n. My recommendation is to the look at the provided demo. It computes\nselective search boxes on an example image. You can generalize that code to\ncompute selective search boxes on your dataset.

I have tryed it and run rcnn_demo in CPU MODE successfully,Thank you very much@michael-panayiotou\uff0c But there is a problem with \"KMP_DUBLICATE_LIB_OK'.The rigth order is \nsetenv('KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK','TRUE');\n. In GPU MODE the Demo still can't work\uff0cthe error logging by GoogleLogging in Terminal is:\"relu_layer.cu:29  Check failed:error == cudaSuccess(9 vs. 0)  invalid configuration argument\"\nI will check it\n. In Matlab set the environmental variable \"KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK\" to be TRUE. To do this just write the following command in Matlab.\nsetenv('KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK','TRUE');\n. @fischeCPP  sorry,I only succeed in CPU mode\n. I have a same  problem with you,did you solve it?@michael-panayiotou \n\n---\n\n```\n        Abort signal detected at Thu Aug  7 15:50:54 2014\n```\n\n---\n\nConfiguration:\n  Crash Decoding  : Disabled\n  Current Visual  : 0x21 (class 4, depth 24)\n  Default Encoding: UTF-8\n  GNU C Library   : 2.15 stable\n  MATLAB Root     : /usr/local/MATLAB/R2012a\n  MATLAB Version  : 7.14.0.739 (R2012a)\n  Operating System: Linux 3.11.0-26-generic #45~precise1-Ubuntu SMP Tue Jul 15 04:02:35 UTC 2014 x86_64\n  Processor ID    : x86 Family 6 Model 42 Stepping 7, GenuineIntel\n  Virtual Machine : Java 1.6.0_17-b04 with Sun Microsystems Inc.

I have tried it ,but  failed.Have you sovled the problem in GPU model?Thank you for your reply.\n. I changed ubuntu 12.04 to kubuntu 14.04\uff0c\uff08ubuntu 14.04 desktop is not stable after the nvidia driver be set .maybe you will not encount this problem\uff09and everthing is ok\n. Sorry ,what I say is meant to the problem of the compatibility about the matlab .\nThe problem of relu_layer.cu:29 Check failed:error == cudaSuccess(9 vs. 0) invalid configuration argument ... I change the batch size of train and test under 30, and it can work after that.However,I could not figure this issue out until now.\n. I have the same problem and I have tried the solution above ,but  it failed. Could you @michael-panayiotou @bankcos   give me some suggestions? I would be very grateful for your help.\nBelow is my experiments infomation.\n Ubuntu 12.04,Matlab 2013a.\n\n---\n\n```\n        Abort signal detected at Thu Sep 11 17:21:24 2014\n```\n\n---\n\nConfiguration:\n  Crash Decoding     : Disabled\n  Current Visual     : 0x21 (class 4, depth 24)\n  Default Encoding   : UTF-8\n  GNU C Library      : 2.15 stable\n  MATLAB Architecture: glnxa64\n  MATLAB Root        : /usr/local/MATLAB/R2013a\n  MATLAB Version     : 8.1.0.604 (R2013a)\n  Operating System   : Linux 3.11.0-26-generic #45~precise1-Ubuntu SMP Tue Jul 15 04:02:35 UTC 2014 x86_64\n  Processor ID       : x86 Family 6 Model 58 Stepping 9, GenuineIntel\n  Virtual Machine    : Java 1.6.0_17-b04 with Sun Microsystems Inc.

I did not find any instructions on training with a custom data set.\n\nBut I was able to train rcnn and selective search using VOC 2007 templates with my own / custom images (just  2 classes to keep it simple), but when I run a test using rcnn_demo, it seems to select / box the entire image instead of finding the ROI of the interested class of object. I am not sure if it is related to my training examples or due to selective search boxes having been trained on VOC 2007 data set. Did you or anyone see similar results ?\n. Thank you @qiaosongwang. Will take a look at the selective search boxes. I was able to use the VOC 2007 boxes though and get about 68% accuracy. Not bad. But with selective_search tuned for a particular dataset, I may be able to get better accuracy. \n. If you have a list of images and their categories, you use it to create the class_train.txt, class_test.txt, class_val.txt, and class-trainval.txt. Divide the imageset into training images, test images, and validations images.  \n\nThe different ids go into class_train.txt, etc. The format of the class_train.txt is in the form  \"key\"  \"value\". Key is the image id, and value is either 0, 1, -1. -1 if it does not belong to the class and 1 if it belongs to that class.\n\nFor eg: bike_train.txt\n00001 -1\n00002 1\n\nwhere 00002 is 00002.jpg and belongs to the bike class.\n.
