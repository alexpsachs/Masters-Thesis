Closing, please reopen if this still an issue.. \ud83d\udc4d \r\n\r\nAny chance you'd be up for putting together a PR? :). FWIW, for the purpose of our use case.. we don't want the response to *ever* be served from cache. As such, using no-cache and unique ETag on each request is both simplest and easiest. . Resolved via https://github.com/igrigorik/ga-beacon/pull/54.. It appears that the demo instance is hitting its daily free quota limits on AppEngine, which is most likely why you're seeing this.  Note that the demo instance is just that.. a demo, no reliability guarantees. \n\nA simple fix is for you to deploy own GAE instance, the free tier should be plenty for most use cases. \n. AFAIK, this method will not work with Google Docs, because docs caches the image response.. Unfortunately.. no. If you stumble across a solution, please let me know!. @Ouaps please see https://github.com/igrigorik/ga-beacon/blob/master/README.md#can-i-use-this-production. Thanks!. This would imply that the beacon has to proxy arbitrary content from third-party origins, which is both very costly and not necessarily safe. I'm inclined to say that this is not something we want to support or enable.\r\n\r\nThanks for the suggestion!. Related discussion: https://github.com/igrigorik/ga-beacon/issues/47 -- that thread was leaning towards CC and dynamic ETag. Hmm?. After re-reading https://github.com/github/markup/issues/224.. I'm still confused by what Fastly is looking for. Also, the docs linked to in that thread are now out of date, which doesn't help.\r\n\r\n@triblondon can you chime in here? What should we be setting here? Is CC: no-store sufficient?. @triblondon thanks!\r\n\r\nBy the sounds of it, the policy we want is `Cache-Control: private, no-store`, and we can (hopefully) skip the etags, etc. @anthonyraymond wdyt, does that make sense to you?. Awesome -- thank you!. AFAIK, this is a problem with your GOPATH. Take a look at Go documentation: https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GOPATH. @kshitijb interesting. If that's the case, can you make a PR so we can land this here too?. PTAL here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15130321/is-there-a-method-to-generate-a-uuid-with-go-language :).

We do report the IP address of the user: \n- https://github.com/igrigorik/ga-beacon/blob/master/ga-beacon/ga-beacon.go#L83\n- https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/parameters#uip\n\nGeo reporting should work.\n. Closing, please reopen if this still an issue.. \ud83d\udc4d \r\n\r\nAny chance you'd be up for putting together a PR? :). FWIW, for the purpose of our use case.. we don't want the response to *ever* be served from cache. As such, using no-cache and unique ETag on each request is both simplest and easiest. . Resolved via https://github.com/igrigorik/ga-beacon/pull/54.. It appears that the demo instance is hitting its daily free quota limits on AppEngine, which is most likely why you're seeing this.  Note that the demo instance is just that.. a demo, no reliability guarantees. \n\nA simple fix is for you to deploy own GAE instance, the free tier should be plenty for most use cases. \n. AFAIK, this method will not work with Google Docs, because docs caches the image response.. Unfortunately.. no. If you stumble across a solution, please let me know!. @Ouaps please see https://github.com/igrigorik/ga-beacon/blob/master/README.md#can-i-use-this-production. Thanks!. This would imply that the beacon has to proxy arbitrary content from third-party origins, which is both very costly and not necessarily safe. I'm inclined to say that this is not something we want to support or enable.\r\n\r\nThanks for the suggestion!. Related discussion: https://github.com/igrigorik/ga-beacon/issues/47 -- that thread was leaning towards CC and dynamic ETag. Hmm?. After re-reading https://github.com/github/markup/issues/224.. I'm still confused by what Fastly is looking for. Also, the docs linked to in that thread are now out of date, which doesn't help.\r\n\r\n@triblondon can you chime in here? What should we be setting here? Is CC: no-store sufficient?. @triblondon thanks!\r\n\r\nBy the sounds of it, the policy we want is `Cache-Control: private, no-store`, and we can (hopefully) skip the etags, etc. @anthonyraymond wdyt, does that make sense to you?. Awesome -- thank you!. AFAIK, this is a problem with your GOPATH. Take a look at Go documentation: https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GOPATH. @kshitijb interesting. If that's the case, can you make a PR so we can land this here too?. PTAL here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15130321/is-there-a-method-to-generate-a-uuid-with-go-language :). ",

and did you set the default URL as ilya suggested above?\n@igrigorik : is this really necessary???\n. thanks mark for clarifiyng. will try first only to change the default URL as ilya suggested. if thats not successful i will delete the account\n. somehow the email / newsletter tracking does not work as expected...\nwe did run several tests with 5 different email addresses, for example:\nmail1@companyname.com: opened on Thunderbird PC1\nmail2@gmail.com               : opened on Android and later on as well on PC1 gmail browser interface\nmail3@companyname.com : opened on Thunderbird PC2\nmail4@companyname.com : opened on Thunderbird PC1\nmail5@someotherdomain.com : opened on  PC1 someotherdomain browser interface\n\nso my count would suggest 5 unique page views and 6 page views (because of the double gmail opening), but GA only shows 2 unique page views (which are definitely from prior opening any of the above mails, thus i guess false positives from the newsletter-tool?) and 3 page views.\n\nam i missing something out? or is there a bug (implementation or how ga-beacon works)?\nis this because we are opening those mails from within the same office / IP?\n. this is all very weird... after all that testing we thought that the unique page views are generated by the newsletter tool, so we finally did send the newsletter with 2 hours prior to midnight, in order to be able to filter in GA from the next day on, and count simple page views (usually a newsletter is opened only once). so we thought this might work with us. but after sending the NL (to more than 2500 subscribers), we got only 9 unique page views (as opposed to the expected > 2500) and up to today not a single normal page view! even though we were on the subscriber list ourselves and opened the NL on our PCs... \n\nany idea what could be failing here?\nif i copy the ga-beacon URL from the NLs sourcecode and insert it to a browser, the counting works and i get one UNIQUE PAGE VIEW and one NORMAL PAGE VIEW after lets say 15 min...\n. friendly bump...\nany idea / hint at all?\nanything, is much appreciated\n.

Here's an up to date link to the content that used to be at the location linked in the previous issue:\r\nhttps://docs.fastly.com/guides/basic-concepts/how-caching-and-cdns-work#cache-control\r\n\r\n(obviously a redirect would have been helpful, but that was before my time, and I haven't looked into why there wasn't one in this case)\r\n\r\nThe `private` token is sufficient to prevent any caching of assets by Fastly, assuming a customer has not overridden the default semantics of Cache-Control in their configuration of their Fastly instance (I can't speak for Github but they'd posted on that previous issue to say they respect normal HTTP caching rules).  `no-store` should prevent caching in the user-agent but it is not respected by Fastly, see:\r\n\r\nhttps://community.fastly.com/t/caching-happens-when-no-cache-or-no-store-requested/64\r\n\r\n`no-store` has interesting semantics: it is actually intended to flag content that is sensitive enough that it must not be written to non-volatile storage.
