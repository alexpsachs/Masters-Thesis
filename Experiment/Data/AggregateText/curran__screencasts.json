Hi Pradeep,\n\nHere is the code in [example 40](http://curran.github.io/screencasts/introToAngular/exampleViewer/#/40):\n\n``` javascript\ncountryApp.controller('CountryListCtrl', function ($scope, countries){\n  countries.list(function(countries) {\n    $scope.countries = countries;\n  });\n});\n```\n\nUnfortunately this code uses the variable name `countries` for two different things, which might be confusing. Here's a version with two different names:\n\n``` javascript\ncountryApp.controller('CountryListCtrl', function ($scope, countries){\n  countries.list(function(countriesList) {\n    $scope.countries = countriesList;\n  });\n});\n```\n\nThe code you have uses the array notation for dependency injection, but only specifies `$scope` as a dependency, not `countries`. Here's code similar to yours to show what is missing:\n\n``` javascript\ncountryApp.controller('CountryListCtrl', ['$scope', /* 'countries' should go here */ function ($scope, countries){\n  countries.list(function(countriesList) {\n    $scope.countries = countriesList;\n  });\n  console.log(countries);\n}]);\n```\n\nYou need to change your code to include `countries` as a dependency in the array, like this:\n\n``` javascript\ncountryApp.controller('CountryListCtrl', ['$scope', 'countries', function ($scope, countries){\n  countries.list(function(countriesList) {\n    $scope.countries = countriesList;\n  });\n  console.log(countries);\n}]);\n```\n\nHope this helps. Good luck.\n. Great! I don't have any videos on REST APIs yet, but it's good to know you would be interested in that.\n. This is wonderful, thank you for the correction!\n. Looks like this pull request was unintentional? Closing as there are no changes.\n. This is really nice, thank you.\n. Hello, it looks like this pull request was a mistake? I don't see anything new here..\n. Which link are you referring to?\n. Thanks for the note. I'm looking at [http://curran.github.io/screencasts/splittingCharts/examples/viewer/#/10](http://curran.github.io/screencasts/splittingCharts/examples/viewer/#/10) and it looks like this:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/68416/16354772/79c2056a-3abe-11e6-93eb-320ed99701fd.png)\n\nThe \"B\" ticks look fine to me. Are you seeing something different if you click that link? If so, what Browser are you using?\n. Ahh I see. I have an old Mac and the latest Chrome does not run on it. Can you please post a screenshot of what you see, and the errors from the console if there are any? Thanks!\n. If you're fine with text wrapping maybe try https://github.com/d3plus/d3plus-text\n. @OnlyBelter  Thanks for the PR, but the existing code is valid. It is using the [single var pattern](http://sixrevisions.com/javascript/single-var-pattern/), wherein multiple declarations are in a single statement, separated by a comma. If the comma were a semicolon, it would need multiple `var`s as you suggest.\r\n\r\nThe following two are equivalent:\r\n\r\nSingle var pattern.\r\n```js\r\nvar textInputElement = document.getElementById('textInput'),\r\n    nameDivElement = document.getElementById('nameDiv');\r\n```\r\n\r\nMultiple var pattern.\r\n```js\r\nvar textInputElement = document.getElementById('textInput');\r\nvar nameDivElement = document.getElementById('nameDiv');\r\n```. @OnlyBelter I'm just putting the files in subdirectories, which GitHub pages exposes as different URLs. This should also work for you.. Hi @7marjorie ,\r\n\r\nIf the data is missing, would you like to treat that as a zero value? If so, probably the best approach would be to detect which pairs are missing, and add \"fake data\" that fills them in as zero values, before passing the data into d3.nest.\r\n\r\nI think the problem is that `stack()` expects clean data where all possible pairs are filled in. Probably one way to sol you could do is not use `d3.nest()`, but instead roll your own nested loop that iterates over all combinations (the [cartesian product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product) of domains for the two fields), looks them up in the actual data, and generates a zero value for pairs that are not in the original data.\r\n\r\nThese answers might also be helpful:\r\n\r\n * http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14713503/how-to-handle-layers-with-missing-data-points-in-d3-layout-stack\r\n * http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17415406/filling-the-gaps-in-d3-array-nesting\r\n * [d3.nest() \"internal\" and \"external\" keys](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/d3-js/0zNu-oVVtwk) - This one has a nice solution.\r\n\r\nAlso, this would be a great question for the [D3 mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/d3-js), perhaps someone there has a better answer.. @7marjorie No problem! I feel like it's a common problem, and it would be interesting to have a library that does the filling in of the gaps based on the cartesian product.\r\n\r\nYou might also want to try Datalib https://github.com/vega/datalib/wiki/API-Reference#group-by-aggregation . They have a nice group-by aggregation feature. Although your data is already aggregated, I wonder if you pass it through their group-by processing if it might add in the zeros.. Probably easiest to have a single CSS file in the root page, then use the various CSS classes in the different pages.. You can add `div`s and nested elements, that should work just fine I think. It's just that there can only be one `<head>` and `<body>`, these cannot be nested.. Thank you again! Great work.

If that's the case how can I add more content to these partial .html files, such as `divs` with images, text etc...sorry if I'm misunderstanding!. Ok thanks!
