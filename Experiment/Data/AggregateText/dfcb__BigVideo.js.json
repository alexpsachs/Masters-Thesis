This is something I want to add in. I'll try to get to it at some point!\n. You can now use Ogg video. Added instructions to the demo page and a test page at http://dfcb.github.com/BigVideo.js/example-ogg.html\n. I'm not sure what I can do about the way Firefox renders Ogg in its native player on Mountain Lion. Hopefully that is a bug that Mozilla can quickly squash.\n\nI've also posted a webm example here, so give that a try. (requires Firefox 4 or higher)\nhttp://dfcb.github.com/BigVideo.js/example-webm.html\n. Coud you try putting an ogv on a web page with a video tag and seeing if there are any issues?\n. Ok cool. Thanks for taking the time to test it out!\n. Try Syd Lawrence's excellent VideoBG: https://github.com/sydlawrence/jquery.videoBG\n. Need a little more info on the functionality you are looking for. Have you seen the playlist example? http://dfcb.github.com/BigVideo.js/example-playlist.html\n. Not crashing for me on Chrome. Is anyone else having this problem? Does it crash every time, or just occasionally?\n. I've seen that strange FF bug pop up and never got it figured out. Something with the Flash fallback player isn't handling the resize correctly. My reco is to use .ogv for Firefox. Like so: \nhttp://dfcb.github.com/BigVideo.js/example-ogg.html\n\nUpdated the project page with a link to that example.\n. Opening issue so people can see the response. Also, IE has to use the Flash fallback, so performance is going to suck. Sorry. Use with caution!\n. Indeed!\n. To hide the controller, set #big-video-control-container to `display:none;` either in css or js.\n. Sounds like you might not be loading jQuery UI? (it is a BigVideo.js dependency)\n. Access the Video.js player with `getPlayer()`\n\n``` BV.getPlayer().pause();```\n```\n. The ambient demo isn't checking for touch. I just added a new example that does though and put a link in there. Sorry for the confusion. This is the Modernizr detect touch example: http://dfcb.github.com/BigVideo.js/example-ambient-touch.html\n. The issue is that most touch devices do not allow autoplay. You can play video after a user has initiated a touch event.\n. Should be fixed now. Update bigvideo.js on your site.\n. Added `example-simple-loop.html`\n. Should be working now. Give it a try.\n. It would be possible to create a version of this without jQuery UI if you don't need controls, but I'm not looking to do that with BigVideo.js - feel free to make a BigVideoLite.js fork or whatever if you like. There's also Syd Lawrence\u2019s excellent videoBG that you could try out. https://github.com/sydlawrence/jquery.videoBG\n. IE uses the flash fallback, which will be less performant than using the browser\u2019s HTML5 player. Only thing you can do is to do a great job compressing your videos.\n. Yep, is all about managing your z-index bizness.\n. You can't autoplay videos on iPad. That could be your issue. Generally, I recommend avoiding inline video for ipad, because of both bandwidth and performance issues with video playing in the browser instead of the native player.\n. Version 1.1.1 has improved multiple video format support.\n. I do accept pull requests. :)\n. Cool. Thanks!\n. Currently you can\u2019t. Might add that at some point, but for now I recommend you guys use VideoBG: http://syddev.com/jquery.videoBG/\n. You beat me to it. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Should be working now.\n. Yep, pro only.\n. Only pro I think\n. Should be working in Firefox now. Resolved an issue with the VideoJS 4.0 upgrade.\n. I actually had to keep that block of code, just needed to move it to a different spot. See https://github.com/dfcb/BigVideo.js/commit/8d03d972ae445a59c449ce23d994e013290cf21f\n. This is not supported at this time. I do accept pull requests!\n. Version 1.1.1 has improved multiple video format support.\n. I appreciate this! \n\nHowever, why the need to convert the indentation from tabs to 2-spaces? My personal preference is for tabs over spaces. I understand why some like the 2-space, but is not for me. I wouldn't care too much, but the other problem is that the diff shows a change to every single line of code, which can be problematic in the future. Any chance you could pluck that commit out?\n. Thanks for this!\n. Thanks man!\n\nThe only thing holding me back from merging this commit is that I want devs who aren't familiar Bower to be able to get up and running easily as well. I think updating the README with instructions for Bower and adding a link to the zip of the gh-pages demo version would work. Also, an update to the download links to point it to the gh-pages zip and a separate link for source that points to the github main branch page.\n\nI will try to get to it at some point soon.\n. Fixed via #104 \n. Thanks!!\n. The 'poster' property bug is actually in the Video.js script, so also follow the issue on their repo: https://github.com/videojs/video.js/issues/914\n. Sorry. Having an extreme lack of time lately. Thanks for your patience everybody!\n. Fixed in version 1.1.1\n. On this example page, I can see via the network tab in devtools that there is no reload:\nhttp://dfcb.github.io/BigVideo.js/example-ambient.html\n\nI had a branch where I was using the Video.js loop setting and there seemed to be a larger delay between loops. I do accept pull requests if somebody wants to try to improve looping - try branching off the gh-pages branch and implementing there.\n. Thanks!\n.  Unfortunately, I no longer have write access to this repository (I left the company almost a year ago). \n\nI think the time is ripe for me to pass the torch on this project. Any takers?\n. Fixed via #104 \n. Thanks!\n. No RTMP support at this time. I do accept pull requests :)\n. This bug is fixed by version 1.1.1 - I couldn't use your PR because it would break BV for people that are using the container setting.\n. Sounds good. PR it up!\n. Sounds right to me\n. Merged in at version 1.1\n. Ok cool. Thanks!\n. Miscapitalization of the script embed caused it not to load. Fixed in 387d2ee\n. You would have to self host or use a CDN. Version 1.1.1 has improved multiple video format support.\n. I'll look into implementing this soon. Thanks!\n. When I pulled this code into my demo pages, the VideoJS breaks with this error:\nUncaught TypeError: The element or ID supplied is not valid. (videojs) \n\nThe stack trace points to line 279 of BigVideo.js\n\nMore important than this though is that I no longer have write access to this repository (I left the company almost a year ago).\n. My privileges have been restored. If you can fix the issues and get the demo working with your new code, I'll be happy to accept your PR.\n. It is on the gh-pages branch.\n. No RTMP support at this time. I do accept pull requests :)\n. I do not have a solution for RTMP streaming. Happy to accept pull requests though.\n. Version 1.1.1 has improved multiple video format support.\n. This is great. I'm working on updating the demo pages. Unfortunately I haven't much time, but I'll try to get it done as soon as I can. Thanks for pitching in!\n. I'm working on the examples for the new playlist method, but not seeing it doing the fallback properly for Firefox. Can you take a look at the playlist-examples branch?  https://github.com/dfcb/BigVideo.js/tree/playlist-examples (look for example-multiformats.html and example-multiformats-playlist.html)\n. Sorry, haven't had time to get to it. I'm on 30.0 on Mac as well, but getting this error:\n\n> HTTP \"Content-Type\" of \"text/plain\" is not supported. Load of media resource http://localhost:8888/BigVideo.js/vids/dock.webm failed.\n. Ok got the MIME type issue on my localhost fixed and Firefox is happy now. Unfortunately, I'm not having luck with Safari (7.0.5) (getting a Sorry, no compatible source and playback technology were found message).\n. This example page on Safari 7.0.5: example-multiformats-playlist.html\n. Thanks!\n. Currently there is not, but you could do it manually by just setting it to loop and setting the volume to 0.\n. Try updating to the latest version of BigVideo where we have revised the way fallbacks work. So now you would do something like this:\n\n```\n$(function() {\n    var BV = new $.BigVideo({useFlashForFirefox:false});\n    BV.init();\n    BV.show([\n        { type: \"video/mp4\",  src: \"http://www.truecolorsva.com/videos/true_colors_splash_videoloop.mp4\" },\n        { type: \"video/webm\", src: \"http://www.truecolorsva.com/videos/true_colors_splash_videoloop.webm\" }\n    ]);\n});\n```\n. Fixed in 1.1.2 - thanks!\n. Whattup Marq! :)\n. Thanks!\n. @heff Thanks! Hey I have unfortunately not been able to maintain BigVideo.js as much as it deserves. If you guys would be interested in taking it over, let me know!\n. I would recommend implementing it as a plugin. Unfortunately, my availability is extremely limited at this time.

Now ideally you'd want Chrome to play webm and Safari mp4 after realizing it can't play the first webm source.
