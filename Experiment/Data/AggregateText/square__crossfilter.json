It may not have the intrigue of \"tesseract\", but it does describe the library's function succinctly.\n. Related: Allow records to have multiple values for a single dimension, such as labels or tags.\n\nRelated: Allow independent filters on the same dimension. These could be intersected or unioned.\n. IE8- is not supported. Try IE9+, and make sure you have <!DOCTYPE html>.\n. They're there so that you can play with the tesseract in the console. I don't see any harm in the example? Although perhaps it's setting a bad precedent.\n. I decided to take your advice and add the var. It'll be in 1.0.2.\n. This is the expected behavior: the _records_ are filtered, not the _groups_. In your example, the groups are returned in the expected order by descending value, including those groups whose value happens to be zero.\n. Correct. This would work:\n\n``` js\nlinks.top(Infinity).filter(function(d) { return d.value; })\n```\n\nIf you have lots and lots of groups, you could also use bisection (tesseract.bisect) to find the first zero-group and cut the array there. Or, if you're planning on iterating over the groups, just stop iterating when the value is zero.\n. I'll fix the documentation re. group.all(). I don't recall exactly, but I think the behavior may have changed from an earlier (unreleased) version of Tesseract that did not use incremental update for groups.\n\nIt _might_ be possible to filter zero-value groups from group.top, but that would either require tracking the count separately (which is a non-significant cost), or by comparing the top groups to the result of the reduceInitial function using the group's order accessor (using bisection, so it'd be fast). It's a bit tricky since the top groups are in descending order, and the bisection assumes ascending order, but in theory it's possible. And, I think it would improve the API.\n. No; group.top returns groups by descending value, whereas group.all returns groups by ascending key. The top method thus requires selecting + sorting, whereas the all method just returns the groups as-is. Another difference is that group.top returns a copy (of maximum size K), whereas group.all returns the internal array. I don't think it's a good idea to merge these into a single method, given that they do different things.\n. Sure, just set up dimensions on origin, destination, or route. For example, for flights from PHX:\n\n``` js\nvar origin = flight.dimension(function(d) { return d.origin; });\norigin.filterExact(\"PHX\");\n```\n\nOr for flights from PHX to ONT:\n\n``` js\nvar route = flight.dimension(function(d) { return d.origin + \"-\" + d.destination; });\nroute.filterExact(\"PHX-ONT\");\n```\n. Crossfilter only supports filtering contiguous ranges at the moment. For categorical dimensions (such as airport codes) I think it would make sense to implement a different type of filter can toggle arbitrary values rather than recording a contiguous range. So, I would fix that by adding a new feature. :)\n. The first part to better support categorical dimensions is deciding on an API, so you might consider that even if you don't feel comfortable tackling the implementation.\n\nI think the first decision is whether we want to support this as \"dimensions can have multiple filters\" (perhaps that can be intersected or unioned), or as \"dimensions can be either quantitative or ordinal\", in which case the filters on an ordinal dimension are tracked as a set of discrete values, rather than a contiguous range.\n. >  I guess all categorical dimensions can be considered ordinal by putting them in, e.g., alphabetical order.\n\nYep, that's all I meant.\n. The existing API already supports categorical dimensions, provided you only need a single exact match (use filterExact). This issue is about allowing _multiple_ values to be selected. We could enable that specifically for categorical dimensions, in which case the filter API would allow you to get or set multiple selected values. Or, we could figure out how to do it more generally for both categorical and quantitative dimensions. My guess is that enabling a different filter API for categorical dimensions would be less work and more convenient for the common use case. But, the general solution might be more powerful.\n. Correct, and it's not needed with subtract, because there's no ambiguity with string concatentation; the `-` operator coerces to a number.\n. Yes, but you'll want to use an [ordinal scale](/mbostock/d3/wiki/Ordinal-Scales) for the bottom axis. Also, brushing doesn't make a whole lot of sense with a categorical dimension such as origin, so you might want to just listen for click events on the bars rather than using a brush. But, it is possible to [brush on ordinal axes](/mbostock/d3/blob/master/examples/brush/brush-ordinal.html) if you like.\n. As shown in the \"brush on ordinal axis\" example I linked, the brush extent is different when you use an ordinal scale\u2014it's defined in terms of pixels rather than a range of ordinal values. So, you can't simply pass the brush extent to dimension.filterRange when using an ordinal scale. (And, like I said, brushing isn't a good affordance with ordinal scales anyway\u2014it'd probably be better if you let people click on the ordinal bars rather than brushing them.)\n. Interesting. Thanks for the suggestion!\n. Awesome. Thank you!\n. It LGTM, but I just haven't gotten around to pulling it yet. Probably need to rebuild crossfilter.min.js, create a new tag, npm publish, etc.\n. Sorry, I don't understand what you're asking. What's the difference between a running total and a sum?\n. Sure, you could do that. Use crossfilter to compute the sums, and then iterate over the sums at the end to compute the running total.\n. Easier to do it outside of crossfilter.\n. Please use Stack Overflow to post questions like this. As you can see from the documentation for [group.size](/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#wiki-group_size), it \"returns the number of distinct values in the group, independent of any filters; the cardinality.\" If you want to count the non-empty groups, then you want to do something like `group.all().filter(function(d) { return d.length; }).length`.\n. So, this is _bottom(k)_?\n. The record with the minimum value is returned by [dimension.top(1)](/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#wiki-dimension_top). And #26 adds support for dimension.bottom, so you could use that to extract the maximum value, too. I could maybe see adding dimension.extent() to return a two-element array containing the minimum and maximum value, which would be slightly more convenient in this case. Although less parsimonious. :)\n. Exposing the value accessor on the dimension (and likewise the key accessor on the group) seems reasonable. It\u2019s a little dangerous in that it could be overwritten, but I don\u2019t see that being a problem.\n\nExposing dimension.topValues(k) and dimension.bottomValues(k) (note: plural) also sounds reasonable.\n. There's no reason this hasn't been merged other than time\u2026\n. Yikes. This looks tricky to debug.\n. Kudos, Jason!\n. Crossfilter doesn't do any rendering, so I'm assuming you copied the bar chart from the [introduction page](http://square.github.com/crossfilter)? Yes, you may need to change the code if you are presenting different data.\n. There are no asynchronous methods in Crossfilter, so there's no need for it to incorporate an event-listener model. The only time events would be sent are when your code changes the filters.\n\nIf you want to use event listeners, then I recommend adding an event listener framework to your code so that you can loosely-couple side-effects when filters change. For example, if you use [D3.js](http://d3js.org), you can use [d3.dispatch](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Internals#wiki-d3_dispatch). There are likely other stand-alone libraries for creating custom events and notifying listeners if you'd prefer to use a different library.\n\nIn the [provided example](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/blob/gh-pages/index.html#L484-L509), the view is coordinated with the filters through D3's brush events.\n. Yup, GitHub revved their Markdown parser, and it broke much of the API reference in this project and others.\n. Discarding any references to the old crossfilter object should be sufficient to allow garbage collection.\n. Having different behavior for null _vs._ undefined is a bit surprising, since `null == undefined` and they are sometimes used ambiguously. More generally, dimension.filter is a convenience function for calling dimension.filterExact, dimension.filterRange or dimension.filterAll; so, if you want to be unambiguous, you should use those methods exclusively rather than dimension.filter.\n. You'll want to edit src/crossfilter.js, rather than the concatenated generated crossfilter.js. Also, would you mind adding tests for the same functionality?\n. Fixed by #3.\n. @jeroenooms I think it makes more sense to track that issue on #3.\n. I have added jasondavies and randometc as owners of crossfilter. Godspeed, chaps!\n. > There may be a slight performance\u2026\n\nThere are benchmarks, so you should be able to measure exactly what the performance cost is. (My guess is it\u2019s worth switching implementations when there are more than 32 dimensions.)\n. My 2\u00a2: keep the name db.remove, and rename dimension.remove and group.remove to dimension.dispose and group.dispose (or \u201cdestroy\u201d if you prefer) .

I am no longer the maintainer of this repo, but I noticed that your pull request causes a ReferenceError: exports is not defined when trying to load crossfilter.js using in a browser via script tag.\n. Since I\u2019m here anyway: see [_array_.reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce). The first argument _p_ is the previous value, the second argument _v_ is the current value.\n. ",
    "jasondavies": "Hmm, this failing test case didn't actually reproduce the problem, because this quicksort implementation isn't stable.\n\nI've pushed a new test that demonstrates the issue; namely taking ages to sort an array with 50% NaNs (does the same thing for undefined values). I think the stack limit in browsers must be much lower than in Node.js.\n. Okay, here's a fix! The issue is occurring because `!(NaN <= NaN || NaN >= NaN)` (likewise for `undefined`).  Native sort moves these values to the end of the array, so for consistency it's simple enough to make a single pass and move such values to the end. Unfortunately it affects performance a bit, but perhaps it can be optimised by effectively performing this check on-the-fly elsewhere in the code.\n\nI also wondered if caching coerced values would be useful e.g. to avoid calling valueOf twice for every comparison for dates, but perhaps smart JS VMs already optimise for this.\n. My test data had a field that was `undefined` for a large number of cases, which has the same comparative qualities as NaN. It's simple enough to work around but I can imagine it happening a lot in practice as real-world data doesn't always have consistent fields.\n. @john-guerra Thank you for noticing this; I\u2019ve fixed the issue and included a test case for bisect.right, which was the underlying cause.  I\u2019ve also merged with the latest master, so that jsfiddle no longer works due to the name change (tesseract\u2192crossfilter).\n. @john-guerra Fixed.\n. Awesome. :)\n. Folded into #58.\n. Some workarounds for incomparable values were attempted in versions v1.1.1-v1.1.3 but they were reverted as they caused too many issues: see the [v1.2.0 release notes](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/releases/tag/v1.2.0).  Better to simply avoid using mixed types or incomparable values (undefined or NaN).\n. That would be awesome!  I have a dataset with a multi-valued field, and managed to make it filter on this field by generating a new record for each value in the field for each original record (thus making it ~10x larger).  Then I used a custom reduce function to ensure the counts and summations were only on unique records (keyed by a unique ID per original record).  I think this uniqueness checking hurt the performance quite a bit though so it would be great to do this efficiently internally.\n\nSomething like this might work:\n\n``` javascript\nt.dimension.multiple(function(d) { return d.multipleValues; });\n```\n\nIndependent filters on the same dimension with union and intersection would solve my filterMultiple question; let me know if I can help with anything.\n. https://npmjs.org/package/crossfilter\n. Implemented in #85.\n. Folded into #60.\n. I guess a comment would make it clear for people copying and pasting, just in case it causes a problem.  Updated with a comment.\n. At the moment the only real workaround is to use [dimension.filterFunction](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#dimension_filterFunction).\n. I think the performance penalty of iterating over the returned array again to transform each element is negligible.  Note that array.map creates a fresh array, so if you\u2019re worried about performance you might prefer to replace each element in-place:\n\n``` js\nvar a = d.top(k);\nfor (var i = 0, n = a.length; i < n; ++i) {\n  a[i] = accessor(a[i]);\n}\n```\n. Nice!\n. You could keep a sorted array per group key, but then the overhead of maintaining this may be greater than simply recomputing the min/max per group key entirely from scratch.  Perhaps the lack of a reduceRemove function could force each group to be recomputed from scratch if anything is removed from that group, while still allowing incremental updates when records are added.\n. Fixed in #61.\n. On second thoughts, we can probably find a way to support this without having to recompute groups from scratch.\n. Making reduceRemove optional never made it into a release, as it would be preferable to avoid recomputing groups from scratch.\n. Ah, you need to pass `null`, e.g. `.reduce(add, null, initial)`.\n. If you are referring to the optional reduceRemove in #61 then no, they are different.  Making reduceRemove optional means that removing records (due to filters) forces a full rebuild of the group index (using reduceAdd only).  Thus it will work correctly with filters, but we decided it would be preferable to find a performant solution instead for finding maxima (e.g. using a heap), since rebuilding the group index from scratch is slow.\n. This sounds like an issue involving undefined values. See #3.\n\nYou can avoid this by filtering them out, by using the patch in #3, or by replacing them with something else that can be sorted.\n.

Thanks! I've successfully used bit vectors to represent multi-valued fields that only have up to 32 values. You can also simply use objects or arrays for more values.\n. Yes, this was a dangling global and I\u2019ve removed it now. Thanks.\n. Superseded by #64.\n. ``` js\nvar query = [\"foo\", \"bar\"];\ndimension.filter(function(d) { return query.indexOf(d) >= 0; });\n```\n\nSlightly faster but trickier if you want to create dynamic filters:\n\n``` js\ndimension.filter(function(d) { return d === \"foo\" || d === \"bar\"; });\n```\n. @jaytjioe, Crossfilter uses [semver](http://semver.org), thus there have been no new features added in v1.1.x since v1.1.0 (these are called patch versions).  The next minor version will be v1.2.0, and will include filtering by arbitrary functions.  Efficient multi-range filtering will probably not be until v1.3.0.\n. Please use the [crossfilter tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/crossfilter) on Stack Overflow if you want help. These issues are for feature requests and bug reports only. Thanks.\n. It can\u2019t handle NaN or undefined values at the moment. See #3 for a patch. One workaround is to replace missing values (NaN or undefined) with values that can be compared, e.g. zeroes or empty strings.\n. Unless you apply the patch from #3, NaNs and undefined values will break Crossfilter, since it cannot sort them properly. You either need to apply the patch, or replace them with something else _prior_ to passing the data to Crossfilter.\n. If you want to ignore them _everywhere_, just don\u2019t pass them to Crossfilter in the first place. For example:\n\n``` js\nvar db = crossfilter(data.filter(function(d) { return d.foo > 0; }));\n```\n\nThis will only include records with d.foo > 0.\n\nAlternatively, if you only want to ignore that particular _group_, just filter it out _after_ performing the group calculation.\n\n``` js\nvar group = dimension.group();\n// Filter out the stuff we don\u2019t want,\n// assuming we are grouping by some numerical key.\nvar groups = group.all().filter(function(d) { return +d.key > 0; });\n```\n\nStackOverflow would be a better forum for asking questions like this, since having one huge bar for zero is not a bug.\n. Issues with incomparable values (NaN and undefined) and grouping by such values are fixed in #3.\n\nYou still need to account for such values when visualising e.g. you might want to ignore the group representing missing values when computing the y-scale for your histogram, as mentioned above.\n. It could be [this issue](https://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=2326) that I spotted in beta a while ago. It was only fixed in V8 recently, so I don't know how long it'll take to filter down. I'll see if I can get the fix backported.\n. Update: it looks like it's definitely the same [issue](http://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=2326#c11), and it hasn't been merged into the release branches of V8 yet. I'll keep you updated.\n. Yes, the fix was merged into M23 a few days ago, but I think it\u2019s yet to be backported to M21 (stable).\n. M23 is now stable, so this issue should be resolved.\n. Interesting, thanks.  Since Crossfilter already works fine in both browsers and Node.js, I\u2019m not convinced there\u2019s any reason to change anything here.\n. Fixed by #36.\n. Thanks for the contribution!  I think it would be preferable to allow removal of all currently-selected records, reusing the existing fast filter logic, rather than a much slower table scan comparing object identities as in your implementation.  I have implemented this in #85, and would welcome feedback.\n. Thanks for the contribution.  Note that the equivalent can be achieved by creating a special dimension with a unique value for each possible combination of pivot groups:\n\n``` js\nvar pivotGroup = c\n    .dimension(function(d) { return d.gender + \"/\" + d.handed; })\n    .group(); // default groups use the dimension value\n```\n\nThis requires somewhat careful choice of separator (\"/\" seems convenient here, but you could use any character, even something like \"\\0\").\n\nA special dimension is required because group keys can only be based on the dimension value.  Alternatively, perhaps arbitrary groups on a \u201cdummy dimension\u201d, similar to [crossfilter.groupAll](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#wiki-crossfilter_groupAll) could be supported, that allow a group keys to be generated based on a record, e.g. `c.group(function(d) { return d.gender + \"/\" + d.handed; })`.\n\nI\u2019m inclined to keep the API simple and fast, and the use of a special dimension seems reasonable here.  The advantage over your pivotGroup implementation is that other standard group methods are also available, such as [top](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#wiki-group_top) and [order](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#wiki-group_order), and the special dimension can also be [removed](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#wiki-dimension_remove) when no longer needed.\n\nI\u2019m closing for now, but feel free to add comments if you think there\u2019s a problem with my approach, or an advantage to having a specialised API.\n. Why do they need to be zero-padded?  As long as you pick a suitable separator, no padding is necessary (`,` or `/` would work fine for numbers, or even `\\0` as discussed above).\n. Right, the array of all groups as returned by [group.all](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#wiki-group_all) will be in ascending natural order, so I agree the order could be unexpected if you have variable-length keys.  However, the grouping behaviour and top-K groups will all work as expected, which is the main point of using a dummy dimension in this manner.\n\nI\u2019d be open to considering proper tuple support, but only if performance remains reasonably fast.  Though not ideal, you can always clone the returned group.all array and sort it afterwards if you really need it to be sorted differently.\n. The dummy dimension is really only intended as a way to group by multiple keys at once, rather than for filtering.  If you want to filter, you can use an individual dimension that has the correct ordering.  So for your example you could say:\n\n``` js\ndimension0.filterExact(1);\ndimension1.filterRange([1, 19]);\n```\n. You\u2019re probably better off opening an issue at DefinitelyTyped. Thanks!\n. Fixed by #36.\n. Please use the [crossfilter tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/crossfilter) on Stack Overflow if you want help. These issues are for feature requests and bug reports only. Thanks.\n. Are you passing a host object e.g. a DOM object to the worker?  Crossfilter doesn\u2019t rely on the DOM so it should work fine inside a worker provided you\u2019re aware of the constraints.\n. Not easily, no.\n. Fixed by #60.\n. Yes, it looks like it is incorrectly counting 10 for quantity=2, when it should be 8.  I\u2019ll look into it soon.  I think the code that updates groups needs adjusting slightly.\n. Fixed in #3.\n. Tally ho, me old china!\n. Tests added.\n. Folded into #63.\n. Folded into #63.\n. I\u2019ve updated `src/package.js` since package.json is auto-generated, and converted the author, contributors and maintainers to be hashes.\n. Folded into #58.\n. Staged in #63.\n. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s worth the effort to support undefined or NaN group reduce values, because the concept of a \u201cmissing value\u201d doesn\u2019t make sense there.  However, it might be useful for reduceSum to ignore NaN values.\n. Closing this for now, since support for NaN values was reverted in 1.2.0.\n. The attempts to support unorderable values such as `NaN` or `undefined` were dropped in [version 1.2.0](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/releases/tag/v1.2.0).\n. If you convert incomparable values to `-Infinity`, they should appear last when calling dimension.top, so I don\u2019t see the problem there.  However, `-Infinity` should appear first when calling dimension.bottom, which might not be what you want.  Note that dimension.{bottom,top} respect the current filter on that dimension, so you could filter out values of `-Infinity` to avoid those records being returned.\n. I\u2019ll look into it.\n. Fixed in version 1.1.2; see b742be6146441195dd08d3f3b9f33601d1e175f8.\n. See also: mishoo/UglifyJS2#143.\n. Duplicate of #48.  You can achieve this by creating a dummy dimension with the value accessor being the multi-valued group key, then group using an identity function:\n\n``` js\nvar group = db\n    .dimension(function(d) { return d.week_date + \"/\" + d.target; })\n    .group();\n```\n\nThere may be a case for adding a database-wide group, but it would amount to the same thing, e.g. `db.group(function(d) { return d.week_date + \"/\" + d.target; })`.\n. If you want to run the example locally, you may need a Web server to get around the strict security settings in Chrome.  If you have Python, you can simply say:\n\n```\npython -mSimpleHTTPServer\n```\n\nThen access the example via http://127.0.0.1:8000/.\n\nI\u2019ve also just pushed an update to use D3 version 3, which allows you to use Safari or Firefox locally without requiring a Web server.  For Chrome, the above still applies.\n. So effectively you want to say something like:\n\n``` sql\nSELECT AVG(value)\nFROM table\nWHERE\n  yearmo=\"Jan 13\" AND\n    (value1 BETWEEN 80 AND 100) AND \n    (value7 BETWEEN 80 AND 100) OR\n  yearmo<>\"Jan 13\"\n```\n. Hmm. Would you want the trend line for each metric to ignore the filter on that metric?  This seems more in keeping with the way crossfilter approaches filters.  So in your example, the trend for value1 would ignore the value1 filter, but keep the value7 filter:\n\n``` sql\nSELECT yearmo, AVG(value1)\nFROM table\nWHERE (yearmo = 'Jan 13' AND value7 BETWEEN 80 AND 100) OR yearmo <> 'Jan 13'\nGROUP BY yearmo\n```\n\nAnd similarly for value7, etc.\n. This is technically possible using the new custom filter function support coming in version 1.2.0, which is staged in #63.  One trick is to use a dummy dimension to perform the filtering (which will then be intersected across all dimensions, including the one that you are using to group your averages).\n\n``` js\nvar dummy = db.dimension(function(d) { return d; });\ndummy.filter(function(d) {\n  return d.yearmo !== \"Jan 13\" || 80 <= d.value1 && d.value1 < 100 && 80 <= d.value7 && d.value7 < 100;\n});\n```\n\nA more ideal solution would be to allow independent range filters on dimensions that can then be combined in arbitrary ways, as this would be more efficient due to using binary search for range filtering rather than a full scan of all rows.  The above would still be reasonably efficient though, since the most time-consuming part is usually MapReduce, which remains incremental even for custom filter functions.\n. Yes.\n. Can you post a reproducible example somewhere, e.g. http://bl.ocks.org or http://jsfiddle.net ?\n. Crossfilter will sort according to the natural order of the values, so if they are strings, it will sort them as strings.  It sounds like you needed to coerce them to numbers in the value accessor, e.g.\n\n``` js\ndb.dimension(function(d) { return +d.myField; });\n```\n. Related #65, #71.\n. On the other hand, it does seem convenient to support the concept of \u201cmissing values\u201d using undefined.  But the concept can already be implemented without much work: the value accessor should return a naturally-orderable value, such as 0 or Infinity, and if such values should be ignored the MapReduce functions can ignore them.\n. Reverted in #63.\n. I believe the approach (and eventual name!) was inspired by Chris Weaver\u2019s [Multidimensional Visual Analysis Using Cross-Filtered Views](http://www.purdue.edu/discoverypark/vaccine/assets/pdfs/publications/pdf/Multidimensional%20Visual%20Analysis.pdf).\n\nGitHub is not really the best place to ask for support; the issues are meant for reporting bugs and feature requests. You can ask support questions using the [crossfilter tag on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/crossfilter) instead.\n. Yes, that seems wrong.  I\u2019m looking into it.\n. Thanks for the bug report.  There was no bug in Crossfilter or D3, but the example needed adjusting to return the top 40 flights by time as well as by day.\n. Strictly speaking, JSON is text-based encoding format, so I think you just want to retrieve the filtered records (as JavaScript objects), not JSON.\n\nTo retrieve all records intersected by the current filters, you can use [dimension.top(Infinity)](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#wiki-dimension_top), which will retrieve all records, sorted by that dimension (in descending order).  You can also use dimension.bottom(Infinity) to retrieve in ascending order.\n. I\u2019d need more information to reproduce this:\n- The dimension\u2019s value accessor.\n- The line number (in the unminified source) of the error.\n- The data in question (or a representative sample).\n\nEven better would be a working example on http://jsfiddle.net or http://bl.ocks.org.\n. Duplicate of #31; this is a bug in JSMin, which was fixed around 11 months ago, so updating your JSMin should fix it.\n. This is working as expected; the delay dimension is clamped to be between -60 and 149 inclusive:\n\n``` js\ndelay = flight.dimension(function(d) {\n  return Math.max(-60, Math.min(149, d.delay));\n}),\n```\n\nAs a result, the first and last bars of the graph include delays smaller than -60 and larger than 149 respectively, therefore filtering works as expected.\n\nPerhaps the axes could be clearer, but I\u2019ll close this bug for now unless anyone has any suggestions for improving them.\n. Can you be a bit more specific about your requirements?  Crossfilter already allows you to create groups, e.g. based on time (hourly, daily, etc.), and you can then specify arbitrary reduce functions for groups to compute various aggregates.  In your example, you could do something like:\n\n``` js\nfunction reduceAdd(p, v) { if (v.success) ++p.success; else ++p.failure; }\nfunction reduceRemove(p, v) { if (v.success) --p.success; else --p.failure; }\nfunction reduceInitial(d) { return {failure: 0, success: 0}; }\nfunction orderValue(p) { return p.success / (p.success + p.failure); }\n\nvar transactionsByDay = transactions.dimension(function(d) { return d.day; }),\n    transactionSuccessByDay = transactionsByDay.group()\n      .reduce(reduceAdd, reduceRemove, reduceInitial)\n      .order(orderValue);\n```\n\nThis would create daily groups, ordered by success rate, so you could easily list the top ten days by success rate, for instance.\n. I agree about `db.remove` not being an ideal name.  I don\u2019t see the need for a separate method for removing all records, though, you can simply call `db.removeRecords` (or whatever we call it) with no filters applied.  The main reason I don\u2019t like `db.remove` is that it\u2019s inconsistent with `dimension.remove` and `group.remove`, and it implies removal of the whole database (dimensions and groups), not just records.\n\nIf there was a good reason for a separate call to remove all records, I\u2019d call it `db.removeAll`.\n. Yes, I wish I had named them \u201cdestroy\u201d now\u2026 :)\n. GitHub issues are meant for reporting bugs and feature requests. You can ask support questions using the [crossfilter tag on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/crossfilter) instead, though your question sounds more generally related to using [D3](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/d3.js).\n. Thanks!  Fixed in version 1.3.3.\n. Note that you can already retrieve the filtered records using [dimension.top](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#wiki-dimension_top) (sorted by the dimension\u2019s natural order).  Is there a particular reason why that wouldn\u2019t be useful in your scenario?\n. > Using dimension.top doesn't work in this case as the filters come from different locations.\n\nCan you explain what you mean by the filters coming from different locations?  `dimension.top(Infinity)` does exactly the same as your patch, except that the records would be ordered by the dimension value (in descending order; `dimension.bottom(Infinity)` orders them in ascending order).  In other words, all filters are applied (including any on the dimension you\u2019re sorting by) before returning the records.\n. Perhaps you\u2019re confusing the behaviour of dimension.top with groups, which exclude their associated dimension\u2019s filter for computing reduce values.\n. @jdarling Read the documentation for [dimension.top](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#wiki-dimension_top) (or try it for yourself); you\u2019ll see that it returns the records, not the computed dimension values.\n. Thanks, I\u2019ve reproduced this and will submit a patch soon.\n. You could [remove](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#wiki-crossfilter_remove) all records and then add new ones, though this would require resetting all filters (to select all records for removal).\n. The maximum number of dimensions is 32 at the moment.  There is a proposed fix in #75.\n. These issues are intended for bug reports and feature requests; please post questions like this on a forum like StackOverflow.\n\n(In answer to your question, see the custom function `parseDate` in the example, which constructs Date objects using the right portions of the input strings.)\n. I think this is related to Crossfilter\u2019s general limitation of only allowing one set of filters to be active at any time.  I would rather improve the API so that it supports independent sets of filters.  You could then have charts based on one filterset, and perform other operations using a different filterset.\n. I\u2019ve thought about it, but haven\u2019t had time to implement it yet.  Most likely it would be backwards-incompatible, but it would support more powerful queries e.g. union/intersection/exclusion.\n. As I mentioned above, I\u2019d prefer a more general solution; at the moment Crossfilter only allows one set of filters to be active at a time, so adding a separate filter argument for removal alone feels inconsistent.\n. I think we\u2019re talking about the same thing. :)  I wrote:\n\n> adding a separate filter argument for removal alone feels inconsistent.\n\nBy \u201cfilter argument\u201d, I\u2019m referring to your \u201ctest function\u201d, i.e. `.remove(filterFunction)`.  I\u2019m not disputing the usefulness of this, but I would prefer a more general solution as it would be more powerful and elegant.  The indexed filter types (filterExact and filterRange) are also much faster than filterFunction, though admittedly this isn\u2019t really important for removal of records.\n. The [dimension value accessor](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#dimension) must return naturally-orderable values.  If an accessor returns an array, then JavaScript\u2019s relational operations (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`) will attempt to coerce the array to a number or a string.  I think this coercion will incur a performance penalty, particularly during the sort operation.\n\nI\u2019d recommend against using an array and returning an appropriate string instead if you really need a composite key.\n. I suggest reading up about how JavaScript performs [relational comparisons](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-11.8).  If you want to create a composite key for example, then you need to ensure any numbers are zero-padded since the array would be coerced to a string with comma separators.  It\u2019s better to be explicit and return a string if you want to do this.\n. Closing as I think we\u2019d prefer to keep the API simple.  You can write your own helpers to generate particular map/reduce functions as necessary.\n. Thanks for the contribution, but this is a duplicate of #113, and I think we\u2019d prefer to keep the API simple.\n. Not as far as I know.  Are you saying the issue can be reproduced with the [flight times](http://square.github.io/crossfilter/) example?  Can you give exact steps to reproduce?\n. Thanks!  Fixed in version 1.3.8.\n. Duplicate of #75.\n. Hello!  Thanks for the contribution.  However, I\u2019m afraid this is a duplicate of existing requests for the same feature: #113, #115, and related #102.  We\u2019ve taken the decision not to extend the API to support this, as we\u2019d prefer to keep it simple.  As noted in these tickets, it\u2019s possible to have a tiny helper function that unpacks an object and makes the appropriate reduce call, if that\u2019s something that you really need.\n. I think the main limitation of crossfilter at the moment is the types of queries it supports.  Essentially, you can only do `A & B & C & \u2026` where A, B, C etc. are range queries on distinct ordered dimensions.  It was developed primarily for fast interactive filtering of this specific type of query.  The possibility of generalisation _has_ been discussed elsewhere, and I will work on it when I have time (!), but I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s really any advantage to adding a high-level query engine at the moment when the low-level primitives are somewhat limited.\n\nI\u2019m closing as this issue isn\u2019t specifically a bug or feature request for Crossfilter itself (though it is another use case for making the low-level primitives more powerful).\n. Good catch, thanks.  Have you signed the [CLA](https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDViT2xzUHAwRkI3X3k5Z0lQM091OGc6MQ&ndplr=1)?\n. Good catch.  I have a fix and I\u2019m just working on a test case now.  Thanks!\n. It sounds like @unwiredbrain has the right idea; you can create one dimension per column, and then use [dimension.top(1)](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#dimension_top) to retrieve each dimension\u2019s maximum value (while respecting filters applied to all dimensions).\n\nHowever, you\u2019ll want to grab the lengths:\n\n``` js\nvar column0 = data.dimension(function(d) { return d[0].length; });\n```\n\nCrossfilter is not magical (OK, well just a little!) -- this won\u2019t be faster than looping over all your values and finding the maxima once-only.  However, it will be much faster when filtering is involved, hence the name!\n\nGitHub is not really the best place to ask for support; the issues are meant for reporting bugs and feature requests. You can ask support questions using the [crossfilter tag on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/crossfilter) instead.\n. This is [documented](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#dimension) behaviour: incomparable values such as `undefined` and `NaN` are not supported and will cause problems.\n. Further information is required to reproduce and diagnose the issue:\n- What kind of data are you sorting?  Does it contain incomparable (`NaN` or `undefined`) or mixed types (these are not supported)?\n- Some example code would be helpful.\n\nFeel free to reopen with this information.\n. These GitHub issues are meant for reporting bugs and feature requests only. You can ask support questions using the [crossfilter tag on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/crossfilter) instead.\n. `cnt.length` is 4, because there are 4 groups when grouped by type.  However, two of the groups have value 0, indicating that two of the types have zero counts for the current filters.  Groups with zero counts are not excluded, which seems to be your expectation.\n. If you only want non-zero groups, you can simply filter the array of groups:\n\n``` js\ncountGroup.top(Infinity).filter(function(d) { return d.value > 0; });\n```\n. As described in the documentation, [group.top](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#group_top) uses an ordering based on the group\u2019s value (in your example, the counts).  If you want all groups ordered by key, you can use [group.all](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#group_all) instead.\n. The objects representing groups are part of the API, but you can simply convert them to your own format after grouping, e.g.:\n\n``` js\nvalues.map(function(d) {\n  return {key: d.key, size: d.value.size, weight: d.value.weight};\n});\n```\n. Internally, groups are represented as {key, value} objects, so if you want to represent groups differently, you\u2019d either have to modify the internals or simply create your own representation as I\u2019ve suggested above.\n. Seems to work fine for me, perhaps you should post a reproducible example somewhere?  Personally I think it would be simpler to use `firstGrouping.top(Infinity)` and regroup small groups into \"(other)\" yourself.\n. Ah, sorry about that, perhaps I didn\u2019t test on a large enough sample to reproduce.  You\u2019re right: the group order must be consistent with the dimension\u2019s value order.  This is primarily to allow fast updating of groups internally.  It\u2019s a bit restrictive, but I think it\u2019s best to treat Crossfilter as quite a low-level API rather than a flexible high-level API.  In your case, this is why it would be better to regroup into \u201c(other)\u201d outside of Crossfilter.\n. Thanks!  This went unnoticed for two years and five months.  I think you deserve a prize!\n. Rather than using gulp, since the build process is quite simple I suppose it might be preferable to have a pure Node-based build without relying on heavyweight dependencies.\n\nWhich new contributor license feature are you referring to?\n. Thanks for the suggested fix.  I opted for a more bitwise approach rather than a comparison operator.  Your fix works fine in this situation, since this branch isn\u2019t taken for more than 16 dimensions (32-bit values), but the comparison operator wouldn\u2019t have worked if the bitwise representation had produced a negative value, which it can do in the 32-bit cases.\n. It\u2019s hard to say without more information.  Any error messages?  What changed ~1 week ago to cause this to happen?\n. Hmm, this failing test case didn't actually reproduce the problem, because this quicksort implementation isn't stable.\n\nI've pushed a new test that demonstrates the issue; namely taking ages to sort an array with 50% NaNs (does the same thing for undefined values). I think the stack limit in browsers must be much lower than in Node.js.\n. Okay, here's a fix! The issue is occurring because `!(NaN <= NaN || NaN >= NaN)` (likewise for `undefined`).  Native sort moves these values to the end of the array, so for consistency it's simple enough to make a single pass and move such values to the end. Unfortunately it affects performance a bit, but perhaps it can be optimised by effectively performing this check on-the-fly elsewhere in the code.\n\nI also wondered if caching coerced values would be useful e.g. to avoid calling valueOf twice for every comparison for dates, but perhaps smart JS VMs already optimise for this.\n. My test data had a field that was `undefined` for a large number of cases, which has the same comparative qualities as NaN. It's simple enough to work around but I can imagine it happening a lot in practice as real-world data doesn't always have consistent fields.\n. @john-guerra Thank you for noticing this; I\u2019ve fixed the issue and included a test case for bisect.right, which was the underlying cause.  I\u2019ve also merged with the latest master, so that jsfiddle no longer works due to the name change (tesseract\u2192crossfilter).\n. @john-guerra Fixed.\n. Awesome. :)\n. Folded into #58.\n. Some workarounds for incomparable values were attempted in versions v1.1.1-v1.1.3 but they were reverted as they caused too many issues: see the [v1.2.0 release notes](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/releases/tag/v1.2.0).  Better to simply avoid using mixed types or incomparable values (undefined or NaN).\n. That would be awesome!  I have a dataset with a multi-valued field, and managed to make it filter on this field by generating a new record for each value in the field for each original record (thus making it ~10x larger).  Then I used a custom reduce function to ensure the counts and summations were only on unique records (keyed by a unique ID per original record).  I think this uniqueness checking hurt the performance quite a bit though so it would be great to do this efficiently internally.\n\nSomething like this might work:\n\n``` javascript\nt.dimension.multiple(function(d) { return d.multipleValues; });\n```\n\nIndependent filters on the same dimension with union and intersection would solve my filterMultiple question; let me know if I can help with anything.\n. https://npmjs.org/package/crossfilter\n. Implemented in #85.\n. Folded into #60.\n. I guess a comment would make it clear for people copying and pasting, just in case it causes a problem.  Updated with a comment.\n. At the moment the only real workaround is to use [dimension.filterFunction](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#dimension_filterFunction).\n. I think the performance penalty of iterating over the returned array again to transform each element is negligible.  Note that array.map creates a fresh array, so if you\u2019re worried about performance you might prefer to replace each element in-place:\n\n``` js\nvar a = d.top(k);\nfor (var i = 0, n = a.length; i < n; ++i) {\n  a[i] = accessor(a[i]);\n}\n```\n. Nice!\n. You could keep a sorted array per group key, but then the overhead of maintaining this may be greater than simply recomputing the min/max per group key entirely from scratch.  Perhaps the lack of a reduceRemove function could force each group to be recomputed from scratch if anything is removed from that group, while still allowing incremental updates when records are added.\n. Fixed in #61.\n. On second thoughts, we can probably find a way to support this without having to recompute groups from scratch.\n. Making reduceRemove optional never made it into a release, as it would be preferable to avoid recomputing groups from scratch.\n. Ah, you need to pass `null`, e.g. `.reduce(add, null, initial)`.\n. If you are referring to the optional reduceRemove in #61 then no, they are different.  Making reduceRemove optional means that removing records (due to filters) forces a full rebuild of the group index (using reduceAdd only).  Thus it will work correctly with filters, but we decided it would be preferable to find a performant solution instead for finding maxima (e.g. using a heap), since rebuilding the group index from scratch is slow.\n. This sounds like an issue involving undefined values. See #3.\n\nYou can avoid this by filtering them out, by using the patch in #3, or by replacing them with something else that can be sorted.\n. Folded into #58.\n. Please use the [crossfilter tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/crossfilter) on Stack Overflow if you want help. These issues are for feature requests and bug reports only. Thanks.\n. This works fine with UglifyJS. Which minifier are you using?\n. Sounds like you're using a buggy version of jsmin: this was fixed in douglascrockford/JSMin@633d99205798c589eaec7b3d158319797dfcadb3.\n\nNo parentheses are necessary if the space is correctly retained.\n. Please use the [crossfilter tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/crossfilter) on Stack Overflow if you want help. These issues are for feature requests and bug reports only. Thanks.\n. Thanks! I've successfully used bit vectors to represent multi-valued fields that only have up to 32 values. You can also simply use objects or arrays for more values.\n. Yes, this was a dangling global and I\u2019ve removed it now. Thanks.\n. Superseded by #64.\n. ``` js\nvar query = [\"foo\", \"bar\"];\ndimension.filter(function(d) { return query.indexOf(d) >= 0; });\n```\n\nSlightly faster but trickier if you want to create dynamic filters:\n\n``` js\ndimension.filter(function(d) { return d === \"foo\" || d === \"bar\"; });\n```\n. @jaytjioe, Crossfilter uses [semver](http://semver.org), thus there have been no new features added in v1.1.x since v1.1.0 (these are called patch versions).  The next minor version will be v1.2.0, and will include filtering by arbitrary functions.  Efficient multi-range filtering will probably not be until v1.3.0.\n. Please use the [crossfilter tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/crossfilter) on Stack Overflow if you want help. These issues are for feature requests and bug reports only. Thanks.\n. It can\u2019t handle NaN or undefined values at the moment. See #3 for a patch. One workaround is to replace missing values (NaN or undefined) with values that can be compared, e.g. zeroes or empty strings.\n. Unless you apply the patch from #3, NaNs and undefined values will break Crossfilter, since it cannot sort them properly. You either need to apply the patch, or replace them with something else _prior_ to passing the data to Crossfilter.\n. If you want to ignore them _everywhere_, just don\u2019t pass them to Crossfilter in the first place. For example:\n\n``` js\nvar db = crossfilter(data.filter(function(d) { return d.foo > 0; }));\n```\n\nThis will only include records with d.foo > 0.\n\nAlternatively, if you only want to ignore that particular _group_, just filter it out _after_ performing the group calculation.\n\n``` js\nvar group = dimension.group();\n// Filter out the stuff we don\u2019t want,\n// assuming we are grouping by some numerical key.\nvar groups = group.all().filter(function(d) { return +d.key > 0; });\n```\n\nStackOverflow would be a better forum for asking questions like this, since having one huge bar for zero is not a bug.\n. Issues with incomparable values (NaN and undefined) and grouping by such values are fixed in #3.\n\nYou still need to account for such values when visualising e.g. you might want to ignore the group representing missing values when computing the y-scale for your histogram, as mentioned above.\n. It could be [this issue](https://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=2326) that I spotted in beta a while ago. It was only fixed in V8 recently, so I don't know how long it'll take to filter down. I'll see if I can get the fix backported.\n. Update: it looks like it's definitely the same [issue](http://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=2326#c11), and it hasn't been merged into the release branches of V8 yet. I'll keep you updated.\n. Yes, the fix was merged into M23 a few days ago, but I think it\u2019s yet to be backported to M21 (stable).\n. M23 is now stable, so this issue should be resolved.\n. Interesting, thanks.  Since Crossfilter already works fine in both browsers and Node.js, I\u2019m not convinced there\u2019s any reason to change anything here.\n. Fixed by #36.\n. Thanks for the contribution!  I think it would be preferable to allow removal of all currently-selected records, reusing the existing fast filter logic, rather than a much slower table scan comparing object identities as in your implementation.  I have implemented this in #85, and would welcome feedback.\n. Thanks for the contribution.  Note that the equivalent can be achieved by creating a special dimension with a unique value for each possible combination of pivot groups:\n\n``` js\nvar pivotGroup = c\n    .dimension(function(d) { return d.gender + \"/\" + d.handed; })\n    .group(); // default groups use the dimension value\n```\n\nThis requires somewhat careful choice of separator (\"/\" seems convenient here, but you could use any character, even something like \"\\0\").\n\nA special dimension is required because group keys can only be based on the dimension value.  Alternatively, perhaps arbitrary groups on a \u201cdummy dimension\u201d, similar to [crossfilter.groupAll](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#wiki-crossfilter_groupAll) could be supported, that allow a group keys to be generated based on a record, e.g. `c.group(function(d) { return d.gender + \"/\" + d.handed; })`.\n\nI\u2019m inclined to keep the API simple and fast, and the use of a special dimension seems reasonable here.  The advantage over your pivotGroup implementation is that other standard group methods are also available, such as [top](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#wiki-group_top) and [order](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#wiki-group_order), and the special dimension can also be [removed](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#wiki-dimension_remove) when no longer needed.\n\nI\u2019m closing for now, but feel free to add comments if you think there\u2019s a problem with my approach, or an advantage to having a specialised API.\n. Why do they need to be zero-padded?  As long as you pick a suitable separator, no padding is necessary (`,` or `/` would work fine for numbers, or even `\\0` as discussed above).\n. Right, the array of all groups as returned by [group.all](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#wiki-group_all) will be in ascending natural order, so I agree the order could be unexpected if you have variable-length keys.  However, the grouping behaviour and top-K groups will all work as expected, which is the main point of using a dummy dimension in this manner.\n\nI\u2019d be open to considering proper tuple support, but only if performance remains reasonably fast.  Though not ideal, you can always clone the returned group.all array and sort it afterwards if you really need it to be sorted differently.\n. The dummy dimension is really only intended as a way to group by multiple keys at once, rather than for filtering.  If you want to filter, you can use an individual dimension that has the correct ordering.  So for your example you could say:\n\n``` js\ndimension0.filterExact(1);\ndimension1.filterRange([1, 19]);\n```\n. You\u2019re probably better off opening an issue at DefinitelyTyped. Thanks!\n. Fixed by #36.\n. Please use the [crossfilter tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/crossfilter) on Stack Overflow if you want help. These issues are for feature requests and bug reports only. Thanks.\n. Are you passing a host object e.g. a DOM object to the worker?  Crossfilter doesn\u2019t rely on the DOM so it should work fine inside a worker provided you\u2019re aware of the constraints.\n. Not easily, no.\n. Fixed by #60.\n. Yes, it looks like it is incorrectly counting 10 for quantity=2, when it should be 8.  I\u2019ll look into it soon.  I think the code that updates groups needs adjusting slightly.\n. Fixed in #3.\n. Tally ho, me old china!\n. Tests added.\n. Folded into #63.\n. Folded into #63.\n. I\u2019ve updated `src/package.js` since package.json is auto-generated, and converted the author, contributors and maintainers to be hashes.\n. Folded into #58.\n. Staged in #63.\n. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s worth the effort to support undefined or NaN group reduce values, because the concept of a \u201cmissing value\u201d doesn\u2019t make sense there.  However, it might be useful for reduceSum to ignore NaN values.\n. Closing this for now, since support for NaN values was reverted in 1.2.0.\n. The attempts to support unorderable values such as `NaN` or `undefined` were dropped in [version 1.2.0](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/releases/tag/v1.2.0).\n. If you convert incomparable values to `-Infinity`, they should appear last when calling dimension.top, so I don\u2019t see the problem there.  However, `-Infinity` should appear first when calling dimension.bottom, which might not be what you want.  Note that dimension.{bottom,top} respect the current filter on that dimension, so you could filter out values of `-Infinity` to avoid those records being returned.\n. I\u2019ll look into it.\n. Fixed in version 1.1.2; see b742be6146441195dd08d3f3b9f33601d1e175f8.\n. See also: mishoo/UglifyJS2#143.\n. Duplicate of #48.  You can achieve this by creating a dummy dimension with the value accessor being the multi-valued group key, then group using an identity function:\n\n``` js\nvar group = db\n    .dimension(function(d) { return d.week_date + \"/\" + d.target; })\n    .group();\n```\n\nThere may be a case for adding a database-wide group, but it would amount to the same thing, e.g. `db.group(function(d) { return d.week_date + \"/\" + d.target; })`.\n. If you want to run the example locally, you may need a Web server to get around the strict security settings in Chrome.  If you have Python, you can simply say:\n\n```\npython -mSimpleHTTPServer\n```\n\nThen access the example via http://127.0.0.1:8000/.\n\nI\u2019ve also just pushed an update to use D3 version 3, which allows you to use Safari or Firefox locally without requiring a Web server.  For Chrome, the above still applies.\n. So effectively you want to say something like:\n\n``` sql\nSELECT AVG(value)\nFROM table\nWHERE\n  yearmo=\"Jan 13\" AND\n    (value1 BETWEEN 80 AND 100) AND \n    (value7 BETWEEN 80 AND 100) OR\n  yearmo<>\"Jan 13\"\n```\n. Hmm. Would you want the trend line for each metric to ignore the filter on that metric?  This seems more in keeping with the way crossfilter approaches filters.  So in your example, the trend for value1 would ignore the value1 filter, but keep the value7 filter:\n\n``` sql\nSELECT yearmo, AVG(value1)\nFROM table\nWHERE (yearmo = 'Jan 13' AND value7 BETWEEN 80 AND 100) OR yearmo <> 'Jan 13'\nGROUP BY yearmo\n```\n\nAnd similarly for value7, etc.\n. This is technically possible using the new custom filter function support coming in version 1.2.0, which is staged in #63.  One trick is to use a dummy dimension to perform the filtering (which will then be intersected across all dimensions, including the one that you are using to group your averages).\n\n``` js\nvar dummy = db.dimension(function(d) { return d; });\ndummy.filter(function(d) {\n  return d.yearmo !== \"Jan 13\" || 80 <= d.value1 && d.value1 < 100 && 80 <= d.value7 && d.value7 < 100;\n});\n```\n\nA more ideal solution would be to allow independent range filters on dimensions that can then be combined in arbitrary ways, as this would be more efficient due to using binary search for range filtering rather than a full scan of all rows.  The above would still be reasonably efficient though, since the most time-consuming part is usually MapReduce, which remains incremental even for custom filter functions.\n. Yes.\n. Can you post a reproducible example somewhere, e.g. http://bl.ocks.org or http://jsfiddle.net ?\n. Crossfilter will sort according to the natural order of the values, so if they are strings, it will sort them as strings.  It sounds like you needed to coerce them to numbers in the value accessor, e.g.\n\n``` js\ndb.dimension(function(d) { return +d.myField; });\n```\n. Related #65, #71.\n. On the other hand, it does seem convenient to support the concept of \u201cmissing values\u201d using undefined.  But the concept can already be implemented without much work: the value accessor should return a naturally-orderable value, such as 0 or Infinity, and if such values should be ignored the MapReduce functions can ignore them.\n. Reverted in #63.\n. I believe the approach (and eventual name!) was inspired by Chris Weaver\u2019s [Multidimensional Visual Analysis Using Cross-Filtered Views](http://www.purdue.edu/discoverypark/vaccine/assets/pdfs/publications/pdf/Multidimensional%20Visual%20Analysis.pdf).\n\nGitHub is not really the best place to ask for support; the issues are meant for reporting bugs and feature requests. You can ask support questions using the [crossfilter tag on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/crossfilter) instead.\n. Yes, that seems wrong.  I\u2019m looking into it.\n. Thanks for the bug report.  There was no bug in Crossfilter or D3, but the example needed adjusting to return the top 40 flights by time as well as by day.\n. Strictly speaking, JSON is text-based encoding format, so I think you just want to retrieve the filtered records (as JavaScript objects), not JSON.\n\nTo retrieve all records intersected by the current filters, you can use [dimension.top(Infinity)](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#wiki-dimension_top), which will retrieve all records, sorted by that dimension (in descending order).  You can also use dimension.bottom(Infinity) to retrieve in ascending order.\n. I\u2019d need more information to reproduce this:\n- The dimension\u2019s value accessor.\n- The line number (in the unminified source) of the error.\n- The data in question (or a representative sample).\n\nEven better would be a working example on http://jsfiddle.net or http://bl.ocks.org.\n. Duplicate of #31; this is a bug in JSMin, which was fixed around 11 months ago, so updating your JSMin should fix it.\n. This is working as expected; the delay dimension is clamped to be between -60 and 149 inclusive:\n\n``` js\ndelay = flight.dimension(function(d) {\n  return Math.max(-60, Math.min(149, d.delay));\n}),\n```\n\nAs a result, the first and last bars of the graph include delays smaller than -60 and larger than 149 respectively, therefore filtering works as expected.\n\nPerhaps the axes could be clearer, but I\u2019ll close this bug for now unless anyone has any suggestions for improving them.\n. Can you be a bit more specific about your requirements?  Crossfilter already allows you to create groups, e.g. based on time (hourly, daily, etc.), and you can then specify arbitrary reduce functions for groups to compute various aggregates.  In your example, you could do something like:\n\n``` js\nfunction reduceAdd(p, v) { if (v.success) ++p.success; else ++p.failure; }\nfunction reduceRemove(p, v) { if (v.success) --p.success; else --p.failure; }\nfunction reduceInitial(d) { return {failure: 0, success: 0}; }\nfunction orderValue(p) { return p.success / (p.success + p.failure); }\n\nvar transactionsByDay = transactions.dimension(function(d) { return d.day; }),\n    transactionSuccessByDay = transactionsByDay.group()\n      .reduce(reduceAdd, reduceRemove, reduceInitial)\n      .order(orderValue);\n```\n\nThis would create daily groups, ordered by success rate, so you could easily list the top ten days by success rate, for instance.\n. I agree about `db.remove` not being an ideal name.  I don\u2019t see the need for a separate method for removing all records, though, you can simply call `db.removeRecords` (or whatever we call it) with no filters applied.  The main reason I don\u2019t like `db.remove` is that it\u2019s inconsistent with `dimension.remove` and `group.remove`, and it implies removal of the whole database (dimensions and groups), not just records.\n\nIf there was a good reason for a separate call to remove all records, I\u2019d call it `db.removeAll`.\n. Yes, I wish I had named them \u201cdestroy\u201d now\u2026 :)\n. GitHub issues are meant for reporting bugs and feature requests. You can ask support questions using the [crossfilter tag on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/crossfilter) instead, though your question sounds more generally related to using [D3](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/d3.js).\n. Thanks!  Fixed in version 1.3.3.\n. Note that you can already retrieve the filtered records using [dimension.top](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#wiki-dimension_top) (sorted by the dimension\u2019s natural order).  Is there a particular reason why that wouldn\u2019t be useful in your scenario?\n. > Using dimension.top doesn't work in this case as the filters come from different locations.\n\nCan you explain what you mean by the filters coming from different locations?  `dimension.top(Infinity)` does exactly the same as your patch, except that the records would be ordered by the dimension value (in descending order; `dimension.bottom(Infinity)` orders them in ascending order).  In other words, all filters are applied (including any on the dimension you\u2019re sorting by) before returning the records.\n. Perhaps you\u2019re confusing the behaviour of dimension.top with groups, which exclude their associated dimension\u2019s filter for computing reduce values.\n. @jdarling Read the documentation for [dimension.top](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#wiki-dimension_top) (or try it for yourself); you\u2019ll see that it returns the records, not the computed dimension values.\n. Thanks, I\u2019ve reproduced this and will submit a patch soon.\n. You could [remove](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#wiki-crossfilter_remove) all records and then add new ones, though this would require resetting all filters (to select all records for removal).\n. The maximum number of dimensions is 32 at the moment.  There is a proposed fix in #75.\n. These issues are intended for bug reports and feature requests; please post questions like this on a forum like StackOverflow.\n\n(In answer to your question, see the custom function `parseDate` in the example, which constructs Date objects using the right portions of the input strings.)\n. I think this is related to Crossfilter\u2019s general limitation of only allowing one set of filters to be active at any time.  I would rather improve the API so that it supports independent sets of filters.  You could then have charts based on one filterset, and perform other operations using a different filterset.\n. I\u2019ve thought about it, but haven\u2019t had time to implement it yet.  Most likely it would be backwards-incompatible, but it would support more powerful queries e.g. union/intersection/exclusion.\n. As I mentioned above, I\u2019d prefer a more general solution; at the moment Crossfilter only allows one set of filters to be active at a time, so adding a separate filter argument for removal alone feels inconsistent.\n. I think we\u2019re talking about the same thing. :)  I wrote:\n\n> adding a separate filter argument for removal alone feels inconsistent.\n\nBy \u201cfilter argument\u201d, I\u2019m referring to your \u201ctest function\u201d, i.e. `.remove(filterFunction)`.  I\u2019m not disputing the usefulness of this, but I would prefer a more general solution as it would be more powerful and elegant.  The indexed filter types (filterExact and filterRange) are also much faster than filterFunction, though admittedly this isn\u2019t really important for removal of records.\n. The [dimension value accessor](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#dimension) must return naturally-orderable values.  If an accessor returns an array, then JavaScript\u2019s relational operations (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`) will attempt to coerce the array to a number or a string.  I think this coercion will incur a performance penalty, particularly during the sort operation.\n\nI\u2019d recommend against using an array and returning an appropriate string instead if you really need a composite key.\n. I suggest reading up about how JavaScript performs [relational comparisons](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-11.8).  If you want to create a composite key for example, then you need to ensure any numbers are zero-padded since the array would be coerced to a string with comma separators.  It\u2019s better to be explicit and return a string if you want to do this.\n. Closing as I think we\u2019d prefer to keep the API simple.  You can write your own helpers to generate particular map/reduce functions as necessary.\n. Thanks for the contribution, but this is a duplicate of #113, and I think we\u2019d prefer to keep the API simple.\n. Not as far as I know.  Are you saying the issue can be reproduced with the [flight times](http://square.github.io/crossfilter/) example?  Can you give exact steps to reproduce?\n. Thanks!  Fixed in version 1.3.8.\n. Duplicate of #75.\n. Hello!  Thanks for the contribution.  However, I\u2019m afraid this is a duplicate of existing requests for the same feature: #113, #115, and related #102.  We\u2019ve taken the decision not to extend the API to support this, as we\u2019d prefer to keep it simple.  As noted in these tickets, it\u2019s possible to have a tiny helper function that unpacks an object and makes the appropriate reduce call, if that\u2019s something that you really need.\n. I think the main limitation of crossfilter at the moment is the types of queries it supports.  Essentially, you can only do `A & B & C & \u2026` where A, B, C etc. are range queries on distinct ordered dimensions.  It was developed primarily for fast interactive filtering of this specific type of query.  The possibility of generalisation _has_ been discussed elsewhere, and I will work on it when I have time (!), but I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s really any advantage to adding a high-level query engine at the moment when the low-level primitives are somewhat limited.\n\nI\u2019m closing as this issue isn\u2019t specifically a bug or feature request for Crossfilter itself (though it is another use case for making the low-level primitives more powerful).\n. Good catch, thanks.  Have you signed the [CLA](https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDViT2xzUHAwRkI3X3k5Z0lQM091OGc6MQ&ndplr=1)?\n. Good catch.  I have a fix and I\u2019m just working on a test case now.  Thanks!\n. It sounds like @unwiredbrain has the right idea; you can create one dimension per column, and then use [dimension.top(1)](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#dimension_top) to retrieve each dimension\u2019s maximum value (while respecting filters applied to all dimensions).\n\nHowever, you\u2019ll want to grab the lengths:\n\n``` js\nvar column0 = data.dimension(function(d) { return d[0].length; });\n```\n\nCrossfilter is not magical (OK, well just a little!) -- this won\u2019t be faster than looping over all your values and finding the maxima once-only.  However, it will be much faster when filtering is involved, hence the name!\n\nGitHub is not really the best place to ask for support; the issues are meant for reporting bugs and feature requests. You can ask support questions using the [crossfilter tag on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/crossfilter) instead.\n. This is [documented](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#dimension) behaviour: incomparable values such as `undefined` and `NaN` are not supported and will cause problems.\n. Further information is required to reproduce and diagnose the issue:\n- What kind of data are you sorting?  Does it contain incomparable (`NaN` or `undefined`) or mixed types (these are not supported)?\n- Some example code would be helpful.\n\nFeel free to reopen with this information.\n. These GitHub issues are meant for reporting bugs and feature requests only. You can ask support questions using the [crossfilter tag on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/crossfilter) instead.\n. `cnt.length` is 4, because there are 4 groups when grouped by type.  However, two of the groups have value 0, indicating that two of the types have zero counts for the current filters.  Groups with zero counts are not excluded, which seems to be your expectation.\n. If you only want non-zero groups, you can simply filter the array of groups:\n\n``` js\ncountGroup.top(Infinity).filter(function(d) { return d.value > 0; });\n```\n. As described in the documentation, [group.top](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#group_top) uses an ordering based on the group\u2019s value (in your example, the counts).  If you want all groups ordered by key, you can use [group.all](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#group_all) instead.\n. The objects representing groups are part of the API, but you can simply convert them to your own format after grouping, e.g.:\n\n``` js\nvalues.map(function(d) {\n  return {key: d.key, size: d.value.size, weight: d.value.weight};\n});\n```\n. Internally, groups are represented as {key, value} objects, so if you want to represent groups differently, you\u2019d either have to modify the internals or simply create your own representation as I\u2019ve suggested above.\n. Seems to work fine for me, perhaps you should post a reproducible example somewhere?  Personally I think it would be simpler to use `firstGrouping.top(Infinity)` and regroup small groups into \"(other)\" yourself.\n. Ah, sorry about that, perhaps I didn\u2019t test on a large enough sample to reproduce.  You\u2019re right: the group order must be consistent with the dimension\u2019s value order.  This is primarily to allow fast updating of groups internally.  It\u2019s a bit restrictive, but I think it\u2019s best to treat Crossfilter as quite a low-level API rather than a flexible high-level API.  In your case, this is why it would be better to regroup into \u201c(other)\u201d outside of Crossfilter.\n. Thanks!  This went unnoticed for two years and five months.  I think you deserve a prize!\n. Rather than using gulp, since the build process is quite simple I suppose it might be preferable to have a pure Node-based build without relying on heavyweight dependencies.\n\nWhich new contributor license feature are you referring to?\n. Thanks for the suggested fix.  I opted for a more bitwise approach rather than a comparison operator.  Your fix works fine in this situation, since this branch isn\u2019t taken for more than 16 dimensions (32-bit values), but the comparison operator wouldn\u2019t have worked if the bitwise representation had produced a negative value, which it can do in the 32-bit cases.\n. It\u2019s hard to say without more information.  Any error messages?  What changed ~1 week ago to cause this to happen?\n. ",
    "eventualbuddha": "Out of curiosity, why do you want to sort NaN values?\n. Thanks for the note. I believe this is simply a misunderstanding of the documentation. In your example, the `links` group definitely is filtered by tokens matching \"Jimmy\", but it contains empty groups (`value == 0`). That's why you're seeing three results. From the documentation:\n\n> If there are fewer than k groups according to all of the tesseract's filters, then an array smaller than k will be returned. If there are fewer than k non-empty groups, this method may also return empty groups (for example, those with a count of zero).\n\nIn your example, `k` is `Infinity`, so all the empty groups will be returned. Using [this jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/5yzUp/), I got these results:\n\n``` js\nlinks.top(Infinity) // no filters\n[\n  {\"key\":\"http://www.engadget.com/2012/03/17/us-navy-lasr-research-facility-builds-robots-not-ray-guns/\",\n   \"value\":20},\n  {\"key\":\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/VUnm8ikk8a4/encyclopaedia-britannica-copyright-paypal-censorship.html\",\n   \"value\":10},\n  {\"key\":\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~r/arstechnica/index/~3/_dcrXs9GTTo/ion-beam-manufacturing-halves-production-cost-of-pv-panels.ars\",\n   \"value\":9}\n]\n\nlinks.top(Infinity) // filtering token by \"Jimmy\"\n[\n  {\"key\":\"http://www.engadget.com/2012/03/17/us-navy-lasr-research-facility-builds-robots-not-ray-guns/\",\n   \"value\":0},\n  {\"key\":\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/VUnm8ikk8a4/encyclopaedia-britannica-copyright-paypal-censorship.html\",\n   \"value\":1},\n  {\"key\":\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~r/arstechnica/index/~3/_dcrXs9GTTo/ion-beam-manufacturing-halves-production-cost-of-pv-panels.ars\",\n   \"value\":0}\n]\n```\n\nNote that there are the same number of group results in each but the values are different. Also note that I used `console.log(JSON.stringify(...))` because tesseract reuses the groups (I think) so inspecting their values after modifying them by filtering is misleading. If I completely misunderstood, please reopen this issue with a clarification. Thanks!\n. Just ignore the entries with `value == 0`.\n. I might be misunderstanding, but is there a difference between what you're proposing and simply post-processing the returned array?\n\n``` js\n// Array does not have .map in all browsers\ncf.top(k).map(accessor);\n```\n. @gavinpaulkelly Ah, okay. Just checking. I'd encourage you to try out crossfilter as it is and with your proposed change over at http://jsperf.com/. It won't tell you much about the extra storage required by having a duplicate array (except for any GC-related slowdown), but it should be able to answer your question about any speed penalty you might incur by doing the loop twice.\n. This actually is intentional. The prefix `+` is a shortcut for getting the primitive numeric value of an object. So if, for example, `f(v)` returned a `Date` or a `String` then the `+` would turn it into a number. For example:\n\n``` js\n3 + '9' // '39'\n3 + (+'9') // 12\n```\n. I'm having a hard time grokking the problem. Could you come up with something that doesn't use d3 (only crossfilter) and shows some numbers rather than bars? That might help identify the problem.\n. Seems like we should accept this. Did you just forget to press the big green button, @mbostock?\n. Nice!

There should be a group level listener when data is removed.\n\nSomething like this might work: \nin dimension: \n\n``` js\n   onDataRemoveListeners = []\n```\n\nin group: \n\n``` js\n...\n      filterListeners.push(update);\n      onDataRemoveListeners.push(onDataRemove);\n      indexListeners.push(add);\n...\n       // recompute the group when data is removed. \n       function onDataRemove() {\n           resetNeeded = true;\n           k = 0; \n           add(values, index,0,n)\n       };\n\n```\n\nI am pretty sure the renown owner of this repo will have a much better way to handle data removing ;) \nCheers\nC.\n. Pretty cool ;) \n\nWrote this https://github.com/NickQiZhu/dc.js/pull/91 to serve the same purpose !\nCheers,\nC.\n. +1, agree with wjbuys above.\n\nThe lib is fantastic, but it really need support multiple values for being used in most real-world cases dealing with qualitative dimension. \nIs there any chance this feature will be integrated one day ?\nCheers,\nC.\n.

I can confirm this is a bug as well. Crossfilter 1.1.1 shows the MSY-HOU flight with delay 29 when the filter is set to include the maximum delay of 150. If the filter is nudged down to 149.something then that flight is not shown any more. I note there are two MSY-HOU flights with delay 29 in the data-set, could that have something to do with it?\n\nI can look into this some more later this week - in the meantime @jasondavies any idea?\n. Update: the erroneous flight is the last row in the data. There is also a blank line at the end of the file. Removing the blank line fixes the bug.\n\nI assume this is something to do with the new null/NaN handling?\n. @asherkin the new release has different support for the handling of NaN and null values, so that must what is causing the issue. We'll figure it out :)\n. As discussed in #151 an active fork is being developed in a new [Crossfilter Organization](https://github.com/crossfilter).

Check for blank lines, `null` values, `undefined` values and `NaN` values in your input?\n. Is your number column comma-separated?\n\n```\n> var a = '100'\nundefined\n> +a\n100\n> var b = '1,000'\nundefined\n> +b\nNaN\n> \n```\n. It sounded like it wasn't just a performance problem - perhaps @optimuspaul can provide a failing test case for @sciyoshi to take a look at?\n. Thanks all for reviving this issue. I'm following along but don't have much bandwidth to contribute personally.\n\nI'm happy to review/merge/publish (ideally with +1 from Jason or Mike) once failing tests are provided and addressed. It's probably our most common feature request, and 5% slowdown for 1M items seems worth it if we can verify that on today's common browsers.\n\nThanks again!\n.

The results of a Cube query are delivered as JSON and the input to Crossfilter is JSON. I'm not sure there's anything more to it?\n\nRegardless, please post on Stack Overflow or the Cube Google Group for questions like this. If you try it and run into bugs feel free to post back here.\n. Apologies that nobody is responding to your commit. Sometimes things slip through, it's not personal. It's also reasonable to follow up and ask what's up :)\n\nLooking at [the commit](https://github.com/humanitiesplusdesign/crossfilter/commit/312bbc79f2e82ea5f5fbaf3bbf8695469f044bba) it's hard to tell what it does. Can you give an example of what it does and why it's needed?\n\nDigging in a bit (I'm not overly familiar with this code) it seems like you could just add `accessor: value` to the returned object, and you don't need a separate function. But since you pass `value` into the dimension yourself, I'm not sure why you need the dimension to give it back to you?\n. I'm confused...\n\nIn the [API reference](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference) we create a crossfilter for `payments`:\n\n``` javascript\nvar payments = crossfilter([\n  {date: \"2011-11-14T16:17:54Z\", quantity: 2, total: 190, tip: 100, type: \"tab\"},\n  // ...\n  {date: \"2011-11-14T17:29:52Z\", quantity: 1, total: 200, tip: 100, type: \"visa\"}\n]);\n```\n\nAnd then a dimension for `total`:\n\n``` javascript\nvar paymentsByTotal = payments.dimension(function(d) { return d.total; });\n```\n\nBreaking things down...\n\nYou're saying you'd like to call `paymentsByTotal.accessor(d)` to return `d.total` - correct?\n\nThis would achieve the same as doing:\n\n``` javascript\nvar paymentTotal = function(d) { return d.total; };\nvar paymentsByTotal = payments.dimension(paymentTotal);\n```\n\nAnd calling `paymentTotal(d)` - correct?\n\nSorry to de-rail, but I don't understand how `paymentsByTotal.accessor = 1` would do anything other than replace the reference to the `accessor` function with `1`. It wouldn't break `paymentTotal`. \n\nThis is where example code would be really helpful. Perhaps you have an interesting `value` function for your dimension?\n.

I'm not the most familiar with the cross-filter internals, so I defer to @jasondavies @mbostock and others on the specific approach here.\n\nFrom a process perspective - thanks for adding a test, and yes please, an update to 1.3.x would make it much more likely the PR will be merged.

Speaking as a maintainer: \n\nI'd happily take a pull request, even a broken one, and help you try to fix it. Showing us what doesn't work can be helpful too :)\n\nCan you point me at a good tutorial or documentation for the component format so I can understand how it's used and if it would benefit crossfilter in addition to the existing package.json and npm packages?\n. Thanks for sharing - this is really helpful. We'll take a look!\n. @christopherobin  please can you rebase this PR against the current crossfilter master, sign our [individual contributor license agreement](https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDViT2xzUHAwRkI3X3k5Z0lQM091OGc6MQ&ndplr=1), and fix the error @mbostock identified when loading the script in a browser? \n\nAlso, can you confirm that `component.json` needs to include `index.js`? I think that's just a convenience for node imports, but I'm not familiar with how components work.\n. Thanks! I think this is fine now, if it's not we'll fix it.

Please ask questions on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/crossfilter and note that as discussed in #151 an active fork is being developed in a new [Crossfilter Organization](https://github.com/crossfilter).\n. What about:\n\n``` javascript\nfunction reduceAddAvg(attr) {\n  return function(p,v) {\n    ++p.count\n    p.sum += v[attr];\n    p.avg = p.sum/p.count;\n    return p;\n  };\n}\nfunction reduceRemoveAvg(attr) {\n  return function(p,v) {\n    --p.count\n    p.sum -= v[attr];\n    p.avg = p.sum/p.count;\n    return p;\n  };\n}\nfunction reduceInitAvg() {\n  return {count:0, sum:0, avg:0};\n}\nvar statesAvgGroup = statesAvgDimension.group().reduce(reduceAddAvg('savings'), reduceRemoveAvg('savings'), reduceInitAvg);\nvar statesAvgGroup = statesAvgDimension.group().reduce(reduceAddAvg('cost'), reduceRemoveAvg('cost'), reduceInitAvg);\n// ... and so on\n```\n\nWould that work?\n.

Can you adjust the font size when the screen is narrow?\n\nIf you're editing it, can you break the lines in the HTML file so it's easier to review? And please use spaces not tabs (sorry!).\n\nIf possible, at wider screen sizes it would be nice to have some margins on the sides so that the content can breathe a bit.

I would do:\n\n``` javascript\nfunction reduceSum(attr){\n  return {\n    add: function(p, v) {\n      return p += v[attr];\n    },\n    remove: function(p, v) {\n      return p -= v[attr];\n    },\n    init: function() {\n      return 0;\n    }\n  };\n}\nvar rs = reduceSum('value')\nvar statesAvgGroup = statesAvgDimension.group().reduce(rs.add, rs.remove, rs.init);\n```\n\nThat should work - no modifications to crossfilter needed!\n.

Fair question, thanks for asking!\n\nTrue: nobody at Square is actively maintaining this library right now, and we don't use it in the Square Dashboard where it was originally deployed (we moved all computation server side again). \n\nThat doesn't mean nobody is using it. I'll ask around and see if someone is willing to help triage issues and merge down good PRs. If not, we'll look for a different solution (perhaps a couple more external maintainers to help Jason out!) \n. I'm the Square maintainer for crossfilter, and @jasondavies is also a maintainer who independently merges PRs and new releases. In 99% of cases over the last 2+ years I have just deferred to Jason.\n\nStill asking around internally at Square for volunteers (not opposed to more outside maintainers but it's more work to manage, so starting locally). Give us a day or two to figure it out.\n\n@gordonwoodhull I will also ask about the agreement in case there's room for an update there. Is any agreement an impediment, or something about our specific one? Understand either way, just curious if it can be fixed.\n. On #109 it seems like there was some support from Jason already, but no code. I would create a branch and try it, and get buy-in from other contributors. Forgiveness not permission. It would mean cutting a major release number if it breaks the API, but that shouldn't be an issue if the pay-off is worth it.\n\n#92 certainly looks like cause for concern since I've ignored it for 18 months. Apologies for that. Folks who are following along, it would be helpful to review and test this PR if it's a strong candidate for merging. I have no opinion on it except what I already shared :)\n\n#75 needs reviewing, verifying and benchmarking again following @sciyoshi's fixes. Please help.\n. I freely admit there is no active maintenance from Square on the project at this time. I'm able to drop-in to discussions like this quickly, and can provide stylistic and process guidance, but I can't commit to properly reviewing PRs if that's what it takes to unblock them.\n\nStill asking around internally, that will give us the info we need to decide what happens next. I'm open to \"blessing\" a fork as well, which is what we did with Cube when it became clear we weren't going to actively maintain that.\n. Many reasons. Some including: data volume, mobile performance, parity between results on different reporting platforms (web, app, email, etc).\n. No volunteers inside of Square. I'm not sure of the best steps forward, I'll find a time to swap notes with @jasondavies and see if we can identify one or two people to assist.\n. Aside: it sounds like a lot of contributors are finding crossfilter via dc.js? We've also had several issues filed here that turned out to be dc.js issues. Would the dc.js maintainers consider forking crossfilter for their purposes and accepting patches directly there?\n. Sorry for the delayed update here.\n\nI spoke with Jason and we're in agreement at a high level: as @gordonwoodhull speculated above, we consider crossfilter essentially \"finished\" at this point (being targeted at the use-case on the demo page: linked charts of dimensions from a simple flat dataset). I share this as plainly as possible so you know why Jason and I are not picking up the pace on PRs on this repo.\n\nWe completely agree that there are possible extensions and API improvements that would be worth putting into a \"crossfilter\" v2. But we also agree that if we were doing that we would probably write something from scratch using the lessons learned from v1. Neither of us is planning to start such a project.\n\nI am investigating if any of Square's other projects have ever spun out into a github org. I doubt that it will happen - it's difficult because of our requirement for contributor agreements. It's more likely we would encourage contributors to organize among themselves (something like \"crossfilter-contrib\" would make it clear it's not Square's thing, and could always be renamed in future). If the participants on this thread want to go ahead and do that, it's probably the best way to focus the energies and enthusiasms of the group.\n. Just closing the loop here... \n\nSelf-organizing an org makes sense. That's what I would have done. I would personally prefer it be called something else (add \"-contrib\" or something) but I'm not speaking for Square here. Speaking for Square - please unpublish http://crossfilter.github.io/crossfilter/ and/or remove the Square logo from it and make it clearer that it's a fork. It's probably best to remove the gh-pages branch from the fork until you're ready to cut a new release. Likewise please update the README to not be written as Square. Thanks!\n\nBefore linking from Square's crossfilter repo I'd like to ensure that meaningful additions/features are happening - the forks of Cube were significantly modified/enhanced before we linked to them. Keep me posted once the initial merges settle, I'll make it happen!\n\nThanks for understanding and keeping the energy going!\n. @derekperkins @tannerlinsley @gordonwoodhull et al - thank you for keeping the dream alive. I've chosen option 2 as the easiest for now, and added a note to the README on the square version at https://github.com/square/crossfilter/blob/master/README.md\n\nI have asked internally about unlocking/transferring the crossfilter npm and bower packages so that newer versions can be published there, and about transferring the repo itself to allow github to redirect everyone. But I make no promises about following through with this - please act as if it won't happen, I'll ping you if the situation changes :)\n\nHopefully it is clear that [crossfilter/crossfilter](https://github.com/crossfilter/crossfilter/) is the home of active improvement. Thanks to all who weighed in on this thread. Please take further discussion to an issue there! :chart_with_upwards_trend: :raised_hands: \n.

Cheers! \n. :+1: LGTM.\n\n@mbostock do you want to merge and bump versions, or add me and Jason to the npm package so we can take care of it?\n. Oh ha, good catch. Makes sense :)\n. I can confirm this is a bug as well. Crossfilter 1.1.1 shows the MSY-HOU flight with delay 29 when the filter is set to include the maximum delay of 150. If the filter is nudged down to 149.something then that flight is not shown any more. I note there are two MSY-HOU flights with delay 29 in the data-set, could that have something to do with it?\n\nI can look into this some more later this week - in the meantime @jasondavies any idea?\n. Update: the erroneous flight is the last row in the data. There is also a blank line at the end of the file. Removing the blank line fixes the bug.\n\nI assume this is something to do with the new null/NaN handling?\n. @asherkin the new release has different support for the handling of NaN and null values, so that must what is causing the issue. We'll figure it out :)\n. As discussed in #151 an active fork is being developed in a new [Crossfilter Organization](https://github.com/crossfilter).

Check for blank lines, `null` values, `undefined` values and `NaN` values in your input?\n. Is your number column comma-separated?\n\n```\n> var a = '100'\nundefined\n> +a\n100\n> var b = '1,000'\nundefined\n> +b\nNaN\n> \n```\n. It sounded like it wasn't just a performance problem - perhaps @optimuspaul can provide a failing test case for @sciyoshi to take a look at?\n. Thanks all for reviving this issue. I'm following along but don't have much bandwidth to contribute personally.\n\nI'm happy to review/merge/publish (ideally with +1 from Jason or Mike) once failing tests are provided and addressed. It's probably our most common feature request, and 5% slowdown for 1M items seems worth it if we can verify that on today's common browsers.\n\nThanks again!\n.

The results of a Cube query are delivered as JSON and the input to Crossfilter is JSON. I'm not sure there's anything more to it?\n\nRegardless, please post on Stack Overflow or the Cube Google Group for questions like this. If you try it and run into bugs feel free to post back here.\n. Apologies that nobody is responding to your commit. Sometimes things slip through, it's not personal. It's also reasonable to follow up and ask what's up :)\n\nLooking at [the commit](https://github.com/humanitiesplusdesign/crossfilter/commit/312bbc79f2e82ea5f5fbaf3bbf8695469f044bba) it's hard to tell what it does. Can you give an example of what it does and why it's needed?\n\nDigging in a bit (I'm not overly familiar with this code) it seems like you could just add `accessor: value` to the returned object, and you don't need a separate function. But since you pass `value` into the dimension yourself, I'm not sure why you need the dimension to give it back to you?\n. I'm confused...\n\nIn the [API reference](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference) we create a crossfilter for `payments`:\n\n``` javascript\nvar payments = crossfilter([\n  {date: \"2011-11-14T16:17:54Z\", quantity: 2, total: 190, tip: 100, type: \"tab\"},\n  // ...\n  {date: \"2011-11-14T17:29:52Z\", quantity: 1, total: 200, tip: 100, type: \"visa\"}\n]);\n```\n\nAnd then a dimension for `total`:\n\n``` javascript\nvar paymentsByTotal = payments.dimension(function(d) { return d.total; });\n```\n\nBreaking things down...\n\nYou're saying you'd like to call `paymentsByTotal.accessor(d)` to return `d.total` - correct?\n\nThis would achieve the same as doing:\n\n``` javascript\nvar paymentTotal = function(d) { return d.total; };\nvar paymentsByTotal = payments.dimension(paymentTotal);\n```\n\nAnd calling `paymentTotal(d)` - correct?\n\nSorry to de-rail, but I don't understand how `paymentsByTotal.accessor = 1` would do anything other than replace the reference to the `accessor` function with `1`. It wouldn't break `paymentTotal`. \n\nThis is where example code would be really helpful. Perhaps you have an interesting `value` function for your dimension?\n.

I'm not the most familiar with the cross-filter internals, so I defer to @jasondavies @mbostock and others on the specific approach here.\n\nFrom a process perspective - thanks for adding a test, and yes please, an update to 1.3.x would make it much more likely the PR will be merged.

Speaking as a maintainer: \n\nI'd happily take a pull request, even a broken one, and help you try to fix it. Showing us what doesn't work can be helpful too :)\n\nCan you point me at a good tutorial or documentation for the component format so I can understand how it's used and if it would benefit crossfilter in addition to the existing package.json and npm packages?\n. Thanks for sharing - this is really helpful. We'll take a look!\n. @christopherobin  please can you rebase this PR against the current crossfilter master, sign our [individual contributor license agreement](https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDViT2xzUHAwRkI3X3k5Z0lQM091OGc6MQ&ndplr=1), and fix the error @mbostock identified when loading the script in a browser? \n\nAlso, can you confirm that `component.json` needs to include `index.js`? I think that's just a convenience for node imports, but I'm not familiar with how components work.\n. Thanks! I think this is fine now, if it's not we'll fix it.

Sorry - your last comment seemed to be directing people to a new discussion so I didn't have anything else to add.\n\nSee #151 for discussion of future of Crossfilter. I've updated square/crossfilter's README to indicate that the crossfilter org will be actively maintaining a fork. I figured you were already aware since you linked to reductio. Apologies for misunderstanding.\n. Apologies for silence here. Please ask questions on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/crossfilter and note that as discussed in #151 an active fork is being developed in a new [Crossfilter Organization](https://github.com/crossfilter).\n. What about:\n\n``` javascript\nfunction reduceAddAvg(attr) {\n  return function(p,v) {\n    ++p.count\n    p.sum += v[attr];\n    p.avg = p.sum/p.count;\n    return p;\n  };\n}\nfunction reduceRemoveAvg(attr) {\n  return function(p,v) {\n    --p.count\n    p.sum -= v[attr];\n    p.avg = p.sum/p.count;\n    return p;\n  };\n}\nfunction reduceInitAvg() {\n  return {count:0, sum:0, avg:0};\n}\nvar statesAvgGroup = statesAvgDimension.group().reduce(reduceAddAvg('savings'), reduceRemoveAvg('savings'), reduceInitAvg);\nvar statesAvgGroup = statesAvgDimension.group().reduce(reduceAddAvg('cost'), reduceRemoveAvg('cost'), reduceInitAvg);\n// ... and so on\n```\n\nWould that work?\n.

Can you adjust the font size when the screen is narrow?\n\nIf you're editing it, can you break the lines in the HTML file so it's easier to review? And please use spaces not tabs (sorry!).\n\nIf possible, at wider screen sizes it would be nice to have some margins on the sides so that the content can breathe a bit. Something a cross between what you have at https://drahmel.github.io/crossfilter/ and what we have today at https://square.github.io/crossfilter/ would be great - my monitor is 2560px wide, and I regularly browse at ~1800px :)\n\nLastly, can you sign our electronic contributor agreement so I can safely merge your changes without talking to a lawyer? https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDViT2xzUHAwRkI3X3k5Z0lQM091OGc6MQ&ndplr=1\n.

Cheers! \n. @RandomInsano you don't need `new` there in your `ReduceSum` object, but you do need to return something from the factory, or attach those add/remove/init methods to the function's prototype. I would do:\n\n``` javascript\nfunction reduceSum(attr){\n  return {\n    add: function(p, v) {\n      return p += v[attr];\n    },\n    remove: function(p, v) {\n      return p -= v[attr];\n    },\n    init: function() {\n      return 0;\n    }\n  };\n}\nvar rs = reduceSum('value')\nvar statesAvgGroup = statesAvgDimension.group().reduce(rs.add, rs.remove, rs.init);\n```\n\nThat should work - no modifications to crossfilter needed!\n.

Fair question, thanks for asking!\n\nTrue: nobody at Square is actively maintaining this library right now, and we don't use it in the Square Dashboard where it was originally deployed (we moved all computation server side again). \n\nThat doesn't mean nobody is using it. I'll ask around and see if someone is willing to help triage issues and merge down good PRs. If not, we'll look for a different solution (perhaps a couple more external maintainers to help Jason out!) \n. I'm the Square maintainer for crossfilter, and @jasondavies is also a maintainer who independently merges PRs and new releases. In 99% of cases over the last 2+ years I have just deferred to Jason.\n\nStill asking around internally at Square for volunteers (not opposed to more outside maintainers but it's more work to manage, so starting locally). Give us a day or two to figure it out.\n\n@gordonwoodhull I will also ask about the agreement in case there's room for an update there. Is any agreement an impediment, or something about our specific one? Understand either way, just curious if it can be fixed.\n. On #109 it seems like there was some support from Jason already, but no code. I would create a branch and try it, and get buy-in from other contributors. Forgiveness not permission. It would mean cutting a major release number if it breaks the API, but that shouldn't be an issue if the pay-off is worth it.\n\n#92 certainly looks like cause for concern since I've ignored it for 18 months. Apologies for that. Folks who are following along, it would be helpful to review and test this PR if it's a strong candidate for merging. I have no opinion on it except what I already shared :)\n\n#75 needs reviewing, verifying and benchmarking again following @sciyoshi's fixes. Please help.\n. I freely admit there is no active maintenance from Square on the project at this time. I'm able to drop-in to discussions like this quickly, and can provide stylistic and process guidance, but I can't commit to properly reviewing PRs if that's what it takes to unblock them.\n\nStill asking around internally, that will give us the info we need to decide what happens next. I'm open to \"blessing\" a fork as well, which is what we did with Cube when it became clear we weren't going to actively maintain that.\n. Many reasons. Some including: data volume, mobile performance, parity between results on different reporting platforms (web, app, email, etc).\n. No volunteers inside of Square. I'm not sure of the best steps forward, I'll find a time to swap notes with @jasondavies and see if we can identify one or two people to assist.\n. Aside: it sounds like a lot of contributors are finding crossfilter via dc.js? We've also had several issues filed here that turned out to be dc.js issues. Would the dc.js maintainers consider forking crossfilter for their purposes and accepting patches directly there?\n. Sorry for the delayed update here.\n\nI spoke with Jason and we're in agreement at a high level: as @gordonwoodhull speculated above, we consider crossfilter essentially \"finished\" at this point (being targeted at the use-case on the demo page: linked charts of dimensions from a simple flat dataset). I share this as plainly as possible so you know why Jason and I are not picking up the pace on PRs on this repo.\n\nWe completely agree that there are possible extensions and API improvements that would be worth putting into a \"crossfilter\" v2. But we also agree that if we were doing that we would probably write something from scratch using the lessons learned from v1. Neither of us is planning to start such a project.\n\nI am investigating if any of Square's other projects have ever spun out into a github org. I doubt that it will happen - it's difficult because of our requirement for contributor agreements. It's more likely we would encourage contributors to organize among themselves (something like \"crossfilter-contrib\" would make it clear it's not Square's thing, and could always be renamed in future). If the participants on this thread want to go ahead and do that, it's probably the best way to focus the energies and enthusiasms of the group.\n. Just closing the loop here... \n\nSelf-organizing an org makes sense. That's what I would have done. I would personally prefer it be called something else (add \"-contrib\" or something) but I'm not speaking for Square here. Speaking for Square - please unpublish http://crossfilter.github.io/crossfilter/ and/or remove the Square logo from it and make it clearer that it's a fork. It's probably best to remove the gh-pages branch from the fork until you're ready to cut a new release. Likewise please update the README to not be written as Square. Thanks!\n\nBefore linking from Square's crossfilter repo I'd like to ensure that meaningful additions/features are happening - the forks of Cube were significantly modified/enhanced before we linked to them. Keep me posted once the initial merges settle, I'll make it happen!\n\nThanks for understanding and keeping the energy going!\n. @derekperkins @tannerlinsley @gordonwoodhull et al - thank you for keeping the dream alive. I've chosen option 2 as the easiest for now, and added a note to the README on the square version at https://github.com/square/crossfilter/blob/master/README.md\n\nI have asked internally about unlocking/transferring the crossfilter npm and bower packages so that newer versions can be published there, and about transferring the repo itself to allow github to redirect everyone. But I make no promises about following through with this - please act as if it won't happen, I'll ping you if the situation changes :)\n\nHopefully it is clear that [crossfilter/crossfilter](https://github.com/crossfilter/crossfilter/) is the home of active improvement. Thanks to all who weighed in on this thread. Please take further discussion to an issue there! :chart_with_upwards_trend: :raised_hands: \n.

I don't see any \"ignore entries\" function for the group results listed in the API reference.\n. Excellent, thanks.\n\nIn investigating why group.top(Infinity) was preferable to group.all(), I encountered this in the group.all() documentation:\n\n> Unlike top, however, the returned array may contain empty groups, whose value is the return value from the group's reduce initial function.\n\nDoesn't this conflict with the statement (two or three lines above) that eventualbuddha referenced?\n\n> If there are fewer than k non-empty groups, this method may also return empty groups (for example, those with a count of zero).\n. I can't speak for others, but filtering zero-value groups would certainly be useful for my usage of the API. :) I can see the zero-value groups being useful in other cases, though, so I think you'd want to make the filter optional.\n\nOn the subject of API adjustments, have you considered aliasing `top(Infinity)` with an overload of the `all` function? Using `group.all(Boolean clone)` would be slightly less [astonishing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment) to me, compared to top(Infinity).\n. Arrr, I must be getting senile--I thought I read both result sets were in descending order. Sorry.\n. @mbostock do you have a recommendation for filtering on a non-continuous range (e.g. PHX and SMF but not SAN)? It seems like it'd be possible to do by assigning a dimension to each airport code, but I'm wondering if there's a Better Way.\n. Noted. In the meantime, this has worked well for me so far:\n\n```\noriginPHX = crossfilter.dimension (function(d) { return d.origin == 'PHX' });\n//...\noriginPHX.filter(true); //use false to get all flights were the origin isn't PHX\n```\n\nThis snippet seems quite susceptible to generalization, assuming there aren't performance concerns...\n. As an API consumer, I'm inclined to vote for Option B (ordinal dimensions) because I don't see a clean way to represent the union and intersection operations for Option A (multi-filter) without some sort of domain-specific query language or array messiness, particularly when the operations are mixed. It does seem possible--albeit awkard--to synthesize Option B's behavior with Option A by taking the union of a set of ranges that match the discrete boundaries plus or minus some tolerance.\n\nI must confess that I don't follow the description of @Sigfried's use case, so I can't say which option would fit that case better.\n.

Excellent, thanks.\n\nIn investigating why group.top(Infinity) was preferable to group.all(), I encountered this in the group.all() documentation:\n\n> Unlike top, however, the returned array may contain empty groups, whose value is the return value from the group's reduce initial function.\n\nDoesn't this conflict with the statement (two or three lines above) that eventualbuddha referenced?\n\n> If there are fewer than k non-empty groups, this method may also return empty groups (for example, those with a count of zero).\n. I can't speak for others, but filtering zero-value groups would certainly be useful for my usage of the API. :) I can see the zero-value groups being useful in other cases, though, so I think you'd want to make the filter optional.\n\nOn the subject of API adjustments, have you considered aliasing `top(Infinity)` with an overload of the `all` function? Using `group.all(Boolean clone)` would be slightly less [astonishing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment) to me, compared to top(Infinity).\n. Arrr, I must be getting senile--I thought I read both result sets were in descending order. Sorry.\n. @mbostock do you have a recommendation for filtering on a non-continuous range (e.g. PHX and SMF but not SAN)? It seems like it'd be possible to do by assigning a dimension to each airport code, but I'm wondering if there's a Better Way.\n. Noted. In the meantime, this has worked well for me so far:\n\n```\noriginPHX = crossfilter.dimension (function(d) { return d.origin == 'PHX' });\n//...\noriginPHX.filter(true); //use false to get all flights were the origin isn't PHX\n```\n\nThis snippet seems quite susceptible to generalization, assuming there aren't performance concerns...\n. As an API consumer, I'm inclined to vote for Option B (ordinal dimensions) because I don't see a clean way to represent the union and intersection operations for Option A (multi-filter) without some sort of domain-specific query language or array messiness, particularly when the operations are mixed. It does seem possible--albeit awkard--to synthesize Option B's behavior with Option A by taking the union of a set of ranges that match the discrete boundaries plus or minus some tolerance.\n\nI must confess that I don't follow the description of @Sigfried's use case, so I can't say which option would fit that case better.\n.

Thanks for the reply.\nIve been going through the documentation and I believe that\n\n<code>\n\n```\nvar originArray = new Array();\nflights.map(function(d) { \noriginArray.push(d.origin); \n}); \noriginArray  = unique(originArray);\n\n barChart()\n    .dimension(originid)\n    .group(originids)       \n .x(d3.scale.ordinal()\n    .domain(originArray)\n.rangeRoundBands([0, 900], 1))\n```\n\n</code>\n\nshould be interchangeable with:\n\n<code>\n\n  barChart()\n        .dimension(originid)\n        .group(originids)  \n    .x(d3.scale.linear()\n        .domain([0, 30])\n        .rangeRound([0, 10 \\* 90]))\n\n</code>\nhowever i cant seem to get it to work :(\nCan you tell me what i am missing?\n\nhttp://www.pixeltradr.com/crossfilter/\nhttp://www.pixeltradr.com/crossfilter/indexOrdinal.html\n. Tried again with a simple example\n\nI got the X axis to display the string values\n\nhttp://pixeltradr.com/crossfilter/indexName.html\n\nIn the example above there are 3 charts, the first 2 are the ones using ordinal scales and the third uses a linear scale.\nThe problem is that the charts using ordinal scales dont filter the charts when using the brush.\n\nThe linear scale example does what i need it to do, but i need string labels instead of numbers\n. Thanks again for the reply\nYea i think clicking on the bars would be alot better, ive seen a few examples that do that, ill work on that.\n. hey there, I think i narrowed it down, the problem isnt with reduceSum\n\nits to do with the <code>y.domain([-100, group.top(1)[0].value]);</code>\n\nwhich shows the key and value of the largest in the group\nThis works fine when all values in the y axis are positive:\n\n---\n\n<code>\nObject { key=3, value=300}   // selects correct value\n// key:[1] value:[90] \n// key:[2] value:[100] \n// key:[3] value:[300]                 // largest value\n\n## </code>\n\nhowever when you have negative values the largest number is the smallest negative.\n\n---\n\n<code>\nObject { key=1, value=-90}  // selects incorrect value\n// key:[1] value:[-90] \n// key:[2] value:[-100] \n// key:[3] value:[-300]              // largest negative value\n\n## </code>\n\nThe reason why the bars are exceeding the 0-100 y range is that the maximum value is based on an incorrect figure (of -90, when it should be based on -300)\n\ni wonder if it would be possible to create another function - that would return the top array sorted with absolute values\n\n<code>y.domain([0, group.<b>topAbs</b>(1)[0].value]);</code>\n\nI believe that using absolute values would solve this issue \n. I think i solved it, but dont know what the effects will be on the rest of the crossfilter plugin\n\nhttp://www.pixeltradr.com/crossfilter/indexPaymentsCrossfilter.html\nhttp://www.pixeltradr.com/crossfilter/indexPaymentsCrossfilterNegative.html\nhttp://www.pixeltradr.com/crossfilter/indexPaymentsCrossfilterPositive.html\n\nIve changed the crossfilter plugin in <b>function heapselect()</b> to include <b>Math.abs()</b> in three places:\n\n---\n\n<code>\nfunction heapselect(a, lo, hi, k) {\n    var queue = new Array(k = Math.min(hi - lo, k)),  min,   i,   x,   d;  \n    for (i = 0; i < k; ++i) queue[i] = a[lo++];\n    heap(queue, 0, k);\n    if (lo < hi) {\n      min =  <b>Math.abs</b>(f(queue[0]));  \n      do {  \n        if (x = <b>Math.abs</b>(f(d = a[lo])) > min) {\n          queue[0] = d;\n          min = <b>Math.abs</b>(f(heap(queue, 0, k)[0]));\n        }\n      } while (++lo < hi);\n    }\n    return queue;\n  }\n</code>\n\n---\n\nAlso edited the html file itself and added <b>Math.abs()</b> to:\n\n<code>y.domain([0, <b>Math.abs</b>(group.top(1)[0].value)]);</code>\n\nand in <b>function barPath(group)</b>\n\n---\n\n<code>\nfunction barPath(groups) {\n        var path = [],    pathPositive = [], pathNegative = [], pathBoth = [], i = -1, n = groups.length, d;\n        while (++i < n) {\n                 d = groups[i];  \n          if(d.value < 0 || d.key < 0){ \n            pathNegative.push(\"M\", x(d.key), \",\", height, \"V\", y(<b>Math.abs</b>(d.value)), \"h9V\", height);  \n          }else{\n            pathPositive.push(\"M\", x(d.key), \",\", height, \"V\", y(<b>Math.abs</b>(d.value)), \"h9V\", height);\n          }\n          pathBoth.push(\"M\", x(d.key), \",\", height, \"V\", y(<b>Math.abs</b>(d.value)), \"h9V\", height);  \n        }\n    path[0] = pathPositive.join(\"\")\n        path[1] = pathNegative.join(\"\")\n        path[2] = pathBoth.join(\"\")\n        return path;\n      }\n</code>\n\n---\n\nI think it would probably be better to create new functions like -  function heapselectAbs(a, lo, hi, k) {}\n for example to to handle this situation.\n. Decided to leave the old sort functions alone, and create new ones to handle this situation:\n\ninstead of:\n<code>y.domain([0, group.top(1)[0].value]);</code>\nits now \n<code>y.domain([0, group.topAbs(1)[0].value]);</code>\n\nNew crossfilter file:\nhttp://pixeltradr.com/crossfilter/crossfilter.v1.abs.js\n\nchanges:\n- function topAbs(k)\n- function heapselectAbs_by(f) \n  ----- function heapselectAbs(a, lo, hi, k) \n\nhttp://pixeltradr.com/crossfilter/crossfilter.v1.abs.js\n. Wow thats awesome!\nIt works, Thanks alot!\n. Hi Mike, a running total takes the previous x sum value and adds it to the next x sum value, then takes the combined um of those values and adds it to the following sum and so on till the end.

    "esjewett": "Didn't see this and I think I've basically duplicated it in #92 . However, correct me if I'm wrong, but does this solution properly calculate a maximum if a group is created on a crossfilter that already has filters applied? I don't think so, but I'm not sure.\n. I see. Yes, that is a different use-case - finding filtered max/min vs my need in #92 for finding unfiltered max/min for new groups after a filter has already been applied.\n. I'd really like to see this functionality added one way or another. We're using CrossFilter to back a browser based visualization application that works on arbitrary data sets and it would be nice to be able to be more generous to users with regards to the number of dimensions that can be created when using certain visualization components that require large numbers of dimensions.\n. Sorry, don't mean to pester, but I'm not sure what the correct approach is here. We're making some additions to Crossfilter and I'm creating pull requests when it seems to make sense to push those changes upstream, but so far have not seen any response on either pull request. Is there a different way to get changes evaluated for addition to this repository?\n\nThanks, and again, sorry to bother.\n. Cool, glad this is the right approach :-) I know it's not personal, but also wasn't sure what the standard procedure was. Thanks! I will ping on my other pull request as well.\n\nRegarding your question: I didn't want to return `value` on it's own because if someone assigned something else to it (`dimension.accessor = 1`), then the entire dimension would go haywire. I figured it was safer to provide a function that takes a record `d` as input and returns the result of the `value(d)` function.\n\nThis change isn't strictly necessary, as we can keep track of our own accessor functions, but IIRC there was another issue asking for the same thing, it simplifies our code significantly, and it seems like it could be useful if dimensions are able to provide access to their accessor function after they were initially created.\n. You're right of course. I had a brain malfunction. It wouldn't break the dimension if you override the `paymentsByTotal.accessor` attribute. So I think you're right that this doesn't provide an advantage over just adding `accessor: value` to the returned object.\n\nYour example with an externally named accessor function is exactly what we were doing until we added the dimension accessor function in this pull request. It just becomes a pain to always pass around the dimension object and the accessor function together, when you know that function is in the object :-)\n. Sorry, this pull request is based on the 1.2 version. If that's a problem, I'll look into updating. We haven't tested our application with the 1.3.x versions yet.\n. @RandomEtc Thanks very much for taking a look. I will update to 1.3.x.\n. Update to current master branch complete.\n. You can certainly calculate averages using the custom reducer. Not sure how that would differ from moving averages? Not to speak for them, but in the past I believe the Crossfilter maintainers have said that specialized custom reducers should be maintained as separate projects and not baked into Crossfilter itself.\n. I see. You need to use the groupAll functionality to do this. It takes\narguments similar to reduce, but the functions are passed and must return\nall the groups. This allows you to do groupings where a single record is\nrelevant to multiple groups, like a moving average.\nhttps://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#dimension_groupAll\n\nOn Fri, Jan 23, 2015 at 7:51 PM, Jack Stouffer notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> According to http://stackoverflow.com/a/21707254/923933 moving averages\n> are not currently possible with the base api and would require new\n> functionality.\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/square/crossfilter/issues/100#issuecomment-71294904.\n. I've just updated reductio to support arbitrary aggregations across arbitrarily defined windows as well as multi-value classification scenarios. The example is just a count aggregation, but it should work with average and the move complex aggregations as well. If you'd like to try it out: https://github.com/esjewett/reductio#aggregations-groupall-aggregations\n. Glad it sort of worked. How many records of this form are we talking about? If in the 1000s or low 10000s, we can probably optimize. I'm not sure Reductio does this as efficiently as possible, so if you have a test dataset I can look at it. Probably best to discuss that over in the Reductio issues. Over the low 10000s or records, it might just not be manageable.\n. Are you within an order of magnitude on performance? If you switch your data to use strings for the date dimension instead of Date objects and optimize the Reductio groupAll function, that might buy you a 10x improvement.\n. Interesting idea. Any thoughts on how this API would look - or is work already being done here? I'd be interested in working on it, but conceptually not sure how it would fit in to the existing API (could you define which filterset applies to a given dimension?).\n. You'd need to maintain multiple independent pre-calculations of each group based on each filterset and each union/intersection/exclusion, no? Sounds very interesting. Is there a good place to start to hash this out? Wiki page?\n. Two thoughts:\n1. Have thought a bit about a 'filterSet' API. Seems it should be possible to maintain multiple named filter set and allow all methods such as .filter and .top to take an optional filter set argument. This could keep the API backwards compatible. However, after noodling on the internals a bit, it seems to me that groupings would have to be maintained and calculated for each new filter set. In other words, it would be fairly computationally expensive, wouldn't it? Anyway, I like the idea.\n2. The more I think about it, the more I think the concept of crossfilter.remove() should be fairly independent of the filter set concept. Wouldn't it be more intuitive and efficient if we could figure out a way for crossfilter.remove() to drop records independent of filters that are currently applied? In any case, I will experiment with whether this is possible in the current structure of Crossfilter. I think it should be, but not sure.\n\nRelated thought: Would a separate function dimension.remove() taking arguments identical to dimension.filter() make more sense and be more intuitive? Seems to me like anything changing the underlying data should be on the crossfilter object, but it's a thought.\n. I've made a commit on a fork that I think gets this working. I need to write more tests and better ensure that it works in conjunction with filters, but wanted to check in (if someone has the time to look at it) and see if I'm completely misunderstanding how something is working on the internals. Commit is here: https://github.com/esjewett/crossfilter/commit/09d5ac158f0fc1bb6498fb26d73b0ca0cccbd36b\n. @jasondavies I definitely hear you, and I think that the more general solution you describe could be really good - I just didn't have time to work on defining it at the moment. I'd still like to get to that. I just wanted to clarify that the change I made in the fork doesn't add another filter argument, unless I'm misunderstanding what that is, but rather removes records regardless of the filter currently in place.\n\nIt seems to me that this fits a lot of use cases (see below) better than the creation of a new filter, and perhaps even a new dimension to drive the removal of a small number of records. Personally, I'd see it as complementary to a more general solution around filtering. However, I may very well be miscalculating some of the performance impacts of what I'm doing :-) As mentioned above, I'm not super-familiar with the Crossfilter internals.\n\nSome scenarios:\n- removing a small number of records\n- removing data that is pushed \"off the end\" in a streaming data scenario\n- in-place updates to drive multi-dimensional exploration of data sets too large for the browser (the use case driving my exploration here)\n. @amergin I'd recommend sticking with the standard Crossfilter rather than my exploratory fork where possible. Currently in [Palladio](http://hdlab.stanford.edu/projects/palladio/) we are using a private fork of Crossfilter with a couple of tweaks but will be switching back to the standard Crossfilter soon. It's a really solid library, and it's just so much easier not to have to worry about maintaining a change to it.\n. Fair enough.\n\nWRT to the more general solution, I was thinking of creating an optional 'filterSet' concept. Filters would, by default, belong to a default filterSet, but all functions based on filters could take an optional (n+1)th argument. So, dimension.filterExact(value, [filterSet]), dimension.filterAll([filterSet]), dimension.top(number, [filterSet]), group.all([filterSet]), crossfilter.remove([filterSet]). There would also need to be utility functions to create new named filterSets based on the union & intersection of existing filterSets. This would leave the existing API completely unchanged, but would require keeping track of a map of named filterSets, maintaining a separate filter array for each filterSet, and maintaining (and calculating) additional group values for each filterSet. Thoughts? Am I missing something? I was planning to get into implementing this later this year, but might as well start bouncing the idea around now, I guess.\n\nI think this would leave an open question as to whether to allow crossfilter.remove([filterFunction]). The question being if it allows a significant efficiency gain over scenarios where a new dimension and/or filterSet would need to be created to drive removal of records, and then subsequently destroyed.\n. I always push the wrong button :-/ Just wanted to clarify that there is no open PR currently. If we get the go-ahead, I'll put one together as soon as possible. Thanks!\n. @RandomEtc Correct indeed. The pull request is a work-in-progress unfortunately, but I'll be taking another stab at it soon, with a little more knowledge of the CF internals. Thanks!\n. I hope this comment doesn't re-open the issue. If it does, my apologies.\n\nIn any case, as part of a project I've been working on we have developed a bunch of different 'helper' functions. I'm looking at releasing these, but I'm trying to determine the best way to do this. I'm thinking of releasing it as a set of functions that take a group as an argument and modify the group by calling \"reduce(...)\" with various, often very complex, arguments. Does that sound reasonable?\n. @gordonwoodhull I've got to figure that out. I was thinking something like\n\n```\nvar group = crossfilter.dimension(...).group();\nvar helper = cfhelpers.avg(function (d) { return d.total; })\n    .order(...)\n    .group(group);\nhelper.top(10);\n```\n\n'helper' would expose the Crossfilter group API.\n\nRegarding making it part of dc-js, I think it probably makes the most sense to keep it separate as this kind of library of Crossfilter reducers would be really helpful in a lot of contexts. Of course, the first step is just to do it.\n. Here's a very basic start: https://github.com/esjewett/reductio\n\nIt only supports count, sum, and average at the moment, but it's easily extensible, and reducers are additive and can depend on each other (for example, 'average' requires that 'count' and 'sum' are both applied to the group as well - it doesn't track it's own running count and sum). I need to do some more thinking on how to incorporate exception aggregation, but I plan to do that as well, at least in some form.\n\nFair warning: there is currently very little error checking and there has been precious little testing. It's a work in progress :-)\n\nI think it should be possible to more or less directly address the request in this issue by adding a getReduceArguments method to the reducer to return an array of three functions, then one could say something like:\n\n```\nvar reduceCountSumAverage = reductio().count(true).sum(function(d) { return d.bar; }).avg(true);\n\n// The following two lines are equivalent.\ngroup.reduce.apply(reduceCountSumAverage.getReduceArguments());\nreduceCountSumAverage(group);\n```\n. It's not quite clear to me what you want the output of this function to be, but I do wonder if this is possible as a set of custom reduce functions rather than as a modification to Crossfilter itself. From your pull request, it looks like it should definitely be possible.\n. I don't see the description. I wonder - does it produce similar results to this? https://github.com/esjewett/reductio#aggregations-standard-aggregations-exception-aggregation\n. Scrolling through the changes in the pull request, I don't see any comment. Did you push it?\n\nThat said, if you just need support for multiple keys, you could have the Reductio exception accessor return a string concatenating the keys using a separator you know doesn't appear in either of them. I'll look into directly supporting the multiple key scenario though, as it is a useful one.\n. I see, interesting and useful. I'll think about adding that capability of arbitrary reduce methods to Reductio's exception aggregation capability.\n. I think the only way to do this would be to check every time the dimension accessor is evaluated, which happens a lot. Would result in some % slowdown, which could be evaluated using the performance tests. IMO, this is a rough edge, but performance is really paramount in a lot of use-cases.\n. Just for clarity, I'll point out that this is exactly the behavior to expect based on the documentation at https://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#dimension\n\nSpecifically, if we go into a console and do some experimentation, we'll see that the values \"A\" and 1 don't behave properly with respect to the Javascript inequality operators. \"A\" < 1 is false, \"A\" > 1 is false, and \"A\" == 1 is false. That's not a consistent result. However, in the case of strings \"A\" < \"1\"  is false, \"A\" > \"1\" is true, and \"A\" == \"1\" is false. That's consistent, which is why it works. Meanwhile, null < null is false, null > null is false, and null === null is true. That's consistent, meaning we should properly see a null group.\n\nIn general, the rule of thumb is that if you are not confident that all of your data will have a predictable dimension value (and really, are we ever confident of this?), then you need to coerce your dimension accessor return value like so:\n\n```\nvar stringDim = xfilter.dimension(function(d) { return \"\" + d.value; });\nvar numDim = xfilter.dimension(function(d) { return +d.value; });\nvar boolDim = xfilter.dimension(function(d) { return d ? true : false; });\n```\n\nIf we do this, we should never run into this problem. I've gotten tripped up by this plenty of times, but have managed to teach myself that I've always always got to coerce types like this. But Crossfilter can't really do it for us because there is no way for Crossfilter to know what data type the dimension should have. I'm thinking about how I might be able to add something like this to the Reductio API.\n. @wssbck Actually, I was a little too optimistic with my number coercion example. You need to account for null, undefined, and NaN if you want to cover all the JS non-value values (at least that I'm aware of), none of which are naturally ordered in the context of String or Number type data sets. Get this:\n\n``` console\n> +null\n< 0\n> +undefined\n< NaN\n> null == undefined\n< true\n> +null == +undefined\n< false\n```\n\nJavascript is amazing :-/\n. For Reductio, I am considering adding some dimension-building capability. In that functionality, I will probably implement checks on dimension accessor functions to address this sort of issue. I'm thinking that at the time the accessor function is provided, I will check that it always returns naturally ordered values for a variety of data types including null, and throw a warning if it does not. This would notify people of possible issues while not forcing those who are sure that their data will be naturally ordered to carry a performance penalty.\n\nTheoretically this kind of test could be added to `crossfilter.dimension(value)` without a performance penalty because the provided function would be behaviorally tested when crossfilter.dimension is evaluated, not when `value` is evaluated. Basically, put this in the crossfilter.dimension function:\n\n```\nfunction dimension(value) {\n  // ...\n  var testResults = [ null, 1, 'test' ].map(function(d) {\n    return typeof value(d);\n  });\n  if( !(testResults[0] === testResults[1] && testResults[1] === testResults[2]) ) {\n    console.warn(\"Dimension accessor returns values that may not be naturally ordered.\");\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n```\n. Hi @RandomEtc and all. Thanks for discussing this.

I'd be up for helping maintain a dc.js organization fork or another fork - whatever is agreed.\n. @RandomEtc Thanks for closing the loop and the feedback. We're still getting things together and moving a bit slowly, but I've gone through and tried to update all the documents in the main repo and gh-pages to remove Square branding and \"point-of-view\" except for the copyright notices.

So, I think it may be a slow process to rename. We'll talk about it and figure something out!\n\nThanks again for your understanding and guidance with this.\n. @dderiso I'd say that https://github.com/crossfilter/crossfilter is open to pull requests and issues. Probably best to first open an issue to discuss as we only want to make changes that are really required in the core library. We are working very slowly though. It's probably quite premature to say that it is _the_ home for community development as that's the kind of thing I'd prefer to show rather than say, and I don't think we've shown that yet.\n. Sorry, got bitten by the Github fork/original pull request defaults :-/\n. Didn't see this and I think I've basically duplicated it in #92 . However, correct me if I'm wrong, but does this solution properly calculate a maximum if a group is created on a crossfilter that already has filters applied? I don't think so, but I'm not sure.\n. I see. Yes, that is a different use-case - finding filtered max/min vs my need in #92 for finding unfiltered max/min for new groups after a filter has already been applied.\n. I'd really like to see this functionality added one way or another. We're using CrossFilter to back a browser based visualization application that works on arbitrary data sets and it would be nice to be able to be more generous to users with regards to the number of dimensions that can be created when using certain visualization components that require large numbers of dimensions.\n. Sorry, don't mean to pester, but I'm not sure what the correct approach is here. We're making some additions to Crossfilter and I'm creating pull requests when it seems to make sense to push those changes upstream, but so far have not seen any response on either pull request. Is there a different way to get changes evaluated for addition to this repository?\n\nThanks, and again, sorry to bother.\n. Cool, glad this is the right approach :-) I know it's not personal, but also wasn't sure what the standard procedure was. Thanks! I will ping on my other pull request as well.\n\nRegarding your question: I didn't want to return `value` on it's own because if someone assigned something else to it (`dimension.accessor = 1`), then the entire dimension would go haywire. I figured it was safer to provide a function that takes a record `d` as input and returns the result of the `value(d)` function.\n\nThis change isn't strictly necessary, as we can keep track of our own accessor functions, but IIRC there was another issue asking for the same thing, it simplifies our code significantly, and it seems like it could be useful if dimensions are able to provide access to their accessor function after they were initially created.\n. You're right of course. I had a brain malfunction. It wouldn't break the dimension if you override the `paymentsByTotal.accessor` attribute. So I think you're right that this doesn't provide an advantage over just adding `accessor: value` to the returned object.\n\nYour example with an externally named accessor function is exactly what we were doing until we added the dimension accessor function in this pull request. It just becomes a pain to always pass around the dimension object and the accessor function together, when you know that function is in the object :-)\n. Sorry, this pull request is based on the 1.2 version. If that's a problem, I'll look into updating. We haven't tested our application with the 1.3.x versions yet.\n. @RandomEtc Thanks very much for taking a look. I will update to 1.3.x.\n. Update to current master branch complete.\n. You can certainly calculate averages using the custom reducer. Not sure how that would differ from moving averages? Not to speak for them, but in the past I believe the Crossfilter maintainers have said that specialized custom reducers should be maintained as separate projects and not baked into Crossfilter itself.\n. I see. You need to use the groupAll functionality to do this. It takes\narguments similar to reduce, but the functions are passed and must return\nall the groups. This allows you to do groupings where a single record is\nrelevant to multiple groups, like a moving average.\nhttps://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#dimension_groupAll\n\nOn Fri, Jan 23, 2015 at 7:51 PM, Jack Stouffer notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> According to http://stackoverflow.com/a/21707254/923933 moving averages\n> are not currently possible with the base api and would require new\n> functionality.\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/square/crossfilter/issues/100#issuecomment-71294904.\n. I've just updated reductio to support arbitrary aggregations across arbitrarily defined windows as well as multi-value classification scenarios. The example is just a count aggregation, but it should work with average and the move complex aggregations as well. If you'd like to try it out: https://github.com/esjewett/reductio#aggregations-groupall-aggregations\n. Glad it sort of worked. How many records of this form are we talking about? If in the 1000s or low 10000s, we can probably optimize. I'm not sure Reductio does this as efficiently as possible, so if you have a test dataset I can look at it. Probably best to discuss that over in the Reductio issues. Over the low 10000s or records, it might just not be manageable.\n. Are you within an order of magnitude on performance? If you switch your data to use strings for the date dimension instead of Date objects and optimize the Reductio groupAll function, that might buy you a 10x improvement.\n. Interesting idea. Any thoughts on how this API would look - or is work already being done here? I'd be interested in working on it, but conceptually not sure how it would fit in to the existing API (could you define which filterset applies to a given dimension?).\n. You'd need to maintain multiple independent pre-calculations of each group based on each filterset and each union/intersection/exclusion, no? Sounds very interesting. Is there a good place to start to hash this out? Wiki page?\n. Two thoughts:\n1. Have thought a bit about a 'filterSet' API. Seems it should be possible to maintain multiple named filter set and allow all methods such as .filter and .top to take an optional filter set argument. This could keep the API backwards compatible. However, after noodling on the internals a bit, it seems to me that groupings would have to be maintained and calculated for each new filter set. In other words, it would be fairly computationally expensive, wouldn't it? Anyway, I like the idea.\n2. The more I think about it, the more I think the concept of crossfilter.remove() should be fairly independent of the filter set concept. Wouldn't it be more intuitive and efficient if we could figure out a way for crossfilter.remove() to drop records independent of filters that are currently applied? In any case, I will experiment with whether this is possible in the current structure of Crossfilter. I think it should be, but not sure.\n\nRelated thought: Would a separate function dimension.remove() taking arguments identical to dimension.filter() make more sense and be more intuitive? Seems to me like anything changing the underlying data should be on the crossfilter object, but it's a thought.\n. I've made a commit on a fork that I think gets this working. I need to write more tests and better ensure that it works in conjunction with filters, but wanted to check in (if someone has the time to look at it) and see if I'm completely misunderstanding how something is working on the internals. Commit is here: https://github.com/esjewett/crossfilter/commit/09d5ac158f0fc1bb6498fb26d73b0ca0cccbd36b\n. @jasondavies I definitely hear you, and I think that the more general solution you describe could be really good - I just didn't have time to work on defining it at the moment. I'd still like to get to that. I just wanted to clarify that the change I made in the fork doesn't add another filter argument, unless I'm misunderstanding what that is, but rather removes records regardless of the filter currently in place.\n\nIt seems to me that this fits a lot of use cases (see below) better than the creation of a new filter, and perhaps even a new dimension to drive the removal of a small number of records. Personally, I'd see it as complementary to a more general solution around filtering. However, I may very well be miscalculating some of the performance impacts of what I'm doing :-) As mentioned above, I'm not super-familiar with the Crossfilter internals.\n\nSome scenarios:\n- removing a small number of records\n- removing data that is pushed \"off the end\" in a streaming data scenario\n- in-place updates to drive multi-dimensional exploration of data sets too large for the browser (the use case driving my exploration here)\n. @amergin I'd recommend sticking with the standard Crossfilter rather than my exploratory fork where possible. Currently in [Palladio](http://hdlab.stanford.edu/projects/palladio/) we are using a private fork of Crossfilter with a couple of tweaks but will be switching back to the standard Crossfilter soon. It's a really solid library, and it's just so much easier not to have to worry about maintaining a change to it.\n. Fair enough.\n\nWRT to the more general solution, I was thinking of creating an optional 'filterSet' concept. Filters would, by default, belong to a default filterSet, but all functions based on filters could take an optional (n+1)th argument. So, dimension.filterExact(value, [filterSet]), dimension.filterAll([filterSet]), dimension.top(number, [filterSet]), group.all([filterSet]), crossfilter.remove([filterSet]). There would also need to be utility functions to create new named filterSets based on the union & intersection of existing filterSets. This would leave the existing API completely unchanged, but would require keeping track of a map of named filterSets, maintaining a separate filter array for each filterSet, and maintaining (and calculating) additional group values for each filterSet. Thoughts? Am I missing something? I was planning to get into implementing this later this year, but might as well start bouncing the idea around now, I guess.\n\nI think this would leave an open question as to whether to allow crossfilter.remove([filterFunction]). The question being if it allows a significant efficiency gain over scenarios where a new dimension and/or filterSet would need to be created to drive removal of records, and then subsequently destroyed.\n. I always push the wrong button :-/ Just wanted to clarify that there is no open PR currently. If we get the go-ahead, I'll put one together as soon as possible. Thanks!\n. @RandomEtc Correct indeed. The pull request is a work-in-progress unfortunately, but I'll be taking another stab at it soon, with a little more knowledge of the CF internals. Thanks!\n. I hope this comment doesn't re-open the issue. If it does, my apologies.\n\nIn any case, as part of a project I've been working on we have developed a bunch of different 'helper' functions. I'm looking at releasing these, but I'm trying to determine the best way to do this. I'm thinking of releasing it as a set of functions that take a group as an argument and modify the group by calling \"reduce(...)\" with various, often very complex, arguments. Does that sound reasonable?\n. @gordonwoodhull I've got to figure that out. I was thinking something like\n\n```\nvar group = crossfilter.dimension(...).group();\nvar helper = cfhelpers.avg(function (d) { return d.total; })\n    .order(...)\n    .group(group);\nhelper.top(10);\n```\n\n'helper' would expose the Crossfilter group API.\n\nRegarding making it part of dc-js, I think it probably makes the most sense to keep it separate as this kind of library of Crossfilter reducers would be really helpful in a lot of contexts. Of course, the first step is just to do it.\n. Here's a very basic start: https://github.com/esjewett/reductio\n\nIt only supports count, sum, and average at the moment, but it's easily extensible, and reducers are additive and can depend on each other (for example, 'average' requires that 'count' and 'sum' are both applied to the group as well - it doesn't track it's own running count and sum). I need to do some more thinking on how to incorporate exception aggregation, but I plan to do that as well, at least in some form.\n\nFair warning: there is currently very little error checking and there has been precious little testing. It's a work in progress :-)\n\nI think it should be possible to more or less directly address the request in this issue by adding a getReduceArguments method to the reducer to return an array of three functions, then one could say something like:\n\n```\nvar reduceCountSumAverage = reductio().count(true).sum(function(d) { return d.bar; }).avg(true);\n\n// The following two lines are equivalent.\ngroup.reduce.apply(reduceCountSumAverage.getReduceArguments());\nreduceCountSumAverage(group);\n```\n. It's not quite clear to me what you want the output of this function to be, but I do wonder if this is possible as a set of custom reduce functions rather than as a modification to Crossfilter itself. From your pull request, it looks like it should definitely be possible.\n. I don't see the description. I wonder - does it produce similar results to this? https://github.com/esjewett/reductio#aggregations-standard-aggregations-exception-aggregation\n. Scrolling through the changes in the pull request, I don't see any comment. Did you push it?\n\nThat said, if you just need support for multiple keys, you could have the Reductio exception accessor return a string concatenating the keys using a separator you know doesn't appear in either of them. I'll look into directly supporting the multiple key scenario though, as it is a useful one.\n. I see, interesting and useful. I'll think about adding that capability of arbitrary reduce methods to Reductio's exception aggregation capability.\n. I think the only way to do this would be to check every time the dimension accessor is evaluated, which happens a lot. Would result in some % slowdown, which could be evaluated using the performance tests. IMO, this is a rough edge, but performance is really paramount in a lot of use-cases.\n. Just for clarity, I'll point out that this is exactly the behavior to expect based on the documentation at https://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#dimension\n\nSpecifically, if we go into a console and do some experimentation, we'll see that the values \"A\" and 1 don't behave properly with respect to the Javascript inequality operators. \"A\" < 1 is false, \"A\" > 1 is false, and \"A\" == 1 is false. That's not a consistent result. However, in the case of strings \"A\" < \"1\"  is false, \"A\" > \"1\" is true, and \"A\" == \"1\" is false. That's consistent, which is why it works. Meanwhile, null < null is false, null > null is false, and null === null is true. That's consistent, meaning we should properly see a null group.\n\nIn general, the rule of thumb is that if you are not confident that all of your data will have a predictable dimension value (and really, are we ever confident of this?), then you need to coerce your dimension accessor return value like so:\n\n```\nvar stringDim = xfilter.dimension(function(d) { return \"\" + d.value; });\nvar numDim = xfilter.dimension(function(d) { return +d.value; });\nvar boolDim = xfilter.dimension(function(d) { return d ? true : false; });\n```\n\nIf we do this, we should never run into this problem. I've gotten tripped up by this plenty of times, but have managed to teach myself that I've always always got to coerce types like this. But Crossfilter can't really do it for us because there is no way for Crossfilter to know what data type the dimension should have. I'm thinking about how I might be able to add something like this to the Reductio API.\n. @wssbck Actually, I was a little too optimistic with my number coercion example. You need to account for null, undefined, and NaN if you want to cover all the JS non-value values (at least that I'm aware of), none of which are naturally ordered in the context of String or Number type data sets. Get this:\n\n``` console\n> +null\n< 0\n> +undefined\n< NaN\n> null == undefined\n< true\n> +null == +undefined\n< false\n```\n\nJavascript is amazing :-/\n. For Reductio, I am considering adding some dimension-building capability. In that functionality, I will probably implement checks on dimension accessor functions to address this sort of issue. I'm thinking that at the time the accessor function is provided, I will check that it always returns naturally ordered values for a variety of data types including null, and throw a warning if it does not. This would notify people of possible issues while not forcing those who are sure that their data will be naturally ordered to carry a performance penalty.\n\nTheoretically this kind of test could be added to `crossfilter.dimension(value)` without a performance penalty because the provided function would be behaviorally tested when crossfilter.dimension is evaluated, not when `value` is evaluated. Basically, put this in the crossfilter.dimension function:\n\n```\nfunction dimension(value) {\n  // ...\n  var testResults = [ null, 1, 'test' ].map(function(d) {\n    return typeof value(d);\n  });\n  if( !(testResults[0] === testResults[1] && testResults[1] === testResults[2]) ) {\n    console.warn(\"Dimension accessor returns values that may not be naturally ordered.\");\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n```\n.

But other than that, I think it's an okay solution to this problem.\n. @hariDasu, note that `NaN` here might not be the constant but any comparison between a number and, say, a string. \n\nI believe the problem arises because it is hard to sort values with the following semantics:\n\n```\n   1<'a'\n=> false\n   'a'<1\n=> false\n```\n\nTherefore your keys must be all numbers or all strings, and your reductions may produce only numbers. (If I understand correctly.)\n. Hi @jasondavies,\n\nOne problem with the string concatenation solution is that it's very messy to supply tuples that include numbers.  They have to be zero-padded.  I wonder if you would consider a PR for native support of tuple keys?\n. ```\ngordon$ cat commas\n1,1\n10,2\n2,3\n1,9\n11,15\ngordon$ sort commas\n1,1\n1,9\n10,2\n11,15\n2,3\n```\n.

Yes, that almost works, but for example, I would want to be able to select the range [1,1] -> [1,19], but without native support [1,2] would be left out.\n\nI think it boils down to parameterizing the ordering function.  So there wouldn't be any extra logic during sorting.  I would hope this isn't worse than the valueOf() call that is already happening, and you'd pay for what you need.  I can benchmark it and find out.  Thanks for considering it.\n. Ah, right.  Thanks, got it.  And it would be very unlikely that one would want to filter by e.g. range [1,10] -> [2,9]\n\nI will see if I can make some wrappers to hide the mess.\n. I happen to have written something like this. Where would be a good place to post it for review?\n. Sure, let me revise it a bit more and then I'll do that.\n\nI was hoping to get some feedback before posting, in case it's, you know, Wrong, but I guess a wiki can serve that purpose too. Maybe I'll post it to the d3 mailing list first.\n. Note that you need to guard against a divide by zero in `reduceRemove`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n    p.avg = p.count ? p.sum/p.count : 0;\r\n```\r\n. Thanks for the link, @jasondavies.  \n. I think second-order functions can help you out here.  Check out [the solution posted to the dc.js issue tracker for this issue](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/563#issuecomment-39503927).\n. @esjewett, this sounds really cool.  I don't know but it might be worth it to add another level of indirection, so that the helpers return functions which can then be applied to groups.. so that the helpers can themselves be reused.\n\nAny chance you'd like to contribute this to a new library on github.com/dc-js/?  I have been collecting examples of \"fake groups\" - a different kind of wrapper - and in the future I plan to create wrappers for pivots/series/etc.\n. Oh, that's neat to use the reusable chart pattern for configuring the helpers.  \n\nI meant, as part of a separate project hosted in the dc-js organization, not as part of the dc.js project itself.  But it doesn't really matter, the important thing is to actually release them!\n. Yep please file a dc.js issue. If you can repro in a jsFiddle that will be appreciated. Thanks!\n. @wssbck, you might look at the way Ethan Jewett's reductio library does this: by generating the helper function @jasondavies mentions.  https://github.com/esjewett/reductio\n. You might look at PourOver for more general boolean operations - my understanding is that the performance is nothing like crossfilter but it's more general.\n. Ref : #114\n. This is a feature, and documented.\n\n> Note: a grouping intersects the crossfilter's current filters, except for the associated dimension's filter. Thus, group methods consider only records that satisfy every filter except this dimension's filter. So, if the crossfilter of payments is filtered by type and total, then group by total only observes the filter by type.\n\nhttps://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#dimension_group\n\nIdea being that usually you don't want a chart's data to disappear when you are brushing that chart.\n\nThe standard workaround is to create an identical dimension and filter that one instead.\n. dc.js data tables do support groups as dimensions, pretty much by accident. (The coupling between dc.js and crossfilter is very light.)\n\nThere is a little bit of info here, and a link to a (complex) example, in this PR: https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/697. Please try it out and bring any issues to the appropriate dc forums.\n. @vmantese, if this works for you, you should close the ticket. It seems like more a dc.js (documentation) issue than crossfilter. \n. Does crossfilter have any bugs, besides people shooting themselves in the foot and getting stack overflows with NaNs? I think in a sense it is complete.\n\nI can't contribute due to the [copyright assignment agreement](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). That's something that creates a sea of red tape in corporations.\n. > Maybe moving crossfilter to an official organization so that there could be additional plugins brought into the official crossfilter ecosystem.\n\nAn organization would be sweet, with copyright staying with the contributors, as we have done with dc.js. The only reason for copyright assignment is to make it easier to change the copyright later, and that is unlikely to be needed with crossfilter. \n. @jefffriesen, has anyone built up the same cross filtering functionality on top of lodash? That would not be trivial but would indeed be interesting. \n. @RandomEtc I would say in many organizations it is only moderately difficult to get internal approval for contributing to a project under some well known open source license. \n\nBut it is near impossible to get approval to sign some other agreement that lawyers would have to read.\n\n(Spoken from my limited understanding of IP and organizations.)\n. Thanks for the update, @RandomEtc. Yes, dc-js could host crossfilter, but it might be more appropriate to put it in its own organization as @derekperkins suggested.\n\nSince the dependency is really the other way and lots of people use crossfilter without dc.js. \n\nEither way I'll be glad to help maintain it, as long as there are few other maintainers and no contributor agreement.\n. Thanks @RandomEtc! \n\nThere is a wealth of information in the issues on this repo, so let's link back here when we continue these conversations. Looking forward to continuing the amazing work done here!\n. Groups don't observe the filters on their own dimension. This is by design: usually you only want the _other_ charts to change when you filter on one.\n\nFrom the documentation:\n\n> Note: a grouping intersects the crossfilter's current filters, except for the associated dimension's filter. Thus, group methods consider only records that satisfy every filter except this dimension's filter. So, if the crossfilter of payments is filtered by type and total, then group by total only observes the filter by type.\n\nhttps://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#dimension_group\n\nThe workaround if you want a group that observes its own dimension, is to create two identical dimensions, and apply the filter to the other copy of the dimension.\n. You can create a dimension which uses multiple fields in its key, as described in #48, but I think you'd have trouble getting the sorting right, unless you're willing to zero-pad your numbers.\n\nSince the strength of crossfilter is really in speedy filtering, you might be better off just defining your dimensions based on the filtering needs, and then post-process the group output to get the right sorting order.\n. There is a `dimension.bottom()` function, but there is no `dimension.order()` function - could it be that `.order()` is the problem? \n\nOr, more likely, could it be that you have a group object, which supports `group.order()` group but not `group.bottom()?\n. Stack Overflow is a better place for asking support questions. \n\nBut yes, you can use data like this. Just supply an array of indices as your data to crossfilter. Then write your dimension and group accessors to use the index to fetch data from the original arrays.\n\nSomething like:\n\n``` js\nvar N = data.timestamp.length;\nvar r = _.range(N); // [0,1,2,...,N-1]\nvar ndx = crossfilter(r);\nvar V1dim = ndx.dimension(function(d) { return data.V1[d]; });\nvar sumV2perV1 = V1dim.group().reduceSum(function(d) { return data.V2[d];});\n```\n\nDownside is that you won't find a lot of examples of people using crossfilter this way, so you'll have to translate everything. It might be easier to send your data over the wire as object of arrays, and then rotate it into an array of objects in JavaScript, and probably not too expensive unless your data is huge.\n. Hi @ebookoos, this sounds like more of a support question, and maybe more to do with dc.js than crossfilter. So you should probably ask [on Stack Overflow](stackoverflow.com) with the dc.js tag, or [on the dc.js user group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/dc-js-user-group).\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm not sure what \"foreach function\" you're referring to or what explanation of filtering and grouping for data tables, so when you post in one of those places, could you please expand your question and provide links?. I provided an example here, which keeps a list of rows for each bin and then can compute min/max/median:\nhttp://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/examples/complex-reduce.html\n\nSource here:\nhttps://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/blob/develop/web/examples/complex-reduce.html\n\nIt would be more efficient if crossfilter provided access to the underlying rows for each bin, instead of having to track those externally. But other than that, I think it's an okay solution to this problem.\n. @hariDasu, note that `NaN` here might not be the constant but any comparison between a number and, say, a string. \n\nI believe the problem arises because it is hard to sort values with the following semantics:\n\n```\n   1<'a'\n=> false\n   'a'<1\n=> false\n```\n\nTherefore your keys must be all numbers or all strings, and your reductions may produce only numbers. (If I understand correctly.)\n. Hi @jasondavies,\n\nOne problem with the string concatenation solution is that it's very messy to supply tuples that include numbers.  They have to be zero-padded.  I wonder if you would consider a PR for native support of tuple keys?\n. ```\ngordon$ cat commas\n1,1\n10,2\n2,3\n1,9\n11,15\ngordon$ sort commas\n1,1\n1,9\n10,2\n11,15\n2,3\n```\n. Similar problem if the character code is greater than digits:\n\n```\ngordon$ cat bars\n1|1\n10|2\n2|3\n1|9\n11|15\n1|11\n10|1\n11|1\n11|2\ngordon$ sort bars\n10|1\n10|2\n11|1\n11|15\n11|2\n1|1\n1|11\n1|9\n2|3\n```\n\nI could be wrong, but I don't think lexicographical ordering ever works for tuples of variable length fields.\n. Yes, that almost works, but for example, I would want to be able to select the range [1,1] -> [1,19], but without native support [1,2] would be left out.\n\nI think it boils down to parameterizing the ordering function.  So there wouldn't be any extra logic during sorting.  I would hope this isn't worse than the valueOf() call that is already happening, and you'd pay for what you need.  I can benchmark it and find out.  Thanks for considering it.\n. Ah, right.  Thanks, got it.  And it would be very unlikely that one would want to filter by e.g. range [1,10] -> [2,9]\n\nI will see if I can make some wrappers to hide the mess.\n. I happen to have written something like this. Where would be a good place to post it for review?\n. Sure, let me revise it a bit more and then I'll do that.\n\nI was hoping to get some feedback before posting, in case it's, you know, Wrong, but I guess a wiki can serve that purpose too. Maybe I'll post it to the d3 mailing list first.\n. Note that you need to guard against a divide by zero in `reduceRemove`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n    p.avg = p.count ? p.sum/p.count : 0;\r\n```\r\n. Thanks for the link, @jasondavies.  \n. I think second-order functions can help you out here.  Check out [the solution posted to the dc.js issue tracker for this issue](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/563#issuecomment-39503927).\n. @esjewett, this sounds really cool.  I don't know but it might be worth it to add another level of indirection, so that the helpers return functions which can then be applied to groups.. so that the helpers can themselves be reused.\n\nAny chance you'd like to contribute this to a new library on github.com/dc-js/?  I have been collecting examples of \"fake groups\" - a different kind of wrapper - and in the future I plan to create wrappers for pivots/series/etc.\n. Oh, that's neat to use the reusable chart pattern for configuring the helpers.  \n\nI meant, as part of a separate project hosted in the dc-js organization, not as part of the dc.js project itself.  But it doesn't really matter, the important thing is to actually release them!\n. Yep please file a dc.js issue. If you can repro in a jsFiddle that will be appreciated. Thanks!\n. @wssbck, you might look at the way Ethan Jewett's reductio library does this: by generating the helper function @jasondavies mentions.  https://github.com/esjewett/reductio\n. You might look at PourOver for more general boolean operations - my understanding is that the performance is nothing like crossfilter but it's more general.\n. Ref : #114\n. This is a feature, and documented.\n\n> Note: a grouping intersects the crossfilter's current filters, except for the associated dimension's filter. Thus, group methods consider only records that satisfy every filter except this dimension's filter. So, if the crossfilter of payments is filtered by type and total, then group by total only observes the filter by type.\n\nhttps://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#dimension_group\n\nIdea being that usually you don't want a chart's data to disappear when you are brushing that chart.\n\nThe standard workaround is to create an identical dimension and filter that one instead.\n. dc.js data tables do support groups as dimensions, pretty much by accident. (The coupling between dc.js and crossfilter is very light.)\n\nThere is a little bit of info here, and a link to a (complex) example, in this PR: https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/pull/697. Please try it out and bring any issues to the appropriate dc forums.\n. @vmantese, if this works for you, you should close the ticket. It seems like more a dc.js (documentation) issue than crossfilter. \n. Does crossfilter have any bugs, besides people shooting themselves in the foot and getting stack overflows with NaNs? I think in a sense it is complete.\n\nI can't contribute due to the [copyright assignment agreement](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). That's something that creates a sea of red tape in corporations.\n. > Maybe moving crossfilter to an official organization so that there could be additional plugins brought into the official crossfilter ecosystem.\n\nAn organization would be sweet, with copyright staying with the contributors, as we have done with dc.js. The only reason for copyright assignment is to make it easier to change the copyright later, and that is unlikely to be needed with crossfilter. \n. @jefffriesen, has anyone built up the same cross filtering functionality on top of lodash? That would not be trivial but would indeed be interesting. \n. @RandomEtc I would say in many organizations it is only moderately difficult to get internal approval for contributing to a project under some well known open source license. \n\nBut it is near impossible to get approval to sign some other agreement that lawyers would have to read.\n\n(Spoken from my limited understanding of IP and organizations.)\n. Thanks for the update, @RandomEtc. Yes, dc-js could host crossfilter, but it might be more appropriate to put it in its own organization as @derekperkins suggested.\n\nSince the dependency is really the other way and lots of people use crossfilter without dc.js. \n\nEither way I'll be glad to help maintain it, as long as there are few other maintainers and no contributor agreement.\n.

I figured out my problem.\nIt was some of my code altering the result of .all() on a group because all() doesn't return a copy.\nFixed with a .slice(0) on the return.\nSo:\n\n``` javascript\nvar cf = crossfilter(myData)\n  , d1 = cf.dimension(function(d){return d.key1})\n  , d2 = cf.dimension(function(d){return d.key2})\n  , g1 = d1.group()\n  , g2 = d2.group()\n  , x = g.all()\n  , s = []\n\nwhile(x.length) s.push(x.shift())\n\npg = cf.pivotGroup([g1,g2]) // Error should occur here\n\n```\n\nThat is just an example to expose what is happening. It doesn't do anything interesting.\n. Use cross filter pull request https://github.com/square/crossfilter/pull/33  \n\nSupports filter unions.\n\nFor more specific needs, use https://github.com/square/crossfilter/pull/36\n\nThat supports custom filter functions.  \n.

Has there been any more traction on this?  We are in love with crossfilter, but would like the ability for 32 + dimensions.  I realize this would come with performance hits, but all in all, if someone really wants to have that many dimension open, and filtering on those dimensions, I'm sure they would understand that performance will be affected.\n\nIs @sciyoshi 's PR functional? Has anyone tested it as of late?\n. This specific issue I had, was I was able to build more than 32 dimensions at one time, and that's great but as soon as I started filtering on those dimensions the add and remove functions for grouping were in accurate\n. Could i get a href to the latest patch? I think I was using an older version on my test \n. I think the use case for `removeFilter` is much needed.  We need to be able to fluidly add and flush rows of data from a crossfilter with ease.  The add functionality is there, but a better option than removing what is currently filtered on is much needed.\n. I agree.  Over at http://github.com/crossfilter/crossfilter (the successor to this repo), we already have some amazing new features, and are discussing some great new docs, a learning playground, and even more revolutionary features you'll want to look at over the next few weeks.  Stay tuned!\n. Not that it has bugs, or that it is incomplete. But there are some features\nthat have yet to be created for it. Simply we just want to make sure it's\ngetting the attention it deserves.

The issue is present when a dimension contains values of different types, not only when nulls are returned from the dimension's accessor. However, not always. In the above example:\n1. Change null to 1. The result is the same.\n2. Change it to '1' - all dimension values are strings and reduction values are correct.\n3. Change all values to nulls - surprisingly, there is now a group with null key, correctly reduced to 6.\n\nI could not trace the cause in the code, hopefully I will be able to report more later.\n. @esjewett explains it all. I would still argue null should have a special place in Crossfilter but this is a subject for another issue I guess.\n. @esjewett Yes, it is easy to get lost in how JS handles implicit type conversion and extraordinary values and types :-) I will try to find time to open a pull request or at least an issue discussing the treatment of null, specifically, as it is a very useful construct.\n. I have spent a bit of time looking into how to deal with the issue. Solving it on the Crossfilter level would be too intrusive as core sorting functions of the library would have to be modified.\n\nAt the same time it would be great to have null recognized as a special, separate value. Null is neither 0 nor an empty string. While 0 or empty string are completely legitimate data values that can come from measurements, null is useful for designating entries which are problematic for some reason. For example, the data may be incomplete or impossible to obtain.\n\nAggregation functions can be made null-aware, skipping (or processing differently) rows containing nulls. The only thing we need is a correct accessor function for a given dimension:\n\n``` javascript\nvar data = [\n    {score: 100, name: 'A'},\n    {score: 200, name: 'B'},\n    {score: 110, name: 'A'},\n    {score: 43,  name: null},\n    {score: 100, name: 'B'},\n    {score: 100, name: 'A'}\n];\n\nvar all = crossfilter(data).dimension(\n    function(v){\n        var ret = v.name === null ? '__null__' : v.name;\n        return ret;\n    }\n).group().all();\n\nconsole.log(all);\n```\n\nThe result:\n\n``` javascript\n[ { key: 'A', value: 3 },\n  { key: 'B', value: 2 },\n  { key: '__null__', value: 2 } ]\n```\n\nWhat is nice about this approach is that aggregation functions are still going to have the whole original data row passed as parameters, so they can react to nulls the way we want.\n\nFor dimensions with numerical values we could use Infinity or -Inifity to keep the values returned in the accessor well behaving when it comes to > and <:\n\n``` javascript\n    function(v){\n        var ret = v.name === null ? Infinity : v.name;\n        return ret;\n    }\n```\n\nOf course, this approach does not deal with every possible \"dirty\" value in JS but we should not throw low quality data at Crossfilter. Turning all questionable entries into nulls and then dealing with them on the accessor/reduction level is IMHO a good step in the process.\n. @RandomEtc Out of curiosity - can you share some details as to why you moved dashboard aggregations to the backend?

Is it correct to summarize this as Crossfilter's home for active community development is now: https://github.com/crossfilter/crossfilter ? If so, it might be good to put a note on the readme of this repo so devs know where to submit pull requests. Thanks again for everything, love this library.\n. ",

    "ronakrrb": "Actually, the project i am working on is very data heavy. So, we are trying to reduce as many iterations as possible. With the .map() approach comes additional iteration. \nAlso, the number of aggregation function may be sometimes just 1 and sometimes more than one. Hence, we will have to add a check whether the value attribute is a primitive value or an object. To avoid such processing, how can we modify the API to return single level object instead of nested?\n. Interesting. I will probably have to check if i can modify the internals as this is gonna be a dynamic feature to the user whether to specify 1 or multiple aggregations. Thanks\n.
