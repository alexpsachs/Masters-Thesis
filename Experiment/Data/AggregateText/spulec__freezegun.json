    "spulec": "I applaud the effort, but no.\n. Thanks for reporting this Neal!\n. Oops, silly mistake. Forgot datetime needed to be a subclass of date. Fixed and pushed a new version to PyPI.\n. I put in a quick fix that will make addition and subtraction work. I'll go back at some point and reconsider other operators. If you find any, please reopen this ticket or open another ticket.\n. This was also fixed by https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/commit/0453e5f47efd1d0d79af973e5ddcf9fa83b2ca40\n. Ah, you are correct. It looks like I fixed `now()`, but not `utcnow()`. Fixed with https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/commit/768a60f453c70517b6191fb9df29cd4ff8e78d7f and added tests. Going to push a new release in a minute.\n. Also, thanks!\n. I believe that's the same issue as #30 \n. The lines `assert not isinstance(now, FakeDatetime)` and `assert not isinstance(now, FakeDate)` are not expected to pass. Once freeze_time is imported, all datetime/date instances will be instances of FakeDatetime/FakeDate and all references to datetime.datetime/datetime.date will actually be references to the classes FakeDatetime/FakeDate.\n\nThe thought is that this will all go on transparently behind the scenes and people will be able to just think of it all as datetime.datetime. Feel free to reopen if this is somehow causing issues in your test writing.\n. Hi there,\n\nThanks so much for taking the time to do this and apologies for the delay in responding.\n\nThis looks great, but I have one or two concerns. If you have time to discuss/fix, great. Otherwise, I can pull the request in and make the changes myself.\n\nIf we're going to add support for the time module, we need to support all of the methods (time.clock(), time.timezone, etc). I don't want people to see the time module being mocked and assume incorrectly that all of the methods are mocked.\n\nSecond item is that we need to add some docs.\n\nTo reiterate, if you have some more time to work on this, great. Otherwise, I'll take the great start you've given me and run with it.\n. Heh, yeah I haven't done any work on this.\n\nI agree with your comments.\n\nMake the changes and we can close this out. Also note that we are now python 3 compatible. Not sure if that changes any of your existing code.\n. Hi Dan,\n\nThanks a lot for taking the time to report this.\n\nI'm not exactly excited that we have to special case timedeltas like this. I think it might be a little cleaner if we flipped it and did something like\n\n``` python\nif isinstance(result, real_datetime):\n    return date_to_fakedate(result)\nelse:\n    return result\n```\n\nIt seems to be more explicit about what our intentions really are.\n\nThoughts?\n. Thanks Dan!\n. Hi Hannes. I really like the idea, but don't think there is an easy way to do this with how the code is setup. One thing you can do is\n\n``` python\nfrom freezegun.api import FakeDatetime\nnow = datetime.datetime.now()\nassert isinstance(now, FakeDatetime)\n```\n\nIf you can think of an easy way to do this, please reopen this issue because I would love to have it.\n. Hi Chris. I have just pushed version 0.0.9 that should fix your problem. Feel free to reopen this issue with the failing code if it still doesn't work.\n\nGlad to head you like it!\n. now() not accepting timezones is definitely a bug and should be fixed.\n\nI'm not able to recreate the django saving bug though. isinstance() checks should all pass for the current version of freezegun.\n. That would be great. Thanks.\n. I think that a lot of these issues should be fixed in the newest release. Freezegun now only mocks datetime/date when activated. I haven't actually tested with django yet though.\n. I think this should all be fixed with the latest release.\n. Yes, unfortunately that library imports datetime classes instead of just the datetime module. One workaround is to import freezegun before importing anything django. Sorry that there's not currently a better answer.\n. This should be fixed in the newest release due to https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/commit/a9cc66ce1f6c932e239dada6ee743783f75f3ca7. Sorry it took so long to find a good solution.\n. Yes, this is a known limitation of the library (there's a warning in the README). The other workaround involves just importing the datetime module and using that instead of importing classes from the module. Sorry that there's not currently a better answer.\n. Are you running this exact code? It works on my local machine.\n\nIf you are using this exact code, can you let me know some more details about your setup? Python version, OS, freezegun version, etc.\n\nIf you are not using this exact code, can you show me the code you are using?\n. Okay. So I think the problem here is the aliasing of the datetime import as `dt`.\n\nThe following code works:\n\n``` python\nfrom freezegun import freeze_time\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nfreezer = freeze_time('1980-01-01')\nfreezer.start()\nassert datetime.now() == datetime(1980,1,1)\n```\n\nThis is definitely a bug, but I want to spend some time figuring out the best way to fix it. I've opened a new issue for this at https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/issues/64. \n\nThanks for reporting it.\n. I have pushed a fix to master that I think will address this. Can you give it a test?\n. The reason freezegun mocks on import is to accomodate those that do `from datetime import datetime` before freezegun is activated. If you can find a good workaround, I'll be happy to pull it in.\n. Sorry, my comment was unclear. What works now is if someone imports freezegun, then does `from datetime import datetime` and then uses the decorator.\n\nWhen freezegun first started, it didn't do any of this patching on import, but then I got a bunch of complaints. The issue is that people can't always control how third-party software imports datetime.\n\nSorry that this all kinda sucks. It's my least favorite thing about this library. We could do something like\n\n``` python\nimport freezegun\nfreezegun.dont_patch()\n```\n\nand have dont_patch revert the patching.\n\nThat seems pretty gross to me though. Another idea is to have a different branch that works the old way.\n. This should be fixed in the newest version.\n. Just to be completely clear (in case people find this issue in the future), Freezegun will not work directly with Pandas, but Freezegun now only mocks datetime when it is activated allowing use of Freezegun in non-Panda tests.\n. Thanks!\n. Hi Mark. I apologize for the delay in responding. I'm actually working on a new branch of this project (`ctypes`) that changes freezegun to mostly be done with ctypes. It should solve most of these issues.\n\nSince that is going to change a lot of things, I don't want to take any big pull requests until I get that branch merged in. I'll leave this open and revisit post-merge.\n\nThanks again.\n. Hey Mark,\n\nI'm finally getting around to this again. I think that most of these issues have been addressed with the exception of adding `FakeTime`. If you want to refactor this pull request to add that and add a couple tests, I'll happily pull it in.\n\nThanks again.\n. Closing since this was done with f3b0b1089acd746d4bfd98f13d34cfb84fd59832\n. Thanks Matthew!\n. Thanks Javier!\n. Yeah, that's not great.\n\nI'm working on a new branch (`ctypes`) that will solve this problem. It doesn't work with python 3 yet though. If you're using python2, it'd be great to have some people start testing that branch.\n. Yes, most likely. You can try the `ctypes` branch and see if that gives you any luck.\n. Not a perfect solution, but it seems like the best one for now.\n. If you can add a test or two, I'll happily pull this in.\n. Excellent. Thanks!\n. It looks like this breaks on Python 3. https://travis-ci.org/spulec/freezegun/jobs/6890595\n. If you get a chance, can you try the https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/tree/ctypes branch on App Engine? It will eventually become master for freezegun once I get the python 3 tests passing.\n. Any chance that the latest release fixes any of this?\n\nIf not, I probably will close as wont-fix unless we can find something wrong with freezegun outside of GAE. I do appreciate you opening the ticket regardless. The fixes will be helpful to future users who search for this.\n. Can you confirm that the most recent version doesn't work? If it doesn't work, what happens?\n. Probably the same as https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/issues/69\n\nYou could try an older version until that issue is resolved.\n. No worries. Also note that I've pushed a new release since that commit.\n. :beers:\n\nThanks Roman, this is great! Merged, updated the README, and pushed a new version to PyPi.\n. This is great. Thanks for your work.\n\nIt looks like there are some issues with the tests for python 2.6 and 3.3. If you can fix those, I would love to pull this in. Let me know if I can be of help.\n. Great, thanks for your work!\n\nI'm planning on pushing out a new version later today.\n. Thanks Gilles!\n. Thanks Luke. Just pushed a commit to fix this and pushed out a new release (0.1.11).\n. Awesome, thanks Fredrik!\n. Thanks for reporting this. It should be fixed with https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/commit/204d756353048b04fe84db9e8c23a6211dee2b93\n. Hi there,\n\nI can't seem to reproduce this. Can you post any more code around it? Pickleing in general should definitely work.\n. Thanks for the solid test case. This is definitely a bug. My notes so far:\n\nWhen pickling, the Pickler looks at the module of the object's class and grabs the class by name. If the object's class and the class that the Pickler loads from the module are not the same object, it raises an error. \n\nIn our example: `real_datetime` has a class of `datetime.datetime`. When the pickling occurs, `sys.modules['datetime'].datetime` is actually `FakeDatetime` which is why we get the error.\n\nhttp://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/db9762529f45\n\nIt's not immediately clear to me if Python is being overly protective by checking `if klass is not object` as opposed to `if klass != obj`. If it was checking the later, we could fix this by overwriting `FakeDatetime.__eq__`.\n\nIt looks like one possible solution would be to register a custom function with [copy_reg](http://docs.python.org/2/library/copy_reg.html), but I'm not that familiar with that module.\n\nAny thoughts? I usually try to steer clear of pickling so this certainly is not my forte.\n. No, I unfortunately don't have a very good solution yet.\n. I pushed a commit to master that should address this. Anyone want to test?\n. Freezegun 0.2.0 is now released. Thank you all for your patience.\n. Hey Hynek,\n\nSorry for the issues.\n\nIt looks like six is altering sys.modules while Freezegun is iterating over them.\n\nI believe it was caused by this commit: https://bitbucket.org/gutworth/six/commits/fc2decf405ea6bcd3226bb1b77069d2a2279e0b7.\n\nI still don't really understand based on that traceback how those lines in six are occurring at the same time as freezegun is iterating over sys.modules, but I have confirmed that removing those two lines from Six will fix the issue. It looks like `mod_name` at that point is 'six.moves.tkinter_tix'.\n\nI will continue looking into and keep an eye on https://bitbucket.org/gutworth/six/issue/54/dependency-on-optional-tkinter-gdbm which I think may be related.\n. Should be fixed with #32\n. I can't say I'm completely pumped about having to add this, but if it helps get the job done let's do it.\n\nThanks for your contribution Andy!\n\nI'll push a new version shortly.\n. Thanks Ralph!\n\nThe original reason for freezing it was https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/issues/31\n. Just pushed out 0.1.13\n. Thanks Mat. Fixed with https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/commit/1ec95e12a5d3f066427510516fb9f42e83ff864b\n. Hey Chris, sorry about that. Can you try running against master now? I think the commit below should fix it.\n\nhttps://github.com/spulec/freezegun/commit/918a9736b2402377425496546cdf20d403a22afa\n\nIf so, I'll push out a new version.\n. Yeah, that might be the best solution. I'll try to take a look at it tonight again.\n. Thanks Chris! Will push out a new version later today.\n. Release 0.1.14 pushed to PyPI.\n. Thanks Jeroen!\n. According to [this](http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~dateutil/dateutil/trunk/view/head:/NEWS), python-dateutil>=2.1 should now work with python 2.6 and 2.7. Is there some other reason to not use the new version?\n. No worries. It's certainly possible there is still a bug in the new version of dateutil (or freezegun's interaction with it). Let me know if it looks like that is the case.\n. It looks like Django has an older version of six.\n\nhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/utils/six.py#L107-L119\n\nvs\n\nhttps://bitbucket.org/gutworth/six/src/a875ac34c777fe801569c6c5299bf1a35aa578cd/six.py?at=default#cl-111\n\nI think this issue was solved by https://bitbucket.org/gutworth/six/commits/e914c4c89b073b7eacb440a8bf456dd1d28018ba\n. I believe this is fixed with #40. Please reopen if there are still issues.\n. Thanks Jeroen!\n. Hmmm, it looks like sqlite3 was detecting that this is not a real datetime object. I've added custom adapters. Can you test against master?\n\nI'm not completely happy with this solution, but I couldn't think of anything else since it looks like the sqlite3 type comparison is being done in C.\n. Version 0.1.16 is pushed. Thanks again for reporting this!\n. Ah, you are completely right. Thanks Rob!\n. Ooops, pushed now. Thanks.\n. Awesome! Thanks.\n. It does. I've added the classifiers. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. I like the idea, but am a bit worried about backwards compatibility. Maybe a parameter to pass to the decorator.\n\nMy biggest concern is that it could cause harm to the 90% of users that wouldn't use the feature (imagine they are using some third party library that decides to call `sleep()`). With a parameter though, I think it would work.\n. That seems reasonable to me. I would accept a pull request with that as a default-off parameter.\n. I don't think that should require any changes to freezegun to make work. If you do the Raw use, then patch `sleep` to increment the `freezer.time_to_freeze`.\n. @jdunck that sounds good. I think it would actually make a lot of things easier.\n. This is definitely strange. `datetime.utcnow()` should definitely return a timezone-naive datetime. Looking into the [boto code](https://github.com/boto/boto/blob/develop/boto/provider.py#L397-L398), it seems that `self._credential_expiry_time` should certainly be naive as well.\n\nI'm guessing the reason it passes locally is because boto start to bail when it realizes you are not on an EC2 machine. I'm guessing CircleCI runs on EC2 so boto is attempting to grab CircleCI's IAM credentials.\n\nIf I get some time to spin up a CircleCI (or probably any EC2 machine), I'll try to dig into this more. A quick fix might be to create a dummy boto config to short-circuit the authentication logic.\n\nPS: as soon as I saw the email for this issue, I thought to myself: \"Crap, who am I going to blame for this?\" :)\n. Okay. The `Z` in `2014-07-30T01:00:00Z` is causing Freezegun to return a timezone-aware datetime for `utcnow`. A quick fix is to just remove the `Z` from your test, since everything is UTC anyway so it shouldn't change anything.\n\nFreezegun should probably be changed, but I'm not positive what behavior Freezegun should have when someone passes in a timezone-aware string. For this scenario, Freezegun should probably just strip it off. If someone passes in a non-UTC datetime, we should probably be smarter and convert it.\n. Fixed with fb8f822e3c0a74c6136876ac975e654a4a715add\n. Awesome. Thanks Andrew!\n. This is a good idea. If we can get the tests working, I'll happily merge.\n. Thanks Richard!\n. Can you try running against `master` and let me know if that fixes the issue?\n. I wanted to make sure I documented this stack overflow question that explains the problem.\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/19614658/how-do-i-make-pytest-fixtures-work-with-decorated-functions\n\nI would prefer not to require the `decorator` package as a dependency, but there may not be a lot of other options. We can try to use some of the logic the package uses.\n. No, I haven't had any time. We can try to use whatever logic the decorator package uses.\n. Good catch. Thanks!\n. Great idea. Thanks Tye!\n. Thanks Roman! I'll work on getting a release out shortly.\n. Version `0.1.19` is on PyPI. Thanks again!\n. Great. Thanks Donald! I will try to get a new release out soon.\n. Sorry about that. I've changed the class-based decorator to impact all non-private methods now.\n. I think this is the same bug as #57. I'm going to close this and start working on fixing that. Feel free to follow along there.\n. Thanks for reporting.\n\nI don't think we ever implemented reading the timezone from a datetime that is passed it. I'll see what that would take.\n\nA workaround for now is to do something like `with freeze_time(\"2014-10-14-07\", tz_offset=-6):`.\n. I don't think I really understand what this is trying to accomplish.\n\nSo if a user passes in \"1970-01-01T00:00:00-04:00\", which is not midnight UTC, then we want utcnow() to return midnight UTC?\n. Got it. You are right. I had been reading it wrong.\n\nWhy the changes to `requirements.txt`? If you can remove those, I will happily merge.\n. Thanks for your work!\n. Unfortunately, we can't use the version from `__init__` without importing everything which fails since the dependencies aren't installed at that point (take a look at Travis to see what I mean).\n\nI'm going to close this out, but please feel free to reopen if you come up with a better solution.\n. Thanks for reporting.\n\nI've pushed a fix with 747e496124ab42b497e9e099d5a93d7c419da827. Can you check that it works?\n. Thanks for reporting it. I'll try to get a new version out within a day or two.\n. Great, thanks Donald!\n. Thank you!\n. Thanks for reporting!\n\nThis should be fixed with #70. Feel free to reopen if it still seems to happen.\n. Thanks for reporting.\n\nI'm having trouble reproducing this. When I save the above code as `tester.py` and run `python -m cProfile tester.py`, I get the following:\n\n`0.2.3`: ~0.063 seconds\n`0.2.2`: ~0.065 seconds\n\nIt definitely varies a bit, but I'm not seeing the 100x change you are seeing. Is the code you have listed the actual code you are running?\n. Okay, so the slowdown is a result of https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/issues/64. We need to iterate through all the attributes of a module to see if there are any aliased `datetime`s, `date`s, or `time`s. I can't currently think of a faster way to do this.\n\nI just pushed a fix that will make `stop` a lot faster though. We now store all of the changes we make and then just revert those. Can you give HEAD for a spin?\n. @simon-weber thanks for the suggestions! I am probably leaning toward the first one.\n. PRs welcome. I was actually just working on a work project that uses freezegun as a dependency and ran into this. Within a minute of hitting the bug, I checked my email and saw this PR. Sometimes open source is really great.\n\nThanks for your help!\n. Just saw your question: I think all of those `if`s should really be `elif`s so I don't think it matters. Is that right?\n. Oh, I see.\n\nI'm always a bit nervous to have blanket `except`s like that. I think I would rather wait and see if people run into other issues before making the change.\n\n(going to fix the `if/elif` in master shortly)\n\nThanks again!\n. As soon as I tried the new version with my work project I ran into a RuntimeError so it appears that your suggestion is necessary. Added with 47d113e7a50e99ccfab2b7e4259c29e1666ea60c.\n\nGoing to do some more testing, but I will release a new version shortly.\n. Ooh, I just pushed a change to master (for completely unrelated reasons) that I think might fix this. Can you give it a spin?\n\nIf it does, I'll push a new version.\n. Great, I have pushed v0.2.6 to PyPI. Feel free to reopen if any issues persist.\n\nGlad to hear it!\n. Excellent!\n\nThanks for your help Andreas. I will push a new release shortly.\n. (new version released: 0.2.7)\n\nThanks for the note. You made my day.\n\nI used to have a very similar hacky solution used throughout my projects and finally got fed up with it. Now we can centralize the hacks all in one place :)\n. Thank you again! I will push a new release shortly.\n. I had not intended for the tests to be included with the distributions. That is now fixed with https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/commit/47bcd0fc156ecdaed219cdbd9a2ac8b80a632bad.\n\nThanks.\n. [This](https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/issues/27) was the original reason. I'm open to alternative suggestions, but tend to be -0 on things like a nested tests directory inside of the freezegun module.\n. Ah, I missed one!\n\nThanks for opening. I'll try to get around to fixing this. If anyone else gets a minute and wants to take a stab at a pull request, feel free.\n. I've added support for `time.strftime`, `time.localtime`, and `time.gmtime` with #78.\n\nIf you can give it a test on your end, I'll update the docs and push out a new release.\n. Pushing out a new release now. Feel free to reopen if things don't seem to work.\n. Thank you!\n. Sorry about that. It was a bug in an old version of freezegun. You should be able to fix by using a newer freezegun.\n. Thanks. This definitely seems like the right way to do it.\n. I think we can close this since #83 was merged. Feel free to reopen if I missed something though.\n. Thanks!\n. I knew this day would eventually come....\n. I have just pushed out version `0.3.0` to PyPI with Wheels. Thanks for the push!\n. Universal wheel created for `0.3.1` (I think). Let me know if it doesn't look right.\n. Awesome\n. After digging into this a bit, I don't think the issue is with freezegun. Try running the following on python2 and python3 and notice the different results.\n\n``` python\nimport datetime\nfrom dateutil.tz import *\ntz = gettz('Europe/London')\nprint(tz.fromutc(datetime.datetime(2014, 4, 26, 12, 1).replace(tzinfo=tz)))\n```\n\nAlso notice that if we change the datetime to `datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 26, 12, 1)`, then everything works.\n\nI don't have more time to dig into this right now. If you keep digging, let me know what you find.\n. Hmmm, very interesting.\n\nI'm going to close this for now. Feel free to reopen if I can be of assistance or you think there is an easy workaround for freezegun to use, although I am a bit worried it could create more confusion. Also, feel free to comment here if any progress is made on your Python ticket.\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. This is great! Thank you!\n. Not sure if you know this, but `freeze_time` already accepts a `tz_offset` argument.\n\nIf your suggestion was just to make it cleaner so that we could pass in 'nice' timezone names, then I could get behind that.\n. Ah, right. I had forgotten about your second point. PR welcome.\n. Going to close this with support for @shreevatsar 's solution\n. Happy to accept a PR for it, but don't want to leave the issue open forever.\n. You make good points and I agree, especially if this is necessary to get the Django `TestCase` working.\n. Thank you again!\n. Thank you for opening this. Your point is very valid. I would like to fix this somehow, but have a few thoughts/questions I'm trying to think through. Any feedback appreciated.\n- I think we would need to have some sort of backwards-compatibility. No idea how this would work.\n- Should the time passed into freezegun be used as the local time or utc time?\n- What if the time passed in has a timezone as well or a `tz_offset` is passed?\n\nI'm also quite worried about how the documentation will read.\n. @bryanhelmig happy to accept a fix.\n\nAgree with thoughts on 1 and 3.\n\n2 makes me a bit nervous. I fear that this would force the majority of users to change their code (that is just a hunch). If we wanted to keep utc default, we could add a `local` argument to override it. As you noted, we will make people upset either way. \n. One thing I didn't realize until now is that our existing support for tz offsets already makes the assumption that we are passing the time for `utc` use. From the README:\n\n``` python\n@freeze_time(\"2012-01-14 03:21:34\", tz_offset=-4)\ndef test():\n    assert datetime.datetime.utcnow() == datetime.datetime(2012, 01, 14, 03, 21, 34)\n    assert datetime.datetime.now() == datetime.datetime(2012, 01, 13, 23, 21, 34)\n```\n\nIf we wanted to keep this all working, would the fix be a matter of setting `tz_offset` to default to `time.timezone / 3600`?\n. Yes, open to a PR with a clean merge and tests passing.. Great, thank you!\n. `0.3.2` is now released.\n. Thank you!\n. Thank you!\n. Thanks for opening.\n\nCan you try the master branch and see if the commit I just pushed fixes the issue?\n. Great. Heads up that I just pushed out freezegun `0.3.3` with the fix.\n. #WontFix\n. Thanks for opening. You are correct. Should be fixed now.\n. Agh, thanks. Added.\n. Thanks for opening!\n\nCan you test now with the latest commit on `master`? I think it is solved.\n. I just pushed out `0.3.4` for anyone that does need this fix.\n. Which version of freezegun are you on? We've had this issue in the past, but I thought it was fixed with https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/issues/13\n. I think Pandas does some C-level manipulation or use of the datetime/time modules. I've dug into it a bit, but not found a way that we could work around it.\n. Thanks for opening! I have recreated the issue.\n\nThis is a result of a performance improvement that was made with https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/commit/ac163a5c534b4728bd082d3f67d956b1df71f04c. Clearly we will need to rethink a better way to do that.\n\nFor now, you can try using an older version.\n. @UberFarmer  Do you have a test case for it breaking on 0.2.3? My test cases all pass on 0.2.5\n\n(obviously we still need to fix in master too, but I just want to ensure I understand the issue fully)\n. this should be fixed with #119 \n. Thanks, I changed it to `assert datetime.date.today() == datetime.date(2012, 01, 13)` which seems the clearest.\n. The easiest workaround for now is to pass the [`ignore` parameter](https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/blob/master/freezegun/api.py#L372-L385) with the deprecated modules. That obviously isn't ideal, but I don't have a better answer right now.\n\nSuggestions welcome.\n. Thanks for the push, I was being lazy\n. This is great. Thanks for the help!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Ah, good catch\n. Looks great. `tick` is perfect.\n. Thanks!\n. Great, thanks!\n. Looks like this caused some issues with the tests\n. Thanks!\n. You can access `freezegun.api.real_datetime` to get the real datetime class. You can also grab an alias to the datetime class before patching.\n. Thanks for opening!\n. I have confirmed this is a bug. Due to how time is mocked (compared to datetime), the fix is going to take a bit of work.\n. No progress, feel free to take a stab at it.\n. Thanks for this!\n\nThe test seems to be that newer Coverage versions don't support python 3.2. I've fixed in master.\n. agreed\n. Any idea how ZODB gets the time? Unfortunately, if it makes a system call for this we won't be able to do anything.\n. Thank you!\n. thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. thanks!\n. Fixed with https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/pull/125\n. Decided to merge https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/pull/125 instead, because I'm not quite ready for a release yet.\n. thanks!\n. This seems like either a bug in cffi or `dir`, right? Is it an expected case that `dir` will raise this type of error?\n. This appears to be fixed in `cffi > 1.5.2` according to #126 \n. Thanks!\n. Closed with #135 \n. thanks!\n. thanks!\n. `0.3.7` is now available\n. Going to close this for now since I haven't responded in a long time (my bad).\r\n\r\nIf you are still interested: I don't exactly understand the use case here. When do we want to freeze a short distance in the future? Just trying to figure out if the use-case is common enough to add support.\r\n. Okay, that makes sense. Can you add a test? I'll be happy to merge.. Hmmm, they seem to be working for me. Are you on master?\r\n\r\nTravis ran them without issue: https://travis-ci.org/spulec/freezegun/builds/199854719. thanks!\n. No update from me. Would be open to someone taking this and running with it.. Yes, this is fixed in master with https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/pull/135. I'll hopefully be able to get a new release out soon.\n. `0.3.7` is now available.\n. Hmmm, I get the same TypeError even without freezegun. Are you on the newest freezegun and pytz? What version of python?\n. thanks!\n. `0.3.7` is now available\n. Agreed, would be happy to accept a PR.\n. Just to make sure I understand, you want to patch the `datetime` module, but not the `time` module?\n. Great, thanks!\n. thanks!\n. I can't seem to find this method in the python documentation (https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html).\n. Oh, my bad. I just haven't pushed out a new release yet. Feel free to install from Github and I should be getting a new release out soon.\n. Version 0.3.8 is now released. thanks!\n. Version 0.3.8 has been released. Does calling `dir(py.test.cmdline)` throw an exception?\n. Can someone give me a script to recreate this so I can try to dig more?. Do you know how JWT creates the expires datetime?\n. Thanks for opening.\r\n\r\nI believe this is a dupe of https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/issues/89. A solution is at https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/pull/136, but it hasn't been merged in yet.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close, but feel free to reopen if you think my assessment is wrong.. Thanks for opening. This is an interesting issue.\n\nReading through the [`uuid1` code](https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/default/Lib/uuid.py), it seems to not work when moving time backwards. Notice how `_last_timestamp` is used.\n\nI suppose we could file a bug with python. I'm not sure if they will consider this a valid use case.\n\nYou can work around this by setting `uuid._last_timestamp = None`. \n. This should now be fixed with #172. Is this necessary? Should we ever be calling `_time_to_freeze` if there isn't `cls.times_to_freeze`?\n. I'm trying to figure out the scenario in which this happens. Do you have a test to reproduce the issue?\n. thanks!. Version `0.3.9` is now released!. Thanks!\n. I've just released `0.3.8`.\n\nYes, that is the correct way to use it.\n. I don't know of a way to make this work. I'm going to close, but feel free to reopen if there is a possible solution here.. Thanks!\n. Excellent, thank you!\n. Great, thank you!\n. Going to close this for now. Feel free to rebase and add some tests and I'd be happy to help get this merged.. Thanks!\n. Thanks for the suggestion. Added. Yes, I believe @romgar is correct. Going to close this, but feel free to reopen if something else comes up.. Thanks!. Hmmmm.\r\n\r\nTwo possible solutions:\r\n\r\n1). It looks like pg8000 has a list of types that it can accept `self.py_types`. You could try appending the freezegun class to that list.\r\n\r\n2). If you do `from freezegun.api import real_date`, you can get access to the real date module to do any casting you need.\r\n\r\nLet me know if neither of those work. I can't think of a way to make this work by default.. I've added python 3.6 to Travis and everything seems to be passing. https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/commit/88f69903b3ac66b3894be00ef89d597e34f88f5e\r\n\r\nI'm struggling to recreate this issue. Anything else that might be different about your environment?. Great, thank you!. A bit unintuitive, but we use requirements.txt for dev requirements and prod requirements are in the setup.py: https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/blob/master/setup.py#L8-L12. Freezegun isn't designed to work like this. You will need to get the original freeze_time instance back to disable the freezing. Can you store the freeze_time instance as a global somehow so that it can be accessed in the place where you want to stop freezing?. No problem.. I can't think of any way to do this. Pytest seems to evaluate the function before running the test.\r\n\r\nFeel free to reopen if you can think of another way.. Thanks, will work on getting a new release out.. How are you using freezegun (decorator, context manager, raw use)?. If you look at the traceback, you can see that the freezegun exception is happening only after another exception already happened: `KeyError: 'modification'`\r\n\r\nIdeally, freezegun would always be able to cleanup, but if it is being used in the raw use mode, I'm not sure how that will be possible.\r\n. Ah, got it. I am confused then. Can you throw some print statements inside of the freezegun `start` and `stop` to see if they are unbalanced?. I'm a bit confused. In the `test_offset`, you are now passing a `tz_offset`, but only changing the first assertion.. Is this the same as #89?. It seems that `pytest.mark.asyncio` is skipping the decorator? Any more insight into what it is doing?. I believe this is a duplicate of https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/issues/89\r\n\r\nLet me know if you don't think that is the case.. If it doesn't work, I'd be happy to accept a PR to make it work. It seems like a reasonable use case.. Fixed with #187. Yes, I think this change isn't necessary. Are you seeing any issues without the change?. I'm debating if we should find a more extensible way to do this. The idea of maintaining a list of all modules that might need real time modules doesn't seem ideal.. Awesome work, thank you!. From what I can see, this is freezegun behaving in the expected manner. Yes, you will need to unfreeze if you want time to progress.\r\n\r\nPlease reopen if I am misunderstanding.. Can you confirm what version of freezegun you are using?\r\n\r\nThe tests that use this code are passing on Travis: https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/blob/master/tests/test_datetimes.py#L64-L77\r\n\r\nAny idea what else about your environment would be different?. See here: https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/issues/176. Hmmm, that doesn't seem right. Here is an example of the test generally working: https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/blob/master/tests/test_datetimes.py#L64-L77\r\n\r\nCan you give more details of your model files or anything else? Anywhere you might accidentally be casting to a date?. Thanks for opening this.\r\n\r\nCan you talk more about the use case? It isn't clear to me why it makes more sense to have two entry points.. thanks!. My guess is that it won't do any of that stuff, but I can't say that I've tested it.. Hmmmmm..... that doesn't seem great :/\r\n\r\nCan you add some print/log statements inside of freezegun on `start` and `stop`? Somehow the internal state of the freezegun stack is getting messed up and it is doesn't have a datetime to return.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if you think you can reproduce a small test case that would be helpful (though I know that can be hard with a real django project like that).. Thanks for opening.\r\n\r\nOne interesting thing: this works if you change `frozenat` to something like `2017-01-01 01:23:45`. I've dug a bit, but I'm not sure why changing that would break the unpatching of uuid.. It seems the tests are failing in a recursive loop. Any idea why?. Awesome, thanks!. I believe that version hasn't been released yet. Will hopefully get it out soon.. I applaud the effort, but no.\n. Thanks for reporting this Neal!\n. Oops, silly mistake. Forgot datetime needed to be a subclass of date. Fixed and pushed a new version to PyPI.\n. I put in a quick fix that will make addition and subtraction work. I'll go back at some point and reconsider other operators. If you find any, please reopen this ticket or open another ticket.\n. This was also fixed by https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/commit/0453e5f47efd1d0d79af973e5ddcf9fa83b2ca40\n. Ah, you are correct. It looks like I fixed `now()`, but not `utcnow()`. Fixed with https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/commit/768a60f453c70517b6191fb9df29cd4ff8e78d7f and added tests. Going to push a new release in a minute.\n. Also, thanks!\n. I believe that's the same issue as #30 \n. The lines `assert not isinstance(now, FakeDatetime)` and `assert not isinstance(now, FakeDate)` are not expected to pass. Once freeze_time is imported, all datetime/date instances will be instances of FakeDatetime/FakeDate and all references to datetime.datetime/datetime.date will actually be references to the classes FakeDatetime/FakeDate.\n\nThe thought is that this will all go on transparently behind the scenes and people will be able to just think of it all as datetime.datetime. Feel free to reopen if this is somehow causing issues in your test writing.\n. Hi there,\n\nThanks so much for taking the time to do this and apologies for the delay in responding.\n\nThis looks great, but I have one or two concerns. If you have time to discuss/fix, great. Otherwise, I can pull the request in and make the changes myself.\n\nIf we're going to add support for the time module, we need to support all of the methods (time.clock(), time.timezone, etc). I don't want people to see the time module being mocked and assume incorrectly that all of the methods are mocked.\n\nSecond item is that we need to add some docs.\n\nTo reiterate, if you have some more time to work on this, great. Otherwise, I'll take the great start you've given me and run with it.\n. Heh, yeah I haven't done any work on this.\n\nI agree with your comments.\n\nMake the changes and we can close this out. Also note that we are now python 3 compatible. Not sure if that changes any of your existing code.\n. Hi Dan,\n\nThanks a lot for taking the time to report this.\n\nI'm not exactly excited that we have to special case timedeltas like this. I think it might be a little cleaner if we flipped it and did something like\n\n``` python\nif isinstance(result, real_datetime):\n    return date_to_fakedate(result)\nelse:\n    return result\n```\n\nIt seems to be more explicit about what our intentions really are.\n\nThoughts?\n. Thanks Dan!\n. Hi Hannes. I really like the idea, but don't think there is an easy way to do this with how the code is setup. One thing you can do is\n\n``` python\nfrom freezegun.api import FakeDatetime\nnow = datetime.datetime.now()\nassert isinstance(now, FakeDatetime)\n```\n\nIf you can think of an easy way to do this, please reopen this issue because I would love to have it.\n. Hi Chris. I have just pushed version 0.0.9 that should fix your problem. Feel free to reopen this issue with the failing code if it still doesn't work.\n\nGlad to head you like it!\n. now() not accepting timezones is definitely a bug and should be fixed.\n\nI'm not able to recreate the django saving bug though. isinstance() checks should all pass for the current version of freezegun.\n. That would be great. Thanks.\n. I think that a lot of these issues should be fixed in the newest release. Freezegun now only mocks datetime/date when activated. I haven't actually tested with django yet though.\n. I think this should all be fixed with the latest release.\n. Yes, unfortunately that library imports datetime classes instead of just the datetime module. One workaround is to import freezegun before importing anything django. Sorry that there's not currently a better answer.\n. This should be fixed in the newest release due to https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/commit/a9cc66ce1f6c932e239dada6ee743783f75f3ca7. Sorry it took so long to find a good solution.\n. Yes, this is a known limitation of the library (there's a warning in the README). The other workaround involves just importing the datetime module and using that instead of importing classes from the module. Sorry that there's not currently a better answer.\n. Are you running this exact code? It works on my local machine.\n\nIf you are using this exact code, can you let me know some more details about your setup? Python version, OS, freezegun version, etc.\n\nIf you are not using this exact code, can you show me the code you are using?\n. Okay. So I think the problem here is the aliasing of the datetime import as `dt`.\n\nThe following code works:\n\n``` python\nfrom freezegun import freeze_time\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nfreezer = freeze_time('1980-01-01')\nfreezer.start()\nassert datetime.now() == datetime(1980,1,1)\n```\n\nThis is definitely a bug, but I want to spend some time figuring out the best way to fix it. I've opened a new issue for this at https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/issues/64. \n\nThanks for reporting it.\n. I have pushed a fix to master that I think will address this. Can you give it a test?\n. The reason freezegun mocks on import is to accomodate those that do `from datetime import datetime` before freezegun is activated. If you can find a good workaround, I'll be happy to pull it in.\n. Sorry, my comment was unclear. What works now is if someone imports freezegun, then does `from datetime import datetime` and then uses the decorator.\n\nWhen freezegun first started, it didn't do any of this patching on import, but then I got a bunch of complaints. The issue is that people can't always control how third-party software imports datetime.\n\nSorry that this all kinda sucks. It's my least favorite thing about this library. We could do something like\n\n``` python\nimport freezegun\nfreezegun.dont_patch()\n```\n\nand have dont_patch revert the patching.\n\nThat seems pretty gross to me though. Another idea is to have a different branch that works the old way.\n. This should be fixed in the newest version.\n. Just to be completely clear (in case people find this issue in the future), Freezegun will not work directly with Pandas, but Freezegun now only mocks datetime when it is activated allowing use of Freezegun in non-Panda tests.\n. Thanks!\n. Hi Mark. I apologize for the delay in responding. I'm actually working on a new branch of this project (`ctypes`) that changes freezegun to mostly be done with ctypes. It should solve most of these issues.\n\nSince that is going to change a lot of things, I don't want to take any big pull requests until I get that branch merged in. I'll leave this open and revisit post-merge.\n\nThanks again.\n. Hey Mark,\n\nI'm finally getting around to this again. I think that most of these issues have been addressed with the exception of adding `FakeTime`. If you want to refactor this pull request to add that and add a couple tests, I'll happily pull it in.\n\nThanks again.\n. Closing since this was done with f3b0b1089acd746d4bfd98f13d34cfb84fd59832\n. Thanks Matthew!\n. Thanks Javier!\n. Yeah, that's not great.\n\nI'm working on a new branch (`ctypes`) that will solve this problem. It doesn't work with python 3 yet though. If you're using python2, it'd be great to have some people start testing that branch.\n. Yes, most likely. You can try the `ctypes` branch and see if that gives you any luck.\n. Not a perfect solution, but it seems like the best one for now.\n. If you can add a test or two, I'll happily pull this in.\n. Excellent. Thanks!\n. It looks like this breaks on Python 3. https://travis-ci.org/spulec/freezegun/jobs/6890595\n. If you get a chance, can you try the https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/tree/ctypes branch on App Engine? It will eventually become master for freezegun once I get the python 3 tests passing.\n. Any chance that the latest release fixes any of this?\n\nIf not, I probably will close as wont-fix unless we can find something wrong with freezegun outside of GAE. I do appreciate you opening the ticket regardless. The fixes will be helpful to future users who search for this.\n. Can you confirm that the most recent version doesn't work? If it doesn't work, what happens?\n. Probably the same as https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/issues/69\n\nYou could try an older version until that issue is resolved.\n. No worries. Also note that I've pushed a new release since that commit.\n. :beers:\n\nThanks Roman, this is great! Merged, updated the README, and pushed a new version to PyPi.\n. This is great. Thanks for your work.\n\nIt looks like there are some issues with the tests for python 2.6 and 3.3. If you can fix those, I would love to pull this in. Let me know if I can be of help.\n. Great, thanks for your work!\n\nI'm planning on pushing out a new version later today.\n. Thanks Gilles!\n. Thanks Luke. Just pushed a commit to fix this and pushed out a new release (0.1.11).\n. Awesome, thanks Fredrik!\n. Thanks for reporting this. It should be fixed with https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/commit/204d756353048b04fe84db9e8c23a6211dee2b93\n. Hi there,\n\nI can't seem to reproduce this. Can you post any more code around it? Pickleing in general should definitely work.\n. Thanks for the solid test case. This is definitely a bug. My notes so far:\n\nWhen pickling, the Pickler looks at the module of the object's class and grabs the class by name. If the object's class and the class that the Pickler loads from the module are not the same object, it raises an error. \n\nIn our example: `real_datetime` has a class of `datetime.datetime`. When the pickling occurs, `sys.modules['datetime'].datetime` is actually `FakeDatetime` which is why we get the error.\n\nhttp://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/db9762529f45\n\nIt's not immediately clear to me if Python is being overly protective by checking `if klass is not object` as opposed to `if klass != obj`. If it was checking the later, we could fix this by overwriting `FakeDatetime.__eq__`.\n\nIt looks like one possible solution would be to register a custom function with [copy_reg](http://docs.python.org/2/library/copy_reg.html), but I'm not that familiar with that module.\n\nAny thoughts? I usually try to steer clear of pickling so this certainly is not my forte.\n. No, I unfortunately don't have a very good solution yet.\n. I pushed a commit to master that should address this. Anyone want to test?\n. Freezegun 0.2.0 is now released. Thank you all for your patience.\n. Hey Hynek,\n\nSorry for the issues.\n\nIt looks like six is altering sys.modules while Freezegun is iterating over them.\n\nI believe it was caused by this commit: https://bitbucket.org/gutworth/six/commits/fc2decf405ea6bcd3226bb1b77069d2a2279e0b7.\n\nI still don't really understand based on that traceback how those lines in six are occurring at the same time as freezegun is iterating over sys.modules, but I have confirmed that removing those two lines from Six will fix the issue. It looks like `mod_name` at that point is 'six.moves.tkinter_tix'.\n\nI will continue looking into and keep an eye on https://bitbucket.org/gutworth/six/issue/54/dependency-on-optional-tkinter-gdbm which I think may be related.\n. Should be fixed with #32\n. I can't say I'm completely pumped about having to add this, but if it helps get the job done let's do it.\n\nThanks for your contribution Andy!\n\nI'll push a new version shortly.\n. Thanks Ralph!\n\nThe original reason for freezing it was https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/issues/31\n. Just pushed out 0.1.13\n. Thanks Mat. Fixed with https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/commit/1ec95e12a5d3f066427510516fb9f42e83ff864b\n. Hey Chris, sorry about that. Can you try running against master now? I think the commit below should fix it.\n\nhttps://github.com/spulec/freezegun/commit/918a9736b2402377425496546cdf20d403a22afa\n\nIf so, I'll push out a new version.\n. Yeah, that might be the best solution. I'll try to take a look at it tonight again.\n. Thanks Chris! Will push out a new version later today.\n. Release 0.1.14 pushed to PyPI.\n. Thanks Jeroen!\n. According to [this](http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~dateutil/dateutil/trunk/view/head:/NEWS), python-dateutil>=2.1 should now work with python 2.6 and 2.7. Is there some other reason to not use the new version?\n. No worries. It's certainly possible there is still a bug in the new version of dateutil (or freezegun's interaction with it). Let me know if it looks like that is the case.\n. It looks like Django has an older version of six.\n\nhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/utils/six.py#L107-L119\n\nvs\n\nhttps://bitbucket.org/gutworth/six/src/a875ac34c777fe801569c6c5299bf1a35aa578cd/six.py?at=default#cl-111\n\nI think this issue was solved by https://bitbucket.org/gutworth/six/commits/e914c4c89b073b7eacb440a8bf456dd1d28018ba\n. I believe this is fixed with #40. Please reopen if there are still issues.\n. Thanks Jeroen!\n. Hmmm, it looks like sqlite3 was detecting that this is not a real datetime object. I've added custom adapters. Can you test against master?\n\nI'm not completely happy with this solution, but I couldn't think of anything else since it looks like the sqlite3 type comparison is being done in C.\n. Version 0.1.16 is pushed. Thanks again for reporting this!\n. Ah, you are completely right. Thanks Rob!\n. Ooops, pushed now. Thanks.\n. Awesome! Thanks.\n. It does. I've added the classifiers. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. I like the idea, but am a bit worried about backwards compatibility. Maybe a parameter to pass to the decorator.\n\nMy biggest concern is that it could cause harm to the 90% of users that wouldn't use the feature (imagine they are using some third party library that decides to call `sleep()`). With a parameter though, I think it would work.\n. That seems reasonable to me. I would accept a pull request with that as a default-off parameter.\n. I don't think that should require any changes to freezegun to make work. If you do the Raw use, then patch `sleep` to increment the `freezer.time_to_freeze`.\n. @jdunck that sounds good. I think it would actually make a lot of things easier.\n. This is definitely strange. `datetime.utcnow()` should definitely return a timezone-naive datetime. Looking into the [boto code](https://github.com/boto/boto/blob/develop/boto/provider.py#L397-L398), it seems that `self._credential_expiry_time` should certainly be naive as well.\n\nI'm guessing the reason it passes locally is because boto start to bail when it realizes you are not on an EC2 machine. I'm guessing CircleCI runs on EC2 so boto is attempting to grab CircleCI's IAM credentials.\n\nIf I get some time to spin up a CircleCI (or probably any EC2 machine), I'll try to dig into this more. A quick fix might be to create a dummy boto config to short-circuit the authentication logic.\n\nPS: as soon as I saw the email for this issue, I thought to myself: \"Crap, who am I going to blame for this?\" :)\n. Okay. The `Z` in `2014-07-30T01:00:00Z` is causing Freezegun to return a timezone-aware datetime for `utcnow`. A quick fix is to just remove the `Z` from your test, since everything is UTC anyway so it shouldn't change anything.\n\nFreezegun should probably be changed, but I'm not positive what behavior Freezegun should have when someone passes in a timezone-aware string. For this scenario, Freezegun should probably just strip it off. If someone passes in a non-UTC datetime, we should probably be smarter and convert it.\n. Fixed with fb8f822e3c0a74c6136876ac975e654a4a715add\n. Awesome. Thanks Andrew!\n. This is a good idea. If we can get the tests working, I'll happily merge.\n. Thanks Richard!\n. Can you try running against `master` and let me know if that fixes the issue?\n. I wanted to make sure I documented this stack overflow question that explains the problem.\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/19614658/how-do-i-make-pytest-fixtures-work-with-decorated-functions\n\nI would prefer not to require the `decorator` package as a dependency, but there may not be a lot of other options. We can try to use some of the logic the package uses.\n. No, I haven't had any time. We can try to use whatever logic the decorator package uses.\n. Good catch. Thanks!\n. Great idea. Thanks Tye!\n. Thanks Roman! I'll work on getting a release out shortly.\n. Version `0.1.19` is on PyPI. Thanks again!\n. Great. Thanks Donald! I will try to get a new release out soon.\n. Sorry about that. I've changed the class-based decorator to impact all non-private methods now.\n. I think this is the same bug as #57. I'm going to close this and start working on fixing that. Feel free to follow along there.\n. Thanks for reporting.\n\nI don't think we ever implemented reading the timezone from a datetime that is passed it. I'll see what that would take.\n\nA workaround for now is to do something like `with freeze_time(\"2014-10-14-07\", tz_offset=-6):`.\n. I don't think I really understand what this is trying to accomplish.\n\nSo if a user passes in \"1970-01-01T00:00:00-04:00\", which is not midnight UTC, then we want utcnow() to return midnight UTC?\n. Got it. You are right. I had been reading it wrong.\n\nWhy the changes to `requirements.txt`? If you can remove those, I will happily merge.\n. Thanks for your work!\n. Unfortunately, we can't use the version from `__init__` without importing everything which fails since the dependencies aren't installed at that point (take a look at Travis to see what I mean).\n\nI'm going to close this out, but please feel free to reopen if you come up with a better solution.\n. Thanks for reporting.\n\nI've pushed a fix with 747e496124ab42b497e9e099d5a93d7c419da827. Can you check that it works?\n. Thanks for reporting it. I'll try to get a new version out within a day or two.\n. Great, thanks Donald!\n. Thank you!\n. Thanks for reporting!\n\nThis should be fixed with #70. Feel free to reopen if it still seems to happen.\n. Thanks for reporting.\n\nI'm having trouble reproducing this. When I save the above code as `tester.py` and run `python -m cProfile tester.py`, I get the following:\n\n`0.2.3`: ~0.063 seconds\n`0.2.2`: ~0.065 seconds\n\nIt definitely varies a bit, but I'm not seeing the 100x change you are seeing. Is the code you have listed the actual code you are running?\n. Okay, so the slowdown is a result of https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/issues/64. We need to iterate through all the attributes of a module to see if there are any aliased `datetime`s, `date`s, or `time`s. I can't currently think of a faster way to do this.\n\nI just pushed a fix that will make `stop` a lot faster though. We now store all of the changes we make and then just revert those. Can you give HEAD for a spin?\n. @simon-weber thanks for the suggestions! I am probably leaning toward the first one.\n. PRs welcome. I was actually just working on a work project that uses freezegun as a dependency and ran into this. Within a minute of hitting the bug, I checked my email and saw this PR. Sometimes open source is really great.\n\nThanks for your help!\n. Just saw your question: I think all of those `if`s should really be `elif`s so I don't think it matters. Is that right?\n. Oh, I see.\n\nI'm always a bit nervous to have blanket `except`s like that. I think I would rather wait and see if people run into other issues before making the change.\n\n(going to fix the `if/elif` in master shortly)\n\nThanks again!\n. As soon as I tried the new version with my work project I ran into a RuntimeError so it appears that your suggestion is necessary. Added with 47d113e7a50e99ccfab2b7e4259c29e1666ea60c.\n\nGoing to do some more testing, but I will release a new version shortly.\n. Ooh, I just pushed a change to master (for completely unrelated reasons) that I think might fix this. Can you give it a spin?\n\nIf it does, I'll push a new version.\n. Great, I have pushed v0.2.6 to PyPI. Feel free to reopen if any issues persist.\n\nGlad to hear it!\n. Excellent!\n\nThanks for your help Andreas. I will push a new release shortly.\n. (new version released: 0.2.7)\n\nThanks for the note. You made my day.\n\nI used to have a very similar hacky solution used throughout my projects and finally got fed up with it. Now we can centralize the hacks all in one place :)\n. Thank you again! I will push a new release shortly.\n. I had not intended for the tests to be included with the distributions. That is now fixed with https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/commit/47bcd0fc156ecdaed219cdbd9a2ac8b80a632bad.\n\nThanks.\n. [This](https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/issues/27) was the original reason. I'm open to alternative suggestions, but tend to be -0 on things like a nested tests directory inside of the freezegun module.\n. Ah, I missed one!\n\nThanks for opening. I'll try to get around to fixing this. If anyone else gets a minute and wants to take a stab at a pull request, feel free.\n. I've added support for `time.strftime`, `time.localtime`, and `time.gmtime` with #78.\n\nIf you can give it a test on your end, I'll update the docs and push out a new release.\n. Pushing out a new release now. Feel free to reopen if things don't seem to work.\n. Thank you!\n. Sorry about that. It was a bug in an old version of freezegun. You should be able to fix by using a newer freezegun.\n. Thanks. This definitely seems like the right way to do it.\n. I think we can close this since #83 was merged. Feel free to reopen if I missed something though.\n. Thanks!\n. I knew this day would eventually come....\n. I have just pushed out version `0.3.0` to PyPI with Wheels. Thanks for the push!\n. Universal wheel created for `0.3.1` (I think). Let me know if it doesn't look right.\n. Awesome\n. After digging into this a bit, I don't think the issue is with freezegun. Try running the following on python2 and python3 and notice the different results.\n\n``` python\nimport datetime\nfrom dateutil.tz import *\ntz = gettz('Europe/London')\nprint(tz.fromutc(datetime.datetime(2014, 4, 26, 12, 1).replace(tzinfo=tz)))\n```\n\nAlso notice that if we change the datetime to `datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 26, 12, 1)`, then everything works.\n\nI don't have more time to dig into this right now. If you keep digging, let me know what you find.\n. Hmmm, very interesting.\n\nI'm going to close this for now. Feel free to reopen if I can be of assistance or you think there is an easy workaround for freezegun to use, although I am a bit worried it could create more confusion. Also, feel free to comment here if any progress is made on your Python ticket.\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. This is great! Thank you!\n. Not sure if you know this, but `freeze_time` already accepts a `tz_offset` argument.\n\nIf your suggestion was just to make it cleaner so that we could pass in 'nice' timezone names, then I could get behind that.\n. Ah, right. I had forgotten about your second point. PR welcome.\n. Going to close this with support for @shreevatsar 's solution\n. Happy to accept a PR for it, but don't want to leave the issue open forever.\n. You make good points and I agree, especially if this is necessary to get the Django `TestCase` working.\n. Thank you again!\n. Thank you for opening this. Your point is very valid. I would like to fix this somehow, but have a few thoughts/questions I'm trying to think through. Any feedback appreciated.\n- I think we would need to have some sort of backwards-compatibility. No idea how this would work.\n- Should the time passed into freezegun be used as the local time or utc time?\n- What if the time passed in has a timezone as well or a `tz_offset` is passed?\n\nI'm also quite worried about how the documentation will read.\n. @bryanhelmig happy to accept a fix.\n\nAgree with thoughts on 1 and 3.\n\n2 makes me a bit nervous. I fear that this would force the majority of users to change their code (that is just a hunch). If we wanted to keep utc default, we could add a `local` argument to override it. As you noted, we will make people upset either way. \n. One thing I didn't realize until now is that our existing support for tz offsets already makes the assumption that we are passing the time for `utc` use. From the README:\n\n``` python\n@freeze_time(\"2012-01-14 03:21:34\", tz_offset=-4)\ndef test():\n    assert datetime.datetime.utcnow() == datetime.datetime(2012, 01, 14, 03, 21, 34)\n    assert datetime.datetime.now() == datetime.datetime(2012, 01, 13, 23, 21, 34)\n```\n\nIf we wanted to keep this all working, would the fix be a matter of setting `tz_offset` to default to `time.timezone / 3600`?\n. Yes, open to a PR with a clean merge and tests passing.. Great, thank you!\n. `0.3.2` is now released.\n. Thank you!\n. Thank you!\n. Thanks for opening.\n\nCan you try the master branch and see if the commit I just pushed fixes the issue?\n. Great. Heads up that I just pushed out freezegun `0.3.3` with the fix.\n. #WontFix\n. Thanks for opening. You are correct. Should be fixed now.\n. Agh, thanks. Added.\n. Thanks for opening!\n\nCan you test now with the latest commit on `master`? I think it is solved.\n. I just pushed out `0.3.4` for anyone that does need this fix.\n. Which version of freezegun are you on? We've had this issue in the past, but I thought it was fixed with https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/issues/13\n. I think Pandas does some C-level manipulation or use of the datetime/time modules. I've dug into it a bit, but not found a way that we could work around it.\n. Thanks for opening! I have recreated the issue.\n\nThis is a result of a performance improvement that was made with https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/commit/ac163a5c534b4728bd082d3f67d956b1df71f04c. Clearly we will need to rethink a better way to do that.\n\nFor now, you can try using an older version.\n. @UberFarmer  Do you have a test case for it breaking on 0.2.3? My test cases all pass on 0.2.5\n\n(obviously we still need to fix in master too, but I just want to ensure I understand the issue fully)\n. this should be fixed with #119 \n. Thanks, I changed it to `assert datetime.date.today() == datetime.date(2012, 01, 13)` which seems the clearest.\n. The easiest workaround for now is to pass the [`ignore` parameter](https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/blob/master/freezegun/api.py#L372-L385) with the deprecated modules. That obviously isn't ideal, but I don't have a better answer right now.\n\nSuggestions welcome.\n. Thanks for the push, I was being lazy\n. This is great. Thanks for the help!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Ah, good catch\n. Looks great. `tick` is perfect.\n. Thanks!\n. Great, thanks!\n. Looks like this caused some issues with the tests\n. Thanks!\n. You can access `freezegun.api.real_datetime` to get the real datetime class. You can also grab an alias to the datetime class before patching.\n. Thanks for opening!\n. I have confirmed this is a bug. Due to how time is mocked (compared to datetime), the fix is going to take a bit of work.\n. No progress, feel free to take a stab at it.\n. Thanks for this!\n\nThe test seems to be that newer Coverage versions don't support python 3.2. I've fixed in master.\n. agreed\n. Any idea how ZODB gets the time? Unfortunately, if it makes a system call for this we won't be able to do anything.\n. Thank you!\n. thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. thanks!\n. Fixed with https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/pull/125\n. Decided to merge https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/pull/125 instead, because I'm not quite ready for a release yet.\n. thanks!\n. This seems like either a bug in cffi or `dir`, right? Is it an expected case that `dir` will raise this type of error?\n. This appears to be fixed in `cffi > 1.5.2` according to #126 \n. Thanks!\n. Closed with #135 \n. thanks!\n. thanks!\n. `0.3.7` is now available\n. Going to close this for now since I haven't responded in a long time (my bad).\r\n\r\nIf you are still interested: I don't exactly understand the use case here. When do we want to freeze a short distance in the future? Just trying to figure out if the use-case is common enough to add support.\r\n. Okay, that makes sense. Can you add a test? I'll be happy to merge.. Hmmm, they seem to be working for me. Are you on master?\r\n\r\nTravis ran them without issue: https://travis-ci.org/spulec/freezegun/builds/199854719. thanks!\n. No update from me. Would be open to someone taking this and running with it.. Yes, this is fixed in master with https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/pull/135. I'll hopefully be able to get a new release out soon.\n. `0.3.7` is now available.\n. Hmmm, I get the same TypeError even without freezegun. Are you on the newest freezegun and pytz? What version of python?\n. thanks!\n. `0.3.7` is now available\n. Agreed, would be happy to accept a PR.\n. Just to make sure I understand, you want to patch the `datetime` module, but not the `time` module?\n. Great, thanks!\n. thanks!\n. I can't seem to find this method in the python documentation (https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html).\n. Oh, my bad. I just haven't pushed out a new release yet. Feel free to install from Github and I should be getting a new release out soon.\n. Version 0.3.8 is now released. thanks!\n. Version 0.3.8 has been released. Does calling `dir(py.test.cmdline)` throw an exception?\n. Can someone give me a script to recreate this so I can try to dig more?. Do you know how JWT creates the expires datetime?\n. Thanks for opening.\r\n\r\nI believe this is a dupe of https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/issues/89. A solution is at https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/pull/136, but it hasn't been merged in yet.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close, but feel free to reopen if you think my assessment is wrong.. Thanks for opening. This is an interesting issue.\n\nReading through the [`uuid1` code](https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/default/Lib/uuid.py), it seems to not work when moving time backwards. Notice how `_last_timestamp` is used.\n\nI suppose we could file a bug with python. I'm not sure if they will consider this a valid use case.\n\nYou can work around this by setting `uuid._last_timestamp = None`. \n. This should now be fixed with #172. Is this necessary? Should we ever be calling `_time_to_freeze` if there isn't `cls.times_to_freeze`?\n. I'm trying to figure out the scenario in which this happens. Do you have a test to reproduce the issue?\n. thanks!. Version `0.3.9` is now released!. Thanks!\n. I've just released `0.3.8`.\n\nYes, that is the correct way to use it.\n. I don't know of a way to make this work. I'm going to close, but feel free to reopen if there is a possible solution here.. Thanks!\n. Excellent, thank you!\n. Great, thank you!\n. Going to close this for now. Feel free to rebase and add some tests and I'd be happy to help get this merged.. Thanks!\n. Thanks for the suggestion. Added. Yes, I believe @romgar is correct. Going to close this, but feel free to reopen if something else comes up.. Thanks!. Hmmmm.\r\n\r\nTwo possible solutions:\r\n\r\n1). It looks like pg8000 has a list of types that it can accept `self.py_types`. You could try appending the freezegun class to that list.\r\n\r\n2). If you do `from freezegun.api import real_date`, you can get access to the real date module to do any casting you need.\r\n\r\nLet me know if neither of those work. I can't think of a way to make this work by default.. I've added python 3.6 to Travis and everything seems to be passing. https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/commit/88f69903b3ac66b3894be00ef89d597e34f88f5e\r\n\r\nI'm struggling to recreate this issue. Anything else that might be different about your environment?. Great, thank you!. A bit unintuitive, but we use requirements.txt for dev requirements and prod requirements are in the setup.py: https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/blob/master/setup.py#L8-L12. Freezegun isn't designed to work like this. You will need to get the original freeze_time instance back to disable the freezing. Can you store the freeze_time instance as a global somehow so that it can be accessed in the place where you want to stop freezing?. No problem.. I can't think of any way to do this. Pytest seems to evaluate the function before running the test.\r\n\r\nFeel free to reopen if you can think of another way.. Thanks, will work on getting a new release out.. How are you using freezegun (decorator, context manager, raw use)?. If you look at the traceback, you can see that the freezegun exception is happening only after another exception already happened: `KeyError: 'modification'`\r\n\r\nIdeally, freezegun would always be able to cleanup, but if it is being used in the raw use mode, I'm not sure how that will be possible.\r\n. Ah, got it. I am confused then. Can you throw some print statements inside of the freezegun `start` and `stop` to see if they are unbalanced?. I'm a bit confused. In the `test_offset`, you are now passing a `tz_offset`, but only changing the first assertion.. Is this the same as #89?. It seems that `pytest.mark.asyncio` is skipping the decorator? Any more insight into what it is doing?. I believe this is a duplicate of https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/issues/89\r\n\r\nLet me know if you don't think that is the case.. If it doesn't work, I'd be happy to accept a PR to make it work. It seems like a reasonable use case.. Fixed with #187. Yes, I think this change isn't necessary. Are you seeing any issues without the change?. I'm debating if we should find a more extensible way to do this. The idea of maintaining a list of all modules that might need real time modules doesn't seem ideal.. Awesome work, thank you!. From what I can see, this is freezegun behaving in the expected manner. Yes, you will need to unfreeze if you want time to progress.\r\n\r\nPlease reopen if I am misunderstanding.. Can you confirm what version of freezegun you are using?\r\n\r\nThe tests that use this code are passing on Travis: https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/blob/master/tests/test_datetimes.py#L64-L77\r\n\r\nAny idea what else about your environment would be different?. See here: https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/issues/176. Hmmm, that doesn't seem right. Here is an example of the test generally working: https://github.com/spulec/freezegun/blob/master/tests/test_datetimes.py#L64-L77\r\n\r\nCan you give more details of your model files or anything else? Anywhere you might accidentally be casting to a date?. Thanks for opening this.\r\n\r\nCan you talk more about the use case? It isn't clear to me why it makes more sense to have two entry points.. thanks!. My guess is that it won't do any of that stuff, but I can't say that I've tested it.. Hmmmmm..... that doesn't seem great :/\r\n\r\nCan you add some print/log statements inside of freezegun on `start` and `stop`? Somehow the internal state of the freezegun stack is getting messed up and it is doesn't have a datetime to return.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if you think you can reproduce a small test case that would be helpful (though I know that can be hard with a real django project like that).. Thanks for opening.\r\n\r\nOne interesting thing: this works if you change `frozenat` to something like `2017-01-01 01:23:45`. I've dug a bit, but I'm not sure why changing that would break the unpatching of uuid.. It seems the tests are failing in a recursive loop. Any idea why?. Awesome, thanks!. I believe that version hasn't been released yet. Will hopefully get it out soon.. ",

Hi again Steve,\n\nThink there might still be a problem with how the instances are resolved to classes. E.g. I think `isinstance(myFakeDatetime, datetime.datetime)` is True because datetime.datetime gets assigned to FakeDatetime.\n\nWhen used in conjunction with something like dateutils there's an inconsistency as to what datetime.datetime is.

Maybe it's not clear where freezegun should be imported to avoid that but for now I have monkeypatched the to_python to check for both freezegun and real datetime objects.\n. @lorin it ain't pretty but it works for me...\n\nnot sure if there's a more elegant way of getting around an isinstance() check in the original code...\n\n```\nimport datetime\nimport freezegun\nimport logging\nimport warnings\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.db.models.fields import DateField, DateTimeField\nfrom django.utils import timezone\n\nlog = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n\ndef monkeypatch_fields_for_freezegun():\n    _original_datefield_to_python = DateField.to_python\n    _original_datetimefield_to_python = DateTimeField.to_python\n\n    log.warn(\"monkey patching Django Date fields for freezegun support\")\n\n    def _datefield_to_python(self, value):\n        if isinstance(value, freezegun.api.real_datetime):\n            if settings.USE_TZ and timezone.is_aware(value):\n                # Convert aware datetimes to the default time zone\n                # before casting them to dates (#17742).\n                default_timezone = timezone.get_default_timezone()\n                value = timezone.make_naive(value, default_timezone)\n            return value.date()\n        if isinstance(value, freezegun.api.real_date):\n            return value\n        return _original_datefield_to_python(self, value)\n\n    def _datetimefield_to_python(self, value):\n        if isinstance(value, freezegun.api.real_datetime):\n            return value\n        if isinstance(value, freezegun.api.real_date):\n            value = datetime.datetime(value.year, value.month, value.day)\n            if settings.USE_TZ:\n                # For backwards compatibility, interpret naive datetimes in\n                # local time.

Ah, okay. Feel free to close :). No problem. Feel like making a new release? :)\n. :+1: \n. I was testing something based on relative times (a cron-ish type thing...) so it would express the intention of the test far, far better and more succinctly to specify the timedelta rather than calculate the values. Please could you reconsider? :). Sure\u2026 however, I'm seeing a bunch of test failures already so probably isn't a good time to add tests:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrm -f .coverage\r\nnosetests

Also, when doing local dev I needed to manually run `pip install python-dateutil`, its not in requirements.  Not sure if this is intentional.. It \"fakes\" the`isinstance(obj, _class)` check for the `FakeDate` class when `FakeDate` is used as the class argument.  For example:\r\n\r\n    isinstance(real_date(2017,1,1), FakeDate) -> True (but its clearly not!)\r\n\r\nI suppose you could throw an exception in there or use pdb.set_trace() and see what tests/code causes that to be executed. \r\n\r\nFor a more complete example:\r\n```\r\nclass F1(real_date):\r\n    pass\r\nclass F2(with_metaclass(FakeDateMeta, real_date)):\r\n    pass\r\n\r\nf1 = F1(2017, 1, 1)\r\nf2 = F2(2017, 1, 1)\r\n\r\n>   isinstance(real_date(2017,1,1,), F2): True  # calls F2.metaclass.__instancecheck__\r\n>   isinstance(real_date(2017,1,1,), F1): False\r\n>   isinstance(f1, F2): True   # calls __instancecheck__, f1 is a datetime so it passes\r\n>   isinstance(f2, F2): True\r\n```\r\n\r\nOk, I guess that makes sense now that I think about it for a few minutes and read the code... \ud83d\ude1e \r\n\r\nLater on in actually setting up the module we have this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Change the modules\r\ndatetime.datetime = FakeDatetime\r\ndatetime.date = FakeDate\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo `Freezegun` changes the datetime module and inserts itself as **the class** that gets used when you make a date/datetime, transparently.
