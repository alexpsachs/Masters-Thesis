Updated by mikechambers on 2007-01-10T04:51:23\n\nHere is the RFC:\n\nhttp://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt?number=4627\n\nI cant find any mention of dates.\n\nHere is a page from mozilla's thoughts on EcmaScript 4 and JSON:\n\nhttp://developer.mozilla.org/es4/proposals/json_encoding_and_decoding.html\n\nSpecifically, it mentions:\n\n## \n\n```\n*\n  Date.prototype.toJSONString()\n```\n\nReturns a String containing the representation of a date. A Date object is serialized\n\n## as an ISO date string in double quotes. \n\nSo, I think it is very important that we follow whatever the \"standard\" is. There are\nalready alternate implementations, which could result in incompatible versions of JSON.\n\nI will ping Douglas Crockford, and see if they have any definitive thoughts on date\nserialization in JSON.\n. Updated by mikechambers on 2007-01-10T05:07:34\n\nThe latest JSON.js file (from December 6, 2006), has support for Dates:\n\nhttp://www.json.org/json.js\n\nIt uses ISO 8601\n\nhttp://www.iso.org/iso/en/prods-services/popstds/datesandtime.html\n\nWe have some Data format functions in DateUtils\n\nhttp://as3corelib.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/com/adobe/utils/DateUtil.as\n\nbut unfortunately, dont have ISO 8601\n. Updated by wmdmark on 2007-05-01T03:38:49\n\nAre there any work arounds for this? I'm needing to parse dates from a JSON feed in \na project I'm working on. The date value comes in from the server as \"new Date(-\n59011459200000)\"\n. Updated by wmdmark on 2007-05-01T03:39:45\n\nBTW, I'd be happy to help :)\n. Updated by kenlarkin on 2008-06-04T10:32:25\n\nuntil you resolve this you add this to JSONEncoder.as when checking the object o.\n\nelse if (o is Date)\n{\n    s = \"new Date(\" + o.time.toString() + \")\";\n    return s;  \n}\nelse // o is a class instance\n. Updated by alan.dur...@citi.com on 2008-06-05T12:58:12\n\nIt seems that a lot of implementations of JSON are using proprietary date formats to \nget around this issue. This kind of defeats the interoperability aim of JSON. I \nwould suggest that providing a default serializer/deserializer for dates with the \nability to insert or use a different one would be useful. In other words, provide an \ninterface like\nSerializeDate(param:Date):String\nIsDate(param:String):bool\nDeserializeDate(param:String):Date\nwhere the interface could be changed if the server side technology uses a different \nformat. \nLike wndmark, I'd be happy to help too.\n.

Updated by philoQE on 2007-04-12T18:52:52\n\nSorry - the case described here where the day doesn't make sense for the date is not\nthe core issue, we're concerned about it.  It's the issue of whether value is in a\nvalid range of acceptable values.  Such as 2 digits for a day or month.  Or a valid\nday of the week.

Updated by darron.schall on 2007-03-20T23:02:57\n\nThis isn't a bug -- the original JSON string that you're trying to use -\n[{BookTitle:\"JSON\", Name:\"Mat\"}] - is not correctly formatted JSON code.\n\nFrom json.org, an Object consists of pairs, where each pair is string:value.  The\nidentifier on the left of the pair then, being a string, needs to be enclosed in quotes.\n\nWhatever library your using to generate the JSON string is not producing\nJSON-compliant output.  Make sure that the name part of the name/value pairs inside\nof an object is getting correctly wrapped in quotes.\n\nOriginal ticket set status to Invalid (we converted to closed)\n.

In a recent project we had a JSON file that we handed off to the\nclient for them to make small changes.  They made said changes on a Windows machine\nwhich saved with DOS-style line endings (CRLF) which broke the  deserializer.  I'm\ncurrently getting around this by stripping out carriage returns manually (loop the\nloaded file and do jsonString.replace(\"\\r\", \"\") where jsonString is the data of the\nloaded file) before sending it to the deserializer.\n.

See we are working with\nMoodle and the MySql database doesn't allow for quoted values to be stored.

My JSON was improperly formed for this library and looked like this: \n\"{$name: \"jon\", $gender: \"male\"}\".  There were no quotes around the parameter names.  This style of JSON works \nfine in Javascript, where the whole thing is evaled, but with this library, all strings, even parameter names, need \nto be enclosed in quotes.  My JSON string properly formatted looks like this: \"{\"$name\": \"jon\", \"$gender\": \n\"male\"}\".  That properly formatted JSON will decode just fine.\n.

You can get the \nsame results as addSeparator and formatDecimal as well as rounding to n number of \ndecimal places all in a single call.\n\nNumberFormatter.format(p_num:Number, p_separator:String, p_decimalPlaces:Number=0, \np_decimal:String=\".\"):String\n@param p_num is the number to work on\n@param p_separator is the character to use as the thousands separator\n@param p_decimalPlaces is the number of decimal places to round the number to\n@param p_decimal is the character to use as the decimal\n\n// Sample Calls\nNumberFormatter.format(0.123456789, \" \", 5, \",\");   // output -- 0,12346\nNumberFormatter.format(-123456789, \",\", 5, \"_\");    // output -- -\n123,456,789_00000\nNumberFormatter.format(123456789, \"-\", 0, \",\");     // output -- 123-456-789\nNumberFormatter.format(123456789, \"-\");     // output -- 123-456-789\n\nIf just the thousands separator needs to be added\nNumberFormatter.format(-123456789, \",\");        // output -- -123,456,789\n\nIf just the decimal needs to change\nWhen p_decimalPlaces is set to -1 (negative one) the result is the same as calling \nthe formatDecimal function. The same number is returned with no rounding and just \nthe decimal character has been modified.\nNumberFormatter.format(0.123456789, \"\", -1, \",\");   // output -- 0,123456789\n\nIf the decimal needs to change and the number is rounded to n decimal places\nNumberFormatter.format(0.123456789, \"\", 5, \",\");    // output -- 0,12346\nNumberFormatter.format(-123456789, \"\", 2, \",\");     // output -- -123456789,00\n\nIf the thousands separator needs to be added and the decimal needs to change \nNumberFormatter.format(12345.6789, \" \", -1, \",\");   // output -- 12 345,68\n\nIf the thousands separator needs to be added and the decimal needs to change and the \nnumber must be rounded to n decimal places\nNumberFormatter.format(123456789, \" \", 2, \",\");     // output -- 123 456 789,00\nNumberFormatter.format(12345.6789, \" \", 2, \",\");    // output -- 12 345,68\n\nAll of the functions should work with positive and negative numbers.\nI think that about covers it.\n\nI'm fairly certain that parts of the format function could be optimized. I was just \ntoo lazy to figure out the RegExp calls. If anyone else would like to do some \noptimizing that would be great.\n\nI have attached the updated NumberFormatter.as file for submission into corelib.\n\n...Neil Madsen\n.

After this if /path/to/some/repo is exposed on the\nweb, users will be able to refer to that web URL (by defining a repository in their\nMaven project) and use as3corelib as a dependency in their Maven projects.\n\nTemporary work around is for users to install the file into their local Maven repository:\n\nmvn install:install-file \\\n    -Dfile=as3corelib.swc \\\n    -DgroupId=com.adobe \\\n    -DartifactId=as3corelib \\\n    -Dversion=0.92 \\\n    -Dpackaging=swc \\\n    -DgeneratePom=true \\\n    -DcreateChecksum=true\n.

Updated by kopchickm on 2010-03-03T16:50:25\n\n\u00ff\u00d8\u00ff\u00e0 is what is what you see when you trace out the encoded data, essentially the\ntoString().  if you trace out the length, you should see that the whole byte array is\nthere.\n. Updated by darron.schall on 2009-07-08T19:02:13\n\nMarking as not a bug because I believe this is working as expected.  Consider the following test:\n\n```\npublic function testDecodeStringWithEscapedBackslashAndNewLines():void\n{\n    // Contains escaped and unescaped LF\n    var innerString:String= \"line1\\nline2\\\\nmore line2\";\n    // Decode an object that has the inner string inside of it\n    var o:* = JSON.decode( JSON.encode( innerString ) );\n\n    assertEquals( innerString, o );\n}\n```\n\nThis test case passes.  The innerString value is exactly the same after going through an encode/decode \nprocess.\n\nIn your example, the reason you're seeing \"strange\" behavior is because the string is escaped before it has a \nchance to be decoded by the JSON library.  The string you're actually passing into JSON.decode looks like this:\n\n```\n\"line1{newline character}line2{backslash character}nline3\"\n```\n\nWhen the JSON decoder runs, it finds the backslash character immediately followed by an \"n\" and it converts \nthat to a {newline character}.  So, after the decode, the result ends up being: \n\"line1{newline}line2{newline}line3\".  That explains why the result differs from the original string you specified.\n\nRemember that a string must be properly encoded in order for it to be decoded correctly.\n\nAdded label json\nOriginal ticket set status to NotABug (we converted to open)\n. Updated by paleozogt on 2009-07-08T19:11:00\n\nSo what you're saying is that JSON.decode will accept malformed JSON?  Is that how it should work?  I \nthink its important that the decoder reject bad JSON.\n\nWe had a process that was emitting bad JSON (just like described in the bug).  JSON.decode would happily \naccept it.  It wasn't until we hooked up a java json decoder (which rejected the bad json) that we even \nrealized that there was a problem.\n. Updated by darron.schall on 2009-07-08T19:22:36\n\nI understand what you're saying now.  The JSON string \"line1{newline character}line2\" is technically malformed \nbecause the {newline character} is not escaped to \"\\n\".  The JSON decoder is not throwing an error when \nprocessing this malformed string.\n\nI'll update the tokenizer to throw a parse error in strict mode when unescaped control characters (\\u0000 \nthrough \\u001F) are found in strings.  \n\nIn non-strict mode, I won't change the behavior because the idea of the non-strict mode is to parse the JSON \nthe best that we can even if the string is malformed.\n\nAdded label Type-Defect\nOriginal ticket set status to Accepted (we converted to open)\n.

Updated by darron.schall on 2009-07-08T15:08:07\n\nCan you describe what you're interested in extending?  I'm hesitant to just generically move everything from \nprivate to protected.  \n\nIf I understood better what your end goals are, then I can determine which methods can be safely marked as \nprotected while still keeping the integrity of the library.\n\nAdded label json\n. Updated by wolever on 2009-07-08T19:28:44\n\nI want to extend the encoder/decoder and teach it how to serialize my custom classes (for example, so it will \nencode dates in a particular format).\n\nI'm curious, though, what you mean by \"keeping the integrity of the library\". What do you think would happen if \nmethods were protected instead of private?\n. Updated by darron.schall on 2009-07-08T20:16:09\n\nI think, in this case, it would be better to add hooks that you can extend for these particular areas.\n\nFor example, in JSONEncoder the convertToString() private method is a good one to mark as protected.  You \ncan extend this with code like:\n\nif ( value is Date )\n{\n    return customDateEncoder( value );\n}\nelse\n{\n   return super. convertToString( value );\n}\n\nHowever, a more complicated method such as objectToString shouldn't necessarily be easily extendable \nbecause there are no places to really change the behavior with a subclass.  JSON objects have to be encoded \nin a certain way, and trying to override this method would be difficult.  You would essentially have to just \"roll \nyou own\" anyway.  \n\nMaking convertToString() protected would enable this approach since you can decide in there whether or not \nyou want default functionality.\n\nThat's what I mean when I say \"keeping the integrity of the library\".  I think it's better to expose custom object \nserialize/deserialize hooks rather than generically make the guts of the library protected.  The library is \ndesigned around JSON syntax, so the extension points are really minimal here.\n\nUnforunately, the way the class is designed, it's hard to \"swap out\" which encoder/decoder you want to use \nbecause these are not parameterized in the static methods.  In the process of updating the library to support \nthis, it probably makes sense to add a parameter for encoderClass to JSON.encode that defaults to the current \nJSONEncoder so you can more easily swap out your own implementation should you want custom \nserialization.. something like:\n\npublic static function encode( o:Object, encoderClass:IJSONEncoder = null ):String\n\nLet me think about this some more.

Updated by wolever on 2009-07-09T14:38:56\n\nAgreed \u2013 convertToString would be a good place to allow overriding.\n\nI think I understand what you mean by \"keeping the integrity of the library\"... And although I would argue that \nit's still not strictly necessary (that is, it's better to warn the programmer that it's a bad idea to poke around \nhere, but still give them the option), I can also see some benefit to the added restriction. So I'll pipe down \nabout that :)\n\nAnd, yea \u2013 when I did my implementation, I ran into the same problem with the static methods. To get around \nit, I subclassed the JSON class... But that's not a great general \u2013 passing it as an argument does seem better.\n\nAnyway, thanks for your work on this library\u00a0\u2013 it's much appreciated.\n.

According to the RFC, whitespace is defined as:\n\nws = *(\n                %x20 /              ; Space\n                %x09 /              ; Horizontal tab\n                %x0A /              ; Line feed or New line\n                %x0D                ; Carriage return\n            )\n\nCharacter 160 is a non-breaking space, and not valid JSON whitespace.\n\nHowever, if the parser is used in non-strict mode then I can deal with this better by including the non-\nbreaking space as whitespace.\n\nAdded label strict\nOriginal ticket set status to Accepted (we converted to open)\n.

Updated by katopz on 2009-09-21T05:21:17\n\nfor me...i think better separate as fp9 and fp10 in trunk\nwe did it in away3d, and also jiglib (i just add fp10 today for jiglib)\nthb, we love Vector typed but client still love fp9 via IE6 ! ;p\n\nanother pros for separate fp9/fp10 is we can use them for speed comparison too ... :)\n. Updated by mitsuru.takeuchi on 2009-09-21T06:27:47\n\nI agree with katopz opinion, that separate as fp9 and fp10.\nSome developers may have some trouble, but I think it is nonsense not to create fp10 version of corelib for fp9.\n\nWe will be easier to induce to fp10 if clients have many benefits by using fp10. So I think corelib should be \nseparate as fp9 and fp10.\n. Updated by mikechambers on 2009-09-21T07:05:41\n\nOne thing to keep in mind, is that whatever we do, it has to be easy to maintain (as we have few people working \non the project).\n\nSo, I dont want to maintain two branches / versions and releases.\n. Updated by dittgen on 2009-09-21T07:12:57\n\nThis leads to the question: Is it possible to test for the FP version and offer\ndifferent implementations just in one version? In Javascript you can check if method\ndo exist and react otherwise in another way. Would this be possible with AS3 or would\ncode that's only supported by FP10 break up when compiling for FP9?\n. Updated by neuropro...@gmail.com on 2009-09-21T07:24:57\n\nIf you can't support 2 versions, leave the FP9 version as it is and go for FP10.

Maybe FP9 (this means, \"previous Flash Player version\") version of as3corelib will be added new features.\n2. I want to know the merit of new features.\n3. Because as3corelib is under new BSD license, other developers can develop previous version of Flash Player if \nneeded.\n.

I do not have Flex Builder nor FlexUnit, so I cannot\nverify with the proper setup. But if I write:\n\nJSON.decode( \"\\\"\\u0061\\\"\" )\n\nIt throws a runtime-error at me, so that test should definitely fail in any setup.\n\nCould you please execute this test in your local setup?

Updated by Touvan on 2010-03-03T19:35:51\n\nI did this in JSONTokenizer, though I'm sure a property with the line number and a way to append it in the \nparseError (where the rest of the message is constructed) call would be more appropriate. This worked for my \nneeds though.\n\npublic function parseError( message:String ):void {\n    throw new JSONParseError(\n        message + \" (line \" + jsonString.substring(0, loc).split(\"\\n\").length +\")\",\n            loc, jsonString\n    );\n}\n.

Fixed in commit 064139a0ce1e0422bb6e23a03614157bc8d00edb\n. This isn't a bug in the JSON decoder.  The behavior you are seeing stems from the use of a \"for..in\" loop to iterate over properties of an object.  Objects in AS3 are not \"ordered\".\n\nThe better way to encode this information would be to use an array [] instead of an object {}:\n. Does FlashDevelop provide a way to define compile-time constants used with MXMLC?  In FlashBuilder you can specify additional compiler arguments in the library propject properties in order to build.\n\nA few others have mentioned this as well.  It's a nice optimization but makes it hard for people to use the library as source because of the extra setup steps.\n\nI think the best solution is probably just to revert the change, and I'll create my own fork to include these optimizations.\n. I reverted the compile-time define change out.  The latest source can build without any additional setup required.  Change 24c6c16aecbf0d8fcc043ae671e689b0d4b4c559.\n. Hi Francis,\n\nFor those who want to leverage ActionJSON, they can simply head to the ActionJSON project itself.  It does not make sense to combine the projects at this point.\n\nThe as3corelib parser offers more flexibility which people have requested.  There are also ways to make it faster, specifically by removing a slow regular expression to test for correctness (note: the ActionJSON library does not pass all of the unit tests that as3corelib does - you can either choose robustness or speed).\n\nSee my notes about speed differences here: http://sites.google.com/a/darronschall.com/thoughts/home/2010-11-08-actionscript-3-json-libraries-and-as3corelib-json-updates\n.

I \nwould suggest that providing a default serializer/deserializer for dates with the \nability to insert or use a different one would be useful. In other words, provide an \ninterface like\nSerializeDate(param:Date):String\nIsDate(param:String):bool\nDeserializeDate(param:String):Date\nwhere the interface could be changed if the server side technology uses a different \nformat. \nLike wndmark, I'd be happy to help too.\n.

The\nidentifier on the left of the pair then, being a string, needs to be enclosed in quotes.\n\nWhatever library your using to generate the JSON string is not producing\nJSON-compliant output.  Make sure that the name part of the name/value pairs inside\nof an object is getting correctly wrapped in quotes.\n\nOriginal ticket set status to Invalid (we converted to closed)\n.

In a recent project we had a JSON file that we handed off to the\nclient for them to make small changes.  They made said changes on a Windows machine\nwhich saved with DOS-style line endings (CRLF) which broke the  deserializer.  I'm\ncurrently getting around this by stripping out carriage returns manually (loop the\nloaded file and do jsonString.replace(\"\\r\", \"\") where jsonString is the data of the\nloaded file) before sending it to the deserializer.\n.

However, as long as you're using properly formatted JSON you \nshouldn't run into trouble.\n\nI'm still debating if this is really worth implementing because it goes against JSON syntax (per es5 discussions).  \nIf a library claims to output JSON strings, then the library should be using quoted object keys.\n. Updated by evan_m...@sympatico.ca on 2009-07-13T14:21:08\n\n@darron - Oh ok, thank you very much for your prompt reply.  See we are working with\nMoodle and the MySql database doesn't allow for quoted values to be stored.

My JSON was improperly formed for this library and looked like this: \n\"{$name: \"jon\", $gender: \"male\"}\".  There were no quotes around the parameter names.  This style of JSON works \nfine in Javascript, where the whole thing is evaled, but with this library, all strings, even parameter names, need \nto be enclosed in quotes.  My JSON string properly formatted looks like this: \"{\"$name\": \"jon\", \"$gender\": \n\"male\"}\".  That properly formatted JSON will decode just fine.\n.

Updated by trimediapro on 2008-07-07T01:52:11\n\nHere's what I put together. \n\nI have add in 3 static functions to NumberFormatter\naddSeparator(p_num:Number, p_separator:String):String\nformatDecimal(p_num:Number, p_decimal:String=\".\", p_decimalPlaces:Number=0):String\nformat(p_num:Number, p_separator:String, p_decimalPlaces:Number=0, \np_decimal:String=\".\"):String\n\nHere are some examples and a basic explanation of all 3.\n\nThe \"addSeparator\" function is for adding a \"thousands separator\" into a number.\nThis function will return the same number (as a String) but with the new thousands \nseparator that was specified.  \n// Sample Calls\nNumberFormatter.addSeparator(-12198.12345, \",\"); // output -- -12,198.12345\nNumberFormatter.addSeparator(1000000.00, \" \");   // output -- 1 000 000.00\n\nThe \"formatDecimal\" function is for doing just that. \nThis function will return the same number (as a String) but with the new decimal \ncharacter that was specified.  \n// Sample Calls\nNumberFormatter.formatDecimal(0.1983567, \",\");  // output -- 0,1983567 \nNumberFormatter.formatDecimal(198.3567, \",\");   // output -- 198,3567 \n\nThe \"format\" function of the NumberFormatter is much more versatile. You can get the \nsame results as addSeparator and formatDecimal as well as rounding to n number of \ndecimal places all in a single call.\n\nNumberFormatter.format(p_num:Number, p_separator:String, p_decimalPlaces:Number=0, \np_decimal:String=\".\"):String\n@param p_num is the number to work on\n@param p_separator is the character to use as the thousands separator\n@param p_decimalPlaces is the number of decimal places to round the number to\n@param p_decimal is the character to use as the decimal\n\n// Sample Calls\nNumberFormatter.format(0.123456789, \" \", 5, \",\");   // output -- 0,12346\nNumberFormatter.format(-123456789, \",\", 5, \"_\");    // output -- -\n123,456,789_00000\nNumberFormatter.format(123456789, \"-\", 0, \",\");     // output -- 123-456-789\nNumberFormatter.format(123456789, \"-\");     // output -- 123-456-789\n\nIf just the thousands separator needs to be added\nNumberFormatter.format(-123456789, \",\");        // output -- -123,456,789\n\nIf just the decimal needs to change\nWhen p_decimalPlaces is set to -1 (negative one) the result is the same as calling \nthe formatDecimal function. The same number is returned with no rounding and just \nthe decimal character has been modified.\nNumberFormatter.format(0.123456789, \"\", -1, \",\");   // output -- 0,123456789\n\nIf the decimal needs to change and the number is rounded to n decimal places\nNumberFormatter.format(0.123456789, \"\", 5, \",\");    // output -- 0,12346\nNumberFormatter.format(-123456789, \"\", 2, \",\");     // output -- -123456789,00\n\nIf the thousands separator needs to be added and the decimal needs to change \nNumberFormatter.format(12345.6789, \" \", -1, \",\");   // output -- 12 345,68\n\nIf the thousands separator needs to be added and the decimal needs to change and the \nnumber must be rounded to n decimal places\nNumberFormatter.format(123456789, \" \", 2, \",\");     // output -- 123 456 789,00\nNumberFormatter.format(12345.6789, \" \", 2, \",\");    // output -- 12 345,68\n\nAll of the functions should work with positive and negative numbers.\nI think that about covers it.\n\nI'm fairly certain that parts of the format function could be optimized. I was just \ntoo lazy to figure out the RegExp calls. If anyone else would like to do some \noptimizing that would be great.\n\nI have attached the updated NumberFormatter.as file for submission into corelib.\n\n...Neil Madsen\n.

Updated by kopchickm on 2010-03-03T16:50:25\n\n\u00ff\u00d8\u00ff\u00e0 is what is what you see when you trace out the encoded data, essentially the\ntoString().  if you trace out the length, you should see that the whole byte array is\nthere.\n. Updated by darron.schall on 2009-07-08T19:02:13\n\nMarking as not a bug because I believe this is working as expected.  Consider the following test:\n\n```\npublic function testDecodeStringWithEscapedBackslashAndNewLines():void\n{\n    // Contains escaped and unescaped LF\n    var innerString:String= \"line1\\nline2\\\\nmore line2\";\n    // Decode an object that has the inner string inside of it\n    var o:* = JSON.decode( JSON.encode( innerString ) );\n\n    assertEquals( innerString, o );\n}\n```\n\nThis test case passes.  The innerString value is exactly the same after going through an encode/decode \nprocess.\n\nIn your example, the reason you're seeing \"strange\" behavior is because the string is escaped before it has a \nchance to be decoded by the JSON library.  The string you're actually passing into JSON.decode looks like this:\n\n```\n\"line1{newline character}line2{backslash character}nline3\"\n```\n\nWhen the JSON decoder runs, it finds the backslash character immediately followed by an \"n\" and it converts \nthat to a {newline character}.  So, after the decode, the result ends up being: \n\"line1{newline}line2{newline}line3\".  That explains why the result differs from the original string you specified.\n\nRemember that a string must be properly encoded in order for it to be decoded correctly.\n\nAdded label json\nOriginal ticket set status to NotABug (we converted to open)\n. Updated by paleozogt on 2009-07-08T19:11:00\n\nSo what you're saying is that JSON.decode will accept malformed JSON?  Is that how it should work?  I \nthink its important that the decoder reject bad JSON.\n\nWe had a process that was emitting bad JSON (just like described in the bug).  JSON.decode would happily \naccept it.  It wasn't until we hooked up a java json decoder (which rejected the bad json) that we even \nrealized that there was a problem.\n. Updated by darron.schall on 2009-07-08T19:22:36\n\nI understand what you're saying now.  The JSON string \"line1{newline character}line2\" is technically malformed \nbecause the {newline character} is not escaped to \"\\n\".  The JSON decoder is not throwing an error when \nprocessing this malformed string.\n\nI'll update the tokenizer to throw a parse error in strict mode when unescaped control characters (\\u0000 \nthrough \\u001F) are found in strings.  \n\nIn non-strict mode, I won't change the behavior because the idea of the non-strict mode is to parse the JSON \nthe best that we can even if the string is malformed.\n\nAdded label Type-Defect\nOriginal ticket set status to Accepted (we converted to open)\n.

Updated by darron.schall on 2009-07-08T15:08:07\n\nCan you describe what you're interested in extending?  I'm hesitant to just generically move everything from \nprivate to protected.  \n\nIf I understood better what your end goals are, then I can determine which methods can be safely marked as \nprotected while still keeping the integrity of the library.\n\nAdded label json\n. Updated by wolever on 2009-07-08T19:28:44\n\nI want to extend the encoder/decoder and teach it how to serialize my custom classes (for example, so it will \nencode dates in a particular format).\n\nI'm curious, though, what you mean by \"keeping the integrity of the library\". What do you think would happen if \nmethods were protected instead of private?\n. Updated by darron.schall on 2009-07-08T20:16:09\n\nI think, in this case, it would be better to add hooks that you can extend for these particular areas.\n\nFor example, in JSONEncoder the convertToString() private method is a good one to mark as protected.  You \ncan extend this with code like:\n\nif ( value is Date )\n{\n    return customDateEncoder( value );\n}\nelse\n{\n   return super. convertToString( value );\n}\n\nHowever, a more complicated method such as objectToString shouldn't necessarily be easily extendable \nbecause there are no places to really change the behavior with a subclass.  JSON objects have to be encoded \nin a certain way, and trying to override this method would be difficult.  You would essentially have to just \"roll \nyou own\" anyway.  \n\nMaking convertToString() protected would enable this approach since you can decide in there whether or not \nyou want default functionality.\n\nThat's what I mean when I say \"keeping the integrity of the library\".  I think it's better to expose custom object \nserialize/deserialize hooks rather than generically make the guts of the library protected.  The library is \ndesigned around JSON syntax, so the extension points are really minimal here.\n\nUnforunately, the way the class is designed, it's hard to \"swap out\" which encoder/decoder you want to use \nbecause these are not parameterized in the static methods.  In the process of updating the library to support \nthis, it probably makes sense to add a parameter for encoderClass to JSON.encode that defaults to the current \nJSONEncoder so you can more easily swap out your own implementation should you want custom \nserialization.. something like:\n\npublic static function encode( o:Object, encoderClass:IJSONEncoder = null ):String\n\nLet me think about this some more.  It warrants some discussion, and would probably be better discussed on \nthe mailing list.\n\nAdded label Type-Enhancement\n. Updated by wolever on 2009-07-09T14:38:56\n\nAgreed \u2013 convertToString would be a good place to allow overriding.\n\nI think I understand what you mean by \"keeping the integrity of the library\"... And although I would argue that \nit's still not strictly necessary (that is, it's better to warn the programmer that it's a bad idea to poke around \nhere, but still give them the option), I can also see some benefit to the added restriction. So I'll pipe down \nabout that :)\n\nAnd, yea \u2013 when I did my implementation, I ran into the same problem with the static methods. To get around \nit, I subclassed the JSON class... But that's not a great general \u2013 passing it as an argument does seem better.\n\nAnyway, thanks for your work on this library\u00a0\u2013 it's much appreciated.\n.

Updated by flashtronaut on 2009-09-23T23:06:33\n\nI updated my update :)\nI added a method called \"callbackRetrieve\" that works exactly the same as the normal \n\"retrieve\" except that it takes a callback function as an extra argument and it calls \nthat callback function with the loaded file as an argument once the file is ready.\n\nSince each callbackRetrieve method creates a unique loader instance, it may be used \nto simultaneously retrieve multiple files without having to think about which file is \nready once the ResourceCache dispatched an ITEM_READY event.\n\nAlso added functionality to clean up and remove each loader instance once it's no \nlonger needed.\n. Updated by flashtronaut on 2009-09-24T14:38:58\n\nI added some description of the changes I made on my blog:\nhttp://blog.flashtronaut.com/2009/09/24/contribution-to-the-as3corelib-resourcecache-\nclass/\n. Updated by tjconsult on 2010-01-19T07:11:05\n\nI was about to include _as3_corelib in an ActionScript-only project of ours, but that's not an option because of \nthis and other flex dependencies (see also \nhttp://code.google.com/p/as3corelib/source/browse/trunk/src/com/adobe/air/logging/FileTarget.as). Because \nof the naming of this library, I presumed one of the rationales behind this project was independence of Flex. Flex \nalso has its own PNG encoder implementation and probably other overlapping functionality.\n\nIn the context of a single commit in the last 4 months, does it make sense to provide patches with the hope of \ninclusion?\n. Updated by mikechambers on 2009-11-19T15:20:07\n\nFixed in commit 113\n\nOriginal ticket set status to Fixed (we converted to closed)\n. Updated by darron.schall on 2010-01-06T14:42:51\n\nWould you be willing to submit a patch that contains the unit test to demonstrate the behavior, as well as the \ncorrection to the line of code you indicated about?\n\nThe new unit test should show that scenario 1b is currently failing, and then after making the change to the \ntokenizer the test (and all other pre-existing tests) should pass.\n. Updated by morten.barklund on 2010-01-11T15:52:36\n\nYou actually already have a test for it:\n\nhttp://code.google.com/p/as3corelib/source/browse/trunk/tests/src/com/adobe/serialization/json/JSONTest.as#115\n\nThis test should fail currently. I do not have Flex Builder nor FlexUnit, so I cannot\nverify with the proper setup. But if I write:\n\nJSON.decode( \"\\\"\\u0061\\\"\" )\n\nIt throws a runtime-error at me, so that test should definitely fail in any setup.\n\nCould you please execute this test in your local setup? Maybe there is a problem with\nthe test-case not catching the error properly, and thus it seems like the whole\ntest-case works as it never asserts some false.\n\nBut in fact the function testDecodeStringWithInvalidUnicodeEscape throws an error.\n. Updated by Touvan on 2010-02-17T21:54:32\n\noh, or maybe JSONTokenizer.as\n. Updated by Touvan on 2010-03-03T19:35:51\n\nI did this in JSONTokenizer, though I'm sure a property with the line number and a way to append it in the \nparseError (where the rest of the message is constructed) call would be more appropriate. This worked for my \nneeds though.\n\npublic function parseError( message:String ):void {\n    throw new JSONParseError(\n        message + \" (line \" + jsonString.substring(0, loc).split(\"\\n\").length +\")\",\n            loc, jsonString\n    );\n}\n. This was fixed in commit 064139a0ce1e0422bb6e23a03614157bc8d00edb\n. Updated by gae.local.test on 2010-07-12T05:41:54\n\nI made copy and paste errors.  The only thing that is wrong with the string it prints out is the missing colon after the drive letter.  I can't edit my post to fix it.\n. Related to #63\n. Fixed in commit 064139a0ce1e0422bb6e23a03614157bc8d00edb\n. This isn't a bug in the JSON decoder.  The behavior you are seeing stems from the use of a \"for..in\" loop to iterate over properties of an object.  Objects in AS3 are not \"ordered\".\n\nThe better way to encode this information would be to use an array [] instead of an object {}:\n. Does FlashDevelop provide a way to define compile-time constants used with MXMLC?  In FlashBuilder you can specify additional compiler arguments in the library propject properties in order to build.\n\nA few others have mentioned this as well.  It's a nice optimization but makes it hard for people to use the library as source because of the extra setup steps.\n\nI think the best solution is probably just to revert the change, and I'll create my own fork to include these optimizations.\n. I reverted the compile-time define change out.  The latest source can build without any additional setup required.  Change 24c6c16aecbf0d8fcc043ae671e689b0d4b4c559.\n. Hi Francis,\n\nFor those who want to leverage ActionJSON, they can simply head to the ActionJSON project itself.  It does not make sense to combine the projects at this point.\n\nThe as3corelib parser offers more flexibility which people have requested.  There are also ways to make it faster, specifically by removing a slow regular expression to test for correctness (note: the ActionJSON library does not pass all of the unit tests that as3corelib does - you can either choose robustness or speed).\n\nSee my notes about speed differences here: http://sites.google.com/a/darronschall.com/thoughts/home/2010-11-08-actionscript-3-json-libraries-and-as3corelib-json-updates\n.

    "demauk": "For me, converting XML to JSON has three major issues to be resolved: a) what do to about the XML root element name? b) how to encode attributes? c) how to encode text nodes when the parent element has attributes or other element children? \n\nTo that end, I added an xmlToString() function to JSONEncoder and a JSONEncoderXMLOptions class as an optional parameter to the JSONEncoder constructor. Let's say you have this XML:\n\n``` xml\n<root>\n  <category>Sci-Fi</category>\n  <books>\n    <book id=\"1\">Text for Book 1</book>\n    <book id=\"2\">Text for Book 2</book>\n  </books>\n</root>\n```\n\n#### Option `omitRootElement:Boolean;`\n\nSometimes you want the JSON version to simply be `{ \"books\" : [ etc. ] }`. And sometimes you want everything: `{ \"root\" : { \"books\" : [ etc. ] } }`.\n\n#### Option `useAttributeAtSymbol:Boolean`\n\nDefaults to `true`. Determines whether or not attributes should be encoded with an @ sign at the beginning, like `\"@id\" : \"1\"` I think this should be standard, but I've set it as an option because I've seen implementations where they don't use @. IMO, if you can't differentiate attributes, you can't turn the JSON back into XML.\n\n#### Option `defaultSimpleContentLabel:String`\n\nDefaults to `#text`. A simple element like `<category>` can have its text node as its only value, like `\"category\" : \"Sci-Fi\"`. But the text node of `<book>` needs its own property name, which in this case would look like: `\"book\" : { \"@id\" : \"1\", \"#text\" : \"Text for Book 1\" }`.\n\nOther implementations use \"label\" but that's already a common property name for many actionscript objects.\n\nI'll see if I can offer a patch, at least as a reference.\n. I've pushed my changes to my fork: https://github.com/demauk/as3corelib/tree/master/src/com/adobe/serialization/json\n\nThere are kind of a lot of changes in that one commit. Sorry about that.\n. `JSONEncoder.xmlToString()` in this commit ignores XML attributes. There's no standard way to stringify them.\n\n```\n<item id=\"1\">\n    <data>datastring</data>\n</item>\n```\n\nCould be implemented as:\n\n```\nitem : { \n  'id' : '1',\n  'data' : 'datastring'\n}\n```\n\nOr:\n\n```\nitem : { \n    '@id' : '1',\n    'data' : 'datastring'\n}\n```\n\nAnother sticky point is an XML node with simple content and attributes. In the previous example the simple content was the sole text child of the `<data>` element. But consider this:\n\n```\n<item id=\"1\">\n  datastring\n</item>\n```\n\nAgain, there is no standard. I've seen this:\n\n```\nitem : {\n  '@id' : '1',\n  'label' : 'datastring'\n}\n```\n\nAnd this:\n\n```\nitem : {\n  '@id' : '1',\n  '#text' : 'datastring'\n}\n```\n\nSo, there should probably be an options object that can be passed to `JSON.encode()`, or directly to `JSONEncoder()` constructor, perhaps with this default content:\n\n```\nxmlEncodingOptions = {\n  omitXmlRoot = true,\n  useAttributeAtSymbol = true,\n  defaultSimpleContentLabel = \"label\"\n}\n```\n\nI'll see about these changes and issue another pull request with my example implementation.\n.
