If you want this in your app, go check out the source it's fairly self explanatory: https://github.com/RomainPiel/Titanic/tree/master/library/src/main/java/com/romainpiel/titanic/library\n. It's actually pretty doable with a custom drawable:\n- Take the code from `TitanicTextView` and move it to a new custom drawable class. (You might have to change a few overridden class to the appropriate ones)\n- Move the animation related code (from `TitanicTextView`) to a custom image view\n- Set the custom drawable to your custom image view\n- Animate all the things!\n\nSorry I don't have time to spend on that but play with the code it's really not complicated.\n.
