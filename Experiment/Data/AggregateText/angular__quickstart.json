Closing\n. beta.11 issue; closed by beta.12\n. Please provide specific repro.\n. closing for lack of repro or communication\n. Just tried with beta.13 and it works fine.\nAs @Foxandxss observes, you must add the **independent router library** to your `index.html`.\n\nPlease note that this is not a support site. Closing because there is no issue.\n. Sorry. I'm closing because what you're trying to do is out of scope for this repo. Not saying it's wrong. Just can't handle it here. Thanks.\n. This issue is out of scope for this repo. Happy to consider a PR that fixes it if not too involved.\n. Sorry but this is not a general support site and your question is out of scope. Closing.\n. Cloning with depth=0 causes other problems if you want to retain the remote. If you don't, delete `.git` as @Foxandxss says and carry on.\n. To be clear, the point of this repo is to make it easy for you to duplicate the end state of  the documented quick start.\n\nFrom there you can venture in new directions the same way the documented samples do. For they all begin on this quick start foundation.\n\nBecause we update it for each release, you can be sure that it always works.\n. Closing because the request is out of scope for this repo and we have no plans to pursue this request here.\n. Thanks for caring but ... please send PRs for substantive issue.\n. I agree that we shouldn't sell it as the ultimate anything. I like the mirroring statement.\n\nBut it is a viable starting place for experimental projects and I dont agree with pinning I to the samples or the ToH.\n\nWe should talk about why you think it should be so restrictive.\n. Sorry, dude.  I went a different direction with this. I am updating the README to make the limitations more clear.\n. closing because there is not defined, repeatable error here.\n. You are more likely to get an answer on stack overflow. This is NOT a support site.\n. What is the advantage? I already know `concurrently`. I don't know `npm-run-all`.  I see that the syntax is a little nicer but now I have to stop and vet that package. I'll keep this here for the future but it's not a priority.\n\nThanks for the suggestion. I'll get to it when I have time.\n. Aaargh!   Accidentally merged. I'm reverting. Sorry.\n. I created new PR #56 that revives your changes. Now I have to fix the other stuff I broke. Nightmare!\n\nAnyone. Will look again later.\n. Thanks, @kahlil, but we're going to stick with `concurrently`.\n\nHere's why (per one of our authors):\n\n## \n\nWe need functionality from `concurrently`. It's not just a matter or looking better.\n\nIt's the `--kill-others --success first` flags we added in PR #158 \n`--kill-others` will terminate the other processes when the first finishes\n`--success first` will give the status code of the first process to finish\n\nThese two together allow `concurrently \\\"http-server -s\\\" \\\"protractor protractor.config.js\\\" --kill-others --success first\"` which means \"run http-server and protractor at the same time, and once protractor is done kill off http-server\"\n. Added coincidentally as part of c18870fb02801c395bdba53e9d18cc7877c14fed\n. It's super annoying, Rick. I've complains to Typescript team that they really need to let us choose the severity.\n\nI am very open to an alternative suggestion\n. In the latest version, we run `tsc` FIRST and then concurrently `tsc:w` and `lite`.\n\nYes, that runs `twice` each time you start. But it avoids the race condition in which the server starts before the first tsc finishes.\n\nAnd if the first `tsc` fails, it aborts the entire task so the `concurrently ...` never happens. At least such has been my experience.\n. Closing because no action required here\n. Fixed coincidentally with beta.16\n. Fixed coincidentally with beta.16\n.

Hi Artem - I was wondering about whether it was better to let SystemJS load it or preload it. Thanks for clarifying.\n\nI'm holding back on putting this through because of major package movement expected this week. I'll catch up when that's over.\n. Changed it altogether for RC1; see #87.  It's even more chatty now but not sure what to do yet until we have a better bundle story. Closing this one.\n. Solved with 7a268b5aa692c5a37fa9f8309dc880c2ad229121\n. Thanks!\n. Should be fine now. Up to RC1 too\n. It's in now\n. Should work. Just tried it for RC1.  What version of node and npm are you using? \n\nThat link seems weird. Where did that come from?  I don't see the leading `@` in front of Angular\n\nYou can download that package specifically with https://registry.npmjs.org/@angular/common/-/common-2.0.0-rc.0.tgz\n\nClosing because can't repro\n. closed by 6c060f10\n. closed by 6c060f10\n. We have other bundling approaches in mind. System.js does understand commonjs format and we are standardizing on that so that we can define module-relative template and style urls in our components like this:\n\n```\n@Component({\n  selector: 'some-component',\n  moduleId: module.id, // commonjs reference to this module file\n  templateUrl: 'some-component.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['some-component.component.css']\n})\nexport class SomeComponent {...}\n```\n. Hi Mark!  By now I'm hoping you found Debora K who is working on that cookbook. Closing this comment as the idea really belongs on angular.io repo\n. Using the RC1 now. Should be installing `@angular/...`. Are you really using this quick start?\n. Snuck fix into #94\n. Thanks\n. I cannot explain your experience. But there is no doubt that this package exists and is loadable. Closing for lack of information that leads to this result.\n. I'm very sympathetic. I hate all those files too. I don't mind that you've proposed a solution. But I can't accept it as part of the quickstart because we have other plans for coping with this, even during development.  I'm so sorry.  Please keep contributing.\n. Using this quickstart repo product within the context of Visual Studio and an ASP.NET Core project is **_out of scope**_.\n\nWe are working on guidance for Visual Studio users. Look for a forthcoming \"Cookbook\" on that subject.\n\nI'm sorry but we simply cannot give you the help you require within this repo. \n. I'm sorry but you apparently do not understand the purpose of this repo.\n\nIt is supposed to be the end-state of the angular.io docs QuickStart and have almost no application content.  You should also explain your intention when creating a PR.\n. Closing because we're getting very far from the purpose of this repo, there is no actual diagnosis and no solution. Happy to look again when someone has a repro and an answer. No point in pretending we're going to do anything with this as it stands now.\n. Wow!  That is nice!  I'm going to try it out and, if it works as advertised, I'm doing it!  Thanks\n. Upon further examination, I don't think this will work for us. It presupposes the existence of a `package.json` with systemjs config in it and we don't have those. Notice also that we just switched to loading the umd scripts rather than the individual files.\n\nThanks for the intriguing suggestion. I regret we must decline.\n. I understand but the `main` is `index.js` and that is **_not**_ what we want to use, neither locally nor in plunkers. The `index.js` loads each source file individually. Look at the network tab; you'll see hundreds of requests for a \"hello, world\" app.\n\nI realize that it WAS what we wanted when you looked at the package. But it isn't anymore. We've switched to the umd packages.\n\nThanks again. I think we'll stick with our plan for now.\n. Yes ... hardcoded refs to `app` in karma-shim, wallaby, and systemjs.config\n. Please do not dump stack traces in here. It appears that your postinstall step failed. You can run `npm run typings install` separately.\n. Thanks. I was going to suggest that and you beat me to it.\n\nWe should call this out in angular.io on both the QS and npm packages pages. Maybe you did that too!\n. Thanks.  Merging.\n\nI tweaked your prose, corrected capitalization, relabeled as \"Prerequisites\" and moved it up as follows,\nLet's do the same in angular.io.\n\n---\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nNode.js and npm are essential to Angular 2 development. \n- We certify specific version &mdash; node `v5.x.x` and npm `3.x.x` &mdash; for this QuickStart. \n  Both older and newer versions produce errors.\n- We recommend [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for managing multiple versions of node and npm.\n. Closing because this seems \"solved\".\n\nPlease, people, do not paste entire console logs in comments. A little bit is sufficient. Thanks.\n. `node_modules` is automatically excluded unless you specify `files` or `excludes` in the tsconfig in which case you are on your own.\n\nClosing as your issue is old. Please re-open as a new issue if problem persists.\n. Please look at the more recent version which uses different polyfill. There is also a documentation page dedicated to polyfills.\n\nClosing as your issue is old. Please re-open as a new issue if problem persists.\n. Closing because this repo soon will no longer offer docker support (see PR #287). We think docker is great but it's a separate concern, apart from our goal of providing an _essential_ seed for Angular development that is consistent with the documentation sample. Docker would be good for a documentation cookbook.\n. Closing as your issue is old. Please re-open as a new issue if problem persists.\n. Closing as your issue is old. Please re-open as a new issue if problem persists.\n. Closing as your issue is old. Please re-open as a new issue if problem persists.\n. @psnider I wince as I read your perfectly reasonable questions. Our testing guide does not yet cover re-configuration of karma and systemjs for a different project structure. It's on our backlog.  Your questions here are helpful and will inform our effort to take this necessary next step.  What should you do for now?   Ah ... I'll be back ;-)\n. Thanks but your PR is pre-RC6 and we do not want to pin the npm versions as you propose.\n. That's a great question for angular.io. It is out-of-scope for quickstart. Closing\n. Sorry but we do not have enough information and there are many confusing parts to these two sentences. What is `@NgModel`? Do you mean `@NgModule`? What is `rootDir`?\n\nClosing as your issue is old. Please re-open as a new issue if problem persists.\n. Thanks ... but this file has changed substantially since your modification. Appreciate the help.\n. Testing has evolved since this issue was opened. Closing as out of date. Please re-open as a new issue if problem persists.\n. Closing because duplicates #211\n. Unfortunately this only works for quickstart. I'm having trouble making it work in a richer application.  I'm reaching out to wallaby for help.\n. Old. Not about QuickStart. Closing\n. `karma.conf` completely replaced as a result of Testing Chapter revisions. \n\nThese folders are not \"missing\".  It is expected that you will create them for your own helpers. They are harmless in this configuration when they don't exist.\n. You should not have to install it globally. Should work (and only work) with local install. Not having a linux box I am not able to help.\n. Closing because there is no action here that we can or will take. We are also discontinuing docker support in this repo because, however worthy, it is tangential to the fundamental purpose of a \"QuickStart seed\" and we cannot afford to support it.\n. Closing because it doesn't belong here in QuickStart\n. We moved to `@types`. \n. This is QuickStart, not Tour of Heroes. Sorry.\n. Ah. Sorry. We had to drop support for the `HTML-Reporter` which doesn't seem to work any more. I was disappointed. \n\nI just now updated the README to remove mention of it.\n. @ivaro18  Not sure if this is the cause but you're versions of node and npm are not supported.\n@raineeraj Do you get this immediately after cloning and doing an `npm install`?  It should work with your versions of node and npm.\n. Old. Closing. Please resubmit after updating your node version if the problem persists.\n. Are you doing more than simply running the QS app? The QS app doesn't use the router.\n\nIn my experience the `@angular/router` package is in `node_modules`.\n\nAh ... I suspect that you are unaware that ES import names are case-sensitive. The package is `@angular/router`, not `@angular/Router`.\n\nThis is an ES5 thing, not an Angular thing.\n. I'm sorry but your issue isn't a QuickStart repo issue; it belongs on GH angular.io. That's why I'm closing.\n. No one else has reported this (yet) and we don't have resources to pursue it. Maybe you can do some digging for us ... and the community.\n. You'll have to give us a repro.\n\nI just created `app/test/some.spec.ts` as\n\n```\nit('some test', () => {\n expect(true).toBe(true);\n});\n```\n\n... and ran `npm test`. Worked fine.\n\nBTW, we recommend putting specs next to the thing that they test. That means we generally don't need a separate `test` folder. When we do, it's usually for some deep integration test that crosscuts so many files that the spec doesn't seem to belong to any of them.\n\nI'll leave this open for a short while to give you a chance to comment or provide more of a repro\n. Your reply shows that you have taken your file structure in a direction that is completely different than the one proposed by the QuickStart.\n\nThat means it is out of scope for the quickstart.  I'm sorry but we don't have the time and resources to pursue this. Our narrow mission is to make the QS work _as written_.\n\nPerhaps you'll find the help you need on StackOverflow.\n. Duplicate of #241\n. Looks like you have a configuration conflict. Karma is looking for `/base/src/client/app/container/` but your file map says it should be `/base/src/client/container/` (no 'app/'). Is that the explanation?\n\nAlso beware of the other addresses to like \n\n```\n      var appAssets  = '/base/app/'; // component assets fetched by Angular's compiler\n\n      var testBase    = 'testing/';       // transpiled test JS and map files\n      var testSrcBase = 'testing/';       // test source TS files\n```\n. Can you \"Show all files\" and look for the hidden `node_modules` folder. Do you see the missing file inside `node_modules/@angular/core`? If not, it would seem that VS did not install node modules for you. It should have.  Please make sure that your Visual Studio is configured as described in the cookbook.\n\nI'm going to close this because it's really a problem related to the VS cookbook in angular.io, not this Getting Started repo.  If you can't solve it here, please raise an issue there.\n. Sorry but this really doesn't relate to QuickStart. More of a stackoverflow thing. Closing.\n. Closed by e33ed9a3adb1e1b9639bd16bcf27e621aba6e09\n. Thanks but superseded by e33ed9a3adb1e1b9639bd16bcf27e621aba6e092.\n\nThe `tsconfig.js` needed updating too and I bumped versions ... all in my own commit.\n. Sorry but we are removing docker artifacts from this repo very soon. We simply cannot support them and our goal is to simplify this repo ... a goal inconsistent with the docker effects. I think docker is great. But it should be a cookbook addition, not part of the QS distribution.\n\nSee PR #287 \n. ... namely that you surrounded the \"ctrl-c\" commands in backtacks.  Which is fine, thanks\n. Yes. Missed it before. Corrected by commit 541bdc5f634e1142860c56cace247234edfaf74b\n. That's great that you've done that for yourself. We have decide not to add AoT to this QS at this time.. @r105m The vulgarity in your comment is inconsistent with our usage policy. Coincidentally, this QS is certified for Chrome only.\n. The \"fix\" is for the problem of running e2e tests in Travis. _They ran fine locally before this commit_.\n\nSee https://github.com/angular/webdriver-manager/issues/121 which describes how Travis is stuck on an old version of Chrome and ONLY by pinning to \"old\" versions of protractor and webdriver can we make tests pass in Travis.\n\nThe sad consequence (for now) is that consumers of this QuickStart get an old, arguably \"wrong\" version of protractor and webdriver.  We don't control Travis. We will fix as soon as possible.\n. Thanks. This is is great information but it belongs as an update to the angular.io testing chapter, not here. The QuickStart repo does not support ... and will not support ... phantom.js out of the box because our goal is to keep it as simple as possible while providing essential functionality. Karma in phantom isn't considered _essential_. \n\nPlease re-post as a PR or at least an issue at [angular.io](https://github.com/angular/angular.io)\n. What you show does not look like the `package.json` from this repo. You can clearly see that this repo has a `systemjs.config.js` and there is no `config.js` file.\n\nI'm attributing this issue to an error on your part and closing it. If you can demonstrate otherwise, I'm happy to reopen.\n. There is something exotic in your environment. We cannot repro. I'm sorry but we have to keep this closed until there is a repro.. This QS repo does not support the [forever](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forever) npm package and it is not our intention to do so. Best to consult that documentation or stackoverflow.\n. I'm guessing you forgot to add `moduleId: module.id` to your `@Component` metadata because it seems to be looking for your template in the project root rather than in the `app/` folder.\n. QuickStart is being completely overhauled. This shouldn't be a problem again.\n. Looks like this is not an issue for you.\n. @filipesilva It's ok to update our systemjs config I guess although I may strip that config down to essentials in future.\n\n**NB** We shouldn't have `@angular/upgrade` or any upgrade packages in in our `package.json`. The QS repo is not useful in A1/A2 hybrid apps. If this QS is used in the instructions for upgrade now, those instructions should be revised to add `@angular/upgrade` and friends manually rather than assume QS supplied them.\n. It's a wonderful question but unfortunately this is the wrong place to ask it as we only address issues that concern the use of this QuickStart seed as described in the documentation. Please post your question to stackoverflow.\n. Deleted \"webdriver:update\" from `package.json` and folded its work into  `\"pree2e\": \"webdriver-manager update\"` which updates webdriver prior to e2e tests every time you say `npm run e2e`.\r\n\r\nThis works because npm itself detects any `pre...` and `post...` tasks and runs them appropriately and automatically\r\n\r\n. Slated for QuickStart Reboot PR #287 . Code coverage is a great idea but is not consistent with the relative simplicity and maintainability we seek for this QuickStart seed. Thanks but we'll have to decline your suggestion.. Of course. Just out of scope for here. Good luck!. That was a problem!  `karma-test-shim` couldn't handle more than one base path containing spec files.\r\n\r\nI've updated `karma-test-shim` and `karma.config`  accordingly.  I made your use case work with the following changes\r\n\r\n```\r\n// karma-test-shim\r\n...\r\n// builtPaths: root paths for output (\"built\") files\r\n// get from karma.config.js, then prefix with '/base/' (default is 'app/')\r\nvar builtPaths = (__karma__.config.builtPaths || ['app/'])\r\n                 .map(function(p) { return '/base/'+p;});\r\n...\r\n// Is a \"built\" file if is JavaScript file in one of the \"built\" folders\r\nfunction isBuiltFile(path) {\r\n  return isJsFile(path) &&\r\n         builtPaths.reduce(function(keep, bp) {\r\n           return keep || (path.substr(0, bp.length) === bp);\r\n         }, false);\r\n}\r\n...\r\n// karma.config.js\r\n  var appBase    = 'app/';       // transpiled app JS and map files\r\n  var appSrcBase = 'app/';       // app source TS files\r\n  var appAssets  = 'base/app/'; // component assets fetched by Angular's compiler\r\n\r\n  var testingBase    = 'spec/unit/'; // transpiled test JS and map files\r\n  var testingSrcBase = 'spec/unit/'; // test source TS files\r\n...\r\n\r\n    client: {\r\n      builtPaths: [appSrcBase, testingBase], // add more spec base paths as needed\r\n      clearContext: false // leave Jasmine Spec Runner output visible in browser\r\n    },\r\n...\r\n```\r\nAttached the working project in the following zip\r\n[issue-294-example.zip](https://github.com/angular/quickstart/files/623144/issue-294-example.zip)\r\n\r\nThe fundamental changes to `karma-test-shim` and `karma.config`  is **now in master as v.0.2.18**. Code coverage is a great idea but is not consistent with the relative simplicity we seek for this QuickStart seed. Thanks but we'll have to decline your suggestion.. Its a way of extending the SystemJS configuration with other mappings if your tests require them (e.g., \"barrels\"). You could modify `systemjs.config.js` directly but we'd rather you didn't. So it looks for this extra file in case you have extra configuration.\r\n\r\nYou can ignore it until you need it. Even deleting it won't hurt ... you'll just get console messages about it.. You can build an app on this seed and then add production build capabilities later. That is by design. Maybe we'll change our mind about that later but I'm closing this issue because we do not intend to take those steps at the moment.\r\n\r\nWe will be adding documentation on readying your app for production in the not distant future.. We agree. It's in our plans to talk about this. Just haven't gotten there yet.. I also removed `'@angular/router/upgrade': 'npm:@angular/router/bundles/router-upgrade.umd.js',` for the same reason. @petebacondarwin I don't understand what you're attempting here. This QuickStart is not intended to support Angular 1 or NgUpgrade. Closing for that reason. Discuss with me offline if you want to pursue.. You have to tell us more than this. Something about your environment (e.g, OS) and how you got here. Start clean, try again, keep track of all versions. If you're still stuck, tell us how.\r\n\r\nI have to close this issue for lack of actionable information. Come back and ask again once you've got the data. Sorry.. Something else is wrong with your setup. You definitely do not ... and should not ... make the changes you've described.\r\n\r\nThe node type information should be coming from the npm installation of `node.d.ts` which you should see in `node_modules/@types/node` ... and obviously you do have that ^^^\r\n\r\nThe `exclude` option is present because the see takes pains to exclude compilation any AoT-specific files.\r\n\r\nYou never want the TS compiler to compile anything in `node_modules`.\r\nThe TS compiler normally excludes `node_modules` by default. But once you start excluding _anything_ you have to exclude everything explicitly, including  `node_modules`. Not doing so is why \"_compilation take forever_\".\r\n\r\nExcluding AoT files isn't necessary in a seed and I'm going to remove it which means I'll be removing the _entire `exclude` clause_. \r\n\r\nI'm compiling just fine. But I'll be that won't work for you because something else is weird in your world.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing you some how are compiling with an old version of TypeScript or npm or something in your environment that I can't see.\r\n\r\nI can assure you that **this seed works when installed cleanly**. There is no issue on our end in the absence of information from you about your environment. So I'm closing this. You'll just have to keep looking for what's different in your world. Sorry.\r\n\r\np.s.: Here's what my package versions look like today:\r\n```bash\r\n> npm list --depth=0\r\nangular-quickstart@1.0.0 C:\\github\\DELETEME\r\n+-- @angular/common@2.2.3\r\n+-- @angular/compiler@2.2.3\r\n+-- @angular/core@2.2.3\r\n+-- @angular/forms@2.2.3\r\n+-- @angular/http@2.2.3\r\n+-- @angular/platform-browser@2.2.3\r\n+-- @angular/platform-browser-dynamic@2.2.3\r\n+-- @angular/router@3.2.3\r\n+-- @types/jasmine@2.5.38\r\n+-- @types/node@6.0.51\r\n+-- @types/selenium-webdriver@2.53.35\r\n+-- angular-in-memory-web-api@0.1.16\r\n+-- canonical-path@0.0.2\r\n+-- concurrently@3.1.0\r\n+-- core-js@2.4.1\r\n+-- http-server@0.9.0\r\n+-- jasmine-core@2.4.1\r\n+-- karma@1.3.0\r\n+-- karma-chrome-launcher@2.0.0\r\n+-- karma-cli@1.0.1\r\n+-- karma-htmlfile-reporter@0.3.4\r\n+-- karma-jasmine@1.0.2\r\n+-- karma-jasmine-html-reporter@0.2.2\r\n+-- lite-server@2.2.2\r\n+-- lodash@4.17.2\r\n+-- protractor@4.0.9\r\n+-- reflect-metadata@0.1.8\r\n+-- rimraf@2.5.4\r\n+-- rxjs@5.0.0-beta.12\r\n+-- systemjs@0.19.40\r\n+-- tslint@3.15.1\r\n+-- typescript@2.0.10\r\n```. I think you had best start over.  Most of use VS Code which makes it easy to hide the generated `.js` and `.js.map` files ... no mess.  Not sure how to do that in your atom editor.\r\n\r\nWe will likely start having a build directory soon but only after we have tooling to make it easier. You don't want to manually deal with the fact that \"_my template files aren't automatically moved from app to dist like my typescript output is_\" (same problem with your component CSS files).\r\n\r\nWithout that tooling, we're keeping our current structure.\r\n\r\nI'll bet your problems stem from moving stuff around. Good luck.. Please raise your concerns with Tour of Heroes on the angular.io repo.. Cannot repro. Perhaps something bad happened during your `npm install` such as a network failure during download. Please delete the `node_modules` folder and try `npm install` again. Or start the whole process over.\r\n\r\nClosing. If this recurs, open a new issue, reference this one ... and maybe someone can walk through it.. Sorry about that but the quickstart is a seed to get you started. We do not intend to explain the configuration files here because that is a distraction from learning Angular ... the real purpose of this repo.\r\n\r\nMoreover, officially, comments are NOT allowed in JSON files.\r\nComplain to the inventor, [Douglas Crockford](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3912149) :-)\r\n\r\n. I agree that we should explain the contents and we intend to do so in the angular.io docs (under setup anatomy). I don't agree that we have to do so in this repo.\r\n\r\nOur official stance is that these packages work together ... not that you should or have to use them.\r\n\r\nYou could reasonably question why we are encouraging testing in our QS seed. We've decided to do so. Sorry that you find it distracting. Hope you can overlook the distractions and enjoy Angular.. Good catch. Thanks.. Sorry but this doesn't look like an issue with the QuickStart itself and those are the only issues we can handle. Please present your case to a forum such as StackOverflow.. Last provider for a token wins.  You can keep adding providers &mdash; even for the same token &mdash; as long as you haven't _frozen_ the TestingModule by calling `compileComponents` or `createComponent`.\r\n```ts\r\nbeforeEach( () => {\r\n  TestBed.configureTestingModule({\r\n    providers: [ { provide: URLLoaderSvc, useClass: Mock1 } ]\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n...\r\nbeforeEach( () => {\r\n  TestBed.configureTestingModule({\r\n    providers: [ { provide: URLLoaderSvc, useClass: Mock2} ]\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n...\r\nbeforeEach( () => {\r\n  TestBed.configureTestingModule({\r\n    providers: [ { provide: URLLoaderSvc, useClass: Mock3} ]\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n...\r\nit( 'some test', inject([URLLoaderSvc,  (loader:URLLoaderSvc) => {\r\n  ... // loader will be Mock3\r\n}]);\r\n```. I don't know how we missed. Probably because we no longer use templateUrl's with absolute URLS. Always component-relative.  Thanks for finding it. Fixed in PR #351. Sorry.  I didn't see your PR when I committed mine.  Thanks ... you deserve the credit.. Don't know why and can't tell from this info.  Appears to be dying in the typescript watching (the first task in `npm start`).  Does `npm run tsc` work?\r\n\r\nFWIW, I just followed the steps from scratch w/o a problem.\r\n\r\nMay just be a failed `npm install`. You might clear the decks and try again.  If it still happens, open a new issue with information about your environment including OS, node version, npm version.. Added warning to QuickStart Seed readme and to Setup Guide in [angular.io PR #3065](https://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/3065). Those are _essential files_ ... in every environment. I'm sorry but there is not enough information here for us to help.  I have to close this issue until you supply details about your environment and the sets you took. Moreover, the VS cookbook is in angular.io, not this QuickStart repo. It's a fine question. The answer is ... the Angular docs deliberately minimize the role of external tools and, because we can accomplish what we need to accomplish without gulp, we do.  But you should feel free to use it.. Closing as answered.. We are working on guidance for deploying to production.We have nothing to add to QS in that regard at this time. Closing for now. When/if we do have something ... we will add it.. I'm sorry but this is not a QuickStart issue. Would be better on StackOverflow. Closing.

I agree that we shouldn't sell it as the ultimate anything.

You are more likely to get an answer on stack overflow. This is NOT a support site.\n. What is the advantage? I already know `concurrently`. I don't know `npm-run-all`.  I see that the syntax is a little nicer but now I have to stop and vet that package. I'll keep this here for the future but it's not a priority.\n\nThanks for the suggestion. I'll get to it when I have time.\n. Aaargh!   Accidentally merged. I'm reverting. Sorry.\n. I created new PR #56 that revives your changes. Now I have to fix the other stuff I broke. Nightmare!\n\nAnyone. Will look again later.\n. Thanks, @kahlil, but we're going to stick with `concurrently`.\n\nHere's why (per one of our authors):\n\n## \n\nWe need functionality from `concurrently`. It's not just a matter or looking better.\n\nIt's the `--kill-others --success first` flags we added in PR #158 \n`--kill-others` will terminate the other processes when the first finishes\n`--success first` will give the status code of the first process to finish\n\nThese two together allow `concurrently \\\"http-server -s\\\" \\\"protractor protractor.config.js\\\" --kill-others --success first\"` which means \"run http-server and protractor at the same time, and once protractor is done kill off http-server\"\n. Added coincidentally as part of c18870fb02801c395bdba53e9d18cc7877c14fed\n. It's super annoying, Rick. I've complains to Typescript team that they really need to let us choose the severity.\n\nI am very open to an alternative suggestion\n. In the latest version, we run `tsc` FIRST and then concurrently `tsc:w` and `lite`.\n\nYes, that runs `twice` each time you start. But it avoids the race condition in which the server starts before the first tsc finishes.\n\nAnd if the first `tsc` fails, it aborts the entire task so the `concurrently ...` never happens. At least such has been my experience.\n. Closing because no action required here\n. Fixed coincidentally with beta.16\n. Fixed coincidentally with beta.16\n.

Hi Artem - I was wondering about whether it was better to let SystemJS load it or preload it. Thanks for clarifying.\n\nI'm holding back on putting this through because of major package movement expected this week. I'll catch up when that's over.\n. Changed it altogether for RC1; see #87.  It's even more chatty now but not sure what to do yet until we have a better bundle story. Closing this one.\n. Solved with 7a268b5aa692c5a37fa9f8309dc880c2ad229121\n. Thanks!\n. Should be fine now. Up to RC1 too\n. It's in now\n. Should work. Just tried it for RC1.  What version of node and npm are you using? \n\nThat link seems weird. Where did that come from?  I don't see the leading `@` in front of Angular\n\nYou can download that package specifically with https://registry.npmjs.org/@angular/common/-/common-2.0.0-rc.0.tgz\n\nClosing because can't repro\n. closed by 6c060f10\n. closed by 6c060f10\n. We have other bundling approaches in mind. System.js does understand commonjs format and we are standardizing on that so that we can define module-relative template and style urls in our components like this:\n\n```\n@Component({\n  selector: 'some-component',\n  moduleId: module.id, // commonjs reference to this module file\n  templateUrl: 'some-component.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['some-component.component.css']\n})\nexport class SomeComponent {...}\n```\n. Hi Mark!  By now I'm hoping you found Debora K who is working on that cookbook. Closing this comment as the idea really belongs on angular.io repo\n. Using the RC1 now. Should be installing `@angular/...`. Are you really using this quick start?\n. Snuck fix into #94\n. Thanks\n. I cannot explain your experience. But there is no doubt that this package exists and is loadable. Closing for lack of information that leads to this result.\n. I'm very sympathetic. I hate all those files too. I don't mind that you've proposed a solution. But I can't accept it as part of the quickstart because we have other plans for coping with this, even during development.  I'm so sorry.  Please keep contributing.\n. Using this quickstart repo product within the context of Visual Studio and an ASP.NET Core project is **_out of scope**_.\n\nWe are working on guidance for Visual Studio users. Look for a forthcoming \"Cookbook\" on that subject.\n\nI'm sorry but we simply cannot give you the help you require within this repo. \n. I'm sorry but you apparently do not understand the purpose of this repo.\n\nIt is supposed to be the end-state of the angular.io docs QuickStart and have almost no application content.  You should also explain your intention when creating a PR.\n. Closing because we're getting very far from the purpose of this repo, there is no actual diagnosis and no solution. Happy to look again when someone has a repro and an answer. No point in pretending we're going to do anything with this as it stands now.\n. Wow!  That is nice!  I'm going to try it out and, if it works as advertised, I'm doing it!  Thanks\n. Upon further examination, I don't think this will work for us. It presupposes the existence of a `package.json` with systemjs config in it and we don't have those. Notice also that we just switched to loading the umd scripts rather than the individual files.\n\nThanks for the intriguing suggestion. I regret we must decline.\n. I understand but the `main` is `index.js` and that is **_not**_ what we want to use, neither locally nor in plunkers. The `index.js` loads each source file individually. Look at the network tab; you'll see hundreds of requests for a \"hello, world\" app.\n\nI realize that it WAS what we wanted when you looked at the package. But it isn't anymore. We've switched to the umd packages.\n\nThanks again. I think we'll stick with our plan for now.\n. Yes ... hardcoded refs to `app` in karma-shim, wallaby, and systemjs.config\n. Please do not dump stack traces in here. It appears that your postinstall step failed. You can run `npm run typings install` separately.\n. Thanks. I was going to suggest that and you beat me to it.\n\nWe should call this out in angular.io on both the QS and npm packages pages. Maybe you did that too!\n. Thanks.  Merging.\n\nI tweaked your prose, corrected capitalization, relabeled as \"Prerequisites\" and moved it up as follows,\nLet's do the same in angular.io.\n\n---\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nNode.js and npm are essential to Angular 2 development. \n- We certify specific version &mdash; node `v5.x.x` and npm `3.x.x` &mdash; for this QuickStart. \n  Both older and newer versions produce errors.\n- We recommend [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for managing multiple versions of node and npm.\n. Closing because this seems \"solved\".\n\nPlease, people, do not paste entire console logs in comments. A little bit is sufficient. Thanks.\n. `node_modules` is automatically excluded unless you specify `files` or `excludes` in the tsconfig in which case you are on your own.\n\nClosing as your issue is old. Please re-open as a new issue if problem persists.\n. Please look at the more recent version which uses different polyfill. There is also a documentation page dedicated to polyfills.\n\nClosing as your issue is old. Please re-open as a new issue if problem persists.\n. Closing because this repo soon will no longer offer docker support (see PR #287). We think docker is great but it's a separate concern, apart from our goal of providing an _essential_ seed for Angular development that is consistent with the documentation sample. Docker would be good for a documentation cookbook.\n. Closing as your issue is old. Please re-open as a new issue if problem persists.\n. Closing as your issue is old. Please re-open as a new issue if problem persists.\n. Closing as your issue is old. Please re-open as a new issue if problem persists.\n. @psnider I wince as I read your perfectly reasonable questions. Our testing guide does not yet cover re-configuration of karma and systemjs for a different project structure. It's on our backlog.  Your questions here are helpful and will inform our effort to take this necessary next step.  What should you do for now?   Ah ... I'll be back ;-)\n. Thanks but your PR is pre-RC6 and we do not want to pin the npm versions as you propose.\n. That's a great question for angular.io. It is out-of-scope for quickstart. Closing\n. Sorry but we do not have enough information and there are many confusing parts to these two sentences. What is `@NgModel`? Do you mean `@NgModule`? What is `rootDir`?\n\nClosing as your issue is old. Please re-open as a new issue if problem persists.\n. Thanks ... but this file has changed substantially since your modification. Appreciate the help.\n. Testing has evolved since this issue was opened. Closing as out of date. Please re-open as a new issue if problem persists.\n. Closing because duplicates #211\n. Unfortunately this only works for quickstart. I'm having trouble making it work in a richer application.  I'm reaching out to wallaby for help.\n. Old. Not about QuickStart. Closing\n. `karma.conf` completely replaced as a result of Testing Chapter revisions. \n\nThese folders are not \"missing\".  It is expected that you will create them for your own helpers. They are harmless in this configuration when they don't exist.\n. You should not have to install it globally. Should work (and only work) with local install. Not having a linux box I am not able to help.\n. Closing because there is no action here that we can or will take. We are also discontinuing docker support in this repo because, however worthy, it is tangential to the fundamental purpose of a \"QuickStart seed\" and we cannot afford to support it.\n. Closing because it doesn't belong here in QuickStart\n. We moved to `@types`. \n. This is QuickStart, not Tour of Heroes. Sorry.\n. Ah. Sorry. We had to drop support for the `HTML-Reporter` which doesn't seem to work any more. I was disappointed. \n\nI just now updated the README to remove mention of it.\n. @ivaro18  Not sure if this is the cause but you're versions of node and npm are not supported.\n@raineeraj Do you get this immediately after cloning and doing an `npm install`?  It should work with your versions of node and npm.\n. Old. Closing. Please resubmit after updating your node version if the problem persists.\n. Are you doing more than simply running the QS app? The QS app doesn't use the router.\n\nIn my experience the `@angular/router` package is in `node_modules`.\n\nAh ... I suspect that you are unaware that ES import names are case-sensitive. The package is `@angular/router`, not `@angular/Router`.\n\nThis is an ES5 thing, not an Angular thing.\n. I'm sorry but your issue isn't a QuickStart repo issue; it belongs on GH angular.io. That's why I'm closing.\n. No one else has reported this (yet) and we don't have resources to pursue it. Maybe you can do some digging for us ... and the community.\n. You'll have to give us a repro.\n\nI just created `app/test/some.spec.ts` as\n\n```\nit('some test', () => {\n expect(true).toBe(true);\n});\n```\n\n... and ran `npm test`. Worked fine.\n\nBTW, we recommend putting specs next to the thing that they test. That means we generally don't need a separate `test` folder. When we do, it's usually for some deep integration test that crosscuts so many files that the spec doesn't seem to belong to any of them.\n\nI'll leave this open for a short while to give you a chance to comment or provide more of a repro\n. Your reply shows that you have taken your file structure in a direction that is completely different than the one proposed by the QuickStart.\n\nThat means it is out of scope for the quickstart.  I'm sorry but we don't have the time and resources to pursue this. Our narrow mission is to make the QS work _as written_.\n\nPerhaps you'll find the help you need on StackOverflow.\n. Duplicate of #241\n. Looks like you have a configuration conflict. Karma is looking for `/base/src/client/app/container/` but your file map says it should be `/base/src/client/container/` (no 'app/'). Is that the explanation?\n\nAlso beware of the other addresses to like \n\n```\n      var appAssets  = '/base/app/'; // component assets fetched by Angular's compiler\n\n      var testBase    = 'testing/';       // transpiled test JS and map files\n      var testSrcBase = 'testing/';       // test source TS files\n```\n. Can you \"Show all files\" and look for the hidden `node_modules` folder. Do you see the missing file inside `node_modules/@angular/core`? If not, it would seem that VS did not install node modules for you. It should have.  Please make sure that your Visual Studio is configured as described in the cookbook.\n\nI'm going to close this because it's really a problem related to the VS cookbook in angular.io, not this Getting Started repo.  If you can't solve it here, please raise an issue there.\n. Sorry but this really doesn't relate to QuickStart. More of a stackoverflow thing. Closing.\n. Closed by e33ed9a3adb1e1b9639bd16bcf27e621aba6e09\n. Thanks but superseded by e33ed9a3adb1e1b9639bd16bcf27e621aba6e092.\n\nThe `tsconfig.js` needed updating too and I bumped versions ... all in my own commit.\n. Sorry but we are removing docker artifacts from this repo very soon. We simply cannot support them and our goal is to simplify this repo ... a goal inconsistent with the docker effects. I think docker is great. But it should be a cookbook addition, not part of the QS distribution.\n\nSee PR #287 \n. ... namely that you surrounded the \"ctrl-c\" commands in backtacks.  Which is fine, thanks\n. Yes. Missed it before. Corrected by commit 541bdc5f634e1142860c56cace247234edfaf74b\n. That's great that you've done that for yourself. We have decide not to add AoT to this QS at this time.. @r105m The vulgarity in your comment is inconsistent with our usage policy. Coincidentally, this QS is certified for Chrome only.\n. The \"fix\" is for the problem of running e2e tests in Travis. _They ran fine locally before this commit_.\n\nSee https://github.com/angular/webdriver-manager/issues/121 which describes how Travis is stuck on an old version of Chrome and ONLY by pinning to \"old\" versions of protractor and webdriver can we make tests pass in Travis.\n\nThe sad consequence (for now) is that consumers of this QuickStart get an old, arguably \"wrong\" version of protractor and webdriver.  We don't control Travis. We will fix as soon as possible.\n. Thanks. This is is great information but it belongs as an update to the angular.io testing chapter, not here. The QuickStart repo does not support ... and will not support ... phantom.js out of the box because our goal is to keep it as simple as possible while providing essential functionality. Karma in phantom isn't considered _essential_. \n\nPlease re-post as a PR or at least an issue at [angular.io](https://github.com/angular/angular.io)\n. What you show does not look like the `package.json` from this repo. You can clearly see that this repo has a `systemjs.config.js` and there is no `config.js` file.\n\nI'm attributing this issue to an error on your part and closing it. If you can demonstrate otherwise, I'm happy to reopen.\n. There is something exotic in your environment. We cannot repro. I'm sorry but we have to keep this closed until there is a repro.. This QS repo does not support the [forever](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forever) npm package and it is not our intention to do so. Best to consult that documentation or stackoverflow.\n. I'm guessing you forgot to add `moduleId: module.id` to your `@Component` metadata because it seems to be looking for your template in the project root rather than in the `app/` folder.\n. QuickStart is being completely overhauled. This shouldn't be a problem again.\n. Looks like this is not an issue for you.\n. @filipesilva It's ok to update our systemjs config I guess although I may strip that config down to essentials in future.\n\n**NB** We shouldn't have `@angular/upgrade` or any upgrade packages in in our `package.json`. The QS repo is not useful in A1/A2 hybrid apps. If this QS is used in the instructions for upgrade now, those instructions should be revised to add `@angular/upgrade` and friends manually rather than assume QS supplied them.\n. It's a wonderful question but unfortunately this is the wrong place to ask it as we only address issues that concern the use of this QuickStart seed as described in the documentation. Please post your question to stackoverflow.\n. Deleted \"webdriver:update\" from `package.json` and folded its work into  `\"pree2e\": \"webdriver-manager update\"` which updates webdriver prior to e2e tests every time you say `npm run e2e`.\r\n\r\nThis works because npm itself detects any `pre...` and `post...` tasks and runs them appropriately and automatically\r\n\r\n. Slated for QuickStart Reboot PR #287 . Code coverage is a great idea but is not consistent with the relative simplicity and maintainability we seek for this QuickStart seed. Thanks but we'll have to decline your suggestion.. Of course. Just out of scope for here. Good luck!. That was a problem!  `karma-test-shim` couldn't handle more than one base path containing spec files.\r\n\r\nI've updated `karma-test-shim` and `karma.config`  accordingly.  I made your use case work with the following changes\r\n\r\n```\r\n// karma-test-shim\r\n...\r\n// builtPaths: root paths for output (\"built\") files\r\n// get from karma.config.js, then prefix with '/base/' (default is 'app/')\r\nvar builtPaths = (__karma__.config.builtPaths || ['app/'])\r\n                 .map(function(p) { return '/base/'+p;});\r\n...\r\n// Is a \"built\" file if is JavaScript file in one of the \"built\" folders\r\nfunction isBuiltFile(path) {\r\n  return isJsFile(path) &&\r\n         builtPaths.reduce(function(keep, bp) {\r\n           return keep || (path.substr(0, bp.length) === bp);\r\n         }, false);\r\n}\r\n...\r\n// karma.config.js\r\n  var appBase    = 'app/';       // transpiled app JS and map files\r\n  var appSrcBase = 'app/';       // app source TS files\r\n  var appAssets  = 'base/app/'; // component assets fetched by Angular's compiler\r\n\r\n  var testingBase    = 'spec/unit/'; // transpiled test JS and map files\r\n  var testingSrcBase = 'spec/unit/'; // test source TS files\r\n...\r\n\r\n    client: {\r\n      builtPaths: [appSrcBase, testingBase], // add more spec base paths as needed\r\n      clearContext: false // leave Jasmine Spec Runner output visible in browser\r\n    },\r\n...\r\n```\r\nAttached the working project in the following zip\r\n[issue-294-example.zip](https://github.com/angular/quickstart/files/623144/issue-294-example.zip)\r\n\r\nThe fundamental changes to `karma-test-shim` and `karma.config`  is **now in master as v.0.2.18**. Code coverage is a great idea but is not consistent with the relative simplicity we seek for this QuickStart seed. Thanks but we'll have to decline your suggestion.. Its a way of extending the SystemJS configuration with other mappings if your tests require them (e.g., \"barrels\"). You could modify `systemjs.config.js` directly but we'd rather you didn't. So it looks for this extra file in case you have extra configuration.\r\n\r\nYou can ignore it until you need it. Even deleting it won't hurt ... you'll just get console messages about it.. You can build an app on this seed and then add production build capabilities later. That is by design. Maybe we'll change our mind about that later but I'm closing this issue because we do not intend to take those steps at the moment.\r\n\r\nWe will be adding documentation on readying your app for production in the not distant future.. We agree. It's in our plans to talk about this. Just haven't gotten there yet.. I also removed `'@angular/router/upgrade': 'npm:@angular/router/bundles/router-upgrade.umd.js',` for the same reason. @petebacondarwin I don't understand what you're attempting here. This QuickStart is not intended to support Angular 1 or NgUpgrade. Closing for that reason. Discuss with me offline if you want to pursue.. You have to tell us more than this. Something about your environment (e.g, OS) and how you got here. Start clean, try again, keep track of all versions. If you're still stuck, tell us how.\r\n\r\nI have to close this issue for lack of actionable information. Come back and ask again once you've got the data. Sorry.. Something else is wrong with your setup. You definitely do not ... and should not ... make the changes you've described.\r\n\r\nThe node type information should be coming from the npm installation of `node.d.ts` which you should see in `node_modules/@types/node` ... and obviously you do have that ^^^\r\n\r\nThe `exclude` option is present because the see takes pains to exclude compilation any AoT-specific files.\r\n\r\nYou never want the TS compiler to compile anything in `node_modules`.\r\nThe TS compiler normally excludes `node_modules` by default. But once you start excluding _anything_ you have to exclude everything explicitly, including  `node_modules`. Not doing so is why \"_compilation take forever_\".\r\n\r\nExcluding AoT files isn't necessary in a seed and I'm going to remove it which means I'll be removing the _entire `exclude` clause_. \r\n\r\nI'm compiling just fine. But I'll be that won't work for you because something else is weird in your world.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing you some how are compiling with an old version of TypeScript or npm or something in your environment that I can't see.\r\n\r\nI can assure you that **this seed works when installed cleanly**. There is no issue on our end in the absence of information from you about your environment. So I'm closing this. You'll just have to keep looking for what's different in your world. Sorry.\r\n\r\np.s.: Here's what my package versions look like today:\r\n```bash\r\n> npm list --depth=0\r\nangular-quickstart@1.0.0 C:\\github\\DELETEME\r\n+-- @angular/common@2.2.3\r\n+-- @angular/compiler@2.2.3\r\n+-- @angular/core@2.2.3\r\n+-- @angular/forms@2.2.3\r\n+-- @angular/http@2.2.3\r\n+-- @angular/platform-browser@2.2.3\r\n+-- @angular/platform-browser-dynamic@2.2.3\r\n+-- @angular/router@3.2.3\r\n+-- @types/jasmine@2.5.38\r\n+-- @types/node@6.0.51\r\n+-- @types/selenium-webdriver@2.53.35\r\n+-- angular-in-memory-web-api@0.1.16\r\n+-- canonical-path@0.0.2\r\n+-- concurrently@3.1.0\r\n+-- core-js@2.4.1\r\n+-- http-server@0.9.0\r\n+-- jasmine-core@2.4.1\r\n+-- karma@1.3.0\r\n+-- karma-chrome-launcher@2.0.0\r\n+-- karma-cli@1.0.1\r\n+-- karma-htmlfile-reporter@0.3.4\r\n+-- karma-jasmine@1.0.2\r\n+-- karma-jasmine-html-reporter@0.2.2\r\n+-- lite-server@2.2.2\r\n+-- lodash@4.17.2\r\n+-- protractor@4.0.9\r\n+-- reflect-metadata@0.1.8\r\n+-- rimraf@2.5.4\r\n+-- rxjs@5.0.0-beta.12\r\n+-- systemjs@0.19.40\r\n+-- tslint@3.15.1\r\n+-- typescript@2.0.10\r\n```. I think you had best start over.  Most of use VS Code which makes it easy to hide the generated `.js` and `.js.map` files ... no mess.  Not sure how to do that in your atom editor.\r\n\r\nWe will likely start having a build directory soon but only after we have tooling to make it easier. You don't want to manually deal with the fact that \"_my template files aren't automatically moved from app to dist like my typescript output is_\" (same problem with your component CSS files).\r\n\r\nWithout that tooling, we're keeping our current structure.\r\n\r\nI'll bet your problems stem from moving stuff around. Good luck.. Please raise your concerns with Tour of Heroes on the angular.io repo.. Cannot repro. Perhaps something bad happened during your `npm install` such as a network failure during download. Please delete the `node_modules` folder and try `npm install` again. Or start the whole process over.\r\n\r\nClosing. If this recurs, open a new issue, reference this one ... and maybe someone can walk through it.. Sorry about that but the quickstart is a seed to get you started. We do not intend to explain the configuration files here because that is a distraction from learning Angular ... the real purpose of this repo.\r\n\r\nMoreover, officially, comments are NOT allowed in JSON files.\r\nComplain to the inventor, [Douglas Crockford](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3912149) :-)\r\n\r\n. I agree that we should explain the contents and we intend to do so in the angular.io docs (under setup anatomy). I don't agree that we have to do so in this repo.\r\n\r\nOur official stance is that these packages work together ... not that you should or have to use them.\r\n\r\nYou could reasonably question why we are encouraging testing in our QS seed. We've decided to do so. Sorry that you find it distracting. Hope you can overlook the distractions and enjoy Angular.. Good catch. Thanks.. Sorry but this doesn't look like an issue with the QuickStart itself and those are the only issues we can handle. Please present your case to a forum such as StackOverflow.. Last provider for a token wins.  You can keep adding providers &mdash; even for the same token &mdash; as long as you haven't _frozen_ the TestingModule by calling `compileComponents` or `createComponent`.\r\n```ts\r\nbeforeEach( () => {\r\n  TestBed.configureTestingModule({\r\n    providers: [ { provide: URLLoaderSvc, useClass: Mock1 } ]\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n...\r\nbeforeEach( () => {\r\n  TestBed.configureTestingModule({\r\n    providers: [ { provide: URLLoaderSvc, useClass: Mock2} ]\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n...\r\nbeforeEach( () => {\r\n  TestBed.configureTestingModule({\r\n    providers: [ { provide: URLLoaderSvc, useClass: Mock3} ]\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n...\r\nit( 'some test', inject([URLLoaderSvc,  (loader:URLLoaderSvc) => {\r\n  ... // loader will be Mock3\r\n}]);\r\n```. I don't know how we missed. Probably because we no longer use templateUrl's with absolute URLS. Always component-relative.  Thanks for finding it. Fixed in PR #351. Sorry.  I didn't see your PR when I committed mine.  Thanks ... you deserve the credit.. Don't know why and can't tell from this info.  Appears to be dying in the typescript watching (the first task in `npm start`).  Does `npm run tsc` work?\r\n\r\nFWIW, I just followed the steps from scratch w/o a problem.\r\n\r\nMay just be a failed `npm install`. You might clear the decks and try again.  If it still happens, open a new issue with information about your environment including OS, node version, npm version.. Added warning to QuickStart Seed readme and to Setup Guide in [angular.io PR #3065](https://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/3065). Those are _essential files_ ... in every environment. I'm sorry but there is not enough information here for us to help.  I have to close this issue until you supply details about your environment and the sets you took. Moreover, the VS cookbook is in angular.io, not this QuickStart repo. It's a fine question. The answer is ... the Angular docs deliberately minimize the role of external tools and, because we can accomplish what we need to accomplish without gulp, we do.  But you should feel free to use it.. Closing as answered.. We are working on guidance for deploying to production.We have nothing to add to QS in that regard at this time. Closing for now. When/if we do have something ... we will add it.. I'm sorry but this is not a QuickStart issue. Would be better on StackOverflow. Closing.

    "filipesilva": "@FredLoney the issue you are referring to should be reported in https://github.com/angular/angular rather than in the quickstart. \n\nThe quickstart repo aims to provide a barebones development environment and is not the place to report issues with Angular 2 itself.\n. @jdforsythe I just checked and the quickstart guide on www.angular.io seems to work. \n\n`node_modules/systemjs/dist/system.js` exists alongside `node_modules/systemjs/dist/system.src.js`.\n. @jdforsythe I can't seem to reproduce this error. The steps I took were these:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/angular/quickstart.git\ncd quickstart\nnpm install\nnpm start\n```\n\nIn chrome, this is all I see in the console:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4172079/14888219/16a75b46-0d51-11e6-97b3-d250d7a18b9f.png)\n. Merged in https://github.com/angular/quickstart/commit/bf69b163960f0fd0a40ec04d55051198ae6ed1b3\n. Made obsolete by https://github.com/angular/quickstart/pull/158\n\nConcurrently has the `--kill-all` functionality that was previously broken on windows/mac, but now is fixed. It is used for the e2e and unit tests on travis.\n. @maximklakov you can add your input in the main issue that @Foxandxss pointed out: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/8053\n\nThat is the issue that tracks the node/angular problem, not this one. Issues with npm and angular itself aren't something that can be solved in this repo, because this is the quickstart.\n. This project does not use the `typings` package anymore, so if you are experiencing a typings related problem the answer is not to do `npm install typings`. As @layton-glympse said, it is also not to target ES6 (for the reasons listed).\n\nIf you're experiencing `Cannot find name 'Promise'.`, it's most likely because you changed something from the base setup or did not finish installing the node packages. Do this:\n- freshly clone this repository\n- run `npm install` and make sure it finishes successfully\n- copy the `app` folder of your existing project into this new project\n. Good catch @surmacz, thanks!\n. My bad!\n. @wardbell updated as per your suggestion.\n. @Foxandxss I updated this PR so there are no conflicts.\n\nIt doesn't include https://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/1675/files because those require a custom tsconfig+typings.d.ts, which I think is a bit more complicated and unnecessary for the quickstart.\n. This looks like a typings issue. Can you run `typings install` in the project?\n. Yeah it's really weird. I mean the postinstall script is there, and the `typings` package is a dependency, so it should run. I wonder what causes it to not run.\n. Thanks for spotting this @VDMT, I'm merging it in now.\n. Roger, good catch Deborah.\n. @ishwar25667 can you open a new issue with your terror as it appears in the Chrome console?\n. @vahidn I think the documentation isn't updated, but bundling is available in the CLI for prod builds via `ng build -prod`.\n. I know it's a hassle, but can you try with node 5? https://github.com/creationix/nvm can help you with multiple versions.\n\nI ask because I've read that it might be related to either npm version or total ram... and it's easier to check npm version.\n. Glad it's sorted man!\n. Sorry, one of the dependencies was left in a old one. It should be fixed now.\n. @airhork I think it's actually because of node, I know that similar peerDeps issues are solved on newer versions. Can you try node 5 or 6?\n. @cooervo you'll have to ask at the `angular2-meteor` repo. We don't control the dependencies they use.\n. `rm` is the linux command for deleting folders from the command line, which also works on Windows if you are using gitbash.\n\nYou don't seem to be using gitbash, so instead you can just delete directories manually. Delete `node_modules` and `typings`, then try running the commands:\n\n```\nnpm install\nnpm run postinstall\nnpm start\n```\n. I can't reproduce this myself on windows, and the logs show an error that I really have no idea what it could be. My recommendation is to open an issue at https://github.com/johnpapa/lite-server itself.\n. @technoloG this repo contains code for https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html. The guide you linked is specifically for adapting the code present in this repo for use in a ASP.NET 4.x project.\n\nIf you would like the guide to be updated with this information, you should open an issue in https://github.com/angular/angular.io instead, since that is where the guide is.\n. @webmaxru we're still waiting for a publish of `angular2-in-memory-web-api`, but it shouldn't break the build - I tested myself yesterday. I only got warnings.\n\nCan you show me the log of your build breaking please? I'm worried I might have missed something.\n. There is no `@angular/router-deprecated@2.0.0-rc.3`, use `@angular/router-deprecated@2.0.0-rc.2` instead :D\n. lgtm\n. Hm, this log doesn't tell me much. 304 is not an error though, it's the http `Not Modified` code which just means that the file is being loaded from the cache.\n\nDo you have any console errors in the browser?\n. Closing as the original issue opener is inactive.\n. Glad to hear it's solved for you. 305 is not an error though, it's just an HTML status code. Errors are in the 400 range. See https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html\n. There are no plans at the moment to move the quickstart to webpack. That might change, of course, but it is how it stands at the moment.\n. It seems like you have a compilation issue, can you show me the full error output of the console?\n. Apologies for the delay getting back to you. I went through the log and couldn't find anything weird to be honest... Does `npm start` work and serve your files? \n\nThe warning you show shouldn't cause any problems, they're common warnings about optional dependencies and typings.\n\nDid you make any changes to the application? If you put up a repo, I will look at it and see if I get the same problem.\n. The quickstart is served via https://github.com/johnpapa/lite-server, which in turn uses https://github.com/BrowserSync/browser-sync. Browser-Sync is the one keeping your browsers in sync, it is a useful dev feature.\n\nWhen hosting the application on your server, you would not use `lite-server` because it is a dev-only server. You would use a production server instead and thus not have this issue.\n. I'm afraid not. It's a dev only server by nature, there is no production setting.\n. Absolutely correct :D\n. @AttilaZz not silly at all, it's a very reasonable concern and I'm glad you asked, because other people might have it as well and find an answer here.\n\n@maddela I can't begin to guess what the issue is, there are many things that could have gone wrong in your deployment. This repository is about the quickstart though and doesn't really propose any specific deployment procedure, so I don't think this repo is the right place to ask.\n\nPerhaps try asking someone very knowledgeable in AWS/IBM Bluemix? They might be able to help you in the transition from a local setup to a deployed setup.\n. The quickstart doesn't cover any particular server side language, nor a particular server setup. It is up to the user to adapt this setup to their technologies of choice. \n\nAll I can say is that if it works locally but not remotely, it's probably due to misconfiguration.\n. @jiggy1com comment is spot on.\n\nAngular 2 is a javascript framework, so you will always need to run javascript to use it. Other than that it just uses plain html and typescript. \n\nIt is true that the dev server we provide is a node application, but it does little more than just serve your files.\n. Ok, seems the problem is in https://github.com/typings/typings. As part of our `npm install`, we also run `typings install`.\n\nHere is the configuration instructions for it, showing how to add a proxy: https://github.com/typings/typings/blob/master/docs/faq.md#configuration\n. The quickstart in and of itself is not mean to load Bootstrap. We have it in `package.json` because in some of the examples at www.angular.io we ask users to add it. \n\nIt's the same reason we include a lot of Angular packages (like `router` and `http`) that we don't really use in the quickstart example. \n\nI appreciate your PR, but this we did on purpose.\n. Hm. Your error seems to indicate some problem during the npm install. It's basically saying that one of your libs is broken (in this case, `angular` itself).\n\nCan you delete `node_modules` and do `npm install` again? If that's the problem, it should fix it.\n. Awesome :D\n. Might be a problem with your npm install or connection, as `gunzTarPerm` is part of how `npm` works.\n\nI can't really say much more than that... your problem seems unrelated to the quickstart itself.\n. It's mostly a matter of style. Some style-guides recommend to do that since it makes adding a new array element easier and also makes git diffs easier to read. I don't see a big reason to change it, though.\n. Fair point. Fix in https://github.com/angular/quickstart/pull/177.\n. lgtm\n. Have that nit, otherswise LGTM.\n. @psnider I would avoid that solution, because afaik it will not work in the near future. Instead, what you should do is configure the testing module to import the `FormsModule`. \n\n```\nTestBed.configureTestingModule({declarations: [AppComponent]});\n```\n. Well the testing module is like a normal module, right? So let's look at the toh-1 `app.module.ts`:\n\n```\n// #docregion\nimport { NgModule }      from '@angular/core';\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { FormsModule }   from '@angular/forms';\n\nimport { AppComponent }  from './app.component';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    FormsModule\n  ],\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  bootstrap: [ AppComponent ]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n```\n\nBasically, `AppComponent` expects to be ran in an environment like this module. So I think what you're missing is to use the `imports` property:\n\n```\n TestBed.configureTestingModule({\n  imports: [FormsModule],\n  declarations: [AppComponent]\n});\n```\n\nNot too sure why the `BrowserModule` isn't needed though. I hope that'll be covered in the upcoming revision of the testing chapter that @wardbell is working on.\n. What bits of it make it a struggle, specifically?\n. Heya @psnider, we have a revised and very complete Testing guide at https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/testing.html#!#setup-files. It doesn't answer all of difficulties, but I think it answers most of them.\n. Can you provide some repro steps please?\n. I tried to reproduce it in plunker, but it works for me: http://plnkr.co/edit/NYpd31tw1sTr6vFhKebg?p=preview\n\nThe only difference I see is that I used dot at the start of the url path `'./app/login/login.css'`.\n. Do you get an error in the browser console?\n. Glad it hear that helped!\n. @Foxandxss I know you were having some issues with `zone` as well, can you weigh in?\n. The right solution is to configure your testing module correctly:\n\n```\n  beforeEach(() => {\n    TestBed.configureTestingModule({\n      imports: [FormsModule],\n      declarations: [AppComponent, HeroDetailComponent]\n    });\n  });\n```\n\nTour of Heroes doesn't talk about unit tests so it really doesn't make sense to update it with these solutions. Instead, we have the testing chapter at https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/testing.html\n. While it is perfectly fine (and encouraged) to run the unit tests in watch mode while coding your app, running the e2e tests as well is overall a bad idea. The answer lies in what you said:\n\n> When developing my application I'd like to have **immediate feedback**.\n\nUnit tests are usually fast because they test the classes etc in isolation. So mostly it's just some bits of code running, albeit the tests might number in the hundreds.\n\nE2E tests, however, are a different beast all together. They work by firing up the browser, interfacing with it via protractor, and running a bunch of interactions as if you were doing them yourself. Meaning it's clicking on buttons, sending keys to input fields, etc on chrome. This is way more computationally intensive, and overall slow, than unit tests.\n\nSo while 500 unit tests might take ten seconds, it's not that uncommon to have 100 e2e tests take 20 minutes.\n\nEssentially this means that e2e tests can never give you the immediate feedback you want and need, while unit tests kinda can.\n. Can you explain what situation you had difficulty with? \n. This repository is not mean to have examples of directives, but rather to show the end result of the Quickstart chapter in https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html. \n\nYou can fin an example of creating an attribute directive in https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/attribute-directives.html.\n. Closed with reason in https://github.com/angular/quickstart/issues/198#issuecomment-243564772\n. That is not the correct approach, no. We're putting the finishing touches on the testing chapter in www.angular.io which will address such situations.\n. Tests seem to be running correctly with the latest quickstart, are you using the new SystemJS and karma config?\n. I guess we could auto discover the port, but if the problem is that the port isn't available... then the solution is to make that port available. Adding port auto-discovery is a non-essential optimization imho, and this is a quickstart.\n\nUnless there's a strong argument otherwise, I think this issue is closed.\n. No problem, glad you're using the quickstart as a base for your projects!\n. That's part of why we didn't do it, but the other part is that those shims absolutely 100% need to be before everything else - even systemjs - for some browsers.\n. This seems related to `zone.js@0.6.22`, which was just released. Will you cross post your issue there.\n. @jacksoncharles you should either use `typings`, `dt` OR `@types/`. Using more than one of these at the same time will (and should) give you duplication errors.\n. Assuming you're using `typings` this is what you should do:\n- delete `typings` folder (where all the installed typings are), `typings.json`\n- in `package.json` delete `\"postinstall\": \"typings install\",` and `\"typings\": \"typings\",`\n- do `npm install @types/{core-js,jasmine,node,protractor,selenium-webdriver} typescript@latest --save-dev`\n- configure your editor to use the local Typescript 2.0 (for VSCode follow https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/typescript#_using-newer-typescript-versions)\n\nThose should be all steps. https://github.com/angular/quickstart/pull/157 should update the quickstart to `@types/` sometime in the next months.\n. Heya @nikvarma, your issue is better suited to the CLI repo at https://github.com/angular/angular-cli since it seems like that's what you're using (this is the quickstart).\n\nThat being said, I know the answer to your problem. You need to configure apache to have a fallback to `index.html` when you try to access an address that doesn't exist. \n\nWe don't have a production deploy chapter for Angular 2, but in the meanwhile you can see similar configuration for Angular 1 in https://ngmilk.rocks/2015/03/09/angularjs-html5-mode-or-pretty-urls-on-apache-using-htaccess/ for instructions on how to make an `.htaccess` that allows that.\n. `angular-in-memory-web-api` and referenced versions do exist:\n\n```\n$ npm info angular-in-memory-web-api versions\n[ '0.1.0', '0.1.1' ]\n```\n\nPerhaps you are behind a npm proxy or something?\n. @IgorMinar that issue was present when this repo was in `2.0.0-rc.4`, but on `2.0.0-rc.6` we switched to a different `system.config.js` format: https://github.com/angular/quickstart/blob/master/systemjs.config.js#L17-L25\n. Your problem is zone.js related. Are you using `0.6.25`?\n. @darklinki can you put up your code online in github? That way I could clone it locally and test.\n\nI can tell you with 100% certainty that the code currently on this repo works, and that the code that is being shown in the Quickstart chapter also works. We test them several times a day. \n\nBut there might be some broken instructions somewhere in the prose that lead to your scenario, so if you can help me reproduce I can fix it.\n. @DeborahK could you have a look?\n. I just checked and it definitely exists. Maybe you're using a private registry or a proxy that does not yet have the latest versions?\n\n```\n$ npm info angular-in-memory-web-api versions\n\n[ '0.1.0',\n  '0.1.1',\n  '0.1.2',\n  '0.1.3',\n  '0.1.4',\n  '0.1.5',\n  '0.1.6',\n  '0.1.7' ]\n```\n. I think @Longfld is actually taking about a project called `angular2-quickstart` that uses `angular2-in-memory-web-api`.\n\n@Longfld where is this project? In the quickstart repo, we use the right version https://github.com/angular/quickstart/blob/master/package.json#L40\n. Are you talking about this project? https://github.com/valor-software/angular2-quickstart\n\nAngular does not maintain that. It's created by someone else, perhaps you should open an issue there for them to update their repo.\n. @dir000 your problem seems related to the `typings` tool, probably a proxy issue like @mart-dominguez mentioned.\n\n@0101coding you seem to have a broken cache. Try doing the following:\n\n```\nnpm cache clean\nnpm install\n```\n. @cnishina thanks for the update. Clean installs should now work.\n. Heya, that's an odd error. ENOENT means \"Error No Entry\", which usually is related to missing files/dirs.\n\nLet's start by making sure your install is good. Can you try deleting `node_modules` and running `npm install` again?\n. Can you show me the errors you are getting with `npm run typings`?\n. I have idea why the command is failing on your system.. I find it weird that it says that the file and path is `D:\\Windows\\system32`, but can't say exactly what's broken. \n\n@Foxandxss, @wardbell any idea?\n. My best bet is that there's is SOMETHING that's stopping NPM from finding your local modules. \n\nCan you see if this command works successfully from your project dir?\n\n```\nnode_modules\\.bin\\typings install\n```\n. @kiiru501 can you show me the log when you ran `node_modules\\.bin\\typings install`?\n. @jannakha added PR to bump concurrently, maybe that helps.\n. @kiiru501 locally, try to do `npm install concurrently@3.1.0` and see if `npm start` works again.\n. Hm... really weird that you both get that error AND get the version right afterwards. Also weird that in that error, there are double slashes `\\\\` in some of the directory paths.\n\nI think you have a broken NPM/Node install somehow, maybe something wrong in the PATH? You can try asking in https://github.com/npm/npm as well.\n. Lgtm, thanks!\n\nNot really sure why that was in, maybe a leftover from long ago.\n. Heya, in step 3 there are actually instructions to edit your `app.module.ts` and add those bits: https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html#!#root-component\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4172079/19618571/79756c42-9846-11e6-8b4d-20919a0fdf50.png)\n. @Sri276286 Angular-CLI does'tn use SystemJS as a loader anymore, so you don't need to do any related SystemJS configuration. In fact, there's no need to edit anything in `index.html` either, since it's managed by the build system as well.\n\nI'm going to have to close this issue however, as your setup is not related to the quickstart per se. If you are having trouble with your CLI app I'll be happy to answer your issue in the CLI repo: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli\n. @Sri276286 you cannot control the build step while using Angular-CLI at the moment, but in the future you will be able to via the addon system. Again, please open CLI related questions on the CLI tracker, I won't answer any more here because it's not related to the quickstart.\n. Heya @thomasmerieux, we don't add all polyfills but we have a documentation page listing the necessary one for each browser: https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/browser-support.html\n. Heya @cnishina, I appreciate you took the time to put this solution together, and I think we'll use it in the docs but I don't think it's a good fit for the quickstart. \n\nMy reason is that, in the future, users would have to change the protractor config, whereas currently they'd just have to change packages in package.json.  \n. @wardbell `\"pree2e\": \"npm run webdriver:update\"` needs to be in `package.json`, and can be simplified to `\"pree2e\": \"webdriver:update\"` I think.\n\nWithout it, we don't have a chrome driver for Protractor to use when communication with chrome. That is the source of this error message in the CI: https://travis-ci.org/angular/quickstart/builds/176909767#L780\n. Will work on it. We also need to do it on the docs.\n. I just tried with a brand new quickstart clone and did not get this error. \n\nI suggest you compare how your current setup differs from a brand new quickstart clone and debug it accordingly. The answer might lie in the paths shown in the error message.\n\nAlthough they look the same, you seem to be somehow including them twice and separately;\n- `d:/Development/angularquickstart/node_modules/@types/selenium-webdriver/`\n- `node_modules/@types/selenium-webdriver/index.d.ts`\n. The error seems to indicate that you have deleted `./app/app.component.ts`. . Do you have any import for `angular2/core`? It should be `@angular/core` instead.. There is no `app.main.js` file, perhaps you misread the instructions in https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html#!#main to create a `app/main.ts` file?. `ENOSPC` means there is no space in the drive. Perhaps you are running low on disk space and the files cannot be created.. Heya all, this seems to be a problem with Angular 2.3.0 and you can find more information in these issues:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/13301\r\n- https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/13311 (sends you to the first one)\r\n\r\nA fix seems to already be in master and I suppose it will be out in the next release.. @danday74 it is available:\r\n```\r\n$ npm info @angular/common dist-tags\r\n{ latest: '2.3.0', next: '2.3.0-rc.0' }\r\n```\r\n\r\nPerhaps you are using a cached version of npm?. I agree that this is a useful feature, and you've implemented it in a very succinct way. It is outside the scope of the quickstart though, and that's the only reason for which I will close the PR and not accept it.. In https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/docs/debugging.md there's a couple more good techniques to debug failing tests.\r\n\r\nI personally use a lot of `browser.pause()` and `protractor --elementExplorer` to figure out what's happening.. Heya, it looks like you accidentally changed part of your npm script in `package.json`.\r\n\r\nMake sure it looks like this:\r\n```\r\n\"start\": \"tsc && concurrently \\\"tsc -w\\\" \\\"lite-server\\\" \",\r\n```. Oh and there's no need to have any package globally installed. Whatever is on `package.json` scripts always has the local node_modules added to path!. This seems to be related with a `@types` problem. Can you try using this exact one?\r\n```\r\n@types/selenium-webdriver@2.53.33\r\n```. Not too sure myself but @cnishina is working on it I believe.. Just to let people know, a fix is in the works on https://github.com/angular/protractor/pull/3848.. I'm going to reopen this since more people are opening new issues to report it.. Dupe of https://github.com/angular/quickstart/issues/325, the solution there is pretty much what you mention.. Heya, was there any other message on the console when you ran mom start?\r\n\r\nThese npm error logs aren't showing the real error.. Then this sounds like a dupe of https://github.com/angular/quickstart/issues/325, see https://github.com/angular/quickstart/issues/325#issuecomment-268118533 for a solution.. Dupe of https://github.com/angular/quickstart/issues/325. Dupe of https://github.com/angular/quickstart/issues/327. If you still have problems, check the reply there and provide the extra information requested.. Actually, now that I read this issue better, you're trying to install Angular-CLI instead of the quickstart. Make an issue on https://github.com/angular/angular-cli instead. . Heya, can you see if https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently/issues/71 helps? This seems to be a problem with some shell setups on a lib we use (`concurrently`).. Glad to hear it's working for you now!. Typescript 2.0.x is needed for the quickstart to properly compile. \r\n\r\nI don't use Visual Studio myself so I can't help you with the config, but there must be a setting somewhere that allows you to use the local TS version instead of the global one that VS has.\r\n\r\nVisual Studio Code and Webstorm have such options, so I assume VS does as well.. Heya @roroco, glad you got it sorted. That extension must be doing something weird :/. Heya, we took those out a while ago when we switched to using`@types/*` in https://github.com/angular/quickstart/pull/157.\r\n\r\nYou can also read more about `@types` in these pages:\r\n- https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/typescript-configuration.html#!#typings\r\n- http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/consumption.html. You need to configure the `TestBed` in the spec to also include that new component. See more in https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/testing.html#!#testbed. I mean something different though: you have to add the *new* component to the testbed for `app.component.spec.ts` since now it needs to know about it.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/adelinor/quickstart/blob/master/app/app.component.spec.ts#L14\r\n```\r\n    TestBed.configureTestingModule({\r\n      declarations: [ AppComponent, CustomComponent ]\r\n    })\r\n```. Heya, there's a localization guide on the official docs here: https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/i18n.html\r\n\r\nThis repository is not meant for general questions though. A better place would be Stack Overflow.. Heya, I'm glad you got it sorted, and thanks for taking the time to write up your experience! \r\n\r\nI agree with you that npm errors are quite noisy. They also aren't very helpful by themselves to post back to repo maintainers. Those long error logs happen *specifically* because stuff is being ran as a [npm script](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts). Basically it tacks on its own error message in addition to whatever the real command put out.\r\n\r\nI haven't looked much into it but it would be nice to be able to remove that extra error text. I don't think there is a reasonable way to do it for new users though, that's the kind of thing that needs system configuration usually.\r\n\r\n. Here's an NPM issue on the topic: https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6124\r\n\r\nSeems you can do `npm run e2e --silent` (or `-s`).. That's the thing though, it can't be fixed on `package.json` itself. At least when I tried adding it inside the script it didn't work. So users would always have to do it. Which also kinda sucks.. LGTM. @FredLoney the issue you are referring to should be reported in https://github.com/angular/angular rather than in the quickstart. \n\nThe quickstart repo aims to provide a barebones development environment and is not the place to report issues with Angular 2 itself.\n. @jdforsythe I just checked and the quickstart guide on www.angular.io seems to work. \n\n`node_modules/systemjs/dist/system.js` exists alongside `node_modules/systemjs/dist/system.src.js`.\n. @jdforsythe I can't seem to reproduce this error. The steps I took were these:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/angular/quickstart.git\ncd quickstart\nnpm install\nnpm start\n```\n\nIn chrome, this is all I see in the console:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4172079/14888219/16a75b46-0d51-11e6-97b3-d250d7a18b9f.png)\n. Merged in https://github.com/angular/quickstart/commit/bf69b163960f0fd0a40ec04d55051198ae6ed1b3\n. Made obsolete by https://github.com/angular/quickstart/pull/158\n\nConcurrently has the `--kill-all` functionality that was previously broken on windows/mac, but now is fixed. It is used for the e2e and unit tests on travis.\n. @maximklakov you can add your input in the main issue that @Foxandxss pointed out: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/8053\n\nThat is the issue that tracks the node/angular problem, not this one. Issues with npm and angular itself aren't something that can be solved in this repo, because this is the quickstart.\n. This project does not use the `typings` package anymore, so if you are experiencing a typings related problem the answer is not to do `npm install typings`. As @layton-glympse said, it is also not to target ES6 (for the reasons listed).\n\nIf you're experiencing `Cannot find name 'Promise'.`, it's most likely because you changed something from the base setup or did not finish installing the node packages. Do this:\n- freshly clone this repository\n- run `npm install` and make sure it finishes successfully\n- copy the `app` folder of your existing project into this new project\n. Good catch @surmacz, thanks!\n. My bad!\n. @wardbell updated as per your suggestion.\n. @Foxandxss I updated this PR so there are no conflicts.\n\nIt doesn't include https://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/1675/files because those require a custom tsconfig+typings.d.ts, which I think is a bit more complicated and unnecessary for the quickstart.\n. This looks like a typings issue. Can you run `typings install` in the project?\n. Yeah it's really weird. I mean the postinstall script is there, and the `typings` package is a dependency, so it should run. I wonder what causes it to not run.\n. Thanks for spotting this @VDMT, I'm merging it in now.\n. Roger, good catch Deborah.\n. @ishwar25667 can you open a new issue with your terror as it appears in the Chrome console?\n. @vahidn I think the documentation isn't updated, but bundling is available in the CLI for prod builds via `ng build -prod`.\n. I know it's a hassle, but can you try with node 5? https://github.com/creationix/nvm can help you with multiple versions.\n\nI ask because I've read that it might be related to either npm version or total ram... and it's easier to check npm version.\n. Glad it's sorted man!\n. Sorry, one of the dependencies was left in a old one. It should be fixed now.\n. @airhork I think it's actually because of node, I know that similar peerDeps issues are solved on newer versions. Can you try node 5 or 6?\n. @cooervo you'll have to ask at the `angular2-meteor` repo. We don't control the dependencies they use.\n. `rm` is the linux command for deleting folders from the command line, which also works on Windows if you are using gitbash.\n\nYou don't seem to be using gitbash, so instead you can just delete directories manually. Delete `node_modules` and `typings`, then try running the commands:\n\n```\nnpm install\nnpm run postinstall\nnpm start\n```\n. I can't reproduce this myself on windows, and the logs show an error that I really have no idea what it could be. My recommendation is to open an issue at https://github.com/johnpapa/lite-server itself.\n. @technoloG this repo contains code for https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html. The guide you linked is specifically for adapting the code present in this repo for use in a ASP.NET 4.x project.\n\nIf you would like the guide to be updated with this information, you should open an issue in https://github.com/angular/angular.io instead, since that is where the guide is.\n. @webmaxru we're still waiting for a publish of `angular2-in-memory-web-api`, but it shouldn't break the build - I tested myself yesterday. I only got warnings.\n\nCan you show me the log of your build breaking please? I'm worried I might have missed something.\n. There is no `@angular/router-deprecated@2.0.0-rc.3`, use `@angular/router-deprecated@2.0.0-rc.2` instead :D\n. lgtm\n. Hm, this log doesn't tell me much. 304 is not an error though, it's the http `Not Modified` code which just means that the file is being loaded from the cache.\n\nDo you have any console errors in the browser?\n. Closing as the original issue opener is inactive.\n. Glad to hear it's solved for you. 305 is not an error though, it's just an HTML status code. Errors are in the 400 range. See https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html\n. There are no plans at the moment to move the quickstart to webpack. That might change, of course, but it is how it stands at the moment.\n. It seems like you have a compilation issue, can you show me the full error output of the console?\n. Apologies for the delay getting back to you. I went through the log and couldn't find anything weird to be honest... Does `npm start` work and serve your files? \n\nThe warning you show shouldn't cause any problems, they're common warnings about optional dependencies and typings.\n\nDid you make any changes to the application? If you put up a repo, I will look at it and see if I get the same problem.\n. The quickstart is served via https://github.com/johnpapa/lite-server, which in turn uses https://github.com/BrowserSync/browser-sync. Browser-Sync is the one keeping your browsers in sync, it is a useful dev feature.\n\nWhen hosting the application on your server, you would not use `lite-server` because it is a dev-only server. You would use a production server instead and thus not have this issue.\n. I'm afraid not. It's a dev only server by nature, there is no production setting.\n. Absolutely correct :D\n. @AttilaZz not silly at all, it's a very reasonable concern and I'm glad you asked, because other people might have it as well and find an answer here.\n\n@maddela I can't begin to guess what the issue is, there are many things that could have gone wrong in your deployment. This repository is about the quickstart though and doesn't really propose any specific deployment procedure, so I don't think this repo is the right place to ask.\n\nPerhaps try asking someone very knowledgeable in AWS/IBM Bluemix? They might be able to help you in the transition from a local setup to a deployed setup.\n. The quickstart doesn't cover any particular server side language, nor a particular server setup. It is up to the user to adapt this setup to their technologies of choice. \n\nAll I can say is that if it works locally but not remotely, it's probably due to misconfiguration.\n. @jiggy1com comment is spot on.\n\nAngular 2 is a javascript framework, so you will always need to run javascript to use it. Other than that it just uses plain html and typescript. \n\nIt is true that the dev server we provide is a node application, but it does little more than just serve your files.\n. Ok, seems the problem is in https://github.com/typings/typings. As part of our `npm install`, we also run `typings install`.\n\nHere is the configuration instructions for it, showing how to add a proxy: https://github.com/typings/typings/blob/master/docs/faq.md#configuration\n. The quickstart in and of itself is not mean to load Bootstrap. We have it in `package.json` because in some of the examples at www.angular.io we ask users to add it. \n\nIt's the same reason we include a lot of Angular packages (like `router` and `http`) that we don't really use in the quickstart example. \n\nI appreciate your PR, but this we did on purpose.\n. Hm. Your error seems to indicate some problem during the npm install. It's basically saying that one of your libs is broken (in this case, `angular` itself).\n\nCan you delete `node_modules` and do `npm install` again? If that's the problem, it should fix it.\n. Awesome :D\n. Might be a problem with your npm install or connection, as `gunzTarPerm` is part of how `npm` works.\n\nI can't really say much more than that... your problem seems unrelated to the quickstart itself.\n. It's mostly a matter of style. Some style-guides recommend to do that since it makes adding a new array element easier and also makes git diffs easier to read. I don't see a big reason to change it, though.\n. Fair point. Fix in https://github.com/angular/quickstart/pull/177.\n. lgtm\n. Have that nit, otherswise LGTM.\n. @psnider I would avoid that solution, because afaik it will not work in the near future. Instead, what you should do is configure the testing module to import the `FormsModule`. \n\n```\nTestBed.configureTestingModule({declarations: [AppComponent]});\n```\n. Well the testing module is like a normal module, right? So let's look at the toh-1 `app.module.ts`:\n\n```\n// #docregion\nimport { NgModule }      from '@angular/core';\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { FormsModule }   from '@angular/forms';\n\nimport { AppComponent }  from './app.component';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    FormsModule\n  ],\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  bootstrap: [ AppComponent ]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n```\n\nBasically, `AppComponent` expects to be ran in an environment like this module. So I think what you're missing is to use the `imports` property:\n\n```\n TestBed.configureTestingModule({\n  imports: [FormsModule],\n  declarations: [AppComponent]\n});\n```\n\nNot too sure why the `BrowserModule` isn't needed though. I hope that'll be covered in the upcoming revision of the testing chapter that @wardbell is working on.\n. What bits of it make it a struggle, specifically?\n. Heya @psnider, we have a revised and very complete Testing guide at https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/testing.html#!#setup-files. It doesn't answer all of difficulties, but I think it answers most of them.\n. Can you provide some repro steps please?\n. I tried to reproduce it in plunker, but it works for me: http://plnkr.co/edit/NYpd31tw1sTr6vFhKebg?p=preview\n\nThe only difference I see is that I used dot at the start of the url path `'./app/login/login.css'`.\n. Do you get an error in the browser console?\n. Glad it hear that helped!\n. @Foxandxss I know you were having some issues with `zone` as well, can you weigh in?\n. The right solution is to configure your testing module correctly:\n\n```\n  beforeEach(() => {\n    TestBed.configureTestingModule({\n      imports: [FormsModule],\n      declarations: [AppComponent, HeroDetailComponent]\n    });\n  });\n```\n\nTour of Heroes doesn't talk about unit tests so it really doesn't make sense to update it with these solutions. Instead, we have the testing chapter at https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/testing.html\n. While it is perfectly fine (and encouraged) to run the unit tests in watch mode while coding your app, running the e2e tests as well is overall a bad idea. The answer lies in what you said:\n\n> When developing my application I'd like to have **immediate feedback**.\n\nUnit tests are usually fast because they test the classes etc in isolation. So mostly it's just some bits of code running, albeit the tests might number in the hundreds.\n\nE2E tests, however, are a different beast all together. They work by firing up the browser, interfacing with it via protractor, and running a bunch of interactions as if you were doing them yourself. Meaning it's clicking on buttons, sending keys to input fields, etc on chrome. This is way more computationally intensive, and overall slow, than unit tests.\n\nSo while 500 unit tests might take ten seconds, it's not that uncommon to have 100 e2e tests take 20 minutes.\n\nEssentially this means that e2e tests can never give you the immediate feedback you want and need, while unit tests kinda can.\n. Can you explain what situation you had difficulty with? \n. This repository is not mean to have examples of directives, but rather to show the end result of the Quickstart chapter in https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html. \n\nYou can fin an example of creating an attribute directive in https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/attribute-directives.html.\n. Closed with reason in https://github.com/angular/quickstart/issues/198#issuecomment-243564772\n. That is not the correct approach, no. We're putting the finishing touches on the testing chapter in www.angular.io which will address such situations.\n. Tests seem to be running correctly with the latest quickstart, are you using the new SystemJS and karma config?\n. I guess we could auto discover the port, but if the problem is that the port isn't available... then the solution is to make that port available. Adding port auto-discovery is a non-essential optimization imho, and this is a quickstart.\n\nUnless there's a strong argument otherwise, I think this issue is closed.\n. No problem, glad you're using the quickstart as a base for your projects!\n. That's part of why we didn't do it, but the other part is that those shims absolutely 100% need to be before everything else - even systemjs - for some browsers.\n. This seems related to `zone.js@0.6.22`, which was just released. Will you cross post your issue there.\n. @jacksoncharles you should either use `typings`, `dt` OR `@types/`. Using more than one of these at the same time will (and should) give you duplication errors.\n. Assuming you're using `typings` this is what you should do:\n- delete `typings` folder (where all the installed typings are), `typings.json`\n- in `package.json` delete `\"postinstall\": \"typings install\",` and `\"typings\": \"typings\",`\n- do `npm install @types/{core-js,jasmine,node,protractor,selenium-webdriver} typescript@latest --save-dev`\n- configure your editor to use the local Typescript 2.0 (for VSCode follow https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/typescript#_using-newer-typescript-versions)\n\nThose should be all steps. https://github.com/angular/quickstart/pull/157 should update the quickstart to `@types/` sometime in the next months.\n. Heya @nikvarma, your issue is better suited to the CLI repo at https://github.com/angular/angular-cli since it seems like that's what you're using (this is the quickstart).\n\nThat being said, I know the answer to your problem. You need to configure apache to have a fallback to `index.html` when you try to access an address that doesn't exist. \n\nWe don't have a production deploy chapter for Angular 2, but in the meanwhile you can see similar configuration for Angular 1 in https://ngmilk.rocks/2015/03/09/angularjs-html5-mode-or-pretty-urls-on-apache-using-htaccess/ for instructions on how to make an `.htaccess` that allows that.\n. `angular-in-memory-web-api` and referenced versions do exist:\n\n```\n$ npm info angular-in-memory-web-api versions\n[ '0.1.0', '0.1.1' ]\n```\n\nPerhaps you are behind a npm proxy or something?\n. @IgorMinar that issue was present when this repo was in `2.0.0-rc.4`, but on `2.0.0-rc.6` we switched to a different `system.config.js` format: https://github.com/angular/quickstart/blob/master/systemjs.config.js#L17-L25\n. Your problem is zone.js related. Are you using `0.6.25`?\n. @darklinki can you put up your code online in github? That way I could clone it locally and test.\n\nI can tell you with 100% certainty that the code currently on this repo works, and that the code that is being shown in the Quickstart chapter also works. We test them several times a day. \n\nBut there might be some broken instructions somewhere in the prose that lead to your scenario, so if you can help me reproduce I can fix it.\n. @DeborahK could you have a look?\n. I just checked and it definitely exists. Maybe you're using a private registry or a proxy that does not yet have the latest versions?\n\n```\n$ npm info angular-in-memory-web-api versions\n\n[ '0.1.0',\n  '0.1.1',\n  '0.1.2',\n  '0.1.3',\n  '0.1.4',\n  '0.1.5',\n  '0.1.6',\n  '0.1.7' ]\n```\n. I think @Longfld is actually taking about a project called `angular2-quickstart` that uses `angular2-in-memory-web-api`.\n\n@Longfld where is this project? In the quickstart repo, we use the right version https://github.com/angular/quickstart/blob/master/package.json#L40\n. Are you talking about this project? https://github.com/valor-software/angular2-quickstart\n\nAngular does not maintain that. It's created by someone else, perhaps you should open an issue there for them to update their repo.\n. @dir000 your problem seems related to the `typings` tool, probably a proxy issue like @mart-dominguez mentioned.\n\n@0101coding you seem to have a broken cache. Try doing the following:\n\n```\nnpm cache clean\nnpm install\n```\n. @cnishina thanks for the update. Clean installs should now work.\n. Heya, that's an odd error. ENOENT means \"Error No Entry\", which usually is related to missing files/dirs.\n\nLet's start by making sure your install is good. Can you try deleting `node_modules` and running `npm install` again?\n. Can you show me the errors you are getting with `npm run typings`?\n. I have idea why the command is failing on your system.. I find it weird that it says that the file and path is `D:\\Windows\\system32`, but can't say exactly what's broken. \n\n@Foxandxss, @wardbell any idea?\n. My best bet is that there's is SOMETHING that's stopping NPM from finding your local modules. \n\nCan you see if this command works successfully from your project dir?\n\n```\nnode_modules\\.bin\\typings install\n```\n. @kiiru501 can you show me the log when you ran `node_modules\\.bin\\typings install`?\n. @jannakha added PR to bump concurrently, maybe that helps.\n. @kiiru501 locally, try to do `npm install concurrently@3.1.0` and see if `npm start` works again.\n. Hm... really weird that you both get that error AND get the version right afterwards. Also weird that in that error, there are double slashes `\\\\` in some of the directory paths.\n\nI think you have a broken NPM/Node install somehow, maybe something wrong in the PATH? You can try asking in https://github.com/npm/npm as well.\n. Lgtm, thanks!\n\nNot really sure why that was in, maybe a leftover from long ago.\n. Heya, in step 3 there are actually instructions to edit your `app.module.ts` and add those bits: https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html#!#root-component\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4172079/19618571/79756c42-9846-11e6-8b4d-20919a0fdf50.png)\n. @Sri276286 Angular-CLI does'tn use SystemJS as a loader anymore, so you don't need to do any related SystemJS configuration. In fact, there's no need to edit anything in `index.html` either, since it's managed by the build system as well.\n\nI'm going to have to close this issue however, as your setup is not related to the quickstart per se. If you are having trouble with your CLI app I'll be happy to answer your issue in the CLI repo: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli\n. @Sri276286 you cannot control the build step while using Angular-CLI at the moment, but in the future you will be able to via the addon system. Again, please open CLI related questions on the CLI tracker, I won't answer any more here because it's not related to the quickstart.\n. Heya @thomasmerieux, we don't add all polyfills but we have a documentation page listing the necessary one for each browser: https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/browser-support.html\n. Heya @cnishina, I appreciate you took the time to put this solution together, and I think we'll use it in the docs but I don't think it's a good fit for the quickstart. \n\nMy reason is that, in the future, users would have to change the protractor config, whereas currently they'd just have to change packages in package.json.  \n. @wardbell `\"pree2e\": \"npm run webdriver:update\"` needs to be in `package.json`, and can be simplified to `\"pree2e\": \"webdriver:update\"` I think.\n\nWithout it, we don't have a chrome driver for Protractor to use when communication with chrome. That is the source of this error message in the CI: https://travis-ci.org/angular/quickstart/builds/176909767#L780\n. Will work on it. We also need to do it on the docs.\n. I just tried with a brand new quickstart clone and did not get this error. \n\nI suggest you compare how your current setup differs from a brand new quickstart clone and debug it accordingly. The answer might lie in the paths shown in the error message.\n\nAlthough they look the same, you seem to be somehow including them twice and separately;\n- `d:/Development/angularquickstart/node_modules/@types/selenium-webdriver/`\n- `node_modules/@types/selenium-webdriver/index.d.ts`\n. The error seems to indicate that you have deleted `./app/app.component.ts`. . Do you have any import for `angular2/core`? It should be `@angular/core` instead.. There is no `app.main.js` file, perhaps you misread the instructions in https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html#!#main to create a `app/main.ts` file?. `ENOSPC` means there is no space in the drive. Perhaps you are running low on disk space and the files cannot be created.. Heya all, this seems to be a problem with Angular 2.3.0 and you can find more information in these issues:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/13301\r\n- https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/13311 (sends you to the first one)\r\n\r\nA fix seems to already be in master and I suppose it will be out in the next release.. @danday74 it is available:\r\n```\r\n$ npm info @angular/common dist-tags\r\n{ latest: '2.3.0', next: '2.3.0-rc.0' }\r\n```\r\n\r\nPerhaps you are using a cached version of npm?. I agree that this is a useful feature, and you've implemented it in a very succinct way. It is outside the scope of the quickstart though, and that's the only reason for which I will close the PR and not accept it.. In https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/docs/debugging.md there's a couple more good techniques to debug failing tests.\r\n\r\nI personally use a lot of `browser.pause()` and `protractor --elementExplorer` to figure out what's happening.. Heya, it looks like you accidentally changed part of your npm script in `package.json`.\r\n\r\nMake sure it looks like this:\r\n```\r\n\"start\": \"tsc && concurrently \\\"tsc -w\\\" \\\"lite-server\\\" \",\r\n```. Oh and there's no need to have any package globally installed. Whatever is on `package.json` scripts always has the local node_modules added to path!. This seems to be related with a `@types` problem. Can you try using this exact one?\r\n```\r\n@types/selenium-webdriver@2.53.33\r\n```. Not too sure myself but @cnishina is working on it I believe.. Just to let people know, a fix is in the works on https://github.com/angular/protractor/pull/3848.. I'm going to reopen this since more people are opening new issues to report it.. Dupe of https://github.com/angular/quickstart/issues/325, the solution there is pretty much what you mention.. Heya, was there any other message on the console when you ran mom start?\r\n\r\nThese npm error logs aren't showing the real error.. Then this sounds like a dupe of https://github.com/angular/quickstart/issues/325, see https://github.com/angular/quickstart/issues/325#issuecomment-268118533 for a solution.. Dupe of https://github.com/angular/quickstart/issues/325. Dupe of https://github.com/angular/quickstart/issues/327. If you still have problems, check the reply there and provide the extra information requested.. Actually, now that I read this issue better, you're trying to install Angular-CLI instead of the quickstart. Make an issue on https://github.com/angular/angular-cli instead. . Heya, can you see if https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently/issues/71 helps? This seems to be a problem with some shell setups on a lib we use (`concurrently`).. Glad to hear it's working for you now!. Typescript 2.0.x is needed for the quickstart to properly compile. \r\n\r\nI don't use Visual Studio myself so I can't help you with the config, but there must be a setting somewhere that allows you to use the local TS version instead of the global one that VS has.\r\n\r\nVisual Studio Code and Webstorm have such options, so I assume VS does as well.. Heya @roroco, glad you got it sorted. That extension must be doing something weird :/. Heya, we took those out a while ago when we switched to using`@types/*` in https://github.com/angular/quickstart/pull/157.\r\n\r\nYou can also read more about `@types` in these pages:\r\n- https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/typescript-configuration.html#!#typings\r\n- http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/consumption.html. You need to configure the `TestBed` in the spec to also include that new component. See more in https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/testing.html#!#testbed. I mean something different though: you have to add the *new* component to the testbed for `app.component.spec.ts` since now it needs to know about it.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/adelinor/quickstart/blob/master/app/app.component.spec.ts#L14\r\n```\r\n    TestBed.configureTestingModule({\r\n      declarations: [ AppComponent, CustomComponent ]\r\n    })\r\n```. Heya, there's a localization guide on the official docs here: https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/i18n.html\r\n\r\nThis repository is not meant for general questions though. A better place would be Stack Overflow.. Heya, I'm glad you got it sorted, and thanks for taking the time to write up your experience! \r\n\r\nI agree with you that npm errors are quite noisy. They also aren't very helpful by themselves to post back to repo maintainers. Those long error logs happen *specifically* because stuff is being ran as a [npm script](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts). Basically it tacks on its own error message in addition to whatever the real command put out.\r\n\r\nI haven't looked much into it but it would be nice to be able to remove that extra error text. I don't think there is a reasonable way to do it for new users though, that's the kind of thing that needs system configuration usually.\r\n\r\n. Here's an NPM issue on the topic: https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6124\r\n\r\nSeems you can do `npm run e2e --silent` (or `-s`).. That's the thing though, it can't be fixed on `package.json` itself. At least when I tried adding it inside the script it didn't work. So users would always have to do it. Which also kinda sucks..

The current version of this repository is sadly broken. We are waiting to beta .12 to fix this issues.\n\nSo let's wait for that update and see if that fixes your issue or not.\n. Could you update the repo and try now please?\n. You need to include the router after you include angular:\n\n```\n<script src=\"node_modules/angular2/bundles/angular2.dev.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"node_modules/angular2/bundles/router.dev.js\"></script>\n```\n. This project is a mirror for what you can build on angular.io. A simpler and easier way to get started on the tutorials.\n\nThat being said, this is not the best channel to get this kind of support.\n\nThank you :)\n. That library is OSX only. Who's pulling that?\n. The problem is that we are not using that library directly. One of our dependencies are.\n. This seems to be an old issue with npm and doesn't seem to be resolved.\n\nLeaving the warning aside, it should work.\n\nWhich node & npm do you have?\n. That is something with your connection. Firewall or something.\n. if your browser has a proxy to access github, you can access it with the browser. You would need to setup the proxy for github in the CLI.\n\nI would check that.\n. I would check this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20370294/could-not-resolve-host-github-com-error-while-cloning-remote-repository-in-git\n. Thanks for your contribution, but we tell the user to delete the .git folder (they don't need it) so more or less history is not important for this use case.\n. Hello Wenchen, thanks for your issue.\n\nThis repository is not meant to be used on real projects, it is just a mirror of the tutorial at angular.io.\n\nSo the recommendation here is not to use this repository to build your own projects.\n\nCheers.\n. Yes, we plan on covering tooling in the tutorials, but I don't know how soon.\n. > We should talk about why you think it should be so restrictive.\n\nSounds good to me :+1: \n. This needs a review.\n. That is really weird. For the sake of trying. Clone the repo again in a new folder, it is like tsc is not finding the folder. I cannot reproduce :/\n. I am using latest typescript (global and in the package) and works for me in OSX.\n. Ill try on my windows box later.\n. Good stuff John. \n\nCould we add a npm script running the linter and update the README? \n\nAs an aside, what can you tell me about this tslint config? I need one for another project. \n. Hello, this is a duplicate of #45. The issue comes from chokidar. I suggest you research there for a solution. \n. You need to load the corresponding file in a script tag, like the router or HTTP. Also keep in mind this is a quickstart project.\n. Thanks for your contribution, but I think this is completely outside the purpose of this repository.\n. I can confirm this. I will research later.\n. So it is a reported issue already https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/8053.\n\nWith node 5.10.1 it works like a charm.\n. Sounds like typings not installed. Check for a typings folder in your project.\n. For some reason the typings folder is not created.\n\nTry\n\n$ ./node_modules/.bin/typings install\n\nAnd see if that creates it and works.\n. It should. I will check why it didn't.\n. node and npm versions are the problem here.\n. No, that is the bad solution. You need to add the typings.\n. Dup of #64 \n. LGTM\n. There are a lot like this lately. Said that I was trying to repro this like 5 hours ago and I forgot.\n\nThing is, typings should be installed automagically but somehow it doesn't happen for certain people. It does for me, even with fresh node installation.\n. What you mean with \"not installing\". Is giving an error?\n. Have you checked that you have the typings folder?\n. No, should be in root. do a:\n\n```\n$ node_modules/.bin/typings install\n```\n\nAnd see if that generates it.\n. What is your OS btw?\n. The thing is. It is there. The reason of why it is not doing the job automatically for you is still a mystery for me.\n. Concretely https://github.com/angular/quickstart/blob/master/package.json#L12\n\nthat should run after an \"npm install\"\n. Weird, it shouldn't take that long. It takes 2 second for me.\n\nI am using latest everything, including node and npm.\n. That is a legit bug. Would you like to create a PR to fix it? \ud83d\udc4d \n. I am not sure if the bot will verify it if you leave the issue closed.\n. We just released RC0. Let me put myself up to date and see what is going on.\n. show your package.json\n. show me your systemjs.config.js\n. add @angular/router-deprecated along with the others there.\n\nThat will tell system.js where to find @angular/router-deprecated when you ask for it and not give a 404\n. which tutorial?\n. that part contains no package.json nor systemjs.config.js.\n. It wasn't, we are changing too much stuff so that can happen. That is why I ask you, perhaps we left something out :)\n. We just released rc0 so we still need to do some adjustements. Give me a couple of hours until I figure things out.\n. I got no error for that. Weird.\n. That has been fixed.\n. There is a PR already to fix that. That is just a typo\n. No worries, that is never a bad idea :)\n. Or when another person have a moment :)\n\nhttps://github.com/angular/quickstart/pull/87\n. There is no support yet, if you need them like right now, use the PR I put at #87\n. That change is completely unrelated to your OS and it shouldn't make a difference. What problem do you have right now?\n. Yes, the problem is that the app has to run in a browser and not all browsers are able to run ES6 stuff so as today we need to transpile our apps to ES5 yes or yes.\n. This is just a quickstart project, if you want something that can be bundled and put into production, we suggest the angular-cli.\n. You can consider a simple script to do that. This project is a quickstart, the needed bits to get you started. You can use it and extend it your needs if you want to.\n\nBut from this concrete repository, we are not going to extend it in that way.\n. That error is not any helpful. What node & npm versions do you have?\n. Bump to 5.x and 3.x\n. Dependencies are always updated and they could stop supporting an old node and npm version.\n. @rmoen true, I didn't see it, my bad.\n. Node 6 is giving a lot of issues not only here but in other projects, even 6.1. I personally not recommend them yet.\n. Latest 5.x for the time being.\n. Yes, that is \"latest\" :)\n. Sorry sir but this issue tracker is not the best place for this kind of questions. We will post a VS cookbook soon.\n. Oh, I meant a cookbook with VS + asp.net. Basically how to set a solution like the one you are using.\n\nThis repo is a mirror of the quickstart on the web page, it not really a seed project (we have the angular-cli for that), so if you want to extend / modify it, better to use SO.\n. The problem is that our tools install typings after install, question is: why they don't for some people.\n. You tell me. I get the typings by default, other people too but suddenly, that is not the case for some Ubuntu users. Weird is that you are using OSX. Perhaps is beacuse you are using an old node & npm, but it shouldn't.\n. What npm version do you both have?\n. 0.10.x is really old, you need to update yes or yes.\n\nYou all need a 5.x node and npm 3.x\n. You are looking at a different package, you need https://www.npmjs.com/~angular\n. Tutorial issues go to the angular.io repo and that one is fixed, site will be updated soon.\n. Dup from #108 \n\nPlease, it doesn't cost much checking the recent closed issues.\n. Yes, but keep in mind that this repo is not for the quickstart guide. Quickstart guide lives in another repo with it own issue tracker\n. No, I didn't, but doesn't sound like a bad idea. So I am on it.\n. Said and done https://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/1461\n. All angular packages, zone.js, rx and reflect-metadata.\n. You need to add:\n\n```\n'angular2-in-memory-web-api': { main: 'index.js', defaultExtension: 'js' },\n```\n\nWe changed how the lib work in the past few days.\n\nSorry for the troubles.\n. You could start by installing the dependencies (`npm install`)\n. For that you need to `./node_modules/bin/typings install` or better yet, update your npm version.\n. Have you tried to run \"npm install\" again? That should install the typings as well. If not, do it by hand as I said in the previous message.\n. Oh sudo, why do you need sudo? Don't use it with sudo.\n. Sorry, this is not the right repository for that.\n. Please, post it again at the angular.io repo (where we have our documentation). This repo is just a mirror for the quickstart.\n\nThanks for the feedback.\n. Thanks, but the quickstart is just a mirror of the quickstart tutorial and we are not planning on adding any new feature to it.\n\nBundling is a nice feature, but the quickstart itself is not really doing any bundle not it does need that at the moment.\n. Weird, I see no hint there of what could be happening.\n. Thanks.\n. This is not the purpose of the quickstart. The quickstart is just to get you started on Angular 2 development.\n\nDeployment is outside this project necessities.\n\nWe will have proper docs on the CLI (including a deployment scenario) probably for next week.\n\nStay tuned.\n. You are missing the typings that for some reason, they fail under certain OS and node versions.\n\n./node_modules/.bin/typings install\n. Sorry about that, that is fixed by now.\n. That node is reaaaaaaaaaally old.\n. Is NPM probably the problematic one, but I recommend Node 5 at least.\n. That is expected and will be fixed soon. Still with that, it should work.\n. I am not really sure if a solution for npm 2.x is going to come.\n\nCan't it be updated to latest npm?\n\n`npm i -g npm`\n. LGTM\n. Did you `npm install` ?\n. We updated the instructions a bit ago.\n\nClosing this.\n. This quickstart was never done with asp.net in mind.\n. We have a guide for visual studio in the page. Do you mean that one?\n. Why remove angular2-in-memory-web-api?\n. This repo serves as a starting point for all tutorials at angular.io and some of them uses the in memory web api (the tutorial for example) so we simply assume that the in memory api is already there.\n\nThe router-deprecated will go away as soon as we sweep all the doc to use the new router, but that is not done yet.\n. Known issue. We have to wait to next week to fix it. The quickstart still works tho, it is just a warning. \n. Thanks.\n. Be sure to use npm 3.x\n. Better to keep them as script tags. We need to load zone.js before systemjs.\n. Because zone.js is picky enough and needs to be loaded before anything else or you could end working outside a zone and get no change detection.\n. Have you check in the README if your node & npm versions match the needed ones?\n. This is more of a backend thing and is outside the scope of this quickstart. \n. For some reason, your port 8080 is in use.\n. We don't depend on those libraries directly, is a dependency of a dependency. I will check if any of those dependencies got an update.\n. That doesn't say anything useful, I believe the proper error is before that blurb.\n. I need more information.\n. Hello, this is the wrong repository, this is just the quickstart (no webpack involved).\n\nI would consider stackoverflow for that.\n. Fixed, @filipesilva review please.\n. Changed that.\n. Yes, we needed to merge #184. Now it is done, and it should work for everyone.\n. Thanks for the PR.\n\nUnfortunately I cannot merge it.\n\nThis quickstart is not meant to be used an as starter point to \"any project\" (can be used for that, but is not the main goal).\n\nThis quickstart is a mirror of the \"Quickstart\" page at [angular.io](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html).\n\nIf you go there, you will see that the `FormsModule` is never mentioned, so if I merge this in here, this repo and that tutorial won't be in sync anymore.\n\nSince this \"Quickstart\" is meant to be a starting point for the documentation, we left it without the Forms because we explain what the FormsModule is at the forms tutorial and is there where we add it.\n\nNow, if you want a good starting point, you could start testing the webpack branch of the CLI.\n\nCheers.\n. Before you spend the time in that, I'm going to ask if we want that in this repo \n. You removed the typings command from that package.json.\n. Adding it back :P\n. That is the first time I see that error, seems like it cannot connect to that url for some reason (a self signed certificate).\n\nI have no idea at all.\n. What about the last line @hhhcube? :P\n.

It is in the same folder, not an app folder\n\nEl 26 sept. 2016 10:12, \"Ahmed HABBACHI\" notifications@github.com\nescribi\u00f3:\n\n> in app.modules.ts i get the error in\n> import { AppComponent} from './app/app.component';\n> [ts] Cannot find module './app/app.component'.\n> \n> \u2014\n> You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/angular/quickstart/issues/229, or mute the thread\n> https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ABCZ1fl3O0sdZE3voGAk2rgBBgkTN2HAks5qt4yJgaJpZM4KGTC8\n> .\n. You are trying to install angular**2**-in-memory-web-api version 0.1.5+ and that **does not** exist. You need to get rid of that \"2\" on the name.\n. node_modules is excluded by default. Perhaps it is a bug with `atom-typescript` ?\n. Sorry, we cannot bump this dependencies. Angular has a strict dependency on rxjs and we are forced to use the same version that Angular requires, which is beta 12.\n\nAs soon as Angular bumps to any RC, we will update it.\n\nThank you for the PR tho.\n. Unfortunately, updating rxjs at angular is not as easy as that. There are a lot of rxjs code in the core and that needs a lot of work before you can update the version.\n\nSo, it is not like someone forgot to bump the version, it is because probably it needs a couple dozen of work to update the internal rxjs to rc1.\n. A good way of moving from padawan to jedi is to provide some description in the issue.\n. Much better. Let's say what @filipesilva has to say.\n. The browser used for testing your application. Be free to change it to what you want.\n. First time ever I see that. Are you running it with our provided local server?\n. Sorry I don't get the problem / idea.\n. You would need to use https://github.com/systemjs/builder\n. My bad, I Was using this repo for testing approaches.. the ~ means that it will install that version or any patch version. So it means that it will install any 2.2.x version, including 2.2.3. That shouldn't happen. Clear your node_modules and try again.. Because this is not angular-cli. This is the starting point of the examples of the documentation.. Thanks for the PR mate, but that is explained in the previous part of the tutorial, how to add it.. Sorry, this is not the right repo for support. Better choice is to ask in stackoverflow.\r\n\r\nThanks.. This project doesn't have a way to build it.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we publish the \"building guide\" we will add some.. Install a newer npm. Newer npm, not node. Latest is 4, but with a 3.10.x it is happy . This is not a seed. This is a mirror repository for documentation purposes. I do know. Bash for Windows doesn't support networking, so servers won't work. @ibqn git bash is one thing, Bash for Windows is a completely different beast.\r\n\r\nGit bash is just a bash that comes with the git installation. Bash for Windows brings the linux ecosystem oficially to windows and it is like a more \"native\" solution.\r\n\r\nTheir current support for features is completely different.. @ibqn It is not. There is something called \"Bash for Windows\" literally. It is not the concept of \"there is a bash for windows\" like gitbash as you said, it is a tool called like that.\r\n\r\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about. Yes, you speak the truth, but is also true that when people talks about WSL, they refer to it as _Bash for/on Windows_ (see OP). When they talk about git bash, they say gitbash.\r\n\r\nIf you want to change `Bash for Windows` to `Windows subsystem for Linux` on the readme, feel free to open a PR..

Hey, nice to see that you are working on the tour of heroes, but I believe your PR is meant for a different repo :). It is hero.service not hero-service. There is a PR for that, will be there soon. Did you read the error? It is quite clear.. `app/app.component.ts(13,29): error TS1005: ';' expected.`. Both problems are unrelated.\r\n\r\nStay in TS 2.0.10, 2.1 is not compatible with AOT.. Yes, I just answered that issue.\r\n\r\nYou need to lock the @types/jasmine into a previous version. Latest one is broken for us.. https://github.com/angular/quickstart/issues/380. This issue is getting out of hand. The original issue was hopefully fix.. There is no task called \"lite\". uhm?. it is trying to create a new instance of your terminal or something and doesn't find it. I have no idea :/. Uhh, honest mistake. Feel free to open a PR. I had this PR hanging and I thought we never did it.. No worries my friend, we are making a lot of changes right now in those aspects.\r\n\r\nWe have a deploy guide and we will update the quickstart as well.. The webpack guide is getting better and better and it comes with fully development, test and production. Will bring AOT soon..

Yeah, that jasmine types has a breaking change and we cannot support that yet. You need to lock it to the previous version for now. I have a PR standing to fix that.. define what is not working.. are you sure you deleted the old @types from node_modules? Delete the folder and `npm install` again.. Whether this is not really an angular issue, if you update your package.json and even if you `npm install`, iy won't replace packages. That mean that if you change the line of jasmine by hand, even if you `npm install` it will ignore it. You would need to remove the package from `node_modules` and install it again.. Yes please, update your node, it is like 10 years old minimum. Check the README to see what versions we expect.. This repository is now deprecated.

You can't do this stuff here. The quickstart is a systemjs project. You can't convert it to CLI just by installing two packages.. Why are you people trying to do \"ng build\" here? This is not a cli project nor is meant to be. nor ng serve. This is a completely different thing. Don't do it.. to what problem?. And why are you running `ng serve`?. No, `ng serve` is a command that the Angular CLI applications have. This is not an Angular CLI application so that command doesn't exist.\r\n\r\nIt is like trying to use a plane like if it were a car. They both travels, but they are different things.\r\n\r\nThis starter has a `npm start` for starting a server.. I feel like I am invisible. **Don't use this project like a CLI application, I created this repo, I know what I am talking about.**\r\n\r\nIt is up to you.\r\n\r\nWhat is that tutorial @shubhaem ?. @marslan2037 This project is not optimized for deployments, it says so in the readme.

What do you mean with missing? . And why should it be there?. That demo project is completely not related to this repo, so it is a mistake on their tutorial.. I see, but this quickstart is for the official angular docs. If they are using it (which is fine) and doesn't provide all the needed steps, we cannot do anything from this part..

Uhm, we have the systemjs locked down because there was a breaking change that for some reason we didn't want that(maybe plunker related).\r\n\r\nSo I am unsure if we are going to hit that deprecation.

Sorry, which video?. Sorry, but that course is a third party course, not related to Google nor this Quickstart.\r\n\r\nThis quickstart was built for the angular.io examples.\r\n\r\nSo the right solution would be to ask the poeople at stackskills to update their videos.. You just asked at #498 heh.\r\n\r\nYou need to ask stackskills about the issue. We cannot do anything in our end.. do you have a `package.json` in that folder? It says it doesn't exist..

It is a valid concern, I had the same problem when I started working with this.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, you can easily hide the `.js` and `.js.map` files at VScode (only if they have a matching .ts):\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"**/*.js\": { \"when\": \"$(basename).ts\"},\r\n\"**/*.js.map\": true\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat in your settings.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this project is going to be deprecated in October.. When we started writing the docs, we had SystemJS and we created all our documentation around that. We had a \"quickstart\" guide that was the entry point of the rest of the docs. That was the time when Angular CLI didnt exist.\r\n\r\nNowadays, we don't have that quickstart guide anymore and all the documentation is being adapted for the Angular CLI.\r\n\r\nWhen that  happens, this repository will be deprecated. It served its purpose when we started, but today, Angular CLI is a better option in everything.. This repository is now deprecated.

The course is not ours so you need to ask the people behind the course or see in which date it was created and try to find a commit around that date (or a bit earlier). I cannot replicate it either. Node 5.5.0, npm 3.7.2 and OSX.\n. We updated the quickstart to all the latest versions.\n\nCould we confirm if this is still a problem?\n\nThank you.\n. Seems like you don't have the typings installed there.\n. do you have the typings installed?\n. For the sake of debugging, try running:\n\n`$ ./node_modules/.bin/typings install`\n\nAnd then:\n\n`$ npm start`\n. That is really weird. Do you have a typings folder? But still, that is a weird error.\n\nFor what is worth, the current version of this quickstart is not working correctly. It will be resolved shortly when beta .12 arrives.\n. not inside node_modules, in the root of your project.\n. Could you get the latest copy of this repo and try again? We updated it to the latest versions so it should do fine now.\n\nThank you.\n. If we confirm that there is no more errors, we just close this.\n. The current version of this repository is sadly broken. We are waiting to beta .12 to fix this issues.\n\nSo let's wait for that update and see if that fixes your issue or not.\n. Could you update the repo and try now please?\n. You need to include the router after you include angular:\n\n```\n<script src=\"node_modules/angular2/bundles/angular2.dev.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"node_modules/angular2/bundles/router.dev.js\"></script>\n```\n. This project is a mirror for what you can build on angular.io. A simpler and easier way to get started on the tutorials.\n\nThat being said, this is not the best channel to get this kind of support.\n\nThank you :)\n. That library is OSX only. Who's pulling that?\n. The problem is that we are not using that library directly. One of our dependencies are.\n. This seems to be an old issue with npm and doesn't seem to be resolved.\n\nLeaving the warning aside, it should work.\n\nWhich node & npm do you have?\n. That is something with your connection. Firewall or something.\n. if your browser has a proxy to access github, you can access it with the browser. You would need to setup the proxy for github in the CLI.\n\nI would check that.\n. I would check this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20370294/could-not-resolve-host-github-com-error-while-cloning-remote-repository-in-git\n. Thanks for your contribution, but we tell the user to delete the .git folder (they don't need it) so more or less history is not important for this use case.\n. Hello Wenchen, thanks for your issue.\n\nThis repository is not meant to be used on real projects, it is just a mirror of the tutorial at angular.io.\n\nSo the recommendation here is not to use this repository to build your own projects.\n\nCheers.\n. Yes, we plan on covering tooling in the tutorials, but I don't know how soon.\n. > We should talk about why you think it should be so restrictive.\n\nSounds good to me :+1: \n. This needs a review.\n. That is really weird. For the sake of trying. Clone the repo again in a new folder, it is like tsc is not finding the folder. I cannot reproduce :/\n. I am using latest typescript (global and in the package) and works for me in OSX.\n. Ill try on my windows box later.\n. Good stuff John. \n\nCould we add a npm script running the linter and update the README? \n\nAs an aside, what can you tell me about this tslint config? I need one for another project. \n. Hello, this is a duplicate of #45. The issue comes from chokidar. I suggest you research there for a solution. \n. You need to load the corresponding file in a script tag, like the router or HTTP. Also keep in mind this is a quickstart project.\n. Thanks for your contribution, but I think this is completely outside the purpose of this repository.\n. I can confirm this. I will research later.\n. So it is a reported issue already https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/8053.\n\nWith node 5.10.1 it works like a charm.\n. Sounds like typings not installed. Check for a typings folder in your project.\n. For some reason the typings folder is not created.\n\nTry\n\n$ ./node_modules/.bin/typings install\n\nAnd see if that creates it and works.\n. It should. I will check why it didn't.\n. node and npm versions are the problem here.\n. No, that is the bad solution. You need to add the typings.\n. Dup of #64 \n. LGTM\n. There are a lot like this lately. Said that I was trying to repro this like 5 hours ago and I forgot.\n\nThing is, typings should be installed automagically but somehow it doesn't happen for certain people. It does for me, even with fresh node installation.\n. What you mean with \"not installing\". Is giving an error?\n. Have you checked that you have the typings folder?\n. No, should be in root. do a:\n\n```\n$ node_modules/.bin/typings install\n```\n\nAnd see if that generates it.\n. What is your OS btw?\n. The thing is. It is there. The reason of why it is not doing the job automatically for you is still a mystery for me.\n. Concretely https://github.com/angular/quickstart/blob/master/package.json#L12\n\nthat should run after an \"npm install\"\n. Weird, it shouldn't take that long. It takes 2 second for me.\n\nI am using latest everything, including node and npm.\n. That is a legit bug. Would you like to create a PR to fix it? \ud83d\udc4d \n. I am not sure if the bot will verify it if you leave the issue closed.\n. We just released RC0. Let me put myself up to date and see what is going on.\n. show your package.json\n. show me your systemjs.config.js\n. add @angular/router-deprecated along with the others there.\n\nThat will tell system.js where to find @angular/router-deprecated when you ask for it and not give a 404\n. which tutorial?\n. that part contains no package.json nor systemjs.config.js.\n. It wasn't, we are changing too much stuff so that can happen. That is why I ask you, perhaps we left something out :)\n. We just released rc0 so we still need to do some adjustements. Give me a couple of hours until I figure things out.\n. I got no error for that. Weird.\n. That has been fixed.\n. There is a PR already to fix that. That is just a typo\n. No worries, that is never a bad idea :)\n. Or when another person have a moment :)\n\nhttps://github.com/angular/quickstart/pull/87\n. There is no support yet, if you need them like right now, use the PR I put at #87\n. That change is completely unrelated to your OS and it shouldn't make a difference. What problem do you have right now?\n. Yes, the problem is that the app has to run in a browser and not all browsers are able to run ES6 stuff so as today we need to transpile our apps to ES5 yes or yes.\n. This is just a quickstart project, if you want something that can be bundled and put into production, we suggest the angular-cli.\n. You can consider a simple script to do that. This project is a quickstart, the needed bits to get you started. You can use it and extend it your needs if you want to.\n\nBut from this concrete repository, we are not going to extend it in that way.\n. That error is not any helpful. What node & npm versions do you have?\n. Bump to 5.x and 3.x\n. Dependencies are always updated and they could stop supporting an old node and npm version.\n. @rmoen true, I didn't see it, my bad.\n. Node 6 is giving a lot of issues not only here but in other projects, even 6.1. I personally not recommend them yet.\n. Latest 5.x for the time being.\n. Yes, that is \"latest\" :)\n. Sorry sir but this issue tracker is not the best place for this kind of questions. We will post a VS cookbook soon.\n. Oh, I meant a cookbook with VS + asp.net. Basically how to set a solution like the one you are using.\n\nThis repo is a mirror of the quickstart on the web page, it not really a seed project (we have the angular-cli for that), so if you want to extend / modify it, better to use SO.\n. The problem is that our tools install typings after install, question is: why they don't for some people.\n. You tell me. I get the typings by default, other people too but suddenly, that is not the case for some Ubuntu users. Weird is that you are using OSX. Perhaps is beacuse you are using an old node & npm, but it shouldn't.\n. What npm version do you both have?\n. 0.10.x is really old, you need to update yes or yes.\n\nYou all need a 5.x node and npm 3.x\n. You are looking at a different package, you need https://www.npmjs.com/~angular\n. Tutorial issues go to the angular.io repo and that one is fixed, site will be updated soon.\n. Dup from #108 \n\nPlease, it doesn't cost much checking the recent closed issues.\n. Yes, but keep in mind that this repo is not for the quickstart guide. Quickstart guide lives in another repo with it own issue tracker\n. No, I didn't, but doesn't sound like a bad idea. So I am on it.\n. Said and done https://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/1461\n. All angular packages, zone.js, rx and reflect-metadata.\n. You need to add:\n\n```\n'angular2-in-memory-web-api': { main: 'index.js', defaultExtension: 'js' },\n```\n\nWe changed how the lib work in the past few days.\n\nSorry for the troubles.\n. You could start by installing the dependencies (`npm install`)\n. For that you need to `./node_modules/bin/typings install` or better yet, update your npm version.\n. Have you tried to run \"npm install\" again? That should install the typings as well. If not, do it by hand as I said in the previous message.\n. Oh sudo, why do you need sudo? Don't use it with sudo.\n. Sorry, this is not the right repository for that.\n. Please, post it again at the angular.io repo (where we have our documentation). This repo is just a mirror for the quickstart.\n\nThanks for the feedback.\n. Thanks, but the quickstart is just a mirror of the quickstart tutorial and we are not planning on adding any new feature to it.\n\nBundling is a nice feature, but the quickstart itself is not really doing any bundle not it does need that at the moment.\n. Weird, I see no hint there of what could be happening.\n. Thanks.\n. This is not the purpose of the quickstart. The quickstart is just to get you started on Angular 2 development.\n\nDeployment is outside this project necessities.\n\nWe will have proper docs on the CLI (including a deployment scenario) probably for next week.\n\nStay tuned.\n. You are missing the typings that for some reason, they fail under certain OS and node versions.\n\n./node_modules/.bin/typings install\n. Sorry about that, that is fixed by now.\n. That node is reaaaaaaaaaally old.\n. Is NPM probably the problematic one, but I recommend Node 5 at least.\n. That is expected and will be fixed soon. Still with that, it should work.\n. I am not really sure if a solution for npm 2.x is going to come.\n\nCan't it be updated to latest npm?\n\n`npm i -g npm`\n. LGTM\n. Did you `npm install` ?\n. We updated the instructions a bit ago.\n\nClosing this.\n. This quickstart was never done with asp.net in mind.\n. We have a guide for visual studio in the page. Do you mean that one?\n. Why remove angular2-in-memory-web-api?\n. This repo serves as a starting point for all tutorials at angular.io and some of them uses the in memory web api (the tutorial for example) so we simply assume that the in memory api is already there.\n\nThe router-deprecated will go away as soon as we sweep all the doc to use the new router, but that is not done yet.\n. Known issue. We have to wait to next week to fix it. The quickstart still works tho, it is just a warning. \n. Thanks.\n. Be sure to use npm 3.x\n. Better to keep them as script tags. We need to load zone.js before systemjs.\n. Because zone.js is picky enough and needs to be loaded before anything else or you could end working outside a zone and get no change detection.\n. Have you check in the README if your node & npm versions match the needed ones?\n. This is more of a backend thing and is outside the scope of this quickstart. \n. For some reason, your port 8080 is in use.\n. We don't depend on those libraries directly, is a dependency of a dependency. I will check if any of those dependencies got an update.\n. That doesn't say anything useful, I believe the proper error is before that blurb.\n. I need more information.\n. Hello, this is the wrong repository, this is just the quickstart (no webpack involved).\n\nI would consider stackoverflow for that.\n. Fixed, @filipesilva review please.\n. Changed that.\n. Yes, we needed to merge #184. Now it is done, and it should work for everyone.\n. Thanks for the PR.\n\nUnfortunately I cannot merge it.\n\nThis quickstart is not meant to be used an as starter point to \"any project\" (can be used for that, but is not the main goal).\n\nThis quickstart is a mirror of the \"Quickstart\" page at [angular.io](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html).\n\nIf you go there, you will see that the `FormsModule` is never mentioned, so if I merge this in here, this repo and that tutorial won't be in sync anymore.\n\nSince this \"Quickstart\" is meant to be a starting point for the documentation, we left it without the Forms because we explain what the FormsModule is at the forms tutorial and is there where we add it.\n\nNow, if you want a good starting point, you could start testing the webpack branch of the CLI.\n\nCheers.\n. Before you spend the time in that, I'm going to ask if we want that in this repo \n. You removed the typings command from that package.json.\n. Adding it back :P\n. That is the first time I see that error, seems like it cannot connect to that url for some reason (a self signed certificate).\n\nI have no idea at all.\n. What about the last line @hhhcube? :P\n. Yes, we are syncing the testing chapter with the quickstart so this will be fixed for next week.\n. RC6 doesn't have the `directives` property anymore.\n. You need NgModules, check the doc.\n. We will move to @types really soon.\n. Check again the instruction and the README :P\n. I need more info.\n\nThat file is optional and doesn't make any crash.\n. What is the error.\n. It is in the same folder, not an app folder\n\nEl 26 sept. 2016 10:12, \"Ahmed HABBACHI\" notifications@github.com\nescribi\u00f3:\n\n> in app.modules.ts i get the error in\n> import { AppComponent} from './app/app.component';\n> [ts] Cannot find module './app/app.component'.\n> \n> \u2014\n> You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/angular/quickstart/issues/229, or mute the thread\n> https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ABCZ1fl3O0sdZE3voGAk2rgBBgkTN2HAks5qt4yJgaJpZM4KGTC8\n> .\n. You are trying to install angular**2**-in-memory-web-api version 0.1.5+ and that **does not** exist. You need to get rid of that \"2\" on the name.\n. node_modules is excluded by default. Perhaps it is a bug with `atom-typescript` ?\n. Sorry, we cannot bump this dependencies. Angular has a strict dependency on rxjs and we are forced to use the same version that Angular requires, which is beta 12.\n\nAs soon as Angular bumps to any RC, we will update it.\n\nThank you for the PR tho.\n. Unfortunately, updating rxjs at angular is not as easy as that. There are a lot of rxjs code in the core and that needs a lot of work before you can update the version.\n\nSo, it is not like someone forgot to bump the version, it is because probably it needs a couple dozen of work to update the internal rxjs to rc1.\n. A good way of moving from padawan to jedi is to provide some description in the issue.\n. Much better. Let's say what @filipesilva has to say.\n. The browser used for testing your application. Be free to change it to what you want.\n. First time ever I see that. Are you running it with our provided local server?\n. Sorry I don't get the problem / idea.\n. You would need to use https://github.com/systemjs/builder\n. My bad, I Was using this repo for testing approaches.. the ~ means that it will install that version or any patch version. So it means that it will install any 2.2.x version, including 2.2.3. That shouldn't happen. Clear your node_modules and try again.. Because this is not angular-cli. This is the starting point of the examples of the documentation.. Thanks for the PR mate, but that is explained in the previous part of the tutorial, how to add it.. Sorry, this is not the right repo for support. Better choice is to ask in stackoverflow.\r\n\r\nThanks.. This project doesn't have a way to build it.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we publish the \"building guide\" we will add some.. Install a newer npm. Newer npm, not node. Latest is 4, but with a 3.10.x it is happy . This is not a seed. This is a mirror repository for documentation purposes. I do know. Bash for Windows doesn't support networking, so servers won't work. @ibqn git bash is one thing, Bash for Windows is a completely different beast.\r\n\r\nGit bash is just a bash that comes with the git installation. Bash for Windows brings the linux ecosystem oficially to windows and it is like a more \"native\" solution.\r\n\r\nTheir current support for features is completely different.. @ibqn It is not. There is something called \"Bash for Windows\" literally. It is not the concept of \"there is a bash for windows\" like gitbash as you said, it is a tool called like that.\r\n\r\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about. Yes, you speak the truth, but is also true that when people talks about WSL, they refer to it as _Bash for/on Windows_ (see OP). When they talk about git bash, they say gitbash.\r\n\r\nIf you want to change `Bash for Windows` to `Windows subsystem for Linux` on the readme, feel free to open a PR..

Hey, nice to see that you are working on the tour of heroes, but I believe your PR is meant for a different repo :). It is hero.service not hero-service. There is a PR for that, will be there soon. Did you read the error? It is quite clear.. `app/app.component.ts(13,29): error TS1005: ';' expected.`. Both problems are unrelated.\r\n\r\nStay in TS 2.0.10, 2.1 is not compatible with AOT.. Yes, I just answered that issue.\r\n\r\nYou need to lock the @types/jasmine into a previous version. Latest one is broken for us.. https://github.com/angular/quickstart/issues/380. This issue is getting out of hand. The original issue was hopefully fix.. There is no task called \"lite\". uhm?. it is trying to create a new instance of your terminal or something and doesn't find it. I have no idea :/. Uhh, honest mistake. Feel free to open a PR. I had this PR hanging and I thought we never did it.. No worries my friend, we are making a lot of changes right now in those aspects.\r\n\r\nWe have a deploy guide and we will update the quickstart as well.. The webpack guide is getting better and better and it comes with fully development, test and production. Will bring AOT soon..

Yeah, that jasmine types has a breaking change and we cannot support that yet. You need to lock it to the previous version for now. I have a PR standing to fix that.. define what is not working.. are you sure you deleted the old @types from node_modules? Delete the folder and `npm install` again.. Whether this is not really an angular issue, if you update your package.json and even if you `npm install`, iy won't replace packages. That mean that if you change the line of jasmine by hand, even if you `npm install` it will ignore it. You would need to remove the package from `node_modules` and install it again.. Yes please, update your node, it is like 10 years old minimum. Check the README to see what versions we expect.. This repository is now deprecated.

You have `System.js` which is what we use in this quickstart, you have `Webpack` which is also highly popular and used in other \"quickstarts\" like this and then you have the `CLI` which is another tool.\r\n\r\nThis quickstart is not an Angular CLI project so it doesn't have the `.angular-cli.json`.. Weird, those types comes from `@types/jasmine`. Weird, it is like your `npm install` didn't install everything. It is not finding `concurrently`. This repository is now deprecated.

You can't do this stuff here. The quickstart is a systemjs project. You can't convert it to CLI just by installing two packages.. Why are you people trying to do \"ng build\" here? This is not a cli project nor is meant to be. nor ng serve. This is a completely different thing. Don't do it.. to what problem?. And why are you running `ng serve`?. No, `ng serve` is a command that the Angular CLI applications have. This is not an Angular CLI application so that command doesn't exist.\r\n\r\nIt is like trying to use a plane like if it were a car. They both travels, but they are different things.\r\n\r\nThis starter has a `npm start` for starting a server.. I feel like I am invisible. **Don't use this project like a CLI application, I created this repo, I know what I am talking about.**\r\n\r\nIt is up to you.\r\n\r\nWhat is that tutorial @shubhaem ?. @marslan2037 This project is not optimized for deployments, it says so in the readme.

It is a valid concern, I had the same problem when I started working with this.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, you can easily hide the `.js` and `.js.map` files at VScode (only if they have a matching .ts):\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"**/*.js\": { \"when\": \"$(basename).ts\"},\r\n\"**/*.js.map\": true\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat in your settings.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this project is going to be deprecated in October.. When we started writing the docs, we had SystemJS and we created all our documentation around that. We had a \"quickstart\" guide that was the entry point of the rest of the docs. That was the time when Angular CLI didnt exist.\r\n\r\nNowadays, we don't have that quickstart guide anymore and all the documentation is being adapted for the Angular CLI.\r\n\r\nWhen that  happens, this repository will be deprecated.

Am I the only person who thinks that is a bad solution? Having a target of ES6 means that the Typescript compiler is going to compile your Typescript code not to ECMAScript 5, but ECMAScript 6. ES6 is _quite far from being fully supported_. [See the Kangax ES6 compatibility tables](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/) if you  are uncertain of this. If your project is going live on the internet, and it likely is, you _probably_ want users with the non-latest browsers (IE11, 10, 9, many phone browsers) to still be able to use your product. Safari doesn't even support a single part of the fat arrow function syntax, for instance.\n\nWhy does it fix the error, then? The reason setting your target to ES6 works is because ES6 natively supports promises.\n\n### For anyone else who is coming here and thinks that targeting ES6 is a mistake here's the deal:\n\nAs of the time of this writing we should be using Typescript 2.0+. There's really no good reason not to with angular in final release status. The NG2 quickstart now provides TS2.0+ as a default starter version in their package.json, and the Typescript team is focused on it \n\nThere are a few typings definitions needed for Angular. The new recommendation according to TS is to use NPM to manage your Typings, and we can finally ditch this huge confusing headache that was Typings definitions/config files. Angular 2 uses core-js, so we need to use:\n\n`npm install --save-dev @types/core-js`\n\nMany of your other `cannot find name [some-symbol]` errors will/should now be solved by simply installing your typings via NPM to your package.json. I don't even have a typings.config file anymore.\n\nSounds too good to be true, doesn't it? Well it's not. It's the future, and we're already in it. Sweet.\n\n[Read more here](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/consumption.html) on the TS 2.0 way to consume typings.\n\nP.S. I do still think that _finding_ typings definitions is the biggest pain, since there is usually no good correlation between a \"missing name\" and what typings definition actually provides support for that, but that's a different (and very frustrating) topic.\n. # Don't change your target to ES6!!\n\n@bedrin I don't mean this to be condescending or rude, but do you understand what changing your target to ES6 means? Am I the only person who thinks that is a bad solution? Having a target of ES6 means that the Typescript compiler is going to compile your Typescript code not to ECMAScript 5, but ECMAScript 6. ES6 is _quite far from being fully supported_. [See the Kangax ES6 compatibility tables](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/) if you  are uncertain of this.

It used to be 2.0.0-rc.0, but I switched all to 2.0.0-rc.1.  I ran npm update, restarted the server, but still getting the 404.\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"angular2-quickstart\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"start\": \"tsc && concurrently \\\"npm run tsc:w\\\" \\\"npm run lite\\\" \",\n    \"lite\": \"lite-server\",\n    \"postinstall\": \"typings install\",\n    \"tsc\": \"tsc\",\n    \"tsc:w\": \"tsc -w\",\n    \"typings\": \"typings\"\n  },\n  \"license\": \"ISC\",\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@angular/common\":  \"2.0.0-rc.1\",\n    \"@angular/compiler\":  \"2.0.0-rc.1\",\n    \"@angular/core\":  \"2.0.0-rc.1\",\n    \"@angular/http\":  \"2.0.0-rc.1\",\n    \"@angular/platform-browser\":  \"2.0.0-rc.1\",\n    \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\":  \"2.0.0-rc.1\",\n    \"@angular/router-deprecated\":  \"2.0.0-rc.1\",\n    \"@angular/upgrade\":  \"2.0.0-rc.1\",\n\n```\n\"systemjs\": \"0.19.27\",\n\"es6-shim\": \"^0.35.0\",\n\"reflect-metadata\": \"^0.1.3\",\n\"rxjs\": \"5.0.0-beta.6\",\n\"zone.js\": \"^0.6.12\",\n\n\"angular2-in-memory-web-api\": \"0.0.5\",\n\"bootstrap\": \"^3.3.6\"\n```\n\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"concurrently\": \"^2.0.0\",\n    \"lite-server\": \"^2.2.0\",\n    \"typescript\": \"^1.8.10\",\n    \"typings\":\"^0.8.1\"\n  }\n}\n.

Which version are you recommending? \n. @Foxandxss can you be specific ?\n. @Foxandxss 5.11.1 ? \n. @Foxandxss confirmed this fixes the issue for me.  Thank you. @CCChristphe you should be able to resolve your issues by upgrading to 5.11.1 and running npm install.\n. @happyshandilya i'm on npm 3.3.6 if that helps.  Otherwise I'm not sure.  @CCChristphe you can upgrade your node to whatever version you want with npm.  Google how to upgrade node with npm.\n. ",

Thanks so much, `imports: [FormsModule],` did the trick.\n\nI'm paying close attention to testing, and want to make sure that all of the tests run at the end of each part of the tutorial.\n\nFWIW, the testing support you have with the QuickStart and tutorial is very valuable to me.\nBut I struggle when I have to change it for another project structure.\nI think I have it working now in: https://github.com/psnider/angular2-quickstart-rc5/tree/restructured\nwhich is for a TypeScript-only micro-service project I'm working on: \n- [node.js service for people, with Angular2 web-app](https://github.com/psnider/people-service)\n- [NativeScript mobile-app for people](https://github.com/psnider/people-mobile)\n. ### The bits that make it a struggle\n- How are URLs from the browser transformed by each component of the test system?  \n- The karma config and system.js config are complex. I'm confused by what configuration fields mean, and what they affect.\n- Related config information must be specified in multiple places, but I'm unclear on the differences\n- What does /base/ (in karma.conf.js) mean?\n- Many symbol names collide, making it difficult to understand scope and usage.\n\n### Details\n\nTrying to configure karma and systemjs has been very difficult.\nI would appreciate any references you could provide me.\n\n**karma**\nI can't say I understand how karma works yet, and there doesn't seem to be much of a tutorial.\nAll I've found is: http://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/intro/how-it-works.html,\nwhich is surprisingly terse. It refers to a masters thesis, which I haven't read yet, but I'm looking for something in between, and which is specific to karma.\n\nThe karma configuration seems to be much more complex than what is described in http://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/config/configuration-file.html and http://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/config/files.html.\n\n**systemjs**\nI feel I have a better understanding of the system.js loader.\nI found the documentation on the https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs to be easier to understand, but it is still a complex component that will take me some fair time and work to understand.\n\n**karma and system.js together with angular**\nIn particular, I'd like to understand the details of how browser URLs are sent to the karma server, and how they are resolved. I don't understand what resolution is performed in the browser, and what is performed by the karma server, which paths are relative, and which are from the root.  The documentation seems to assume that the reader already understands these things. I also don't understand what the special prefix **/base/** refers, and I can't find documentation that discusses this.\n\nAnother point of confusion is that the same symbol names are used for many things. \nI think that using a separate symbols for each concept would help greatly.\nIn particular, **app** has many uses, and I believe many people in the community assume that it's use is required, for example this [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38886456/how-do-i-configure-the-code-directories-in-karma-for-angular2). I'm used to web-apps not knowing the file system structure of the server, but it seems like many portions of the URLs are expected to match.\n\n**changing the project directory structure**\nI have several components in one project.\nYou can find my first attempt in the [browser-angular2 component of people-service](https://github.com/psnider/people-service/tree/master/components/browser-angular2).\nThis was basically working, but broke when zone.js upgraded, see [issue](https://github.com/angular/quickstart/issues/186).\nThen as I started to work through this, the tutorial was updated to RC5, so I'm redoing the work to incorporate it.\n. @filipesilva @wardbell \nThanks so much!\nFor now, my all-TypeScript micro-service project, https://github.com/psnider/people-service, is almost complete! \nI'm trying to use best practices for everything, especially testing.\n\nNow I'm only missing one thing:\n- karma testing!\n  I still have to go over the testing guide you reference above.\n\nI'd greatly appreciate you keeping me up to date with any improvements to the karma documentation!\n\nPlease feel free to comment directly on my project, if you like.\n. I'm not familiar with zone.js yet, but found the cause by comparing an older working tutorial, and the latest version.  I compared the results of _npm list_ in the two workspaces, then I narrowed the problem down to zone.js.\n. I signed the CLA\n. Found a solution!\n\nFiguring perhaps the spec test needs to know about HeroDetailComponent, I modified  app/app.component.spec.ts, by adding:\n\n```\nimport { HeroDetailComponent } from './hero-detail.component';\n```\n\nand changing beforeEach() to include HeroDetailComponent in its declarations:\n\n```\n  beforeEach(() => {\n    TestBed.configureTestingModule({\n      imports: [FormsModule],\n      declarations: [AppComponent, HeroDetailComponent]\n    });\n  });\n```\n\nPlease update the tutorial to include these changes.\n. Found another solution, that I like better:\n\nInstead of the changing app/app.component.spec.ts as above, modify **app/app.component.ts**:\n\nadd this import at the top:\n\n```\nimport { HeroDetailComponent } from './hero-detail.component';\n```\n\nthen add this **directives** field to the **@Component decorator**:\n\n```\n  directives: [HeroDetailComponent]\n```\n. Please update the tutorial with whichever change is preferable.\n. I believe I have a solution:\n\nAfter working through the tutorial slowly, I discovered that the problem is introduced when the **routerLinkActive** directive is added.\n\nI added this import to app/app.component.ts, and it seems to resolve the karma problems.\n\n```\nimport { RouterLinkActive } from '@angular/router';\n```\n\nPlease let me know if this is a correct fix.\nIf it is, please update the tutorial.\n\nAlso, it seems that the error message should be made more specific, if possible. \nIt gave me no information that helped me locate the source of  the problem.\n. same here for commit-id 73f4a820f271e9463103dfb52f92989abfa9c284\n\non Mac OSX 10.11.6\n[output of npm list](https://gist.github.com/psnider/119cee8139a2c4e568b064494272b973)\n.

I believe I have a solution:\n\nAfter working through the tutorial slowly, I discovered that the problem is introduced when the **routerLinkActive** directive is added.\n\nI added this import to app/app.component.ts, and it seems to resolve the karma problems.\n\n```\nimport { RouterLinkActive } from '@angular/router';\n```\n\nPlease let me know if this is a correct fix.\nIf it is, please update the tutorial.\n\nAlso, it seems that the error message should be made more specific, if possible. \nIt gave me no information that helped me locate the source of  the problem.\n. same here for commit-id 73f4a820f271e9463103dfb52f92989abfa9c284\n\non Mac OSX 10.11.6\n[output of npm list](https://gist.github.com/psnider/119cee8139a2c4e568b064494272b973)\n.

So, my node_modules/.bin/ directory is empty. And that's the reason of the problem.\nTry 'npm bin' and see is your bin directory empty or not.\nThe solution is quite simple, you just have to change 'scripts' in packages.json to use local versions of the packages like that:\n\n``` javascript\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"start\": \"node ./node_modules/concurrently/src/main.js \\\"npm run tsc:w\\\" \\\"npm run lite\\\" \",\n  \"lite\": \"./node_modules/lite-server/bin/lite-server\",\n  \"tsc\": \"./node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc\",\n  \"tsc:w\": \"./node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc -w\"\n}\n```\n. @egeogretmen hey, I have the same issue and I have a solution for that.

Looking at the Angular docs, I found the `TestBed` has some `.overrideX()` methods (`.overrideModule`, `.overrideComponent`, etc...).  One of these is `.overrideProvider`.  To simplify this a bit (and make it feel a bit more like working in mocha/chai/sinon), I configured my `.component.spec.ts` like-a-so:\r\n```typescript\r\ndiscribe('HeroesComponent', () => {\r\n  let component: HeroesComponent;\r\n  let fixture: ComponentFixture<HeroesComponent>;\r\n  let mockHeroesService: MockHeroesService;\r\n\r\n  beforeEach(async(() => {\r\n    mockHeroesService = new MockHeroesService();\r\n    TestBed.overrideProvider(HeroesService, { useValue: mockHeroesService });\r\n\r\n    TestBed.configureTestingModule({\r\n      declarations: [ HeroesComponent ],\r\n      providers: [ HeroesService ]\r\n    })\r\n    .compileComponents();\r\n  }));\r\n\r\n  beforeEach(() => {\r\n    fixture = TestBed.createComponent(HeroesComponent);\r\n    component = fixture.componentInstance;\r\n    fixture.detectChanges();\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  it('should call the heroesService\\'s getHeroes method', () => {\r\n    // Arrange\r\n    spyOn(mockHeroesService, 'getHeroes').and.returnValue([]);\r\n\r\n    // Act\r\n    component.getHeroes();\r\n\r\n    // Assert\r\n    expect(mockHeroesService.getHeroes).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n\r\nclass MockHeroesService extends HeroesService {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI like this approach a bit more than the inject example above, just feels cleaner and less confusing.\r\nAnother thing to note is that TestBed overrides need to happen before `.createComponent` is called.  I tried the `.overrideProvider` call after `.compileComponents` and before `.createComponent` in the 2nd beforeEach, and it still worked fine.\r\nIf, for whatever reason, the `.overrideProvider` needs to be called within a test (after `.createComponent`)(@trichetriche), all the setup in the 2nd beforeEach would need to get called again afterwards, but I don't see why that would be needed when the mock service can easily have spies and return values stubbed after the override.\r\n\r\nI used the above example based on what the angular-cli generates from the command `ng generate component Heroes` for the spec file (v1.2.1).

It's a minefield, and seemingly an exercise that (for now out least) is left to the developer.\r\n\r\nI'm still working on it, but I'm gonna finish my webpack config and post it as an alternative to the starter kits currently out there. Hopefully it helps save someone else 3 days of their life trying to get 'hello world' to compile.\r\n\r\nThe CLI is a great effort, but hiding the set-up behind magic is going to bite people in the ass before too long. Anyone coming from a 'magic' framework like Meteor will know exactly what I'm talking about.. And, I'm sure I speak for others @Foxandxss, I certainly appreciate all efforts to build something like this quickstart guide. My main peev as a new user is lack of 'official' consistency. A user is either faced with going it alone or trusting everything to the CLI. Neither is ideal.\r\n\r\nA simple, solid webpack starter that works in browsers and generates first-page HTML - and is **kept up to date** - would be awesome.\r\n\r\nI'll post my attempt at that here when it's finished, hopefully in the next couple of days..
