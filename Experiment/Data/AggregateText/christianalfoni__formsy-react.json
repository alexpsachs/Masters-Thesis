    "christianalfoni": "Hi @cmwelsh and thanks for you feedback :-)\n\nWhen it comes to usability I would recommend validating on blur, not on submit as that will feel a bit annoying I think. That said, if the user would insert an email and hit submit, that would cause the input to blur and you would get the same effect. But there is one problem and that is the submit button. It will be disabled if an input is invalid after a submit and you would not be able to resubmit until the input was manually blurred. But I have a suggestion that will require me to implement a fix.\n\nDoes this seem like an okay solution?:\n\n``` javascript\nvar MyInput = React.createClass({\n  mixins: [Formsy.Mixin],\n  changeValue: function (event) {\n    this.setValue(event.currentTarget.value);\n  },\n  render: function () {\n    var color = 'gray';\n    if (this.showError()) {\n      color = 'red';\n    }\n    var border = {\n      border: '1px solid ' + color\n    };\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <input style={border} onBlur={this.changeValue}/>\n        <span>{this.getErrorMessage()}</span> \n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n});\n\nvar MyTestComp = React.createClass({\n  render: function () {\n    return (\n      <Formsy.Form url=\"http://localhost:3000/postform\" hideSubmit>\n        <MyInput name=\"email\" validations=\"isEmail\" validationError=\"This is not an email\"/>\n        <button type=\"submit\">submit</button>\n      </Formsy.Form>\n    );\n  }\n});\n```\n\nAs you can see I hide the \"native\" submit button and roll my own. You also see the input setting its value on blur instead of change.\n\nIf this solution is acceptable I will make the change to let developers use their own submit button. The onBlur part already works :-)\n\nWhen it comes to your second suggestion, I am a bit unsure what you mean. Maybe you could clarify with a specific example?\n\nThanks again for the feedback and glad this helped you out! :-)\n. Hi @mschipperheyn!\n\nI am working on an idea to exclude the buttons from the Formsy.Form itself and let you as a developer decide where they should be an how they should behave. Need to figure a couple of things out first though. I will let you know :-)\n\nI totally agree with your statement.\n\nI will let you know when I have worked out the idea and ask for your feedback before implementing :-)\n. Hi again @mschipperheyn , this is what I suggest:\n\nSince the lib is pretty new I would like to do an API change. First remove anything related to default buttons:\n\n``` javascript\nFormsy.defaults({\n  contentType: 'urlencoded', // default: 'json'\n  hideSubmit: true, // REMOVE IT\n  submitButtonClass: 'btn btn-success', // REMOVE IT\n  cancelButtonClass: 'btn btn-default', // REMOVE IT\n  buttonWrapperClass: 'my-wrapper' // REMOVE IT\n});\n```\n\nInstead add two new handlers for the form:\n\n``` javascript\n<Formsy.Form onInvalid={this.disableButtons} onValid={this.enableButtons}></Formsy.Form>\n```\n\nThat way you get a lot more flexibility. Yes, you would have to code that default behavior yourself, but the API is simpler and more flexible.\n\nWhat do you think?\n. Got those handlers in place :-)\n. Hehe, no worries @srconklin :-)\n\nIf you have time to summarize where the mistakes were made, I could update the readme and make some things more clear. To prevent others meeting those same challenges. \n\nIf you have time and see any value in it of course :-)\n. Hi again @mschipperheyn!\n\nThis is a great feature. I will add this with the handling of submit button. I suggest adding a \"headers\" object in the Formsy defaults config and of course as an attribute on the Formsy.Form components.\n\nThat seems okay?\n. Hi @mschipperheyn , got new version out with headers option. I chose not to go further than just the header object for now. Let me know if you get into a situation where more is needed :-)\n. @mschipperheyn No worries, thanks for checking out the lib :-)\n. Fantastic Laust, your are now the top contributor ;-)\n. AwesomeI Will just change \"isWordsSpecial\" to \"isSpecialWords\". Reads more human like ;-)\n. Hi @ztsmith , sorry about that and thanks for pointing it out. The 0.4.1 tag is now pushed to the repo :-)\n. Great! Thanks for the help :-)\n. Thanks for the pull request!\n. Hi @FoxxMD , this is a very good point!\n\nWe could add a new method to the form elements, something like: \"isPristine()\"? So you could check:\n\n``` javascript\nif (this.isRequired() && this.isPristine()) {\n  // Show required\n}\n```\n\nCould that work?\n. Hi again,\n\n**What triggers the change?**\nGood point! :-) Conceptually you want to tell the parent form when the input is \"touched\", whatever that might be. By default that would be when the input changes its value, which lets us hook up \"isPrestine\" to the \"setValue\" method. But as you say, you might do it when blurring. To keep things simple I would suggest that you would have to run \"this.setValue(this.getValue())\" when blurring to achieve the prestine effect. That will keep the API simple, as it is only the \"setValue\" method that changes the pristine value. I fear the API becomes very complex if you get too much control of this. What do you think? \n\n**Could all inputs be triggered globally?**\nAnother good point! :-) I agree that submitting the form should set all elements to `\u00ecsPrestine() -> false`, as kind of a \"global touch\". At least make that part of the first implementation. It can be reconsidered if there is feedback on scenarios where that might be a problem. This happens in the background so can easily change it.\n\n**Programatic triggering?**\nHm, yeah, it is an interesting scenario. Though I think it will add too much complexity, at least for now. I think it is a good idea to get some more experience with \"prestining\" in Formsy :-)\n\nLet me know what you think and we can start the implementation. I think it is time to bring in some tests now too, so that should also be part of the next release. Feel free to contribute to this with pull requests, or I will start on this next Wednesday :-) \n. Hi again @FoxxMD!\n\nI have the day off tomorrow so I will be looking into all current issues and create tests, but do feel free to apply a pull request, it would be cool to see how you would solve it in the current codebase :-)\n\nAbout your question I do see your point, but I think it should be up to the developer to decide if the form could be submitted or not while invalid. For example by disabling the submit button when the form is invalid. That is why the \"onInvalid\" and \"onValid\" handlers where introduced. Give more flexibility :-) Does that make sense? Please let me know if there are scenarios I have not considered.\n. Okay, this is now in the code, also with a test. Will be part of todays release.\n. Hi Scott!\n\nYou know what, we seem to have forgotten to document the \"value\" attribute.\n\n``` javascript\n<MyElement value=\"whatever\"/>\n```\n\nThat should set the default value :-) Will update the readme now!\n\nDid that solve your problem?\n. I am having a look at this tomorrow, thanks for the feedback :-)\n. Hi again,\n\nThis is now fixed :-)\n\nWill be part of the release later today.\n. Hm, it is not fixed, broke all the tests.\n\nIt creates a circular reaction where the change of that value requires a new validation which again sets the value and again validates and so on.\n\nActually I think you have to structure this a bit differently. Instead of using the \"defaultValue\" on the input I would do this:\n\n``` javascript\n  componentWillReceiveProps: function (nextProps) {\n\n   // Only change to the new default value if it is currently showing the old one\n    if (this.getValue() === this.props.defaultValue && nextProps.defaultValue !== this.props.defaultValue) {\n      this.setValue(nextProps.defaultValue);\n    }\n  },\n```\n\nAnd if you want an empty input to change into the default input:\n\n``` javascript\n  changeValue: function (event) {\n    this.setValue(event.target.value || this.props.defaultValue);\n  }\n```\n\nI think this will solve your problem :-)\n. Let me know if I misunderstand, but you want the input to show \"John\" instantly?\n\nI think the easiest way to achieve this is by also passing it as a value:\n\n``` javascript\n<Formsy.Form url=\"/users\" onSuccess={this.changeUrl} onValid={this.enableButton} onInvalid={this.disableButton}>\n  <Form.Input name=\"firstName\" required value={this.state.profile.first} defaultValue={this.state.profile.first}/>\n  <button type=\"submit\" disabled={!this.state.canSubmit}>Submit</button>\n</Formsy.Form>\n```\n\nSo you handle the \"initial value\" using the normal \"value\" attribute, and your custom \"defaultValue\" attribute as the fallback value. You could consider also using the \"componentWillMount\" method to grab the \"defaultValue\" prop and set the value of the input:\n\n``` javascript\nvar Input = React.createClass({\n    mixins: [Formsy.Mixin],\n    componentWillMount: function () {\n      this.setValue(this.props.defaultValue);\n    },\n    changeValue: function(event) {\n        this.setValue(event.currentTarget.value || this.props.defaultValue);\n    },\n    componentWillReceiveProps: function (nextProps) {\n        // Only change to the new default value if it is currently showing the old one\n        if (this.getValue() === this.props.defaultValue && nextProps.defaultValue !== this.props.defaultValue) {\n            this.setValue(nextProps.defaultValue);\n        }\n    },\n    render: function() {\n        var className = this.showRequired() ? 'required' : this.showError() ? 'error' : null;\n        var errorMessage = this.getErrorMessage();\n\n        return (\n            <div className={className}>\n                <input type=\"text\" value={this.getValue()} onChange={this.changeValue} />\n            </div>\n        );\n    }\n});\n```\n\nThen you do not have to pass the \"value\" attribute at all, as the \"defaultValue\" attribute will be the initial value of the input.\n\nHopefully I understood the problem :-)\n. Hi yeah, that sounds right :-)\n\nMaybe you should consider not rendering the form until the async mixin is done?\n. Hi there,\n\nCould you try updating to the latest version of the lib? It now supports dynamically inserted form elements, which I think might fix your problem too. Let me know if not and we will dive into this a bit more :-)\n. Hi there,\n\nGood to hear that it works! Hm, yeah, it could handle undefined as an empty string. But again:\n\n``` javascript\n<Formsy.Form url=\"/users\" onSuccess={this.changeUrl} onValid={this.enableButton} onInvalid={this.disableButton}>\n  <MyOwnInput name=\"email\" value={this.state.profile.email || ''} />\n  <button type=\"submit\" disabled={!this.state.canSubmit}>Submit</button>\n</Formsy.Form>\n```\n\nWould also work. It should at least throw an error. Have to think about that :-)\n\nThe issue with `componentWillReceiveProps` is that a `setValue` call will trigger a new form validation, which again triggers `componentWillReceiveProps`. So you should get a loop. You could of course just do:\n\n``` javascript\ncomponentWillReceiveProps: function (nextProps) {\n  if (nextProps.value !== this.getValue()) {\n    this.setValue(nextProps.value);\n  }    \n},\n```\n\nI think :-)\n. Thanks for input @ppiekarczyk. This should be handled by Formsy now. About the pristine vs default value. Would you set up a new issue on the problem, if it still exists? Loosing my overview powers on this issue ;-)\n. Hi @MattAitchison,\n\nYeah, it should go through children of children until it meets a child with a \"name\" attribute or is at the end branch. Your experience differs?\n. Ah, sorry, I misunderstood. Currently it does not handle that. I am having a Formsy day tomorrow, so I will look into this :-)\n. Btw, how do you feel about just mapping the inputs to whatever you want instead? To me it does feel a bit weird to declare data structure in the \"HTML\" of the component. An example could be:\n\n``` javascript\nvar mapModel = function (model) {\n  return {\n    \"startYear\": model.startYear,\n    \"endYear\": model.endYear,\n    \"terms\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"term1\",\n        \"startDate\": model.term1_startDate\n        \"endDate\": model.term1_endDate\n      }\n      {\n        \"name\": \"term2\",\n        \"startDate\": model.term2_startDate\n        \"endDate\": model.term2_endDate\n      }\n    ]\n  };\n};\n<Formsy.Form mapModel={mapModel}/>\n```\n\nThis gives a lot more freedom and it reduces code complexity a lot. It also prevents locking an \"HTML\"-definition into a certain data structure. What do you think?\n. Okay, goody, I have added a \"mapping\" property to the form where you can do as explained in the previous comment. Will be part of release later today :-)\n. DOH :-) Thanks @smokku!\n. New release pushed\n. You are perfectly right, working on bug fix release now :-)\n\nNext release will include tests as this is starting to shape up quite nicely!\n. New release is pushed\n. Hi guys,\n\nWe have this API now:\n\n``` javascript\nvar Comp = React.createClass({\n  onSubmit: function (data, resetForm, invalidateForm) {\n     myAjaxService('/url', data)\n      .error(function (errors) {\n        errors // { test: \"Not valid input says the server\" }\n        invalidateForm(errors);\n      }); \n  }, \n  render: function () {\n    return (\n      <Formsy.Form onSubmit={this.onSubmit}>\n        <MyInput name=\"test\"/>\n      </Formsy.Form>\n    );\n  }\n});\n```\n\nYou could basically do whatever you want when server responds, but to map to inputs you use the \"invalidateForm\" callback.\n\nDoes that solve it? Maybe the documentation is lacking a bit here?\n. Hi @drewhamlett !\n\nDo you want to validate the form values before they are passed to the server? Or do you want to validate values passed from server before they are put into the form?\n\nWell... basically, do you want something like: `Formsy.validate(myValue, 'isEmail')` ? :-)\n. Hi again :-)\n\nThat is good to hear!\n\nAha, of course, now I understand. In theory this should work just fine, just have to implement promises support. The only restriction I see is that you might get into trouble if you run it a lot. You could add a debounce thingy around it though. Hm hm...\n\nLet me think about it and try it out, I think it should be good. It is a good idea :-)\n. Okay, so I thought about it some more. It adds a lot of complexity and it is an edge case. Is is even valid to ask the question if this really is the responsibility of Formsy.\n\nI would suggest using a \"required\" on this form element and do the ajax stuff inside it. Only if you get a valid value back from your ajax request you actually set the value, `setValue()`, which will fulfill the \"required\" and make the form element valid. \n\nDoes that make sense?\n. Just closing this as it is getting old\n. Ah, awesome, here it is :-)\n\nI will go through it tomorrow and create a new release. Thank you! :-)\n. This looks great! Thanks :-) Writing some tests and adding a couple of other things and will make a new release!\n. Hi @burtyish,\n\nActually, the input itself does not need a name attribute. Create your own credit card info formsy element, something like:\n\n``` javascript\nvar CreditCardInfoInput = React.createClass({\n  mixins: [Formsy.Mixin],\n  updateValue: function (event) {\n    this.setValue(event.target.value);\n  },\n  render: function () {\n    return <input value={this.getValue()} onChange={this.updateValue}/>\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThis wraps your plain input, without a name attribute, into a formsy element. You can now use it like this:\n\n``` javascript\n<Formsy.Form>\n  <CreditCardInfoInput name=\"creditcardinfo\"/>\n</Formsy.Form>\n```\n\nThe name attribute used here has nothing to do with the input inside. It is just a property on the **CreditCardInfoInput** component that Formsy will use to identify the property name for the value. So you are following the guidelines with this solution.\n\nHope this was an okay explanation, but please let me know if you have more questions :-)\n. Sweet :-)\n. Hi @AlexeyFrolov and thanks for the input!\n\nI do see your point with doing the validation outside of the form and use props to tell which inputs has errors etc., but how would you handle validation done when the input itself is changing? How would you handle indicating required fields? How would you handle pristine state? \n\nWith a simple form that only changes state when it is submitted I totally agree with your argument, but the increase of complexity when validating the form \"as you type\" requires this tight coupling I think. Also looking at normal HTML5 attributes with the pattern-attribute and even just using a type-attribute (email, phonenumber) gives you validation on the form, much like Formsy validations-attribute (http://www.the-art-of-web.com/html/html5-form-validation/).\n\nBut you are very welcome to just use the onSubmit method and do the validation there, passing updated error props to the inputs in your form. But then you probably would be better of just using a normal form I think :-)\n\nPlease correct me if I misunderstood your input!\n. Hi again @AlexeyFrolov,\n\nHow would you feel about something like this:\n\n``` html\n<Formsy.Form onSubmit={this.validate} errors={this.state.errors}>\n  <MyInput name=\"myInputName\" validationError=\"Something wrong here\"/>\n</Formsy.Form>\n```\n\nSo the errors object you pass in will be in the format of: { myInputName: true }. That way you can control all validation from outside the form. Would that make sense?\n\nIf not, please give me an example of how you would expand the API to cover the need discussed here :-)\n. This will soon be released as `validationErrors` property on the form. You can use `onChange` or `onSubmit` to set any errors manually by updating the object on the validationErrors prop.\n. Hi Brett!\n\nThis is a difficult one :-)\n\nFormsy allows for setting any value as the value of the form element, not just strings and booleans as you typically can with traditional form elements. If forcing everything to be a string I believe it will restrict too much, at least for now.\n\nI suppose you created the isInteger validation rule yourself? Or are you referring to the isNumeric default validation rule?\n\nIf you created isInteger yourself I suggest you add a check to the validation rule, or convert it to string as that is what you want for your specific forms. If you are referring to the default isNumeric validation rule I think it should also be \"true\" when validating integers, so I can fix that.\n\nDid I understand you correctly on this? :-)\n. Hehe, thanks for that note ;-)\n\nI will add this as a bug and fix it. Thanks for the report!\n. This should be fixed\n. Hi there!\n\nFormsy.Forms require Formsy elements, you are using a native input. If you wrap those inputs in components:\n\n``` javascript\nvar MyInput = React.createClass({\n  mixins: [Formsy.Mixin],\n  changeValue: function (event) {\n    this.setValue(event.target.value);\n  },\n  render: function () {\n    return <input value={this.getValue()} onChange={this.changeValue}/>\n  }\n});\n\n// In form component\n<Formsy.Form>\n  <MyInpuit name=\"email\"/>\n</Formsy.Form>\n\n```\n\nMaybe I should document this a bit better? The reason it works this way is that creating formsy element components, like `MyInput`, is what gives you all the functionality. It has been suggested to give a default input out of the box, but it is so rarely you actually need just a simple input. You probably always want to wrap some divs, show your validation errors as you see fit etc.\n. Hi Brett,\n\nSorry for late response, this issue got totally lost on me!\n\nThis should be fixed for next version!\n. Should be fixed\n. Looking good, except I was a bit unsure of the timeout thingy to prevent too many onChange events. I changed it around a bit and needed also to do so to make dynamic inputs work. They also trigger a change event, when they occur.\n\nAlso wrote a test for this. It is included in next release :-) thanks for the reference code!\n. Hi @gilbarbara, sorry for the late reply!\n\nAs I understand it you might get away with using an internal state:\n\n``` javascript\nvar MyInput = React.createClass({\n  mixins: [Formsy.Mixin],\n  getInitialState: function () {\n    return {\n      value: this.props.value\n    };\n  },\n  updateValue: function (event) {\n    this.setState({ value: event.target.value });\n  },\n  syncValue: function () {\n    this.setValue(this.state.value);\n  },\n  render: function () {\n    return (\n      <input\n        type={this.props.type}  \n        name={this.props.name} \n        onChange={this.updateValue}\n        onBlur={this.syncValue} \n        value={this.state.value}  \n      />\n    )\n  }\n});\n```\n\nYou think that could work?\n. Hi @gilbarbara,\n\nSo you basically just want freedom to run the validation rule on the current value, without actually triggering validation?\n\n``` javascript\n  render: function () {\n    var isValid = this.testValid();\n  }\n```\n\nSomething like that? The only thing it does is run the current value against the validator.\n. Will see if I can include this in next version :-)\n. This got a bit more complex than first expected, have to wait for next release\n. Okay, this will be part of next release :-)\n. And it has been accepted, awesome stuff, thanks :-)\n. Awesome, thanks :-)\n\nWill include it in next release!\n. And again, thanks! I will pull it in, just verify a couple of things before release, but looks good! :-)\n. That makes sense, thanks Hana :-)\n. Nice :-) I will just move the querySelector line to be run once. Not that we will hit a performance issue... have to blame OCD. Glad you like it!\n. Lets give it a try :-)\n. Yeah, that would be awesome. Starting to work on next release tomorrow:\n\n``` javascript\n<MyInput validationError={{email: 'whatup', foo: 'bar'}}/>\n```\n\nJust makes sense :-) You think so too?\n. Jup, thats what I wrote too? :-)\n. Ah, yeah, hehe, sorry. Will implement this for next version. Thanks for a great input!\n. Is included in next version\n. Ah, sorry, I confused this with a different issue. Will implement very soon :-)\n. Hi!\n\nYeah, it was a usability decision there. Please give me a comment on how it went converting the rules. Maybe we can find a solution here :-)\n. @jhampton You know, the next release has a `validationsError` prop on the form which can be used for external validation tools. Will give an example in next release which is right around the corner :-)\n. Hi @sdemjanenko ,\n\nDo you have an example of when this happened? Its just to keep my head wrapped around the scenarios the form can get into :-)\n. Hi @bryannaegele! This looks great, thanks!\n. btw, I added a validation run when the validations change, so that existing values that receives new validations are validated against those immediately.\n. Checking this out for the next release :-)\n. This should work with version 0.8.0\n. Hi @sdemjanenko , you have lots of ideas, great! :-)\n\nSo what you are suggesting here is the need for having a reusable set of inputs that would namespace their names? So in your example the inputs would be:\n- one.foo and on.bar\n- two.foo and two.bar\n\n?\n\nYou should be able to solve this with just plain React and Formsy though?\n\n``` js\nvar ScopedInput = React.createClass({\n  mixins: [Formsy.Mixin],\n  render: function() {\n    return <div>\n      <MyInput name={this.props.name + 'foo'} value={...} />\n      <MyInput name={this.props.name + 'bar'}  value={...} />\n    </div>;\n  }\n});\n\nvar ConfigureForm = React.createClass({\n  render: function() {\n    return <Formsy.Form ...>\n      <ScopedInput name=\"one\" />\n      <ScopedInput name=\"two\" />\n    </Formsy.Form>\n  }\n});\n```\n\nI think a mixin hides too much implementation details, unless I am misunderstanding something here of course :-)\n. Hi guys,\n\nSorry that I do not quite understand why you need this ;-) You have a couple of more examples?\n\nTo namespace inputs I would suggest as the example above:\n\n``` js\nvar ScopedInput = React.createClass({\n  mixins: [Formsy.Mixin],\n  render: function() {\n    return <div>\n      <MyInput name={this.props.name + 'foo'} value={...} />\n      <MyInput name={this.props.name + 'bar'}  value={...} />\n    </div>;\n  }\n});\n\nvar ConfigureForm = React.createClass({\n  render: function() {\n    return <Formsy.Form ...>\n      <ScopedInput name=\"one\" />\n      <ScopedInput name=\"two\" />\n    </Formsy.Form>\n  }\n});\n```\n\nBut I think there is something I do not quite get here maybe? Would be great with some more code examples :-)\n. Hm hm, do you have some example code @sebas5384? I have a feeling I am misunderstanding? Or does my example above solve the issue? :-)\n. Nested inputs are implemented in last version. name=\"foo.bar\" = {foo: {bar: VALUE}}\n. Hm, okay, I will check this locally first. Thanks for contributing! :-)\n. Okay, I have to solve this a bit differently, but thanks for contributing to the solution!\n. Okido, I will try to provoke this error and create a test for it too, thanks! \n. Ah, of course, thanks for that @snario !\n. Hi @sdemjanenko,\n\nYou should be able to do that using the \"onChange\" property of the form? Or does that not suffice?\n. Yeah, you make a good point here, I will bring it in with the next version :-)\n. hi again @sdemjanenko ,\n\nLooking at this again I just want to discuss a bit more before implementing. I just have to make sure that I do not add something that does not cover the challenge you are having.\n\nSo, the issue here is that you want to grab the initial state of the form. Saying that you are referring to the inputs and their values? The object that you receive on `onChange`?\n\nWould it not be possible to just set that initial state on your wrapping form component?\n\n``` js\nvar FormWrapper = React.createClass({\n  getInitialState: function () {\n    return {\n      values: {\n        foo: 'bar'\n      }\n    };\n  },\n  setValues: function (values) {\n    this.setState({values: values});\n  },\n  render: function () {\n    return (\n      <Formsy.Form onChange={this.setValues}>\n        <MyInput value={this.state.values.foo}/>\n      </Formsy.Form>\n    );\n  }\n});\n```\n\nAnd when the \"onChange\" event is received you use that to set the new values?\n. Looking at the implementation it seems that you want to check if the values of the form has changed? So if a user has changed something back to the pristine value you want it to be \"hasChanged = false\"?\n. @eventhough This is an interesting suggestion! Would you mind creating a new issue on that? I will close this now. I would suspect we have to add a flag-property to the form. Thanks :-)\n. Aha, nice, thanks :-)\n. Yeah, you make a good point here. Though I think we get more flexibility by introducing: `onValidSubmit`and `onInvalidSubmit`. So `onSubmit` always fires. What do you think?\n. Allrighty, this is part of next release :-)\n. Yeah, that would be awesome :-) I was thinking of including \"clean implementations\" of the default form elements. So instead of `<input type=\"text\" name=\"foo\" value=\"bar\"/>` you would say: `<Formsy.Input type=\"text\" name=\"foo\" value=\"bar\"/>` and you would get the exact same thing.\n\nWhat do you think? Not possible to do it with native inputs, at least not with current implementation, and what current implementation details would be lost if going down that path.\n\nIt is an interesting idea for a second version of Formsy though. The lib is not really very \"simplistic\" right now, but it solves the complexity of forms I think, and that was the main focus of the first version :-)\n. Will include this on release after next one :-)\n. @eriklharper Since you mentioned contributing, this would also be an awesome contribution. You seem to have some ideas there too ;-)\n\n@alexduan Yeah, could have a separate project bringing wrapped bootstrap components. That would indeed be very nice :-)\n. hi @afitiskin and thanks for the suggestion!\n\nThough I like the concept of a container, I am a bit uncertain how this would be reusable. I think it would be nice to just:\n\n``` js\n<Formsy.Form>\n    <Formsy.Input/>\n    <Formsy.Textarea/>\n</Formsy.Form>\n```\n\nAnd implement a Formsy version of displaying validation errors etc. ReactSelect would not work of course, but again you would have to implement all the required, validation error display etc., so you would have to build a form element component for ReactSelect regardless.\n\nLet me know if I misunderstood your example!\n. I have been thinking about this some more and though I think it is nice with a default set of elements I do not think Formsy itself should have this. There are just so many ways to handle validation. Its better that other projects provide form elements with custom validation handling in regards of UI.\n\nLike the https://github.com/twisty/formsy-react-components project.\n\nI will update the README to point to that project.\n. Hi @simiographics ,\n\nFormsy does support dynamic inputs. It should be possible in your form wrapper component to have custom logic for your checkboxes. When clicking them you render the different input groups. Formsy should notice this and change its internal model. \n\ndid that make sense? I could give you an example if it seems a bit fuzzy :-)\n. Hi @eriklharper ,\n\nAha, I see. Yeah, onSubmit should trigger when the form itself is programmatically triggered. Will check this out, keeping it open as a BUG. thanks and glad you worked it out :-) \n. Hi @eriklharper,\n\nHave you tried not wrapping in jQuery? This seems to work on my end. Just do:\n\n``` js\nthis.refs.question1.getDOMNode().submit();\n```\n\nUse native behavior. jQuery probably does some crazy wrapping messing things up :-)\n. Hi again @eriklharper ,\n\nHm, yeah. You would have to register a native event listener preventing that behavior. What a pickle this is :-D\n\nYeah, `getCurrentValues()` is actually an internal method, but glad I exposed it now. Let me add this as an enhancement and document it. Glad it worked out for you. Sounds like a very reasonable implementation.\n\nYeah, jQuery registers a listener and wraps \"event.preventDefault\" by default I believe :-)\n. Hi @mull,\n\nCould you explain a bit more what you are trying to achieve? Formsy handles the native form submition and prevents default behaviour. What do you need the form event for?\n. Hi @mull,\n\nThis is probably the wiring of React I believe, since you trigger a native event doing that. But you can do this:\n\n``` js\ntestSubmit() {\n  this.refs.form.submit(); // Point directly to the form component\n},\n\nrender() {\n  return (\n    <Formsy.Form ref=\"form\">\n      {/* some inputs */}\n    </Formsy.Form\n  );\n}\n```\n\nDoes that solve your challenge?\n. Hehe, great ;-)\n. @mull ,\n\nBut things work as you want now? If so, I will close the issue :-)\n. Sweet!\n. Second argument should be a reset function. Does it not set pristine state\nmaybe?\nOn tor. 12. mars 2015 at 20:25 Stephen Demjanenko notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> I have a case where after submitting a form I would like to reset it to\n> the pristine state.\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/issues/46.\n. Yes, you are right! There was an initial uncertainty on \"what is a none value\". But since Formsy ended up allowing any kind of value really this should be given an other look.\n. This is fixed in next version\n. Cool :-)\n. Jup, I agree, this fits well with the new `validationErrors` prop on the form. Will include in next release :-)\n. Hi again,\n\nI started to implement this and realized that though an object would be nice it is difficult to translate some values. Like:\n\nisLength:5:12\n\nAnd most validators are simple strings. Like if you create an app you would rather create your own validators like \"isUser\", \"isProduct\" etc.\n\nBut I fixed the bug :-)\n\nI want to keep the API as simple as possible, so I think it should be strings or object. not both. I hope to get around to build Formsy React 2, which probably will use objects instead. Learned a lot from inputs on this project. Some good decisions and some bad were made ;-)\n. I decided to use: `'value' in this.props` as you really should allow any value. But great contribution and thanks for the tests :-)\n. Thanks for that @sdemjanenko :-)\n. Ops, thanks ;-)\n. Hi @sdemjanenko,\n\nThe implementation looks good, but I just have to understand the scenario where you need it. The API is getting pretty large and I try to be a bit restrictive if it can be solved an other way :-)\n\nLets continue discussion on #40 \n. You know, I am sold on this implementation, will just change the dep to the internal isSame util. Thanks @sdemjanenko , will be part of next release!\n. Will manually bring this in.\n. @sdemjanenko You make an excellent point. I will try to make this part of next release!\n. This is part of next release now\n. Good point, hm... I just want to get this next release out and will look into this when its out. Thanks for the input!\n. Just wanted to let you know that this will be part of release 0.13\n. This is now added! :-)\n. I am having a full review of testing before next release. With Node 0.4 release I have to change the way testing is done. It will be better :-)\n. Fantastic, thanks for contributing! :-)\n. Hi @Semigradsky, thanks for bringing that to my attention. That is a bug, will be fixed with next release, thanks :-)\n. Fixed in next release\n. Hi @Semigradsky ,\n\nThanks for the input, this looks like a good idea!\n. Decided that XHR will be removed in 1.0 release as it is very easy to hook that manually to the form. Formsy is a form lib, not xhr lib. Covered too much initially ;-)\n. Hi @frost555 ,\n\nSorry for late response, I have been suck with the flue.\n\nAs I understand it when an error from the server occurs you want that error message to be ignored when the input is changed? The error should be reset every time `setValue()` is called. Does that not happen?\n. hi again @frost555,\n\nI will check this ASAP\n. Hi @frost555 ,\n\nVery sorry about the delay here. I can confirm the error and will try to make a fix right now. Thanks for reporting!\n. Okay, fixed, there was indeed a bug here. Thanks for reporting @frost555 ! Will be part of next release\n. Hi @mistakster ,\n\nSo sorry for late reply, but I have been sick with the flue, but back on my feet now :-)\n\nWill merge an release new version!\n. At 99% ;-)\n\nReleased new version, hope everything works okay now.\n. Hi @philippotto ,\n\nThanks for the input!\n\nDo you have a code example of how you would like this to work? Just so I am completely sure that I understand what you are asking for :-)\n. Cool, I will check it out :-)\n. Ah, great, thanks for that :-)\n. Hi @jonaswindey ,\n\nSo sorry for the delay here, but I have been sick withe the flue and at the same time moving across the country, bad timing on my part ;-)\n\nI have merged and released a new version supporting 0.13.1. Thanks so much for your patience!\n\nbtw, made sure old version of React still works so will just close this pull request.\n. Hi @philippotto,\n\nI have implemented a `isValidValue` that you can use inside a component to run any value against the set validators for that component. So it runs the exact same code as when the real validation occurs. Let me know if this does not behave as expected :-)\n\nI will work on running the tests with travis as soon as the next release is out :-)\n. Hi again @philippotto ,\n\nAha, I see, sorry about my confusion on this :-)\n\nYou are correct in your assumption about isValidValue. Okay, I think I understand what you want now :-)\n\nYou want Formsy to validate in two different ways. Either by passing global formsy validation rules as props or, as you propose, run a method on the component which has its own validation logic.\n\nThat makes sense :-)\n\nI would suggest just calling it : `validate`. Let me pull this request now and put it next release.\n. This is fixed :-)\n. Hi guys,\n\nYeah. Formsy does take an approach with React that is not best practice. There is a new release coming up now with some more functionality. After that I will start on Formsy 2, which conforms more to best practices, but will probably have a few breaking changes.\n\nThe challenge is that a form needs to create a relationship with its children form elements. Now this is done by iterating the children of the form instance, adding some properties and a mixin on the form elements uses these props to communicate with the form instance.\n\nAn other way to go about this is using pure events, but that changes the syntax and I am unsure if it is doable. It would be something like this:\n\n``` js\nvar Form = React.createClass({\n  mixins: [Formsy.FormMixin],\n  render: function () {\n    return (\n      <Formsy.Form>\n        <MyFormElement name=\"foo\"/>\n      </Formsy.Form>\n    );\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThe mixin finds the FormsyForm element in the component and registers custom event listeners like: \"Formsy.setValue\", which then the children form elements can trigger and will be catched by the parent form. The problem is that React JS does not support custom events, would have to use native events, which reduces the testability with Formsy as tests would have to be run in the browser. I think this might be a good tradeoff though. \n\nLet me create an issue discussing next version of Formsy :-)\n. Linking to issue: #66 \n. @gaeron , thanks for that input! This definitely seems like a valid way to go. I have been using it to solve other scenarios, so I will play around with it a bit :-)\n. Hm,\n\nSeems we have to wait for React 0.14. Tried getting this new parent-child context temporary patch working, https://gist.github.com/jamesknelson/1481521444e1529d59aa#file-react-parent-context-patch-js, but can not get it to work.\n. @jmartin84 Will look into it, might work :-) Thanks!\n. @jmartin84 I checked it out, but it only works with immediate children, need something a bit more flexible. Got the new parent-child context thing running now so I think we will end with that solution .It is also confirmed for next React release, so I think we are in the clear on this challenge :-) Thanks for the suggestion though! \n. @jmartin84 Actually, this is exactly what we can do. I just did not see clearly how to handle nested children, but I do now :-) Will create a fix for this. Will still change to context on React 0.14, @gaearon , as it is more optimized. But now we are in the clear, awesome, thanks!\n. Hi @Semigradsky,\n\nThat is the bundled release. To use formsy in Node environments you require it like a normal NPM module:\n\n``` js\nvar a = require('formsy-react');\n```\n\nHope that answers your quesiton :-)\n. Hi again,\n\nIt is for people using bower or just use a normal script tag and use it globally :-) Or requirejs.\n. Hm, bower.json we still need though? Bower checks what tag to download by looking at that file?\n. Ah, sorry, I am confusing with .gitignore :-)\n\nI will pull it in! Thanks\n. Hi @Semigradsky,\n\nThis is a great contribution, thanks! Version 1.0.0 of Formsy will use webpack also for development, so this is very welcome indeed. \n. @Semigradsky ,\n\nYeah, I agree on that. I will remove it for next version. Thanks for the input!\n. Hi @gpbmike ,\n\nDo you set the initial value to false? \n\n``` js\n<MyCheckBox value={false}/>\n```\n\nIf so it should work. The `'value' in this.props` only checks if the key \"value\" exists in props, not if the value is \"truthy\".\n\nThe reason behind '' is that you can really create any element. If a checkbox has its value by default false, there is no way for Formsy to understand that. You kinda have to tell it by passing a default \"false\" value. What you get back though is lots of flexibility in what kind of form elements you want to build :-) \n\nExample of checkbox:\n\n``` js\nvar MyCheckbox = React.createClass({\n  mixins: [Formsy.Mixin],\n  changeValue: function (event) {\n    this.setValue(!this.getValue());\n  },\n  render: function () {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" checked={this.getValue()} onChange={this.changeValue}/>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n});\n\n<MyCheckBox name=\"foo\" value={false}/>\n```\n. Ah, cool, great :-)\n. Hi @marnusw ,\n\nThanks for taking the time to review the implementation :-)\n\nThe reason I implemented `setInputValidationErrors` is because that one will always go through all inputs and set the valid state based on any errors passed. It basically resets the input if there was an error there, and then there is no error. So it is needed.\n\nThe `updateInputsWithError` does the opposite. It goes through any errors passed and set those errors, as you say.\n\nThat said, you might be right :-) But I believe the first method has to be used, because it makes sure that any inputs that current state is error is reset to valid state when there is no error anymore. Does that make sense?\n\nI agree that `getCurrentValues()` eliminates `updateModel()`. Cleans up the code :-)\n\nWould be great if created a pull request for this, though make sure that passing errors on the form, and then removing them, resets the inputs to valid state.\n. Cool! I will just close this issue. Please comment again if you want to discuss some details on this :)\n. Thanks @paddyinpdx, will fix this on next release :-)\n. This one should work on release 0.12\n. Hi @gilbarbara ,\n\nFound the bug, it will be fixed on next release, thanks for reporting :-)\n. Hi @mloginov ,\n\nFound the bug, will be fixed on next version, thanks for reporting! :-)\n. Hi @arunthampi, yeah, that would be great! Thanks a lot, and thanks @Semigradsky for helping out with support! :+1: \n. Hi @frost555,\n\nThanks for noticing, will fix that!\n. Fixed, will be in next release\n. Hi @Semigradsky, thanks for the pull! I chose to handpick and implement myself, but you will get credit for it, thanks for the pull! ;-)\n. Hi @Semigradsky,\n\nAwesome stuff! Could you create a pull to document the example and how to run it? That would be awesome!\n. @Semigradsky, maybe add it with a pull to explain how to run the examples? As mentioned in #79. Would be really great, thanks for contributing! :-)\n. HI @frost555 ,\n\nYeah, I think you are right, I can not see a scenario where it would be useful. But if it appears, we know what to implement :-)\n. HI @eriklharper ,\n\nI think you have to fix a couple of things first:\n\nevent.target.value, not currentTarget. currentTarget would be the body I think, as that is where the event is captured. target is the element that triggered the event, the input :-)\n\nAnd I also see you referencing `this.state.required`,should be `this.props.required`?\n\nHope this helps!\n. Hi @eriklharper,\n\nGreat you got it working :-)\n\nI would love getting started with the wiki. The repo has a technical description, but the wiki could be a more practical description. Showing how you build different types of form elements and explaining strategies to validations etc.\n\nhttps://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/wiki\n\nFeel free to do whatever you want there, or nothing if its boring ;-)\n. Hi @janmyler ,\n\nSorry for late response. Formsy will still require mixins, but the relationship between the form and the form elements will technically use context. It is more performant than the current solution and the Formsy.Form element and its child form elements can actually live in different \"owners\". Which basically means they can live inside different \"render\" methods and still have a relationship.\n. @pkmiec and @firstdoit , yeah, I totally agree. I have no experience with React Intl (You referring to Yahoo?) or formatjs, but I am very open to suggestions and examples of how to handle this!\n. React 0.14 is now in Beta and I am working on the next release. When 0.14 is released and the new version has been tested, we go for 1.0 release :-) \n\nWhen it comes to translation I do not see why formsy needs a wrapper for this. As you probably have other translations in your project already, so:\n\n``` js\n<MyInput validations=\"isEmail\" validationErrors={{isEmail: translate('invalidEmail') }}/>\n```\n\nIt would work just like translating any other text in your components?\n\nClosing this issue as things are moving along.\n. Hi @bryannaegele,\n\nJust wondered why you closed it? Did it not work out?\n\nI have just been busy working on fixing the props warning stuff for React 0.13.1, so have not had time reviewing the pull. Overall it makes a lot of sense, but have to dive into it a bit more :-)\n. Hi guys,\n\n@adamellsworth, @jmartin84 @darth10 @sdemjanenko @Semigradsky \n\nI have an idea! :-)\n\nI have been thinking a lot about the warnings on props being overriden. There are a few different strategies, but all of them involve \"heavy lifting\". The most effective and least intrusive is just for Formsy to suppress the specific props warnings. Normally I would say that is a bad thing, but since warnings are there to notify changes in the API and Formsy already has the implementation ready for next version AND you can not update to 1.0.0 without specifically telling NPM to do s, I believe this to be the best solution. It will ONLY suppress Formsy props warning, not other prop overrides. It does this by wrapping `console.warn` and checks for those specific messages.\n\nThe will be implemented as:\n\n``` js\nFormsy.suppressWarnings();\n// Log will show: \"Formsy is suppressing its props override until React 0.14. console.warning is wrapped and will not display correct source and line number in console\"\n```\n\nIf I get an ok on this I will release a new version instantly :-)\n\nThanks!\n. I did some more research on this. There is a different method that will avoid this \"hack\". It is actually a method that would work even after React 0.14, though using context will optimize it. Will release it as soon as I can.\n. Ready for release.\n. Ah, missing a test for that one! Will create and thanks for fixing it @gneutzling! Will release new version now.\n. Hi @olimsaidov, \n\nThe change log is the releases. On the \"releases\" tab. I can point it out more in the documentation :-)\n. Hi @frost555 , since version 0.11 Formsy no longer handles Ajax directly. You have to wire it up manually. The reason is that Formsy should focus on being a good form validation tool, not ajax tool :-)\n\nSo by using `onSubmit` or `onValidSubmit` you can do the ajax call there and reset/invalidate the form with the callbacks received as arguments to these methods. That way you can also map whatever response you get from the server.\n\nI have fixed the error you pointed out, thanks for that ;-)\n. I suggest adding this as a default property on the form. Is there any reason you would not want to have \"novalidate\"... I mean, the reason you use formsy is to handle custom validation? :-)\n. Added this now. You can turn it off with: `<Formsy.Form novalidate={false}/> will be part of next release :-) Thanks!\n. Hi @dprentis,\n\nI did something wrong on first implementation. You should be able to use `formNoValidate` on the inputs too... the actual native inputs that is :-)\n. Hi guys, sorry for late reply, been in loss of time.\n\nI have not tested this very well. So what you are saying is that if we change documentation to:\n\n``` js\n<Formsy.Form>\n   <input name=\"foo\" required />\n   <input name=\"submit\" formNoValidate type=\"Submit\" />\n</Formsy.Form>\n```\n\nWe are in the clear on this? formNoValidate does the job, though only on the native form element that runs the submit of the form? It being an input or a button?\n. Jup, I agree, will fix this for next release\n. @e-monson This seems like native behaviour. If you want commas you have to run with your own input where you suppress letters.\n. I absolutely agree. This was changed due to Formsy allowing any kind of form element with any kind of value, but these validations specifically point to \"inputs\", where a \"none-value\" should be valid.\n\nThis is fixed in next version! Thanks :-)\n. Hi @dprentis,\n\nThere seems to be a bug here, working on it now. Thanks for reporting!\n. Okay, fixed it... releasing new version now. Sorry about that, but written test for it too. Will not happen again :-)\n. Thanks for reporting, this is fixed in next release which arrives today :-)\n. Thanks for reporting @adamellsworth !\n\nReleased 0.12.1 now. The implementation was misunderstood. Sorry about that.\n. Hi guys!\n\nI am releasing a new version now where this is fixed :-) let you know!\n. Okay, released 0.12.5, https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/releases/tag/v0.12.5, would be great if you could verify that it works :-)\n. Hi @pkmiec ,\n\nGreat, thanks!\n\nYeah, this is a very specific implementation detail. The `onSubmit` you can register on a Formsy.Form  could get more information than just the value. Could even pass the component itself. So you would:\n\n``` js\nvar MyForm = React.createClass({\n  mySubmit: function (inputs, reset, invalidate) {\n    inputs.foo.getValue();\n    inputs.foo.isPristine();\n    inputs.foo.isValid();\n    inputs.foo.hasExternalError(); // new method\n  },\n  render: function () {\n    return (\n      <Formsy.Form onSubmit={this.submit}>\n        <MyInput name=\"foo\" validations=\"isEmail\"/>\n      </Formsy.Form>\n    );\n  }\n});\n```\n\nDo you think something like that would be valuable?\n. Hi again guys and thanks for the discussion! This is a tough one and its difficult for me to decide on a good solution as I have not really been in this specific situation before. So I will just give some more suggestions on solving it with focus on keeping the API clean and simple :-)\n\n``` js\nonSubmit: function (model, reset, setErrors) {\n  setErrors(serverErrors, false); // Passing false will not invalidate the inputs, only set errors\n}\n```\n\nYou think that would cover the need? The way you can decide by scenario if you want external errors to actually invalidate the inputs, or just give an error? Again, any change to the input would clear the error of that specific input.\n. Hi @pkmiec ,\n\nThanks for the suggestion! I think we are getting somewhere here, though I am not quite sure about delegating it to the mixin. I do see the advantage of overriding, I think it looks quite nice, but the validation of an input is not determined by the mixin, but the form. Because the valid state affects both the form and possibly other inputs.\n\nSo if I understand your suggestion correctly the form would not be able to invalidate on external errors, only a particular input would. \n\nThe way I see it is that we have two very specific behaviours we want to achieve. \"Should external errors invalidate the input and form, or should it not?\". Translating this to an API change that question is most simply answered with a boolean. My initial suggestion was on the callback of invalidating with external errors, but what about a form prop instead?\n\n``` js\n<Formsy.Form preventExternalErrorValidation/>\n```\n\nOr did I miss an important point here? ;-)\n. Okay, adding `preventExternalInvalidation` in new release\n. Hi @pkmiec ,\n\nCould you check again with latest version? There was a bug with the required validation\n. Hmf, git is doing something weird with this code. Fixed with new version and added tests for it. Thanks for reporting!\n. Hi @Semigradsky,\n\nThanks for the fix! Great, I really appreciate the help :-) If you are ever in Trondheim, Norway, I will buy you a beer!\n. Great stuff! Thanks! Would you like to become official contributor @Semigradsky? Any changes to Formsy API have to be discussed of course, but you can go crazy with examples and documentation. And tests... ;-)\n. Cool, done, and thanks again :-)\n. Hi guys,\n\nReleased 0.12.5 which should fix this error. https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/releases/tag/v0.12.5\n. Hi Bryan,\n1. This absolutely makes sense\n2. If I understand you correctly you would get the opposite problem if pre populating with invalid data and expect it to trigger onInvalid? :-) Maybe a better solution is to ensure that the onValid/onInvalid always triggers after initialising?\n\nThanks for contributing with this!\n. Just cleaning up issues. Though you pointed out some good stuff here I will close the issue, as I have not gotten feedback on this by anyone else and I require some more discussions to make a solution. Please keep on commenting to make this part of formsy.\n. Hey @dprentis ,\n\nGot a pull request with lots of validation fixes, including this one. Could you verify that pull? #105 supports what you have considered? I will be releasing that now first. So it would be great with a new pull if you see anything it does not support. Sorry for the inconvenience. \n. @aesopwolf Are you not able to update to React 0.13.x? If so, that would be great, or we have to look more into it with more information.\n. Okay, glad you found a solution.  I say we just close this as people will be moving on to React 0.13 and especially React 0.14 with its new \"parent-child\" context which will help a lot of libraries out there.\n. I think it looks awesome! I have also opened up the WIKI for a more \"practical approach to Formsy\", as the README is very technical, and should be really.\n\nIf you have ideas to adding examples of building for elements and/or validation strategies, please feel free to go crazy :-)\n\nThanks, this is an awesome pull!\n. Hi @erwanjegouzo ,\n\nThis is really great work. Pulling it in! Thanks a bunch!\n. Hi @simiographics ,\n\nCould you paste a bit more code that causes the crash? If you are doing something wrong, something is missing in the documentation ;-)\n. Hi @simiographics,\n\nYou seem to be creating a loop here. Whenever the input changes you clean it again. In what situation do you want the input to be cleared? I suppose you do not want that whenever it changes?\n. Hi again,\n\nThis is very strange. I was not able to reproduce the error on a test I ran locally. I am thinking there is something \"outside\" causing the issue.\n\nCould you paste the complete code that runs on the previous example you gave? Try to narrow it completely down to just rendering the form with the input? I have to reproduce it to figure out what is happening.\n\nWould also be great to know what version of React your are running.\n\nNobody else has reported this kind of error so I would believe it is a weird edge case. Would be great to get to the bottom of it though :-)\n. Thanks so much for helping me out with this! Looking at it right now!\n. Okay, it is definitely a bug here. Tracking it now and will release a new version when it is fixed.\n. Okay, found the bug, fixing it now. It was a value comparison that did not handle objects and arrays.\n. Okay, fixed, creating a new release now. Just have to document a couple of things :)\n. Okay, released version 0.13 with some other fixes too\n. Great, let me know how it goes :-)\n. Hi @simiographics,\n\nIt seems my test did not cover this scenario. Working on it now!\n. Okay, a stupid mistake, strange that the test did not get it. Now tested with your example. Will release later today.\n. Okay, released new version, would be awesome if you could test it again. Thanks for your patience @simiographics !\n. Sweet! Good to hear and thanks!\n. Hi there! Thanks for checking this out and creating a great test case. I\nwill look into this tomorrow morning :-)\nOn Thu 23 Apr 2015 at 17:45 Pavel Nuzhdin notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> +1 it affects me too!\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/issues/107#issuecomment-95629513\n> .\n. Hi there,\n\nWhen testing React and Formsy in Node you need to load up JSDOM. At least currently. This is also required by other libraries so please do something like this in your test setup:\n\n``` js\nvar jsdom = require(\"jsdom\").jsdom;\nglobal.document = jsdom();\nglobal.window = document.defaultView;\nglobal.navigator = global.window.navigator;\n```\n\nI am releasing a new test suite with Formsy today that uses this setup. You can check that out for more inspiration :-)\n. Hi again,\n\nHm, thats weird. The Formsy tests runs fine, though using jasmine-node and jsdom. Let me complete the test setup here as there might be a code change in Formsy since I last run that setup.\n\nIf I get the same error I will fix it or I will check out the repo with tests to dive into as it must be jest related.\n. Okay, I can verify that all Formsy tests runs fine with jasmine-node and jsdom. Looking into jest now\n. @worklez \n\nWhat verison of Node are you running? Seems that Jest does not support 0.12? Trying version 0.10.25, but getting an error there too.\n. Okay,\n\nI figured it out. Not quite sure why this happens. It might be a JSDOM thing. But you can not require the component inside the test, you have to do this:\n\n``` js\njest.autoMockOff();\nvar React = require('react/addons');\nvar TestUtils = React.addons.TestUtils;\nvar LoginPage = require('./../LoginPage.js');\n\ndescribe('LoginPage', function () {\n    it('has submit button disabled', function () {\n        var loginPage = TestUtils.renderIntoDocument(React.createElement(LoginPage));\n    });\n});\n```\n. Great, let me know how it works out! I keep pondering on why this causes an issue, it should not matter where you require. But I definitely think it is an environment thing and not a Formsy thing. Anyways, it is better to require them at the top because you probable have multiple tests using the same component :-)\n. Great! I will close the issue then. Yeah, it is a really weird problem. It would be worth checking out if this works:\n\n``` js\njest.autoMockOff();\nvar React = require('react/addons');\nvar TestUtils = React.addons.TestUtils;\n\ndescribe('LoginPage', function () {\n    it('has submit button disabled', function () {\n        var LoginPage = require('./../LoginPage.js');\n        var loginPage = TestUtils.renderIntoDocument(LoginPage());\n    });\n});\n```\n\nThe error itself is related to how the component is wrapped I think, or lack there of. You have `createElement` and also `createFactory` which needs to be used as wrappers on plain components. JSX syntax does this for you. Maybe the components gets wrapped automatically when required inside the tests?\n. Ah, hm, okay thanks for reporting that back. I am out of theories, at least right now. Let you know if I figure it out ;-)\n. Great input @erwanjegouzo, I think this follows the current API. Will need a couple of tests and some README documentation. If you have time, please fork latest version with jasmine-node tests and create a pull for that too. Or else I will find some time to do it :-)\n. Already did it, no worries :-)\n. Hi @binarykitchen ,\n\nIf that native feature is enough you should definitely use it. But Formsy is a form element builder and validator that takes the concept of form validation a lot further than native functionality. Formsy gives you any type of validation you desire and form handlers that triggers whenever the form elements you build change, becomes valid, invalid. External errors can be injected, cross input validation is not a problem etc.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any more questions to Formsy :-)\n. @binarykitchen using native validation would not conform with the validation possibilities you have with Formsy. So even though it would be one less validation rule packed into Formsy, setting type=\"email\" would not give you the possibility to check if input is pristine, it is required, disable the form when it is invalid etc. Btw, native invalid inputs looks different in all browsers, it is not very nice ;-)\n. You have to wrap all your form elements in a Formsy.Form:\n\n``` js\n<Formsy.Form>\n  <MyInputElement/>\n</Formsy.Form>\n```\n. I can improve that error message to be more explicit :-)\n. This is supported yes, but not when the Form is located in a different component... a different render method\n. @firstdoit ,\n\nYou are perfectly right :-) Looking forward to React 0.14 with parent-child context though, then this will not be an issue anymore!\n\nThanks for the feedback, much appreciated ;-)\n. Hi @binarykitchen ,\n\nYou have to provide a Formsy.Form element too:\n\n``` js\n<Formsy.Form>\n        <MyInput\n          hasFeedback\n          required\n          name  = {@props.passwordName}\n          label = {t(\"Password\")}\n          value = {@state.password}\n        >\n</Formsy.Form>\n```\n. It has to be inside the same component :-)\n\nIn React 0.14 we get parent-child context which will fix this, but currently it is not possible.\n. You are the first person to point it out actually ;-)\n\nWe are using Formsy on a huge project with a lot of forms and have not met that issue. That said, it would be nice to have, and it will when React 0.14 is released.\n. Jup, the important thing is that you find something that works for you :-)\n. Just to make sure there was no misunderstanding here :-) :\n\nThis works:\n\n``` js\nvar MyForm = React.createClass({\n  render: function () {\n    return (\n      <Formsy.Form>\n        <div>\n          <MyInput/>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n             <MyInput/>\n           </div>\n        </div>\n      </Formsy.Form>\n    );\n  }\n});\n```\n\nBut this does not until React 0.14:\n\n``` js\nvar MyFormContent = React.createClass({\n  render: function () {\n    return (\n        <div>\n          <MyInput/>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n             <MyInput/>\n           </div>\n        </div>\n    );\n  }\n});\n\nvar MyForm = React.createClass({\n  render: function () {\n    <Formsy.Form>\n      <MyFormContent/>\n    </Formsy.Form>\n  }\n});\n```\n. React 0.14 is now in BETA and new formsy version is right around the corner. Will release some test info very soon.\n. Great @michaelcontento , thanks for taking the time! :-)\n. @sanemat ,\n\nJust want to make sure things are working for you after the latest release?\n. Good question!\n\nMaybe just remove it. Formsy adds complexity allowing for any kind of form element, not just traditional inputs, so I think that is too generic.\n\nMaybe change it out with the new \"isExisty\" function instead? And call is: \"isExisty\"? :-)\n. @Semigradsky Cool, nice! Will release new version with changes. \n\nBtw, I think it is easier to control releases if changes are pull requests. NPM and bower uses the tags and the current tag does not have isExisty in it, but people can read about it on the repo :-)\n\nNo biggy, but seems like a good way to do it?\n. Lets add a new tag, just have to review pull requests etc. do document a new release. Will do that tomorrow :-)\n. Hi there,\n\nThanks for discussing this. It has been a bit difficult identifying required/validation regarding \"empty values\" as formsy supports any kind of form element, not just traditional inputs.\n\nBut we are getting there :-)\n. Hi @mloginov ,\n\nIdentified problem, working on fix now, will probably be released later today. Thanks for reporting!\n. Okay, released new version, please try again :-)\n. Hi @tomaash and thanks for the pull!\n\nI agree this should be in there, but I have a suggestion for you. Since the goal here is to set some initial values, maybe we should put:\n\n``` js\n<Formsy.Form values={{\n  foo: 'bar',\n  bar: 'foo'\n}}>\n  <MyInput name=\"foo\"/>\n  <MyInput name=\"bar\"/>\n</Formsy.Form>\n```\n\nThat way it is very specific to what you want to achieve, set some initial data. We could of course also merge in your change, as you still might need to reset the values easily :-)\n. Hi @tomaash , so sorry for late reply, but I have been completely in loss of time the last week. I will release a new version tomorrow morning including your fix!\n. Hi @crdeutsch and so sorry for the late reply. I have been deep into a different project and have just been in loss of time.\n\nIt might seem a bit aggressive to do the validation on each key press, though as I understand it you mean that from a user experience perspective, not a technical perspective?\n\nI would suggest that you add your own state to your form element. Something like, `showValidation`. That way you can choose with onBlur or Enter to set that state to true and combine it with the internal methods of Formsy. Like:\n\n``` js\nvar MyInput = React.createClass({\n  mixins: [Formsy.Mixin],\n  getInitialState: function () {\n    return {\n      showValidation: false\n    },\n    onInputChange: function (event) {\n      this.setValue(event.target.value);\n    },\n    onInputBlur: function () {\n      this.setState({\n        showValidation: true\n      });\n    },\n    onInputFocus: function () {\n      this.setState({\n        showValidation: false\n      });\n    },\n    render: function () {\n      return (\n        <div>\n          <input onChange={this.onInputChange} value={this.getValue()}/>\n          <div>{this.showError() && this.state.showValidation ? this.getErrorMessage() : null}</div>\n        </div>\n      );\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nWould that make sense?\n\nI do not think it is a good idea to grab value from DOM node as it breaks with the principles of React. The state of the component defines what is in the UI, not the other way around. I am sure we can find a solution for this :-)\n\nLet me know if I misunderstood any needs and we can keep working towards a solution!\n. Hi again!\n\nHm, I am very certain that the DOM should not be the \"source of truth\". The component state should be the \"source of truth\". I can not quite wrap my head around how you get the inputs to go out of sync with the state of the component.\n\nTo solve this I think we need to set up a small project I can run locally to see the problem in context. I am sure there is a \"component state way\" to solve this :-)\n\nI will close this for now since you solved it with a fork and I have not gotten feedback on this from anyone else, but please keep commenting if you want this put into Formsy. Thanks for contributing with the feedback and examples :-)\n. Great! :+1: \n. Hi guys and thanks for the discussion!\n\nWhen React 0.14 is out, with the new context handling I think we could do something like this\n\n``` js\nvar AddressForm = React.createClass({\n[...]\nrender: function(){\n    return (\n        <Formsy.Form {...this.props}>\n             <input name=\"street\"/>\n             <input name=\"zip\"/>\n             <input name=\"city\"/>\n        </Formsy.Form>\n    ); \n}\n});\n\n <Formsy.Form>\n   <input name=\"name\"/>\n   <input name=\"otherProperty\"/>\n   <AddressForm name=\"address\" extended/>\n</Formsy.Form>\n```\n\nSo the idea here is that the extended prop would be passed into the sub Formsy.Form, causing Formsy to return a plain DIV instead of a FORM. That way you could easily include forms in forms. But we depend on the context change to make the sub elements work I believe. I will do some tests tomorrow to verify if current context implementation can make things a bit easier for us.\n\nBut would this useful?\n. Cool, let me put this in on release today. Getting to work now :-)\n. Hi guys,\n\nAre you referring to using other string values? Have now implemented:\n\n``` js\n<input name=\"address.street\"/> => {address: { street: 'value' } }\n```\n\nCan not see any reason to support anything else?\n. This is the code btw:\n\n``` js\nreturn Object.keys(this.model).reduce(function (mappedModel, key) {\n\n  var keyArray = key.split('.');\n  while (keyArray.length) {\n    var currentKey = keyArray.shift();\n    mappedModel[currentKey] = keyArray.length ? mappedModel[currentKey] || {} : this.model[key];\n  }\n\n  return mappedModel;\n\n}.bind(this), {});\n```\n. Just closing it for now as any more complex implementation has to be next version. Want to get new version out today :-)\n. But how could it be an array? `<MyInput name=\"\"/>` is always a string?\n. Sorry, but I do not understand how the name of an input could lead to that structure? As I understand this you want:\n\n``` js\n<Formsy.Form>\n  <MyInput name=\"foo\"/>\n  <MyInput name=\"address.street\"/>\n  <MyInput name=\"address.postCode\"/>\n</Formsy.Form>\n```\n\nWhich leads to this structure:\n\n``` js\n{\n  foo: 'value',\n  address: {\n    street: 'value',\n    postCode: 'value'\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHow would you structure the inputs to give a structure that would require arrays? Sorry for my misunderstanding... but its Friday after all ;-)\n. Please describe \"list support\". I do not understand what a \"list\" is in regards of naming an input? Would be great with an example of html syntax and how that translates to:\n\n``` js\n{nav_items: [{a:b, c:d}, {a:f, c:g}]}\n```\n\nWhat does this form look like?\n. Hi guys,\n\nsorry for late reply. I think it makes sense to conform the name syntax to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` type of data, which is like you describe @chrbala.\n\nTried finding a good lib for this, but there does not seem to exist any? But we can sure build it. So does everybody feel comfortable with:\n\n``` js\n< MyInput name=\"addresses[0][street]\" value=\"Some Street\"/>\n< MyInput name=\"addresses[1][street]\" value=\"Different Street\"/>\n\n{\n    addresses:\n        [{\"street\": \"123 Some Street\"}, \n        {\"street\": \"456 Different Street\"}]\n}\n```\n. Yes, sorry, of course. Copy/paste error :-)\n. me too,heh\n. Okay, this is now implemented, using the separate project: https://github.com/christianalfoni/form-data-to-object. Using it as a hard dependency as it is unlikely you need it for something else... will be part of next release\n. Hi guys!\n\nI was hoping React 0.14 would be right around the corner with its parent-child context. That should solve the issue without any changes.\n\nIt should be possible to fix it with a mixin too. let me try out an implementation so that it will be easy to switch when React 0.14 gets here\n. Hi guys,\n\nI will check out the suggestion as soon as I can and if it does not break anything I will bring it into next release :-) Thanks for taking the time @nathanwelch!\n. React 0.14 is in BETA now, and right around the corner. Implemented with context now, and other fixes. This will be the next release as soon as React 0.14 is released. Sorry for the wait, but this is the best solution (I would say).\n. I suppose this is solved?\n. Thanks for including Formsy, great comparison project btw :-)\n. Totally agree, will fix this for next release tomorrow.\n. Great, thanks :+1: \n. Hi @jcapogna,\n\nThat is an excellent question :-)\n\nI have not tried this, though I believe there are some events you can use? I think onChange will trigger on a normal FileInput\n\n``` js\nvar MyFileInput = React.createClass({\n  onInputChange: function (event) {\n    // Verify that file is correct via the event\n    this.setValue(true);\n    // Or if not valid\n    this.setValue(false);\n  },\n  render: function () {\n    return <input type=\"file\" onChange={this.onInputChange}/>\n  }\n});\n```\n\nAnd then just validate with:\n\n``` js\n<MyFileInput validations=\"isTrue\"/>\n```\n\nYou think that would work?\n. Hi again @jcapogna. I believe you should be able to just store the \"files\" property from the input, instead of its \"value\" property. Check out this article:\n\nhttp://blog.teamtreehouse.com/uploading-files-ajax\n. Closing this, hopefully it worked out :-)\n. Okay, cool, good luck! :-)\n. Hi guys, version will be bumped tomorrow morning :-)\n. This is not taken into account, but should. Might get into tomorrows release or most certainly the next after that :-)\n. Okay, this is now fixed for next release. Both validations and required can be changed at runtime and instantly a new validation check will be run. Thanks for the tip!\n. Hi @alexjg,\n\nJup, from the API documentation:\n\n``` js\n<MyInputComponent \n  name=\"email\" \n  validations={{\n    isEmail: true,\n    maxLength: 50\n  }} \n  validationErrors={{\n    isEmail: 'You have to type valid email',\n    maxLength: 'You can not type in more than 50 characters'\n  }}\n/>\n```\n\nThat solved it?\n. Ah, sorry @alexjg , now I understand.\n\nYes, this should absolutely be in there. It would be great if you created a pull. I am releasing a new version today, but this would indeed be welcomed in the next release!\n. Okay, this is now in for next release. Thanks for contributing!\n. Ah, I know whats wrong. Its the passing of props to to the form element. It seems that a native form also has an onChange. Will revert back to strict control of props passed. Will release fix now :-)\n. Try now\n. Hi guys,\n\nYes, this is indeed something nice to have, though I am unsure that this job is for Formsy. I would expect this scenario has a model with the state of some entity on the server, like a person. The model is presented in a formsy form. Deciding what to pass to the server I think is the responsibility of the model layer, not the UI layer. So you would rather pass the whole form to the model-layer, figure out what is actually necessary to pass to the server and then do that. If Formsy is in control of this you will most likely meet scenarios where Formsy has some logic deciding what to pass to the server, and the model layer might have some of the other logic, maybe Formsy does not do a good enough job and we have to build upon the API to solve lots of different scenarios.\n\nSo yeah, I am concerned about introducing it in Formsy, as this is closer to the model layer than the UI layer I think. It basically drills down to comparing two objects and extracting the diff, which some other lib probably already does  very effectively.\n\nBut please, if you disagree we can discuss it more :-) Just my initial thoughts!\n. Yeah, though it depends on how you implement it. Either Formsy needs to keep track on \"changed values\" or it does a \"diffing\" of initial form values and current values when submitting.\n\nThe last part if the simplest and most effective implementation I would suggest... that said, it is very easy to make yourself. Often libraries like Backbone Model or Angular Resource allows you to do this very easily.\n\nSorry, but I think it is the correct choice to have this logic closer to where you communicate with the server, not inside Formsy. But please, if a lot of people disagree I will of course reconsider.\n. Let me keep this open and we will revisit after next release\n. Hi @davidtinker and thanks for looking into this :-)\n\nI think the best solution is to make the function referenced, instead of creating it each time (inside formsy source code). That way the diff check will not see them as different values and you do not have to do anything about it :-)\n\nI have changed this now, so it should be okay. Let me know if you see something I do not see!\n. Hi guys,\n\nHm, do you have a small code example? Currently the mixin for elements checks if the value of the element has changed, and if so, it will run \"setValue\"... also running the validation. I am a bit unsure where this list state is being used?\n\nChanging \"validations\" prop and \"required\" prop will correctly run a new validation in next release btw.\n. Closing old issue\n. Cool! Will create a new release as soon as I have gotten through all the latest issues :-)\n. Yup, would suggest setting the value on the blur event, instead of the change event. \n\n``` js\nvar Comp = React.createClass({\n  mixins: [Formsy.Mixin],\n  onInputBlur: function (event) {\n    this.setValue(event.target.value);\n  },\n  render: function () {\n    return <input onBlur={this.onInputBlur}/>\n  }\n});\n```\n\nClosing this as it seems to be solved?\n. Got this example from someone too: https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/wiki/validate-on-blur\n\nWhen next release is out we should start the work on some \"default elements\", where this validate on blur input could be one of them :-)\n. Hi @endragor ,\n\nThere are two ways to fix this. Either you make pure versions of DateInput and TimeInput, which is not Formsy related. Then you create a small wrapper for DateInput and TimeInput, which uses the mixin. That leaves you open to create a DateTimeInput, using the pure DateInput and TimeInput and exposing its name: \"dateAndTime\" or whatever which holds both values, date and time... does that make sense?\n\nIn the next version of Formsy the `traverseChildrenAndRegisterInputs` will not be used. It will use context instead, which means that this should probably work.\n\nKeep an eye out for the preview and we can try it out :-)\n. Closing old issue\n. Hi guys!\n\nHm, that kinda sucks. The really good thing about React is that the UI is a reflection of the state in the components, not the other way around. It is also an issue that we do want to know exactly when the inputs are filled, as it should trigger validation...\n\nAnd this seems to be a browser issue, as autofill should trigger a change event. If it does not trigger any event it is impossible for Formsy to run its validations, even though we could grab values from inputs on submit. \n\nhm hm, what a pickle... have to think about this, though it might be better to push the browser vendors to implement this correctly.\n. Well, we could add a property to the form which will check the inputs. Something like `<Formsy.Form autorefill></Formsy.Form>`, which would trigger this manual check of the inputs.\n\nThe problem is that formsy elements are not only typical form inputs, they can be anything really. So a better approach might be to add a method to the mixin: `componentDidMount() { this.checkAutoRefill(this.refs.input) }`. Which of course unregisters on unmount.\n\nWhat do you think?\n. I do, thanks for putting focus on this though :-)\n. Hi there,\n\nThe next version should allow you to do this as it uses context instead of props. I will soon give some information on how to try out the new version which requires React 0.14. Stay tuned :-)\n. Check out this issue: https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/issues/158 :-)\n. Hi there!\n\nYou can solve this by manually submitting the form :-)\n\nQuick example:\n\n``` js\nonSubmit: function (model) {\n  if (this.state.typeOfSubmit === 'oneOfThem') {\n    // doe something\n  }\n},\nsubmit1: function () {\n  this.setState({\n    typeOfSubmit: 'oneOfThem'\n  }, this.refs.form.submit);\n},\nsubmit2: function () {\n  this.setState({\n    typeOfSubmit: 'theOther'\n  }, this.refs.form.submit);\n},\nrender: function () {\n  return (\n    <Formsy.Form onSubmit={this.onSubmit} ref=\"form\">\n      <button onClick={this.submit1}>Submit1</button>\n      <button onClick={this.submit2}>Submit2</button>\n    </Formsy.Form>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nWould that work for you?\n. @aphillipo Yeah, I see your point on it being automatic :-) But I think the stability of Formsy is due to all these \"special scenarios\" not being implemented, rather have good enough hooks to solve anything. There are so many suggestions and if all of them were implemented it would be very hard to document it all and keeping it stable :-)\n\nThanks for the feedback!\n. Hi there!\n\nThis seems strange. Could you try to just put your error out in a separate element? Just to make sure that it is not material-ui making any problems? Also try with a different validation rule. \n. Closing old issue\n. Hi guys!\n\nThis is a very typical question, \"why required?\". The thing is that indicating if something is required is different than indicating validation. For example an empty input that validates as email is not invalid because it it empty, but it is invalid if it also is required :-) Confusing, yes, but let me try this:\n\nRequired defines what a missing value is, (no text, is false, is undefined etc.) and invalidates the input as \"missing value\" when that occurs.\n\nValidations defines what values are valid, WHEN there is value in the input.  \n\nIt is really difficult to express this in a good way :-)\n. Adding a \"validateOnSubmit\" prop to the form is a good idea. My personal opinion is that users hate filling out a complete form and submit just to get an error in their face and figure out where it happened. Its better to notify at once... or on blur. But yeah, have to get new version out first, but lets keep this open :)\n. @idream3 Its because a formsy element can be any kind of input. Lets say you have an element that is a list and you want it to be required, which is when the length of the value is 0 :-) You need `required=\"hasLength\"` or something. Does that make sense?\n\nBut this feature is at the top of the priority list now, so it will be implemented very soon.\n\n@silvenon Great tip on the debounce thingy, never thought of that :-) \n. Hi guys!\n\nI got a really interesting suggestion on a different issue. You should easily be able to achieve \"validate on submit\" by just adding a class to the form. This class hides all validation messages. When you hit submit, you remove the class and any validation errors is now displayed.\n\nDoes this solve the issue?\n. Awesome, thanks @Semigradsky . Really struggling with getting time to work on formsy, but got vacation now and will create a new release that supports React 0.14. So will work using the BETA, fix the nesting stuff of components and go through all issues to fix bugs.\n\nI think you are doing a great job replying and working on the project. Would you like to get more involved? Actually, I am proposing that you take the lead of the project. I will of course still be involved, but I think the project would be better of having you as lead on the project :-)\n\nI completely understand if you do not have time, but though I could suggest it\n. That is great! :-) Let me just wrap up the next React 0.14 version and clean things up for you in the issues etc. Then I will announce with the next release. Again, I am still around, so please do not hesitate to contact me to discuss things etc., but feel completely free to do whatever you want. I have faith in you ;-)\n. Hi @ericdfields and thanks for looking into this! In the next version Formsy stops messing around with the children and will use \"react context\" instead. That will fix the issue :-)\n. Hi there,\n\nFormsy is built for flexibility. There are so many different ways of handling a form and to support most of them Formsy has a lot of hooks. Initially Formsy did support posting data directly to the server and handle any errors, but the implementation was too specific. There were so many requests on support of headers, map errors from server etc. It just got way out of control. So instead of having one very opinionated implementation of talking to the server, it has an extremely flexible hook that lets you do it exactly as you want to.\n\nSo I am sorry to say that this will not be implemented... and I can not really see that this is a problem?:\n\n``` js\nsendData(form, reset, invalidate) {\n  myAjaxLib.post('/form', form)\n    .success(this.doWhatever)\n    .error(invalidate);\n},\nrender() {\n  return <Formsy.Form onSubmit={this.sendData}/>\n}\n```\n\nSorry to be such a dick about it ;-)\n. Hi @garbin , great! Thanks. Working on a new version of formsy now, going through all open issues and adding support for React 0.14, adding support for the new parent-child context relationship\n. Hi!\n\nYeah, @rblakeley, please set up a new issue on that. Currently it just builds objects by splitting on `.`. It was implemented like this based on a discussion, but lets review it :-)\n. Hi guys,\n\nYes, the fix is not part of the current release, but the next one. It is right around the corner :-)\n. Hi, yeah, I agree... lets make this part of next release. \n. Okay, got Mixin, HOC and Decorator in the new branch now. Using a traditional approach from other projects.\n. Hi guys!\n\n@twisty thanks so much for taking the time to test! \n\n@Semigradsky Great work, we are closing in on release :-)\n\n**NOTE!** to get the latest version of master in the TEST-project, run `npm install --force`\n. @Semigradsky Maybe create a couple of tests for these errors messages, I was not in the mood for it when I implemented... you know how it is ;-)\n. @richardaday , jup it does :-)\n. Hi there!\n\nAs soon as React 0.14 is released it will be released :-) The code is ready, working with React 0.14 Beta 1\n. Decorators will be part of next release :-)\n. Hm, I did not quite understand what you mean @eriknyk? \n. New version out\n. Will close this as it is fixed in new version coming soon, thanks for the feedback @ajaykurien :-)\n. Release Candidate out now on React, right around the corner :-) Took a bit longer than I thought, but now it is really close!\n. It seems that this is solved? Closing it, thanks for suggestions and hope you got it fixed @sloria!\n. Hi there,\n\nThe `required` prop can take a validation value, just like `validations`. This is to define what validation rule should define the input as required. By default that is `required`, `required={true}` and `required=\"isDefaultRequiredValue\"`. They are the same and checks if the value is undefined or an empty string. But you can change this to f.ex. `required=\"isFalse\"`. If the value now becomes `false` it will be indicated as required. Good for a checkbox the is required to be checked.\n\nDoes that make sense? validations and required is hard to express in a good way :-/\n. Closing this as it does work, reopen if still having problems\n. Hi guys,\n\nThere has been a bit confusion on how required is being used and it will be cleaned up after next release of Formsy.\n\nThe prop `validations` uses validation rules to set errors. The prop `required` can also use validation rules to indicate when an input should be required.\n\nSo:\n\n``` js\n// When the value of the input is `false`, showRequired() will give true\n<MyInput name=\"some_field\" type=\"text\" required=\"isFalse\">\n\n// When the value of the input is falsy (empty string etc), showRequired() will give true\n<MyInput name=\"some_field\" type=\"text\" required>\n\n// showRequired() will always be false \n<MyInput name=\"some_field\" type=\"text\">\n```\n\nSo what we need to clean up here is maybe use a new property. Just throwing it out there:\n\n``` js\n<MyInput name=\"some_field\" type=\"text\" required={true/false} requiredRule=\"isFalse\">\n```\n\nBut yeah, I hope this explained how it works now.\n. Hi @eventhough, yeah, I think you might be right about this. Just to summarize with my own words here.\n\n<MyInput value={someValue}/>\n\nWhenever \"someValue\" changes that should become the new pristine value of \"MyInput\". Whenever \"MyInput\" uses \"setValue\" that will of course not become the new pristine value.\n\nWould love some comments on this, @Semigradsky, @idream3?\n. Hm, I have been thinking a bit more on this. Like a plain input you might want to pass the changes through your application state store. Typically `onChange` on an input and `value={this.state.value}`. With Formsy, in combination with f.ex. Cerebral:\n\n``` js\n@Cerebral({\n  form: ['form']\n})\nclass MyForm extends React.Component {\n  onFormChange(data) {\n    this.props.signals.formChanged({form: data});\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <Formsy.Form onChange={(data) => this.onFormChange(data)}>\n        <MyInput name=\"foo\" value={this.props.form.foo}/>\n      </Formsy.Form>\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis is a typical setup for creating \"application state\". The problem with implementing what is suggested here is that the value prop will change on every change of the form. So it will always be a pristine value.\n\nThis is the difficult balance of internal/external state handling. I think it is important to let developers control the form from some external state store, without messing up the pristine stuff. Maybe we should rather have a `pristineValue` or `defaultValue`? That way you can control it however you like?\n. Will add `defaultValue` in next release, it just gives a lot more control. Let me know if this is a problem\n. You actually have access to all the elements of the form through the formsy.form component. You could go through those instead of wrapping. So:\n\n``` js\nvar MyForm = React.createClass({\n  mixins: [Formsy.Mixin],\n  showErrors: function () {\n    this.refs.form.inputs // All components registered to form. Check their state prop etc.\n  },\n  render: function () {\n    <Formsy.Form ref=\"form\" onInvalidSubmit={this.showErrors}/>\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThough it would be good to get this info directly. So maybe \"onInvalidSubmit\" and \"onInvalid\" hooks should pass an object with elements and their error messages. What do you think?\n. Will make part of next release :-)\n. @Semigradsky I was thinking about adding a \"ELEMENT EXAMPLES\" next to \"HOW TO USE\". Just lots of different examples of how to write different kinds of elements. You up for starting on that? :-)\n. Hm, could you give a code example that breaks? Just have to understand exactly where the problem is :-)\n. Old issue\n. Hi there!\n\nThanks for the heads up! What is the exact syntax where you get this error? \n. Formsy is just a normal element, `<Formsy.Form/>`, Higher Order Components and Decorator version of the elements you build for the form will arrive in next version :-)\n. I believe this is the same as #147 ?\n\nIt depends on the user experience here. Normally you would not allow a submit when any of the elements are invalid. So in the component with your Formsy form you use `onValid` and `onInvalid` to track when the submit button actually can be pressed.\n\nBut the issue mentioned here is about allowing validations to run only when submitting, not as you change the value of the inputs. Would that work for you?\n. Hi, thanks for a great example!\n\nAnd yeah, this can be solved by just having an error class on the form and toggle it when actually hitting the \"submit\" button. So the validation is happening \"under the hood\", but the class decides to display them or not.\n\nSo yeah, will not implement new logic for this as it can be solved with current hooks!\n. It will be 0.14.x on next release, but thanks for the heads up :-)\n. Eyh, nice, thanks :-)\n. Sorry for very late reply, but this is great, thanks! :-)\n. Hehe, I think this is right. You state what rule it needs to match to indicate that it is required. And that is when it is \"isFalse\", when checkbox is unchecked... but \"required to be checked\" is the opposite, so yeah, correct :-) Ah, validation is hard! :-D\n. You can do async validation if you run your own validation. If you use the following hooks, as an example:\n\n``` js\nvar validate = function (values, reset, invalidate) {\n // Check the values of the form and do your async validation, then\n// run the invalidate function to invalidate the form\n};\n\n<Formsy.Form onSubmit={validate}>\n// Your elements\n</Formsy.Form>\n```\n\nI am very unsure how Formsy would handle this internally, as those validations run as values change. Not good user experience. I suppose you want to run it on submit? So yeah, I would solve it with the code above :-)\n\nLet us know if that does not work for you, but it would be nice with a use case to assist you better\n. This still has to be done using existing hooks. Async validation is way too complex for Formsy to handle internally I believe. There are just so many ways to handle it, so it is better to have some hooks that manages it exactly like you want. Added example here to wiki. \n\nLet me know if there are specific scenarios and we can take a look at them?\n. ah, can not see any problem with having this in there, thanks!\n. Hi there @jaraquistain,\n\nAre you passing `null` as the value to the input? You have some snippets, just to make sure I understand this correctly\n. Hi @rodryquintero, in what way is it jerky? :-) I think it would be better to fix that as it is more \"future proof\" in regards of accessing child components in React.\n. Hi again,\n\nHm, what did you put inside the onChange handler? diffing two shallow objects should not cause jerkyness. I have this feeling there is something special happening inside the `onChange` handler in this specific scenario. Calling a function vs accessing an object should not have any noticeable performance issues\n. Ah, yes, its important to give key values so that React can identify them \"as the same component\". Please elaborate if you think I misunderstand something, but yeah, my interpretation is that this is a React issue :)\n. Eyh, this is really great!\n\nThere are so many different ways to handle stuff so Formsy tries to give all the hooks needed to do whatever you want. That said, sometimes it can be very verbose.\n\nI will add this code example to the WIKI first. It might be better to have this stuff as addon components rather than properties/options inside Formsy. So lets keep this and figure out where it fits best.\n. Closing this, please reopen if still a problem\n. Hi guys!\n\nYes, this is something that has been requested before too. \n\nAdding it to list for next release: https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/issues/206\n. Makes sense, let me add it to next release, https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/issues/206\n. Hi @wwsun Yes, it is because you validate asynchronously, which does not work. It will not be part of the API as it is a very complex operation that devs want to handle very differently. You have to move this logic outside the form.\n\n``` js\nvar nameBeingValidated = null;\nvar onSubmit = function (data, reset, invalidate) {\n  if (data.name && nameBeingValidated !== data.name) {\n    // Validate name on server\n    // If not valid\n   invalidate({name: 'That name is not valid');\n  }\n};\n<Formsy.Form onSubmit={onSubmit}>\n  <MyInput name=\"name\">\n</Formsy.Form>\n```\n\nSimple example, I hope it makes sense\n. Hi guys,\n\nSo sorry for my wrong example. Yes, you would do this on the submit.\n. Let me know if is needed to discuss this more!\n. Thanks for this, fixed now :-)\n. I believe you are calling the method incorrectly. Using `class` syntax? Make sure you bind the method to the component :-)\n\n``` js\n  <div onClick={this.changeValue.bind(this)}/>\n```\n. @EthanML , you can access it by using \"ref\" on the form elements and dive into the component, but that is not really the way to go :-)\n\nIf you give some more context to the challenge I am sure we can figure out a good way to handle this!\n. Added to list: https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/issues/206\n. When next version is released I will start working on `formsy-addons` which will have different types of form elements that handles complex validation and I think this fits in! Sounds okay?\n\nSomething like:\n\n``` js\nimport FormsyComponent from 'formsy-react-addons/Component';\n```\n. Awesome stuff, thanks! Hopefully we are right around the corner for React 0.14 and can officially release :-)\n. You know how that works? Trying to find some documentation. Thought I could just checkout the branch and publish it with `--tag beta`?\n. Hm, for some reason it states that I can not publish over the previous version. Maybe I still have to give it a new version number, but using --tag beta it will not be installed by default?\n. ah, yes, there we go:\n\n`npm install formsy-react@beta` :-)\n. Would be great if you could confirm that everything works as expected, and especially if not :-)\n. No worries, thanks for following it up :-)\n. let me update and release new package\n. Okay, try now :)\n. Hi @blittle,\n\nThanks for this. Yes, I am going through the tests for next release. New version of node etc. have to fix it :-)\n. Hm, yes, this is interesting. The state should be reset with the `this.updateModel();`, but have to test it more closely. I see you removed it on a commit to your fork? Any reason for that? I can not see how that could fix the issue... did it? :-)\n\nLet me know and I will put this on the block\n. Aha, I see you fixed it :-) This makes sense, thanks!\n. Maybe add link to README? :-)\n\nJust closing this...\n. Just bring in everything. Tests has to be cleaned. New version of Node etc.\n. Everything except validate on submit is now part of it. Validate on submit can still be used by having a className on the form that you flip on when submitting the first time. By default validations are just hidden\n. Hi guys,\n\nI am bringing branch React 0.14 into master this weekend and releasing new version. There are so many people using new version of React RC so I do not see any reason to wait.\n\nAll fixes will be included in this new release. \n. If I understand you correctly you can add a validation rule here:\n\nhttps://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/API.md#formsyaddvalidationrule\n\nIf you create a function that takes a value and validates it you could call that function from Formsy `addValidationRule` and reuse the same function on the server. Does that make sense?\n. There will be a `defaultValue` prop in next version. It is related to how pristine values are handled, though conceptually I think it will help with your scenario too :-)\n. `defaultValue` not in yet, preparing it for next version :-)\n. Ah, thanks, and thanks for your feedback :-)\n. Great, thanks! :-)\n. 0.16 out now :-)\n. Perfect, thanks :-)\n. Great stuff, thanks a lot :-)\n. Great it worked out @salayev .\n\nWhen next version of Formsy is released it will have a review as there has been many changes since its release. The though it to build a suggested spec for 1.0 version where APIs and how the internal state of the component will be perfected.\n. Hi @salayev ,\n\nValidation vs required is a surprisingly difficult concept. `validations` is related to `showError()` and `getErrorMessages()`. `required` is related to `showRequired()`. So you never check errors related to required. The reason is that they are two different things. You want to indicate a required input differently than when a validation is wrong :-)\n- validations prop => showError() / getErrorMessages()\n- required prop => showRequired()\n. I think you have to give us some more details than that :-)\n. Jup, agreed, https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/issues/206\n. Great, thanks!\n\nNew version will be released this weekend, with latest version of React 0.14\n. Thanks for the heads up! https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/issues/206\n. Great thanks! :-)\n. Ah, must have been a merge issue here, sorry about that!\n. Hi @cmwelsh and thanks for you feedback :-)\n\nWhen it comes to usability I would recommend validating on blur, not on submit as that will feel a bit annoying I think. That said, if the user would insert an email and hit submit, that would cause the input to blur and you would get the same effect. But there is one problem and that is the submit button. It will be disabled if an input is invalid after a submit and you would not be able to resubmit until the input was manually blurred. But I have a suggestion that will require me to implement a fix.\n\nDoes this seem like an okay solution?:\n\n``` javascript\nvar MyInput = React.createClass({\n  mixins: [Formsy.Mixin],\n  changeValue: function (event) {\n    this.setValue(event.currentTarget.value);\n  },\n  render: function () {\n    var color = 'gray';\n    if (this.showError()) {\n      color = 'red';\n    }\n    var border = {\n      border: '1px solid ' + color\n    };\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <input style={border} onBlur={this.changeValue}/>\n        <span>{this.getErrorMessage()}</span> \n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n});\n\nvar MyTestComp = React.createClass({\n  render: function () {\n    return (\n      <Formsy.Form url=\"http://localhost:3000/postform\" hideSubmit>\n        <MyInput name=\"email\" validations=\"isEmail\" validationError=\"This is not an email\"/>\n        <button type=\"submit\">submit</button>\n      </Formsy.Form>\n    );\n  }\n});\n```\n\nAs you can see I hide the \"native\" submit button and roll my own. You also see the input setting its value on blur instead of change.\n\nIf this solution is acceptable I will make the change to let developers use their own submit button. The onBlur part already works :-)\n\nWhen it comes to your second suggestion, I am a bit unsure what you mean. Maybe you could clarify with a specific example?\n\nThanks again for the feedback and glad this helped you out! :-)\n. Hi @mschipperheyn!\n\nI am working on an idea to exclude the buttons from the Formsy.Form itself and let you as a developer decide where they should be an how they should behave. Need to figure a couple of things out first though. I will let you know :-)\n\nI totally agree with your statement.\n\nI will let you know when I have worked out the idea and ask for your feedback before implementing :-)\n. Hi again @mschipperheyn , this is what I suggest:\n\nSince the lib is pretty new I would like to do an API change. First remove anything related to default buttons:\n\n``` javascript\nFormsy.defaults({\n  contentType: 'urlencoded', // default: 'json'\n  hideSubmit: true, // REMOVE IT\n  submitButtonClass: 'btn btn-success', // REMOVE IT\n  cancelButtonClass: 'btn btn-default', // REMOVE IT\n  buttonWrapperClass: 'my-wrapper' // REMOVE IT\n});\n```\n\nInstead add two new handlers for the form:\n\n``` javascript\n<Formsy.Form onInvalid={this.disableButtons} onValid={this.enableButtons}></Formsy.Form>\n```\n\nThat way you get a lot more flexibility. Yes, you would have to code that default behavior yourself, but the API is simpler and more flexible.\n\nWhat do you think?\n. Got those handlers in place :-)\n. Hehe, no worries @srconklin :-)\n\nIf you have time to summarize where the mistakes were made, I could update the readme and make some things more clear. To prevent others meeting those same challenges. \n\nIf you have time and see any value in it of course :-)\n. Hi again @mschipperheyn!\n\nThis is a great feature. I will add this with the handling of submit button. I suggest adding a \"headers\" object in the Formsy defaults config and of course as an attribute on the Formsy.Form components.\n\nThat seems okay?\n. Hi @mschipperheyn , got new version out with headers option. I chose not to go further than just the header object for now. Let me know if you get into a situation where more is needed :-)\n. @mschipperheyn No worries, thanks for checking out the lib :-)\n. Fantastic Laust, your are now the top contributor ;-)\n. AwesomeI Will just change \"isWordsSpecial\" to \"isSpecialWords\". Reads more human like ;-)\n. Hi @ztsmith , sorry about that and thanks for pointing it out. The 0.4.1 tag is now pushed to the repo :-)\n. Great! Thanks for the help :-)\n. Thanks for the pull request!\n. Hi @FoxxMD , this is a very good point!\n\nWe could add a new method to the form elements, something like: \"isPristine()\"? So you could check:\n\n``` javascript\nif (this.isRequired() && this.isPristine()) {\n  // Show required\n}\n```\n\nCould that work?\n. Hi again,\n\n**What triggers the change?**\nGood point! :-) Conceptually you want to tell the parent form when the input is \"touched\", whatever that might be. By default that would be when the input changes its value, which lets us hook up \"isPrestine\" to the \"setValue\" method. But as you say, you might do it when blurring. To keep things simple I would suggest that you would have to run \"this.setValue(this.getValue())\" when blurring to achieve the prestine effect. That will keep the API simple, as it is only the \"setValue\" method that changes the pristine value. I fear the API becomes very complex if you get too much control of this. What do you think? \n\n**Could all inputs be triggered globally?**\nAnother good point! :-) I agree that submitting the form should set all elements to `\u00ecsPrestine() -> false`, as kind of a \"global touch\". At least make that part of the first implementation. It can be reconsidered if there is feedback on scenarios where that might be a problem. This happens in the background so can easily change it.\n\n**Programatic triggering?**\nHm, yeah, it is an interesting scenario. Though I think it will add too much complexity, at least for now. I think it is a good idea to get some more experience with \"prestining\" in Formsy :-)\n\nLet me know what you think and we can start the implementation. I think it is time to bring in some tests now too, so that should also be part of the next release. Feel free to contribute to this with pull requests, or I will start on this next Wednesday :-) \n. Hi again @FoxxMD!\n\nI have the day off tomorrow so I will be looking into all current issues and create tests, but do feel free to apply a pull request, it would be cool to see how you would solve it in the current codebase :-)\n\nAbout your question I do see your point, but I think it should be up to the developer to decide if the form could be submitted or not while invalid. For example by disabling the submit button when the form is invalid. That is why the \"onInvalid\" and \"onValid\" handlers where introduced. Give more flexibility :-) Does that make sense? Please let me know if there are scenarios I have not considered.\n. Okay, this is now in the code, also with a test. Will be part of todays release.\n. Hi Scott!\n\nYou know what, we seem to have forgotten to document the \"value\" attribute.\n\n``` javascript\n<MyElement value=\"whatever\"/>\n```\n\nThat should set the default value :-) Will update the readme now!\n\nDid that solve your problem?\n. I am having a look at this tomorrow, thanks for the feedback :-)\n. Hi again,\n\nThis is now fixed :-)\n\nWill be part of the release later today.\n. Hm, it is not fixed, broke all the tests.\n\nIt creates a circular reaction where the change of that value requires a new validation which again sets the value and again validates and so on.\n\nActually I think you have to structure this a bit differently. Instead of using the \"defaultValue\" on the input I would do this:\n\n``` javascript\n  componentWillReceiveProps: function (nextProps) {\n\n   // Only change to the new default value if it is currently showing the old one\n    if (this.getValue() === this.props.defaultValue && nextProps.defaultValue !== this.props.defaultValue) {\n      this.setValue(nextProps.defaultValue);\n    }\n  },\n```\n\nAnd if you want an empty input to change into the default input:\n\n``` javascript\n  changeValue: function (event) {\n    this.setValue(event.target.value || this.props.defaultValue);\n  }\n```\n\nI think this will solve your problem :-)\n. Let me know if I misunderstand, but you want the input to show \"John\" instantly?\n\nI think the easiest way to achieve this is by also passing it as a value:\n\n``` javascript\n<Formsy.Form url=\"/users\" onSuccess={this.changeUrl} onValid={this.enableButton} onInvalid={this.disableButton}>\n  <Form.Input name=\"firstName\" required value={this.state.profile.first} defaultValue={this.state.profile.first}/>\n  <button type=\"submit\" disabled={!this.state.canSubmit}>Submit</button>\n</Formsy.Form>\n```\n\nSo you handle the \"initial value\" using the normal \"value\" attribute, and your custom \"defaultValue\" attribute as the fallback value. You could consider also using the \"componentWillMount\" method to grab the \"defaultValue\" prop and set the value of the input:\n\n``` javascript\nvar Input = React.createClass({\n    mixins: [Formsy.Mixin],\n    componentWillMount: function () {\n      this.setValue(this.props.defaultValue);\n    },\n    changeValue: function(event) {\n        this.setValue(event.currentTarget.value || this.props.defaultValue);\n    },\n    componentWillReceiveProps: function (nextProps) {\n        // Only change to the new default value if it is currently showing the old one\n        if (this.getValue() === this.props.defaultValue && nextProps.defaultValue !== this.props.defaultValue) {\n            this.setValue(nextProps.defaultValue);\n        }\n    },\n    render: function() {\n        var className = this.showRequired() ? 'required' : this.showError() ? 'error' : null;\n        var errorMessage = this.getErrorMessage();\n\n        return (\n            <div className={className}>\n                <input type=\"text\" value={this.getValue()} onChange={this.changeValue} />\n            </div>\n        );\n    }\n});\n```\n\nThen you do not have to pass the \"value\" attribute at all, as the \"defaultValue\" attribute will be the initial value of the input.\n\nHopefully I understood the problem :-)\n. Hi yeah, that sounds right :-)\n\nMaybe you should consider not rendering the form until the async mixin is done?\n. Hi there,\n\nCould you try updating to the latest version of the lib? It now supports dynamically inserted form elements, which I think might fix your problem too. Let me know if not and we will dive into this a bit more :-)\n. Hi there,\n\nGood to hear that it works! Hm, yeah, it could handle undefined as an empty string. But again:\n\n``` javascript\n<Formsy.Form url=\"/users\" onSuccess={this.changeUrl} onValid={this.enableButton} onInvalid={this.disableButton}>\n  <MyOwnInput name=\"email\" value={this.state.profile.email || ''} />\n  <button type=\"submit\" disabled={!this.state.canSubmit}>Submit</button>\n</Formsy.Form>\n```\n\nWould also work. It should at least throw an error. Have to think about that :-)\n\nThe issue with `componentWillReceiveProps` is that a `setValue` call will trigger a new form validation, which again triggers `componentWillReceiveProps`. So you should get a loop. You could of course just do:\n\n``` javascript\ncomponentWillReceiveProps: function (nextProps) {\n  if (nextProps.value !== this.getValue()) {\n    this.setValue(nextProps.value);\n  }    \n},\n```\n\nI think :-)\n. Thanks for input @ppiekarczyk. This should be handled by Formsy now. About the pristine vs default value. Would you set up a new issue on the problem, if it still exists? Loosing my overview powers on this issue ;-)\n. Hi @MattAitchison,\n\nYeah, it should go through children of children until it meets a child with a \"name\" attribute or is at the end branch. Your experience differs?\n. Ah, sorry, I misunderstood. Currently it does not handle that. I am having a Formsy day tomorrow, so I will look into this :-)\n. Btw, how do you feel about just mapping the inputs to whatever you want instead? To me it does feel a bit weird to declare data structure in the \"HTML\" of the component. An example could be:\n\n``` javascript\nvar mapModel = function (model) {\n  return {\n    \"startYear\": model.startYear,\n    \"endYear\": model.endYear,\n    \"terms\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"term1\",\n        \"startDate\": model.term1_startDate\n        \"endDate\": model.term1_endDate\n      }\n      {\n        \"name\": \"term2\",\n        \"startDate\": model.term2_startDate\n        \"endDate\": model.term2_endDate\n      }\n    ]\n  };\n};\n<Formsy.Form mapModel={mapModel}/>\n```\n\nThis gives a lot more freedom and it reduces code complexity a lot. It also prevents locking an \"HTML\"-definition into a certain data structure. What do you think?\n. Okay, goody, I have added a \"mapping\" property to the form where you can do as explained in the previous comment. Will be part of release later today :-)\n. DOH :-) Thanks @smokku!\n. New release pushed\n. You are perfectly right, working on bug fix release now :-)\n\nNext release will include tests as this is starting to shape up quite nicely!\n. New release is pushed\n. Hi guys,\n\nWe have this API now:\n\n``` javascript\nvar Comp = React.createClass({\n  onSubmit: function (data, resetForm, invalidateForm) {\n     myAjaxService('/url', data)\n      .error(function (errors) {\n        errors // { test: \"Not valid input says the server\" }\n        invalidateForm(errors);\n      }); \n  }, \n  render: function () {\n    return (\n      <Formsy.Form onSubmit={this.onSubmit}>\n        <MyInput name=\"test\"/>\n      </Formsy.Form>\n    );\n  }\n});\n```\n\nYou could basically do whatever you want when server responds, but to map to inputs you use the \"invalidateForm\" callback.\n\nDoes that solve it? Maybe the documentation is lacking a bit here?\n. Hi @drewhamlett !\n\nDo you want to validate the form values before they are passed to the server? Or do you want to validate values passed from server before they are put into the form?\n\nWell... basically, do you want something like: `Formsy.validate(myValue, 'isEmail')` ? :-)\n. Hi again :-)\n\nThat is good to hear!\n\nAha, of course, now I understand. In theory this should work just fine, just have to implement promises support. The only restriction I see is that you might get into trouble if you run it a lot. You could add a debounce thingy around it though. Hm hm...\n\nLet me think about it and try it out, I think it should be good. It is a good idea :-)\n. Okay, so I thought about it some more. It adds a lot of complexity and it is an edge case. Is is even valid to ask the question if this really is the responsibility of Formsy.\n\nI would suggest using a \"required\" on this form element and do the ajax stuff inside it. Only if you get a valid value back from your ajax request you actually set the value, `setValue()`, which will fulfill the \"required\" and make the form element valid. \n\nDoes that make sense?\n. Just closing this as it is getting old\n. Ah, awesome, here it is :-)\n\nI will go through it tomorrow and create a new release. Thank you! :-)\n. This looks great! Thanks :-) Writing some tests and adding a couple of other things and will make a new release!\n. Hi @burtyish,\n\nActually, the input itself does not need a name attribute. Create your own credit card info formsy element, something like:\n\n``` javascript\nvar CreditCardInfoInput = React.createClass({\n  mixins: [Formsy.Mixin],\n  updateValue: function (event) {\n    this.setValue(event.target.value);\n  },\n  render: function () {\n    return <input value={this.getValue()} onChange={this.updateValue}/>\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThis wraps your plain input, without a name attribute, into a formsy element. You can now use it like this:\n\n``` javascript\n<Formsy.Form>\n  <CreditCardInfoInput name=\"creditcardinfo\"/>\n</Formsy.Form>\n```\n\nThe name attribute used here has nothing to do with the input inside. It is just a property on the **CreditCardInfoInput** component that Formsy will use to identify the property name for the value. So you are following the guidelines with this solution.\n\nHope this was an okay explanation, but please let me know if you have more questions :-)\n. Sweet :-)\n. Hi @AlexeyFrolov and thanks for the input!\n\nI do see your point with doing the validation outside of the form and use props to tell which inputs has errors etc., but how would you handle validation done when the input itself is changing? How would you handle indicating required fields? How would you handle pristine state? \n\nWith a simple form that only changes state when it is submitted I totally agree with your argument, but the increase of complexity when validating the form \"as you type\" requires this tight coupling I think. Also looking at normal HTML5 attributes with the pattern-attribute and even just using a type-attribute (email, phonenumber) gives you validation on the form, much like Formsy validations-attribute (http://www.the-art-of-web.com/html/html5-form-validation/).\n\nBut you are very welcome to just use the onSubmit method and do the validation there, passing updated error props to the inputs in your form. But then you probably would be better of just using a normal form I think :-)\n\nPlease correct me if I misunderstood your input!\n. Hi again @AlexeyFrolov,\n\nHow would you feel about something like this:\n\n``` html\n<Formsy.Form onSubmit={this.validate} errors={this.state.errors}>\n  <MyInput name=\"myInputName\" validationError=\"Something wrong here\"/>\n</Formsy.Form>\n```\n\nSo the errors object you pass in will be in the format of: { myInputName: true }. That way you can control all validation from outside the form. Would that make sense?\n\nIf not, please give me an example of how you would expand the API to cover the need discussed here :-)\n. This will soon be released as `validationErrors` property on the form. You can use `onChange` or `onSubmit` to set any errors manually by updating the object on the validationErrors prop.\n. Hi Brett!\n\nThis is a difficult one :-)\n\nFormsy allows for setting any value as the value of the form element, not just strings and booleans as you typically can with traditional form elements. If forcing everything to be a string I believe it will restrict too much, at least for now.\n\nI suppose you created the isInteger validation rule yourself? Or are you referring to the isNumeric default validation rule?\n\nIf you created isInteger yourself I suggest you add a check to the validation rule, or convert it to string as that is what you want for your specific forms. If you are referring to the default isNumeric validation rule I think it should also be \"true\" when validating integers, so I can fix that.\n\nDid I understand you correctly on this? :-)\n. Hehe, thanks for that note ;-)\n\nI will add this as a bug and fix it. Thanks for the report!\n. This should be fixed\n. Hi there!\n\nFormsy.Forms require Formsy elements, you are using a native input. If you wrap those inputs in components:\n\n``` javascript\nvar MyInput = React.createClass({\n  mixins: [Formsy.Mixin],\n  changeValue: function (event) {\n    this.setValue(event.target.value);\n  },\n  render: function () {\n    return <input value={this.getValue()} onChange={this.changeValue}/>\n  }\n});\n\n// In form component\n<Formsy.Form>\n  <MyInpuit name=\"email\"/>\n</Formsy.Form>\n\n```\n\nMaybe I should document this a bit better? The reason it works this way is that creating formsy element components, like `MyInput`, is what gives you all the functionality. It has been suggested to give a default input out of the box, but it is so rarely you actually need just a simple input. You probably always want to wrap some divs, show your validation errors as you see fit etc.\n. Hi Brett,\n\nSorry for late response, this issue got totally lost on me!\n\nThis should be fixed for next version!\n. Should be fixed\n. Looking good, except I was a bit unsure of the timeout thingy to prevent too many onChange events. I changed it around a bit and needed also to do so to make dynamic inputs work. They also trigger a change event, when they occur.\n\nAlso wrote a test for this. It is included in next release :-) thanks for the reference code!\n. Hi @gilbarbara, sorry for the late reply!\n\nAs I understand it you might get away with using an internal state:\n\n``` javascript\nvar MyInput = React.createClass({\n  mixins: [Formsy.Mixin],\n  getInitialState: function () {\n    return {\n      value: this.props.value\n    };\n  },\n  updateValue: function (event) {\n    this.setState({ value: event.target.value });\n  },\n  syncValue: function () {\n    this.setValue(this.state.value);\n  },\n  render: function () {\n    return (\n      <input\n        type={this.props.type}  \n        name={this.props.name} \n        onChange={this.updateValue}\n        onBlur={this.syncValue} \n        value={this.state.value}  \n      />\n    )\n  }\n});\n```\n\nYou think that could work?\n. Hi @gilbarbara,\n\nSo you basically just want freedom to run the validation rule on the current value, without actually triggering validation?\n\n``` javascript\n  render: function () {\n    var isValid = this.testValid();\n  }\n```\n\nSomething like that? The only thing it does is run the current value against the validator.\n. Will see if I can include this in next version :-)\n. This got a bit more complex than first expected, have to wait for next release\n. Okay, this will be part of next release :-)\n. And it has been accepted, awesome stuff, thanks :-)\n. Awesome, thanks :-)\n\nWill include it in next release!\n. And again, thanks! I will pull it in, just verify a couple of things before release, but looks good! :-)\n. That makes sense, thanks Hana :-)\n. Nice :-) I will just move the querySelector line to be run once. Not that we will hit a performance issue... have to blame OCD. Glad you like it!\n. Lets give it a try :-)\n. Yeah, that would be awesome. Starting to work on next release tomorrow:\n\n``` javascript\n<MyInput validationError={{email: 'whatup', foo: 'bar'}}/>\n```\n\nJust makes sense :-) You think so too?\n. Jup, thats what I wrote too? :-)\n. Ah, yeah, hehe, sorry. Will implement this for next version. Thanks for a great input!\n. Is included in next version\n. Ah, sorry, I confused this with a different issue. Will implement very soon :-)\n. Hi!\n\nYeah, it was a usability decision there. Please give me a comment on how it went converting the rules. Maybe we can find a solution here :-)\n. @jhampton You know, the next release has a `validationsError` prop on the form which can be used for external validation tools. Will give an example in next release which is right around the corner :-)\n. Hi @sdemjanenko ,\n\nDo you have an example of when this happened? Its just to keep my head wrapped around the scenarios the form can get into :-)\n. Hi @bryannaegele! This looks great, thanks!\n. btw, I added a validation run when the validations change, so that existing values that receives new validations are validated against those immediately.\n. Checking this out for the next release :-)\n. This should work with version 0.8.0\n. Hi @sdemjanenko , you have lots of ideas, great! :-)\n\nSo what you are suggesting here is the need for having a reusable set of inputs that would namespace their names? So in your example the inputs would be:\n- one.foo and on.bar\n- two.foo and two.bar\n\n?\n\nYou should be able to solve this with just plain React and Formsy though?\n\n``` js\nvar ScopedInput = React.createClass({\n  mixins: [Formsy.Mixin],\n  render: function() {\n    return <div>\n      <MyInput name={this.props.name + 'foo'} value={...} />\n      <MyInput name={this.props.name + 'bar'}  value={...} />\n    </div>;\n  }\n});\n\nvar ConfigureForm = React.createClass({\n  render: function() {\n    return <Formsy.Form ...>\n      <ScopedInput name=\"one\" />\n      <ScopedInput name=\"two\" />\n    </Formsy.Form>\n  }\n});\n```\n\nI think a mixin hides too much implementation details, unless I am misunderstanding something here of course :-)\n. Hi guys,\n\nSorry that I do not quite understand why you need this ;-) You have a couple of more examples?\n\nTo namespace inputs I would suggest as the example above:\n\n``` js\nvar ScopedInput = React.createClass({\n  mixins: [Formsy.Mixin],\n  render: function() {\n    return <div>\n      <MyInput name={this.props.name + 'foo'} value={...} />\n      <MyInput name={this.props.name + 'bar'}  value={...} />\n    </div>;\n  }\n});\n\nvar ConfigureForm = React.createClass({\n  render: function() {\n    return <Formsy.Form ...>\n      <ScopedInput name=\"one\" />\n      <ScopedInput name=\"two\" />\n    </Formsy.Form>\n  }\n});\n```\n\nBut I think there is something I do not quite get here maybe? Would be great with some more code examples :-)\n. Hm hm, do you have some example code @sebas5384? I have a feeling I am misunderstanding? Or does my example above solve the issue? :-)\n. Nested inputs are implemented in last version. name=\"foo.bar\" = {foo: {bar: VALUE}}\n. Hm, okay, I will check this locally first. Thanks for contributing! :-)\n. Okay, I have to solve this a bit differently, but thanks for contributing to the solution!\n. Okido, I will try to provoke this error and create a test for it too, thanks! \n. Ah, of course, thanks for that @snario !\n. Hi @sdemjanenko,\n\nYou should be able to do that using the \"onChange\" property of the form? Or does that not suffice?\n. Yeah, you make a good point here, I will bring it in with the next version :-)\n. hi again @sdemjanenko ,\n\nLooking at this again I just want to discuss a bit more before implementing. I just have to make sure that I do not add something that does not cover the challenge you are having.\n\nSo, the issue here is that you want to grab the initial state of the form. Saying that you are referring to the inputs and their values? The object that you receive on `onChange`?\n\nWould it not be possible to just set that initial state on your wrapping form component?\n\n``` js\nvar FormWrapper = React.createClass({\n  getInitialState: function () {\n    return {\n      values: {\n        foo: 'bar'\n      }\n    };\n  },\n  setValues: function (values) {\n    this.setState({values: values});\n  },\n  render: function () {\n    return (\n      <Formsy.Form onChange={this.setValues}>\n        <MyInput value={this.state.values.foo}/>\n      </Formsy.Form>\n    );\n  }\n});\n```\n\nAnd when the \"onChange\" event is received you use that to set the new values?\n. Looking at the implementation it seems that you want to check if the values of the form has changed? So if a user has changed something back to the pristine value you want it to be \"hasChanged = false\"?\n. @eventhough This is an interesting suggestion! Would you mind creating a new issue on that? I will close this now. I would suspect we have to add a flag-property to the form. Thanks :-)\n. Aha, nice, thanks :-)\n. Yeah, you make a good point here. Though I think we get more flexibility by introducing: `onValidSubmit`and `onInvalidSubmit`. So `onSubmit` always fires. What do you think?\n. Allrighty, this is part of next release :-)\n. Yeah, that would be awesome :-) I was thinking of including \"clean implementations\" of the default form elements. So instead of `<input type=\"text\" name=\"foo\" value=\"bar\"/>` you would say: `<Formsy.Input type=\"text\" name=\"foo\" value=\"bar\"/>` and you would get the exact same thing.\n\nWhat do you think? Not possible to do it with native inputs, at least not with current implementation, and what current implementation details would be lost if going down that path.\n\nIt is an interesting idea for a second version of Formsy though. The lib is not really very \"simplistic\" right now, but it solves the complexity of forms I think, and that was the main focus of the first version :-)\n. Will include this on release after next one :-)\n. @eriklharper Since you mentioned contributing, this would also be an awesome contribution. You seem to have some ideas there too ;-)\n\n@alexduan Yeah, could have a separate project bringing wrapped bootstrap components. That would indeed be very nice :-)\n. hi @afitiskin and thanks for the suggestion!\n\nThough I like the concept of a container, I am a bit uncertain how this would be reusable. I think it would be nice to just:\n\n``` js\n<Formsy.Form>\n    <Formsy.Input/>\n    <Formsy.Textarea/>\n</Formsy.Form>\n```\n\nAnd implement a Formsy version of displaying validation errors etc. ReactSelect would not work of course, but again you would have to implement all the required, validation error display etc., so you would have to build a form element component for ReactSelect regardless.\n\nLet me know if I misunderstood your example!\n. I have been thinking about this some more and though I think it is nice with a default set of elements I do not think Formsy itself should have this. There are just so many ways to handle validation. Its better that other projects provide form elements with custom validation handling in regards of UI.\n\nLike the https://github.com/twisty/formsy-react-components project.\n\nI will update the README to point to that project.\n. Hi @simiographics ,\n\nFormsy does support dynamic inputs. It should be possible in your form wrapper component to have custom logic for your checkboxes. When clicking them you render the different input groups. Formsy should notice this and change its internal model. \n\ndid that make sense? I could give you an example if it seems a bit fuzzy :-)\n. Hi @eriklharper ,\n\nAha, I see. Yeah, onSubmit should trigger when the form itself is programmatically triggered. Will check this out, keeping it open as a BUG. thanks and glad you worked it out :-) \n. Hi @eriklharper,\n\nHave you tried not wrapping in jQuery? This seems to work on my end. Just do:\n\n``` js\nthis.refs.question1.getDOMNode().submit();\n```\n\nUse native behavior. jQuery probably does some crazy wrapping messing things up :-)\n. Hi again @eriklharper ,\n\nHm, yeah. You would have to register a native event listener preventing that behavior. What a pickle this is :-D\n\nYeah, `getCurrentValues()` is actually an internal method, but glad I exposed it now. Let me add this as an enhancement and document it. Glad it worked out for you. Sounds like a very reasonable implementation.\n\nYeah, jQuery registers a listener and wraps \"event.preventDefault\" by default I believe :-)\n. Hi @mull,\n\nCould you explain a bit more what you are trying to achieve? Formsy handles the native form submition and prevents default behaviour. What do you need the form event for?\n. Hi @mull,\n\nThis is probably the wiring of React I believe, since you trigger a native event doing that. But you can do this:\n\n``` js\ntestSubmit() {\n  this.refs.form.submit(); // Point directly to the form component\n},\n\nrender() {\n  return (\n    <Formsy.Form ref=\"form\">\n      {/* some inputs */}\n    </Formsy.Form\n  );\n}\n```\n\nDoes that solve your challenge?\n. Hehe, great ;-)\n. @mull ,\n\nBut things work as you want now? If so, I will close the issue :-)\n. Sweet!\n. Second argument should be a reset function. Does it not set pristine state\nmaybe?\nOn tor. 12. mars 2015 at 20:25 Stephen Demjanenko notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> I have a case where after submitting a form I would like to reset it to\n> the pristine state.\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/issues/46.\n. Yes, you are right! There was an initial uncertainty on \"what is a none value\". But since Formsy ended up allowing any kind of value really this should be given an other look.\n. This is fixed in next version\n. Cool :-)\n. Jup, I agree, this fits well with the new `validationErrors` prop on the form. Will include in next release :-)\n. Hi again,\n\nI started to implement this and realized that though an object would be nice it is difficult to translate some values. Like:\n\nisLength:5:12\n\nAnd most validators are simple strings. Like if you create an app you would rather create your own validators like \"isUser\", \"isProduct\" etc.\n\nBut I fixed the bug :-)\n\nI want to keep the API as simple as possible, so I think it should be strings or object. not both. I hope to get around to build Formsy React 2, which probably will use objects instead. Learned a lot from inputs on this project. Some good decisions and some bad were made ;-)\n. I decided to use: `'value' in this.props` as you really should allow any value. But great contribution and thanks for the tests :-)\n. Thanks for that @sdemjanenko :-)\n. Ops, thanks ;-)\n. Hi @sdemjanenko,\n\nThe implementation looks good, but I just have to understand the scenario where you need it. The API is getting pretty large and I try to be a bit restrictive if it can be solved an other way :-)\n\nLets continue discussion on #40 \n. You know, I am sold on this implementation, will just change the dep to the internal isSame util. Thanks @sdemjanenko , will be part of next release!\n. Will manually bring this in.\n. @sdemjanenko You make an excellent point. I will try to make this part of next release!\n. This is part of next release now\n. Good point, hm... I just want to get this next release out and will look into this when its out. Thanks for the input!\n. Just wanted to let you know that this will be part of release 0.13\n. This is now added! :-)\n. I am having a full review of testing before next release. With Node 0.4 release I have to change the way testing is done. It will be better :-)\n. Fantastic, thanks for contributing! :-)\n. Hi @Semigradsky, thanks for bringing that to my attention. That is a bug, will be fixed with next release, thanks :-)\n. Fixed in next release\n. Hi @Semigradsky ,\n\nThanks for the input, this looks like a good idea!\n. Decided that XHR will be removed in 1.0 release as it is very easy to hook that manually to the form. Formsy is a form lib, not xhr lib. Covered too much initially ;-)\n. Hi @frost555 ,\n\nSorry for late response, I have been suck with the flue.\n\nAs I understand it when an error from the server occurs you want that error message to be ignored when the input is changed? The error should be reset every time `setValue()` is called. Does that not happen?\n. hi again @frost555,\n\nI will check this ASAP\n. Hi @frost555 ,\n\nVery sorry about the delay here. I can confirm the error and will try to make a fix right now. Thanks for reporting!\n. Okay, fixed, there was indeed a bug here. Thanks for reporting @frost555 ! Will be part of next release\n. Hi @mistakster ,\n\nSo sorry for late reply, but I have been sick with the flue, but back on my feet now :-)\n\nWill merge an release new version!\n. At 99% ;-)\n\nReleased new version, hope everything works okay now.\n. Hi @philippotto ,\n\nThanks for the input!\n\nDo you have a code example of how you would like this to work? Just so I am completely sure that I understand what you are asking for :-)\n. Cool, I will check it out :-)\n. Ah, great, thanks for that :-)\n. Hi @jonaswindey ,\n\nSo sorry for the delay here, but I have been sick withe the flue and at the same time moving across the country, bad timing on my part ;-)\n\nI have merged and released a new version supporting 0.13.1. Thanks so much for your patience!\n\nbtw, made sure old version of React still works so will just close this pull request.\n. Hi @philippotto,\n\nI have implemented a `isValidValue` that you can use inside a component to run any value against the set validators for that component. So it runs the exact same code as when the real validation occurs. Let me know if this does not behave as expected :-)\n\nI will work on running the tests with travis as soon as the next release is out :-)\n. Hi again @philippotto ,\n\nAha, I see, sorry about my confusion on this :-)\n\nYou are correct in your assumption about isValidValue. Okay, I think I understand what you want now :-)\n\nYou want Formsy to validate in two different ways. Either by passing global formsy validation rules as props or, as you propose, run a method on the component which has its own validation logic.\n\nThat makes sense :-)\n\nI would suggest just calling it : `validate`. Let me pull this request now and put it next release.\n. This is fixed :-)\n. Hi guys,\n\nYeah. Formsy does take an approach with React that is not best practice. There is a new release coming up now with some more functionality. After that I will start on Formsy 2, which conforms more to best practices, but will probably have a few breaking changes.\n\nThe challenge is that a form needs to create a relationship with its children form elements. Now this is done by iterating the children of the form instance, adding some properties and a mixin on the form elements uses these props to communicate with the form instance.\n\nAn other way to go about this is using pure events, but that changes the syntax and I am unsure if it is doable. It would be something like this:\n\n``` js\nvar Form = React.createClass({\n  mixins: [Formsy.FormMixin],\n  render: function () {\n    return (\n      <Formsy.Form>\n        <MyFormElement name=\"foo\"/>\n      </Formsy.Form>\n    );\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThe mixin finds the FormsyForm element in the component and registers custom event listeners like: \"Formsy.setValue\", which then the children form elements can trigger and will be catched by the parent form. The problem is that React JS does not support custom events, would have to use native events, which reduces the testability with Formsy as tests would have to be run in the browser. I think this might be a good tradeoff though. \n\nLet me create an issue discussing next version of Formsy :-)\n. Linking to issue: #66 \n. @gaeron , thanks for that input! This definitely seems like a valid way to go. I have been using it to solve other scenarios, so I will play around with it a bit :-)\n. Hm,\n\nSeems we have to wait for React 0.14. Tried getting this new parent-child context temporary patch working, https://gist.github.com/jamesknelson/1481521444e1529d59aa#file-react-parent-context-patch-js, but can not get it to work.\n. @jmartin84 Will look into it, might work :-) Thanks!\n. @jmartin84 I checked it out, but it only works with immediate children, need something a bit more flexible. Got the new parent-child context thing running now so I think we will end with that solution .It is also confirmed for next React release, so I think we are in the clear on this challenge :-) Thanks for the suggestion though! \n. @jmartin84 Actually, this is exactly what we can do. I just did not see clearly how to handle nested children, but I do now :-) Will create a fix for this. Will still change to context on React 0.14, @gaearon , as it is more optimized. But now we are in the clear, awesome, thanks!\n. Hi @Semigradsky,\n\nThat is the bundled release. To use formsy in Node environments you require it like a normal NPM module:\n\n``` js\nvar a = require('formsy-react');\n```\n\nHope that answers your quesiton :-)\n. Hi again,\n\nIt is for people using bower or just use a normal script tag and use it globally :-) Or requirejs.\n. Hm, bower.json we still need though? Bower checks what tag to download by looking at that file?\n. Ah, sorry, I am confusing with .gitignore :-)\n\nI will pull it in! Thanks\n. Hi @Semigradsky,\n\nThis is a great contribution, thanks! Version 1.0.0 of Formsy will use webpack also for development, so this is very welcome indeed. \n. @Semigradsky ,\n\nYeah, I agree on that. I will remove it for next version. Thanks for the input!\n. Hi @gpbmike ,\n\nDo you set the initial value to false? \n\n``` js\n<MyCheckBox value={false}/>\n```\n\nIf so it should work. The `'value' in this.props` only checks if the key \"value\" exists in props, not if the value is \"truthy\".\n\nThe reason behind '' is that you can really create any element. If a checkbox has its value by default false, there is no way for Formsy to understand that. You kinda have to tell it by passing a default \"false\" value. What you get back though is lots of flexibility in what kind of form elements you want to build :-) \n\nExample of checkbox:\n\n``` js\nvar MyCheckbox = React.createClass({\n  mixins: [Formsy.Mixin],\n  changeValue: function (event) {\n    this.setValue(!this.getValue());\n  },\n  render: function () {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" checked={this.getValue()} onChange={this.changeValue}/>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n});\n\n<MyCheckBox name=\"foo\" value={false}/>\n```\n. Ah, cool, great :-)\n. Hi @marnusw ,\n\nThanks for taking the time to review the implementation :-)\n\nThe reason I implemented `setInputValidationErrors` is because that one will always go through all inputs and set the valid state based on any errors passed. It basically resets the input if there was an error there, and then there is no error. So it is needed.\n\nThe `updateInputsWithError` does the opposite. It goes through any errors passed and set those errors, as you say.\n\nThat said, you might be right :-) But I believe the first method has to be used, because it makes sure that any inputs that current state is error is reset to valid state when there is no error anymore. Does that make sense?\n\nI agree that `getCurrentValues()` eliminates `updateModel()`. Cleans up the code :-)\n\nWould be great if created a pull request for this, though make sure that passing errors on the form, and then removing them, resets the inputs to valid state.\n. Cool! I will just close this issue. Please comment again if you want to discuss some details on this :)\n. Thanks @paddyinpdx, will fix this on next release :-)\n. This one should work on release 0.12\n. Hi @gilbarbara ,\n\nFound the bug, it will be fixed on next release, thanks for reporting :-)\n. Hi @mloginov ,\n\nFound the bug, will be fixed on next version, thanks for reporting! :-)\n. Hi @arunthampi, yeah, that would be great! Thanks a lot, and thanks @Semigradsky for helping out with support! :+1: \n. Hi @frost555,\n\nThanks for noticing, will fix that!\n. Fixed, will be in next release\n. Hi @Semigradsky, thanks for the pull! I chose to handpick and implement myself, but you will get credit for it, thanks for the pull! ;-)\n. Hi @Semigradsky,\n\nAwesome stuff! Could you create a pull to document the example and how to run it? That would be awesome!\n. @Semigradsky, maybe add it with a pull to explain how to run the examples? As mentioned in #79. Would be really great, thanks for contributing! :-)\n. HI @frost555 ,\n\nYeah, I think you are right, I can not see a scenario where it would be useful. But if it appears, we know what to implement :-)\n. HI @eriklharper ,\n\nI think you have to fix a couple of things first:\n\nevent.target.value, not currentTarget. currentTarget would be the body I think, as that is where the event is captured. target is the element that triggered the event, the input :-)\n\nAnd I also see you referencing `this.state.required`,should be `this.props.required`?\n\nHope this helps!\n. Hi @eriklharper,\n\nGreat you got it working :-)\n\nI would love getting started with the wiki. The repo has a technical description, but the wiki could be a more practical description. Showing how you build different types of form elements and explaining strategies to validations etc.\n\nhttps://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/wiki\n\nFeel free to do whatever you want there, or nothing if its boring ;-)\n. Hi @janmyler ,\n\nSorry for late response. Formsy will still require mixins, but the relationship between the form and the form elements will technically use context. It is more performant than the current solution and the Formsy.Form element and its child form elements can actually live in different \"owners\". Which basically means they can live inside different \"render\" methods and still have a relationship.\n. @pkmiec and @firstdoit , yeah, I totally agree. I have no experience with React Intl (You referring to Yahoo?) or formatjs, but I am very open to suggestions and examples of how to handle this!\n. React 0.14 is now in Beta and I am working on the next release. When 0.14 is released and the new version has been tested, we go for 1.0 release :-) \n\nWhen it comes to translation I do not see why formsy needs a wrapper for this. As you probably have other translations in your project already, so:\n\n``` js\n<MyInput validations=\"isEmail\" validationErrors={{isEmail: translate('invalidEmail') }}/>\n```\n\nIt would work just like translating any other text in your components?\n\nClosing this issue as things are moving along.\n. Hi @bryannaegele,\n\nJust wondered why you closed it? Did it not work out?\n\nI have just been busy working on fixing the props warning stuff for React 0.13.1, so have not had time reviewing the pull. Overall it makes a lot of sense, but have to dive into it a bit more :-)\n. Hi guys,\n\n@adamellsworth, @jmartin84 @darth10 @sdemjanenko @Semigradsky \n\nI have an idea! :-)\n\nI have been thinking a lot about the warnings on props being overriden. There are a few different strategies, but all of them involve \"heavy lifting\". The most effective and least intrusive is just for Formsy to suppress the specific props warnings. Normally I would say that is a bad thing, but since warnings are there to notify changes in the API and Formsy already has the implementation ready for next version AND you can not update to 1.0.0 without specifically telling NPM to do s, I believe this to be the best solution. It will ONLY suppress Formsy props warning, not other prop overrides. It does this by wrapping `console.warn` and checks for those specific messages.\n\nThe will be implemented as:\n\n``` js\nFormsy.suppressWarnings();\n// Log will show: \"Formsy is suppressing its props override until React 0.14. console.warning is wrapped and will not display correct source and line number in console\"\n```\n\nIf I get an ok on this I will release a new version instantly :-)\n\nThanks!\n. I did some more research on this. There is a different method that will avoid this \"hack\". It is actually a method that would work even after React 0.14, though using context will optimize it. Will release it as soon as I can.\n. Ready for release.\n. Ah, missing a test for that one! Will create and thanks for fixing it @gneutzling! Will release new version now.\n. Hi @olimsaidov, \n\nThe change log is the releases. On the \"releases\" tab. I can point it out more in the documentation :-)\n. Hi @frost555 , since version 0.11 Formsy no longer handles Ajax directly. You have to wire it up manually. The reason is that Formsy should focus on being a good form validation tool, not ajax tool :-)\n\nSo by using `onSubmit` or `onValidSubmit` you can do the ajax call there and reset/invalidate the form with the callbacks received as arguments to these methods. That way you can also map whatever response you get from the server.\n\nI have fixed the error you pointed out, thanks for that ;-)\n. I suggest adding this as a default property on the form. Is there any reason you would not want to have \"novalidate\"... I mean, the reason you use formsy is to handle custom validation? :-)\n. Added this now. You can turn it off with: `<Formsy.Form novalidate={false}/> will be part of next release :-) Thanks!\n. Hi @dprentis,\n\nI did something wrong on first implementation. You should be able to use `formNoValidate` on the inputs too... the actual native inputs that is :-)\n. Hi guys, sorry for late reply, been in loss of time.\n\nI have not tested this very well. So what you are saying is that if we change documentation to:\n\n``` js\n<Formsy.Form>\n   <input name=\"foo\" required />\n   <input name=\"submit\" formNoValidate type=\"Submit\" />\n</Formsy.Form>\n```\n\nWe are in the clear on this? formNoValidate does the job, though only on the native form element that runs the submit of the form? It being an input or a button?\n. Jup, I agree, will fix this for next release\n. @e-monson This seems like native behaviour. If you want commas you have to run with your own input where you suppress letters.\n. I absolutely agree. This was changed due to Formsy allowing any kind of form element with any kind of value, but these validations specifically point to \"inputs\", where a \"none-value\" should be valid.\n\nThis is fixed in next version! Thanks :-)\n. Hi @dprentis,\n\nThere seems to be a bug here, working on it now. Thanks for reporting!\n. Okay, fixed it... releasing new version now. Sorry about that, but written test for it too. Will not happen again :-)\n. Thanks for reporting, this is fixed in next release which arrives today :-)\n. Thanks for reporting @adamellsworth !\n\nReleased 0.12.1 now. The implementation was misunderstood. Sorry about that.\n. Hi guys!\n\nI am releasing a new version now where this is fixed :-) let you know!\n. Okay, released 0.12.5, https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/releases/tag/v0.12.5, would be great if you could verify that it works :-)\n. Hi @pkmiec ,\n\nGreat, thanks!\n\nYeah, this is a very specific implementation detail. The `onSubmit` you can register on a Formsy.Form  could get more information than just the value. Could even pass the component itself. So you would:\n\n``` js\nvar MyForm = React.createClass({\n  mySubmit: function (inputs, reset, invalidate) {\n    inputs.foo.getValue();\n    inputs.foo.isPristine();\n    inputs.foo.isValid();\n    inputs.foo.hasExternalError(); // new method\n  },\n  render: function () {\n    return (\n      <Formsy.Form onSubmit={this.submit}>\n        <MyInput name=\"foo\" validations=\"isEmail\"/>\n      </Formsy.Form>\n    );\n  }\n});\n```\n\nDo you think something like that would be valuable?\n. Hi again guys and thanks for the discussion! This is a tough one and its difficult for me to decide on a good solution as I have not really been in this specific situation before. So I will just give some more suggestions on solving it with focus on keeping the API clean and simple :-)\n\n``` js\nonSubmit: function (model, reset, setErrors) {\n  setErrors(serverErrors, false); // Passing false will not invalidate the inputs, only set errors\n}\n```\n\nYou think that would cover the need? The way you can decide by scenario if you want external errors to actually invalidate the inputs, or just give an error? Again, any change to the input would clear the error of that specific input.\n. Hi @pkmiec ,\n\nThanks for the suggestion! I think we are getting somewhere here, though I am not quite sure about delegating it to the mixin. I do see the advantage of overriding, I think it looks quite nice, but the validation of an input is not determined by the mixin, but the form. Because the valid state affects both the form and possibly other inputs.\n\nSo if I understand your suggestion correctly the form would not be able to invalidate on external errors, only a particular input would. \n\nThe way I see it is that we have two very specific behaviours we want to achieve. \"Should external errors invalidate the input and form, or should it not?\". Translating this to an API change that question is most simply answered with a boolean. My initial suggestion was on the callback of invalidating with external errors, but what about a form prop instead?\n\n``` js\n<Formsy.Form preventExternalErrorValidation/>\n```\n\nOr did I miss an important point here? ;-)\n. Okay, adding `preventExternalInvalidation` in new release\n. Hi @pkmiec ,\n\nCould you check again with latest version? There was a bug with the required validation\n. Hmf, git is doing something weird with this code. Fixed with new version and added tests for it. Thanks for reporting!\n. Hi @Semigradsky,\n\nThanks for the fix! Great, I really appreciate the help :-) If you are ever in Trondheim, Norway, I will buy you a beer!\n. Great stuff! Thanks! Would you like to become official contributor @Semigradsky? Any changes to Formsy API have to be discussed of course, but you can go crazy with examples and documentation. And tests... ;-)\n. Cool, done, and thanks again :-)\n. Hi guys,\n\nReleased 0.12.5 which should fix this error. https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/releases/tag/v0.12.5\n. Hi Bryan,\n1. This absolutely makes sense\n2. If I understand you correctly you would get the opposite problem if pre populating with invalid data and expect it to trigger onInvalid? :-) Maybe a better solution is to ensure that the onValid/onInvalid always triggers after initialising?\n\nThanks for contributing with this!\n. Just cleaning up issues. Though you pointed out some good stuff here I will close the issue, as I have not gotten feedback on this by anyone else and I require some more discussions to make a solution. Please keep on commenting to make this part of formsy.\n. Hey @dprentis ,\n\nGot a pull request with lots of validation fixes, including this one. Could you verify that pull? #105 supports what you have considered? I will be releasing that now first. So it would be great with a new pull if you see anything it does not support. Sorry for the inconvenience. \n. @aesopwolf Are you not able to update to React 0.13.x? If so, that would be great, or we have to look more into it with more information.\n. Okay, glad you found a solution.  I say we just close this as people will be moving on to React 0.13 and especially React 0.14 with its new \"parent-child\" context which will help a lot of libraries out there.\n. I think it looks awesome! I have also opened up the WIKI for a more \"practical approach to Formsy\", as the README is very technical, and should be really.\n\nIf you have ideas to adding examples of building for elements and/or validation strategies, please feel free to go crazy :-)\n\nThanks, this is an awesome pull!\n. Hi @erwanjegouzo ,\n\nThis is really great work. Pulling it in! Thanks a bunch!\n. Hi @simiographics ,\n\nCould you paste a bit more code that causes the crash? If you are doing something wrong, something is missing in the documentation ;-)\n. Hi @simiographics,\n\nYou seem to be creating a loop here. Whenever the input changes you clean it again. In what situation do you want the input to be cleared? I suppose you do not want that whenever it changes?\n. Hi again,\n\nThis is very strange. I was not able to reproduce the error on a test I ran locally. I am thinking there is something \"outside\" causing the issue.\n\nCould you paste the complete code that runs on the previous example you gave? Try to narrow it completely down to just rendering the form with the input? I have to reproduce it to figure out what is happening.\n\nWould also be great to know what version of React your are running.\n\nNobody else has reported this kind of error so I would believe it is a weird edge case. Would be great to get to the bottom of it though :-)\n. Thanks so much for helping me out with this! Looking at it right now!\n. Okay, it is definitely a bug here. Tracking it now and will release a new version when it is fixed.\n. Okay, found the bug, fixing it now. It was a value comparison that did not handle objects and arrays.\n. Okay, fixed, creating a new release now. Just have to document a couple of things :)\n. Okay, released version 0.13 with some other fixes too\n. Great, let me know how it goes :-)\n. Hi @simiographics,\n\nIt seems my test did not cover this scenario. Working on it now!\n. Okay, a stupid mistake, strange that the test did not get it. Now tested with your example. Will release later today.\n. Okay, released new version, would be awesome if you could test it again. Thanks for your patience @simiographics !\n. Sweet! Good to hear and thanks!\n. Hi there! Thanks for checking this out and creating a great test case. I\nwill look into this tomorrow morning :-)\nOn Thu 23 Apr 2015 at 17:45 Pavel Nuzhdin notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> +1 it affects me too!\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/issues/107#issuecomment-95629513\n> .\n. Hi there,\n\nWhen testing React and Formsy in Node you need to load up JSDOM. At least currently. This is also required by other libraries so please do something like this in your test setup:\n\n``` js\nvar jsdom = require(\"jsdom\").jsdom;\nglobal.document = jsdom();\nglobal.window = document.defaultView;\nglobal.navigator = global.window.navigator;\n```\n\nI am releasing a new test suite with Formsy today that uses this setup. You can check that out for more inspiration :-)\n. Hi again,\n\nHm, thats weird. The Formsy tests runs fine, though using jasmine-node and jsdom. Let me complete the test setup here as there might be a code change in Formsy since I last run that setup.\n\nIf I get the same error I will fix it or I will check out the repo with tests to dive into as it must be jest related.\n. Okay, I can verify that all Formsy tests runs fine with jasmine-node and jsdom. Looking into jest now\n. @worklez \n\nWhat verison of Node are you running? Seems that Jest does not support 0.12? Trying version 0.10.25, but getting an error there too.\n. Okay,\n\nI figured it out. Not quite sure why this happens. It might be a JSDOM thing. But you can not require the component inside the test, you have to do this:\n\n``` js\njest.autoMockOff();\nvar React = require('react/addons');\nvar TestUtils = React.addons.TestUtils;\nvar LoginPage = require('./../LoginPage.js');\n\ndescribe('LoginPage', function () {\n    it('has submit button disabled', function () {\n        var loginPage = TestUtils.renderIntoDocument(React.createElement(LoginPage));\n    });\n});\n```\n. Great, let me know how it works out! I keep pondering on why this causes an issue, it should not matter where you require. But I definitely think it is an environment thing and not a Formsy thing. Anyways, it is better to require them at the top because you probable have multiple tests using the same component :-)\n. Great! I will close the issue then. Yeah, it is a really weird problem. It would be worth checking out if this works:\n\n``` js\njest.autoMockOff();\nvar React = require('react/addons');\nvar TestUtils = React.addons.TestUtils;\n\ndescribe('LoginPage', function () {\n    it('has submit button disabled', function () {\n        var LoginPage = require('./../LoginPage.js');\n        var loginPage = TestUtils.renderIntoDocument(LoginPage());\n    });\n});\n```\n\nThe error itself is related to how the component is wrapped I think, or lack there of. You have `createElement` and also `createFactory` which needs to be used as wrappers on plain components. JSX syntax does this for you. Maybe the components gets wrapped automatically when required inside the tests?\n. Ah, hm, okay thanks for reporting that back. I am out of theories, at least right now. Let you know if I figure it out ;-)\n. Great input @erwanjegouzo, I think this follows the current API. Will need a couple of tests and some README documentation. If you have time, please fork latest version with jasmine-node tests and create a pull for that too. Or else I will find some time to do it :-)\n. Already did it, no worries :-)\n. Hi @binarykitchen ,\n\nIf that native feature is enough you should definitely use it. But Formsy is a form element builder and validator that takes the concept of form validation a lot further than native functionality. Formsy gives you any type of validation you desire and form handlers that triggers whenever the form elements you build change, becomes valid, invalid. External errors can be injected, cross input validation is not a problem etc.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any more questions to Formsy :-)\n. @binarykitchen using native validation would not conform with the validation possibilities you have with Formsy. So even though it would be one less validation rule packed into Formsy, setting type=\"email\" would not give you the possibility to check if input is pristine, it is required, disable the form when it is invalid etc. Btw, native invalid inputs looks different in all browsers, it is not very nice ;-)\n. You have to wrap all your form elements in a Formsy.Form:\n\n``` js\n<Formsy.Form>\n  <MyInputElement/>\n</Formsy.Form>\n```\n. I can improve that error message to be more explicit :-)\n. This is supported yes, but not when the Form is located in a different component... a different render method\n. @firstdoit ,\n\nYou are perfectly right :-) Looking forward to React 0.14 with parent-child context though, then this will not be an issue anymore!\n\nThanks for the feedback, much appreciated ;-)\n. Hi @binarykitchen ,\n\nYou have to provide a Formsy.Form element too:\n\n``` js\n<Formsy.Form>\n        <MyInput\n          hasFeedback\n          required\n          name  = {@props.passwordName}\n          label = {t(\"Password\")}\n          value = {@state.password}\n        >\n</Formsy.Form>\n```\n. It has to be inside the same component :-)\n\nIn React 0.14 we get parent-child context which will fix this, but currently it is not possible.\n. You are the first person to point it out actually ;-)\n\nWe are using Formsy on a huge project with a lot of forms and have not met that issue. That said, it would be nice to have, and it will when React 0.14 is released.\n. Jup, the important thing is that you find something that works for you :-)\n. Just to make sure there was no misunderstanding here :-) :\n\nThis works:\n\n``` js\nvar MyForm = React.createClass({\n  render: function () {\n    return (\n      <Formsy.Form>\n        <div>\n          <MyInput/>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n             <MyInput/>\n           </div>\n        </div>\n      </Formsy.Form>\n    );\n  }\n});\n```\n\nBut this does not until React 0.14:\n\n``` js\nvar MyFormContent = React.createClass({\n  render: function () {\n    return (\n        <div>\n          <MyInput/>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n             <MyInput/>\n           </div>\n        </div>\n    );\n  }\n});\n\nvar MyForm = React.createClass({\n  render: function () {\n    <Formsy.Form>\n      <MyFormContent/>\n    </Formsy.Form>\n  }\n});\n```\n. React 0.14 is now in BETA and new formsy version is right around the corner. Will release some test info very soon.\n. Great @michaelcontento , thanks for taking the time! :-)\n. @sanemat ,\n\nJust want to make sure things are working for you after the latest release?\n. Good question!\n\nMaybe just remove it. Formsy adds complexity allowing for any kind of form element, not just traditional inputs, so I think that is too generic.\n\nMaybe change it out with the new \"isExisty\" function instead? And call is: \"isExisty\"? :-)\n. @Semigradsky Cool, nice! Will release new version with changes. \n\nBtw, I think it is easier to control releases if changes are pull requests. NPM and bower uses the tags and the current tag does not have isExisty in it, but people can read about it on the repo :-)\n\nNo biggy, but seems like a good way to do it?\n. Lets add a new tag, just have to review pull requests etc. do document a new release. Will do that tomorrow :-)\n. Hi there,\n\nThanks for discussing this. It has been a bit difficult identifying required/validation regarding \"empty values\" as formsy supports any kind of form element, not just traditional inputs.\n\nBut we are getting there :-)\n. Hi @mloginov ,\n\nIdentified problem, working on fix now, will probably be released later today. Thanks for reporting!\n. Okay, released new version, please try again :-)\n. Hi @tomaash and thanks for the pull!\n\nI agree this should be in there, but I have a suggestion for you. Since the goal here is to set some initial values, maybe we should put:\n\n``` js\n<Formsy.Form values={{\n  foo: 'bar',\n  bar: 'foo'\n}}>\n  <MyInput name=\"foo\"/>\n  <MyInput name=\"bar\"/>\n</Formsy.Form>\n```\n\nThat way it is very specific to what you want to achieve, set some initial data. We could of course also merge in your change, as you still might need to reset the values easily :-)\n. Hi @tomaash , so sorry for late reply, but I have been completely in loss of time the last week. I will release a new version tomorrow morning including your fix!\n. Hi @crdeutsch and so sorry for the late reply. I have been deep into a different project and have just been in loss of time.\n\nIt might seem a bit aggressive to do the validation on each key press, though as I understand it you mean that from a user experience perspective, not a technical perspective?\n\nI would suggest that you add your own state to your form element. Something like, `showValidation`. That way you can choose with onBlur or Enter to set that state to true and combine it with the internal methods of Formsy. Like:\n\n``` js\nvar MyInput = React.createClass({\n  mixins: [Formsy.Mixin],\n  getInitialState: function () {\n    return {\n      showValidation: false\n    },\n    onInputChange: function (event) {\n      this.setValue(event.target.value);\n    },\n    onInputBlur: function () {\n      this.setState({\n        showValidation: true\n      });\n    },\n    onInputFocus: function () {\n      this.setState({\n        showValidation: false\n      });\n    },\n    render: function () {\n      return (\n        <div>\n          <input onChange={this.onInputChange} value={this.getValue()}/>\n          <div>{this.showError() && this.state.showValidation ? this.getErrorMessage() : null}</div>\n        </div>\n      );\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nWould that make sense?\n\nI do not think it is a good idea to grab value from DOM node as it breaks with the principles of React. The state of the component defines what is in the UI, not the other way around. I am sure we can find a solution for this :-)\n\nLet me know if I misunderstood any needs and we can keep working towards a solution!\n. Hi again!\n\nHm, I am very certain that the DOM should not be the \"source of truth\". The component state should be the \"source of truth\". I can not quite wrap my head around how you get the inputs to go out of sync with the state of the component.\n\nTo solve this I think we need to set up a small project I can run locally to see the problem in context. I am sure there is a \"component state way\" to solve this :-)\n\nI will close this for now since you solved it with a fork and I have not gotten feedback on this from anyone else, but please keep commenting if you want this put into Formsy. Thanks for contributing with the feedback and examples :-)\n. Great! :+1: \n. Hi guys and thanks for the discussion!\n\nWhen React 0.14 is out, with the new context handling I think we could do something like this\n\n``` js\nvar AddressForm = React.createClass({\n[...]\nrender: function(){\n    return (\n        <Formsy.Form {...this.props}>\n             <input name=\"street\"/>\n             <input name=\"zip\"/>\n             <input name=\"city\"/>\n        </Formsy.Form>\n    ); \n}\n});\n\n <Formsy.Form>\n   <input name=\"name\"/>\n   <input name=\"otherProperty\"/>\n   <AddressForm name=\"address\" extended/>\n</Formsy.Form>\n```\n\nSo the idea here is that the extended prop would be passed into the sub Formsy.Form, causing Formsy to return a plain DIV instead of a FORM. That way you could easily include forms in forms. But we depend on the context change to make the sub elements work I believe. I will do some tests tomorrow to verify if current context implementation can make things a bit easier for us.\n\nBut would this useful?\n. Cool, let me put this in on release today. Getting to work now :-)\n. Hi guys,\n\nAre you referring to using other string values? Have now implemented:\n\n``` js\n<input name=\"address.street\"/> => {address: { street: 'value' } }\n```\n\nCan not see any reason to support anything else?\n. This is the code btw:\n\n``` js\nreturn Object.keys(this.model).reduce(function (mappedModel, key) {\n\n  var keyArray = key.split('.');\n  while (keyArray.length) {\n    var currentKey = keyArray.shift();\n    mappedModel[currentKey] = keyArray.length ? mappedModel[currentKey] || {} : this.model[key];\n  }\n\n  return mappedModel;\n\n}.bind(this), {});\n```\n. Just closing it for now as any more complex implementation has to be next version. Want to get new version out today :-)\n. But how could it be an array? `<MyInput name=\"\"/>` is always a string?\n. Sorry, but I do not understand how the name of an input could lead to that structure? As I understand this you want:\n\n``` js\n<Formsy.Form>\n  <MyInput name=\"foo\"/>\n  <MyInput name=\"address.street\"/>\n  <MyInput name=\"address.postCode\"/>\n</Formsy.Form>\n```\n\nWhich leads to this structure:\n\n``` js\n{\n  foo: 'value',\n  address: {\n    street: 'value',\n    postCode: 'value'\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHow would you structure the inputs to give a structure that would require arrays? Sorry for my misunderstanding... but its Friday after all ;-)\n. Please describe \"list support\". I do not understand what a \"list\" is in regards of naming an input? Would be great with an example of html syntax and how that translates to:\n\n``` js\n{nav_items: [{a:b, c:d}, {a:f, c:g}]}\n```\n\nWhat does this form look like?\n. Hi guys,\n\nsorry for late reply. I think it makes sense to conform the name syntax to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` type of data, which is like you describe @chrbala.\n\nTried finding a good lib for this, but there does not seem to exist any? But we can sure build it. So does everybody feel comfortable with:\n\n``` js\n< MyInput name=\"addresses[0][street]\" value=\"Some Street\"/>\n< MyInput name=\"addresses[1][street]\" value=\"Different Street\"/>\n\n{\n    addresses:\n        [{\"street\": \"123 Some Street\"}, \n        {\"street\": \"456 Different Street\"}]\n}\n```\n. Yes, sorry, of course. Copy/paste error :-)\n. me too,heh\n. Okay, this is now implemented, using the separate project: https://github.com/christianalfoni/form-data-to-object. Using it as a hard dependency as it is unlikely you need it for something else... will be part of next release\n. Hi guys!\n\nI was hoping React 0.14 would be right around the corner with its parent-child context. That should solve the issue without any changes.\n\nIt should be possible to fix it with a mixin too. let me try out an implementation so that it will be easy to switch when React 0.14 gets here\n. Hi guys,\n\nI will check out the suggestion as soon as I can and if it does not break anything I will bring it into next release :-) Thanks for taking the time @nathanwelch!\n. React 0.14 is in BETA now, and right around the corner. Implemented with context now, and other fixes. This will be the next release as soon as React 0.14 is released. Sorry for the wait, but this is the best solution (I would say).\n. I suppose this is solved?\n. Thanks for including Formsy, great comparison project btw :-)\n. Totally agree, will fix this for next release tomorrow.\n. Great, thanks :+1: \n. Hi @jcapogna,\n\nThat is an excellent question :-)\n\nI have not tried this, though I believe there are some events you can use? I think onChange will trigger on a normal FileInput\n\n``` js\nvar MyFileInput = React.createClass({\n  onInputChange: function (event) {\n    // Verify that file is correct via the event\n    this.setValue(true);\n    // Or if not valid\n    this.setValue(false);\n  },\n  render: function () {\n    return <input type=\"file\" onChange={this.onInputChange}/>\n  }\n});\n```\n\nAnd then just validate with:\n\n``` js\n<MyFileInput validations=\"isTrue\"/>\n```\n\nYou think that would work?\n. Hi again @jcapogna. I believe you should be able to just store the \"files\" property from the input, instead of its \"value\" property. Check out this article:\n\nhttp://blog.teamtreehouse.com/uploading-files-ajax\n. Closing this, hopefully it worked out :-)\n. Okay, cool, good luck! :-)\n. Hi guys, version will be bumped tomorrow morning :-)\n. This is not taken into account, but should. Might get into tomorrows release or most certainly the next after that :-)\n. Okay, this is now fixed for next release. Both validations and required can be changed at runtime and instantly a new validation check will be run. Thanks for the tip!\n. Hi @alexjg,\n\nJup, from the API documentation:\n\n``` js\n<MyInputComponent \n  name=\"email\" \n  validations={{\n    isEmail: true,\n    maxLength: 50\n  }} \n  validationErrors={{\n    isEmail: 'You have to type valid email',\n    maxLength: 'You can not type in more than 50 characters'\n  }}\n/>\n```\n\nThat solved it?\n. Ah, sorry @alexjg , now I understand.\n\nYes, this should absolutely be in there. It would be great if you created a pull. I am releasing a new version today, but this would indeed be welcomed in the next release!\n. Okay, this is now in for next release. Thanks for contributing!\n. Ah, I know whats wrong. Its the passing of props to to the form element. It seems that a native form also has an onChange. Will revert back to strict control of props passed. Will release fix now :-)\n. Try now\n. Hi guys,\n\nYes, this is indeed something nice to have, though I am unsure that this job is for Formsy. I would expect this scenario has a model with the state of some entity on the server, like a person. The model is presented in a formsy form. Deciding what to pass to the server I think is the responsibility of the model layer, not the UI layer. So you would rather pass the whole form to the model-layer, figure out what is actually necessary to pass to the server and then do that. If Formsy is in control of this you will most likely meet scenarios where Formsy has some logic deciding what to pass to the server, and the model layer might have some of the other logic, maybe Formsy does not do a good enough job and we have to build upon the API to solve lots of different scenarios.\n\nSo yeah, I am concerned about introducing it in Formsy, as this is closer to the model layer than the UI layer I think. It basically drills down to comparing two objects and extracting the diff, which some other lib probably already does  very effectively.\n\nBut please, if you disagree we can discuss it more :-) Just my initial thoughts!\n. Yeah, though it depends on how you implement it. Either Formsy needs to keep track on \"changed values\" or it does a \"diffing\" of initial form values and current values when submitting.\n\nThe last part if the simplest and most effective implementation I would suggest... that said, it is very easy to make yourself. Often libraries like Backbone Model or Angular Resource allows you to do this very easily.\n\nSorry, but I think it is the correct choice to have this logic closer to where you communicate with the server, not inside Formsy. But please, if a lot of people disagree I will of course reconsider.\n. Let me keep this open and we will revisit after next release\n. Hi @davidtinker and thanks for looking into this :-)\n\nI think the best solution is to make the function referenced, instead of creating it each time (inside formsy source code). That way the diff check will not see them as different values and you do not have to do anything about it :-)\n\nI have changed this now, so it should be okay. Let me know if you see something I do not see!\n. Hi guys,\n\nHm, do you have a small code example? Currently the mixin for elements checks if the value of the element has changed, and if so, it will run \"setValue\"... also running the validation. I am a bit unsure where this list state is being used?\n\nChanging \"validations\" prop and \"required\" prop will correctly run a new validation in next release btw.\n. Closing old issue\n. Cool! Will create a new release as soon as I have gotten through all the latest issues :-)\n. Yup, would suggest setting the value on the blur event, instead of the change event. \n\n``` js\nvar Comp = React.createClass({\n  mixins: [Formsy.Mixin],\n  onInputBlur: function (event) {\n    this.setValue(event.target.value);\n  },\n  render: function () {\n    return <input onBlur={this.onInputBlur}/>\n  }\n});\n```\n\nClosing this as it seems to be solved?\n. Got this example from someone too: https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/wiki/validate-on-blur\n\nWhen next release is out we should start the work on some \"default elements\", where this validate on blur input could be one of them :-)\n. Hi @endragor ,\n\nThere are two ways to fix this. Either you make pure versions of DateInput and TimeInput, which is not Formsy related. Then you create a small wrapper for DateInput and TimeInput, which uses the mixin. That leaves you open to create a DateTimeInput, using the pure DateInput and TimeInput and exposing its name: \"dateAndTime\" or whatever which holds both values, date and time... does that make sense?\n\nIn the next version of Formsy the `traverseChildrenAndRegisterInputs` will not be used. It will use context instead, which means that this should probably work.\n\nKeep an eye out for the preview and we can try it out :-)\n. Closing old issue\n. Hi guys!\n\nHm, that kinda sucks. The really good thing about React is that the UI is a reflection of the state in the components, not the other way around. It is also an issue that we do want to know exactly when the inputs are filled, as it should trigger validation...\n\nAnd this seems to be a browser issue, as autofill should trigger a change event. If it does not trigger any event it is impossible for Formsy to run its validations, even though we could grab values from inputs on submit. \n\nhm hm, what a pickle... have to think about this, though it might be better to push the browser vendors to implement this correctly.\n. Well, we could add a property to the form which will check the inputs. Something like `<Formsy.Form autorefill></Formsy.Form>`, which would trigger this manual check of the inputs.\n\nThe problem is that formsy elements are not only typical form inputs, they can be anything really. So a better approach might be to add a method to the mixin: `componentDidMount() { this.checkAutoRefill(this.refs.input) }`. Which of course unregisters on unmount.\n\nWhat do you think?\n. I do, thanks for putting focus on this though :-)\n. Hi there,\n\nThe next version should allow you to do this as it uses context instead of props. I will soon give some information on how to try out the new version which requires React 0.14. Stay tuned :-)\n. Check out this issue: https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/issues/158 :-)\n. Hi there!\n\nYou can solve this by manually submitting the form :-)\n\nQuick example:\n\n``` js\nonSubmit: function (model) {\n  if (this.state.typeOfSubmit === 'oneOfThem') {\n    // doe something\n  }\n},\nsubmit1: function () {\n  this.setState({\n    typeOfSubmit: 'oneOfThem'\n  }, this.refs.form.submit);\n},\nsubmit2: function () {\n  this.setState({\n    typeOfSubmit: 'theOther'\n  }, this.refs.form.submit);\n},\nrender: function () {\n  return (\n    <Formsy.Form onSubmit={this.onSubmit} ref=\"form\">\n      <button onClick={this.submit1}>Submit1</button>\n      <button onClick={this.submit2}>Submit2</button>\n    </Formsy.Form>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nWould that work for you?\n. @aphillipo Yeah, I see your point on it being automatic :-) But I think the stability of Formsy is due to all these \"special scenarios\" not being implemented, rather have good enough hooks to solve anything. There are so many suggestions and if all of them were implemented it would be very hard to document it all and keeping it stable :-)\n\nThanks for the feedback!\n. Hi there!\n\nThis seems strange. Could you try to just put your error out in a separate element? Just to make sure that it is not material-ui making any problems? Also try with a different validation rule. \n. Closing old issue\n. Hi guys!\n\nThis is a very typical question, \"why required?\". The thing is that indicating if something is required is different than indicating validation. For example an empty input that validates as email is not invalid because it it empty, but it is invalid if it also is required :-) Confusing, yes, but let me try this:\n\nRequired defines what a missing value is, (no text, is false, is undefined etc.) and invalidates the input as \"missing value\" when that occurs.\n\nValidations defines what values are valid, WHEN there is value in the input.  \n\nIt is really difficult to express this in a good way :-)\n. Adding a \"validateOnSubmit\" prop to the form is a good idea. My personal opinion is that users hate filling out a complete form and submit just to get an error in their face and figure out where it happened. Its better to notify at once... or on blur. But yeah, have to get new version out first, but lets keep this open :)\n. @idream3 Its because a formsy element can be any kind of input. Lets say you have an element that is a list and you want it to be required, which is when the length of the value is 0 :-) You need `required=\"hasLength\"` or something. Does that make sense?\n\nBut this feature is at the top of the priority list now, so it will be implemented very soon.\n\n@silvenon Great tip on the debounce thingy, never thought of that :-) \n. Hi guys!\n\nI got a really interesting suggestion on a different issue. You should easily be able to achieve \"validate on submit\" by just adding a class to the form. This class hides all validation messages. When you hit submit, you remove the class and any validation errors is now displayed.\n\nDoes this solve the issue?\n. Awesome, thanks @Semigradsky . Really struggling with getting time to work on formsy, but got vacation now and will create a new release that supports React 0.14. So will work using the BETA, fix the nesting stuff of components and go through all issues to fix bugs.\n\nI think you are doing a great job replying and working on the project. Would you like to get more involved? Actually, I am proposing that you take the lead of the project. I will of course still be involved, but I think the project would be better of having you as lead on the project :-)\n\nI completely understand if you do not have time, but though I could suggest it\n. That is great! :-) Let me just wrap up the next React 0.14 version and clean things up for you in the issues etc. Then I will announce with the next release. Again, I am still around, so please do not hesitate to contact me to discuss things etc., but feel completely free to do whatever you want. I have faith in you ;-)\n. Hi @ericdfields and thanks for looking into this! In the next version Formsy stops messing around with the children and will use \"react context\" instead. That will fix the issue :-)\n. Hi there,\n\nFormsy is built for flexibility. There are so many different ways of handling a form and to support most of them Formsy has a lot of hooks. Initially Formsy did support posting data directly to the server and handle any errors, but the implementation was too specific. There were so many requests on support of headers, map errors from server etc. It just got way out of control. So instead of having one very opinionated implementation of talking to the server, it has an extremely flexible hook that lets you do it exactly as you want to.\n\nSo I am sorry to say that this will not be implemented... and I can not really see that this is a problem?:\n\n``` js\nsendData(form, reset, invalidate) {\n  myAjaxLib.post('/form', form)\n    .success(this.doWhatever)\n    .error(invalidate);\n},\nrender() {\n  return <Formsy.Form onSubmit={this.sendData}/>\n}\n```\n\nSorry to be such a dick about it ;-)\n. Hi @garbin , great! Thanks. Working on a new version of formsy now, going through all open issues and adding support for React 0.14, adding support for the new parent-child context relationship\n. Hi!\n\nYeah, @rblakeley, please set up a new issue on that. Currently it just builds objects by splitting on `.`. It was implemented like this based on a discussion, but lets review it :-)\n. Hi guys,\n\nYes, the fix is not part of the current release, but the next one. It is right around the corner :-)\n. Hi, yeah, I agree... lets make this part of next release. \n. Okay, got Mixin, HOC and Decorator in the new branch now. Using a traditional approach from other projects.\n. Hi guys!\n\n@twisty thanks so much for taking the time to test! \n\n@Semigradsky Great work, we are closing in on release :-)\n\n**NOTE!** to get the latest version of master in the TEST-project, run `npm install --force`\n. @Semigradsky Maybe create a couple of tests for these errors messages, I was not in the mood for it when I implemented... you know how it is ;-)\n. @richardaday , jup it does :-)\n. Hi there!\n\nAs soon as React 0.14 is released it will be released :-) The code is ready, working with React 0.14 Beta 1\n. Decorators will be part of next release :-)\n. Hm, I did not quite understand what you mean @eriknyk? \n. New version out\n. Will close this as it is fixed in new version coming soon, thanks for the feedback @ajaykurien :-)\n. Release Candidate out now on React, right around the corner :-) Took a bit longer than I thought, but now it is really close!\n. It seems that this is solved? Closing it, thanks for suggestions and hope you got it fixed @sloria!\n. Hi there,\n\nThe `required` prop can take a validation value, just like `validations`. This is to define what validation rule should define the input as required. By default that is `required`, `required={true}` and `required=\"isDefaultRequiredValue\"`. They are the same and checks if the value is undefined or an empty string. But you can change this to f.ex. `required=\"isFalse\"`. If the value now becomes `false` it will be indicated as required. Good for a checkbox the is required to be checked.\n\nDoes that make sense? validations and required is hard to express in a good way :-/\n. Closing this as it does work, reopen if still having problems\n. Hi guys,\n\nThere has been a bit confusion on how required is being used and it will be cleaned up after next release of Formsy.\n\nThe prop `validations` uses validation rules to set errors. The prop `required` can also use validation rules to indicate when an input should be required.\n\nSo:\n\n``` js\n// When the value of the input is `false`, showRequired() will give true\n<MyInput name=\"some_field\" type=\"text\" required=\"isFalse\">\n\n// When the value of the input is falsy (empty string etc), showRequired() will give true\n<MyInput name=\"some_field\" type=\"text\" required>\n\n// showRequired() will always be false \n<MyInput name=\"some_field\" type=\"text\">\n```\n\nSo what we need to clean up here is maybe use a new property. Just throwing it out there:\n\n``` js\n<MyInput name=\"some_field\" type=\"text\" required={true/false} requiredRule=\"isFalse\">\n```\n\nBut yeah, I hope this explained how it works now.\n. Hi @eventhough, yeah, I think you might be right about this. Just to summarize with my own words here.\n\n<MyInput value={someValue}/>\n\nWhenever \"someValue\" changes that should become the new pristine value of \"MyInput\". Whenever \"MyInput\" uses \"setValue\" that will of course not become the new pristine value.\n\nWould love some comments on this, @Semigradsky, @idream3?\n. Hm, I have been thinking a bit more on this. Like a plain input you might want to pass the changes through your application state store. Typically `onChange` on an input and `value={this.state.value}`. With Formsy, in combination with f.ex. Cerebral:\n\n``` js\n@Cerebral({\n  form: ['form']\n})\nclass MyForm extends React.Component {\n  onFormChange(data) {\n    this.props.signals.formChanged({form: data});\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <Formsy.Form onChange={(data) => this.onFormChange(data)}>\n        <MyInput name=\"foo\" value={this.props.form.foo}/>\n      </Formsy.Form>\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis is a typical setup for creating \"application state\". The problem with implementing what is suggested here is that the value prop will change on every change of the form. So it will always be a pristine value.\n\nThis is the difficult balance of internal/external state handling. I think it is important to let developers control the form from some external state store, without messing up the pristine stuff. Maybe we should rather have a `pristineValue` or `defaultValue`? That way you can control it however you like?\n. Will add `defaultValue` in next release, it just gives a lot more control. Let me know if this is a problem\n. You actually have access to all the elements of the form through the formsy.form component. You could go through those instead of wrapping. So:\n\n``` js\nvar MyForm = React.createClass({\n  mixins: [Formsy.Mixin],\n  showErrors: function () {\n    this.refs.form.inputs // All components registered to form. Check their state prop etc.\n  },\n  render: function () {\n    <Formsy.Form ref=\"form\" onInvalidSubmit={this.showErrors}/>\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThough it would be good to get this info directly. So maybe \"onInvalidSubmit\" and \"onInvalid\" hooks should pass an object with elements and their error messages. What do you think?\n. Will make part of next release :-)\n. @Semigradsky I was thinking about adding a \"ELEMENT EXAMPLES\" next to \"HOW TO USE\". Just lots of different examples of how to write different kinds of elements. You up for starting on that? :-)\n. Hm, could you give a code example that breaks? Just have to understand exactly where the problem is :-)\n. Old issue\n. Hi there!\n\nThanks for the heads up! What is the exact syntax where you get this error? \n. Formsy is just a normal element, `<Formsy.Form/>`, Higher Order Components and Decorator version of the elements you build for the form will arrive in next version :-)\n. I believe this is the same as #147 ?\n\nIt depends on the user experience here. Normally you would not allow a submit when any of the elements are invalid. So in the component with your Formsy form you use `onValid` and `onInvalid` to track when the submit button actually can be pressed.\n\nBut the issue mentioned here is about allowing validations to run only when submitting, not as you change the value of the inputs. Would that work for you?\n. Hi, thanks for a great example!\n\nAnd yeah, this can be solved by just having an error class on the form and toggle it when actually hitting the \"submit\" button. So the validation is happening \"under the hood\", but the class decides to display them or not.\n\nSo yeah, will not implement new logic for this as it can be solved with current hooks!\n. It will be 0.14.x on next release, but thanks for the heads up :-)\n. Eyh, nice, thanks :-)\n. Sorry for very late reply, but this is great, thanks! :-)\n. Hehe, I think this is right. You state what rule it needs to match to indicate that it is required. And that is when it is \"isFalse\", when checkbox is unchecked... but \"required to be checked\" is the opposite, so yeah, correct :-) Ah, validation is hard! :-D\n. You can do async validation if you run your own validation. If you use the following hooks, as an example:\n\n``` js\nvar validate = function (values, reset, invalidate) {\n // Check the values of the form and do your async validation, then\n// run the invalidate function to invalidate the form\n};\n\n<Formsy.Form onSubmit={validate}>\n// Your elements\n</Formsy.Form>\n```\n\nI am very unsure how Formsy would handle this internally, as those validations run as values change. Not good user experience. I suppose you want to run it on submit? So yeah, I would solve it with the code above :-)\n\nLet us know if that does not work for you, but it would be nice with a use case to assist you better\n. This still has to be done using existing hooks. Async validation is way too complex for Formsy to handle internally I believe. There are just so many ways to handle it, so it is better to have some hooks that manages it exactly like you want. Added example here to wiki. \n\nLet me know if there are specific scenarios and we can take a look at them?\n. ah, can not see any problem with having this in there, thanks!\n. Hi there @jaraquistain,\n\nAre you passing `null` as the value to the input? You have some snippets, just to make sure I understand this correctly\n. Hi @rodryquintero, in what way is it jerky? :-) I think it would be better to fix that as it is more \"future proof\" in regards of accessing child components in React.\n. Hi again,\n\nHm, what did you put inside the onChange handler? diffing two shallow objects should not cause jerkyness. I have this feeling there is something special happening inside the `onChange` handler in this specific scenario. Calling a function vs accessing an object should not have any noticeable performance issues\n. Ah, yes, its important to give key values so that React can identify them \"as the same component\". Please elaborate if you think I misunderstand something, but yeah, my interpretation is that this is a React issue :)\n. Eyh, this is really great!\n\nThere are so many different ways to handle stuff so Formsy tries to give all the hooks needed to do whatever you want. That said, sometimes it can be very verbose.\n\nI will add this code example to the WIKI first. It might be better to have this stuff as addon components rather than properties/options inside Formsy. So lets keep this and figure out where it fits best.\n. Closing this, please reopen if still a problem\n. Hi guys!\n\nYes, this is something that has been requested before too. \n\nAdding it to list for next release: https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/issues/206\n. Makes sense, let me add it to next release, https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/issues/206\n. Hi @wwsun Yes, it is because you validate asynchronously, which does not work. It will not be part of the API as it is a very complex operation that devs want to handle very differently. You have to move this logic outside the form.\n\n``` js\nvar nameBeingValidated = null;\nvar onSubmit = function (data, reset, invalidate) {\n  if (data.name && nameBeingValidated !== data.name) {\n    // Validate name on server\n    // If not valid\n   invalidate({name: 'That name is not valid');\n  }\n};\n<Formsy.Form onSubmit={onSubmit}>\n  <MyInput name=\"name\">\n</Formsy.Form>\n```\n\nSimple example, I hope it makes sense\n. Hi guys,\n\nSo sorry for my wrong example. Yes, you would do this on the submit.\n. Let me know if is needed to discuss this more!\n. Thanks for this, fixed now :-)\n. I believe you are calling the method incorrectly. Using `class` syntax? Make sure you bind the method to the component :-)\n\n``` js\n  <div onClick={this.changeValue.bind(this)}/>\n```\n. @EthanML , you can access it by using \"ref\" on the form elements and dive into the component, but that is not really the way to go :-)\n\nIf you give some more context to the challenge I am sure we can figure out a good way to handle this!\n. Added to list: https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/issues/206\n. When next version is released I will start working on `formsy-addons` which will have different types of form elements that handles complex validation and I think this fits in! Sounds okay?\n\nSomething like:\n\n``` js\nimport FormsyComponent from 'formsy-react-addons/Component';\n```\n. Awesome stuff, thanks! Hopefully we are right around the corner for React 0.14 and can officially release :-)\n. You know how that works? Trying to find some documentation. Thought I could just checkout the branch and publish it with `--tag beta`?\n. Hm, for some reason it states that I can not publish over the previous version. Maybe I still have to give it a new version number, but using --tag beta it will not be installed by default?\n. ah, yes, there we go:\n\n`npm install formsy-react@beta` :-)\n. Would be great if you could confirm that everything works as expected, and especially if not :-)\n. No worries, thanks for following it up :-)\n. let me update and release new package\n. Okay, try now :)\n. Hi @blittle,\n\nThanks for this. Yes, I am going through the tests for next release. New version of node etc. have to fix it :-)\n. Hm, yes, this is interesting. The state should be reset with the `this.updateModel();`, but have to test it more closely. I see you removed it on a commit to your fork? Any reason for that? I can not see how that could fix the issue... did it? :-)\n\nLet me know and I will put this on the block\n. Aha, I see you fixed it :-) This makes sense, thanks!\n. Maybe add link to README? :-)\n\nJust closing this...\n. Just bring in everything. Tests has to be cleaned. New version of Node etc.\n. Everything except validate on submit is now part of it. Validate on submit can still be used by having a className on the form that you flip on when submitting the first time. By default validations are just hidden\n. Hi guys,\n\nI am bringing branch React 0.14 into master this weekend and releasing new version. There are so many people using new version of React RC so I do not see any reason to wait.\n\nAll fixes will be included in this new release. \n. If I understand you correctly you can add a validation rule here:\n\nhttps://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/API.md#formsyaddvalidationrule\n\nIf you create a function that takes a value and validates it you could call that function from Formsy `addValidationRule` and reuse the same function on the server. Does that make sense?\n. There will be a `defaultValue` prop in next version. It is related to how pristine values are handled, though conceptually I think it will help with your scenario too :-)\n. `defaultValue` not in yet, preparing it for next version :-)\n. Ah, thanks, and thanks for your feedback :-)\n. Great, thanks! :-)\n. 0.16 out now :-)\n. Perfect, thanks :-)\n. Great stuff, thanks a lot :-)\n. Great it worked out @salayev .\n\nWhen next version of Formsy is released it will have a review as there has been many changes since its release. The though it to build a suggested spec for 1.0 version where APIs and how the internal state of the component will be perfected.\n. Hi @salayev ,\n\nValidation vs required is a surprisingly difficult concept. `validations` is related to `showError()` and `getErrorMessages()`. `required` is related to `showRequired()`. So you never check errors related to required. The reason is that they are two different things. You want to indicate a required input differently than when a validation is wrong :-)\n- validations prop => showError() / getErrorMessages()\n- required prop => showRequired()\n. I think you have to give us some more details than that :-)\n. Jup, agreed, https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/issues/206\n. Great, thanks!\n\nNew version will be released this weekend, with latest version of React 0.14\n. Thanks for the heads up! https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/issues/206\n. Great thanks! :-)\n. Ah, must have been a merge issue here, sorry about that!\n. ",

    "aesopwolf": "This almost works. The problem is that the defaultValue (value?) doesn't get loaded on first page load. For example, this code block:\n\n``` jsx\n'use strict';\n\nvar React = require('react');\nvar Formsy = require('formsy-react');\n\nvar Input = React.createClass({\n    mixins: [Formsy.Mixin],\n    changeValue: function(event) {\n        this.setValue(event.currentTarget.value || this.props.defaultValue);\n    },\n    componentWillReceiveProps: function (nextProps) {\n        // Only change to the new default value if it is currently showing the old one\n        if (this.getValue() === this.props.defaultValue && nextProps.defaultValue !== this.props.defaultValue) {\n            this.setValue(nextProps.defaultValue);\n        }\n    },\n    render: function() {\n        var className = this.showRequired() ? 'required' : this.showError() ? 'error' : null;\n        var errorMessage = this.getErrorMessage();\n\n        return (\n            <div className={className}>\n                <input type=\"text\" value={this.getValue()} onChange={this.changeValue} />\n            </div>\n        );\n    }\n});\n\nmodule.exports = Input;\n\n```\n\nand this component...\n\n``` jsx\n<Formsy.Form url=\"/users\" onSuccess={this.changeUrl} onValid={this.enableButton} onInvalid={this.disableButton}>\n  <Form.Input name=\"firstName\" required defaultValue={this.state.profile.first}/>\n  <button type=\"submit\" disabled={!this.state.canSubmit}>Submit</button>\n</Formsy.Form>\n```\n\nWill load an input element with an empty value. However, by entering value AND THEN deleting it will the defaultValue appear in the input. Here's a .gif:\n\n![out](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6847633/5991027/0871470a-a987-11e4-833f-993719aab4fb.gif)\n\nI think the reason for this behavior might be because `nextProps.defaultValue` is undefined on the first  load. I guess it's because `componentWillReceiveProps` is not called on the initial render. Any suggestions on what to do here? \n. Thanks for the quick reply! You indeed understood the problem correctly :)\n\nI tried both methods you suggested, but ran into the same problem as @srconklin, which is that these methods only seem to work with hardcoded strings, and not from the react state `{this.state.profile.first}`\n. Actually, on second hand... My problem might not be related to formsy, and instead an issue of the way `{this.state.profile.first}` is being set. It's an async api call to a server that's happening in a mixin. So that's why it's `undefined` here:\n\n``` jsx\ncomponentWillMount: function() {\n    console.log(this.props.defaultValue); // undefined?\n    this.setValue(this.props.defaultValue);\n},\n```\n\nDo you think that sounds right?\n. @christianalfoni sorry for my amateur hour from before... I got it figured it out! But I'm back to the endless loop.\n\n@srconklin did you figure out how to avoid the endless loop? \n\nI'm thinking a new method `setValueNoValidate` might be needed for the `componentWillReceiveProps` method that does just as it says, it sets the value but doesn't validate it. Thus preventing an endless loop, maybe? \n\nObviously this wouldn't be good for data that needs to be validated as soon as it loaded, but if it's coming from the server you can probably safely assume it's already validated. \n\nWhat do you guys think?\n. Oh! That's good news. I tried it out, and I don't get the endless loop anymore! However, I still have one more problem.\n\nThis code will work fine: \n\n``` jsx\n<Formsy.Form url=\"/users\" onSuccess={this.changeUrl} onValid={this.enableButton} onInvalid={this.disableButton}>\n  <MyOwnInput name=\"email\" value={this.state.profile.email} />\n  <button type=\"submit\" disabled={!this.state.canSubmit}>Submit</button>\n</Formsy.Form>\n```\n\nBut as soon as I put any validations on it:\n\n``` jsx\n<Formsy.Form url=\"/users\" onSuccess={this.changeUrl} onValid={this.enableButton} onInvalid={this.disableButton}>\n  <MyOwnInput name=\"email\" value={this.state.profile.email} validations=\"isEmail\" validationError=\"This is not a valid email\" required/>\n  <button type=\"submit\" disabled={!this.state.canSubmit}>Submit</button>\n</Formsy.Form>\n```\n\nThen it will throw the error `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'match' of undefined` in the console. This could probably be fixed in the validationRules with a check to make sure the `value` argument is defined. \n\n``` jsx\n'isEmail': function (value) {\n  // do a check for `value` first, otherwise the next line throws an error since `value` is sometimes undefined (like on first page load)\n  return value.match(/^((([a-z]|\\d|[!#\\$%&'\\*\\+\\-\\/=\\?\\^_`{\\|}~]...\n}\n```\n\n## \n\nAlso, to double check. When building my form element, should `componentWillRecieveProps` be as simple as this?:\n\n``` jsx\ncomponentWillReceiveProps: function (nextProps) {\n    this.setValue(nextProps.value);\n},\n```\n. Gotcha. I had assumed that was just a second option, not the required way. Thanks for clearing it up!\n. `disabled={false}` doesn't make any sense, try `disabled={true}`. Unfortunately, I'm not able to update to React 0.13.x (at least at the moment).\n\nIn the mean time I've added my own `addValidationRule` that takes care of my use case. I'm okay with this solution. So if you want to close this feel free! Thanks\n. @IanVS yes, closing this.. Just merged and published @wuct 's fix\r\n\r\nIt's available on npm under `v0.19.1` https://www.npmjs.com/package/formsy-react. I had to revert the original pull request that @wuct created. I published the reversion under `v0.19.2`. \r\n\r\nIt was a breaking change for existing components. I really should've released it as 1.0.\r\n\r\nI've setup a [1.0 milestone](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/milestone/1) that will re-release a fix for this (might still use https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/pull/386 but will have to update all of the docs/examples and also need to account for [forms that are disabled until inputs are valid](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/commit/57f97cb0459a539c0533e305dbd1bfd85ad1a02f#commitcomment-20585717)). Looks good to me, any reason this hasn't been merged in yet?. @mikaelengstrom looks like this PR is outdated. Since it's so small, please feel free to recreate this PR. It will probably be easier/faster than having @gabrielboucher update this branch.. @SaitejaP I would recommend trying @keul's solution. It's what I use myself.. Thanks @tjcampbell for suggesting the idea of implementing `getInstance()`. I just submitted a PR that does exactly that. Feel free to chime in / do a peer review on https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/pull/399\n. When using your component you should provide a `value` attribute to suppress the React warning about \"elements should not switch from uncontrolled to controlled \". For example:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<MyInput value=\"\" name=\"password\" title=\"Password\" type=\"password\" required />\r\n```. I'm in favor of moving to the @dperini regex. We can hardcode, but I'd also be okay with pulling in https://github.com/kevva/url-regex. Mainly since it seems that there are occasional updates to the regex itself. So it's nice to have a repo that keeps up to date with the original [gist](https://gist.github.com/dperini/729294) and runs unit tests.. @cgood92 while it's possible to get a list of all the validation errors in user-land, it would still be nice to have this built into Formsy.\r\n\r\nWe currently have [`getModel`](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/API.md#getmodel), but I would like to see either a new method, maybe `getExtendedModel`, or just an argument passed to `getModel` that would return extra meta data about each input, which would obviously include validation status.\r\n\r\nSo yes, it's 'on the roadmap', but the priority isn't super high. I'll gladly accept a PR for it though!. @keown Sorry, formsy requires you to write custom components. Have you looked through the examples or read the README? I'm going to close this since this isn't an issue with formsy itself. This type of question would be better suited for stackoverflow.\r\n\r\n. The current validator is a beastly regex:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n  isUrl: function (values, value) {\r\n    return validations.matchRegexp(values, value, /^(https?|s?ftp):\\/\\/(((([a-z]|\\d|-|\\.|_|~|[\\u00A0-\\uD7FF\\uF900-\\uFDCF\\uFDF0-\\uFFEF])|(%[\\da-f]{2})|[!\\$&'\\(\\)\\*\\+,;=]|:)*@)?(((\\d|[1-9]\\d|1\\d\\d|2[0-4]\\d|25[0-5])\\.(\\d|[1-9]\\d|1\\d\\d|2[0-4]\\d|25[0-5])\\.(\\d|[1-9]\\d|1\\d\\d|2[0-4]\\d|25[0-5])\\.(\\d|[1-9]\\d|1\\d\\d|2[0-4]\\d|25[0-5]))|((([a-z]|\\d|[\\u00A0-\\uD7FF\\uF900-\\uFDCF\\uFDF0-\\uFFEF])|(([a-z]|\\d|[\\u00A0-\\uD7FF\\uF900-\\uFDCF\\uFDF0-\\uFFEF])([a-z]|\\d|-|\\.|_|~|[\\u00A0-\\uD7FF\\uF900-\\uFDCF\\uFDF0-\\uFFEF])*([a-z]|\\d|[\\u00A0-\\uD7FF\\uF900-\\uFDCF\\uFDF0-\\uFFEF])))\\.)+(([a-z]|[\\u00A0-\\uD7FF\\uF900-\\uFDCF\\uFDF0-\\uFFEF])|(([a-z]|[\\u00A0-\\uD7FF\\uF900-\\uFDCF\\uFDF0-\\uFFEF])([a-z]|\\d|-|\\.|_|~|[\\u00A0-\\uD7FF\\uF900-\\uFDCF\\uFDF0-\\uFFEF])*([a-z]|[\\u00A0-\\uD7FF\\uF900-\\uFDCF\\uFDF0-\\uFFEF])))\\.?)(:\\d*)?)(\\/((([a-z]|\\d|-|\\.|_|~|[\\u00A0-\\uD7FF\\uF900-\\uFDCF\\uFDF0-\\uFFEF])|(%[\\da-f]{2})|[!\\$&'\\(\\)\\*\\+,;=]|:|@)+(\\/(([a-z]|\\d|-|\\.|_|~|[\\u00A0-\\uD7FF\\uF900-\\uFDCF\\uFDF0-\\uFFEF])|(%[\\da-f]{2})|[!\\$&'\\(\\)\\*\\+,;=]|:|@)*)*)?)?(\\?((([a-z]|\\d|-|\\.|_|~|[\\u00A0-\\uD7FF\\uF900-\\uFDCF\\uFDF0-\\uFFEF])|(%[\\da-f]{2})|[!\\$&'\\(\\)\\*\\+,;=]|:|@)|[\\uE000-\\uF8FF]|\\/|\\?)*)?(#((([a-z]|\\d|-|\\.|_|~|[\\u00A0-\\uD7FF\\uF900-\\uFDCF\\uFDF0-\\uFFEF])|(%[\\da-f]{2})|[!\\$&'\\(\\)\\*\\+,;=]|:|@)|\\/|\\?)*)?$/i);\r\n  },\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I'd rather not touch it. Fortunately, you can actually add your own [custom validation rules ](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/API.md#formsyaddvalidationrulename-rulefunc). Here's one you can add to your own project:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nFormsy.addValidationRule('isLocalUrl', function (values, value) {\r\n  return (/^(http:\\/\\/)?localhost$|^127(?:\\.[0-9]+){0,2}\\.[0-9]+$|^(?:0*:)*?:?0*1$/gi.test(value));\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nI based it off this [stackoverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/8426365/785557). Thanks @wuct, just published `v0.19.1` with this in it https://www.npmjs.com/package/formsy-react.

Are you guys using `getValue()` on your custom input element?\r\n\r\n> [You should always use the getValue() method inside your formsy form element.](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/API.md#value). @brianfegan and @prasanna1211 would you mind providing sample code? In my experience `reset` works fine but only when you use `getValue()` in your component.. @brianfegan as the `value` attribute itself https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/examples/components/Input.js#L35\r\n\r\nTry updating your component to use `getValue` and let me know how it goes.. @brianfegan Yeah you really should be using `getValue`. Would you mind setting up a demo repo of the problem you're facing?. pinging @christianalfoni do you need additional maintainers for this project?\n. I came across a different approach that might be slightly better, which is to pass a prop called `innerRef` that takes a function just like the normal `ref` prop. A full example can be seen here https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/122\n\nWhat do you think @christianalfoni?\n. @Semigradsky are you able to chime in here and help approve this?\n. No movement. I haven't heard anything from the maintainers since opening the PR. They seem to have abandoned the project.\n\nI'm debating forking it and getting a majority of the other PR's merged in as well.\n\n> On Nov 23, 2016, at 3:49 PM, Brian Fegan <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n> \n> Is there any movement on this?

I pulled the trigger and forked the repo. I published it to npm under `formsy` (can't believe it was available!). I also merged in this PR to the new fork.\r\n\r\nYou can check it out here:\r\n\r\n- https://www.npmjs.com/package/formsy\r\n- https://github.com/aesopwolf/formsy\r\n\r\nI think I'll make an issue to advertise the new fork and it's location.. I was given write access to the repo (see https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/issues/411). So I'm going to reopen this PR and get it merged in.. @acomito You're correct, you can't access `this.refs` inside the render function.\r\n\r\nHiding/showing form fields based on another fields current value really varies depending on your situation. Would you mind pasting some code? If not, then I would suggest using setting up an `onChange` handler for your `<Formsy.Form>`, for example:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nformChangeHandler(model) {\r\n  if(model.employmentStatus === 'Full time') {\r\n    this.setState({askForEmployerName: true});\r\n  } else {\r\n    this.setState({askForEmployerName: false});\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you can hide/show the \"Employer Name\" input in your form based on `this.state.askForEmployerName`.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this as is since it's not actual issue with formsy, but we can still continue the discussion.. @you-fail-me is your custom input component using `getValue()`?. @you-fail-me Try updating your component to use `getValue()`. It should fix your problem\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/API.md#value. Thanks. Not sure if it makes sense for PR's to commit release files though. I think `npm run deploy` should be something we run when we're ready to deploy a new version. So, after x new features or every x weeks.\r\n\r\nPlus it seems like a pain for contributors to have to go through.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts? (I was just made a collaborator on the project and you seem to have some previous contributions so I'd like to get your feedback \ud83d\ude42). Ah that's a good point about being able to use your fork, I didn't think of that. I guess we can leave the release files as 'optional' for PRs.\r\n\r\nI'll go ahead and merge this as is.. This is a really good point, thanks for bringing it up. I've struggled with something similar when I wanted to allow emoji characters.\r\n\r\nI think this can probably be solved in user land. We [expose a validator](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/API.md#validators) called `matchRegexp`. And since the [xregexp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xregexp) library on npm advertises that it compiles to native RegExp objects then in theory you can just pass pass the compiled regular expression to `matchRegexp`.\r\n\r\nLet me know if that works for you or not.. I just gave it a quick test and it worked as expected! Didn't have to do anything special. For example:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<InputGroup\r\n  name=\"emoji\"\r\n  label=\"emoji\"\r\n  type=\"text\"\r\n  validations={{\r\n    matchRegexp: XRegExp('^\\\\pS$', 'A'), // https://github.com/slevithan/xregexp#unicode\r\n  }}\r\n  validationError=\"Please enter an emoji\"\r\n/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'll leave this open for now and close it once I add a note to our documentation.. Docs updated https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/API.md#validators. We probably won't merge anything in using `Promise` for awhile. Browser support is definitely getting better but IE still doesn't provide support. See https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/issues/70 for a previous discussion.. Have you looked into [`updateInputsWithError(errors)`](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/API.md#updateinputswitherrorerrors)? I have a feeling that might solve your use case.. No worries, this was actually an earlier issue https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/issues/371\r\n\r\nLong story short you need to ask https://github.com/mbrookes/formsy-material-ui to update their formsy-react dependency to v0.18.1. @Casy Are you using `formsy-material-ui`?. Ah, well their latest version hasn't updated to `formsy-react@0.18.1`, you see they [are still on 0.18.0](https://github.com/mbrookes/formsy-material-ui/blob/master/package.json#L25). Update: I sent an email to the original maintainer and he made me a Collaborator on the project. Thanks @christianalfoni \ud83d\ude00\r\n\r\nI'll be able to help close issues, merge PR's and even publish to npm. Do you have a full repo where I can reproduce the bug? This is kind of hard to debug based just on the code samples.. Thanks for the PR \ud83d\ude03\r\n\r\nWould you mind describing the problem more clearly when you say nested data? Did you have nested form elements? I'm not even sure that's allowed/possible. If you could provide some sample code that would be great.\r\n\r\nAlso, it looks like one of the tests is failing.. Thanks for the sample code. This is a situation that should be solved in user-land then. Just import `form-data-to-object` into your app and call:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nthis.refs.form.reset(formDataToObject(newProps.model));\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut really, I would suggest naming your inputs something more friendly, like so:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<Input name=\"_id\" value={null} type='hidden'/>\r\n<Input name=\"identifier\" label=\"National ID\" required/>\r\n<Checkbox name=\"active\" label=\"active?\" value={false}/>\r\n<Input name=\"name\" label=\"Patient's Name\" required/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then you can normalize your reset data to look like this:\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  _id: 123,\r\n  identifier: 'abc'\r\n  active: 'checked',\r\n  name: 'John Doe'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this since it's not something that should be in the core library. We appreciate the PR though!. Thanks for catching this. @lennardschutter what version of formsy-react are you on? If things were working correctly before and suddenly changed it was probably due to the 0.19.1 release. See the discussion here https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/commit/57f97cb0459a539c0533e305dbd1bfd85ad1a02f\r\n\r\nIn short, you can use `isFormSubmitted()` to conditionally show your errors.. Might be worth using 0.19.1 then and conditionally showing your errors by using `isFormSubmitted()`.\r\n\r\nThe validations will run but you will only display the errors if the form has been submitted.\r\n\r\nOr I might be reading your issue wrong. What do you mean by \"from a partial save\"?. Never mind my comment about 0.19.1, we actually just issued a rollback of that version. (long story).\r\n\r\nBack to your issue... Would you mind copy/pasting your Formsy.Form component and also your custom form element (just one should be enough)? It will help me a lot to debug this.. Hmm, that looks like it will work. Mind giving me a little bit to think about it? I might want to wait for the [1.0.0 release](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/milestone/1) to expose the new method.. @alexhawkins thanks for opening the issue. Would you mind taking a look at the discussion [here](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/commit/57f97cb0459a539c0533e305dbd1bfd85ad1a02f)\r\n\r\nEven if we rollback we're still contemplating re-releasing the breaking change in the next `0.20.x` release. So, it would be best practice for you to version lock your dependencies in production (especially for pre 1.0 releases).\r\n\r\nAnyways, we will probably roll back before the end of the day. But it would be nice if you added your input at the above link just to help move forward.\r\n\r\nThanks, and sorry for pushing the breaking change.. What's the use case here? Maybe we should just extend `reset` instead of introducing a new method?. This looks fine, but I'm hesitant to expose new methods. What's the use case here? Any reason `resetValue` doesn't suffice?. First glance this looks fine. Ideally we will rewrite all the docs (and source) to use ES6 classes and High Order Components though. https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/issues/395\r\n\r\nI'll wait a week (maybe 2?) before merging this. Hopefully myself, or someone else can create a PR to fully deprecate createClass/createReactClass. @ottis and @drewlustro are you guys on the latest version? `v0.19.5`?. This is amazing. Since this kills the decorator we should bump the version to 1.0.0. Thoughts?. Thanks for this. I started testing the beta branch this morning. I'll open a PR with a few tweaks of my own and let you review, then if all is good we can publish v1. @track0x1 I'm running into a problem with the reset-values example. Would you mind taking a look at it? Just run `yarn examples`, open up `http://localhost:8080/reset-values/index.html` and click the \"Reset\" button -- I can't figure out why the checkbox disappears. I've been trying to debug this for 2 days. \r\n\r\nI'm thinking about using \"defaultChecked\" in `Checkbox.js` but will need to wait for react v15.6.2 since there's [a bug at the moment](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9988). Wow... I have no words. Thank you so much. I was going crazy.. It's been a while since I've touched this. I'm just going to merge it in to the beta branch as is and open up more PR's as need be.. I've been debating forking this repo to it's own organization so that I can easily add more owners.\r\n\r\n@track0x1 would you be interested in being added as an owner?. I thought I had the time to help bring this project back to life, but I haven't be able to help out nearly as much as I thought I could.\r\n\r\nI just gave @maccuaa, @track0x1, @twisty, and @sdemjanenko access to the npm project. (You were just the first people that came to mind).\r\n\r\nLastly, this project should be converted to a github org, preferably https://github.com/formsy (but that's currently taken). So maybe https://github.com/formsy-react for the time being, @rkuykendall do you want to set that up? You could then invite those 4 people I mentioned above to be owners on the github org.. This almost works. The problem is that the defaultValue (value?) doesn't get loaded on first page load. For example, this code block:\n\n``` jsx\n'use strict';\n\nvar React = require('react');\nvar Formsy = require('formsy-react');\n\nvar Input = React.createClass({\n    mixins: [Formsy.Mixin],\n    changeValue: function(event) {\n        this.setValue(event.currentTarget.value || this.props.defaultValue);\n    },\n    componentWillReceiveProps: function (nextProps) {\n        // Only change to the new default value if it is currently showing the old one\n        if (this.getValue() === this.props.defaultValue && nextProps.defaultValue !== this.props.defaultValue) {\n            this.setValue(nextProps.defaultValue);\n        }\n    },\n    render: function() {\n        var className = this.showRequired() ? 'required' : this.showError() ? 'error' : null;\n        var errorMessage = this.getErrorMessage();\n\n        return (\n            <div className={className}>\n                <input type=\"text\" value={this.getValue()} onChange={this.changeValue} />\n            </div>\n        );\n    }\n});\n\nmodule.exports = Input;\n\n```\n\nand this component...\n\n``` jsx\n<Formsy.Form url=\"/users\" onSuccess={this.changeUrl} onValid={this.enableButton} onInvalid={this.disableButton}>\n  <Form.Input name=\"firstName\" required defaultValue={this.state.profile.first}/>\n  <button type=\"submit\" disabled={!this.state.canSubmit}>Submit</button>\n</Formsy.Form>\n```\n\nWill load an input element with an empty value. However, by entering value AND THEN deleting it will the defaultValue appear in the input. Here's a .gif:\n\n![out](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6847633/5991027/0871470a-a987-11e4-833f-993719aab4fb.gif)\n\nI think the reason for this behavior might be because `nextProps.defaultValue` is undefined on the first  load. I guess it's because `componentWillReceiveProps` is not called on the initial render. Any suggestions on what to do here? \n. Thanks for the quick reply! You indeed understood the problem correctly :)\n\nI tried both methods you suggested, but ran into the same problem as @srconklin, which is that these methods only seem to work with hardcoded strings, and not from the react state `{this.state.profile.first}`\n. Actually, on second hand... My problem might not be related to formsy, and instead an issue of the way `{this.state.profile.first}` is being set. It's an async api call to a server that's happening in a mixin. So that's why it's `undefined` here:\n\n``` jsx\ncomponentWillMount: function() {\n    console.log(this.props.defaultValue); // undefined?\n    this.setValue(this.props.defaultValue);\n},\n```\n\nDo you think that sounds right?\n. @christianalfoni sorry for my amateur hour from before... I got it figured it out! But I'm back to the endless loop.\n\n@srconklin did you figure out how to avoid the endless loop? \n\nI'm thinking a new method `setValueNoValidate` might be needed for the `componentWillReceiveProps` method that does just as it says, it sets the value but doesn't validate it. Thus preventing an endless loop, maybe? \n\nObviously this wouldn't be good for data that needs to be validated as soon as it loaded, but if it's coming from the server you can probably safely assume it's already validated. \n\nWhat do you guys think?\n. Oh! That's good news. I tried it out, and I don't get the endless loop anymore! However, I still have one more problem.\n\nThis code will work fine: \n\n``` jsx\n<Formsy.Form url=\"/users\" onSuccess={this.changeUrl} onValid={this.enableButton} onInvalid={this.disableButton}>\n  <MyOwnInput name=\"email\" value={this.state.profile.email} />\n  <button type=\"submit\" disabled={!this.state.canSubmit}>Submit</button>\n</Formsy.Form>\n```\n\nBut as soon as I put any validations on it:\n\n``` jsx\n<Formsy.Form url=\"/users\" onSuccess={this.changeUrl} onValid={this.enableButton} onInvalid={this.disableButton}>\n  <MyOwnInput name=\"email\" value={this.state.profile.email} validations=\"isEmail\" validationError=\"This is not a valid email\" required/>\n  <button type=\"submit\" disabled={!this.state.canSubmit}>Submit</button>\n</Formsy.Form>\n```\n\nThen it will throw the error `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'match' of undefined` in the console. This could probably be fixed in the validationRules with a check to make sure the `value` argument is defined. \n\n``` jsx\n'isEmail': function (value) {\n  // do a check for `value` first, otherwise the next line throws an error since `value` is sometimes undefined (like on first page load)\n  return value.match(/^((([a-z]|\\d|[!#\\$%&'\\*\\+\\-\\/=\\?\\^_`{\\|}~]...\n}\n```\n\n## \n\nAlso, to double check. When building my form element, should `componentWillRecieveProps` be as simple as this?:\n\n``` jsx\ncomponentWillReceiveProps: function (nextProps) {\n    this.setValue(nextProps.value);\n},\n```\n. Gotcha. I had assumed that was just a second option, not the required way. Thanks for clearing it up!\n. `disabled={false}` doesn't make any sense, try `disabled={true}`. Unfortunately, I'm not able to update to React 0.13.x (at least at the moment).\n\nIn the mean time I've added my own `addValidationRule` that takes care of my use case. I'm okay with this solution. So if you want to close this feel free! Thanks\n. @IanVS yes, closing this.. Just merged and published @wuct 's fix\r\n\r\nIt's available on npm under `v0.19.1` https://www.npmjs.com/package/formsy-react. I had to revert the original pull request that @wuct created. I published the reversion under `v0.19.2`. \r\n\r\nIt was a breaking change for existing components. I really should've released it as 1.0.\r\n\r\nI've setup a [1.0 milestone](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/milestone/1) that will re-release a fix for this (might still use https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/pull/386 but will have to update all of the docs/examples and also need to account for [forms that are disabled until inputs are valid](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/commit/57f97cb0459a539c0533e305dbd1bfd85ad1a02f#commitcomment-20585717)). Looks good to me, any reason this hasn't been merged in yet?. @mikaelengstrom looks like this PR is outdated. Since it's so small, please feel free to recreate this PR. It will probably be easier/faster than having @gabrielboucher update this branch.. @SaitejaP I would recommend trying @keul's solution. It's what I use myself.. Thanks @tjcampbell for suggesting the idea of implementing `getInstance()`. I just submitted a PR that does exactly that. Feel free to chime in / do a peer review on https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/pull/399\n. When using your component you should provide a `value` attribute to suppress the React warning about \"elements should not switch from uncontrolled to controlled \". For example:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<MyInput value=\"\" name=\"password\" title=\"Password\" type=\"password\" required />\r\n```. I'm in favor of moving to the @dperini regex. We can hardcode, but I'd also be okay with pulling in https://github.com/kevva/url-regex. Mainly since it seems that there are occasional updates to the regex itself. So it's nice to have a repo that keeps up to date with the original [gist](https://gist.github.com/dperini/729294) and runs unit tests.. @cgood92 while it's possible to get a list of all the validation errors in user-land, it would still be nice to have this built into Formsy.\r\n\r\nWe currently have [`getModel`](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/API.md#getmodel), but I would like to see either a new method, maybe `getExtendedModel`, or just an argument passed to `getModel` that would return extra meta data about each input, which would obviously include validation status.\r\n\r\nSo yes, it's 'on the roadmap', but the priority isn't super high. I'll gladly accept a PR for it though!. @keown Sorry, formsy requires you to write custom components. Have you looked through the examples or read the README? I'm going to close this since this isn't an issue with formsy itself. This type of question would be better suited for stackoverflow.\r\n\r\n. The current validator is a beastly regex:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n  isUrl: function (values, value) {\r\n    return validations.matchRegexp(values, value, /^(https?|s?ftp):\\/\\/(((([a-z]|\\d|-|\\.|_|~|[\\u00A0-\\uD7FF\\uF900-\\uFDCF\\uFDF0-\\uFFEF])|(%[\\da-f]{2})|[!\\$&'\\(\\)\\*\\+,;=]|:)*@)?(((\\d|[1-9]\\d|1\\d\\d|2[0-4]\\d|25[0-5])\\.(\\d|[1-9]\\d|1\\d\\d|2[0-4]\\d|25[0-5])\\.(\\d|[1-9]\\d|1\\d\\d|2[0-4]\\d|25[0-5])\\.(\\d|[1-9]\\d|1\\d\\d|2[0-4]\\d|25[0-5]))|((([a-z]|\\d|[\\u00A0-\\uD7FF\\uF900-\\uFDCF\\uFDF0-\\uFFEF])|(([a-z]|\\d|[\\u00A0-\\uD7FF\\uF900-\\uFDCF\\uFDF0-\\uFFEF])([a-z]|\\d|-|\\.|_|~|[\\u00A0-\\uD7FF\\uF900-\\uFDCF\\uFDF0-\\uFFEF])*([a-z]|\\d|[\\u00A0-\\uD7FF\\uF900-\\uFDCF\\uFDF0-\\uFFEF])))\\.)+(([a-z]|[\\u00A0-\\uD7FF\\uF900-\\uFDCF\\uFDF0-\\uFFEF])|(([a-z]|[\\u00A0-\\uD7FF\\uF900-\\uFDCF\\uFDF0-\\uFFEF])([a-z]|\\d|-|\\.|_|~|[\\u00A0-\\uD7FF\\uF900-\\uFDCF\\uFDF0-\\uFFEF])*([a-z]|[\\u00A0-\\uD7FF\\uF900-\\uFDCF\\uFDF0-\\uFFEF])))\\.?)(:\\d*)?)(\\/((([a-z]|\\d|-|\\.|_|~|[\\u00A0-\\uD7FF\\uF900-\\uFDCF\\uFDF0-\\uFFEF])|(%[\\da-f]{2})|[!\\$&'\\(\\)\\*\\+,;=]|:|@)+(\\/(([a-z]|\\d|-|\\.|_|~|[\\u00A0-\\uD7FF\\uF900-\\uFDCF\\uFDF0-\\uFFEF])|(%[\\da-f]{2})|[!\\$&'\\(\\)\\*\\+,;=]|:|@)*)*)?)?(\\?((([a-z]|\\d|-|\\.|_|~|[\\u00A0-\\uD7FF\\uF900-\\uFDCF\\uFDF0-\\uFFEF])|(%[\\da-f]{2})|[!\\$&'\\(\\)\\*\\+,;=]|:|@)|[\\uE000-\\uF8FF]|\\/|\\?)*)?(#((([a-z]|\\d|-|\\.|_|~|[\\u00A0-\\uD7FF\\uF900-\\uFDCF\\uFDF0-\\uFFEF])|(%[\\da-f]{2})|[!\\$&'\\(\\)\\*\\+,;=]|:|@)|\\/|\\?)*)?$/i);\r\n  },\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I'd rather not touch it. Fortunately, you can actually add your own [custom validation rules ](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/API.md#formsyaddvalidationrulename-rulefunc). Here's one you can add to your own project:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nFormsy.addValidationRule('isLocalUrl', function (values, value) {\r\n  return (/^(http:\\/\\/)?localhost$|^127(?:\\.[0-9]+){0,2}\\.[0-9]+$|^(?:0*:)*?:?0*1$/gi.test(value));\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nI based it off this [stackoverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/8426365/785557). Thanks @wuct, just published `v0.19.1` with this in it https://www.npmjs.com/package/formsy-react. Give this a try:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\r\nimport { HOC } from 'formsy-react';\r\n\r\nclass FormInput extends Component {\r\n  constructor(props) {\r\n    super(props);\r\n\r\n    this.state = {\r\n      blurred: false,\r\n    };\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  handleBlur() {\r\n    this.setState({\r\n      blurred: true,\r\n    })\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  handleFocus() {\r\n    this.setState({\r\n      blurred: false,\r\n    })\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    var errorMessageFromBluring = this.state.blurred ? this.props.getErrorMessage() : '';\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <p>{errorMessageFromBluring}</p>\r\n        <input\r\n          type=\"text\"\r\n          onFocus={this.handleFocus.bind(this)}\r\n          onBlur={this.handleBlur.bind(this)}\r\n          onChange={e => this.props.setValue(e.target.value)}\r\n          value={this.props.getValue() || ''}\r\n        />\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default HOC(FormInput);\r\n```. Ah, yes! This has been on my todo list for a long time.. @Jareechang I haven't made an progress with this. I'll gladly accept a PR though!. Are you guys using `getValue()` on your custom input element?\r\n\r\n> [You should always use the getValue() method inside your formsy form element.](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/API.md#value). @brianfegan and @prasanna1211 would you mind providing sample code? In my experience `reset` works fine but only when you use `getValue()` in your component.. @brianfegan as the `value` attribute itself https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/examples/components/Input.js#L35\r\n\r\nTry updating your component to use `getValue` and let me know how it goes.. @brianfegan Yeah you really should be using `getValue`. Would you mind setting up a demo repo of the problem you're facing?. pinging @christianalfoni do you need additional maintainers for this project?\n. I came across a different approach that might be slightly better, which is to pass a prop called `innerRef` that takes a function just like the normal `ref` prop. A full example can be seen here https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/122\n\nWhat do you think @christianalfoni?\n. @Semigradsky are you able to chime in here and help approve this?\n. No movement. I haven't heard anything from the maintainers since opening the PR. They seem to have abandoned the project.\n\nI'm debating forking it and getting a majority of the other PR's merged in as well.\n\n> On Nov 23, 2016, at 3:49 PM, Brian Fegan <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n> \n> Is there any movement on this?

I pulled the trigger and forked the repo. I published it to npm under `formsy` (can't believe it was available!). I also merged in this PR to the new fork.\r\n\r\nYou can check it out here:\r\n\r\n- https://www.npmjs.com/package/formsy\r\n- https://github.com/aesopwolf/formsy\r\n\r\nI think I'll make an issue to advertise the new fork and it's location.. I was given write access to the repo (see https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/issues/411). So I'm going to reopen this PR and get it merged in.. @acomito You're correct, you can't access `this.refs` inside the render function.\r\n\r\nHiding/showing form fields based on another fields current value really varies depending on your situation. Would you mind pasting some code? If not, then I would suggest using setting up an `onChange` handler for your `<Formsy.Form>`, for example:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nformChangeHandler(model) {\r\n  if(model.employmentStatus === 'Full time') {\r\n    this.setState({askForEmployerName: true});\r\n  } else {\r\n    this.setState({askForEmployerName: false});\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you can hide/show the \"Employer Name\" input in your form based on `this.state.askForEmployerName`.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this as is since it's not actual issue with formsy, but we can still continue the discussion.. @you-fail-me is your custom input component using `getValue()`?. @you-fail-me Try updating your component to use `getValue()`. It should fix your problem\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/API.md#value. Thanks. Not sure if it makes sense for PR's to commit release files though. I think `npm run deploy` should be something we run when we're ready to deploy a new version. So, after x new features or every x weeks.\r\n\r\nPlus it seems like a pain for contributors to have to go through.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts? (I was just made a collaborator on the project and you seem to have some previous contributions so I'd like to get your feedback \ud83d\ude42). Ah that's a good point about being able to use your fork, I didn't think of that. I guess we can leave the release files as 'optional' for PRs.\r\n\r\nI'll go ahead and merge this as is.. This is a really good point, thanks for bringing it up. I've struggled with something similar when I wanted to allow emoji characters.\r\n\r\nI think this can probably be solved in user land. We [expose a validator](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/API.md#validators) called `matchRegexp`. And since the [xregexp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xregexp) library on npm advertises that it compiles to native RegExp objects then in theory you can just pass pass the compiled regular expression to `matchRegexp`.\r\n\r\nLet me know if that works for you or not.. I just gave it a quick test and it worked as expected! Didn't have to do anything special. For example:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<InputGroup\r\n  name=\"emoji\"\r\n  label=\"emoji\"\r\n  type=\"text\"\r\n  validations={{\r\n    matchRegexp: XRegExp('^\\\\pS$', 'A'), // https://github.com/slevithan/xregexp#unicode\r\n  }}\r\n  validationError=\"Please enter an emoji\"\r\n/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'll leave this open for now and close it once I add a note to our documentation.. Docs updated https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/API.md#validators. We probably won't merge anything in using `Promise` for awhile. Browser support is definitely getting better but IE still doesn't provide support. See https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/issues/70 for a previous discussion.. Have you looked into [`updateInputsWithError(errors)`](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/API.md#updateinputswitherrorerrors)? I have a feeling that might solve your use case.. No worries, this was actually an earlier issue https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/issues/371\r\n\r\nLong story short you need to ask https://github.com/mbrookes/formsy-material-ui to update their formsy-react dependency to v0.18.1. @Casy Are you using `formsy-material-ui`?. Ah, well their latest version hasn't updated to `formsy-react@0.18.1`, you see they [are still on 0.18.0](https://github.com/mbrookes/formsy-material-ui/blob/master/package.json#L25). Update: I sent an email to the original maintainer and he made me a Collaborator on the project. Thanks @christianalfoni \ud83d\ude00\r\n\r\nI'll be able to help close issues, merge PR's and even publish to npm. Do you have a full repo where I can reproduce the bug? This is kind of hard to debug based just on the code samples.. Thanks for the PR \ud83d\ude03\r\n\r\nWould you mind describing the problem more clearly when you say nested data? Did you have nested form elements? I'm not even sure that's allowed/possible. If you could provide some sample code that would be great.\r\n\r\nAlso, it looks like one of the tests is failing.. Thanks for the sample code. This is a situation that should be solved in user-land then. Just import `form-data-to-object` into your app and call:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nthis.refs.form.reset(formDataToObject(newProps.model));\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut really, I would suggest naming your inputs something more friendly, like so:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<Input name=\"_id\" value={null} type='hidden'/>\r\n<Input name=\"identifier\" label=\"National ID\" required/>\r\n<Checkbox name=\"active\" label=\"active?\" value={false}/>\r\n<Input name=\"name\" label=\"Patient's Name\" required/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then you can normalize your reset data to look like this:\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  _id: 123,\r\n  identifier: 'abc'\r\n  active: 'checked',\r\n  name: 'John Doe'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this since it's not something that should be in the core library. We appreciate the PR though!. Thanks for catching this. @lennardschutter what version of formsy-react are you on? If things were working correctly before and suddenly changed it was probably due to the 0.19.1 release. See the discussion here https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/commit/57f97cb0459a539c0533e305dbd1bfd85ad1a02f\r\n\r\nIn short, you can use `isFormSubmitted()` to conditionally show your errors.. Might be worth using 0.19.1 then and conditionally showing your errors by using `isFormSubmitted()`.\r\n\r\nThe validations will run but you will only display the errors if the form has been submitted.\r\n\r\nOr I might be reading your issue wrong. What do you mean by \"from a partial save\"?. Never mind my comment about 0.19.1, we actually just issued a rollback of that version. (long story).\r\n\r\nBack to your issue... Would you mind copy/pasting your Formsy.Form component and also your custom form element (just one should be enough)? It will help me a lot to debug this.. Hmm, that looks like it will work. Mind giving me a little bit to think about it? I might want to wait for the [1.0.0 release](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/milestone/1) to expose the new method.. @alexhawkins thanks for opening the issue. Would you mind taking a look at the discussion [here](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/commit/57f97cb0459a539c0533e305dbd1bfd85ad1a02f)\r\n\r\nEven if we rollback we're still contemplating re-releasing the breaking change in the next `0.20.x` release. So, it would be best practice for you to version lock your dependencies in production (especially for pre 1.0 releases).\r\n\r\nAnyways, we will probably roll back before the end of the day. But it would be nice if you added your input at the above link just to help move forward.\r\n\r\nThanks, and sorry for pushing the breaking change.. What's the use case here? Maybe we should just extend `reset` instead of introducing a new method?. This looks fine, but I'm hesitant to expose new methods. What's the use case here? Any reason `resetValue` doesn't suffice?. First glance this looks fine. Ideally we will rewrite all the docs (and source) to use ES6 classes and High Order Components though. https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/issues/395\r\n\r\nI'll wait a week (maybe 2?) before merging this. Hopefully myself, or someone else can create a PR to fully deprecate createClass/createReactClass. @ottis and @drewlustro are you guys on the latest version? `v0.19.5`?. This is amazing. Since this kills the decorator we should bump the version to 1.0.0. Thoughts?. Thanks for this. I started testing the beta branch this morning. I'll open a PR with a few tweaks of my own and let you review, then if all is good we can publish v1. @track0x1 I'm running into a problem with the reset-values example. Would you mind taking a look at it? Just run `yarn examples`, open up `http://localhost:8080/reset-values/index.html` and click the \"Reset\" button -- I can't figure out why the checkbox disappears. I've been trying to debug this for 2 days. \r\n\r\nI'm thinking about using \"defaultChecked\" in `Checkbox.js` but will need to wait for react v15.6.2 since there's [a bug at the moment](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9988). Wow... I have no words. Thank you so much. I was going crazy.. It's been a while since I've touched this. I'm just going to merge it in to the beta branch as is and open up more PR's as need be.. I've been debating forking this repo to it's own organization so that I can easily add more owners.\r\n\r\n@track0x1 would you be interested in being added as an owner?. I thought I had the time to help bring this project back to life, but I haven't be able to help out nearly as much as I thought I could.\r\n\r\nI just gave @maccuaa, @track0x1, @twisty, and @sdemjanenko access to the npm project. (You were just the first people that came to mind).\r\n\r\nLastly, this project should be converted to a github org, preferably https://github.com/formsy (but that's currently taken). So maybe https://github.com/formsy-react for the time being, @rkuykendall do you want to set that up? You could then invite those 4 people I mentioned above to be owners on the github org.. ",

I just submitted a PR #26 for this issue.\n. I was thinking about supporting keys based on the validation rule name:\n`validationError={ {isAlpha: \"Must be letters.\"} }`\n. Cool.  I wasn't sure since I wasn't clear what `email` and `foo` were.\n. This doesn't seem to be working.  When I do `validationError ={ {isLength: \"Maximum length of 64 characters\", isNodeName: \"Only letters, numbers, spaces, and common punctuation\"} }`\n\nand I put \"5 D3 Carnage&\" in the field, I see \"Maximum length of 64 charactersOnly letters, numbers, spaces, and common punctuation\" rendered as an error message.  It should not render the message about maximum length.\n. I think this is due to the the `setTimeout` call in `componentWillUpdate` in `Formsy.Form`.  I'll try to write a test for this.\n. I just submitted a better fix #38.\n. I think this fixes #35.\n. I don't think it quite works.  I've found that onChange does not fire for the initial render.  This makes it hard to get the initial state of the form.  I will be doing this on most of my forms.\n\nI think storing the initial state and diff it with the current state is something Formsy could be quite excellent at.\n. That seems reasonable.\n. I think `Formsy.Input` would be acceptable for the time being.  Down the road I could see some post-processing of the v-dom to wire up the standard inputs.\n. Actually i think `resetModel` does what I want.\n. It would be nice if documentation was added for this.\n. It would be really cool if validations could be an object. e.g. `validations={ {isIn: ['foo', 'bar']} }`\n. This fixes #47.\n. Cool. Looking forward to it.

I think it would be good to package these up into the repo and provide some good usage docs and examples for newbies to get started easier.

Would be really cool to see other's approaches to solving their specific form problems and a great way to share the knowledge base across the React community.\n. Seems silly, but I got this to work by adding an invisible submit button and then triggering a click on it in my `submit` function:\n\nForm:\n\n```\n<Formsy.Form id=\"question1\" ref=\"question1\" onSubmit={this.onSubmit} onSuccess={this.onSuccess} onValid={this.onValid} onInvalid={this.onInvalid}>\n    <RadioButtonGroup name='user_type' options={options} class={classes} validationError=\"This is a required field.\" required />\n    <button style={{display:'none'}} ref=\"question1button\" type=\"submit\" disabled={!this.state.canSubmit}>Submit</button>\n</Formsy.Form>\n```\n\nSubmit Function:\n\n```\nsubmit: function () {\n    if (this.state.canSubmit) {\n\n        // Submit the Form\n        $(this.refs.question1button.getDOMNode()).click();\n    }\n}\n```\n. Thanks @christianalfoni for looking into that, will be interested to see the solution!  I'll look into things on my end here as well.\n. Thanks @christianalfoni that does work for me, except that I can't stop the form from performing its default action for some reason.  It submits the form and refreshes the page, which is not what I want to happen since my form is submitting data to a local store instead of a server.  I've since changed the implementation to not actually call the native form submit function, and instead I've relied on a custom action that I can call from elsewhere to trigger saving the form data using `getCurrentValues()` which, by the way is a handy feature that isn't well documented in the Readme.  \n\nI found that to get around cross-browser form implementation issues, I've come to rely more on handling the submit action of my forms manually and not relying on the browser's native form behavior.\n\nAlso, for some reason when I wrap it in the jquery selector, it prevents the page reload on submit, and that's probably because by default jQuery prevents the default action?  \n. Yeah, this is one thing about React that takes some time to sink in.  A lot of times you are re-implementing features of a native DOM element (in this case the submit action of a `<form>`).  This is the beauty of React and Formsy: you rely on the Formsy API to handle the submit, not the DOM api, which brings the benefit of allowing custom behavior and removes the complexities that occur with the native DOM implementations, which tend to vary across browsers as we all know.\n.

Sorry ignore it, browsers render boolean radio values as strings.\n. One thing I've noticed is that if you submit the form by pressing enter the native validation is triggered.\n\nI think we need to be able to pass 'noValidate' to the form element. That way we can catch both the button click or hitting enter.\n\nEven just allowing the prop to be passed down to the form would do the trick.\n. Nice! that would be very handy.\n\nThe other thing that might also work is keypaths so the input name describes the data structure.\n`<input name=\"address.street\"/>`\n\nBoth approaches would be very handy in different situations.\n.

Yeah, that looks as a bug.\n\n``` js\n// Another validation brings another error (wrong api document?)\nvalidations=\"isLength:10:10\"\n//=> Error: Formsy does not support multiple args on string validations. Use object format of validations instead.\n```\n\nYes, it is not updated api. Now you should use `minLength` and `maxLength` validators.\nI corrected it.\n. Some questions:\n\nFormsy has `hasValue` validation. But that is not documented in API\n- should pass with empty string?\n- should pass with zero?\n. Good, I added `isExisty` and updated api\n. @christianalfoni I'm not well understood.\nDo you want me to add new tag (0.13.2) to repo?\nOr move changes (f168b53, 7ef6c51) to pull request?\n.

This is not exist in this version. @christianalfoni can you bump version? Or add me as collaborator to npm and I will do it.\n. It seems the best solution is to [create your own rule for this](../blob/master/API.md#formsyaddvalidationrulename-rulefunc).\n. @Nicolab You want something like this?\n\n``` js\nvar rules = Formsy.validators();\n\nFormsy.addValidationRule('minLengthOrEmpty', function (values, value) {\n  return rules.isEmptyString(values, value) || rules.minLength(values, value);\n});\n```\n. > If a field is not required and empty, needless to validate given that the field is optional (so, is a valid value).\n\nNow I understand, that is really problem.\n. @jswxwxf I tried to get your result, but I did not succeed.\nI changed a little [login example](../blob/master/examples/login/app.js). I removed `required` rule from password field. And submit button is shown when filling correct value to email field.\n\nCould you give more details?\n. You can [pre-verify value](../blob/master/API.md#isvalidvalue) or trigger validation (`this.setValue(this.getValue());`) in your `onBlur` handler.\n. > Take for example the maxLength validation. I can't use that when the field is optional.\n\nThat was fixed in #138 \nBut the new version is not yet published\n. I think it makes sense\n. Thank you for your trust! I will try to develop `formsy` :smile: \n. How about run stopPropagation submit event in your field?\n. You can use your favorite library for this. [Superagent](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent) for example:\n\n``` js\nvar request = require('superagent');\n...\nvar Login = React.createClass({\n  ...\n  submit: function (data) {\n    request.post('/app/login', data).end(function (err, res) {\n      // do smth\n    });\n  },\n  ...\n  render: function () {\n    return (\n      <Formsy.Form onValidSubmit={this.submit}>\n        ...\n```\n. I'm sorry, I can't quite understand why not make http post requests from the script.\n. Thanks for the issue. We will check the performance.\n.

Use [`getModel()`](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/API.md#getmodel) for taking values from attached inputs.\n. The new version has not yet been released\n. You can check more than one validation rule:\n\n``` js\n<MyInputComponent name=\"number\" validations=\"isNumeric,isLength:5\"/>\n<MyInputComponent name=\"number\" validations={{\n  isNumeric: true,\n  isLength: 5\n}}/>\n```\n\nHowever, the value must comply with all these rules.\n\nYou'd better add your rule: [`addValidationRule`](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/API.md#formsyaddvalidationrule)\n. Add new `isAlphanumeric` rule to built-in validations will be easier =)\n. Hi!\nSee `reset-values` example (https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/tree/react-0.14/examples)\n. Hello!\nInitially, it was so intended. But it seems it is confusing.\nI have merged your commit to working branch.\nThanks for activity!\n. I think that is the `onChange` event from the input. Just add `stopPropaganation`:\n\n``` js\n  changeValue: function (event) {\n    event.stopPropagation();\n    this.setValue(event.currentTarget.value);\n  },\n```\n. I a little changed [`login` example](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/tree/react-0.14/examples):\n\nIn `Input.js`:\n\n``` js\n  changeValue(event) {\n    console.log('Change!');\n    this.setValue(event.currentTarget[this.props.type === 'checkbox' ? 'checked' : 'value']);\n  },\n```\n\nIn `app.js`:\n\n``` js\n  onChange() {\n    console.log('Changed!');\n    console.log(arguments);\n  },\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <Form onChange={this.onChange} ...\n```\n\nI see in console:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1198848/9788368/f5d1fb7c-57d1-11e5-984f-a85c1e3cd56e.png)\n\nWhen I changed `changeValue` to:\n\n``` js\n  changeValue(event) {\n    event.stopPropagation();\n    console.log('Change!');\n    this.setValue(event.currentTarget[this.props.type === 'checkbox' ? 'checked' : 'value']);\n  },\n```\n\nI see:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1198848/9788406/3291ed10-57d2-11e5-9195-8a971ecdc6a7.png)\n. If this does not help, can you show your code?\n. How about CodePen? :-)\nhttp://codepen.io/semigradsky/pen/dYYpwv/?editors=001\n. Nice! :+1: \n. Why not just:\n\n``` js\n<MyOwnInput name=\"example\" value=\"hello\" />\n```\n\n?\n. See #135\nThis has been fixed, but the stable new version is not released yet.\nYou can use `formsy-react@0.15.1` (beta version)\n. ``` js\n{this.state.validSubmit ? \"Thanks for contacting us\" : \"\"}\n```\n\nin render, and\n\n``` js\nthis.setState({ validSubmit: true });\n```\n\nin `onValidSubmit`\n. Just add `isNumeric` validation:\n\n``` js\n<MyInputComponent name=\"foo\" validations=\"isNumeric\"/>\n```\n. See #135\n. Fixed in #229\n. What's your problem with `style`?\n\n``` js\nreturn (\n      <Formsy.Form style={{background: \"black\"}} ...>\n```\n. You can use any method. `Formsy` does not limit you in this. See source:\n\n``` js\n    return (\n      <form {...this.props} onSubmit={this.submit}>\n        {this.props.children}\n      </form>\n    );\n```\n. @christianalfoni could you see? This PR looks good.\n. :smile_cat: \n. > minLength:1 should give the error message when the input is not pristine and it's length is less than 1.\n\n@dsteinbach , @eriknyk , @CrisLi , @dayAlone   why? What should I do if I want to validate `minLength` only when field not empty?\nNow you have more flexibility in adding or removing `required` attribute.\n. See #135 \n. Hi! Could you add a test for this case?\n. Nice, thanks!\n. Something like this?\n\n``` js\nfunction overrideValue(value) {\n  return value + '42';\n}\n\nconst MyInput = React.createClass({\n  ...,\n  changeValue(event) {\n    const value = event.currentTarget.value;\n    this.setValue(overrideValue(value));\n  },\n  render() {\n    return <input ... onChange={this.changeValue} >\n```\n\nPlease, provide more information.\n. @neoziro  Hi! Could you add a test for this case?\n. @neoziro ok, could you show this in http://codepen.io/semigradsky/pen/dYYpwv?editors=001 ? Just fork this pen and edit it.\n. Nice! I added test 59bde8324c013f5d7f63307f3645a772e8a5a5b4 and merged it\n. Nope. @christianalfoni ?\n. Fix in #251 \n. @sdemjanenko Hi! Thanks for PR\nCould you use spread syntax instead adding new dependency?\nhttps://facebook.github.io/react/docs/transferring-props.html#transferring-with-...-in-jsx\n\n```\nvar {\n      mapping,\n      validationErrors,\n      onSubmit,\n      onValid,\n      onInvalid,\n      onInvalidSubmit,\n      onChange,\n      reset,\n      preventExternalInvalidation,\n      onSuccess,\n      onError,\n      ...nonFormsyProps\n} = this.props;\n```\n. Nice!\n. I can't. Ping @christianalfoni \n. Thank you for your help\nFixed in 6767a6b9eba9c0a7c255c46ce2d6f84dc69eeeb4\n. Use `required=\"isExisty\"` if you want to validate `null`.\n. Done! 18467a94a1ea95fd4ffe168218a59a9c07781dbc\n. Yeah! Use [`required`](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/API.md#required) if you want validate empty value.\n. Hi! The problem arises from the fact that the library is heavily dependent on the input names.\nTherefore, problems occur when changing the name of the input.\n\nI tried to get rid of it. See #275 \n. @sdemjanenko @farisj @meikoudras @josercruz01 Hi! Could you test #275 on your code? If everything is fine, I will merge it.\n. [FormData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData/Using_FormData_Objects)?\n. @574196906 you should use [own form element](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react#building-a-form-element-required) not just `input`. You can see example [here](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/examples/components/Input.js)\n. Right! :)\n. How about just add `required` atribute?\n. @tnrich Hi! Use [`getModel()`](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/API.md#getmodel) for taking values from attached inputs.\n. @SimonVaucher Hi! Thanks for PR\nI think it is very rarely used the feature to include it in the library. In most cases, will be used custom error messages.\n\nYou can create a separate repository with errors messages and using it this way:\n\n``` jsx\nvar validationMessages = require('formsy-validation-messages'); // or some other name\n...\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <Form ...>\n          <Input validationErrors={validationMessages} ... />\n          ...\n      </Form>\n    );\n  }\n...\n```\n\nMaybe @christianalfoni has a different opinion on this matter.\n. Use [`updateInputsWithError`](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/API.md#updateinputswitherrorerrors)\n. Yes, that makes sense\n. Fixed in 6767a6b9eba9c0a7c255c46ce2d6f84dc69eeeb4\n. Maybe just use [`matchRegexp` validation](../blob/master/API.md#validators)?\n. Use [`validationErrors`](../blob/master/API.md#validationerrors-1)\n\n``` jsx\n<MyInputComponent\n  name=\"email\"\n  validations={{\n    isEmail: true,\n    maxLength: 50\n  }}\n  validationErrors={{\n    isEmail: 'You have to type valid email',\n    maxLength: 'You can not type in more than 50 characters'\n  }}\n/>\n```\n. Yeah, new Formsy version not realised yet.\n@christianalfoni ping\n. Sorry for the long pause. Formsy-react updated, check new version.\n. It would be great.\n. Sorry for the long pause. Formsy-react updated, check new version.\n. Hi for all! @twisty @mbrookes @sdemjanenko and other\n@christianalfoni has promised to give me rights in npm.\nThis means that soon there will be a new version :smile_cat: \n. Sorry for the long pause. The new version is [here](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/releases/tag/v0.18.0)!\n. You mean `formsy-react 15.0.0`?\nI don't think it's really necessary.\n. Sorry for the long pause. Formsy-react updated, check new version.\n. @pizzurro current behavior is correct. If you want get \"fail\" with empty value, you should add `required` validation additionally.\n\nI'll update the documentation that it was more clear.\n. 89a2d4287ba3decab2b9a52214cf881e60fb7d77\n. Fixed in 6767a6b9eba9c0a7c255c46ce2d6f84dc69eeeb4\n. Sorry for the long pause. Formsy-react updated, check new version.\n. Sorry for the long pause. Formsy-react updated, check new version.\n. Sorry for the long pause. Formsy-react updated, check new version.\n. Formsy-react dependencies updated. Now there should be no error messages during installation.\n. Thanks for your help! I updated Formsy, check new version.\n. @kremez19 I'm sorry, my mistake. Check now\n. @keul you can use [`mapping`](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/API.md#mapping) for define only fields you want.\n. Another variant:\n1. Add boolean properties to `Form`: `validateOnChange`, `validateOnInit`\n2. Rename [`validate`](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/API.md#validate) to `customValidate`.\n3. Add `validate` method to `Form` and `Mixin` for manually validation.\n. ``` jsx\n<div className=\"container\" styles={styles.container} refs=\"form\" mapping={this.mapInputs}>\n```\n\n`refs=\"form\"` and `mapping` must be on `Formsy.Form`element\n. You can write custom validation:\n\n``` jsx\nfunction requiredOneFrom(names) {\n  return function(values, value) {\n    const valid = names.some(name => isExist(values[name]));\n    return valid ? true : isExist(value);\n  };\n}\n...\n...\n<Input name=\"foo1\" validations={{ myCustomValidation: requiredOneFrom(['foo1', 'foo2', 'foo3']) }}/>\n<Input name=\"foo2\" validations={{ myCustomValidation: requiredOneFrom(['foo1', 'foo2', 'foo3']) }}/>\n<Input name=\"foo3\" validations={{ myCustomValidation: requiredOneFrom(['foo1', 'foo2', 'foo3']) }}/>\n```\n. @574196906 you should use [own form element](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react#building-a-form-element-required) not just `input`. You can see example [here](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/examples/components/Input.js)\n. @hifitodd , @Steinarthor just use `required`\n. It makes sense to change the validator to Diego Perini variant:\nhttps://mathiasbynens.be/demo/url-regex\n. Yes, it should be fixed\n. How about use object notation?\n\n``` jsx\n<FRC.Input name=\"value\"\n    validations={{ notEqualsAny: this.state.data }}\n/>\n```\n. nope https://www.npmjs.com/package/form-data-to-object\n\nLooks like npm problem. Try again.\n. Thanks!\n. ``` js\n...\nonKeyPress(event) {\n    if (event.which === 13 /* Enter */) {\n      event.preventDefault();\n    }\n},\nrender() {\n  return (\n      <Form onKeyPress={this.onKeyPress} ...\n...\n```\n. It looks like problem in `formsy-react-components`. Please open issue in [that repo](https://github.com/twisty/formsy-react-components)\n. @albertotorresfoltyn just update `formsy-react-components`\n. Are you using `formsy-material-ui`?\nIt looks like problem in `formsy-material-ui`. Please open issue in [that repo](https://github.com/mbrookes/formsy-material-ui)\n. Something wrong :smile_cat: \n. Did you look `reset-values` example in [examples](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/tree/master/examples)?\n. Did you have imported  `React` before `formsy-react`?\n. @giovannicode hi! I have checked your example. Fix for it: https://github.com/giovannicode/formsy-import-test/pull/1\n. @CrazyDeveloper see https://github.com/twisty/formsy-react-components/issues/80\n. There are no any conversions. If you want validate numbers you should set numbers. https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/API.md#setvalue\n\nSomething like this:\n\n``` js\n    changeValue(event) {\n        var value = event.currentTarget.value;\n        value = parseInt(value, 10);\n        this.setValue(value);\n    },\n```\n. Because this validation is performed only after submitting form =)\n. Yeah, native submit will not work. You must do it yourself.\n. 1) `isExisty` returns true if the value is not undefined or null\n`required` failed when values is `undefined` or empty string\n2) Others form inputs values. See cross input validation example here: https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/API.md#formsyaddvalidationrule\n. If you want to consider `null` value as `no value` you can add your own `required` validation:\n\n``` js\nFormsy.addValidationRule('myRequired', function (values, value) {\n  return value === undefined || value === '' || value === null;\n});\n```\n\nand use it\n\n``` jsx\n<MyInputComponent name=\"email\" required=\"myRequired\" />\n```\n. You can write mixin (or higher order component) for it. And add this mixin (call this higher order component) for your input.\n. 1. Check validation and requirements on inputs. Get first failed.\n2. Get top position of failed input. `el.getBoundingClientRect().top + window.scrollY`\n3. Scroll to it. `window.scrollTo(0, topPosition)`\n. ``` jsx\n<input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"foo[0]\" value=\"value1\"/>\n<input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"foo[1]\" value=\"value2\"/>\n```\n\nFormsy used [form-data-to-object](https://github.com/christianalfoni/form-data-to-object)\n. @aesopwolf @rkuykendall Hi guys. I removed @formsy org, you can use this if you want.\r\nUnfortunately, I'm not interested in this project now.. Looks like you confused the repo.. > That is the bundled release.\n\nHow to use it? Why do it?\n. Oh, I see, thank you!\n. I think `bower.json` is not needed in npm package\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1198848/6940475/f70c6ad0-d87f-11e4-9914-c214e6b1245d.png)\n. Now this issue is not actual =)\n. Try this `mapInputs` function:\n\n``` coffee\nmapInputs: (inputs) ->\n  member:\n    email: inputs.email\n    first_name: inputs.first_name\n    last_name: inputs.last_name\n```\n. :+1: \n. Try clear npm cache and before installing dependencies:\n\n```\nrm -rf node_modules\nnpm cache clean\nnpm install\nnpm run examples\n```\n\nIf it is not helped try update your node.js and npm.\n. Hmm, strange, maybe this is determined by the fact that `react` is [peerDependency](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/package.json#L37). I could not repeat.\n. I think it will not be superfluous :)\n. @christianalfoni how about just passing all props?\n\nThis\n\n``` js\n    return (\n        <form {...this.props} onSubmit={this.submit}>\n            {this.traverseChildrenAndRegisterInputs(this.props.children)}\n        </form>\n    );\n```\n\ninstead\n\n``` js\n    return React.DOM.form({\n        onSubmit: this.submit,\n        className: this.props.className,\n        autoComplete: this.props.autoComplete\n      },\n      this.traverseChildrenAndRegisterInputs(this.props.children)\n    );\n```\n. :laughing: \n. It would be great! =)\n. Maybe you can give more information? Have you checked that after the removal of the `matchRegexp` rule all worked fine?\nCan you give your `regexp`?\n. Which version are you using?\n`minLength` validation will be added in 0.11.0 version. And it is still present.\n. Yeah, that looks as a bug.\n\n``` js\n// Another validation brings another error (wrong api document?)\nvalidations=\"isLength:10:10\"\n//=> Error: Formsy does not support multiple args on string validations. Use object format of validations instead.\n```\n\nYes, it is not updated api. Now you should use `minLength` and `maxLength` validators.\nI corrected it.\n. Some questions:\n\nFormsy has `hasValue` validation. But that is not documented in API\n- should pass with empty string?\n- should pass with zero?\n. Good, I added `isExisty` and updated api\n. @christianalfoni I'm not well understood.\nDo you want me to add new tag (0.13.2) to repo?\nOr move changes (f168b53, 7ef6c51) to pull request?\n. Should fix #113 \n. > ``` js\n> //valid\n> 'sup', ''\n> ```\n\nThat is confused me. Length of empty string is not 3 ;)\n\n@sanemat  How about extending the syntax?\n\n``` js\n<TestInput\n  name=\"foo\" \n  validations=\"isLength:0:3\" />\n```\n\nand\n\n``` js\n<TestInput\n  name=\"foo\" \n  validations={{\n    isLength: [0, 3]\n  }} />\n```\n\nThis should not be difficult to implement)\n. Looks good. Can you add tests for these cases?\nhttps://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/specs/Utils-spec.jsx\n. Nice! Thanks :+1: \n. @dsteinbach you can not nesting forms:\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/forms.html#the-form-element\n\n> **Content model:**\n> Flow content, but with no form element descendants.\n. You want check valid email or not?\nYou can use [`isValidValue` method](../blob/master/API.md#isvalidvalue) for this.\n. Thanks!\n. Yeah dependency was be removed. I have changed it to babel-loader. https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/commit/cca4973382a6c85be4f4e1f844c656d67bc8ffa8 Now all should be fine.\n. This is not exist in this version. @christianalfoni can you bump version? Or add me as collaborator to npm and I will do it.\n. It seems the best solution is to [create your own rule for this](../blob/master/API.md#formsyaddvalidationrulename-rulefunc).\n. @Nicolab You want something like this?\n\n``` js\nvar rules = Formsy.validators();\n\nFormsy.addValidationRule('minLengthOrEmpty', function (values, value) {\n  return rules.isEmptyString(values, value) || rules.minLength(values, value);\n});\n```\n. > If a field is not required and empty, needless to validate given that the field is optional (so, is a valid value).\n\nNow I understand, that is really problem.\n. @jswxwxf I tried to get your result, but I did not succeed.\nI changed a little [login example](../blob/master/examples/login/app.js). I removed `required` rule from password field. And submit button is shown when filling correct value to email field.\n\nCould you give more details?\n. You can [pre-verify value](../blob/master/API.md#isvalidvalue) or trigger validation (`this.setValue(this.getValue());`) in your `onBlur` handler.\n. > Take for example the maxLength validation. I can't use that when the field is optional.\n\nThat was fixed in #138 \nBut the new version is not yet published\n. I think it makes sense\n. Thank you for your trust! I will try to develop `formsy` :smile: \n. How about run stopPropagation submit event in your field?\n. You can use your favorite library for this. [Superagent](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent) for example:\n\n``` js\nvar request = require('superagent');\n...\nvar Login = React.createClass({\n  ...\n  submit: function (data) {\n    request.post('/app/login', data).end(function (err, res) {\n      // do smth\n    });\n  },\n  ...\n  render: function () {\n    return (\n      <Formsy.Form onValidSubmit={this.submit}>\n        ...\n```\n. I'm sorry, I can't quite understand why not make http post requests from the script.\n. Thanks for the issue. We will check the performance.\n. Are you tried use [`pure-render-mixin`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/pure-render-mixin.html) in your inputs?\n. Could you provide some of your code? So we might better understand where the bottleneck :snail: \n. Now it is not the priority, maybe after a new release\n. Thank!\n. Yeah, higher-order-component and decorator should be implemented.\nExample of realizing: https://github.com/Yomguithereal/baobab-react/tree/master/src\n. It is necessary to check, perhaps you can just use https://github.com/brigand/react-mixin?\n. @twisty thanks for response!\nFixed in 89759fefdedcd013fca45b248f4d12232123f3bb\n. Yeah, I think `getErrorMessages` should return `[]` instead of `null`\n:+1: 357f4adf715a58b17faa3b6094aef6b8f7de4391\n. Hi, this is fixed in new version #158\n. Nice! Thanks for assistance!\n. Already, you can use this:\n\n``` js\n<Formsy.Form id=\"some-id\"></Formsy.Form>\n```\n. A good idea! I'll do it when I have enough time.\n. This issue resolved in #138 \n. @rodryquintero Hi! Use [`getModel()`](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/API.md#getmodel) for taking values from attached inputs.\n. It should already be fixed in the new version. Try [react-0.14 branch](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/tree/react-0.14)\nRelease is coming )\n. See https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/issues/158\nDependencies will be changed after releasing new version.\n. @emeeks The issue resolved?\n. Hello!\nI have merged your commit to working branch.\nThanks for activity!\n. @EthanML @CharlieGreenman  Hi! Use [`getModel()`](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/API.md#getmodel) for taking values from attached inputs.\n. The new version has not yet been released\n. You can check more than one validation rule:\n\n``` js\n<MyInputComponent name=\"number\" validations=\"isNumeric,isLength:5\"/>\n<MyInputComponent name=\"number\" validations={{\n  isNumeric: true,\n  isLength: 5\n}}/>\n```\n\nHowever, the value must comply with all these rules.\n\nYou'd better add your rule: [`addValidationRule`](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/API.md#formsyaddvalidationrule)\n. Add new `isAlphanumeric` rule to built-in validations will be easier =)\n. Hi!\nSee `reset-values` example (https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/tree/react-0.14/examples)\n. Hello!\nInitially, it was so intended. But it seems it is confusing.\nI have merged your commit to working branch.\nThanks for activity!\n. I think that is the `onChange` event from the input. Just add `stopPropaganation`:\n\n``` js\n  changeValue: function (event) {\n    event.stopPropagation();\n    this.setValue(event.currentTarget.value);\n  },\n```\n. I a little changed [`login` example](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/tree/react-0.14/examples):\n\nIn `Input.js`:\n\n``` js\n  changeValue(event) {\n    console.log('Change!');\n    this.setValue(event.currentTarget[this.props.type === 'checkbox' ?

If this does not help, can you show your code?\n. How about CodePen? :-)\nhttp://codepen.io/semigradsky/pen/dYYpwv/?editors=001\n. Nice! :+1: \n. Why not just:\n\n``` js\n<MyOwnInput name=\"example\" value=\"hello\" />\n```\n\n?\n. See #135\nThis has been fixed, but the stable new version is not released yet.\nYou can use `formsy-react@0.15.1` (beta version)\n. ``` js\n{this.state.validSubmit ? \"Thanks for contacting us\" : \"\"}\n```\n\nin render, and\n\n``` js\nthis.setState({ validSubmit: true });\n```\n\nin `onValidSubmit`\n. Just add `isNumeric` validation:\n\n``` js\n<MyInputComponent name=\"foo\" validations=\"isNumeric\"/>\n```\n. See #135\n. Fixed in #229\n. What's your problem with `style`?\n\n``` js\nreturn (\n      <Formsy.Form style={{background: \"black\"}} ...>\n```\n. You can use any method. `Formsy` does not limit you in this. See source:\n\n``` js\n    return (\n      <form {...this.props} onSubmit={this.submit}>\n        {this.props.children}\n      </form>\n    );\n```\n. @christianalfoni could you see? This PR looks good.\n. :smile_cat: \n. > minLength:1 should give the error message when the input is not pristine and it's length is less than 1.\n\n@dsteinbach , @eriknyk , @CrisLi , @dayAlone   why? What should I do if I want to validate `minLength` only when field not empty?\nNow you have more flexibility in adding or removing `required` attribute.\n. See #135 \n. Hi! Could you add a test for this case?\n. Nice, thanks!\n. Something like this?\n\n``` js\nfunction overrideValue(value) {\n  return value + '42';\n}\n\nconst MyInput = React.createClass({\n  ...,\n  changeValue(event) {\n    const value = event.currentTarget.value;\n    this.setValue(overrideValue(value));\n  },\n  render() {\n    return <input ... onChange={this.changeValue} >\n```\n\nPlease, provide more information.\n. @neoziro  Hi! Could you add a test for this case?\n. @neoziro ok, could you show this in http://codepen.io/semigradsky/pen/dYYpwv?editors=001 ? Just fork this pen and edit it.\n. Nice! I added test 59bde8324c013f5d7f63307f3645a772e8a5a5b4 and merged it\n. Nope. @christianalfoni ?\n. Fix in #251 \n. @sdemjanenko Hi! Thanks for PR\nCould you use spread syntax instead adding new dependency?\nhttps://facebook.github.io/react/docs/transferring-props.html#transferring-with-...-in-jsx\n\n```\nvar {\n      mapping,\n      validationErrors,\n      onSubmit,\n      onValid,\n      onInvalid,\n      onInvalidSubmit,\n      onChange,\n      reset,\n      preventExternalInvalidation,\n      onSuccess,\n      onError,\n      ...nonFormsyProps\n} = this.props;\n```\n. Nice!\n. I can't. Ping @christianalfoni \n. Thank you for your help\nFixed in 6767a6b9eba9c0a7c255c46ce2d6f84dc69eeeb4\n. Use `required=\"isExisty\"` if you want to validate `null`.\n. Done! 18467a94a1ea95fd4ffe168218a59a9c07781dbc\n. Yeah! Use [`required`](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/API.md#required) if you want validate empty value.\n. Hi! The problem arises from the fact that the library is heavily dependent on the input names.\nTherefore, problems occur when changing the name of the input.\n\nI tried to get rid of it. See #275 \n. @sdemjanenko @farisj @meikoudras @josercruz01 Hi! Could you test #275 on your code? If everything is fine, I will merge it.\n. [FormData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData/Using_FormData_Objects)?\n. @574196906 you should use [own form element](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react#building-a-form-element-required) not just `input`. You can see example [here](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/examples/components/Input.js)\n. Right! :)\n. How about just add `required` atribute?\n. @tnrich Hi! Use [`getModel()`](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/API.md#getmodel) for taking values from attached inputs.\n. @SimonVaucher Hi! Thanks for PR\nI think it is very rarely used the feature to include it in the library. In most cases, will be used custom error messages.\n\nYou can create a separate repository with errors messages and using it this way:\n\n``` jsx\nvar validationMessages = require('formsy-validation-messages'); // or some other name\n...\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <Form ...>\n          <Input validationErrors={validationMessages} ... />\n          ...\n      </Form>\n    );\n  }\n...\n```\n\nMaybe @christianalfoni has a different opinion on this matter.\n. Use [`updateInputsWithError`](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/API.md#updateinputswitherrorerrors)\n. Yes, that makes sense\n. Fixed in 6767a6b9eba9c0a7c255c46ce2d6f84dc69eeeb4\n. Maybe just use [`matchRegexp` validation](../blob/master/API.md#validators)?\n. Use [`validationErrors`](../blob/master/API.md#validationerrors-1)\n\n``` jsx\n<MyInputComponent\n  name=\"email\"\n  validations={{\n    isEmail: true,\n    maxLength: 50\n  }}\n  validationErrors={{\n    isEmail: 'You have to type valid email',\n    maxLength: 'You can not type in more than 50 characters'\n  }}\n/>\n```\n. Yeah, new Formsy version not realised yet.\n@christianalfoni ping\n. Sorry for the long pause. Formsy-react updated, check new version.\n. It would be great.\n. Sorry for the long pause. Formsy-react updated, check new version.\n. Hi for all! @twisty @mbrookes @sdemjanenko and other\n@christianalfoni has promised to give me rights in npm.\nThis means that soon there will be a new version :smile_cat: \n. Sorry for the long pause. The new version is [here](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/releases/tag/v0.18.0)!\n. You mean `formsy-react 15.0.0`?\nI don't think it's really necessary.\n. Sorry for the long pause. Formsy-react updated, check new version.\n. @pizzurro current behavior is correct. If you want get \"fail\" with empty value, you should add `required` validation additionally.\n\nI'll update the documentation that it was more clear.\n. 89a2d4287ba3decab2b9a52214cf881e60fb7d77\n. Fixed in 6767a6b9eba9c0a7c255c46ce2d6f84dc69eeeb4\n. Sorry for the long pause. Formsy-react updated, check new version.\n. Sorry for the long pause. Formsy-react updated, check new version.\n. Sorry for the long pause. Formsy-react updated, check new version.\n. Formsy-react dependencies updated. Now there should be no error messages during installation.\n. Thanks for your help! I updated Formsy, check new version.\n. @kremez19 I'm sorry, my mistake. Check now\n. @keul you can use [`mapping`](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/API.md#mapping) for define only fields you want.\n. Another variant:\n1. Add boolean properties to `Form`: `validateOnChange`, `validateOnInit`\n2. Rename [`validate`](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/API.md#validate) to `customValidate`.\n3. Add `validate` method to `Form` and `Mixin` for manually validation.\n. ``` jsx\n<div className=\"container\" styles={styles.container} refs=\"form\" mapping={this.mapInputs}>\n```\n\n`refs=\"form\"` and `mapping` must be on `Formsy.Form`element\n. You can write custom validation:\n\n``` jsx\nfunction requiredOneFrom(names) {\n  return function(values, value) {\n    const valid = names.some(name => isExist(values[name]));\n    return valid ? true : isExist(value);\n  };\n}\n...\n...\n<Input name=\"foo1\" validations={{ myCustomValidation: requiredOneFrom(['foo1', 'foo2', 'foo3']) }}/>\n<Input name=\"foo2\" validations={{ myCustomValidation: requiredOneFrom(['foo1', 'foo2', 'foo3']) }}/>\n<Input name=\"foo3\" validations={{ myCustomValidation: requiredOneFrom(['foo1', 'foo2', 'foo3']) }}/>\n```\n. @574196906 you should use [own form element](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react#building-a-form-element-required) not just `input`. You can see example [here](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/examples/components/Input.js)\n. @hifitodd , @Steinarthor just use `required`\n. It makes sense to change the validator to Diego Perini variant:\nhttps://mathiasbynens.be/demo/url-regex\n. Yes, it should be fixed\n. How about use object notation?\n\n``` jsx\n<FRC.Input name=\"value\"\n    validations={{ notEqualsAny: this.state.data }}\n/>\n```\n. nope https://www.npmjs.com/package/form-data-to-object\n\nLooks like npm problem. Try again.\n. Thanks!\n. ``` js\n...\nonKeyPress(event) {\n    if (event.which === 13 /* Enter */) {\n      event.preventDefault();\n    }\n},\nrender() {\n  return (\n      <Form onKeyPress={this.onKeyPress} ...\n...\n```\n. It looks like problem in `formsy-react-components`. Please open issue in [that repo](https://github.com/twisty/formsy-react-components)\n. @albertotorresfoltyn just update `formsy-react-components`\n. Are you using `formsy-material-ui`?\nIt looks like problem in `formsy-material-ui`. Please open issue in [that repo](https://github.com/mbrookes/formsy-material-ui)\n. Something wrong :smile_cat: \n. Did you look `reset-values` example in [examples](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/tree/master/examples)?\n. Did you have imported  `React` before `formsy-react`?\n. @giovannicode hi! I have checked your example. Fix for it: https://github.com/giovannicode/formsy-import-test/pull/1\n. @CrazyDeveloper see https://github.com/twisty/formsy-react-components/issues/80\n. There are no any conversions. If you want validate numbers you should set numbers. https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/API.md#setvalue\n\nSomething like this:\n\n``` js\n    changeValue(event) {\n        var value = event.currentTarget.value;\n        value = parseInt(value, 10);\n        this.setValue(value);\n    },\n```\n. Because this validation is performed only after submitting form =)\n. Yeah, native submit will not work. You must do it yourself.\n. 1) `isExisty` returns true if the value is not undefined or null\n`required` failed when values is `undefined` or empty string\n2) Others form inputs values. See cross input validation example here: https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/API.md#formsyaddvalidationrule\n. If you want to consider `null` value as `no value` you can add your own `required` validation:\n\n``` js\nFormsy.addValidationRule('myRequired', function (values, value) {\n  return value === undefined || value === '' || value === null;\n});\n```\n\nand use it\n\n``` jsx\n<MyInputComponent name=\"email\" required=\"myRequired\" />\n```\n. You can write mixin (or higher order component) for it. And add this mixin (call this higher order component) for your input.\n. 1. Check validation and requirements on inputs. Get first failed.\n2. Get top position of failed input. `el.getBoundingClientRect().top + window.scrollY`\n3. Scroll to it. `window.scrollTo(0, topPosition)`\n. ``` jsx\n<input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"foo[0]\" value=\"value1\"/>\n<input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"foo[1]\" value=\"value2\"/>\n```\n\nFormsy used [form-data-to-object](https://github.com/christianalfoni/form-data-to-object)\n. @aesopwolf @rkuykendall Hi guys.

    "twisty": "I think @dprentis is right, the `formnovalidate` attribute is only allowed on submit and image input types. So if it's present on the default button for the form, native validation is skipped. If `formnovalidate` is not present on the default button, then a `novalidate` attribute on the form element comes into play.\n\nFrom what I can see, adding `formNoValidate` to other inputs (as shown in the API documentation) has no effect.\n\nNative validation shown:\n\n```\n<Formsy.Form>\n   <input name=\"foo\" formNoValidate required />\n   <input name=\"submit\" type=\"Submit\" />\n</Formsy.Form>\n```\n\nNative validation supressed:\n\n```\n<Formsy.Form>\n   <input name=\"foo\" required />\n   <input name=\"submit\" formNoValidate type=\"Submit\" />\n</Formsy.Form>\n```\n. Yes, that's the way to do it with `formNoValidate` on a submit button. We should change the docs to show this.\n. There's another case where `formNoValidate` works:\n\n``` xml\n<Formsy.Form>\n   <input type=\"search\" name=\"q\" formNoValidate required />\n</Formsy.Form>\n```\n\nI think what happens here is that in a form with a single \"texty\" type of input, that element also takes the role of the submit button, so `formNoValidate` applies and native validation is skipped.\n\nIn the docs, it maybe worth noting that formsy-react isn't performing any \"special magic\", and provide a link to the html5 spec?\n. Also! Maybe we should whitelist the `noValidate` attribute on the form element?\n. @colinmccann In FRC, there is a File component. You should use that instead!\n\nSee [release notes for 0.4.0](https://github.com/twisty/formsy-react-components/releases/tag/v0.4.0) for a bit more detail.\n\nThe `C:\\fakepath` is added by your browser.\n. There's an interesting approach using [the `-webkit-autofill` selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/%3A-webkit-autofill) that may be worth examining. See: https://github.com/appsforartists/gravel/commit/d868d68559047199dd53860c874dad9bf9a63cf3\n\nSee also:\n- https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/1159\n- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11708092/detecting-browser-autofill/\n- https://github.com/tbosch/autofill-event\n. I suppose it could be technically possible to ditch the `required` prop, but I think it's there for convenience and discoverability...\n\nIt's a common UI pattern to present asterisks next to required fields, using the `isRequired()` function is perhaps \"cleaner\" than inspecting a component's validators to work out if the component is required or not (particularly as presenting a \"required\" indicator in the UI is often separate from presenting other validation errors).\n\nAlso, as there is a `required` attribute for HTML5 form controls, developers coming to this library are already likely to be familiar with setting a `required` attribute separately to other input constraints (specific input types, validations, etc.).\n. Hello there,\n\nSome good stuff in this release, thanks!\n\nI've been having trouble getting the multiple error messages to show (code below). The validations seem to be running correctly, but it seems to only return the generic \"fallback\" error message.\n\n``` javascript\nvar React = require('react');\nvar ReactDOM = require('react-dom');\nvar Formsy = require('formsy-react');\n\nvar ValidationTest = React.createClass({\n\n    mixins: [Formsy.Mixin],\n\n    renderErrors() {\n        var errorMessages = this.getErrorMessages() || [];\n        return errorMessages.map((message, key) => {\n              return (\n                  <p key={key}>Error: {message}</p>\n            );\n        });\n    },\n\n    onChange(e) {\n        this.setValue(e.currentTarget.value);\n    },\n\n    render() {\n        return (\n            <div>\n                {this.isRequired() ? '* ' : ''}\n                <input\n                    type=\"text\"\n                    value={this.getValue()}\n                    onChange={this.onChange}\n                    required={this.props.required}\n                />\n                {this.renderErrors()}\n            </div>\n        );\n    }\n\n });\n\nvar App = React.createClass({\n    render() {\n        return (\n            <Formsy.Form onSubmit={(model) => { console.log(model); }} noValidate>\n                <ValidationTest\n                    name=\"nesting[for][the][win]\"\n                    validations={{\n                        isEmail: true,\n                        maxLength: 8\n                    }}\n                    validationErrors={{\n                        isEmail: 'Is not an email address.',\n                        maxLength: 'Maximum length is 8.'\n                    }}\n                    validationError=\"Generic error.\"\n                    required\n                />\n                <input type=\"submit\" />\n            </Formsy.Form>\n        )\n    }\n});\n\nReactDOM.render(<App/>, document.body);\n```\n. @Semigradsky super!\n\nHere's an edge case for you! When the component is set as 'required', and the value is empty (i.e `showRequired()` is true) `getErrorMessages()` returns `[undefined]`. It feels like it should return `[]`.\n\nThe work-around is to check for `showRequired()` before showing error messages, but the current behaviour doesn't seem intuitive. What do you think?\n. You could just modify the user input before passing it to `setValue`. Presumably you're calling `setValue` in an `onBlur` callback? Something like this could work:\n\n``` javascript\nvar Url = React.createClass({\n\n    mixins: [Formsy.Mixin],\n\n    onChange(e) {\n        this.setState({displayValue: e.currentTarget.value});\n    },\n\n    onBlur(e) {\n        var value = e.currentTarget.value;\n        if (value.indexOf('http://') !== 0) {\n            value = 'http://' + value;\n        }\n        this.setState({displayValue: value});\n        this.setValue(value);\n    },\n\n    render() {\n        return (\n            <div>\n                <input\n                    type=\"text\"\n                    value={this.state.displayValue}\n                    onChange={this.onChange}\n                    onBlur={this.onBlur}\n                />\n            </div>\n        );\n    }\n\n});\n```\n. Hi, validating after blur is possible, delaying running validations until submit isn't possible at the moment.\n- Validate email after blur: #139\n- Add optional prop 'validateOnSubmit' to Form component: #147\n\nMaybe you could work around this by suppressing the rendering the validation warnings? For example, you could set a property on the form components that dictates whether to render the validation errors, and change this property on `onValidSubmit` and `onInvalidSubmit` callback.\n. It's not possible with the currently released version, but will be coming in a future release.\n\nSee https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/issues/158.\n. In [twisty/formsy-react-components](https://github.com/twisty/formsy-react-components/) we set a `validatePristine` property, and then test for it before rendering error messages etc.:\n\n``` jsx\n    renderErrorMessage: function() {\n        if (!this.showErrors()) {\n            return '';\n        }\n        var errorMessages = this.getErrorMessages() || [];\n        return errorMessages.map((message, key) => {\n            return (\n                <span key={key} className=\"help-block validation-message\">{message}</span>\n            );\n        });\n    },\n\n    showErrors: function() {\n        if (this.isPristine() === true) {\n            if (this.props.validatePristine === false) {\n                return false;\n            }\n        }\n        return (this.isValid() === false);\n    }\n```\n\nSee: https://github.com/twisty/formsy-react-components/blob/68d5fb86bdaf9fb2cd8000c51b4269bd8049d3ab/src/mixins/component.js#L51-L70\n. `Form Input requires a name property when used`\n\nI think this message could be clearer. For example, you may have an formsy component called `Input` in the form, but the error could be triggered by any of the other formsy components in the form.\n\nMaybe the following would be better?\n\n`Formsy components require a name prop`\n\nCan send a PR if you like.\n. I may be wrong, but I think @Semigradsky already has write access to this repo?\n\nThere is enough improvement to justify a new release, but only @christianalfoni has the power to push releases on npm, and he has no time for formsy-react right now. This looks like a source of frustration that could be eased by adding another owner to the npm project.\n\nOf course, this is @christianalfoni's project and he is at liberty to do as he wishes! If he has no more interest or time for this, or is unwilling or unable to grant others to push releases on npm, then forking is a natural progression. I'd rather It didn't come to this, though.\n\nAs for the name, how about `formsky-react` ;-)\n. Hello there, first thoughts:\n1. Automatic validation:\n   1. `validateOnChange`: I guess if this is `true` it would be the same as now, where validation is run on `setValue`, then it validates all values?\n   2. `validateOnInit`: If there is going to be a `validate` method on the form, maybe leaving it to the user to call that in `componentWillMount` is sufficient? Would that work?\n   \n   I think being able to opt-in or opt-out of  'automatic' validation for both scenarios would be okay.\n2. We don't use a component `validate` function in any of the FRC components, so changing this to `customValidate` (or similar) looks good to me, especially as this releases the `validate` function name to (presumably) run validations for that component only. We already have `isValidValue`, so need some clarification what the intent is here.\n   \n   I guess having a way of checking a value for validity at a component-level and returning validation messages (\u00e0 la `getErrorMessages()`) is missing at the moment.\n3. Yes, seems good. From a user perspective being able to call validate on components and the form as-a-whole is probably an expected use-case.\n. Also see: https://github.com/erikras/redux-form/issues/735\n. I think something like @zimt28's defensive fix is the way to go; changing `getValue` to return an empty string wouldn't be useful for components that don't expect a \"texty\" type of value.\n\nIf you're passing the `getValue()` value directly to your form control element, you could set a `defaultProp` of `''` (empty string) for `value` in your component?\n. Is this is a warning in both production and development mode? Does it still work on production mode? I'll look into this, of course, but apart from the warning is anything actually \"seriously broken\" in production mode?\n. Hi @martinhbramwell, thanks for the detail. It's pretty easy to reproduce. I've added an issue [over here](https://github.com/twisty/formsy-react-components/issues/80). This should be okay to close here, I think.\n. Actually, I think that code block a child of the **isValid** heading? Also, `getErrorMessages` returns an array, not a string, so the changed example wouldn't work anyway. \ud83d\ude3f \n. This looks good-to-go.\n. This isn't an issue for `formsy-react`. Opened new issue at https://github.com/twisty/formsy-react-components/issues/92.\r\n\r\nShould be okay to close this here.. This should do it:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\ncomponentDidMount(){\r\n   this.refs.nameInput.element.focus();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee: https://github.com/twisty/formsy-react-components/releases/tag/v0.8.0. The [php convention](http://php.net/manual/en/faq.html.php#faq.html.arrays) of creating an array when the control names are appended with `[]` might be something to consider. Although, I can see this getting pretty hairy with `Formsy.reset` where there are no named keys. Other options might be something like dot notation. \r\n\r\nAlso, in php, the current behaviour (last control with 'name' value clobbers all previous?) is sometimes used for patterns like:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"foo\" value=\"my default value\">\r\n<input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"foo\" checked=\"false\" value=\"my overridden value\">\r\n```. From the [API docs](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/API.md#validators):\r\n```jsx\r\n<MyInputComponent name=\"password\"/>\r\n<MyInputComponent name=\"repeated_password\" validations=\"equalsField:password\"/>\r\n```. Hi, `isSaving` and `isDirty` aren't part of `formsy-react`. Can you share some code?. This is probably due to a cut-and-paste from the project Readme ([see mention of `someDep` here](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/15493dce67433746391f4eb42c7f994b72cf5df9/README.md#how-to-use)). Maybe we should just have a `console.log` instead? Then the example would run without error.. `formsy-react` doesn't ship with any form controls, so this is an implementation detail of the input component that *you* create. So, you can use an uncontrolled input (`defaultValue`) in your component if you like. Just be sure to call the `formsy-react` methods `setValue` and `getValue` when appropriate.. Is this just a matter of adding ` || ^16.0.0` to the peerDependencies?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/ebd84bb02613b355a02fd3e3cffb9d6dcd46b500/package.json#L47\r\n\r\nThat should be okay for the upcoming 1.0.x release, but the 0.x releases use mixins \u2013 are they supported in React 16?. The current release of the beta on npm has React v15 listed as a dependency. If you upgrade your app to React v16, two versions of React are loaded and chaos ensues.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/998e2be44f4dcf3c49162244a4ef9e813af6f5c3/package.json\r\n\r\nAs this has already been fixed on the beta branch, is there any word on pushing a new release to npm?. Hi @aliogaili, (Speaking as the maintainer of the `formsy-react-components` package). I'm not keen to support forks of `formsy-react` right now.\r\n\r\nI agree the stuttered release pattern of `formsy-react` is frustrating, especially when we want to test with the latest shiny new React. But there is some nice stuff on the beta branch that seems like it could reboot this project, and I'd like to support that before switching to or otherwise supporting forks.\r\n\r\nNote: I'm not passing any judgment or expressing a preference about any forks here. It's just easier for consumers of `formsy-react-components` to couple with the `formsy-react` mothership.. @aliogaili The reason react 15 is getting installed again is that the beta published to npm has react 15 listed as a **`dependency`**. It should be a **`peerDependency`**. This was fixed on the beta branch over a month ago, but there hasn't been a new beta release pushed to npm since the fix.\r\n\r\n\"I know!\", you might think. \"I'll just install it straight from the github repo!\". Well, this does work, but takes a bit of twiddling. You may not get the built release files (the `lib` folder doesn't exist in the repo, and for some reason `yarn` wasn't transcoding them on install, YMMV):\r\n\r\nThis installs the latest version of the beta branch, transcodes the source, then removes any `devDependencies`.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nyarn add https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react#beta\r\ncd ./node_modules/formsy-react\r\nyarn install\r\nyarn install --production --ignore-scripts\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think you'll still get a warning about the react peer dependency, but it should run okay.. Hi @aliogaili, I think technically it's all installed properly, but I think those errors are because the alpha 7 of `formsy-react-components` doesn't support the tip of the `formsy-react` beta branch. (It looks like `Formsy.Form` has gone away).\r\n\r\nI've got an alpha ready to go that fixes this, but would prefer to wait for a new release from this repo.\r\n I'm not keen on documenting the process of depending on this branch, which won't be fun.\r\n\r\nI'm hesitant to call out the batsignal for @aesopwolf or another maintainer, but it would really help to get a response or an ETA on this.. Is the `<Input >` that you're using from `formsy-react-components`? If so, is it from the alpha?. I think @dprentis is right, the `formnovalidate` attribute is only allowed on submit and image input types. So if it's present on the default button for the form, native validation is skipped. If `formnovalidate` is not present on the default button, then a `novalidate` attribute on the form element comes into play.\n\nFrom what I can see, adding `formNoValidate` to other inputs (as shown in the API documentation) has no effect.\n\nNative validation shown:\n\n```\n<Formsy.Form>\n   <input name=\"foo\" formNoValidate required />\n   <input name=\"submit\" type=\"Submit\" />\n</Formsy.Form>\n```\n\nNative validation supressed:\n\n```\n<Formsy.Form>\n   <input name=\"foo\" required />\n   <input name=\"submit\" formNoValidate type=\"Submit\" />\n</Formsy.Form>\n```\n. Yes, that's the way to do it with `formNoValidate` on a submit button. We should change the docs to show this.\n. There's another case where `formNoValidate` works:\n\n``` xml\n<Formsy.Form>\n   <input type=\"search\" name=\"q\" formNoValidate required />\n</Formsy.Form>\n```\n\nI think what happens here is that in a form with a single \"texty\" type of input, that element also takes the role of the submit button, so `formNoValidate` applies and native validation is skipped.\n\nIn the docs, it maybe worth noting that formsy-react isn't performing any \"special magic\", and provide a link to the html5 spec?\n. Also! Maybe we should whitelist the `noValidate` attribute on the form element?\n. @colinmccann In FRC, there is a File component. You should use that instead!\n\nSee [release notes for 0.4.0](https://github.com/twisty/formsy-react-components/releases/tag/v0.4.0) for a bit more detail.\n\nThe `C:\\fakepath` is added by your browser.\n. There's an interesting approach using [the `-webkit-autofill` selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/%3A-webkit-autofill) that may be worth examining. See: https://github.com/appsforartists/gravel/commit/d868d68559047199dd53860c874dad9bf9a63cf3\n\nSee also:\n- https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/1159\n- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11708092/detecting-browser-autofill/\n- https://github.com/tbosch/autofill-event\n. I suppose it could be technically possible to ditch the `required` prop, but I think it's there for convenience and discoverability...\n\nIt's a common UI pattern to present asterisks next to required fields, using the `isRequired()` function is perhaps \"cleaner\" than inspecting a component's validators to work out if the component is required or not (particularly as presenting a \"required\" indicator in the UI is often separate from presenting other validation errors).\n\nAlso, as there is a `required` attribute for HTML5 form controls, developers coming to this library are already likely to be familiar with setting a `required` attribute separately to other input constraints (specific input types, validations, etc.).\n. Hello there,\n\nSome good stuff in this release, thanks!\n\nI've been having trouble getting the multiple error messages to show (code below). The validations seem to be running correctly, but it seems to only return the generic \"fallback\" error message.\n\n``` javascript\nvar React = require('react');\nvar ReactDOM = require('react-dom');\nvar Formsy = require('formsy-react');\n\nvar ValidationTest = React.createClass({\n\n    mixins: [Formsy.Mixin],\n\n    renderErrors() {\n        var errorMessages = this.getErrorMessages() || [];\n        return errorMessages.map((message, key) => {\n              return (\n                  <p key={key}>Error: {message}</p>\n            );\n        });\n    },\n\n    onChange(e) {\n        this.setValue(e.currentTarget.value);\n    },\n\n    render() {\n        return (\n            <div>\n                {this.isRequired() ? '* ' : ''}\n                <input\n                    type=\"text\"\n                    value={this.getValue()}\n                    onChange={this.onChange}\n                    required={this.props.required}\n                />\n                {this.renderErrors()}\n            </div>\n        );\n    }\n\n });\n\nvar App = React.createClass({\n    render() {\n        return (\n            <Formsy.Form onSubmit={(model) => { console.log(model); }} noValidate>\n                <ValidationTest\n                    name=\"nesting[for][the][win]\"\n                    validations={{\n                        isEmail: true,\n                        maxLength: 8\n                    }}\n                    validationErrors={{\n                        isEmail: 'Is not an email address.',\n                        maxLength: 'Maximum length is 8.'\n                    }}\n                    validationError=\"Generic error.\"\n                    required\n                />\n                <input type=\"submit\" />\n            </Formsy.Form>\n        )\n    }\n});\n\nReactDOM.render(<App/>, document.body);\n```\n. @Semigradsky super!\n\nHere's an edge case for you! When the component is set as 'required', and the value is empty (i.e `showRequired()` is true) `getErrorMessages()` returns `[undefined]`. It feels like it should return `[]`.\n\nThe work-around is to check for `showRequired()` before showing error messages, but the current behaviour doesn't seem intuitive. What do you think?\n. You could just modify the user input before passing it to `setValue`. Presumably you're calling `setValue` in an `onBlur` callback? Something like this could work:\n\n``` javascript\nvar Url = React.createClass({\n\n    mixins: [Formsy.Mixin],\n\n    onChange(e) {\n        this.setState({displayValue: e.currentTarget.value});\n    },\n\n    onBlur(e) {\n        var value = e.currentTarget.value;\n        if (value.indexOf('http://') !== 0) {\n            value = 'http://' + value;\n        }\n        this.setState({displayValue: value});\n        this.setValue(value);\n    },\n\n    render() {\n        return (\n            <div>\n                <input\n                    type=\"text\"\n                    value={this.state.displayValue}\n                    onChange={this.onChange}\n                    onBlur={this.onBlur}\n                />\n            </div>\n        );\n    }\n\n});\n```\n. Hi, validating after blur is possible, delaying running validations until submit isn't possible at the moment.\n- Validate email after blur: #139\n- Add optional prop 'validateOnSubmit' to Form component: #147\n\nMaybe you could work around this by suppressing the rendering the validation warnings? For example, you could set a property on the form components that dictates whether to render the validation errors, and change this property on `onValidSubmit` and `onInvalidSubmit` callback.\n. It's not possible with the currently released version, but will be coming in a future release.\n\nSee https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/issues/158.\n. In [twisty/formsy-react-components](https://github.com/twisty/formsy-react-components/) we set a `validatePristine` property, and then test for it before rendering error messages etc.:\n\n``` jsx\n    renderErrorMessage: function() {\n        if (!this.showErrors()) {\n            return '';\n        }\n        var errorMessages = this.getErrorMessages() || [];\n        return errorMessages.map((message, key) => {\n            return (\n                <span key={key} className=\"help-block validation-message\">{message}</span>\n            );\n        });\n    },\n\n    showErrors: function() {\n        if (this.isPristine() === true) {\n            if (this.props.validatePristine === false) {\n                return false;\n            }\n        }\n        return (this.isValid() === false);\n    }\n```\n\nSee: https://github.com/twisty/formsy-react-components/blob/68d5fb86bdaf9fb2cd8000c51b4269bd8049d3ab/src/mixins/component.js#L51-L70\n. `Form Input requires a name property when used`\n\nI think this message could be clearer. For example, you may have an formsy component called `Input` in the form, but the error could be triggered by any of the other formsy components in the form.\n\nMaybe the following would be better?\n\n`Formsy components require a name prop`\n\nCan send a PR if you like.\n. I may be wrong, but I think @Semigradsky already has write access to this repo?\n\nThere is enough improvement to justify a new release, but only @christianalfoni has the power to push releases on npm, and he has no time for formsy-react right now. This looks like a source of frustration that could be eased by adding another owner to the npm project.\n\nOf course, this is @christianalfoni's project and he is at liberty to do as he wishes! If he has no more interest or time for this, or is unwilling or unable to grant others to push releases on npm, then forking is a natural progression. I'd rather It didn't come to this, though.\n\nAs for the name, how about `formsky-react` ;-)\n. Hello there, first thoughts:\n1. Automatic validation:\n   1. `validateOnChange`: I guess if this is `true` it would be the same as now, where validation is run on `setValue`, then it validates all values?\n   2. `validateOnInit`: If there is going to be a `validate` method on the form, maybe leaving it to the user to call that in `componentWillMount` is sufficient? Would that work?\n   \n   I think being able to opt-in or opt-out of  'automatic' validation for both scenarios would be okay.\n2. We don't use a component `validate` function in any of the FRC components, so changing this to `customValidate` (or similar) looks good to me, especially as this releases the `validate` function name to (presumably) run validations for that component only. We already have `isValidValue`, so need some clarification what the intent is here.\n   \n   I guess having a way of checking a value for validity at a component-level and returning validation messages (\u00e0 la `getErrorMessages()`) is missing at the moment.\n3. Yes, seems good. From a user perspective being able to call validate on components and the form as-a-whole is probably an expected use-case.\n. Also see: https://github.com/erikras/redux-form/issues/735\n. I think something like @zimt28's defensive fix is the way to go; changing `getValue` to return an empty string wouldn't be useful for components that don't expect a \"texty\" type of value.\n\nIf you're passing the `getValue()` value directly to your form control element, you could set a `defaultProp` of `''` (empty string) for `value` in your component?\n. Is this is a warning in both production and development mode? Does it still work on production mode? I'll look into this, of course, but apart from the warning is anything actually \"seriously broken\" in production mode?\n. Hi @martinhbramwell, thanks for the detail. It's pretty easy to reproduce. I've added an issue [over here](https://github.com/twisty/formsy-react-components/issues/80). This should be okay to close here, I think.\n. Actually, I think that code block a child of the **isValid** heading? Also, `getErrorMessages` returns an array, not a string, so the changed example wouldn't work anyway. \ud83d\ude3f \n. This looks good-to-go.\n. This isn't an issue for `formsy-react`. Opened new issue at https://github.com/twisty/formsy-react-components/issues/92.\r\n\r\nShould be okay to close this here.. This should do it:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\ncomponentDidMount(){\r\n   this.refs.nameInput.element.focus();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee: https://github.com/twisty/formsy-react-components/releases/tag/v0.8.0. The [php convention](http://php.net/manual/en/faq.html.php#faq.html.arrays) of creating an array when the control names are appended with `[]` might be something to consider. Although, I can see this getting pretty hairy with `Formsy.reset` where there are no named keys. Other options might be something like dot notation. \r\n\r\nAlso, in php, the current behaviour (last control with 'name' value clobbers all previous?) is sometimes used for patterns like:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"foo\" value=\"my default value\">\r\n<input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"foo\" checked=\"false\" value=\"my overridden value\">\r\n```. From the [API docs](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/API.md#validators):\r\n```jsx\r\n<MyInputComponent name=\"password\"/>\r\n<MyInputComponent name=\"repeated_password\" validations=\"equalsField:password\"/>\r\n```. Hi, `isSaving` and `isDirty` aren't part of `formsy-react`. Can you share some code?. This is probably due to a cut-and-paste from the project Readme ([see mention of `someDep` here](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/15493dce67433746391f4eb42c7f994b72cf5df9/README.md#how-to-use)). Maybe we should just have a `console.log` instead? Then the example would run without error.. `formsy-react` doesn't ship with any form controls, so this is an implementation detail of the input component that *you* create. So, you can use an uncontrolled input (`defaultValue`) in your component if you like. Just be sure to call the `formsy-react` methods `setValue` and `getValue` when appropriate.. Is this just a matter of adding ` || ^16.0.0` to the peerDependencies?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/ebd84bb02613b355a02fd3e3cffb9d6dcd46b500/package.json#L47\r\n\r\nThat should be okay for the upcoming 1.0.x release, but the 0.x releases use mixins \u2013 are they supported in React 16?. The current release of the beta on npm has React v15 listed as a dependency. If you upgrade your app to React v16, two versions of React are loaded and chaos ensues.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/998e2be44f4dcf3c49162244a4ef9e813af6f5c3/package.json\r\n\r\nAs this has already been fixed on the beta branch, is there any word on pushing a new release to npm?. Hi @aliogaili, (Speaking as the maintainer of the `formsy-react-components` package). I'm not keen to support forks of `formsy-react` right now.\r\n\r\nI agree the stuttered release pattern of `formsy-react` is frustrating, especially when we want to test with the latest shiny new React. But there is some nice stuff on the beta branch that seems like it could reboot this project, and I'd like to support that before switching to or otherwise supporting forks.\r\n\r\nNote: I'm not passing any judgment or expressing a preference about any forks here. It's just easier for consumers of `formsy-react-components` to couple with the `formsy-react` mothership.. @aliogaili The reason react 15 is getting installed again is that the beta published to npm has react 15 listed as a **`dependency`**. It should be a **`peerDependency`**. This was fixed on the beta branch over a month ago, but there hasn't been a new beta release pushed to npm since the fix.\r\n\r\n\"I know!\", you might think. \"I'll just install it straight from the github repo!\".

But that's my idea for how this could be implemented.\n\nFinally, dot notation could be used on the array like this:\n\n```\n< MyInput name=\"addresses[0].street\" value=\"Some Street\"/>\n```\n\nWhich would result in an object like this:\n\n```\n{\n    \"addresses\": [{street: \"Some Street\"}]\n}\n```\n. Upon further research, it looks like the jQuery ajax function I am using to post data to the server expects associative data and parses it into a hierarchical JSON object.\n\nThe syntax is like this:\n\n```\n< MyInput name=\"addresses[0][street]\" value=\"123 Some Street\"/>\n< MyInput name=\"addresses[1][street]\" value=\"456 Different Street\"/>\n```\n\nwhich resolves to:\n\n```\n{\n    addresses:\n        [{\"street\": \"123 Some Street\"}, \n        {\"street\": \"456 Different Street\"}]\n}\n```\n\nHopefully this is helpful to those trying to get hierarchical forms working with arrays - and possibly the development of this project.\n.

I'd like to add my voice on the array issue.\n\nThe syntax could be something like this:\n\n```\n< MyInput name=\"addresses[0]\" value=\"123 Some Street\" />\n< MyInput name=\"addresses[1]\" value=\"456 Different Street\" />\n```\n\nSo right now that results in this kind of data:\n\n```\n{\n    \"addresses[0]\": \"123 Some Street\",\n    \"addresses[1]\": \"456 Different Street\"\n}\n```\n\nIt would be better if it added the data as an array like this:\n\n```\n{\n    \"addresses\":\n        [\"123 Some Street\", \n        \"456 Different Street\"]\n}\n```\n\nAnd of course the primary use case for something like this would be to add a series of objects to an array with something like this:\n\n```\n< MyInput name={\"addresses[\" + index + \"]\"} />\n```\n\nIt isn't the most convenient syntax to write in this case, so maybe there is a better way of writing it. But that's my idea for how this could be implemented.\n\nFinally, dot notation could be used on the array like this:\n\n```\n< MyInput name=\"addresses[0].street\" value=\"Some Street\"/>\n```\n\nWhich would result in an object like this:\n\n```\n{\n    \"addresses\": [{street: \"Some Street\"}]\n}\n```\n.

    "ericdfields": "I'm dealing w/ the same data structure for nested objects (rails api). I built a Formsy form that handles formatting of the data quite well. The following is not pretty, nor well-tested, but it handles nested objects (at least one-level deep) just fine, and minimizes the amount of boilerplate you have to write.\n\nMy lib:\n\n``` javascript\nvar React = require('react')\nvar Formsy = require('formsy-react');\n\nexport class FormFor extends React.Component {\n\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props)\n    this.formatChild =

I came up with a workaround that goes agaisnt recommended usage but it works:\n\n```\n  render() {\n    const { showRequired, showError, getValue, name, title, className, isPristine, type, hasValue, getErrorMessage, validationError } = this.props;\n    const hasError = (!isPristine() && (showError() || !hasValue()));\n    const errorMessage = hasError ? validationError : null;\n    return (\n      <div className={cx('form-group', className, {'required': showRequired(), 'has-error': hasError})}>\n        <label htmlFor={name}>{title}</label>\n        <input\n          className=\"form-control\"\n          type={type || 'text'}\n          name={name}\n          id={name}\n          onChange={this.changeValue}\n          value={getValue()}\n          checked={type === 'checkbox' && this.getValue() ?

I guess this is a dupe of the many other similar issues others are having.\n. I guess I was confused by the behavior of required fields (required is what I was looking for not no minlength:1). Required fields won't display their error until you try submitting the form which is fine. The only problem is if you disable the submit button until the form is valid, the user might not realize which form elements need to be filled out. \n. +1\n\nSeems to be a race condition.

I came up with a workaround that goes agaisnt recommended usage but it works:\n\n```\n  render() {\n    const { showRequired, showError, getValue, name, title, className, isPristine, type, hasValue, getErrorMessage, validationError } = this.props;\n    const hasError = (!isPristine() && (showError() || !hasValue()));\n    const errorMessage = hasError ? validationError : null;\n    return (\n      <div className={cx('form-group', className, {'required': showRequired(), 'has-error': hasError})}>\n        <label htmlFor={name}>{title}</label>\n        <input\n          className=\"form-control\"\n          type={type || 'text'}\n          name={name}\n          id={name}\n          onChange={this.changeValue}\n          value={getValue()}\n          checked={type === 'checkbox' && this.getValue() ? 'checked' : null}\n        />\n        <span className='validation-error'>{errorMessage}</span>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n\n```\n. I guess this is a dupe of the many other similar issues others are having.\n. I guess I was confused by the behavior of required fields (required is what I was looking for not no minlength:1). Required fields won't display their error until you try submitting the form which is fine. The only problem is if you disable the submit button until the form is valid, the user might not realize which form elements need to be filled out. \n. +1\n\nSeems to be a race condition. I have the following (mock) setup:\n\n```\n<ul>\n   {workExp.map(function(exp, index){\n      <li>\n         <Input name={\"work_exp[\" + index + \"].title\"} value={exp.title} />\n         <button onClick={removeWorkExp.bind(self, index)}>X</button>\n         {exp.skills.map(function(skill, subindex){\n            <Input name={\"work_exp[\" + index + \"].skills[\" + subindex + \"]\"} value={skill} />\n         })}\n     </li>\n   })}\n</ul>\n```\n\nWhen the user clicks X to remove a work experience, work_exp[0].title is unmounted first and validateForm is run too soon and is trying to validate this.inputs[\"work_exp[0].skills[0]\"] which also has been unmounted.\n\nThe error is on this line:\n\nhttps://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/src/main.js#L373\n\"Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'state' of undefined\"\n\nPerhaps we want that line to be more defensive?\n.

Closing as solved.\n. Yeah it's okay.  Would be nicer, obviously, if this was automatic.  What I do now is set an onClick event to update a temporary value on the class (i.e. onClick: function(e) { this.saveButton = e.currentTarget.innerText; }).\n\nI then test for and reset this.saveButton in my submit method.\n\nThanks for Formsy it's excellent; probably one of the best and most stable react components/libraries.\n. +1 for defaultValue - it would make it explicit what is happening - defaultValue always replaces pristine form data and value is always the latest edited version?  \n\nI also really need this now really, as a temporary fix can I call setPristine in the mean time if I know that to be the case?\n. That is not what I mean - here are the steps I expect to be able to happen.\n\n1) I load a form with some customer data from a Redux store/action.\n2) The form data is edited in various places\n3) One of the actions/edits loads other parts of the form and this causes data in the store to change, which causes data in the props to changes which updates data in the form.\n4) Under certain conditions I wish for the edited data to be overridden by these updated props.\n5) Obviously edits take precedence over prop changes, I guess this is correct...?\n\nMaybe in componentWillReceiveProps I can setValue on the ref of the relevant input.\n. Yep, this is exactly how I ended up doing things.  I have say it feels like a bit of a mess.  As I'm writing this I'm wondering if there is a form on change event that I should use instead...\n. I could do with this being merged - I'm loading lots of data into my forms and validating it means the form is \"changed\" which it obviously isn't.\n. This sounds amazing.

Here is how (uses Formsy React Components):\n\n``` js\n    var IPAddressOrHostnameInput = React.createClass({\n        mixins: [Formsy.Mixin, ComponentMixin],\n\n        getInitialState: function () {\n            return {\n                validationMessage: 'Invalid'\n            };\n        },\n\n        changeValue: function (event) {\n            this.setValue(event.currentTarget.value);\n        },\n\n        validate: function () {\n            var value = this.getValue();\n            console.log(value);\n            if (value === '' || value === undefined) {\n                this.setState({validationMessage: 'Invalid'});\n                return true; // is required should pick this up\n            } else {\n                var validIPRegexp = /^(([0-9]|[1-9][0-9]|1[0-9]{2}|2[0-4][0-9]|25[0-5])\\.){3}([0-9]|[1-9][0-9]|1[0-9]{2}|2[0-4][0-9]|25[0-5])$/,\n                    validHostnameRegexp = /^(([a-zA-Z0-9]|[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9\\-]*[a-zA-Z0-9])\\.)*([A-Za-z0-9]|[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9\\-]*[A-Za-z0-9])$/;\n\n                if (validIPRegexp.test(value)) {\n                    this.setState({validationMessage: 'Valid IP'});\n                    return true;\n                } else if (validHostnameRegexp.test(value)) {\n                    this.setState({validationMessage: 'Valid Hostname'});\n                    return true;\n                } else {\n                    this.setState({validationMessage: 'Invalid'});\n                    return false;\n                }\n            }\n        },\n\n        getDefaultProps: function () {\n            return {\n                type: 'text'\n            };\n        },\n\n        render: function() {\n\n            var element = this.renderElement();\n\n            if (this.getLayout() === 'elementOnly' || this.props.type === 'hidden') {\n                return element;\n            }\n\n            var warningIcon = '';\n            if (this.showErrors()) {\n                warningIcon = (\n                    <Icon symbol=\"remove\" className=\"form-control-feedback\" />\n                );\n            }\n\n            return (\n                <Row\n                    label={this.props.label}\n                    required={this.isRequired()}\n                    hasErrors={this.showErrors()}\n                    layout={this.getLayout()}\n                >\n                    <div className=\"input-group\">\n                        {element}\n                        <span className=\"input-group-addon\">\n                            {warningIcon}\n                            {this.state.validationMessage}\n                        </span>\n                    </div>\n\n                    {this.renderHelp()}\n                    {this.renderErrorMessage()}\n                </Row>\n            );\n        },\n\n        renderElement: function() {\n            var className = 'form-control';\n            if (['file', 'range'].indexOf(this.props.type) !== -1) {\n                className = null;\n            }\n            return (\n                <input\n                    className={className}\n                    {...this.props}\n                    label={null}\n                    value={this.getValue()}\n                    onChange={this.changeValue}\n                    disabled={this.isFormDisabled() || this.props.disabled}\n                />\n            );\n        }\n    });\n```\n. Closing as solved.\n. Yeah it's okay.  Would be nicer, obviously, if this was automatic.  What I do now is set an onClick event to update a temporary value on the class (i.e. onClick: function(e) { this.saveButton = e.currentTarget.innerText; }).\n\nI then test for and reset this.saveButton in my submit method.\n\nThanks for Formsy it's excellent; probably one of the best and most stable react components/libraries.\n. +1 for defaultValue - it would make it explicit what is happening - defaultValue always replaces pristine form data and value is always the latest edited version?  \n\nI also really need this now really, as a temporary fix can I call setPristine in the mean time if I know that to be the case?\n. That is not what I mean - here are the steps I expect to be able to happen.\n\n1) I load a form with some customer data from a Redux store/action.\n2) The form data is edited in various places\n3) One of the actions/edits loads other parts of the form and this causes data in the store to change, which causes data in the props to changes which updates data in the form.\n4) Under certain conditions I wish for the edited data to be overridden by these updated props.\n5) Obviously edits take precedence over prop changes, I guess this is correct...?\n\nMaybe in componentWillReceiveProps I can setValue on the ref of the relevant input.\n. Yep, this is exactly how I ended up doing things.  I have say it feels like a bit of a mess.  As I'm writing this I'm wondering if there is a form on change event that I should use instead...\n. I could do with this being merged - I'm loading lots of data into my forms and validating it means the form is \"changed\" which it obviously isn't.\n. ",

    "mindcruzer": "I'm also in need of this. If you try to force re-validation in `componentWillReceiveProps()` with `this.props._validate(this);` it causes an infinite loop because the validate function causes a re-render of the component, which calls `componentWillReceiveProps()` again, and so on.\n\nThe way to do this that won't result in an infinite loop is to only re-validate on a condition that will be true on the first render, but not on subsequent renders.

If you use formsy 0.14.1 it should work. Formsy 0.17 I see also has an alternative solution to this using decorators. \n. @eriknyk You need to declare what parts of the context you're going to use in your component (see [here](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/context.html)), but you should probably just use [this](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/master/API.md#formsydecorator). \n. I'm also in need of this. If you try to force re-validation in `componentWillReceiveProps()` with `this.props._validate(this);` it causes an infinite loop because the validate function causes a re-render of the component, which calls `componentWillReceiveProps()` again, and so on.\n\nThe way to do this that won't result in an infinite loop is to only re-validate on a condition that will be true on the first render, but not on subsequent renders. In my case I am altering the `required` prop so in `componentWillReceiveProps()`:\n\n``` javascript\ncomponentWillReceiveProps: function (newProps) {\n    if (newProps.required != this.props.required) {\n        // force re-validation because the validation requirements have changed\n        this.props._validate(this); \n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou could do the same thing with `newProps.validations != this.props.validations`. \n. I would like to see official support for something like this as well. I have a project using Formsy that I am porting to TypeScript, and the mixin approach is not ideal.

Feel free to close the issue if you agree with me on this.\n. ",

No, setvalue validate all the form, that's why all inputs are rerendered.\n. I made a test by commenting this.validateForm  [here](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/blob/4279dd59a20fd0b27690e0dd38569f63ee775914/src/main.js#L261) and it became perfectly fast but that's not surprising, maybe launching regex validations on 50 inputs eat performance.\n.

Here is the version that works with React 0.14\n\n``` jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport Formsy from 'formsy-react';\n\nimport BaseComponent from 'components/BaseComponent';\n\n/**\n * The base component that binds all Formsy Mixin methods so that they can be extended by es6 Formsy components.\n */\nexport default class FormComponent extends BaseConnector {\n  static defaultProps = {\n    validationError: '',\n    validationErrors: {}\n  };\n\n  static contextTypes = {\n    formsy: React.PropTypes.object,\n  };\n\n  static ignoredMixinMethods = [\n    'getDefaultProps',\n    'getInitialState',\n    'componentWillMount',\n    'componentWillUnmount'\n  ];\n\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n\n    this.state = Object.assign(this.state || {}, Formsy.Mixin.getInitialState.bind(this)());\n    Object.getOwnPropertyNames(Formsy.Mixin).forEach((method) => {\n      if (typeof Formsy.Mixin[method] !== 'function') {\n        return;\n      }\n\n      if (FormComponent.ignoredMixinMethods.indexOf(method) !== -1) {\n        return;\n      }\n      this[method] = Formsy.Mixin[method].bind(this);\n    });\n  }\n\n  componentWillMount() {\n    Formsy.Mixin.componentWillMount.bind(this)();\n  }\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    Formsy.Mixin.componentWillUnmount.bind(this)();\n  }\n}\n```\n. FWIW, My team, is actively migrating away from Formsy to redux-form. We have tried to get the most out of Formsy. However redux has taken over our world, and redux-form solves some of the weird data cycles we see with Formsy and we find it easier to build form components with it.\n. ",

    "clayne11": "A much better solution to this is to separate out the Formsy dependency into a higher-order-component rather than a mixin.\n\nWhen you need to use a component within a Formsy.Form, wrap the component with the higher-order-component and use it in the form. When using it otherwise, use the plain component.\n\nThis is also a great solution for testing where you can test the component outside of the Formsy context. \n.

A much better solution to this is to separate out the Formsy dependency into a higher-order-component rather than a mixin.\n\nWhen you need to use a component within a Formsy.Form, wrap the component with the higher-order-component and use it in the form. When using it otherwise, use the plain component.\n\nThis is also a great solution for testing where you can test the component outside of the Formsy context. \n. Formsy uses the context to pass down attachToForm / detachFromForm to its children. As long as the context chain doesn't get broken you can put form children as deeply down the render tree as you'd like.\n\nOne thing to be aware of is that if any component in the tree returns false from shouldComponentUpdate, then it's children will not receive context updates.\n. It's not really documented. I figured it out by reading the code.\n. +1 - I would love this.\n. You should never mutate state, especially when using redux. That's one of redux's core principles.\n\nOne of the huge advantages to storing form state in the redux store is conditional forms. When the form items you display are dependent on values that are currently filled out in the form it is easy to determine what to show when the form state comes in from props. When you have to pull state out of the components or store a copy of the state in the current component you're working on things get messy and extremely coupled.\n. +1\n. The HOC passes all props through to the component it is wrapping, so you can simply use a callback ref to achieve your goal.\n\nhttps://facebook.github.io/react/docs/more-about-refs.html#the-ref-callback-attribute\n.

We could extend the reset function too, so it can run w/o running the validation.

So if I understand correctly I`isFormSubmitted()` that on the input component? Not a big issue but it is a little bit annoying on large forms.\r\n\r\nAt the moment I am working around the issue by not setting the model via `reset()` but on each individual input. As you would understand it would be a lot easier if I could just call `reset(model, false)` eg. to populate the without running any validation.\r\n\r\nJust to give you a little more context. The form I built is a confirmation form that confirms some final details before handing out some information. In this form some information might already be filled out in another part of the application but others fields might not have.\r\n. I just created a PR https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/pull/420  for this. \r\n\r\n\r\nMight be a better way to set the initial form data.\r\n\r\nI am actually using formsy-react-components.\r\n. That is alright. As I said I have got a workaround in my app for now. I will wait until we can implement something like this before I migrate my other forms to Formsy.. We could extend the reset function too, so it can run w/o running the validation.  I thought it would make more sense having a seperate method to set the data since we are not always resetting (e.g. data loaded remotely).. You can create a custom validation rule with a regular expression. \n\n> On 27 Feb 2017, at 8:59 pm, Jacky Lee <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n> \n> Is there a way to include 3 validation checks for the password field?\n> \n> minLength serves its purpose, but isNumeric only allows the entire field to only be numerical, and there isn't an uppercase API method.\n> \n> Uppercase seems overkill, but is there a hacky way to get the validations with at least 1 numerical character?\n> \n> \u2014\n> You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.\n> \n.

This might be trivial question, but how are you guys installing the beta version? are using the beta tag from npm?\r\n\r\nWhen I do npm install formsy-react@beta npm downloads the package.json file below which has   \"react\": \"^15.0.0\" as dependency, then npm will install react15 under the formsy-react node_modules folder which will get loaded at the client and result in the equeueCallback exception..am I missing something here? \r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"_from\": \"formsy-react@beta\",\r\n  \"_id\": \"formsy-react@1.0.0\",\r\n  \"_inBundle\": false,\r\n  \"_integrity\": \"sha512-anFitmAKhZ9XK7lfkzxy1ugl+Tyn7mR3tkFsI8KkLCKRUL2nY8hpUWvTgczTaqzvqROc95+bCRuWoJ79ZyJqtA==\",\r\n  \"_location\": \"/formsy-react\",\r\n  \"_phantomChildren\": {\r\n    \"create-react-class\": \"15.6.2\",\r\n    \"fbjs\": \"0.8.16\",\r\n    \"loose-envify\": \"1.3.1\",\r\n    \"object-assign\": \"4.1.1\",\r\n    \"prop-types\": \"15.6.0\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"_requested\": {\r\n    \"type\": \"tag\",\r\n    \"registry\": true,\r\n    \"raw\": \"formsy-react@beta\",\r\n    \"name\": \"formsy-react\",\r\n    \"escapedName\": \"formsy-react\",\r\n    \"rawSpec\": \"beta\",\r\n    \"saveSpec\": null,\r\n    \"fetchSpec\": \"beta\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"_requiredBy\": [\r\n    \"#USER\",\r\n    \"/\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"_resolved\": \"https://registry.npmjs.org/formsy-react/-/formsy-react-1.0.0.tgz\",\r\n  \"_shasum\": \"305d4f1da8144badbe9847b1a9b509dc00a77881\",\r\n  \"_spec\": \"formsy-react@beta\",\r\n  \"_where\": \"/Users/Alawi/Development/Meronex/Applications/Products/residentsClub/app\",\r\n  \"author\": {\r\n    \"name\": \"Christian Alfoni\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"bugs\": {\r\n    \"url\": \"https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/issues\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"bundleDependencies\": false,\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"form-data-to-object\": \"^0.2.0\",\r\n    \"hoist-non-react-statics\": \"^2.2.1\",\r\n    \"react\": \"^15.0.0\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"deprecated\": false,\r\n  \"description\": \"A form input builder and validator for React JS\",\r\n  \"devDependencies\": {\r\n    \"babel-cli\": \"^6.6.5\",\r\n    \"babel-loader\": \"^6.2.4\",\r\n    \"babel-preset-es2015\": \"^6.6.0\",\r\n    \"babel-preset-react\": \"^6.5.0\",\r\n    \"babel-preset-stage-2\": \"^6.5.0\",\r\n    \"create-react-class\": \"^15.6.0\",\r\n    \"jsdom\": \"^6.5.1\",\r\n    \"nodeunit\": \"^0.9.1\",\r\n    \"prop-types\": \"^15.5.10\",\r\n    \"react\": \"^15.0.0\",\r\n    \"react-addons-pure-render-mixin\": \"^15.0.0\",\r\n    \"react-addons-test-utils\": \"^15.0.0\",\r\n    \"react-dom\": \"^15.0.0\",\r\n    \"sinon\": \"^1.17.3\",\r\n    \"webpack\": \"^1.12.14\",\r\n    \"webpack-dev-server\": \"^1.14.1\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"homepage\": \"https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react#readme\",\r\n  \"keywords\": [\r\n    \"react\",\r\n    \"form\",\r\n    \"forms\",\r\n    \"validation\",\r\n    \"react-component\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"license\": \"MIT\",\r\n  \"main\": \"lib/index.js\",\r\n  \"name\": \"formsy-react\",\r\n  \"repository\": {\r\n    \"type\": \"git\",\r\n    \"url\": \"git+https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react.git\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"build\": \"NODE_ENV=production webpack -p --config webpack.production.config.js\",\r\n    \"examples\": \"webpack-dev-server --config examples/webpack.config.js --content-base examples\",\r\n    \"prepublish\": \"babel ./src/ -d ./lib/\",\r\n    \"test\": \"babel-node testrunner\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n. If you download the tar referenced by the [resolved url](https://registry.npmjs.org/formsy-react/-/formsy-react-1.0.0.tgz) then you'll get a package.json that has react 15 referenced as a dependency (and not peer dependency). \r\n\r\nMoving react from dependency to peer dependency was done by the [last commit here](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/commit/42e39cbc8fa14333374c56b38b9b9bf389916991) and it has not been published to npm  yet, which explains why I keep getting the older package.json with the react 15 as dependency. \r\n\r\nSo how are you folks using the last commit? . Thank you so much @twisty ! that's what I'm looking for, it was a bit confusing for me, but now it's clear. . @twisty I've following the steps you gave and I keep getting `uncaughtException: Cannot find module 'formsy-react`\r\n\r\nFormsy-react is in the package.json and in the node_modules folders but the app doesn't start and I receive this exception :( . I just downloaded the version currently published on the NPM registry, patched it to remove the react dependency and installed it locally, it's working, for now.\r\n\r\nBut I really hope we can hear soon from the maintainer(s) of formsy-react and we get a newer version on NPM. This is a very useful and well designed library and really not much effort needs to get it up and running. I'm sure more people will run through this issue as they start updating to React 16, so the sooner this get resolved the better. Hopefully, the batsignal does it job :) . @Semigradsky I see you made contributions to formsy-react, and as it stand it's currently blocking the adoption of React 16 because [the last comment](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react/pull/473) has not been published to NPM.\r\n\r\n@twisty there are two forks of this library due to the inactivity here:\r\n\r\n1. [formsy-react-2](https://github.com/maccuaa/formsy-react-2) which has been created by the @maccuaa who is also maintaining [formsy-mui](https://github.com/maccuaa/formsy-mui)\r\n2. [formsy-react-es6](https://github.com/track0x1/formsy-react/blob/v15-version/package.json) forked by @track0x1 who is also maintaining [formsy-react-native](https://github.com/track0x1/formsy-react-native) \r\n\r\nI think both of those forks exist due to the lack of activity here at the moment. I'm blocked from publishing my project because I'm using [formsy-react-components](https://github.com/twisty/formsy-react-components) which is depending on this version of formsy-react and it's conflicting with React 16. Thus can you please consider aligning with one of the two libraries (or even maintaining your own fork if you wish) until we can get some traction here so we can at least move forward with React 16? \r\n\r\nThanks!. The other repo doesn't seem to work with [formsy-react-components ](https://github.com/twisty/formsy-react-components) I hope this repo get updated.\r\n\r\n@twisty what's your take on this?. Thanks @twisty, I also think that's the right path. Looking forward for more releases from `formsy-react `and `formsy-react-components` :) . I'm running into the following error when I update to React 16:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"794\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-10-06 at 7 17 25 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1675307/31261700-c1704ea8-aa66-11e7-80ad-149c592c4dc0.png\">\r\n\r\nAny idea on what might be causing this?\r\n.
