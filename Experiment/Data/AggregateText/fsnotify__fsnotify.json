    "nathany": "With [internal package support](http://golang.org/s/go14internal) in Go 1.4, it's possible that go/cmd could use fsnotify in Go 1.5 but not yet provide os/fsnotify. It just depends on whether or not fsnotify is ready to take on the [Go 1 compatibility guarantee](https://golang.org/doc/go1compat) at that time.\n\n/cc @rsc @davecheney \n. There are some challenges to getting fsnotify into the standard library.\n- Designing a suitable (low-level) API.\n- ~~Not depending on C code.~~\n  \n  FSEvents (#11), at least in the [current implementation](https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsevents) contains C code.\n  \n  > \"The goal of the dev.cc branch is to eliminate all C code from the Go libraries and then remove the C compiler that we have been maintaining as part of the toolchain.\" - @rsc http://golang.org/s/dev.cc\n  \n  ~~Unless this only applies to [C code like this](http://dave.cheney.net/2013/09/07/how-to-include-c-code-in-your-go-package) and not cgo.~~\n  \n  The net package uses C code, so this comment is probably specific to the libraries that are part of runtime. My bad.\n- The syscall dependency. Syscall is frozen as of Go 1.3, with any additions being made to [x/sys](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/sys). So far fsnotify doesn't require anything new in x/sys, but if it ever does, the necessary portions will need to become internal packages of fsnotify (to avoid having stdlib depend on x/sys).\n. Given the improvements to tools to vendor code (GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT) and support for internal/ packages, I see less value in trying to bring this into the standard library. If the go tool or godoc need to use fsnotify, it can be copied in as an internal package.\n\nMaybe an x/ package that uses Gerrit, the builders, and the CLA.\n\nOr if maintained as an independent package, perhaps the BSD license should be tweaked and the CLA requirement dropped.\n. @matthias-stone reproduced the issue:\n\n> So, looking at this in GDB the following squirrelly behaviour occurs: breaking and continuing the code \n> clears the leaked file descriptors.\n> \n> Executed with \n> \n> ``` console\n> gdb --args ./fsnotify.test -test.cpu=1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\n> -test.v -test.run=TestFsnotifyDeleteWatchedDir\n> ```\n> \n> Sample of leaked file descriptor - note the `anon_inode:inotify`\n> \n> ```\n> total 0\n> lrwx------ 1 matthias users 64 Jun 21 20:17 0 -> /dev/pts/40\n> lrwx------ 1 matthias users 64 Jun 21 20:17 1 -> /dev/pts/40\n> lr-x------ 1 matthias users 64 Jun 21 20:17 10 -> anon_inode:inotify\n> lr-x------ 1 matthias users 64 Jun 21 20:17 11 -> anon_inode:inotify\n> lr-x------ 1 matthias users 64 Jun 21 20:17 12 -> anon_inode:inotify\n> lr-x------ 1 matthias users 64 Jun 21 20:17 13 -> anon_inode:inotify\n> lr-x------ 1 matthias users 64 Jun 21 20:17 14 -> anon_inode:inotify\n> lr-x------ 1 matthias users 64 Jun 21 20:17 15 -> anon_inode:inotify\n> lr-x------ 1 matthias users 64 Jun 21 20:19 16 -> anon_inode:inotify\n> lr-x------ 1 matthias users 64 Jun 21 20:19 18 -> anon_inode:inotify\n> lrwx------ 1 matthias users 64 Jun 21 20:17 2 -> /dev/pts/40\n> lrwx------ 1 matthias users 64 Jun 21 20:17 3 -> socket:[289525025]\n> lrwx------ 1 matthias users 64 Jun 21 20:17 4 -> socket:[289525026]\n> lr-x------ 1 matthias users 64 Jun 21 20:17 5 -> pipe:[289525027]\n> l-wx------ 1 matthias users 64 Jun 21 20:17 6 -> pipe:[289525027]\n> lr-x------ 1 matthias users 64 Jun 21 20:17 7 -> anon_inode:inotify\n> lr-x------ 1 matthias users 64 Jun 21 20:17 8 -> anon_inode:inotify\n> lr-x------ 1 matthias users 64 Jun 21 20:17 9 -> anon_inode:inotify\n> ```\n. I don't know what I'm doing :-1: \n\n```\nstrace: Can't stat './fsnotify.test': No such file or directory\n\nGNU gdb (Ubuntu 7.7.1-0ubuntu5~14.04.2) 7.7.1\n./fsnotify.test: No such file or directory.\n```\n. I noticed that `inotify_init1()` has a `IN_NONBLOCK` option in Linux 2.6.27+ (Go 1.3 requires Linux 2.6.23)\n\nhttp://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/inotify_init1.2.html\n. Also related: https://github.com/howeyc/fsnotify/issues/7\n\n> Desire is to have the library send events/errors using select so that the receiving application can be monitoring the channels without the use of a separate goroutine.\n. #39 could solve this.\n. My current suggestion is to set the Op filter globally at the Watcher level instead of for each Watch added. Preferably in such a way that it cannot be changed later. Perhaps something like:\n\n``` go\nwatcher, err := fsnotify.NewWatcher(fsnotify.Create|fsnotify.Write)\n```\n- The filter can be passed to each adapter to have the OS filter out events the best it can.\n- A final user-space filter can catch any outliers without requiring the significant amount of bookkeeping of the previous implementation.\n- For the same reasons that directory watches are easier to manage, a user-space recursive watcher will be simpler to implement, whether included in fsnotify or externally.\n. @tsuna The problem with adding a new API like that is that the flags differ from platform to platform. That's partly why I'd like to split out inotify #173 so it can be used independently in special Linux-only cases.\n\nThis issue is tracking a more general solution, which may be a ways off yet.\n. Pull requests are welcome, and once we have more people reviewing and merging pull requests, things should start to move faster. \n\nI think breaking out the low-level platform specific libraries (such as #173) will also help there. It should allow experts in inotify to work on that without worrying about the cross-platform API, and others to tackle cross-platform consistency without dealing with all the low-level details.\n. leaking descriptors #59 didn't help any.\n. I've never even thought of extending it to webhook notifications like Dropbox and Google Drive provide. Interesting idea. Not sure if it belongs in this package, but having a common interface in top could be cool.\n\nThe sql driver model is one I've been thinking about, particularly if there are multiple options for a given OS.\n. Indeed. It also fits with another desire I have, which is to make it easier to contribute to without being knowledgable of every single platform. Separate drivers for inotify, kqueue, etc. would be one way to achieve that.\n. Yah, polling is the only option for NFS as far as I know. You can also check https://github.com/rjeczalik/notify but I don't think it has polling yet either.\n. Please do submit a pull request.\n. @omeid I don't have any plans for what a driver interface would look like yet (and to be honest, I haven't done much work on fsnotify lately).\n\nPersonally, I'd prefer to see the current code base cleaned up before doing a big API change. The Windows internals are particularity crufty. \nhttps://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/milestones/v2%20Internals\n\nMaybe we could start a new issue to figure out the details of transitioning to a driver model?\n. @cpuguy83 Do you think you would be able to add polling without changing the API? Maybe just for operating systems that fsnotify doesn't currently support?\n\nThere are other situations where polling would be desirable, but I'm not sure how to detect them, or if it should be done more manually (which is why a driver-style API is relevant to this discussion).\n. In terms of API, here are related issues #104 and #75. \n\nPolling should also help with #45 for Windows users.\n. @mdwhatcott @cpuguy83 Would you be willing to build a stand-alone `fsnotify/polling` package that could be incorporated into fsnotify as a secondary step?\n\nIf so, I'll create a repo called polling or poller or whatever you prefer.\n\nFor me the key considerations are:\n- providing a speedy implementation as outlined in the original post\n- a simple and idiomatic Go API specifically for polling\n- solid unit and/or integration tests (preferably without any external testing dependencies to keep it simple)\n- well documented both in the README, examples, and API docs\n. ok.\n\nHere is a polling watcher by @radovskyb https://github.com/radovskyb/watcher\n. @radovskyb Hey Benjamin, Would you be interested in transferring watcher into the fsnotify organization and working on it here? Still as a stand-alone repository for the time being.\n\nThe API already looks pretty close to fsnotify. \n\nOnce some of the low-level bits are extracted from fsnotify (e.g. #173) I'd like to incorporate polling into fsnotify as a fallback, while still allowing people to use the  poller directly if that's all they want.\n. Work has begun on this as an external project that can eventually be used from fsnotify.\nhttps://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsevents\n\nTODO:\n- [ ] Integration tests\n- [ ] Refine API\n- [ ] EventFlags.String()\n. Would it make sense to work in a monorepo for fsnotify? Bring the fsevents library into a subfolder and work on it here, even before it's integrated and used by fsnotify.\n. Some people are using fsnotify/fsevents so we'd probably leave it there and just move maintenance here. We could put a message up over there -- or not.\n\nI'm still undecided whether it should be `internal/` here initially.\n. I'm also not sure if we should try to move fsnotify towards this new driver system (#104), or build out something entirely new. Perhaps coming back later to retrofit fsnotify on top of an intermediary API.\n. For me personally, my first step would be to get Vagrant setup with a [Solaris box](https://vagrantcloud.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&sort=&provider=&q=solaris) with Go installed. Preferably via https://github.com/nathany/vagrant-gopher.\n. @4ad Amit (@amitkris) is currently working on FEN support. Would you be willing to review his pull request when it is ready?\n. This is likely the cause of _TestFsnotifySubdir fails intermittently on Mac OS X 10.9.2:_\n- https://github.com/howeyc/fsnotify/issues/67\n- https://code.google.com/p/go/issues/detail?id=8147\n. no updates yet. the plan to fix this is to use FSEvents (#11) which currently exists as a stand-alone project but isn't integrated into fsnotify:\r\nhttps://github.com/fsnotify/fsevents\r\n. @kevinburke sorry to hear that. \ud83d\ude22 \r\n\r\nIs there something that could be added to the Spotlight mention in the README to improve finding the issue?. Each OS is likely to be a little different. Here's a little research on kqueue: https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/issues/24#issuecomment-55539850\n\nEssentially: not watching the files in kqueue will result in **no event at all** when a file is touched/updated. (not even, hey, something changed in this directory)\n\nStill need to do research on inotify and Windows.\n. TextMate2 (OS X) use the exchangedata system call to perform the saves (not sure what that is). But Hugo users are having problems detecting saves: https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/1053#issuecomment-116778527\n. > Godoc is a relatively small program. It is built from 102 packages built from 582 source files. We certainly want to be able to build programs larger than godoc. It appears that Linux inotify will let you watch individual directories for changes within that directory, so for godoc you are looking at a little over 102 inotify watches. For OS X, fsevents will let you watch whole subtrees, so for godoc built from 1 GOROOT and 1 GOPATH entry you are looking at 2 fsevents watches.  For Microsoft Windows, FindFirstChangeNotification looks like it might be usable similar to fsevents. For Solaris, file event notifications (FEN) only apply to individual files or directories, and watching a directory inode does not appear to tell you about modifications made to files in that directory, so for godoc you are looking at almost 700 FEN watches. That might take a little while to set up, but assuming the kernel has no hard limits, it should be fine. Speaking of limits... For BSD (or OS X if you don't like fsevents), kqueue has the same \"enumerate every file or directory\" requirement as Solaris FEN, but you give them to the kernel not as file names but as file descriptors. It appears that the file descriptor must remain open while you are watching that file, so the per-process file descriptor limit imposes a limit on the number of things you can watch. Worse, the per-system file descriptor limit imposes a limit on the number of things anyone on the system can watch. The typical kernel limit on a BSD is only on the order of 10,000 file descriptors for the entire machine. - @rsc, https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-dev/bShm2sqbrTY/IR8eI20Su8EJ \n- The limits for FEN (Solaris) are high enough (#12) that a recursive watcher should be possible.\n- It's possible that kqueue (BSD, iOS) can't reasonably support a recursive watcher. For large trees, users may need to resort to Polling (#9) or another mechanism.\n. It should work. Most of the tricky issues are with too many resources being consumed. Also, we would ideally take advantage of native recursive watching on the operating systems that support it.\n. No update for fsnotify, but take a look at https://github.com/rjeczalik/notify as an alternative.\n. Rafal's notify library uses FSEvents on OS X instead of kqueue, so it doesn't have that problem on OS X. \n. As does fsnotify.\n. > Maybe the underlying file system event handling differs by platform.\n\nYes, it does.\n. Nothing yet.\n. This is closely related to #17 but specifically for Linux.\n. @rjeczalik Thanks for chiming in. I only heard of your notify project this past week. I'm really interested in taking a closer look at it.\n\n@edrex yah, there are too many little platform differences to trip up on. :dizzy_face: \n. I've written a rudimentary implementation of kqueue (on OS X):\nhttps://github.com/fsnotify/fslog\n. I tried a nil timeout but there is more work involved. Currently `syscall.Close(w.kq)` is in the same for loop that blocks. Instead it should be called directly by `watcher.Close()` which will cause the read to abort, after which it can clean up and return.\n. FreeBSD 10.0 behaves a bit differently:\n- Closing the kq descriptor doesn't abort the current read, in fact I still get the next event.\n- Then when setting up the next read, we of course get _Kevent: bad file descriptor_.\n\nIt's not a huge deal if we're calling Close() before shutting down the app, but if not, then the Read goroutine will sit there blocking until it gets another event to send over the channel. And if I do a proper cleanup to DELETE the events, that next event will never come.\n. When registering file descriptors to watch, this could be useful if registering multiple watches at once (such as all the files in a directory):\n\n> If an error occurs while processing an element of the changelist and there is enough room in the eventlist, then the event will be placed in the eventlist with EV_ERROR set in flags and the system error in data. Otherwise, -1 will be returned, and errno will be set to indicate the error condition. \n\nOtherwise I don't think I need to check for EV_ERROR. Fsnotify was doing this check, but eventlist was nil, so it should never be the case.\n. When watching a directory with kqueue it reports:\n- a Write when a file is created or deleted\n- a Write and Link when a subdirectory is created or deleted\n- nothing at all when a file is touched (updated)\n- but it does report a Write if modified by an editor that does an atomic save (create and rename)\n\nfsnotify currently adds to this:\n- watches all files in a directory to report updates to specific files. \n- watches for deletes on subdirectories to report the deleted subdirectory, not just a Write+Link\n- when a Write happens on a directory, it scans the directory for any new files/subdirectories and presents them as create events\n. In relation to #16, I was thinking of actually having an event of \"something happened in this directory, but we don't know what.\" Then the scanning and comparing of the files in a directory could be a separate utility function instead of built into `readEvents()`. It could be used for determining which directory was deleted as well.\n\nBut there is still the problem of touching files not reporting any event at all. As well as making the calling code different for kqueue.\n. Leaving this in for now as a debugging aid. it doesn't prevent anyone from writing a utility function to represent Event in another way. \n. @jaytaylor this is still something I need to research across platforms to see what can be done. Sorry for moving so slow,\n. @jmhodges Do you have any more details on \"Weird Things\" vim does? Is this when saving or is there a rename file function people are using in Vim?\n. ref: https://github.com/rjeczalik/notify/issues/78\n. not as of yet.\n. Thanks.\n\nHave you already signed the Go CLA? See the README. \n. Merged as fcd23cde655be3a4e721bd452abc33400136291c.\n\nThanks!\n. I suppose one disadvantage is that other (possibly temporary) repos such as go-fsnotify/fsevents couldn't make use of gopkg.in?\n. Good point. And I could create go-fsevents if that project took a life of its own.\n. A little maddening for autocomplete on the command line. `go-*` Oh well.\n. Whoops. Thanks @mewmew.\n. Thanks for the suggestion. The current API isn't final for sure, we definitely want to change how error handling works: #2.\n. There was an issue opened at https://github.com/howeyc/fsnotify/issues/7 regarding the requirement for a goroutine in the calling code.\n\n#5 is part of looking at that, specifically on Linux.\n\nfor BSD I've found that having kqueue block #24 results in less CPU utilization when idle, but doing so may make it harder to avoid having a goroutine in the calling code\n. @akavel Add() isn't recursive right now. See #18, #21 and #11.\n\nThe documentation certainly needs some work. I will leave this issue open until that happens. Thanks.\n. That may be a limit of kqueue when there is no watch on the file/directory where the file is being moved/renamed to. I need to take a closer look.\n\nI'm going to close this issue in favour of a #26.\n. FSEvents (OS X) and Windows have support for recursive watching. I'm not yet sure how they behave when doing `mkdir -p a/b/c`. Once that is determined, it may make sense to emulate that behaviour elsewhere.\n. Thanks @zhsso. I'll test it out shortly.\n\nDo you happen to know the difference between `filepath.Clean` and `path.Clean`?\n. Thanks for looking into it. Sounds like we're on the right path. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: \n\nI'm going to tackle #34 before I merge this in and do a new release later today.\n. @zhsso I forgot to mention\n\nContributors retain their copyright, so we need you to fill out a short form before we can accept your contribution: [Google Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual).\n\nHave you already signed the Go CLA?\n. Thanks very much @zhsso.\n. While [renaming the tags](http://stackoverflow.com/a/5719854/1684322) is easy enough, it also makes it look like I've been doing breaking changes in the v1 line. I'm inclined to just remove the tags for v0.10.0 through v0.14.3 entirely. \n\nDoing so accomplishes the same goal of getting v0 to match howeyc/fsnotify while v1 is the new API.\n.

Thanks for the submission.\n\nThis example doesn't actually send anything over the `done` channel, so I'm not 100% sure. \n\nI suppose having the example not exit immediately is good, even if Ctrl-C is required.\n. Alright. You win. :smile:\n. Just some C code that uses kqueue and inotify. Might be some useful tidbits, like their check_create for kqueue does a timestamp comparison before a (slower) hash lookup.\n. Thanks for working on this @chamaken. I left a few comments.\n. Feel free to add more commits here or open a new pull request.\n\nEpoll vs. select is up to you. Whichever works better.\n\nThanks @chamaken \n. @chamaken I'm not familiar with either, so I don't know. \n\nWe could try epoll and see how it goes. We could also request a code review from people on golang-nuts and see what we get back?\n. @chamaken Since I don't know when I'll read my Linux book and figure this stuff out, I put out a request for code review on [golang-nuts](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/PoJ1oYi1cXI).\n. Sorry for letting this sit for so long. \n\nEven though this isn't changing the API, I'm beginning to think that such big internal changes should also warrant a new major version and a release candidate, which is something gopkg.in is considering support for: https://github.com/niemeyer/gopkg/issues/25.\n\nI'm still figuring out exactly what this should look like.\n. Hi @chamaken,\n\nI think this is too big of a change for right now. Personally, I still haven't had a chance to learn the various Linux APIs nor have I been able to attract others to help code review and maintain the project.\n\nIf you're interested in helping make some smaller incremental improvements, I'd certainly be grateful. Right now I'm trying to focus on **cleaning up the code** (see 1f65e2ef12aa538ba66b432a0c60279f4406add1) so that lower-level concerns are more isolated.\n\nI'm also trying to get an [fslog project](https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/issues/23) going to help better understand the behaviour of each OS.\n\nThanks for all your work. Nathan.\n. Thanks for the report. I think #39 may address this for inotify. \n\nIn any case, #39 is a pretty big change, so let's get that in first. Feel free to give it a code review.\n. Right now I can only think of two possible ways to remove recursive watches for #18:\n1. keep track of all the folders we watch, this would be like asking it to remove a specific watch we added\n2. just walk the subfolders of a path and remove any watches that exist\n\nI'm in favour of 2, as additional watches could be created, and the API at present takes a path rather than a handle to a previous watch.\n\nHowever, I'd still like to see how Windows and FSEvents (OS X) handle recursive watches and removals before tackling this... which puts it a fair ways off.\n. Quite some time ago I attempted to track all the watched folders independently, but ran into an issue much like #40 in kqueue. I thought the watches were just magically removed when the folder was deleted, but I may have been wrong. (https://github.com/nathany/looper/commit/212051b2ac2b741ac055c68b4ff1434f870401e4)\n\nIt might be worth building a small test case to see if unwatching deleted folders is necessary. I started hacking on [fslog](https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fslog) as a place to do those sort of experiments (without all the other stuff fsnotify adds). But so far it only has kqueue.\n\nIt should be relatively easy to resolve #40, but I'd rather not expose w.watches as an API. It's supposed to be an internal detail.\n. So for 2, fsnotify should itself watch for remove event and do the internal cleanup of w.watches. That could be tricky later on if the user doesn't wish to subscribe to remove events (#7).\n\nBut for now, my focus is on [cleaning up](https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/milestones/v1%20Internal%20cleanup) the existing code, primarily separating the lower-level stuff out. Also doing more research as with 1. Fixing #40 and doing the internal cleanup could fit into that.\n. also see #51 \n. Thanks. Is this occurring specifically on Linux?\n. @ottob Thanks for trying this out.\n\nI presume you did a git bisect to identify that particular commit as the source of the issue?\n\nDo you have the code that's using fsnotify from this branch? Somewhere at https://github.com/ottob/revel?\n\nBasically, I need to get a test case to figure out what's going on and prevent this from breaking in the future.\n. Sounds like a difficult issue to track down. I did introduce a bug in 5997fa2 that was fixed in 8a7f75d. I may rebase pull request so that individual commits aren't introducing bugs (for the benefit of bisect).\n. @ottob I read through Revel's [watcher.go](https://github.com/revel/revel/blob/develop/watcher.go).\n\nI'm not sure if this will help with the problem you ran into, seems unrelated. https://github.com/revel/revel/pull/734\n\nWhich OS are you using? Mac or BSD?\n. @ottob Could you try to get a reproducible case with one of the [sample apps](https://github.com/revel/revel/tree/master/samples) and provide me the steps and OS you're using with a new issue?\n. Thanks @ottob. I haven't figured out Revel, so I'm pretty helpless trying to reproduce it.\n. @ottob Ugh. Thanks for digging into this more. Would you mind copy/pasting your last response into a new issue so it doesn't get missed? Thanks.\n. For sure. Thanks for the heads up Quinn.\n. @sqs Does the fancy linking stuff only work for code that compiles on Linux?\n\nI don't see any fancy stuff for this BSD file:\nhttps://sourcegraph.com/github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify@master/.tree/kqueue.go\n. Or maybe I just need to wait a bit... https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/.builds/515146\n. I'm not sure. It would certainly be nice to have a better error message. \n. I don't have SharePoint, so I'm not able to reproduce this issue.\n\nAccording to the [Windows documentation](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365465%28v=vs.85%29.aspx):\n\n> If the network redirector or the target file system does not support this operation, the function fails with ERROR_INVALID_FUNCTION.\n\nSo I guess that explains it. \n\nMaybe I should add that to the FAQ, or we could change how this error is reported at https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/blob/master/windows.go#L353.\n. strace and gdb with go test -c from #3.\n. Hm. Interesting. Which operating system?\n. Hi Otto. Sorry for not digging into this sooner. I've never used Revel before, but I got the booking sample running with some additional logging (on the develop branch).\n\nYour previous bisect had pointed to 4a0d1ae9df8c61fb8912829fc714f189358a3dc7 being the culprit. Most of those changes are to addWatch, so I added some logging there and compared against ca50e738d35a862c379baf8fffbc3bfd080b3cff. With the result you're seeing, it seems plausible that it was watching more than it was previously. \n\nSo far I haven't figured it out. Still digging. It might be worth confirming that bisect, since you said it wasn't 100% reproducible. If it was a commit before, that could change things quite a lot.\n\nIf there was a medium sized open source Revel app that we could reproduce this on, that would make it much easier. It might even be reproducible with a similar file structure to your app, even if those files don't contain the same code. /cc @robfig \n. @ottob I hope you have Spotlight disabled for your folder, which can randomly decide to create events. https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/wiki/FAQ. \n\nThough if not disabled, I'd expect you'd see the same problems on v1.0.4 as well.\n. ![cannot-reproduce](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4566/5326360/28586750-7cd3-11e4-90f8-3bcb6f21b026.gif)\n. I've ran into a very similar issue here. https://github.com/nathany/looper/issues/18 It is reliably reproducible. Looking into a fix now.\n. @ottob I believe this to be fixed on master. Stupid mistake on my part. Sorry for all the trouble.\n. Feel free to reopen this issue if you still see the issue.\n. It depends a lot on which OS you're using, but you probably want to watch the directory that you will be creating a file in.\n. `syscall.ERROR_MORE_DATA` was added in Go 1.3.\n\nAre you willing to upgrade? http://golang.org/dl/\n. Thanks. I put a mention of Go 1.3 in the README for next time.\n. Thanks for the detailed report. I haven't had a chance to play with the example yet.\n\nOS X is using kqueue, but this may be similar to #40 on Linux (inotify) where fsnotify isn't cleaning up it's internal data for watches.\n. Thanks to your example, I did manage to reproduce the issue on both v1.0.4 (before a bunch of my refactoring) and on the current master. I added some logging into addWatch in kqueue.go.\n\nkqueue.go is maintaining some internal state to map back and forth between filenames and descriptors. If it's a file descriptor that is already being watched, it can modifies what flags are being watched. This is something used internally.\n\nWhen a rename or remove event is fired, it calls the exported `Remove()` method to do some cleanup. For whatever reason it's sending the event on the channel and then doing the cleanup.\n\nThat's been this way since I adopted the code. Flipping those around makes sense to me.\n. The fix is on master. Doing a release soon.\n\nIf you have a chance to test it out, please let me know how it goes.\n. Thanks Matt!\n\nLooking forward to your next contribution. :grinning: \n. Until now I hadn't heard of USN Journals. It sounds worth looking into.\n\nIs this the state-of-the-art not in just Windows 2000, but also Windows 7, 8, 10?\n\nWe do have working code for Windows based on ReadDirectoryChangesW. It is based on [winfsnotify](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/exp/winfsnotify) and everyone who's contributed to it has agreed to the [CLA](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual).  \n\nBut it does need a lot of love (see #6 and #21), and I'm certainly not opposed to doing a fresh implementation if there are APIs that can provide better reliability and closer feature parity to other operating systems.\n. FYI, Go [currently requires](http://golang.org/doc/install#requirements) Windows XP or later, so there is no need to support anything older than that.\n. Is it possible to use USN Journals without Administrator privileges?\n. That's a bit unfortunate.\n\nDo you want me to create a Windows USN repo under go-fsnotify?\n\nWe could bring the code over and make sure everything still works in Go 1.3 & 1.4.\n. Nope. Nobody ever was.\n. Hi. So far this issue has just been a place to collect information about USN. Nobody has begun implementing support for it is fsnotify.\n\nTo support USN directly in fsnotify, I think we'll need a driver system where people can choose between ReadDirectoryChangesW or USN much like choosing a MySQL or Postgres driver. To start, my suggestion would be to build up a stand-alone USN package and then we'll figure out how to integrate it.\n\nThat could be as a subfolder of this repository or a separate repository (I'm happy to create a repo under the go-fsnotify organization if desired).\n\nThere's also plenty of clean up work to do on the current Windows support.\nhttps://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/labels/Windows%20%28ReadDirectoryChangesW%29\n\nThanks\n. If someone is interested in implementing USN, we would probably start by getting it working outside of fsnotify (much like the fsevents package), and then look at bringing it in afterwards.\n\nLet me know if you're interested.\n. Hi @jimzhan. Thanks for the report. I need a little more info.\n\nHow are you writing to the file? Are you using a text editor #17 or touch?\nAre you watching an individual file or he directory containing the file?\nThanks.\n. @jimzhan It's likely to do with \"atomic saves\" in VIM. See #17.\n. I'm not sure what the simple delay trick is? When I use fsnotify, I just treat Create and Write as the same.\n. Thanks for following up. \n. Yah, it would be nice. But unfortunately that's more to do with how the underlying event monitoring systems work and how editors save files than with fsnotify.\n. Hi Matt. Right now it's necessary to launch in a separate Go routine, see https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/blob/master/example_test.go\n\nThis is something that we should address though.\n\nref also in howeyc/fsnotify https://github.com/howeyc/fsnotify/issues/7\n\nI'm not sure if a buffered channel will solve it, but I could give it a try.\n. I tried running this second example and it didn't deadlock here (OS X 10.10 here too).\n\ntouching a file in the same directory `touch fsnotify_issue55.go` resulted in an event at which point it breaks to Loop and sends a message over the done channel and exits.\n\nselect will wait for an event from one of these channels. if you don't want to wait, you could add a `default:` case. I don't think buffered channels would help, that's just the behaviour of select.\n. No problem. More on select:\n\nhttps://gobyexample.com/select\n\nhttp://golang.org/ref/spec#Select_statements\n(In particular bullet point 2)\n. Ops are a bit mask so it is a combination of events (4 as well as 2)\n\nSee the example_test.go to check for individual flags.\n. Thanks for reporting this.\n. @PieterD I'm looking this on OS X and BSD, but it also fails on Linux:\n\nusing `import \"github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify\"`\n\n```\npanic: inotify_init: too many open files\n```\n. Excellent.\n\n**kqueue**:\nThis is interesting, as Close just calls Remove for all watches. Another race condition? \nClose is ignoring the errors that Remove sends back, in this case: \"bad file descriptor\"\n. Thanks @PieterD. I've already merged a fix for OS X, but I have yet to tag a new release. Tomorrow once the epoll stuff is in.\n. @meatballhat Looks like everything is working. Thanks!\n. If you run into the same issue with this repo, please let me know what OS you are using and some example code if possible.\n\nI should really send a CL to remove x/exp/fsnotify.\n. Thanks Pieter.\n\nx/exp is quite a ways behind this repo, but very little has changed on Linux.\n. Thanks for the example. I'll try to take a look on the weekend.\n\nIf you want to try adding some logging into inotify.go and poke around, any help would be appreciated.\n. Thanks very much!\n\nI'll take care of exp/fsnotify.\n. merged.\n. I sent in a CL to remove exp/fsnotify. https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/3990/1\n. merged.\n. Thanks.\n. Have you confirmed that #3 is fixed by this change?\n\nI'll take a closer look and do some QA tomorrow before I merge it in. Thanks again for the help.\n. @PieterD Have you already signed Google's CLA for contributing to Go? (This code base originates from Go exp packages and may one day land in Go).\n\nhttps://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual\n. Thanks. I'm on my way to a hack day, fsnotify will be my project for today.\n. And then it gets interesting. :-)\n. Does IN_NONBLOCK help at all? See #5.\n. I admit I don't understand this stuff. I'm yet to become a Linux guru. :-)\n. A separate PR would be appreciated. Let me get this tested and merged in.\n. \u00fcbermess!\n. Hah. \"awesome\" race conditions. So awesome that `-race` didn't catch it.\n. For the changelog, #5 isn't actually solved yet, correct? (coming next)\n. Squashed and merged. \n\n#5. Doesn't readEvent still block though? That little hack to wake it up on Close might work, but maybe not? \n. kqueue has a timeout right now so that it doesn't block indefinitely, but it does use a little bit of CPU to go around the loop every 100ms.\n. I'm wrong about this. It's fine.\n\nWe want to run `filepath.Clean(name)` on user-input.\n. I'm not sure how I should test this. Based on #59, the second Add should reuse the same file descriptor because Close cleaned up. But I don't want to expose file descriptors to the API.\n. guess i can add a kqueue_test.go for that. ok\n. I like how you separated the poller out into a separate file. But man, this makes it so much more complex.\n. Should there be inotify_poller_test.go?\n. Interesting. \n\nAnother proposal is to have something like `Sys() interface{}` in [FileInfo](http://golang.org/pkg/os/#FileInfo) to retrieve the underlying event data (OS specific bitmask). \n\nThat doesn't address filtering though.\n. Wow, that is odd. Your code looks good to me, so I'm going to have to do some digging.\n\nWhat is your import path and is fsnotify the very latest version?\n. @pbdeuchler It's this line right here:\n\n```\ndefer watcher.Close()\n```\n\nNothing in `Run()` is blocking. When it returns we close down the channels, and closed channels always receive the zero value (which is nil for interfaces like error).\n\nYou probably want to define a separate `func (dr *DiskRecieve) Stop() error` function to call Close later on in your program execution.\n. `event.Op&fsnotify.Write == fsnotify.Write` will never succeed when Events is returning a zero-value Event struct.\n. @PieterD I like how we both saw the issue at the exact same time. :smile: \n. A failing test on a new branch would be a good way to start. :-)\n. The FAQ should be clarified. \n\nIt means that the main goroutine can't be used because it will block.\n. Not `Add` specifically, but the run loop that NewWatcher kicks off. I think it depends on the OS, whether or not the Kernel is blocking. It would be nice to handle all this better internally, but I haven't looked into it that deeply yet. :disappointed: \n. That error would be coming from here: https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/blob/master/windows.go#L448\n\nUnfortunately I don't know the Windows code very well yet. It was inherited from Chris Howey's version of fsnotify, which was inherited from [winfsnotify](https://github.com/golang/exp/tree/master/winfsnotify).\n\nIf you manage to add enough to a code example to reproduce the issue, that would really help.\n. Sorry, I'm still not really sure. :disappointed: \n\nAre you using just an ordinary local directory? And you say it's when there are a lot of files? With a few files it works? Maybe I can reproduce the issue. That would be a good first step.\n. Thanks for the info. I'm not sure when I (or someone else) will have a chance to dig into the Windows code for fsnotify to figure out what's going on. But any details to help reproduce it are helpful.\n. Thanks @chamaken. I can take a look sometime over the next few days.\n. Sorry, I still haven't checked this. :-(\n. Merged. Thanks.\n. Thanks for investigating this @tsuna. Would you mind opening a new issue so this doesn't get lost?\n. Yes. I think we should take another look at this code change. Adding and removing watches from the same goroutine should not cause deadlocks.\n. @metakeule You're right. It does depend on the OS.\n\n#23 is a little project I'd like to do to get a better sense of what each OS is doing. Importantly, that would be done at a lower-level than fsnotify, since fsnotify adds some things on top.\n\nThen I'd like to take that research and write about on the website: https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify.org So far I've dived into kqueue (BSD, OS X), but have yet to write anything up (other than some notes in #24). There are a few more things I need to look into as well, such as renaming #26.\n. What I like most is that fsnotify and other libraries are free to experiment with different APIs and ways of using the underlying bindings. The lowest common denominator interface vs. emulating features in user-land vs. driver-like systems. Meanwhile the bindings themselves can be really solid and reused.\n. #173 seems like a good place to start\n. Thanks for taking the time to contribute.\n\nBut I don't really want to add methods to the Event struct. My preference is to keep a minimal API surface with the bitfields exposed for checking, coalescing, etc. This is based on the design document mentioned in the README.\n\nIf you wants additional methods like this, it's easy enough to convert to a new type and provide them there.\n\nAn article on how to do this (and how bitfields work) would be a better approach IMO. Happy to take contributions to the fsnotify.org blog:\nhttps://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify.org\n. The use of bitmasks and creation of a wrapper could be documented on the blog. Would anyone like to write it up? https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify.org\n. I'm closing this in favour of documentation or a blog post. See #107. Pull requests to the website repo are welcome.\n. Strange. I was pretty sure the the go routine would make a difference (https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsevents/issues/11).\n\nl need to find some time to try out your example.\n. Apparently not. fsnotify uses inotify under the hood when running on Linux:\n\n> /proc is a kernel interface. There are no real files there, hence they can't change. Reading from the handles is a request and the data in the file when you read it is a reply to that. - [StackExchange](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/90627/notify-of-changes-on-a-file-under-proc)\n> \n> The data that you see when you read from the proc filesystem is generated on-the-fly when you do a read from the begining of a file. That is, doing the read causes the data to be generated by a kernel callback function that is specific to the file you are reading. \n. Hi Wang Jing,\nThis looks unusual. Was there a test.yml file there before? When a REMOVE event happens, it stops watching that file, but I haven't yet looked into this scenario where the file is overwritten.\n. The events from the underlying system are largely unmodified, resulting in differences from one platform to the next.\n\nI'm not sure what the best solution is right now. I don't know if it will always be possible to present the same result across 4-5 platforms.\n. One solution would be not support watching individual files at all. I think that might be the approach that https://godoc.org/github.com/rjeczalik/notify takes. FSEvents on OS X also seems geared towards watching directories instead of files. \n\nOf course, if a directory is (re)moved, you may still have to watch one level up to see what happened.\n. Maybe there should be a flag indicating if the event is a dir or file event?\n. That would be nice. The question is whether we can add that across each platform without introducing additional overhead (Lstat when not needed).\n. ref #83 \n. Merged. Thanks\n. Moving the String() method does sound like a good idea.Thanks\n. Windows is already supported. See the README.\n. There can be (and sometimes are) multiple Ops in an event. That's why it is a bitmask.\n. @techjanitor for your info, #165 has been merged, resolving the issue you set out to with this pull request.\n. If you can share some sample code to reproduce the issue, that would be helpful..\n. Revert to polling #9 or report an error like #45.\n. @omeid Not as of yet. See https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/milestones\n. Hi David,\nThanks for the pull request. Is this meant to address #22?\n\nThe thing that I'm not sure about is operating systems other than Linux. With this change, there is a Closed event that doesn't mean anything outside of Linux. Hm.\n. I hope you don't mind working off a fork until we come up with a better solution.\n. Quite odd having different behaviour between different Linux versions. Different versions of the kernel, perhaps? Or maybe different versions of vim?\n\nCan you reproduce the issue using`touch` from the command line instead of an editor? See #17.\n. If you are watching an individual file and it moves, it may no longer be being watched. Better to watch the directory the file is in.\n\nIf you believe there is a bug, can you please provide more details, such as operating system you are using and a code snippet to reproduce the issue? Thanks.\n\n(sorry for the late reply)\n. @kkirsche sorry, I'm not sure I follow what's happening in your example.\n\nmoving/renaming doesn't work so well with the underlying OS notification systems #26\n\nbtw, which operating system are you testing on?\n. @kkirsche Glad you got it working. Do you have any suggestions for improving the example code or documentation?\n. This is on Linux? Do you think you could provide a code snippet that reproduces the issue? Thanks.\n. I'm not sure if I understand. Op is a bit field with only 5 bits. It should not overflow even an 8-bit int, and it is a 32-bit int.\n. Oh. I've never heard of it.\n. I'm not entirely sure. A git blame points back to this issue in howeyc/fsnotify https://github.com/howeyc/fsnotify/issues/36.\n\nI don't like the idea of ignoring events either.\n. Thanks Evan. \n\nIt looks like there is an unrelated problem in CircleCI and Travis. I'll look into it.\n. Merged to master. Thanks.\n. Yup. v1.2.1 released with this change.\n\nhttps://gopkg.in/fsnotify.v1\n. yikes. What OS did you encounter this on?\n\nIf possible, can you provide a small code sample that reproduces the issue?\n. If it occurs consistently, you could try changing that lock in your local copy of fsnotify to see if it solves the issue.\n. Hi Uwe. Any updates on this? I haven't ran into the issue yet myself.\n. That might do the trick, but without being able to reproduce the issue, I don't want to just change code and hope it works. Much better if @djui tries it and proves that it fixes his issue.\n. @ppknap I like your plan of using a temporary map. Would you be willing to write up a pull request along with a test case?\n\nUPDATE: oh, you did add a test case #102. Thanks! For some reason it's not failing on travis-ci running on OS X which does use kqueue.\n. Good idea. Thanks.\n. @djui The race detector isn't finding any races for me on OS X 10.11.2 with Go 1.5.2 or tip, but I've added `--race` to Travis CI (which includes OS X).\n\nOn the other hand, there are two races happening on Linux. Looking into those in #105. \n. Oh. It showed up now, thanks to @ppknap's TestRemoveWithClose. Not sure why it didn't show up immediately after I merged that in, but oh well. Looking into it.\n. Please review #105 and when all is good I'll do a new release.\n. Thanks.\n\nGo itself only [requires Linux 2.6.23 or later with glib](https://golang.org/doc/install), so I should add a note to the README about 2.6.27.\n. I'm not sure what the stats are. That's a good idea to look into it. Preferably we won't need a kludge to support the older kernels, but mentioning it in the README and release notes is important.\n. No, sorry for the delay. \n\nI'll merge some things and do a release later today.\n. Merged. Thanks Riku.\n\nI'l do a new point release after looking at a few other pull requests.\n. Thanks for the PR. \n\nRegarding the Linux test failure, I've triggered a rebuild, so we'll see if Travis is just being flaky.\n. Merged as https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/commit/2cdd39bd6129c6a49c74fb07fb9d77ba1271c572 and released as 1.2.5. Thanks!\n. I  should add `script: go test -v --race ./...` to use the race detector on Travis.\n. I'm closing this as it's included in #105, which is on the race branch. Thanks.\n. The current solution is to filter out the events you get back. Indicating which events to watch is an optimization, though not all platforms will be able to filter the same way. Please take a look at #7.\n\nI'm closing this is a duplicate. If you want to take a stab at it, I'd be happy to review a pull request. Feel free to discuss further at #7.\n. API changes are using Events() and Errors() instead of fields in the platform-dependent struct and returning a FileWatcher interface instead of a *Watcher struct.\n\nMaybe there is another way to do this that makes the drivers/bindings satisfy an interface, but keeps the existing API as is.\n. I'm not sure if I want to see this much API churn in fsnotify itself. At least in the near-term.\n\nRather, I'd just like to see the fsnotify split into some independent packages (#75) for each OS while keeping the current API more or less the same. Having those low-level packages in place should enable more experimentation at the higher levels in alternatives to fsnotify.\n. Personally, I'd like to keep the fsnotify API as simple as possible, without requiring the user to know which driver to use. This could be an internal implementation detail at all.\r\n\r\nFor those that need more control, the individual OS-specific packages could be used directly.. I've rebased in squashed commits to (somewhat) avoid test failures in the history.\n. Thanks for your review.\n. Hi @tiwaana. Just prepare a Dockerfile in a pull request that can be used to locally test Linux, with some instructions to do so. The tests (`go test`) should pass in the container.\n. Part of this move would be to adopt @rjeczalik's notify library as an alternative available from the same organization. Any low-level \"drivers\" for specific platforms would also exist under the new organization.\n. I'm planning to rename the organization as well, since the \"go-\" prefix is a gopkg.in thing.\n. I'm preparing to rename the organization now.\n. The move to https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify is done, though I have to ensure CI is still working and update the website.\n\nGitHub automatically redirects https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify to https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify.\n\nI tested `go get gopkg.in/fsnotify.v1` and it still works, which I did not expect. If we run into any problems, or if we ever need to include github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify in an internal import path, I can put a repository up at github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify with a \"maintenance has moved\" message in the README.\n. All done.\n. It could be useful. Though for any API addition or change, I'd like to hear from multiple people, so I'm going to let this sit for awhile.\n\nOne consideration is that sometimes the underlying OS does buffering of it's own. FSEvents on Mac in particular can even persist events to disk across reboots. I'm not sure how accurate the length returned would be in such situations, but it's worth investigating.\n. Thanks for the report. That is odd. It would probably be worth digging deeper to see if inotify is the cause or if fsnotify is mangling the event somehow.\n\nAdding some logging in readEvents could help. https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/blob/master/inotify.go#L171\n. Thanks @bep\n. Thanks for researching all this Anthony. So in summary:\n- EpollPwait needs to be added to x/sys by us or someone. https://github.com/golang/go/issues/10235\n- We need to switch to x/sys for fsnotify (on Linux at least) and mention it in the README and release notes.\n- We should look into ARM based continuous integration (the Go team is using some custom stuff running on https://www.scaleway.com/)\n\nWe can switch to InotifyInit1 at anytime, which I believe is available in the standard library sys package. It may require a slightly newer Linux kernel, but that's fine so long as the README indicates the requirements. Feel free to prepare a pull request for that if you like.\n. Ok.\n. Thanks Anthony. If you could do some testing with #135, it would be much appreciated.\n. Thanks @purpleidea. I left some comments.\n. Thanks James. As to your question, if someone does a `go get github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify` the code should compile and build without needing to go generate anything. \n\nThis applies even more so to a library. For example, if you `go get github.com/spf13/hugo` which depends on fsnotify, it would fail to build until you run go generate on the fsnotify dependency. If multiple libraries did that it would be a total nightmare for users.\n\nIt's also what the Go team recommends, and I trust their recommendations, because they have a lot more experience than me. https://blog.golang.org/generate\n. Is that test failure on Windows?\n\nfsnotify is a bit unusual in that it has a lot of platform-specific code. hopefully we can get this to work without multiple op_stringers for different platforms.\n\nThe Windows code is a real mess IMO #6. Sorry.\n. I'm too sleepy to be coding on this right now (bugs are inevitable), but I'll try to take a look in the next few days. Thanks for the contrib.\n. pong :)\n\nsorry.\n. This PR still needs a little more work before it's merged. I can do the work, but I haven't had a chance to yet.\n. see the comments i made during code review.\n. ok.\n. That would be great.\n\nThe only thing is, how does someone using Linux choose between them? We may need something along the lines of #104 first.\n. @purpleidea I think it would be best to build fanotify Go wrapper out as a separate repo and then look at integrating after that.. @amir73il is working on a \"super block watch\" for Linux, providing \"the ability to set a single (fanotify) watch on a root directory and get notified on all the legacy inotify events without the need to recursively add watches on all directories.\" https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/12/20/312\r\n\r\nThis could avoid the need for a user-space recursive watcher (#16) on modern Linux kernels.\r\n. Thanks Amir. \r\n\r\nPerhaps another option to make the patched kernel available would be to maintain a [Vagrant box](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/boxes/search) built with [Packer](https://www.packer.io/). That way we could test fanotify super block using a VirtualBox VM from any operating system.. I wonder if this is similar to the issues and fixes for kqueue on BSD (#105), except for inotify.\n. Which platform are you running into this issue on?\n. Thanks. \n\nWere the events happening previously? Do you have any idea of what may have changed in wellington, or if it was an update to fsnotify? \n. Thanks for reporting this. I haven't noticed gopkg.in being unreliable, but it's another reason to move away from it. See #108.\n. https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify is the new home for fsnotify.\n. CLA hub has new maintainers if we want a CLA.\n. maybe keep the 3 clause BSD license but change the wording? e.g. https://github.com/gocql/gocql/commit/bfab7467126ac5a9e7360141737da30214f026c7\n. The CLA and license are needed if Google is to ever use this code in core or x/tools. \n\nWe need a better solution for enforcing the Google CLA.\n\nIt would make me feel less awkward if there was an active co-maintainer on the project who is employed by Google.\n. Regarding the CLA, perhaps Google has some code to integrate with GitHub Status in a similar fashion to GitHub themselves.\n\n![b53610ca-946c-11e6-8488-ff95f51aba59](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4566/19661443/fbc5da3c-99f0-11e6-9671-77ec70217ee4.png)\n. closing in favour of #193. Thanks!\n. Finally got my Windows VM working again. Merged. Thanks.\n. This may be related to the way editors save files. See #17 \n\nCan you try modifying the file at the command line? \nhttp://superuser.com/questions/10426/windows-equivalent-of-the-linux-command-touch/764716\n. Thanks for checking. \n\nSome people batch up or throttle events if they occur multiple times. Eg. here is the code for Hugo:\nhttps://github.com/spf13/hugo/blob/master/watcher/batcher.go\n\nThere was a fix for similar issues in OS X with #111, but I'm not sure if the same solution would work on Windows. \n. Thanks for investigating this @tsuna. \n\nHave you looked at related open issues already? Possibly #115.\n. What do you think of splitting out inotify as a dependency and adding some inotify-specific stress tests there? #173.\n\nAlso, there are some open pull requests in need of review/testing that may help, such as #149.\n. I'll re-run Travis to see if it's being flaky.\n. Sorry, still haven't reviewed and tested it yet.\n. I'm not that familiar with `syscall.Pipe`. Hoping someone will review this.\n. Thanks for your patience @fjl.\n\nThere is currently a data race issue with kqueue on master, which should be remedied first.\nhttps://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify/pull/162#issuecomment-251575890\n\nAs to this PR, we need some familiar with epoll to do the code review.\n. sounds good. feel free to merge this.\n. @omeid I agree. We should make that clear in the CONTRIBUTING document and also look into GitHub's branch protection for master.\n. I enabled a few things:\n- The master branch is protected from force pushes. \n- Tests must pass before a branch can be merged to master.\n- Branches must be up-to-date with master before merging.\n\nIf the tests past on a branch and it is up-to-date with master, it should still be possible to push its contents to master directly. It may or may not work with the \"hub apply mail\" workflow I've been using.\n\nThough I'd prefer squash merging, merge commits are also enabled for now.\n. This whole idea could be impacted by what we end up doing for #136.\n. Thanks.\n. merged. thanks\n. Yes, this hasn't changed. kqueue does need to keep a file open for every file it watches, plus the directories themselves. On BSD the limits are higher so it's less of an issue than on OS X.\n\nThere is a way to increase the limit. The FAQ should probably be updated with the commands to do it. https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify/wiki/FAQ\n\nYou can also ensure that you're not watching files that don't need to be watched, such as hidden .git folders.\n. NOTE: The FAQ is now part of the README to increase visibility (#186): https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify#faq. Hi Mart\u00edn. Thanks for reporting the issues. Unfortunately I don't have access to Linux on these architectures to test with nor do we have CI/builders on those architectures to catch the issues. \n\nThe poller code that is failing was submitted by @PieterD in #66 and switched to `epoll_create1` by @suihkulokki in #100 in an effort to make it work on arm64. Maybe they will have some insight into why it's failing.\n. thanks Riku\n\nas to the errors on PowerPC, I really have no idea :cry:\n. Thanks @laboger. Are you planning to do a CL for syscall?\n\nShould fsnotify switch from using standard libraries syscall to https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/sys?\n. Fixing the standard libraries syscall would be preferable. I just thought it was frozen since Go 1.3, but maybe bugfixes are still okay. Thanks.\n. Is it timing out? Many of the tests only wait so long for the notifications to occur.\n. @TheTincho Can you test arm64 with v1.3.0. It should be working now that @suihkulokki's patch is in: https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/21971/\n. I should've looked more closely at @laboger's work before. Apologies.\n\nLooking through https://github.com/golang/go/issues/15135, Lynn updated the `syscall` package in the standard library. That fix was made to Go 1.7.\n\nhttps://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/22207/\n\nBut the Go team allowed the patch to be rolled back to Go 1.6.2 which is due out today: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/15288\n\nRiku took a different approach, revising [golang.org/x/sys/unix](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/sys/unix) and switching fsnotify to use it.\n\nAt this point it probably makes the most sense to apply @laboger's change to x/sys/unix as well. That way fsnotify won't require Go 1.6.2 for ppc.\n\nI don't know if @suihkulokki's change could have been made to syscall instead, but at this point it's probably too late to make the change there, and still get it in to Go 1.6.2.\n. We really need to get builders #136 setup for these environments. That way we can ensure they are continuing to work with other changes, and we could also see any test failures that occur.\n. @laboger Are you still seeing test failures sometimes? If you are running with the verbose (`-v`) option it can be difficult to see the failure amidst all the other logs.\n. @laboger Apologies. I merged that change before looking at the work you had done on the syscall library. Would you be willing to submit your syscall changes and any other necessary changes as a CL on golang.org/x/sys/unix? That will enable powerpc to work even on Go 1.5 rather than requiring 1.6.2.\n\nI'm looking into getting Go's builder machines in place for fsnotify. That way we can ensure it is tested across linux/arm64 and ppc to avoid such issues in the future.\n. Thanks Lynn.\n. @laboger syscall was supposedly frozen when x/sys was extracted. \n. @laboger Here is the relevant proposal and mailing list thread\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1QXzI9I1pOfZPujQzxhyRy6EeHYTQitKKjHfpq0zpxZs/edit\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-dev/gyOoSwxBkCA\n\n> We therefore propose to freeze the package as of Go 1.3\n. This whole thing has brought to light something I didn't realize. There are quite a lot of changes to the \"frozen\" `syscall` package since September 2014 (when Go 1.4 was released and syscall was \"frozen\"). Perhaps it just was the pragmatic thing to do to keep things working, but it certainly isn't frozen.\n\nThe copy to `x/sys` happened in August 2014 and `x/sys` has seen a lot of changes too. But it does make me wonder if there aren't fixes and improvements in `syscall` that haven't made it so `x/sys`.\n\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/commits/master/src/syscall\n. So I've posted a message to golang-dev regarding this whole confusing situation with syscall vs. x/sys: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-dev/cEASnHIXmLI\n\nI still think the switch to `x/sys` is a good move simply to support previous versions of Go, but I'm somewhat inclined to do a diff of the two libraries to see if we're missing any syscall patches.\n. There is an open CL for ppc from @clnperez.\n\nhttps://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/22605/\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/15393\n\nI'm not sure about s390x.\n. The change list (CL) has been submitted. Thanks Christy.\n\n```\ngo get -u golang.org/x/sys/unix\n```\n\nI don't think any changes are need to fsnotify itself for this update.\n\n@TheTincho Can you please test it out.\n. see #22. Thanks. It would've been a bit easier to use an alias for the import `import syscall \"golang.org/x/sys/unix\"` but this is fine.\n\nIt looks like the CI failure on darwin as something flaky.\n\nAdding a dependency could break people's builds, so we'll need to release this carefully.\n. @anthonyfok offered to do some additional testing in #112.\n\nI think we should release this as v1.3.0 by the end of April. I'm thinking of pre-announcing the release to golang-nuts, since it does require a new dependency.\n. Announced: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-nuts/3JLKL785bTY/EacbfZVeAAAJ\n\nI also left a note in the #fsnotify channel on Slack.\n. merged. thanks\n. As far as local testing, I currently use https://github.com/nathany/vagrant-gopher for BSD and Linux, which I run on a Mac along with a Windows 10 VM in VMware Fusion. Solaris could probably be added, but that still only covers x86.\n\nI recall some plans to make it possible to utilize the builders from a local computer while debugging issues, but I don't know where that is currently at.\n. From @bradfitz:\n\n> Currently our builders can only run stuff in golang.org/x\\* and hosted on Gerrit.\n> That's not fundamental, but it's just how things are currently implemented.\n\nI will compose a message to golang-dev tonight after work to see where the community wants to take this.\n. There is also a matter of where the issue tracking is done in the future. In a subrepo or the Go language repo. The change from pull requests to CLs.\n\nI'm fairly happy with GitHub's recent improvements to pull requests and my own workflows using hub, so it's really just the builders that we need to get going on.\n. Posted to golang-dev to include other Go contributors in the discussion. https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-dev/SVrNHQU1oEM\n. Opened an issue over in the Go repository. https://github.com/golang/go/issues/17312\n. Thanks for the report. ppc wasn't resolved in v1.3.0, see issue #130 for more.\n. Please try updating x/sys/unix.\n. From Slack, @flexd reports the same issue with v1.2.11, so this isn't a regression with the new syscall dependency in 1.3.\n. @ppknap Good call.\n\n@Depado does your code do a similar thing or do you have a different cause?\n\nMaybe we can improve the documentation or FAQ to indicate that watcher.Close() should only be called when you're done watching, not in a defer in a function call.\n. Closing this. If you have any suggestions for making this more clear in the examples or documentation, feel free to reopen it or open a new issue.\n. closed in favour of #173\n. @pattyshack provided a patch which has been merged to master. \n\nplease (re)open the issue if you see any further flakiness.\n. Thanks for the report. Which operating system is this on?\n. Thanks @suihkulokki. So `sed` exhibits the same issues as text editors #17.\n. Thanks for providing a failing test. I won't be merging it until we have a fix, nor will I be merging in with an additional testing dependency (as good as testify may be).\n. Thanks. Would you mind also taking a peek at #124?\n. @jeffwilliams You could checkout an older version of fsnotify and vendor that code. The change to EpollCreate1 was made in v1.2.5. See [releases](https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify/releases).\n\nI'm not sure if there is a good way to fallback to the old EpollCreate, so I'm going to go ahead and close this. \n. I've personally not test with 10k+ files. We should try to establish if the underlying inotify code handles that many files properly (for a given kernel). Assuming it does, then we will at least know it's an issue in fsnotify.\n. > \"IN_Q_OVERFLOW is emitted when the appropriate queue is full and can't take more events. If this event occurs frequently you should read events faster and eventually increase the limit for queues. This limit can be read and changed by reading/changing the appropriate procfs file (/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_queued_events).\" - http://inotify.aiken.cz/?section=inotify&page=faq\n\nWould it be possible to test this by temporarily modifying `/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_queued_events` to a small value? (An inotify-specific tast with the linux build tag)\n\nIf an integration test isn't possible (or reliable), then **how should this be manually tested?**\n. Ok.\n\nWe have a new pull request template: https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md\n\nI'd like to ensure all these questions are answered for any pull request.\n\nWhat does this pull request do?\n\n> Upon receiving an event with IN_Q_OVERFLOW set in the mask, generate an\n> error on the Errors chan, so that the application can take appropriate\n> action.\n\nWhere should the reviewer start?\n\nHow should this be manually tested?\n. @zeldovich Have you signed the Google CLA? We need contributors to sign the CLA so that fsnotify can be used in Go tools in the future.\n\nhttps://cla.developers.google.com/about\n. Thanks @bep. It seems all the current pull requests are failing in odd ways. We should really look into fixing or removing faulty tests.\n. This may be related to #142.\n\n> panic: Fail in goroutine after TestInotifyStress has completed\n. Yes, we should be using `filepath.Join`.\n\nFor the moment, does it work to just watch `\"c:\"`?\n. Hi. File notifications have a tendency of not working across shares (NFS, Vagrant mounts), but it is curious that changing a file in virtualbox worked in the container. I haven't tested this particular case myself.\n\nAs far as the events passed, how are you changing the file? That may be related to how a text editor makes the change. See #17.\n\nWhat are you hoping to accomplish? If you need to detect changes to files on the Windows host, as seems to be the case, you will most likely need to watch the files in Windows and then trigger whatever action you need.\n\nIf instead you are looking to watch files inside the vagrant box, it's best to use a directory that isn't shared from the Windows host, as that usually won't work (as you've seen).\n. Thanks for investigating this further. Unfortunately the underlying file notification systems have some limitations and differences, which make it difficult to get the consistent behaviour we would all like to have. If we can improve something though, we'll certainly try.\n. looks good. thanks\n. Something is flaky with Mac tests, but the Windows tests on Appveyor passed.\n\nNotice that it's logging events with `\\\\` double slashes everywhere though. Hm.\n. Yah, don't worry about the the Mac tests. That's a separate issue.\n\nYou can see the output in Appveyor (Windows CI) by clicking the link: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/NathanYoungman/fsnotify/build/1.0.209\n\nIt may just be a %q vs. %s thing. I'll double check before merging/releasing this.\n. Merged. I still have to tag a release and update the changelog, etc.\n\nThanks Bruno\n. Not currently. Some platforms include a flag for that but not all. Currently fsnotify is doing the lowest common denominator thing and not reporting it, as opposed to doing an os.Stat to always provide that information.\n. > IN_CLOEXEC\n> Set the close-on-exec (FD_CLOEXEC) flag on the new file descriptor. See the description of the O_CLOEXEC flag...\n> \n> O_CLOEXEC (Since Linux 2.6.23)\n> Enable the close-on-exec flag for the new file descriptor. Specifying this flag permits a program to avoid additional fcntl(2) F_SETFD operations to set the FD_CLOEXEC flag. Additionally, use of this flag is essential in some multithreaded programs since using a separate fcntl(2) F_SETFD operation to set the FD_CLOEXEC flag does not suffice to avoid race conditions where one thread opens a file descriptor at the same time as another thread does a fork(2) plus execve(2).\n\nfsnotify currently uses InotifyInit (not InotifyInit1).\n\n> inotify_init() first appeared in Linux 2.6.13; library support was added to glibc in version 2.4.\n> inotify_init1() was added in Linux 2.6.27; library support was added to glibc in version 2.9.\n\nThis is fine (IMO).\n\nWhat about support on ARM and PPC64? /cc @suihkulokki @TheTincho @clnperez @laboger @tophj-ibm?\n. @TheTincho That would be very helpful. Thanks. `inotify_init1` and the flags it takes. The code change is in #178.\n\nI wonder if we should be using `IN_NONBLOCK` as well? (#5) https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify/blob/master/inotify_poller.go#L48\n. Is there any reason why someone would want the child process to have the inotify file descriptor carried over? \n\nPresumably a new one would be created in the child process instead if needed.\n. Thanks. Still need to look into these flaky tests.\n. Maybe the terminology is confusing? The path on Linux should be relative to whatever you are monitoring. If the current working directory was `tmp` and you monitored `EFlmKJ8XTYmnxQIucRkY2A/` then you should see `EFlmKJ8XTYmnxQIucRkY2A/qmp.sock` (relative to tmp).\n\nWhether the filename is included or not doesn't make the path absolute rather than relative.\n\nIf you want to strip off qmp.sock for some reason, you can always use `filepath.Dir()` from the standard library.\n. It is relative to the folder being monitored.\n\nIf you monitor `/home/go/src` then the notification paths will include `/home/go/src/...`. If you monitor `src` then the path will only include `src/...`. In order to do the later, your current working directory matters.\n\nNot saying it's the best thing. Maybe the paths returned should always be absolute. It would probably work to just call `filepath.Abs` on the path you want to monitor rather than every path returned for a notification -- though we'd need to verify it across each platform.\n. I opened an issue for this (#160). Thanks for bringing it up.\n. it looks like there is a data race to fix\n. Still seeing data races on Travis. Doh!\n\nSpecifically on macOS. The race on Linux is resolved.\n. data races in all the places\n\nwill come back to that one. \ud83d\udca4 \n. on macOS Sierra 10.12\n\n```\n\u276f go test -race -test.count=10\nPASS\nok      github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify    104.165s\n\nfsnotify git/master  \n\u276f go16 test -race -test.count=10\n```\n\n... the later doesn't seem to be finishing anytime soon\n\n```\n\u276f go16 test -race \n# testmain\nfatal error: unexpected signal during runtime execution\n...\n```\n\nBut then Go 1.6 doesn't work on Sierra anyway.

The only problem with using `.x` is we need to wait for Travis CI to update their aliases, but they are in place now. I will update.\r\n\r\nSee: https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-build/pull/956. fsnotify doesn't currently support a file closed event -- I don't believe every platform that fsnotify supports has such a event.\n. Thanks for the report @jiangytcn.\n\nWe are running the tests with `-race` yet it hasn't caught this issue. From your description, it sounds like it rarely occurs, which is going to make it hard to track down.\n\nPlease let us known what `go version` you are using and if possible, include some sample code for how you are using fsnotify. Thanks.\n. Thanks @oozie and @jiangytcn. Related to #168.\n. @ishustava regarding ginkgo, see https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify/issues/167 for the discussion. thanks.\n. Hi Slawek. I would rather not introduce a testing dependency in fsnotify or other libraries I work on. I believe it's easier for contributors to use the baseline standard library tests that everyone should be familiar with. Personally I'm not a fan of BDD-style DSLs in Go. Nathan.\n. When I first started using fsnotify I had the same question and wrote all the code to remove the watchers only to find that the remove failed because the watch was already gone. I was using kqueue on macOS at the time, so I'm not 100% sure for inotify on Linux.\n. Documenting that it's unnecessary would be good -- though it would be good if it handled removing better as well.\n. Thanks @oozie. Still need to deal with flaky kqueue tests in #162 also -- not sure if that's related.\n\nI've not seen a pointer to a Mutex in common practice, so this is interesting. \n\nDo you think it would be worth restructuring the code further to make it clear what the mutex guards? I really like this idea: https://talks.golang.org/2015/tricks.slide#15\n. Renames and moves is certainly less than ideal in fsnotify -- not only with inotify, but across all operating systems. See also #26.\n. FYI, epoll was added in #66. It certainly complicates the code quite a lot.\n. related #170\n. Should this effort include fanotify on Linux as well? #114. @tiwaana Sounds awesome. Is the next DTC meetup the Feb 16 launch party for Go 1.8?. I merged #175. Want to rebase and give this another go on Travis?\n. Both locally and your remote? :cry: \nSorry, I guess I did ask you to rebase on master. Darn rebase.\n\nA new PR is fine by me though.\n. Thanks.\n\nOut of curiosity, what error occurred when the linter didn't build? I'm a bit surprised over the issue.\n. Oh, I see.\n\n```\n# github.com/golang/lint\n../../golang/lint/lint.go:249: undefined: types.ImportMode\n```\n\nfrom https://travis-ci.org/fsnotify/fsnotify/jobs/165118920\n\nThere is a closed issue with a similar error https://github.com/golang/lint/issues/246\n\nAnd lint doesn't test itself on Go 1.5.4 \n\nhttps://github.com/golang/lint/commit/e39d62944f60e7296290f116b5f99ac3a4d1fce3#diff-354f30a63fb0907d4ad57269548329e3\n.

Sorry, I can't accept a pull request that isn't cross platform.\n\nbut see #173\n. Thanks for reporting the issue. Would you mind elaborating with specifically what you do with inotify-tools that does work for those not familiar with it?\n. I've setup GitHub teams for each platform. If you have already contributed to fsnotify and would like to be added to a platform-specific team, please let myself or another maintainer know.\n. @zchee Initially I'm thinking we build up repositories for https://github.com/fsnotify/inotify, etc. independent of the fsnotify package. Then start replacing the low-level bits of the fsnotify package with dependencies on those, while maintaining the same cross-platform API.\n\nEventually we can also substitute kqueue for fsevents on darwin.\n\nIf you'd like to help out, take a look at the https://github.com/fsnotify/fsevents project. There is an open issue with some next steps there, and I'm sure there's much more to do.\n. They are quite different. Right now I'm not thinking of changing the API of fsnotify. Just keep it stable for users.\n\nIf we can separate the code into low-level bits and high-level bits, I think it will be easier to maintain, as separate teams of people will be able to focus on each platform, with one team on cross-platform concerns.\n\nNot sure if I'm explaining it well, it might be easier to show than explain.\n\nI've already started with kqueue, where the code from line 463 on is the low level part. https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify/blob/master/kqueue.go#L463. I'm thinking of putting that in a separate repo with a test suite and documentation and making that into it's own library that fsnotify depends on. \n\nStill many details to work out though -- and certainly open to other ideas.\n. I could still really use some help to maintain fsnotify. Code reviews, testing and merging PRs, doing releases.. Clearly I have been doing a poor job of maintaining fsnotify. Issues without answers, pull requests left open for months... progress has stalled not due to lack of contributors, but because I am currently the bottleneck.\r\n\r\nWhen I got involved with Chris Howey's fsnotify, it was to help out with the API. I don't have the experience and knowledge of file systems necessary to vet a pull request like #124, which adds epoll to kqueue. Much less take on a whole new platform like #196. At first I thought I would learn these things, but doing so hasn't been a priority in what spare time I do have.\r\n\r\nI had hoped that having a generous policy (#126) for granting commit access combined with this call for maintainers would see a team of people volunteer to help maintain fsnotify. I had high hopes for splitting responsibility by operating system to make maintenance more palatable. But that hasn't happened... and I don't know what needs to be done for that to happen.\r\n\r\nAt this point, I am tired of feeling guilty for not being more involved in the project. I'm also tired of worrying that merging a pull request will break an upstream like Docker or a platform that isn't under CI (#136).\r\n\r\nI haven't been very involved lately, so it's time to make it official. I'm stepping away from the fsnotify project. It's up to you now.\r\n\r\nIf you need something from me during the transition, reach out to me here or on #fsnotify on [Slack](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/). Good luck.\r\n. Relevant: https://github.com/blog/2392-introducing-code-owners. thanks @vahe. \n\nMaybe the FAQ and other documentation would be more visible if it were moved from the GitHub Wiki to the website? What do you two think?\n\nhttps://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify.org\n. Moving the FAQ to the README sounds good. Let's do it.\n. Hi @Allendar. The example we have is correct and tested by the test suite. I'm not sure what the confusion is here, but I'm closing this issue.\n. updated and merged. thanks. Sorry for the delay. I'll try to carve out some time over the Christmas holiday to work on fsnotify.. @twpayne Thanks and apologies for the delay. @ppknap Thanks also for reviewing.\r\n\r\nOne consideration is the performance of wide vs. narrow mutexes:\r\nhttps://talks.golang.org/2017/state-of-go.slide#25\r\n\r\nBut I think this is a good change, and we can come back to performance considerations later.\r\n\r\nI'll take a closer look and merge + prepare a release in the next few days. Thanks!. @twpayne It's only abandonware if nobody steps in to replace me.\r\n\r\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/Ix4sg_gDLNE\r\nsee #183. @twpayne No worries. \r\n\r\nYou are right, for a Linux-only change, CI is enough and hitting merge is fine. Thanks @ppknap for reviewing and merging.\r\n\r\n@twpayne Did you happen to sign the Google CLA at some point? That process still needs to be automated. #193.\r\n\r\nThere are a few more steps to do a release which should probably be documented somewhere. Updating the AUTHORS file, CHANGELOG, and Releases after tagging a version. Creating an issue around that: #201.. Thanks for reporting the issue.\r\n\r\nI've not tested fsnotify with gccgo yet, nor do we have it set up in CI. That would be a good idea.. related: #22, #131 . I think this needs more discussion before opening any pull requests, as it likely involves an addition or change to the API, and fsnotify is a cross-platform API.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion of exposing a file-system specific mask might not be such a bad idea. See [FileInfo](https://golang.org/pkg/os/#FileInfo) as an example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSys() interface{}   // underlying data source (can return nil)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso see #173 regarding the spinning out of a stand-alone package specifically for Linux.\r\n. @radu-munteanu I'm hoping a few people step up to build and maintain the inotify spin-off. Then there is still some amount of work to integrate that back into fsnotify with a cross-platform API.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if > 32 or > 64 ops would really be necessary, but it is certainly worth considering alternative approaches to the API for the spin-off. \r\n\r\nHoping to keep the cross-platform fsnotify API itself fairly stable.. kqueue (BSD) also has NOTE_CLOSE_WRITE and NOTE_CLOSE.. Thanks @willnorris.\r\n\r\nThe licensing and CLA has felt awkward to me for a long time (#119). Let me confirm if the Go team still has any plans to use fsnotify in core. I'll post to the golang-dev mailing list and drop a link here.\r\n\r\nWhat would need to change for Google to be the project maintainer? If there were some Google employees maintaining fsnotify, would that be sufficient? I'm happy to pass over the reigns to make it work.. Using fsnotify in core, license and CLA \r\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-dev/UwNizs08YD0. @willnorris I would really like to sort out the licensing issue. Thanks.\r\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-dev/UwNizs08YD0. @bradfitz suggests doing something similar to Camlistore. From https://github.com/camlistore/go4/#details:\r\n\r\n> CLA compliant contributors must agree to the Google CLA (the same as Go itself). This ensures we can move things into Go as necessary in the future. It also makes lawyers at various companies happy. The CLA is not a copyright assignment; you retain the copyright on your work. The CLA just says that your work is open source and you have permission to open source it. See https://golang.org/doc/contribute.html#tmp_6\r\n\r\nHere are the instructions from @willnorris. I suspect we will want the CLA checking for the whole organization, including fsevents or any new repos created. The fsnotify.org website doesn't really need it, but why not.\r\n\r\n>Here's the instructions to enable CLA checking for fsnotify.  You can do it either at the organization level, in which case it will apply to all repos in the org, or just to the individual repos you want it activated for.  The same webhook secret will work in either case.\r\n\r\n>1. Give googlebot write access to the repos.  Adding as an outside collaborator is fine, or you can add the account to the org if you don't want to setup each repo individually.  Up to you.  Write access is needed in order to set commit statuses and issue labels.\r\n\r\n>2. If you want googlebot to set issue labels, go ahead and create the labels \"cla: yes\" and \"cla: no\".  If you don't care about the labels, and will just check for the commit status, then just don't create them and googlebot won't try to add them.\r\n\r\n>3. Add a new webhook to the org or repo:\r\n\r\n>Payload URL: https://cla.developers.google.com/api/github/webhook\r\n>Content type: application/json\r\n>Secret: [elided, ask]\r\n>Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?\r\n>Select \"Let me select individual events\" and then select only \"Issue comment\" and \"Pull Request\".\r\n>Active: this should be checked\r\n\r\n>That should be it.\r\n\r\n>Most of the time it should go pretty smoothly.  The one edge case that we don't handle well is when someone is submitting a PR containing commits that they did not author themselves.  In that case, the comment from googlebot should hopefully explain the situation pretty well.  It's a case where we rely on a human being (you) to do a little bit of legwork and go ahead and merge the commit, even though the official status from googlebot says that things aren't okay.  I've got a feature request outstanding to try and handle this case better.\r\n. @4ad @amitkris Please review.. @gfrey We don't currently have a good way to test Solaris, either with a CI service or locally from a different OS (I use [Vagrant Gopher](https://github.com/nathany/vagrant-gopher) for Linux/BSD). Any suggestions?. @gfrey Thanks both for this pull request and your work on Vagrant Gopher to test it.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\u276f vagrant ssh solaris -c 'go version; cd fsnotify/fsnotify; go test ./...'\r\ngo version go1.8 solaris/amd64\r\n/export/home/vagrant/src/github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify\r\nok      github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify    8.332s\r\nConnection to 127.0.0.1 closed.\r\n```\r\n\r\n(unfortunately no race detector on Solaris)\r\n\r\nI'm still hoping @4ad and/or @amitkris provide a review, but I will also take a closer look in the coming days.. Sounds like a mighty good idea, though I have no insight into what has changed since the last release, or if it's \"safe\" to tag a new release.\r\n\r\nAs per [my comment here](https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify/issues/183#issuecomment-286456045), I haven't been following the project since March.. Thanks @thaJeztah.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I haven't gotten around to #201 to describe how releases have been done in the past. Not that the process couldn't be modified to suit whoever takes up the baton. \ud83d\ude09 . Should we also suggest the use of dep for the next release? https://github.com/golang/dep\r\n\r\nIt may not change the actual release process beyond initial updates to the README.. With [internal package support](http://golang.org/s/go14internal) in Go 1.4, it's possible that go/cmd could use fsnotify in Go 1.5 but not yet provide os/fsnotify. It just depends on whether or not fsnotify is ready to take on the [Go 1 compatibility guarantee](https://golang.org/doc/go1compat) at that time.\n\n/cc @rsc @davecheney \n. There are some challenges to getting fsnotify into the standard library.\n- Designing a suitable (low-level) API.\n- ~~Not depending on C code.~~\n  \n  FSEvents (#11), at least in the [current implementation](https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsevents) contains C code.\n  \n  > \"The goal of the dev.cc branch is to eliminate all C code from the Go libraries and then remove the C compiler that we have been maintaining as part of the toolchain.\" - @rsc http://golang.org/s/dev.cc\n  \n  ~~Unless this only applies to [C code like this](http://dave.cheney.net/2013/09/07/how-to-include-c-code-in-your-go-package) and not cgo.~~\n  \n  The net package uses C code, so this comment is probably specific to the libraries that are part of runtime. My bad.\n- The syscall dependency. Syscall is frozen as of Go 1.3, with any additions being made to [x/sys](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/sys). So far fsnotify doesn't require anything new in x/sys, but if it ever does, the necessary portions will need to become internal packages of fsnotify (to avoid having stdlib depend on x/sys).\n. Given the improvements to tools to vendor code (GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT) and support for internal/ packages, I see less value in trying to bring this into the standard library. If the go tool or godoc need to use fsnotify, it can be copied in as an internal package.\n\nMaybe an x/ package that uses Gerrit, the builders, and the CLA.\n\nOr if maintained as an independent package, perhaps the BSD license should be tweaked and the CLA requirement dropped.\n. @matthias-stone reproduced the issue:\n\n> So, looking at this in GDB the following squirrelly behaviour occurs: breaking and continuing the code \n> clears the leaked file descriptors.\n> \n> Executed with \n> \n> ``` console\n> gdb --args ./fsnotify.test -test.cpu=1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\n> -test.v -test.run=TestFsnotifyDeleteWatchedDir\n> ```\n> \n> Sample of leaked file descriptor - note the `anon_inode:inotify`\n> \n> ```\n> total 0\n> lrwx------ 1 matthias users 64 Jun 21 20:17 0 -> /dev/pts/40\n> lrwx------ 1 matthias users 64 Jun 21 20:17 1 -> /dev/pts/40\n> lr-x------ 1 matthias users 64 Jun 21 20:17 10 -> anon_inode:inotify\n> lr-x------ 1 matthias users 64 Jun 21 20:17 11 -> anon_inode:inotify\n> lr-x------ 1 matthias users 64 Jun 21 20:17 12 -> anon_inode:inotify\n> lr-x------ 1 matthias users 64 Jun 21 20:17 13 -> anon_inode:inotify\n> lr-x------ 1 matthias users 64 Jun 21 20:17 14 -> anon_inode:inotify\n> lr-x------ 1 matthias users 64 Jun 21 20:17 15 -> anon_inode:inotify\n> lr-x------ 1 matthias users 64 Jun 21 20:19 16 -> anon_inode:inotify\n> lr-x------ 1 matthias users 64 Jun 21 20:19 18 -> anon_inode:inotify\n> lrwx------ 1 matthias users 64 Jun 21 20:17 2 -> /dev/pts/40\n> lrwx------ 1 matthias users 64 Jun 21 20:17 3 -> socket:[289525025]\n> lrwx------ 1 matthias users 64 Jun 21 20:17 4 -> socket:[289525026]\n> lr-x------ 1 matthias users 64 Jun 21 20:17 5 -> pipe:[289525027]\n> l-wx------ 1 matthias users 64 Jun 21 20:17 6 -> pipe:[289525027]\n> lr-x------ 1 matthias users 64 Jun 21 20:17 7 -> anon_inode:inotify\n> lr-x------ 1 matthias users 64 Jun 21 20:17 8 -> anon_inode:inotify\n> lr-x------ 1 matthias users 64 Jun 21 20:17 9 -> anon_inode:inotify\n> ```\n. I don't know what I'm doing :-1: \n\n```\nstrace: Can't stat './fsnotify.test': No such file or directory\n\nGNU gdb (Ubuntu 7.7.1-0ubuntu5~14.04.2) 7.7.1\n./fsnotify.test: No such file or directory.\n```\n. I noticed that `inotify_init1()` has a `IN_NONBLOCK` option in Linux 2.6.27+ (Go 1.3 requires Linux 2.6.23)\n\nhttp://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/inotify_init1.2.html\n. Also related: https://github.com/howeyc/fsnotify/issues/7\n\n> Desire is to have the library send events/errors using select so that the receiving application can be monitoring the channels without the use of a separate goroutine.\n. #39 could solve this.\n. My current suggestion is to set the Op filter globally at the Watcher level instead of for each Watch added. Preferably in such a way that it cannot be changed later. Perhaps something like:\n\n``` go\nwatcher, err := fsnotify.NewWatcher(fsnotify.Create|fsnotify.Write)\n```\n- The filter can be passed to each adapter to have the OS filter out events the best it can.\n- A final user-space filter can catch any outliers without requiring the significant amount of bookkeeping of the previous implementation.\n- For the same reasons that directory watches are easier to manage, a user-space recursive watcher will be simpler to implement, whether included in fsnotify or externally.\n. @tsuna The problem with adding a new API like that is that the flags differ from platform to platform. That's partly why I'd like to split out inotify #173 so it can be used independently in special Linux-only cases.\n\nThis issue is tracking a more general solution, which may be a ways off yet.\n. Pull requests are welcome, and once we have more people reviewing and merging pull requests, things should start to move faster. \n\nI think breaking out the low-level platform specific libraries (such as #173) will also help there. It should allow experts in inotify to work on that without worrying about the cross-platform API, and others to tackle cross-platform consistency without dealing with all the low-level details.\n. leaking descriptors #59 didn't help any.\n. I've never even thought of extending it to webhook notifications like Dropbox and Google Drive provide. Interesting idea. Not sure if it belongs in this package, but having a common interface in top could be cool.\n\nThe sql driver model is one I've been thinking about, particularly if there are multiple options for a given OS.\n. Indeed. It also fits with another desire I have, which is to make it easier to contribute to without being knowledgable of every single platform. Separate drivers for inotify, kqueue, etc. would be one way to achieve that.\n. Yah, polling is the only option for NFS as far as I know. You can also check https://github.com/rjeczalik/notify but I don't think it has polling yet either.\n. Please do submit a pull request.\n. @omeid I don't have any plans for what a driver interface would look like yet (and to be honest, I haven't done much work on fsnotify lately).\n\nPersonally, I'd prefer to see the current code base cleaned up before doing a big API change. The Windows internals are particularity crufty. \nhttps://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/milestones/v2%20Internals\n\nMaybe we could start a new issue to figure out the details of transitioning to a driver model?\n. @cpuguy83 Do you think you would be able to add polling without changing the API? Maybe just for operating systems that fsnotify doesn't currently support?\n\nThere are other situations where polling would be desirable, but I'm not sure how to detect them, or if it should be done more manually (which is why a driver-style API is relevant to this discussion).\n. In terms of API, here are related issues #104 and #75. \n\nPolling should also help with #45 for Windows users.\n. @mdwhatcott @cpuguy83 Would you be willing to build a stand-alone `fsnotify/polling` package that could be incorporated into fsnotify as a secondary step?\n\nIf so, I'll create a repo called polling or poller or whatever you prefer.\n\nFor me the key considerations are:\n- providing a speedy implementation as outlined in the original post\n- a simple and idiomatic Go API specifically for polling\n- solid unit and/or integration tests (preferably without any external testing dependencies to keep it simple)\n- well documented both in the README, examples, and API docs\n. ok.\n\nHere is a polling watcher by @radovskyb https://github.com/radovskyb/watcher\n. @radovskyb Hey Benjamin, Would you be interested in transferring watcher into the fsnotify organization and working on it here? Still as a stand-alone repository for the time being.\n\nThe API already looks pretty close to fsnotify. \n\nOnce some of the low-level bits are extracted from fsnotify (e.g. #173) I'd like to incorporate polling into fsnotify as a fallback, while still allowing people to use the  poller directly if that's all they want.\n. Work has begun on this as an external project that can eventually be used from fsnotify.\nhttps://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsevents\n\nTODO:\n- [ ] Integration tests\n- [ ] Refine API\n- [ ] EventFlags.String()\n. Would it make sense to work in a monorepo for fsnotify? Bring the fsevents library into a subfolder and work on it here, even before it's integrated and used by fsnotify.\n. Some people are using fsnotify/fsevents so we'd probably leave it there and just move maintenance here. We could put a message up over there -- or not.\n\nI'm still undecided whether it should be `internal/` here initially.\n. I'm also not sure if we should try to move fsnotify towards this new driver system (#104), or build out something entirely new. Perhaps coming back later to retrofit fsnotify on top of an intermediary API.\n. For me personally, my first step would be to get Vagrant setup with a [Solaris box](https://vagrantcloud.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&sort=&provider=&q=solaris) with Go installed. Preferably via https://github.com/nathany/vagrant-gopher.\n. @4ad Amit (@amitkris) is currently working on FEN support. Would you be willing to review his pull request when it is ready?\n. This is likely the cause of _TestFsnotifySubdir fails intermittently on Mac OS X 10.9.2:_\n- https://github.com/howeyc/fsnotify/issues/67\n- https://code.google.com/p/go/issues/detail?id=8147\n. no updates yet. the plan to fix this is to use FSEvents (#11) which currently exists as a stand-alone project but isn't integrated into fsnotify:\r\nhttps://github.com/fsnotify/fsevents\r\n. @kevinburke sorry to hear that. \ud83d\ude22 \r\n\r\nIs there something that could be added to the Spotlight mention in the README to improve finding the issue?. Each OS is likely to be a little different. Here's a little research on kqueue: https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/issues/24#issuecomment-55539850\n\nEssentially: not watching the files in kqueue will result in **no event at all** when a file is touched/updated. (not even, hey, something changed in this directory)\n\nStill need to do research on inotify and Windows.\n. TextMate2 (OS X) use the exchangedata system call to perform the saves (not sure what that is). But Hugo users are having problems detecting saves: https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/1053#issuecomment-116778527\n. > Godoc is a relatively small program. It is built from 102 packages built from 582 source files. We certainly want to be able to build programs larger than godoc. It appears that Linux inotify will let you watch individual directories for changes within that directory, so for godoc you are looking at a little over 102 inotify watches. For OS X, fsevents will let you watch whole subtrees, so for godoc built from 1 GOROOT and 1 GOPATH entry you are looking at 2 fsevents watches.  For Microsoft Windows, FindFirstChangeNotification looks like it might be usable similar to fsevents. For Solaris, file event notifications (FEN) only apply to individual files or directories, and watching a directory inode does not appear to tell you about modifications made to files in that directory, so for godoc you are looking at almost 700 FEN watches. That might take a little while to set up, but assuming the kernel has no hard limits, it should be fine. Speaking of limits... For BSD (or OS X if you don't like fsevents), kqueue has the same \"enumerate every file or directory\" requirement as Solaris FEN, but you give them to the kernel not as file names but as file descriptors. It appears that the file descriptor must remain open while you are watching that file, so the per-process file descriptor limit imposes a limit on the number of things you can watch. Worse, the per-system file descriptor limit imposes a limit on the number of things anyone on the system can watch. The typical kernel limit on a BSD is only on the order of 10,000 file descriptors for the entire machine. - @rsc, https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-dev/bShm2sqbrTY/IR8eI20Su8EJ \n- The limits for FEN (Solaris) are high enough (#12) that a recursive watcher should be possible.\n- It's possible that kqueue (BSD, iOS) can't reasonably support a recursive watcher. For large trees, users may need to resort to Polling (#9) or another mechanism.\n. It should work. Most of the tricky issues are with too many resources being consumed. Also, we would ideally take advantage of native recursive watching on the operating systems that support it.\n. No update for fsnotify, but take a look at https://github.com/rjeczalik/notify as an alternative.\n. Rafal's notify library uses FSEvents on OS X instead of kqueue, so it doesn't have that problem on OS X. \n. As does fsnotify.\n. > Maybe the underlying file system event handling differs by platform.\n\nYes, it does.\n. Nothing yet.\n. This is closely related to #17 but specifically for Linux.\n. @rjeczalik Thanks for chiming in. I only heard of your notify project this past week. I'm really interested in taking a closer look at it.\n\n@edrex yah, there are too many little platform differences to trip up on. :dizzy_face: \n. I've written a rudimentary implementation of kqueue (on OS X):\nhttps://github.com/fsnotify/fslog\n. I tried a nil timeout but there is more work involved. Currently `syscall.Close(w.kq)` is in the same for loop that blocks. Instead it should be called directly by `watcher.Close()` which will cause the read to abort, after which it can clean up and return.\n. FreeBSD 10.0 behaves a bit differently:\n- Closing the kq descriptor doesn't abort the current read, in fact I still get the next event.\n- Then when setting up the next read, we of course get _Kevent: bad file descriptor_.\n\nIt's not a huge deal if we're calling Close() before shutting down the app, but if not, then the Read goroutine will sit there blocking until it gets another event to send over the channel. And if I do a proper cleanup to DELETE the events, that next event will never come.\n. When registering file descriptors to watch, this could be useful if registering multiple watches at once (such as all the files in a directory):\n\n> If an error occurs while processing an element of the changelist and there is enough room in the eventlist, then the event will be placed in the eventlist with EV_ERROR set in flags and the system error in data. Otherwise, -1 will be returned, and errno will be set to indicate the error condition. \n\nOtherwise I don't think I need to check for EV_ERROR. Fsnotify was doing this check, but eventlist was nil, so it should never be the case.\n. When watching a directory with kqueue it reports:\n- a Write when a file is created or deleted\n- a Write and Link when a subdirectory is created or deleted\n- nothing at all when a file is touched (updated)\n- but it does report a Write if modified by an editor that does an atomic save (create and rename)\n\nfsnotify currently adds to this:\n- watches all files in a directory to report updates to specific files. \n- watches for deletes on subdirectories to report the deleted subdirectory, not just a Write+Link\n- when a Write happens on a directory, it scans the directory for any new files/subdirectories and presents them as create events\n. In relation to #16, I was thinking of actually having an event of \"something happened in this directory, but we don't know what.\" Then the scanning and comparing of the files in a directory could be a separate utility function instead of built into `readEvents()`. It could be used for determining which directory was deleted as well.\n\nBut there is still the problem of touching files not reporting any event at all. As well as making the calling code different for kqueue.\n. Leaving this in for now as a debugging aid. it doesn't prevent anyone from writing a utility function to represent Event in another way. \n. @jaytaylor this is still something I need to research across platforms to see what can be done. Sorry for moving so slow,\n. @jmhodges Do you have any more details on \"Weird Things\" vim does? Is this when saving or is there a rename file function people are using in Vim?\n. ref: https://github.com/rjeczalik/notify/issues/78\n. not as of yet.\n. Thanks.\n\nHave you already signed the Go CLA? See the README. \n. Merged as fcd23cde655be3a4e721bd452abc33400136291c.\n\nThanks!\n. I suppose one disadvantage is that other (possibly temporary) repos such as go-fsnotify/fsevents couldn't make use of gopkg.in?\n. Good point. And I could create go-fsevents if that project took a life of its own.\n. A little maddening for autocomplete on the command line. `go-*` Oh well.\n. Whoops. Thanks @mewmew.\n. Thanks for the suggestion. The current API isn't final for sure, we definitely want to change how error handling works: #2.\n. There was an issue opened at https://github.com/howeyc/fsnotify/issues/7 regarding the requirement for a goroutine in the calling code.\n\n#5 is part of looking at that, specifically on Linux.\n\nfor BSD I've found that having kqueue block #24 results in less CPU utilization when idle, but doing so may make it harder to avoid having a goroutine in the calling code\n. @akavel Add() isn't recursive right now. See #18, #21 and #11.\n\nThe documentation certainly needs some work. I will leave this issue open until that happens. Thanks.\n. That may be a limit of kqueue when there is no watch on the file/directory where the file is being moved/renamed to. I need to take a closer look.\n\nI'm going to close this issue in favour of a #26.\n. FSEvents (OS X) and Windows have support for recursive watching. I'm not yet sure how they behave when doing `mkdir -p a/b/c`. Once that is determined, it may make sense to emulate that behaviour elsewhere.\n. Thanks @zhsso. I'll test it out shortly.\n\nDo you happen to know the difference between `filepath.Clean` and `path.Clean`?\n. Thanks for looking into it. Sounds like we're on the right path. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: \n\nI'm going to tackle #34 before I merge this in and do a new release later today.\n. @zhsso I forgot to mention\n\nContributors retain their copyright, so we need you to fill out a short form before we can accept your contribution: [Google Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual).\n\nHave you already signed the Go CLA?\n. Thanks very much @zhsso.\n. While [renaming the tags](http://stackoverflow.com/a/5719854/1684322) is easy enough, it also makes it look like I've been doing breaking changes in the v1 line. I'm inclined to just remove the tags for v0.10.0 through v0.14.3 entirely. \n\nDoing so accomplishes the same goal of getting v0 to match howeyc/fsnotify while v1 is the new API.\n. Deleted tags:\n- 'v0.10.0' (was 56a7b52)\n- 'v0.10.1' (was 620bfd9)\n- 'v0.11.0' (was b97c307)\n- 'v0.12.0' (was efe9224)\n- 'v0.13.0' (was 4a0c411)\n- 'v0.14.0' (was 960fdf5)\n- 'v0.14.1' (was 06d7792)\n- 'v0.14.2' (was f65830e)\n- 'v0.14.3' (was 2acad09)\n. importers of go.exp/fsnotify on bitbucket:\n- https://bitbucket.org/kardianos/service/pull-request/8/use-fsnotifyv0/diff (updated to v1 with https://bitbucket.org/kardianos/service/commits/562e4b3201a3d51f2d963044ab7823d17970ab91)\n- https://bitbucket.org/ronoaldo/whenchange/pull-request/1/use-fsnotifyv0/diff (merged)\n. @kylelemons I don't know how to submit a pull request to http://kylelemons.net/browse/gitweb.cgi/go/gofr.git/tree, but please checkout fsnotify.v0 or v1.\n\n~~I don't know why https://github.com/laughlinez/flow is listed in importers because I see no reference to fsnotify in its code or in https://github.com/jcw/flow from which it was forked. /cc @garyburd~~\n\nThat takes care of everyone [importing](http://godoc.org/code.google.com/p/go.exp/fsnotify?importers) from go.exp/fsnotify, except for forks of other repositories.\n. This conversation sums up the confusion around having several places to find fsnotify: https://github.com/bmatsuo/gutterd/pull/2#issuecomment-52442275\n. @garyburd Sorry, I don't know why I didn't see that. :blush: \n. An open letter suggesting that go.exp/fsnotify be deprecated in favour of this repository.\nhttps://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-dev/-__vD-kOF5s/v8eLY271-ucJ\n.

CL to remove x/exp/fsnotify\nhttps://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/3990/\n\nHere are the commits to x/exp/fsnotify:\nhttps://go.googlesource.com/exp/#\n. HI Yukang. Thanks for the submission.\n\nThis example doesn't actually send anything over the `done` channel, so I'm not 100% sure. \n\nI suppose having the example not exit immediately is good, even if Ctrl-C is required.\n. Alright. You win. :smile:\n. Just some C code that uses kqueue and inotify. Might be some useful tidbits, like their check_create for kqueue does a timestamp comparison before a (slower) hash lookup.\n. Thanks for working on this @chamaken. I left a few comments.\n. Feel free to add more commits here or open a new pull request.\n\nEpoll vs. select is up to you. Whichever works better.\n\nThanks @chamaken \n. @chamaken I'm not familiar with either, so I don't know. \n\nWe could try epoll and see how it goes. We could also request a code review from people on golang-nuts and see what we get back?\n. @chamaken Since I don't know when I'll read my Linux book and figure this stuff out, I put out a request for code review on [golang-nuts](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/PoJ1oYi1cXI).\n. Sorry for letting this sit for so long. \n\nEven though this isn't changing the API, I'm beginning to think that such big internal changes should also warrant a new major version and a release candidate, which is something gopkg.in is considering support for: https://github.com/niemeyer/gopkg/issues/25.\n\nI'm still figuring out exactly what this should look like.\n. Hi @chamaken,\n\nI think this is too big of a change for right now. Personally, I still haven't had a chance to learn the various Linux APIs nor have I been able to attract others to help code review and maintain the project.\n\nIf you're interested in helping make some smaller incremental improvements, I'd certainly be grateful. Right now I'm trying to focus on **cleaning up the code** (see 1f65e2ef12aa538ba66b432a0c60279f4406add1) so that lower-level concerns are more isolated.\n\nI'm also trying to get an [fslog project](https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/issues/23) going to help better understand the behaviour of each OS.\n\nThanks for all your work. Nathan.\n. Thanks for the report. I think #39 may address this for inotify. \n\nIn any case, #39 is a pretty big change, so let's get that in first. Feel free to give it a code review.\n. Right now I can only think of two possible ways to remove recursive watches for #18:\n1. keep track of all the folders we watch, this would be like asking it to remove a specific watch we added\n2. just walk the subfolders of a path and remove any watches that exist\n\nI'm in favour of 2, as additional watches could be created, and the API at present takes a path rather than a handle to a previous watch.\n\nHowever, I'd still like to see how Windows and FSEvents (OS X) handle recursive watches and removals before tackling this... which puts it a fair ways off.\n. Quite some time ago I attempted to track all the watched folders independently, but ran into an issue much like #40 in kqueue. I thought the watches were just magically removed when the folder was deleted, but I may have been wrong. (https://github.com/nathany/looper/commit/212051b2ac2b741ac055c68b4ff1434f870401e4)\n\nIt might be worth building a small test case to see if unwatching deleted folders is necessary. I started hacking on [fslog](https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fslog) as a place to do those sort of experiments (without all the other stuff fsnotify adds). But so far it only has kqueue.\n\nIt should be relatively easy to resolve #40, but I'd rather not expose w.watches as an API. It's supposed to be an internal detail.\n. So for 2, fsnotify should itself watch for remove event and do the internal cleanup of w.watches. That could be tricky later on if the user doesn't wish to subscribe to remove events (#7).\n\nBut for now, my focus is on [cleaning up](https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/milestones/v1%20Internal%20cleanup) the existing code, primarily separating the lower-level stuff out. Also doing more research as with 1. Fixing #40 and doing the internal cleanup could fit into that.\n. also see #51 \n. Thanks. Is this occurring specifically on Linux?\n. @ottob Thanks for trying this out.\n\nI presume you did a git bisect to identify that particular commit as the source of the issue?\n\nDo you have the code that's using fsnotify from this branch? Somewhere at https://github.com/ottob/revel?\n\nBasically, I need to get a test case to figure out what's going on and prevent this from breaking in the future.\n. Sounds like a difficult issue to track down. I did introduce a bug in 5997fa2 that was fixed in 8a7f75d. I may rebase pull request so that individual commits aren't introducing bugs (for the benefit of bisect).\n. @ottob I read through Revel's [watcher.go](https://github.com/revel/revel/blob/develop/watcher.go).\n\nI'm not sure if this will help with the problem you ran into, seems unrelated. https://github.com/revel/revel/pull/734\n\nWhich OS are you using? Mac or BSD?\n. @ottob Could you try to get a reproducible case with one of the [sample apps](https://github.com/revel/revel/tree/master/samples) and provide me the steps and OS you're using with a new issue?\n. Thanks @ottob. I haven't figured out Revel, so I'm pretty helpless trying to reproduce it.\n. @ottob Ugh. Thanks for digging into this more. Would you mind copy/pasting your last response into a new issue so it doesn't get missed? Thanks.\n. For sure. Thanks for the heads up Quinn.\n. @sqs Does the fancy linking stuff only work for code that compiles on Linux?\n\nI don't see any fancy stuff for this BSD file:\nhttps://sourcegraph.com/github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify@master/.tree/kqueue.go\n. Or maybe I just need to wait a bit... https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/.builds/515146\n. I'm not sure. It would certainly be nice to have a better error message. \n. I don't have SharePoint, so I'm not able to reproduce this issue.\n\nAccording to the [Windows documentation](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365465%28v=vs.85%29.aspx):\n\n> If the network redirector or the target file system does not support this operation, the function fails with ERROR_INVALID_FUNCTION.\n\nSo I guess that explains it. \n\nMaybe I should add that to the FAQ, or we could change how this error is reported at https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/blob/master/windows.go#L353.\n. strace and gdb with go test -c from #3.\n. Hm. Interesting. Which operating system?\n. Hi Otto. Sorry for not digging into this sooner. I've never used Revel before, but I got the booking sample running with some additional logging (on the develop branch).\n\nYour previous bisect had pointed to 4a0d1ae9df8c61fb8912829fc714f189358a3dc7 being the culprit. Most of those changes are to addWatch, so I added some logging there and compared against ca50e738d35a862c379baf8fffbc3bfd080b3cff. With the result you're seeing, it seems plausible that it was watching more than it was previously. \n\nSo far I haven't figured it out. Still digging. It might be worth confirming that bisect, since you said it wasn't 100% reproducible. If it was a commit before, that could change things quite a lot.\n\nIf there was a medium sized open source Revel app that we could reproduce this on, that would make it much easier. It might even be reproducible with a similar file structure to your app, even if those files don't contain the same code. /cc @robfig \n. @ottob I hope you have Spotlight disabled for your folder, which can randomly decide to create events. https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/wiki/FAQ. \n\nThough if not disabled, I'd expect you'd see the same problems on v1.0.4 as well.\n. ![cannot-reproduce](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4566/5326360/28586750-7cd3-11e4-90f8-3bcb6f21b026.gif)\n. I've ran into a very similar issue here. https://github.com/nathany/looper/issues/18 It is reliably reproducible. Looking into a fix now.\n. @ottob I believe this to be fixed on master. Stupid mistake on my part. Sorry for all the trouble.\n. Feel free to reopen this issue if you still see the issue.\n. It depends a lot on which OS you're using, but you probably want to watch the directory that you will be creating a file in.\n. `syscall.ERROR_MORE_DATA` was added in Go 1.3.\n\nAre you willing to upgrade? http://golang.org/dl/\n. Thanks. I put a mention of Go 1.3 in the README for next time.\n. Thanks for the detailed report. I haven't had a chance to play with the example yet.\n\nOS X is using kqueue, but this may be similar to #40 on Linux (inotify) where fsnotify isn't cleaning up it's internal data for watches.\n. Thanks to your example, I did manage to reproduce the issue on both v1.0.4 (before a bunch of my refactoring) and on the current master. I added some logging into addWatch in kqueue.go.\n\nkqueue.go is maintaining some internal state to map back and forth between filenames and descriptors. If it's a file descriptor that is already being watched, it can modifies what flags are being watched. This is something used internally.\n\nWhen a rename or remove event is fired, it calls the exported `Remove()` method to do some cleanup. For whatever reason it's sending the event on the channel and then doing the cleanup.\n\nThat's been this way since I adopted the code. Flipping those around makes sense to me.\n. The fix is on master. Doing a release soon.\n\nIf you have a chance to test it out, please let me know how it goes.\n. Thanks Matt!\n\nLooking forward to your next contribution. :grinning: \n. Until now I hadn't heard of USN Journals. It sounds worth looking into.\n\nIs this the state-of-the-art not in just Windows 2000, but also Windows 7, 8, 10?\n\nWe do have working code for Windows based on ReadDirectoryChangesW. It is based on [winfsnotify](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/exp/winfsnotify) and everyone who's contributed to it has agreed to the [CLA](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual).  \n\nBut it does need a lot of love (see #6 and #21), and I'm certainly not opposed to doing a fresh implementation if there are APIs that can provide better reliability and closer feature parity to other operating systems.\n. FYI, Go [currently requires](http://golang.org/doc/install#requirements) Windows XP or later, so there is no need to support anything older than that.\n. Is it possible to use USN Journals without Administrator privileges?\n. That's a bit unfortunate.\n\nDo you want me to create a Windows USN repo under go-fsnotify?\n\nWe could bring the code over and make sure everything still works in Go 1.3 & 1.4.\n. Nope. Nobody ever was.\n. Hi. So far this issue has just been a place to collect information about USN. Nobody has begun implementing support for it is fsnotify.\n\nTo support USN directly in fsnotify, I think we'll need a driver system where people can choose between ReadDirectoryChangesW or USN much like choosing a MySQL or Postgres driver. To start, my suggestion would be to build up a stand-alone USN package and then we'll figure out how to integrate it.\n\nThat could be as a subfolder of this repository or a separate repository (I'm happy to create a repo under the go-fsnotify organization if desired).\n\nThere's also plenty of clean up work to do on the current Windows support.\nhttps://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/labels/Windows%20%28ReadDirectoryChangesW%29\n\nThanks\n. If someone is interested in implementing USN, we would probably start by getting it working outside of fsnotify (much like the fsevents package), and then look at bringing it in afterwards.\n\nLet me know if you're interested.\n. Hi @jimzhan. Thanks for the report. I need a little more info.\n\nHow are you writing to the file? Are you using a text editor #17 or touch?\nAre you watching an individual file or he directory containing the file?\nThanks.\n. @jimzhan It's likely to do with \"atomic saves\" in VIM. See #17.\n. I'm not sure what the simple delay trick is? When I use fsnotify, I just treat Create and Write as the same.\n. Thanks for following up. \n. Yah, it would be nice. But unfortunately that's more to do with how the underlying event monitoring systems work and how editors save files than with fsnotify.\n. Hi Matt. Right now it's necessary to launch in a separate Go routine, see https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/blob/master/example_test.go\n\nThis is something that we should address though.\n\nref also in howeyc/fsnotify https://github.com/howeyc/fsnotify/issues/7\n\nI'm not sure if a buffered channel will solve it, but I could give it a try.\n. I tried running this second example and it didn't deadlock here (OS X 10.10 here too).\n\ntouching a file in the same directory `touch fsnotify_issue55.go` resulted in an event at which point it breaks to Loop and sends a message over the done channel and exits.\n\nselect will wait for an event from one of these channels. if you don't want to wait, you could add a `default:` case. I don't think buffered channels would help, that's just the behaviour of select.\n. No problem. More on select:\n\nhttps://gobyexample.com/select\n\nhttp://golang.org/ref/spec#Select_statements\n(In particular bullet point 2)\n. Ops are a bit mask so it is a combination of events (4 as well as 2)\n\nSee the example_test.go to check for individual flags.\n. Thanks for reporting this.\n. @PieterD I'm looking this on OS X and BSD, but it also fails on Linux:\n\nusing `import \"github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify\"`\n\n```\npanic: inotify_init: too many open files\n```\n. Excellent.\n\n**kqueue**:\nThis is interesting, as Close just calls Remove for all watches. Another race condition? \nClose is ignoring the errors that Remove sends back, in this case: \"bad file descriptor\"\n. Thanks @PieterD. I've already merged a fix for OS X, but I have yet to tag a new release. Tomorrow once the epoll stuff is in.\n. @meatballhat Looks like everything is working. Thanks!\n. If you run into the same issue with this repo, please let me know what OS you are using and some example code if possible.\n\nI should really send a CL to remove x/exp/fsnotify.\n. Thanks Pieter.\n\nx/exp is quite a ways behind this repo, but very little has changed on Linux.\n. Thanks for the example. I'll try to take a look on the weekend.\n\nIf you want to try adding some logging into inotify.go and poke around, any help would be appreciated.\n. Thanks very much!\n\nI'll take care of exp/fsnotify.\n. merged.\n. I sent in a CL to remove exp/fsnotify. https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/3990/1\n. merged.\n. Thanks.\n. Have you confirmed that #3 is fixed by this change?\n\nI'll take a closer look and do some QA tomorrow before I merge it in. Thanks again for the help.\n. @PieterD Have you already signed Google's CLA for contributing to Go? (This code base originates from Go exp packages and may one day land in Go).\n\nhttps://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual\n. Thanks. I'm on my way to a hack day, fsnotify will be my project for today.\n. And then it gets interesting. :-)\n. Does IN_NONBLOCK help at all? See #5.\n. I admit I don't understand this stuff. I'm yet to become a Linux guru. :-)\n. A separate PR would be appreciated. Let me get this tested and merged in.\n. \u00fcbermess!\n. Hah. \"awesome\" race conditions. So awesome that `-race` didn't catch it.\n. For the changelog, #5 isn't actually solved yet, correct? (coming next)\n. Squashed and merged. \n\n#5. Doesn't readEvent still block though? That little hack to wake it up on Close might work, but maybe not? \n. kqueue has a timeout right now so that it doesn't block indefinitely, but it does use a little bit of CPU to go around the loop every 100ms.\n. I'm wrong about this. It's fine.\n\nWe want to run `filepath.Clean(name)` on user-input.\n. I'm not sure how I should test this. Based on #59, the second Add should reuse the same file descriptor because Close cleaned up. But I don't want to expose file descriptors to the API.\n. guess i can add a kqueue_test.go for that. ok\n. I like how you separated the poller out into a separate file. But man, this makes it so much more complex.\n. Should there be inotify_poller_test.go?\n. Interesting. \n\nAnother proposal is to have something like `Sys() interface{}` in [FileInfo](http://golang.org/pkg/os/#FileInfo) to retrieve the underlying event data (OS specific bitmask). \n\nThat doesn't address filtering though.\n. Wow, that is odd. Your code looks good to me, so I'm going to have to do some digging.\n\nWhat is your import path and is fsnotify the very latest version?\n. @pbdeuchler It's this line right here:\n\n```\ndefer watcher.Close()\n```\n\nNothing in `Run()` is blocking. When it returns we close down the channels, and closed channels always receive the zero value (which is nil for interfaces like error).\n\nYou probably want to define a separate `func (dr *DiskRecieve) Stop() error` function to call Close later on in your program execution.\n. `event.Op&fsnotify.Write == fsnotify.Write` will never succeed when Events is returning a zero-value Event struct.\n. @PieterD I like how we both saw the issue at the exact same time. :smile: \n. A failing test on a new branch would be a good way to start. :-)\n. The FAQ should be clarified. \n\nIt means that the main goroutine can't be used because it will block.\n. Not `Add` specifically, but the run loop that NewWatcher kicks off. I think it depends on the OS, whether or not the Kernel is blocking. It would be nice to handle all this better internally, but I haven't looked into it that deeply yet. :disappointed: \n. That error would be coming from here: https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/blob/master/windows.go#L448\n\nUnfortunately I don't know the Windows code very well yet. It was inherited from Chris Howey's version of fsnotify, which was inherited from [winfsnotify](https://github.com/golang/exp/tree/master/winfsnotify).\n\nIf you manage to add enough to a code example to reproduce the issue, that would really help.\n. Sorry, I'm still not really sure. :disappointed: \n\nAre you using just an ordinary local directory? And you say it's when there are a lot of files? With a few files it works? Maybe I can reproduce the issue. That would be a good first step.\n. Thanks for the info. I'm not sure when I (or someone else) will have a chance to dig into the Windows code for fsnotify to figure out what's going on. But any details to help reproduce it are helpful.\n. Thanks @chamaken. I can take a look sometime over the next few days.\n. Sorry, I still haven't checked this. :-(\n. Merged. Thanks.\n. Thanks for investigating this @tsuna. Would you mind opening a new issue so this doesn't get lost?\n. Yes. I think we should take another look at this code change. Adding and removing watches from the same goroutine should not cause deadlocks.\n. @metakeule You're right. It does depend on the OS.\n\n#23 is a little project I'd like to do to get a better sense of what each OS is doing. Importantly, that would be done at a lower-level than fsnotify, since fsnotify adds some things on top.\n\nThen I'd like to take that research and write about on the website: https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify.org So far I've dived into kqueue (BSD, OS X), but have yet to write anything up (other than some notes in #24). There are a few more things I need to look into as well, such as renaming #26.\n. What I like most is that fsnotify and other libraries are free to experiment with different APIs and ways of using the underlying bindings. The lowest common denominator interface vs. emulating features in user-land vs. driver-like systems. Meanwhile the bindings themselves can be really solid and reused.\n. #173 seems like a good place to start\n. Thanks for taking the time to contribute.\n\nBut I don't really want to add methods to the Event struct. My preference is to keep a minimal API surface with the bitfields exposed for checking, coalescing, etc. This is based on the design document mentioned in the README.\n\nIf you wants additional methods like this, it's easy enough to convert to a new type and provide them there.\n\nAn article on how to do this (and how bitfields work) would be a better approach IMO. Happy to take contributions to the fsnotify.org blog:\nhttps://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify.org\n. The use of bitmasks and creation of a wrapper could be documented on the blog. Would anyone like to write it up? https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify.org\n. I'm closing this in favour of documentation or a blog post. See #107. Pull requests to the website repo are welcome.\n. Strange. I was pretty sure the the go routine would make a difference (https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsevents/issues/11).\n\nl need to find some time to try out your example.\n. Apparently not. fsnotify uses inotify under the hood when running on Linux:\n\n> /proc is a kernel interface. There are no real files there, hence they can't change. Reading from the handles is a request and the data in the file when you read it is a reply to that. - [StackExchange](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/90627/notify-of-changes-on-a-file-under-proc)\n> \n> The data that you see when you read from the proc filesystem is generated on-the-fly when you do a read from the begining of a file. That is, doing the read causes the data to be generated by a kernel callback function that is specific to the file you are reading. \n. Hi Wang Jing,\nThis looks unusual. Was there a test.yml file there before? When a REMOVE event happens, it stops watching that file, but I haven't yet looked into this scenario where the file is overwritten.\n. The events from the underlying system are largely unmodified, resulting in differences from one platform to the next.\n\nI'm not sure what the best solution is right now. I don't know if it will always be possible to present the same result across 4-5 platforms.\n. One solution would be not support watching individual files at all. I think that might be the approach that https://godoc.org/github.com/rjeczalik/notify takes. FSEvents on OS X also seems geared towards watching directories instead of files. \n\nOf course, if a directory is (re)moved, you may still have to watch one level up to see what happened.\n. Maybe there should be a flag indicating if the event is a dir or file event?\n. That would be nice. The question is whether we can add that across each platform without introducing additional overhead (Lstat when not needed).\n. ref #83 \n. Merged. Thanks\n. Moving the String() method does sound like a good idea.Thanks\n. Windows is already supported. See the README.\n. There can be (and sometimes are) multiple Ops in an event. That's why it is a bitmask.\n. @techjanitor for your info, #165 has been merged, resolving the issue you set out to with this pull request.\n. If you can share some sample code to reproduce the issue, that would be helpful..\n. Revert to polling #9 or report an error like #45.\n. @omeid Not as of yet. See https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/milestones\n. Hi David,\nThanks for the pull request. Is this meant to address #22?\n\nThe thing that I'm not sure about is operating systems other than Linux. With this change, there is a Closed event that doesn't mean anything outside of Linux. Hm.\n. I hope you don't mind working off a fork until we come up with a better solution.\n. Quite odd having different behaviour between different Linux versions. Different versions of the kernel, perhaps? Or maybe different versions of vim?\n\nCan you reproduce the issue using`touch` from the command line instead of an editor? See #17.\n. If you are watching an individual file and it moves, it may no longer be being watched. Better to watch the directory the file is in.\n\nIf you believe there is a bug, can you please provide more details, such as operating system you are using and a code snippet to reproduce the issue? Thanks.\n\n(sorry for the late reply)\n. @kkirsche sorry, I'm not sure I follow what's happening in your example.\n\nmoving/renaming doesn't work so well with the underlying OS notification systems #26\n\nbtw, which operating system are you testing on?\n. @kkirsche Glad you got it working. Do you have any suggestions for improving the example code or documentation?\n. This is on Linux? Do you think you could provide a code snippet that reproduces the issue? Thanks.\n. I'm not sure if I understand. Op is a bit field with only 5 bits. It should not overflow even an 8-bit int, and it is a 32-bit int.\n. Oh. I've never heard of it.\n. I'm not entirely sure. A git blame points back to this issue in howeyc/fsnotify https://github.com/howeyc/fsnotify/issues/36.\n\nI don't like the idea of ignoring events either.\n. Thanks Evan. \n\nIt looks like there is an unrelated problem in CircleCI and Travis. I'll look into it.\n. Merged to master. Thanks.\n. Yup. v1.2.1 released with this change.\n\nhttps://gopkg.in/fsnotify.v1\n. yikes. What OS did you encounter this on?\n\nIf possible, can you provide a small code sample that reproduces the issue?\n. If it occurs consistently, you could try changing that lock in your local copy of fsnotify to see if it solves the issue.\n. Hi Uwe. Any updates on this? I haven't ran into the issue yet myself.\n. That might do the trick, but without being able to reproduce the issue, I don't want to just change code and hope it works. Much better if @djui tries it and proves that it fixes his issue.\n. @ppknap I like your plan of using a temporary map. Would you be willing to write up a pull request along with a test case?\n\nUPDATE: oh, you did add a test case #102. Thanks! For some reason it's not failing on travis-ci running on OS X which does use kqueue.\n. Good idea. Thanks.\n. @djui The race detector isn't finding any races for me on OS X 10.11.2 with Go 1.5.2 or tip, but I've added `--race` to Travis CI (which includes OS X).\n\nOn the other hand, there are two races happening on Linux. Looking into those in #105. \n. Oh. It showed up now, thanks to @ppknap's TestRemoveWithClose. Not sure why it didn't show up immediately after I merged that in, but oh well. Looking into it.\n. Please review #105 and when all is good I'll do a new release.\n. Thanks.\n\nGo itself only [requires Linux 2.6.23 or later with glib](https://golang.org/doc/install), so I should add a note to the README about 2.6.27.\n. I'm not sure what the stats are. That's a good idea to look into it. Preferably we won't need a kludge to support the older kernels, but mentioning it in the README and release notes is important.\n. No, sorry for the delay. \n\nI'll merge some things and do a release later today.\n. Merged. Thanks Riku.\n\nI'l do a new point release after looking at a few other pull requests.\n. Thanks for the PR. \n\nRegarding the Linux test failure, I've triggered a rebuild, so we'll see if Travis is just being flaky.\n. Merged as https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/commit/2cdd39bd6129c6a49c74fb07fb9d77ba1271c572 and released as 1.2.5. Thanks!\n. I  should add `script: go test -v --race ./...` to use the race detector on Travis.\n. I'm closing this as it's included in #105, which is on the race branch. Thanks.\n. The current solution is to filter out the events you get back. Indicating which events to watch is an optimization, though not all platforms will be able to filter the same way. Please take a look at #7.\n\nI'm closing this is a duplicate. If you want to take a stab at it, I'd be happy to review a pull request. Feel free to discuss further at #7.\n. API changes are using Events() and Errors() instead of fields in the platform-dependent struct and returning a FileWatcher interface instead of a *Watcher struct.\n\nMaybe there is another way to do this that makes the drivers/bindings satisfy an interface, but keeps the existing API as is.\n. I'm not sure if I want to see this much API churn in fsnotify itself. At least in the near-term.\n\nRather, I'd just like to see the fsnotify split into some independent packages (#75) for each OS while keeping the current API more or less the same. Having those low-level packages in place should enable more experimentation at the higher levels in alternatives to fsnotify.\n. Personally, I'd like to keep the fsnotify API as simple as possible, without requiring the user to know which driver to use. This could be an internal implementation detail at all.\r\n\r\nFor those that need more control, the individual OS-specific packages could be used directly.. I've rebased in squashed commits to (somewhat) avoid test failures in the history.\n. Thanks for your review.\n. Hi @tiwaana. Just prepare a Dockerfile in a pull request that can be used to locally test Linux, with some instructions to do so. The tests (`go test`) should pass in the container.\n. Part of this move would be to adopt @rjeczalik's notify library as an alternative available from the same organization. Any low-level \"drivers\" for specific platforms would also exist under the new organization.\n. I'm planning to rename the organization as well, since the \"go-\" prefix is a gopkg.in thing.\n. I'm preparing to rename the organization now.\n. The move to https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify is done, though I have to ensure CI is still working and update the website.\n\nGitHub automatically redirects https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify to https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify.\n\nI tested `go get gopkg.in/fsnotify.v1` and it still works, which I did not expect. If we run into any problems, or if we ever need to include github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify in an internal import path, I can put a repository up at github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify with a \"maintenance has moved\" message in the README.\n. All done.\n. It could be useful. Though for any API addition or change, I'd like to hear from multiple people, so I'm going to let this sit for awhile.\n\nOne consideration is that sometimes the underlying OS does buffering of it's own. FSEvents on Mac in particular can even persist events to disk across reboots. I'm not sure how accurate the length returned would be in such situations, but it's worth investigating.\n. Thanks for the report. That is odd. It would probably be worth digging deeper to see if inotify is the cause or if fsnotify is mangling the event somehow.\n\nAdding some logging in readEvents could help. https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/blob/master/inotify.go#L171\n. Thanks @bep\n. Thanks for researching all this Anthony. So in summary:\n- EpollPwait needs to be added to x/sys by us or someone. https://github.com/golang/go/issues/10235\n- We need to switch to x/sys for fsnotify (on Linux at least) and mention it in the README and release notes.\n- We should look into ARM based continuous integration (the Go team is using some custom stuff running on https://www.scaleway.com/)\n\nWe can switch to InotifyInit1 at anytime, which I believe is available in the standard library sys package. It may require a slightly newer Linux kernel, but that's fine so long as the README indicates the requirements. Feel free to prepare a pull request for that if you like.\n. Ok.\n. Thanks Anthony. If you could do some testing with #135, it would be much appreciated.\n. Thanks @purpleidea. I left some comments.\n. Thanks James. As to your question, if someone does a `go get github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify` the code should compile and build without needing to go generate anything. \n\nThis applies even more so to a library. For example, if you `go get github.com/spf13/hugo` which depends on fsnotify, it would fail to build until you run go generate on the fsnotify dependency. If multiple libraries did that it would be a total nightmare for users.\n\nIt's also what the Go team recommends, and I trust their recommendations, because they have a lot more experience than me. https://blog.golang.org/generate\n. Is that test failure on Windows?\n\nfsnotify is a bit unusual in that it has a lot of platform-specific code. hopefully we can get this to work without multiple op_stringers for different platforms.\n\nThe Windows code is a real mess IMO #6. Sorry.\n. I'm too sleepy to be coding on this right now (bugs are inevitable), but I'll try to take a look in the next few days. Thanks for the contrib.\n. pong :)\n\nsorry.\n. This PR still needs a little more work before it's merged. I can do the work, but I haven't had a chance to yet.\n. see the comments i made during code review.\n. ok.\n. That would be great.\n\nThe only thing is, how does someone using Linux choose between them? We may need something along the lines of #104 first.\n. @purpleidea I think it would be best to build fanotify Go wrapper out as a separate repo and then look at integrating after that.. @amir73il is working on a \"super block watch\" for Linux, providing \"the ability to set a single (fanotify) watch on a root directory and get notified on all the legacy inotify events without the need to recursively add watches on all directories.\" https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/12/20/312\r\n\r\nThis could avoid the need for a user-space recursive watcher (#16) on modern Linux kernels.\r\n. Thanks Amir. \r\n\r\nPerhaps another option to make the patched kernel available would be to maintain a [Vagrant box](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/boxes/search) built with [Packer](https://www.packer.io/). That way we could test fanotify super block using a VirtualBox VM from any operating system.. I wonder if this is similar to the issues and fixes for kqueue on BSD (#105), except for inotify.\n. Which platform are you running into this issue on?\n. Thanks. \n\nWere the events happening previously? Do you have any idea of what may have changed in wellington, or if it was an update to fsnotify? \n. Thanks for reporting this. I haven't noticed gopkg.in being unreliable, but it's another reason to move away from it. See #108.\n. https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify is the new home for fsnotify.\n. CLA hub has new maintainers if we want a CLA.\n. maybe keep the 3 clause BSD license but change the wording? e.g. https://github.com/gocql/gocql/commit/bfab7467126ac5a9e7360141737da30214f026c7\n. The CLA and license are needed if Google is to ever use this code in core or x/tools. \n\nWe need a better solution for enforcing the Google CLA.\n\nIt would make me feel less awkward if there was an active co-maintainer on the project who is employed by Google.\n. Regarding the CLA, perhaps Google has some code to integrate with GitHub Status in a similar fashion to GitHub themselves.\n\n![b53610ca-946c-11e6-8488-ff95f51aba59](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4566/19661443/fbc5da3c-99f0-11e6-9671-77ec70217ee4.png)\n. closing in favour of #193. Thanks!\n. Finally got my Windows VM working again. Merged. Thanks.\n. This may be related to the way editors save files. See #17 \n\nCan you try modifying the file at the command line? \nhttp://superuser.com/questions/10426/windows-equivalent-of-the-linux-command-touch/764716\n. Thanks for checking. \n\nSome people batch up or throttle events if they occur multiple times. Eg. here is the code for Hugo:\nhttps://github.com/spf13/hugo/blob/master/watcher/batcher.go\n\nThere was a fix for similar issues in OS X with #111, but I'm not sure if the same solution would work on Windows. \n. Thanks for investigating this @tsuna. \n\nHave you looked at related open issues already? Possibly #115.\n. What do you think of splitting out inotify as a dependency and adding some inotify-specific stress tests there? #173.\n\nAlso, there are some open pull requests in need of review/testing that may help, such as #149.\n. I'll re-run Travis to see if it's being flaky.\n. Sorry, still haven't reviewed and tested it yet.\n. I'm not that familiar with `syscall.Pipe`. Hoping someone will review this.\n. Thanks for your patience @fjl.\n\nThere is currently a data race issue with kqueue on master, which should be remedied first.\nhttps://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify/pull/162#issuecomment-251575890\n\nAs to this PR, we need some familiar with epoll to do the code review.\n. sounds good. feel free to merge this.\n. @omeid I agree. We should make that clear in the CONTRIBUTING document and also look into GitHub's branch protection for master.\n. I enabled a few things:\n- The master branch is protected from force pushes. \n- Tests must pass before a branch can be merged to master.\n- Branches must be up-to-date with master before merging.\n\nIf the tests past on a branch and it is up-to-date with master, it should still be possible to push its contents to master directly. It may or may not work with the \"hub apply mail\" workflow I've been using.\n\nThough I'd prefer squash merging, merge commits are also enabled for now.\n. This whole idea could be impacted by what we end up doing for #136.\n. Thanks.\n. merged. thanks\n. Yes, this hasn't changed. kqueue does need to keep a file open for every file it watches, plus the directories themselves. On BSD the limits are higher so it's less of an issue than on OS X.\n\nThere is a way to increase the limit. The FAQ should probably be updated with the commands to do it. https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify/wiki/FAQ\n\nYou can also ensure that you're not watching files that don't need to be watched, such as hidden .git folders.\n. NOTE: The FAQ is now part of the README to increase visibility (#186): https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify#faq. Hi Mart\u00edn. Thanks for reporting the issues. Unfortunately I don't have access to Linux on these architectures to test with nor do we have CI/builders on those architectures to catch the issues. \n\nThe poller code that is failing was submitted by @PieterD in #66 and switched to `epoll_create1` by @suihkulokki in #100 in an effort to make it work on arm64. Maybe they will have some insight into why it's failing.\n. thanks Riku\n\nas to the errors on PowerPC, I really have no idea :cry:\n. Thanks @laboger. Are you planning to do a CL for syscall?\n\nShould fsnotify switch from using standard libraries syscall to https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/sys?\n. Fixing the standard libraries syscall would be preferable. I just thought it was frozen since Go 1.3, but maybe bugfixes are still okay. Thanks.\n. Is it timing out? Many of the tests only wait so long for the notifications to occur.\n. @TheTincho Can you test arm64 with v1.3.0. It should be working now that @suihkulokki's patch is in: https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/21971/\n. I should've looked more closely at @laboger's work before. Apologies.\n\nLooking through https://github.com/golang/go/issues/15135, Lynn updated the `syscall` package in the standard library. That fix was made to Go 1.7.\n\nhttps://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/22207/\n\nBut the Go team allowed the patch to be rolled back to Go 1.6.2 which is due out today: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/15288\n\nRiku took a different approach, revising [golang.org/x/sys/unix](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/sys/unix) and switching fsnotify to use it.\n\nAt this point it probably makes the most sense to apply @laboger's change to x/sys/unix as well. That way fsnotify won't require Go 1.6.2 for ppc.\n\nI don't know if @suihkulokki's change could have been made to syscall instead, but at this point it's probably too late to make the change there, and still get it in to Go 1.6.2.\n. We really need to get builders #136 setup for these environments. That way we can ensure they are continuing to work with other changes, and we could also see any test failures that occur.\n. @laboger Are you still seeing test failures sometimes? If you are running with the verbose (`-v`) option it can be difficult to see the failure amidst all the other logs.\n. @laboger Apologies. I merged that change before looking at the work you had done on the syscall library. Would you be willing to submit your syscall changes and any other necessary changes as a CL on golang.org/x/sys/unix? That will enable powerpc to work even on Go 1.5 rather than requiring 1.6.2.\n\nI'm looking into getting Go's builder machines in place for fsnotify. That way we can ensure it is tested across linux/arm64 and ppc to avoid such issues in the future.\n. Thanks Lynn.\n. @laboger syscall was supposedly frozen when x/sys was extracted. \n. @laboger Here is the relevant proposal and mailing list thread\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1QXzI9I1pOfZPujQzxhyRy6EeHYTQitKKjHfpq0zpxZs/edit\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-dev/gyOoSwxBkCA\n\n> We therefore propose to freeze the package as of Go 1.3\n. This whole thing has brought to light something I didn't realize. There are quite a lot of changes to the \"frozen\" `syscall` package since September 2014 (when Go 1.4 was released and syscall was \"frozen\"). Perhaps it just was the pragmatic thing to do to keep things working, but it certainly isn't frozen.\n\nThe copy to `x/sys` happened in August 2014 and `x/sys` has seen a lot of changes too. But it does make me wonder if there aren't fixes and improvements in `syscall` that haven't made it so `x/sys`.\n\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/commits/master/src/syscall\n. So I've posted a message to golang-dev regarding this whole confusing situation with syscall vs. x/sys: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-dev/cEASnHIXmLI\n\nI still think the switch to `x/sys` is a good move simply to support previous versions of Go, but I'm somewhat inclined to do a diff of the two libraries to see if we're missing any syscall patches.\n. There is an open CL for ppc from @clnperez.\n\nhttps://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/22605/\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/15393\n\nI'm not sure about s390x.\n. The change list (CL) has been submitted. Thanks Christy.\n\n```\ngo get -u golang.org/x/sys/unix\n```\n\nI don't think any changes are need to fsnotify itself for this update.\n\n@TheTincho Can you please test it out.\n. see #22. Thanks. It would've been a bit easier to use an alias for the import `import syscall \"golang.org/x/sys/unix\"` but this is fine.\n\nIt looks like the CI failure on darwin as something flaky.\n\nAdding a dependency could break people's builds, so we'll need to release this carefully.\n. @anthonyfok offered to do some additional testing in #112.\n\nI think we should release this as v1.3.0 by the end of April. I'm thinking of pre-announcing the release to golang-nuts, since it does require a new dependency.\n. Announced: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-nuts/3JLKL785bTY/EacbfZVeAAAJ\n\nI also left a note in the #fsnotify channel on Slack.\n. merged. thanks\n. As far as local testing, I currently use https://github.com/nathany/vagrant-gopher for BSD and Linux, which I run on a Mac along with a Windows 10 VM in VMware Fusion. Solaris could probably be added, but that still only covers x86.\n\nI recall some plans to make it possible to utilize the builders from a local computer while debugging issues, but I don't know where that is currently at.\n. From @bradfitz:\n\n> Currently our builders can only run stuff in golang.org/x\\* and hosted on Gerrit.\n> That's not fundamental, but it's just how things are currently implemented.\n\nI will compose a message to golang-dev tonight after work to see where the community wants to take this.\n. There is also a matter of where the issue tracking is done in the future. In a subrepo or the Go language repo. The change from pull requests to CLs.\n\nI'm fairly happy with GitHub's recent improvements to pull requests and my own workflows using hub, so it's really just the builders that we need to get going on.\n. Posted to golang-dev to include other Go contributors in the discussion. https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-dev/SVrNHQU1oEM\n. Opened an issue over in the Go repository. https://github.com/golang/go/issues/17312\n. Thanks for the report. ppc wasn't resolved in v1.3.0, see issue #130 for more.\n. Please try updating x/sys/unix.\n. From Slack, @flexd reports the same issue with v1.2.11, so this isn't a regression with the new syscall dependency in 1.3.\n. @ppknap Good call.\n\n@Depado does your code do a similar thing or do you have a different cause?\n\nMaybe we can improve the documentation or FAQ to indicate that watcher.Close() should only be called when you're done watching, not in a defer in a function call.\n. Closing this. If you have any suggestions for making this more clear in the examples or documentation, feel free to reopen it or open a new issue.\n. closed in favour of #173\n. @pattyshack provided a patch which has been merged to master. \n\nplease (re)open the issue if you see any further flakiness.\n. Thanks for the report. Which operating system is this on?\n. Thanks @suihkulokki. So `sed` exhibits the same issues as text editors #17.\n. Thanks for providing a failing test. I won't be merging it until we have a fix, nor will I be merging in with an additional testing dependency (as good as testify may be).\n. Thanks. Would you mind also taking a peek at #124?\n. @jeffwilliams You could checkout an older version of fsnotify and vendor that code. The change to EpollCreate1 was made in v1.2.5. See [releases](https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify/releases).\n\nI'm not sure if there is a good way to fallback to the old EpollCreate, so I'm going to go ahead and close this. \n. I've personally not test with 10k+ files. We should try to establish if the underlying inotify code handles that many files properly (for a given kernel). Assuming it does, then we will at least know it's an issue in fsnotify.\n. > \"IN_Q_OVERFLOW is emitted when the appropriate queue is full and can't take more events. If this event occurs frequently you should read events faster and eventually increase the limit for queues. This limit can be read and changed by reading/changing the appropriate procfs file (/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_queued_events).\" - http://inotify.aiken.cz/?section=inotify&page=faq\n\nWould it be possible to test this by temporarily modifying `/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_queued_events` to a small value? (An inotify-specific tast with the linux build tag)\n\nIf an integration test isn't possible (or reliable), then **how should this be manually tested?**\n. Ok.\n\nWe have a new pull request template: https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md\n\nI'd like to ensure all these questions are answered for any pull request.\n\nWhat does this pull request do?\n\n> Upon receiving an event with IN_Q_OVERFLOW set in the mask, generate an\n> error on the Errors chan, so that the application can take appropriate\n> action.\n\nWhere should the reviewer start?\n\nHow should this be manually tested?\n. @zeldovich Have you signed the Google CLA? We need contributors to sign the CLA so that fsnotify can be used in Go tools in the future.\n\nhttps://cla.developers.google.com/about\n. Thanks @bep. It seems all the current pull requests are failing in odd ways. We should really look into fixing or removing faulty tests.\n. This may be related to #142.\n\n> panic: Fail in goroutine after TestInotifyStress has completed\n. Yes, we should be using `filepath.Join`.\n\nFor the moment, does it work to just watch `\"c:\"`?\n. Hi. File notifications have a tendency of not working across shares (NFS, Vagrant mounts), but it is curious that changing a file in virtualbox worked in the container. I haven't tested this particular case myself.\n\nAs far as the events passed, how are you changing the file? That may be related to how a text editor makes the change. See #17.\n\nWhat are you hoping to accomplish? If you need to detect changes to files on the Windows host, as seems to be the case, you will most likely need to watch the files in Windows and then trigger whatever action you need.\n\nIf instead you are looking to watch files inside the vagrant box, it's best to use a directory that isn't shared from the Windows host, as that usually won't work (as you've seen).\n. Thanks for investigating this further. Unfortunately the underlying file notification systems have some limitations and differences, which make it difficult to get the consistent behaviour we would all like to have. If we can improve something though, we'll certainly try.\n. looks good. thanks\n. Something is flaky with Mac tests, but the Windows tests on Appveyor passed.\n\nNotice that it's logging events with `\\\\` double slashes everywhere though. Hm.\n. Yah, don't worry about the the Mac tests. That's a separate issue.\n\nYou can see the output in Appveyor (Windows CI) by clicking the link: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/NathanYoungman/fsnotify/build/1.0.209\n\nIt may just be a %q vs. %s thing. I'll double check before merging/releasing this.\n. Merged. I still have to tag a release and update the changelog, etc.\n\nThanks Bruno\n. Not currently. Some platforms include a flag for that but not all. Currently fsnotify is doing the lowest common denominator thing and not reporting it, as opposed to doing an os.Stat to always provide that information.\n. > IN_CLOEXEC\n> Set the close-on-exec (FD_CLOEXEC) flag on the new file descriptor. See the description of the O_CLOEXEC flag...\n> \n> O_CLOEXEC (Since Linux 2.6.23)\n> Enable the close-on-exec flag for the new file descriptor. Specifying this flag permits a program to avoid additional fcntl(2) F_SETFD operations to set the FD_CLOEXEC flag. Additionally, use of this flag is essential in some multithreaded programs since using a separate fcntl(2) F_SETFD operation to set the FD_CLOEXEC flag does not suffice to avoid race conditions where one thread opens a file descriptor at the same time as another thread does a fork(2) plus execve(2).\n\nfsnotify currently uses InotifyInit (not InotifyInit1).\n\n> inotify_init() first appeared in Linux 2.6.13; library support was added to glibc in version 2.4.\n> inotify_init1() was added in Linux 2.6.27; library support was added to glibc in version 2.9.\n\nThis is fine (IMO).\n\nWhat about support on ARM and PPC64? /cc @suihkulokki @TheTincho @clnperez @laboger @tophj-ibm?\n. @TheTincho That would be very helpful. Thanks. `inotify_init1` and the flags it takes. The code change is in #178.\n\nI wonder if we should be using `IN_NONBLOCK` as well? (#5) https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify/blob/master/inotify_poller.go#L48\n. Is there any reason why someone would want the child process to have the inotify file descriptor carried over? \n\nPresumably a new one would be created in the child process instead if needed.\n. Thanks. Still need to look into these flaky tests.\n. Maybe the terminology is confusing? The path on Linux should be relative to whatever you are monitoring. If the current working directory was `tmp` and you monitored `EFlmKJ8XTYmnxQIucRkY2A/` then you should see `EFlmKJ8XTYmnxQIucRkY2A/qmp.sock` (relative to tmp).\n\nWhether the filename is included or not doesn't make the path absolute rather than relative.\n\nIf you want to strip off qmp.sock for some reason, you can always use `filepath.Dir()` from the standard library.\n. It is relative to the folder being monitored.\n\nIf you monitor `/home/go/src` then the notification paths will include `/home/go/src/...`. If you monitor `src` then the path will only include `src/...`. In order to do the later, your current working directory matters.\n\nNot saying it's the best thing. Maybe the paths returned should always be absolute. It would probably work to just call `filepath.Abs` on the path you want to monitor rather than every path returned for a notification -- though we'd need to verify it across each platform.\n. I opened an issue for this (#160). Thanks for bringing it up.\n. it looks like there is a data race to fix\n. Still seeing data races on Travis. Doh!\n\nSpecifically on macOS. The race on Linux is resolved.\n. data races in all the places\n\nwill come back to that one. \ud83d\udca4 \n. on macOS Sierra 10.12\n\n```\n\u276f go test -race -test.count=10\nPASS\nok      github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify    104.165s\n\nfsnotify git/master  \n\u276f go16 test -race -test.count=10\n```\n\n... the later doesn't seem to be finishing anytime soon\n\n```\n\u276f go16 test -race \n# testmain\nfatal error: unexpected signal during runtime execution\n...\n```\n\nBut then Go 1.6 doesn't work on Sierra anyway.

The only problem with using `.x` is we need to wait for Travis CI to update their aliases, but they are in place now. I will update.\r\n\r\nSee: https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-build/pull/956. fsnotify doesn't currently support a file closed event -- I don't believe every platform that fsnotify supports has such a event.\n. Thanks for the report @jiangytcn.\n\nWe are running the tests with `-race` yet it hasn't caught this issue. From your description, it sounds like it rarely occurs, which is going to make it hard to track down.\n\nPlease let us known what `go version` you are using and if possible, include some sample code for how you are using fsnotify. Thanks.\n. Thanks @oozie and @jiangytcn. Related to #168.\n. @ishustava regarding ginkgo, see https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify/issues/167 for the discussion. thanks.\n. Hi Slawek. I would rather not introduce a testing dependency in fsnotify or other libraries I work on. I believe it's easier for contributors to use the baseline standard library tests that everyone should be familiar with. Personally I'm not a fan of BDD-style DSLs in Go. Nathan.\n. When I first started using fsnotify I had the same question and wrote all the code to remove the watchers only to find that the remove failed because the watch was already gone. I was using kqueue on macOS at the time, so I'm not 100% sure for inotify on Linux.\n. Documenting that it's unnecessary would be good -- though it would be good if it handled removing better as well.\n. Thanks @oozie. Still need to deal with flaky kqueue tests in #162 also -- not sure if that's related.\n\nI've not seen a pointer to a Mutex in common practice, so this is interesting. \n\nDo you think it would be worth restructuring the code further to make it clear what the mutex guards? I really like this idea: https://talks.golang.org/2015/tricks.slide#15\n. Renames and moves is certainly less than ideal in fsnotify -- not only with inotify, but across all operating systems. See also #26.\n. FYI, epoll was added in #66. It certainly complicates the code quite a lot.\n. related #170\n. Should this effort include fanotify on Linux as well? #114. @tiwaana Sounds awesome. Is the next DTC meetup the Feb 16 launch party for Go 1.8?. I merged #175. Want to rebase and give this another go on Travis?\n. Both locally and your remote? :cry: \nSorry, I guess I did ask you to rebase on master. Darn rebase.\n\nA new PR is fine by me though.\n. Thanks.\n\nOut of curiosity, what error occurred when the linter didn't build? I'm a bit surprised over the issue.\n. Oh, I see.\n\n```\n# github.com/golang/lint\n../../golang/lint/lint.go:249: undefined: types.ImportMode\n```\n\nfrom https://travis-ci.org/fsnotify/fsnotify/jobs/165118920\n\nThere is a closed issue with a similar error https://github.com/golang/lint/issues/246\n\nAnd lint doesn't test itself on Go 1.5.4 \n\nhttps://github.com/golang/lint/commit/e39d62944f60e7296290f116b5f99ac3a4d1fce3#diff-354f30a63fb0907d4ad57269548329e3\n. Thanks. Your fix should address 1 or 2 of these issues -- https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Acritical\n. It still seems to be a bit flaky (#142) for me, though the data race (#150) is resolved.\n\n```\nvagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~/src/github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify$ go test ./... -race\n--- FAIL: TestInotifyStress (1.43s)\n    inotify_test.go:263: Creates and removes should not be off by more than one: 2 creates, 1000 removes\nFAIL\nFAIL    github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify    9.945s\nvagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~/src/github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify$ go test ./... -race\nok      github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify    10.738s\nvagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~/src/github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify$ \n```\n.

Thanks, it's working well for me also.\n\nFYI, this stress test was added in #66.\n. Thanks. P.S. I invited you to the repo, but please continue to use branches and pull requests for any code changes.\n. Waiting on feedback/testing for ARM and PPC64 before merging.\n. Can you provide steps to manually test that file descriptors are no longer leaking with this change?\n. @clnperez That's odd. I wonder if the `IN_CLOEXEC` flag isn't getting passed in properly or what could be causing the discrepancy on ppc.\n. I don't know why this wouldn't work. https://github.com/golang/sys/blob/master/unix/zsyscall_linux_ppc64le.go#L629\n\nIN_CLOEXEC is defined with the same value as other platforms.\nhttps://github.com/golang/sys/blob/master/unix/zerrors_linux_ppc64le.go#L510\n\nSo I wonder where the problem is.\n.

Sorry, I can't accept a pull request that isn't cross platform.\n\nbut see #173\n. Thanks for reporting the issue. Would you mind elaborating with specifically what you do with inotify-tools that does work for those not familiar with it?\n. I've setup GitHub teams for each platform. If you have already contributed to fsnotify and would like to be added to a platform-specific team, please let myself or another maintainer know.\n. @zchee Initially I'm thinking we build up repositories for https://github.com/fsnotify/inotify, etc. independent of the fsnotify package. Then start replacing the low-level bits of the fsnotify package with dependencies on those, while maintaining the same cross-platform API.\n\nEventually we can also substitute kqueue for fsevents on darwin.\n\nIf you'd like to help out, take a look at the https://github.com/fsnotify/fsevents project. There is an open issue with some next steps there, and I'm sure there's much more to do.\n. They are quite different. Right now I'm not thinking of changing the API of fsnotify. Just keep it stable for users.\n\nIf we can separate the code into low-level bits and high-level bits, I think it will be easier to maintain, as separate teams of people will be able to focus on each platform, with one team on cross-platform concerns.\n\nNot sure if I'm explaining it well, it might be easier to show than explain.\n\nI've already started with kqueue, where the code from line 463 on is the low level part. https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify/blob/master/kqueue.go#L463. I'm thinking of putting that in a separate repo with a test suite and documentation and making that into it's own library that fsnotify depends on. \n\nStill many details to work out though -- and certainly open to other ideas.\n. I could still really use some help to maintain fsnotify. Code reviews, testing and merging PRs, doing releases.. Clearly I have been doing a poor job of maintaining fsnotify. Issues without answers, pull requests left open for months... progress has stalled not due to lack of contributors, but because I am currently the bottleneck.\r\n\r\nWhen I got involved with Chris Howey's fsnotify, it was to help out with the API. I don't have the experience and knowledge of file systems necessary to vet a pull request like #124, which adds epoll to kqueue. Much less take on a whole new platform like #196. At first I thought I would learn these things, but doing so hasn't been a priority in what spare time I do have.\r\n\r\nI had hoped that having a generous policy (#126) for granting commit access combined with this call for maintainers would see a team of people volunteer to help maintain fsnotify. I had high hopes for splitting responsibility by operating system to make maintenance more palatable. But that hasn't happened... and I don't know what needs to be done for that to happen.\r\n\r\nAt this point, I am tired of feeling guilty for not being more involved in the project. I'm also tired of worrying that merging a pull request will break an upstream like Docker or a platform that isn't under CI (#136).\r\n\r\nI haven't been very involved lately, so it's time to make it official. I'm stepping away from the fsnotify project. It's up to you now.\r\n\r\nIf you need something from me during the transition, reach out to me here or on #fsnotify on [Slack](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/). Good luck.\r\n. Relevant: https://github.com/blog/2392-introducing-code-owners. thanks @vahe. \n\nMaybe the FAQ and other documentation would be more visible if it were moved from the GitHub Wiki to the website? What do you two think?\n\nhttps://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify.org\n. Moving the FAQ to the README sounds good. Let's do it.\n. Hi @Allendar. The example we have is correct and tested by the test suite. I'm not sure what the confusion is here, but I'm closing this issue.\n. updated and merged. thanks. Sorry for the delay. I'll try to carve out some time over the Christmas holiday to work on fsnotify.. @twpayne Thanks and apologies for the delay. @ppknap Thanks also for reviewing.\r\n\r\nOne consideration is the performance of wide vs. narrow mutexes:\r\nhttps://talks.golang.org/2017/state-of-go.slide#25\r\n\r\nBut I think this is a good change, and we can come back to performance considerations later.\r\n\r\nI'll take a closer look and merge + prepare a release in the next few days. Thanks!. @twpayne It's only abandonware if nobody steps in to replace me.\r\n\r\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/Ix4sg_gDLNE\r\nsee #183. @twpayne No worries. \r\n\r\nYou are right, for a Linux-only change, CI is enough and hitting merge is fine. Thanks @ppknap for reviewing and merging.\r\n\r\n@twpayne Did you happen to sign the Google CLA at some point? That process still needs to be automated. #193.\r\n\r\nThere are a few more steps to do a release which should probably be documented somewhere. Updating the AUTHORS file, CHANGELOG, and Releases after tagging a version. Creating an issue around that: #201.. Thanks for reporting the issue.\r\n\r\nI've not tested fsnotify with gccgo yet, nor do we have it set up in CI. That would be a good idea.. related: #22, #131 . I think this needs more discussion before opening any pull requests, as it likely involves an addition or change to the API, and fsnotify is a cross-platform API.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion of exposing a file-system specific mask might not be such a bad idea. See [FileInfo](https://golang.org/pkg/os/#FileInfo) as an example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSys() interface{}   // underlying data source (can return nil)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso see #173 regarding the spinning out of a stand-alone package specifically for Linux.\r\n. @radu-munteanu I'm hoping a few people step up to build and maintain the inotify spin-off. Then there is still some amount of work to integrate that back into fsnotify with a cross-platform API.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if > 32 or > 64 ops would really be necessary, but it is certainly worth considering alternative approaches to the API for the spin-off. \r\n\r\nHoping to keep the cross-platform fsnotify API itself fairly stable.. kqueue (BSD) also has NOTE_CLOSE_WRITE and NOTE_CLOSE.. Thanks @willnorris.\r\n\r\nThe licensing and CLA has felt awkward to me for a long time (#119). Let me confirm if the Go team still has any plans to use fsnotify in core. I'll post to the golang-dev mailing list and drop a link here.\r\n\r\nWhat would need to change for Google to be the project maintainer? If there were some Google employees maintaining fsnotify, would that be sufficient? I'm happy to pass over the reigns to make it work.. Using fsnotify in core, license and CLA \r\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-dev/UwNizs08YD0. @willnorris I would really like to sort out the licensing issue. Thanks.\r\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-dev/UwNizs08YD0. @bradfitz suggests doing something similar to Camlistore. From https://github.com/camlistore/go4/#details:\r\n\r\n> CLA compliant contributors must agree to the Google CLA (the same as Go itself). This ensures we can move things into Go as necessary in the future. It also makes lawyers at various companies happy. The CLA is not a copyright assignment; you retain the copyright on your work. The CLA just says that your work is open source and you have permission to open source it. See https://golang.org/doc/contribute.html#tmp_6\r\n\r\nHere are the instructions from @willnorris. I suspect we will want the CLA checking for the whole organization, including fsevents or any new repos created. The fsnotify.org website doesn't really need it, but why not.\r\n\r\n>Here's the instructions to enable CLA checking for fsnotify.  You can do it either at the organization level, in which case it will apply to all repos in the org, or just to the individual repos you want it activated for.  The same webhook secret will work in either case.\r\n\r\n>1. Give googlebot write access to the repos.  Adding as an outside collaborator is fine, or you can add the account to the org if you don't want to setup each repo individually.  Up to you.  Write access is needed in order to set commit statuses and issue labels.\r\n\r\n>2. If you want googlebot to set issue labels, go ahead and create the labels \"cla: yes\" and \"cla: no\".  If you don't care about the labels, and will just check for the commit status, then just don't create them and googlebot won't try to add them.\r\n\r\n>3. Add a new webhook to the org or repo:\r\n\r\n>Payload URL: https://cla.developers.google.com/api/github/webhook\r\n>Content type: application/json\r\n>Secret: [elided, ask]\r\n>Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?\r\n>Select \"Let me select individual events\" and then select only \"Issue comment\" and \"Pull Request\".\r\n>Active: this should be checked\r\n\r\n>That should be it.\r\n\r\n>Most of the time it should go pretty smoothly.  The one edge case that we don't handle well is when someone is submitting a PR containing commits that they did not author themselves.  In that case, the comment from googlebot should hopefully explain the situation pretty well.  It's a case where we rely on a human being (you) to do a little bit of legwork and go ahead and merge the commit, even though the official status from googlebot says that things aren't okay.  I've got a feature request outstanding to try and handle this case better.\r\n. @4ad @amitkris Please review.. @gfrey We don't currently have a good way to test Solaris, either with a CI service or locally from a different OS (I use [Vagrant Gopher](https://github.com/nathany/vagrant-gopher) for Linux/BSD).

This would cause a tremendous amount of problems. With my next pull, I've got w.Close waiting until the goroutine is done. That will fix this.\n. If Close just removes all watches but the goroutine blocks on something, the goroutines will start heaping up as you keep adding more goroutines, all blocking, all keeping open files.\n\nThey don't even have to block; if you create the next goroutine without waiting for the last one to finish, you could create a thousand before the first goroutine has a chance to clean up.\n. Confirmed that https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/pull/66 fixes this for inotify. For OS X, I suggest making sure Close waits until the goroutine is stopped before returning.\n. Dang, I was going to check my version, but I'm using golang.org/x/exp/fsnotify, which is not this repository. Sorry for the noise.\n. I will try to do both tonight. If I manage to reproduce it with golang.org/x/exp/fsnotify (it looks very timing-sensitive) I'll try to do the same with this one.\n\nMore info to follow, but it may have to wait for a bit because work. I'm on Linux/x64.\n. The problem appears in both fsnotify packages. I'm afraid it might be in syscall, specifically InotifyInit. I hope not, because that would be bad news.\n\nI could reproduce the problem with this:\n\n```\npackage main\n\nimport (\n  \"time\"\n  \"fmt\"\n  \"github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify\"\n  \"os\"\n  \"syscall\"\n)\n\nfunc Panic(err error) {\n  if err != nil {\n    panic(err)\n  }\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n  go sig()\n  go notify()\n  <-time.After(5 * time.Second)\n}\n\nfunc notify() *fsnotify.Watcher {\n  w, err := fsnotify.NewWatcher()\n  Panic(err)\n  defer w.Close()\n  err = w.Add(\".\")\n  Panic(err)\n  defer w.Remove(\".\")\n  for {\n    select {\n    case err := <-w.Errors:\n      Panic(fmt.Errorf(\"fsnotify error from Error channel: %#v\", err))\n    case <-w.Events:\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nfunc sig() {\n  p, err := os.FindProcess(os.Getpid())\n  Panic(err)\n  for {\n    p.Signal(syscall.SIGUSR1)\n  }\n}\n\n```\n. See also https://github.com/golang/go/issues/9782\n. Of course it could be as simple as ignoring EINTR, which might be where this is going. I just worry the call is secretly blocking.\n. I'll take a look at this tonight and keep you posted.\n. Okay, so it uses syscall.Read, and it blocks. So it will need at least a runtime.LockOSThread in the readEvents goroutine, I think.\n\nSecond, it can get interrupted by signals, so it needs a little help ignoring EINTR.\n. Ian cleared it up for me, no need for runtime.LockOSThread. I'll fix up the EINTR thing in the near future. Would you like me to send a CL to fix exp/fsnotify as well, or do you want to remove it? I'm thinking getting rid of it should be done by you.\n. Pull requested: https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/pull/62\n\nI think you'll like the Go issue that this spawned: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/9785\n\nThat issue also explains why EINTR was happening.\n. Nice. I sent you an email regarding some other work on inotify.\n. Never mind, I got carried away and already made a pull request.\n. I've checked. I did the same as you (checked /proc/x/fd), disabled tests until i found the one that did it. Unsurprisingly, it was a blocking goroutine.\n\nIt still happened due to corner case that I hadn't covered yet; in close, when there were watches to remove but they all gave errors, the 'wakeup' wasn't done. Now it is. And thus it is fixed.\n. Did that (and A+C) years ago. It's fine.\n. There's still some uncertainty when closing which I'm fixing now.\n. Nice. I'm using epoll to get rid of the last bit of uncertainty.\n. Yeah, it's a lot of busywork for a small imperfection, but it's got to be done. You could accept the pull as is, and I'll shoot the epoll thing as a seperate pull request. That might ease the review.\n. Man, it SUCKS that syscall.Read doesn't unblock with you close the file descriptor. Even epoll doesn't respond when you do that.\n. Please. It would be nice to seperate this mess and the next mess, instead of creating one giant ubermess :P\n. HOLY CRAP I just figured it out. There's a truly awesome race condition that happens :D\n\nI was wondering how it could be possible that sometimes, test n was making test n+1 fail with \"bad file descriptor\" or with the wrong number of events.\n\nWhat happens is that when you've got a goroutine waiting for events, it's possible to close it and create a new one, before other goroutines have a chance to respond. But since the previous descriptor was closed, the new inotify file descriptor will have the same number as the previous one, which will then get closed once the previous test's goroutines wake up and close their stuff.\n\nSo, yeah. From now on, Close waits for the readEvents goroutine to finish.\n. So if, during the execution of Add, some other goroutine closes the watcher and something else opens a file descriptor, it'll get messed up.\n\nThis changes a lot. Add and Remove will have to be properly synced with readEvents. Yeah, I don't think think you'll like the next pull request.\n. I wonder if -race could be adapted to catch this.\n. I was under the impression that https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/issues/5 was about goroutines blocking forever.\n\nPerhaps I'm mistaken.\n. readEvents still has a blocking read on the file descriptor, but that's fine. So does kqueue and the Windows thing.\n\nIt should get cleaned up pretty much always, but not ABSOLUTELY always. That's the next one. So yeah, I suppose #5 might not be fixed until I push the epoll stuff.\n. You can look at the internal field from Test.\n. That would happen when the goroutine dies. Sounds bad.\n. Thinking about it now, you're only getting stuff from Errors, so Events is still open.\n\nI'd take a look at the code, but I won't see a computer until tonight.\n. Oh. I got it. It's in your code. You create the watcher, defer close, and wait for stuff in a goroutine... But then you return from the function that has the defer close.\n\nA question might be, is the events channel being properly closed by the goroutine?\n. Hah! Sweet. I was in the train on my phone, so I had a few minutes.\n\nBy the wat, watcher.isClosed is racey in almost every case.\n. Ah that's how the events chan wasn't reporting. Duh. Thanks :D\n. Happens to everyone. Good luck :)\n. Er, am I blind? I shouldn't open issues from my phone. Disregard this until i get home to look again lol\n. I know I saw something when I was on my phone, but since I had to switch to the comment thing I lost it. So keep this open for a bit please, I'll look at it this weekend.\n. Yeah, it would :)\n\nhttps://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/issues/10\n. Sure thing, I'll take a look at this tonight or tomorrow. Thanks.\n. Don't have much time (I'm on holiday!) but I've got a few minutes.\n. Sorry, I don't have a ton of time :(\n\nI'm a bit confused about what the patch is meant to fix. Could you elaborate?\n. Thanks. There was some stuff in there I thought might save some time looking stuff up in the future :)\n. LGTM. I don't have a linux machine handy so I can't play around with it, but it looks good.\n. I agree. It is known. I actually think a radically different api is required. Unifying all the different systems into a single common denominator api is... Well, it's hard.\n\nUnfortunately, there's just the two of us at the moment, and we're pretty busy ourselves. Sorry. When I get back from holiday next week I plan to pick it back up. Until then, feel free to contribute.\n. I've put up a document on the redesign issue. Feel free to comment.\nhttps://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/issues/1\n.

Pull requested: https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/pull/62\n\nI think you'll like the Go issue that this spawned: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/9785\n\nThat issue also explains why EINTR was happening.\n. Nice. I sent you an email regarding some other work on inotify.\n. Never mind, I got carried away and already made a pull request.\n. I've checked. I did the same as you (checked /proc/x/fd), disabled tests until i found the one that did it. Unsurprisingly, it was a blocking goroutine.\n\nIt still happened due to corner case that I hadn't covered yet; in close, when there were watches to remove but they all gave errors, the 'wakeup' wasn't done. Now it is. And thus it is fixed.\n. Did that (and A+C) years ago. It's fine.\n. There's still some uncertainty when closing which I'm fixing now.\n. Nice. I'm using epoll to get rid of the last bit of uncertainty.\n. Yeah, it's a lot of busywork for a small imperfection, but it's got to be done. You could accept the pull as is, and I'll shoot the epoll thing as a seperate pull request. That might ease the review.\n. Man, it SUCKS that syscall.Read doesn't unblock with you close the file descriptor. Even epoll doesn't respond when you do that.\n. Please. It would be nice to seperate this mess and the next mess, instead of creating one giant ubermess :P\n. HOLY CRAP I just figured it out. There's a truly awesome race condition that happens :D\n\nI was wondering how it could be possible that sometimes, test n was making test n+1 fail with \"bad file descriptor\" or with the wrong number of events.\n\nWhat happens is that when you've got a goroutine waiting for events, it's possible to close it and create a new one, before other goroutines have a chance to respond. But since the previous descriptor was closed, the new inotify file descriptor will have the same number as the previous one, which will then get closed once the previous test's goroutines wake up and close their stuff.\n\nSo, yeah. From now on, Close waits for the readEvents goroutine to finish.\n. So if, during the execution of Add, some other goroutine closes the watcher and something else opens a file descriptor, it'll get messed up.\n\nThis changes a lot. Add and Remove will have to be properly synced with readEvents. Yeah, I don't think think you'll like the next pull request.\n. I wonder if -race could be adapted to catch this.\n. I was under the impression that https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/issues/5 was about goroutines blocking forever.\n\nPerhaps I'm mistaken.\n. readEvents still has a blocking read on the file descriptor, but that's fine. So does kqueue and the Windows thing.\n\nIt should get cleaned up pretty much always, but not ABSOLUTELY always. That's the next one. So yeah, I suppose #5 might not be fixed until I push the epoll stuff.\n. You can look at the internal field from Test.\n. That would happen when the goroutine dies. Sounds bad.\n. Thinking about it now, you're only getting stuff from Errors, so Events is still open.\n\nI'd take a look at the code, but I won't see a computer until tonight.\n. Oh. I got it. It's in your code. You create the watcher, defer close, and wait for stuff in a goroutine... But then you return from the function that has the defer close.\n\nA question might be, is the events channel being properly closed by the goroutine?\n. Hah! Sweet. I was in the train on my phone, so I had a few minutes.\n\nBy the wat, watcher.isClosed is racey in almost every case.\n. Ah that's how the events chan wasn't reporting. Duh. Thanks :D\n. Happens to everyone. Good luck :)\n. Er, am I blind? I shouldn't open issues from my phone. Disregard this until i get home to look again lol\n. I know I saw something when I was on my phone, but since I had to switch to the comment thing I lost it. So keep this open for a bit please, I'll look at it this weekend.\n. Yeah, it would :)\n\nhttps://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/issues/10\n. Sure thing, I'll take a look at this tonight or tomorrow. Thanks.\n. Don't have much time (I'm on holiday!) but I've got a few minutes.\n. Sorry, I don't have a ton of time :(\n\nI'm a bit confused about what the patch is meant to fix. Could you elaborate?\n. Thanks. There was some stuff in there I thought might save some time looking stuff up in the future :)\n. LGTM. I don't have a linux machine handy so I can't play around with it, but it looks good.\n. I agree. It is known. I actually think a radically different api is required. Unifying all the different systems into a single common denominator api is... Well, it's hard.\n\nUnfortunately, there's just the two of us at the moment, and we're pretty busy ourselves. Sorry. When I get back from holiday next week I plan to pick it back up. Until then, feel free to contribute.\n. I've put up a document on the redesign issue. Feel free to comment.\nhttps://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/issues/1\n. I also don't have those architectures, sorry.\n. ",
    "nightlyone": "I like your proposal of doing the Ops filtering on creation of the watcher. \n\nOne usually creates such a watcher with a purpose in mind and the events being delivered are usually suitable for this purpose for the lifetime of the watcher.

    "tsuna": "The current code of `Add()` contains:\n\n``` go\n    const agnosticEvents = unix.IN_MOVED_TO | unix.IN_MOVED_FROM |\n        unix.IN_CREATE | unix.IN_ATTRIB | unix.IN_MODIFY |\n        unix.IN_MOVE_SELF | unix.IN_DELETE | unix.IN_DELETE_SELF\n\n    var flags uint32 = agnosticEvents\n```\n\nSo basically the flags are hard-coded to the ones above.  Would there be any opposition to adding another API, like:\n\n``` go\nfunc (w *Watcher) Add(name string) error {\n    return w.AddWithFlags(name, agnosticEvents)\n}\n\nfunc (w *Watcher) AddWithFlags(name string, flags uint32) error {\n    // mostly the same code as the current Add() but use flags passed in argument\n```\n\nI need to ignore `IN_DELETE_SELF` because it's misleading in my case (and causes correctness issues in my code), I only care about `IN_DELETE`.\n. I hear you, although I personally don't think it's a big problem that the flags differ across the platforms, since this API would just take a `uint32` and what values make sense for this API could be platform specific.  So this would be a more advanced API for those needing the extra control.\n\nNow when I reviewed the open issues I missed #173, that's obviously a more elegant solution, and at this rate between this bug and #97 and #123, it's very hard for me to get correctness out of fsnotify, so I was considering writing my own little inotify wrapper anyway, so I'm glad to hear that this is being considered.\n\nFor now I think I'll just fork the project to quickly fix/hack the bugs that are impacting me.\n. This change fsnotify/fsnotify@e2532248b8b41873668e8e339833f9b4083d4a71 is making some of my unit tests fail non-deterministically.  After adding some tracing to the code, here's what I'm seeing (both on Linux 3.4.43 and 4.1.18):\n\nWhen `Remove()` is called on a `Watcher`, it now `Wait()`s on a condition variable after calling `syscall.InotifyRmWatch()`.  The condition variable is notified from `ignoreLinux()`, at the point that we see an `Event` with the `IN_IGNORED` bit set.  This seems reasonable as the [man page for `inotify_rm_watch`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/inotify_rm_watch.2.html) says:\n\n> Removing a watch causes an `IN_IGNORED` event to be generated for this watch descriptor.\n\nHowever I'm seeing that in two of my unit tests sometimes (more than 50% of the time) there is no `IN_IGNORED` event that follows the call to `syscall.InotifyRmWatch()`.  I verified that `syscall.InotifyRmWatch()` doesn't return any error.  There is just no event on the watch descriptor that was passed to `syscall.InotifyRmWatch()`.\n\nHas anybody seen this before?\n. OK I think I got it... With this change it's no longer safe to consume Events from the same goroutine that calls `Remove()`.  In our case [our code](https://github.com/aristanetworks/tail/blob/master/watch/inotify_tracker.go#L144) basically looks this:\n\n``` go\nfunc (shared *InotifyTracker) run() {\n    // ...\n\n    for {\n        select {\n        case winfo := <-shared.watch:\n            shared.error <- shared.addWatch(winfo.fname)\n\n        case fname := <-shared.remove:\n            shared.removeWatch(fname) // <-------- no longer legit\n\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nRemoving the watch leads to a deadlock: we're trying to call `Remove()` and `Remove()` is waiting to be notified that the `IN_IGNORED` event was received, but the `IN_IGNORED` event can't be sent because `fsnotify` is trying to write another event to the `Watch`.\n. @nathany I'm happy to open an issue if you deem that this new code creates an undesirable side effect that needs to be fixed.  As you can see above, I've submitted a PR to workaround this quirk in the `tail` library.  But I agree that the new behavior of `fsnotify` as a result of this change is unfortunate because it will be more easily prone to deadlocks, depending on how the client code is written.\n. I filed bug #123.  Thanks.\n. I can't find a reliable / general way to work around this bug.\n- I'm watching a directory `foo` and my goal is to recursively watch the tree under `foo`.\n- I delete and re-create a subdirectory `foo/bar` repeatedly in rapid succession.\n- After a few iterations, I see a `REMOVE` event being emitted, followed by a `CREATE` event immediately thereafter.\n- When my code handles the `REMOVE` event, I need to call `Remove(\"foo/bar\")`, but I can't do so from whichever goroutine is receiving the event from fsnotify due this bug.  So I defer to another goroutine to call `Remove()` for me.\n- My code then handles the `CREATE` event and attempts to re-watch this directory by calling `Add(\"foo/bar\")`.\n\nNow we have two goroutines executing `Add(\"foo/bar\")` and `Remove(\"foo/bar\")` concurrently.  Let's say that `Add()` goes in first.  In `Add()` we have a first critical section:\n\n``` go\n    w.mu.Lock()\n    watchEntry, found := w.watches[name]\n    w.mu.Unlock()\n```\n\nin this scenario, `found` is `true`, because the goroutine calling `Remove()` hasn't gotten around to doing anything yet.  Then we issue the system call without holding the lock, followed by another critical section:\n\n``` go\n    wd, errno := unix.InotifyAddWatch(w.fd, name, flags)\n    if wd == -1 {\n        return errno\n    }\n\n    w.mu.Lock()\n    w.watches[name] = &watch{wd: uint32(wd), flags: flags}\n    w.paths[wd] = name\n    w.mu.Unlock()\n```\n\nNow while I'm in the system call, the `Remove()` goroutine starts to do its thing:\n\n``` go\n    w.mu.Lock()\n    defer w.mu.Unlock()\n    watch, ok := w.watches[name]\n```\n\nSo here `ok` is `true` as well and now `Remove()` will run to completion because it only releases the lock once it's done via the `defer` statement.  So it'll execute:\n\n``` go\n    success, errno := unix.InotifyRmWatch(w.fd, watch.wd)\n```\n\nAnd then it'll go in this loop that waits for the watch to be removed by the fsnotify goroutine:\n\n``` go\n    exists := true\n    for exists {\n        w.cv.Wait()\n        _, exists = w.watches[name]\n    }\n```\n\nWhen we go in `Wait()`, the lock is released, and `Add()` finishes, overwriting the entry in the maps with a different value for `wd` than before.\n\nMeanwhile fsnotify is trying to deliver the next event (which isn't, yet, the `IN_IGNORED` event required to unblock the `Remove()` call), but it's blocked trying to send on the `w.Events` channel because my code is trying to finish handling the previous `Add()`, which requires sending a message on a channel to the goroutine that is stuck in `Remove()`.\n\nBasically it seems that the only safe way to call `Remove()` is by doing `go watcher.Remove(path)`, but this creates other problems like not knowing exactly when I'm done removing a watch before I add another one.\n\nI'd like to see the code of a reliable recursive watch with fsnotify.  Currently I believe it's not possible to implement due to this bug (and due to #97, but that's another issue).\n. @nathany issue #115 and this issue are definitely the same issue.\n\n@purpleidea: I know how to write a recursive watch (and in fact I've run into this bug with the one I wrote), but what I meant is we need some sort of an integration test that stresses the filesystem and implements a recursive watch, to demonstrate that it's feasible to write this with fsnotify.  I assert that currently it is not possible to do this correctly with fsnotify, one will either deadlock, miss events, have watches removed when they shouldn't be, and not deal properly with the inotify queue overflowing in the kernel.\n. The build failed for a seemingly unrelated reason.  Going to close/re-open this PR to make Travis give it another go.. Oh wow I totally forgot about this change.  Thanks for taking a look at it.  It's not meant to fix anything it was really just a tiny code cleanup.. The current code of `Add()` contains:\n\n``` go\n    const agnosticEvents = unix.IN_MOVED_TO | unix.IN_MOVED_FROM |\n        unix.IN_CREATE | unix.IN_ATTRIB | unix.IN_MODIFY |\n        unix.IN_MOVE_SELF | unix.IN_DELETE | unix.IN_DELETE_SELF\n\n    var flags uint32 = agnosticEvents\n```\n\nSo basically the flags are hard-coded to the ones above.  Would there be any opposition to adding another API, like:\n\n``` go\nfunc (w *Watcher) Add(name string) error {\n    return w.AddWithFlags(name, agnosticEvents)\n}\n\nfunc (w *Watcher) AddWithFlags(name string, flags uint32) error {\n    // mostly the same code as the current Add() but use flags passed in argument\n```\n\nI need to ignore `IN_DELETE_SELF` because it's misleading in my case (and causes correctness issues in my code), I only care about `IN_DELETE`.\n.

Oh, I couldn't find anything with `glob`. Thanks. :)\n. There is no reason you can't have the combination of both. -- The `os` and `sys/GOOS` (replacing the confusing syscall) packages are a good example of how to approach a complicated set of APIs that are impossible to make strictly consistent across multiple platforms.\n\nOr the other option is to have all the common feature set in the `fsnotify` as an interface. The package `fsnotify` then imports platform specific implementations of the aforementioned interface under the hood and allow users to cast this implementation to platform specific types if they need platform specific features.\n. @matryer \nPerhaps because what _is_ Write can't be Remove, but what _has_ Write may have Remove too.\n\nBut overall, I agree with @nathany, I don't think any more methods should be added. \nThis library should stay as minimal as possible and only solve the problem of cross-platform portability, if you want fancy helpers, you can just write a wrapper around this library and use it.\n. IMHO, the problem with adding these methods is that you either have to unexport the `Event.Op` (breaking change, methods are more restricted than bitmask) or have overlapping API. \n\nNow overlapping APIs doesn't so bad until you consider that there are 8 backends, so where you need 8 tests, with this new methods you need at least 16, where a feature could have been inconsistent or broken in 8 places, now it can be at least 16.\n\nThis is unnecessary complexity that can be shifted into it's own package.\n. Lstat when 'Event.Dir()' is called.\n. This has a fair bit of overlapping with `Event.String()`, you should simplify `Event.String()` if you want to add `Op.String()`.\n. As explained by @matryer , the `fmt` package which is used with the `log` and other logging packages respects the `Stringer` interface. Having `Event.String() string` means that you can simply do `log.Print(event)` and you would get something nice according to the `Event.String() string` output.\n. The example doesn't check if `watcher.Events` is closed, so after calling `watcher.Close()` the outer select would block forever, assuming there are no errors.\n. -1 for always polling.\n\nThis problem can be solved in multiple ways once the _driver-based_ based design disccuesed in #8 progresses.\n. @nathany Any plans for fsnotify dirver-based architecture change? \n. See #26.\n. How do you make changes to your target file?\n. I am not sure about Sublime but Vim depending on the configurations may use Swap files. Can you reproduce this problem using vim with [swap](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/recover.html#swap-file) and [backup](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/editing.html#backup) disabled?\n. Shouldn't that unlocked be `defer`ed?\n. What is the stats on kernel versions usage? If this will upset people, I think one can make it backward compatible with direct `syscall.RawSyscall`, First trying the old SYS_EPOLL_CREATE/`1042` and then SYS_EPOLL_CREATE1/`291`?\n. I am for moving away from gopkg. For reproducible builds as you explained vendoring is the way to go.\n\nThis is a very low level library and upgrading shouldn't be a big hassle for those who want to stay up to date.\n. See #86 \n. Nothing wrong, but if you want to go this way, you need to refactor [Event.String()](https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/blob/master/fsnotify.go#L35-L53) to use `op.String()` as well.\n. I suggest that commits be merged by someone other than the author to allow for code review. This is specially important as a bad commit on master can break builds.\n.

I will be happy to help out.\n. This would be really amazing, and preferably something that is compatible with `filepath.Glob`, however, it does not support exclusion but it is easy to add [glob exclusion](https://github.com/omeid/slurp/blob/master/tools/glob/glob.go). \n. Vim uses _[swap](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/recover.html#swap-file)_ and _[backup](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/editing.html#backup)_ files, involves rename and moving.\n. Oh, I couldn't find anything with `glob`. Thanks. :)\n. There is no reason you can't have the combination of both. -- The `os` and `sys/GOOS` (replacing the confusing syscall) packages are a good example of how to approach a complicated set of APIs that are impossible to make strictly consistent across multiple platforms.\n\nOr the other option is to have all the common feature set in the `fsnotify` as an interface. The package `fsnotify` then imports platform specific implementations of the aforementioned interface under the hood and allow users to cast this implementation to platform specific types if they need platform specific features.\n. @matryer \nPerhaps because what _is_ Write can't be Remove, but what _has_ Write may have Remove too.\n\nBut overall, I agree with @nathany, I don't think any more methods should be added. \nThis library should stay as minimal as possible and only solve the problem of cross-platform portability, if you want fancy helpers, you can just write a wrapper around this library and use it.\n. IMHO, the problem with adding these methods is that you either have to unexport the `Event.Op` (breaking change, methods are more restricted than bitmask) or have overlapping API. \n\nNow overlapping APIs doesn't so bad until you consider that there are 8 backends, so where you need 8 tests, with this new methods you need at least 16, where a feature could have been inconsistent or broken in 8 places, now it can be at least 16.\n\nThis is unnecessary complexity that can be shifted into it's own package.\n. Lstat when 'Event.Dir()' is called.\n. This has a fair bit of overlapping with `Event.String()`, you should simplify `Event.String()` if you want to add `Op.String()`.\n. As explained by @matryer , the `fmt` package which is used with the `log` and other logging packages respects the `Stringer` interface. Having `Event.String() string` means that you can simply do `log.Print(event)` and you would get something nice according to the `Event.String() string` output.\n. The example doesn't check if `watcher.Events` is closed, so after calling `watcher.Close()` the outer select would block forever, assuming there are no errors.\n. -1 for always polling.\n\nThis problem can be solved in multiple ways once the _driver-based_ based design disccuesed in #8 progresses.\n. @nathany Any plans for fsnotify dirver-based architecture change? \n. See #26.\n. How do you make changes to your target file?\n. I am not sure about Sublime but Vim depending on the configurations may use Swap files. Can you reproduce this problem using vim with [swap](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/recover.html#swap-file) and [backup](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/editing.html#backup) disabled?\n. Shouldn't that unlocked be `defer`ed?\n. What is the stats on kernel versions usage? If this will upset people, I think one can make it backward compatible with direct `syscall.RawSyscall`, First trying the old SYS_EPOLL_CREATE/`1042` and then SYS_EPOLL_CREATE1/`291`?\n. I am for moving away from gopkg. For reproducible builds as you explained vendoring is the way to go.\n\nThis is a very low level library and upgrading shouldn't be a big hassle for those who want to stay up to date.\n. See #86 \n. Nothing wrong, but if you want to go this way, you need to refactor [Event.String()](https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/blob/master/fsnotify.go#L35-L53) to use `op.String()` as well.\n. I suggest that commits be merged by someone other than the author to allow for code review. This is specially important as a bad commit on master can break builds.\n. Sounds pretty reasonable things to do!\n. ",

If your company will show interest in the super block watch, that can be a game changer. wrt your recursive watcher, I am new to golang and have zero knowledge about fsnotify library, but it appears your code is not calling addSubFolders() recursively from Init() more than 1 level of depth, so if you never get events on the direct sub folders you will never add watchers for level 2 subdirs, but I may be missing something. Also I don't see any handling of Move events for dirs, unless it is handled in lib by generating Rename/Create event pair.\n\nI think I am having an algorithmic mind block, as IIRC I think some\ncases didn't work all the time. In any case, golang is very similar to\nC if you get bored :)\n. I really owe a huge thanks to @tsuna for finding this issue. I've spent more time than I am happy to admit realizing that this is what seems to have caused a huge regression in https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/. I realized it was the fsnotify code causing the problem, and eventually found this ticket.\n\nI haven't added a workaround to my code yet, and instead will use an older version of this lib for now, but this is a very real problem. I don't completely understand the fix, so patches and hints welcome :)\n\nFWIW I hit the hang here:\nhttps://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify/blob/master/inotify.go#L158\n. @tsuna I have a (possibly broken) implementation of a recursive watcher here: https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/blob/master/recwatch/recwatch.go#L19 I did rollback the version of this lib to avoid this bug though. I also think I found at least one issue with my lib anyways. In any case, HTH and a permanent fix is definitely welcome.\n. This is in response to:\n\n```\nerr = watcher.Add(current)\nif err == syscall.ENOENT\n```\n\nOn OSX this apparently doesn't trigger for file not found and generates a different event. Maybe it's just a different error code on OSX? I don't have a mac, so IDK.\n. (that works on GNU/Linux, btw)\n. @aarondl RE:\r\n\r\n> I've signed the CLA and REALLY didn't want to.

IOW, if you want to\npause one, at least only run your pause when Len() is zero or less than\nsome threshold.\n\nThis would often be as part of a heuristic, therefore if a particular\nbackend always buffers internally and this number isn't available for\ninspection, and thus always returns 0 for the length, this isn't the end of\nthe world as long as it's documented.\n\nThanks again,\nJames\n. w00t! Build is now green. Enjoy!\n. @omeid Looks similar, but of course my patch is more correct. I don't see what the problem is, this is a useful thing.\n. To add some context, if you print out the Op, you just get a useless number instead of a useful string:\n\nhttps://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/blob/master/file.go#L158\n. @omeid Oh, I'm sorry. I misunderstood what the other thread was saying. I'm happy to refactor it, and I will do it in a moment. Do you wish to require that the strings stay uppercase as to avoid changing that string interface, or can we switch them to the same case as in my Op. (My preference.)\n. @omeid Patch updated and passes tests on my machine. The failure seems to be some bug in the build system or an issue that I don't understand. The error is:\n\n```\n./fsnotify.go:44: o.String undefined (type Op has no field or method String)\n```\n\nBut I call the go generate function, and it WFM.\n. Ping?\n. Hi @nathany I \"tunnel vision\" never thought to use Errorf instead of Fatalf. Good suggestion, fixed!\n\nI also made the other changes.\n\nAs an aside, I prefer to generate the Stringer stuff instead of committing it, so I was wondering why you would like to do it this way? In any case, it's in my patch the way you preferred.\n\nCheers!\n. @nathany \nDoesn't work for me:\n\n```\n--- FAIL: TestEventStringify (0.00s)\n    fsnotify_test.go:43: Stringify expected: `\"foo2\": Write|Chmod`; got: `\"foo2\": nil`.\n    fsnotify_test.go:47: Stringify expected: `\"foo3\": Create|Write|Remove|Rename|Chmod`; got: `\"foo3\": nil`.\nFAIL\nexit status 1\nFAIL    _/home/james/code/src/fsnotify  13.449s\n```\n. @nathany Good point RE: go generate. In this case if there's no mechanism to run this automatically, then I consider this an issue with `go get`.\n\nAs for the test failure, it is currently passing. I don't have a Windows machine.\nAt this point if there's something else you want to modify, feel free to just add a patch on top of mine if it would make it easier for you.\n\nCheers\n. @nathany ping :(\n. @nathany What's missing?\n. @nathany\n\n> see the comments i made during code review.\n\nI don't know what's missing... \n\n> This PR still needs a little more work before it's merged. I can do the work, but I haven't had a chance to yet.\n\nThis was just a \"get my feet wet\" patch for this project. Feel free to do with it what you want or not. Cheers!\n. Patch is here: https://github.com/purpleidea/fsnotify/tree/feat/stringify if you want it. I'm going to close this for now.\n. Just wanted to get the approximate ACK, so that I can point people here if they're interested in fanotify benefits. Thanks!\n. @nathany Thanks for the info! Looking forward to @amir73il's patches!\r\n\r\nCheers. @amir73il I have pinged some kernel engineers at my company to look into your patch. In the meantime, if you have a moment, could you look into and recommend an algorithm or suggest an improvement to the recursive file watching which I've implemented for mgmt? The code is available here:\r\nhttps://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/blob/master/recwatch/recwatch.go#L134\r\n\r\nCheers!. On Wed, Feb 1, 2017 at 3:26 AM, Amir Goldstein <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n>\n> @purpleidea thanks for the ping. If your company will show interest in the super block watch, that can be a game changer. wrt your recursive watcher, I am new to golang and have zero knowledge about fsnotify library, but it appears your code is not calling addSubFolders() recursively from Init() more than 1 level of depth, so if you never get events on the direct sub folders you will never add watchers for level 2 subdirs, but I may be missing something. Also I don't see any handling of Move events for dirs, unless it is handled in lib by generating Rename/Create event pair.\n\nI think I am having an algorithmic mind block, as IIRC I think some\ncases didn't work all the time. In any case, golang is very similar to\nC if you get bored :)\n. I really owe a huge thanks to @tsuna for finding this issue. I've spent more time than I am happy to admit realizing that this is what seems to have caused a huge regression in https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/. I realized it was the fsnotify code causing the problem, and eventually found this ticket.\n\nI haven't added a workaround to my code yet, and instead will use an older version of this lib for now, but this is a very real problem. I don't completely understand the fix, so patches and hints welcome :)\n\nFWIW I hit the hang here:\nhttps://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify/blob/master/inotify.go#L158\n. @tsuna I have a (possibly broken) implementation of a recursive watcher here: https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/blob/master/recwatch/recwatch.go#L19 I did rollback the version of this lib to avoid this bug though. I also think I found at least one issue with my lib anyways. In any case, HTH and a permanent fix is definitely welcome.\n. This is in response to:\n\n```\nerr = watcher.Add(current)\nif err == syscall.ENOENT\n```\n\nOn OSX this apparently doesn't trigger for file not found and generates a different event. Maybe it's just a different error code on OSX? I don't have a mac, so IDK.\n. (that works on GNU/Linux, btw)\n. @aarondl RE:\r\n\r\n> I've signed the CLA and REALLY didn't want to. I'm fairly upset that this repo requires this, and then I read this only to find out I signed it without reason: golang/go#4068 (comment)\r\n\r\nI too am strongly against this! +1\r\n\r\nThanks for the patch.

For example, `vim`:\n\n```\n2015/03/25 23:18:42 event: \"./foo.txt\": RENAME\n2015/03/25 23:18:42 event: \"./foo.txt~\": CREATE\n2015/03/25 23:18:42 event: \"./foo.txt\": CREATE\n2015/03/25 23:18:42 event: \"./foo.txt\": WRITE\n2015/03/25 23:18:42 modified file: ./foo.txt\n```\n\nIt seems like the most compatible strategy is to listen to the directory and only pay attention to events matching the file name, but it's not clear which event types to listen to.

I'm guessing @extemporalgenome's original question was \"How can an fsnotify user listen for changes to a single file in a way that works with all [the various text editors' save strategies](https://github.com/guard/guard/wiki/Analysis-of-inotify-events-for-different-editors)?\".\n\nMany editors are do a little dance around saving which confounds the strategy of listening to the file for write events. For example, `vim`:\n\n```\n2015/03/25 23:18:42 event: \"./foo.txt\": RENAME\n2015/03/25 23:18:42 event: \"./foo.txt~\": CREATE\n2015/03/25 23:18:42 event: \"./foo.txt\": CREATE\n2015/03/25 23:18:42 event: \"./foo.txt\": WRITE\n2015/03/25 23:18:42 modified file: ./foo.txt\n```\n\nIt seems like the most compatible strategy is to listen to the directory and only pay attention to events matching the file name, but it's not clear which event types to listen to. Just `fsevents.Write` is enough for vim. For many other editors, `IN_MOVE_TO` is needed.\n. @nathany thanks, #17 is just what I was looking for.\n\nIt seems like file watching works across atomic saves on OSX (the watch stays with the path, even though the underlying file is replaced).

    "anthonyfok": "Hi @nathany,\n\nI think what you said earlier, i.e. \"When a REMOVE event happens, it stops watching that file\", hits the nail right on the head.\n\nI ran into the same problem, on Linux, while trying out Hugo v0.15's new \"dynamically reload config file\" feature.  While editors like GNU nano triggers the WRITE event, other editors like Vim and GNOME gedit first save the changes to a temporary file, then moving the tempfile to replace the original file, triggering a REMOVE event before a CREATE or WRITE event, but the CREATE or WRITE event was never detected because the watcher quits prematurely!\n\nPlease see spf13/viper#142 for more details.\n\nIf that is the case, I don't think this bug is \"OS X (kqueue)\"-specific.  Rather, if the \"When a REMOVE event happens, it stops watching that file\" behaviour is \"as-designed\", perhaps that design needs to be changed.\n\nMany thanks for looking into this.\n. +1  You're awesome, bep!  :-)\n. It turns out that all of the \"function not implemented\" (ENOSYS) errors from `go test ./...` originated from [Line 85 in inotify_poller.go](https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/blob/master/inotify_poller.go#L85):\n\n``` go\n    n, errno := syscall.EpollWait(poller.epfd, events, -1)\n```\n\nIt turns out that epoll_wait is [deprecated](http://people.linaro.org/~rikuvoipio/aarch64-talk/?transition=linear#/18/1) according to a slideshow by Linaro who ported Linux to ARM64, and therefore, only the newer epoll_pwait is provided on Linux/arm64.\n\nProblem is, Go has not yet implemented the corresponding EpollPwait, see the \"Unimplemented\" section of [go/src/syscall/syscall_linux.go:948](https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/master/src/syscall/syscall_linux.go#948) and [golang.org/x/sys/unix/syscall_linux.go:971](https://go.googlesource.com/sys/+/master/unix/syscall_linux.go#971).\n\nIt seems that the Go developers are aware of the issue, see golang/go#10235, though the milestone there changed from **Go1.5** to **Go1.6Early**, and now **Unplanned**...  Hmm...\n. By the way, for completeness sake, `syscall.InotifyInit()` should probably be changed to `syscall.InotifyInit1(0)` too in inotify.go.  `inotify_init` is a \"system call without flags parameter\" according to [this slide](http://people.linaro.org/~rikuvoipio/aarch64-talk/?transition=linear#/18/3) and /usr/include/asm-generic/unistd.h, so `inotify_init` is again not available on ARM64 though Go has a wrapper for it.  ;-)\n\nLast but not least, the following links were very helpful in teaching me to understand `epoll_wait` and `epoll_pwait` better:\n- [Porting Applications to 64-bit ARM](http://people.linaro.org/~rikuvoipio/aarch64-talk/): http://people.linaro.org/~rikuvoipio/aarch64-talk/\n- libuv: linux: fix epoll_pwait() fallback on arm64: https://github.com/libuv/libuv/commit/1d8332f\n- Julia fails to build on arm64 due to missing `__NR_epoll_wait`: https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/14373\n- LWN: epoll_pwait for 2.6.18 ... (25 Sep 2006, Linux Kernel Mailing List): https://lwn.net/Articles/201084/\n. Thank you for such a wonderful plan of action that you have summarized.\n\nAbout adding EpollPwait to x/sys, I don't think I am currently up to the challenge due to a lack of experience in this area and a lack of time (will be very busy in the next week).

Thank you for your great work, @suihkulokki!\n\nCc: @nathany\n. Hi @nathany,\n\nI think what you said earlier, i.e. \"When a REMOVE event happens, it stops watching that file\", hits the nail right on the head.\n\nI ran into the same problem, on Linux, while trying out Hugo v0.15's new \"dynamically reload config file\" feature.  While editors like GNU nano triggers the WRITE event, other editors like Vim and GNOME gedit first save the changes to a temporary file, then moving the tempfile to replace the original file, triggering a REMOVE event before a CREATE or WRITE event, but the CREATE or WRITE event was never detected because the watcher quits prematurely!\n\nPlease see spf13/viper#142 for more details.\n\nIf that is the case, I don't think this bug is \"OS X (kqueue)\"-specific.  Rather, if the \"When a REMOVE event happens, it stops watching that file\" behaviour is \"as-designed\", perhaps that design needs to be changed.\n\nMany thanks for looking into this.\n. +1  You're awesome, bep!  :-)\n. It turns out that all of the \"function not implemented\" (ENOSYS) errors from `go test ./...` originated from [Line 85 in inotify_poller.go](https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/blob/master/inotify_poller.go#L85):\n\n``` go\n    n, errno := syscall.EpollWait(poller.epfd, events, -1)\n```\n\nIt turns out that epoll_wait is [deprecated](http://people.linaro.org/~rikuvoipio/aarch64-talk/?transition=linear#/18/1) according to a slideshow by Linaro who ported Linux to ARM64, and therefore, only the newer epoll_pwait is provided on Linux/arm64.\n\nProblem is, Go has not yet implemented the corresponding EpollPwait, see the \"Unimplemented\" section of [go/src/syscall/syscall_linux.go:948](https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/master/src/syscall/syscall_linux.go#948) and [golang.org/x/sys/unix/syscall_linux.go:971](https://go.googlesource.com/sys/+/master/unix/syscall_linux.go#971).\n\nIt seems that the Go developers are aware of the issue, see golang/go#10235, though the milestone there changed from **Go1.5** to **Go1.6Early**, and now **Unplanned**...  Hmm...\n. By the way, for completeness sake, `syscall.InotifyInit()` should probably be changed to `syscall.InotifyInit1(0)` too in inotify.go.  `inotify_init` is a \"system call without flags parameter\" according to [this slide](http://people.linaro.org/~rikuvoipio/aarch64-talk/?transition=linear#/18/3) and /usr/include/asm-generic/unistd.h, so `inotify_init` is again not available on ARM64 though Go has a wrapper for it.  ;-)\n\nLast but not least, the following links were very helpful in teaching me to understand `epoll_wait` and `epoll_pwait` better:\n- [Porting Applications to 64-bit ARM](http://people.linaro.org/~rikuvoipio/aarch64-talk/): http://people.linaro.org/~rikuvoipio/aarch64-talk/\n- libuv: linux: fix epoll_pwait() fallback on arm64: https://github.com/libuv/libuv/commit/1d8332f\n- Julia fails to build on arm64 due to missing `__NR_epoll_wait`: https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/14373\n- LWN: epoll_pwait for 2.6.18 ... (25 Sep 2006, Linux Kernel Mailing List): https://lwn.net/Articles/201084/\n. Thank you for such a wonderful plan of action that you have summarized.\n\nAbout adding EpollPwait to x/sys, I don't think I am currently up to the challenge due to a lack of experience in this area and a lack of time (will be very busy in the next week).  That said, if no one else has fixed it in a month or two, I would be interested to experiment with it and see if I could come up with a preliminary patch.  :-)\n\nYou have a good point there about InotifyInit1().

If nothing else (see below), I vote that a special check `if mask&syscall.IN_Q_OVERFLOW == syscall.IN_Q_OVERFLOW { return false }` is put in at the top of the method. This will end up as the default value of Event that comes across the user channel.\n\nActually changing the `if !(e.Op&Remove == Remove || e.Op&Rename == Rename) { }` to a white list instead of a negative would have avoid this issue in the first place.

Ok I found this issue in this package. At https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/blob/master/inotify.go#L280 because the `e.Name` will not be filled, the `Lstat()` returns an error that `os.IsNotExist()` returns true for and the event is skipped.\n\nSince the overflow event is critical it needs to get into the user code. If nothing else (see below), I vote that a special check `if mask&syscall.IN_Q_OVERFLOW == syscall.IN_Q_OVERFLOW { return false }` is put in at the top of the method. This will end up as the default value of Event that comes across the user channel.\n\nActually changing the `if !(e.Op&Remove == Remove || e.Op&Rename == Rename) { }` to a white list instead of a negative would have avoid this issue in the first place. Overflow is not the only special event that could come through. \n\nI am very dubious about ignoring any of these events. That method says in a comment that it is there because it saw a write come through after a delete event, how could that happen?\n. ",

If the signal comes after the check, then it'll just hang unless a new event happens to make its way through and restart the loop.\n\nThis is a stack trace where fsnotify hangs:\n\n```\ngoroutine 90 [syscall]:\nsyscall.Syscall(0x0, 0x9, 0xc8204bbe40, 0x10000, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0)\n  third_party/go/gc/src/syscall/asm_linux_amd64.s:18 +0x5\nsyscall.read(0x9, 0xc8204bbe40, 0x10000, 0x10000, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0)\n  third_party/go/gc/src/syscall/zsyscall_linux_amd64.go:776 +0x5f\nsyscall.Read(0x9, 0xc8204bbe40, 0x10000, 0x10000, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0)\n  third_party/go/gc/src/syscall/syscall_unix.go:161 +0x4d\nthird_party/golang/fsnotify/fsnotify.(*Watcher).readEvents(0xc82035e680)\n  third_party/golang/fsnotify/inotify.go:144 +0x13f\ncreated by third_party/golang/fsnotify/fsnotify.NewWatcher\n  third_party/golang/fsnotify/inotify.go:47 +0x365\n```\n.

Closing the socket allows the kernel to reuse it. \nIf the goroutine is blocked on the read when the fd is closed, things work as expected.

The following snippet will fail pretty reliably:\n\n```\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"io/ioutil\"\n    \"os\"\n    \"path\"\n    \"strconv\"\n    \"time\"\n\n    \"github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify\"\n)\n\ntype Test struct {\n    Watcher fsnotify.Watcher\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\n    testDirPrefix := \"/tmp/test\"\n\n    w, _ := fsnotify.NewWatcher()\n    t := Test{Watcher: *w}\n\n    fmt.Println(\"creating test dir\")\n\n    concDirs := 100\n    fmt.Println(\"adding watchers...\")\n    for i := 0; i < concDirs; i++ {\n        dirName := path.Join(testDirPrefix, strconv.Itoa(i))\n        os.MkdirAll(dirName, 0700)\n        t.Watcher.Add(dirName)\n    }\n\n    go func() {\n        fmt.Println(\"polling...\")\n        for {\n            select {\n            case <-t.Watcher.Events:\n            }\n        }\n    }()\n\n    time.Sleep(time.Second)\n\n    for i := 0; i < concDirs; i++ {\n        dirName := path.Join(testDirPrefix, strconv.Itoa(i))\n        os.MkdirAll(dirName+\"/subdir\", 700)\n        go func() {\n            for {\n                t.Watcher.Add(dirName + \"/subdir\")\n                ioutil.WriteFile(path.Join(dirName, \"file\"), []byte(\"blah\"), 0600)\n                t.Watcher.Remove(dirName + \"/subdir\")\n            }\n        }()\n    }\n\n    time.Sleep(time.Second)\n\n    fmt.Println(\"cleaning up\")\n    time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)\n    os.RemoveAll(testDirPrefix)\n}\n```\n\nuntil the following patch is applied\n\n```\ndiff --git a/example.go b/example-fix.go\nindex f9ccfc0..f555803 100644\n--- a/example.go\n+++ b/example-fix.go\n@@ -12,7 +12,7 @@ import (\n )\n\n type Test struct {\n-   Watcher fsnotify.Watcher\n+   Watcher *fsnotify.Watcher\n }\n\n func main() {\n@@ -20,7 +20,7 @@ func main() {\n    testDirPrefix := \"/tmp/test\"\n\n    w, _ := fsnotify.NewWatcher()\n-   t := Test{Watcher: *w}\n+   t := Test{Watcher: w}\n\n    fmt.Println(\"creating test dir\")\n\n```\n\nPretty subtle. \n. The larger issue can probably be addressed this way (I might be missing something though):\n\n```\ndiff --git a/inotify.go b/inotify.go\nindex 9700df5..44f3aa6 100644\n--- a/inotify.go\n+++ b/inotify.go\n@@ -23,8 +23,8 @@ import (\n type Watcher struct {\n  Events   chan Event\n  Errors   chan error\n- mu       sync.Mutex // Map access\n- cv       *sync.Cond // sync removing on rm_watch with IN_IGNORE\n+ mu       *sync.Mutex // Map access\n+ cv       *sync.Cond  // sync removing on rm_watch with IN_IGNORE\n  fd       int\n  poller   *fdPoller\n  watches  map[string]*watch // Map of inotify watches (key: path)\n@@ -55,8 +55,9 @@ func NewWatcher() (*Watcher, error) {\n    Errors:   make(chan error),\n    done:     make(chan struct{}),\n    doneResp: make(chan struct{}),\n+   mu:       &sync.Mutex{},\n  }\n- w.cv = sync.NewCond(&w.mu)\n+ w.cv = sync.NewCond(w.mu)\n\n  go w.readEvents()\n  return w, nil\n```\n\nBut it would require some more extensive testing. What do you guys think about this solution?\n. @nathany Just a side note: this is not `inotify`-specific. The issue is reproducible on Darwin with `kqueue`, I just instructed the curious tester to fit print statements in `inotify`, but the same can be done in `kqueue.go`.\n.

    "vladlosev": "What is happening here is that Linux's inotify actually delivers two notifications when a file is deleted.

Convert the `IN_ATTRIB` notification into `Remove` for files which do not show up on disk. This will cause fsnotify to always deliver two `Remove` notifications. That may break some existing clients.\r\n 2. Deliver the `Chmod` notification even for files that do not appear on disk anymore. This will allow clients at least some notification about what's happening with the file. This will probably also affect some clients but I believe fewer are checking `Chmod` events than `Delete` ones.\r\n 3. Introduce a special watching mode that will treat open files correctly. This will require addition to the API.. What is happening here is that Linux's inotify actually delivers two notifications when a file is deleted.

Probably lots of things don't have native Go interfaces yet.  Using \"syscall\" is another matter.  It's explicitly deprecated.  I see two places where syscall is used explicitly in the code.  1) It's used to access the enumeration of errno values.

The code starts by using os.FileInfo, then goes through Sys() to get the stat_t.  It does this because the FileInfo doesn't include atime or ctime members. (access time / create time).
