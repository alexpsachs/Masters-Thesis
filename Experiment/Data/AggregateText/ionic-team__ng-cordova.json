One idea:\n\nNotify when a plugin isn't installed. Perhaps something like this in a plugin?\n\n``` javascript\nfactory('$cordovaCamera', ['$cordovaPlugin', function($cordovaPlugin) {\n  // Throw an error if running inside Cordova, but using this plugin without it installed\n  $cordovaPlugin.check('org.apache.cordova.camera');\n}]);\n```\n. ``` javascript\n.config(function($compileProvider){\n  $compileProvider.imgSrcSanitizationWhitelist(/^\\s*(https?|ftp|mailto|file|tel):/);\n})\n\n```\n.

The Toast plugin is awesome! Add in https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/commit/723d4fa29cae53af09e6c5fffe9f3a88a2124023\n. @camposcristian90 YES you can, look at the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines if you need advice and help making a PR\n. True, closing now\n. A new WIP is happening @ #386. Would love to hear your thoughts and comments\n. Yeah sorry, I'm not the best at git right now, and couldn't figure out how to separate each plugin into its own PR. I'm trying out the Contacts plugin, but it's much more complicated, and lacks documentation in some places.\n. Sure. This plugin is:\nhttps://github.com/wildabeast/BarcodeScanner\n\nAll the plugins + links I added for this project [are in this Issue I made this morning](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/issues/7)\n. This is now complete for the following plugins:\n- Geolocation\n- Device Motion\n- Device Orientation\n. I believe we can close this WIP and PR now, since we've merged a different version of mocks.\n. https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/commit/a0ea18f06309430aa3adf1c862c93ba0bc7ee156\n. Closes: \n[#16](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/issues/16)\n[#18](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/issues/18)\n [#19](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/issues/19)\n. This has been included in the dialogs plugin, take a look at the docs + src files\n. Good Points! I'll let the PR go through and we can make more edits after.\n\nThe [File Plugin](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/3.0.0/cordova_file_file.md.html) has a lot of methods and properties, so it's much more complex than other plugins.\n. @yrezgui  I'm making a [SQLite Plugin](https://github.com/brodysoft/Cordova-SQLitePlugin) if you can help? https://gist.github.com/pbernasconi/ebd1551c8c619fba0a9a\n. I think people do. It's the forth most popular plugin on [PlugReg](http://plugreg.com/plugins).\n\n[This article](http://www.senchatouchdev.com/wordpress/2013/04/19/sencha-touch-clarifying-websql-sqlite-and-how-they-relate-to-sencha-touch/) describes the difference, and I think it's clear that SQLite is better. There is also a lot of demand for it on the forums.\n. @yrezgui I'm a bit confused, you plugin is for [Cordova File Plugin](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/2.4.0/cordova_file_file.md.html) right? but your commit is for saving contacts.\n\nI also just submitted a file plugin\n\nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/29\n. Needs support for [SQLCipher](http://sqlcipher.net/):\n\niOS: [integrating SQLCipher for iOS](http://brodyspark.blogspot.ch/2012/12/integrating-sqlcipher-with.html)\nAndroid: [integrating SQLCipher for Android](http://brodyspark.blogspot.ch/2012/12/using-sqlcipher-for-android-with.html)\n. @MGMsystems I added the note in the docs. https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/issues/50 Thanks for the heads-up. Not sure why it's required, but will do some investigating.\n. I'm going to close this issue for now, since it's been resolved in the docs.\n. Yes I believe it is possible: [Camera Docs](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-camera/blob/master/doc/index.md#options) look at Media Type:\n\n```\nCamera.MediaType = {\n    PICTURE: 0,    // allow selection of still pictures only. DEFAULT. Will return format specified via DestinationType\n    VIDEO: 1,      // allow selection of video only, WILL ALWAYS RETURN FILE_URI\n    ALLMEDIA : 2   // allow selection from all media types\n};\n```\n\nTry passing in your options like:\n\n```\n$cordovaCamera.getPicture({mediaType: 1})\n```\n. Added. https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/47  Should be working, please let me know if there are any issues.\n\nAlso note the different types of options you have to include specific for each device:\nhttps://github.com/phonegap-build/PushPlugin#-plugin-api\n. Try: `bower install ngCordova`\n. Done https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/commit/bb3eb61f8dcf81adf471f3c65d060655322db16a\n. I just added the media plugin: a2355175dcc75a2e55d9beebc72c448dae94fabe\n\nIt requires testing, and more editing. Basic usuage:\n\n```\nvar source = $cordovaMedia.newMedia('file/path/audio.mp3')\n\nvar my_media = source.media;\nvar mediaStatus = source.mediaStatus;\nvar promise = source.promise.then(success, error);\n\n$cordovaMedia.play(my_media);\n$cordovaMedia.stop(my_media);\n$cordovaMedia.seekTo(my_media, 1000); // milliseconds\n$cordovaMedia.startRecord(my_media);\n$cordovaMedia.release(my_media);\n$cordovaMedia.getCurrentPosition(my_media).then(success, error);\n```\n\nI'm not entirely sure that this will work as above, since the media plugin actually uses a `Media Object`, but it's a first effort.\n. I've badly implemented the media plugin, and I know the current solution doesn't work. Stay tuned for an update soon(er-than-later).\n. Good catch, thanks!\n. Thanks for the plugins! Note for future: you have to add `'ngCordova.plugin.<plugin name>` to the module.js in the plugins folder.\n. Also, will this work for your plugins to install them?\n`cordova plugin add https://github.com/Paldom/PinDialog.git`\n`cordova plugin add https://github.com/Paldom/SpinnerDialog.git`\n. Thanks for the helpful notice! https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/commit/952f20a5079ca036400a3d0e19dec82444588234\n. We could deprecate the old plugin (by allowing both plugins to work harmoniously) if possible, and when we release v0.2.0-beta remove it all together.\n. Done, and closing now.\n. Thanks! I fixed it in this commit: https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/commit/0749ab557e138eb17dc3cf9a327fa65c72d9f953\n. Thanks, good catch! Fixed in: https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/commit/74227f9ba3ec8553277a29c18a2cab25e6b9facf\n. Yup, just checked thanks for the fix!\n. @pellekrogholt I can't test on an Android, but have you tried putting the `ng-cordova.js` file before `cordova.js` like:\n\n```\n<script src=\"lib/ngCordova/dist/ng-cordova.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"cordova.js\"></script>\n```\n\n[The docs](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-network-information/blob/master/doc/index.md) don't say anything special about Android, so it may be an issue with installing the plugin.\n\nAlso check out http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15894201/checking-of-internet-connection-of-device-using-phonegap\n. Strange, I have it working on my iPhone using ngCordova. I'm thinking it's an issue with cordova or the plugin, and not ngCordova.\n. @pellekrogholt did you resolve this issue? I think you may have to wrap the network call in a `deviceready` event like : \n\n```\ndocument.addEventListener(\"deviceready\", function () {\n  $cordovaPlugin.someFunction().then(success, error);\n}, false);\n\n// OR with Ionic\n\n$ionicPlatform.ready(function() {\n  $cordovaPlugin.someFunction().then(success, error);\n});\n```\n. @kristianbenoit problem fixed? can I close this issue?\n. Also check out the **Common Issues** in the [docs](http://ngcordova.com/docs/), right after the install paragraph.\n. The Barcode Scanner plugin already does this.\n. Hi @programming-kid thanks for the PR, but I just added the Toast Plugin a few minutes ago! (https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/commit/723d4fa29cae53af09e6c5fffe9f3a88a2124023)\n. I think this issue was caused due to browser use, so I'm closing this as a non-ngCordova issue\n. Great stuff! Thanks for the PR.\n. Thanks!\n. I agree, it's a bit out of place otherwise. Fixed in https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/commit/3bc93c97a89694ecf49a3d49af7514c5ebc421f0\n. They are forthcoming. I just added a few more plugins to the documentation in https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/commit/3bc93c97a89694ecf49a3d49af7514c5ebc421f0 (hope everything is correct!). \n\nAs of now, plugins that are missing in the docs:\n- SQLite\n- Google Analytics (freshly added)\n- Ionic Keyboard \n- Local Notifications\n- Capture (freshly added)\n. @cfjedimaster the globalization plugin has been added to the official docs now! I'm keeping a list of the plugins which still need to be added to the docs: https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/issues/203\n. I'm going to leave this up to the Ionic team @mlynch \nMaybe when ngCordova is a bit more stable and unit-tested, it will be ready for easy downloads.\n. A link to ngCordova has been added to the footer of the Ionic site, but I think it'd be nice to have a download link on the [ngCordova.com](http://ngcordova.com/) home page. Will be done momentarily.\n. Did you call the function?\n\n`var type = $cordovaNetwork.getNetwork();`\n. Thanks for pointing that out. I just fixed it, so should be working now! https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/commit/154eeb142ff538a6e75e4f0091ba8db2e2b90b17\n. Just checked the older documentation, and you're right. thanks for the fix\n. Yes, we're currently working on a way to mock plugin data when the plugin isn't available. Please look at this issue https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/15, and submit any of your thoughts!\n. @yrezgui we've merged ng-cordova-mocks into the /src/ files, take a look at them and let me know what you think! Feel free to contribute more\n. @phaggood This is fantastic! I'm gonna look into the bugs you mentioned and through the code, but thanks for the great work.\n. Thanks for that, I must have copied my own code and forgot to make the appropriate changes.\n. Since the latest updates to the demo files, I think this has been resolved, including some of the other minor changes you made, thanks for the PR though!\n. @pellekrogholt this has now been added to the main plugins, and should be on the ngcordova.com/docs page as well\n. I believe this is now fixed in https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/commit/56d17a826ef1a0cd3fbf32c865ad20c996c30553.\n. I think this is a good call. Thanks.\n. @mrzmyr I just added a changelog in 432e48077bf27fea39882897987b6e6f9e38c2c4 , and will hopefully build an automatic changelog creator (perhaps using grunt and [ajoslin's code](https://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog)). Thanks for the idea\n. @kornatzky have you resolved this issue? If so, I'll close this issue.\n. Thanks for clearing that up @mrzmyr. Since this issue is not directly related to ngCordova, I'm going to close this for now and ask that you refer to the official plugin docs for help.\n. @EddyVerbruggen thanks for the advice, and I like your ideas. I'll be adding a link to each plugin shortly. \n\nAlso please note that the docs have been updated quite a bit since June 21, with deeplinking, sidemenus, and a link to the original plugin + how to install.\n\nIf you'd like to discuss more linking your plugins to the ng-cordova wrapper let me know!\n. Thanks for the plugin!\n. Demand seems to be high for the FB plugin, I'll try and get this done by this weekend! Would love your help for fixes, etc after.\n. The FB plugin has [now been merged into ng-cordova](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/commit/1d363bbfb1c03e9481fc491f4d1aec7067d9aaa1#diff-d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e). I'm not sure it's working yet, but take a look at the [source code](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/1d363bbfb1c03e9481fc491f4d1aec7067d9aaa1/src/plugins/facebookConnect.js).\n. This FB plugin is done! And working (on iOS at least), with an example in the /demo folder! [Check out the docs for examples](http://ngcordova.com/docs/#Facebook) and [the official docs for a successful install](https://github.com/Wizcorp/phonegap-facebook-plugin)\n. @mlynch I started a new WIP-docs-sidemenu branch for this feature. I basically copied the Ionic Sidemenu in the docs, including the JS and CSS. It needs some work, but it's a start and it's working too.\n. Officially merged and done.\n. The docs have been updated to reflect the most recent changes in the Push plugin. http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/pushNotifications/\n\nMake sure to install the **latest** version of ngCordova to get the latest changes.\n. @farconada does this help:\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/14070841/phonegap-open-link-in-browser\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser/blob/master/doc/index.md\n. @morenoh149 if have the time to add the local notification plugins to the docs it would be very welcome! :)\n. Awesome, it's fixed now\n. I like the idea.\n\nThis can easily be done using a `bash` file such as `plugin-install.sh`, something like:\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfunction ap {\n  cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.$1\n}\n\nap camera\nap console\nap contacts\nap device\nap dialogs\nap device-motion\nap device-orientation\nap network-information\nap geolocation\nap file\nap splashscreen\nap statusbar\nap vibration\ncordova plugin add https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-plugins-keyboard\ncordova plugin add https://github.com/wildabeast/BarcodeScanner.git \ncordova plugin add https://github.com/chrisekelley/AppPreferences\ncordova plugin add https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/Flashlight-PhoneGap-Plugin.git\ncordova plugin add https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/Toast-PhoneGap-Plugin.git\n```\n\nref: https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/demo/init.sh\n. It's a nice idea, but I don't think this will be in the future plans for ngCordova. As max said, it makes things very complicated, and is probably overkill. Closing this for now.\n. This is a duplicate of https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/issues/103, but I do agree with you 100% , and it will be implemented soon.\n. To check if cordova / device is ready, you can use\n\n```\ndocument.addEventListener(\"deviceready\", onDeviceReady, false);\n\nfunction onDeviceReady() {\n    // Now safe to use device APIs\n}\n```\n\nCheck out the [Cordova Docs - DeviceReady()](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/3.5.0/cordova_events_events.md.html#deviceready).\n\nWe're trying to implement this into ngCordova, and would welcome any ideas in https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/issues/8\n. Dup of https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/issues/102. Trying to get this work.\n. I just added the Printer Plugin from https://github.com/katzer/cordova-plugin-printer/ in https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/commit/77d433a2f390c05eb2a25e09de001e7bc33831bd. Adding the plugin to the docs would be very helpful if you have the time!\n. I merged a PR today with the google maps plugin mentioned above. https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/commit/bdc09bd8d935aaf9191b7b629fe4ff33a30eadd3 I haven't been able to test it yet, and looking through the code, it definitely requires quite a bit of work.\n\nIf you can help resolve some of its issues, with your past experiences that would be great!  \n. @andrewmcgivery @mrzmyr is correct: it should use `$q.defer()`. I had to add this myself because your PR had conflicts. You can check it out at: f54bdc8efc893373b2f421c48022422ac2c28735.\n\nAlso, the `$customURLScheme` has errors in the code. Do you think you could check it out and make a new PR?\n. @samrods1989 I'm not sure what your question is exactly, but I think whatever problems you may have had, have been resolved in https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/commit/ca9fff78aa985a30b8b44fe8a3cbec0cc1a0271d. Closing this for now, and let me know if you have any other problems\n. This is a good idea, but I'm not entirely sure how to implement this in a factory wrapper. Maybe something as simple as:\n\n```\nwatchIfOnline: function() {\n  var q = $q.defer()\n  $window.addEventListener(\"online\", \n      function () {\n         q.resolve();\n      }, function() {\n         q.reject();\n      });\n   return q.promise;\n}\n```\n\nWhat do you think @jimthedev @Natsu- \n. @jimthedev Just added this to the `master` 3cccfe409b44710e9677a3d9434b3efe346e6379. Use it like so:\n\n```\n$cordovaNetwork.watchOffline(); // start watch\n$cordovaNetwork.watchOnline(); // start watch\n\n$rootScope.$on(\"networkOffline\", function () {\n  alert(\"Device is now Offline!\"); // fires every time offline event is true\n});\n\n$rootScope.$on(\"networkOnline\", function () {\n  alert(\"Device is Online!\"); // fires every time online event is true\n})\n```\n\nIt will be in the docs soon. But check out the demo app (app.js file) for now for an example.\n. The changes were added after the 0.1.9 release (which is the latest), so they are not available through bower yet. v2.0 is around the corner though, and will include the updates to the network plugin\n. @leemannd In theory you should be able to access everything that the position produces. [The docs indicate](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-geolocation/blob/master/doc/index.md) that if you return `position` in the promise:\n\n```\nposition.coords.altitude\nposition.coords.altitudeAccuracy\n```\n\nthose two should be accessible. Maybe it's more of an issue with cordova / the plugin rather than ng-cordova. Let me know if that works.\n. Closing this issues as stale, and hopefully resolved. @leemannd Please open it again if you continue to have this problem.\n. Fixed in 0b30ba153c86977f2b91a1a234de33b3de95b829.\n\n`readFile` is now deprecated (but still works, so as not to break), and the new api for `$cordovaFile` is:\n- `readAsText`\n- `readAsDataURL`\n- `readAsBinaryString`\n- `readAsArrayBuffer`\n. Fixed in #132.\n. The file plugin has been updated to use `resolveLocalFileSystemURL` (in the master). Docs show changes too. Hopefully that fixes your issues.\n. Hi, this is a duplicate of #125, so I'm closing this issue for now. Please put your input into the discussion if you have any ideas for how you would like to implement this.\n. This is a good idea, thanks! Closing #132.\n. @alejonext I believe it is working in npm, am i wrong?\n. Done : https://www.npmjs.org/package/ng-cordova\n. Thanks for the PR! Have you tried testing it?\n. Demo has been updated! please take a look.\n. closes #124.\n. Thanks, added a reference to the docs and plugins.\n. Hi @TankMasterRL I hope you were able to resolve this issue. Since it's not really 'on-topic' for ngCordova I'm closing this issue, so that you can resolve this issue on the BarcodeScanner repo\n. I like these edits with promises thanks!\n. I preferred the idea of abstracting the file-transfer plugin from the file plugin so I've done it recently and will be available in v0.1.11-alpha. See 11717fcfb02a3779836c5350cb45d76cbbfcf995\n\nAlso we're working on improving the File plugin to be more robust and option-friendly, more soon.\n. Hi @giomas can you tell me which googlemaps plugin you are using? I'll merge the plugin if its a popular and active plugin! thanks!\n. That looks like a good plugin to include in ngCordova. I'll merge this when I can make sure there are no conflicts. Thanks!\n. Never mind, merging now! :)\n. I'm going to merge this as a starter for future progress. The FB plugin api looks very complicated, but this is a great start!\n. I don't think this is in the plans for the 2.0 release, but we'll keep it in mind!\n. @programming-kid I don't think ngCordova is heading in this direction. Each plugin has their respective uses, and modularizing them is the best way to go I believe.\n. @alarner I couldn't merge this PR due to conflicts, so I had to add it myself. I changed the promises a bit to work with the `$q.defer()` angularjs-style You can check it out at: f54bdc8efc893373b2f421c48022422ac2c28735\n. Looks good to me!\n. @alastairparagas I merged your pull request, it should be working now: https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/154\n. @rbecheras I have one concern about this, mainly that I'm not sure that using the angular `$window` will work with cordova when built and working on a device. Have you verified that this will work in production use on an iPhone / Android? If so, I would gladly like to merge this.\n. @bastiss  I'm not too competent in bower package management, but I'll try to get this fixed soon. I think it may have been fixed tho, if you look at the .bower file, you'll notice that the reference is to 0.1.3-alpha\n. If you check out the updated docs this should be possible now!\n. Good catch, fixed in 3f720f9d25e3c5d9d2a75c5bed2bd7addac54c82.\n. fixing this stale PR with a personal addition: ff91d1285e2843d54b3d71fdee9a0b1da4aa7f3d\n. @perrygovier  I believe this is something that requires your help? Any change I can contribute to it?\n. Moving this to #348.\n. Fixed now, thanks!\n. @SidneyS I couldn't merge this into the master due to conflicts, but I've added the plugin myself, which you can see in : 96f4570e02f06ca868695056adfa26e8b219eabc. Thanks for the great work!\n. @oliversalzburg I believe we're working on a feature to detect when the device is ready on a more global scope, but we will keep this in mind! thanks for the work\n. Hi @voylinux you can contribute using [these guidelines](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), if you need more help, just ask! Closed in 5d8e1e3\n. @kevbaker are you using the custom-build of ngCordova? If so there have been some issues with this before, and I would recommend using either bower or downloading / cloning from the repo\n. Hmm, I'll have to look into this and see what has changed from the various versions of angular. Ideally ngCordova should be supported for any version of angular 1.2.X and up (including the new 1.3.x+). Making a new issue for that.\n. Hey everyone, I've tested ngCordova on all the versions, and everything is working fine. There must be something wrong with your implementation. Have you included `ng-cordova.js` before `cordova.js` in your index.html file?\n\nAlso check out the [Common Issues](http://ngcordova.com/docs/common-issues/) part in the docs for extra help.\n. Ah yes, that is a definite one. The `ionic.bundle.js` is a bundle of `ionic.js` and `angular.js` and since ngCordova **depends completely** on AngularJS is `ionic.bundle.js` **must** come before `ngCordova.js`\n. Duplicate of https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/issues/43\n. Thanks for the idea: done in 5d8e1e3159906180c73784f0517403b4bde50dcb\n. Moving this to #262 \n. hi @radman5 which iBeacon plugin are you referring to? Can you give me a link to the github repo?\n. Thanks @mrzmyr, closing this issue and moving it to #262\n. @mlynch What do you think of this idea + functionality? If ng-cordova were to be more integrated into the Ionic platform / system, we could even include something like:\n\n```\nionic ngcordova ... [setup, install]\n```\n\nOtherwise, this could work well too:\n\n```\nngcordova ... [setup, install, custom-build, mocks, build, etc]\n```\n\nWe could start by creating a new github repo (ng-cordova-cli)\n. @Sjerd I believe this is an issue with the plugin.\n\nLook at this part of the official docs, which gives a detailed reference as to what can be shared for which device, etc:\n\nhttps://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/SocialSharing-PhoneGap-Plugin#4a-usage-on-ios-and-android\n. Good stuff, thanks @zdenal \n. I like the idea of ngAnnotate, but I'd rather stick with a more consistent way of dependency injection. \n. We're working on making ng-cordova mocks a reality as you can see in #15. Once that's done, we will build up the test files, and hopefully have everything running smoothly:)\nIf you have any ideas, feel free to add your comments in the PR and keep the discussion going!\n. Yes, I don't believe it's possible to test cordova plugins, which must be run on a real device, using the standard Karma or Protractor tests. That's why we need mock data to simulate a real device, and allow the mock data to be tested.\n. @mrzmyr ng-cordova now has mocks! If you'd like to contribute to them, start by looking around [src/mocks](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/tree/master/src/mocks)\n. @tylercollier Once you've forked the project, go to the `gh-pages` branch. Next make a clone of the ng-cordova `gh-pages` branch, and create a new branch inside of your own fork, called something like: `Fix-Toast-Plugin`. Make the appropriate changes, and push them back to `Fix-Toast-Plugin`, and push it back to github. Finally make a PR back to ng-cordova, and TADA!\n. @tylercollier Thanks, I've included detailed instructions in the CONTRIBUTION.md page, which is visible when creating a new issue.\n. @rbecheras Becuase I couldn't merge your PR I made the changes myself, thanks for your help and advice! 2ef37733468e85c9ddc0f3787db5518605abbffe\n. hmm, that's strange. Did you by chance download ngCordova via bower? If so, there is a repo called ng-cordova, and may be the reason for this.\n. Ahh that's your problem, you installed the wrong module.\n\nTry `bower install ngCordova`\n. Agreed, good catch. Thanks for the PR\n. @mrzmyr thanks for all the PRs!\n. Added adMob, appAvail, battery, clipboard in 02c3651092b047dc19e3e0c9c2c70c6286685890\n. Hi @TroubadourFabiolas, [check out this demo that I recently made](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/demo/www/app/deviceOrientation/deviceOrientation.ctrl.js).\n\nIt's using the deviceOrientation plugin, but it works exactly the same. I will update the docs promptly though, thanks!\n. Fixed now in 08e77eac0d83949aaaab20b124a74af5217f96a8\n. @toxster I'm not sure I understand what you are saying.\n. I'm going to close this for now, since it's more of an issue with the Barcode Plugin\n. This is not an issue with ngCordova, but rather with the [Barcode Plugin](https://github.com/wildabeast/BarcodeScanner)\n. I do believe it is yes.\n. Yeah that's a good start, editing now.\n. Done in  72e513b\n. @mrzmyr I'm sorry I can't merge this, I wish I could. While on the plane I made a bunch of edits, and added the Keyboard and Printer plugins to the docs.\n\nCould you make a new PR for the Preferences and SMS plugin?\n. I like this, thanks!\n. @shepherdsiduli if you can find the pdf scanner plugin, we will try to add it shortly!\n. @mrzmyr could you make a new PR again? Sorry to make you go through the fuss, but I guess that's one of the hassles of managing a growing project\n. @pellekrogholt could you make a PR for the datePicker plugin and we'll try to add it to the docs too!\n. Merged via https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/226, thanks for the demo too!\n. hmm, try pulling from the ng-cordova gh-pages branch again, and then make your changes, and then a PR request.\n. We're working on implementing the \"deviceready\" event into each plugin to check if cordova has fully loaded. For the other part of your question regarding a check if the plugin has installed successfully, I'm not sure that really belongs in this project. Usually there should be no issues with installing a plugin if you use the Cordova CLI correctly, since the CLI takes care of this for you.\n\nYou can check out #386 in the mean time and add your thoughts there.\n. Yes, we prefer to use promises in ngCordova, rather than callbacks.\n. @mrzmyr is right, duplicate of #176\n. Thanks, but it's already in the docs!\n. Thanks, but it's already in the docs!\n. I want to merge this, and agree with you 100%, but I'm going to refractor the whole Facebook plugin soon, and this will definitely break things for past users.\n. I'm going to merge this for now, since the FB plugin isn't officially supported by ngCordova.\n. Yes, this looks great! Thanks @mrzmyr \n. Yes definitely, promises are better. And keeping with uniformity it's good to make each plugin function similarly\n. The Date Picker plugin was only added a few days ago, so I don't think it will be breaking too many projects. Let's go ahead and include it in the upcoming release\n. @mrzmyr sorry to revert your PR, but I had to in order to get the other PR's through since they were unmerge-able. This is great work though, you're a powerhouse for the ngCordova project:)\n. Closing this for now, since a new issue has been made #263 \n. @ScreenDriver which `$cordovaFile` method are you referring to exactly? Want to post some example code or make a PR and we can discuss it more.\n. The file plugin has been updated to use resolveLocalFileSystemURL (in the master), so read/write/copy/move methods can use the various FileSystem `cordova.file.*` objects. Docs show changes too. Hopefully that fixes your issues.\n. @ScreenDriver I see what you mean, but I'm not totally sure we can do this. If I understand bower `main`, we should allow the user to choose between the `.min` and `.js` files depending on development / debugging and production use. I'll look into this more, since Bower docs are a bit fuzzy here.\n\nIf you could point me out to a good explanation of the `main` part of bower, it would help make this decision a lot easier\n. @rastographics perfect, that's exactly what I needed to determine this issue.\n. @parsonsmatt I don't believe anyone has started it yet, so go ahead and make a PR!\n. I think everything should work fine with .12 so I'm merging, thanks!\n. Done! woot  ac18df1d156f38a35e418464e10b60b4e42b3b3a ac18df1d156f38a35e418464e10b60b4e42b3b3a\n. @PavelPolyakov good catch.\n\nIf you'd like to fix the errors youself you can always look at the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines, and make a PR with the fixes on the gh-pages branch.\n. @dularion Your problem lies with adding the plugin to cordova. Since your error message indicates that the plugin files are missing when you compile and run your application, you may want to rebuild your app completely:\n\n``` bash\ncordova platform rm ios\ncordova platform add ios\ncordova build ios\ncordova emulate ios\n```\n\nI'm also going to close this issue because it does not pertain to ng-cordova directly. Perhaps create an issue at the creator of the plugin.\n. @mrzmyr I understand the coverage now. I'll merge this since we're still working on building up testing, but I gotta look into it more (still very amateur at uni-testing) \n. @mrzmyr I agree on ignorning the `bower_componenets`, but not too sure what the `coverage` files are.\n. Yesss, I was about to do this, but you beat me to it. thanks @mrzmyr\n. Closing this for now since I'm making a list in #262 for the upcoming v0.1.5 release\n. @zarko-tg this is merged and in the docs now!\n. @mrzmyr Great stuff, merging now.\n. I'd like to do this, I'm just worried about overbloating the ng-cordova source code when used for final production. If we do it for the Dialogs plugin, why not do it for every plugin, and then we end up with a very large ng-cordova.js file.\n\nThat's why we're working on [ng-cordova-mocks](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/tree/master/src/mocks). More to come in that part soon, with docs and all!\n. This has now been included in ngCordova 90ae16cac99ee8b16c8776f756efd0a757e2be15. My thinking is that the fallback for web dev is very easy, and worth implementing\n. @MGMsystems is this in the docs or the sourcecode?\n. Done a56e21f6880d8a3536383343030dc687743e2e1a\n. @zarko-tg I feel like the File plugin has the same functionality as the File Transfer plugin, so it may be overkill having them both.\n. @mrzmyr I think we should keep source code as clean and lean as possible. But yes, the File plugin requires some more testing and better docs thereafter. I'm boggled down at the moment, but I'll try to get it in for v0.1.5 release in a few weeks.\n. @mackbrowne Can you give me some details about your environment:\n- How did you install ngCordova (bower / zip file)\n- Did you use custom build? There have been some known issues with that recently\n\nAlso can you give me the specific error message that you get\n. @mackbrowne good to hear. One thing: did you download from bower recently (in the last 2 weeks or so) ? And did it give you the wrong version inside that download?\n. Yes, perfect. AngularJS ftw. Gotta change the docs for this\n. Great stuff, its good to keep with angularjs promises. I'll have to make doc fixes soon\n. @mrzmyr I'm not sure why, but I thought I merged this PR and now it's showing that I closed it and didn't merge it. I'm sorry for the hassle but could you make a new PR? Or I could copy your code into the repo myself.\n. Fixed now ea6766fc67d4f713e065dcce2a045d52fd625547\n. @mzbyszynski Iike a lot of these changes! The main issue is with your PR though. I can no longer merge it, most likely because you have made a lot of (great) changes, but all into one big PR. I would be happy to merge these changes in, if you could break them down into smaller PR's, where we can cherry pick the changes that we believe best suit ngCordova.\n. This was just added: cc94d53cd55c3d27d15560a1d49c8ffea89401b8\n. moving this to #348\n. The File plugin has been overhauled. See the docs for more info, but it's much more expandable now.\n. Yes you're very right about this! Thanks for catching this.\n. Okay I like this, gotta fix the docs soon then.\n. Fixed\n. Awesome! thanks @mrzmyr \n. agreed, will do this soon.\n. @mzbyszynski  I'm going to have to test all of these new methods out, but how sure are you about their functionality? Also great stuff!\n. Awesome, I like to test out all the plugins by adding them to the demo folder of ng-cordova, so others can understand how to implement it with a working version\n. done http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/media/\n. @Leftyx usually you can resolve this issue inside of the CLI, where it should prompt you about which angularJS version you would like to use.\n. @Leftyx so is your issue resolved?\n. @gruppjo I believe this was fixed recently, but I'm guessing it's not yet implemented because the changes were made after the v0.1.4-alpha release.\n. As you can see I was planning on releasing [v0.1.5-alpha](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/milestones/v0.1.5-alpha) in the upcoming week or two, with plans to get the FB plugin working, and add a the remaining plugins to the docs. I believe you can get the master version from bower though?\n. @simoneb I think this is now fixed as of d599892b316dbef66a22d2c94e5f131ee187b1ac\n. Adding this to https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/issues/262\n. @perrygovier Any chance you have the time to look into this? Otherwise I'd be happy to make the changes on my side (just need login info).\n. adnbsr is right, the docs have an example + details\n. The docs have been updated to reflect the most recent changes. There are also more specific examples for both iOS and Android. Hope that helps!\n. http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/pushNotifications/\n. Fixed now\n. I'm going to close this since ngCordovaMocks have been created and are on the way to make this happen.\n. Thanks @huttj, just made the correction f9f3008651a9ee3acbe4054a7633b5a31cfc7d03\n. As you can see in the [official docs](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-camera/blob/master/doc/index.md#android-quirks-1) the Android camera api only allows you to use the back-facing camera:\n\n`Any cameraDirection value results in a back-facing photo.`\n. @mzbyszynski I've had several issues with PhantomJS 1.9 as well, and really hope they are resolved in the 2.0 release. For now we can leave it as it but I'm making a new issue https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/issues/359, which we can resolve soon.\n. Moving this to the progress indicator plugin repo\n. @EdL I misread your comments, and made the appropriate changes: fffee62dc932cb6ece6842c833d8f02eb0fcb6be\n\nBefore:\n\n```\n$cordovaProgress.showSuccess(true)\n```\n\nNow:\n\n```\n$cordovaProgress.showSuccess(true, \"Success, well done!\")\n```\n. Fixed now in the progress indicator plugin\n. Fixed now in the `/src` file: the official name (in both docs and plugin file) is `$cordovaProgress` 2200db12cbc3c54cd4b10298e7ec2765924fa057\n. Fix now.\n. You're right in saying that ngCordova should use the admob-pro plugin, will be added and corrected soon.\n. Closing this and moving it #262.\n. Looks great to me!\n. Looks good to me, thanks!\n. Are you wrapping the plugin call inside the `deviceready` event?\n\ntry:\n\n```\ndocument.addEventListener(\"deviceready\", function () {\n  $cordovaPlugin.someFunction().then(success, error);\n}, false);\n\n// OR with Ionic\n\n$ionicPlatform.ready(function() {\n  $cordovaPlugin.someFunction().then(success, error);\n});\n```\n. @ace68723 Thanks for that discovery, fixed now in the `master`\n. Are you developing inside of your browser or on your iPhone/Android? If you install the latest version of ngCordova (from the master github), we've added support for the Dialogs plugin for browser development. \n. @soic-iupui It's strange that the `$ionicPlatform.ready` event is not working for you, maybe you should create an issue on the Ionic repo. We're working on a way of checking for each plugin that the `deviceready` event is true before the plugin can be used. Check out #386 in the mean time.\n. @benleb We'd be happy to have this in ngCordova. If you have the time and would like to add it yourself via a Pull Request you can check out the [CONTRIBUTING guidelines](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n. Done 7540bf21d3f8c031c8f0289c75996d338c6e70e7\n. You can't use cordova plugins through your browser, or through the phonegap app, which neither gives you access to cordova plugins. You have to either try it on the simulator or on your actual phone\n. Yes, duplicated of #338, this has been fixed but not showing up as a fix because the latest version of ngCordova has not been released yet.\n. Duplicate of #311\n. Should be fixed now http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/media/\n. Thanks @vool. The media plugin is going to be updated soon, since the current implementation is not working.\n. This is most likely due to the fact that when you change views, your controller closes and you cannot access the `position.coords.latitude` values. You could try putting this function inside your main controller, and then use a `$rootScope.$emit` (http://toddmotto.com/all-about-angulars-emit-broadcast-on-publish-subscribing/) to call an action.\n. @revolunet thanks for the PR, unfortunately it's no longer merge-able into ngCordova, do you mind making a new PR?\n. Done\n. Done\n. great stuff thanks @mrzmyr \n. Have you checked to see if the cordova is ready using the \"deviceready\" event? check out http://docs.phonegap.com/en/3.5.0/cordova_events_events.md.html#deviceready\n. @ivanbtrujillo  good to hear! We're working on including the \"deviceready\" feature into ngCordova so that it checks it automatically if the device is ready. WIP @ #386 \n. Done 69fe14ff861f6c8bc95f4e11d1c5ebc735f7d8cd\n. We could possibly inject the ngCordova-mocks if `$cordova.ready()` resolves to false\n. Also referring to #8 for comments\n. Fix now, thanks @mzbyszynski \n. Yes, this is a much better implementation of the facebook provider. I'll get going on the docs to account for this change.\n. @perrygovier Do you think you could help on this?\n. This is a duplicate of #376, trying to fix this issue soon.\n. Thanks for the notice, fixed in the docs now!\n. Great stuff, I'll make the changes in the docs soon\n. Done\n. Thats a good idea, I'll include something soon. Maybe some icons like this: http://gowebmo.com/images/frontend/supported-platforms.png\n. Done 865544f287b703e611908cec9d074f5deec74bf8\n. Try including the sqlite.js file like this: \n\n```\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"SQLitePlugin.js\"></script>\n```\n. Hi @joshilomas the Spinner Dialog plugin was recently updated (in the `master`), and now you can set an option to allow the user to dismiss it or not.\n\nTry:\n\n```\n$cordovaSpinnerDialog.show(\"title\",\"message\", true);\n```\n. Adding this to #262 \n. This should be fixed in 86d22e61723581226443ebfb9a12142c87ee1ffe #485\n\nFile ref:  https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/backgroundGeolocation.js#L23 \n. Looks good to me thanks!\n. Looks good to me! If you have the time, feel free to update the docs to account for this change\n. Thanks for that edit @mica16, I copied pasted the instructions from the official plugin docs and didn't think to check twice\n. I looked at the white-space deletions and it looks like the line-returns are still intact, so markdown will still parse correctly (i believe). I'm gonna merge this and check if everything is still looking alright.\n. Adding this to #262\n. I see what you're doing here, but I'm not sure it is the 'best-practice' way, even though it does work in all the cases I tested. On the plus side, it would make the dist file smaller in side and easier to read, but on the other hand, its helpful to know when the success/error callback returns a value as a param or not, which is not evident when simplifying promises.\n\n@mlynch what do you think?\n. I still think that it's important to keep promise resolves/rejects standard across all plugins, so I'm going to close this PR. I understand your point, but don't believe it fits with the goals of ngCordova.\n\nThanks for the PR however, it's always good to discus these ideas.\n. Adding this to #262 \n. I've just released a new version of ngCordova. It seems I daftly made changes to the `bower.json` and `package.json` files after I released the latest version. It should be working now and resolve to v0.1.7-alpha\n. @yourbuddyconner I didn't realize but the plugin has recently been update, so you should try this until I have fixed it in ngCordova\n\n```\nwindow.plugin.notification.local.promptForPermission();\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/katzer/cordova-plugin-local-notifications/tree/0.7\n. Yes, please look at the docs:\n\nhttp://ngcordova.com/docs/#BackgroundGeolocation\nhttp://ngcordova.com/docs/#Geolocation\n. Adding this to #262 \n. @machard when you reference _apache/cordova-js@26e3e49_, are you suggesting that putting the `ngcordova.js` file after `cordova.js` is okay?\n\n@netanelgilad I think it's good to maintain the docs as they are. If this helps one out 10 people trying to include ngcordova in their project, it's still useful to keep it in.\n. The Media plugin needs a big overhaul, since it doesn't work well with Angular at the moment. Changes should be made soon tho.\n. Hey @mawarnes I've overhauled the media plugin, and it should work now. The docs are also updated and should reflect the changes. If you have the time to test it do let me know if you find any issues.\n\nhttp://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/media/\n. Done ! cc94d53cd55c3d27d15560a1d49c8ffea89401b8\n. @kapilkarda can you point me to the url of the plugin you want ngCordova to include?\n. Which github repo are you talking about? Can you give me the link so that I can take a look at the API\n. Done bb5504ceadc02d361748d94408e6aada1bf47517.\nDocs: http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/imagePicker/\n. Try:\n\n```\n$cordovaFile\n.downloadFile(source, filePath, true)\n.then(function (result) {}, function (err) {},\n function (progress) {\n  if (progress.lengthComputable) {\n      $scope.percentage = (progress.loaded / progress.total);\n  } else {\n      $scope.load++;\n  }\n})\n\n```\n\nAnd other references: http://www.raymondcamden.com/2013/05/01/Using-the-Progress-event-in-PhoneGap-file-transfers\n. Looks good to me. Also +1 for adding tests. Thanks @Foxandxss \n. This couldn't be merged, so I fixed it in ngCordova 0c74f364c209d1725b53af6d28f81d60bc05d233. Thanks!\n. @mobidev111 You're right, and this should be an option. I don't want to break the current way of taking a picture, so maybe a new method with `$cordovaCamera.getPictureWithPopover()` would work? \n. @ybian Thanks for raising this issue. The Zip plugin was submitted through a PR and I hadn't checked to see if it was fully functional. It appears the zip plugin was missing in the `module.js` file, and therefore was not being injected as a dependency in the project. I've corrected it now 7f5a7eebd800540ed7625f43531c5acd83e28baf, so if you download the `master` the plugin should be working. (Also please note that `ionic serve` will not work when using ng-cordova, because you are running your app in your browser, which doesn't have access to any of the plugins that are in your phone.)\n. @khashayar  thanks for the PR, you're missing one thing however. To inject this plugin as a dependency in ng-cordova you need to add it to the `module.js` file in the plugins folder (`src` > `plugins` > `module.js`) If you can make this change I'll accept the PR.\n. Thanks @khashayar. Another few questions: Have you tested the plugin to ensure that it works? And if so do you have any code that you could provide for the docs and the demo app?\n. Adding this to #262\n. Great stuff, give me some time to look through your code and I will most likely merge this PR. Thanks!\n. If you edit your branch with which you submitted the PR with a new commit it will maintain this PR and the changes will be kept, or you can create a new one if you please.\n. @bend0303 The network plugin (like all other cordova plugins), only works when testing on a mobile device running your app. There is currently no browser API to obtain network information, so this will not work. Are you testing in your browser or on your mobile device?\n. I've just tested the network information (+ added two new methods: `watchOnline()`, `watchOffline()`) and both are working without problems.\n\nTake a look at the demo app inside ngCordova for a reference.\n. Could you refer a browser API for obtaining networking information? As far as I can tell there is only an API for firefox, which is not adequate enough to include in ng-cordova.\n. Closing this as I couldn't find any concrete API for network information as stale issue.\n. @floatinghotpot Could you give me a detailed overview of which plugins are completely free to use and which require payment? ngCordova is an open-source project with open-sourced plugins, and we would like to maintain a consistency and commitment to this development model, and therefore don't think shareware belongs in this project.\n\n@mlynch what do you think?\n. I've had issues with using the FB plugin in my app development too. Sometimes it's necessary to include the FacebookConnectPlugin.js file in your `index.html`, as well as include this script, which injects the Facebook Javascript SDK into your app.\n\n```\n<script>\n      window.fbAsyncInit = function() {\n        FB.init({\n          appId      : 'your-app-id',\n          xfbml      : true,\n          version    : 'v2.1'\n        });\n      };\n\n      (function(d, s, id){\n         var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n         if (d.getElementById(id)) {return;}\n         js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;\n         js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js\";\n         fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);\n       }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));\n    </script>\n```\n\nLet me know if that fixes it for you?\n. Ah I realized why including just the `facebookConnectPlugin.js` script did not work previously for me: You have to include `<div id=\"fb-root\"></div>` inside of your index file ([see line in `facebookConnectPlugin.js`](https://github.com/Wizcorp/phonegap-facebook-plugin/blob/master/www/index.html#L43)).\n\nI think I've made it clear what is necessary inside of the [ngCordova Facebook docs](http://ngcordova.com/docs/#Facebook), but if you have anything that you'd like to add please submit a PR and help the community!\n. @maggialejandro also note that if testing in your browser you'll have to add your `http://localhost:8100/` url to the accepted `site URLs` inside of the Facebook Developer portal. The page to configure these settings can be found at at https://developers.facebook.com/apps/{Your App ID}/settings/.\n. The first time your user logins into your app (`$cordovaFacebook.login()`) you'll have to put in **all** of the permissions you require for your app. The modal will open asking the user to allow FB to be used in your app (you can't get around this).\n\nAfter that your app will be _forever_ logged into facebook. If your user closes your app and then reopens it, you should check if the user is currently logged (`$cordovaFacebook.getLoginStatus()`) in **before** asking to login (which is not necessary if `getLoginStatus` results in `true`). That way the modal never pops up again.\n\nThen to call the `api`, make sure that the permissions are `= []`, so that the modal doesn't come up again. If you need extra permissions that you did not include in the login, then you'll have to include them in the `api` call, and it will bring up the modal again.\n\nDoes that help explain a few things?\n. @felquis  I may have misunderstood your question, but yes the iOS app works natively (as explained in my previous comment).\n. That's strange, maybe it's an issue with the Facebook Connect plugin and the iPad? I would create an issue on the [github plugin](https://github.com/Wizcorp/phonegap-facebook-plugin) and see what the owner has to say about it. It might be that you have to remove the browser SDK to allow the iOS plugin to take action and do it natively? Can you do it on an iPhone and verify that it works with the code that you havE?\n. Can you checkout my comment in https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/issues/505#issuecomment-68639466 (#505)\n. Also, instead of checking:\n\n```\nif (cordova.browser = ...)\n```\n\ndo\n\n```\nif (!window.cordova)\n```\n. @jlstr I didn't notice that the `if (cordova.browser = ...)` is part of the [wizcorp facebook plugin in line 12](https://github.com/Wizcorp/phonegap-facebook-plugin/blob/master/facebookConnectPlugin.js#L12). This is a huge error in the FB plugin, since cordova is **obviously** undefined in the browser.\n\nI've just made this PR https://github.com/Wizcorp/phonegap-facebook-plugin/pull/880 which hopefully will go through and fix this issue.\n\nIn the mean time use `(!window.cordova)` rather than `if (cordova.browser = ...)`.\n. @cquartier I agree with your reasoning. I've looking into when the digest is called inside an app, and apparently if it called outside (eg: in cordova) then you must call the `$apply()` function to trigger a new digest.\n\nI've seen a few cases where it's good to check if a digest cycle is in process (sec [angular.js repo](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/src/ng/http.js#L1061)):\n\n```\nif (!$rootScope.$$phase) $rootScope.$apply();\n```\n\nBut I've also read this:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22346990/why-is-using-ifscope-phase-scope-apply-an-anti-pattern.\n\nI'll have to look into this more, but for now this is a working fix, thanks.\n. Also I'm thinking of adding a new function to the `$cordovaPush` plugin, like:\n\n```\nreturn {\n  listenNotificationReceived: function() {\n    q = $q.defer();\n    $rootScope.$on(\"pushNotificationReceived\", function() {\n      q.resolve();\n    });\n\n    return q.promise;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nwhich would erase the need to do\n\n```\n $scope.$on('pushNotificationReceived', function(event, notification) {\n    $scope.messageArray.push(notification.payload);\n  });\n```\n. @cquartier `$apply()` is adequate in this situation.\n\nYou might be right about the promise resolving only once when the `$rootScope.$on(...)` event is fired.\n\nIn fact a promise doesn't make sense here at all. Promises are meant for an asynchronous event, whereas with `$broadcast`, the `$on` event is fired and the resulting function is immediately called right after. Therefore the only solution for this would be a callback:\n\n```\nreturn {\n  listenNotificationReceived: function(callback) {\n    $rootScope.$on(\"pushNotificationReceived\", callback());\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd usage:\n\n```\nmyApp.controller(function($scope, $pushPlugin) {\n  $scope.myArr = [];\n\n  $pushPlugin.listenNotificationReceived(function () {\n    // do something now that the notification has been received\n  })\n});\n```\n. Looks good to me thanks @aradnom. The docs on the official website are misleading because the plugin currently has two branches. may be good to note on the docs that this is the case.\n. It's a good start, but a few things are missing I think. Thanks @shalotelli \n. Looks good to me, thanks @floatinghotpot \n. Closing this issue and moving it to #348. I'll try to get this fixed soon.\n. Great stuff @nraboy \n. Good Implementation @jonlil, I like the way you set default options. Thanks for the PR!\n\nAnd re: _Should I also build dist files?_, we prefer PRs to not be dist-built, which makes it easier to merge.\n. I'm afraid I can't change the functionality of the Camera or BarcodeScanner plugin, so you'll have to submit an issue to the respective repos themselves. \n. @mrzmyr is correct. Try `bower install ngCordova#master`\n. I think jsDoc may be the best way going forward to add solid documentation to the [ngCordova docs](http://ngcordova.com/docs/). Do you know if the creates a bigger/ larger size (memory wise) when compiling into the dist folder?\n. @Stolz  I've made a few changes to the bluetooth serial plugin  941f39fba177bd1a819c497ee3346d4258b836cb, see if that fixes your problems? Also note that `connectInsecure()` doesn't work on iOS (according to the docs). \n. Shoot, thanks for pointing that out. I forgot to delete a plugin injection, fixed in f4725d8c5d5daaea6100e08a1d80a39226e7121e. I tested it and should be working now\n. Yes, it was put in after the 0.1.7 release, try `bower install ngCordova#master`\n. Thanks, fixed in 2b29727a1116dd7fdb364ff38ac92f9a56cf2b78\n. @aplatanado Your fix is definitely correct. Before I merge your PR, do you think you could correct the `$cordovaPreferences` test so that the build succeeds?\n. Great stuff, thanks @aplatanado \n. It's currently not supported by ngCordova, but if you can link me the plugin on github or submit a PR we can add it to ngCordova.\n. Hi @wootwoot1234, the email composer already exists through the [social sharing plugin](http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/socialSharing/) api, but it might be a good idea to add this too and let the developers decide which one they want to use. What do you think?\n. This is the perfect place (and the only one really) to post an error like this. Thanks for pointing it out, fixed in 0899f38e2d56bbd109900f4359da61f39e2163d7\n. It's tricky to know which is the best plugin to include, since there are 6 + available in github.\n\nI'm inclined to switch to this one https://github.com/apla/me.apla.cordova.app-preferences, since it appears to be still maintained (last commit, one month ago). Needs more looking into, but any thoughts on switching to this one?\n. @inexion Many plugins don't work on the simulator alone. You have to test the demo app on your **actual iPhone**. See if that fixes it?\n. @inexion I've got the demo build working on my iPhone 6. Try this:\n\n```\ncd demo\nbash init.sh\ncordova platform add ios\ncordova build ios\n```\n\nThat should get your project working.\n. @chocho01 It seems you have mistakenly submitted a PR merging ngCordova's `master` branch into `WIP-cordovaready-new`. If you could please submit your changes from your branch into the ngCordova `master` that would be great.\n. Looks goood to me!\n. Seems like a reasonable fix to me.\n. Can you checkout some of the \"Common Issues\" on the docs page: http://ngcordova.com/docs/ and let me know if that fixes anything?\n\nDon't forget to wrap the `$cordovaBackgroundGeolocation` in a `deviceready` event like:\n\n```\ndocument.addEventListener(\"deviceready\", function () {\n  $cordovaPlugin.someFunction().then(success, error);\n}, false);\n\n// OR with Ionic\n\n$ionicPlatform.ready(function() {\n  $cordovaPlugin.someFunction().then(success, error);\n});\n```\n. Ah, good to know. Maybe I should be more specific in the docs. Closing this then :)\n. @mab9824 I have agree with you on that, I've tried making the contrast higher in the past, but it's still not optimal. \n\nI'm working on a complete docs refractor, with a better design and UI, should be up in a few weeks.\n. @mab9824 Please go and check out the _NEW_ docs: [ngcordova.com/docs](http://ngcordova.com/docs/). Enjoy!\n. Looks great to me. @floatinghotpot Have you open sourced these plugins?\n. I believe #490 fixed this issue, so closing this for now unless the issue is still coming up.\n. I don't think this structure is in the roadmap for ngCordova. I understand why you want to only have a few plugins, and that's why we built the custom-build tool, but having each plugin as a subtree is not very ideal for development or production use.\n\nIn the end the `ngcordova.min.js` file is only 68kb, which is very small for a Cordova mobile app, so I wouldn't worry too much about including the whole file in your project.\n. @mica16 Can you take a look at the [demo example of the Facebook plugin](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/tree/master/demo/www/app/facebook)? (also make sure to look at the `.run()` Angular method, which sets the FB ID for web development\n\n```\nif (!window.cordova) {\n      var appID = 1234567890;\n      var version = \"v2.0\"; // or leave blank and default is v2.0\n      $cordovaFacebookProvider.setAppID(appID, version);\n    }\n```\n\nI've got it working on my iPhone (iOS 8) and on the web dev environment.\n. Great stuff, looks good to me.\n. This is a much smarter implementation, great idea. Can you confirm that no issues arise with this method? If so, this implementation should be used for the `$cordovaDeviceMotion` and `$cordovaDeviceOrientation`.\n\nDocs will need to be updated accordingly\n. @gdi2290 noticed a mistake: the variable `watchID` is not the same throughout. Could you change it all to `watchID` with capitalized `ID`? Should be good to merge after.\n. Awesome! Thanks for the great stuff @gdi2290.\n. You have to wrap the plugin call in:\n\n```\ndocument.addEventListener(\"deviceready\", function () {\n  $cordovaPlugin.someFunction().then(success, error);\n}, false);\n\n// OR with Ionic\n\n$ionicPlatform.ready(function() {\n  $cordovaPlugin.someFunction().then(success, error);\n});\n```\n. What registration ID are you talking about? is it for iOS or Android?\n\nCheck out the [docs for the push plugin](http://ngcordova.com/docs/#Push).\n. @nraboy any ideas here? I haven't used the OAuth plugin extensively so can't answer this at the moment.\n. +1\n. Merged #526 and fixed.\n. Seems harmless to me. Thanks for the PR, will merge if Travis CI build passes.\n. @jrodenbostel Thanks for the PR, but since the File Transfer plugin was completely refactored I ended up adding this small fix in myself!\n. Try to wrap the plugin call in:\n\n```\ndocument.addEventListener(\"deviceready\", function () {\n  $cordovaPlugin.someFunction().then(success, error);\n}, false);\n\n// OR with Ionic\n\n$ionicPlatform.ready(function() {\n  $cordovaPlugin.someFunction().then(success, error);\n});\n```\n. This seems like a problem with the plugin itself and not ngCordova, which is out of the scope of this project, so I'm going to close this issues and ask that you post a new issue at the plugin's repo: https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser. Thanks for raising the issue.\n. You may have to create an Apache account and submit it at this page: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB/component/12320641/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:component-summary-panel\n. Shoot, good catch.\n. @saimon24 This was fixed in 8baad5c84852733edf2e1f0688801e159de26b9a right? I think i can close this now.\n. I see what you mean, and your comments actually showed me that calling `init()` inside the login method is not the right way to implement the FB plugin.\n\nI've made some changes to the plugin in 64b5aa8036d23dd768a2b47c21e760871feb94dd . I'll make changes to the docs soon. Now to test in the browser, before calling the `login` or `getLoginStatus`, you have to call `$cordovaFacebookProvider.initBrowser(id, version)` in the `config` module of your Angular app.\n. @nandanrao first off install the latest through bower:\n\n```\nbower install ngCordova#master\n```\n\nThat'll give you the latest changes to the FB plugin in ngCordova, and the working implementations that are in [the FB docs](http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/facebook/).\n\nThen you should take a look at the DEMO app inside of ngCordova. It has a working example of the FB plugin. Look at [this source code specifically](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/demo/www/app/app.js#L74).\n\nIf you have more problems you might have to include the FB javascript file yourself like so:\n\n```\n<script>\n    (function (d, s, id) {\n      var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n      if (d.getElementById(id)) {\n        return;\n      }\n      js = d.createElement(s);\n      js.id = id;\n      js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js\";\n      fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);\n    }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));\n  </script>\n\n  <!-- Facebook Plugin copy pasted from the plugin/facebookplugin/js/... for web-dev -->\n  <script src=\"lib/facebookConnectPlugin.js\"></script>\n```\n\nI do both just in case. It's mainly an issue with the implementation by WizCorp which makes the FB plugin. So keep trying and you'll get it.\n\nAlso if you're having problems with getting it to work natively, you'll have to go into the `info-*****.plist` file (for iOS) and add you're app name and app ID. Again I recommend looking into the DEMO folder for a working example.\n. very nice! demos ftw.\n. I've actually implemented a more angular way of receiving theses notifications, see b72ed84417f94342e8f3e485216bbe109c6eb003.\n\nIt's not the best way to do it yet (since you still need to call the each function to start the `$broadcast`, `$on` events, but it's a start.\n\nHave you been able to get local notifications to work? I've tried and have had 0 success\n. Thanks @marcus30, fixed in 6a1ffd75832e285f2f4a7617fec1da9dbdc2718c\n. I've actually implemented a more angular way of receiving theses notifications, see b72ed84417f94342e8f3e485216bbe109c6eb003.\n\nIt's not the best way to do it yet (since you still need to call the each function to start the `$broadcast`, `$on` events, but it's a start.\n\nHave you been able to get local notifications to work? I've tried and have had 0 success\n. Hi @schnti, this is an awesome plugin, but I don't think there is anything that ngCordova can do to improve it's usability. If I understand it correctly, all you have to do it install the plugin, and then link to your app in the `href` attribute.\n\nTake a look at the [plugin's iOS API](https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/Custom-URL-scheme/blob/master/www/ios/LaunchMyApp.js), it's empty. And the [Android API](https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/Custom-URL-scheme/blob/master/www/android/LaunchMyApp.js) only has one public method.\n\nThanks for the suggestion, but I don't think it fits well in ngCordova. If you think otherwise let me know why and I'll be happy to consider it again.\n. @dmackerman Others have noticed that ngCordova doesn't work with Angular 1.3.x, so I'm trying to resolve this issue before bumping up the bower dependency higher (or rather to anything 1.2.x +).\n\nWill get back to you on this.\n. This should be fixed now, and included in the latest release `v0.1.9-alpha`.\n. @nezencreation This is actually not an error in the documentation, but an improvement on the old version of the source code. In `v0.1.8-alpha` the promisification of `$cordovaGeolocation`, `$cordovaDeviceMotion` and `$cordovaDeviceOrientation` was enhanced to make it easier to clear the `watch`.\n\n If you download `v0.1.8-alpha` you'll get the most recent version, and the error that you're incurring should not occur. Also please refer to the docs to make sure that you're implementing it correctly.\n. All methods now use `resolveLocalFileSystemURL` to get the FileSystem. Docs should be helpful\n. Great stuff. I'm going to expand the docs to capture each method + params (like http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/actionSheet/). \n. I've updated the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) with the latest changes. If you want to know more details check out the [Releases](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/releases)\n. Moving this to #528\n. I don't think I can help you here, since this seems to be an issue with the [Camera plugin](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-camera/blob/master/doc/index.md) and not ngCordova. But [the docs](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-camera/blob/master/doc/index.md) suggest this:\n- Set `quality` below 50 to avoid memory errors on some devices.\n. Changes were recently made to the media plugin: f6a4af8c07e5d886e117b0b82190534729d8c5ec\nCheck out the docs to see how it works.\n\nBut you'r right about `MediaStatus`, I'll look into that.\n. @nraboy Could you rebase your PR, because it's currently unmergable?\n. Thanks!\n. @nukenin Why do you propose this fix? I did this so that if facebook has already been initialized, do not init again, whereas your method always inits it.\n. Ah, I must have understood how the `init()` method should be called. If that is true, then there is no need to include the `if` statement, but I'll merge the fix for now.\n. Duplicate of #446\n. @sean-hill check out this discussion : https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/issues/446#issuecomment-69132485\n. I'm working on a better tutorial for both iOS and android, with an example app and nodejs server example too. Expect it in the next week or two.\n. It's a good idea, but not for the ngCordova project. NgCordova wraps pre-made plugins and can't change the plugins themself, so if you could suggest this edit in the form of an issue on the plugin repo itself that would be great.\n. Thank you @EricWVGG  we plan on adding more details to the docs soon, but for now this reference should help:\n\nhttp://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/fileTransfer/\n. Thanks for the suggestion @sunsus, but we opted to use $broadcast events to transmit these messages and events, and I don't think `q.notify` is the right thing to use here.\n\nAlso I've added the `show()` method in a different commit.\n. Thanks, fixed\n. hmm, that's a good point. I'll look into it. I don't like the way the Push Notification plugin handles the `notification` event, so it's a bit tedious to implement.\n. Fix it now. 1cb428af99fbac3c55ef8152a619db6b64f89199\n\nIt check if `ng-app` is available in the body, if not uses `document.body`. Checked it on my iPhone 6 and is working.\n. @JiachenDuan Are you talking about the Facebook plugin? http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/facebook/\n. @JiachenDuan You need the facebook plugin to do that. Since the `$cordovaOAuth` plugin opens a new browser inside of the app, it doesn't have access to a logged-in Facebook account, so the user will have to log in every time through the browser.\n. @JiriChara Have you resolved your issue? Can this issue be closed now?\n. @nraboy Any ideas for this?\n\n@Enkows I think your fix is correct. It seems `browserRef.close();` is being called before the `defferred.resolve()` is fulfilled.\n. +1\n. Working on this at the moment, hope to get it out today.\n\nI'm also refactoring the `getDirectory()` method from `requestFileSystem` --> `resolveLocalFileSystemURL` so that it can be better configured.\n\n@cfjedimaster would have time to comment / test?\n. Done in the latest few commits.\n. Docs coming soon too.\n. @kurtommy Are you using the custom build for ngCordova? There have been known problems with it and I would recommend downloading the entire `dist` file for now.\n. Okay, have you tried some scenarios in the [common issues docs](http://ngcordova.com/docs/common-issues/)? Also make sure `ngcordova.js` is above `cordova.js`\n\n``` html\n<script src=\"lib/ngCordova/dist/ng-cordova.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"cordova.js\"></script>\n```\n\nI am certain that the Toast Plugin is working, so there must be something wrong on your end.\n. Can you make a Pull Request so that other can use this code too?\n. Bower installed these because Ionic uses them as a dependency. And no you don't need these, in theory you can delete them and it won't affect your ionic project.\n. Check out this file : https://github.com/driftyco/ionic/blob/master/bower.json#L50\nIt has the dependencies that you mentioned above. So when you do ANY `bower instal ...` action it will automatically get these dependencies.\n\nIf you project is working in your browser/phone there should be no problem\n. @brunyan I hope that makes it clearer?\n. Done thanks!\n. Quick question, is the `navigator.languages` API available in all browsers? Will IE have troubles with this? (not that IE is a priority for ng-cordova-mocks).\n\nLooks great otherwise.\n. Awesome! Great stuff @calendee \n. Done. Check out https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng-cordova\n. Also added an automatic deploy script to NPM through Travis CI 081a23f493eb8871f1a8789c209026c9b00d4a05\n\nEvery time a new version is released, it will update the npm package automatically.\n. Excellent stuff, thanks you @rubocoptero \n. Thanks for the issue, and you're definitely right. If several push notifications are sent at the same time, the $digest cycle is likely to still be running. Fix in 1cb428af99fbac3c55ef8152a619db6b64f89199\n\nNow uses `$timeout`\n. @ozexpert Can you give me details about your environment?\n- Phone OS\n- ngCordova version\n- the code you're using\n\nI have the `$cordovaContacts.pickContact()` method working on my iPhone (look at the `/demo/www/app/contacts` folder).\n. Good catch. The action sheet also needs to be removed in this file\n. Looks like a good plugin to add, but the repo you linked to is a fork of a more popular and recently updated plugin.\n\nLets use this one instead: https://github.com/domaemon/org.apache.cordova.plugin.tts\n. It's an interesting concept, but I don't think it fits well into ngCordova. PersistenceJS creates its own wrapper for the SQLite plugin, which directly collides with the purpose of ngcordova. You should probably use this as a supplement to ngCordova.\n. Fixed in a5df9db264a72fa7ef10848d93925ab15490cf75\n. You can't catch pending notifications, because it's generally impossible to know when a notification is pending or not. But you can catch when a new notification IS sent from a server. Check out the [Push Notification Docs in ngCordova](http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/pushNotifications/).\n\nBut generally you want to listen for the `notificationReceieved` event like so:\n\n``` javascript\n$rootScope.$on('pushNotificationReceived', function(event, notification) {\n...\n});\n```\n. Thanks @Foxandxss \n. There have been changes made to the InAppBrowser in the `master` branch. What version of ngCordova are you using?\n. I made some changes yesterday that I have tested and are working. Install the `master` branch by:\n\n```\nbower install ngCordova#master\n```\n\n#### Using is like so:\n\n**Set Default Options**\n\n```\n.config(function($cordovaInAppBrowserProvider) {\n  var options = {\n    location : \"no\",\n    toolbar: \"yes\"\n  };\n\n  $cordovaInAppBrowserProvider.setDefaultOptions(options);\n});\n```\n\n**Open the browser in a controller**\n\n```\n.controller(\"SomeCtrl\", function ($cordovaInAppBrowser) {\n\n  var overrideOptions = {\n    location : \"yes\",\n    toolbar: \"yes\"\n  };\n\n  $cordovaInAppBrowser.open('http://ngcordova.com', '_blank', options).then(function () {\n      console.log(\"InAppBrowser opened http://ngcordova.com successfully\");\n   }, function (error) {\n      console.log(\"Error: \" + error);\n   });\n\n  // listen for inappbrowser events\n  $rootScope.$on('$cordovaInAppBrowser:loadstart', function(e, event) {});\n  $rootScope.$on('$cordovaInAppBrowser:loadstop', function(e, event));\n  $rootScope.$on('$cordovaInAppBrowser:loaderror', function(e, event));\n  $rootScope.$on('$cordovaInAppBrowser:exit', function(e, event));\n});\n```\n. You're right, I made a small mistake fixing now.\n. Fix now in the `master` branch: 17668fdd2efcfb624b5bf2fbdb46658e44765085\n. Looks good to me! thanks @nraboy \n. I've never used the Device Motion plugin to detect shakes, and I'm not sure that it would be the right plugin to use. You might want to look at http://plugreg.com/ for a plugin that might help you do this. Or ask a question on the http://forum.ionicframework.com/\n. @Duovili I've found a plugin you want: https://github.com/leecrossley/cordova-plugin-shake-detection\n\nI might have time to add it to ngCordova this afternoon.\n. Can you share some code that you're working with. Also what plugin are you using? It seems you might be using the $cordovaOAuth plugin, you might need to check if it works on WP8.\n. Can you share your code + environment (phone, cordova version, etc)\n\nAnd Checkout http://ngcordova.com/docs/common-issues/\n. You have to wrap each plugin call with \n\n```\ndocument.addEventListener(\"deviceready\", function () {\n  $cordovaPlugin.someFunction().then(success, error);\n}, false);\n```\n. Ahh check out the [official docs](https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/SocialSharing-PhoneGap-Plugin#sharing-directly-to) And look at the `shareViaEmail` example:\n\n``` js\nwindow.plugins.socialsharing.shareViaEmail(\n  'Message', // can contain HTML tags, but support on Android is rather limited\n  'Subject',\n  ['to@person1.com', 'to@person2.com'], // TO: must be null or an array\n  ['cc@person1.com'], // CC: must be null or an array\n  null, // BCC: must be null or an array\n  ['https://www.google.nl/images/srpr/logo4w.png','www/localimage.png'], // FILES: can be null, a string, or an array\n  onSuccess, // called when sharing worked, but also when the user cancelled sharing via email (I've found no way to detect the difference)\n  onError // called when sh*t hits the fan\n);\n```\n\nso with ngCordova it would be \n\n```\n$cordovaSocialSharing\n        .shareViaEmail(message, subject, null, null, null, null)\n```\n\nIf that works for you, I'll make some changes to the ngCordova source file to catch this type of error\n. Good to know. \n. Thanks for the PR @PureSpider but I'd like to keep it as it is.\n. @kurtommy Thanks for the PR, but can you put these mocks into their own files in the `/src/mocks/`, otherwise the next time I build the project it will replace these mocks!\n. That's a strange error, and really should not be occuring. If you look at ngCordova's [bower file](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/bower.json#L11-L12), you'll notice that the `main` and `ignore` are both in there.\n\nI'll look into this.\n. I like your idea and think it would in fact be very beneficial to have **all** cordova plugins registered on both the phonegap + cordova registry.\n\nI've always considered a side project of ngCordova to contain it's own registry, which could be downloaded like:\n\n```\nngCordova add $cordovaFile\nngCordova add $cordovaFacebook\n...\n```\n\nThe main issue with this is that the plugins are officially owned and maintained by their respective creators. This means that it's neither my place to put them into the registry nor is it very efficient for keeping them all up to date on the registry.\n\nBut your idea is good, so I'm going to start some issues on each plugin to get the owner to register them.\n. Thanks for raising that issue! And you're right, tested and fixed: d46d6ae368f4abdc2270621644fc592255aa9c4c\n. Shoot, sorry I just woke up -- mind is slow. How about:\n\n```\nif (angular.element(document.querySelector('[ng-app]')) === undefined) {\n  if (angular.element(document.querySelector('[ng-app]'))) {\n     injector = \"document.querySelector('[ng-app]')\";\n  }\n  else {\n    injector = \"document.body\";\n  }\n```\n. You're right, no point testing if the angular element exists, when we are really determining if the `ng-app` element exists.\n. Should be right now 1522f3d278401c2fe5133fed148a19dd1233465d\n. @Midraks there must be an error in your code somewhere, since ngCordova doesn't break apps (as far as I know). Can you provide your error log\n. Great idea. I'll look into. It will take some time to implement if I can get around to it.\n. I'm adding the `clearWatch` method to the returned promise -- it allows the user to call this function after the promise has been resolved.\n. I've added `copy` and `move` methods, but I'll look into the `rename` method\n. Thanks for the PR @mateuszkocz. A big refactor was done to the File plugin to adjust for this.\n. Looks good to me, thanks @SoEasy \n. This does look better. I had previously assumed that all that was important for the `hasPermission()` method was the resolve/reject clause, but I suppose some devs do want to have the boolean value.\n. @TLmaK0 Yes, yes, yes. This is a great idea! I was planning on overhauling the file plugin completely next week, but this is a great start. The file plugin needs to be more customizable and the `$provider` is definitely the way to go.\n\n**I can't merge it however, since there must be some clashes in your code with the current master of ngCordova**. Can you pull the latest changes from ngCordova, merge them into your local branch and add them to your `TLmaK0:master` branch. Any changes you make there will be automatically put into the PR, so no need to make another PR.\n. That's a great idea, but I'm not sure I have the time to transfer the docs over to Dash, especially when we have our own site. thanks for the idea.\n. @buunguyen hit it on the nail. If you submit a PR -- github will check the unit tests as a last-check too.\n. Maybe try setting the preferences before the customlocale? I'm not sure I can help here -- seems like an issue with the plugin itself.\n. @kapilkarda Can you provide the link for the plugin you want?\n. That's a good idea, I'll get on that. But since the File plugin is now using `window.resolveLocalFileSystemURL`, I'll use this instead:\n\n```\nwindow.resolveLocalFileSystemURL = window.resolveLocalFileSystemURL ||\n                                   window.webkitResolveLocalFileSystemURL\n```\n. Thanks for raising the issue -- can you tell me which function/method you are using/calling? Are you using the OAuth plugin?\n\nI can see why this _might_ happen, but it doesn't make sense in the OAuth plugin.\n. It seems you're using an older version of ngCordova. Please update to the latest: `bower install ngCordova`\n. Yes thats true, but only because it takes time to add plugins to the documentation. Still trying to add them to the docs.\n. Did you solve this error?\n. Okay good to know. Do you think it was an issue with ngCordova, or more with how your configured your dependencies? -- Just want to know in case there is an actual error here.\n. This looks great. Breaks down the POST and GET a lot better.\n\n@nraboy what's your opinion?\n\n@danieljoppi One thing I've noticed is that the `method` value (eg: `post` and `get`) is not capitalized (`POST`, `GET`) -- does this work?\n. I'm going to close this for now. The current solution works, and there isn't a big difference in performance.\n. Thanks for raising the issue. Fixed now!\n. awesome!\n. Thanks for the PR @ldeavila, but we prefer to do `gulp build` on our side of the project as to ensure other PRs don't have a merge problem.\n. Thanks @beauby and sorry for the late reply.\n. Thanks for noticing, fixed now.\n. Thanks for the PR @alexandreetf! can do you two things:\n- Add a comment in the plugin file for `link` and `github`, like for the [other plugins](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/adMob.js#L1-L2)\n- Add `'ngCordova.plugins.insomnia'` to the [module.js](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/module.js) file so that is it actually injected as a dependency.\n. cheers @alexandreetf \n. Look great!\n. Letme know if [your PR for the official plugin](wildabeast/BarcodeScanner#250) gets merged, if so I'd be happy to merge this one!\n. awesome thanks @manzapanza !\n. Thanks for the PRS @DanailMinchev -- I had to check that everything was right before merging it, and I've been short on time lately, so sorry about that!\n. Thanks for the PR @paulogr, but it's missing one thing: can you include the `ngCordova.plugins.googlePlayGame` module as a dependency in the `/plugins/module.js` file?\n. I assume @sfielder closed this because it was resolved?\n. Nice! looks good\n. @agustinf thanks for spotting that, do you mind making a PR with the correct changes?\n. See if this page works: [edit /plugins/pushNotifications](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/edit/gh-pages/docs/plugins/pushNotifications/index.md).\n. :+1: \n. Awesome, thanks @dhallsim \n. I think we would make use of [JSCS](http://jscs.info/) for the formatting issue. I'll look into it!\n. Done. https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/gulpfile.js#L84\n\nUsage:\n\n```\ngulp test\n```\n. Could you try using the _un-minified_ `ng-cordova.js` file, so that I can see exactly where the error is?\n. Awesome stuff @root-io. Thanks a bunch.\n. thanks, fixed aec080702e809033591adcf5f252040b4aeecbea\n. You're right, I shouldve checked earlier about the `$rootScope.$eval()`. Thanks @calendee\n. @francesco-strazzullo thanks for the PR - however would you mind removing the `build` files from this PR? It causes future problems for merging PRs, so we generally ask that a PR only includes the changes  that belong in this feat/fix.\n. @francesco-strazzullo thanks for the PR - however would you mind removing the `build` files from this PR? It causes future problems for merging PRs, so we generally ask that a PR only includes the changes  that belong in this feat/fix.\n. @toddhalfpenny Thanks for the PR! However we ask that you don't build the ngCordova package for a new PR, because it causes problems for merging other PRs in the future. Would you mind only including the fixes/code that your submitted?\n. Thanks for the fix @RangerRick \n. hi @bpietravalle - if you could update the docs with this new method I'd be happy to merge!\n. I added the SQLIte Plugin: https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/31\n\nand the social sharing Plugin: https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/32\n. The Toast plugin is awesome! Add in https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/commit/723d4fa29cae53af09e6c5fffe9f3a88a2124023\n. @camposcristian90 YES you can, look at the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines if you need advice and help making a PR\n. True, closing now\n. A new WIP is happening @ #386. Would love to hear your thoughts and comments\n. Yeah sorry, I'm not the best at git right now, and couldn't figure out how to separate each plugin into its own PR. I'm trying out the Contacts plugin, but it's much more complicated, and lacks documentation in some places.\n. Sure. This plugin is:\nhttps://github.com/wildabeast/BarcodeScanner\n\nAll the plugins + links I added for this project [are in this Issue I made this morning](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/issues/7)\n. This is now complete for the following plugins:\n- Geolocation\n- Device Motion\n- Device Orientation\n. I believe we can close this WIP and PR now, since we've merged a different version of mocks.\n. https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/commit/a0ea18f06309430aa3adf1c862c93ba0bc7ee156\n. Closes: \n[#16](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/issues/16)\n[#18](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/issues/18)\n [#19](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/issues/19)\n. This has been included in the dialogs plugin, take a look at the docs + src files\n. Good Points! I'll let the PR go through and we can make more edits after.\n\nThe [File Plugin](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/3.0.0/cordova_file_file.md.html) has a lot of methods and properties, so it's much more complex than other plugins.\n. @yrezgui  I'm making a [SQLite Plugin](https://github.com/brodysoft/Cordova-SQLitePlugin) if you can help? https://gist.github.com/pbernasconi/ebd1551c8c619fba0a9a\n. I think people do. It's the forth most popular plugin on [PlugReg](http://plugreg.com/plugins).\n\n[This article](http://www.senchatouchdev.com/wordpress/2013/04/19/sencha-touch-clarifying-websql-sqlite-and-how-they-relate-to-sencha-touch/) describes the difference, and I think it's clear that SQLite is better. There is also a lot of demand for it on the forums.\n. @yrezgui I'm a bit confused, you plugin is for [Cordova File Plugin](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/2.4.0/cordova_file_file.md.html) right? but your commit is for saving contacts.\n\nI also just submitted a file plugin\n\nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/29\n. Needs support for [SQLCipher](http://sqlcipher.net/):\n\niOS: [integrating SQLCipher for iOS](http://brodyspark.blogspot.ch/2012/12/integrating-sqlcipher-with.html)\nAndroid: [integrating SQLCipher for Android](http://brodyspark.blogspot.ch/2012/12/using-sqlcipher-for-android-with.html)\n. @MGMsystems I added the note in the docs. https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/issues/50 Thanks for the heads-up. Not sure why it's required, but will do some investigating.\n. I'm going to close this issue for now, since it's been resolved in the docs.\n. Yes I believe it is possible: [Camera Docs](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-camera/blob/master/doc/index.md#options) look at Media Type:\n\n```\nCamera.MediaType = {\n    PICTURE: 0,    // allow selection of still pictures only. DEFAULT. Will return format specified via DestinationType\n    VIDEO: 1,      // allow selection of video only, WILL ALWAYS RETURN FILE_URI\n    ALLMEDIA : 2   // allow selection from all media types\n};\n```\n\nTry passing in your options like:\n\n```\n$cordovaCamera.getPicture({mediaType: 1})\n```\n. Added. https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/47  Should be working, please let me know if there are any issues.\n\nAlso note the different types of options you have to include specific for each device:\nhttps://github.com/phonegap-build/PushPlugin#-plugin-api\n. Try: `bower install ngCordova`\n. Done https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/commit/bb3eb61f8dcf81adf471f3c65d060655322db16a\n. I just added the media plugin: a2355175dcc75a2e55d9beebc72c448dae94fabe\n\nIt requires testing, and more editing. Basic usuage:\n\n```\nvar source = $cordovaMedia.newMedia('file/path/audio.mp3')\n\nvar my_media = source.media;\nvar mediaStatus = source.mediaStatus;\nvar promise = source.promise.then(success, error);\n\n$cordovaMedia.play(my_media);\n$cordovaMedia.stop(my_media);\n$cordovaMedia.seekTo(my_media, 1000); // milliseconds\n$cordovaMedia.startRecord(my_media);\n$cordovaMedia.release(my_media);\n$cordovaMedia.getCurrentPosition(my_media).then(success, error);\n```\n\nI'm not entirely sure that this will work as above, since the media plugin actually uses a `Media Object`, but it's a first effort.\n. I've badly implemented the media plugin, and I know the current solution doesn't work. Stay tuned for an update soon(er-than-later).\n. Good catch, thanks!\n. Thanks for the plugins! Note for future: you have to add `'ngCordova.plugin.<plugin name>` to the module.js in the plugins folder.\n. Also, will this work for your plugins to install them?\n`cordova plugin add https://github.com/Paldom/PinDialog.git`\n`cordova plugin add https://github.com/Paldom/SpinnerDialog.git`\n. Thanks for the helpful notice! https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/commit/952f20a5079ca036400a3d0e19dec82444588234\n. We could deprecate the old plugin (by allowing both plugins to work harmoniously) if possible, and when we release v0.2.0-beta remove it all together.\n. Done, and closing now.\n. Thanks! I fixed it in this commit: https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/commit/0749ab557e138eb17dc3cf9a327fa65c72d9f953\n. Thanks, good catch! Fixed in: https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/commit/74227f9ba3ec8553277a29c18a2cab25e6b9facf\n. Yup, just checked thanks for the fix!\n. @pellekrogholt I can't test on an Android, but have you tried putting the `ng-cordova.js` file before `cordova.js` like:\n\n```\n<script src=\"lib/ngCordova/dist/ng-cordova.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"cordova.js\"></script>\n```\n\n[The docs](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-network-information/blob/master/doc/index.md) don't say anything special about Android, so it may be an issue with installing the plugin.\n\nAlso check out http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15894201/checking-of-internet-connection-of-device-using-phonegap\n. Strange, I have it working on my iPhone using ngCordova. I'm thinking it's an issue with cordova or the plugin, and not ngCordova.\n. @pellekrogholt did you resolve this issue? I think you may have to wrap the network call in a `deviceready` event like : \n\n```\ndocument.addEventListener(\"deviceready\", function () {\n  $cordovaPlugin.someFunction().then(success, error);\n}, false);\n\n// OR with Ionic\n\n$ionicPlatform.ready(function() {\n  $cordovaPlugin.someFunction().then(success, error);\n});\n```\n. @kristianbenoit problem fixed? can I close this issue?\n. Also check out the **Common Issues** in the [docs](http://ngcordova.com/docs/), right after the install paragraph.\n. The Barcode Scanner plugin already does this.\n. Hi @programming-kid thanks for the PR, but I just added the Toast Plugin a few minutes ago! (https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/commit/723d4fa29cae53af09e6c5fffe9f3a88a2124023)\n. I think this issue was caused due to browser use, so I'm closing this as a non-ngCordova issue\n. Great stuff! Thanks for the PR.\n. Thanks!\n. I agree, it's a bit out of place otherwise. Fixed in https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/commit/3bc93c97a89694ecf49a3d49af7514c5ebc421f0\n. They are forthcoming. I just added a few more plugins to the documentation in https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/commit/3bc93c97a89694ecf49a3d49af7514c5ebc421f0 (hope everything is correct!). \n\nAs of now, plugins that are missing in the docs:\n- SQLite\n- Google Analytics (freshly added)\n- Ionic Keyboard \n- Local Notifications\n- Capture (freshly added)\n. @cfjedimaster the globalization plugin has been added to the official docs now! I'm keeping a list of the plugins which still need to be added to the docs: https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/issues/203\n. I'm going to leave this up to the Ionic team @mlynch \nMaybe when ngCordova is a bit more stable and unit-tested, it will be ready for easy downloads.\n. A link to ngCordova has been added to the footer of the Ionic site, but I think it'd be nice to have a download link on the [ngCordova.com](http://ngcordova.com/) home page. Will be done momentarily.\n. Did you call the function?\n\n`var type = $cordovaNetwork.getNetwork();`\n. Thanks for pointing that out. I just fixed it, so should be working now! https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/commit/154eeb142ff538a6e75e4f0091ba8db2e2b90b17\n. Just checked the older documentation, and you're right. thanks for the fix\n. Yes, we're currently working on a way to mock plugin data when the plugin isn't available. Please look at this issue https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/15, and submit any of your thoughts!\n. @yrezgui we've merged ng-cordova-mocks into the /src/ files, take a look at them and let me know what you think! Feel free to contribute more\n. @phaggood This is fantastic! I'm gonna look into the bugs you mentioned and through the code, but thanks for the great work.\n. Thanks for that, I must have copied my own code and forgot to make the appropriate changes.\n. Since the latest updates to the demo files, I think this has been resolved, including some of the other minor changes you made, thanks for the PR though!\n. @pellekrogholt this has now been added to the main plugins, and should be on the ngcordova.com/docs page as well\n. I believe this is now fixed in https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/commit/56d17a826ef1a0cd3fbf32c865ad20c996c30553.\n. I think this is a good call. Thanks.\n. @mrzmyr I just added a changelog in 432e48077bf27fea39882897987b6e6f9e38c2c4 , and will hopefully build an automatic changelog creator (perhaps using grunt and [ajoslin's code](https://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog)). Thanks for the idea\n. @kornatzky have you resolved this issue? If so, I'll close this issue.\n. Thanks for clearing that up @mrzmyr. Since this issue is not directly related to ngCordova, I'm going to close this for now and ask that you refer to the official plugin docs for help.\n. @EddyVerbruggen thanks for the advice, and I like your ideas. I'll be adding a link to each plugin shortly. \n\nAlso please note that the docs have been updated quite a bit since June 21, with deeplinking, sidemenus, and a link to the original plugin + how to install.\n\nIf you'd like to discuss more linking your plugins to the ng-cordova wrapper let me know!\n. Thanks for the plugin!\n. Demand seems to be high for the FB plugin, I'll try and get this done by this weekend! Would love your help for fixes, etc after.\n. The FB plugin has [now been merged into ng-cordova](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/commit/1d363bbfb1c03e9481fc491f4d1aec7067d9aaa1#diff-d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e). I'm not sure it's working yet, but take a look at the [source code](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/1d363bbfb1c03e9481fc491f4d1aec7067d9aaa1/src/plugins/facebookConnect.js).\n. This FB plugin is done! And working (on iOS at least), with an example in the /demo folder! [Check out the docs for examples](http://ngcordova.com/docs/#Facebook) and [the official docs for a successful install](https://github.com/Wizcorp/phonegap-facebook-plugin)\n. @mlynch I started a new WIP-docs-sidemenu branch for this feature. I basically copied the Ionic Sidemenu in the docs, including the JS and CSS. It needs some work, but it's a start and it's working too.\n. Officially merged and done.\n. The docs have been updated to reflect the most recent changes in the Push plugin. http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/pushNotifications/\n\nMake sure to install the **latest** version of ngCordova to get the latest changes.\n. @farconada does this help:\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/14070841/phonegap-open-link-in-browser\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser/blob/master/doc/index.md\n. @morenoh149 if have the time to add the local notification plugins to the docs it would be very welcome! :)\n. Awesome, it's fixed now\n. I like the idea.\n\nThis can easily be done using a `bash` file such as `plugin-install.sh`, something like:\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfunction ap {\n  cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.$1\n}\n\nap camera\nap console\nap contacts\nap device\nap dialogs\nap device-motion\nap device-orientation\nap network-information\nap geolocation\nap file\nap splashscreen\nap statusbar\nap vibration\ncordova plugin add https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-plugins-keyboard\ncordova plugin add https://github.com/wildabeast/BarcodeScanner.git \ncordova plugin add https://github.com/chrisekelley/AppPreferences\ncordova plugin add https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/Flashlight-PhoneGap-Plugin.git\ncordova plugin add https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/Toast-PhoneGap-Plugin.git\n```\n\nref: https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/demo/init.sh\n. It's a nice idea, but I don't think this will be in the future plans for ngCordova. As max said, it makes things very complicated, and is probably overkill. Closing this for now.\n. This is a duplicate of https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/issues/103, but I do agree with you 100% , and it will be implemented soon.\n. To check if cordova / device is ready, you can use\n\n```\ndocument.addEventListener(\"deviceready\", onDeviceReady, false);\n\nfunction onDeviceReady() {\n    // Now safe to use device APIs\n}\n```\n\nCheck out the [Cordova Docs - DeviceReady()](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/3.5.0/cordova_events_events.md.html#deviceready).\n\nWe're trying to implement this into ngCordova, and would welcome any ideas in https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/issues/8\n. Dup of https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/issues/102. Trying to get this work.\n. I just added the Printer Plugin from https://github.com/katzer/cordova-plugin-printer/ in https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/commit/77d433a2f390c05eb2a25e09de001e7bc33831bd. Adding the plugin to the docs would be very helpful if you have the time!\n. I merged a PR today with the google maps plugin mentioned above. https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/commit/bdc09bd8d935aaf9191b7b629fe4ff33a30eadd3 I haven't been able to test it yet, and looking through the code, it definitely requires quite a bit of work.\n\nIf you can help resolve some of its issues, with your past experiences that would be great!  \n. @andrewmcgivery @mrzmyr is correct: it should use `$q.defer()`. I had to add this myself because your PR had conflicts. You can check it out at: f54bdc8efc893373b2f421c48022422ac2c28735.\n\nAlso, the `$customURLScheme` has errors in the code. Do you think you could check it out and make a new PR?\n. @samrods1989 I'm not sure what your question is exactly, but I think whatever problems you may have had, have been resolved in https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/commit/ca9fff78aa985a30b8b44fe8a3cbec0cc1a0271d. Closing this for now, and let me know if you have any other problems\n. This is a good idea, but I'm not entirely sure how to implement this in a factory wrapper. Maybe something as simple as:\n\n```\nwatchIfOnline: function() {\n  var q = $q.defer()\n  $window.addEventListener(\"online\", \n      function () {\n         q.resolve();\n      }, function() {\n         q.reject();\n      });\n   return q.promise;\n}\n```\n\nWhat do you think @jimthedev @Natsu- \n. @jimthedev Just added this to the `master` 3cccfe409b44710e9677a3d9434b3efe346e6379. Use it like so:\n\n```\n$cordovaNetwork.watchOffline(); // start watch\n$cordovaNetwork.watchOnline(); // start watch\n\n$rootScope.$on(\"networkOffline\", function () {\n  alert(\"Device is now Offline!\"); // fires every time offline event is true\n});\n\n$rootScope.$on(\"networkOnline\", function () {\n  alert(\"Device is Online!\"); // fires every time online event is true\n})\n```\n\nIt will be in the docs soon. But check out the demo app (app.js file) for now for an example.\n. The changes were added after the 0.1.9 release (which is the latest), so they are not available through bower yet. v2.0 is around the corner though, and will include the updates to the network plugin\n. @leemannd In theory you should be able to access everything that the position produces. [The docs indicate](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-geolocation/blob/master/doc/index.md) that if you return `position` in the promise:\n\n```\nposition.coords.altitude\nposition.coords.altitudeAccuracy\n```\n\nthose two should be accessible. Maybe it's more of an issue with cordova / the plugin rather than ng-cordova. Let me know if that works.\n. Closing this issues as stale, and hopefully resolved. @leemannd Please open it again if you continue to have this problem.\n. Fixed in 0b30ba153c86977f2b91a1a234de33b3de95b829.\n\n`readFile` is now deprecated (but still works, so as not to break), and the new api for `$cordovaFile` is:\n- `readAsText`\n- `readAsDataURL`\n- `readAsBinaryString`\n- `readAsArrayBuffer`\n. Fixed in #132.\n. The file plugin has been updated to use `resolveLocalFileSystemURL` (in the master). Docs show changes too. Hopefully that fixes your issues.\n. Hi, this is a duplicate of #125, so I'm closing this issue for now. Please put your input into the discussion if you have any ideas for how you would like to implement this.\n. This is a good idea, thanks! Closing #132.\n. @alejonext I believe it is working in npm, am i wrong?\n. Done : https://www.npmjs.org/package/ng-cordova\n. Thanks for the PR! Have you tried testing it?\n. Demo has been updated! please take a look.\n. closes #124.\n. Thanks, added a reference to the docs and plugins.\n. Hi @TankMasterRL I hope you were able to resolve this issue. Since it's not really 'on-topic' for ngCordova I'm closing this issue, so that you can resolve this issue on the BarcodeScanner repo\n. I like these edits with promises thanks!\n. I preferred the idea of abstracting the file-transfer plugin from the file plugin so I've done it recently and will be available in v0.1.11-alpha. See 11717fcfb02a3779836c5350cb45d76cbbfcf995\n\nAlso we're working on improving the File plugin to be more robust and option-friendly, more soon.\n. Hi @giomas can you tell me which googlemaps plugin you are using? I'll merge the plugin if its a popular and active plugin! thanks!\n. That looks like a good plugin to include in ngCordova. I'll merge this when I can make sure there are no conflicts. Thanks!\n. Never mind, merging now! :)\n. I'm going to merge this as a starter for future progress. The FB plugin api looks very complicated, but this is a great start!\n. I don't think this is in the plans for the 2.0 release, but we'll keep it in mind!\n. @programming-kid I don't think ngCordova is heading in this direction. Each plugin has their respective uses, and modularizing them is the best way to go I believe.\n. @alarner I couldn't merge this PR due to conflicts, so I had to add it myself. I changed the promises a bit to work with the `$q.defer()` angularjs-style You can check it out at: f54bdc8efc893373b2f421c48022422ac2c28735\n. Looks good to me!\n. @alastairparagas I merged your pull request, it should be working now: https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/154\n. @rbecheras I have one concern about this, mainly that I'm not sure that using the angular `$window` will work with cordova when built and working on a device. Have you verified that this will work in production use on an iPhone / Android? If so, I would gladly like to merge this.\n. @bastiss  I'm not too competent in bower package management, but I'll try to get this fixed soon. I think it may have been fixed tho, if you look at the .bower file, you'll notice that the reference is to 0.1.3-alpha\n. If you check out the updated docs this should be possible now!\n. Good catch, fixed in 3f720f9d25e3c5d9d2a75c5bed2bd7addac54c82.\n. fixing this stale PR with a personal addition: ff91d1285e2843d54b3d71fdee9a0b1da4aa7f3d\n. @perrygovier  I believe this is something that requires your help? Any change I can contribute to it?\n. Moving this to #348.\n. Fixed now, thanks!\n. @SidneyS I couldn't merge this into the master due to conflicts, but I've added the plugin myself, which you can see in : 96f4570e02f06ca868695056adfa26e8b219eabc. Thanks for the great work!\n. @oliversalzburg I believe we're working on a feature to detect when the device is ready on a more global scope, but we will keep this in mind! thanks for the work\n. Hi @voylinux you can contribute using [these guidelines](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), if you need more help, just ask! Closed in 5d8e1e3\n. @kevbaker are you using the custom-build of ngCordova? If so there have been some issues with this before, and I would recommend using either bower or downloading / cloning from the repo\n. Hmm, I'll have to look into this and see what has changed from the various versions of angular. Ideally ngCordova should be supported for any version of angular 1.2.X and up (including the new 1.3.x+). Making a new issue for that.\n. Hey everyone, I've tested ngCordova on all the versions, and everything is working fine. There must be something wrong with your implementation. Have you included `ng-cordova.js` before `cordova.js` in your index.html file?\n\nAlso check out the [Common Issues](http://ngcordova.com/docs/common-issues/) part in the docs for extra help.\n. Ah yes, that is a definite one. The `ionic.bundle.js` is a bundle of `ionic.js` and `angular.js` and since ngCordova **depends completely** on AngularJS is `ionic.bundle.js` **must** come before `ngCordova.js`\n. Duplicate of https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/issues/43\n. Thanks for the idea: done in 5d8e1e3159906180c73784f0517403b4bde50dcb\n. Moving this to #262 \n. hi @radman5 which iBeacon plugin are you referring to? Can you give me a link to the github repo?\n. Thanks @mrzmyr, closing this issue and moving it to #262\n. @mlynch What do you think of this idea + functionality? If ng-cordova were to be more integrated into the Ionic platform / system, we could even include something like:\n\n```\nionic ngcordova ... [setup, install]\n```\n\nOtherwise, this could work well too:\n\n```\nngcordova ... [setup, install, custom-build, mocks, build, etc]\n```\n\nWe could start by creating a new github repo (ng-cordova-cli)\n. @Sjerd I believe this is an issue with the plugin.\n\nLook at this part of the official docs, which gives a detailed reference as to what can be shared for which device, etc:\n\nhttps://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/SocialSharing-PhoneGap-Plugin#4a-usage-on-ios-and-android\n. Good stuff, thanks @zdenal \n. I like the idea of ngAnnotate, but I'd rather stick with a more consistent way of dependency injection. \n. We're working on making ng-cordova mocks a reality as you can see in #15. Once that's done, we will build up the test files, and hopefully have everything running smoothly:)\nIf you have any ideas, feel free to add your comments in the PR and keep the discussion going!\n. Yes, I don't believe it's possible to test cordova plugins, which must be run on a real device, using the standard Karma or Protractor tests. That's why we need mock data to simulate a real device, and allow the mock data to be tested.\n. @mrzmyr ng-cordova now has mocks! If you'd like to contribute to them, start by looking around [src/mocks](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/tree/master/src/mocks)\n. @tylercollier Once you've forked the project, go to the `gh-pages` branch. Next make a clone of the ng-cordova `gh-pages` branch, and create a new branch inside of your own fork, called something like: `Fix-Toast-Plugin`. Make the appropriate changes, and push them back to `Fix-Toast-Plugin`, and push it back to github. Finally make a PR back to ng-cordova, and TADA!\n. @tylercollier Thanks, I've included detailed instructions in the CONTRIBUTION.md page, which is visible when creating a new issue.\n. @rbecheras Becuase I couldn't merge your PR I made the changes myself, thanks for your help and advice! 2ef37733468e85c9ddc0f3787db5518605abbffe\n. hmm, that's strange. Did you by chance download ngCordova via bower? If so, there is a repo called ng-cordova, and may be the reason for this.\n. Ahh that's your problem, you installed the wrong module.\n\nTry `bower install ngCordova`\n. Agreed, good catch. Thanks for the PR\n. @mrzmyr thanks for all the PRs!\n. Added adMob, appAvail, battery, clipboard in 02c3651092b047dc19e3e0c9c2c70c6286685890\n. Hi @TroubadourFabiolas, [check out this demo that I recently made](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/demo/www/app/deviceOrientation/deviceOrientation.ctrl.js).\n\nIt's using the deviceOrientation plugin, but it works exactly the same. I will update the docs promptly though, thanks!\n. Fixed now in 08e77eac0d83949aaaab20b124a74af5217f96a8\n. @toxster I'm not sure I understand what you are saying.\n. I'm going to close this for now, since it's more of an issue with the Barcode Plugin\n. This is not an issue with ngCordova, but rather with the [Barcode Plugin](https://github.com/wildabeast/BarcodeScanner)\n. I do believe it is yes.\n. Yeah that's a good start, editing now.\n. Done in  72e513b\n. @mrzmyr I'm sorry I can't merge this, I wish I could. While on the plane I made a bunch of edits, and added the Keyboard and Printer plugins to the docs.\n\nCould you make a new PR for the Preferences and SMS plugin?\n. I like this, thanks!\n. @shepherdsiduli if you can find the pdf scanner plugin, we will try to add it shortly!\n. @mrzmyr could you make a new PR again? Sorry to make you go through the fuss, but I guess that's one of the hassles of managing a growing project\n. @pellekrogholt could you make a PR for the datePicker plugin and we'll try to add it to the docs too!\n. Merged via https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/226, thanks for the demo too!\n. hmm, try pulling from the ng-cordova gh-pages branch again, and then make your changes, and then a PR request.\n. We're working on implementing the \"deviceready\" event into each plugin to check if cordova has fully loaded. For the other part of your question regarding a check if the plugin has installed successfully, I'm not sure that really belongs in this project. Usually there should be no issues with installing a plugin if you use the Cordova CLI correctly, since the CLI takes care of this for you.\n\nYou can check out #386 in the mean time and add your thoughts there.\n. Yes, we prefer to use promises in ngCordova, rather than callbacks.\n. @mrzmyr is right, duplicate of #176\n. Thanks, but it's already in the docs!\n. Thanks, but it's already in the docs!\n. I want to merge this, and agree with you 100%, but I'm going to refractor the whole Facebook plugin soon, and this will definitely break things for past users.\n. I'm going to merge this for now, since the FB plugin isn't officially supported by ngCordova.\n. Yes, this looks great! Thanks @mrzmyr \n. Yes definitely, promises are better. And keeping with uniformity it's good to make each plugin function similarly\n. The Date Picker plugin was only added a few days ago, so I don't think it will be breaking too many projects. Let's go ahead and include it in the upcoming release\n. @mrzmyr sorry to revert your PR, but I had to in order to get the other PR's through since they were unmerge-able. This is great work though, you're a powerhouse for the ngCordova project:)\n. Closing this for now, since a new issue has been made #263 \n. @ScreenDriver which `$cordovaFile` method are you referring to exactly? Want to post some example code or make a PR and we can discuss it more.\n. The file plugin has been updated to use resolveLocalFileSystemURL (in the master), so read/write/copy/move methods can use the various FileSystem `cordova.file.*` objects. Docs show changes too. Hopefully that fixes your issues.\n. @ScreenDriver I see what you mean, but I'm not totally sure we can do this. If I understand bower `main`, we should allow the user to choose between the `.min` and `.js` files depending on development / debugging and production use. I'll look into this more, since Bower docs are a bit fuzzy here.\n\nIf you could point me out to a good explanation of the `main` part of bower, it would help make this decision a lot easier\n. @rastographics perfect, that's exactly what I needed to determine this issue.\n. @parsonsmatt I don't believe anyone has started it yet, so go ahead and make a PR!\n. I think everything should work fine with .12 so I'm merging, thanks!\n. Done! woot  ac18df1d156f38a35e418464e10b60b4e42b3b3a ac18df1d156f38a35e418464e10b60b4e42b3b3a\n. @PavelPolyakov good catch.\n\nIf you'd like to fix the errors youself you can always look at the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines, and make a PR with the fixes on the gh-pages branch.\n. @dularion Your problem lies with adding the plugin to cordova. Since your error message indicates that the plugin files are missing when you compile and run your application, you may want to rebuild your app completely:\n\n``` bash\ncordova platform rm ios\ncordova platform add ios\ncordova build ios\ncordova emulate ios\n```\n\nI'm also going to close this issue because it does not pertain to ng-cordova directly. Perhaps create an issue at the creator of the plugin.\n. @mrzmyr I understand the coverage now. I'll merge this since we're still working on building up testing, but I gotta look into it more (still very amateur at uni-testing) \n. @mrzmyr I agree on ignorning the `bower_componenets`, but not too sure what the `coverage` files are.\n. Yesss, I was about to do this, but you beat me to it. thanks @mrzmyr\n. Closing this for now since I'm making a list in #262 for the upcoming v0.1.5 release\n. @zarko-tg this is merged and in the docs now!\n. @mrzmyr Great stuff, merging now.\n. I'd like to do this, I'm just worried about overbloating the ng-cordova source code when used for final production. If we do it for the Dialogs plugin, why not do it for every plugin, and then we end up with a very large ng-cordova.js file.\n\nThat's why we're working on [ng-cordova-mocks](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/tree/master/src/mocks). More to come in that part soon, with docs and all!\n. This has now been included in ngCordova 90ae16cac99ee8b16c8776f756efd0a757e2be15. My thinking is that the fallback for web dev is very easy, and worth implementing\n. @MGMsystems is this in the docs or the sourcecode?\n. Done a56e21f6880d8a3536383343030dc687743e2e1a\n. @zarko-tg I feel like the File plugin has the same functionality as the File Transfer plugin, so it may be overkill having them both.\n. @mrzmyr I think we should keep source code as clean and lean as possible. But yes, the File plugin requires some more testing and better docs thereafter. I'm boggled down at the moment, but I'll try to get it in for v0.1.5 release in a few weeks.\n. @mackbrowne Can you give me some details about your environment:\n- How did you install ngCordova (bower / zip file)\n- Did you use custom build? There have been some known issues with that recently\n\nAlso can you give me the specific error message that you get\n. @mackbrowne good to hear. One thing: did you download from bower recently (in the last 2 weeks or so) ? And did it give you the wrong version inside that download?\n. Yes, perfect. AngularJS ftw. Gotta change the docs for this\n. Great stuff, its good to keep with angularjs promises. I'll have to make doc fixes soon\n. @mrzmyr I'm not sure why, but I thought I merged this PR and now it's showing that I closed it and didn't merge it. I'm sorry for the hassle but could you make a new PR? Or I could copy your code into the repo myself.\n. Fixed now ea6766fc67d4f713e065dcce2a045d52fd625547\n. @mzbyszynski Iike a lot of these changes! The main issue is with your PR though. I can no longer merge it, most likely because you have made a lot of (great) changes, but all into one big PR. I would be happy to merge these changes in, if you could break them down into smaller PR's, where we can cherry pick the changes that we believe best suit ngCordova.\n. This was just added: cc94d53cd55c3d27d15560a1d49c8ffea89401b8\n. moving this to #348\n. The File plugin has been overhauled. See the docs for more info, but it's much more expandable now.\n. Yes you're very right about this! Thanks for catching this.\n. Okay I like this, gotta fix the docs soon then.\n. Fixed\n. Awesome! thanks @mrzmyr \n. agreed, will do this soon.\n. @mzbyszynski  I'm going to have to test all of these new methods out, but how sure are you about their functionality? Also great stuff!\n. Awesome, I like to test out all the plugins by adding them to the demo folder of ng-cordova, so others can understand how to implement it with a working version\n. done http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/media/\n. @Leftyx usually you can resolve this issue inside of the CLI, where it should prompt you about which angularJS version you would like to use.\n. @Leftyx so is your issue resolved?\n. @gruppjo I believe this was fixed recently, but I'm guessing it's not yet implemented because the changes were made after the v0.1.4-alpha release.\n. As you can see I was planning on releasing [v0.1.5-alpha](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/milestones/v0.1.5-alpha) in the upcoming week or two, with plans to get the FB plugin working, and add a the remaining plugins to the docs. I believe you can get the master version from bower though?\n. @simoneb I think this is now fixed as of d599892b316dbef66a22d2c94e5f131ee187b1ac\n. Adding this to https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/issues/262\n. @perrygovier Any chance you have the time to look into this? Otherwise I'd be happy to make the changes on my side (just need login info).\n. adnbsr is right, the docs have an example + details\n. The docs have been updated to reflect the most recent changes. There are also more specific examples for both iOS and Android. Hope that helps!\n. http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/pushNotifications/\n. Fixed now\n. I'm going to close this since ngCordovaMocks have been created and are on the way to make this happen.\n. Thanks @huttj, just made the correction f9f3008651a9ee3acbe4054a7633b5a31cfc7d03\n. As you can see in the [official docs](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-camera/blob/master/doc/index.md#android-quirks-1) the Android camera api only allows you to use the back-facing camera:\n\n`Any cameraDirection value results in a back-facing photo.`\n. @mzbyszynski I've had several issues with PhantomJS 1.9 as well, and really hope they are resolved in the 2.0 release. For now we can leave it as it but I'm making a new issue https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/issues/359, which we can resolve soon.\n. Moving this to the progress indicator plugin repo\n. @EdL I misread your comments, and made the appropriate changes: fffee62dc932cb6ece6842c833d8f02eb0fcb6be\n\nBefore:\n\n```\n$cordovaProgress.showSuccess(true)\n```\n\nNow:\n\n```\n$cordovaProgress.showSuccess(true, \"Success, well done!\")\n```\n. Fixed now in the progress indicator plugin\n. Fixed now in the `/src` file: the official name (in both docs and plugin file) is `$cordovaProgress` 2200db12cbc3c54cd4b10298e7ec2765924fa057\n. Fix now.\n. You're right in saying that ngCordova should use the admob-pro plugin, will be added and corrected soon.\n. Closing this and moving it #262.\n. Looks great to me!\n. Looks good to me, thanks!\n. Are you wrapping the plugin call inside the `deviceready` event?\n\ntry:\n\n```\ndocument.addEventListener(\"deviceready\", function () {\n  $cordovaPlugin.someFunction().then(success, error);\n}, false);\n\n// OR with Ionic\n\n$ionicPlatform.ready(function() {\n  $cordovaPlugin.someFunction().then(success, error);\n});\n```\n. @ace68723 Thanks for that discovery, fixed now in the `master`\n. Are you developing inside of your browser or on your iPhone/Android? If you install the latest version of ngCordova (from the master github), we've added support for the Dialogs plugin for browser development. \n. @soic-iupui It's strange that the `$ionicPlatform.ready` event is not working for you, maybe you should create an issue on the Ionic repo. We're working on a way of checking for each plugin that the `deviceready` event is true before the plugin can be used. Check out #386 in the mean time.\n. @benleb We'd be happy to have this in ngCordova. If you have the time and would like to add it yourself via a Pull Request you can check out the [CONTRIBUTING guidelines](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n. Done 7540bf21d3f8c031c8f0289c75996d338c6e70e7\n. You can't use cordova plugins through your browser, or through the phonegap app, which neither gives you access to cordova plugins. You have to either try it on the simulator or on your actual phone\n. Yes, duplicated of #338, this has been fixed but not showing up as a fix because the latest version of ngCordova has not been released yet.\n. Duplicate of #311\n. Should be fixed now http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/media/\n. Thanks @vool. The media plugin is going to be updated soon, since the current implementation is not working.\n. This is most likely due to the fact that when you change views, your controller closes and you cannot access the `position.coords.latitude` values. You could try putting this function inside your main controller, and then use a `$rootScope.$emit` (http://toddmotto.com/all-about-angulars-emit-broadcast-on-publish-subscribing/) to call an action.\n. @revolunet thanks for the PR, unfortunately it's no longer merge-able into ngCordova, do you mind making a new PR?\n. Done\n. Done\n. great stuff thanks @mrzmyr \n. Have you checked to see if the cordova is ready using the \"deviceready\" event? check out http://docs.phonegap.com/en/3.5.0/cordova_events_events.md.html#deviceready\n. @ivanbtrujillo  good to hear! We're working on including the \"deviceready\" feature into ngCordova so that it checks it automatically if the device is ready. WIP @ #386 \n. Done 69fe14ff861f6c8bc95f4e11d1c5ebc735f7d8cd\n. We could possibly inject the ngCordova-mocks if `$cordova.ready()` resolves to false\n. Also referring to #8 for comments\n. Fix now, thanks @mzbyszynski \n. Yes, this is a much better implementation of the facebook provider. I'll get going on the docs to account for this change.\n. @perrygovier Do you think you could help on this?\n. This is a duplicate of #376, trying to fix this issue soon.\n. Thanks for the notice, fixed in the docs now!\n. Great stuff, I'll make the changes in the docs soon\n. Done\n. Thats a good idea, I'll include something soon. Maybe some icons like this: http://gowebmo.com/images/frontend/supported-platforms.png\n. Done 865544f287b703e611908cec9d074f5deec74bf8\n. Try including the sqlite.js file like this: \n\n```\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"SQLitePlugin.js\"></script>\n```\n. Hi @joshilomas the Spinner Dialog plugin was recently updated (in the `master`), and now you can set an option to allow the user to dismiss it or not.\n\nTry:\n\n```\n$cordovaSpinnerDialog.show(\"title\",\"message\", true);\n```\n. Adding this to #262 \n. This should be fixed in 86d22e61723581226443ebfb9a12142c87ee1ffe #485\n\nFile ref:  https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/backgroundGeolocation.js#L23 \n. Looks good to me thanks!\n. Looks good to me! If you have the time, feel free to update the docs to account for this change\n. Thanks for that edit @mica16, I copied pasted the instructions from the official plugin docs and didn't think to check twice\n. I looked at the white-space deletions and it looks like the line-returns are still intact, so markdown will still parse correctly (i believe). I'm gonna merge this and check if everything is still looking alright.\n. Adding this to #262\n. I see what you're doing here, but I'm not sure it is the 'best-practice' way, even though it does work in all the cases I tested. On the plus side, it would make the dist file smaller in side and easier to read, but on the other hand, its helpful to know when the success/error callback returns a value as a param or not, which is not evident when simplifying promises.\n\n@mlynch what do you think?\n. I still think that it's important to keep promise resolves/rejects standard across all plugins, so I'm going to close this PR. I understand your point, but don't believe it fits with the goals of ngCordova.\n\nThanks for the PR however, it's always good to discus these ideas.\n. Adding this to #262 \n. I've just released a new version of ngCordova. It seems I daftly made changes to the `bower.json` and `package.json` files after I released the latest version. It should be working now and resolve to v0.1.7-alpha\n. @yourbuddyconner I didn't realize but the plugin has recently been update, so you should try this until I have fixed it in ngCordova\n\n```\nwindow.plugin.notification.local.promptForPermission();\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/katzer/cordova-plugin-local-notifications/tree/0.7\n. Yes, please look at the docs:\n\nhttp://ngcordova.com/docs/#BackgroundGeolocation\nhttp://ngcordova.com/docs/#Geolocation\n. Adding this to #262 \n. @machard when you reference _apache/cordova-js@26e3e49_, are you suggesting that putting the `ngcordova.js` file after `cordova.js` is okay?\n\n@netanelgilad I think it's good to maintain the docs as they are. If this helps one out 10 people trying to include ngcordova in their project, it's still useful to keep it in.\n. The Media plugin needs a big overhaul, since it doesn't work well with Angular at the moment. Changes should be made soon tho.\n. Hey @mawarnes I've overhauled the media plugin, and it should work now. The docs are also updated and should reflect the changes. If you have the time to test it do let me know if you find any issues.\n\nhttp://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/media/\n. Done ! cc94d53cd55c3d27d15560a1d49c8ffea89401b8\n. @kapilkarda can you point me to the url of the plugin you want ngCordova to include?\n. Which github repo are you talking about? Can you give me the link so that I can take a look at the API\n. Done bb5504ceadc02d361748d94408e6aada1bf47517.\nDocs: http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/imagePicker/\n. Try:\n\n```\n$cordovaFile\n.downloadFile(source, filePath, true)\n.then(function (result) {}, function (err) {},\n function (progress) {\n  if (progress.lengthComputable) {\n      $scope.percentage = (progress.loaded / progress.total);\n  } else {\n      $scope.load++;\n  }\n})\n\n```\n\nAnd other references: http://www.raymondcamden.com/2013/05/01/Using-the-Progress-event-in-PhoneGap-file-transfers\n. Looks good to me. Also +1 for adding tests. Thanks @Foxandxss \n. This couldn't be merged, so I fixed it in ngCordova 0c74f364c209d1725b53af6d28f81d60bc05d233. Thanks!\n. @mobidev111 You're right, and this should be an option. I don't want to break the current way of taking a picture, so maybe a new method with `$cordovaCamera.getPictureWithPopover()` would work? \n. @ybian Thanks for raising this issue. The Zip plugin was submitted through a PR and I hadn't checked to see if it was fully functional. It appears the zip plugin was missing in the `module.js` file, and therefore was not being injected as a dependency in the project. I've corrected it now 7f5a7eebd800540ed7625f43531c5acd83e28baf, so if you download the `master` the plugin should be working. (Also please note that `ionic serve` will not work when using ng-cordova, because you are running your app in your browser, which doesn't have access to any of the plugins that are in your phone.)\n. @khashayar  thanks for the PR, you're missing one thing however. To inject this plugin as a dependency in ng-cordova you need to add it to the `module.js` file in the plugins folder (`src` > `plugins` > `module.js`) If you can make this change I'll accept the PR.\n. Thanks @khashayar. Another few questions: Have you tested the plugin to ensure that it works? And if so do you have any code that you could provide for the docs and the demo app?\n. Adding this to #262\n. Great stuff, give me some time to look through your code and I will most likely merge this PR. Thanks!\n. If you edit your branch with which you submitted the PR with a new commit it will maintain this PR and the changes will be kept, or you can create a new one if you please.\n. @bend0303 The network plugin (like all other cordova plugins), only works when testing on a mobile device running your app. There is currently no browser API to obtain network information, so this will not work. Are you testing in your browser or on your mobile device?\n. I've just tested the network information (+ added two new methods: `watchOnline()`, `watchOffline()`) and both are working without problems.\n\nTake a look at the demo app inside ngCordova for a reference.\n. Could you refer a browser API for obtaining networking information? As far as I can tell there is only an API for firefox, which is not adequate enough to include in ng-cordova.\n. Closing this as I couldn't find any concrete API for network information as stale issue.\n. @floatinghotpot Could you give me a detailed overview of which plugins are completely free to use and which require payment? ngCordova is an open-source project with open-sourced plugins, and we would like to maintain a consistency and commitment to this development model, and therefore don't think shareware belongs in this project.\n\n@mlynch what do you think?\n. I've had issues with using the FB plugin in my app development too. Sometimes it's necessary to include the FacebookConnectPlugin.js file in your `index.html`, as well as include this script, which injects the Facebook Javascript SDK into your app.\n\n```\n<script>\n      window.fbAsyncInit = function() {\n        FB.init({\n          appId      : 'your-app-id',\n          xfbml      : true,\n          version    : 'v2.1'\n        });\n      };\n\n      (function(d, s, id){\n         var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n         if (d.getElementById(id)) {return;}\n         js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;\n         js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js\";\n         fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);\n       }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));\n    </script>\n```\n\nLet me know if that fixes it for you?\n. Ah I realized why including just the `facebookConnectPlugin.js` script did not work previously for me: You have to include `<div id=\"fb-root\"></div>` inside of your index file ([see line in `facebookConnectPlugin.js`](https://github.com/Wizcorp/phonegap-facebook-plugin/blob/master/www/index.html#L43)).\n\nI think I've made it clear what is necessary inside of the [ngCordova Facebook docs](http://ngcordova.com/docs/#Facebook), but if you have anything that you'd like to add please submit a PR and help the community!\n. @maggialejandro also note that if testing in your browser you'll have to add your `http://localhost:8100/` url to the accepted `site URLs` inside of the Facebook Developer portal. The page to configure these settings can be found at at https://developers.facebook.com/apps/{Your App ID}/settings/.\n. The first time your user logins into your app (`$cordovaFacebook.login()`) you'll have to put in **all** of the permissions you require for your app. The modal will open asking the user to allow FB to be used in your app (you can't get around this).\n\nAfter that your app will be _forever_ logged into facebook. If your user closes your app and then reopens it, you should check if the user is currently logged (`$cordovaFacebook.getLoginStatus()`) in **before** asking to login (which is not necessary if `getLoginStatus` results in `true`). That way the modal never pops up again.\n\nThen to call the `api`, make sure that the permissions are `= []`, so that the modal doesn't come up again. If you need extra permissions that you did not include in the login, then you'll have to include them in the `api` call, and it will bring up the modal again.\n\nDoes that help explain a few things?\n. @felquis  I may have misunderstood your question, but yes the iOS app works natively (as explained in my previous comment).\n. That's strange, maybe it's an issue with the Facebook Connect plugin and the iPad? I would create an issue on the [github plugin](https://github.com/Wizcorp/phonegap-facebook-plugin) and see what the owner has to say about it. It might be that you have to remove the browser SDK to allow the iOS plugin to take action and do it natively? Can you do it on an iPhone and verify that it works with the code that you havE?\n. Can you checkout my comment in https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/issues/505#issuecomment-68639466 (#505)\n. Also, instead of checking:\n\n```\nif (cordova.browser = ...)\n```\n\ndo\n\n```\nif (!window.cordova)\n```\n. @jlstr I didn't notice that the `if (cordova.browser = ...)` is part of the [wizcorp facebook plugin in line 12](https://github.com/Wizcorp/phonegap-facebook-plugin/blob/master/facebookConnectPlugin.js#L12). This is a huge error in the FB plugin, since cordova is **obviously** undefined in the browser.\n\nI've just made this PR https://github.com/Wizcorp/phonegap-facebook-plugin/pull/880 which hopefully will go through and fix this issue.\n\nIn the mean time use `(!window.cordova)` rather than `if (cordova.browser = ...)`.\n. @cquartier I agree with your reasoning. I've looking into when the digest is called inside an app, and apparently if it called outside (eg: in cordova) then you must call the `$apply()` function to trigger a new digest.\n\nI've seen a few cases where it's good to check if a digest cycle is in process (sec [angular.js repo](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/src/ng/http.js#L1061)):\n\n```\nif (!$rootScope.$$phase) $rootScope.$apply();\n```\n\nBut I've also read this:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22346990/why-is-using-ifscope-phase-scope-apply-an-anti-pattern.\n\nI'll have to look into this more, but for now this is a working fix, thanks.\n. Also I'm thinking of adding a new function to the `$cordovaPush` plugin, like:\n\n```\nreturn {\n  listenNotificationReceived: function() {\n    q = $q.defer();\n    $rootScope.$on(\"pushNotificationReceived\", function() {\n      q.resolve();\n    });\n\n    return q.promise;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nwhich would erase the need to do\n\n```\n $scope.$on('pushNotificationReceived', function(event, notification) {\n    $scope.messageArray.push(notification.payload);\n  });\n```\n. @cquartier `$apply()` is adequate in this situation.\n\nYou might be right about the promise resolving only once when the `$rootScope.$on(...)` event is fired.\n\nIn fact a promise doesn't make sense here at all. Promises are meant for an asynchronous event, whereas with `$broadcast`, the `$on` event is fired and the resulting function is immediately called right after. Therefore the only solution for this would be a callback:\n\n```\nreturn {\n  listenNotificationReceived: function(callback) {\n    $rootScope.$on(\"pushNotificationReceived\", callback());\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd usage:\n\n```\nmyApp.controller(function($scope, $pushPlugin) {\n  $scope.myArr = [];\n\n  $pushPlugin.listenNotificationReceived(function () {\n    // do something now that the notification has been received\n  })\n});\n```\n. Looks good to me thanks @aradnom. The docs on the official website are misleading because the plugin currently has two branches. may be good to note on the docs that this is the case.\n. It's a good start, but a few things are missing I think. Thanks @shalotelli \n. Looks good to me, thanks @floatinghotpot \n. Closing this issue and moving it to #348. I'll try to get this fixed soon.\n. Great stuff @nraboy \n. Good Implementation @jonlil, I like the way you set default options. Thanks for the PR!\n\nAnd re: _Should I also build dist files?_, we prefer PRs to not be dist-built, which makes it easier to merge.\n. I'm afraid I can't change the functionality of the Camera or BarcodeScanner plugin, so you'll have to submit an issue to the respective repos themselves. \n. @mrzmyr is correct. Try `bower install ngCordova#master`\n. I think jsDoc may be the best way going forward to add solid documentation to the [ngCordova docs](http://ngcordova.com/docs/). Do you know if the creates a bigger/ larger size (memory wise) when compiling into the dist folder?\n. @Stolz  I've made a few changes to the bluetooth serial plugin  941f39fba177bd1a819c497ee3346d4258b836cb, see if that fixes your problems? Also note that `connectInsecure()` doesn't work on iOS (according to the docs). \n. Shoot, thanks for pointing that out. I forgot to delete a plugin injection, fixed in f4725d8c5d5daaea6100e08a1d80a39226e7121e. I tested it and should be working now\n. Yes, it was put in after the 0.1.7 release, try `bower install ngCordova#master`\n. Thanks, fixed in 2b29727a1116dd7fdb364ff38ac92f9a56cf2b78\n. @aplatanado Your fix is definitely correct. Before I merge your PR, do you think you could correct the `$cordovaPreferences` test so that the build succeeds?\n. Great stuff, thanks @aplatanado \n. It's currently not supported by ngCordova, but if you can link me the plugin on github or submit a PR we can add it to ngCordova.\n. Hi @wootwoot1234, the email composer already exists through the [social sharing plugin](http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/socialSharing/) api, but it might be a good idea to add this too and let the developers decide which one they want to use. What do you think?\n. This is the perfect place (and the only one really) to post an error like this. Thanks for pointing it out, fixed in 0899f38e2d56bbd109900f4359da61f39e2163d7\n. It's tricky to know which is the best plugin to include, since there are 6 + available in github.\n\nI'm inclined to switch to this one https://github.com/apla/me.apla.cordova.app-preferences, since it appears to be still maintained (last commit, one month ago). Needs more looking into, but any thoughts on switching to this one?\n. @inexion Many plugins don't work on the simulator alone. You have to test the demo app on your **actual iPhone**. See if that fixes it?\n. @inexion I've got the demo build working on my iPhone 6. Try this:\n\n```\ncd demo\nbash init.sh\ncordova platform add ios\ncordova build ios\n```\n\nThat should get your project working.\n. @chocho01 It seems you have mistakenly submitted a PR merging ngCordova's `master` branch into `WIP-cordovaready-new`. If you could please submit your changes from your branch into the ngCordova `master` that would be great.\n. Looks goood to me!\n. Seems like a reasonable fix to me.\n. Can you checkout some of the \"Common Issues\" on the docs page: http://ngcordova.com/docs/ and let me know if that fixes anything?\n\nDon't forget to wrap the `$cordovaBackgroundGeolocation` in a `deviceready` event like:\n\n```\ndocument.addEventListener(\"deviceready\", function () {\n  $cordovaPlugin.someFunction().then(success, error);\n}, false);\n\n// OR with Ionic\n\n$ionicPlatform.ready(function() {\n  $cordovaPlugin.someFunction().then(success, error);\n});\n```\n. Ah, good to know. Maybe I should be more specific in the docs. Closing this then :)\n. @mab9824 I have agree with you on that, I've tried making the contrast higher in the past, but it's still not optimal. \n\nI'm working on a complete docs refractor, with a better design and UI, should be up in a few weeks.\n. @mab9824 Please go and check out the _NEW_ docs: [ngcordova.com/docs](http://ngcordova.com/docs/). Enjoy!\n. Looks great to me. @floatinghotpot Have you open sourced these plugins?\n. I believe #490 fixed this issue, so closing this for now unless the issue is still coming up.\n. I don't think this structure is in the roadmap for ngCordova. I understand why you want to only have a few plugins, and that's why we built the custom-build tool, but having each plugin as a subtree is not very ideal for development or production use.\n\nIn the end the `ngcordova.min.js` file is only 68kb, which is very small for a Cordova mobile app, so I wouldn't worry too much about including the whole file in your project.\n. @mica16 Can you take a look at the [demo example of the Facebook plugin](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/tree/master/demo/www/app/facebook)? (also make sure to look at the `.run()` Angular method, which sets the FB ID for web development\n\n```\nif (!window.cordova) {\n      var appID = 1234567890;\n      var version = \"v2.0\"; // or leave blank and default is v2.0\n      $cordovaFacebookProvider.setAppID(appID, version);\n    }\n```\n\nI've got it working on my iPhone (iOS 8) and on the web dev environment.\n. Great stuff, looks good to me.\n. This is a much smarter implementation, great idea. Can you confirm that no issues arise with this method? If so, this implementation should be used for the `$cordovaDeviceMotion` and `$cordovaDeviceOrientation`.\n\nDocs will need to be updated accordingly\n. @gdi2290 noticed a mistake: the variable `watchID` is not the same throughout. Could you change it all to `watchID` with capitalized `ID`? Should be good to merge after.\n. Awesome! Thanks for the great stuff @gdi2290.\n. You have to wrap the plugin call in:\n\n```\ndocument.addEventListener(\"deviceready\", function () {\n  $cordovaPlugin.someFunction().then(success, error);\n}, false);\n\n// OR with Ionic\n\n$ionicPlatform.ready(function() {\n  $cordovaPlugin.someFunction().then(success, error);\n});\n```\n. What registration ID are you talking about? is it for iOS or Android?\n\nCheck out the [docs for the push plugin](http://ngcordova.com/docs/#Push).\n. @nraboy any ideas here? I haven't used the OAuth plugin extensively so can't answer this at the moment.\n. +1\n. Merged #526 and fixed.\n. Seems harmless to me. Thanks for the PR, will merge if Travis CI build passes.\n. @jrodenbostel Thanks for the PR, but since the File Transfer plugin was completely refactored I ended up adding this small fix in myself!\n. Try to wrap the plugin call in:\n\n```\ndocument.addEventListener(\"deviceready\", function () {\n  $cordovaPlugin.someFunction().then(success, error);\n}, false);\n\n// OR with Ionic\n\n$ionicPlatform.ready(function() {\n  $cordovaPlugin.someFunction().then(success, error);\n});\n```\n. This seems like a problem with the plugin itself and not ngCordova, which is out of the scope of this project, so I'm going to close this issues and ask that you post a new issue at the plugin's repo: https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser. Thanks for raising the issue.\n. You may have to create an Apache account and submit it at this page: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB/component/12320641/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:component-summary-panel\n. Shoot, good catch.\n. @saimon24 This was fixed in 8baad5c84852733edf2e1f0688801e159de26b9a right? I think i can close this now.\n. I see what you mean, and your comments actually showed me that calling `init()` inside the login method is not the right way to implement the FB plugin.\n\nI've made some changes to the plugin in 64b5aa8036d23dd768a2b47c21e760871feb94dd . I'll make changes to the docs soon. Now to test in the browser, before calling the `login` or `getLoginStatus`, you have to call `$cordovaFacebookProvider.initBrowser(id, version)` in the `config` module of your Angular app.\n. @nandanrao first off install the latest through bower:\n\n```\nbower install ngCordova#master\n```\n\nThat'll give you the latest changes to the FB plugin in ngCordova, and the working implementations that are in [the FB docs](http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/facebook/).\n\nThen you should take a look at the DEMO app inside of ngCordova. It has a working example of the FB plugin. Look at [this source code specifically](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/demo/www/app/app.js#L74).\n\nIf you have more problems you might have to include the FB javascript file yourself like so:\n\n```\n<script>\n    (function (d, s, id) {\n      var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n      if (d.getElementById(id)) {\n        return;\n      }\n      js = d.createElement(s);\n      js.id = id;\n      js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js\";\n      fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);\n    }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));\n  </script>\n\n  <!-- Facebook Plugin copy pasted from the plugin/facebookplugin/js/... for web-dev -->\n  <script src=\"lib/facebookConnectPlugin.js\"></script>\n```\n\nI do both just in case. It's mainly an issue with the implementation by WizCorp which makes the FB plugin. So keep trying and you'll get it.\n\nAlso if you're having problems with getting it to work natively, you'll have to go into the `info-*****.plist` file (for iOS) and add you're app name and app ID. Again I recommend looking into the DEMO folder for a working example.\n. very nice! demos ftw.\n. I've actually implemented a more angular way of receiving theses notifications, see b72ed84417f94342e8f3e485216bbe109c6eb003.\n\nIt's not the best way to do it yet (since you still need to call the each function to start the `$broadcast`, `$on` events, but it's a start.\n\nHave you been able to get local notifications to work? I've tried and have had 0 success\n. Thanks @marcus30, fixed in 6a1ffd75832e285f2f4a7617fec1da9dbdc2718c\n. I've actually implemented a more angular way of receiving theses notifications, see b72ed84417f94342e8f3e485216bbe109c6eb003.\n\nIt's not the best way to do it yet (since you still need to call the each function to start the `$broadcast`, `$on` events, but it's a start.\n\nHave you been able to get local notifications to work? I've tried and have had 0 success\n. Hi @schnti, this is an awesome plugin, but I don't think there is anything that ngCordova can do to improve it's usability. If I understand it correctly, all you have to do it install the plugin, and then link to your app in the `href` attribute.\n\nTake a look at the [plugin's iOS API](https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/Custom-URL-scheme/blob/master/www/ios/LaunchMyApp.js), it's empty. And the [Android API](https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/Custom-URL-scheme/blob/master/www/android/LaunchMyApp.js) only has one public method.\n\nThanks for the suggestion, but I don't think it fits well in ngCordova. If you think otherwise let me know why and I'll be happy to consider it again.\n. @dmackerman Others have noticed that ngCordova doesn't work with Angular 1.3.x, so I'm trying to resolve this issue before bumping up the bower dependency higher (or rather to anything 1.2.x +).\n\nWill get back to you on this.\n. This should be fixed now, and included in the latest release `v0.1.9-alpha`.\n. @nezencreation This is actually not an error in the documentation, but an improvement on the old version of the source code. In `v0.1.8-alpha` the promisification of `$cordovaGeolocation`, `$cordovaDeviceMotion` and `$cordovaDeviceOrientation` was enhanced to make it easier to clear the `watch`.\n\n If you download `v0.1.8-alpha` you'll get the most recent version, and the error that you're incurring should not occur. Also please refer to the docs to make sure that you're implementing it correctly.\n. All methods now use `resolveLocalFileSystemURL` to get the FileSystem. Docs should be helpful\n. Great stuff. I'm going to expand the docs to capture each method + params (like http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/actionSheet/). \n. I've updated the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) with the latest changes. If you want to know more details check out the [Releases](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/releases)\n. Moving this to #528\n. I don't think I can help you here, since this seems to be an issue with the [Camera plugin](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-camera/blob/master/doc/index.md) and not ngCordova. But [the docs](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-camera/blob/master/doc/index.md) suggest this:\n- Set `quality` below 50 to avoid memory errors on some devices.\n. Changes were recently made to the media plugin: f6a4af8c07e5d886e117b0b82190534729d8c5ec\nCheck out the docs to see how it works.\n\nBut you'r right about `MediaStatus`, I'll look into that.\n. @nraboy Could you rebase your PR, because it's currently unmergable?\n. Thanks!\n. @nukenin Why do you propose this fix? I did this so that if facebook has already been initialized, do not init again, whereas your method always inits it.\n. Ah, I must have understood how the `init()` method should be called. If that is true, then there is no need to include the `if` statement, but I'll merge the fix for now.\n. Duplicate of #446\n. @sean-hill check out this discussion : https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/issues/446#issuecomment-69132485\n. I'm working on a better tutorial for both iOS and android, with an example app and nodejs server example too. Expect it in the next week or two.\n. It's a good idea, but not for the ngCordova project. NgCordova wraps pre-made plugins and can't change the plugins themself, so if you could suggest this edit in the form of an issue on the plugin repo itself that would be great.\n. Thank you @EricWVGG  we plan on adding more details to the docs soon, but for now this reference should help:\n\nhttp://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/fileTransfer/\n. Thanks for the suggestion @sunsus, but we opted to use $broadcast events to transmit these messages and events, and I don't think `q.notify` is the right thing to use here.\n\nAlso I've added the `show()` method in a different commit.\n. Thanks, fixed\n. hmm, that's a good point. I'll look into it. I don't like the way the Push Notification plugin handles the `notification` event, so it's a bit tedious to implement.\n. Fix it now. 1cb428af99fbac3c55ef8152a619db6b64f89199\n\nIt check if `ng-app` is available in the body, if not uses `document.body`. Checked it on my iPhone 6 and is working.\n. @JiachenDuan Are you talking about the Facebook plugin? http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/facebook/\n. @JiachenDuan You need the facebook plugin to do that. Since the `$cordovaOAuth` plugin opens a new browser inside of the app, it doesn't have access to a logged-in Facebook account, so the user will have to log in every time through the browser.\n. @JiriChara Have you resolved your issue? Can this issue be closed now?\n. @nraboy Any ideas for this?\n\n@Enkows I think your fix is correct. It seems `browserRef.close();` is being called before the `defferred.resolve()` is fulfilled.\n. +1\n. Working on this at the moment, hope to get it out today.\n\nI'm also refactoring the `getDirectory()` method from `requestFileSystem` --> `resolveLocalFileSystemURL` so that it can be better configured.\n\n@cfjedimaster would have time to comment / test?\n. Done in the latest few commits.\n. Docs coming soon too.\n. @kurtommy Are you using the custom build for ngCordova? There have been known problems with it and I would recommend downloading the entire `dist` file for now.\n. Okay, have you tried some scenarios in the [common issues docs](http://ngcordova.com/docs/common-issues/)? Also make sure `ngcordova.js` is above `cordova.js`\n\n``` html\n<script src=\"lib/ngCordova/dist/ng-cordova.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"cordova.js\"></script>\n```\n\nI am certain that the Toast Plugin is working, so there must be something wrong on your end.\n. Can you make a Pull Request so that other can use this code too?\n. Bower installed these because Ionic uses them as a dependency. And no you don't need these, in theory you can delete them and it won't affect your ionic project.\n. Check out this file : https://github.com/driftyco/ionic/blob/master/bower.json#L50\nIt has the dependencies that you mentioned above. So when you do ANY `bower instal ...` action it will automatically get these dependencies.\n\nIf you project is working in your browser/phone there should be no problem\n. @brunyan I hope that makes it clearer?\n. Done thanks!\n. Quick question, is the `navigator.languages` API available in all browsers? Will IE have troubles with this? (not that IE is a priority for ng-cordova-mocks).\n\nLooks great otherwise.\n. Awesome! Great stuff @calendee \n. Done. Check out https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng-cordova\n. Also added an automatic deploy script to NPM through Travis CI 081a23f493eb8871f1a8789c209026c9b00d4a05\n\nEvery time a new version is released, it will update the npm package automatically.\n. Excellent stuff, thanks you @rubocoptero \n. Thanks for the issue, and you're definitely right. If several push notifications are sent at the same time, the $digest cycle is likely to still be running. Fix in 1cb428af99fbac3c55ef8152a619db6b64f89199\n\nNow uses `$timeout`\n. @ozexpert Can you give me details about your environment?\n- Phone OS\n- ngCordova version\n- the code you're using\n\nI have the `$cordovaContacts.pickContact()` method working on my iPhone (look at the `/demo/www/app/contacts` folder).\n. Good catch. The action sheet also needs to be removed in this file\n. Looks like a good plugin to add, but the repo you linked to is a fork of a more popular and recently updated plugin.\n\nLets use this one instead: https://github.com/domaemon/org.apache.cordova.plugin.tts\n. It's an interesting concept, but I don't think it fits well into ngCordova. PersistenceJS creates its own wrapper for the SQLite plugin, which directly collides with the purpose of ngcordova. You should probably use this as a supplement to ngCordova.\n. Fixed in a5df9db264a72fa7ef10848d93925ab15490cf75\n. You can't catch pending notifications, because it's generally impossible to know when a notification is pending or not. But you can catch when a new notification IS sent from a server. Check out the [Push Notification Docs in ngCordova](http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/pushNotifications/).\n\nBut generally you want to listen for the `notificationReceieved` event like so:\n\n``` javascript\n$rootScope.$on('pushNotificationReceived', function(event, notification) {\n...\n});\n```\n. Thanks @Foxandxss \n. There have been changes made to the InAppBrowser in the `master` branch. What version of ngCordova are you using?\n. I made some changes yesterday that I have tested and are working. Install the `master` branch by:\n\n```\nbower install ngCordova#master\n```\n\n#### Using is like so:\n\n**Set Default Options**\n\n```\n.config(function($cordovaInAppBrowserProvider) {\n  var options = {\n    location : \"no\",\n    toolbar: \"yes\"\n  };\n\n  $cordovaInAppBrowserProvider.setDefaultOptions(options);\n});\n```\n\n**Open the browser in a controller**\n\n```\n.controller(\"SomeCtrl\", function ($cordovaInAppBrowser) {\n\n  var overrideOptions = {\n    location : \"yes\",\n    toolbar: \"yes\"\n  };\n\n  $cordovaInAppBrowser.open('http://ngcordova.com', '_blank', options).then(function () {\n      console.log(\"InAppBrowser opened http://ngcordova.com successfully\");\n   }, function (error) {\n      console.log(\"Error: \" + error);\n   });\n\n  // listen for inappbrowser events\n  $rootScope.$on('$cordovaInAppBrowser:loadstart', function(e, event) {});\n  $rootScope.$on('$cordovaInAppBrowser:loadstop', function(e, event));\n  $rootScope.$on('$cordovaInAppBrowser:loaderror', function(e, event));\n  $rootScope.$on('$cordovaInAppBrowser:exit', function(e, event));\n});\n```\n. You're right, I made a small mistake fixing now.\n. Fix now in the `master` branch: 17668fdd2efcfb624b5bf2fbdb46658e44765085\n. Looks good to me! thanks @nraboy \n. I've never used the Device Motion plugin to detect shakes, and I'm not sure that it would be the right plugin to use. You might want to look at http://plugreg.com/ for a plugin that might help you do this. Or ask a question on the http://forum.ionicframework.com/\n. @Duovili I've found a plugin you want: https://github.com/leecrossley/cordova-plugin-shake-detection\n\nI might have time to add it to ngCordova this afternoon.\n. Can you share some code that you're working with. Also what plugin are you using? It seems you might be using the $cordovaOAuth plugin, you might need to check if it works on WP8.\n. Can you share your code + environment (phone, cordova version, etc)\n\nAnd Checkout http://ngcordova.com/docs/common-issues/\n. You have to wrap each plugin call with \n\n```\ndocument.addEventListener(\"deviceready\", function () {\n  $cordovaPlugin.someFunction().then(success, error);\n}, false);\n```\n. Ahh check out the [official docs](https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/SocialSharing-PhoneGap-Plugin#sharing-directly-to) And look at the `shareViaEmail` example:\n\n``` js\nwindow.plugins.socialsharing.shareViaEmail(\n  'Message', // can contain HTML tags, but support on Android is rather limited\n  'Subject',\n  ['to@person1.com', 'to@person2.com'], // TO: must be null or an array\n  ['cc@person1.com'], // CC: must be null or an array\n  null, // BCC: must be null or an array\n  ['https://www.google.nl/images/srpr/logo4w.png','www/localimage.png'], // FILES: can be null, a string, or an array\n  onSuccess, // called when sharing worked, but also when the user cancelled sharing via email (I've found no way to detect the difference)\n  onError // called when sh*t hits the fan\n);\n```\n\nso with ngCordova it would be \n\n```\n$cordovaSocialSharing\n        .shareViaEmail(message, subject, null, null, null, null)\n```\n\nIf that works for you, I'll make some changes to the ngCordova source file to catch this type of error\n. Good to know. \n. Thanks for the PR @PureSpider but I'd like to keep it as it is.\n. @kurtommy Thanks for the PR, but can you put these mocks into their own files in the `/src/mocks/`, otherwise the next time I build the project it will replace these mocks!\n. That's a strange error, and really should not be occuring. If you look at ngCordova's [bower file](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/bower.json#L11-L12), you'll notice that the `main` and `ignore` are both in there.\n\nI'll look into this.\n. I like your idea and think it would in fact be very beneficial to have **all** cordova plugins registered on both the phonegap + cordova registry.\n\nI've always considered a side project of ngCordova to contain it's own registry, which could be downloaded like:\n\n```\nngCordova add $cordovaFile\nngCordova add $cordovaFacebook\n...\n```\n\nThe main issue with this is that the plugins are officially owned and maintained by their respective creators. This means that it's neither my place to put them into the registry nor is it very efficient for keeping them all up to date on the registry.\n\nBut your idea is good, so I'm going to start some issues on each plugin to get the owner to register them.\n. Thanks for raising that issue! And you're right, tested and fixed: d46d6ae368f4abdc2270621644fc592255aa9c4c\n. Shoot, sorry I just woke up -- mind is slow. How about:\n\n```\nif (angular.element(document.querySelector('[ng-app]')) === undefined) {\n  if (angular.element(document.querySelector('[ng-app]'))) {\n     injector = \"document.querySelector('[ng-app]')\";\n  }\n  else {\n    injector = \"document.body\";\n  }\n```\n. You're right, no point testing if the angular element exists, when we are really determining if the `ng-app` element exists.\n. Should be right now 1522f3d278401c2fe5133fed148a19dd1233465d\n. @Midraks there must be an error in your code somewhere, since ngCordova doesn't break apps (as far as I know). Can you provide your error log\n. Great idea. I'll look into. It will take some time to implement if I can get around to it.\n. I'm adding the `clearWatch` method to the returned promise -- it allows the user to call this function after the promise has been resolved.\n. I've added `copy` and `move` methods, but I'll look into the `rename` method\n. Thanks for the PR @mateuszkocz. A big refactor was done to the File plugin to adjust for this.\n. Looks good to me, thanks @SoEasy \n. This does look better. I had previously assumed that all that was important for the `hasPermission()` method was the resolve/reject clause, but I suppose some devs do want to have the boolean value.\n. @TLmaK0 Yes, yes, yes. This is a great idea! I was planning on overhauling the file plugin completely next week, but this is a great start. The file plugin needs to be more customizable and the `$provider` is definitely the way to go.\n\n**I can't merge it however, since there must be some clashes in your code with the current master of ngCordova**. Can you pull the latest changes from ngCordova, merge them into your local branch and add them to your `TLmaK0:master` branch. Any changes you make there will be automatically put into the PR, so no need to make another PR.\n. That's a great idea, but I'm not sure I have the time to transfer the docs over to Dash, especially when we have our own site. thanks for the idea.\n. @buunguyen hit it on the nail. If you submit a PR -- github will check the unit tests as a last-check too.\n. Maybe try setting the preferences before the customlocale? I'm not sure I can help here -- seems like an issue with the plugin itself.\n. @kapilkarda Can you provide the link for the plugin you want?\n. That's a good idea, I'll get on that. But since the File plugin is now using `window.resolveLocalFileSystemURL`, I'll use this instead:\n\n```\nwindow.resolveLocalFileSystemURL = window.resolveLocalFileSystemURL ||\n                                   window.webkitResolveLocalFileSystemURL\n```\n. Thanks for raising the issue -- can you tell me which function/method you are using/calling? Are you using the OAuth plugin?\n\nI can see why this _might_ happen, but it doesn't make sense in the OAuth plugin.\n. It seems you're using an older version of ngCordova. Please update to the latest: `bower install ngCordova`\n. Yes thats true, but only because it takes time to add plugins to the documentation. Still trying to add them to the docs.\n. Did you solve this error?\n. Okay good to know. Do you think it was an issue with ngCordova, or more with how your configured your dependencies? -- Just want to know in case there is an actual error here.\n. This looks great. Breaks down the POST and GET a lot better.\n\n@nraboy what's your opinion?\n\n@danieljoppi One thing I've noticed is that the `method` value (eg: `post` and `get`) is not capitalized (`POST`, `GET`) -- does this work?\n. I'm going to close this for now. The current solution works, and there isn't a big difference in performance.\n. Thanks for raising the issue. Fixed now!\n. awesome!\n. Thanks for the PR @ldeavila, but we prefer to do `gulp build` on our side of the project as to ensure other PRs don't have a merge problem.\n. Thanks @beauby and sorry for the late reply.\n. Thanks for noticing, fixed now.\n. Thanks for the PR @alexandreetf! can do you two things:\n- Add a comment in the plugin file for `link` and `github`, like for the [other plugins](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/adMob.js#L1-L2)\n- Add `'ngCordova.plugins.insomnia'` to the [module.js](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/module.js) file so that is it actually injected as a dependency.\n. cheers @alexandreetf \n. Look great!\n. Letme know if [your PR for the official plugin](wildabeast/BarcodeScanner#250) gets merged, if so I'd be happy to merge this one!\n. awesome thanks @manzapanza !\n. Thanks for the PRS @DanailMinchev -- I had to check that everything was right before merging it, and I've been short on time lately, so sorry about that!\n. Thanks for the PR @paulogr, but it's missing one thing: can you include the `ngCordova.plugins.googlePlayGame` module as a dependency in the `/plugins/module.js` file?\n. I assume @sfielder closed this because it was resolved?\n. Nice! looks good\n. @agustinf thanks for spotting that, do you mind making a PR with the correct changes?\n. See if this page works: [edit /plugins/pushNotifications](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/edit/gh-pages/docs/plugins/pushNotifications/index.md).\n. :+1: \n. Awesome, thanks @dhallsim \n. I think we would make use of [JSCS](http://jscs.info/) for the formatting issue. I'll look into it!\n. Done. https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/gulpfile.js#L84\n\nUsage:\n\n```\ngulp test\n```\n. Could you try using the _un-minified_ `ng-cordova.js` file, so that I can see exactly where the error is?\n. Awesome stuff @root-io. Thanks a bunch.\n. thanks, fixed aec080702e809033591adcf5f252040b4aeecbea\n. You're right, I shouldve checked earlier about the `$rootScope.$eval()`. Thanks @calendee\n. @francesco-strazzullo thanks for the PR - however would you mind removing the `build` files from this PR? It causes future problems for merging PRs, so we generally ask that a PR only includes the changes  that belong in this feat/fix.\n. @francesco-strazzullo thanks for the PR - however would you mind removing the `build` files from this PR? It causes future problems for merging PRs, so we generally ask that a PR only includes the changes  that belong in this feat/fix.\n. @toddhalfpenny Thanks for the PR! However we ask that you don't build the ngCordova package for a new PR, because it causes problems for merging other PRs in the future. Would you mind only including the fixes/code that your submitted?\n. Thanks for the fix @RangerRick \n. hi @bpietravalle - if you could update the docs with this new method I'd be happy to merge!\n.

When we're talking about e2e testing of ng-cordova including cordova itself it makes totally sense to simulate real device data and so on, but isn't the job of low level tests like unit tests just to ensure that i.e. `navigator.getPicture` is called with the right params ?\n\nor are you planning e2e tests instead of unit testing ? \n.

Recent changes did a overhead to merge the master in, lets discuss about bringing ng-annotate into the build in #181.\n. keychain can be checked.\n. #300 adds the new googleAnalytics documentation. I think its better to not add the legacy documentation for the old ga.js plugin because we want to remove it in **v0.2.0-beta** ([mentioned here](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/issues/53#issuecomment-54536764)).\n.

So what is the use case for checking the availability of a plugin? May you can provide a whole code example. Just try to figure out if its necessary for more users of ngCordova.  \n. This is done with promises. Look up the recent documentation PR here how to use it:\nhttps://github.com/mrzmyr/ng-cordova/blob/02207355af32c426658829aee43b044ef6877591/docs/index.md#cordovabackgroundgeolocation\n. Its already on the roadmap for v0.1.4-alpha in #176.\n. Cool then, lets wait for the refactoring. Will you also include the documentation in your refactoring ?\n. Should we put into the v0.2.0-beta release, because of a **breaking change** or just put it in the v0.1.4-alpha release ?\n. ups, yep. \n. may we add #282 (WebIntent) and #283 (Zip)?\n. +1\n. `.travis.yml`\n\n```\nlanguage: node_js\nnode_js:\n  - \"0.10\"\nbefore_install:\n  - npm install -g gulp bower\n  - bower install\n  - npm install\n```\n\n`package.json`\n\n```\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"test\": \"gulp karma --browsers=PhantomJS --reporters=progress\",\n}\n```\n. As you can see [here](https://github.com/mrzmyr/ng-cordova/commit/943bf87584c1b02c67e600a1e18d9b7484e3fe8d#diff-1a523bd9fa0dbf998008b37579210e12R1314) the `openDBBackground` method was dropped, so you can use it like in the docs before except for the `openDBBackground` method you have to use [this migration](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/277#issue-42383488).\n. I'll come up with unit tests for it, so this is not happening again first. Atfer this the change will be coming. \n. Resolving just is working with one parameter, tho. So when you need **tx** and **res** we need to combine it into a object like this: \n\n``` js\ndb.transaction(function (tx) {\n  tx.executeSql(query, binding, function (tx, result) {\n    q.resolve({\n      transaction: tx,\n      result: result\n    });\n  }, function (transaction, error) {\n    q.reject({\n      transaction: transaction,\n      error: error\n    });\n  });\n});\n```\n\n**Usage** would be:\n\n``` js\n$cordovaSQLite.execute(db, query, binding)\n  .then(function (response) {\n    result = response.result;\n    // console.log(response.transaction);\n  }, function (response) {\n    error = response.error;\n    // console.log(response.transaction);\n  });\n```\n\n@PavelPolyakov, @pbernasconi What you think about it ?\n\nImplementation of it can be found here: https://github.com/mrzmyr/ng-cordova/commit/50cf139de19ae3ad3a7a8238a56502e89bd71e73\n. I don't think this is how to resolve it. May you can ignore the `ngCordova.min.js` path in the grunt-wiredep plugin ?\n. Ok i didn't know that the bower specs are saying to not include minified files. \nThanks for the hint then. \n. +1, I'll implemented it the coming days.\n. So I will add a deprecation warning  to the PR that the nested function will be removed in v0.2.0-beta.\n. This needs some more investigation about the new API, so I'll watch out how to make the new API supporting the old one.\n. I think this is fixed unit #296 is merged.\n. +1\n. We maybe can think about separating the plugins to $cordovaFile and $cordovaFileTransfer to make it more clear, and for sure the docs need to get better at the $cordovaFile thing also. \n. Here you go: #304\n. Its better to rename it to `$cordovaGoogleAnalytics`, because even google not call it `ga.js` anymore. Please wait with the merge unit it.\n. Now its ready for merging. :+1: \n. @mzbyszynski :+1: \n. @tkempf yeah that was my fault, I think in the `ngCordovaMocks` module the usual angular services are not included so we have to declare them specifically. \n\nBefore: `var $mocksInjector = angular.injector(['ngCordovaMocks']);`\nAfter: `var $mocksInjector = angular.injector(['ng', 'ngCordovaMocks']);`\n\nLet me know if it works for you.\n. I think this need to be implemented first into the [google-analytics-plugin](https://github.com/danwilson/google-analytics-plugin/tree/master).\n. May we should close this. I'll create a new PR for it which is mergeable.\n. Hey @Freundschaft, the reason is that `$cordovaLocalNotification.onclick` [is a function](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/localNotification.js#L103-L105). This is a bug and a mistake in the implementation I think. \n\nSo there are two solutions how to solve that (by the implementation):\n\nAlias the function ([`localNotification.js:103`](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/localNotification.js#L103))\n\n``` js\nonclick: window.plugin.notification.local.onclick,\n```\n\nThe usage of this would be how you expected it would be:\n`$cordovaLocalNotification.onclick = function (id, state, json) {`\n\n---\n\nOr use Angular events for it:\n\n``` js\nvar scope = $rootScope.$new();\n\n// assign all functions to the scope\nscope. getTriggeredIds = function () { ... }\n\n// use angular events\nwindow.plugin.notification.local.onclick = function (id, state, json) {\n    scope.$broadcast('click', id, state, json)\n};\n\nreturn scope;\n```\n\nThe usage would be like:\n\n``` js\n$cordovaLocalNotification.$on('click', function (event, id, state, json) {\n   console.log(event, id, state, json);\n});\n```\n\n@pbernasconi, what do you think ?\n. As i saw in #166, this may requires @perrygovier help ?\n. Hey @vovikdrg, I think you are right when you mean the [`camera.js`](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/mocks/camera.js) plugin. Other plugins like [`device.js`](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/mocks/device.js) already have the possibility to setup the mocks you need from outside. \n\nIf you have a good idea how to setup mock data in the `getPicture` function a PR is appreciated.\n. In terms of you [comment here](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/issues/53#issuecomment-54536764). May its about the v0.2.0-beta or is it now brought over to the v0.1.5-alpha version?\n. :+1:\n. Hey @gruppjo, we also had a discussion about it in #261 and resolved it with #274.\nSo as you can see in [`bower.json`](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/bower.json#L12) there is just the non-minified version speicifed.\n\nDo you consume the last version of ngCordova ?\n. @gruppjo, close issue ?\n. Ok you have to do it. Just press the \"Close Issue\" button on the bottom of the text field. \n. The first error you get (\"_browser testing i get a Cannot_...\") is expected because cordova is not available in desktop browsers. Further reading: #307  \n. So one of the possible solutions would be to just use the `$injector` to avoid an DI error:\n\n``` js\nangular.module('myApp', []).controller('myCtrl', function ($injector) {\n  if (window.cordova) {\n    var $cordovaBackgroundGeolocation = $injector.get('$cordovaBackgroundGeolocation');\n  }\n})\n```\n. May you can create a new issue for it with more description and edit this issue to just target the _\"Cannot read property 'backgroundGeoLocation' of undefined\"_ Problem and close it ?\n. Add it also to #203 ?\n. Build will be successfully when #346 is merged.\n. I already got a solution for it generalized for every plugin. #307 May you want to check it out and leave a comment there.\n. I think there is already a angular plugin for it: https://github.com/AlexDisler/ng-storekit#usage\n. If I got the approach right, ngCordova tries to focus more to bring VanillaJS Cordova API's into the AngularJS world and not to integrate other AngularJS services into ngCordova. \n. Ouh ok, I think I got you wrong @EdL. I tought you want to reimplement the AngularJS service into ngCordova, but I think what you want is a 'own implementation' of the origin phonegap plugin in ngCrodova. \nI think, as @mlynch mentioned, its a idea that makes sense. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. Problem like #307 ?\n. Also related to #307 \n. Duplicate of #338 ?\n. These plugins need to be paid ? http://rjfun.github.io/\n. Probably you need to update ngCordova. It was already fixed in the last commit of the file: https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/commit/114da5522755b6efd04a2c930cc37e643307454d\n. :+1: \n. @pbernasconi, battery status can be checked since 897dd65c459b35a3b4c8ec8a862b3b5984e5547a\n.

Let me know if you're interested in bringing ngAnnotate into the ngCordova build, so I could provide a new PR.\n. So currently you will wait unit the wip-mock is ready before writing tests ?\n. When we're talking about e2e testing of ng-cordova including cordova itself it makes totally sense to simulate real device data and so on, but isn't the job of low level tests like unit tests just to ensure that i.e. `navigator.getPicture` is called with the right params ?\n\nor are you planning e2e tests instead of unit testing ? \n. I don't meant mocks. Sorry, maybe this wasn't that clear. \nMy question was if you are planning to unit test the plugins ?\n. My question is answered. @mzbyszynski, we got mocks now.\n. already fixed in #190\n. Where in the docs do you see the `ng-cordova` dependency specification ?\n. I guess this is currently the expected behavior when using ng-cordova from a browser. Cordova is not available in the browser so the notification api also isn't.\n\nThe ionic team is currently working on some ideas of mock solutions for it. Here you can see some of them: #15, #10, #185\n. I'll add promises to it in just a second.\n. @pbernasconi you're welcome, any updates to the unit testing thing in #182 ?\n. Recent changes did a overhead to merge the master in, lets discuss about bringing ng-annotate into the build in #181.\n. keychain can be checked.\n. #300 adds the new googleAnalytics documentation. I think its better to not add the legacy documentation for the old ga.js plugin because we want to remove it in **v0.2.0-beta** ([mentioned here](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/issues/53#issuecomment-54536764)).\n. What do you think about these settings ?\n\n```\nroot = true\n\n[*]\nindent_style = space\nindent_size = 2\nend_of_line = lf\ncharset = utf-8\ntrim_trailing_whitespace = true\ninsert_final_newline = true\n```\n. Agree with adding https://github.com/sindresorhus/jshint-stylish ?\n. - https://github.com/PDF417/pdf417-phonegap\n- https://github.com/Scandit/BarcodeScannerPlugin\n\nI'm not really familiar with pdf scanners, so may you can suggestion one of them @shepherdsiduli ? \n. @pbernasconi, may we can add the https://github.com/PDF417/pdf417-phonegap plugin to #262 ?\n. here we go, fixed the merges.\n. So what is the use case for checking the availability of a plugin? May you can provide a whole code example. Just try to figure out if its necessary for more users of ngCordova.  \n. This is done with promises. Look up the recent documentation PR here how to use it:\nhttps://github.com/mrzmyr/ng-cordova/blob/02207355af32c426658829aee43b044ef6877591/docs/index.md#cordovabackgroundgeolocation\n. Its already on the roadmap for v0.1.4-alpha in #176.\n. Cool then, lets wait for the refactoring. Will you also include the documentation in your refactoring ?\n. Should we put into the v0.2.0-beta release, because of a **breaking change** or just put it in the v0.1.4-alpha release ?\n. ups, yep. \n. may we add #282 (WebIntent) and #283 (Zip)?\n. +1\n. `.travis.yml`\n\n```\nlanguage: node_js\nnode_js:\n  - \"0.10\"\nbefore_install:\n  - npm install -g gulp bower\n  - bower install\n  - npm install\n```\n\n`package.json`\n\n```\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"test\": \"gulp karma --browsers=PhantomJS --reporters=progress\",\n}\n```\n. As you can see [here](https://github.com/mrzmyr/ng-cordova/commit/943bf87584c1b02c67e600a1e18d9b7484e3fe8d#diff-1a523bd9fa0dbf998008b37579210e12R1314) the `openDBBackground` method was dropped, so you can use it like in the docs before except for the `openDBBackground` method you have to use [this migration](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/277#issue-42383488).\n. I'll come up with unit tests for it, so this is not happening again first. Atfer this the change will be coming. \n. Resolving just is working with one parameter, tho. So when you need **tx** and **res** we need to combine it into a object like this: \n\n``` js\ndb.transaction(function (tx) {\n  tx.executeSql(query, binding, function (tx, result) {\n    q.resolve({\n      transaction: tx,\n      result: result\n    });\n  }, function (transaction, error) {\n    q.reject({\n      transaction: transaction,\n      error: error\n    });\n  });\n});\n```\n\n**Usage** would be:\n\n``` js\n$cordovaSQLite.execute(db, query, binding)\n  .then(function (response) {\n    result = response.result;\n    // console.log(response.transaction);\n  }, function (response) {\n    error = response.error;\n    // console.log(response.transaction);\n  });\n```\n\n@PavelPolyakov, @pbernasconi What you think about it ?\n\nImplementation of it can be found here: https://github.com/mrzmyr/ng-cordova/commit/50cf139de19ae3ad3a7a8238a56502e89bd71e73\n. I don't think this is how to resolve it. May you can ignore the `ngCordova.min.js` path in the grunt-wiredep plugin ?\n. Ok i didn't know that the bower specs are saying to not include minified files. \nThanks for the hint then. \n. +1, I'll implemented it the coming days.\n. So I will add a deprecation warning  to the PR that the nested function will be removed in v0.2.0-beta.\n. This needs some more investigation about the new API, so I'll watch out how to make the new API supporting the old one.\n. I think this is fixed unit #296 is merged.\n. +1\n. We maybe can think about separating the plugins to $cordovaFile and $cordovaFileTransfer to make it more clear, and for sure the docs need to get better at the $cordovaFile thing also. \n. Here you go: #304\n. Its better to rename it to `$cordovaGoogleAnalytics`, because even google not call it `ga.js` anymore. Please wait with the merge unit it.\n. Now its ready for merging. :+1: \n. @mzbyszynski :+1: \n. @tkempf yeah that was my fault, I think in the `ngCordovaMocks` module the usual angular services are not included so we have to declare them specifically. \n\nBefore: `var $mocksInjector = angular.injector(['ngCordovaMocks']);`\nAfter: `var $mocksInjector = angular.injector(['ng', 'ngCordovaMocks']);`\n\nLet me know if it works for you.\n. I think this need to be implemented first into the [google-analytics-plugin](https://github.com/danwilson/google-analytics-plugin/tree/master).\n. May we should close this. I'll create a new PR for it which is mergeable.\n. Hey @Freundschaft, the reason is that `$cordovaLocalNotification.onclick` [is a function](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/localNotification.js#L103-L105). This is a bug and a mistake in the implementation I think. \n\nSo there are two solutions how to solve that (by the implementation):\n\nAlias the function ([`localNotification.js:103`](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/localNotification.js#L103))\n\n``` js\nonclick: window.plugin.notification.local.onclick,\n```\n\nThe usage of this would be how you expected it would be:\n`$cordovaLocalNotification.onclick = function (id, state, json) {`\n\n---\n\nOr use Angular events for it:\n\n``` js\nvar scope = $rootScope.$new();\n\n// assign all functions to the scope\nscope. getTriggeredIds = function () { ... }\n\n// use angular events\nwindow.plugin.notification.local.onclick = function (id, state, json) {\n    scope.$broadcast('click', id, state, json)\n};\n\nreturn scope;\n```\n\nThe usage would be like:\n\n``` js\n$cordovaLocalNotification.$on('click', function (event, id, state, json) {\n   console.log(event, id, state, json);\n});\n```\n\n@pbernasconi, what do you think ?\n. As i saw in #166, this may requires @perrygovier help ?\n. Hey @vovikdrg, I think you are right when you mean the [`camera.js`](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/mocks/camera.js) plugin. Other plugins like [`device.js`](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/mocks/device.js) already have the possibility to setup the mocks you need from outside. \n\nIf you have a good idea how to setup mock data in the `getPicture` function a PR is appreciated.\n. In terms of you [comment here](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/issues/53#issuecomment-54536764). May its about the v0.2.0-beta or is it now brought over to the v0.1.5-alpha version?\n. :+1:\n. Hey @gruppjo, we also had a discussion about it in #261 and resolved it with #274.\nSo as you can see in [`bower.json`](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/bower.json#L12) there is just the non-minified version speicifed.\n\nDo you consume the last version of ngCordova ?\n. @gruppjo, close issue ?\n. Ok you have to do it. Just press the \"Close Issue\" button on the bottom of the text field. \n. The first error you get (\"_browser testing i get a Cannot_...\") is expected because cordova is not available in desktop browsers. Further reading: #307  \n. So one of the possible solutions would be to just use the `$injector` to avoid an DI error:\n\n``` js\nangular.module('myApp', []).controller('myCtrl', function ($injector) {\n  if (window.cordova) {\n    var $cordovaBackgroundGeolocation = $injector.get('$cordovaBackgroundGeolocation');\n  }\n})\n```\n. May you can create a new issue for it with more description and edit this issue to just target the _\"Cannot read property 'backgroundGeoLocation' of undefined\"_ Problem and close it ?\n. Add it also to #203 ?\n. Build will be successfully when #346 is merged.\n. I already got a solution for it generalized for every plugin. #307 May you want to check it out and leave a comment there.\n. I think there is already a angular plugin for it: https://github.com/AlexDisler/ng-storekit#usage\n. If I got the approach right, ngCordova tries to focus more to bring VanillaJS Cordova API's into the AngularJS world and not to integrate other AngularJS services into ngCordova. \n. Ouh ok, I think I got you wrong @EdL. I tought you want to reimplement the AngularJS service into ngCordova, but I think what you want is a 'own implementation' of the origin phonegap plugin in ngCrodova. \nI think, as @mlynch mentioned, its a idea that makes sense. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. Problem like #307 ?\n. Also related to #307 \n. Duplicate of #338 ?\n. These plugins need to be paid ? http://rjfun.github.io/\n. Probably you need to update ngCordova. It was already fixed in the last commit of the file: https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/commit/114da5522755b6efd04a2c930cc37e643307454d\n. :+1: \n. ",

Indeed, the file plugin adds some new \"high-level\" functions that are not provided by official plugins, so they need more documentation.\nI will try to propose something when I have extra free time !\n. Cordova abstracts mobile platforms, I don't think it's a good idea to adapt code for Android specific data paths.\nIt's better to use `cdvfile://localhost/persistent/files/copy.doc` for example if you want to be cross-platform.\n. I think that current nbCordova file wrapper has some problems :\n- It merges file and fileTransfer plugins, whereas others plugins have one separate file for each one.

I'm not sure about the meaning of your question, but to display an image on cordova, you have at least 2 options.\n\nYou can use real image url, but network must be reachable on device to display this image.\n\n```\n<img src=\"http://<domain_name>/<path_for_your_file>\"/>\n```\n\nYou can load it from device file system, but you have to download it (with cordova FileTransfer plugin for example) before.\n\n```\n<img src=\"cdvfile://localhost/persistent/<relative_path_for_your_downloaded_file>\"/>\n```\n. @gigablox you have managed to render images ?\n. Duplicate of #102.\n. If you are interesting in SQLite support on cordova, take a look at `persistencejs` (https://github.com/coresmart/persistencejs), which has now a cordova SQLite support.\nNo AngularJS wrapping however...\n. Feel free to contribute @stevenbarragan , you can fork, work on gh-pages branch and PR :-)\n. Why do you feel it wrong ?\n. Hello leemannd,\n\nngCordova is just calling cordova geolocation plugin, so if you don't manage to get altitude or other informations, refer to cordova geolocation plugin doc (on https://cordova.apache.org/).\nWhich version of cordova do you use ? On which device ?\n. You have tried to load binary data with readFile() and it didn't work ?\nThere is a `readAsBinaryString` function in cordova plugin file source (https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-file/blob/master/www/FileReader.js), it covers you needs ?\n. Hi,\n\nYou just have to listen to `online` and `offline` events.\nExample :\n\n```\ndocument.addEventListener(\"online\", onlineCallback, false);\ndocument.addEventListener(\"offline\", offlineCallback, false);\n```\n. Indeed, the file plugin adds some new \"high-level\" functions that are not provided by official plugins, so they need more documentation.\nI will try to propose something when I have extra free time !\n. Cordova abstracts mobile platforms, I don't think it's a good idea to adapt code for Android specific data paths.\nIt's better to use `cdvfile://localhost/persistent/files/copy.doc` for example if you want to be cross-platform.\n. I think that current nbCordova file wrapper has some problems :\n- It merges file and fileTransfer plugins, whereas others plugins have one separate file for each one. And I don't think `filePath` parameter is consistent for these 2 plugin functions : file functions need relative path, and fileTransfer functions need cdv path (to be confirmed).\n- We need some more \"high-level\" functions, like recursive create directories, ...\n\nYour wrapper seems interesting, I think it's worth to think about what can be done with it.\n.

This simple demo uses code from the ngCordova doc page and some additional sugar and window-dressing for smoke-testing use of new and existing ngCordova-defined plugins.

for example this controller:\n\n```\n  starterControllers\n.controller('ConnectionCtrl', [\n  '$scope',\n  '$log',\n  '$cordovaNetwork',\n  function($scope, $log, $cordovaNetwork) {\n\n    var connectionType = 'undefined';\n    $scope.connectiontype = connectionType;\n\n    try {\n      $log.log($cordovaNetwork.getNetwork());\n      $scope.connectiontype = $cordovaNetwork.getNetwork();\n    } catch (e) {\n      // probably:\n      // ->\n      // TypeError: Cannot read property 'type' of undefined\n      // at Object.getNetwork (file:///android_asset/www/lib/ng-cordova/dist/ng-cordova.js:851:34)\n      // ...          \n      $log.log('$cordovaNetwork.getNetwork())', e);\n    };\n\n    $scope.connectionType = function () {        \n      $scope.connectiontype = $cordovaNetwork.getNetwork();\n    };\n\n  }]);\n```\n\nfull example here: https://github.com/pellekrogholt/ionic_cordova_example_app/tree/basic_ng_cordova\n\n## ngCordova $cordovaNetwork using promises\n\nif have naively also tried an approach where I wrapped the network / navigator in a promise (inspirred by the ng-book https://www.ng-book.com):\n\nhttps://github.com/pellekrogholt/ng-cordova/blob/navigator_connection_w_promises_ticket_60/src/plugins/network.js\n\nmotivation: for curiosity and a naive thought that it was a solution but i doubt that now ? because it seems like we at an early stage have the navigator but withouth the navigator.connection ...\n\nmore to come...\n. @pbernasconi yes just close the issue - at the point of writing the issue - it was not clear to me that the call had to be wrapped with the $ionicPlatform.ready(...)\n. @pbernasconi sure done for the code/mock/demo : https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/226\n\ngh-pages comming up\n. @pbernasconi im a bit confused about pm for gb-pages i have added some stuff for datepicker in \n\nhttps://github.com/pellekrogholt/ng-cordova/blob/gh-pages_date_picker_225/docs/index.md\n\nbut when i hit the pm button i get: \n\n```\nThere isn't anything to compare.\ndriftyco:master and pellekrogholt:gh-pages_date_picker_225 are entirely different commit histories.\n```\n. @pbernasconi you are wellcome thx back - anyway what about the gh-pages my git kong fu seems to be lacking something...\n. ok i gave it another shoot:\n\n```\n$ git fetch upstream\n\n$ git co gh-pages\n\n$ git pull upstream gh-pages\n\n$ git push origin gh-pages\n```\n\nnow make a branch and do some changes\n\n```\n$ git co -b gh-pages_date_picker_225_ng_3\n```\n\nare we on an up to date branch\n\n```\n$ git log -2 --reverse\ncommit 0711b83a86e0ae7a6b8d6f2cebe303f198521cfa\nAuthor: Paolo Bernasconi <paolo.enrico.bernasconi@gmail.com>\nDate:   Thu Sep 4 16:32:54 2014 +0200\n\n    fix(docs): ugly Flashlight fixing\n\ncommit 404b16de5ca5e66d36621b25df09ebf68078f19a\nAuthor: Paolo Bernasconi <paolo.enrico.bernasconi@gmail.com>\nDate:   Thu Sep 4 16:55:09 2014 +0200\n\nfeat(docs): added Media Plugin\n```\n\nchanges\n\n```\n$ git ci . -m \"some documentation for the datepicker #225\"\n\n\n$ git push origin gh-pages_date_picker_225_ng_3\n```\n\nback to git hub and make pm but still get \n\n```\nThere isn't anything to compare.\n\ndriftyco:master and pellekrogholt:gh-pages_date_picker_225_ng_3 are entirely different commit histories.\n```\n\nhmm i'll give it another shoot later -

I'll be happy to take a look at this issue then (without code, it's hard to see where the problem is).\n. @apla I like this idea.  I want to look further at your plugin and possibly include it in the next minor version of ngCordova.  \n. Please fork the gh-pages branch of this repo and include your proposed changes in the documentation and create a pull request. I'll be happy to look/merge this in at that time.\n. @cfjedimaster Do you have any suggestions for naming?\n. This changes the style too much from the other plugin wrappers. If you change all of them to use the same standard style; I'll take a look.\n. Can you pull the most recent version of this repo; and if it doesn't work include a minimal reproduction that we can use to reproduce and fix this issue? Thanks!\n. If you need to create a wrapper; the best thing I can suggest is for you to look at any of the existing wrappers and then look at the code they wrap.  \n\nIn my case; I wrote a wrapper recently for a plugin that's not yet in the core of this project:\n\nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/commit/f07176e606d32cf6ff3220e8fcc498c0181c2ef4\n\nThe biggest gotchas I've encountered is that sometimes the cordova plugins are continuous (they may trigger the success callback multiple times); but angularJS promises only resolve once; which means you may need to rely on the 'notify' condition and write custom code to determine when a promise should actually resolve.  This should follow the spirit of the plugin you're wrapping. An example of where I had to do that is referenced in issue #885.  \n\nLet me know if you have any more questions about this.\n\nAlso, we have a file plugin; let me know if that's not what you need: https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/file.js\n. Please fix the errors; rebase and submit a new PR from the current version.\n. Interesting. Sounds like an issue with the underlying plugin and not ngCordova?\n. Not quite sure what you need to be added as a new feature. Can you go into more detail about the use case?\n. the plugin does need to be included through normal cordova means.\n. Could you include a project that reproduces this issue with the latest versions?\n. You're using the deprecated plugin; try it with $cordovaPushV5 and let me know how it goes?\n. Please update and reissue this PR.\n. Good to know, will add updating this for the next version.\n. That's great! Thanks.  We'll have to continue to use the free version for obvious reasons; thanks for your effort. I'm disappointed your work isn't licensed in a fashion where we can include it in an open source project; but I understand your position.\n. Thanks for letting us know. If you can put together a pull request, I'd be happy to include it in a future version.\n. Please update; rebase and re-issue your pull request.\n.

Since there have been docs changes, please rebase and re-issue this PR.\n. @bruno-serfe I added support for the new plugin in #984, also covered in issue #963.\n. Closed with the resolution of #963.\n. 0.1.17-alpha is on npm.  Do you still need 0.1.14-alpha on npm for a specific reason?\n\n`npm view ng-cordova`\n. merged.\n. At the moment, there are conflicts. not your fault; but please rebase and re-issue this PR.\n. Is this still an issue with the latest version?\n. Since this is a dupe of #506, closing.\n. It'd help if you could write the wrapper for this and include a pull request for it. It'd definitely get added sooner.  Otherwise I'll add it to the 'new plugin' label and will get to it when possible. \n. Not sure of the actual question being posed here. Can you help me out by explaining the issue?   Not all plugins support all platforms; we're just the wrappers for the plugins themselves; so if you would like to write a cordova plugin that works the same across platforms, that'd be an awesome cordova plugin to have, and we'd love to have a wrapper made for it once that happens.\n. Could you include a Minimal Complete, verifiable example in code?  I'd love to fix this if you can reproduce it and share the code that reproduces this issue with us.\n. Why the WIP and not pulling the latest version? The WIP Branch is pretty old.\n. I would love to add this plugin, but there's been updates so I need you to rebase and re-issue this PR.  Also, if you could include a gh-pages documentation PR that includes some docs on this plugin, that'd be really helpful and ensure it gets better adoption.\n. Thanks!\n. If you could create a pull request with the mocks for this; that'd be helpful.  Since there are a number of plugins we support, we rely on individual contributions to keep the project going.   Otherwise it'd be one of those \"When we're able to get to it\" sort of things, which may be different than your time table.\n. Most of these issues have been resolved with newer PRs; please rebase and check out the additions from master. The only outstanding issue might be the variable naming. Check it out.\n. If you could include a sample project that reproduces this issue with the latest version, I'd be happy to re-open this issue.\n. Could you include a pull request fixing the docs on this?\n. That's awesome!  Since it looks like you're the plugin author, you'd be the best person to write the wrapper for that plugin. if you can write the wrapper and include it as a pull request, we'd be happy to have it.\n. If you update to the latest version, does this still happen? If so, please include a link to a repro of this problem in a sample project.\n. Can you include a project that reproduces this issue that I can pull from and use to test?\n. Looks like the tests failed; please rebase and re-issue this PR.\n. @kylelib  If you're using Angular (which ngCordova depends on), then you simply use the DI syntax to have $window be injected:\n\n```\nangular.module('ngCordova.plugins.myPlugin', [])\n        .factory('$cordovaMyPlugin', ['$q', '$window', function ($q, $window) {\n            return {\n                get: function() {\n                    var q = $q.defer();\n                    $window.plugins.myPlugin.get(function (result) {\n                        q.resolve(result);\n                    }, function(error) {\n                        q.reject(error);\n                    });\n                    return q.promise;\n                }\n            };\n        }]);\n```\n. Seems like we'd need a better API for this than just 'connect'. other plugins have separate API calls for the act of connecting, the act of reconnecting, disconnecting, and reporting whether or not we're still connected.    I'm not sure how to fix it either; but I'll chew on it.\n. Thanks for doing this. This change makes sense.\n. Written at different times, probably by different people; I'm sure there's a reason; but I'm not seeing an actual problem to solve here.  Consistency would be nice; but lower on our list than other issues currently.\n. If you look at issue #885 ; I show a few commits where I had to create a wrapper for a cordova plugin. It was the first time I created a wrapper.  That's going to be the fastest way to get this integrated.  Create the wrapper and submit a pull request for it.  \n. If you use the push plugin without the wrapper, does it work? If so, please provide a sample project that uses both ways (with our $cordovaPush and without), so that we can fix the issue in the wrapper if it turns out the wrapper code is the problem. If you use this code on an iOS or Android device, does it work?\n. Thanks for letting us know. Please include a pull request with these fixes and I'll be happy to merge them in!\n. @zmijevik Can you include a codepen that reproduces the issue? Or link to a minimal github repo that reproduces the issue?\n. That's annoying. I'll add a note to normalize and make all of this consistent for a future release.  (if you'd like to speed that process along, feel free to pull and create a pull request that does this!).\n. You're right, I read this issue differently.  I don't know where the code for the custom builder is, but I'll find it and let you know. I ways assumed it was part of the build tasks for this repo.\n. Rejected in favor of #836; I like this approach, but $q.notify is real-time; even if it doesn't resolve the promise until the $timeout occurs. a possible way around that would be another function that immediately if a specific device is found, like `find`.\n. Thank you!\n. Since we're on 0.1.17; this seems like not something to worry about any more.  I'm sorry if that caused any issues.\n. Thanks for sharing this. It could be  a bug in the underlying plugin; if you can provide code using the wrapper and just using the plugin without the wrapper and it turns out the bug is in the ngCordova code; we'll be happy to fix it. We don't really have the bandwidth to fork and fix the underlying plugins themselves.\n. Sometimes the API for the plugins is not fully fleshed out; you can definitely submit a pull request that fleshes it out more.\n. I've not used the OAuth plugin myself, but my guess is that you'd set up a proxy for your device through something you have fiddler attached to and watch the traffic and make sure the headers are correct.  I'll be happy to accept a pull request when you're ready for us to take a look at it.\n. Can you include a Minimal Complete Verifiable eXample (A sample project that reproduces this issue)? If you create it as a git repo, I'd be happy to pull, run, and see the issue so we can fix it.\n. If you can include a sample project that reproduces this issue and uses both the wrapper and the underlying plugin without the wrapper (and shows which works and which doesn't), we'll be happy to take a look at this.\n. Please include a sample project that reproduces this issue.  I don't see this issue in 0.1.17.\n. Please update, rebase, and re-issue this PR.\n. It'd be awesome if all mocks worked in the browser;  sadly we haven't yet written code for all of them to work in the browser. If you'd like to help us by adding one for toast, I'd be happy to accept a PR.\n. This would seem to be 'working as designed' since the plugins are namespaced to the `ngCordova.plugins.` namespace.  I could also be looking at this wrong.\n. @mlynch Are there any JSHint or JSlint specific settings this project uses to ensure code style remains the same?\n. Thank you!\n. This would be great. If you have a plugin you can suggest; please include a link to it.  Also, if you could help us out by writing a wrapper, I list out how to do that in #885; otherwise I'll put it on the backlog once you've provided a link to a plugin that does this that we should write a wrapper for.\n. Have you used ngCordovaMocks for browser work?  \n. Can you reproduce this issue and include a new issue with the reproduction vs. what should happen? This feels very 'hardcode'-y to me, and I want to make sure we're not introducing regressions with adding this PR.\n. Are you having an issue with ngCordova?  If so, please provide a sample project that reproduces the issue you're seeing and I'll be happy to re-open this issue.\n. What do you mean by alarms?\n. If you write a PR that has this fix in it, I'd be happy to take a look and merge it in!\n. Yea; it seems like there would need to be a Cordova plugin written for this; then we could add a wrapper on top of that. are there any cordova plugins you know of that do this that we should include support for?\n. This was already resolved in #750. Thanks for helping; theirs just got merged first.  Not your fault; we're just catching up with all the PRs and chose that one because it's a little more extensive.\n. Yes; filter is currently busted. I've added a fix for this in PR #891. Thanks for catching this!\n. If you could include a sample project that reproduces this issue, I'll be happy to take a closer look. Also specify which platform this is failing for (iOS, android).\n. Thanks for this reproduction. I'll take a look and let you know.\n. It's supposed to fail in the browser; better would be to add a $q.reject if we're in a browser; or add  a mock that can be called in the browser.\n. Please include a sample project that reproduces this issue and we'll be able to take a look more quickly.\n. Could you include the file you're referring to as well as the commit you're referring to?\n. It's entirely possible that there's a bug in the wrapper code; could you put together a minimal reproduction of this issue along with what you expect to happen so that I can look into it further for you?  If you can include that code here, I'll re-open the issue and look into what fix is necessary.\n\nThank you!\n. I'm really sorry that happened. We love PRs that help fix the docs; could you include a PR with the documentation fix? You're probably the best person to do it since you were just working on this issue.

Could you provide a minimal reproduction of this issue in a sample project? I'll be happy to take a look at the underlying code.\n.

Please include a sample project that reproduces this issue. once you do that, I'll be happy to re-open.\n. If you can include a sample project that reproduces this issue; I'll be happy to take a look.  I do know that generally cordova isn't loaded in the browser, so it won't be defined.  \n. Since ngcordova v2 is now Ionic native that this isn't a thing anymore?\n. Please update, rebase, and re-issue this PR. There are conflicts currently.\n. Closing as the initial issue brought up is not an ngCordova issue (turns out the $ionicPlatform.ready call was required).  @dangnelson If you can open a separate issue with a reproducible snippet for the $cordovaKeyboard.disableScroll() issue, we'll be happy to take a look.\n. I don't know why this was removed either. Will include it.\n. If you write a PR that includes a wrapper for this; that'd ensure it'd get included much more quickly. Thanks!\n.

It's located on the gh-pages branch of this Repo. see the 'contributing.md' doc in the root of this Repo for more directions.\n. Thanks for doing this.\n. So what you're saying is, we need a plugin we can trust?  That sounds like a good place to start. :-)\n. Thanks for catching this. Please submit a PR for this with the fixed documentation.\n. Could you put together a minimal reproduction of this issue here or in a github repo that I can pull to investigate this issue for you?  I'll re-open this when you do that. (something that I can pull; build, and put on my phone to check this issue out).\n. This would probably cause confusion with the advent of multiple BLE plugins; but we need a better way to handle abandoned plugins vs. active plugins. Perhaps including this in a new major version of NgCordova? as Cordova 5 compatible? Anyone else have any thoughts on this?\n. https://github.com/randdusing/BluetoothLE is the plugin; the wrapper is available through the first comment link; I'd clean it up before adding it.   \n\nI'd like for there to be an easier way for users to be able to see what plugins are supported at their Cordova level; it'd save a lot of heartache; but it does add some complexity on our part.\n. It wasn't until two days ago that an outstanding PR #751 was merge; so I was thinking the evothings was the actual under the hood plugin, and it didn't support Cordova 4.0+; and that led me to creating the wrapper for this plugin.  Since then, i've added a few features to this plugin; notably how to search for specific devices; but that's nothing that couldn't be replicated. \n. The BluetoothSerial is for serial communication over bluetooth; and the ble.js wrapper is the standard BLE wrapper; we don't need multiples of them, you're right. \n\nI'll continue using the bluetoothle plugin (the custom one in my repo), and will put docs around it.\n. Cordova Plugins don't work in the browser.\n. Yea; the submodule can be confusing, and due to the flurry of recent PRs; you'll need to update, rebase, and re-issue this PR; but thank you for making this work.\n. Thanks for this.  Could you help us out by forking the gh-pages branch of this repo, adding the fix to the documentation there, and submitting a pull request? \n\nThanks again!\n. Please include a minimal example that reproduces the issue you're seeing so that we can help you resolve this issue.  If you do that, I'll be happy to re-open.\n. If you submit a pull request for this, we'd be happy to accept.\n. Using notify for this makes sense; if you'd like to put together a pull request, we'd be happy to accept.  \n\nI also had to do this for the custom plugin wrapper I wrote for the bluetoothle.js (not the ble.js that you know and love); that commit is here: https://github.com/Jewelbots/ng-cordova/commit/88463cb6b2adf09b052c362c5928b4d9223c2f1f\n\nI also wrote a more complex version of that so for another function here: \nhttps://github.com/Jewelbots/ng-cordova/commit/8fe7866eea4234d8e3d0442469ceac2ff95a46a0\n\nI'll close this; and submit a pull request for this issue and we'll handle it there.\n. Please update, rebase and reissue this PR; as there are conflicts.\n. One of the reasons I bring this up is that I'm always getting merge conflicts in the dist/ related items due to builds.\n. Can you share a minimal reproduction of this issue ? The code necessary for me to reproduce it?\n. If you include a sample project that reproduces this issue, we'll be happy to take a look.\n. I'll take a look, thanks for reporting this.\n. Hm.  I'll dig into this deeper; I'm able to reproduce this issue.\n. PRs welcome; please submit one for this fix.\n. Thank you!\n. This seems like there are two PRs here, one for docs, and one for updating all cordova plugin namings; since I'd like to test those independently, please split the fix out; one that renames the cordova installation plugins, and one that fixes the media docs.\n\nThank you for doing this work!\n. I like the idea, one issue is stability. \n. I think we're going to collect more data on this; think of the oAuth module as the test subject.  We need to hold off on making this a wider thing until we've got a rock solid deployment and regression check process around submodules. \n. @matheusrocha89 http://38.media.tumblr.com/8eb1eb849b8b5fb2452bb74a697900a0/tumblr_mzvc3qNsII1t7xe6go1_400.gif\n. @nraboy  I see 3.9 on npm; I don't see a 4.0 yet.https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp\n. > Unless Ionic gets a fleet of internal developers working on this project, ngCordova will only be as good as the contributions it receives. \n\nThat's true; and that's why I want people to give us PRs instead of just raising issues.  It's easy to say, \"you need to do this\", it's harder to say, \"This is an issue; and I don't know how to help, but I want to.\"\n\nngCordova only succeeds if we do the latter.  If this were a project with one or two plugins, that'd be one thing -- but ngCordova supports lots of plugin wrappers for 64+ plugins; not all of which have community support behind them.\n\nSubmodules mean not knowing when there's an unstable build; and with the free time we have, it can't be spent tracking down unstable builds because a submodule was updated and we have no Issue tracking/commit tracking in this repository to see what changed upstream.  It'd be great if the tooling were there, but it's not.\n\n> The last few months have proven not so good. For example, isn't SQLite still majorly broken in ngCordova?\n\nThe last few months haven't been so awesome; you're right. That's partly why I stepped up.  I rely on ngCordova, and I'm not the only one.  I bet there are dozens of companies building Apps that need what ngCordova provides.  We've got to ensure ngCordova is stable. If you rely on ngCordova, then your help is desired.  Submit PRs, even if it's just a PR to make documentation better.\n\nAs far as last night's submodule fun, I won't just be merging PRs to mainline; and there will be development branches; more on that to come.   I'm still on week one here; so expect a little shakiness.\n\nAs far as SQLite goes; I'm using that plugin next, so unless someone else gets to it first, I'll be able to see pretty quickly what's broken with it.  \n\nPart of this being an open source project means that anyone who can read these pages can help make it better.   Be the change you wish to see in the world.\n. You'll need to rebase and cherrypick commit 4b33a4f; the other commit is still in this PR.\n. Looks like the oAuth submodule is in a broken state. @nraboy?\n. At this time, install0.1.17, I'm not near a PC; but if you remove the oAuth module, you'll also be Ok.\n. v0.1.19-alpha has been pushed that has this PR in it.\n. I think this is great; but it's a bit daunting because there aren't any docs around it. We do have the gh-pages branch; it'd be really, really, really useful if you could put together some examples and docs around how to use this for inclusion in our docs.\n. @DanailMinchev @beauby 's comments are spot on.\n. @beauby is correct; we haven't always adhered to it.   We are now because someone brought it up now;  it's an organic thing.  We're really appreciative of your work @DanailMinchev; thank you.\n. Thanks for doing this; can you update and re-issue this PR against the `dev-next` branch? I'm happy to include it, but going forward want to put in all features to a dev branch first.\n. fixed with tag v0.1.19-alpha.\n. @barryvdh I like this idea because it would also show the relative popularity of each plugin. As it stands right now all plugins are equally included, meaning that we don't really know if there's one user of a plugin or a thousand.  By putting these wrappers in different Repos; we'd have a better sense of which are used and which are just (and should be) abandoned.  The downside (of course) is from a maintenance standpoint; because I'd be subscribed to 60+ repos to make changes. That could get ugly fast. \n\nThat said, If it makes it easier to de-lineate which plugins are supported by which version of Cordova /  ngCordova, then I'm all about it.  \n\nI'd rather a one-repo different branches for versions; but even that has its own issues; as does keeping it all in one repo yet having version files as metadata and having the build system create all plugins which are compatible with each version.\n. @barryvdh  I don't quite understand your last comment; can you expand on it? \n\n>  and set an example so that other people can just make their own plugins on their own repo if they want.\n. @barryvdh  That makes sense. One reason we don't do that currently are when things like the oAuth module are changed and regression, people could blame us even though we have no control over that.  If there were separate repos, I'd probably insist on keeping a small group of maintainers around them with either DriftyCo or Jewelbots organizational control (or a separate organization created for this).\n\n@mlynch has stated publicly that the next version of ngCordova won't rely on Angular Promises and won't be tied to angular 1.x; and that's awesome -- except that there will be businesses (I'm thinking of Jewelbots, but there are probably others) that won't upgrade right away, so we may have months or a year of people still relying on ngCordova, and I don't want to leave them out in the cold.\n\nWhen you have an App that you're using to push business revenue; it becomes very costly to rewrite that app because a new version came out; and the more I look at talks of Angular2, Ionic2, and ngCordova2, the more I see no easy upgrade path; which is problematic for businesses.\n\nI say all that to say that no matter what, I'm going to be around ngCordova 1.0 for a while yet (at least until the middle of next year); so any plans we have have to take into account that other businesses will be too.\n. Awesome.  This will be pulled in for the next release.\n. Sorry about this; I had to fix a GHPages issue; and so your PR was closed automatically because of that; resubmit? \n. correct; my fault.\n. Thanks for doing this; please update and re-issue this PR against the `dev-next` branch; as that will contain the new plugins.\n. We've talked about this elsewhere, specifically in #873.  What to do about hosting different versions of Cordova compatible plugins?  This requires a little design work and some thought, but I have some ideas around this. In the meantime; the best way to get a plugin included (no matter if it exists or not), is to create a PR that has an implementation + docs for that implementation.  \n. Yea; lets stay away from that as much as possible (same with 'newMedia' [just learned my lesson there]). As a working title, $cordovaPushv5 would work; we'll rebase if the better solution comes along before you're done with your PR.\n. Yea; it appears this change was made in PR #871;  Errgh.\n. For whatever reason this still has conflicts with the build; try again? You probably need to fetch; rebase interactively, and squash your commits to one; also it appears you may have pulled in between so that's why we're seeing so many changes over and above what you've actually done.\n. Thanks for doing this; my only question is around the extensive use of attaching to `$rootScope`; I haven't used this plugin wrapper in particular, but it doesn't seem like it _has_ to be that way; nor would that be the preferred method.\n\nDoes this plugin require that? Or was it done for expediency?  \n. The reason why I bring up rootScope is that anything that relies on Angular 1.x will potentially have to change for ngCordova2 (which won't be dependent on Angular).\n. Since .DS_Store was removed, what to do about when that gets included again? Where should that be handled?\n. I like this, but I'm a little worried about it, so I'll hang on to this for the next release.\n. Also, please issue this PR against `dev-next`.\n. Most of these look great; my question is on this diff:\n\n```\n-  cordova plugin add de.appplant.cordova.plugin.local-notification\n+ cordova plugin add https://github.com/katzer/cordova-plugin-local-notifications.git\n```\n\nIs there a specific reason to target the github repo master repo instead of a published release?\n. I've been added to the npm deploy; I'll push one out today.\n. I'll issue a release to npm once the PR #932 is done on Travis-CI.  It'll be a new release.\n. Done. v0.1.20-alpha is on npm and bower.\n. I'm not a fan of output files being checked in, but this project is set up such that they are accessible to the end user (reason is so people don't have to build project from master to get current version). \nIt's a headache, so when I merge this PR, I'll generate a build so that master is up to date.\n. OAuth will be removed from version 0.2.0. (next release); I'll include notes on how to install it if you want it.\n. Can you make this pr to the dev-next branch?\n. This was done in #957; so closing this one.\n. This is great; can you make this PR against dev-next branch?\n. I'll be in the next version of ngCordova; which will also be the same version that removes the OAuth submodule. \n. @newelement OAuth submodule? Only if you want to.\n. Can you provide a sample repo that reproduces this issue? \n. It's hard to help you without you providing me with a sample repo I can use to look through this problem with you. Without that it's just me guessing at possibilities.\n. You should put the code used to do this on github in a minimal example so I can build and run it on my own device; and then I can see what you're seeing and see if it's a problem in Code.  You can also try running the Cordova plugin directly without the ngCordova extensions to see if it's an ngCordova bug or a cordova plugin bug.\n. I'm glad this was solved.  I know it seems painful; but there are so many  moving parts that a problem can be caused by half a dozen things;  asking for a clean repo helps ensure that we're not chasing ghosts.\n. What device are you testing against in Android and what is the Android version on that device?  Can you provide a link to a clean repo that reproduces this issue?\n\nDo you still see this issue if you use the cordova-progressIndicator directly without the ngCordova wrapper?\n. Can you make this PR off the current dev branch? Dev-next?\n. @mhartington I'll investigate and do another release.\n. Likes like Bower's [PR #1852](https://github.com/bower/bower/pull/1852) broke this because we do a lot of prereleases;  I'll issue a non-prerelease version of the mainline, that _should_ resolve this issue.\n. I updated to 1.5.2 and was able to install ngCordova without any issues; I'll still issue a general release for everyone on 1.5.1; but I'm surprised I didn't get this error in 1.5.2.\n. Ah, they reverted the behavior in 1.5.2 to be the 'old' behavior, so pre-release branches work again: https://github.com/bower/bower/issues/1896\n\nThat's why 1.5.2 works and 1.5.1 doesn't.  \n. Thanks; this is really helpful. would you consider putting this into docs form and adding it to the plugin wrapper docs for the Facebook plugin?\n. Can you provide a link to a github repo that reproduces this issue minimally?  ionic start myApp blank and provide the code that you see caues this? It'll help us investigate and fix this issue if it's in ngCordova faster.\n\nAnother question to ask; do you see this when you use the cordova plugin directly, instead of the wrapper?\n. Can you base this PR off of dev-next?  That's the branch we're using to merge PRs into.\n. Thanks!\n. I'm looking into it today. I'll let you know.\n. I'm writing the wrapper for this plugin today; shouldln't take too long.  It'll go into the next version.\n. Debugging it now. Will push when it's ready.\n. I had some trouble getting my Push Notifications working through Parse's service; hence the trouble.  That'll be a separate plugin; but for now here's the plugin I'm using. There's some cleanup I need to do before adding it in, but it's available here: https://github.com/Jewelbots/ng-cordova/\n. When the docs are cleaned up and everything's added in, I'll submit a PR.\n. @fazermokeur It'll be going into dev-next shortly, and will be part of the 0.1.21-alpha release.\n. @razmik it's available now if you use bower's branch resolution against 'Dev-next', I'm currently running against Dev-next for our production work. I'll likely push out a release Tuesday or Wednesday of this week, depending on feedback.\n. @paulogr I'm not qualified to answer that. We have parse for our backend push (ionic push wasn't out yet) and I modified the push plugin to work with parse; I don't know if something similar works with the ionic push plugin or if you can use it out of the box. @mhartington? \n. the wrapper here works with the push plugin. i didn't have to change this wrapper on my own repo that allows for it to integrate with parse because parse requires changes to the underlying plugin to work, not the wrapper. I don't know what other BaaS's do, so I can't speak to their needs for the underlying plugin.\n. @philmerrell Was hoping for more feedback than just my usage of it.\n. @seenimurugan It's in v0.1.22-alpha, I'm not sure what you're referring to, can you link me to the file where it should be (but isn't)?\n. @seenimurugan That's why I wanted you to link to the file; I couldn't find it to see where it should have been added. You're right, it' an oversight it wasn't added. I'll add it and increment the release so bower and NPM pick it up.\n. This will be resolved when #1064 is merged, and I'll push out a new tag.   v0.1.23-alpha it will be. Some day I'll be able to make a build without having to make 3 builds to fix that build. Someday.\n. pushed and merged. Let me know if you still run into an issue.\n. This is great; can you base this PR off of dev-next?  That's the dev branch we use to ensure everything is good before going into master.\n. Yea, I also had an issue with the sql-lite plugin. If you can, rebase your changes off the current state of the `dev-next` branch; and reissue the PR.\n. Nice catch. I hadn't checked there. ::sheepish grin::.\n. @ptarjan That's the right place; I hadn't been using the release function; I should have been.  For 0.1.21-alpha I'll make sure to use that functionality. Sorry about that.\n. Please PR this into dev-next; that's where all PRs should go.\n. Please PR  this into dev-next; that's where all PRs should go.\n. Thanks!\n. Please fix the failing test and re-issue the PR? You'll probably wnat to rebase off of the current state of the branch.\n\nPhantomJS 1.9.8 (Linux 0.0.0) Service: $cordovaToast should call window's plugins.toast.showWithOptions method FAILED\n    showWithOptions() method does not exist\nPhantomJS 1.9.8 (Linux 0.0.0): Executed 144 of 271 (1 FAILED) (0 secs / 0.28 secs)\n. Make the fix, rebase your branch on dev-next latest and fixup the commits, and then issue the new PR from that.  Thanks again.\n. This is also covered in issue #750; and it's an issue we also experience in the (different) BluetoothLE plugin wrapper we use at @Jewelbots: https://github.com/Jewelbots/ng-cordova-bluetoothle.\n\nSome plugins handle this through an eventing system, using `$rootScope.emit` instead of returning a value from a promise resolution: \n\nhttps://github.com/gortok/ng-cordova/blob/phonegap-push-plugin-addition/src/plugins/push_v5.js#L21\n\nBut we also seemingly fixed this issue in [https://github.com/tubaman/ng-cordova/commit/e28650183a5e1b206c9cefee75c2454644636f6a](this commit) for scan; it appears this should also be used for the `startNotification` function?\n. @mhartington #750 and #836 targeted the same bit of code; the code in question here is a different bit (startNotification vs. scan); so the code in #750 would need to be added for the `startNotification` function for this to be resolved.\n. @mhartington No. I'm currently integrating the wrapper for the push plugin; Expected that to be finished soon, and if no one jumps on it before then I can take a look at this.\n. @don That's a great point.  It's also something I've struggled with, promises are the new hotness but they don't catch these sorts of situations.  Observerables are obviously preferred; and are generally done using $rootScope.emit() / $rootScope.on() in AngularJS 1.x. This is probably the route we should go for the BLE wrapper; much like this: https://github.com/gortok/ng-cordova/blob/phonegap-push-plugin-addition/src/plugins/push_v5.js#L21\n. @don That's a really good point. Perhaps we could dynamically register events to listen for, instead of the hardcoding that's done in the push plugin? \n. Could you put this in dev-next? That's the branch we use for future releases.\n. Can you rebase this off of the current state of dev-next? and resubmit this PR?\n. There are branch conflicts; so you'll have to rebase and try again.  If I did it I wouldn't be able to get it in until next release.\n. Nice; can you make this PR into dev-next? That's the branch we use to base new releases off of.\n. Please rebase dev-next and resubmit off of current state of dev-next\n. Please rebase off of dev-next and resubmit from the current state of dev next.\n. You'd have to show what you code you tried with the empty `find` that caused an issue. We're currently using the empty find and haven't encountered an issue with it.  See also, this commit: https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/commit/ebac7e53f27ff3f839540757874f9d2cc088bf7c\n. Is this backwards compatible with how people were doing it before? Since it replaces an object that is passed in with a value?\n. Yea; we need to make it backwards compatible or I'll need to change the major version number; could you add those backwards compatibility checks?\n. Please fix the issues outlined in the travisCI Build, and rebase off of the current state of dev-next.\n. Please squash and re-issue this PR; the Travis CI build failed. If you click on the link it'll tell you why. Make sure you run jshint before trying to issue the PR; that sometimes trips people up.\n. Please submit this to dev-next instead of master, as per the CONTRIBUTING.md.\n. Please re-issue this PR against the dev-next branch.\n. Please re-issue this PR against the dev-next branch.\n. The CI build failed; looks like you need to run your code through our js-hint build first. Once you do that, pelase target your PR to devnext\n. PLease submit this to `dev-next`, and make sure you grab the latest from the dev-next branch.\n. Could you target this towards devnext?\n. I haven't tried this on iOS9 yet; I will. But it looks like the underlying plugin is the issue.\n. @jgsacris Which version are you using?\n. I meant, what version of this Cordova plugin, and what version of ngCordova?\n. This should be a doc update.\n. I've got a Parse.com plugin for Push; and it works with iOS; but I haven't tried using it with Android.  What   plugin are you using (not the wrapper, but the plugin) to integrate with Parse.com?\n\nThe one I'm using is not open source yet; although I need to open source it.\n. Push_v5 relies on the new Phonegap push plugin, not the deprecated one; it's important to note that. If you're using the deprecated plugin, it's not supported so if it even works, that's a miracle.\n. Can you show the code you're using to do this?\n. If you can clean this up; pull the latest; put just your changes into the branch; and don't build the branch, I'll be able to pull this into dev next.\n. The CI build failed; please retry this PR but grabbing the latest; and squashing into one unit of work commits; \n. Some of these checks failed in Travis CI. There are also a lot of merges here to keep up with; can you either separate discrete fixes into discrete PRs, or squash the ones that are related?\n. One of your commits failed the build; could you either branch this out into multiple PRs (one for each unit of work); or fix the commit that failed?\n. Also, this should be pointed at `dev-next`, not master.\n. This is great; but could you direct it at the dev-next branch, instead of master?\n. I believe this was resolved in our latest release.\n\nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/releases/tag/v0.1.24-alpha\n. This is good work; please re-issue the PR against our `dev-next` branch.\n. Thanks for this; I'll take a look at your changes. \n. Can you include an example application that demonstrates that and link to it? Either in a codepen or in a GH repo? Also, what are you referring to when you say \"First and Second Select\"?\n. The code wasn't in 1.21-alpha. That was a mistake on my part.\n. That may be a build error on my part.\n. If you had pulled down the bower package for v0.1.22-alpha, you wouldn't have this issue; but by installing against master, you do.  This is my fault; I somehow didn't add the actual build for master. It's in there now.  Whenever possible, you either want to use a tagged release, or if you want to live on the edge, go for `dev-next`.  \n. This is great, but could you target `dev-next` branch with your fix?\n. Could you squash these commits (using rebase -i) and re-issue this PR against Dev-next?\n. There are branch conflicts. Can you grab the latest and re-issue this PR against `dev-next`? \n. This isn't a bad idea; but we need better logic here; there should be conditional logic `if/else` around so you're not using the plugin if it's undefined.  A little more extensive work would need to be done against this PR to have to included.\n. Can you squash these down into one commit and re-issue PR? I like this; there are just a lot of commits here.\n. Can you link me to your sample project on Github that reproduces this issue that I can build and test against? If you're testing in the browser, it's not going to work.\n. Please issue this pr against `dev-next`\n. Is this on the device or on the web? Also, can you provide me a link to a repo I can pull down and put on my device to reproduce this?\n. That won't really help; if you can make a sample project that reproduces the issue; that will help.\n. Alright; let me know if anything turns up.\n. AFAIK, that's a GH Pages site; so there isn't much we can do on our end. @mhartington anything I'm missing?\n. I followed the directions in this Stack Overflow question; if that doesn't work I'll contact support: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11577147/how-to-fix-page-404-on-github-page\n. .... and we're back.\n. Please issue this PR against Dev-next.\n. CI build failed; please pull latest; check errors; and re issue against dev-next.\n. Why not make promises for openDB instead of using callbacks? That would match the rest of the plugin code.\n. If you can change your commit to use the code in your comment, it'd help this getting accepted.\n. This should be PR'd into dev-next; not master.\n. please issue this against the dev-next branch, per the contributing.md.\n. As per our Contributing.MD, could you redirect this to the dev-next branch so it can be included?\n. please put this into the dev-next branch.\n. I have no experience with Meteor, so it'll probably be far slower for me to do it than it would for you to do it and submit a PR since you have Meteor experience.\n. Can you point me to the github repo of the version you're referring to?\n. One issue with using that is that it's a Premium plugin; and that doesn't jive with people using it in an open-source project (or expecting to be able to use these plugins for free).  \n. @VicMota I thank you for your PR; but we'll have to put this into a premium branch to have it work; we can't break everyone else by pulling this in. An alternative would be you to fork the project and create a custom wrapper like I did for https://github.com/Jewelbots/ng-cordova-bluetoothle and just use that separately for your needs.  It's less than optimal, I know; but backwards capability is key.  \n. Can you post a reproducible example either in a repo or in a code pen so I can test? These plugins must be run on the device (or some can run in the emulator), so make sure you're doing it there and not just in the browser\n. I'll take a look at a code sample when it's provided so we can resolve this issue.\n. This is a good bug fix; but it needs to be pointed at dev-next, not master.\n. This is a good bug fi, but please issue it against `dev-next`.\n. Can you put this into the dev-next branch?\n. could you point this PR at the `dev-next` branch? That's where we put new features / bug fixes / PRs, etc.\n. Please fix the CI build issues and the branch conflicts and re-issue.\n. Seems like one more reason for us to mirror versions with compatible licenses and wrap installation of them on our own.  Other thoughts?\n. I knew I keep forgetting something.\n. This has been fixed; going forward we will include release notes.  Thanks for bringing this up.\n\nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/releases/tag/v0.1.24-alpha\n. This should be included in the next release.\n. @manduro this week\n. @Manduro This has been released under v0.1.24-alpha. \n. Please resolve the CI build issue, and re-issue this against the dev-next branch.\n. Please issue this PR against dev-next.\n. Please get the latest from dev-next and base the PR off of that. This currently has merge conflicts.\n. ```\ngit clone https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova.git\ncd ng-cordova\nnpm install\nbower install\ngulp karma\n```\n\nIf you get 'angular is not defined', it's because Angular is a bower dependency, so you have to run `bower install` before trying to run `gulp karma`.\n. Up for grabs. Feel free to create one and submit a PR against Dev-next to make it happen. \n. Please make this PR against dev-next, not master.\n. Build fails. Run Jscs and JSHint?\n. We had to upgrade our Jasmine instance. Thanks to #1174; it was fixed. Try again? And please target dev-next.\n. I'll take a look. Thanks.\n. I remember there being an Ionic issue with this recently; something about one of the tools they use dropping `S`; @mhartington do you remember which issue that was and the fix? I'll take a look into it, just super-paging you in case your google-fu is stronger.  That appears to be the issue here.\n. @ethanmay Also, the OAuth module that was in here was just removed; it was causing issues when trying to use it with the actual oauth submodule. @nraboy provides one you can install: https://github.com/nraboy/ng-cordova-oauth\n. We had to upgrade our Jasmine instance. Thanks to #1174; it was fixed. Try again? \n. We had to upgrade our Jasmine instance. Thanks to #1174; it was fixed.

We currently use this one: https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/cordova-plugin-googleplus and the wrapper is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/googlePlus.js How does your wrapper differ?\n. @sachinB94  The better way to handle this; since both of your wrappers rely on the same underlying plugin, would be for you to submit a PR that patches the existing wrapper with the different things you mention, instead of creating a whole new one.\n. @toddhalfpenny COuld you strip the dist/ files from your commit? Feel free to strip, rebase your branch; no need to close and re-open PR.\n. Yea; it's something I didn't learn until after allowing some PRs in that didn't do that and causing issues for myself.\n. Looks like there are merge conflicts; try again?\n. You're right. Go ahead and create the PR and target Dev-next\n. Thanks for catching that. I usually run gulp build so I didn't catch it.\n. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8569303/javascript-package-is-a-reserved-keyword\n\nGood find; could you submit a PR to resolve this issue? Please issue it to dev-next.\n. @AllenConquest This needs to be pointed at dev-next, per the contributing.md file.\n\n@ushu can you point this to dev-next instead of master?\n. @AllenConquest Awesome.  Next step is to go to that repo's page and click \"Issue Pull Request\"; and it'll walk you through what you need to do next .https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/\n. @pbernasconi This PR broke the build. https://travis-ci.org/driftyco/ng-cordova/builds \n.

If we include those changed files, it causes merge issues down the line.\n\nI'll also add something to the contributing.md so this is more apparent to others.\n. The plugins don't work in the browser. You have to run them on your phone or device. Some work in the simulator; others (like the bluetooth ones) do not.\n. Can you include some docs for this for the gh-pages branch?\n. @julio-coelho This should target `dev-next`, not master. we merge back into master after every release; but keep dev-next with new things so they can be tested before throwing them into master.\n. @julio-coelho  If you'd like to fork their branch and repoint it to dev-next and reference it in a PR; I can merge it for you.\n.

So this should resolve the broken build issue currently plaguing travis CI? \n. Looking at the source code for the plugin, it appears it's hitting this line: \n\nhttps://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-file/blob/76a27ce9ad543e15c002bc0b4467c448b3619999/src/ios/CDVLocalFilesystem.m#L237\n\nWhich means at some point along the way, you have an error that doesn't match any other error it can catch; and it looks like it uses \"Abort\" as a default error.  \n\nhttps://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-file/blob/76a27ce9ad543e15c002bc0b4467c448b3619999/src/ios/CDVLocalFilesystem.m#L229\n\nIt looks like that can happen if:\n- If it was a directory creation request and the directory could not be created\n- If the file could not be successfully created.\n. If you're not using the background geolocation provider?  I'd suspect (although I don't know, since I've never used it) that the app would have to be active.  You'd also need to check (if this is iOS) that you have the right entitlements checked; that you can allow the app to process stuff when it's in the background.\n. branch conflicts.

That makes me happy.\n. @samaxes Still would have to close this PR.  It needs to target dev-next, not Master.\n. If you want to take a stab at fixing them, it'd help. And it would put the open in open source. And the great in grateful.\n. @will-ockmore thsts definitely Helpful. \n. Could be an issue in the underlying plugin and not the wrapper. Which push plugin wrapper are you using? And are there any open issues on the Cordova plugin page about Marshmellow?\n. Not dead. Just putting time into it as my current time allows. If you'd like to help, someone broke the Dev-next build. Fix it and you'll be my hero.\n. For more information on the PR that broke the dev-next build, see #1145 \n. Can you link to a minimal example app that reproduces this issue?\n. Please strip out the /dist files from this commit; as it causes conflicts when we go to build or include other changes.\n. Per the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), This should be issued against `dev-next`; not master. \n. Please issue against `dev-next` instead of master.\n. This should be targeted to dev-next, not master (per the Contributing.md file).\n. The Other issue is the build failed; so you may want to check why and run gulp jshint and gulp karma and gulp jscs to make sure you're in compliance with the build.\n. I like the idea; I believe we do something similar in other plugins.  Another pattern that some plugin wrappers use is to effectively check if the plugin is active; and if so return a resolvable promise; and if not, reject the promise.\n. @AllenConquest Looks like there are merge conflicts; you can do what it says at the commend line, or the easier path would be to close the repo again, checkout dev-next, make your changes, and then issue another PR.\n. Thanks! I'll make a build today to get this out.\n. I don't know what ng-cordova 1.6.2 is. Our latest version is 0.1.26-alpha. are you sure you're using the right package?\n. Can you link to your GH project or provide a sample reproduction here? Also, some plugins can't run in a browser, so how are you running this? On the device itself through XCode?\n. There are some plugins that have to be used on the device; if they're not you'll get rejections.\n. @adanalig Not all plugins have written rejections for when it's undefined; in the case of the `bluetoothSerial`, it does not: https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/bluetoothSerial.js#L9\n\nIt probably needs a \n\n```\nif (!$window.bluetoothSerial) { \n  $q.reject();\n}\n```\n\nMost plugins would need something like this if you want to use them gracefully in the browser.\n. Your PR didn't pass the Travis CI checks; if you can run the karma tests locally before committing, that'll help make sure you're passing the tests before checking in your branch. `gulp karma` will do it. You'll also want to run `gulp jscs`.\n. Error from travis:\n\n> PhantomJS 2.1.1 (Linux 0.0.0) Service: $cordovaSpinnerDialog should call window.plugins's spinnerDialog.show FAILED\n>   Expected spy spinnerDialog.show to have been called with [ 'hi', 'nice hi message', true ] but actual calls were [ 'hi', 'nice hi message', true, undefined ].\n\nYes, update the tests and include it as a commit in this current branch.\n\nAlso make sure the tests 'do the right thing' (whatever that happens to mean) for this particular usecase.\n. Can you link to your GH project or provide a sample reproduction here?  Also, some plugins can't run in a browser, so how are you running this? On the device itself through XCode?\n. If you run it in browser; or on the device through XCode; what do you see in the console? There should be errors.\n. what do you see when you run it on the device in Xcode?\n. Don't know your specific issue; but here's an example app that works with ngCordova; it appears you're missing a few things?\n\nhttps://github.com/Jewelbots/ble-demo-app/blob/master/app/scripts/app.js#L8\n. PRs welcome. :-)\n. Two issues:\n1. This PR should be made against dev-next, not master (that information can be found in CONTRIBUTING.md).  \n2. You updated the `dist` folder, you should never need to do that; simply update the `src` folder and when we make a build it'll be included.\n. Two issues:\n1. You updated `master` as opposed to `dev-next`.  Your PR should target our dev-next branch.\n2. You made changes to the 'dist' folder.  That's a build artifact; and you don't need to touch that. Simply make the change in the appropriate file in the `src` folder and next time we build it'll be there.\n. Looks like the build failed.

So the cancel should reject the promise instead of fulfilling it.  That makes sense; it would also be a breaking change from how it works now.

Looks like the most recent version is premium. We're based off of this version:\n\nhttps://github.com/christocracy/cordova-plugin-background-geolocation/tree/0.3.7\n\nWhich is released under the apache license.\n\nWe will probably need to fork the code at that version; since anything later is under a custom license that may not be good for most companies.\n. That's a good idea.\n. You've got to tell me the error and preferably put it in a repo and show me a minimal example that reproduces the issue.\n. If you create a pull request into 'dev-next' I'd be happy to accept it.\n. Hi!  \n\nThanks for filling out an issue, but it's hard to tell what you need with one sentence and a link to somewhere else.  Take a little time and fill me in on what's going on.  What's grunt cdnify? Why should we support it? What are you using it for?  \n. @salangar I responded on the Stack Overflow question, but you're not even showing us how you're invoking ngCordova in your app.js; so it's impossible for us to tell if you've gotten the declaration working. For an example of an app that uses ngCordova, take a look at https://github.com/Jewelbots/ble-demo-app/blob/master/app/scripts/app.js#L8\n. @albertonaperijr I need you to provide a minimal, complete, verifiable example so I can help you. Include what models of phone you've tested this on as well. If you have a github repo that reproduces this issue that I can build and run, that will also work. http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\n. This is great; can you make this against `dev-next` instead of `master`, and don't include any of the build files in the commit?  Feel free to run `gulp jscs`. After you run `gulp build`, you can revert any changes to files in ./dist/*.\n. Still hoping you'll target this against `dev-next` instead of `master`.\n. Could you point this to `dev-next` instead of master, and make sure none of the files in ./dist/\\* are included in the commit?\n. In the \"Files changed\", it only shows the plugin file; it doesn't show that you added it to the list of plugins. did you forget to do that or revert that action in one of your commits?\n. yes\n. This looks great; I'd say the only change you need to make is to not include the files from ./dist/\\* when committing; those are build files and merge conflicts are hell when those are changed outside a release. We'll automatically update the files in ./dist/ when we deploy.\n. Yes\n. You are correct; it works for the first plugin, not the second. If you want to create a patch that lets it work for both, I'll gladly accept a PR.\n. ^^ What @ihadeed said.\n. This looks great; can you run this PR against dev-next instead of master?\n. It's still pointing to master.\n. Same issue as your other PR; I didn't realize you had just copied the script into the dist/ folder without the appropriate files being made in the src/plugins folder.\n. Looks like for `getPicture()` someone implemented the ability to resolve with a null promise. https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/camera.js#L12 Since it's just a wrapper, if the underlying plugin has been changed to work on a simulator, than this will too.\n\nLooks like the underlying plugin also supports the browser:\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-camera\n\nhuzah. If you'd like to submit a PR to fix; checkout our `gh-pages` branch, make the fix, and open a PR.\n. Huzzah was a misspelled statement of elation. If you'd like to submit a fix @itfschoen, I'd be happy to accept a PR\n. It's in `dev-next`, and will be in master during the next release, which will be next week.\nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/dev-next/src/plugins/toast.js#L69\n. This should be put in dev-next branch; which I believe already has this PR.\n. I love some of these changes; so if you target the dev-next branch and you pull the latest from it to do your additions off of, I'd be happy to add it. \n. The file should be added in the plugin folder; not just added to the 'dist' folder. The dist folder is a build artifact folder and is not actually a source file itself. You should add a file here: https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/tree/master/src/plugins and then reference that plugin in the list of plugins.  \n. Thanks for your work on this. One issue: \n\n```\nsrc/plugins/wikitudePlugin.js\n  line 18  col 77  'success' is defined but never used.\n```\n\nHere's the full output:\n\n```\n[00:34:56] Using gulpfile ~/build/driftyco/ng-cordova/gulpfile.js\n[00:34:56] Starting 'jshint'...\n[00:34:56] Starting 'jscs'...\n[00:34:56] Finished 'jscs' after 112 ms\nsrc/plugins/wikitudePlugin.js\n  line 18  col 77  'success' is defined but never used.\n\u2716 1 problem\n[00:34:59] 'jshint' errored after 2.63 s\n[00:34:59] Error in plugin 'gulp-jshint'\nMessage:\n    JSHint failed for: src/plugins/wikitudePlugin.js\nnpm ERR!

Just remember when you build to have the commit ignore changes in the `dist/*` folders\n. The only remaining issue is that you shouldn't have any changes in the dist/\\* folders (reason being, that's an artifact folder and changes there are really hard to merge in; so we make changes there when we release).\n. Unfortunately you can't just add the `.gitignore` to the `dist/` folder, since we do rely on that folder; it's a build artifact that is used in master to allow for bower installs.\n. revert the files you changed in dist/ to their previous state (before you messed with them) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/215718/reset-or-revert-a-specific-file-to-a-specific-revision-using-git\n. @yailPeralta Your commit still shows the dist change: https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/1278/files\n\nIsn't Git fun?\n. awesome, thanks!\n. You're right; that's not trivial. \n\nThere are a few possible solutions:\n- \"Build\" dev-next in a nightly fashion (on our end);\n- more frequent releases (I tend not to do that because I want to give time for people to test out differences\n  - going back to asking PRs to build and merge in ./dist (a nightmare for contributors, and a nightmare to merge back into master).\n. do you see any other ways of handling it?\n. I just released v0.1.27-alpha; so that should solve your immediate issue; and we'll work on doing both.\n\nThanks for bringing this up, @MatthieuMB \n. Thanks; but please drop any files you changed in dist/*; those are build artifacts and shouldn't be included in a PR.\n. @osirisr @luisUrrutia Still waiting for the  OP (or anyone else that wants to) to actually base it off of dev-next and issue a PR against dev-next. https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/993\n. @datnordstrom You can always take the time to make the changes in an up-to-date fork of dev-next and submit a PR. That'll help it get accepted faster.\n. Feel free to add a PR to the docs to correct them. This is good work, thank you!\n. What's going wrong that you don't want to use `$cordovaContacts`? Also; you can use any cordova plugin without the ngCordova wrapper; just install the plugin via the command line, include the script in your `index.html`, and for `jshint` set a global where you use it.\n. Ionic is not compatible with iOS3; therefore ngCordova is not compatible with iOS3.\n. Can you link me to a reproducible example, either a codepen or a github repo?\n. Need code that reproduces the issue with the wrapper (and without it is helpful), also need the version of the plugin and the wrapper you're using, and whatever errors you see in XCode logs.\n. REally good to know. Thanks!\n. If the wrapper doesn't support it, I'll happily accept a PR to support it.\n. I wouldn't be surprised if the contacts wrapper was based on an older version of the plugin. \n. Feel free to upgrade the wrapper to match the current implementation. I'll be happy to include the change in the release notes.\n. Can you provide an example that reproduces the issue?\n. Please do not include any files from the dist/\\* folders in your changes. Those are automatically generated when we build for release.\n. Please target this against dev-next, not master. https://github.com/blog/2224-change-the-base-branch-of-a-pull-request\n. Also, this PR needs to include the source file changed. There should be no dist/\\* files in the PR, as those are build artifacts.  You should add the plugin to the folder here: https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/tree/dev-next/src/plugins, and add it to the list of plugins here: https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/6914f8e2eeab89a6ef6c145a7a1cdaac3ad7e809/src/plugins/module.js\n. This PR: https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/1306/files is a great example of how to add a plugin.\n. Could you repoint this to dev-next instead of master? https://github.com/blog/2224-change-the-base-branch-of-a-pull-request\n. I don't see the jscs hint fix in your commits. IS it in this PR?\n. the base branch needs to be changed to `dev-next`.\n. three issues:\n1. You made the change to the dist/\\* folder insetad of the src/plugins/<plugin-name>.js.  That means that change won't be there next build.  The dist folder is just a build artifact. If you want the change to stick around it has to go in the actual src/plugins/<plugin-name>.js file.\n2. Please target the `dev-next` instead of master with your PR.\n3. Please omit any dist/\\* files from your commit; it gives future merging a headache.\n. Please put this against `dev-next`, not master.\n. Also, please don't include any files from dist/*; as those are build artifacts.\n. Still have the issue with all the changes in dist/_. The changes just need to be done in the plugins/folder; not in the dist/_ folder.\n. Correct. Aiming for a release this week.\n. This should target Dev-next, and you only made the change to the mocks file. Did you mean to make it to the plugin file as well?\n. No time to learn like the present: In your PR, you can change the branch using this: \n\nhttps://github.com/blog/2224-change-the-base-branch-of-a-pull-request\n\nAs far as the mock being the only thing being wrong; that makes sense.\n. the build failed + this should target `dev-next`, not master.\n. @MarcusXie You have to provide a working reproduction for me to see the issue.  I can't really guess. :-/\n. You don't have the underlying push notification plugin installed.\n. Have you tried the plugin from: https://github.com/Jewelbots/parse-phonegap-plugin-push ? Also the parse-phonegap-plugin-push on that repo\n. Also keep in mind this doesn't work when you are running it in the web browser or emulating a device. It has to be on the physical device to work.\n. This is a underlying plugin issue, not a wrapper issue. Try here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-12085?jql=project%20%3D%20CB%20AND%20status%20in%20(Open%2C%20%22In%20Progress%22%2C%20Reopened)%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20AND%20component%20%3D%20%22Plugin%20File%22%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC%2C%20summary%20ASC%2C%20updatedDate%20DESC\n. Please target this against `dev-next`\n. This sounds like a great idea! Feel free to take a stab at it. If you get going and run into issues that you need help with, feel free to open an issue. http://definitelytyped.org/guides/contributing.html\n. Sorry to do this to you again, can you rebase? It's not mergable at this time. I promise we'll accept the PR more quickly this time. :-)\n. closing; will re-open if this is reproduced.\n. Could you include a minimal reproduction of the issue you're having? I'll be happy to re-open this once you do that.\n. @sryze what version of ng-cordova are you using?\n. Could you include a link to a minimal reproduction of this issue in a new repo?  I'll be happy to take a look at this issue then (without code, it's hard to see where the problem is).\n. @apla I like this idea.  I want to look further at your plugin and possibly include it in the next minor version of ngCordova.  \n. Please fork the gh-pages branch of this repo and include your proposed changes in the documentation and create a pull request. I'll be happy to look/merge this in at that time.\n. @cfjedimaster Do you have any suggestions for naming?\n. This changes the style too much from the other plugin wrappers. If you change all of them to use the same standard style; I'll take a look.\n. Can you pull the most recent version of this repo; and if it doesn't work include a minimal reproduction that we can use to reproduce and fix this issue? Thanks!\n. If you need to create a wrapper; the best thing I can suggest is for you to look at any of the existing wrappers and then look at the code they wrap.  \n\nIn my case; I wrote a wrapper recently for a plugin that's not yet in the core of this project:\n\nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/commit/f07176e606d32cf6ff3220e8fcc498c0181c2ef4\n\nThe biggest gotchas I've encountered is that sometimes the cordova plugins are continuous (they may trigger the success callback multiple times); but angularJS promises only resolve once; which means you may need to rely on the 'notify' condition and write custom code to determine when a promise should actually resolve.  This should follow the spirit of the plugin you're wrapping. An example of where I had to do that is referenced in issue #885.  \n\nLet me know if you have any more questions about this.\n\nAlso, we have a file plugin; let me know if that's not what you need: https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/file.js\n. Please fix the errors; rebase and submit a new PR from the current version.\n. Interesting. Sounds like an issue with the underlying plugin and not ngCordova?\n. Not quite sure what you need to be added as a new feature. Can you go into more detail about the use case?\n. the plugin does need to be included through normal cordova means.\n. Could you include a project that reproduces this issue with the latest versions?\n. You're using the deprecated plugin; try it with $cordovaPushV5 and let me know how it goes?\n. Please update and reissue this PR.\n. Good to know, will add updating this for the next version.\n. That's great! Thanks.  We'll have to continue to use the free version for obvious reasons; thanks for your effort. I'm disappointed your work isn't licensed in a fashion where we can include it in an open source project; but I understand your position.\n. Thanks for letting us know. If you can put together a pull request, I'd be happy to include it in a future version.\n. Please update; rebase and re-issue your pull request.\n. Can you include a reproduction of this issue that we can use to test?  I'll be happy to re-open this then.\n. Please update; rebase and re add this PR.\n. Is this still happening?\n. Since there have been docs changes, please rebase and re-issue this PR.\n. @bruno-serfe I added support for the new plugin in #984, also covered in issue #963.\n. Closed with the resolution of #963.\n. 0.1.17-alpha is on npm.  Do you still need 0.1.14-alpha on npm for a specific reason?\n\n`npm view ng-cordova`\n. merged.\n. At the moment, there are conflicts. not your fault; but please rebase and re-issue this PR.\n. Is this still an issue with the latest version?\n. Since this is a dupe of #506, closing.\n. It'd help if you could write the wrapper for this and include a pull request for it. It'd definitely get added sooner.  Otherwise I'll add it to the 'new plugin' label and will get to it when possible. \n. Not sure of the actual question being posed here. Can you help me out by explaining the issue?   Not all plugins support all platforms; we're just the wrappers for the plugins themselves; so if you would like to write a cordova plugin that works the same across platforms, that'd be an awesome cordova plugin to have, and we'd love to have a wrapper made for it once that happens.\n. Could you include a Minimal Complete, verifiable example in code?  I'd love to fix this if you can reproduce it and share the code that reproduces this issue with us.\n. Why the WIP and not pulling the latest version? The WIP Branch is pretty old.\n. I would love to add this plugin, but there's been updates so I need you to rebase and re-issue this PR.  Also, if you could include a gh-pages documentation PR that includes some docs on this plugin, that'd be really helpful and ensure it gets better adoption.\n. Thanks!\n. If you could create a pull request with the mocks for this; that'd be helpful.  Since there are a number of plugins we support, we rely on individual contributions to keep the project going.   Otherwise it'd be one of those \"When we're able to get to it\" sort of things, which may be different than your time table.\n. Most of these issues have been resolved with newer PRs; please rebase and check out the additions from master. The only outstanding issue might be the variable naming. Check it out.\n. If you could include a sample project that reproduces this issue with the latest version, I'd be happy to re-open this issue.\n. Could you include a pull request fixing the docs on this?\n. That's awesome!  Since it looks like you're the plugin author, you'd be the best person to write the wrapper for that plugin. if you can write the wrapper and include it as a pull request, we'd be happy to have it.\n. If you update to the latest version, does this still happen? If so, please include a link to a repro of this problem in a sample project.\n. Can you include a project that reproduces this issue that I can pull from and use to test?\n. Looks like the tests failed; please rebase and re-issue this PR.\n. @kylelib  If you're using Angular (which ngCordova depends on), then you simply use the DI syntax to have $window be injected:\n\n```\nangular.module('ngCordova.plugins.myPlugin', [])\n        .factory('$cordovaMyPlugin', ['$q', '$window', function ($q, $window) {\n            return {\n                get: function() {\n                    var q = $q.defer();\n                    $window.plugins.myPlugin.get(function (result) {\n                        q.resolve(result);\n                    }, function(error) {\n                        q.reject(error);\n                    });\n                    return q.promise;\n                }\n            };\n        }]);\n```\n. Seems like we'd need a better API for this than just 'connect'. other plugins have separate API calls for the act of connecting, the act of reconnecting, disconnecting, and reporting whether or not we're still connected.    I'm not sure how to fix it either; but I'll chew on it.\n. Thanks for doing this. This change makes sense.\n. Written at different times, probably by different people; I'm sure there's a reason; but I'm not seeing an actual problem to solve here.  Consistency would be nice; but lower on our list than other issues currently.\n. If you look at issue #885 ; I show a few commits where I had to create a wrapper for a cordova plugin. It was the first time I created a wrapper.  That's going to be the fastest way to get this integrated.  Create the wrapper and submit a pull request for it.  \n. If you use the push plugin without the wrapper, does it work? If so, please provide a sample project that uses both ways (with our $cordovaPush and without), so that we can fix the issue in the wrapper if it turns out the wrapper code is the problem. If you use this code on an iOS or Android device, does it work?\n. Thanks for letting us know. Please include a pull request with these fixes and I'll be happy to merge them in!\n. @zmijevik Can you include a codepen that reproduces the issue? Or link to a minimal github repo that reproduces the issue?\n. That's annoying. I'll add a note to normalize and make all of this consistent for a future release.  (if you'd like to speed that process along, feel free to pull and create a pull request that does this!).\n. You're right, I read this issue differently.  I don't know where the code for the custom builder is, but I'll find it and let you know. I ways assumed it was part of the build tasks for this repo.\n. Rejected in favor of #836; I like this approach, but $q.notify is real-time; even if it doesn't resolve the promise until the $timeout occurs. a possible way around that would be another function that immediately if a specific device is found, like `find`.\n. Thank you!\n. Since we're on 0.1.17; this seems like not something to worry about any more.  I'm sorry if that caused any issues.\n. Thanks for sharing this. It could be  a bug in the underlying plugin; if you can provide code using the wrapper and just using the plugin without the wrapper and it turns out the bug is in the ngCordova code; we'll be happy to fix it. We don't really have the bandwidth to fork and fix the underlying plugins themselves.\n. Sometimes the API for the plugins is not fully fleshed out; you can definitely submit a pull request that fleshes it out more.\n. I've not used the OAuth plugin myself, but my guess is that you'd set up a proxy for your device through something you have fiddler attached to and watch the traffic and make sure the headers are correct.  I'll be happy to accept a pull request when you're ready for us to take a look at it.\n. Can you include a Minimal Complete Verifiable eXample (A sample project that reproduces this issue)? If you create it as a git repo, I'd be happy to pull, run, and see the issue so we can fix it.\n. If you can include a sample project that reproduces this issue and uses both the wrapper and the underlying plugin without the wrapper (and shows which works and which doesn't), we'll be happy to take a look at this.\n. Please include a sample project that reproduces this issue.  I don't see this issue in 0.1.17.\n. Please update, rebase, and re-issue this PR.\n. It'd be awesome if all mocks worked in the browser;  sadly we haven't yet written code for all of them to work in the browser. If you'd like to help us by adding one for toast, I'd be happy to accept a PR.\n. This would seem to be 'working as designed' since the plugins are namespaced to the `ngCordova.plugins.` namespace.  I could also be looking at this wrong.\n. @mlynch Are there any JSHint or JSlint specific settings this project uses to ensure code style remains the same?\n. Thank you!\n. This would be great. If you have a plugin you can suggest; please include a link to it.  Also, if you could help us out by writing a wrapper, I list out how to do that in #885; otherwise I'll put it on the backlog once you've provided a link to a plugin that does this that we should write a wrapper for.\n. Have you used ngCordovaMocks for browser work?  \n. Can you reproduce this issue and include a new issue with the reproduction vs. what should happen? This feels very 'hardcode'-y to me, and I want to make sure we're not introducing regressions with adding this PR.\n. Are you having an issue with ngCordova?  If so, please provide a sample project that reproduces the issue you're seeing and I'll be happy to re-open this issue.\n. What do you mean by alarms?\n. If you write a PR that has this fix in it, I'd be happy to take a look and merge it in!\n. Yea; it seems like there would need to be a Cordova plugin written for this; then we could add a wrapper on top of that. are there any cordova plugins you know of that do this that we should include support for?\n. This was already resolved in #750. Thanks for helping; theirs just got merged first.  Not your fault; we're just catching up with all the PRs and chose that one because it's a little more extensive.\n. Yes; filter is currently busted. I've added a fix for this in PR #891. Thanks for catching this!\n. If you could include a sample project that reproduces this issue, I'll be happy to take a closer look. Also specify which platform this is failing for (iOS, android).\n. Thanks for this reproduction. I'll take a look and let you know.\n. It's supposed to fail in the browser; better would be to add a $q.reject if we're in a browser; or add  a mock that can be called in the browser.\n. Please include a sample project that reproduces this issue and we'll be able to take a look more quickly.\n. Could you include the file you're referring to as well as the commit you're referring to?\n. It's entirely possible that there's a bug in the wrapper code; could you put together a minimal reproduction of this issue along with what you expect to happen so that I can look into it further for you?  If you can include that code here, I'll re-open the issue and look into what fix is necessary.\n\nThank you!\n. I'm really sorry that happened. We love PRs that help fix the docs; could you include a PR with the documentation fix? You're probably the best person to do it since you were just working on this issue.  I'll be happy to look over and merge the PR when it's ready.\n. We'll keep it for now, but thanks for letting us know.\n. Thank you for doing this work; because there's a newer version of the build, please update, rebase, and re-issue this PR.\n. This is a great suggestion. Could you make a pull request for this feature request? We'd be happy to look at this issue further then.\n. If you include a PR that includes that enhancement, I'll be happy to include it.\n. looks like i twas added here: https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/1170\n\njust waiting for the OP to strip the dist/ from their PR.\n. Could you provide a minimal reproduction of this issue in a sample project? I'll be happy to take a look at the underlying code.\n. This doesn't use the $q promise chain; it just seems to call straight to the native plugin.  Would prefer it used promises.\n. Please include a sample project that reproduces this issue. once you do that, I'll be happy to re-open.\n. If you can include a sample project that reproduces this issue; I'll be happy to take a look.  I do know that generally cordova isn't loaded in the browser, so it won't be defined.  \n. Since ngcordova v2 is now Ionic native that this isn't a thing anymore?\n. Please update, rebase, and re-issue this PR. There are conflicts currently.\n. Closing as the initial issue brought up is not an ngCordova issue (turns out the $ionicPlatform.ready call was required).  @dangnelson If you can open a separate issue with a reproducible snippet for the $cordovaKeyboard.disableScroll() issue, we'll be happy to take a look.\n. I don't know why this was removed either. Will include it.\n. If you write a PR that includes a wrapper for this; that'd ensure it'd get included much more quickly. Thanks!\n. If you can update the documentation with a PR and submit that PR, we'd be happy to accept it.\n. It's located on the gh-pages branch of this Repo. see the 'contributing.md' doc in the root of this Repo for more directions.\n. Thanks for doing this.\n. So what you're saying is, we need a plugin we can trust?  That sounds like a good place to start. :-)\n. Thanks for catching this. Please submit a PR for this with the fixed documentation.\n. Could you put together a minimal reproduction of this issue here or in a github repo that I can pull to investigate this issue for you?  I'll re-open this when you do that. (something that I can pull; build, and put on my phone to check this issue out).\n. This would probably cause confusion with the advent of multiple BLE plugins; but we need a better way to handle abandoned plugins vs. active plugins. Perhaps including this in a new major version of NgCordova? as Cordova 5 compatible? Anyone else have any thoughts on this?\n. https://github.com/randdusing/BluetoothLE is the plugin; the wrapper is available through the first comment link; I'd clean it up before adding it.   \n\nI'd like for there to be an easier way for users to be able to see what plugins are supported at their Cordova level; it'd save a lot of heartache; but it does add some complexity on our part.\n. It wasn't until two days ago that an outstanding PR #751 was merge; so I was thinking the evothings was the actual under the hood plugin, and it didn't support Cordova 4.0+; and that led me to creating the wrapper for this plugin.  Since then, i've added a few features to this plugin; notably how to search for specific devices; but that's nothing that couldn't be replicated. \n. The BluetoothSerial is for serial communication over bluetooth; and the ble.js wrapper is the standard BLE wrapper; we don't need multiples of them, you're right. \n\nI'll continue using the bluetoothle plugin (the custom one in my repo), and will put docs around it.\n. Cordova Plugins don't work in the browser.\n. Yea; the submodule can be confusing, and due to the flurry of recent PRs; you'll need to update, rebase, and re-issue this PR; but thank you for making this work.\n. Thanks for this.  Could you help us out by forking the gh-pages branch of this repo, adding the fix to the documentation there, and submitting a pull request? \n\nThanks again!\n. Please include a minimal example that reproduces the issue you're seeing so that we can help you resolve this issue.  If you do that, I'll be happy to re-open.\n. If you submit a pull request for this, we'd be happy to accept.\n. Using notify for this makes sense; if you'd like to put together a pull request, we'd be happy to accept.  \n\nI also had to do this for the custom plugin wrapper I wrote for the bluetoothle.js (not the ble.js that you know and love); that commit is here: https://github.com/Jewelbots/ng-cordova/commit/88463cb6b2adf09b052c362c5928b4d9223c2f1f\n\nI also wrote a more complex version of that so for another function here: \nhttps://github.com/Jewelbots/ng-cordova/commit/8fe7866eea4234d8e3d0442469ceac2ff95a46a0\n\nI'll close this; and submit a pull request for this issue and we'll handle it there.\n. Please update, rebase and reissue this PR; as there are conflicts.\n. One of the reasons I bring this up is that I'm always getting merge conflicts in the dist/ related items due to builds.\n. Can you share a minimal reproduction of this issue ? The code necessary for me to reproduce it?\n. If you include a sample project that reproduces this issue, we'll be happy to take a look.\n. I'll take a look, thanks for reporting this.\n. Hm.  I'll dig into this deeper; I'm able to reproduce this issue.\n. PRs welcome; please submit one for this fix.\n. Thank you!\n. This seems like there are two PRs here, one for docs, and one for updating all cordova plugin namings; since I'd like to test those independently, please split the fix out; one that renames the cordova installation plugins, and one that fixes the media docs.\n\nThank you for doing this work!\n. I like the idea, one issue is stability. \n. I think we're going to collect more data on this; think of the oAuth module as the test subject.  We need to hold off on making this a wider thing until we've got a rock solid deployment and regression check process around submodules. \n. @matheusrocha89 http://38.media.tumblr.com/8eb1eb849b8b5fb2452bb74a697900a0/tumblr_mzvc3qNsII1t7xe6go1_400.gif\n. @nraboy  I see 3.9 on npm; I don't see a 4.0 yet.https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp\n. > Unless Ionic gets a fleet of internal developers working on this project, ngCordova will only be as good as the contributions it receives. \n\nThat's true; and that's why I want people to give us PRs instead of just raising issues.  It's easy to say, \"you need to do this\", it's harder to say, \"This is an issue; and I don't know how to help, but I want to.\"\n\nngCordova only succeeds if we do the latter.  If this were a project with one or two plugins, that'd be one thing -- but ngCordova supports lots of plugin wrappers for 64+ plugins; not all of which have community support behind them.\n\nSubmodules mean not knowing when there's an unstable build; and with the free time we have, it can't be spent tracking down unstable builds because a submodule was updated and we have no Issue tracking/commit tracking in this repository to see what changed upstream.  It'd be great if the tooling were there, but it's not.\n\n> The last few months have proven not so good. For example, isn't SQLite still majorly broken in ngCordova?\n\nThe last few months haven't been so awesome; you're right. That's partly why I stepped up.  I rely on ngCordova, and I'm not the only one.  I bet there are dozens of companies building Apps that need what ngCordova provides.  We've got to ensure ngCordova is stable. If you rely on ngCordova, then your help is desired.  Submit PRs, even if it's just a PR to make documentation better.\n\nAs far as last night's submodule fun, I won't just be merging PRs to mainline; and there will be development branches; more on that to come.   I'm still on week one here; so expect a little shakiness.\n\nAs far as SQLite goes; I'm using that plugin next, so unless someone else gets to it first, I'll be able to see pretty quickly what's broken with it.  \n\nPart of this being an open source project means that anyone who can read these pages can help make it better.   Be the change you wish to see in the world.\n. You'll need to rebase and cherrypick commit 4b33a4f; the other commit is still in this PR.\n. Looks like the oAuth submodule is in a broken state. @nraboy?\n. At this time, install0.1.17, I'm not near a PC; but if you remove the oAuth module, you'll also be Ok.\n. v0.1.19-alpha has been pushed that has this PR in it.\n. I think this is great; but it's a bit daunting because there aren't any docs around it. We do have the gh-pages branch; it'd be really, really, really useful if you could put together some examples and docs around how to use this for inclusion in our docs.\n. @DanailMinchev @beauby 's comments are spot on.\n. @beauby is correct; we haven't always adhered to it.   We are now because someone brought it up now;  it's an organic thing.  We're really appreciative of your work @DanailMinchev; thank you.\n. Thanks for doing this; can you update and re-issue this PR against the `dev-next` branch? I'm happy to include it, but going forward want to put in all features to a dev branch first.\n. fixed with tag v0.1.19-alpha.\n. @barryvdh I like this idea because it would also show the relative popularity of each plugin. As it stands right now all plugins are equally included, meaning that we don't really know if there's one user of a plugin or a thousand.  By putting these wrappers in different Repos; we'd have a better sense of which are used and which are just (and should be) abandoned.  The downside (of course) is from a maintenance standpoint; because I'd be subscribed to 60+ repos to make changes. That could get ugly fast. \n\nThat said, If it makes it easier to de-lineate which plugins are supported by which version of Cordova /  ngCordova, then I'm all about it.  \n\nI'd rather a one-repo different branches for versions; but even that has its own issues; as does keeping it all in one repo yet having version files as metadata and having the build system create all plugins which are compatible with each version.\n. @barryvdh  I don't quite understand your last comment; can you expand on it? \n\n>  and set an example so that other people can just make their own plugins on their own repo if they want.\n. @barryvdh  That makes sense. One reason we don't do that currently are when things like the oAuth module are changed and regression, people could blame us even though we have no control over that.  If there were separate repos, I'd probably insist on keeping a small group of maintainers around them with either DriftyCo or Jewelbots organizational control (or a separate organization created for this).\n\n@mlynch has stated publicly that the next version of ngCordova won't rely on Angular Promises and won't be tied to angular 1.x; and that's awesome -- except that there will be businesses (I'm thinking of Jewelbots, but there are probably others) that won't upgrade right away, so we may have months or a year of people still relying on ngCordova, and I don't want to leave them out in the cold.\n\nWhen you have an App that you're using to push business revenue; it becomes very costly to rewrite that app because a new version came out; and the more I look at talks of Angular2, Ionic2, and ngCordova2, the more I see no easy upgrade path; which is problematic for businesses.\n\nI say all that to say that no matter what, I'm going to be around ngCordova 1.0 for a while yet (at least until the middle of next year); so any plans we have have to take into account that other businesses will be too.\n. Awesome.  This will be pulled in for the next release.\n. Sorry about this; I had to fix a GHPages issue; and so your PR was closed automatically because of that; resubmit? \n. correct; my fault.\n. Thanks for doing this; please update and re-issue this PR against the `dev-next` branch; as that will contain the new plugins.\n. We've talked about this elsewhere, specifically in #873.  What to do about hosting different versions of Cordova compatible plugins?  This requires a little design work and some thought, but I have some ideas around this. In the meantime; the best way to get a plugin included (no matter if it exists or not), is to create a PR that has an implementation + docs for that implementation.  \n. Yea; lets stay away from that as much as possible (same with 'newMedia' [just learned my lesson there]). As a working title, $cordovaPushv5 would work; we'll rebase if the better solution comes along before you're done with your PR.\n. Yea; it appears this change was made in PR #871;  Errgh.\n. For whatever reason this still has conflicts with the build; try again? You probably need to fetch; rebase interactively, and squash your commits to one; also it appears you may have pulled in between so that's why we're seeing so many changes over and above what you've actually done.\n. Thanks for doing this; my only question is around the extensive use of attaching to `$rootScope`; I haven't used this plugin wrapper in particular, but it doesn't seem like it _has_ to be that way; nor would that be the preferred method.\n\nDoes this plugin require that? Or was it done for expediency?  \n. The reason why I bring up rootScope is that anything that relies on Angular 1.x will potentially have to change for ngCordova2 (which won't be dependent on Angular).\n. Since .DS_Store was removed, what to do about when that gets included again? Where should that be handled?\n. I like this, but I'm a little worried about it, so I'll hang on to this for the next release.\n. Also, please issue this PR against `dev-next`.\n. Most of these look great; my question is on this diff:\n\n```\n-  cordova plugin add de.appplant.cordova.plugin.local-notification\n+ cordova plugin add https://github.com/katzer/cordova-plugin-local-notifications.git\n```\n\nIs there a specific reason to target the github repo master repo instead of a published release?\n. I've been added to the npm deploy; I'll push one out today.\n. I'll issue a release to npm once the PR #932 is done on Travis-CI.  It'll be a new release.\n. Done. v0.1.20-alpha is on npm and bower.\n. I'm not a fan of output files being checked in, but this project is set up such that they are accessible to the end user (reason is so people don't have to build project from master to get current version). \nIt's a headache, so when I merge this PR, I'll generate a build so that master is up to date.\n. OAuth will be removed from version 0.2.0. (next release); I'll include notes on how to install it if you want it.\n. Can you make this pr to the dev-next branch?\n. This was done in #957; so closing this one.\n. This is great; can you make this PR against dev-next branch?\n. I'll be in the next version of ngCordova; which will also be the same version that removes the OAuth submodule. \n. @newelement OAuth submodule? Only if you want to.\n. Can you provide a sample repo that reproduces this issue? \n. It's hard to help you without you providing me with a sample repo I can use to look through this problem with you. Without that it's just me guessing at possibilities.\n. You should put the code used to do this on github in a minimal example so I can build and run it on my own device; and then I can see what you're seeing and see if it's a problem in Code.  You can also try running the Cordova plugin directly without the ngCordova extensions to see if it's an ngCordova bug or a cordova plugin bug.\n. I'm glad this was solved.  I know it seems painful; but there are so many  moving parts that a problem can be caused by half a dozen things;  asking for a clean repo helps ensure that we're not chasing ghosts.\n. What device are you testing against in Android and what is the Android version on that device?  Can you provide a link to a clean repo that reproduces this issue?\n\nDo you still see this issue if you use the cordova-progressIndicator directly without the ngCordova wrapper?\n. Can you make this PR off the current dev branch? Dev-next?\n. @mhartington I'll investigate and do another release.\n. Likes like Bower's [PR #1852](https://github.com/bower/bower/pull/1852) broke this because we do a lot of prereleases;  I'll issue a non-prerelease version of the mainline, that _should_ resolve this issue.\n. I updated to 1.5.2 and was able to install ngCordova without any issues; I'll still issue a general release for everyone on 1.5.1; but I'm surprised I didn't get this error in 1.5.2.\n. Ah, they reverted the behavior in 1.5.2 to be the 'old' behavior, so pre-release branches work again: https://github.com/bower/bower/issues/1896\n\nThat's why 1.5.2 works and 1.5.1 doesn't.  \n. Thanks; this is really helpful. would you consider putting this into docs form and adding it to the plugin wrapper docs for the Facebook plugin?\n. Can you provide a link to a github repo that reproduces this issue minimally?  ionic start myApp blank and provide the code that you see caues this? It'll help us investigate and fix this issue if it's in ngCordova faster.\n\nAnother question to ask; do you see this when you use the cordova plugin directly, instead of the wrapper?\n. Can you base this PR off of dev-next?  That's the branch we're using to merge PRs into.\n. Thanks!\n. I'm looking into it today. I'll let you know.\n. I'm writing the wrapper for this plugin today; shouldln't take too long.  It'll go into the next version.\n. Debugging it now. Will push when it's ready.\n. I had some trouble getting my Push Notifications working through Parse's service; hence the trouble.  That'll be a separate plugin; but for now here's the plugin I'm using. There's some cleanup I need to do before adding it in, but it's available here: https://github.com/Jewelbots/ng-cordova/\n. When the docs are cleaned up and everything's added in, I'll submit a PR.\n. @fazermokeur It'll be going into dev-next shortly, and will be part of the 0.1.21-alpha release.\n. @razmik it's available now if you use bower's branch resolution against 'Dev-next', I'm currently running against Dev-next for our production work. I'll likely push out a release Tuesday or Wednesday of this week, depending on feedback.\n. @paulogr I'm not qualified to answer that. We have parse for our backend push (ionic push wasn't out yet) and I modified the push plugin to work with parse; I don't know if something similar works with the ionic push plugin or if you can use it out of the box. @mhartington? \n. the wrapper here works with the push plugin. i didn't have to change this wrapper on my own repo that allows for it to integrate with parse because parse requires changes to the underlying plugin to work, not the wrapper. I don't know what other BaaS's do, so I can't speak to their needs for the underlying plugin.\n. @philmerrell Was hoping for more feedback than just my usage of it.\n. @seenimurugan It's in v0.1.22-alpha, I'm not sure what you're referring to, can you link me to the file where it should be (but isn't)?\n. @seenimurugan That's why I wanted you to link to the file; I couldn't find it to see where it should have been added. You're right, it' an oversight it wasn't added. I'll add it and increment the release so bower and NPM pick it up.\n. This will be resolved when #1064 is merged, and I'll push out a new tag.   v0.1.23-alpha it will be. Some day I'll be able to make a build without having to make 3 builds to fix that build. Someday.\n. pushed and merged. Let me know if you still run into an issue.\n. This is great; can you base this PR off of dev-next?  That's the dev branch we use to ensure everything is good before going into master.\n. Yea, I also had an issue with the sql-lite plugin. If you can, rebase your changes off the current state of the `dev-next` branch; and reissue the PR.\n. Nice catch. I hadn't checked there. ::sheepish grin::.\n. @ptarjan That's the right place; I hadn't been using the release function; I should have been.  For 0.1.21-alpha I'll make sure to use that functionality. Sorry about that.\n. Please PR this into dev-next; that's where all PRs should go.\n. Please PR  this into dev-next; that's where all PRs should go.\n. Thanks!\n. Please fix the failing test and re-issue the PR? You'll probably wnat to rebase off of the current state of the branch.\n\nPhantomJS 1.9.8 (Linux 0.0.0) Service: $cordovaToast should call window's plugins.toast.showWithOptions method FAILED\n    showWithOptions() method does not exist\nPhantomJS 1.9.8 (Linux 0.0.0): Executed 144 of 271 (1 FAILED) (0 secs / 0.28 secs)\n. Make the fix, rebase your branch on dev-next latest and fixup the commits, and then issue the new PR from that.  Thanks again.\n. This is also covered in issue #750; and it's an issue we also experience in the (different) BluetoothLE plugin wrapper we use at @Jewelbots: https://github.com/Jewelbots/ng-cordova-bluetoothle.\n\nSome plugins handle this through an eventing system, using `$rootScope.emit` instead of returning a value from a promise resolution: \n\nhttps://github.com/gortok/ng-cordova/blob/phonegap-push-plugin-addition/src/plugins/push_v5.js#L21\n\nBut we also seemingly fixed this issue in [https://github.com/tubaman/ng-cordova/commit/e28650183a5e1b206c9cefee75c2454644636f6a](this commit) for scan; it appears this should also be used for the `startNotification` function?\n. @mhartington #750 and #836 targeted the same bit of code; the code in question here is a different bit (startNotification vs. scan); so the code in #750 would need to be added for the `startNotification` function for this to be resolved.\n. @mhartington No. I'm currently integrating the wrapper for the push plugin; Expected that to be finished soon, and if no one jumps on it before then I can take a look at this.\n. @don That's a great point.  It's also something I've struggled with, promises are the new hotness but they don't catch these sorts of situations.  Observerables are obviously preferred; and are generally done using $rootScope.emit() / $rootScope.on() in AngularJS 1.x. This is probably the route we should go for the BLE wrapper; much like this: https://github.com/gortok/ng-cordova/blob/phonegap-push-plugin-addition/src/plugins/push_v5.js#L21\n. @don That's a really good point. Perhaps we could dynamically register events to listen for, instead of the hardcoding that's done in the push plugin? \n. Could you put this in dev-next? That's the branch we use for future releases.\n. Can you rebase this off of the current state of dev-next? and resubmit this PR?\n. There are branch conflicts; so you'll have to rebase and try again.  If I did it I wouldn't be able to get it in until next release.\n. Nice; can you make this PR into dev-next? That's the branch we use to base new releases off of.\n. Please rebase dev-next and resubmit off of current state of dev-next\n. Please rebase off of dev-next and resubmit from the current state of dev next.\n. You'd have to show what you code you tried with the empty `find` that caused an issue. We're currently using the empty find and haven't encountered an issue with it.  See also, this commit: https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/commit/ebac7e53f27ff3f839540757874f9d2cc088bf7c\n. Is this backwards compatible with how people were doing it before? Since it replaces an object that is passed in with a value?\n. Yea; we need to make it backwards compatible or I'll need to change the major version number; could you add those backwards compatibility checks?\n. Please fix the issues outlined in the travisCI Build, and rebase off of the current state of dev-next.\n. Please squash and re-issue this PR; the Travis CI build failed. If you click on the link it'll tell you why. Make sure you run jshint before trying to issue the PR; that sometimes trips people up.\n. Please submit this to dev-next instead of master, as per the CONTRIBUTING.md.\n. Please re-issue this PR against the dev-next branch.\n. Please re-issue this PR against the dev-next branch.\n. The CI build failed; looks like you need to run your code through our js-hint build first. Once you do that, pelase target your PR to devnext\n. PLease submit this to `dev-next`, and make sure you grab the latest from the dev-next branch.\n. Could you target this towards devnext?\n. I haven't tried this on iOS9 yet; I will. But it looks like the underlying plugin is the issue.\n. @jgsacris Which version are you using?\n. I meant, what version of this Cordova plugin, and what version of ngCordova?\n. This should be a doc update.\n. I've got a Parse.com plugin for Push; and it works with iOS; but I haven't tried using it with Android.  What   plugin are you using (not the wrapper, but the plugin) to integrate with Parse.com?\n\nThe one I'm using is not open source yet; although I need to open source it.\n. Push_v5 relies on the new Phonegap push plugin, not the deprecated one; it's important to note that. If you're using the deprecated plugin, it's not supported so if it even works, that's a miracle.\n. Can you show the code you're using to do this?\n. If you can clean this up; pull the latest; put just your changes into the branch; and don't build the branch, I'll be able to pull this into dev next.\n. The CI build failed; please retry this PR but grabbing the latest; and squashing into one unit of work commits; \n. Some of these checks failed in Travis CI. There are also a lot of merges here to keep up with; can you either separate discrete fixes into discrete PRs, or squash the ones that are related?\n. One of your commits failed the build; could you either branch this out into multiple PRs (one for each unit of work); or fix the commit that failed?\n. Also, this should be pointed at `dev-next`, not master.\n. This is great; but could you direct it at the dev-next branch, instead of master?\n. I believe this was resolved in our latest release.\n\nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/releases/tag/v0.1.24-alpha\n. This is good work; please re-issue the PR against our `dev-next` branch.\n. Thanks for this; I'll take a look at your changes. \n. Can you include an example application that demonstrates that and link to it? Either in a codepen or in a GH repo? Also, what are you referring to when you say \"First and Second Select\"?\n. The code wasn't in 1.21-alpha. That was a mistake on my part.\n. That may be a build error on my part.\n. If you had pulled down the bower package for v0.1.22-alpha, you wouldn't have this issue; but by installing against master, you do.  This is my fault; I somehow didn't add the actual build for master. It's in there now.  Whenever possible, you either want to use a tagged release, or if you want to live on the edge, go for `dev-next`.  \n. This is great, but could you target `dev-next` branch with your fix?\n. Could you squash these commits (using rebase -i) and re-issue this PR against Dev-next?\n. There are branch conflicts. Can you grab the latest and re-issue this PR against `dev-next`? \n. This isn't a bad idea; but we need better logic here; there should be conditional logic `if/else` around so you're not using the plugin if it's undefined.  A little more extensive work would need to be done against this PR to have to included.\n. Can you squash these down into one commit and re-issue PR? I like this; there are just a lot of commits here.\n. Can you link me to your sample project on Github that reproduces this issue that I can build and test against? If you're testing in the browser, it's not going to work.\n. Please issue this pr against `dev-next`\n. Is this on the device or on the web? Also, can you provide me a link to a repo I can pull down and put on my device to reproduce this?\n. That won't really help; if you can make a sample project that reproduces the issue; that will help.\n. Alright; let me know if anything turns up.\n. AFAIK, that's a GH Pages site; so there isn't much we can do on our end. @mhartington anything I'm missing?\n. I followed the directions in this Stack Overflow question; if that doesn't work I'll contact support: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11577147/how-to-fix-page-404-on-github-page\n. .... and we're back.\n. Please issue this PR against Dev-next.\n. CI build failed; please pull latest; check errors; and re issue against dev-next.\n. Why not make promises for openDB instead of using callbacks? That would match the rest of the plugin code.\n. If you can change your commit to use the code in your comment, it'd help this getting accepted.\n. This should be PR'd into dev-next; not master.\n. please issue this against the dev-next branch, per the contributing.md.\n. As per our Contributing.MD, could you redirect this to the dev-next branch so it can be included?\n. please put this into the dev-next branch.\n. I have no experience with Meteor, so it'll probably be far slower for me to do it than it would for you to do it and submit a PR since you have Meteor experience.\n. Can you point me to the github repo of the version you're referring to?\n. One issue with using that is that it's a Premium plugin; and that doesn't jive with people using it in an open-source project (or expecting to be able to use these plugins for free).  \n. @VicMota I thank you for your PR; but we'll have to put this into a premium branch to have it work; we can't break everyone else by pulling this in. An alternative would be you to fork the project and create a custom wrapper like I did for https://github.com/Jewelbots/ng-cordova-bluetoothle and just use that separately for your needs.  It's less than optimal, I know; but backwards capability is key.  \n. Can you post a reproducible example either in a repo or in a code pen so I can test? These plugins must be run on the device (or some can run in the emulator), so make sure you're doing it there and not just in the browser\n. I'll take a look at a code sample when it's provided so we can resolve this issue.\n. This is a good bug fix; but it needs to be pointed at dev-next, not master.\n. This is a good bug fi, but please issue it against `dev-next`.\n. Can you put this into the dev-next branch?\n. could you point this PR at the `dev-next` branch? That's where we put new features / bug fixes / PRs, etc.\n. Please fix the CI build issues and the branch conflicts and re-issue.\n. Seems like one more reason for us to mirror versions with compatible licenses and wrap installation of them on our own.  Other thoughts?\n. I knew I keep forgetting something.\n. This has been fixed; going forward we will include release notes.  Thanks for bringing this up.\n\nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/releases/tag/v0.1.24-alpha\n. This should be included in the next release.\n. @manduro this week\n. @Manduro This has been released under v0.1.24-alpha. \n. Please resolve the CI build issue, and re-issue this against the dev-next branch.\n. Please issue this PR against dev-next.\n. Please get the latest from dev-next and base the PR off of that. This currently has merge conflicts.\n. ```\ngit clone https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova.git\ncd ng-cordova\nnpm install\nbower install\ngulp karma\n```\n\nIf you get 'angular is not defined', it's because Angular is a bower dependency, so you have to run `bower install` before trying to run `gulp karma`.\n. Up for grabs. Feel free to create one and submit a PR against Dev-next to make it happen. \n. Please make this PR against dev-next, not master.\n. Build fails. Run Jscs and JSHint?\n. We had to upgrade our Jasmine instance. Thanks to #1174; it was fixed. Try again? And please target dev-next.\n. I'll take a look. Thanks.\n. I remember there being an Ionic issue with this recently; something about one of the tools they use dropping `S`; @mhartington do you remember which issue that was and the fix? I'll take a look into it, just super-paging you in case your google-fu is stronger.  That appears to be the issue here.\n. @ethanmay Also, the OAuth module that was in here was just removed; it was causing issues when trying to use it with the actual oauth submodule. @nraboy provides one you can install: https://github.com/nraboy/ng-cordova-oauth\n. We had to upgrade our Jasmine instance. Thanks to #1174; it was fixed. Try again? \n. We had to upgrade our Jasmine instance. Thanks to #1174; it was fixed. Try again? \n. turns out if I close and re-open, I can trigger another build through Travis. \n\nTIL.\n. We currently use this one: https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/cordova-plugin-googleplus and the wrapper is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/googlePlus.js How does your wrapper differ?\n. @sachinB94  The better way to handle this; since both of your wrappers rely on the same underlying plugin, would be for you to submit a PR that patches the existing wrapper with the different things you mention, instead of creating a whole new one.\n. @toddhalfpenny COuld you strip the dist/ files from your commit? Feel free to strip, rebase your branch; no need to close and re-open PR.\n. Yea; it's something I didn't learn until after allowing some PRs in that didn't do that and causing issues for myself.\n. Looks like there are merge conflicts; try again?\n. You're right. Go ahead and create the PR and target Dev-next\n. Thanks for catching that. I usually run gulp build so I didn't catch it.\n. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8569303/javascript-package-is-a-reserved-keyword\n\nGood find; could you submit a PR to resolve this issue?

So this should resolve the broken build issue currently plaguing travis CI? \n. Looking at the source code for the plugin, it appears it's hitting this line: \n\nhttps://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-file/blob/76a27ce9ad543e15c002bc0b4467c448b3619999/src/ios/CDVLocalFilesystem.m#L237\n\nWhich means at some point along the way, you have an error that doesn't match any other error it can catch; and it looks like it uses \"Abort\" as a default error.  \n\nhttps://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-file/blob/76a27ce9ad543e15c002bc0b4467c448b3619999/src/ios/CDVLocalFilesystem.m#L229\n\nIt looks like that can happen if:\n- If it was a directory creation request and the directory could not be created\n- If the file could not be successfully created.\n. If you're not using the background geolocation provider?  I'd suspect (although I don't know, since I've never used it) that the app would have to be active.  You'd also need to check (if this is iOS) that you have the right entitlements checked; that you can allow the app to process stuff when it's in the background.\n. branch conflicts.

And it would put the open in open source. And the great in grateful.\n. @will-ockmore thsts definitely Helpful. \n. Could be an issue in the underlying plugin and not the wrapper. Which push plugin wrapper are you using? And are there any open issues on the Cordova plugin page about Marshmellow?\n. Not dead. Just putting time into it as my current time allows. If you'd like to help, someone broke the Dev-next build. Fix it and you'll be my hero.\n. For more information on the PR that broke the dev-next build, see #1145 \n. Can you link to a minimal example app that reproduces this issue?\n. Please strip out the /dist files from this commit; as it causes conflicts when we go to build or include other changes.\n. Per the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), This should be issued against `dev-next`; not master. \n. Please issue against `dev-next` instead of master.\n. This should be targeted to dev-next, not master (per the Contributing.md file).\n. The Other issue is the build failed; so you may want to check why and run gulp jshint and gulp karma and gulp jscs to make sure you're in compliance with the build.\n. I like the idea; I believe we do something similar in other plugins.  Another pattern that some plugin wrappers use is to effectively check if the plugin is active; and if so return a resolvable promise; and if not, reject the promise.\n. @AllenConquest Looks like there are merge conflicts; you can do what it says at the commend line, or the easier path would be to close the repo again, checkout dev-next, make your changes, and then issue another PR.\n. Thanks! I'll make a build today to get this out.\n. I don't know what ng-cordova 1.6.2 is. Our latest version is 0.1.26-alpha. are you sure you're using the right package?\n. Can you link to your GH project or provide a sample reproduction here? Also, some plugins can't run in a browser, so how are you running this? On the device itself through XCode?\n. There are some plugins that have to be used on the device; if they're not you'll get rejections.\n. @adanalig Not all plugins have written rejections for when it's undefined; in the case of the `bluetoothSerial`, it does not: https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/bluetoothSerial.js#L9\n\nIt probably needs a \n\n```\nif (!$window.bluetoothSerial) { \n  $q.reject();\n}\n```\n\nMost plugins would need something like this if you want to use them gracefully in the browser.\n. Your PR didn't pass the Travis CI checks; if you can run the karma tests locally before committing, that'll help make sure you're passing the tests before checking in your branch. `gulp karma` will do it. You'll also want to run `gulp jscs`.\n. Error from travis:\n\n> PhantomJS 2.1.1 (Linux 0.0.0) Service: $cordovaSpinnerDialog should call window.plugins's spinnerDialog.show FAILED\n>   Expected spy spinnerDialog.show to have been called with [ 'hi', 'nice hi message', true ] but actual calls were [ 'hi', 'nice hi message', true, undefined ].\n\nYes, update the tests and include it as a commit in this current branch.\n\nAlso make sure the tests 'do the right thing' (whatever that happens to mean) for this particular usecase.\n. Can you link to your GH project or provide a sample reproduction here?  Also, some plugins can't run in a browser, so how are you running this? On the device itself through XCode?\n. If you run it in browser; or on the device through XCode; what do you see in the console? There should be errors.\n. what do you see when you run it on the device in Xcode?\n. Don't know your specific issue; but here's an example app that works with ngCordova; it appears you're missing a few things?\n\nhttps://github.com/Jewelbots/ble-demo-app/blob/master/app/scripts/app.js#L8\n. PRs welcome. :-)\n. Two issues:\n1. This PR should be made against dev-next, not master (that information can be found in CONTRIBUTING.md).  \n2. You updated the `dist` folder, you should never need to do that; simply update the `src` folder and when we make a build it'll be included.\n. Two issues:\n1. You updated `master` as opposed to `dev-next`.  Your PR should target our dev-next branch.\n2. You made changes to the 'dist' folder.  That's a build artifact; and you don't need to touch that. Simply make the change in the appropriate file in the `src` folder and next time we build it'll be there.\n. Looks like the build failed.

So the cancel should reject the promise instead of fulfilling it.  That makes sense; it would also be a breaking change from how it works now.  If you'd like to submit a PR; go ahead, here's the file that needs to be changed and here's the line numbers that need to change (don't forget about tests!)\n\nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/socialSharing.js\n\nAlso, funny enough the plugin wrapper notes it'll call success if you cancel a share via email; so it sounds like the logic needs to be changed there.\n. Looks like the most recent version is premium. We're based off of this version:\n\nhttps://github.com/christocracy/cordova-plugin-background-geolocation/tree/0.3.7\n\nWhich is released under the apache license.\n\nWe will probably need to fork the code at that version; since anything later is under a custom license that may not be good for most companies.\n. That's a good idea.\n. You've got to tell me the error and preferably put it in a repo and show me a minimal example that reproduces the issue.\n. If you create a pull request into 'dev-next' I'd be happy to accept it.\n. Hi!  \n\nThanks for filling out an issue, but it's hard to tell what you need with one sentence and a link to somewhere else.  Take a little time and fill me in on what's going on.  What's grunt cdnify? Why should we support it? What are you using it for?  \n. @salangar I responded on the Stack Overflow question, but you're not even showing us how you're invoking ngCordova in your app.js; so it's impossible for us to tell if you've gotten the declaration working. For an example of an app that uses ngCordova, take a look at https://github.com/Jewelbots/ble-demo-app/blob/master/app/scripts/app.js#L8\n. @albertonaperijr I need you to provide a minimal, complete, verifiable example so I can help you. Include what models of phone you've tested this on as well. If you have a github repo that reproduces this issue that I can build and run, that will also work. http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\n. This is great; can you make this against `dev-next` instead of `master`, and don't include any of the build files in the commit?  Feel free to run `gulp jscs`. After you run `gulp build`, you can revert any changes to files in ./dist/*.\n. Still hoping you'll target this against `dev-next` instead of `master`.\n. Could you point this to `dev-next` instead of master, and make sure none of the files in ./dist/\\* are included in the commit?\n. In the \"Files changed\", it only shows the plugin file; it doesn't show that you added it to the list of plugins. did you forget to do that or revert that action in one of your commits?\n. yes\n. This looks great; I'd say the only change you need to make is to not include the files from ./dist/\\* when committing; those are build files and merge conflicts are hell when those are changed outside a release. We'll automatically update the files in ./dist/ when we deploy.\n. Yes\n. You are correct; it works for the first plugin, not the second. If you want to create a patch that lets it work for both, I'll gladly accept a PR.\n. ^^ What @ihadeed said.\n. This looks great; can you run this PR against dev-next instead of master?\n. It's still pointing to master.\n. Same issue as your other PR; I didn't realize you had just copied the script into the dist/ folder without the appropriate files being made in the src/plugins folder.\n. Looks like for `getPicture()` someone implemented the ability to resolve with a null promise. https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/camera.js#L12 Since it's just a wrapper, if the underlying plugin has been changed to work on a simulator, than this will too.\n\nLooks like the underlying plugin also supports the browser:\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-camera\n\nhuzah. If you'd like to submit a PR to fix; checkout our `gh-pages` branch, make the fix, and open a PR.\n. Huzzah was a misspelled statement of elation. If you'd like to submit a fix @itfschoen, I'd be happy to accept a PR\n. It's in `dev-next`, and will be in master during the next release, which will be next week.\nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/dev-next/src/plugins/toast.js#L69\n. This should be put in dev-next branch; which I believe already has this PR.\n. I love some of these changes; so if you target the dev-next branch and you pull the latest from it to do your additions off of, I'd be happy to add it. \n. The file should be added in the plugin folder; not just added to the 'dist' folder. The dist folder is a build artifact folder and is not actually a source file itself. You should add a file here: https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/tree/master/src/plugins and then reference that plugin in the list of plugins.  \n. Thanks for your work on this. One issue: \n\n```\nsrc/plugins/wikitudePlugin.js\n  line 18  col 77  'success' is defined but never used.\n```\n\nHere's the full output:\n\n```\n[00:34:56] Using gulpfile ~/build/driftyco/ng-cordova/gulpfile.js\n[00:34:56] Starting 'jshint'...\n[00:34:56] Starting 'jscs'...\n[00:34:56] Finished 'jscs' after 112 ms\nsrc/plugins/wikitudePlugin.js\n  line 18  col 77  'success' is defined but never used.\n\u2716 1 problem\n[00:34:59] 'jshint' errored after 2.63 s\n[00:34:59] Error in plugin 'gulp-jshint'\nMessage:\n    JSHint failed for: src/plugins/wikitudePlugin.js\nnpm ERR! Test failed.  See above for more details.\n```\n\nYou can use `gulp jscs` to run the style checker.\n. Drop the dist/ng-cordova.js change and you'll be fine. Just remember when you build to have the commit ignore changes in the `dist/*` folders\n. The only remaining issue is that you shouldn't have any changes in the dist/\\* folders (reason being, that's an artifact folder and changes there are really hard to merge in; so we make changes there when we release).\n. Unfortunately you can't just add the `.gitignore` to the `dist/` folder, since we do rely on that folder; it's a build artifact that is used in master to allow for bower installs.\n. revert the files you changed in dist/ to their previous state (before you messed with them) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/215718/reset-or-revert-a-specific-file-to-a-specific-revision-using-git\n. @yailPeralta Your commit still shows the dist change: https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/1278/files\n\nIsn't Git fun?\n. awesome, thanks!\n. You're right; that's not trivial. \n\nThere are a few possible solutions:\n- \"Build\" dev-next in a nightly fashion (on our end);\n- more frequent releases (I tend not to do that because I want to give time for people to test out differences\n  - going back to asking PRs to build and merge in ./dist (a nightmare for contributors, and a nightmare to merge back into master).\n. do you see any other ways of handling it?\n. I just released v0.1.27-alpha; so that should solve your immediate issue; and we'll work on doing both.\n\nThanks for bringing this up, @MatthieuMB \n. Thanks; but please drop any files you changed in dist/*; those are build artifacts and shouldn't be included in a PR.\n. @osirisr @luisUrrutia Still waiting for the  OP (or anyone else that wants to) to actually base it off of dev-next and issue a PR against dev-next. https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/993\n. @datnordstrom You can always take the time to make the changes in an up-to-date fork of dev-next and submit a PR. That'll help it get accepted faster.\n. Feel free to add a PR to the docs to correct them. This is good work, thank you!\n. What's going wrong that you don't want to use `$cordovaContacts`? Also; you can use any cordova plugin without the ngCordova wrapper; just install the plugin via the command line, include the script in your `index.html`, and for `jshint` set a global where you use it.\n. Ionic is not compatible with iOS3; therefore ngCordova is not compatible with iOS3.\n. Can you link me to a reproducible example, either a codepen or a github repo?\n. Need code that reproduces the issue with the wrapper (and without it is helpful), also need the version of the plugin and the wrapper you're using, and whatever errors you see in XCode logs.\n. REally good to know. Thanks!\n. If the wrapper doesn't support it, I'll happily accept a PR to support it.\n. I wouldn't be surprised if the contacts wrapper was based on an older version of the plugin. \n. Feel free to upgrade the wrapper to match the current implementation. I'll be happy to include the change in the release notes.\n. Can you provide an example that reproduces the issue?\n. Please do not include any files from the dist/\\* folders in your changes. Those are automatically generated when we build for release.\n. Please target this against dev-next, not master. https://github.com/blog/2224-change-the-base-branch-of-a-pull-request\n. Also, this PR needs to include the source file changed. There should be no dist/\\* files in the PR, as those are build artifacts.  You should add the plugin to the folder here: https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/tree/dev-next/src/plugins, and add it to the list of plugins here: https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/6914f8e2eeab89a6ef6c145a7a1cdaac3ad7e809/src/plugins/module.js\n. This PR: https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/1306/files is a great example of how to add a plugin.\n. Could you repoint this to dev-next instead of master? https://github.com/blog/2224-change-the-base-branch-of-a-pull-request\n. I don't see the jscs hint fix in your commits. IS it in this PR?\n. the base branch needs to be changed to `dev-next`.\n. three issues:\n1. You made the change to the dist/\\* folder insetad of the src/plugins/<plugin-name>.js.  That means that change won't be there next build.  The dist folder is just a build artifact. If you want the change to stick around it has to go in the actual src/plugins/<plugin-name>.js file.\n2. Please target the `dev-next` instead of master with your PR.\n3. Please omit any dist/\\* files from your commit; it gives future merging a headache.\n. Please put this against `dev-next`, not master.\n. Also, please don't include any files from dist/*; as those are build artifacts.\n. Still have the issue with all the changes in dist/_. The changes just need to be done in the plugins/folder; not in the dist/_ folder.\n. Correct. Aiming for a release this week.\n. This should target Dev-next, and you only made the change to the mocks file. Did you mean to make it to the plugin file as well?\n. No time to learn like the present: In your PR, you can change the branch using this: \n\nhttps://github.com/blog/2224-change-the-base-branch-of-a-pull-request\n\nAs far as the mock being the only thing being wrong; that makes sense.\n. the build failed + this should target `dev-next`, not master.\n. @MarcusXie You have to provide a working reproduction for me to see the issue.  I can't really guess. :-/\n. You don't have the underlying push notification plugin installed.\n. Have you tried the plugin from: https://github.com/Jewelbots/parse-phonegap-plugin-push ? Also the parse-phonegap-plugin-push on that repo\n. Also keep in mind this doesn't work when you are running it in the web browser or emulating a device. It has to be on the physical device to work.\n. This is a underlying plugin issue, not a wrapper issue. Try here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-12085?jql=project%20%3D%20CB%20AND%20status%20in%20(Open%2C%20%22In%20Progress%22%2C%20Reopened)%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20AND%20component%20%3D%20%22Plugin%20File%22%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC%2C%20summary%20ASC%2C%20updatedDate%20DESC\n.

    "mzbyszynski": "Seems like in order to write karma tests ng-cordova code itself you would need mocks for the cordova plugins themselves.\n. @PureSpider There is the readFileAbsolute() and readFileMetadataAbsolute() methods that let's you specify an absolute path. I don't think those will help for writing files though. Following the conventions of the $cordovaFile api I would say writeFileAbsolute() is needed at least.\n. Hi @zarko-tg, \n\n$cordovaFile.downloadFile() and $cordovaFile.uploadFile() actually wrap the functionality provided by the  file transfer plugin, so you should take a look at those methods. Is there any functionality from the file transfer plugin that you need that isn't supported by these two methods as they stand today?\n. Yes you are correct, the documentation should be more clear. If you install the file-transfer plugin everything should work.\n. Thanks for the feedback @pbernasconi! I will try to break it up into some smaller PRs\n. This problem exists with most of the methods in $cordofaFile... most of the fs api calls are missing error callbacks. I've fixed the problem @SpenceDiNicolantonio mentions as well as all the other similar ones in other methods in pull request #306.\n. @pbernasconi I have some unit tests that I'll add in another PR tonight. I've used a the file upload methods and a few of the ones for reading files in the application I've been working on so those have worked well. I haven't tested every possible error condition but I have tested the error handling a little bit so I believe the the principles are correct at least.\n. @Leftyx Unless I'm misunderstanding what your issue is, I think you should be able to get around this if you run bower in interactive mode one time. In interactive mode it will prompt you for which angular version you want to use to resolve the conflict, and it will add a \"resolutions\" property to your bower.json file and after that it will choose that version of angular regardless of what your dependencies say.\n\nFor example, if you want to use the angular version specified by ionic, your bower.json file would like like this:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"name\": \"ionic-cordova-seed\",\n  \"private\": \"true\",\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"ionic\": \"driftyco/ionic-bower#1.0.0-beta.12\",\n    \"ngCordova\": \"^0.1.4-alpha\"\n  },\n  \"resolutions\": {\n     \"angular\": \"~1.2.17\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nDoes that help?\n. Sure I'll check it out.\n. Travis is using the PhantomJS 1.9 browser, which doesn't have an implementation of the HTML5 File System API. My unit tests were relying on that to work in a browser, so I removed them for now. Not sure if it is worth trying to mock the file system or just wait for PhantomJS 2.0\n. Hi @soic-iupui,\n\nIt seems like there might be a discrepancy between the way the Apache File plugin is written and the way Chrome supports the LocalFileSystem API. The plugin puts the LocalFileSystem types under `window.LocalFileSystem.PERSISTENT` and `window.LocalFileSystem.TEMPORARY`, but I think Chrome puts those constants directly under window (e.g., `window.PERSISTENT` and `window.TEMPORARY`). That would explain the error in Chrome, but I should work on Android. Have you tried it on any other platforms or are you just working on Android?\n\nAlso, can you try removing ng-cordova-mocks.js and seeing if that helps with the error on Android? Or is there a reason you need that? \n. What version of ngCordova are you using? I do see a small bug in $cordovaFile but you should still be getting some kind of response. \n. Well it still doesn't work in the latest version, could you try searching for `function getFileSystem()` in your ng-cordova.js and replace that function with this?\n\n``` javascript\n    function getFilesystem() {\n      var q = $q.defer();\n      try {\n        $window.requestFileSystem($window.PERSISTENT, 1024 * 1024, q.resolve, q.reject); \n      } catch (err) {\n        q.reject(err);\n      }\n      return q.promise;\n    }\n```\n\nHopefully that should at least fix this problem in Chrome? Once we figure out what the actual problem is I'd be happy to sumbit a PR to correct it ASAP.\n. What is the error message you are getting now? The checkDir method will fail unless you pass in the path to a valid directory that is readable by your application. Take a look at the cordova file plugin for details: https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-file/blob/master/doc/index.md#where-to-store-files\nIt looks like there is a section on Android FileSystem quirks so be sure to check that out as well.\n. Hi @soic-iupui, just checking in to see if you were able to resolve your issue?\n. What is the error you are getting?\n. You will definitely get that error when testing on a desktop browser, but if you are seeing that error on your android device as well then I think you are right, there must be something amiss with your project setup. \n. The only thing I can think of is that there is a something in the $cordovaFile code that is throwing an exception and never resolving or rejecting the promise. Either that or maybe the cordova file plugin activity is happening outside angular's digest cycle so the promise update isn't being acknowledged, but I think I would have seen that in my testing already so I'm not sure. If it is an exception then only way I can think of to catch it is to put try/catch blocks in each method that you are hitting in $cordovaFile and make sure to reject the promise on error. And you could rule out the angular digest issue injecting $rootScope into $cordovaFile and calling $rootScope.digest() inside the callbacks from the file system methods. This _should_ throw an error saying you are already in a digest cycle, but if it doesn't then that would mean that's the bug.\n\nI've never done any cordova/android development so I'm not sure if this is possible, but if there is a way for you to access the console.log output from the JavaScript code you are running on the device, I would probably start by injecting $log into $cordovaFile and start putting $log.console() messages everywhere to see how far you are getting....\n\nAlso, could you try some other methods, like listDir or createFile? Those should work on your browser as well if you do not refer to any cordova.\\* variables.\n\n``` javascript\n$cordovaFile.listDir('./', true)\n  .then(function(entries) {\n   //.. success\n  }, function(err) {\n   //... error\n});\n$cordovaFile.createFile('test-file.txt', true)\n  .then(function(fileEntry) {\n   //.. success\n  }, function(err) {\n   //... error\n});\n```\n. Hi @webfacebg  I have a fix for this, I just forgot to submit the PR. I'll do it asap.\n. Hi @littlebang, \n\nCordova implements the HTML5 storage API, so you can just use any that api directly or any angular module that wraps that API. For example, I've used [ngStorage](https://github.com/gsklee/ngStorage) in Cordova projects without any additional Cordova plugins and it worked great.\n\nHope that helps,\n\nMarc\n. Hi @poshetz, \n\nHave you tried connecting the Safari JavaScript debugger to your simulator and stepping through the javascript to see how far along your method goes? I'm not sure how `$cordovaMedia` works but I do know that `$cordovaFile.checkFile()` takes a relative path, not an absolute one, so if that is the correct path to the file, you should try calling `$cordovaFile.readFileMetadataAbsolute()` instead. But my guess is you aren't reaching that code yet, since you aren't seeing any console logs at all.\n\nHope that helps!\n. Hi @cfjedimaster,\n\nTHe `createDir()` method is expecting a relative path, which I think is why it is failing. Do you need the directory to be in the `cordova.file.dataDirectory`? If not then just pass the directory name as a relative path and it should save it in a valid location for persistent file storage and you will be able to accessing files in the directory by passing the same relative path to any of the other $cordovaFile methods (except for the methods \"Absolute\" methods, which work with absolute paths).\n\nHope that helps.\n. Seems like in order to write karma tests ng-cordova code itself you would need mocks for the cordova plugins themselves.\n. @PureSpider There is the readFileAbsolute() and readFileMetadataAbsolute() methods that let's you specify an absolute path. I don't think those will help for writing files though. Following the conventions of the $cordovaFile api I would say writeFileAbsolute() is needed at least.\n. Hi @zarko-tg, \n\n$cordovaFile.downloadFile() and $cordovaFile.uploadFile() actually wrap the functionality provided by the  file transfer plugin, so you should take a look at those methods. Is there any functionality from the file transfer plugin that you need that isn't supported by these two methods as they stand today?\n. Yes you are correct, the documentation should be more clear. If you install the file-transfer plugin everything should work.\n. Thanks for the feedback @pbernasconi! I will try to break it up into some smaller PRs\n. This problem exists with most of the methods in $cordofaFile... most of the fs api calls are missing error callbacks. I've fixed the problem @SpenceDiNicolantonio mentions as well as all the other similar ones in other methods in pull request #306.\n. @pbernasconi I have some unit tests that I'll add in another PR tonight. I've used a the file upload methods and a few of the ones for reading files in the application I've been working on so those have worked well. I haven't tested every possible error condition but I have tested the error handling a little bit so I believe the the principles are correct at least.\n. @Leftyx Unless I'm misunderstanding what your issue is, I think you should be able to get around this if you run bower in interactive mode one time. In interactive mode it will prompt you for which angular version you want to use to resolve the conflict, and it will add a \"resolutions\" property to your bower.json file and after that it will choose that version of angular regardless of what your dependencies say.\n\nFor example, if you want to use the angular version specified by ionic, your bower.json file would like like this:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"name\": \"ionic-cordova-seed\",\n  \"private\": \"true\",\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"ionic\": \"driftyco/ionic-bower#1.0.0-beta.12\",\n    \"ngCordova\": \"^0.1.4-alpha\"\n  },\n  \"resolutions\": {\n     \"angular\": \"~1.2.17\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nDoes that help?\n. Sure I'll check it out.\n. Travis is using the PhantomJS 1.9 browser, which doesn't have an implementation of the HTML5 File System API. My unit tests were relying on that to work in a browser, so I removed them for now. Not sure if it is worth trying to mock the file system or just wait for PhantomJS 2.0\n. Hi @soic-iupui,\n\nIt seems like there might be a discrepancy between the way the Apache File plugin is written and the way Chrome supports the LocalFileSystem API. The plugin puts the LocalFileSystem types under `window.LocalFileSystem.PERSISTENT` and `window.LocalFileSystem.TEMPORARY`, but I think Chrome puts those constants directly under window (e.g., `window.PERSISTENT` and `window.TEMPORARY`). That would explain the error in Chrome, but I should work on Android. Have you tried it on any other platforms or are you just working on Android?\n\nAlso, can you try removing ng-cordova-mocks.js and seeing if that helps with the error on Android? Or is there a reason you need that? \n. What version of ngCordova are you using? I do see a small bug in $cordovaFile but you should still be getting some kind of response. \n. Well it still doesn't work in the latest version, could you try searching for `function getFileSystem()` in your ng-cordova.js and replace that function with this?\n\n``` javascript\n    function getFilesystem() {\n      var q = $q.defer();\n      try {\n        $window.requestFileSystem($window.PERSISTENT, 1024 * 1024, q.resolve, q.reject); \n      } catch (err) {\n        q.reject(err);\n      }\n      return q.promise;\n    }\n```\n\nHopefully that should at least fix this problem in Chrome? Once we figure out what the actual problem is I'd be happy to sumbit a PR to correct it ASAP.\n. What is the error message you are getting now? The checkDir method will fail unless you pass in the path to a valid directory that is readable by your application. Take a look at the cordova file plugin for details: https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-file/blob/master/doc/index.md#where-to-store-files\nIt looks like there is a section on Android FileSystem quirks so be sure to check that out as well.\n. Hi @soic-iupui, just checking in to see if you were able to resolve your issue?\n. What is the error you are getting?\n. You will definitely get that error when testing on a desktop browser, but if you are seeing that error on your android device as well then I think you are right, there must be something amiss with your project setup. \n. The only thing I can think of is that there is a something in the $cordovaFile code that is throwing an exception and never resolving or rejecting the promise. Either that or maybe the cordova file plugin activity is happening outside angular's digest cycle so the promise update isn't being acknowledged, but I think I would have seen that in my testing already so I'm not sure. If it is an exception then only way I can think of to catch it is to put try/catch blocks in each method that you are hitting in $cordovaFile and make sure to reject the promise on error. And you could rule out the angular digest issue injecting $rootScope into $cordovaFile and calling $rootScope.digest() inside the callbacks from the file system methods. This _should_ throw an error saying you are already in a digest cycle, but if it doesn't then that would mean that's the bug.\n\nI've never done any cordova/android development so I'm not sure if this is possible, but if there is a way for you to access the console.log output from the JavaScript code you are running on the device, I would probably start by injecting $log into $cordovaFile and start putting $log.console() messages everywhere to see how far you are getting....\n\nAlso, could you try some other methods, like listDir or createFile?

No submodules. \nToo many moving parts for little to no gain. \n\nIf people have their own plugin wrapper they want to contribute, they can make a PR to add them to ngCordova, or maintain their own repos. \n. Might be worth ditching the submodule and either \nA) Pulling ngCordovaOauth in officially\nB) Take ngCordovaOauth out of ng-cordova proper and make it's module\n\nNot a fan of git submodules TBH. \ncc @nraboy \n. We all make mistakes :grin: \n\nWhat you could do instead of running gulp-git inline, is this\n\n```\ngulp.task('git', function(){\ngit.updateSubmodule({ args: '--init --remote' });\n}\n\ngulp.task('build', ['git'], function () {\n```\n\nThis will call git before performing the build task.\n. Looks good, @nraboy thanks. \n\nWill do a release in the AM. \n. Hmm, @gortok and I started talking about this in https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/issues/873 , it would require some work but I think it would be possible. \n\nA lot of this would have to depend on how cordova is handling the move npm. \n\nhttp://plugins.cordova.io/npm/index.html\n\nSo there is an api that we could leverage that to get the cordova plugins and their plugin version. \nAgain this would require some work to figure out how they're doing it and if we would need to update ngcordova's site.\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/cordova-registry-web\n. I don't think we need to make separate repos for each plugin. The speed at which apache moves does give us a lot of time to test out plugins from Github directly to make sure that everything works so I'm not too concerned.\n\nAs far as future version of ngCordova goes, yes it will move to plain observables, but the benefit there is that the end user shouldn't have to change much in there code. All of the changes would be internal. People who reply on ngCordova won't notice a big change to the code they write. So when 2.0 of ngCordova does come around, it will mean the end of ngCordova 1 and no more angular watches, but there will be an easy migration. \n\nClosing this.\n. At least for the official cordova plugins, there is a release process that each one goes through and then they get put to a vote. They all get tested to make sure they don't break the other plugins. \n\nIf the geolocation plugin gets updated, we can be sure that it wont break another plugin. \n. This looks like an error with plugin as not using ng-cordova still has an issues. Closing since ng-cordova is not the source of the issue.\n. Since OAuth is a submodle, it would have to be installed separately. \nhttps://github.com/nraboy/ng-cordova-oauth\n. It will be removed completely. We will point to your repo instead\n. Hmm, are you seeing this using ionic as well? \n. Hmm, alright. Just to be sure, can you give this a try without ngcordova and just use the raw cordova api. Ngcordova shouldn't be messing with click/touch events, so I'm not sure the issue is here.\n. Hmm, what version of bower do you have? I just gave this a try and it install without an issue.\n\n```\nbower ionic#1.1.0               cached git://github.com/driftyco/ionic-bower.git#1.1.0\nbower ionic#1.1.0             validate 1.1.0 against git://github.com/driftyco/ionic-bower.git#1.1.0\nbower ngCordova#*               cached git://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova.git#0.1.20-alpha\nbower ngCordova#*             validate 0.1.20-alpha against git://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova.git#*\nbower angular#>= 1.2.23         cached git://github.com/angular/bower-angular.git#1.4.3\nbower angular#>= 1.2.23       validate 1.4.3 against git://github.com/angular/bower-angular.git#>= 1.2.23\nbower angular-animate#1.4.3     cached git://github.com/angular/bower-angular-animate.git#1.4.3\nbower angular-animate#1.4.3   validate 1.4.3 against git://github.com/angular/bower-angular-animate.git#1.4.3\nbower angular-sanitize#1.4.3    cached git://github.com/angular/bower-angular-sanitize.git#1.4.3\nbower angular-sanitize#1.4.3  validate 1.4.3 against git://github.com/angular/bower-angular-sanitize.git#1.4.3\nbower angular-ui-router#0.2.13  cached git://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router.git#0.2.13\nbower angular-ui-router#0.2.13         validate 0.2.13 against git://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router.git#0.2.13\nbower angular#>= 1.2.23                     new version for git://github.com/angular/bower-angular.git#>= 1.2.23\nbower angular#>= 1.2.23                 resolve git://github.com/angular/bower-angular.git#>= 1.2.23\nbower angular#>= 1.2.23                download https://github.com/angular/bower-angular/archive/v1.4.4.tar.gz\nbower angular#>= 1.0.8                   cached git://github.com/angular/bower-angular.git#1.4.3\nbower angular#>= 1.0.8                 validate 1.4.3 against git://github.com/angular/bower-angular.git#>= 1.0.8\nbower angular#>= 1.0.8                      new version for git://github.com/angular/bower-angular.git#>= 1.0.8\nbower angular#>= 1.0.8                  resolve git://github.com/angular/bower-angular.git#>= 1.0.8\nbower angular#>= 1.0.8                 download https://github.com/angular/bower-angular/archive/v1.4.4.tar.gz\nbower angular#>= 1.2.23                 extract archive.tar.gz\nbower angular#>= 1.0.8                  extract archive.tar.gz\nbower angular#>= 1.0.8                 resolved git://github.com/angular/bower-angular.git#1.4.4\nbower angular#>= 1.2.23                resolved git://github.com/angular/bower-angular.git#1.4.4\nbower ngCordova#~0.1.20-alpha           install ngCordova#0.1.20-alpha\nbower ionic#1.1.0                       install ionic#1.1.0\nbower angular-ui-router#0.2.13          install angular-ui-router#0.2.13\nbower angular-sanitize#1.4.3            install angular-sanitize#1.4.3\nbower angular-animate#1.4.3             install angular-animate#1.4.3\nbower angular#>= 1.0.8                  install angular#1.4.4\nbower angular#1.4.3                      cached git://github.com/angular/bower-angular.git#1.4.3\nbower angular#1.4.3                    validate 1.4.3 against git://github.com/angular/bower-angular.git#1.4.3\n\nngCordova#0.1.20-alpha www/lib/ngCordova\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 angular#1.4.3\n\nionic#1.1.0 www/lib/ionic\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 angular#1.4.3\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 angular-animate#1.4.3\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 angular-sanitize#1.4.3\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 angular-ui-router#0.2.13\n\nangular-ui-router#0.2.13 www/lib/angular-ui-router\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 angular#1.4.3\n\nangular-sanitize#1.4.3 www/lib/angular-sanitize\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 angular#1.4.3\n\nangular-animate#1.4.3 www/lib/angular-animate\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 angular#1.4.3\n\nangular#1.4.3 ../../../.cache/bower/packages/ef2188def21eb1bbd1f1792311942a53/1.4.3\n```\n\n```\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"ngCordova\": \"~0.1.20-alpha\"\n  }\n```\n.

Is that already in the works? \n. Yes\n. Hi there! So using an iFrame is probably not the correct solution. \n\nThe problem with links in the iFrame stems from the fact that it's an entire separate context. It does not have cordova injected into it, it doesn't load angular. iFrames have completely isolated context from the parent html that loads them. \n\nYou're best solution is to use the `trustAsHtml` method and figure out the issues on the contents styling.\n. PRs are always welcomed :grin: \n. This will stay open until a PR is made to fix the documentation. \n. PRs for docs can be made to https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/tree/gh-pages\n. So the telerik plugins are actually just the standard cordova plugins that have been forked and tested by the people at telerik. There really is no difference between the two.\n. Yes, ionic and ngcordova are compatible with cordova5.\n. Closing this as it is not an issue with ng-cordova, but a but with the cordova-cli\nThis probably has to do with the move of plugins to npm. \nLooks like the first plugin isn't on npm. \n. Confirming that 5.2 works as well. Please update your cordova version. \n. What is the BLE plugin that you have added a wrapper for? \nI like the idea of supporting a minimum cordova version. Only issue with that is cordova-ios is now at 3.9 and cordova-android is at 4.1. So pinning a particular version of cordova is a bit tough.\n. Now how does this differ from this BLE plugin? \n\nhttps://github.com/don/BluetoothSerial\nhttps://github.com/don/cordova-plugin-ble-central\n. So again, what the main difference between the plugins then? Doesn't seem necessary to add another bluetooth plugin. ngCordova does have both the BLE plugins, just no docs at the moment. \n. Sounds like it's an issue with the sqlite plugin. Do you have this issue if you use the raw cordova api? \n. Not really.

I think it is a good and easy solution. Thanks.\n\n11.09.2014, 12:58, \"Moritz\" notifications@github.com:\n\n> Resolving just is working with one parameter, tho. So when you need tx and res we need to combine it into a object like this: \n> \n> db.transaction(function (tx) {\n>   tx.executeSql(query, binding, function (tx, result) {\n>     q.resolve({\n>       transaction: tx,\n>       result: result\n>     });\n>   }, function (transaction, error) {\n>     q.reject({\n>       transaction: transaction,\n>       error: error\n>     });\n>   });\n> });\n> \n> Usage would be:\n> \n> $cordovaSQLite.execute(db, query, binding)\n>   .then(function (response) {\n>     result = response.result;\n>     // console.log(response.transaction);\n>   }, function (response) {\n>     error = response.error;\n>     // console.log(response.transaction);\n>   });\n> \n> @PavelPolyakov, @pbernasconi What you think about it ?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n\n## \n\n\u041e\u0442\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043e \u0438\u0437 \u043c\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u042f\u043d\u0434\u0435\u043a\u0441.\u041f\u043e\u0447\u0442\u044b: http://m.ya.ru/ymail\n.

    "mica16": "You're welcome :)\n. @felquis I tested on Samsung S5, geolocation works.\nOn a Samsung S4, I don't get Javascript errors...but I don't get any data. I did: \n\n```\nreturn $cordovaGeolocation.getCurrentPosition({\n                    enableHighAccuracy: true\n                }).then(function (position) {\n                    alert(JSON.stringify(position));\n                    return {\n                        lat: position.coords.latitude,\n                        lon: position.coords.longitude\n                    };\n                }, function (error) {\n                    alert(JSON.stringify(error));\n                    return $q.reject(error);\n                });\n```\n\nNo Javascript alert is displayed at all, meaning that ngCordova doesn't return a promise in this case...\n\nActually, when I don't set the \"Position\" option (to get the local position of the phone user) on the Samsung parameter section, I don't get any data..and no errors is displayed... \nI expected some errors to appear, involved by the promise.\n=> can't use the app if \"Position\" is not set.\n. Hi,\n\nActually, I noticed that when the property `enableHighAccuracy` is set to `true`, the phone has to enabled GeoPosition, otherwise the Geolocation by the browser is not used, explaining my post above. \nI found it very frustrating for certain lambda users that aren't aware about their phone settings. \n\nPersonally, in the context of my app, I set `enableHighAccuracy` to `false`, in order to benefit from the browser solution, in case were the GPS wasn't enabled.\n. I found a tricky bug: \nHaving this code:  \n\n```\n$cordovaGeolocation.getCurrentPosition({\n                    enableHighAccuracy: true,\n                    timeout: 15000\n                })\n```\n\nand in the Android phone settings about \"Position\", the radio button set on \"GPS only\", \nIt ALWAYS reachs the timeout !\nAll users argued me that my queries were too long (more than 15 seconds in this case), but when I tell them: \n\"Try to set the Position mode to 'High accuracy'\",  they say: wow now it's fast ! \n\nQuestion so: why is timeout reached even when  'enableHighAccuracy: true' when using GPS ONLY ?\n\nHere's a related stackoverflow question I found on the subject but no answer..: \n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/27835425/html5-geolocation-not-working-with-gps-only-location-service-mode-on-android\n\nAnd here's mine I asked: \n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/29411697/timeout-about-geolocation-always-reached-when-position-mode-is-set-to-device-on\n. Hi, \n\nActually, I noticed that I based my plugin installation from an older URL. (bad..)\nI haven't tested against the new yet since all works for now (no real need to update) but I'm pretty sure that's due to this bad used url ;)\n\nThanks a lot !\n\nMichael\n. +1   any update on this?\n. You're welcome :)\n. @felquis I tested on Samsung S5, geolocation works.\nOn a Samsung S4, I don't get Javascript errors...but I don't get any data. I did: \n\n```\nreturn $cordovaGeolocation.getCurrentPosition({\n                    enableHighAccuracy: true\n                }).then(function (position) {\n                    alert(JSON.stringify(position));\n                    return {\n                        lat: position.coords.latitude,\n                        lon: position.coords.longitude\n                    };\n                }, function (error) {\n                    alert(JSON.stringify(error));\n                    return $q.reject(error);\n                });\n```\n\nNo Javascript alert is displayed at all, meaning that ngCordova doesn't return a promise in this case...\n\nActually, when I don't set the \"Position\" option (to get the local position of the phone user) on the Samsung parameter section, I don't get any data..and no errors is displayed... \nI expected some errors to appear, involved by the promise.\n=> can't use the app if \"Position\" is not set.\n. Hi,\n\nActually, I noticed that when the property `enableHighAccuracy` is set to `true`, the phone has to enabled GeoPosition, otherwise the Geolocation by the browser is not used, explaining my post above. \nI found it very frustrating for certain lambda users that aren't aware about their phone settings. \n\nPersonally, in the context of my app, I set `enableHighAccuracy` to `false`, in order to benefit from the browser solution, in case were the GPS wasn't enabled.\n. I found a tricky bug: \nHaving this code:  \n\n```\n$cordovaGeolocation.getCurrentPosition({\n                    enableHighAccuracy: true,\n                    timeout: 15000\n                })\n```\n\nand in the Android phone settings about \"Position\", the radio button set on \"GPS only\", \nIt ALWAYS reachs the timeout !\nAll users argued me that my queries were too long (more than 15 seconds in this case), but when I tell them: \n\"Try to set the Position mode to 'High accuracy'\",  they say: wow now it's fast ! \n\nQuestion so: why is timeout reached even when  'enableHighAccuracy: true' when using GPS ONLY ?\n\nHere's a related stackoverflow question I found on the subject but no answer..: \n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/27835425/html5-geolocation-not-working-with-gps-only-location-service-mode-on-android\n\nAnd here's mine I asked: \n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/29411697/timeout-about-geolocation-always-reached-when-position-mode-is-set-to-device-on\n.

By including `:3000`, the logic won't know how to respond.\n\nOn The Facebook dashboard, make sure you set the Oauth Redirect URI to `http://localhost/callback`\n\nA working demo application can be seen here:\n\nhttps://github.com/nraboy/ng-cordova-facebook-example\n\nRegards,\n. I agree with @pbernasconi.  If your looking to integrate with the Facebook app, then the Facebook plugin is the way to go.\n\nHowever, $cordovaOauth does use Oauth2.  It is API based and is a fine solution.  It will only be isolated from the Facebook official app.\n\nRegards,\n. After you sign in using $cordovaOauth, you just save the access token and the user won't need to signin again.\n\nMy example, I force a sign in every time.  Leave the rest to your imagination.\n\nRegards,\n. Yes, I understand there is a convenience factor, but $cordovaOauth will never do that.  It is not the intention of the module.  $cordovaOauth is for web based authentication and it accomplishes the same end result as the app based authentication.

Let me know if there are flaws in my plan.\n. Hey guys,\n\nI want to put some pressure on this.  Has anyone had a chance to review this concept for ngCordova?\n\nI get too many inquiries to manage regarding the versioning differences between ng-cordova-oauth and ng-cordova.  Time is too short to keep them both up to date which is why I think submodules to my repo is the best option.\n\nThanks,\n\ncc @mlynch @pbernasconi @mhartington @cfjedimaster @saimon24\n. Awesome, thanks for the merge!\n\nBecause I added Git related items to the Gulp script, I don't think it will be an issue.  People won't need to worry about manually obtaining the oauth code.  Just build and you're good to go.\n\nI'll keep an eye out if this is causing issues for people.\n\nThanks,\n. Thanks for the compliment!  I'm not so certain this would work in all cases though.  I specifically designed `ng-cordova-oauth` for use with AngularJS, but others are wrapped inside ngCordova rather than the plugin itself.\n\nWorth looking into though :-)\n. Agreed!  Puts less need for intervention on the plugin itself as changes will be automatically piped in.\n. I personally don't use Gulp beyond ng-cordova, so I don't know how to do any regression checks with it.  Because we're using it for building and testing only, I think the best thing we could do in the immediate is switch to 4.x and make all tasks synchronous.  I'm actually surprised we haven't hit other issues in the build process.\n. Lame, so all the forums I've read must be referring to what is coming soon on the Gulp timeline.  I had figured it was already out.\n. @nielskrijger I personally think it is dependent on contributor buy in.  For example, not all plugins included in ngCordova were built for AngularJS.  That is why people have created wrappers for them.  Because of this you cannot just go ahead and include someones Apache Cordova plugin as a submodule because if they introduce breaking changes, you won't have a way to stop it.  So one of two things would need to happen:\n1. All plugins get split into separate ngCordova repositories, ex: ng-cordova-pluginnamehere and then that gets included in ng-cordova via a git submodule.  Then people can contribute fixes to the particular plugin rather than the entire ngCordova repository\n2. Only plugins designed for AngularJS get pulled out and added to ngCordova.  For example my ng-cordova-oauth plugin was designed for AngularJS.  That is why it works as a submodule.\n\nI'm very strict in my library.  I deny pull requests all the time in order to keep it working flawlessly.  Other repository owners may not be this strict.\n\nJust my two cents.\n. Traumatic experience with submodules @mhartington?\n\nThe gain would be that ngCordova might get more buy in from developers who don't want to (a) manage and support their libraries in two repositories (b) drop their repository and only contribute to ngCordova.\n\nUnless Ionic gets a fleet of internal developers working on this project, ngCordova will only be as good as the contributions it receives.  The last few months have proven not so good.  For example, isn't SQLite still majorly broken in ngCordova?\n\nJust trying to help fix the shaky past that this library has had.\n. All the haters here with submodules.  Pretty sure it broke because one of the pull requests made some changes that shouldn't have been made.\n\nI will look into it, but in the end one of two things could happen:\n1. I fix the submodule in ngCordova\n2. I drop support for ngCordova and people use strictly ngCordovaOauth\n\nI tried playing the maintain two repositories game and it didn't work.  I would like ngCordovaOauth to remain its own entity.\n\nI'll keep you posted.\n\ncc @gortok @mhartington \n. So it appears gulp-git is asynchronous so it was building the library before the submodule finished downloading.  It worked the first time for me since the submodule had already downloaded before I pushed.\n\nI am working on a fix.\n\nI apologize for wrongfully accusing a bad merge.\n. No bueno.  The submodule doesn't finish downloading before the build:\n\n```\nmacbookpro:ng-cordova nraboy$ gulp\n[19:23:14] Using gulpfile ~/Desktop/ng-cordova/gulpfile.js\n[19:23:14] Starting 'prepare'...\n[19:23:14] Finished 'prepare' after 5.08 ms\n[19:23:14] Starting 'build'...\n[19:23:16] Finished 'build' after 1.73 s\n[19:23:16] Starting 'default'...\n[19:23:16] Finished 'default' after 9 \u03bcs\n[19:23:16] Submodule 'src/plugins/oauth' (https://github.com/nraboy/ng-cordova-oauth) registered for path 'src/plugins/oauth'\nSubmodule path 'src/plugins/oauth': checked out '8cf594947cd8aa52ae64be2ff9f234b85f127293'\n Cloning into 'src/plugins/oauth'...\n```\n. Should be fixed now:\n\nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/909\n. I think #873 is similar, but not the same.  In that other ticket I believe you guys are referring to plugin compatibility between versions of Apache Cordova.  In my ticket I am referring to plugin compatibility between versions of ngCordova.\n\nIf Apache introduces changes tomorrow for the Camera plugin, will the ngCordova wrapping code continue to function.  Maybe, and maybe not.  By pairing a specific version of every plugin to the latest version of ngCordova I think we can get around that.  Not everyone uses tags so I think commit hashes would work better.\n\nOpinions?\n. Is it being removed from the custom builder or ng-cordova entirely?\n. Fair enough.  Thanks for clarification :-)\n. @newelement in case you didn't want to wait around for it to appear in ng-cordova, I've set up a repository for it:\n\nhttps://github.com/nraboy/ng-cordova-beacon\n\nBest,\n.

For example my ng-cordova-oauth plugin was designed for AngularJS.  That is why it works as a submodule.\n\nI'm very strict in my library.  I deny pull requests all the time in order to keep it working flawlessly.  Other repository owners may not be this strict.\n\nJust my two cents.\n. Traumatic experience with submodules @mhartington?\n\nThe gain would be that ngCordova might get more buy in from developers who don't want to (a) manage and support their libraries in two repositories (b) drop their repository and only contribute to ngCordova.\n\nUnless Ionic gets a fleet of internal developers working on this project, ngCordova will only be as good as the contributions it receives.  The last few months have proven not so good.  For example, isn't SQLite still majorly broken in ngCordova?\n\nJust trying to help fix the shaky past that this library has had.\n. All the haters here with submodules.  Pretty sure it broke because one of the pull requests made some changes that shouldn't have been made.\n\nI will look into it, but in the end one of two things could happen:\n1. I fix the submodule in ngCordova\n2. I drop support for ngCordova and people use strictly ngCordovaOauth\n\nI tried playing the maintain two repositories game and it didn't work.  I would like ngCordovaOauth to remain its own entity.\n\nI'll keep you posted.\n\ncc @gortok @mhartington \n. So it appears gulp-git is asynchronous so it was building the library before the submodule finished downloading.  It worked the first time for me since the submodule had already downloaded before I pushed.\n\nI am working on a fix.\n\nI apologize for wrongfully accusing a bad merge.\n. No bueno.  The submodule doesn't finish downloading before the build:\n\n```\nmacbookpro:ng-cordova nraboy$ gulp\n[19:23:14] Using gulpfile ~/Desktop/ng-cordova/gulpfile.js\n[19:23:14] Starting 'prepare'...\n[19:23:14] Finished 'prepare' after 5.08 ms\n[19:23:14] Starting 'build'...\n[19:23:16] Finished 'build' after 1.73 s\n[19:23:16] Starting 'default'...\n[19:23:16] Finished 'default' after 9 \u03bcs\n[19:23:16] Submodule 'src/plugins/oauth' (https://github.com/nraboy/ng-cordova-oauth) registered for path 'src/plugins/oauth'\nSubmodule path 'src/plugins/oauth': checked out '8cf594947cd8aa52ae64be2ff9f234b85f127293'\n Cloning into 'src/plugins/oauth'...\n```\n. Should be fixed now:\n\nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/909\n. I think #873 is similar, but not the same.  In that other ticket I believe you guys are referring to plugin compatibility between versions of Apache Cordova.  In my ticket I am referring to plugin compatibility between versions of ngCordova.\n\nIf Apache introduces changes tomorrow for the Camera plugin, will the ngCordova wrapping code continue to function.  Maybe, and maybe not.  By pairing a specific version of every plugin to the latest version of ngCordova I think we can get around that.  Not everyone uses tags so I think commit hashes would work better.\n\nOpinions?\n. Is it being removed from the custom builder or ng-cordova entirely?\n. Fair enough.  Thanks for clarification :-)\n. @newelement in case you didn't want to wait around for it to appear in ng-cordova, I've set up a repository for it:\n\nhttps://github.com/nraboy/ng-cordova-beacon\n\nBest,\n.

I think `browserInit` need to be inside platform ready.\n. I fixed it by changing the function `browserInit` from this:\n\n``` js\nthis.browserInit = function (id, version) {\n      this.appID = id;\n      this.appVersion = version || \"v2.0\";\n\n      facebookConnectPlugin.browserInit(this.appID, this.appVersion);\n    };\n```\n\nTo this:\n\n``` js\n    this.browserInit = function (id, version) {\n      var appID = id;\n      var appVersion = version || \"v2.0\";\n\n      ionic.Platform.ready(function () {\n        facebookConnectPlugin.browserInit(appID, appVersion);\n      });\n    };\n```\n. @mica16 what errors you are getting with ngCordova? Because [ngCordova already use the Web API](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/geolocation.js#L12) [ref](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation/Using_geolocation)\n\nI'll make some tests with geolocation.\n. I solved this adding `facebookConnectPlugin` to bower\n\n``` json\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"ionic\": \"v1.0.0-beta.13\",\n    \"ngCordova\": \"v0.1.7-alpha\",\n    \"facebook-connect-plugin\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wizcorp/phonegap-facebook-plugin/master/www/js/facebookConnectPlugin.js\"\n  },\n```\n\nAnd in my `index.html`\n\n``` html\n<script src='bower_components/facebook-connect-plugin/index.js'></script>\n```\n\nOnly adding `facebookConnectPlugin.js` is enough because the plugin [already add the Facebook SDK](https://github.com/Wizcorp/phonegap-facebook-plugin/blob/master/www/js/facebookConnectPlugin.js#L172-L180)\n\nAnother thing not documented that I needed to do is to add `http://static.ak.facebook.com/connect/xd_arbiter/` in the `Valid OAuth redirect URIs` field at my Facebook App\n. I forgot this `fb-root`, \n\n@pbernasconi do you know if on iOS, the plugin will use the native app to log in? Because I made it work on Android, and worked fine. \n\nBut on iOS, the plugin open a modal to enter with facebook credentials, I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong..\n. > The modal will open asking the user to allow FB to be used in your app (you can't get around this).\n\nMy problem is that even logged in my facebook app, the modal is just like the Facebook SDK in the browser, I need to enter my facebook email and password :/ [Here is a printscreen](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/736728/5111753/ba7e2560-7009-11e4-8494-84f108bc311b.png) (it is in portuguese, but I think you can understand).. \n\nI'm already logged on facebook app in the same device, but, I need to make login again.\n\nI followed your docs three times, I dicovered about a `Single Sign On` conf that should be enabled Facebook Developer portal... but it doesn't work with the native facebook app :/ \n\nCan you share some hint about this? ( I hope you understand, my English is horrible =s )\n. On Android it worked, I don't need to enter my email and password, I just need to tab on \"ok\" to authorise my app. \n. @adaptivedev They changed the location of the file, take a look at [this repository](https://github.com/Wizcorp/phonegap-facebook-plugin), https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wizcorp/phonegap-facebook-plugin/master/facebookConnectPlugin.js\n.

The original problem was that a file system was requested with storage type \"1\", while for Library/NoCloud that should've been \"4\". Now the requestFileSystem method isn't used any longer which resolves this issue.\n\nUnfortunately these changes haven't been released for usage with Bower, but you can use it in your app already. Just include ngCordova like this in Bower:\n\n{\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"ngCordova\": \"driftyco/ng-cordova#b5e612d109a90afa7edcbaf63406a41b9912eba6\"\n  }\n}\n\nAlso make sure that the extra file systems get included by adding the following to config.xml:\n\n  <preference name=\"iosExtraFilesystems\" value=\"library,library-nosync,documents,documents-nosync,cache,bundle,root\"/>\n\nThen use the methods of $cordovaFile as described in the docs, for instance:\n\n$cordovaFile.checkFile(window.cordova.file.dataDirectory, 'file.ext').then(function() {\n  ...\n});\n\nI've only tested this with the latest version of the cordoba-file-plugin, so just to be sure you could remove and add it:\n\ncordova plugin remove org.apache.cordova.file\ncordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.file\n\n\u2014Reply to this email directly or .\n. radu\n\nhttp://scaer.ru/bankter\n\n24.03.2015, 12:03, \"radu\" notifications@github.com:thanks for getting back to me.

I monkey patched or rather, modified ng-cordova.js using some of the info above.\n\nWorks for me, I still need to upgrade Ionic and hope these issues were resolved.\n\nInside getFilesystem():\n\n  var initFs = function(fn, errFn) {\n    var size = 0;\n    //var size = 1024 \\* 1024;\n    var x = $window.PERSISTENT;\n    if(device.platform == 'Android') {\n      //x = 2;\n      $window.requestFileSystem(x, size, fn, errFn); // android\n    } else if(device.platform == 'iOS') {\n      x = 3; // works.\n      /*\n       \\* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26151731/cordova-phonegap-ios-filesystem-custom-root-path-iosextrafilesystems-is-not\n       \\* https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-file/pull/82\n       \\* https://github.com/wei-lee/dotfiles/issues/1\n       */\n      $window.requestFileSystem(x, size, fn, errFn); // ios\n    } else {\n      $window.requestFileSystem($window.PERSISTENT, size, fn, errFn); // dev doesnt work\n    }\n  }\n        initFs(q.resolve, q.reject);\n.

Thank you!\n\n@hasandogu could you try same things described above (the two code snippets with same config)? Thank you!\n. @hasandogu\n\nThanks for the response!\n\n@jamesdef\n\nIf direct call `$window.cordova.plugins.notification.local` to the plugin does not work too, this means that probably you have incorrect setup for the app and there are no problems with `$cordovaLocalNotification` implementation (as confirmed by @hasandogu as well).\n\nAs you can see from my previous message:\n- I have included `\"ngCordova\": \"0.1.17-alpha\"` in `bower.json` and your `bower.json` missing this dependency (maybe you are including it manually using `<link>` anyway)\n\nUnfortunately, I'm not sure where is the problem with your app, apparently it is not in `$cordovaLocalNotification` implementation.\n\nIMHO you should isolate the problem by creating blank project and install only the required plugins, snippet from my `package.json` (try to install only this plugins):\n\n```\n\"cordovaPlugins\": [\n    \"org.apache.cordova.device@0.3.0\",\n    \"org.apache.cordova.splashscreen@1.0.0\",\n    \"org.apache.cordova.statusbar@0.1.10\",\n    \"com.ionic.keyboard@1.0.4\",\n    \"org.apache.cordova.dialogs@0.3.0\",\n    \"de.appplant.cordova.plugin.local-notification@0.8.1\"\n]\n```\n\nThis way you will see is it local notifications plugin problem or not.\n. This issue might be related: https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/issues/860\n. @jamesdef \n\nThank you for the information!\n\nI can see that you have opened issue on the official native's plugin repo: https://github.com/katzer/cordova-plugin-local-notifications/issues/615\n\nI have tested on one more device: `LG Spirit 4G / Android 5.0.1` - works fine with native and ngCordova plugin.\n\nSo, total devices I've tested on which works fine:\n- iPhone 4S (iOS 8.3)\n- HTC One (Android 5.0.2)\n- LG Spirit 4G (Android 5.0.1)\n. @gortok \nDone in https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/911\n\nI will add documentation in another PR.\n\nThanks\n. Hi @morcegon ,\n\nDo you wrap cordova calls like this:\n\n```\n$ionicPlatform.ready(function() {\n      if ($window.cordova &&\n          $window.cordova.plugins &&\n          $window.cordova.plugins.barcodeScanner) {\n        console.log('Plugin available');\n      }\n});\n```\n. `$cordovaLocalNotification` also uses `$window.cordova.plugins` namespace for example `$window.cordova.plugins.notification.local.schedule`, but it is working for me and other plugins are wokring, too.\nUnfortunately,  I can't reproduce the problem..\n. @morcegon @dangnelson please try this two simple snippets:\n\n1). Confirm `window.cordova` is available:\n\n```\ndocument.addEventListener(\"deviceready\", function () {\n  if (window.cordova) {\n    console.log('window.cordova is available');\n  } else {\n    console.log('window.cordova NOT available');\n  }\n}, false);\n```\n\n2). Confirm `window.cordova.plugins` is available:\n\n```\ndocument.addEventListener(\"deviceready\", function () {\n  if (window.cordova && window.cordova.plugins) {\n    console.log('window.cordova.plugins is available');\n  } else {\n    console.log('window.cordova.plugins NOT available');\n  }\n}, false);\n```\n. @morcegon thanks! Very strange .. this confirms that any plugin in `window.cordova.plugins` namespace will not work.. No clue how to fix it, though :(\n\nJust a guess:\nIn your `app.js` you need to add `$window` in `.run(function($ionicPlatform) {`, because it is used without injecting it like this `.run(function($ionicPlatform, $window) {`\nTry calling plugin directly (this probably won't work because `cordova.plugins` is undefined):\n\n```\ndocument.addEventListener(\"deviceready\", function () {\n  cordova.plugins.barcodeScanner.scan(function(result) {\n    // ...\n  }, function (err) {\n    // ...\n  });\n}, false);\n```\n\nI can see you already created issue on plugin's repo https://github.com/wildabeast/BarcodeScanner/issues/292 which is the right place if it is related to cordova, not ngCordova wrapper\n. There is a pull request \"[Add $cordovaBeacon plugin](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/857)\" for that already\n. Sure, will do in few days and link with the new PR, thanks.\n. @beauby @gortok\nThanks for the comments.\n1. The cleanup code was merged by another commit and also if there is a new code coming from `ng-cordova-oauth` submodule it will be added automatically as well. It's better to have separate commits, I will try to separate the new plugin code and generated one.\n   By the way you can notice this in other PRs as well, that's why I've decided it's common practice.\n2. About `.gitignore` : I'm using Jetbrain's IDE and noticed that some of it's files are already included, like \".idea/_\", that's why I have added another one \"_.iml\" (it was generated and should be ignored as well). I think it's better to have common patterns in project's `.gitignore`, because some developers might not have setted up `core.excludesfile` (like me). I can create different commit for this one or maybe another PR for some of https://github.com/github/gitignore\n   Let me know which one is better.\n. 1. @beauby  the comments you did are _not_ offensive in anyway :) ( maybe I did not express myself properly ).\n   Moreover, it's the opposite: I appreciate your feedback and any comments / fix / improvements are welcome!\n   I just wanted to clarify my intentions and ask what is preferable for the project style / common practice - because I saw PRs doing the opposite thing and some projects have rules about \"less commits per PR\".\n   As I mentioned, I also think and agree that separate commits per feature/change are best practice and I will do the original changes commit and another commit for auto-generating code - much better. Or you mean to drop the generated code at all from the PR? If latest is true, then I'm not sure how it can be tested with \"demo\" project without creating a new build, that's why it is included in PR.\n   What is the process here: should I create separate commits with generated code or remove generated code at all from PR? @gortok could you please clarify what's the process for this?\n2. @beauby I can see much clearer now the point of removing env specific files and leave only project ones in `.gitignore` - thank you for clarifying this. I will do separate PR for this, please let me know if I done something wrong.\n\nThanks for the feedback once again @beauby @gortok \n. @gortok @beauby \n\nI've submitted the changes as discussed\n1. Added documentation in https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/924\n2. Separated the plugin and build changes in two commits\n3. Created a new PR for `.gitignore`: https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/925\n\nPlease let me know if everything is fine.\n\nThank you!\n. @root-io \nThank you for noticing, it's my mistake. I do apologize!\nIt was copy&paste mistake from my previous tests, the value to the native plugin should be `undefined` instead of `null`.\nI have submitted & rebased the PR, it now works with `null` values as in example.\nPlease let me know if you have any problems.\n\nThanks!\n. Sure, will do.\n. @gortok \n\nI'll be happy to improve it, but I'm not sure how ..\nThe plugin does not require `$rootScope` in particular, but I used it to globally broadcast events - `$rootScope.$broadcast`, I am not sure how to do it without `$rootScope` globally ...\nAlso, not every event is broadcasted - it depends how are you using the plugin (only for monitoring `startMonitoringForRegion` + ranging `startRangingBeaconsInRegion` - `$cordovaBeacon:didStartMonitoringForRegion`, `$cordovaBeacon:didDetermineStateForRegion`, `$cordovaBeacon:didRangeBeaconsInRegion` are fired)\nCould you please give me an example, so I can refactor it?\n\nI have checked other plugins and used them as an example for my implementation (they all use `$rootScope`):\n- https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/batteryStatus.js\n- https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/inappbrowser.js\n- https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/keyboard.js\n- https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/localNotification.js\n- https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/network.js\n- https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/push.js\n\nPlease let me know how to do the global broadcasting without `$rootScope` and I will refactor all other plugins as well (if that's ok).\n\nThank you for your suggestions in advance!\n. @gortok \n\nYes, I suppose there will be:\n- Angular 1.x - Ionic Framework 1.x - ngCordova 1.x (current implementation)\n- Angular 2.x - Ionic Framework 2.x - ngCordova 2 - plain ES6/TypeScript (future implementation)\n  and they both will have to be maintained as long as Ionic Framework 1.x / ngCordova 1.x are supported.\n\nIt will be good to migrate all the plugins, once https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/tree/v2/src is ready.\n\nThanks for the merge!\n\nJust to confirm: I can see that it is live now and we have broken link / 404 error (https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/beacon.js) on page http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/beacon/ , because https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/937 is not merged yet.\n. Hi @gortok ,\n\nAccording to [Create a global .gitignore](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/#create-a-global-gitignore) you should:\n\n1). create `~/.gitignore_global` with following contents:\n\n```\n.DS_Store\n```\n\n2). execute command:\n\n```\ngit config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global\n```\n\nI removed `.DS_Store`, because it is not project specific file as described & suggested in https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/911#issuecomment-127976614\n\nThanks\n. @newelement the plugin is available now:\n\nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/beacon.js\n. @newelement @nraboy \n\nFor your information, it was available for `Copy & Paste` since `25 Jun 2015`:\nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/857\n\nIf everything is ok, you can close the issue, thanks.\n. @root-io \n\n`brIdentifier` in your `for` loop must be unique:\n\n```\nvar brIdentifier = 'whatever' + i;\n```\n\nLet me know if this resolved your issue.\n. I have created pull request. I will update the docs with another pull request.\n. @increos \nNo, my pull request is not merged yet.\n\nHowever, there is partial update, which is merged.\nDescribed here: https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/issues/721\n. @GIANTCRAB the pull request is merged. You can close the issue now.\nThank you!\n. Hi @pbernasconi ,\n\nI can see that you are responsible for merging pull requests.\n\nCould you please answer, when you have a chance:\nIs there particular reason why https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/718 and https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/791 were merged and my pull requests https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/688 and https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/707  were not?\n\nI'm just wondering what is the problem with this one, because https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/688 solves all of them and maybe I can change something or if you decided not to approve the pull request, please let me know, so I can stop supporting it by fixing merging conflicts and possibly close it.\n\nYour feedback is highly appreciated!\n\nThank you\n. The pull requests are now merged. I'm closing this issue.\n\nAlso, https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/issues/677 https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/issues/754 should be closed as well\n.

This issue might be related: https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/issues/860\n. @jamesdef \n\nThank you for the information!\n\nI can see that you have opened issue on the official native's plugin repo: https://github.com/katzer/cordova-plugin-local-notifications/issues/615\n\nI have tested on one more device: `LG Spirit 4G / Android 5.0.1` - works fine with native and ngCordova plugin.\n\nSo, total devices I've tested on which works fine:\n- iPhone 4S (iOS 8.3)\n- HTC One (Android 5.0.2)\n- LG Spirit 4G (Android 5.0.1)\n. @gortok \nDone in https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/911\n\nI will add documentation in another PR.\n\nThanks\n. Hi @morcegon ,\n\nDo you wrap cordova calls like this:\n\n```\n$ionicPlatform.ready(function() {\n      if ($window.cordova &&\n          $window.cordova.plugins &&\n          $window.cordova.plugins.barcodeScanner) {\n        console.log('Plugin available');\n      }\n});\n```\n. `$cordovaLocalNotification` also uses `$window.cordova.plugins` namespace for example `$window.cordova.plugins.notification.local.schedule`, but it is working for me and other plugins are wokring, too.\nUnfortunately,  I can't reproduce the problem..\n. @morcegon @dangnelson please try this two simple snippets:\n\n1). Confirm `window.cordova` is available:\n\n```\ndocument.addEventListener(\"deviceready\", function () {\n  if (window.cordova) {\n    console.log('window.cordova is available');\n  } else {\n    console.log('window.cordova NOT available');\n  }\n}, false);\n```\n\n2). Confirm `window.cordova.plugins` is available:\n\n```\ndocument.addEventListener(\"deviceready\", function () {\n  if (window.cordova && window.cordova.plugins) {\n    console.log('window.cordova.plugins is available');\n  } else {\n    console.log('window.cordova.plugins NOT available');\n  }\n}, false);\n```\n. @morcegon thanks! Very strange .. this confirms that any plugin in `window.cordova.plugins` namespace will not work.. No clue how to fix it, though :(\n\nJust a guess:\nIn your `app.js` you need to add `$window` in `.run(function($ionicPlatform) {`, because it is used without injecting it like this `.run(function($ionicPlatform, $window) {`\nTry calling plugin directly (this probably won't work because `cordova.plugins` is undefined):\n\n```\ndocument.addEventListener(\"deviceready\", function () {\n  cordova.plugins.barcodeScanner.scan(function(result) {\n    // ...\n  }, function (err) {\n    // ...\n  });\n}, false);\n```\n\nI can see you already created issue on plugin's repo https://github.com/wildabeast/BarcodeScanner/issues/292 which is the right place if it is related to cordova, not ngCordova wrapper\n. There is a pull request \"[Add $cordovaBeacon plugin](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/857)\" for that already\n. Sure, will do in few days and link with the new PR, thanks.\n. @beauby @gortok\nThanks for the comments.\n1. The cleanup code was merged by another commit and also if there is a new code coming from `ng-cordova-oauth` submodule it will be added automatically as well. It's better to have separate commits, I will try to separate the new plugin code and generated one.\n   By the way you can notice this in other PRs as well, that's why I've decided it's common practice.\n2. About `.gitignore` : I'm using Jetbrain's IDE and noticed that some of it's files are already included, like \".idea/_\", that's why I have added another one \"_.iml\" (it was generated and should be ignored as well). I think it's better to have common patterns in project's `.gitignore`, because some developers might not have setted up `core.excludesfile` (like me). I can create different commit for this one or maybe another PR for some of https://github.com/github/gitignore\n   Let me know which one is better.\n. 1. @beauby  the comments you did are _not_ offensive in anyway :) ( maybe I did not express myself properly ).\n   Moreover, it's the opposite: I appreciate your feedback and any comments / fix / improvements are welcome!\n   I just wanted to clarify my intentions and ask what is preferable for the project style / common practice - because I saw PRs doing the opposite thing and some projects have rules about \"less commits per PR\".\n   As I mentioned, I also think and agree that separate commits per feature/change are best practice and I will do the original changes commit and another commit for auto-generating code - much better. Or you mean to drop the generated code at all from the PR? If latest is true, then I'm not sure how it can be tested with \"demo\" project without creating a new build, that's why it is included in PR.\n   What is the process here: should I create separate commits with generated code or remove generated code at all from PR? @gortok could you please clarify what's the process for this?\n2. @beauby I can see much clearer now the point of removing env specific files and leave only project ones in `.gitignore` - thank you for clarifying this. I will do separate PR for this, please let me know if I done something wrong.\n\nThanks for the feedback once again @beauby @gortok \n. @gortok @beauby \n\nI've submitted the changes as discussed\n1. Added documentation in https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/924\n2. Separated the plugin and build changes in two commits\n3. Created a new PR for `.gitignore`: https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/925\n\nPlease let me know if everything is fine.\n\nThank you!\n. @root-io \nThank you for noticing, it's my mistake. I do apologize!\nIt was copy&paste mistake from my previous tests, the value to the native plugin should be `undefined` instead of `null`.\nI have submitted & rebased the PR, it now works with `null` values as in example.\nPlease let me know if you have any problems.\n\nThanks!\n. Sure, will do.\n. @gortok \n\nI'll be happy to improve it, but I'm not sure how ..\nThe plugin does not require `$rootScope` in particular, but I used it to globally broadcast events - `$rootScope.$broadcast`, I am not sure how to do it without `$rootScope` globally ...\nAlso, not every event is broadcasted - it depends how are you using the plugin (only for monitoring `startMonitoringForRegion` + ranging `startRangingBeaconsInRegion` - `$cordovaBeacon:didStartMonitoringForRegion`, `$cordovaBeacon:didDetermineStateForRegion`, `$cordovaBeacon:didRangeBeaconsInRegion` are fired)\nCould you please give me an example, so I can refactor it?\n\nI have checked other plugins and used them as an example for my implementation (they all use `$rootScope`):\n- https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/batteryStatus.js\n- https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/inappbrowser.js\n- https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/keyboard.js\n- https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/localNotification.js\n- https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/network.js\n- https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/push.js\n\nPlease let me know how to do the global broadcasting without `$rootScope` and I will refactor all other plugins as well (if that's ok).\n\nThank you for your suggestions in advance!\n. @gortok \n\nYes, I suppose there will be:\n- Angular 1.x - Ionic Framework 1.x - ngCordova 1.x (current implementation)\n- Angular 2.x - Ionic Framework 2.x - ngCordova 2 - plain ES6/TypeScript (future implementation)\n  and they both will have to be maintained as long as Ionic Framework 1.x / ngCordova 1.x are supported.\n\nIt will be good to migrate all the plugins, once https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/tree/v2/src is ready.\n\nThanks for the merge!\n\nJust to confirm: I can see that it is live now and we have broken link / 404 error (https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/beacon.js) on page http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/beacon/ , because https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/937 is not merged yet.\n. Hi @gortok ,\n\nAccording to [Create a global .gitignore](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/#create-a-global-gitignore) you should:\n\n1). create `~/.gitignore_global` with following contents:\n\n```\n.DS_Store\n```\n\n2). execute command:\n\n```\ngit config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global\n```\n\nI removed `.DS_Store`, because it is not project specific file as described & suggested in https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/911#issuecomment-127976614\n\nThanks\n. @newelement the plugin is available now:\n\nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/beacon.js\n. @newelement @nraboy \n\nFor your information, it was available for `Copy & Paste` since `25 Jun 2015`:\nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/pull/857\n\nIf everything is ok, you can close the issue, thanks.\n. @root-io \n\n`brIdentifier` in your `for` loop must be unique:\n\n```\nvar brIdentifier = 'whatever' + i;\n```\n\nLet me know if this resolved your issue.\n.

    "aka-Ani": "I'm not too knowledgeable on how to contribute to the ngCordova project with your custom implementation of a plugin, but making an angular wrapper for a plugin is not too difficult. Basically, take a look at the ng-cordova plugins folder:\nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/tree/master/src/plugins\n\nYou can see there is a js file for each wrapper. Let us take the ble.js file for example:\nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/ble.js\n\nYou can see all you need to do is define a module and factory which implements each of the functions that the plugin provides:\n\n``` javascript\nangular.module('ngCordova.plugins.ble', [])\n\n  .factory('$cordovaBLE', ['$q', function ($q) {\n```\n\nYou would have to make your own names and stuff.\nHere is the github page for the plugin:\nhttps://github.com/don/cordova-plugin-ble-central\n\nSo let's take the scan function. If you were using the plugin directly, the structure is:\n`ble.scan(services, seconds, success, failure);`\n\nAnd in the angular wrapper for this plugin you can see the scan function is implemented as:\n\n``` javascript\nscan: function (services, seconds) {\n        var q = $q.defer();\n        ble.scan(services, seconds, function (result) {\n          q.resolve(result);\n        }, function (error) {\n          q.reject(error);\n        });\n        return q.promise;\n      }\n```\n\nThe principle behind this is called Promises. I'm not an expert on this either, but there are tutorials online that you can read up on. But just by observation, you can see how the success and failure portions become \"resolve\" and \"reject\" and you return the \"promise\". \n\nYou can make these implementations for any/all of the functions you want available from the plugin. And that's kind of the basics of the whole process I think. \n. Well what is the issue you're running into exactly? Did you make sure to add the plugin to the ionic project with \"cordova plugin add ...\"? The angular wrappers/ng-cordova still need you to add the plugin separately.\n. You got it working? That's great! Honestly though, for such a simple plugin that only has one function, I don't really see the need for constructing an angular wrapper for it. It takes only a couple lines to get the data you need. But in any case, in your code for the wrapper, the code inside the `function()` block after the `defer()` call should basically be the same code as you would have if you were calling the plugin directly without the wrapper. So according to the plugin readme, it would look something like this:\n\n``` javascript\nvar deviceInfo = cordova.require(\"cordova/plugin/DeviceInformation\");\ndeviceInfo.get(function(result) {\n        console.log(\"result = \" + result);\n    }, function() {\n        console.log(\"error\");\n    });\n```\n\nBut except of console logs, you would put the `resolve` and `reject` functions.\n.

So I think my setup is correct, but there is a problem somewhere in cordova.\n\n``` bash\n$ cordova --version\n5.4.0\n\n$ cordova plugin list\ncom.ionic.keyboard 1.0.4 \"Keyboard\"\ncordova-plugin-ble-central 1.0.2 \"BLE\"\ncordova-plugin-console 1.0.1 \"Console\"\ncordova-plugin-device 1.0.1 \"Device\"\ncordova-plugin-inappbrowser 1.0.1 \"InAppBrowser\"\ncordova-plugin-splashscreen 2.1.0 \"Splashscreen\"\ncordova-plugin-whitelist 1.2.0 \"Whitelist\"\n```\n. Shouldn't this be closed by #1079 ?\n. Should solve #981\n. This way you would create a promise, which is never resolved. I think it is\nnot the ideal solution.

It's not just the speed of Apacha, but also for each plugin.\n\nWhat if Geo makes a new version, that breaks BC. And Push releases a new version that I can't use yet. If you update both plugins in this repo, I must either use the latest version for both, or the old version for both. You can't selectively choose..\n.

Yeah you would get more repo's to watch, but the amount of issues would probably be the same ;)\nYou could also add more maintainers for just 1 repo, keep the issues organised per plugin and set an example so that other people can just make their own plugins on their own repo if they want.\n. Right now, you just maintain all the plugins right?\n\nSo for the new push plugin (#919), instead of creating a PR, I could just create my own repository, require the core package and use + maintain that. You guys could just link the package and reference it in some build package if you must.\n\nOr if it's popular enough, transfer it to the ng-cordova organisation. (Which you would need to create, so you have `ng-cordova/core`, `ng-cordova/push` etc, instead of `driftyco`\n. It's not just the speed of Apacha, but also for each plugin.\n\nWhat if Geo makes a new version, that breaks BC. And Push releases a new version that I can't use yet. If you update both plugins in this repo, I must either use the latest version for both, or the old version for both. You can't selectively choose..\n. And how should I name it? `$cordovaPush2` sounds a bit weird..\n. ",

I am using manual bootstrap of angular. So... My angular app is only initialised when device ready is called. So the problem is something else, but still it works in the latter snippet I posted.\n\nThank you for the links but this is of no help in this context.\n\n```\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n            document.addEventListener('deviceready', function onDeviceReady() {\n                angular.bootstrap(document, ['MyApp']);\n            }, false);\n        </script>\n\n```\n. Workaround : I call a register function when my app is opened. You can call this in `.run` or in ui-router's resolve function. \n\n```\n.run(function($cordovaPush){\n       var iosConfig = {\n                            \"badge\": true,\n                            \"sound\": true,\n                            \"alert\": true\n      };\n       $cordovaPush.register(iosConfig)\n})\n```\n\nNow the call back is always defined. This bug should be fixed. \n. ",

    "jeffthompson1971": "Why was this closed?  This issue still sucks.  So now on IOS if I want to update an existing contact my only option is to clobber the birthday with a dummy Date().  There is no other way update an existing contact.    What's strange is when I use 'find()' to just get all the contacts and I look at the contact i'm going to update, it HAS a valid date.   but when i next use a filtered find to just get that one contact, the contact shows invalid date.    I don't get it..\n. been several months has anyone looked at this?\n. anyone?\n. Not an bug or issue more like missing functionality.   Let me take a look and see if the plugin itself supports it or not.  If it does then I can work on a pull request.   seems to me like something one would want to know right?  if i do a share and user picks someone, why not return the selected contact?   anyway not a bug just missing functionality.\n. I  opted to have a generic dialog that says \"Done with no drama\"  - basically just use a phrase that doesn't look strange on a cancel.   ;)\n. Did some digging.  Tracked down an issue already flagged in cordova:\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-10133?jql=text%20~%20%22contacts%20save%22\n\nSeems there is an issue in Contacts.js to do with cloning the Contact object and then using postMessage with the result.  It fails when the object has functions and not just attributes.   The  quick and simple fix is to take the Contact object and use JSON.stringify() and then JSON.parse() before cloning it.  This will remove the functions on the object.    \n\nSo it seems that they have fixed it in cordova but I'm not sure what version or why you don't have the fix.    Is there some way you can dig in and make sure the version of the plugin you are using with ngCordova has this fix?    I put my patch in below.   \n\nHow does one go about using a plugin with their own patch on top?  Any idea what I do in my code if i have to have my own patch on a plugin?\n\nThis was what I did in \n\n```\nContact.prototype.save = function(successCB, errorCB) {\n    argscheck.checkArgs('FFO', 'Contact.save', arguments);\n    var fail = errorCB && function(code) {\n        errorCB(new ContactError(code));\n    };\n    var success = function(result) {\n        if (result) {\n            if (successCB) {\n                var fullContact = require('./contacts').create(result);\n                successCB(convertUtils.toCordovaFormat(fullContact));\n            }\n        }\n        else {\n            // no Entry object returned\n            fail(ContactError.UNKNOWN_ERROR);\n        }\n    };\n   // ** Added the next 3 lines to remove functions from Contacts (this) object **\n   + var tmp = JSON.stringify(this);\n   + var noFunc = JSON.parse(tmp);\n   + var dupContact = convertUtils.toNativeFormat(utils.clone(noFunc));**\n   // ** comment out this line which is replaced by the 3 above **\n   - //var dupContact = convertUtils.toNativeFormat(utils.clone(this));\n\n    exec(success, fail, \"Contacts\", \"save\", [dupContact]);\n};\n\n```\n. Hmm... I've never done that before but if I'm going to have to add it for\nmyself I may as well do it in a way that integrates properly into\nngCordova.  I'll give it a go.    Can you tell me if there is any info or\nguidelines on how to extend ngCordova properly?   I really don't want to\nhave a mix of ngCordova APIs with direct plugin APIs.... feels sloppy right?\n\nOn Sat, Jul 23, 2016 at 12:13 PM, George Stocker notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> If the wrapper doesn't support it, I'll happily accept a PR to support it.\n> \n> \u2014\n> You are receiving this because you authored the thread.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/issues/1304#issuecomment-234729285,\n> or mute the thread\n> https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AB7Nvgz08H8QYZ5hdYLmvFX3zvYVR9ngks5qYkuwgaJpZM4JTZK9\n> .\n. I have a question.  I'm not understanding the existing ngCordova contacts wrapper.  It doesn't seem to use the plugin as it was designed.  The 'find' for example.   Your 'find' is not using the approach of creating a proper object like:\n\n// per cordova docs on contact plugin\n\n```\nvar options      = new ContactFindOptions();\noptions.filter   = \"Bob\";\noptions.multiple = true;\noptions.desiredFields = [navigator.contacts.fieldType.id];\noptions.hasPhoneNumber = true;\nvar fields       = [navigator.contacts.fieldType.displayName, navigator.contacts.fieldType.name];\nnavigator.contacts.find(fields, onSuccess, onError, options);\n```\n\nYour ngCordova code is just uses POJS object\n\n```\nfind: function (options) {\n        var q = $q.defer();\n        var fields = options.fields || ['id', 'displayName'];\n        delete options.fields;\n        if (Object.keys(options).length === 0) {\n          navigator.contacts.find(fields, function (results) {\n            q.resolve(results);\n          },function (err) {\n            q.reject(err);\n          });\n        }\n\n```\n\nI'm just trying to get my head around the current implementation so I can make a pull request for the update bit.   Can you explain why the divergence from cordova API.  Can I have my API use the proper documented code?\n. Ok... I have another question for you that is actually maybe more of a global approach question for dealing with plugins in general.    \n\nHow would you propose to handle a flow with a plugin that needs user confirmation?  Specific to Contacts, let say I want to add an API that is like an 'upsert' -meaning if the the contact does not exist it creates a new one, if it DOES exist we update it with the new data.   Because it seems the plugin is quite limited in how it searches, meaning you can only search for ONE string like 'Bob' - I don't see any support for filtering on givenName='Bob' && familyName=\"Jones\".    So given that, when I go to 'upsert' and I find that there are 3 contacts with givenName=Bob,  now I would want to show a dialog to the user asking them which one they want to update.   But in the context of the Contacts plugin I have no clue if the app has support for navigator.notification.confirm (or whatever it is) so what would a plugin developer do in such a case?  Is it just something that can't be done?  meaning the best you could do with your API is let the app call a 'find' first, then if it returns more than one then the app  handles the confirmation dialog in whatever way it wants to and then it uses the 'save' API (if new) and maybe a clone of the contact, 'remove' the original one and 'save' the cloned one (as a way to do an update).    Is that the only viable option or is there any wrapper around 'confirm dialog' that is smart enough to detect what the platform has and uses it?  \n\nDunno..sorry for the spam I'm just curious  \n.

So now on IOS if I want to update an existing contact my only option is to clobber the birthday with a dummy Date().  There is no other way update an existing contact.    What's strange is when I use 'find()' to just get all the contacts and I look at the contact i'm going to update, it HAS a valid date.   but when i next use a filtered find to just get that one contact, the contact shows invalid date.    I don't get it..\n. been several months has anyone looked at this?\n. anyone?\n. Not an bug or issue more like missing functionality.   Let me take a look and see if the plugin itself supports it or not.  If it does then I can work on a pull request.   seems to me like something one would want to know right?  if i do a share and user picks someone, why not return the selected contact?   anyway not a bug just missing functionality.\n. I  opted to have a generic dialog that says \"Done with no drama\"  - basically just use a phrase that doesn't look strange on a cancel.   ;)\n. Did some digging.  Tracked down an issue already flagged in cordova:\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-10133?jql=text%20~%20%22contacts%20save%22\n\nSeems there is an issue in Contacts.js to do with cloning the Contact object and then using postMessage with the result.  It fails when the object has functions and not just attributes.   The  quick and simple fix is to take the Contact object and use JSON.stringify() and then JSON.parse() before cloning it.  This will remove the functions on the object.    \n\nSo it seems that they have fixed it in cordova but I'm not sure what version or why you don't have the fix.    Is there some way you can dig in and make sure the version of the plugin you are using with ngCordova has this fix?    I put my patch in below.   \n\nHow does one go about using a plugin with their own patch on top?  Any idea what I do in my code if i have to have my own patch on a plugin?\n\nThis was what I did in \n\n```\nContact.prototype.save = function(successCB, errorCB) {\n    argscheck.checkArgs('FFO', 'Contact.save', arguments);\n    var fail = errorCB && function(code) {\n        errorCB(new ContactError(code));\n    };\n    var success = function(result) {\n        if (result) {\n            if (successCB) {\n                var fullContact = require('./contacts').create(result);\n                successCB(convertUtils.toCordovaFormat(fullContact));\n            }\n        }\n        else {\n            // no Entry object returned\n            fail(ContactError.UNKNOWN_ERROR);\n        }\n    };\n   // ** Added the next 3 lines to remove functions from Contacts (this) object **\n   + var tmp = JSON.stringify(this);\n   + var noFunc = JSON.parse(tmp);\n   + var dupContact = convertUtils.toNativeFormat(utils.clone(noFunc));**\n   // ** comment out this line which is replaced by the 3 above **\n   - //var dupContact = convertUtils.toNativeFormat(utils.clone(this));\n\n    exec(success, fail, \"Contacts\", \"save\", [dupContact]);\n};\n\n```\n. Hmm... I've never done that before but if I'm going to have to add it for\nmyself I may as well do it in a way that integrates properly into\nngCordova.  I'll give it a go.    Can you tell me if there is any info or\nguidelines on how to extend ngCordova properly?   I really don't want to\nhave a mix of ngCordova APIs with direct plugin APIs.... feels sloppy right?\n\nOn Sat, Jul 23, 2016 at 12:13 PM, George Stocker notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> If the wrapper doesn't support it, I'll happily accept a PR to support it.\n> \n> \u2014\n> You are receiving this because you authored the thread.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/issues/1304#issuecomment-234729285,\n> or mute the thread\n> https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AB7Nvgz08H8QYZ5hdYLmvFX3zvYVR9ngks5qYkuwgaJpZM4JTZK9\n> .\n. I have a question.  I'm not understanding the existing ngCordova contacts wrapper.  It doesn't seem to use the plugin as it was designed.  The 'find' for example.   Your 'find' is not using the approach of creating a proper object like:\n\n// per cordova docs on contact plugin\n\n```\nvar options      = new ContactFindOptions();\noptions.filter   = \"Bob\";\noptions.multiple = true;\noptions.desiredFields = [navigator.contacts.fieldType.id];\noptions.hasPhoneNumber = true;\nvar fields       = [navigator.contacts.fieldType.displayName, navigator.contacts.fieldType.name];\nnavigator.contacts.find(fields, onSuccess, onError, options);\n```\n\nYour ngCordova code is just uses POJS object\n\n```\nfind: function (options) {\n        var q = $q.defer();\n        var fields = options.fields || ['id', 'displayName'];\n        delete options.fields;\n        if (Object.keys(options).length === 0) {\n          navigator.contacts.find(fields, function (results) {\n            q.resolve(results);\n          },function (err) {\n            q.reject(err);\n          });\n        }\n\n```\n\nI'm just trying to get my head around the current implementation so I can make a pull request for the update bit.   Can you explain why the divergence from cordova API.  Can I have my API use the proper documented code?\n. Ok... I have another question for you that is actually maybe more of a global approach question for dealing with plugins in general.    \n\nHow would you propose to handle a flow with a plugin that needs user confirmation?  Specific to Contacts, let say I want to add an API that is like an 'upsert' -meaning if the the contact does not exist it creates a new one, if it DOES exist we update it with the new data.   Because it seems the plugin is quite limited in how it searches, meaning you can only search for ONE string like 'Bob' - I don't see any support for filtering on givenName='Bob' && familyName=\"Jones\".    So given that, when I go to 'upsert' and I find that there are 3 contacts with givenName=Bob,  now I would want to show a dialog to the user asking them which one they want to update.   But in the context of the Contacts plugin I have no clue if the app has support for navigator.notification.confirm (or whatever it is) so what would a plugin developer do in such a case?  Is it just something that can't be done?  meaning the best you could do with your API is let the app call a 'find' first, then if it returns more than one then the app  handles the confirmation dialog in whatever way it wants to and then it uses the 'save' API (if new) and maybe a clone of the contact, 'remove' the original one and 'save' the cloned one (as a way to do an update).    Is that the only viable option or is there any wrapper around 'confirm dialog' that is smart enough to detect what the platform has and uses it?  \n\nDunno..sorry for the spam I'm just curious  \n.

Also, I have updated stackoverflow code.\n\nMy understanding is:\n\nMy grunt tasks (cdnify) takes into account all bower components and cdnifies (refers google cdn) for all those plugins and dependencies. How can I include ngCordova in it? It ignores it. Or I need to write a nice task that copies ngCordova to www or dist asset folder of cordova app from Anguloar folders.\n\nThanks,\nSmitha\n\nFrom: George Stocker [mailto:notifications@github.com]\nSent: Monday, May 16, 2016 5:02 PM\nTo: driftyco/ng-cordova\nCc: Alangar, Smitha; Mention\nSubject: Re: [driftyco/ng-cordova] No support for grunt cdnify.. at least please add it or suggest a workaround.
