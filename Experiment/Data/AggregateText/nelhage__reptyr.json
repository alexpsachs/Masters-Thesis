    "nelhage": "Thanks, merged.\n. > If I run rtorrent as-is, then reptyr can move it however my old terminall still display rtorrent until i kill it (rtorrent that is).\n\nThat is expected and a known limitation. You can either close the old terminal (reptyr should protect rtorrent against being killed when you do so), or you can background rtorrent using `^Z` in the new window, and then run `bg; disown` in the old terminal to detach it entirely.\n\nI've just pushed a fix that should fix attaching processes run via screen. Can you let me know if it works for you?\n. My apologies; I did a refactor that broke compiling on amd64. I've since fixed that -- can you try again at your convenience?\n. Hm. It looks like rtorrent is using `epoll` to wait for keyboard input, so while it's taking input from the right place, epoll holds a reference internally to the old terminal that I can't swap out. I have an idea for a different \"attach\" strategy that might work, but this is unfortunately probably unfixable with the current implementation. Thanks for the report, though :/\n. Yeah, it's very Linux-only. It might be possible to port, but it wouldn't be trivial. I'll add an error message that should make that clearer.\n. Thanks for the note. I just pushed a commit that tries to detect this failure mode and print a helpful message, and I'll add a note to the  docs.\n. It looks like RHEL 5's kernel, at least recent versions, does support those flags, but their userspace `ptrace.h` doesn't include them. I just pushed a patch that defines those constants ourselves if `ptrace.h` didn't, which should make reptyr work on RHEL 5 machines. Let me know if it works for you.\n. Unfortunately, there is no good way to free the old terminal in general. You can background the program and then do '`bg; disown`' yourself, or just close the old terminal (i.e. close the xterm or kill the screen window or whatever) -- reptyr causes the attached program to ignore `SIGHUP` so that it shouldn't be killed.\n. If I was willing to assume that the shell understands the \"bg\" and \"detach\" commands, I could probably inject those into the terminal and feed them to the shell at an appropriate time, and it wouldn't be unreasonable to add an option to do that. It wouldn't be trivial, though, since I'd need to find the other end of the pty in order to inject commands, and I don't know of a straightforward way to do that.\n. There is nothing that can be done about this in general, unfortunately. However, if you send `htop` (or most curses programs) a ctrl-L, it will redraw itself. `reptyr` sends programs a window-size-changed event on attach, which causes many programs to redraw themselves, but some, like `htop`, detect if the window hasn't actually changed size, and skip the redraw.\n. A port would be non-trivial; It depends pretty deeply on the details of the Linux kernel API, Linux's terminal handling `ioctl`s, Linux system calls, and `ptrace`. I suspect there are appropriate analogs for all of the pieces on modern BSDs, but I don't know much about BSD, so I'm unlikely to invest the effort any time soon. I'm happy to cluedump someone else if they want to try it, though.\n. Yeah, this seems like something reptyr could do. It's an easier problem than the\none I solve, in that there's no need to worry about the termios wankery, but\nthere's no reason not to support it.\n\nI don't have a lot of time for reptyr hacking right at the moment, but I'll add\nit to my TODO list.\n- Nelson\n\nOn Fri, May 06, 2011 at 10:03:51AM -0700, nbecker wrote:\n\n> One thing often happens.

It's not really intended behavior, but I don't know of a good way to fix it, since the relevant state is mostly held within the old terminal process, not in the kernel or the child process, and I don't want to make assumptions about the old terminal. So while I consider it a bit of a bug, I'm not sure it's one I can fix.\n.

Hey,\n\nI am fine carrying a specfile in the repo, but have you talked to whoever is maintaining reptyr in Fedora (http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/gitweb/?p=reptyr.git)? Looks like they already have a slightly different specfile, and it probably makes sense for me to carry whichever one is actually being used, assuming they would also find that useful.\n. Hm. I can confirm this behavior, but I am not sure quite what is causing it, at the moment. I'll investigate some time soon.\n\nNote that it is likely difficult to make backgrounding work exactly as though the target were actually started in the new shell, for various technical reasons.\n.

Unfortunately, due to somewhat-arcane technical reasons, reptyr does not support attaching processes that make use of subprocesses (like repo). I've just pushed a commit which adds earlier checking and hopefully a somewhat-better error message in this case.\n\nThis limitation might be possible to partially work around with some more work, but unfortunately, I think the primitives Linux gives us makes it impossible to work fully-correctly :/\n. reptyr does attach to the process via ptrace and perform operations in the process' address space, so it is theoretically possible for a bug somewhere to cause memory corruption. That said, I've written it with some care to minimize such risks, and never observed that sort of bug.\n\nI do recommend testing reptyr on a dry-run against any super-critical processes, but if that works, I would be pretty confident that it will fail safely, if it does, rather than by silently corrupting data.\n. Interesting. We _should_ be restoring the terminal state, but I can reproduce this issue, so I'll have to investigate. Thanks for the report.\n. Huh. Finally digging now. It turns out gdb does put the terminal in `-echo`, and then does echo itself (presumably via libreadline), (which is quite common), but that after being restored, it stops echoing. I haven't yet pegged why it does so.\n. Yeah, I'd really love to have this feature, but I've given it a bunch of thought and experimentation, and don't know of a robust way to do it with the operations Linux gives you. I came up with a completely different approach involving stealing the pty, but unfortunately it won't work for things started directly from an ssh session, which is much of the utility of reptyr :/\n\nIf that'd be useful, I'd consider doing a prototype, but I just don't know how to do this in general.\n. reptyr master now includes a `-T` option, which uses an entirely different attachment strategy that, among other advantages, will attach the entire target terminal, including all processes. I still consider it experimental, but I'd appreciate testing and bug reports.\n\nOne known limitation, unfortunately, because of how it works and an interaction with how `setuid` works on Linux, is that it won't normally work on sessions that are spawned out of an `ssh` session unless the attaching `reptyr` is run as root.\n. 1. is expected, because of the heuristic `reptyr` uses to find the terminal emulator (after attach, the `reptyr` becomes the new terminal emulator). It would be possible to fix this with a little creative work.\n2. I'm not quite sure what situation you're describing here. Can you be more specific about specifically which processes are doing what?\n. @melikyuksel It should work with `-T` in most cases, and I don't know of a way to make it work in reptyr's default mode, due to fundamental limitations of the terminal APIs exposed by the kernel. If you have specific issues with `-T`, feel free to open a new issue.\n. Thanks for the report. I think including `<linux/ptrace.h>` should be fine. Want to send along a pull reqest?\n. Thanks, merged\n. I'm pretty sure this will grant reptyr the ability to `ptrace(2)` **any** binary on the system, including ones running as different users.\n\nNow, this probably won't let you `reptyr` arbitrary processes, because you still can't read their `/proc/` entries, so `reptyr` will error it. But it means that any security bugs in `reptyr` -- buffer overflows, etc -- are now exploitable for root access on your system. And while I've tried to be careful while writing `reptyr`, that is not in its threat model, and I can't recommend you relying on accidental behavior in a security-critical way.\n. Hi, \n\nAre you able to build from the [grab-console](/nelhage/reptyr/tree/grab-console) branch, and report back whether that works for you?\n- Nelso\n. You can just override `PREFIX` by passing it on the command-line -- see the Debian packaging: https://github.com/nelhage/reptyr/blob/debian/debian/rules#L10\n\nSee http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Overriding.html --\n\n> An argument that contains \u2018=\u2019 specifies the value of a variable: \u2018v=x\u2019 sets the value of the variable v to x. If you specify a value in this way, all ordinary assignments of the same variable in the makefile are ignored; we say they have been overridden by the command line argument.\n\nGiven that, do you still need this?\n. See #29 -- this is actually redundant. But I've pushed e4757cdeedd4c4c0034d85db82d496ec5736d974 which adds a comment.\n. It seems like there should be a better place for this, but since there seems to be some interest in having it, and I'm unsure what other options obviously make sense, I'm happy to pick this up. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. I'm really not excited about adding autotools. It's an awful lot of complexity that mostly doesn't add much, since `reptyr` is super-unportable regardless. I really value having the simple \"just run make\" build.\n\nIf we want reallocarray -- which I agree with in general, but it seems more stylistic here, since I don't think you can possibly have that many fd's -- I'd probably just inline it as \"xreallocarray\" or some other name, instead of sucking in all that complexity.\n. @worr I'd be happy to see a more-portable reptyr (OOC, what platform(s) are you hoping to target?), but I'd rather hold off on the full-autotools route until it's clear we're getting value from it. My suspicion is that even if we added a (e.g.) FreeBSD port, we could get away with one file of definitions for Linux, and one for FreeBSD, and a simple conditional inclusion. The real value of autoconf is if there are N different axes along which platforms can be different, and you want to consider each of them individually.\n. Cool, I'd love to see that. And I'm definitely open to autotools if it provides clear wins, I just prefer to avoid it until then, since the pure-'make' build flow is so much simpler.\n\nI'm going to close this for now; Feel free to open another PR for either `xreallocarray` or similar, or for Solaris support as that developers!\n. Cool, I'd love to see that.

I believe that on Linux we can't get `EINTR` until we set up the `SIGWINCH` signal handler -- `EINTR` can only happen if a signal arrives and is handled by a userspace signal handler (c.f. http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Interrupted-Primitives.html). And there's a handful of things that are retried by this patch (e.g. `sscanf`) that can't ever (again, AFAIK) return `EINTR`. \n\nIf we do need to go down this route, I think I'd rather adopt something like glibc's `TEMP_FAILURE_RETRY` macro, instead of open-coding all the `do / while` loops inline everywhere.\n. Hm. I see no mention in [`termios(3)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/termios.3.html) of those functions being allowed to return `EINTR`, and, in general, I don't expect non-long-blocking functions to be ever return `EINTR`.\n. Hm, fair enough. Ok, I'd take that patch.\n. Cool, thanks.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks, seems reasonable.\n. I'm not particularly interested in error-handling fprintf, since it will just make the code much noisier for no particular practical benefit. sigaction would be reasonable.\n. I don't know what I would _do_ if the `fprintf` fails, here -- if we can't write to stderr, how are we going to report the error to the user? It should also be a super rare condition for writing to stderr to error out.\n. You can background+`disown` the process from the new terminal, as usual. `reptyr` has no particular support for detaching or backgrounding a process.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disown_(Unix)\n. Yep, it's on my list to do by year-end. I'd ideally like to get a few reports of `reptyr -T` working for people other than me, but I'll definitely do a release soonish regardless.\n. slower than I'd hoped, but done!\n. Hi,\n\nWas pid `31637` started via ssh? It's a known limitation with `-T` that it can't attach things started directly out of an ssh session, because the ssh process can't be `ptrace`'d because it dropped privileges. If `31637` doesn't have children, you can try running without `-T`\n. Oh, sorry, I missed the `sudo` in your command line. I would expect that to work, although I haven't been able to test `-T` on arm, so it's possible something is up there. Can you run `sudo strace -fo /tmp/reptyr.strace reptyr -T 31637` and attach the `/tmp/reptyr.strace` file?\n. ah-ha, I see the problem. Does https://github.com/nelhage/reptyr/commit/eacces make things better? That's a hackish solution, but if it works I can think about implementing a better one.\n. I think I've reproduced locally, but probably won't have a chance to dig further until later today or tomorrow.\n. I can reproduce something that seems similar on x86, so I'm hopeful it isn't.\n. Ok, does the https://github.com/nelhage/reptyr/commit/multifd branch do anything better for you?\n. Yep -- that's what `reptyr -T` does. It grabs the entire terminal session containing the process, shell and all. Without `-T`, it will just attach the specific process. Unfortunately, I don't know of a way to grab an entire process tree that isn't rooted in a terminal session.\n. That's correct (with -T). The behavior with and without `-T` are substantially different, unfortunately, with different limitations and advantages to each. I'm struggling with how to best document this / provide guidance on which to use :/\n. @PythonNut reptyr works by using `ptrace` to attach to the target processes and make syscalls remotely, which depends intimately on details of the underlying architecture's syscall ABI. As such, for each (OS, architecture) pair, it needs knowledge of the syscall register calling convention, syscall numbers, and some related information.\n. Merged by hand! I also wanted to finally add some automated testing to increase my confidence that I didn't break Linux support :)\n\nThanks for all your work!\n. Bah, I should have seen this coming. I'm deliberately ignoring the return value of `chown`, but I should have made that explicit. I'll push a fix. You can likely get to built via `CFLAGS=-Wno-unused-result` or take the next commit. I can push an `0.6.1` tag if that makes your life easier.\n. closed by d734f5f1b3e4c6be2753be1e1f52a2a4ab7ea4ab and 3960d133c8530c16d1c3bcebcc330b7055778647\n. Thanks!\n. Hmm. Is the builder running an ix86 chroot inside an x86_64 host? If so, this _may_ be related to that configuration.\n\nI'll try to spin up a Fedora box and see if I can debug.\n. an update \u2013 I spun up a Fedora 20 i386 box today and have been able to reproduce the failure. Haven't dug in further yet, but will update this issue as I do.\n. Turns out I completely misunderstood `socketcall`, and this never worked on ia32 (I never actually ran the test suite on 32-bit, myself). Thanks for reporting this! Can you verify that current master fixes the issue for you? If so, I'll release an 0.6.2.\n. Whoops, thanks for the report. Replaced with `sysconf` calls, and tested on both i386 and ARM.\n. Awesome,  thanks for verifying. Pushed 0.6.2 with both fixes.\n. awesome, thanks!\n. @Ulrar does `reptyr` then exit with an error, ot what do you see after that? That error is itself mostly harmless; It's an attempt to ensure that the shell running the old process (if there is one) behaves properly, but we can often still attach if that fails (and the code attempts to do so). Sounds good, thanks!\n. Doesn't `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` grant the process the ability to ptrace _any_ process on the system? You could e.g. steal a shell from `root`.\n\nIn order to make this safe, I think we'd have to make `reptyr` aware of when it was launched with elevated capabilities, and implement its own permission model for which processes it will allow itself to attach.\n. Cool, thanks! And yeah, I'd be happy to have this pulled into the port tree. I don't suppose that comes with any form of CI/automated builds to catch things like this in the future? :)\n. Hm, that's frustrating. It seems like a bug that `vim` doesn't respect ^L in that case, but it's also not unreasonable to want `repytr` to fail faster here. I think it wouldn't be hard to do a quick \u201cCan I attach?\u201d check before the initial SIGSTOP, but I'll take a look.\n. I just pushed a quick test to the preflight-check branch, that works in my testing. Want to take a look?\n. Hm, I think that it won't work currently if run on a non-root process as `root`, although I might be able to fix that.\n\nDoes `sudo reptyr -T $pid` work? That will engage a different mode of attaching, which is designed to work if run as root, among other things.\n. Does the above commit fix it? Seems like the easiest fix.\n\nWe had some vaguely similar issues with the clang analyzer that were fixed in f6f156365b15542714da601d2e26eecc49bbdeb0, but this one isn't obviously `errno`-related.\n. thanks!\n. I'm not opposed to this, but I'm curious if there was a specific motivation here. Did you run into problems with a particular GCC version or do you think reptyr is particularly likely to run into such problems?\n. My suspicion is that 4.4 and 4.5 aren't disparate enough to be likely to surface bugs, and that a lot of your problems are related to older kernel headers, which unfortunately aren't easy to test via Travis.\n\nI'd be happy to take a change to optionally disable `-Werror` in the `Makefile`, if that would make your life easier in that regard.\n. How do you feel about that fix I just pushed?\n. Can you confirm that #71 fixes this issue for you as well, and then I'll go ahead and merge.\n. The `PR_SET_PTRACER` code should only be needed under yama (which is to say, ~recent Ubuntu kernels, effectively). Does https://github.com/nelhage/reptyr/pull/70 do anything good?\n. Just pushed another commit on that branch \u2013 does that do any good?\n. Yeah \u2013 is that problematic in some way? I'm not sure of an easy way to check whether it's necessary. I could grub around for the yama sysctls, but that seems unsatisfactory.\n. Got it. Just pushed a change that will just swallow the `ImportError` with a warning message. That passes tests on my CentOS 5 VM, and I think should also work on Travis. I'll merge assuming it does.\n. :+1: thanks\n. :+1: thanks\n. Yep, this seems credible. Thanks!\n. `reptyr` doesn't natively support \"detaching\" from a process once it's been attached, and it would be tricky to do so. You might be able to re-`reptyr` the process back from the original shell, but in general I'd recommend using a tool like `screen(1)` or `tmux(1)` if you know you're going to be wanting to move shells around a bunch.\n. thanks!\n. See the discussion on #24 and I think a few other issues; On Linux it's possible with the `-T` option, but that hasn't been ported to FreeBSD yet. Unfortunately, I don't know of an effective way to do this, due to quirks in how the termios subsystem is designed.\n. Is there a good or fundamental reason that `PTRACE_TRACEME` will be defined iff `__ptrace_request` exists, or does that just \"happen to work\" today?\n. Yeah, OK, this makes sense to me \u2013 if it's defined, it's probably not an enumeration, and vice versa.\n\nThanks for the patch!\n. Hi,\r\n\r\nCan you confirm if the `gcc7` branch builds for you? It builds using my `gcc-7` from `ubuntu-toolchain-r/test`, but it'd be good to get confirmation.\r\n\r\nThanks for the report!. Thanks for the report! I'd love to get this in CI to make sure we don't regress, but I don't see an easy way to get gcc-7 packages in travis right now.. We don't support macOS, unfortunately. Probably that should be a better error, though, at least \u2026. I've got no plans to, as I don't use macOS and am not familiar with its terminal and debugging APIs and what it would take to implement `reptyr`. I'd potentially be open to a PR if such an expert is interested.. It may work better with `-T`, which uses a different strategy to attach.\nBut the default mode of operation cannot attach processes with children.\n\nOn Tue, Jun 20, 2017, 08:41 Manjunatha S M <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> ~/reptyr-master$ ./reptyr 946227\n> [-] Process 946489 (gmake) shares 946227's process group.

Do you have a `/proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope`?\r\n\r\n> I'm sometimes not sure how to use Reptyr with multiprocess programs\r\n\r\n`reptyr -T` is the only mode that will (may) work with multi-process programs, for somewhat complicated reasons.. If you run `reptyr -l` with a command line, it will execute that command with the `REPTYR_PTY` environment variable set.  So you could do something like\r\n\r\n```\r\nreptyr -l sh -c 'echo $REPTYR_PTY > /tmp/reptyr-pty'\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then read the pty out of that tmpfile.. Thanks!. Thanks, merged.\n. > If I run rtorrent as-is, then reptyr can move it however my old terminall still display rtorrent until i kill it (rtorrent that is).\n\nThat is expected and a known limitation. You can either close the old terminal (reptyr should protect rtorrent against being killed when you do so), or you can background rtorrent using `^Z` in the new window, and then run `bg; disown` in the old terminal to detach it entirely.\n\nI've just pushed a fix that should fix attaching processes run via screen. Can you let me know if it works for you?\n. My apologies; I did a refactor that broke compiling on amd64. I've since fixed that -- can you try again at your convenience?\n. Hm. It looks like rtorrent is using `epoll` to wait for keyboard input, so while it's taking input from the right place, epoll holds a reference internally to the old terminal that I can't swap out. I have an idea for a different \"attach\" strategy that might work, but this is unfortunately probably unfixable with the current implementation. Thanks for the report, though :/\n. Yeah, it's very Linux-only. It might be possible to port, but it wouldn't be trivial. I'll add an error message that should make that clearer.\n. Thanks for the note. I just pushed a commit that tries to detect this failure mode and print a helpful message, and I'll add a note to the  docs.\n. It looks like RHEL 5's kernel, at least recent versions, does support those flags, but their userspace `ptrace.h` doesn't include them. I just pushed a patch that defines those constants ourselves if `ptrace.h` didn't, which should make reptyr work on RHEL 5 machines. Let me know if it works for you.\n. Unfortunately, there is no good way to free the old terminal in general. You can background the program and then do '`bg; disown`' yourself, or just close the old terminal (i.e. close the xterm or kill the screen window or whatever) -- reptyr causes the attached program to ignore `SIGHUP` so that it shouldn't be killed.\n. If I was willing to assume that the shell understands the \"bg\" and \"detach\" commands, I could probably inject those into the terminal and feed them to the shell at an appropriate time, and it wouldn't be unreasonable to add an option to do that. It wouldn't be trivial, though, since I'd need to find the other end of the pty in order to inject commands, and I don't know of a straightforward way to do that.\n. There is nothing that can be done about this in general, unfortunately. However, if you send `htop` (or most curses programs) a ctrl-L, it will redraw itself. `reptyr` sends programs a window-size-changed event on attach, which causes many programs to redraw themselves, but some, like `htop`, detect if the window hasn't actually changed size, and skip the redraw.\n. A port would be non-trivial; It depends pretty deeply on the details of the Linux kernel API, Linux's terminal handling `ioctl`s, Linux system calls, and `ptrace`. I suspect there are appropriate analogs for all of the pieces on modern BSDs, but I don't know much about BSD, so I'm unlikely to invest the effort any time soon. I'm happy to cluedump someone else if they want to try it, though.\n. Yeah, this seems like something reptyr could do. It's an easier problem than the\none I solve, in that there's no need to worry about the termios wankery, but\nthere's no reason not to support it.\n\nI don't have a lot of time for reptyr hacking right at the moment, but I'll add\nit to my TODO list.\n- Nelson\n\nOn Fri, May 06, 2011 at 10:03:51AM -0700, nbecker wrote:\n\n> One thing often happens.

It's not really intended behavior, but I don't know of a good way to fix it, since the relevant state is mostly held within the old terminal process, not in the kernel or the child process, and I don't want to make assumptions about the old terminal.

Hey,\n\nI am fine carrying a specfile in the repo, but have you talked to whoever is maintaining reptyr in Fedora (http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/gitweb/?p=reptyr.git)? Looks like they already have a slightly different specfile, and it probably makes sense for me to carry whichever one is actually being used, assuming they would also find that useful.\n. Hm. I can confirm this behavior, but I am not sure quite what is causing it, at the moment. I'll investigate some time soon.\n\nNote that it is likely difficult to make backgrounding work exactly as though the target were actually started in the new shell, for various technical reasons.\n.

Unfortunately, due to somewhat-arcane technical reasons, reptyr does not support attaching processes that make use of subprocesses (like repo). I've just pushed a commit which adds earlier checking and hopefully a somewhat-better error message in this case.\n\nThis limitation might be possible to partially work around with some more work, but unfortunately, I think the primitives Linux gives us makes it impossible to work fully-correctly :/\n. reptyr does attach to the process via ptrace and perform operations in the process' address space, so it is theoretically possible for a bug somewhere to cause memory corruption. That said, I've written it with some care to minimize such risks, and never observed that sort of bug.\n\nI do recommend testing reptyr on a dry-run against any super-critical processes, but if that works, I would be pretty confident that it will fail safely, if it does, rather than by silently corrupting data.\n. Interesting. We _should_ be restoring the terminal state, but I can reproduce this issue, so I'll have to investigate. Thanks for the report.\n. Huh. Finally digging now. It turns out gdb does put the terminal in `-echo`, and then does echo itself (presumably via libreadline), (which is quite common), but that after being restored, it stops echoing. I haven't yet pegged why it does so.\n. Yeah, I'd really love to have this feature, but I've given it a bunch of thought and experimentation, and don't know of a robust way to do it with the operations Linux gives you. I came up with a completely different approach involving stealing the pty, but unfortunately it won't work for things started directly from an ssh session, which is much of the utility of reptyr :/\n\nIf that'd be useful, I'd consider doing a prototype, but I just don't know how to do this in general.\n. reptyr master now includes a `-T` option, which uses an entirely different attachment strategy that, among other advantages, will attach the entire target terminal, including all processes. I still consider it experimental, but I'd appreciate testing and bug reports.\n\nOne known limitation, unfortunately, because of how it works and an interaction with how `setuid` works on Linux, is that it won't normally work on sessions that are spawned out of an `ssh` session unless the attaching `reptyr` is run as root.\n. 1. is expected, because of the heuristic `reptyr` uses to find the terminal emulator (after attach, the `reptyr` becomes the new terminal emulator). It would be possible to fix this with a little creative work.\n2. I'm not quite sure what situation you're describing here. Can you be more specific about specifically which processes are doing what?\n. @melikyuksel It should work with `-T` in most cases, and I don't know of a way to make it work in reptyr's default mode, due to fundamental limitations of the terminal APIs exposed by the kernel. If you have specific issues with `-T`, feel free to open a new issue.\n. Thanks for the report. I think including `<linux/ptrace.h>` should be fine. Want to send along a pull reqest?\n. Thanks, merged\n. I'm pretty sure this will grant reptyr the ability to `ptrace(2)` **any** binary on the system, including ones running as different users.\n\nNow, this probably won't let you `reptyr` arbitrary processes, because you still can't read their `/proc/` entries, so `reptyr` will error it. But it means that any security bugs in `reptyr` -- buffer overflows, etc -- are now exploitable for root access on your system. And while I've tried to be careful while writing `reptyr`, that is not in its threat model, and I can't recommend you relying on accidental behavior in a security-critical way.\n. Hi, \n\nAre you able to build from the [grab-console](/nelhage/reptyr/tree/grab-console) branch, and report back whether that works for you?\n- Nelso\n. You can just override `PREFIX` by passing it on the command-line -- see the Debian packaging: https://github.com/nelhage/reptyr/blob/debian/debian/rules#L10\n\nSee http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Overriding.html --\n\n> An argument that contains \u2018=\u2019 specifies the value of a variable: \u2018v=x\u2019 sets the value of the variable v to x. If you specify a value in this way, all ordinary assignments of the same variable in the makefile are ignored; we say they have been overridden by the command line argument.\n\nGiven that, do you still need this?\n. See #29 -- this is actually redundant. But I've pushed e4757cdeedd4c4c0034d85db82d496ec5736d974 which adds a comment.\n. It seems like there should be a better place for this, but since there seems to be some interest in having it, and I'm unsure what other options obviously make sense, I'm happy to pick this up. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. I'm really not excited about adding autotools. It's an awful lot of complexity that mostly doesn't add much, since `reptyr` is super-unportable regardless. I really value having the simple \"just run make\" build.\n\nIf we want reallocarray -- which I agree with in general, but it seems more stylistic here, since I don't think you can possibly have that many fd's -- I'd probably just inline it as \"xreallocarray\" or some other name, instead of sucking in all that complexity.\n. @worr I'd be happy to see a more-portable reptyr (OOC, what platform(s) are you hoping to target?), but I'd rather hold off on the full-autotools route until it's clear we're getting value from it. My suspicion is that even if we added a (e.g.) FreeBSD port, we could get away with one file of definitions for Linux, and one for FreeBSD, and a simple conditional inclusion. The real value of autoconf is if there are N different axes along which platforms can be different, and you want to consider each of them individually.\n. Cool, I'd love to see that. And I'm definitely open to autotools if it provides clear wins, I just prefer to avoid it until then, since the pure-'make' build flow is so much simpler.\n\nI'm going to close this for now; Feel free to open another PR for either `xreallocarray` or similar, or for Solaris support as that developers!\n.

I believe that on Linux we can't get `EINTR` until we set up the `SIGWINCH` signal handler -- `EINTR` can only happen if a signal arrives and is handled by a userspace signal handler (c.f. http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Interrupted-Primitives.html). And there's a handful of things that are retried by this patch (e.g. `sscanf`) that can't ever (again, AFAIK) return `EINTR`. \n\nIf we do need to go down this route, I think I'd rather adopt something like glibc's `TEMP_FAILURE_RETRY` macro, instead of open-coding all the `do / while` loops inline everywhere.\n. Hm. I see no mention in [`termios(3)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/termios.3.html) of those functions being allowed to return `EINTR`, and, in general, I don't expect non-long-blocking functions to be ever return `EINTR`.\n. Hm, fair enough. Ok, I'd take that patch.\n. Cool, thanks.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks, seems reasonable.\n. I'm not particularly interested in error-handling fprintf, since it will just make the code much noisier for no particular practical benefit. sigaction would be reasonable.\n. I don't know what I would _do_ if the `fprintf` fails, here -- if we can't write to stderr, how are we going to report the error to the user? It should also be a super rare condition for writing to stderr to error out.\n. You can background+`disown` the process from the new terminal, as usual. `reptyr` has no particular support for detaching or backgrounding a process.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disown_(Unix)\n. Yep, it's on my list to do by year-end. I'd ideally like to get a few reports of `reptyr -T` working for people other than me, but I'll definitely do a release soonish regardless.\n. slower than I'd hoped, but done!\n. Hi,\n\nWas pid `31637` started via ssh? It's a known limitation with `-T` that it can't attach things started directly out of an ssh session, because the ssh process can't be `ptrace`'d because it dropped privileges. If `31637` doesn't have children, you can try running without `-T`\n. Oh, sorry, I missed the `sudo` in your command line. I would expect that to work, although I haven't been able to test `-T` on arm, so it's possible something is up there. Can you run `sudo strace -fo /tmp/reptyr.strace reptyr -T 31637` and attach the `/tmp/reptyr.strace` file?\n. ah-ha, I see the problem. Does https://github.com/nelhage/reptyr/commit/eacces make things better? That's a hackish solution, but if it works I can think about implementing a better one.\n. I think I've reproduced locally, but probably won't have a chance to dig further until later today or tomorrow.\n. I can reproduce something that seems similar on x86, so I'm hopeful it isn't.\n. Ok, does the https://github.com/nelhage/reptyr/commit/multifd branch do anything better for you?\n. Yep -- that's what `reptyr -T` does. It grabs the entire terminal session containing the process, shell and all. Without `-T`, it will just attach the specific process. Unfortunately, I don't know of a way to grab an entire process tree that isn't rooted in a terminal session.\n. That's correct (with -T). The behavior with and without `-T` are substantially different, unfortunately, with different limitations and advantages to each. I'm struggling with how to best document this / provide guidance on which to use :/\n. @PythonNut reptyr works by using `ptrace` to attach to the target processes and make syscalls remotely, which depends intimately on details of the underlying architecture's syscall ABI. As such, for each (OS, architecture) pair, it needs knowledge of the syscall register calling convention, syscall numbers, and some related information.\n. Merged by hand! I also wanted to finally add some automated testing to increase my confidence that I didn't break Linux support :)\n\nThanks for all your work!\n. Bah, I should have seen this coming. I'm deliberately ignoring the return value of `chown`, but I should have made that explicit. I'll push a fix. You can likely get to built via `CFLAGS=-Wno-unused-result` or take the next commit. I can push an `0.6.1` tag if that makes your life easier.\n. closed by d734f5f1b3e4c6be2753be1e1f52a2a4ab7ea4ab and 3960d133c8530c16d1c3bcebcc330b7055778647\n. Thanks!\n. Hmm. Is the builder running an ix86 chroot inside an x86_64 host?

Haven't dug in further yet, but will update this issue as I do.\n. Turns out I completely misunderstood `socketcall`, and this never worked on ia32 (I never actually ran the test suite on 32-bit, myself). Thanks for reporting this! Can you verify that current master fixes the issue for you? If so, I'll release an 0.6.2.\n. Whoops, thanks for the report. Replaced with `sysconf` calls, and tested on both i386 and ARM.\n. Awesome,  thanks for verifying. Pushed 0.6.2 with both fixes.\n. awesome, thanks!\n. @Ulrar does `reptyr` then exit with an error, ot what do you see after that? That error is itself mostly harmless; It's an attempt to ensure that the shell running the old process (if there is one) behaves properly, but we can often still attach if that fails (and the code attempts to do so). Sounds good, thanks!\n. Doesn't `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` grant the process the ability to ptrace _any_ process on the system? You could e.g. steal a shell from `root`.\n\nIn order to make this safe, I think we'd have to make `reptyr` aware of when it was launched with elevated capabilities, and implement its own permission model for which processes it will allow itself to attach.\n. Cool, thanks! And yeah, I'd be happy to have this pulled into the port tree. I don't suppose that comes with any form of CI/automated builds to catch things like this in the future? :)\n. Hm, that's frustrating. It seems like a bug that `vim` doesn't respect ^L in that case, but it's also not unreasonable to want `repytr` to fail faster here. I think it wouldn't be hard to do a quick \u201cCan I attach?\u201d check before the initial SIGSTOP, but I'll take a look.\n. I just pushed a quick test to the preflight-check branch, that works in my testing. Want to take a look?\n. Hm, I think that it won't work currently if run on a non-root process as `root`, although I might be able to fix that.\n\nDoes `sudo reptyr -T $pid` work? That will engage a different mode of attaching, which is designed to work if run as root, among other things.\n. Does the above commit fix it? Seems like the easiest fix.\n\nWe had some vaguely similar issues with the clang analyzer that were fixed in f6f156365b15542714da601d2e26eecc49bbdeb0, but this one isn't obviously `errno`-related.\n. thanks!\n. I'm not opposed to this, but I'm curious if there was a specific motivation here. Did you run into problems with a particular GCC version or do you think reptyr is particularly likely to run into such problems?\n. My suspicion is that 4.4 and 4.5 aren't disparate enough to be likely to surface bugs, and that a lot of your problems are related to older kernel headers, which unfortunately aren't easy to test via Travis.\n\nI'd be happy to take a change to optionally disable `-Werror` in the `Makefile`, if that would make your life easier in that regard.\n. How do you feel about that fix I just pushed?\n. Can you confirm that #71 fixes this issue for you as well, and then I'll go ahead and merge.\n. The `PR_SET_PTRACER` code should only be needed under yama (which is to say, ~recent Ubuntu kernels, effectively). Does https://github.com/nelhage/reptyr/pull/70 do anything good?\n. Just pushed another commit on that branch \u2013 does that do any good?\n. Yeah \u2013 is that problematic in some way? I'm not sure of an easy way to check whether it's necessary. I could grub around for the yama sysctls, but that seems unsatisfactory.\n. Got it. Just pushed a change that will just swallow the `ImportError` with a warning message. That passes tests on my CentOS 5 VM, and I think should also work on Travis. I'll merge assuming it does.\n. :+1: thanks\n. :+1: thanks\n. Yep, this seems credible. Thanks!\n. `reptyr` doesn't natively support \"detaching\" from a process once it's been attached, and it would be tricky to do so. You might be able to re-`reptyr` the process back from the original shell, but in general I'd recommend using a tool like `screen(1)` or `tmux(1)` if you know you're going to be wanting to move shells around a bunch.\n. thanks!\n. See the discussion on #24 and I think a few other issues; On Linux it's possible with the `-T` option, but that hasn't been ported to FreeBSD yet. Unfortunately, I don't know of an effective way to do this, due to quirks in how the termios subsystem is designed.\n. Is there a good or fundamental reason that `PTRACE_TRACEME` will be defined iff `__ptrace_request` exists, or does that just \"happen to work\" today?\n. Yeah, OK, this makes sense to me \u2013 if it's defined, it's probably not an enumeration, and vice versa.\n\nThanks for the patch!\n. Hi,\r\n\r\nCan you confirm if the `gcc7` branch builds for you? It builds using my `gcc-7` from `ubuntu-toolchain-r/test`, but it'd be good to get confirmation.\r\n\r\nThanks for the report!. Thanks for the report! I'd love to get this in CI to make sure we don't regress, but I don't see an easy way to get gcc-7 packages in travis right now.. We don't support macOS, unfortunately. Probably that should be a better error, though, at least \u2026. I've got no plans to, as I don't use macOS and am not familiar with its terminal and debugging APIs and what it would take to implement `reptyr`. I'd potentially be open to a PR if such an expert is interested.. It may work better with `-T`, which uses a different strategy to attach.\nBut the default mode of operation cannot attach processes with children.\n\nOn Tue, Jun 20, 2017, 08:41 Manjunatha S M <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> ~/reptyr-master$ ./reptyr 946227\n> [-] Process 946489 (gmake) shares 946227's process group.

Do you have a `/proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope`?\r\n\r\n> I'm sometimes not sure how to use Reptyr with multiprocess programs\r\n\r\n`reptyr -T` is the only mode that will (may) work with multi-process programs, for somewhat complicated reasons.. If you run `reptyr -l` with a command line, it will execute that command with the `REPTYR_PTY` environment variable set.  So you could do something like\r\n\r\n```\r\nreptyr -l sh -c 'echo $REPTYR_PTY > /tmp/reptyr-pty'\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then read the pty out of that tmpfile.. Thanks!. ",
