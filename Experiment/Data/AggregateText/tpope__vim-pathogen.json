    "tpope": "I've settled on adding a README instead. I don't want to complicate installation with a second file, seeing as how you can't use Pathogen to help you install Pathogen. ;)\n. You need to ensure pathogen is invoked before `filetype plugin indent on`. And on Debian based distributions and others that enable it automatically, you need to do `filetype off` first.\n\nThere's not much I can do about this but it does need to be better documented.\n. I'm as baffled now as I was a year ago, but I've refactored to remove that disabling logic from the glob, hopefully rendering the issue moot. Let me know if it's still an issue.\n. Accepted, thanks.\n. The vim-git-branch-info repository doesn't place its plugin file in the `plugin/` directory; thus adding it to the load path doesn't cause the plugin to load. There's not much I can do about that.\n. Yeah, rson's comment is spot on. What is `$VIM` set to on Windows? Based on your response, I'm guessing it's blank?\n. You know it's possible (and, I dare say, more correct) to install add-ons in `$HOME\\vimfiles`, right?\n. Vim's file system APIs are pretty horrendous. I guess I could `:silent!` the errors but I worry that might swallow something informative.\n. I have the same thing in my vimrc and I agree it's a pain. However, just turning it off in `pathogen#runtime_append_all_bundles()` is kind of invasive (and also not the only function that's affected). I tried and failed to create a smarter solution several months back.\n. Accepted, thanks.\n. Sigh, this is why I'm so reluctant to accept pull requests. Fixed.\n. I was actually bitching about the original pull request that broke things (which I left lingering for days before blindly accepting after further pestering).\n\nI generally recommend a feature request or bug report before a pull request because (1) it oftentimes would take me minutes and you hours, and (2) some bugs may be deliberate behavior, and some feature requests may be deliberate omissions.\n. This confused me until I realized it was already fixed in f4f79bc7205b6c101955f32985a4d1b1da0be556. A release is overdue.\n. You've got DOS line endings in your file. Redownload it.\n\nAnd invoking helptags doesn't make sense before the load path has been changed.\n. You seem to be operating under the errant assumption that runtime files can only go under `$VIM` or `$VIMRUNTIME`. Just put them in `$HOME\\vimfiles` and everything should work fine.\n. The real issue is that Vim offers no API to check if a directory is writable, and `$VIM` usually isn't. This takes precedence over someone storing user preferences in `Program Files` like it's 1995.  Having done my time on Windows, I can most definitely assure you that messy though `$HOME` may be, strewing user preferences across `Program Files` is infinitely less maintainable.\n\nThis is not to say I'm not interested in a solution that works for everyone, just that doing things the normal way takes precedence over the weird way.\n. It looks like Vim stores the value of `'runtimepath'` in `Session.vim`. You can prevent that with `:set sessionoptions-=options`, though that has the side effect of not persisting any global options, which may or may not be acceptable to you. Other than that, I'm afraid my hands are tied.\n. For me as well, but I can still clone from that URL, so I assume all is normal?\n. The section you quote mentions a vim.org url, not a github.com one. That should work.\n\nIf all else fails, drill into the repository and download pathogen.vim by hand.\n. Create your own custom excludes list and ignore tags there.\n\n```\ngit config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitexcludes'\necho tags > ~/.gitexcludes\n```\n\nWay easier than modifying every plugin out there.\n. Looks pretty good, although it won't work on Windows. See if the variant I pushed up works for you.\n. Merged, thanks.\n. Fair enough, I added a note on the vim.org download page. If I ever get around to adding a README, I'll add it there too.\n. The crux of this issue is\n1. Vim doesn't provide an API to tell if a directory is writable or not.\n2. If I try to help-tag a `$VIM` directory on UNIX, it pitches a fit because of permissions.\n3. Storing your personal config outside of `$HOME` in 2011 is archaic, to say the list.\n4. I prioritize people doing the right thing on UNIX about people doing the weird thing on Windows.\n\nI highly recommend moving your plugins to `$HOME\\vimfiles` on Windows.\n. I could have sworn I closely investigated `filewritable()` back when I first implemented this, but apparently not. That's all I needed to fix it. Thanks!\n\nI stand by my \"weird\" assertion. These \"portable\" apps are intended for like a USB flash drive, right? That's a legitimate use case I hadn't considered (though personally I'd still prefer my personal config files to be separate from application files, if only for ease of backing up). However, nobody who has raised this issue has mentioned anything but a `C:\\` path. Weird weird weird.\n. Bonus: now that this little inconsistency is cleared up, I feel confident claiming `:Helptags` as a `pathogen#helptags()` wrapper.\n. The underlying `:helptags` doesn't allow overriding a destination, so this is a non-starter. What I do is basically `git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.cvsignore'` and `echo tags >> ~/.cvsignore` (you can use any file you like, but `.cvsignore` is handily consulted by other tools like rsync).\n. I do something similar. My own plugins are all centralized, though, so I can handle them with a much cheaper\n\n```\ncall pathogen#runtime_prepend_subdirectories(\"~/src/vim/bundle\")\n```\n\nMy guess is you have a similar setup (with `~/.vim/plugins`). If so, you could try that and see if it improves performance.\n\nI _could_ add a loop if you really need it. But less code is better in my book.\n. By doesn't work, do you mean not at all, or just that it regresses to being slow?\n. Looks like I tried to reproduce this months ago and failed, but forgot to post back to the issue. I just made a fresh attempt to reproduce it and I still can't.  Note the Git version isn't distributed with a help file either; instead, it does some weird self mutilation to generate one (check `git status` in the repository after invoking Vim), and I'm guessing that's somehow to blame.  You can try to narrow it down by killing the showmarks `tags` file and seeing if the issue persists.  Other than that I'm tempted to pin the blame on showmarks and move on.\n. I can pretty much guarantee you that load order isn't the issue, as I'm using the same setup, and rails.vim doesn't check for surround.vim until long after all plugins have loaded. Here's the relevant code from rails.vim:\n\nhttps://github.com/tpope/vim-rails/blob/1bd7f2b8dc57f8e9e48d714a4b32218a0c67d53b/autoload/rails.vim#L4620-4642\n\nYou should try `:echo b:surround_45` to see if it's successfully configured. If not, I'd try adding a bunch of `:echomsg \"foo\"`s all up and down that snippet of code and see if you can tell which conditional takes a wrong turn.\n. I've seen that done to support certain snippet plugins before. Seems kind of pointless to me, but it's pretty easy to support.\n. Hi Seth, this is some good stuff. To address your specific points:\n1. Even I can't remember the name of `pathogen#runtime_append_all_bundles()`. It took me a little too long to recognize the parallel between \"infect\" and \"pathogen\", but now that I do, I like it.\n2. `:Helptags` is a very recent addition. I hope some prominent documentation will take most of the pain away. That said, I'm not a big fan of forcing it each startup, and for better or worse, I'd rather stick with the Vim practice of making the user ultimately responsible for it. If users want to do that by putting it in their vimrc, that's okay.\n3. Dude, I spent a few hours on a rathole of trying to parse the output of `:filetype` so that I could do exactly this (it mostly worked). It never occurred to me to check for a global variable.\n\nIf you could make the following tiny changes, I'll be quite happy to merge:\n- Drop the `l:` prefixes.\n- Use separate lines rather than `|`. VimL is pretty damn hard to read as it is.\n- Ditch the `pathogen#helptags()` call. I _might_ allow it at some future juncture.\n- Squash into the same commit and capitalize the commit message.\n\nThanks!\n. Sweet! Automatic `pathogen#helptags()` invocation is off the table until after the next release, which should hopefully happen within a week if I don't get too distracted. I want to draft a slick README to go with it.\n. Yeah, I can't reproduce either, so I'm killing it.\n. Yep, that's a recently added function that I need to cut a release for. It should hopefully clear up most of the confusion around this.\n. No can do, partner. Vim's `:helptags` takes a path to a directory, and that's it.\n\nSee the install instructions on [the vim.org page](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332) for how to add `tags` to the global Git excludes list.\n\nBy the way, I recently added (but not yet documented) `:Helptags` for easier invocation.\n. Please [fix the commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html) and I'll merge it in. Thanks!\n. Yep, thanks!\n. Is there anything in `~/.vim/doc`? If it's just a tags file, you may need to remove it.\n. I see you've already taken initiative in making this standalone, so I am closing the pull request.  For my part, I've added a README that takes a middle ground between completely automating the install and leaving the user to figure it out himself. :)\n. That's the new interface. It hasn't been cut into a release yet, but it will be soon.\n. Happy to merge, but was this actually breaking helptags on Windows? Surprised this is the first I've heard of it.\n. I just booted up my Windows VM and verified it does indeed generate tags on it. Were you getting an error, or just silent failure? You do _not_ have `'shellslash'` set, correct?\n. `'shellslash'` is mainly used with setups like Cygwin. I don't have it set either (but it can be relevant so I thought I'd ask).\n\nI was looking for an error on `:call pathogen#helptags()` or `:Helptags`, not the actual `:help` invocation.\n\nI've gone ahead and merged in your changes, but I'd still like to isolate the cause, so that I can determine the priority of cutting a new release. If I can't find anything, I'm going to assume it's something really weird in your setup, and hold off on a release.\n. Obvious perhaps, but completely untrue. `:echo isdirectory('C:/Windows')` returns 1 (true). `:e ~/_vimrc` correctly edits the file. The only reason I bother with backslashes at all is so `'runtimepath'` isn't an ugly mixture of the two. Something is broken on your machine. You can start investigating by running those two commands and seeing if they work for you.\n. `:echo` not `:call`\n. Ergh, I've reused this boilerplate in multiple repositories.\n\nThanks!\n. Where does `:verbose set filetype?` report that the option was set?\n. If you take out the call to pathogen but replace it with:\n\n```\nfiletype off\nfiletype on\n```\n\nWhat happens?\n. Okay, well therein lies the problem. If you're invoking pathogen after you've enabled filetypes, you can try moving the call to pathogen up and that should fix it.  If it's your Vim distribution doing it, however, you may have little choice but to invoke a workaround:\n\n```\nautocmd BufNewFile,BufRead *.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG set ft=gitcommit\n```\n\nAre you using a Linux distro's provided Vim? What distro?\n. For the record, I just tried that locally, and it didn't break file type detection for me. In fact, Debian does something similar (`:filetype on`) and I've never had an issue with that. I'm guessing something more nuanced is going on.\n\nI'd be interested to see if a second Gentoo user could reproduce this.\n. @wokka has reproduced this as well, this time on Ubuntu.\n. So `:syntax on` is the trigger, eh? That might give us some options.  Tell me, all of you affected, if you add `syntax on` to your vimrc after calling pathogen, does it fix the issue?\n. Well toggling the filetype off and on enables ftdetect files in bundles to be loaded.  That's the reason for infect.\n\nDebian does not have `syntax on`.  With that clue, I imagine I can figure something out.  I just need some time to dig in.\n. Interesting point. I'll add it.\n\nBTW, this is how I used to sidestep that problem on Windows:\n\n```\nif has(\"win32\")\n  let &runtimepath =\n        \\ substitute(&runtimepath,'Documents and Settings[\\\\/][^\\\\/,]*[\\\\/]\\zsvimfiles\\>','.vim','g')\nendif\n```\n. Looks to be the same as #38. If you take out the call to pathogen and put the following instead, does it still break?\n\n```\nfiletype off\nfiletype on\n```\n. Well there's your workaround. Are you on Gentoo as well?\n. Conf highlighting is a weird special case:  It's the last check in filetype.vim and looks for `#` comments near the top of the file. That doesn't explain much, though.\n\nI'm guessing you're just not looking hard enough for that `filetype on`.  Debian, for instance, used to have it in debian.vim (but it seems to have been removed). Maybe `:grep '^ *filetype.*on' $VIM/**/*.vim /etc/vim`.\n\nI'm closing this as a dupe of #38.  Additional information should be posted there.\n. My guess is the real problem is that you're trying to use fugitive.vim outside of a Git repository. There's no conceivable way for plugin loading to be deferred until after `:Vedit` is invoked.\n. Hi Daniel,\n\nIs there some advantage to `; \\` chaining I'm missing? Both seem equally copy-and-pastable to me.\n. Eh, an iffy argument, but I'll accept it.  Please squash those two commits into one and I'll merge it in.\n. Thanks.\n. Thanks. I fixed your commit message this time; please use a real one in the future.\n. This is as intended. Fugitive merely preps the runtime path so that Vim is aware of your bundles during plugin load time.  As far as `fugitive#statusline()` goes, if you add it to `'statusline'`, the plugin will be loaded before the function is invoked.\n. ```\n:help fugitive-statusline\n```\n. It works fine in your vimrc. Copy the `set` line exactly from the help.\n. Works fine for me.\n. @jmcaffee, that solution causes every single directory inside every single bundle to be added, surely not what you had in mind.\n\nAs a first step, can you post the output of `:set runtimepath?` when pathogen is _not_ activated?\n. I don't think there's a limit on length, just `:set` output length. Try `:echo &runtimepath` rather than `:set runtimepath?`\n\nThat's a weird mixture of `\\` and `/` in your runtimepath, but it should work fine.\n. Then what did you mean by a \"limit on the length of the runtimepath\"?\n. It does look deeper once it hits the after directories in `'runtimepath'`. That is, it adds `~/vimfiles/bundle/*` when it hits `~/vimfiles` and adds `~/vimfiles/bundle/*/after` when it hits `~/vimfiles/after`.\n. Not sure I follow. When I `:set rtp?`, I see paths with `~`. But when I `:echo &rtp`, they're already expanded.\n\nAlso, that count thing sounds like a separate pull request.\n. Can you see if `simplify()` or `resolve()` fixes it? Those feel more appropriate.\n. Fair enough. Can you squash it into one commit?\n. Thanks. I fixed the commit message to be [conventional](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html); please do this in the future.\n. Okay, so I like this feature and want to keep it, although you wouldn't know that by looking because it's apparently broken. Easy to fix, though.\n\nAs for the issue at hand, it looks like it can be fixed without dropping the feature by using -range=1 instead. Right? I've pushed it up if you want to check for further issues with it.\n. What is the output of `:set cp?`. Pathogen does not work in compatibility mode.\n. Literally the only thing that can cause this is installing Pathogen in the wrong place, or not at all.\n. Indeed. Automatically generating helptags is kind of \"un-Vim-like\", and you won't catch me doing it, but the downsides are minimal.\n. Can you paste the output of `:echo &runtimepath`? Sounds like the `after/` path is getting added but the root path is not.\n. See #38. I've been putting off revisiting it.\n. There's a fix in Vim now. http://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/patches/7.3/7.3.430\n. I've wanted something like this for a while. Two big caveats:\n1. Calling `pathogen#infect()` a second time results in scanning not just the original runtime path, but also inside any bundles that were added the previous go around. With a lot of bundles, this is noticeably slow. Plus the path ends up in a weird order.\n2. If Vim has already loaded, we need to manually activate plugins and filetype detection. This is not necessarily unfeasible, but I'm guessing there are edge cases hiding in there (things like #38).\n. Thanks.\n. I don't understand how this would help. Are you trying to make `.vim` itself a submodule?\n. Sounds janky as hell, and would just confuse people. I'm gonna pass. Note that as the docs explain, there are other ways to make pathogen a submodule.\n. Try\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/jelera/vim-gummybears-colorscheme ~/.vim/bundle/vim-gummybears-colorscheme\n```\n. Yes, the root of each set of runtime files must sit in `bundle`.\n. Looks like it, but then again pathogen never shells out so I don't know why it would cause this. What makes you think pathogen is to blame?\n. If there's no backtrace, there's not much for me to work with here. What happens if you don't call `pathogen#infect()` but still load the file with `:source ~/.vim/autoload/pathogen.vim`?\n. Looks like `glob()` requires shelling out. In which case I'm afraid there's not much that can be done.\n. One thing you could try is `set shell=/bin/bash` early in your vimrc.\n. It should work fine. What makes you think it failed to load? Is it in `:set runtimepath?`?\n\n/cc @sjl\n. Well it used to work :/. Thanks for bringing it to my attention.\n. Yes, I was going to say this is well tread territory. Can you try grabbing pathogen.vim out of each of commits that supposedly fixed each respective issue and see which of them are functional?\n. As a curiosity, here's how I solved the same problem. It makes some assumptions about the directory structure, but so far they've always held true:\n\n```\nif has(\"win32\")\n  let &runtimepath = substitute(&runtimepath,'\\(Documents and Settings\\|Users\\)[\\\\/][^\\\\/,]*[\\\\/]\\zsvimfiles\\>','.vim','g')\nendif\n```\n. According to `:help 'rtp` the default is based on `$HOME`. Are there cases where `$HOME` isn't set? I'm debating adding a function for this to pathogen proper.\n\n`expand('~')` is probably the right solution actually. Should work on any platform.\n. If it were me, I'd kill the `runtime!` invocation (Vim does that automatically) and  move the post-config chunk to `.vim/after/plugin/csapprox.vim` (or whatever the corresponding filename is). Don't think too much about the `after` in the path; it will load regardless of whether the original plugin loaded.\n\nI don't think there's much that can be done about the pre-config chunk. I just have a section in my vimrc for plugin settings.\n. I just do `silent! call pathogen#infect()`. But that takes away the ability to conditionally load `bundle_config.vim`, if you care about that sort of thing.\n. Just took a quick peak at the implementation and I'm inclined to agree. It's actually hard coded to assume it's installed in the first directory in runtime path.\n\nMight I recommend https://github.com/kien/rainbow_parentheses.vim?\n. What's the use case for dot prefixed bundles?  All these `glob()` calls add up, unfortunately.\n. It's a trade-off. Automatic help tag generation means hiding or spamming errors on startup, and potentially a slower load time.  Whenever there's no clear right answer, I do what Vim does. And Vim does not generate help tags automatically.\n\n`:Helptags` is in the README. Perhaps it needs to be more prominent.\n. Yep. Note that particular file is already included with Vim (`:edit $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/spec.vim`), so in this case you didn't really need to do anything at all. :)\n. Sorry for letting this hang. Docs are now in scriptease.vim.\n. Let's start with pinning down your use case. Are these `after/` files you're trying to edit? I usually get to those with `:Vopen after/...`. Other than that, I almost never need a count, so I'm curious why you do.\n\nAdding`:Vopenall` would turn `:Vo` into an ambiguous command, so I don't think I'll go that route. I like the `0` idea.\n. I've extracted the `:Vopen` command to [scriptease.vim](/tpope/vim-scriptease), and in the process, added support for loading all matches into the location list. Try it out, and feel free to open a new scriptease.vim issue if you have any ideas for improvements.\n. Does `:Vopen ftp\\git<Tab>` work as expected? If so, it should be a simple fix.\n. I took a blind stab at it. Let me know if it doesn't work.\n. This happens on firing of `git commit`, but not when running `vim`?\n. Sounds like Git is invoking Vim weird, maybe? Check `ps aux` while it's running and see if you can find exactly how vim was invoked.\n. You screwed up the copy and paste.\n. I've done something similar (use `~\\.vim` rather than `~\\vimfiles` on Windows) and it works fine. Please clarify \"does not work.\"\n.

Autoload is deferred until you call a function defined in a namespace matching the filename.  For example, calling `foo#bar()` would cause `autoload/foo.vim` to be loaded.\n\nIn the case of togglebg, there's some function you have to call to activate it. Check the docs.\n. Probably possible, but super tricky. The first challenge is to add it to the runtime path. What position does it belong in? The OCD part of me wants to inject it into the exact spot it would have appeared if it had been loaded with Vim. But I guess we could get by with something more predictable.\n\nThe harder part is actually loading plugins after they've been added. Do we `:source` them? `:runtime` them? Do we need to dispatch any autocmds?\n. As discussed on IRC, not really. `.vimrc.before` is probably the way to go\n. You're correct in that it's no longer strictly necessary. I've updated that comment accordingly.\n. This was supposed to be a warning to stop using `pathogen#runtime_append_all_bundles()` in favor of `pathogen#infect()`. Thanks!\n. Thanks! I think I've screwed this up in every conceivable way.\n. Weird. Try each of\n\n```\ncall pathogen#infect('bundle/{}')\ncall pathogen#infect('bundle/*')\n```\n\nWhat do they do?\n. My guess is you named `.vim/bundle` incorrectly. There is no `s`.\n. Oh, I just noticed your `tree`. Check the value of `'runtimepath`' after each of those commands.\n. I don't know. Maybe you have something dumb in `'wildignore'`?\n. @CostaMichailidis have you tried the same debugging steps I outlined above?\n. Try\n\n```\n:echo glob(\"~/.vim/bundle/*\")\n```\n. Okay, hmm, try\n\n```\n:echo pathogen#glob_directories(\"~/.vim/bundle/*\")\n```\n. Possible, but an unlikely culprit. Check your runtime path with this in your vimrc:\n\n```\ncall pathogen#incubate(\"bundle/{}\")\n```\n. Ding ding ding! Yes, fish will give you all sorts of issues with Vim due to it eschewing Bourne compatibility, and thus is best avoided.\n\nOne of the things Vim uses the shell for is some of the the more complicated globbing.  In newer versions, this includes things like curly brackets.  Looks like you discovered that older versions shelled out for even globs including brackets. (Or negated brackets. I'm not sure what the trigger is.)\n\nWe're already filtering out `~` directories another way, so this glob can be simplified, thus solving the issue.\n\nI'm going to assume this was the root cause for all parties involved.  Please reopen if you're still having issues.\n. Globbing does expand environment variables so that should work. I use it in my own setup.\n. Oh, huh, that's surprising but not _that_ surprising. Does `expand('$DOTFILES')` work as expected on Windows? If so we can leverage that to make it work consistently across platforms.\n. Alright, just to be 100% clear, what does `:echo glob('$DOTFILES')` report?\n. Oh, then that my refutes my hypothesis of what was going wrong. Can you clarify \"\"`$DOTFILES` wasn't getting expanded in Windows\", keeping in mind that `pathogen#expand()` _does not_ expand environment variables?\n. Can you try `call pathogen#surround(\"$DOTFILES/vim/bundle/{}\")` in your vimrc and see if that fails the same way?\n. Okay, one last thing (hopefully). Can you try with a `~/something/{}` path and see if the `~` is correctly expanded to your home directory?\n. Finally dug in on Windows myself. @edbrannin, can you confirm the latest fixes it?\n. Does dropping `-s` and `-S` give an error? I don't want to drop SSL verification just to support people with a broken curl.\n. You're on the right track. Add a `runtime! autoload/pathogen.vim` at the top.\n. Do it in the respective `after/` file (e.g. `after/plugin/fugitive.vim`). Or use a `VimEnter` autocommand.\n. Welp, I answered over there.\n. See #53.  This is a Vim bug. Try upgrading to [7.3.430](http://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/patches/7.3/7.3.430) or higher, or try disabling bundles till you find the one that triggers it.\n. Not what I would have expected, but I don't doubt it. If you can't upgrade Vim, you can use a lower level function like `pathogen#incubate()` or `pathogen#surround()`.\n. Note that those lower level functions won't trigger reloading any `ftdetect` files inside your bundles.\n. Should be fixed.\n. Maybe mention the error?\n. `~/.vim/doc` should be empty, but you should find files like `~/.vim/bundle/command-t/doc/tags`\n. Let the record show this is completely unrelated to the original issue.\n\nYou can try removing this [`silent!`](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen/blob/91e6378908721d20514bbe5d18d292a0a15faf0c/autoload/pathogen.vim#L148) and see if an error shows up.\n. `v:exception` is kind of gross looking. I'm going to try silencing all failures and see if that's any better.\n. You don't have pathogen installed correctly. Check the README.\n. Pretty much. If you like how vundle works you should use vundle. I have some ideas about how a \"real\" package manager should work, and if I ever chose to execute on them, they will probably (but not definitely) go into another plugin.\n. Actually the latest returns an empty string. I have some ideas for how to leverage an `:execute` in the future.\n. The ordering isn't strict, but you definitely still want `filetype plugin indent on` in your vimrc. Pathogen only touches this stuff if it was already turned on.\n. Set `g:pathogen_disabled` to a list of bundle names.\n. Thanks\n. Right, it makes for a slightly cleaner history. Not something I'd normally bother with, but someone else added it and it seems pretty benign.\n. Is this a really old version of Vim?\n. Yep, that's nearly a decade old, and not supported.\n. `-u NONE` indeed.\n. Be sure to keep Windows support in mind.\n. Pathogen seems an unlikely culprit. Are you sure you have this problem even with no other plugins installed?\n. You could try changing :execute to :call but that's really a shot in the\ndark.\n\nOn Fri, Jul 26, 2013 at 2:38 AM, Andreas Mischke\nnotifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> I emptied the /bundles directory (~/.vim/bundles) and the problem still\n> occurs.\n> When I comment out the line execute pathogen#infect() in .vimrc, the\n> problem is solved.\n> \n> If it helps, here my .vimrc: http://pastebin.com/qKg8b197\n> \n> I should mention that I am a fairly n00b to vim and bash...\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen/issues/102#issuecomment-21604003\n> .\n. So a few other things to try:\n- Check `:set rtp?` with no plugins installed, and make sure pathogen hasn't found plugins where you don't expect.\n- Try `call pathogen#infect('bundle/*')`. This will add `*` paths directly to the runtime path, which mostly works the same, but short circuits some of the machinery in pathogen.vim (i.e., less to go wrong).\n. Oh, and regarding the \"more recent change\" part, if you could find a commit where this started happening, that would make it super easy to track down the problem.\n. Good detective work. If anyone else could confirm, that would be great.\n\nOne thing that might be good to rule out is `pathogen#cycle_filetype()`, which is called by `pathogen#infect()`. You can skip it by directly calling `pathogen#incubate()` instead.\n. I think the next logical step is to bisect `$VIMRUNTIME/filetype.vim` and find out what the real culprit is. Start by emptying it and seeing if the problem persists.\n\nBuffer events make no sense for an event that's supposed to happen on startup.\n. The event you're looking for is `VimEnter`, but I'd rather not resort to that as I want reloading the vimrc to retrigger filetype cycling, plus it's unclear to me that filetype cycling _after_ loading all the user's autocmds won't cause trouble.\n\nLooking at the Vim source, `ftdetect.vim` plus optionally `ftplugin.vim` and `indent.vim` are run on `filetype on`, and `ftoff.vim` plus optionally `ftplugof.vim` and `indoff.vim` are run on `filetype off`. The optional ones are contingent on which features are enabled: check the output of a bare `:filetype`. As I read it, those 6 files are the only possible effects of the two commands, so emptying all 6 should give pretty conclusive results of if we're on the right track. (But note it's possible to have multiples of any of these files, so check `:scriptnames` to make sure you got them all.)\n. BTW now that we know the cause, a workaround to skip the filetype cycling `call pathogen#incubate()`.\n. If you really want to get to the bottom if it, you'll need to tear apart pathogen.vim itself and try to figure out what line causes the issue.. Official interface is `execute pathogen#infect()`. The idea was that a future version might return VimL to be executed in the context of one's vimrc. I'll think further on allowing this for `pathogen#incubate()` and the like but `pathogen#infect()` is off the table.\n. Are you using fish shell?\n. I think `~/vim/bundle/.{}` should work, but I haven't tested.\n. This should be fixed.\n. I can't dig into this now, but I think you're correct in blaming `pathogen#join()`. A tweak to the escape in the innermost `while` is probably all that's needed.\n\nTake a stab yourself, or post back _both_ `:set runtimepath?` and `:echo &runtimepath` _without_ pathogen, and I might have a look at some point in the future.\n. It's in an issue tracker, but you already knew that. And yes, I asked for those values because they would be helpful.\n. I don't see any UNC paths in there. Is this even the same issue?\n\nOn Fri, May 30, 2014 at 5:03 AM, padraic notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> :set runtimepath?\n> runtimepath=X:\\vimfiles,X:\\vimfiles\\bundle\\vim-kolor,C:\\Program Files\n> (x86)\\Vim/vimfiles,C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Vim\\vim74,C:\\Program Files\n> (x86)\\Vim/vimfiles/after,X:\\vimfiles/after\n> \n> echo &runtimepath _without pathogen_\n> X:\\vimfiles,C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Vim/vimfiles,C:\\Program Files\n> (x86)\\Vim\\vim74,C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Vim/vimfiles/after,X:\\vimfiles/after\n> \n> Apologies for the earlier density.

So no, not the same issue. Please open a new issue with your actual symptoms.\n. Yeah you can call it no problem, but note that plugins have already loaded at that point. `:runtime plugin/**/*.vim` will reinitiate that; plugins may vary on how well this is supported.\n\nI don't see any good coming from creating an incompatible pathogen fork.\n. What does `:set rtp?` report back?`\n. Looks okay to me. You only need the first of the two pathogen calls. You're sure surround.vim and nerdtree aren't loaded?\n. Two things to try independently:\n1. Remove vundle\n2. Change to `execute pathogen#infect('~/.vim/bundle/{}')`\n. Clarify how you're installing nerdtree.\n. Really not sure what's going on. Check `:scriptnames` and see if nerdtree is in there.\n. I just noticed that there's no `~/.vimrc` in that output. Instead there's a `~/.vim/.vimrc` which is loaded _after_ all the plugins are, meaning it's too late to activate pathogen.\n. Going to take that as the root cause. I'm not sure _why_ it loads that in that particular order, but that's a question the Vim source could answer.\n. Wrong repo, buddy.\n. Check `:set compatible?` and `:set loadplugins?` and make sure they're correct.\n. Dunno what to say. The only thing pathogen does is change `'runtimepath'`, and it sounds like it succeeded at that. I'd speculate that the Vim shipped with Arch is super stripped down, but then I wouldn't expect pathogen to work at all.\n. @royaldark One other cause could be that you called pathogen after plugins have started loading, which is too late to add additional plugins to load. Check :scriptnames and make sure pathogen appears before any other plugins.\n. Unfortunate, but I'm not sure what to do about it. How do these users not notice their config is broken?\n. Yep. In particular, I want to make it possible for pathogen to return `finish` in some cases (most likely triggered by an environment variable) so that you can disable your vimrc but keep your plugins enabled, which can be very useful when debugging.\n. Looks like you meant to open this against Command-T instead?\n. I can reproduce, and also get weird error dumps if I poke at it. No idea what the root cause is but it's easy enough to work around.\n. 7.0.305 was my test case, for future reference.\n. Are you using the latest from GitHub? The workaround has not made it into a stable release.\n. Yes, please do send a patch.\n. Added a `-L` to follow the redirect. Thanks for the heads up.\n. This pushes it over the 80 character mark, so I'm not changing it till I have to.\n. Not yet. It's a little unclear how that would interact with built-in plugins.\n. So fugitive, for example, will work just fine without Git, up till the point you explicitly invoke a command. I think plugins that don't are broken, generally speaking. My strategy for dealing with these \"broken\" plugins is to install them ad hoc on a per machine basis, and limit my shared config to safe plugins.\n\nThat said, I think the approach I assume you want (put everything you could conceivably want in submodules and then conditionally load them) is valid. I'm just not sure it's a great fit for pathogen. I think if I ever decided to pursue it, it would be in a different plugin entirely.\n. Since Pathogen doesn't handle installation, this would force the user to both install by hand and update their vimrc on install, and do the reverse on uninstall. That's a ridiculous amount of effort plus opens up 4 different edge cases if they forget a step.\n. You can call `pathogen#interpose('bundle/YouCompleteMe')` to add a single bundle to the runtime path. Is that what you're really after?\n. Wrap the commit message body to 72 characters as indicated in the contribution guidelines.\n. Oh, and present tense.\n. The `$VIMRUNTIME` dir is for files that ships with Vim. You probably want to put files in `$VIM/vimfiles` instead.\n. Pushed\n. `-L` follows redirects. What's the problem?\n. This has nothing to do with pathogen, just with some plugin it's loading.\n. Are you using the exact curl command given? `-L` should follow the redirect.\n. Dupe of #128 at any rate.\n. With `.vimrc` in `$VIMBLACKLIST`, `pathogen#infect()` returns `finish`, which when given to `:execute` handily short circuits the rest of the vimrc (occasionally useful when debugging). There should be no other difference.\n\nFirst step to debugging would be to check `:scriptnames` for any discrepancies between the two setups.\n. Looks good.\n. Check `:scriptnames` to find out when `ftdetect/markdown.vim` is loaded. The whole point of this function is to fix the exact problem you describe, so something else is whack.\n. Major red flag in `ftdetect/mkd.vim`, suggesting you installed a completely different markdown plugin than the one you posted on.\n. Cloned into `.vim/bundle` like any other plugin.\n. That conditional is only true after pathogen has loaded. You can explicitly load with `runtime! autoload/pathogen.vim`.\n. \"Infect\" needs to happen on Vim startup. Helptags generation needs to happen on installation. So I think it's quite inappropriate to add that to your vimrc. Instead, it should be handled as part of the install/update process, which is outside the scope of Pathogen.\n\nFor the de facto installation method of cloning a Git repository, it's possible to automate this with Git hooks, but since that's nontrivial to set up, I also provide `:Helptags` (and the semi-deprecated `pathogen#helptags()`) for interactive usage.\n. If it's even failing on the GitHub URL, that sounds like a problem on your end. Are there any https URLs you can successfully retrieve.\n. I'm thinking this should wait for 3.0.\n. It's your vimrc's job to load pathogen.vim so the ordering is correct. Confirm how you're invoking pathogen and the directory structure of your Vim directory.\n. Find the plugin echoing it. It's not pathogen.\n. I was waiting until 3.0 on the grounds that this is a breaking change (albeit interactive only so not sure it matters). I don't understand how it could break tab completion.\n. Tab completion is case sensitive and I don't know of a way to change that.\n. lol wow is there anything that option _doesn't_ affect?\n. Not keen on officially endorsing a kludge like this. As you yourself noted, it doesn't even work for one of your three examples.\n\nThe \"trailing `{}`\" clause is obsolete. I'll remove it.\n. You can maybe start vim as `vim -V99` to see a dump of everything that's happening on startup, in order to narrow down the precise trigger. Other than that, you can try installing a slightly different vim version, as the problem is likely a bug in your particular patch level.\n. When you give Pathogen an absolute path, it has no way to know where you want it inserted. Give it something runtime relative like `.bundle/{}` and it will nest it like you desire.\n. Check `:set runtimepath?` before that and make sure it includes `/Users/me/.vim`.\n. With Vim running, can you report the output of\n\n```\n:echo pathogen#infect()\n```\n. What's the first 5 lines of `:version`?\n. Wait, why do those errors say `bash`? Those aren't vim errors at all.\n. Don't `source ~/.vimrc` in bash.\n. Do your installed plugins work?\n. Yeah the instructions say vimrc. I don't really want to muddle them with things _not_ to do.\n. I am thinking it might make more sense to accept a `*` wildcard in the existing blacklist options rather than add yet another. Would that still solve your problem?\n. `Helptags` should be called at installation time, not startup time. I deliberately omitted it from `pathogen#infect()` for that reason.\n. After each plugin installation. Ideally whatever you use to install Vim plugins would generate help tags automatically, but since `git clone` is the de facto install tool I provide `:Helptags` to ease that pain a bit.  I could see adding a FAQ entry for this.\n. If you upgrade a plugin you will need to rerun `:Helptags` to get full coverage for any doc changes.\n. You can give `infect` multiple arguments. Does that take care of everything?\n. The truncation is a function of `:set` output. See `:echo &rtp`.\n. Fixed, thanks.\n. Fixed, thanks. I used to point at the GitHub URL directly but I kept getting reports of failures I couldn't reproduce.\n. Thanks!\n. At this time I don't think the handful of use cases this would support justifies inventing a proprietary pathogen standard, no. If I ever did go down this road, I would just source a broad file glob (e.g., `runtime! preload/*.vim`), rather than dictate some weird autoload function convention. All your 6 line solution adds is more boilerplate and longer, more opaque error messages.\n. Yeah it absolutely has nothing to do with pathogen.\n. That file is already loaded by the system vimrc. You don't need it in your personal vimrc at all.\n. Needs to be wrapped to 80 chars\n. Yes that is the reason.. Dupe of #136\n. Check your `'runtimepath'` on each version and see if anything changed. You can get it into a buffer with `:call setline(1, pathogen#split(&rtp))`\n. Nevermind, I see what it is.\n. Presumably it was down but it's up now.\n. Check `:set runtimepath?`\n. Get rid of all that crap you copied from your system vimrc.\n. Yeah, it's in one of the plugins that Pathogen is loading.\n. I might add reloading some day, but it would take a lot more work than just ripping the corresponding development tools out of scriptease. If you want to leverage that functionality in the meantime, I recommend copy and paste.\n. - I don't use the triple backslash notation because it's nonstandard and looks weird if you're reading the README directly. I might cave on real code examples for the syntax highlighting, but I see extremely limited value in highlighting a `curl` command, for example.\n- I favor \"vimrc\" over `.vimrc` because on Windows the file is often named `_vimrc`. My terminology is closer to that used within Vim's own help.\n- Most of the other changes (in particular the comma fiddling) seem pretty arbitrary. Any you care to defend?\n. `/usr/share/vim/vimfiles` will work for most setups.\n. How are you getting a capitalized command completed from a lowercase input?\n. I brought them back because I was trying to be diligent about semver and save the removal for 3.0. But it's a dumb user facing feature with a clear migration path so fine, y'all win.. It's actually been on my todo list to replace all my URLs with a hosting agnostic redirect. Something like\n\n```\ngit clone https://tpope.io/vim/sensible.git\n```\n. Thanks, fixed.. Was doing some server maintenance. Should be back up.. I don't know where you got `~/.config/vim` from. If you're running Neovim, it should be `~/.config/nvim`.. You're cloning a directory to a filename.. In Neovim you need to install in `~/.config/nvim` instead (or add `~/.vim` to your runtime path).. Yep!. Sessions load after plugins are already active, so changing `'runtimepath'` in one will have no effect on what plugins are loaded.. Wrong repo.. I've settled on adding a README instead. I don't want to complicate installation with a second file, seeing as how you can't use Pathogen to help you install Pathogen. ;)\n. You need to ensure pathogen is invoked before `filetype plugin indent on`. And on Debian based distributions and others that enable it automatically, you need to do `filetype off` first.\n\nThere's not much I can do about this but it does need to be better documented.\n. I'm as baffled now as I was a year ago, but I've refactored to remove that disabling logic from the glob, hopefully rendering the issue moot. Let me know if it's still an issue.\n. Accepted, thanks.\n. The vim-git-branch-info repository doesn't place its plugin file in the `plugin/` directory; thus adding it to the load path doesn't cause the plugin to load. There's not much I can do about that.\n. Yeah, rson's comment is spot on. What is `$VIM` set to on Windows? Based on your response, I'm guessing it's blank?\n. You know it's possible (and, I dare say, more correct) to install add-ons in `$HOME\\vimfiles`, right?\n. Vim's file system APIs are pretty horrendous. I guess I could `:silent!` the errors but I worry that might swallow something informative.\n. I have the same thing in my vimrc and I agree it's a pain. However, just turning it off in `pathogen#runtime_append_all_bundles()` is kind of invasive (and also not the only function that's affected). I tried and failed to create a smarter solution several months back.\n. Accepted, thanks.\n. Sigh, this is why I'm so reluctant to accept pull requests. Fixed.\n. I was actually bitching about the original pull request that broke things (which I left lingering for days before blindly accepting after further pestering).\n\nI generally recommend a feature request or bug report before a pull request because (1) it oftentimes would take me minutes and you hours, and (2) some bugs may be deliberate behavior, and some feature requests may be deliberate omissions.\n. This confused me until I realized it was already fixed in f4f79bc7205b6c101955f32985a4d1b1da0be556. A release is overdue.\n. You've got DOS line endings in your file. Redownload it.\n\nAnd invoking helptags doesn't make sense before the load path has been changed.\n. You seem to be operating under the errant assumption that runtime files can only go under `$VIM` or `$VIMRUNTIME`. Just put them in `$HOME\\vimfiles` and everything should work fine.\n. The real issue is that Vim offers no API to check if a directory is writable, and `$VIM` usually isn't. This takes precedence over someone storing user preferences in `Program Files` like it's 1995.  Having done my time on Windows, I can most definitely assure you that messy though `$HOME` may be, strewing user preferences across `Program Files` is infinitely less maintainable.\n\nThis is not to say I'm not interested in a solution that works for everyone, just that doing things the normal way takes precedence over the weird way.\n. It looks like Vim stores the value of `'runtimepath'` in `Session.vim`. You can prevent that with `:set sessionoptions-=options`, though that has the side effect of not persisting any global options, which may or may not be acceptable to you. Other than that, I'm afraid my hands are tied.\n. For me as well, but I can still clone from that URL, so I assume all is normal?\n. The section you quote mentions a vim.org url, not a github.com one. That should work.\n\nIf all else fails, drill into the repository and download pathogen.vim by hand.\n. Create your own custom excludes list and ignore tags there.\n\n```\ngit config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitexcludes'\necho tags > ~/.gitexcludes\n```\n\nWay easier than modifying every plugin out there.\n. Looks pretty good, although it won't work on Windows. See if the variant I pushed up works for you.\n. Merged, thanks.\n. Fair enough, I added a note on the vim.org download page. If I ever get around to adding a README, I'll add it there too.\n. The crux of this issue is\n1. Vim doesn't provide an API to tell if a directory is writable or not.\n2. If I try to help-tag a `$VIM` directory on UNIX, it pitches a fit because of permissions.\n3. Storing your personal config outside of `$HOME` in 2011 is archaic, to say the list.\n4. I prioritize people doing the right thing on UNIX about people doing the weird thing on Windows.\n\nI highly recommend moving your plugins to `$HOME\\vimfiles` on Windows.\n. I could have sworn I closely investigated `filewritable()` back when I first implemented this, but apparently not. That's all I needed to fix it. Thanks!\n\nI stand by my \"weird\" assertion. These \"portable\" apps are intended for like a USB flash drive, right? That's a legitimate use case I hadn't considered (though personally I'd still prefer my personal config files to be separate from application files, if only for ease of backing up). However, nobody who has raised this issue has mentioned anything but a `C:\\` path. Weird weird weird.\n. Bonus: now that this little inconsistency is cleared up, I feel confident claiming `:Helptags` as a `pathogen#helptags()` wrapper.\n. The underlying `:helptags` doesn't allow overriding a destination, so this is a non-starter. What I do is basically `git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.cvsignore'` and `echo tags >> ~/.cvsignore` (you can use any file you like, but `.cvsignore` is handily consulted by other tools like rsync).\n. I do something similar. My own plugins are all centralized, though, so I can handle them with a much cheaper\n\n```\ncall pathogen#runtime_prepend_subdirectories(\"~/src/vim/bundle\")\n```\n\nMy guess is you have a similar setup (with `~/.vim/plugins`). If so, you could try that and see if it improves performance.\n\nI _could_ add a loop if you really need it. But less code is better in my book.\n. By doesn't work, do you mean not at all, or just that it regresses to being slow?\n. Looks like I tried to reproduce this months ago and failed, but forgot to post back to the issue. I just made a fresh attempt to reproduce it and I still can't.  Note the Git version isn't distributed with a help file either; instead, it does some weird self mutilation to generate one (check `git status` in the repository after invoking Vim), and I'm guessing that's somehow to blame.  You can try to narrow it down by killing the showmarks `tags` file and seeing if the issue persists.  Other than that I'm tempted to pin the blame on showmarks and move on.\n. I can pretty much guarantee you that load order isn't the issue, as I'm using the same setup, and rails.vim doesn't check for surround.vim until long after all plugins have loaded. Here's the relevant code from rails.vim:\n\nhttps://github.com/tpope/vim-rails/blob/1bd7f2b8dc57f8e9e48d714a4b32218a0c67d53b/autoload/rails.vim#L4620-4642\n\nYou should try `:echo b:surround_45` to see if it's successfully configured. If not, I'd try adding a bunch of `:echomsg \"foo\"`s all up and down that snippet of code and see if you can tell which conditional takes a wrong turn.\n. I've seen that done to support certain snippet plugins before. Seems kind of pointless to me, but it's pretty easy to support.\n. Hi Seth, this is some good stuff. To address your specific points:\n1. Even I can't remember the name of `pathogen#runtime_append_all_bundles()`. It took me a little too long to recognize the parallel between \"infect\" and \"pathogen\", but now that I do, I like it.\n2. `:Helptags` is a very recent addition. I hope some prominent documentation will take most of the pain away. That said, I'm not a big fan of forcing it each startup, and for better or worse, I'd rather stick with the Vim practice of making the user ultimately responsible for it. If users want to do that by putting it in their vimrc, that's okay.\n3. Dude, I spent a few hours on a rathole of trying to parse the output of `:filetype` so that I could do exactly this (it mostly worked). It never occurred to me to check for a global variable.\n\nIf you could make the following tiny changes, I'll be quite happy to merge:\n- Drop the `l:` prefixes.\n- Use separate lines rather than `|`. VimL is pretty damn hard to read as it is.\n- Ditch the `pathogen#helptags()` call. I _might_ allow it at some future juncture.\n- Squash into the same commit and capitalize the commit message.\n\nThanks!\n. Sweet! Automatic `pathogen#helptags()` invocation is off the table until after the next release, which should hopefully happen within a week if I don't get too distracted. I want to draft a slick README to go with it.\n. Yeah, I can't reproduce either, so I'm killing it.\n. Yep, that's a recently added function that I need to cut a release for. It should hopefully clear up most of the confusion around this.\n. No can do, partner. Vim's `:helptags` takes a path to a directory, and that's it.\n\nSee the install instructions on [the vim.org page](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332) for how to add `tags` to the global Git excludes list.\n\nBy the way, I recently added (but not yet documented) `:Helptags` for easier invocation.\n. Please [fix the commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html) and I'll merge it in. Thanks!\n. Yep, thanks!\n. Is there anything in `~/.vim/doc`? If it's just a tags file, you may need to remove it.\n. I see you've already taken initiative in making this standalone, so I am closing the pull request.  For my part, I've added a README that takes a middle ground between completely automating the install and leaving the user to figure it out himself. :)\n. That's the new interface. It hasn't been cut into a release yet, but it will be soon.\n. Happy to merge, but was this actually breaking helptags on Windows? Surprised this is the first I've heard of it.\n. I just booted up my Windows VM and verified it does indeed generate tags on it. Were you getting an error, or just silent failure? You do _not_ have `'shellslash'` set, correct?\n. `'shellslash'` is mainly used with setups like Cygwin. I don't have it set either (but it can be relevant so I thought I'd ask).\n\nI was looking for an error on `:call pathogen#helptags()` or `:Helptags`, not the actual `:help` invocation.\n\nI've gone ahead and merged in your changes, but I'd still like to isolate the cause, so that I can determine the priority of cutting a new release. If I can't find anything, I'm going to assume it's something really weird in your setup, and hold off on a release.\n. Obvious perhaps, but completely untrue. `:echo isdirectory('C:/Windows')` returns 1 (true). `:e ~/_vimrc` correctly edits the file. The only reason I bother with backslashes at all is so `'runtimepath'` isn't an ugly mixture of the two. Something is broken on your machine. You can start investigating by running those two commands and seeing if they work for you.\n. `:echo` not `:call`\n. Ergh, I've reused this boilerplate in multiple repositories.\n\nThanks!\n. Where does `:verbose set filetype?` report that the option was set?\n. If you take out the call to pathogen but replace it with:\n\n```\nfiletype off\nfiletype on\n```\n\nWhat happens?\n. Okay, well therein lies the problem. If you're invoking pathogen after you've enabled filetypes, you can try moving the call to pathogen up and that should fix it.  If it's your Vim distribution doing it, however, you may have little choice but to invoke a workaround:\n\n```\nautocmd BufNewFile,BufRead *.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG set ft=gitcommit\n```\n\nAre you using a Linux distro's provided Vim? What distro?\n. For the record, I just tried that locally, and it didn't break file type detection for me. In fact, Debian does something similar (`:filetype on`) and I've never had an issue with that. I'm guessing something more nuanced is going on.\n\nI'd be interested to see if a second Gentoo user could reproduce this.\n. @wokka has reproduced this as well, this time on Ubuntu.\n. So `:syntax on` is the trigger, eh? That might give us some options.  Tell me, all of you affected, if you add `syntax on` to your vimrc after calling pathogen, does it fix the issue?\n. Well toggling the filetype off and on enables ftdetect files in bundles to be loaded.  That's the reason for infect.\n\nDebian does not have `syntax on`.  With that clue, I imagine I can figure something out.  I just need some time to dig in.\n. Interesting point. I'll add it.\n\nBTW, this is how I used to sidestep that problem on Windows:\n\n```\nif has(\"win32\")\n  let &runtimepath =\n        \\ substitute(&runtimepath,'Documents and Settings[\\\\/][^\\\\/,]*[\\\\/]\\zsvimfiles\\>','.vim','g')\nendif\n```\n. Looks to be the same as #38. If you take out the call to pathogen and put the following instead, does it still break?\n\n```\nfiletype off\nfiletype on\n```\n. Well there's your workaround. Are you on Gentoo as well?\n. Conf highlighting is a weird special case:  It's the last check in filetype.vim and looks for `#` comments near the top of the file. That doesn't explain much, though.\n\nI'm guessing you're just not looking hard enough for that `filetype on`.  Debian, for instance, used to have it in debian.vim (but it seems to have been removed). Maybe `:grep '^ *filetype.*on' $VIM/**/*.vim /etc/vim`.\n\nI'm closing this as a dupe of #38.  Additional information should be posted there.\n. My guess is the real problem is that you're trying to use fugitive.vim outside of a Git repository. There's no conceivable way for plugin loading to be deferred until after `:Vedit` is invoked.\n. Hi Daniel,\n\nIs there some advantage to `; \\` chaining I'm missing? Both seem equally copy-and-pastable to me.\n. Eh, an iffy argument, but I'll accept it.  Please squash those two commits into one and I'll merge it in.\n. Thanks.\n. Thanks. I fixed your commit message this time; please use a real one in the future.\n. This is as intended. Fugitive merely preps the runtime path so that Vim is aware of your bundles during plugin load time.  As far as `fugitive#statusline()` goes, if you add it to `'statusline'`, the plugin will be loaded before the function is invoked.\n. ```\n:help fugitive-statusline\n```\n. It works fine in your vimrc. Copy the `set` line exactly from the help.\n. Works fine for me.\n. @jmcaffee, that solution causes every single directory inside every single bundle to be added, surely not what you had in mind.\n\nAs a first step, can you post the output of `:set runtimepath?` when pathogen is _not_ activated?\n. I don't think there's a limit on length, just `:set` output length. Try `:echo &runtimepath` rather than `:set runtimepath?`\n\nThat's a weird mixture of `\\` and `/` in your runtimepath, but it should work fine.\n. Then what did you mean by a \"limit on the length of the runtimepath\"?\n. It does look deeper once it hits the after directories in `'runtimepath'`. That is, it adds `~/vimfiles/bundle/*` when it hits `~/vimfiles` and adds `~/vimfiles/bundle/*/after` when it hits `~/vimfiles/after`.\n. Not sure I follow. When I `:set rtp?`, I see paths with `~`. But when I `:echo &rtp`, they're already expanded.\n\nAlso, that count thing sounds like a separate pull request.\n. Can you see if `simplify()` or `resolve()` fixes it? Those feel more appropriate.\n. Fair enough. Can you squash it into one commit?\n. Thanks. I fixed the commit message to be [conventional](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html); please do this in the future.\n. Okay, so I like this feature and want to keep it, although you wouldn't know that by looking because it's apparently broken. Easy to fix, though.\n\nAs for the issue at hand, it looks like it can be fixed without dropping the feature by using -range=1 instead. Right? I've pushed it up if you want to check for further issues with it.\n. What is the output of `:set cp?`. Pathogen does not work in compatibility mode.\n. Literally the only thing that can cause this is installing Pathogen in the wrong place, or not at all.\n. Indeed. Automatically generating helptags is kind of \"un-Vim-like\", and you won't catch me doing it, but the downsides are minimal.\n. Can you paste the output of `:echo &runtimepath`? Sounds like the `after/` path is getting added but the root path is not.\n. See #38. I've been putting off revisiting it.\n. There's a fix in Vim now. http://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/patches/7.3/7.3.430\n. I've wanted something like this for a while. Two big caveats:\n1. Calling `pathogen#infect()` a second time results in scanning not just the original runtime path, but also inside any bundles that were added the previous go around. With a lot of bundles, this is noticeably slow. Plus the path ends up in a weird order.\n2. If Vim has already loaded, we need to manually activate plugins and filetype detection. This is not necessarily unfeasible, but I'm guessing there are edge cases hiding in there (things like #38).\n. Thanks.\n. I don't understand how this would help. Are you trying to make `.vim` itself a submodule?\n. Sounds janky as hell, and would just confuse people. I'm gonna pass. Note that as the docs explain, there are other ways to make pathogen a submodule.\n. Try\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/jelera/vim-gummybears-colorscheme ~/.vim/bundle/vim-gummybears-colorscheme\n```\n. Yes, the root of each set of runtime files must sit in `bundle`.\n. Looks like it, but then again pathogen never shells out so I don't know why it would cause this. What makes you think pathogen is to blame?\n. If there's no backtrace, there's not much for me to work with here. What happens if you don't call `pathogen#infect()` but still load the file with `:source ~/.vim/autoload/pathogen.vim`?\n. Looks like `glob()` requires shelling out. In which case I'm afraid there's not much that can be done.\n. One thing you could try is `set shell=/bin/bash` early in your vimrc.\n. It should work fine. What makes you think it failed to load? Is it in `:set runtimepath?`?\n\n/cc @sjl\n. Well it used to work :/. Thanks for bringing it to my attention.\n. Yes, I was going to say this is well tread territory. Can you try grabbing pathogen.vim out of each of commits that supposedly fixed each respective issue and see which of them are functional?\n. As a curiosity, here's how I solved the same problem. It makes some assumptions about the directory structure, but so far they've always held true:\n\n```\nif has(\"win32\")\n  let &runtimepath = substitute(&runtimepath,'\\(Documents and Settings\\|Users\\)[\\\\/][^\\\\/,]*[\\\\/]\\zsvimfiles\\>','.vim','g')\nendif\n```\n. According to `:help 'rtp` the default is based on `$HOME`. Are there cases where `$HOME` isn't set? I'm debating adding a function for this to pathogen proper.\n\n`expand('~')` is probably the right solution actually. Should work on any platform.\n. If it were me, I'd kill the `runtime!` invocation (Vim does that automatically) and  move the post-config chunk to `.vim/after/plugin/csapprox.vim` (or whatever the corresponding filename is). Don't think too much about the `after` in the path; it will load regardless of whether the original plugin loaded.\n\nI don't think there's much that can be done about the pre-config chunk. I just have a section in my vimrc for plugin settings.\n. I just do `silent! call pathogen#infect()`. But that takes away the ability to conditionally load `bundle_config.vim`, if you care about that sort of thing.\n. Just took a quick peak at the implementation and I'm inclined to agree. It's actually hard coded to assume it's installed in the first directory in runtime path.\n\nMight I recommend https://github.com/kien/rainbow_parentheses.vim?\n. What's the use case for dot prefixed bundles?  All these `glob()` calls add up, unfortunately.\n. It's a trade-off. Automatic help tag generation means hiding or spamming errors on startup, and potentially a slower load time.  Whenever there's no clear right answer, I do what Vim does. And Vim does not generate help tags automatically.\n\n`:Helptags` is in the README. Perhaps it needs to be more prominent.\n. Yep. Note that particular file is already included with Vim (`:edit $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/spec.vim`), so in this case you didn't really need to do anything at all. :)\n. Sorry for letting this hang. Docs are now in scriptease.vim.\n. Let's start with pinning down your use case. Are these `after/` files you're trying to edit? I usually get to those with `:Vopen after/...`. Other than that, I almost never need a count, so I'm curious why you do.\n\nAdding`:Vopenall` would turn `:Vo` into an ambiguous command, so I don't think I'll go that route. I like the `0` idea.\n. I've extracted the `:Vopen` command to [scriptease.vim](/tpope/vim-scriptease), and in the process, added support for loading all matches into the location list. Try it out, and feel free to open a new scriptease.vim issue if you have any ideas for improvements.\n. Does `:Vopen ftp\\git<Tab>` work as expected? If so, it should be a simple fix.\n. I took a blind stab at it. Let me know if it doesn't work.\n. This happens on firing of `git commit`, but not when running `vim`?\n. Sounds like Git is invoking Vim weird, maybe? Check `ps aux` while it's running and see if you can find exactly how vim was invoked.\n. You screwed up the copy and paste.\n. I've done something similar (use `~\\.vim` rather than `~\\vimfiles` on Windows) and it works fine. Please clarify \"does not work.\"\n.

Autoload is deferred until you call a function defined in a namespace matching the filename.  For example, calling `foo#bar()` would cause `autoload/foo.vim` to be loaded.\n\nIn the case of togglebg, there's some function you have to call to activate it. Check the docs.\n. Probably possible, but super tricky. The first challenge is to add it to the runtime path. What position does it belong in? The OCD part of me wants to inject it into the exact spot it would have appeared if it had been loaded with Vim. But I guess we could get by with something more predictable.\n\nThe harder part is actually loading plugins after they've been added. Do we `:source` them? `:runtime` them? Do we need to dispatch any autocmds?\n. As discussed on IRC, not really. `.vimrc.before` is probably the way to go\n. You're correct in that it's no longer strictly necessary. I've updated that comment accordingly.\n. This was supposed to be a warning to stop using `pathogen#runtime_append_all_bundles()` in favor of `pathogen#infect()`. Thanks!\n. Thanks! I think I've screwed this up in every conceivable way.\n. Weird. Try each of\n\n```\ncall pathogen#infect('bundle/{}')\ncall pathogen#infect('bundle/*')\n```\n\nWhat do they do?\n. My guess is you named `.vim/bundle` incorrectly. There is no `s`.\n. Oh, I just noticed your `tree`. Check the value of `'runtimepath`' after each of those commands.\n. I don't know. Maybe you have something dumb in `'wildignore'`?\n. @CostaMichailidis have you tried the same debugging steps I outlined above?\n. Try\n\n```\n:echo glob(\"~/.vim/bundle/*\")\n```\n. Okay, hmm, try\n\n```\n:echo pathogen#glob_directories(\"~/.vim/bundle/*\")\n```\n. Possible, but an unlikely culprit. Check your runtime path with this in your vimrc:\n\n```\ncall pathogen#incubate(\"bundle/{}\")\n```\n. Ding ding ding! Yes, fish will give you all sorts of issues with Vim due to it eschewing Bourne compatibility, and thus is best avoided.\n\nOne of the things Vim uses the shell for is some of the the more complicated globbing.  In newer versions, this includes things like curly brackets.  Looks like you discovered that older versions shelled out for even globs including brackets. (Or negated brackets. I'm not sure what the trigger is.)\n\nWe're already filtering out `~` directories another way, so this glob can be simplified, thus solving the issue.\n\nI'm going to assume this was the root cause for all parties involved.  Please reopen if you're still having issues.\n. Globbing does expand environment variables so that should work. I use it in my own setup.\n. Oh, huh, that's surprising but not _that_ surprising. Does `expand('$DOTFILES')` work as expected on Windows? If so we can leverage that to make it work consistently across platforms.\n. Alright, just to be 100% clear, what does `:echo glob('$DOTFILES')` report?\n. Oh, then that my refutes my hypothesis of what was going wrong. Can you clarify \"\"`$DOTFILES` wasn't getting expanded in Windows\", keeping in mind that `pathogen#expand()` _does not_ expand environment variables?\n. Can you try `call pathogen#surround(\"$DOTFILES/vim/bundle/{}\")` in your vimrc and see if that fails the same way?\n. Okay, one last thing (hopefully). Can you try with a `~/something/{}` path and see if the `~` is correctly expanded to your home directory?\n. Finally dug in on Windows myself. @edbrannin, can you confirm the latest fixes it?\n. Does dropping `-s` and `-S` give an error? I don't want to drop SSL verification just to support people with a broken curl.\n. You're on the right track. Add a `runtime! autoload/pathogen.vim` at the top.\n. Do it in the respective `after/` file (e.g. `after/plugin/fugitive.vim`). Or use a `VimEnter` autocommand.\n. Welp, I answered over there.\n. See #53.  This is a Vim bug. Try upgrading to [7.3.430](http://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/patches/7.3/7.3.430) or higher, or try disabling bundles till you find the one that triggers it.\n. Not what I would have expected, but I don't doubt it. If you can't upgrade Vim, you can use a lower level function like `pathogen#incubate()` or `pathogen#surround()`.\n. Note that those lower level functions won't trigger reloading any `ftdetect` files inside your bundles.\n. Should be fixed.\n. Maybe mention the error?\n. `~/.vim/doc` should be empty, but you should find files like `~/.vim/bundle/command-t/doc/tags`\n. Let the record show this is completely unrelated to the original issue.\n\nYou can try removing this [`silent!`](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen/blob/91e6378908721d20514bbe5d18d292a0a15faf0c/autoload/pathogen.vim#L148) and see if an error shows up.\n. `v:exception` is kind of gross looking. I'm going to try silencing all failures and see if that's any better.\n. You don't have pathogen installed correctly. Check the README.\n. Pretty much. If you like how vundle works you should use vundle. I have some ideas about how a \"real\" package manager should work, and if I ever chose to execute on them, they will probably (but not definitely) go into another plugin.\n. Actually the latest returns an empty string. I have some ideas for how to leverage an `:execute` in the future.\n. The ordering isn't strict, but you definitely still want `filetype plugin indent on` in your vimrc. Pathogen only touches this stuff if it was already turned on.\n. Set `g:pathogen_disabled` to a list of bundle names.\n. Thanks\n. Right, it makes for a slightly cleaner history. Not something I'd normally bother with, but someone else added it and it seems pretty benign.\n. Is this a really old version of Vim?\n. Yep, that's nearly a decade old, and not supported.\n. `-u NONE` indeed.\n. Be sure to keep Windows support in mind.\n. Pathogen seems an unlikely culprit. Are you sure you have this problem even with no other plugins installed?\n. You could try changing :execute to :call but that's really a shot in the\ndark.\n\nOn Fri, Jul 26, 2013 at 2:38 AM, Andreas Mischke\nnotifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> I emptied the /bundles directory (~/.vim/bundles) and the problem still\n> occurs.\n> When I comment out the line execute pathogen#infect() in .vimrc, the\n> problem is solved.\n> \n> If it helps, here my .vimrc: http://pastebin.com/qKg8b197\n> \n> I should mention that I am a fairly n00b to vim and bash...\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen/issues/102#issuecomment-21604003\n> .\n. So a few other things to try:\n- Check `:set rtp?` with no plugins installed, and make sure pathogen hasn't found plugins where you don't expect.\n- Try `call pathogen#infect('bundle/*')`. This will add `*` paths directly to the runtime path, which mostly works the same, but short circuits some of the machinery in pathogen.vim (i.e., less to go wrong).\n. Oh, and regarding the \"more recent change\" part, if you could find a commit where this started happening, that would make it super easy to track down the problem.\n. Good detective work. If anyone else could confirm, that would be great.\n\nOne thing that might be good to rule out is `pathogen#cycle_filetype()`, which is called by `pathogen#infect()`. You can skip it by directly calling `pathogen#incubate()` instead.\n. I think the next logical step is to bisect `$VIMRUNTIME/filetype.vim` and find out what the real culprit is. Start by emptying it and seeing if the problem persists.\n\nBuffer events make no sense for an event that's supposed to happen on startup.\n. The event you're looking for is `VimEnter`, but I'd rather not resort to that as I want reloading the vimrc to retrigger filetype cycling, plus it's unclear to me that filetype cycling _after_ loading all the user's autocmds won't cause trouble.\n\nLooking at the Vim source, `ftdetect.vim` plus optionally `ftplugin.vim` and `indent.vim` are run on `filetype on`, and `ftoff.vim` plus optionally `ftplugof.vim` and `indoff.vim` are run on `filetype off`. The optional ones are contingent on which features are enabled: check the output of a bare `:filetype`. As I read it, those 6 files are the only possible effects of the two commands, so emptying all 6 should give pretty conclusive results of if we're on the right track. (But note it's possible to have multiples of any of these files, so check `:scriptnames` to make sure you got them all.)\n. BTW now that we know the cause, a workaround to skip the filetype cycling `call pathogen#incubate()`.\n. If you really want to get to the bottom if it, you'll need to tear apart pathogen.vim itself and try to figure out what line causes the issue.. Official interface is `execute pathogen#infect()`. The idea was that a future version might return VimL to be executed in the context of one's vimrc. I'll think further on allowing this for `pathogen#incubate()` and the like but `pathogen#infect()` is off the table.\n. Are you using fish shell?\n. I think `~/vim/bundle/.{}` should work, but I haven't tested.\n. This should be fixed.\n. I can't dig into this now, but I think you're correct in blaming `pathogen#join()`. A tweak to the escape in the innermost `while` is probably all that's needed.\n\nTake a stab yourself, or post back _both_ `:set runtimepath?` and `:echo &runtimepath` _without_ pathogen, and I might have a look at some point in the future.\n. It's in an issue tracker, but you already knew that. And yes, I asked for those values because they would be helpful.\n. I don't see any UNC paths in there.

So no, not the same issue. Please open a new issue with your actual symptoms.\n. Yeah you can call it no problem, but note that plugins have already loaded at that point. `:runtime plugin/**/*.vim` will reinitiate that; plugins may vary on how well this is supported.\n\nI don't see any good coming from creating an incompatible pathogen fork.\n. What does `:set rtp?` report back?`\n. Looks okay to me. You only need the first of the two pathogen calls. You're sure surround.vim and nerdtree aren't loaded?\n. Two things to try independently:\n1. Remove vundle\n2. Change to `execute pathogen#infect('~/.vim/bundle/{}')`\n. Clarify how you're installing nerdtree.\n. Really not sure what's going on. Check `:scriptnames` and see if nerdtree is in there.\n. I just noticed that there's no `~/.vimrc` in that output. Instead there's a `~/.vim/.vimrc` which is loaded _after_ all the plugins are, meaning it's too late to activate pathogen.\n. Going to take that as the root cause. I'm not sure _why_ it loads that in that particular order, but that's a question the Vim source could answer.\n. Wrong repo, buddy.\n. Check `:set compatible?` and `:set loadplugins?` and make sure they're correct.\n. Dunno what to say. The only thing pathogen does is change `'runtimepath'`, and it sounds like it succeeded at that. I'd speculate that the Vim shipped with Arch is super stripped down, but then I wouldn't expect pathogen to work at all.\n. @royaldark One other cause could be that you called pathogen after plugins have started loading, which is too late to add additional plugins to load. Check :scriptnames and make sure pathogen appears before any other plugins.\n. Unfortunate, but I'm not sure what to do about it. How do these users not notice their config is broken?\n. Yep. In particular, I want to make it possible for pathogen to return `finish` in some cases (most likely triggered by an environment variable) so that you can disable your vimrc but keep your plugins enabled, which can be very useful when debugging.\n. Looks like you meant to open this against Command-T instead?\n. I can reproduce, and also get weird error dumps if I poke at it. No idea what the root cause is but it's easy enough to work around.\n. 7.0.305 was my test case, for future reference.\n. Are you using the latest from GitHub? The workaround has not made it into a stable release.\n. Yes, please do send a patch.\n. Added a `-L` to follow the redirect. Thanks for the heads up.\n. This pushes it over the 80 character mark, so I'm not changing it till I have to.\n. Not yet. It's a little unclear how that would interact with built-in plugins.\n. So fugitive, for example, will work just fine without Git, up till the point you explicitly invoke a command. I think plugins that don't are broken, generally speaking. My strategy for dealing with these \"broken\" plugins is to install them ad hoc on a per machine basis, and limit my shared config to safe plugins.\n\nThat said, I think the approach I assume you want (put everything you could conceivably want in submodules and then conditionally load them) is valid. I'm just not sure it's a great fit for pathogen. I think if I ever decided to pursue it, it would be in a different plugin entirely.\n. Since Pathogen doesn't handle installation, this would force the user to both install by hand and update their vimrc on install, and do the reverse on uninstall. That's a ridiculous amount of effort plus opens up 4 different edge cases if they forget a step.\n. You can call `pathogen#interpose('bundle/YouCompleteMe')` to add a single bundle to the runtime path. Is that what you're really after?\n. Wrap the commit message body to 72 characters as indicated in the contribution guidelines.\n. Oh, and present tense.\n. The `$VIMRUNTIME` dir is for files that ships with Vim. You probably want to put files in `$VIM/vimfiles` instead.\n. Pushed\n. `-L` follows redirects. What's the problem?\n. This has nothing to do with pathogen, just with some plugin it's loading.\n. Are you using the exact curl command given? `-L` should follow the redirect.\n. Dupe of #128 at any rate.\n. With `.vimrc` in `$VIMBLACKLIST`, `pathogen#infect()` returns `finish`, which when given to `:execute` handily short circuits the rest of the vimrc (occasionally useful when debugging). There should be no other difference.\n\nFirst step to debugging would be to check `:scriptnames` for any discrepancies between the two setups.\n. Looks good.\n. Check `:scriptnames` to find out when `ftdetect/markdown.vim` is loaded. The whole point of this function is to fix the exact problem you describe, so something else is whack.\n. Major red flag in `ftdetect/mkd.vim`, suggesting you installed a completely different markdown plugin than the one you posted on.\n. Cloned into `.vim/bundle` like any other plugin.\n. That conditional is only true after pathogen has loaded. You can explicitly load with `runtime! autoload/pathogen.vim`.\n. \"Infect\" needs to happen on Vim startup. Helptags generation needs to happen on installation. So I think it's quite inappropriate to add that to your vimrc. Instead, it should be handled as part of the install/update process, which is outside the scope of Pathogen.\n\nFor the de facto installation method of cloning a Git repository, it's possible to automate this with Git hooks, but since that's nontrivial to set up, I also provide `:Helptags` (and the semi-deprecated `pathogen#helptags()`) for interactive usage.\n. If it's even failing on the GitHub URL, that sounds like a problem on your end. Are there any https URLs you can successfully retrieve.\n. I'm thinking this should wait for 3.0.\n. It's your vimrc's job to load pathogen.vim so the ordering is correct. Confirm how you're invoking pathogen and the directory structure of your Vim directory.\n. Find the plugin echoing it. It's not pathogen.\n. I was waiting until 3.0 on the grounds that this is a breaking change (albeit interactive only so not sure it matters). I don't understand how it could break tab completion.\n. Tab completion is case sensitive and I don't know of a way to change that.\n. lol wow is there anything that option _doesn't_ affect?\n. Not keen on officially endorsing a kludge like this. As you yourself noted, it doesn't even work for one of your three examples.\n\nThe \"trailing `{}`\" clause is obsolete. I'll remove it.\n. You can maybe start vim as `vim -V99` to see a dump of everything that's happening on startup, in order to narrow down the precise trigger. Other than that, you can try installing a slightly different vim version, as the problem is likely a bug in your particular patch level.\n. When you give Pathogen an absolute path, it has no way to know where you want it inserted. Give it something runtime relative like `.bundle/{}` and it will nest it like you desire.\n. Check `:set runtimepath?` before that and make sure it includes `/Users/me/.vim`.\n. With Vim running, can you report the output of\n\n```\n:echo pathogen#infect()\n```\n. What's the first 5 lines of `:version`?\n. Wait, why do those errors say `bash`? Those aren't vim errors at all.\n. Don't `source ~/.vimrc` in bash.\n. Do your installed plugins work?\n. Yeah the instructions say vimrc. I don't really want to muddle them with things _not_ to do.\n. I am thinking it might make more sense to accept a `*` wildcard in the existing blacklist options rather than add yet another. Would that still solve your problem?\n. `Helptags` should be called at installation time, not startup time. I deliberately omitted it from `pathogen#infect()` for that reason.\n. After each plugin installation. Ideally whatever you use to install Vim plugins would generate help tags automatically, but since `git clone` is the de facto install tool I provide `:Helptags` to ease that pain a bit.  I could see adding a FAQ entry for this.\n. If you upgrade a plugin you will need to rerun `:Helptags` to get full coverage for any doc changes.\n. You can give `infect` multiple arguments. Does that take care of everything?\n. The truncation is a function of `:set` output. See `:echo &rtp`.\n. Fixed, thanks.\n. Fixed, thanks. I used to point at the GitHub URL directly but I kept getting reports of failures I couldn't reproduce.\n. Thanks!\n. At this time I don't think the handful of use cases this would support justifies inventing a proprietary pathogen standard, no. If I ever did go down this road, I would just source a broad file glob (e.g., `runtime! preload/*.vim`), rather than dictate some weird autoload function convention. All your 6 line solution adds is more boilerplate and longer, more opaque error messages.\n. Yeah it absolutely has nothing to do with pathogen.\n. That file is already loaded by the system vimrc. You don't need it in your personal vimrc at all.\n. Needs to be wrapped to 80 chars\n. Yes that is the reason.. Dupe of #136\n. Check your `'runtimepath'` on each version and see if anything changed. You can get it into a buffer with `:call setline(1, pathogen#split(&rtp))`\n. Nevermind, I see what it is.\n. Presumably it was down but it's up now.\n. Check `:set runtimepath?`\n. Get rid of all that crap you copied from your system vimrc.\n. Yeah, it's in one of the plugins that Pathogen is loading.\n. I might add reloading some day, but it would take a lot more work than just ripping the corresponding development tools out of scriptease. If you want to leverage that functionality in the meantime, I recommend copy and paste.\n. - I don't use the triple backslash notation because it's nonstandard and looks weird if you're reading the README directly. I might cave on real code examples for the syntax highlighting, but I see extremely limited value in highlighting a `curl` command, for example.\n- I favor \"vimrc\" over `.vimrc` because on Windows the file is often named `_vimrc`. My terminology is closer to that used within Vim's own help.\n- Most of the other changes (in particular the comma fiddling) seem pretty arbitrary. Any you care to defend?\n. `/usr/share/vim/vimfiles` will work for most setups.\n. How are you getting a capitalized command completed from a lowercase input?\n. I brought them back because I was trying to be diligent about semver and save the removal for 3.0. But it's a dumb user facing feature with a clear migration path so fine, y'all win.. It's actually been on my todo list to replace all my URLs with a hosting agnostic redirect. Something like\n\n```\ngit clone https://tpope.io/vim/sensible.git\n```\n. Thanks, fixed.. Was doing some server maintenance. Should be back up.. I don't know where you got `~/.config/vim` from. If you're running Neovim, it should be `~/.config/nvim`.. You're cloning a directory to a filename.. In Neovim you need to install in `~/.config/nvim` instead (or add `~/.vim` to your runtime path).. Yep!. Sessions load after plugins are already active, so changing `'runtimepath'` in one will have no effect on what plugins are loaded.. Wrong repo.. ",

    "singerb": "I'm also hitting this issue right now. Interestingly, the setup is as follows:\n- Ubuntu (12 something) with Vim 7.3\n- within that, a Debian Lenny chroot with Vim 7.1\n\nThe chroot (set up by schroot) binds my home directory into it, so my .vimrc, .vim/ etc are all shared between the two environments. In Ubuntu, pathogen is working fine, whereas within the chroot it is not (easy to see as vim complains about not finding the colorscheme, which should be added by pathogen). I've been diving into pathogen.vim and adding echo statements to try and find the problem, and I've found the following; when run inside the chroot, at startup my echos give me:\n\n```\n/home/bzsing/.vim/bundle/*[^~]\nglob no split:\nfiles split:\n[]\npure glob:\n[]\nfiltered glob:\n[]\n```\n\nWhereas outside the chroot I see the expected:\n\n```\nhome/bzsing/.vim/bundle/*[^~]\nglob no split:\n/home/bzsing/.vim/bundle/minibufexpl.vim\n/home/bzsing/.vim/bundle/vim-colors-solarized\nfiles split:\n['/home/bzsing/.vim/bundle/minibufexpl.vim', '/home/bzsing/.vim/bundle/vim-colors-solarized']\npure glob:\n['/home/bzsing/.vim/bundle/minibufexpl.vim', '/home/bzsing/.vim/bundle/vim-colors-solarized']\nfiltered glob:\n['/home/bzsing/.vim/bundle/minibufexpl.vim', '/home/bzsing/.vim/bundle/vim-colors-solarized']\n```\n\nSo it seems that the glob() call is failing on startup. But, inside the chroot, when I run `:echo glob('/home/bzsing/.vim/bundle/*[^~]')` I see:\n\n```\nhome/bzsing/.vim/bundle/minibufexpl.vim/\n/home/bzsing/.vim/bundle/vim-colors-solarized/\n```\n\nThis suggested that something in my .vimrc was fixing the problem, and indeed that was the case. I use fish for my shell in both environments, and as a result have `set shell=sh` in my .vimrc to deal with some weirdness (can't remember what now). If I add that to the top of pathogen.vim, then it works perfectly.\n\nSo something about Vim 7.1 and fish means that shell/globbing behaves badly unless you tell vim to use sh instead. Not sure why 7.3 doesn't have this issue or what fish is doing to trigger it in 7.1 but not 7.3. For now I'm happy to maintain a personal copy of pathogen.vim with this change. It's entirely possible it's a fish bug, since this is still a pre-2.0 beta release.\n. I'm also hitting this issue right now.

I've been diving into pathogen.vim and adding echo statements to try and find the problem, and I've found the following; when run inside the chroot, at startup my echos give me:\n\n```\n/home/bzsing/.vim/bundle/*[^~]\nglob no split:\nfiles split:\n[]\npure glob:\n[]\nfiltered glob:\n[]\n```\n\nWhereas outside the chroot I see the expected:\n\n```\nhome/bzsing/.vim/bundle/*[^~]\nglob no split:\n/home/bzsing/.vim/bundle/minibufexpl.vim\n/home/bzsing/.vim/bundle/vim-colors-solarized\nfiles split:\n['/home/bzsing/.vim/bundle/minibufexpl.vim', '/home/bzsing/.vim/bundle/vim-colors-solarized']\npure glob:\n['/home/bzsing/.vim/bundle/minibufexpl.vim', '/home/bzsing/.vim/bundle/vim-colors-solarized']\nfiltered glob:\n['/home/bzsing/.vim/bundle/minibufexpl.vim', '/home/bzsing/.vim/bundle/vim-colors-solarized']\n```\n\nSo it seems that the glob() call is failing on startup. But, inside the chroot, when I run `:echo glob('/home/bzsing/.vim/bundle/*[^~]')` I see:\n\n```\nhome/bzsing/.vim/bundle/minibufexpl.vim/\n/home/bzsing/.vim/bundle/vim-colors-solarized/\n```\n\nThis suggested that something in my .vimrc was fixing the problem, and indeed that was the case. I use fish for my shell in both environments, and as a result have `set shell=sh` in my .vimrc to deal with some weirdness (can't remember what now). If I add that to the top of pathogen.vim, then it works perfectly.\n\nSo something about Vim 7.1 and fish means that shell/globbing behaves badly unless you tell vim to use sh instead. Not sure why 7.3 doesn't have this issue or what fish is doing to trigger it in 7.1 but not 7.3. For now I'm happy to maintain a personal copy of pathogen.vim with this change. It's entirely possible it's a fish bug, since this is still a pre-2.0 beta release.\n. ",

Maybe this should become an issue in [Vim repository](https://github.com/vim/vim)?\n. ",

sure why though. I need to figure out how to upload folders that are themselves git repos (e.g. they have a .git file) then that will resolve the problem I'm having. Any one have any ideas (I've tried Googling but surprisingly this doesn't come up often?)\n. @xaizek thanks for the feedback, I went with the following /cc @tpope \n\n> Just to clarify for anyone else reading this thread... \n\nSo it seems the problem wasn't with Pathogen but with Git and it not committing my submodules (i.e. each plugin had a `.git` folder and so they were being treated as submodules of my main repository). \n\nApparently there is a way to work around this using a `.gitmodules` file but I didn't have time to investigate it further so I solved the problem using some basic Unix commands:\n\n`find . -type d -name '.git' | xargs rm -rf`\n\nI then was able to commit the contents of the submodule folders.\n. Looking at the `:scriptnames` output it _seems_ like maybe the .vimrc is being loaded _before_ the pathogen file? But if that's the case I'm not sure how to resolve that so it's always loaded first?\n. @tpope so my full dotfile structure can be seen here: https://github.com/Integralist/dotfiles (technically it's

sure why though. I need to figure out how to upload folders that are themselves git repos (e.g. they have a .git file) then that will resolve the problem I'm having. Any one have any ideas (I've tried Googling but surprisingly this doesn't come up often?)\n. @xaizek thanks for the feedback, I went with the following /cc @tpope \n\n> Just to clarify for anyone else reading this thread... \n\nSo it seems the problem wasn't with Pathogen but with Git and it not committing my submodules (i.e. each plugin had a `.git` folder and so they were being treated as submodules of my main repository). \n\nApparently there is a way to work around this using a `.gitmodules` file but I didn't have time to investigate it further so I solved the problem using some basic Unix commands:\n\n`find . -type d -name '.git' | xargs rm -rf`\n\nI then was able to commit the contents of the submodule folders.\n.
