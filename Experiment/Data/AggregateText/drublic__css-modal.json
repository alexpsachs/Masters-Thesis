    "drublic": "`max-width` seems a good solution. `max-height` does not make sense I think because you can scroll the content-area.\nWhat do you think?\n. Closing this for now. No more support for Android 2.3.\n. Cannot reproduce this, sorry. Can you please add a video if the problem remains.\n. Merged in bb0bd269684c91d156f9fda2e3b45a77a4f5c934. Thanks!\n. This happens in all browsers, since the `has-overlay` class removes overflow-y in order to prevent the background-page from scrolling.\nWe need another solution for that where the overflow is not visible but the scrollbars are.\n\nWill look into it soon.\n. Agreed. This seems to be more of a research topic for an article.\n. Thanks @anselmh and @benschwarz!\n. This would currently need a lot of rewrite of the whole JS functionality and also add more complexity that is not needed in a lot of cases.\nIt is possible to use hashes for navigation on a page since modal.js doesn't touch the the DOM or anything if it has evaluated that the hash doesn't belong to a modal.\n\nThere might be plugins out there that have problems with interacting with hash-changes that don't belong to their \"area of acting\" but this seems to be the problem of the respective plugin rather than CSS Modal. There might also be other plugins like accordions that rely on the hash being used.\n\nOne more advantage of using hashes is that it enables deeplinking to modals which can be extremely useful.\n\nSo as a conclusion I don't bother too much at the moment to move away from using the hash where appropriate.\n\nThanks anyway for raising this issue.\n. Sounds like a good idea. I will look into the specification to find out if <dialog> is really a good decision for building modals.\n. So apparently `<dialog>` is not implemented in any browser yet. Due to @stevefaulkner's feedback on Twitter I think we will stick to `<section>` at the moment and will update as soon as there is more movement by the browsers towards `<dialog>`.\n. Good points, @Schepp. Actually I think it is worth including a short note about changing the `aria-labelledby` in the How To Markup section.\nI don't think it is necessary to include this as a JS method, users might remove the label's id anyway if they don't need them.\n. What would be the use case for multiple modals stacked over another? Currently you can switch between modals via linking to a new modal.\n. It is possible to navigate through modals with using the hash only, since at least Chrome saves this state in the history.\nThe current implementation doesn't work great with browser history. This is something we need to tackle too.\n. What would be a good way to do it? This might mean that we would have to parse the whole CSS and find the highest z-index.\nAlso if this happens automatically you cannot layer anything above the actual modal. This might be needed on smaller screens when building an app-like website.\nApart from that it is possible to set the z-index in the SCSS file as a variable.\n. Thanks man! I just published this today to get it in bower and travis. Gonna deploy the page tomorrow with the blogpost.\nThanks anyway :)\n. Here we go: http://drublic.github.io/css-modal/\nAnd a blog post: http://drublic.de/blog/introducing-css-modal/\n. The issue of jumping needs to be addressed. It's reported in #24. Thanks :)\n. Thanks, Ryan! I'll check it out.\n@benschwarz PR is always very welcome :)\n. If I invested correctly, this means we need extra markup to target each hidden div. I use this method a lot for navigations, especially on mobile where you need a toggle button for the menu to be visible or not. It is also a method that I use in a modified version for the tabbed content on the page.\nTo be honest I don't think this will work perfectly with the modals since the jumping bug originates in preventing the overflow for the content an thus prevent scrolling the content.\nI will try out some more and come up with a solution shortly.\n. And here is the solution. Pretty easy. Please let me know if you find any bugs in this fix.\nI've also added a test to prevent regression.\n. > Mainly, I have no idea why you are doing this test.\n\nGood point. I cannot remember why I included it. Basically it is not possible for a child of a modal to be targetted via hash since this would hide the modal. So it might be ok to remove the check.\n\nI will run some tests on this and check back soon!\n\nThanks for the PR.\n. @tzi, thanks for looking into this. I've now removed the check if the modal contains an ID since it is not necessary.\nThis closes the bug and we don't actually need the PR anymore :)\n. Thanks for the comment and thoughts, Patrick.\n\nThe modal is focused when opening it. Please see [this line](https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/blob/master/modal.js#L85) and the `setFocus` function in modal.js. And it works for me. Do you have problems using it?\nThis implementation doesn't include cycling through the modal though. Do you have any hint on how to enforce cycling through an element?\n\nI tried to focus back on the main page when the modal is closed [here](https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/blob/master/modal.js#L105). I might have to look into restoring the original focus state on the actual element instead of the body element which happens in Chrome.\n\nAn update for the cycling should definitely be implemented.\n. Ping @patrickhlauke. Would be awesome if you could throw some links at me :) I'd love to include it in the next version.\n. Thank you so much for this, Thomas. Great to see sees smaller issues fixed so soon.\nIt's merged in 8874a6e76945bc099d9c513d641e6ffc6c1b5e2b.\n. Mh\u2026 this looks like an issue with Firefox. Works for me at the moment, tho on my Mac. \nI just updated the gh-pages branch, which has another fix for the website. I don't really think this fixes the issue, but I will look into the Windows version of Firefox soon.\nThanks for reporting.\n. I've tested this on Firefox in Win XP and Ubuntu 12.10 now and it works perfectly for me. Which Linux distribution are you using?\nI gonna close this for now since it appears to be an edge case. Anyways it is always great to know about these.\nThank you so much for reporting the issue!\n. This might be related to #33.\n. Closed this with 928f183e18a88862f12e495926814feb60a4c323 for #33. \\o/\n. Thanks for the contribution. I've tried my best and cherry picked cross commits. It's modified in b959efc5ad62b5529aca6c8177a0ca1a0fef3d5c. Wheee!\n. It's currently hard to find a proper solution for Android and iOS that works. I will try to find a better solution for the next version.\n. Thanks for reporting. This is related to #31 and I will try to find a working solution.\n. Looks like the IE8 CSS hack influences IE9 and IE10 too.\n\n```\n// Internet Explorer 8\ndisplay: none\\9;\n\n&.is-active {\n    display: block\\9;\n}\n```\n\nI will try to work around this and find a better solution.\n. Found another solution. Please see commit message.\nThanks for the help and reporting this bug.\n. Just push the hash (ID of the modal) on load.\n\n```\nwindow.location.hash = 'the-modals-id';\n```\n\nRemember to check if another hash is already set.\n\n```\nif (!window.location.hash) {\n    window.location.hash = 'the-id';\n}\n```\n\nYou get the idea.\n. Would you guys think it makes sense to add a kind of gallery for this modal? I mean for the page only.\nShould be easy to do.\n. No worries man :) We could do this with some lines of JS but we would need all images in the proper size. I'll look into it :)\n. @matt-bailey Makes a lot of sense. Actually we had this issue before (on Twitter I think). Anyway I think gallery functionality is pretty easy doable. So I'm implementing this tonight :D\n. Nothing awesome, but it has a functionality now \\o/ Micro gallery, hehe.\nThanks again for the discussion, people.\n. Wow, thank you so much @4nduril! Great contribution.\n\nI am currently thinking of what would be the best way to include the LESS port. I am actually good with maintaining both versions. But I think it wouldn't be best to have both Sass and LESS next to each other in the main branch.\nThis is because:\n- I don't want to have both ports in the download of Bower\n- I don't want to get people confused with what to use\n\nThere are some ways to include the LESS port:\n- Use an extra branch\n- Maintain it in the main branch\n- Use an extra repository\n\nThe stuff that is currently missing to integrate the LESS port are\n- Tests\n- Grunt tasks\n\nI'd love to get some feedback to the aforementioned questions.\n\nAgain, thank you for taking the time to create this port.\n. Awesome work, @4nduril. Thanks again!\nWe now have a [`less`-branch](https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/tree/less). I will publish the less version with the 1.1.0 release I think which should be pretty soon. I will also add another Bower component `css-modal-less`.\n\nPlease let me know if you find any bugs or have more ideas on the LESS branch.\n. Yeah, sounds good to me too. Gonna test that soon and merge it.\n. Thank you so much @realmyst for checking this out. The PR is merged.\nI've had to update the addEventListener polyfill in 465daead421539fb52710d7455abbbbe6748211b in order to get the listeners working in IE 8. Hope this is everything. Guess we will get reports with the next version if otherwise. :)\n. @esanmiguelc Please see [this code](https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/blob/master/site/js/page.js#L52-L70) and check the implementation for the website. This isn't part of the modal tho.\n. Currently you can only do this by changing Sass/CSS. See [this line](https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/blob/master/modal.scss#L279).\nWe should move this text to an attribute on the close link it self I guess.\n. I'll keep this open until the data-attribute solution is in or at least researched.\n. Would suggest that too.\nYou can also use the skeleton as a JS template and replace the contents how you need them.\n. Just updated some stuff in your PR. Thanks :) It's now in!\n. Screenshot would be awesome. Sadly I don't own an iPhone 5. It works great on 4S (except the problems ok #31 and #32).\nDid you do any modifications to the modal? Code would be great too.\n. Thanks, Ben! Landed in d0648d5ac212735b8b78661b0c5038a5a2406d6f.\n. Thanks for fixing this behavior. I merged your commit in 5187b3ba514425ae01c84591f6d27505a5ace400.\n:beers: \n. Thanks! Can you please update the pull request and the SCSS file stead of the CSS file. Please also run grunt and the tests if you can. That would be great. :)\n. You can make the changes we need, then add them to the staging area with `git add *` and amend your last commit using `git commit --amend`. You can then adjust the message too (please make it more clear what you did in the message, you can even self-close this PR if you want to)\u2026 and then you need to force push to the branch you work on: `git push -f`.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions.\n. Please see the commit in a0712dda3291255b47da9cc1cf49ec75f9fb9b77. This tackles the problem in the right area.\nIt's important to add `-webkit-overflow-scrolling` to the content area. Otherwise the modal's content isn't scrollable in some cases. I've tested this on iOS 6.\nThanks anyways for giving this a try.\n. The fix landed. Thanks :)\n. Corrected in both places. Please see 414af6f. Thanks.\n\nFor further Pull Requests: Please be aware of the project's infrastructure and read the contributing guidelines in order to get your work into the project faster. Thank you so much for considering to help this project.\n. This PR doesn't have much other thinks compared to #45 than the inclusion in SCSS.\nI'll pass on this and look to interoperate the changes in #45.\n. Thanks for the effort. Please don't send any more PR.\nI'll figure out a way to incorporate the change as already stated.\n. This isn't an update of the PR. I've outlined how it works [here](https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/pull/45#issuecomment-20196817).\n. Awesome. Thank you.\n\nPlease be aware that it gets a little bit more complicated than just copying the stuff over. Please test implementations on mobile devices aso. But you know your way around it :P\nAlso you can throw this into wip-1.1.0.\n. Wheee. Done.\n. @SantzDesign Please don't spam the issues ;) See https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/issues/79#issuecomment-29006489 for more information.\n. From #64\n\n> I've changed my mind in so for that I think the LESS port should be maintained in another repo.\n> Here are the advantages:\n> - own build status for with Travis\n> - clear separation in PRs and issues\n> - own repo registered in Bower\n> \n> Any objections?\n. @4nduril Thanks for all your work again! I've decided to not include the LESS for within this project. Please register a project yourself and try to maintain it if you need to. I'll try my best to keep up with PRs for JS changes and stuff.\nSorry about that but it's not practical to maintain two separate repositories in order to be up to date with the latest from one or the other. The technology I chose for CSS Modal is Sass and I think this is currently the best fitting tool we can get for this project.\n\nThanks again to everyone included in the discussion.\n. Finally merged this. Thanks for the work.\n. Thanks for fixing this. It's in now.\n. Awesome! Thanks so much. Wanted to do this for v1.1.0 :) Will merge this into the wip-1.1.0 branch after checking it.\nThanks again.\n. It's in now, thanks again, @fabien-d! I will try to release 1.1.0 as soon as possible.\nPlease feel free to help improve CSS Modal further :)\n. Thanks for the effort you put into this pull request. I like the idea and I think this is something we could consider for 1.1.0.\nI'll leave this unmerged for now to look into this issue myself with the current implementation and the different animation styles we'd like to include (#51).\n\nThe problem with changing the background to a filter in IE could be that there are other quirks that come with it. Also I personally don't like to rely on filters. But I will look into this again :)\n. We've applied the changes as outlined in #73 for the new structure. Thanks again for providing the idea and valuable input :)\n. You can use set a hash via JS for opening a modal. I wouldn't encourage you to do this without the user knowing about it. It might be a bit arbitrary.\n\nPlease see #34 for implementation details.\n. Yup, sounds good to me. @jhabdas Thanks, can you please use a colon and recommit this with a description what this commit does (instead of \"Update modal.scss\"). This PR will get merged into wip-1.0.0 FYI.\n. Merged this with the changes! Thank you.\n. Thanks for using CSS Modal.\nYou can use the events by subscribing to them as if they were click events or something. Here is the code:\n\n```\n$(document).on('cssmodal:show', function (event) {\n    console.log(event);\n});\n```\n\nHope that helped.\n\nOn 28.08.2013, at 01:59, Robson Junior notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> I'm trying to call a custom function to stop my html5 video player but I don't know how to use the cssmodal:hide event.\n> \n> I'm using jQuery.

I will revisit this as soon as 1.1.0 is near finalization and will update with the latest changes.\n.

Oh and yea\u2026 the commits are in :) Thanks!\n. Great, that you got it working now :)\n\nI will close the issue now. Please re-open it, if there is another problem with this solution.\nWe will try to document this better and add a plugin for the functionality in v1.1.0. Please also see #63.\n. Thanks so much for bringing up this issue. With #58 we will be trying to make the modal more customizable and make it easier to use it with Bower.\n\nWe could use some help with defining the customizable variables in Sass \u2013 so if you are up for it we would be very thankful.\n. Thanks for your ideas.\n\nI am not sure where we should start with this.\nMaybe a structure like this would be great:\n\n``` javascript\n|-- components\n   |-- css-modal\n      |-- _modal-config.scss\n      |-- _modal-core.scss\n      |-- _modal-theme.scss\n      |-- modal.scss\n|-- scss\n   |-- _modal-config.scss\n   |-- main.scss\n```\n\nWhile `_modal-config.scss` in `css-modal` (Bower component) holds all of the modal's default configuration, maybe with a `!default` directive (might be needed). The `_modal-config.scss` file in `scss` holds all the custom overwrites we need. We could include a template for this in the package too.\n\n`main.scss` would have the following inclusions:\n\n```\n@import 'modal-config';\n@import '../components/css-modal/modal';\n```\n\nAll configuration in the local file overwrites the global defaults.\n\nWhat do you think? Does this make sense?\n. We use \"v1.0.0\" as our \"development\" branch atm. It would be awesome if you could create a branch from there and use the existing work in #58. You can then do a PR against v1.0.0 and we will review from there. Sounds good?\n. I've added a little bit of contribution guidelines in [CONTRIBUTE.md](https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/blob/master/CONTRIBUTE.md). Which information is missing?\n. I've updated the CONTRIBUTE.md file. Thanks for the discussion and your ideas. Was applied in #73.\n. I think we should not depend on these classes atm. But we can use CSS hacks for IE8 and we can utilize these maybe.\n\nWhat's the reason to have a 16x16px background image instead of a 1x1px? Optimized it has only 2 bytes more with 90% alpha channel though. I've added this in the commit above.\n. I will close this issue for now. We don't need a perfect support for IE8 since use is more and more fading. Apart from that: We've worked on this in the commits mentioned above.\n. @anselmh Is this related to what happens in branch `plugins`?\n. @grayghostvisuals Please have a look at #133 for 2). This might also be a solution for 1).\n. A css only variant would be nice too. But you can do this by overwriting\nsome values.\n\nThis implementation is a variant for when you want to set a width which\ncomes from a CMS or another user input.\n\nOn Tue, May 27, 2014 at 7:45 PM, Dennis Gaebel notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> if you all like it then I'm all [image: :+1:] for it.\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/drublic/css-modal/issues/68#issuecomment-44309585\n> .\n.

Thanks so much for the commit! Separation LGTM at the moment but need to have a closer look.\nPlease stick to one task and one task only for each PR as Anselm said.\n\nWe haven't discussed including Grunt plugins other than we have. We don't need the tasks that you included, it's just something that is opinionated and I don't think we should add to much of this stuff in there. We could try to remove something tho\u2026\n\n> Eventually some mixins and functions should be added to manage the complexity/prefix grossness of the transitions and animations etc. Maybe adding auto prefixer would be better suited and a more maintainable option going forward.\n\nWe don't want to add any complexity for developers. They should use it with Bower or just as a drop in, so there is no real space for prefixer or something. We had the [sass-mixins](https://github.com/drublic/Sass-Mixins) repo as dependency in the early stage of this project and this didn't proof to be a good way to integrate with existing websites.\n\nAgain, thanks for the great work.

This will be fixed with the new version. For the time being, please update the css-modal to v1.1.0-alpha.\n. Oops, sorry. The release is called `v1.1.0alpha`.\n. Closing this for now.\n. You can compile the code yourself by running `grunt sass:dist`. You can then find the file in the build directory.\nWe'll fix it.\n. Thanks for the suggestion. !default is really a cure to some evil package management brings to the front-end.\nFor 1.1.0 this is already done.

Firefox seems to be buggy.\n\n2) This seems to be a CSS issue with the general styling. Please try to check your CSS if this issue is still present.\n. We should utilize the custom events of CSS Modal. This is nothing that we\nshould add to the core, IMO, since not everybody uses video.

Can you please provide a test case for this scenario for us to figure out the problem? Thanks!\n. It works if you call http://www.appix.co.il/GitHub/#modal-text. I don't know why there is a handler on the link that prevents pushing the hash to the history. We cannot help you with this, sorry.\nPlease make sure modal.js is available in on your page.\n. This looks fantastic. I'll test this asap. We need to squash the commits before merging them in though.\n. Thanks. I've merged this and updated the variable at the \"correct\" position.\n. Thanks for reporting. We already tackled this problem in #83. It will be available with the next release.\n. I use a Wufoo form on drublic.de and it works quite well. Can you please provide a test case?\n. @charlespeters Can you please have a look at this again? Otherwise I will now close the issue.\n. No worries. Thanks for sharing your results.\n. `jQuery.brower` is nothing we use within the modal. Actually we don't use any jQuery at all. \nI think in this case it's not the modal's code that causes the effect you describe. We enforce that you cannot scroll the page if the modal is active.\nPlease make sure there are no other influences on the page that might be problematic for the modal (maybe try to remove other plugins).\n\nI am in favor of closing this issue but please let us know if there is a problem if you remove other code.\n. Thanks for replying and closing this issue.\n. @anselmh Is this something you want to work on?\n. +1\n. Would be awesome to have something like \"Queue\".\n. Not gonna happen.. This is because of the way CSS Modal works (without JS it needs the hash bang). We could add an option for this where you could deactivate the hash bang if JS is available.\n. @cyxou Currently there is no way to do this. We will tackle this in v1.2.0 and include a JS-only based behavior.\n. Done. Will be included within the next version.\n. @richie-y Is this issue still existing?\n. Thumbs bug. Gotta go and close this for the time being. Thanks everyone.\n. I've removed the text, since it is without value for this issue. Can you please let me know which OS you're using on the iPhone.\n. Sorry for the long wait. Currently I don't see any chance we will fix this. I don't know if this is a problem on our end or on iOS' but I think it might be the latter.\nIf you still have problems with iOS 8 please let us know.\n\nThanks so much for your time to report this problem.\n. Any results @anselmh?\n. Thanks for testing.\n. Merged, thanks. :)\n. See https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/commit/594bb89b47329124408e7d261e9a8b0addfefb92?w=0 for relevant changes.\n. Thanks for reporting this problem. Can you please try to use the latest version from master? This might work better.\nPlease let us know if the problem remains.\n. Is this problem resolved with #136 (current master)?\n. Closing this now. Please reopen if problem remains\n. @digitaljhelms I think this was a bug with libsass for quite some time now. They fixed it with version 3.0 which has a (couple of) RC at the moment.\nPlease try the version and let us know if your issue isn't fixed yet. I will definitely look into this now.\n\nConcerning versioning: This was a major failure by myself. We will switch to more semantic versions from now one. You will get the latest release which is 1.1.8 from bower since a couple of weeks.\n. In your CSS you might need to change\n\n```\n.modal-inner {\n    extend %modal;\n}\n```\n\nto \n\n```\n#modal-text {\n    @extend %modal;\n}\n```\n\nIt should look OK after that.\n. Closing this now. @Ziiweb, please let us know if this isn't solved for you yet.\n. Please see the gallery plugin. This is done now and you can find all of the requested features there.\n. Currently not. What is the problem of the current implementation?\n. I think this has to stay this way. You can overwrite the values in `_modal-theme.scss` in case it's needed.\nWhat exactly do you mean by more \"standard\" close button?\n. This is now part of branch `plugin-gallery`. Thanks.\n. Looks good to me. I've tested this in Chrome. Works.\n. Thanks for reporting. can you please provide a test-case?\n. Thanks for the update. It doesn't seem to be connected to the modal.\n\nPlease see the screenshot: It looks like it is connected to some facebook integration. Can you please recheck this?\n\n![screen shot 2014-05-22 at 18 20 42](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/502487/3056676/485faaa0-e1cd-11e3-85f3-57c344ff255d.png)\n. > Ok, I disabled the social button, but the error still remained for me http://joxi.ru/47d-U_3JTJC5MOFNJVI\n\nIf you look at the stack trace you can see that the bug comes from jQuery.simpleFAQ.js. I think the usage of both collides with each other.\n. We are currently looking into better IE8 support.\n\nPing @jonathanweiss.\n. @Tuning-Soft It seems I cannot open your website without IE8 crashing, which is why I can't figure out what the problem is. Can you please try to test with the `ie8-support` branch, please. Please make sure to disable all other libraries.\n\nI cannot reproduce this behavior with my tests.\n. I am going to close this for the time being. Please come back if the bug remains.\n. There is another bug about this behavior here: #186\nPlease check again with the current master version.\n. Thanks!\n. I've updated the pull request. If someone finds time over the weekend I'd be really happy :)\n. Updated. Thank you :)\n. Looks good to me. Can be merged.\n. Thanks for reporting. Seems to be a serious problem. Can you please provide a reduced test-case?\n. That's a good idea. I'll open a new issue about this.\n. Done in 1d13ac00ff05862c9f1893b74303e76fdc38de54. Also part of v1.2.0.\n. Looks good to me.\n. :+1: \n. Thanks.\n. Thanks for the work. The style-injection now seems to work in IE8.\nOnly problem: When the modal opens, the styles are not injected. When you resize the browser they are. Any chance you can look into this?\n. Will look into it for 1.2.0. If you find the time and have the knowledge, I'd appreciate input on the implementation (data-attribute\u2026).\n. Implementation done in #168. Please have a look.\n. Since it's done, i've closed this issue now.\n. Merged in d7f32ed. Thanks.\n. FIxed in 8068007. Thanks :)\n. Updated. Thanks for the heads up.\n. Sorry for the late response. There are stackable modals. Please see \"Demo Show\" and the link \"Stackable Modal\" inside index.html for a demo. Does this help with your issue?\n. It is also possible to use the modal directly in JS. You can find it within the custom data of the event.\n. Thanks you for reporting this. Good point and thanks for investigating. The fix made it into master in 78ef562 and will be in the next version.\n. Thanks for the report and sorry for handling this issue this late.\nThe latest master has some commits that might fix this issue. My tests with the visual test (`index.html`) indicate this although the background still scrolls if touch outside the modal.\n\nPlease let me know of your test results.\n. Please also see 3c66b9f027520e37fe78d6ae90e9eb190e18ec13. This should fix this issue mostly.\n. I could not reproduce this on Android 4.4 Chrome. To be honest, we don't support Mobile Safari on iOS 5. \nI would be really happy if you could open a Pull Request if you find a solution.\n. Done. Please see https://www.npmjs.org/package/css-modal.\n. Good point. It needs the class `modal--show`. Can you fix this with a PS please?\nUpdate: http://fiddle.jshell.net/r6weLcoj/2/\n. Merged in ce2001f78fb599761a10622982e1ef066284efb7! Thanks!\n. Thanks for reporting @stanggt3! Much appreciated. Can you please provide a reduced test case using JS Bin or something like that? Thank you.\n. I've found the problematic code and fixed it. Please let me know if this doesn't fix it for you.\n. Thank you so much for contributing back. This means a lot.\n\nIt is a very good pull request and works perfectly in Firefox and Chrome. Safari is a bit buggy, but we shouldn't care to much I think. I just had some minor syntax corrections which would be great if you could fix them :)\nAlso please add a note with the commit message to the change log please.\n\nThanks again.\n. > What is buggy in Safari ? Perhaps we could try to correct it ?\n\nIt looks like the focus isn't maintained within the modal. Maybe this is a bug on my end but might also be a problem with Safari.\n\nThe changes made it into master in 59fcdd3e0d92cc4c6a0ee05344486644074d0dab. Thanks so much again!\n. Ooops, forgot to update the issue. It's updated since a couple of weeks now.\n. Looks good to me. \n. Thanks. Merged in 122d54909d68f92d7c2b1d38958cf8bb325dbad8.\n. Thanks for reporting this.\nHave you included Bean as in [here](https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/blob/master/test/index.html)? It should be included before modal.js.\n\nI assume you did this already. So this is potentially a problem with the styling of the modal. Can you please have a look if the JavaScript works already? For example check if classes get applied to the HTML tag.\nIf this is the case can you please check if the modal in index.html is working for you? Otherwise we should check where there is a wrong behavior within the modal.\n\nThanks in advance for checking this.\n. Please see #167: We will switch to jQuery to enable people to use tools which are well known.\n. Closing this in favor of #167.\n. I am still thinking of using either Bean or jQuery in order to maintain backwards compatibility.\n. Thanks for looking into it. There are other error with IE8 which seem to be separate to this one.\nI will fix them.\n. Thanks for reporting, @Komald. We will look into this issue asap.\n. Just saw that this demo is using v1.0.1. Can you please check with 1.2.0 https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/blob/master/build/modal.css ?\n. That's just a problem with the wrong class: modals need .modal--show http://jsfiddle.net/seyfso6L/2/\n. So I've checked this again.\n\nCurrently the second modal opens \"stacked\" above the first one. This happens in IE9 and Chrome for me.\nIf you don't want this behavior, but want to open the first, then click, (close the first), open the second, close the second and be back at the page without any modal you might want to add `data-stackable=\"false\"` to the second modal's `section` element.\n\n**Edit:** Stackable modals don't seem to work according to my tests at the moment. I'll take care of this.\n. Stackable modals should be fixed now.\n. Closing this now. Please let me know if you have any problems with it.\n. Thanks for reporting. Closing in favor of #172.\n. Yes, `break-word` is not in the spec.\nFor `break-all` it says:\n\n> In addition to \u2018normal\u2019 soft wrap opportunities, lines may break between any two letters (except where forbidden by the \u2018line-break\u2019 property). Hyphenation is not applied. This option is used mostly in a context where the text is predominantly using CJK characters with few non-CJK excerpts and it is desired that the text be better distributed on each line.\n\nI don't think this is what we need here, right?\n\nPlease see the SO issue here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1795109/what-is-the-difference-between-word-break-break-all-versus-word-wrap-break\n\nI'd opt for leaving it as is.\n. Any more input? Otherwise I'll leave it as it is.\n. Ok, so you are right I think. We should implement both as the article suggests.\n\nCould you please update to:\n\n```\n-ms-word-break: break-all; // Needed for oldIE support, but words are broken up letter-by-letter\n     word-break: break-all;\n     word-break: break-word; // Non standard for webkit\n```\n\nand please remember to update the changelog :)\n\nThanks so much!\n. Thanks. I've changed your commits a bit and incorporated them into one.\nAgain, thanks for the update and the nice response times :)\n. Thanks for reporting this. Can you please check back with the latest commit in master? It should fix a couple of these issues. I could not reproduce this issue with the visual test in `index.html`.\n. Awesome. Thank you!\n. Please use a `z-index` lower than the modal's one (which is `999`) for the navigation. YouTube videos sometimes need an extra parameter or something like this. If you google for this problem: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3820325/overlay-opaque-div-over-youtube-iframe\n\nPlease include the JS on your page without looking at it any further. It should just work.\n. You can use the \"no-hash\" method. Just add a `data-cssmodal-nohash` to the link as seen [here](https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/blob/master/index.html#L41)\n\nPlease see if this works for you.\n. Thanks for reporting. I can reproduce this. Will try to look into it soon.\n. This works now. Probably because of #181. Please let me know if you run into any other bug.\n. Thanks.\n. > Thank for the very nice modal. Sorry for the noob quetions. I have a form inside of the modal with a submit button. How can I close the modal when the submit button is clicked.\n\nPlease just change the hash on submission. With jQuery this looks like this:\n\n```\n$('form').on('submit', function () {\n    window.location.href = '#!';\n});\n```\n\n> Also, how can I remove the close bar and button on the small screen.\n\nYou need to dig a bit deeper into the styles might take some time to do so.\n. Thanks. Good finding. I've merged your commit and added a test in index.html. Will be part of the next version.\n. @jgadbois Thanks for reporting. I could not find any bugs with the `hashchange` event. As @chilblane points out this might be some other script blocking the `hashchange` event.\n. Thank you for the quick feedback. I will close this issue. If you run into this behavior again, please let me know :)\n. Done. Thank you for the heads up.\n. On master in `index.html` all modals are loaded via ajax and the modal closes perfectly. Can you please try with the current version?\nCan you please also provide a reduced test case for this behavior?\n. Hi, thanks for the heads up and thanks for using CSS Modal.\n\nWe've build two plugins for that. Please see the plugins folder and search\nthe issues. We've already answered this, I think. I hope it helps :)\n\nPlease let us know if you need anything else.\n\nOn Mon, Apr 20, 2015, 3:41 PM droidsignage notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Both HTML5 and Youtube video keep playing after the modal has been closed.\n> How would I link the close function to stopping both video types?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/issues/185.\n. @tmpkco Please check out master and test index.html: css-modal/#modal-html5video. Does the video stop function for you? You can always post a reduced example. That is what I'd be happy to work with :)\n. Closing this as there was no more information provided. Please let me know if the bug persists.\n. Have you checked this with the version on master? I have now pushed a fix for the index file. This fixes it for me.\nCan you please have another look at the issue?\n. Will not be handled, IE8 support will be removed.. Thanks for the report. I've now worked around this by setting a default height of `auto` when setting `.has-layout` to `html`. This should fix it. If you have any other issue with this implementation, please let me know :)\n. Thanks for reporting this problem. It's fixed and will land in the next version.\n. Just push a new hash to the location object:\n\n```\nlocation.hash = '';\n```\n\nAlso see: https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/blob/master/FAQ.md#is-it-possible-to-show-modal-on-page-load You cant to do the reverse thing.\n. Good point. Thank you. I've merged it in 6d671d7e2c77fd1136d9f6bc4cf2cd97ceab2564.\n\nCheers!\n. Thanks for reporting. Is this still a bug? I think this was something we had in earlier versions.\nI currently cannot reproduce this problem with my Chrome on Mac.\n. Work is going on.. Thank you for the heads up. Just landed.\n. Thanks. Merged in b1c94a1bc2090c64d442a247895e774e49ab4e91.\n. It's needed for modals with iframes. Please specify the reason behind your question.\nWe might namespace the data-attributes with the next version\n. Thanks for the report.\nNever experienced this before. I will investigate and test this.\nDid you use Chrome Mobile as a Browser?\n. I have tested this with the current Chrome Mobile and it works nice for me.\nIf you think there is a bug please provide a short video of the behavior you get :)\n. Thank you. This is fixed in 6e3c773647e85cd57f8343337236a20dbf93328c.\r\nWill not be present in the new version.. Very nice. Thank you!\n. Great. Thank you!\n. Done\n. Double check is better. Thanks.\n. I am sorry, people. I will change this with the new version.\r\n\r\nWhat do you need, CSS or Sass?. Next version will be better (CSS only aso).. Ok, thanks.. Thanks for the report. I am in the middle of a rewrite and will close this bug with the next version.\r\nAre you talking about HTML5 Video or a YouTube/Vimeo\u2026 iframe?. Thanks.. `max-width` seems a good solution. `max-height` does not make sense I think because you can scroll the content-area.\nWhat do you think?\n. Closing this for now. No more support for Android 2.3.\n. Cannot reproduce this, sorry. Can you please add a video if the problem remains.\n. Merged in bb0bd269684c91d156f9fda2e3b45a77a4f5c934. Thanks!\n. This happens in all browsers, since the `has-overlay` class removes overflow-y in order to prevent the background-page from scrolling.\nWe need another solution for that where the overflow is not visible but the scrollbars are.\n\nWill look into it soon.\n. Agreed. This seems to be more of a research topic for an article.\n. Thanks @anselmh and @benschwarz!\n. This would currently need a lot of rewrite of the whole JS functionality and also add more complexity that is not needed in a lot of cases.\nIt is possible to use hashes for navigation on a page since modal.js doesn't touch the the DOM or anything if it has evaluated that the hash doesn't belong to a modal.\n\nThere might be plugins out there that have problems with interacting with hash-changes that don't belong to their \"area of acting\" but this seems to be the problem of the respective plugin rather than CSS Modal. There might also be other plugins like accordions that rely on the hash being used.\n\nOne more advantage of using hashes is that it enables deeplinking to modals which can be extremely useful.\n\nSo as a conclusion I don't bother too much at the moment to move away from using the hash where appropriate.\n\nThanks anyway for raising this issue.\n. Sounds like a good idea. I will look into the specification to find out if <dialog> is really a good decision for building modals.\n. So apparently `<dialog>` is not implemented in any browser yet. Due to @stevefaulkner's feedback on Twitter I think we will stick to `<section>` at the moment and will update as soon as there is more movement by the browsers towards `<dialog>`.\n. Good points, @Schepp. Actually I think it is worth including a short note about changing the `aria-labelledby` in the How To Markup section.\nI don't think it is necessary to include this as a JS method, users might remove the label's id anyway if they don't need them.\n. What would be the use case for multiple modals stacked over another? Currently you can switch between modals via linking to a new modal.\n. It is possible to navigate through modals with using the hash only, since at least Chrome saves this state in the history.\nThe current implementation doesn't work great with browser history. This is something we need to tackle too.\n. What would be a good way to do it? This might mean that we would have to parse the whole CSS and find the highest z-index.\nAlso if this happens automatically you cannot layer anything above the actual modal. This might be needed on smaller screens when building an app-like website.\nApart from that it is possible to set the z-index in the SCSS file as a variable.\n. Thanks man! I just published this today to get it in bower and travis. Gonna deploy the page tomorrow with the blogpost.\nThanks anyway :)\n. Here we go: http://drublic.github.io/css-modal/\nAnd a blog post: http://drublic.de/blog/introducing-css-modal/\n. The issue of jumping needs to be addressed. It's reported in #24. Thanks :)\n. Thanks, Ryan! I'll check it out.\n@benschwarz PR is always very welcome :)\n. If I invested correctly, this means we need extra markup to target each hidden div. I use this method a lot for navigations, especially on mobile where you need a toggle button for the menu to be visible or not. It is also a method that I use in a modified version for the tabbed content on the page.\nTo be honest I don't think this will work perfectly with the modals since the jumping bug originates in preventing the overflow for the content an thus prevent scrolling the content.\nI will try out some more and come up with a solution shortly.\n. And here is the solution. Pretty easy. Please let me know if you find any bugs in this fix.\nI've also added a test to prevent regression.\n. > Mainly, I have no idea why you are doing this test.\n\nGood point. I cannot remember why I included it. Basically it is not possible for a child of a modal to be targetted via hash since this would hide the modal. So it might be ok to remove the check.\n\nI will run some tests on this and check back soon!\n\nThanks for the PR.\n. @tzi, thanks for looking into this. I've now removed the check if the modal contains an ID since it is not necessary.\nThis closes the bug and we don't actually need the PR anymore :)\n. Thanks for the comment and thoughts, Patrick.\n\nThe modal is focused when opening it. Please see [this line](https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/blob/master/modal.js#L85) and the `setFocus` function in modal.js. And it works for me. Do you have problems using it?\nThis implementation doesn't include cycling through the modal though. Do you have any hint on how to enforce cycling through an element?\n\nI tried to focus back on the main page when the modal is closed [here](https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/blob/master/modal.js#L105). I might have to look into restoring the original focus state on the actual element instead of the body element which happens in Chrome.\n\nAn update for the cycling should definitely be implemented.\n. Ping @patrickhlauke. Would be awesome if you could throw some links at me :) I'd love to include it in the next version.\n. Thank you so much for this, Thomas. Great to see sees smaller issues fixed so soon.\nIt's merged in 8874a6e76945bc099d9c513d641e6ffc6c1b5e2b.\n. Mh\u2026 this looks like an issue with Firefox. Works for me at the moment, tho on my Mac. \nI just updated the gh-pages branch, which has another fix for the website. I don't really think this fixes the issue, but I will look into the Windows version of Firefox soon.\nThanks for reporting.\n. I've tested this on Firefox in Win XP and Ubuntu 12.10 now and it works perfectly for me. Which Linux distribution are you using?\nI gonna close this for now since it appears to be an edge case. Anyways it is always great to know about these.\nThank you so much for reporting the issue!\n. This might be related to #33.\n. Closed this with 928f183e18a88862f12e495926814feb60a4c323 for #33. \\o/\n. Thanks for the contribution. I've tried my best and cherry picked cross commits. It's modified in b959efc5ad62b5529aca6c8177a0ca1a0fef3d5c. Wheee!\n. It's currently hard to find a proper solution for Android and iOS that works. I will try to find a better solution for the next version.\n. Thanks for reporting. This is related to #31 and I will try to find a working solution.\n. Looks like the IE8 CSS hack influences IE9 and IE10 too.\n\n```\n// Internet Explorer 8\ndisplay: none\\9;\n\n&.is-active {\n    display: block\\9;\n}\n```\n\nI will try to work around this and find a better solution.\n. Found another solution. Please see commit message.\nThanks for the help and reporting this bug.\n. Just push the hash (ID of the modal) on load.\n\n```\nwindow.location.hash = 'the-modals-id';\n```\n\nRemember to check if another hash is already set.\n\n```\nif (!window.location.hash) {\n    window.location.hash = 'the-id';\n}\n```\n\nYou get the idea.\n. Would you guys think it makes sense to add a kind of gallery for this modal? I mean for the page only.\nShould be easy to do.\n. No worries man :) We could do this with some lines of JS but we would need all images in the proper size. I'll look into it :)\n. @matt-bailey Makes a lot of sense. Actually we had this issue before (on Twitter I think). Anyway I think gallery functionality is pretty easy doable. So I'm implementing this tonight :D\n. Nothing awesome, but it has a functionality now \\o/ Micro gallery, hehe.\nThanks again for the discussion, people.\n. Wow, thank you so much @4nduril! Great contribution.\n\nI am currently thinking of what would be the best way to include the LESS port. I am actually good with maintaining both versions. But I think it wouldn't be best to have both Sass and LESS next to each other in the main branch.\nThis is because:\n- I don't want to have both ports in the download of Bower\n- I don't want to get people confused with what to use\n\nThere are some ways to include the LESS port:\n- Use an extra branch\n- Maintain it in the main branch\n- Use an extra repository\n\nThe stuff that is currently missing to integrate the LESS port are\n- Tests\n- Grunt tasks\n\nI'd love to get some feedback to the aforementioned questions.\n\nAgain, thank you for taking the time to create this port.\n. Awesome work, @4nduril. Thanks again!\nWe now have a [`less`-branch](https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/tree/less). I will publish the less version with the 1.1.0 release I think which should be pretty soon. I will also add another Bower component `css-modal-less`.\n\nPlease let me know if you find any bugs or have more ideas on the LESS branch.\n. Yeah, sounds good to me too. Gonna test that soon and merge it.\n. Thank you so much @realmyst for checking this out. The PR is merged.\nI've had to update the addEventListener polyfill in 465daead421539fb52710d7455abbbbe6748211b in order to get the listeners working in IE 8. Hope this is everything. Guess we will get reports with the next version if otherwise. :)\n. @esanmiguelc Please see [this code](https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/blob/master/site/js/page.js#L52-L70) and check the implementation for the website. This isn't part of the modal tho.\n. Currently you can only do this by changing Sass/CSS. See [this line](https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/blob/master/modal.scss#L279).\nWe should move this text to an attribute on the close link it self I guess.\n. I'll keep this open until the data-attribute solution is in or at least researched.\n. Would suggest that too.\nYou can also use the skeleton as a JS template and replace the contents how you need them.\n. Just updated some stuff in your PR. Thanks :) It's now in!\n. Screenshot would be awesome. Sadly I don't own an iPhone 5. It works great on 4S (except the problems ok #31 and #32).\nDid you do any modifications to the modal? Code would be great too.\n. Thanks, Ben! Landed in d0648d5ac212735b8b78661b0c5038a5a2406d6f.\n. Thanks for fixing this behavior. I merged your commit in 5187b3ba514425ae01c84591f6d27505a5ace400.\n:beers: \n. Thanks! Can you please update the pull request and the SCSS file stead of the CSS file. Please also run grunt and the tests if you can. That would be great. :)\n. You can make the changes we need, then add them to the staging area with `git add *` and amend your last commit using `git commit --amend`. You can then adjust the message too (please make it more clear what you did in the message, you can even self-close this PR if you want to)\u2026 and then you need to force push to the branch you work on: `git push -f`.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions.\n. Please see the commit in a0712dda3291255b47da9cc1cf49ec75f9fb9b77. This tackles the problem in the right area.\nIt's important to add `-webkit-overflow-scrolling` to the content area. Otherwise the modal's content isn't scrollable in some cases. I've tested this on iOS 6.\nThanks anyways for giving this a try.\n. The fix landed. Thanks :)\n. Corrected in both places. Please see 414af6f. Thanks.\n\nFor further Pull Requests: Please be aware of the project's infrastructure and read the contributing guidelines in order to get your work into the project faster. Thank you so much for considering to help this project.\n. This PR doesn't have much other thinks compared to #45 than the inclusion in SCSS.\nI'll pass on this and look to interoperate the changes in #45.\n. Thanks for the effort. Please don't send any more PR.\nI'll figure out a way to incorporate the change as already stated.\n. This isn't an update of the PR. I've outlined how it works [here](https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/pull/45#issuecomment-20196817).\n. Awesome. Thank you.\n\nPlease be aware that it gets a little bit more complicated than just copying the stuff over. Please test implementations on mobile devices aso. But you know your way around it :P\nAlso you can throw this into wip-1.1.0.\n. Wheee. Done.\n. @SantzDesign Please don't spam the issues ;) See https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/issues/79#issuecomment-29006489 for more information.\n. From #64\n\n> I've changed my mind in so for that I think the LESS port should be maintained in another repo.\n> Here are the advantages:\n> - own build status for with Travis\n> - clear separation in PRs and issues\n> - own repo registered in Bower\n> \n> Any objections?\n. @4nduril Thanks for all your work again! I've decided to not include the LESS for within this project. Please register a project yourself and try to maintain it if you need to. I'll try my best to keep up with PRs for JS changes and stuff.\nSorry about that but it's not practical to maintain two separate repositories in order to be up to date with the latest from one or the other. The technology I chose for CSS Modal is Sass and I think this is currently the best fitting tool we can get for this project.\n\nThanks again to everyone included in the discussion.\n. Finally merged this. Thanks for the work.\n. Thanks for fixing this. It's in now.\n. Awesome! Thanks so much. Wanted to do this for v1.1.0 :) Will merge this into the wip-1.1.0 branch after checking it.\nThanks again.\n. It's in now, thanks again, @fabien-d! I will try to release 1.1.0 as soon as possible.\nPlease feel free to help improve CSS Modal further :)\n. Thanks for the effort you put into this pull request. I like the idea and I think this is something we could consider for 1.1.0.\nI'll leave this unmerged for now to look into this issue myself with the current implementation and the different animation styles we'd like to include (#51).\n\nThe problem with changing the background to a filter in IE could be that there are other quirks that come with it. Also I personally don't like to rely on filters. But I will look into this again :)\n. We've applied the changes as outlined in #73 for the new structure. Thanks again for providing the idea and valuable input :)\n. You can use set a hash via JS for opening a modal. I wouldn't encourage you to do this without the user knowing about it. It might be a bit arbitrary.\n\nPlease see #34 for implementation details.\n. Yup, sounds good to me. @jhabdas Thanks, can you please use a colon and recommit this with a description what this commit does (instead of \"Update modal.scss\"). This PR will get merged into wip-1.0.0 FYI.\n. Merged this with the changes! Thank you.\n. Thanks for using CSS Modal.\nYou can use the events by subscribing to them as if they were click events or something. Here is the code:\n\n```\n$(document).on('cssmodal:show', function (event) {\n    console.log(event);\n});\n```\n\nHope that helped.\n\nOn 28.08.2013, at 01:59, Robson Junior notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> I'm trying to call a custom function to stop my html5 video player but I don't know how to use the cssmodal:hide event.\n> \n> I'm using jQuery.

I will revisit this as soon as 1.1.0 is near finalization and will update with the latest changes.\n. I've changed my mind in so for that I think the LESS port should be maintained in another repo.\nHere are the advantages:\n- own build status for with Travis\n- clear separation in PRs and issues\n- own repo registered in Bower\n\nAny objections?\n. Oh and yea\u2026 the commits are in :) Thanks!\n. Great, that you got it working now :)\n\nI will close the issue now. Please re-open it, if there is another problem with this solution.\nWe will try to document this better and add a plugin for the functionality in v1.1.0. Please also see #63.\n. Thanks so much for bringing up this issue. With #58 we will be trying to make the modal more customizable and make it easier to use it with Bower.\n\nWe could use some help with defining the customizable variables in Sass \u2013 so if you are up for it we would be very thankful.\n. Thanks for your ideas.\n\nI am not sure where we should start with this.\nMaybe a structure like this would be great:\n\n``` javascript\n|-- components\n   |-- css-modal\n      |-- _modal-config.scss\n      |-- _modal-core.scss\n      |-- _modal-theme.scss\n      |-- modal.scss\n|-- scss\n   |-- _modal-config.scss\n   |-- main.scss\n```\n\nWhile `_modal-config.scss` in `css-modal` (Bower component) holds all of the modal's default configuration, maybe with a `!default` directive (might be needed). The `_modal-config.scss` file in `scss` holds all the custom overwrites we need. We could include a template for this in the package too.\n\n`main.scss` would have the following inclusions:\n\n```\n@import 'modal-config';\n@import '../components/css-modal/modal';\n```\n\nAll configuration in the local file overwrites the global defaults.\n\nWhat do you think? Does this make sense?\n. We use \"v1.0.0\" as our \"development\" branch atm. It would be awesome if you could create a branch from there and use the existing work in #58. You can then do a PR against v1.0.0 and we will review from there. Sounds good?\n. I've added a little bit of contribution guidelines in [CONTRIBUTE.md](https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/blob/master/CONTRIBUTE.md). Which information is missing?\n. I've updated the CONTRIBUTE.md file. Thanks for the discussion and your ideas. Was applied in #73.\n. I think we should not depend on these classes atm. But we can use CSS hacks for IE8 and we can utilize these maybe.\n\nWhat's the reason to have a 16x16px background image instead of a 1x1px? Optimized it has only 2 bytes more with 90% alpha channel though. I've added this in the commit above.\n. I will close this issue for now. We don't need a perfect support for IE8 since use is more and more fading. Apart from that: We've worked on this in the commits mentioned above.\n. @anselmh Is this related to what happens in branch `plugins`?\n. @grayghostvisuals Please have a look at #133 for 2). This might also be a solution for 1).\n. A css only variant would be nice too. But you can do this by overwriting\nsome values.\n\nThis implementation is a variant for when you want to set a width which\ncomes from a CMS or another user input.\n\nOn Tue, May 27, 2014 at 7:45 PM, Dennis Gaebel notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> if you all like it then I'm all [image: :+1:] for it.\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/drublic/css-modal/issues/68#issuecomment-44309585\n> .\n.

It has all modal styles we use.\n\nOn 18.09.2013, at 08:22, Louis Lazaris notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Sure, I'll see what I can do.

Thanks so much for the commit! Separation LGTM at the moment but need to have a closer look.\nPlease stick to one task and one task only for each PR as Anselm said.\n\nWe haven't discussed including Grunt plugins other than we have. We don't need the tasks that you included, it's just something that is opinionated and I don't think we should add to much of this stuff in there. We could try to remove something tho\u2026\n\n> Eventually some mixins and functions should be added to manage the complexity/prefix grossness of the transitions and animations etc. Maybe adding auto prefixer would be better suited and a more maintainable option going forward.\n\nWe don't want to add any complexity for developers. They should use it with Bower or just as a drop in, so there is no real space for prefixer or something. We had the [sass-mixins](https://github.com/drublic/Sass-Mixins) repo as dependency in the early stage of this project and this didn't proof to be a good way to integrate with existing websites.\n\nAgain, thanks for the great work. We really appreciate it :)\n. Sounds perfect :)\nIn case you didn't know: You can just update this commit via `git commit --amend` and `git push -f`.\n. Thanks for your work @grayghostvisuals. I've merged your changes into the wip-1.1.0 branch. Great stuff.\n. @anselmh I've fixed the comment.\n\n@SantzDesign Header and footer tags can be used for more than the header or footer section of the page. Please read the spec. I think we are good here.\n\nThanks for raising the issue and taking the time to look into this.\n. Legit. Thanks for the heads up.\n. It's in, but GitHub doesn't seem to recognize it. See 2ca9212c614f38e448b621c0383b20041176257e.\n. It is important this happens on mobile. At the moment I don't feel like this is a big issue but we should tackle it with 1.1.0.\n. Shipped this. Thanks, man!\n. @anselm-urban Does your bug still occur with the unstable version of CSS Modal?\n. Thanks for testing @anselmh.\n. :+1:\n. Thanks @anselmh!\n. Looks good to me :) Ship it.\n. This will be fixed with the new version. For the time being, please update the css-modal to v1.1.0-alpha.\n. Oops, sorry. The release is called `v1.1.0alpha`.\n. Closing this for now.\n. You can compile the code yourself by running `grunt sass:dist`. You can then find the file in the build directory.\nWe'll fix it.\n. Thanks for the suggestion. !default is really a cure to some evil package management brings to the front-end.\nFor 1.1.0 this is already done. Please see [_modal-config.scss](https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/blob/wip-1.1.0/_modal-config.scss).\n\nCheers, man! Keep it real.\n. Yes, please check the readme file or website.\n. @anselmh, is this already tested?\n. Thanks. Closed this now.\nPlease let us know if this does not work for you, @ultraflash.\n. Thanks. I've added the option. I like it. \nHave fun with it ;) :beer: \n. 1) Please see http://drublic.github.io/css-modal/#modal-embed. Works for me in Chrome. Firefox seems to be buggy.\n\n2) This seems to be a CSS issue with the general styling. Please try to check your CSS if this issue is still present.\n. We should utilize the custom events of CSS Modal. This is nothing that we\nshould add to the core, IMO, since not everybody uses video. There could be\na plugin snipped which adds the functionality.\n\nOn Wed, Jan 29, 2014 at 1:15 PM, Anselm Hannemann\nnotifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> I think there's a better way to do this.

Merged in 7eb21d3d7490152ef5f327aa73cc11550765def3. Thank you!\n. Thanks for this great contribution. Merged it in.\n. You are more than welcome :)\n. Can you please provide a test case for this scenario for us to figure out the problem? Thanks!\n. It works if you call http://www.appix.co.il/GitHub/#modal-text. I don't know why there is a handler on the link that prevents pushing the hash to the history. We cannot help you with this, sorry.\nPlease make sure modal.js is available in on your page.\n. This looks fantastic. I'll test this asap. We need to squash the commits before merging them in though.\n. Thanks. I've merged this and updated the variable at the \"correct\" position.\n. Thanks for reporting. We already tackled this problem in #83. It will be available with the next release.\n. I use a Wufoo form on drublic.de and it works quite well. Can you please provide a test case?\n. @charlespeters Can you please have a look at this again? Otherwise I will now close the issue.\n. No worries. Thanks for sharing your results.\n. `jQuery.brower` is nothing we use within the modal. Actually we don't use any jQuery at all. \nI think in this case it's not the modal's code that causes the effect you describe. We enforce that you cannot scroll the page if the modal is active.\nPlease make sure there are no other influences on the page that might be problematic for the modal (maybe try to remove other plugins).\n\nI am in favor of closing this issue but please let us know if there is a problem if you remove other code.\n. Thanks for replying and closing this issue.\n. @anselmh Is this something you want to work on?\n. +1\n. Would be awesome to have something like \"Queue\".\n. Not gonna happen.. This is because of the way CSS Modal works (without JS it needs the hash bang). We could add an option for this where you could deactivate the hash bang if JS is available.\n. @cyxou Currently there is no way to do this. We will tackle this in v1.2.0 and include a JS-only based behavior.\n. Done. Will be included within the next version.\n. @richie-y Is this issue still existing?\n. Thumbs bug. Gotta go and close this for the time being. Thanks everyone.\n. I've removed the text, since it is without value for this issue. Can you please let me know which OS you're using on the iPhone.\n. Sorry for the long wait. Currently I don't see any chance we will fix this. I don't know if this is a problem on our end or on iOS' but I think it might be the latter.\nIf you still have problems with iOS 8 please let us know.\n\nThanks so much for your time to report this problem.\n. Any results @anselmh?\n. Thanks for testing.\n. Merged, thanks. :)\n. See https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/commit/594bb89b47329124408e7d261e9a8b0addfefb92?w=0 for relevant changes.\n. Thanks for reporting this problem. Can you please try to use the latest version from master? This might work better.\nPlease let us know if the problem remains.\n. Is this problem resolved with #136 (current master)?\n. Closing this now. Please reopen if problem remains\n. @digitaljhelms I think this was a bug with libsass for quite some time now. They fixed it with version 3.0 which has a (couple of) RC at the moment.\nPlease try the version and let us know if your issue isn't fixed yet. I will definitely look into this now.\n\nConcerning versioning: This was a major failure by myself. We will switch to more semantic versions from now one. You will get the latest release which is 1.1.8 from bower since a couple of weeks.\n. In your CSS you might need to change\n\n```\n.modal-inner {\n    extend %modal;\n}\n```\n\nto \n\n```\n#modal-text {\n    @extend %modal;\n}\n```\n\nIt should look OK after that.\n. Closing this now. @Ziiweb, please let us know if this isn't solved for you yet.\n. Please see the gallery plugin. This is done now and you can find all of the requested features there.\n. Currently not. What is the problem of the current implementation?\n. I think this has to stay this way. You can overwrite the values in `_modal-theme.scss` in case it's needed.\nWhat exactly do you mean by more \"standard\" close button?\n. This is now part of branch `plugin-gallery`. Thanks.\n. Looks good to me. I've tested this in Chrome. Works.\n. Thanks for reporting. can you please provide a test-case?\n. Thanks for the update. It doesn't seem to be connected to the modal.\n\nPlease see the screenshot: It looks like it is connected to some facebook integration. Can you please recheck this?\n\n![screen shot 2014-05-22 at 18 20 42](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/502487/3056676/485faaa0-e1cd-11e3-85f3-57c344ff255d.png)\n. > Ok, I disabled the social button, but the error still remained for me http://joxi.ru/47d-U_3JTJC5MOFNJVI\n\nIf you look at the stack trace you can see that the bug comes from jQuery.simpleFAQ.js. I think the usage of both collides with each other.\n. We are currently looking into better IE8 support.\n\nPing @jonathanweiss.\n. @Tuning-Soft It seems I cannot open your website without IE8 crashing, which is why I can't figure out what the problem is. Can you please try to test with the `ie8-support` branch, please. Please make sure to disable all other libraries.\n\nI cannot reproduce this behavior with my tests.\n. I am going to close this for the time being. Please come back if the bug remains.\n. There is another bug about this behavior here: #186\nPlease check again with the current master version.\n. Thanks!\n. I've updated the pull request. If someone finds time over the weekend I'd be really happy :)\n. Updated. Thank you :)\n. Looks good to me. Can be merged.\n. Thanks for reporting. Seems to be a serious problem. Can you please provide a reduced test-case?\n. That's a good idea. I'll open a new issue about this.\n. Done in 1d13ac00ff05862c9f1893b74303e76fdc38de54. Also part of v1.2.0.\n. Looks good to me.\n. :+1: \n. Thanks.\n. Thanks for the work. The style-injection now seems to work in IE8.\nOnly problem: When the modal opens, the styles are not injected. When you resize the browser they are. Any chance you can look into this?\n. Will look into it for 1.2.0. If you find the time and have the knowledge, I'd appreciate input on the implementation (data-attribute\u2026).\n. Implementation done in #168. Please have a look.\n. Since it's done, i've closed this issue now.\n. Merged in d7f32ed. Thanks.\n. FIxed in 8068007. Thanks :)\n. Updated. Thanks for the heads up.\n. Sorry for the late response. There are stackable modals. Please see \"Demo Show\" and the link \"Stackable Modal\" inside index.html for a demo. Does this help with your issue?\n. It is also possible to use the modal directly in JS. You can find it within the custom data of the event.\n. Thanks you for reporting this. Good point and thanks for investigating. The fix made it into master in 78ef562 and will be in the next version.\n. Thanks for the report and sorry for handling this issue this late.\nThe latest master has some commits that might fix this issue. My tests with the visual test (`index.html`) indicate this although the background still scrolls if touch outside the modal.\n\nPlease let me know of your test results.\n. Please also see 3c66b9f027520e37fe78d6ae90e9eb190e18ec13. This should fix this issue mostly.\n. I could not reproduce this on Android 4.4 Chrome. To be honest, we don't support Mobile Safari on iOS 5. \nI would be really happy if you could open a Pull Request if you find a solution.\n. Done. Please see https://www.npmjs.org/package/css-modal.\n. Good point. It needs the class `modal--show`. Can you fix this with a PS please?\nUpdate: http://fiddle.jshell.net/r6weLcoj/2/\n. Merged in ce2001f78fb599761a10622982e1ef066284efb7! Thanks!\n. Thanks for reporting @stanggt3! Much appreciated. Can you please provide a reduced test case using JS Bin or something like that? Thank you.\n. I've found the problematic code and fixed it. Please let me know if this doesn't fix it for you.\n. Thank you so much for contributing back. This means a lot.\n\nIt is a very good pull request and works perfectly in Firefox and Chrome. Safari is a bit buggy, but we shouldn't care to much I think. I just had some minor syntax corrections which would be great if you could fix them :)\nAlso please add a note with the commit message to the change log please.\n\nThanks again.\n. > What is buggy in Safari ? Perhaps we could try to correct it ?\n\nIt looks like the focus isn't maintained within the modal. Maybe this is a bug on my end but might also be a problem with Safari.\n\nThe changes made it into master in 59fcdd3e0d92cc4c6a0ee05344486644074d0dab. Thanks so much again!\n. Ooops, forgot to update the issue. It's updated since a couple of weeks now.\n. Looks good to me. \n. Thanks. Merged in 122d54909d68f92d7c2b1d38958cf8bb325dbad8.\n. Thanks for reporting this.\nHave you included Bean as in [here](https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/blob/master/test/index.html)? It should be included before modal.js.\n\nI assume you did this already. So this is potentially a problem with the styling of the modal. Can you please have a look if the JavaScript works already? For example check if classes get applied to the HTML tag.\nIf this is the case can you please check if the modal in index.html is working for you? Otherwise we should check where there is a wrong behavior within the modal.\n\nThanks in advance for checking this.\n. Please see #167: We will switch to jQuery to enable people to use tools which are well known.\n. Closing this in favor of #167.\n. I am still thinking of using either Bean or jQuery in order to maintain backwards compatibility.\n. Thanks for looking into it. There are other error with IE8 which seem to be separate to this one.\nI will fix them.\n. Thanks for reporting, @Komald. We will look into this issue asap.\n. Just saw that this demo is using v1.0.1. Can you please check with 1.2.0 https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/blob/master/build/modal.css ?\n. That's just a problem with the wrong class: modals need .modal--show http://jsfiddle.net/seyfso6L/2/\n. So I've checked this again.\n\nCurrently the second modal opens \"stacked\" above the first one. This happens in IE9 and Chrome for me.\nIf you don't want this behavior, but want to open the first, then click, (close the first), open the second, close the second and be back at the page without any modal you might want to add `data-stackable=\"false\"` to the second modal's `section` element.\n\n**Edit:** Stackable modals don't seem to work according to my tests at the moment. I'll take care of this.\n. Stackable modals should be fixed now.\n. Closing this now. Please let me know if you have any problems with it.\n. Thanks for reporting. Closing in favor of #172.\n. Yes, `break-word` is not in the spec.\nFor `break-all` it says:\n\n> In addition to \u2018normal\u2019 soft wrap opportunities, lines may break between any two letters (except where forbidden by the \u2018line-break\u2019 property). Hyphenation is not applied. This option is used mostly in a context where the text is predominantly using CJK characters with few non-CJK excerpts and it is desired that the text be better distributed on each line.\n\nI don't think this is what we need here, right?\n\nPlease see the SO issue here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1795109/what-is-the-difference-between-word-break-break-all-versus-word-wrap-break\n\nI'd opt for leaving it as is.\n. Any more input? Otherwise I'll leave it as it is.\n. Ok, so you are right I think. We should implement both as the article suggests.\n\nCould you please update to:\n\n```\n-ms-word-break: break-all; // Needed for oldIE support, but words are broken up letter-by-letter\n     word-break: break-all;\n     word-break: break-word; // Non standard for webkit\n```\n\nand please remember to update the changelog :)\n\nThanks so much!\n. Thanks. I've changed your commits a bit and incorporated them into one.\nAgain, thanks for the update and the nice response times :)\n. Thanks for reporting this. Can you please check back with the latest commit in master? It should fix a couple of these issues. I could not reproduce this issue with the visual test in `index.html`.\n. Awesome. Thank you!\n. Please use a `z-index` lower than the modal's one (which is `999`) for the navigation. YouTube videos sometimes need an extra parameter or something like this. If you google for this problem: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3820325/overlay-opaque-div-over-youtube-iframe\n\nPlease include the JS on your page without looking at it any further. It should just work.\n. You can use the \"no-hash\" method. Just add a `data-cssmodal-nohash` to the link as seen [here](https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/blob/master/index.html#L41)\n\nPlease see if this works for you.\n. Thanks for reporting. I can reproduce this. Will try to look into it soon.\n. This works now. Probably because of #181. Please let me know if you run into any other bug.\n. Thanks.\n. > Thank for the very nice modal. Sorry for the noob quetions. I have a form inside of the modal with a submit button. How can I close the modal when the submit button is clicked.\n\nPlease just change the hash on submission. With jQuery this looks like this:\n\n```\n$('form').on('submit', function () {\n    window.location.href = '#!';\n});\n```\n\n> Also, how can I remove the close bar and button on the small screen.\n\nYou need to dig a bit deeper into the styles might take some time to do so.\n. Thanks. Good finding. I've merged your commit and added a test in index.html. Will be part of the next version.\n. @jgadbois Thanks for reporting. I could not find any bugs with the `hashchange` event. As @chilblane points out this might be some other script blocking the `hashchange` event.\n. Thank you for the quick feedback. I will close this issue. If you run into this behavior again, please let me know :)\n. Done. Thank you for the heads up.\n. On master in `index.html` all modals are loaded via ajax and the modal closes perfectly. Can you please try with the current version?\nCan you please also provide a reduced test case for this behavior?\n. Hi, thanks for the heads up and thanks for using CSS Modal.\n\nWe've build two plugins for that. Please see the plugins folder and search\nthe issues. We've already answered this, I think. I hope it helps :)\n\nPlease let us know if you need anything else.\n\nOn Mon, Apr 20, 2015, 3:41 PM droidsignage notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Both HTML5 and Youtube video keep playing after the modal has been closed.\n> How would I link the close function to stopping both video types?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/issues/185.\n. @tmpkco Please check out master and test index.html: css-modal/#modal-html5video.

    "anselmh": "True. Only max-width then.\n. You also probably be a bit more flexible using this additional line of code:\n\n```\n.modal-content {\n    max-height: 400px;\n    max-height: 70vh;\n}\n```\n\nAlthough vh should be 90vh to the whole modal I think. This 70vh is a quick fix for current base.\n. I am not sure if we should drop vh also in here as iOS has a problem interpreting vh in media queries\u2026\n. Found the solution. This is because the modal is small enough so Firefox removes vertical scrollbars.\nSolved by adding `overflow-y: scroll` but not sure if this should be prevented somehow in modal\u2026?\n. As I never again experienced this 'bug' and nothing was raised by other users here, I am closing this issue now. Please reopen with more details on which browser is affected if you can reproduce this.\n. @sebald Without knowing you exact problem I don't see a reason why this should result in an error. It's up to you how you name your modal's ID. If I misunderstood you, please can you elaborate on your issue?\n. I vote against. This is unexpected behavior for the user and should not be done in js. If aria is not used by developers this is a different problem which should be tackled other way.\n. Opera, Firefox on OS X working pretty fine. Browserstack can have issues on that kind of things as it's loading an embedded iframe with some delay which might not be awaited by browserstack.\n. I personally prefer the current (not PR) text except for the one sentence I commented on in diff. But this is just my opinion.\n. This also applies for Android Chrome and Opera 14.\n. As all related issues are closed, what's the status here?\n. Have you guys checked out branch [wip-1.1.0](https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/tree/wip-1.1.0) yet? This issue should be fixed already in the upcoming release. You can use this branch's code already although not all tasks for 1.1 have been finished.\n. @jme783 Thanks for reporting back. Then we need to investigate further here +@drublic.\n. It would be great if you could write down your working hack here then, so others can profit from it, too. :)\n. ```\nselector { \n    \u2026 \n    last-property: value\\0/; \n}\n```\n\nshould be enough.\n. Of course, sorry. Then you have to go the MQ way \n. Nope, this no bug, there is no interactivity on the example yet. I'm closing this for now but you're kindly invited to fork, edit and send a pull-request to add the feature you expected to see here.\n. Sorry for closing, @drublic. I do think it would make sense, yes.\n. I would prefer an extra branch over extra repository.\n. Valid PR and looks fine to me to be merged.\n. Can you provide the code example where it is not working?\n\nI cannot confirm the issue using IE8 (w/Flash as nothing else would work in IE8) and the demo video modal (http://drublic.github.io/css-modal/#modal-embed).\n. Hey, unfortunately jsfiddle itself seems to have no IE8 support. Viewing it as fullscreen jsfiddle-preview has the following result:\n- YouTube is displayed directly (without triggering the modal) \u2013 might be a Flash embed issue (wmode might be necessary)\n- The modal seems to not work at all. Do you use the latest code of the modal?\n\nTo properly debug this we would need the complete test case I think. You can also send this via e-mail if you don't want to have it public.\n. This might be related to Flash playback used in IE8. Not sure if this can be fixed.\n. Hi @richardatwork, could you provide a working example or at least a screenshot what error happens?\n. Well, I can confirm that somehow on my iPhone5 but this rather looks like a general issue with the site on mobile. Maybe another script is catching calls? I don't have the time to dig in deeper right now, sorry. Maybe in the next days\u2026\n. Looks good to me and makes sense to convert to hex code.\n. Thanks for the additional details. As I am able to confirm this, I now reopen the issue. A bugfix is coming soon! For the time being you can fix this by extending the `:target` selectors by:\n\n```\n&:target,\n&.is-active {\n    \u2026\n}\n```\n\nAs the `.is-active` class is set by the js this will then trigger your modal on load.\n. Damn you stole my feature request :D just wanted to propose this when I read the cordons article. If you want you can assign this to me and I'll try to do this in the next days\n. So we need to close down less-branch properly and separate this into a new repository. I therefore am changing the title according to the tasks.\n. Oh man, sorry I must have overseen this issue :(\nYou can adjust the modal height by changing the `.modal-content` `max-height: 70vh` value. This currently limits the height to 70% of the viewport height on Desktop. Ensure you are also updating the different values specified in several media-queries.\n\nIf this doesn't work for you, a working demo would be great for analyzing.\n. I am closing this issue now hoping you have solved the problem. If not, feel free to provide more details and reopen it. :)\n. Thanks for reporting and fixing (LGTM). I would prefer a colon instead because the `-` is not a true replacement but have no strong opinion on that and leave it to @drublic to decide. ;)\n. Hi @jimzar you can simply call the modal by targeting the id of the html element by the hash:\n\n```\nwindow.location.hash = 'modal';\n```\n. Fully agree on that.\n\n---\n\nAnselm\n\n> On 25.09.2013, at 10:14, Hans Christian Reinl notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> I've changed my mind in so for that I think the LESS port should be maintained in another repo.\n> Here are the advantages:\n> \n> own build status for with Travis\n> clear separation in PRs and issues\n> own repo registered in Bower\n> Any objections?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n.

Here are quite a few IE8- hacks listed: http://browserhacks.com/\n. Hey,\n\nregarding 1: Yes, definitely wanted but I do think we will need to shift this into 1.2.0 as this needs some more re-structuring in the code and 1.1 should be served as soon as possible now.\nregarding 2: Do you have a proposal how to handle this? It could be done with an data-attribute but I'm not sure if we want to do that as it shifts layout properties into html markup. But maybe you have a better solution how to handle that?\n\nThanks for your feedback! :)\n-Anselm\n. Well, be sure we will keep care of this (in my personal opinion right after 1.1 shipped). But I want to let the decision about the handling of this up to @drublic so let's wait what he says about this feature-request.\n. Hm\u2026 not directly. This issue is more about more manageable breakpoints but at least branch `plugin-resize` will tackle a bit of the problem.\n. Hi @SandraK, thank you for reporting this issue. I can reproduce this viewing your demo page but haven't had the time yet to look closer into the code you use.\nYou could try to use the css-modal from the v1.1.0 branch but I am not sure if this will fix it. I hope to find some time in the next days to have a closer look into the issue.\n\nThank you so much for your patience, I am very sorry that it took that long for a first reply!\n. The demo doesn't include CSS-Modal anymore. Therefore I am closing this issue as it's not reproducible anymore.\n. You need to move the `@keyframes` sections outside the `@media` section because IE10 gets mixed up by the 'nested @'. The call to keyframes can stay there. \n\nInteresting but this isn't our problem. It is simply we are not using the `-ms-` prefix in the transition. Thanks for reporting, we will fix this soon. For now simply add in before line 319 (https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/blob/master/modal.scss#L319) a `-ms-transition: opacity 0.4s;`.\n. Well, it would be awesome if you could look into it and report (or maybe send a PR rearding this on v1.1). :)\n. This works fine in my tests in IE10, 11 under WIN7 + WIN 8 with both, v1.0 and v1.1. Therefore closing this now.\n. Yeah, reading the docs from MS they confirm it works w/o prefix. Must have been a wrong information I got somewhere else. Therefore closing the PR. Thanks for reviewing and comments!\n. @alrra @impressivewebs you can read about this here as described by impressivewebs: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh673535(v=vs.85).aspx\n\n> Note  The properties and event described in this topic previously required a Microsoft-specific vendor prefix, \"-ms-\", to work with Internet Explorer 10 and Windows Store apps using JavaScript. This prefix is no longer required, but will still be recognized. To ensure compatibility in the future, applications using the Microsoft vendor prefix with transition properties should be updated accordingly.\n. Just had a quick look on it, here are my comments:\n- livereload is missing as dependency in package.json while it is called in Gruntfile.js\n- you have introduced a line-break issue at least in the package.json file (check the diff)\n  In general I would prefer to have different smaller commits and Pull-Requests, one for each task. This makes it more maintainable and easier to merge parts of it.\n  It would be great if you could fix the remaining issues first by amending the commit.\n. Hi, thanks for your comment but it seems the elements have been eaten by github. Can you fix that so we can see what tags you mean?\n. Hi,\n\nyou can see the details in #34. Be sure to use v1.1.0 branch for that as there landed a fix (#55) which will work better on pageload.\nPlease re-open if you still have problems with it.\n. You're welcome! :)\n\n---\n\nAnselm\n\n> On 10 Oct 2013, at 20:23, mard73 notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> Worked great!

I am closing this issue for now. Please report back here if you can reproduce this within a fresh browser.\n. Hi,\ncan you please elaborate what the misbehavior is here and in what IE versions it happens? From the screenshot I cannot really see the problem so it would be great if you could say what 'too big' means (by providing the calculated values or just a comparison screenshot).\nThank you for reporting this issue.\n. Hi, can you tell us what version you use here? Is it the master branch or wip-1.1.0? If it's the master branch, please check out the latest code from wip-1.1.0 and #70 and report back if it's solved or not with more details. \n. Thanks for your feedback. This is most probably due to the fact that the page uses the older version and it is likely already fixed in upcoming v1.1. Until I confirmed that, I'm leaving this issue open.\n. Hi @SantzDesign, they're already in the v1.1.0 branch. You can find them here https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/blob/wip-1.1.0/_modal-core.scss#L333 and use them. \n. Works fine (in my tests) so I'm going to close this issue now.\n. Sent a pull request with the changed naming here: #82 \n. I tested this in our basic visual test. Though I cannot speak for the given case (stated by the author) I think this should be fixed by the commit.\n. Hi, it's hard to follow your issues without seeing the code you use. Could you either provide us a link to the (non)working demo or create a jsbin?\n. The only issue I can confirm on the link you've sent is that the video doesn't stop when hiding the modal. This should be done with JavaScript. All other issues don't appear in the browsers I tested (Firefox, Chrome).\n. I'm going to close this now. The solution is to add the `?wmode=transparent` parameter to YouTube URLs so that video works within the modal if it is played through Flash.\n\nPlease re-open if this is not the correct solution and clarify.\n. Yes, this should be done in JavaScript IMO. It\u2019s a simple thing and should be added in a future version to improve video/audio support.\n. I think there\u2019s a better way to do this. Will dig into when finding some time, thanks for your report and quick solution.\n. Yes, think this would be a good idea. We also could provide one plugin for html5 video and another for the vimeo API then\u2026\n. There is a 404 error on the modal.js file so fixing that might probably fix your problem.\n. Now take this one. Fine now? ;)\n. Could you please elaborate which method to embed the Wufoo form you used and how you implemented it? Also, a demo / link to it would be very useful to track the issues down. :) Thanks!\n. This is a bit weird\u2026 do you use a tagged version or the latest master? Also, have you done some customizing in the scss?\n. Thanks, can you share a demo link of this? Also, could you see some issues looking into the Developer Tools of your browser that gives you a clue why this happens? Would help us a lot to track down the issue.\n. It\u2019s hard to say what went wrong here and I\u2019m not quite sure what the jQuery Migrate code does exactly (maybe this could also affect the modal though it shouldn't). Unfortunately I\u2019ll not be able to help you further without a fully reproducable page to have a look at. If you can provide such, I\u2019m happy to have a look at.\n. I'll see if I can do in the upcoming week but I'm in favor of only providing a small set of 1-2 effects for it to keep this maintainable and tiny.\n\n> On 12 Oct 2014, at 19:19, Hans Christian Reinl notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> @anselmh Is this something you want to work on?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. I guess your 1) is related to #32 and should be discussed over there. It would be great to have some more insight over there and maybe the demo link.\n\n2) I can't confirm that with your given link. Can you assure that still happens and if, in which browser and OS and where exactly so we can try to reproduce this?\n. Hi, I still can\u2019t reproduce any jumping behavior on your page (tested Mavericks + Firefox, Chrome, Safari). Also your description talks about 'jumping', about 'wrongly shown images'\u2014I can\u2019t confirm them on your test page. If these issues still exist on your side and you can eliminate that it\u2019s only a local problem on your computer, I'd be happy to see a short screencast so that we can know what you experience as issues. Otherwise it\u2019s bit hard to debug as we don\u2019t even know for sure what you experience.\n. Hi, it\u2019s an [1*1px png as dataURI](https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/blob/master/_modal-theme.scss#L61) that is used as overlay currently. You\u2019d need to replace this currently to change the color of it. But it\u2019s a good call and I\u2019m totally for making this more configurable\u2026\n. We should re test this behavior on the latest version of iOS I guess. I'll see if I can do in the upcoming week.=\n. So I couldn\u2019t reproduce this anymore in iOS8 and the current master from css-modal.\n.

Hi, thanks for the great feedback. We\u2019ll have a look at it and will definitely try to fix all the issues occurring with libsass.

You can do this with not too much effort by using another div or similar to apply the background to and then shifting the close button into the dialog. But it's unfortunately not something that could be offered as a direct option.\n. You can use stacked modals for it with which it should work by default: https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/blob/master/modal.js#L210\nOr you can call these methods manually listening to the custom events fired by CSS Modal.\n\nThird option, if you use it to display images or similar things, there\u2019s a gallery plugin in the plugins folder. This takes care of displaying a prev/next navigation and uses only one modal for the different contents.\n\nDoes that answer your question?\n.

I don't have the time to dig in deeper right now, sorry. Maybe in the next days\u2026\n. Looks good to me and makes sense to convert to hex code.\n. Thanks for the additional details. As I am able to confirm this, I now reopen the issue. A bugfix is coming soon! For the time being you can fix this by extending the `:target` selectors by:\n\n```\n&:target,\n&.is-active {\n    \u2026\n}\n```\n\nAs the `.is-active` class is set by the js this will then trigger your modal on load.\n. Damn you stole my feature request :D just wanted to propose this when I read the cordons article. If you want you can assign this to me and I'll try to do this in the next days\n. So we need to close down less-branch properly and separate this into a new repository. I therefore am changing the title according to the tasks.\n. Oh man, sorry I must have overseen this issue :(\nYou can adjust the modal height by changing the `.modal-content` `max-height: 70vh` value. This currently limits the height to 70% of the viewport height on Desktop. Ensure you are also updating the different values specified in several media-queries.\n\nIf this doesn't work for you, a working demo would be great for analyzing.\n. I am closing this issue now hoping you have solved the problem. If not, feel free to provide more details and reopen it. :)\n. Thanks for reporting and fixing (LGTM). I would prefer a colon instead because the `-` is not a true replacement but have no strong opinion on that and leave it to @drublic to decide. ;)\n. Hi @jimzar you can simply call the modal by targeting the id of the html element by the hash:\n\n```\nwindow.location.hash = 'modal';\n```\n. Fully agree on that.\n\n---\n\nAnselm\n\n> On 25.09.2013, at 10:14, Hans Christian Reinl notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> I've changed my mind in so for that I think the LESS port should be maintained in another repo.\n> Here are the advantages:\n> \n> own build status for with Travis\n> clear separation in PRs and issues\n> own repo registered in Bower\n> Any objections?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n.

Here are quite a few IE8- hacks listed: http://browserhacks.com/\n. Hey,\n\nregarding 1: Yes, definitely wanted but I do think we will need to shift this into 1.2.0 as this needs some more re-structuring in the code and 1.1 should be served as soon as possible now.\nregarding 2: Do you have a proposal how to handle this? It could be done with an data-attribute but I'm not sure if we want to do that as it shifts layout properties into html markup. But maybe you have a better solution how to handle that?\n\nThanks for your feedback! :)\n-Anselm\n. Well, be sure we will keep care of this (in my personal opinion right after 1.1 shipped). But I want to let the decision about the handling of this up to @drublic so let's wait what he says about this feature-request.\n. Hm\u2026 not directly. This issue is more about more manageable breakpoints but at least branch `plugin-resize` will tackle a bit of the problem.\n. Hi @SandraK, thank you for reporting this issue. I can reproduce this viewing your demo page but haven't had the time yet to look closer into the code you use.\nYou could try to use the css-modal from the v1.1.0 branch but I am not sure if this will fix it. I hope to find some time in the next days to have a closer look into the issue.\n\nThank you so much for your patience, I am very sorry that it took that long for a first reply!\n. The demo doesn't include CSS-Modal anymore. Therefore I am closing this issue as it's not reproducible anymore.\n. You need to move the `@keyframes` sections outside the `@media` section because IE10 gets mixed up by the 'nested @'. The call to keyframes can stay there. \n\nInteresting but this isn't our problem. It is simply we are not using the `-ms-` prefix in the transition. Thanks for reporting, we will fix this soon. For now simply add in before line 319 (https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/blob/master/modal.scss#L319) a `-ms-transition: opacity 0.4s;`.\n. Well, it would be awesome if you could look into it and report (or maybe send a PR rearding this on v1.1). :)\n. This works fine in my tests in IE10, 11 under WIN7 + WIN 8 with both, v1.0 and v1.1. Therefore closing this now.\n. Yeah, reading the docs from MS they confirm it works w/o prefix. Must have been a wrong information I got somewhere else. Therefore closing the PR. Thanks for reviewing and comments!\n. @alrra @impressivewebs you can read about this here as described by impressivewebs: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh673535(v=vs.85).aspx\n\n> Note  The properties and event described in this topic previously required a Microsoft-specific vendor prefix, \"-ms-\", to work with Internet Explorer 10 and Windows Store apps using JavaScript. This prefix is no longer required, but will still be recognized. To ensure compatibility in the future, applications using the Microsoft vendor prefix with transition properties should be updated accordingly.\n. Just had a quick look on it, here are my comments:\n- livereload is missing as dependency in package.json while it is called in Gruntfile.js\n- you have introduced a line-break issue at least in the package.json file (check the diff)\n  In general I would prefer to have different smaller commits and Pull-Requests, one for each task. This makes it more maintainable and easier to merge parts of it.\n  It would be great if you could fix the remaining issues first by amending the commit.\n. Hi, thanks for your comment but it seems the elements have been eaten by github. Can you fix that so we can see what tags you mean?\n. Hi,\n\nyou can see the details in #34. Be sure to use v1.1.0 branch for that as there landed a fix (#55) which will work better on pageload.\nPlease re-open if you still have problems with it.\n. You're welcome! :)\n\n---\n\nAnselm\n\n> On 10 Oct 2013, at 20:23, mard73 notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> Worked great!

I am closing this issue for now. Please report back here if you can reproduce this within a fresh browser.\n. Hi,\ncan you please elaborate what the misbehavior is here and in what IE versions it happens? From the screenshot I cannot really see the problem so it would be great if you could say what 'too big' means (by providing the calculated values or just a comparison screenshot).\nThank you for reporting this issue.\n. Hi, can you tell us what version you use here? Is it the master branch or wip-1.1.0? If it's the master branch, please check out the latest code from wip-1.1.0 and #70 and report back if it's solved or not with more details. \n. Thanks for your feedback. This is most probably due to the fact that the page uses the older version and it is likely already fixed in upcoming v1.1. Until I confirmed that, I'm leaving this issue open.\n. Hi @SantzDesign, they're already in the v1.1.0 branch. You can find them here https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/blob/wip-1.1.0/_modal-core.scss#L333 and use them. \n. Works fine (in my tests) so I'm going to close this issue now.\n. Sent a pull request with the changed naming here: #82 \n. I tested this in our basic visual test. Though I cannot speak for the given case (stated by the author) I think this should be fixed by the commit.\n. Hi, it's hard to follow your issues without seeing the code you use. Could you either provide us a link to the (non)working demo or create a jsbin?\n. The only issue I can confirm on the link you've sent is that the video doesn't stop when hiding the modal. This should be done with JavaScript. All other issues don't appear in the browsers I tested (Firefox, Chrome).\n. I'm going to close this now. The solution is to add the `?wmode=transparent` parameter to YouTube URLs so that video works within the modal if it is played through Flash.\n\nPlease re-open if this is not the correct solution and clarify.\n. Yes, this should be done in JavaScript IMO. It\u2019s a simple thing and should be added in a future version to improve video/audio support.\n. I think there\u2019s a better way to do this. Will dig into when finding some time, thanks for your report and quick solution.\n. Yes, think this would be a good idea. We also could provide one plugin for html5 video and another for the vimeo API then\u2026\n. There is a 404 error on the modal.js file so fixing that might probably fix your problem.\n. Now take this one. Fine now? ;)\n. Could you please elaborate which method to embed the Wufoo form you used and how you implemented it? Also, a demo / link to it would be very useful to track the issues down. :) Thanks!\n. This is a bit weird\u2026 do you use a tagged version or the latest master? Also, have you done some customizing in the scss?\n. Thanks, can you share a demo link of this? Also, could you see some issues looking into the Developer Tools of your browser that gives you a clue why this happens? Would help us a lot to track down the issue.\n. It\u2019s hard to say what went wrong here and I\u2019m not quite sure what the jQuery Migrate code does exactly (maybe this could also affect the modal though it shouldn't). Unfortunately I\u2019ll not be able to help you further without a fully reproducable page to have a look at. If you can provide such, I\u2019m happy to have a look at.\n. I'll see if I can do in the upcoming week but I'm in favor of only providing a small set of 1-2 effects for it to keep this maintainable and tiny.\n\n> On 12 Oct 2014, at 19:19, Hans Christian Reinl notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> @anselmh Is this something you want to work on?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. I guess your 1) is related to #32 and should be discussed over there. It would be great to have some more insight over there and maybe the demo link.\n\n2) I can't confirm that with your given link. Can you assure that still happens and if, in which browser and OS and where exactly so we can try to reproduce this?\n. Hi, I still can\u2019t reproduce any jumping behavior on your page (tested Mavericks + Firefox, Chrome, Safari). Also your description talks about 'jumping', about 'wrongly shown images'\u2014I can\u2019t confirm them on your test page. If these issues still exist on your side and you can eliminate that it\u2019s only a local problem on your computer, I'd be happy to see a short screencast so that we can know what you experience as issues. Otherwise it\u2019s bit hard to debug as we don\u2019t even know for sure what you experience.\n. Hi, it\u2019s an [1*1px png as dataURI](https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/blob/master/_modal-theme.scss#L61) that is used as overlay currently. You\u2019d need to replace this currently to change the color of it. But it\u2019s a good call and I\u2019m totally for making this more configurable\u2026\n. We should re test this behavior on the latest version of iOS I guess. I'll see if I can do in the upcoming week.=\n. So I couldn\u2019t reproduce this anymore in iOS8 and the current master from css-modal.\n.

Hi, thanks for the great feedback. We\u2019ll have a look at it and will definitely try to fix all the issues occurring with libsass.

You can do this with not too much effort by using another div or similar to apply the background to and then shifting the close button into the dialog. But it's unfortunately not something that could be offered as a direct option.\n. You can use stacked modals for it with which it should work by default: https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/blob/master/modal.js#L210\nOr you can call these methods manually listening to the custom events fired by CSS Modal.\n\nThird option, if you use it to display images or similar things, there\u2019s a gallery plugin in the plugins folder. This takes care of displaying a prev/next navigation and uses only one modal for the different contents.\n\nDoes that answer your question?\n.

Unless, of course, directing me is a bigger liability than actually documenting the issue :)\n. Hi,\nI just ran into this issue and solved it. CSS Modal guys use the following technique to stop video when modal is closed (pseudocode): \n- on hide event: store iframe source into data-src attribute, then set src to empty string\n- on show event: check if iframe source is empty, then restore it from data-src attribute\n\nThe problem is, they only planned for ONE video on the page, so they use the following selector to catch the iframe:     var $video = $('.semantic-content iframe'); \n\nNow we need to only catch the currently displayed video, so I tried to modify the selector to:\n    var $video = $('.semantic-content.is-active iframe');\n\n...but it didn't work, because \"is-active\" class is removed BEFORE the event is fired. So we have to iterate through all videos and stop all of them.

This is the Problem part.\n\n```\n.semantic-content {\n  -webkit-transform: translate(0, 100%);\n  -moz-transform: translate(0, 100%);\n  -o-transform: translate(0, 100%);\n  -ms-transform: translate(0, 100%);\n  transform: translate(0, 100%);\n  -webkit-transform: translate3d(0, 100%, 0);\n  transform: translate3d(0, 100%, 0);\n}\n\n.semantic-content:target {\n  -webkit-transform: translate(0, 0);\n  -moz-transform: translate(0, 0);  \n  -o-transform: translate(0, 0);\n  -ms-transform: translate(0, 0);\n  transform: translate(0, 0);\n}\n```\n\nOne of the solution is to add at the end of Youtube Link `?wmode=transparent`\n.
