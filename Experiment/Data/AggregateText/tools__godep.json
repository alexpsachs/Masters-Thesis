    "kr": "Makes sense. I was planning to add this as a command called `godep diff`\n. Finding dependencies is important for all godep's commands. But it's easier than that. Just run `go list -json`.\n. I updated the description for the diff command.\n. Agreed. Current thinking is a `godep restore` to mirror `save`.\n. Thanks for this patch! I think it's essentially superseded by the newer\njson format of Godeps, but if you still think this issue is relevant please\nfeel free to reopen or send another PR.\n. Merged in 9ab667fc969c31320428ca4667729b017954e709.\n. Closing in favor of #2.\n. One piece to the solution for this:\n\nThe `godep go get` command should always have the same effect\nas `godep go install`. The only case where they're different is\nif some dependencies are missing from the Godeps list. So I'm\nplanning to make `godep go get` an error.\n. The `godep go get` part was done in 05aebf24b176dbbbd9bcff56ee4ce000009fa5b1.\n. The remaining part of this is to check that there are no\ndependencies missing from the Godeps list.\n. Yes, this is still desired!\n\nIdeally we can move toward rewriting import paths, which would make the 'godep go' command superfluous. However, even then I think we'd want a way to check that everything is correct, that:\n1. all dependencies are listed\n2. the code that exists in Godeps/_workspace matches exactly the listed commit\n\nThe diff command described in issue #1 would cover at least the first item above, and maybe it could do the second item as well, perhaps under a flag.\n. This looks great. I don't want to reimplement package vcs.\nWe use it for a few things:\n- detect which VCS to use\n- find the repo root\n- find the remote url\n\nDoing these things correctly means matching the go tool's\nbehavior, including everything described in `go help remote`.\n. It looks like you might be working outside of a standard\nGo workspace. What happens when you run `go list` in\nthat directory?\n\nSee http://golang.org/doc/code.html for an introduction\non setting up a workspace.\n. Good idea, I've edited the readme: 603a348b365409e4ed7d50e3d8002dc8152afd8b.\n\nIn general, it's probably good to be in the habit of using a standard\nGo workspace for all development. That makes it easier to work\nwith other people and utilities, as more and more things work with\nthis assumption, such as the go tool and godep.\n. Note that with `godep save -copy`, explicit bzr support is unnecessary.\n. I was wrong, there are a couple of VCS-specific things godep does\nin the save command:\n- get the current commit id (e.g. git rev-parse HEAD)\n- describe the current commit (e.g. git describe)\n- ensure there are no uncommitted changes (e.g. git diff HEAD)\n\nhttps://github.com/kr/godep/blob/master/vcs.go#L36-L38\n\nThese should be easy to add bzr support for.\nI'll give this a shot today.\n\nThe other commands in that file vcs.go are the ones that\ncan be circumvented by -copy, and, in a happy coincidence,\nthose are the ones I would have trouble doing in bzr.\n. @ardan-bkennedy please give this another try! :)\n. What happens when you run this?\n\n```\n$ cd /Users/bill/example/src/labix.org/v2/mgo\n$ bzr status\n```\n\nThis tool uses `bzr status` to decide if any changes have been\nmade to the checked-out copy of each package. If the working\ntree is dirty, the revision number will be wrong (since it won't\naccount for any changes in the working tree since the last\ncommit), so godep will refuse to use that dependency.\n\nYou could also try:\n\n```\n$ rm -rf /Users/bill/example/src/labix.org/v2/mgo\n$ go get labix.org/v2/mgo\n$ godep save -copy\n```\n. All software has bugs. The idea is for godep to do the\nright thing in the common case. When the user runs\n'go get', followed by 'godep save' or 'godep save -copy',\nit should just work.\n\nI'll open another bug for this.\n. Just opened #15.\n. Yes. Using the `godep go` command workflow will be unchanged.\n\nI'd also like to improve the case when you're initially fetching and\nbuilding a godep-using project, but that's a separate issue.\n. One nice ancillary benefit of flag -copy, the Heroku buildpack will\nbe able to skip installing all VCS systems (hg and bzr).\n. This was done in f44942b5afbe2c9d1ce5f4047dcde6b61e3b69ab.\n. Yes! I've been meaning to open an issue for this for a while.\n\nThanks for bringing this up!\n\nI think it should be called `godep get`, since it has to do more\nthan just invoke the go tool in a sandbox. The behavior I'm\ncurrently imagining, for the command `godep get foo`:\n1. It runs `go get -d foo`\n2. It runs `cd $(go list -f {{.Dir}} foo) && godep go install foo`\n. See also #6.\n. I edited the description above to say \"godep get\".\n\nBut if you really like the \"godep go get\" form (or something else),\nplease say so. I'm very much open to bikeshed painting. :)\n. It's not quite as simple as the two steps I described above, because\nthe arguments might specify multiple packages. So it would probably\nhave to expand the package list first, then do those two steps for\neach package (and maybe this could be optimized to avoid redundant\nwork).\n. I also want \"godep get\" to to The Right Thing even if the specified package\ndoesn't use godep at all. It should gracefully fall back to behaving equivalently\nto whatever \"go get\" does.\n. This should be fixed now.\n\ncc @ardan-bkennedy, does this work correctly for you now?\n. Awesome, thanks :)\n. Awesome, thanks for the report!\nShould be fixed now.\n\nA couple of things puzzled me about the initial report:\n- My version of go get (Go version 1.1.2) doesn't have `-t` flag. I removed that flag and successfully reproduced the issue.\n- It's a little unusual to specify a full import path (github.com/globocom/tsuru/provision/docker) on the godep save command line. Did you do that just for the sake of reporting this issue, or do you intend to use it that way for the real project?\n. That is a bug. Thanks for the report!\n. > If you have dependencies that are also not gettable (but in the local workspace), you get the same \"unrecognized import path\" error\n\nInteresting. I opened #18 to track this.\n. Note that, even currently, the dependencies don't have to be _publicly_ available,\nas long as RepoRootForImportDynamic succeeds for the person running godep save.\n. We could also write our own version of RepoRootForImportPath that\nonly uses the local filesystem (looking for sentinel directories .git, .bzr,\netc). This would require the package to be present locally, but we already\nrequire that anyway.\n. Nice, FromDir will help a lot. I didn't notice that before.\n. The push that closed this issue was a mistake.\nI'm waiting for a reply on pull request #20 first.\n. > If I use godep to manage my dependencies, what happens if my dependencies also happen to use godep to manage their own dependencies?\n\nTheir Godeps list will be ignored in your project. You decide\nwhich version to use of all transitive dependencies.\n\n> And what happens if such a third party package decides to use -copy and include its dependencies in its repo?\n\nYou'll get one copy of each transitive dependency,\nbut not the copies, if any, that intermediate packages\nhave vendored.\n\nThis is because godep and the go tool skip directories\nstarting with `.` and `_`. Specifically, the directory\nGodeps/_workspace will be skipped when godep is\ncopying source code into your project.\n. This looks really nice!\n. This is merged in d91fda717ffef4017f4c7376efcc997df97b24b1. Thanks!\n. Yeah I tend to agree \u2013\u00a0it's easy to turn `godep run` into an interactive shell, but not so nice the other way around.\n. It's possible you were unlucky enough to pull godep after d91fda717ffef4017f4c7376efcc997df97b24b1\nbut before fb07940c7669536d2f5c49b8a368fa91883b9ef6. Godep should ignore all packages given on the\ncommand line (count them as \"seen\").\n\nDo you mind updating and trying again?\n\nIf it's still broken then yes, something else is going on that needs\nto be fixed.\n. Oh, I see. The problem is that `go list ./...` doesn't include `github.com/bitly/nsq`.\nGodep tries to work with repo roots so we don't get two entries for the same repo:\n\n```\n        {\n            \"ImportPath\": \"github.com/lib/pq\",\n            \"Rev\": \"f5dbc67a0263fbfffeb80970e47d589783d62854\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"ImportPath\": \"github.com/lib/pq/oid\",\n            \"Rev\": \"f5dbc67a0263fbfffeb80970e47d589783d62854\"\n        }\n```\n\nInstead, we want just one entry:\n\n```\n        {\n            \"ImportPath\": \"github.com/lib/pq\",\n            \"Rev\": \"f5dbc67a0263fbfffeb80970e47d589783d62854\"\n        },\n```\n\nI think to fix this problem, we should revert d7319384365b73b6f26efa402f0aa568e1539278 but use\nVCSFromDir instead of VCSForImportPath as a better fix for #17.\n(This is the same way we fixed #18.)\n\nI'll do that this afternoon unless you beat me to it.\n. Done! Thanks. :)\n. @mreiferson and @fsouza, do you mind trying out this fix?\n\nI tested it myself on github.com/bitly/nsq and it seems to do the right thing.\nI also tested it on an internal project that exhibited the \"lib/pq and lib/pq/oid\"\nduplicate entry problem described in #22, and it does the right thing there\nas well.\n. You can vendor the code, but you need to make a commit first,\nso there's a way to identify exactly what you've vendored.\nYou can push this commit to your fork of the package if you want,\nbut that's not necessary.\n. I'd like to make a blog post or something soon describing how\nto do this and other common tasks with more fleshed-out\nexamples. The instructions in the readme are perhaps too terse.\n. One of the big benefits of godep's vendoring is that you can\nmaintain a fork without changing import paths. But this is really\na separate issue. You don't need a fork.\n\nAll you have to do is commit your change locally, then godep\nwill happily vendor the code.\n\n```\n$ cd /path/to/package && git commit -a -m 'fix bug'\n```\n. The save command arguments are packages, not files,\njust like most of the go tool commands. What happens\nwhen you run 'go list app/tmp/main.go'?\n\nTry this from the root:\n\n```\n$ godep save ./...\n```\n\nOr perhaps\n\n```\n$ godep save ./app/tmp\n```\n\n(On a slightly tangential note, putting a main package in\na directory called 'tmp' will give you a binary named 'tmp'.\nIs that what you want?)\n. I'm going to close this issue; it seems to be resolved in https://github.com/kr/godep/issues/24#issuecomment-28250406.\n\nIf saving dependencies for a revel project continues to be a problem,\nlet's open a separate issue for that.\n\nBTW, thanks so much for all this feedback. It's a huge help in making\ngodep correct and robust in many situations.\n. Awesome! Thanks again for the help. :)\n. Something similar was addressed in #23 and #22.\nDo you mind updating your copy of godep and trying again?\nSorry for the trouble.\n\n```\n$ go get -u github.com/kr/godep\n```\n. Where did you run the `godep save` command?\nWhich project or package was it?\n. Bear in mind that Godeps.json doesn't just list the direct dependencies\nof your project, it lists all transitive dependencies. Both packages sqs\nand aws are dependencies of your package, but as you've observed,\nwe only include one entry for each repo, and the choice is arbitrary\n(currently alphabetical). Neither one is right or wrong; they're both\ndependencies of your project.\n\nWould you feel more comfortable with `github.com/crowdmob/goamz`\nas the path listed in Godeps.json? I've been thinking about making\nthat change. (Arguably the name ImportPath is no longer correct,\nsince it can be a directory with no .go files, as in this case.)\n. And, you're welcome! :)\n. My apologies, I misunderstood the problem here.\n\nThe save command needs to copy _both_ packages aws\nand sqs, and it's only copying aws. Yes, I think the simplest\nsolution is to move to using the repo root for both the json\nentry and the path to copy in.\n. If you'd like to update this pull request to use the repo root\n(but keep the json field name \"ImportPath\" for now), go for it.\nOtherwise I'll take care of it.\n. Cc @goinggo you were interested in this issue as well.\nIt should be fixed. Please reopen or open a new issue\nif you still see problems.\n. That's it. I haven't managed to define all the vcs operations for bzr.\n\nThe existing sandbox code is \"clever\", and uses operations that\ndon't map well across different vcs's. It would probably be good\nto redo that to use only the operations already defined in\ncode.google.com/p/go.tools/go/vcs.\n. Ah yes, thanks.\n. This looks like a duplicate of #27.\n. You can use `godep restore` to set up your gopath for\ndevelopment with the go tool (so you don't have to\nprefix every command with 'godep'). Then your\nworkflow can look like this:\n- Change P; run P's tests.\n- Run your tests, to make sure the change is what you really want.\n- Commit the changes to P.\n- `godep save` to copy over the final changes.\n. Sure, a PR would be great. As much as possible, I'd like to match\nthe style and conventions of the go tool's help text.\n\nFor example, it consistently uses 'download' to mean putting source\ncode into $GOPATH/src and 'install' to mean putting binaries into\n$GOPATH/{pkg,bin}. The godep restore help uses 'install' to mean\nputting source code into $GOPATH/src, so we should fix that usage.\n\nAnd you're absolutely right, we need to be more clear about where\ncode is going to be installed, since unlike the go tool there are two\npossible places.\n\nTo clear this up will probably require revising help text of several\ncommands for consistent usage:\n\n```\n    save      list and copy dependency code into Godeps\n    path      print sandbox path for use in GOPATH\n    restore   download listed dependency versions to GOPATH\n```\n\n\u2026or something like that.\n. I changed the issue summary to reflect this discussion.\n. We shouldn't add new commands for every random tool\nthat people come up with. If the existing `godep path`\ncommand isn't sufficient, then we should make either\n`godep run` or `godep shell` and be done with it.\n. I'll go ahead and close this issue as a duplicate of #21.\n. Hey @davecheney and @mreiferson, could I ask for a\nquick review of this? Thoughts?\n\nBasically this gives a more tightly focused set of dependency\npackages at the cost of more entries in the manifest.\n\nDo you like this change? Or prefer the current way?\n. As an example, before this change, importing package\n`github.com/crowdmob/goamz/sqs` would result in one json entry:\n\n```\n        {\n            \"ImportPath\": \"github.com/crowdmob/goamz\",\n            \"Rev\": \"9bee4d46f8a986ae73c9c05e7359e940f9ffa80c\"\n        },\n```\n\nAnd that entire repo would be copied, including all its packages:\naws, cloudwatch, dynamodb, ec2, elb, exp, iam, s3, sqs, and testutil.\n\nWith this patch, you get two entries:\n\n```\n        {\n            \"ImportPath\": \"github.com/crowdmob/goamz/aws\",\n            \"Rev\": \"9bee4d46f8a986ae73c9c05e7359e940f9ffa80c\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"ImportPath\": \"github.com/crowdmob/goamz/sqs\",\n            \"Rev\": \"9bee4d46f8a986ae73c9c05e7359e940f9ffa80c\"\n        },\n```\n\nand only those two directories, aws and sqs, are copied.\n. Interesting point about the commit ids getting out of sync.\nI hadn't considered that explicitly. I think it's out of scope\nfor godep. After all, there are countless other ways things\ncould get out of sync, if people are editing them by hand.\nThe code could change, the commit id could simply be\nwrong, etc. As long as the json contents are generated by\n'godep save', I don't see how they could get out of sync.\nI'm inclined not to worry much about it.\n\nThe possible implication that they might _correctly_ diverge\nis a little more troubling. Not sure what to do to combat that\nfalse impression.\n\nI did think about putting a list of import paths inside the\nentry for a dependency, but went with this approach because\nit's a smaller change (and requires no changes to logic that\nconsumes the list), and out of a vague desire to keep the\nstructure flatter, with fewer optional or alternative fields,\nand not overdo the DRY impulse.\n\nI want it to be at least within the realm of possibility to\nconsume Godeps.json with things like [jq](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/) and shell\nscripts. So the flatter and more regular the better.\n. I hope we never have to make incompatible changes.\nAnd I hope the godep implementation doesn't have to\nget very much bigger or different. Ideally it will soon\nsettle into something that feels right.\n\nIf godep turns out to be fundamentally or drastically\nwrong, I'd probably rather start over with a separate\ntool with a different approach.\n\nMaybe there will arise a change we want to make that\nfits well within the godep approach but would best be\ndone as an incompatible format change (such as the\nsuggested list-of-paths approach in #35). Maybe we\ncan put this issue off until we're forced to address it.\nCan we get away with that?\n. Excellent, thanks!\n. I'm going to close this issue. Feel free to reopen it\nif there's still godep behavior that seems to be wrong.\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. Confirmed. This is a bug.\n. Yes, this is a serious bug. I'm away from my home country right now with limited internet and no real computer, so I can't properly test and verify the fix. I'll take a look at #46 and probably just merge it in the interest of expediency. Any non-fatal problems with the patch can be fixed later.\n. If restore fails to download a missing package, that's a bug.\nThis is related to #41 and should have been fixed in 6eb924d67ab5588a788376e7d8996f120998abf3.\n\nIf this is still a problem, please reopen.\n. Can you provide the actual error message you see?\nI don't immediately see why this wouldn't work.\n\nWhat happens when you run `go list -json` instead of `godep save`?\n. (My apologies for the delay. I was on out of the country\nwith limited computer access.)\n. It seems like you are trying to recreate some of the functionality of godep by hand. Why not just use godep?\n. > `go list -json` returns what you'd expect (failure)\n\nGodep assumes that you're in a standard Go workspace. That's a fundamental assumption and not likely to change. In particular, if the go tool itself doesn't work in your environment, then godep definitely won't work.\n. As you say, the go tool commands other than 'go get' don't care where you put the .git directory, and this is because they don't interact with git (or any other VCS) at all. However, godep interacts with git quite a lot, even more than go get, and I've chosen to support the most common convention, the same one that 'go get' encourages: repos that live inside subdirectories (typically domain names) of src.\n\nI don't see why you wouldn't be able to follow this convention too.\n\nTry something like this, mashing up both of your examples:\n\n```\n/home/user\n    src\n        company\n            branch\n                .git\n                ops\n                ansible\n                cpp\n                go/proj1\n                go/proj2\n                Makefile\n                README\n                whatever\n```\n\nIn your shell .profile, set `GOPATH=/home/user`.\n\nThen you can `cd ~/src/company/branch` and run `godep save ./...` to freeze all your dependencies for the entire organization in one repo, alongside non-go code. A typical import path for one of your go projects will be company/branch/go/proj1. Optionally, omit the 'go' directory level and make your import paths company/branch/proj1. Also optionally, instead of 'company/branch' you can use a valid domain name and path for your organization, and then the repo will be go-gettable.\n\n> I'm not sure i understand your comment about it not being a standard go workspace.\n\nAll I said was that if 'go list' doesn't work, then certainly godep won't work. But I don't think you meant to focus on the example you gave where that's the case.\n. @dickeyxxx I wasn't able to reproduce the error you describe.\n\nHere's what I get:\n\n```\nume:~ kr$ go get github.com/dickeyxxx/martini-godep\nume:~ kr$ cd src/github.com/dickeyxxx/martini-godep\nume:martini-godep kr$ godep save\nume:martini-godep kr$ \n```\n. Ok well, it's true that godep interacts with the VCS a lot, but this particular case was a little excessive. Does #107 solve this issue?\n. After more thought, I have what I think is a better approach in #108.\n\nI'd love to know if that solves the issue here.\n. Thanks for the minimal test case. This still isn't working because godep tries to keep track of which packages are subdirectories of other packages by the import path, but the import path of the root looks like `_/home/rich/dev/godep_example/src` and therefore `github.com/rliebling/main` looks like it's not contained in the same tree.\n\nI think we might be able to do this in terms of filepaths instead. I will try.\n. I'm continuing to work on this, but I should reiterate that I _strongly_ recommend you set up a single GOPATH for your computer and put the git repos inside it. It will make your life easier.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/bketelsen/status/456036577010270208\n. Please note the example in http://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces depicts repo roots _inside_ subdirectories of src. That's not an accident.\n. It still seems like you should be able to accomplish all you describe, including the docker and vagrant stuff, with the example layout I proposed [above](https://github.com/tools/godep/issues/43#issuecomment-51306728). I think you can include docker stuff to help out people with the go bits of a non-go project while the repo layout fits inside a standard go workspace. Then people will have the option of using either standard go tooling or the special container tooling you describe.\n\nIf your developers ever have other go projects they want to work on, then the layout with a src directory inside the repo will cause them trouble\u2014they'll have to start switching their GOPATH depending on whether they're working on this particular project (or else they'll have to use the special Makefile or Dockerfile or whatever build procedure in this project instead of using the standard Go tools). But perhaps that is YAGNI.\n\nRegardless, it seems like you are creating extra work for yourself here. Many people use docker or vagrant for a standardized build environment for Go and other languages, but usually the developers end up cloning the project to work on from inside the container, or the container does this automatically. Once you're inside the container, you can do whatever's best for whatever language you're working with at the moment, since it's so easy to set up for new people. They can use standard C makefiles, standard go tooling, a uniform JVM version, whatever.\n. @rliebling that's totally fair. :)\n\nIt's possible my next change (mentioned [above](https://github.com/tools/godep/issues/43#issuecomment-51673270)) will make this work for you. If not, my apologies.\n. If the working tree is dirty, godep ought to refuse to save outright.\n. Regardless of how the working tree is dirty (changed files,\nuntracked files, whatever), godep should refuse to save.\n\nIf it used a fresh checkout, then you'd be saving something\nthat doesn't match what you had been using to test, before\nyou ran godep.\n\nI'll try to fix this. Is there a git command that can report\n(ideally by exit status) whether the tree is dirty?\n. I have a possible fix in cb8be8bb6e8475bff5bc30b1d1aa68174bb152e1. Does that patch do something reasonable for you?\n. Thanks. I don't know if I'll be able to fix this before\nI go on vacation, but hopefully you can get by with\nthe workaround for a few weeks.\n. Awesome. A reproducible test case makes this so much easier! Thanks.\n. That is a relief. I'll go ahead and close this issue now. If folks come asking about it in the future we can direct them to update to Go 1.5.\n\n@freeformz \n. This isn't the right place to do this. If the package doesn't exist\nin the filesystem, LoadPackages should say so. Setting Root\nto an element of GOPATH yields false information.\n\nBug #41 is fixed in 6eb924d67ab5588a788376e7d8996f120998abf3.\n. What problem is this meant to solve?\n. I agree a version command would be useful for people.\n\nThe main difficulty I have with this approach is having to remember to bump the version string for pretty much every single commit. This is necessary since the main way to install godep is with 'go get', and there's little reason to distribute infrequent tarballs or anything like that.\n\nIf necessary I guess I could just suck it up and deal with that, but I'm trying to think of other solutions that don't have that drawback.\n\nAny ideas?\n. Agreed, I'd like this case to work better, but I'm not convinced this patch is the best approach. My gut feeling is there's a way to make godep do the right thing without a flag.\n\nFirst, I'd argue your project _does_ follow the directory naming conventions for Go as described in http://golang.org/doc/code.html. You'll note that document doesn't require the repo root to be beneath the src directory, that's only the \"typical\" case.\n. I don't have a specific solution. I just mean that the behavior here should be useful, predictable, and in line with godep's (and Go's) established conventions. If there's no vcs root available (for example, because the vcs root is outside the gopath element as in your case), then perhaps godep can use some other directory as the \"root\". Or, for the current project, it might be able to get away without a root at all \u2013\u00a0it already uses the current directory as the location for Godeps. Maybe that alone is sufficient. Or, maybe there's another way to get the vcs root reliably. AFAIK package vcs uses GOPATH entries so it can construct an import path for the root of the repo, so maybe we could use \"/\" as the srcRoot when calling FromDir, as a fallback. That might be enough information for godep to do its job in the same way it already does.\n. The 'godep path' output isn't meant to go in your bashrc.\nIt's just a way to recreate what 'godep go' does \u2013 to let you\nmake a sandbox for running tools other than the go tool.\n\nRunning 'godep restore' will try to download code into\nyour GOPATH. The sandbox for the project already has\nall the code in it, so trying to restore with the sandbox in\nyour GOPATH will produce strange results.\n. Another attempt to put this: if you're only using the\nstandard go tool, you don't need 'godep path'.\n. @mreiferson is referring to the original behavior of godep; it's now what you get when you run `godep save -copy=false`. Instead of a directory, it puts just the json manifest in a plain file `Godeps`. Then running `godep go whatever` will fetch all the dependencies into $TMPDIR on the fly and build a gopath.\n\nIt's complex and slow compared to checking in all the source code but seems to work ok.\n. > is there another way to use godep non-vendored?\n\nYou can add `src` into the .gitignore file by hand.\nSeveral projects have done this, including\nhttps://github.com/antifuchs/zeus/tree/revamp-build.\n. Godep doesn't (currently) do anything special when src is ignored.\n`godep path` will just print {projectroot}/Godeps/_workspace. For a\nfresh clone, it's not very useful, since it'll be empty of source code.\n. I think it would be reasonable to have `godep restore` restore packages to _both_ the outer GOPATH and the local _workspace dir, so that both match what's listed in Godeps.json.\n\nI think that would solve the original issue here, without removing the original intent of `godep restore`, which is to be the opposite of `godep save` (taking its list from the repo and installing outside, rather than taking its list from outside and installing into the current repo).\n. > If `godep save` creates and uses `Godeps/_workspace` by _default_ it seems like it's dual - `godep restore` - should do the same. I was hoping it would create the workspace if it did not exist.\n\nGodep save creates and uses Godeps; its dual - restore - does the opposite. The first reads your GOPATH and writes to Godeps; the second reads Godeps and writes to your GOPATH.\n\n---\n\nI have a different proposal now:\n\nCommands 'godep go' and 'godep path' should make an effort to make sure code is available. If `src` is checked in, there's nothing extra to do, they can just use `Godeps/_workspace` as they currently do. If `src` is missing, they should attempt to fetch code and put it in `Godeps/_workspace/src` (similar to godep's original behavior, but simpler).\n\nWhat does everyone think of this? Would it solve the problem?\n\nA potential follow-on to this would be to change the -copy=false behavior to produce the directory structure being discussed here, Godeps/_workspace with 'src' in gitignore. This would let us deprecate and eventually remove a big chunk of complex code supporting creation of the old TMPDIR workspace.\n. Restore is sometimes necessary when updating dependencies or saving new dependencies. Those other commands would have to be more careful if we want them to work without access to the full dependency set in $GOPATH.\n\nThis would be helped with better documentation for 'godep restore'. Restore is the opposite of save: save takes packages from GOPATH and puts the corresponding list of commit IDs in Godeps; restore takes a list of commit IDs from Godeps and puts the corresponding packages in GOPATH.\n. I would instead say that the premise of this issue is increasingly invalid: \"non-vendored operation\" is something that godep doesn't support. When folks ask how to handle the Godeps directory when they don't commit the source code, the response should be \"you should commit the source code\". If they _really_ don't want to vendor code, then godep is not the tool for them.\n. Overriding the whole thing means the current project (everything outside\nof Godeps/_workspace) is not in GOPATH. I'd expect that to be ok for an\nisolated package but not if the current package imports something else, e.g.\nhttps://github.com/antifuchs/zeus/blob/master/go/zeusmaster/zeusmaster.go#L8\n\nWould #6 be sufficient instead?\n. Just to spell out the example above, if zeusmaster imports\ngithub.com/burke/zeus/go/clienthandler, I'd expect the go tool\nto be unable to find clienthandler, since it's not in the godep\nsandbox, and so nowhere to be found in GOPATH.\n. I think `godep get package` already does what you want.\n\n```\nyuzu:~ kr$ ls bin\ngodep\nyuzu:~ kr$ ls src/github.com/mitchellh\nls: src/github.com/mitchellh: No such file or directory\nyuzu:~ kr$ godep get github.com/mitchellh/gox\nyuzu:~ kr$ ls bin\ngodep   gox\n```\n\nAm I misunderstanding?\n. Oh, yes I'm misunderstanding. You want to compile and install the\nversion of gox listed in zeus's manifest, not whatever's at the tip of\nmaster in gox's repo.\n. Since leaving those comments I realized I don't fully understand what you're asking for. :'(\n\nCould you give maybe some example directory trees, or command sessions (including fictitious commands) showing the desired workflow?\n. Good call. It should be more careful about when to delete the old Godeps.\n. Merged as 0eddae56318276eb16180e29594092d3d0f7094e. Thanks!\n. Ah, I have an idea for what this could be.\n. Uh, I left that comment on my phone on a train and then forgot to follow up. Now I don't remember what the idea was.\n\nMaybe something to do with git setting timestamps in the past during a checkout, but I doubt that would explain this case since I know hk has had commits since Jan 17.\n\nIt's hard to understand what's going wrong here. The command you ran `godep go build` is really just doing the equivalent of:\n\n```\n$ GOPATH=/path/to/hk/Godeps/_workspace:$GOPATH go build\n```\n. Hopefully de4fb952cb414a9a9ddbeeabf68cc851718417a7 has fixed this satisfactorily.\n\nPlease reopen this issue (or open a new one) if there's still a problem.\n. Godep can't simply follow symlinks, because that can result in pathological behavior. (Consider a symlink that points to its parent directory.) Godep is in a similar situation to the standard go tool with respect to symlinks. As Ian Lance Taylor [put it](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-dev/GLUZGtUSj8A/SGUtCooLIT0J):\n\n> Yes.  In general the go tool does not work well with symlinks.  There\n> is no current plan to change this.  Any fix would have to describe a\n> complete and coherent solution for how symlinks should be handled.  I\n> don't know what that would look like.\n\nGodep is in the same boat.\n. You can use 'go get' on private repos if you put a github access token in `~/.netrc`.\n\nHere's a (fake) example:\n\n```\nmachine github.com\n  login kr\n  password d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e\n```\n\nThis works for the plain go tool and anything else that uses it, not just godep.\n. I agree it makes sense for godep to have this.\n\nFor your particular case, is there a reason you can't put the import in a regular source file, without any build constraints?\n. @wfreeman @oxtoacart does pull request #66 fix this problem for you?\n. I went ahead and merged my proposed fix. If you still see the problem, please reopen this issue or open a new one. :)\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. Go programmers typically do this without godep's help. Put the dependency in your filesystem under its original import path. Commit any changes you like and push them to and from any remote repositories from there.\n\nFeel free to reopen this if I'm misunderstanding the situation you describe, but I think it doesn't belong in godep.\n. Ok, understood. This problem has come up in my projects as well. Godep with vendoring made it easier for us to test and deploy our changes in staging and production before they were merged upstream.\n\nGodep is primarily a vendoring tool. I highly recommend that approach.\n. Eventually I'd like to support subversion, but it's not very high on my todo list. I'd gladly accept a well-written patch for this.\n. This should become possible after we remove -copy=false mode from the save command.\n. > It would have to work transitively as well right?\n\nYes.\n. Started working on this yesterday.\n. I've thought about the directory name more since this issue was opened. The benefit to changing the name is small, and purely aesthetic. It's not worth having extra logic (and the accordant extra documentation). Plus, the top level element will never be anything other than exactly 'Godeps', so the shortest it could be is 'Godeps/_something'.\n. Another approach is to make changes in the upstream project and re-vendor it to test in your own project. You might also ask other projects that already rewrite import paths, such as camlistore, to see their workflow.\n. PTAL at #82. I think it is about ready to merge.\n. Maintaining patches to a project you don't own is quite a bit of additional work, yes.\n\n> I'd probably need to fork the dependency into my own \"vendor\" repo (separate from the consumer repo), maintain any changes there, and then vendor that into the product.\n\nI think you're taking on a little unnecessary extra work for yourself here.\n\nFor nontrivial patches I agree you should fork the upstream library on github and use that to publish your pending PRs. But don't change its import path, develop your patch in the original directory. Then the act of vendoring this library will be the same whether or not your patch has been merged yet.\n. Yes, agreed. I've been thinking of having godep also put git URLs\nin the json manifest, in case the listed commit isn't available in the\nimplicit url that the go tool derives from the import path.\n. Cool, I'm glad this got fixed, even if inadvertently. I should add a test to make sure it doesn't regress.\n. Thanks for reporting this. We definitely need to work on handling symlinks better.\n\nWhat does the `go list ./...` command you mentioned print?\n. The originally reported error message says the working directory was /Users/lachlan/Projects/xyz/xyz, but the accompanying description says it was ~/.go/src/github.com/xyz/xyz. Which is it?\n\nA working directory of /Users/lachlan/Projects/xyz/xyz is definitely not following the standard Go code layout described at http://golang.org/doc/code.html. This is a basic assumption of godep; it's not going to change.\n. Yes, my apologies, I misremembered the direction of the symlink.\n\nThe problem here is that Getwd returns the actual directory on disk, rather than a path containing a symlink. In general, it is not possible for the Go process (or any other process) to determine which path was used to arrive at that directory.\n\n```\n$ mkdir a\n$ ln -s a b\n$ cd b\n$ python -c 'import os; print os.getcwd()'\n/Users/kr/tmp/a\n```\n. > I'm not even sure how one would fix this particular problem.\n\nDon't use symlinks.\n. > All that said, AFAICT, the go command itself seems to have no problem with this setup.\n\nIf you run 'go list', it doesn't print github.com/xyz/xyz, even though that's the import path of the package. This is a problem.\n. > the \"standard Go layout\" doesn't work out so well when you're trying to, for example, include a repo of go code as a submodule in some other non-Go repo.\n\nI'd like to hear more about this situation, and why it's necessary in the first place. What are you trying to do?\n. > The other alternative is to simply import all the Go code into the main Perl repo, then check that out under the GOPATH and adjust our Go code import paths to match this. It's a pain, but clearly fighting Go is a pain too.\n\nYeah, that's what I'd recommend, if you want to keep your Go code in the same repo as the Perl. Move all the files and change the import paths. Sorry.\n\nI'm still curious why you want it to be in a subdirectory in the first place (either via submodules or copying files).\n. > As opposed to what?\n\nAs opposed to keeping it in a separate repo.\n\nYou mentioned that you want to share a test harness, but I'm not quite making the connection. Even if the code for the test harness is in the Perl repo, that doesn't necessarily mean you can't use it when your working directory is in another repo.\n. Ok. Well at this point it seems like there's not really anything godep can do to help. You just have to keep your go code in a standard go workspace (a symlink mimicking a standard go workspace pointing to code that actually lives elsewhere isn't the same thing) if you want godep to work.\n\nNote, there's a similar discussion happening in #43. It's almost always possible to use a standard go workspace, even in a repo that spans many projects over the whole organization, and uses multiple programming languages.\n\nI'm going to close this issue, but feel free to keep the discussion going, and let me know if you have any other concrete ideas for how godep might help.\n. (I'd use the \"wontfix\" label, but it's really more like \"can't fix\". :bow:)\n. Publishing your docs would be fantastic! Godep could use more guides written in a different voice and different communication styles.\n. @intabulas do you mind opening an issue for case sensitivity? I'm not sure what (if anything) godep can do to help there, but it would be a separate problem (despite resulting in the same error message).\n. cc @simonz05 @fdr \n. Agreed, something like this would be nice. And possibly also a more explicit baked-in pre-commit hook.\n. On a second look, this seems to be a duplicate of #1.\n. @bmizerany that ought to be an error. I'll add a test for that case and make sure it does the right thing. Thanks.\n. Thanks everyone. I'm just working on fixing @bmizerany's reported bug in da956b74d2617869f583a8a2db27dc6680e991f2  and then I'll merge this.\n. Ok, I think this is ready. If you're into code review, now would be a great time for comments. :)\n. Thanks so much! Whew. Now on to #68!\n. The usual approach with the go tool is to clone the repo from github (with the usual 'go get github.com/x/y'), make local changes there, and (optionally) push your changes to your public fork if you want them to be merged upstream. It's the same with godep.\n\nDon't ever change import path github.com/x/y to github.com/myfork/y unless you intend to maintain a separate project indefinitely.\n. You don't need the '-r' flag to maintain a temporary fork. Just stick with the original import path and you should be ok. Remember, an import path is just a directory ('go get' is the only go command that accesses the network). When you run 'godep save', you'll pick up the code in that directory, just as when you run 'go install'.\n\nYour modified source code will go into _workspace, and the hash of your commit in Godeps.json.\n\nFor project P using dependency X:\n1. go get X\n2. make your changes to X until it works\n3. godep update X\n4. commit and share P\n\nOptional:\n1. fork X on github\n2. push your X changes to your fork\n3. at some point the pull requests is accepted\n4. godep update X\n5. delete your fork\n. > However, as long as you have a fork of a package, nobody else will be able to run godep restore because nothing in your Godeps.json teaches them in what repository they will find the Rev in question, right?\n\nThat's right. I had been considering adding a field to Godeps.json to handle this case for some time. This issue is mentioned in https://github.com/kardianos/vendor-spec/issues/6 and #207 that I can find.\n. Thanks! This is what I get for rushing a patch out for testing before getting on an airplane. :sweat_smile:  \n. I had some trouble installing scollector, but I was able to reproduce what you describe with github.com/heroku/hk.\n1. There are incorrect whitespace changes. Maybe this has something to do with how I'm using package [go/printer](http://godoc.org/go/printer).\n2. Rewriting import paths that aren't part of the dependency manifest was a bug. I've pushed an updated commit to the branch and now hk with rewriting compiles cleanly for me.\n3. I'll look into the build constraints. Does it miss out putting the dependency in the list, or just rewriting the path?\n4. To get packages in subdirectories, use `godep save -r ./...`. Godep follows the convention established by the go tool: for commands that take a list of packages, no argument means the same as just dot (`.`).\n. The whitespace formatting problem should be fixed now. Can you confirm @mjibson?\n\nI'll work on the build tags next.\n. Yes, it's pushed. Github doesn't do such a hot job of indicating revisions to a patch.\nYou can see the newest code on https://github.com/tools/godep/pull/82/files if you\nsearch for \"Config\".\n. FYI the commit id is 550fdb6a9c9a78bf17c6771a17ceadd88d39e1cb.\n. Ok, then the build tag problem is a separate bug. It would happen even if\nyou didn't use `-r`. I'll open an issue for that and track it separately from the\nrewriting pull request. Probably fix it after merging this.\n. Opened #84 to track build constraints.\n\nWith that, I think this issue is resolved and I'm almost ready to merge #82.\n. Thanks for reporting all these issues!\n. PTAL.\n\nI think this is about ready to merge.\n. At last this is merged! Thanks for all the feedback everyone. :heart: :smile: :heart:\n. The current approach is to duplicate the go tool's logic for scanning packages (and therefore stop calling the go tool). But that's a substantial amount of new code for godep (about 1000 lines), so I just asked about a couple of possible alternatives on golang-nuts:\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-nuts/4Bgl5DcPuBw/UjGonF4nOpAJ\n. Thanks for reporting this!\n\nFirst, I should point out that you'll need to use 'godep update' to\nupdate a dependency to a newer version. Try this:\n\n```\n$ go get -u github.com/mitchellh/goamz/...\n$ godep update github.com/mitchellh/goamz/...\n```\n\n(There's no need to run godep restore beforehand.) Command 'save'\npreserves versions of packages already listed in Godeps.json.\n\nSecond, you uncovered a bug in save when it scans the old and new\nlists of dependencies to carry over existing versions. It doesn't prioritize\nexact matches as it should, and so it's incorrectly comparing\ngoamz/aws with goamz/s3, when it should in this case compare each\npackage in the old list with its exact companion in the new list.\n\nThird, that error message is terribly unhelpful. It should be improved.\n. @buro9 would you mind trying again to verify that commit bbdfa05 fixes the problem you saw?\n\nI also opened #86 so we get a better error message there.\n. It's a basic requirement of godep (and a common assumption in go tooling in general) that the repo should be in a standard Go workspace. I don't think it's worth spending effort to try to accommodate situations where that assumption doesn't hold.\n\nIt's not very hard to determine where the repo ought to be placed when cloning it to a fresh system; that's part of the purpose of the ImportPath entry in Godeps.json.\n\nAlso, this strategy isn't portable; windows doesn't support symlinks.\n. I don't have any experience with Jenkins in particular, but I'd be surprised if it really can't be configured to work with a standard Go project. Other popular CI systems, including Travis, work with Go just fine.\n. I'm sorry, we can't be adding code to godep to accommodate every peculiar environment out there. Please use a standard Go workspace as described in http://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces.\n. This patch is fine if you (or the user) is using `godep restore` to work with the repo. The reason for the error message is that `godep go` doesn't work when a dependency uses bzr. Maybe this should be a warning?\n. Your directory tree looks ok, if a little unusual.\n\nJust don't ever use relative imports such as `./web` in Go source code.\n. Relative paths in import statements are prohibited inside a work space.\nhttps://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Relative_import_paths\n\nGodep isn't going to make any effort to support something the standard 'go' tool doesn't.\n. Thank you so much!\n. This was fixed in #95 d7653730bd16b6a001e5b54d603bd519a86c5f11.\n. My apologies for the late response on this. Thanks so much for the fix!\n. Thanks so much for reporting this. I wasn't at a computer earlier. :)\n. This is a dup of #94 and was fixed a while ago. Sorry I missed updating this issue!\n. Thanks for the patch! I think this is a promising approach.\n\nYou might have to do all the unqualify calls in a separate pass before the main loop in Godeps.Load, to make the containsPathPrefix check work properly. Sorting the paths is important to make sure we don't accidentally include a dependency D's subdirectory in addition to the D itself. (Imagine importing both A/Godeps/_workspace/src/D/X and D itself \u2013\u00a0we'd end up listing both D and D/X.) The current modification to the behavior of containsPathPrefix doesn't seem to cover this case (aside from just being unexpected behavior anyway).\n. Another reason to do the unqualify calls earlier is that they can hopefully be done before even calling LoadPackages. Modifying pkg.ImportPath and pkg.Dir but assuming the same pkg.Root isn't correct \u2013 two dependencies might come from two different Roots.\n. Also, you can delete readGodepsForImportPath entirely. Yay!\n. Sure, I can help make some test cases.\n. Looks like there are three things to test here:\n1. Windows paths (can't easily unit test)\n2. Multiple GOPATH roots.\n3. Excluding subdirectories.\n\nI pushed a commit (f3038ffa61657b7a39328d39e7c2505557dfee86) that tests those last two.\n. Looking pretty good! A couple of small comments and then we just need a unit test covering the new behavior.\n. Beautiful. This is the best kind of patch! Deleting code :heart:\n\nIf you're not comfortable adding a unit test for this change, I'm happy to do it.\n. Merged as f6274c18822c8931834f558a5dde22864a089a0f. Thanks so much!\n. My understanding of appengine is that they provide two separate implementations of their packages for the SDK and the production system. Even if godep were to save appengine/..., it wouldn't work.\n\nIf this is right, then we need some way to exclude appengine packages.\n\nIt could be built in to godep as in https://github.com/matthewbelisle-wf/godep/commit/dba190f14fc83759b74df44e4ab4e7a492eedb1d, or provided by the user as a flag, for example `-omit=appengine/...`.\n. I am leaning toward an \"ignore\" or \"omit\" flag plus a default list of patterns to ignore that is just appengine.\n. That's a good question. There isn't really a good way to specify these in godep.\n\nIf #84 were fixed (I'm working on it), you could do something like this:\n\n```\n// +build ignore\n\n// Dummy package so we can explicitly depend on build tools.\npackage dummy\n\nimport \"github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata/go-bindata\"\n```\n\nAnother way to look at these examples is as commands, used by the build process, that happen to be written in Go. What if some of them were written in Python or C? (Such as the protoc command itself.) This feels like potentially a can of worms.\n. Awesome. Thanks so much!\n. This seems worth considering. The go tool and vcs package take a different approach, having a verbose mode that prints the all arguments for each command. In general, I'd prefer to approach things the same way as the standard tooling unless there's a good reason to be different.\n. Any anyway, thanks for putting in this work! It will be useful one way or another. :)\n. This PR is meant to address #43.\n. This should fix #43 as well.\n. I've thought through this case before but clearly the current approach is not working well yet. (I'm a little puzzled by importing `github.com/coreos/fleet` itself \u2013\u00a0that's a command. But the same problem would arise from importing other packages in that same repo.)\n\nThe problem here is that godep expects all dependencies to be present in GOPATH, so it can load info about them and copy the code. But transitive dependencies (such as `github.com/godbus/dbus`) that have been copied into an intermediate package's repo (such as `github.com/coreos/fleet`) might not be installed under their original import paths, as seen above. \n\nHonestly, the best solution to this problem is to avoid it in the first place: libraries should not use godep at all, only commands (package main) should.\n\nHere's one possible way godep might enforce that:\n1. Of the packages given on the command line, consider only main packages, and discard others.\n2. If this results in the empty set, it's simply an error.\n3. Copy all dependencies, even the ones that live in the same repo.\n\nThis has the drawback that when developing, edits to packages in the same repo won't be picked up by the commands until you rerun godep save.\n\nAnother alternative would be to continue godep's current approach of \"undoing\" import path rewriting when copying packages that have already used godep, and to add more logic to automatically run 'go get' or otherwise fetch packages that aren't readily available in GOPATH.\n. I'm interested in more opinions about this @bcwaldon @philips @bmizerany @bradfitz.\n. Where would you get \"whateverhash\" from, and why should it be any more trustworthy than the code you can get directly from https://github.com/tools/godep/archive/master.tar.gz? (Or from 'go get', which also uses https on github.)\n. Looks like you are using Go version 1, which came out well over two years ago. The package code.google.com/p/go.tools/go/vcs (which is used by godep) uses features of the language that were introduced after that release. If you want to compile godep, you'll have to download a newer Go version, I recommend the latest, which is 1.3.1, and can be found at http://golang.org/dl/.\n\nAlso, I apologize that the error message in this situation is so unhelpful.\n. Maybe wontfix/cantfix is more appropriate. There are two problems here:\n1. We don't support ancient versions of Go. I agree it's arguably a problem but it's better for people to upgrade than to keep supporting outdated releases.\n2. The error message is terrible. This is for sure a problem but there's no good way to fix it. Brad started [a thread about this](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-dev/jyQq8ZYmZaI/_2ulYK67RykJ) recently but there's still no good solution.\n. Yes, this is a bug.\n. Good call. Thanks for reporting this.\n. Anything godep does has to work on Windows. This rules out symlinks.\n\nAs a first step, we might add a command such as 'godep check', that tells you if there are any dependencies missing from Godeps.\n. I have hope that this can be solved without exposing additional knobs. The general approach I would take: godep should find all dependencies, ignoring `// +build` lines entirely. It should behave as if all build constraints are satisfied when finding imports. #84 has a little bit of discussion on this topic.\n. This approach wouldn't change what gets built, only what code is included in the repository.\n. > could then be triggered with a `-tag` by the builder\n\nIf that's the case, then the alternative is it wouldn't build at all for that builder.\n\nIt's still the responsibility of the person running `godep save` to at least glance at the diff to make sure it's reasonable, regardless of what godep does about tags.\n. I suppose not building at all can be preferable to including unsupported code for an unsupported build configuration. Hmmm.\n. Thanks for doing this work! This looks similar to #1, would you consider updating this patch to provide the interface described there?\n. Usually, people run `godep save` with no further arguments, or `godep save ./...` to save the dependencies of all packages inside the current directory.\n\nIf you want import statements to refer to the copied source code, use flag `-r` and it will rewrite them for you. You don't have to do it by hand.\n\nHope this helps!\n. Ah, I see those import paths were already rewritten. That's fine, you can leave them as is. But the godep usage typically stays the same: whenever you add or remove a dependency, rerun `godep save -r` to pull in the new code.\n. The flag `-r` isn't quite right yet, which is why I haven't been promoting its use much so far. It works for most cases, but there are a few corner cases that need fixing.\n. Of course!\n. This looks great, thanks!\n. Sent github/linguist#1549.\n. The patch was merged into linguist earlier today, so now we just wait for github to deploy.\n. Note, we are currently waiting on github/linguist#2017.\n. > Though it wouldn't help if paths became internal/github.com/...\n\nYeah, I was thinking about that recently.\nWe'll cross that bridge when we come to it.\n. The fix is live on github as of a few hours ago. :tada: \n. Good call. The documentation needs a lot of work. Thanks for reporting this.\n. Is it possible to use the commit hash (perhaps abbreviated) as the version?\n. By the way, thanks for doing this!\n\nI will make a tag if that's the only way, but given that we don't do any of the other things that usually accompany a version tag (for example, releasing tarballs, providing compiled binaries, having a `godep version` command), sticking with commit hashes for now would be preferable.\n\nPlease also let me know if there's anything else I can do to help.\n. Ah, good idea! I think I'll tag the first commit (36059b6) as `0`. Would that satisfy your needs?\n. Done https://github.com/tools/godep/tree/0\n\nThanks again!\n. I think it's a fine concept. The output seems a little haphazard. It would be nice if it were more predictable, but maybe that's not feasible.\n. Thanks for all this discussion folks. It's super helpful! :sparkling_heart: \n. Did you mean #243? Looks like #153 is still open (but should be closed?).\n. Thanks for writing this patch!\n. Sorry, this isn't going to change.\n. Sorry, the go toolchain does not allow package names ending in `.go`.\n\nhttps://code.google.com/p/go/issues/detail?id=8782\n. No problem, glad it worked out! :)\n. Yes, you're absolutely right on all counts. We're explicitly trying to avoid having two different revisions from the same repo.\n\nReally need a better error message for this.\n. Ideally it should say why there is an error and what to do about it, like:\n\n```\ngodep: cannot update repo/A without repo/B\n\nRun 'godep update repo/...' to update all packages from repo.\n```\n. Yeah, we should fix this. Thanks!\n. Thanks for doing this!\n\nWould it be better to refuse to vendor the package if there are untracked files? That's what we do when any tracked files are modified, and this is arguably the same thing: the repo is \"dirty\".\n. What's wrong with copying ignored files? (We also copy `.gitignore`, so they should still be ignored even after the copy.)\n. True. Ok let me give this a more thorough review.\n. I've covered this in a couple of talks (here's one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myCHCXFFTPY), but I haven't written it down yet.\n\nBasic flow:\n1. Go into `src/github.com/foo/bar` and commit your change.\n2. Publish your change to your fork, and send a pull request.\n3. Go back to `src/github.com/marcesher/myproject` and rerun `godep save`.\n\nThis will vendor your modified code along with the commit id. When the project merges your change, you won't have to do anything, your commit is now included in the project's history.\n. Can you provide a test case? I haven't been able to reproduce the behavior you describe.\n. The ideal would be to automatically detect whether to rewrite import statements. It is always possible to do this: if flag `-r` was previously used there must be at least one import statement already rewritten, in a source file of one of the packages listed in Godeps.json under `Packages`.\n. I'd love to review a patch, @deoxxa. Thanks! I am also happy to discuss the approach further, if you prefer, before you write code.\n. This looks great. Do you mind rebasing this? Otherwise I can do it.\n. Thanks so much!\n. PTAL @bgentry @dsymonds @mjibson @ryandotsmith @bmizerany \n. I am starting to wonder if the regexp is more trouble than it is worth. If it gets any more unwieldy, I will be tempted to try something else altogether.\n\nAnyway,\nPTAL\n. Sorry, the list needs to go in a well-known place so that other tools can find it later. Making it configurable would defeat the purpose.\n. I agree with @freeformz on this.\n. Thanks for the fix! :grinning: \n. Done. Thanks for the report!\n. Update matches its arguments as a pattern against the list of dependencies. By construction, none of the dependency packages are inside `.`, so the pattern `./...` matches none of them. If you want to match all dependencies, the easiest way is to use `...`.\n. This is reasonable for a start. Another possibility would be to copy code from the go tool to download all packages in process. This would give much more control over this process, and let us fix one or two other issues as well. However, that would be a lot more work.\n\nFor checking the error output of `go get`, there are a couple of things to consider:\n1. If the `godep restore` is eventually successful, it should produce be no output.\n2. If it is not successful, each error should be printed exactly once.\n. This is no longer a problem with Go 1.5 and `GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1` in your environment.\n. > What is the issue with giving users more control over how Godep behaves?\n\nA proliferation of knobs and switches creates drag on both the interface and implementation. That makes it harder to design and implement truly important changes as they arise. Each new feature must \"pay its way\" by providing more benefit than the cost of maintaining it for the rest of eternity. This is doubly true for features that expose configuration options. (The ideal new feature \"just works\" without any change in the user's behavior. [Adding more configuration is an admission of failure.](http://ometer.com/preferences.html))\n\n> In this case I've proposed an option to increase the utility of Godep.\n\nThis change would give a _local_ increase in utility\u2014confined to a few unusual cases\u2014at the cost of a small but _global_ decrease in the utility of Godep\u2014for the numerous \"background\" use cases. It is not clear to me that the few occurrences of increased utility add up to more than the global cost.\n\nIt seems to me like a net decrease in utility.\n\nHowever, these days @freeformz probably has a better idea than I do about how godep is being used. We should defer to his estimate.\n. We could also solve this by using godep on itself. ;)\n. The parser can accept a []byte or string as the third argument. It would be nice not to create a temporary file in the filesystem, but instead keep the intermediate file in memory.\n. LGTM\n. Thanks so much!\n. Sounds like DWIM. If I type `godep save`, it's not the same thing as `godep save ./...`.\n\nStoring the -r might be ok, but then how would a project switch to not rewriting import paths?\n\nIf we did something like this, then the rules for godep's behavior would be more complicated. It would be a guessing game what exactly it'll do when you run `godep save`, and it's not really clear how to get the \"real\" `godep save` behavior when that's what you want.\n. You can import another package's main package:\n\n##### depmain/main.go\n\n``` go\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\nvar X int\n\nfunc main() {\n    fmt.Println(\"hello from dependency\")\n}\n```\n\n##### example/main.go\n\n``` go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n\n    _ \"depmain\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    fmt.Println(\"hello from example\")\n}\n```\n\n```\n$ go run main.go \nhello from example\n$ go install\n$ example\nhello from example\n```\n\nThis only works if you haven't installed the other package as a binary in your `$GOPATH/bin`.\n. The save and update commands check for this case and prevent it from happening. Godeps.json should never contain two different commit hashes from the same repo. If it happens anyway, that's a bug.\n. @thockin is right tho, even though godep tries to avoid this situation, it's reasonable to also check for it later, because who knows what happened to the file in between.\n. The approach I've tried to take so far is to let package main decide which revision of each dependency to use. Normally, a dependency package that itself has further dependencies should not even use godep. A repo like etcd is a little more confusing because it also has some commands, so they vendor all their deps. But when using packages from etcd in another project, we should try to treat the etcd packages as if they hadn't vendored anything.\n\nGodep could try to use etcd's recorded revision of those leaf dependencies, but that strategy doesn't always work: it's possible to have two repos that have each vendored a different revision of a leaf package. Our approach so far is to use a simple rule consistently: always let the user choose. The way the user expresses this choice is by installing their chosen revision of each dependency (leaf or otherwise) into their $GOPATH.\n\nHowever, there's certainly still room for making this more convenient. If a project has a lot of dependency repos like etcd, it's tedious to run `godep restore` for each one. Godep could potentially make this process more automatic. But note that that if the same leaf dependency has been vendored in multiple repos, the user will be left with an arbitrary revision of it in GOPATH\u2014whichever one was restored last. Maybe that's fine, but I'm a little worried that folks might not be aware of that. It could go unnoticed for a long time, and might be an unwelcome surprise.\n. It is a basic assumption of godep that you are vendoring packages, not commands.\n\nI agree that it would be useful to vendor commands along with their dependencies, but as you have indicated, that's a different thing, and godep doesn't really do that (yet). It might sort of work, but if so, that is a consequence of godep not being careful enough about what it does, not a deliberate feature.\n. The very rough plan is to change godep to use the new /vendor/ directory layout, possibly guarded by a command line flag. Then if the go tool -vendor flag is successful, godep will use that layout by default and remove import path rewriting (the -r flag) entirely.\n. I'm going to help update godep to support the new format, but I won't have the time it would take to devote to a whole new tool.\n. However, that certainly shouldn't stop anyone else if they want to try that route. Godep is open source, so if its code would help they are welcome to use it!\n. I think this is actually #160.\n. +1 LGTM\n. Rad, looking at this now.\n. BTW, maybe I should write this up in a [contributing.md file](https://github.com/blog/1184-contributing-guidelines), but this project has a \"rebase & squash\" policy. It's fine for a pull request to have multiple commits, but to land it should be rebased on top of master and squashed into a single commit.\n. LGTM after the minor things above.\n. This sounds reasonable to me. Some people complain about the amount of data it takes to vendor code, and vendoring the whole history will exacerbate those complaints, but personally I think it would be ok.\n. LGTM\n. PTAL\n. Uhh, it would have been nice to be able to address your feedback before we merged this. If we don't want travis complaining while this PR is still open the fix is to turn on this option:\n\n![build only if travis.yml is present](http://cl.ly/image/1h3o2g3P0M0J/Screen%20Shot%202015-07-02%20at%2010.30.11%20AM.png)\n\nI just turned it on.\n. Sorry, I guess I had 2 days' worth of chance to address the feedback. :sweat_smile:\n\nMy bad.\n. LGTM\n. Very exciting! I've also started playing around with this. Maybe there is something here that can help godep https://github.com/kr/vexp.\n\nI suspect the hardest part will be making godep work with both formats, projects saved with older versions of godep as well as the new vendor directory. And possibly also some sort of automatic or explicit migration.\n. Yeah as far as I know those are still unsolved questions.\n\nI think it's pretty safe to say that the result of vendoring should be a \"flat\" set of dependencies. That is, no \"vendor\" directory as a descendant another \"vendor\" directory. Seems to me like the hardest question is how to choose which version of each dependency.\n. Rebased.\n. I agree. What else do you think it would need?\n. LGTM\n. What do you think about putting Godeps.json inside vendor? It would mean more work for other tools that read that file (e.g. the Heroku buildpack) but it would produce less clutter in a project's root directory.\n\nEither way, LGTM\n. Looks like this was closed in fe7138c011ae7875d4af21efe8b237f4987d8c4a.\n. It should be copying all files, not just `.go` source files. See copySrc in save.go.\n. Aha, it seems the license file is in a parent directory of all the go packages. Since godep copies only packages, it misses the parent directory. Yes, this would be difficult to fix.\n\nAlthough godep mainly operates on packages, it already has some special cases for the root of a repository. It is not too hard to imagine another special case that copies all regular files from the repo root of any dependency. (We still want to avoid simply copying the entire repo, because it might contain some very large packages that are unused and could otherwise be omitted.)\n. Yeah, that would be reasonable as well.\n. LGTM\n. (I am assuming your GOROOT is `/usr/lib/go`; you can check this by running `go env`.)\n\nGodep tries to update packages on disk wherever they are found; if they are not found, it downloads them to the first entry in GOPATH, just like 'go get'.\n\nI would guess that `/usr/lib/go/src/golang.org/x/net/html` was created somehow outside of godep, and now that it exists, godep finds the package there and tries to update it. Or perhaps the first item in your GOPATH is `/usr/lib/go`\u2014if so, you should remove it. The value of GOROOT should not be in GOPATH.\n. Commands 'godep restore' and 'godep get' follow the same rules as the go tool for locating and downloading packages. That will remain the case. (In fact, godep doesn't download any packages itself, it just runs the go tool to do that work. Any behavior change there would have to happen in the go tool.)\n\nYou should remove the value of GOROOT from your GOPATH, if it's there. I also recommend you delete golang.org/x/net/html from your GOROOT, along with any other packages in GOROOT that aren't part of the standard library. That should get you back up and running, so that both 'godep restore' and 'go get' work properly for all packages.\n. Can you provide a complete program that exhibits the behavior you're describing? Please also include steps to reproduce the problem and describe the behavior you expected to see.\n. Godep uses the json file to, among other things, keep track of which dependencies it has vendored. If a package is listed in Godeps.json, godep will not bother to copy its source code into Godeps/_workspace/src.\n. The flag `-r` means to rewrite import paths.\n\nYou should use `godep save -r ./...` as your command.\n. You're welcome! :balloon: \n. Hah. :)\n. This sounds like a bug. If an updated dependency needs to pull in a new package, I think godep should do so.\n\nFor now, you can try to work around this by running `godep save -r` after running `godep update`.\n. It is safe to run `godep save -r` (or `godep save`) even if you have newer versions of some packages. Only `update` will update a package. You don't have to run `godep restore`.\n. LGTM\n. LGTM\n. Sure, LGTM\n. LGTM\n. If you have `GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1` in your environment, you don't need to use `godep path` at all.\n. > having godep path return the right thing means it's easier\n> to write portable shellscript wrappers in the interim\n\nIt sounds like you're asking for a new feature. The command `godep path` returns a workspace\u2014a directory suitable for including in the `GOPATH` list. The vendor directory is not a workspace and it can't usefully be included in your `GOPATH`. When you're using `GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1`, there is no \"right thing\" for `godep path` to print.\n\nHowever, in that case, it's trivial to construct the correct path yourself, so I don't see how a godep feature would make writing portable shell script wrappers any easier.\n. But I do agree there's a bug in godep here: if `GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1` is in the environment, then `godep path` should print a helpful error message and exit with a nonzero status code.\n. This feature sounds reasonable in principle, just for the sake of convenience. (I would be careful about doing things for the sake of security without thinking more deeply about it from top to bottom. I suspect that godep isn't in a position to provide any meaningful security guarantees without some serious redesign. A feature that is nominally \"for security\" but where the threat model is half-baked or nonexistent will be misleading, and probably worse than just making no promises in the first place.)\n\nI don't have much opinion about the mechanism to achieve it. If this works reliably, cool.\n. :+1: this is a big improvement.\n\nOne could nit-pick the wording or formatting, but this is already much better than what it currently does.\n. It would be better to fix this by calling path.Clean on the command line arg before supplying it to matchPattern. The function matchPattern is a lower-level routine that expects to get a true import path.\n\nIn the go tool, this is the difference between\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/blob/6083bd65f7/src/cmd/go/main.go#L347-L355\n\nand matchPattern:\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/blob/6083bd65f7/src/cmd/go/main.go#L476\n. Using path.Clean would fix not just trailing slashes, but all unclean paths, such as `github.com/golang/protobuf///.//proto`.\n. LGTM\nThat was fast! :)\n. :+1:\n. Is there a way to do this without a flag? Optional behavior makes for [poor UX and harder-to-maintain software](http://ometer.com/free-software-ui.html).\n. I can sympathize with the instinctual desire to maintain backwards compatibility. It's worth asking whether that's necessary. I don't know the answer, but if it's acceptable to change the meaning of godep save, then I think that would be preferable.\n\nI'm only aware of one thing that consumes this field, and it's buildpacks (both heroku and cloudfoundry) that need to install the go compiler. If that's the extent of it, then I think it would be fine to simply make the change unilaterally. There might be additional ways this field is used, but I sort of doubt it.\n\n@freeformz do you have any insight here?\n. Yeah, that was the original intention. But if some other behavior would be more useful, it's not set in stone. :)\n. Try `godep update ...` (three literal dots).\n. This should absolutely be documented better. There could be an example in the help output for `godep help update`.\n. This sounds like a bug.\n. I'm sorry for this. It's a good idea to avoid using symlinks for elements of GOPATH, or inside your workspace.\n\nThe go tool includes code to explicitly prohibit some cases, though it seems there are still others that it doesn't catch. We (godep) should consider taking a similar approach, to find cases that are unlikely to work correctly and produce a helpful error message instead of silently doing something useless.\n. I think this is the right approach in the long run. It had to happen eventually.\n. LGTM\n. Now that @freeformz is making binary releases of godep, it seems like there's less reason to spend effort making godep compile with older Go versions.\n. That looks like a good fix. There are two slight refinements you might want to make:\n1. You don't need `$GOPATH` in there; it's unlikely any executables will be put there.\n2. You don't need to set `GOBIN`, you can just put the bin directory directly in path as `$GOPATH/bin`.\n\nSo, putting those together it would be:\n\n``` shell\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n```\n. > I did a 'go get -u' yesterday\n\nOk, but what version do you have? It would be helpful if you can run `godep version` and paste the output here so we know exactly what you have.\n. It's not, in general, possible to save only some of your dependencies. You have to save all or none. \n. > Both godep and go installed from Homebrew.\n\n(Offtopic) pro tip: don't install Go from homebrew (or any package manager). Download a tarball from https://golang.org/dl/ and unzip it into /usr/local/go.\n. Makes sense. I was planning to add this as a command called `godep diff`\n. Finding dependencies is important for all godep's commands. But it's easier than that. Just run `go list -json`.\n. I updated the description for the diff command.\n. Agreed. Current thinking is a `godep restore` to mirror `save`.\n. Thanks for this patch! I think it's essentially superseded by the newer\njson format of Godeps, but if you still think this issue is relevant please\nfeel free to reopen or send another PR.\n. Merged in 9ab667fc969c31320428ca4667729b017954e709.\n. Closing in favor of #2.\n. One piece to the solution for this:\n\nThe `godep go get` command should always have the same effect\nas `godep go install`. The only case where they're different is\nif some dependencies are missing from the Godeps list. So I'm\nplanning to make `godep go get` an error.\n. The `godep go get` part was done in 05aebf24b176dbbbd9bcff56ee4ce000009fa5b1.\n. The remaining part of this is to check that there are no\ndependencies missing from the Godeps list.\n. Yes, this is still desired!\n\nIdeally we can move toward rewriting import paths, which would make the 'godep go' command superfluous. However, even then I think we'd want a way to check that everything is correct, that:\n1. all dependencies are listed\n2. the code that exists in Godeps/_workspace matches exactly the listed commit\n\nThe diff command described in issue #1 would cover at least the first item above, and maybe it could do the second item as well, perhaps under a flag.\n. This looks great. I don't want to reimplement package vcs.\nWe use it for a few things:\n- detect which VCS to use\n- find the repo root\n- find the remote url\n\nDoing these things correctly means matching the go tool's\nbehavior, including everything described in `go help remote`.\n. It looks like you might be working outside of a standard\nGo workspace. What happens when you run `go list` in\nthat directory?\n\nSee http://golang.org/doc/code.html for an introduction\non setting up a workspace.\n. Good idea, I've edited the readme: 603a348b365409e4ed7d50e3d8002dc8152afd8b.\n\nIn general, it's probably good to be in the habit of using a standard\nGo workspace for all development. That makes it easier to work\nwith other people and utilities, as more and more things work with\nthis assumption, such as the go tool and godep.\n. Note that with `godep save -copy`, explicit bzr support is unnecessary.\n. I was wrong, there are a couple of VCS-specific things godep does\nin the save command:\n- get the current commit id (e.g. git rev-parse HEAD)\n- describe the current commit (e.g. git describe)\n- ensure there are no uncommitted changes (e.g. git diff HEAD)\n\nhttps://github.com/kr/godep/blob/master/vcs.go#L36-L38\n\nThese should be easy to add bzr support for.\nI'll give this a shot today.\n\nThe other commands in that file vcs.go are the ones that\ncan be circumvented by -copy, and, in a happy coincidence,\nthose are the ones I would have trouble doing in bzr.\n. @ardan-bkennedy please give this another try! :)\n. What happens when you run this?\n\n```\n$ cd /Users/bill/example/src/labix.org/v2/mgo\n$ bzr status\n```\n\nThis tool uses `bzr status` to decide if any changes have been\nmade to the checked-out copy of each package. If the working\ntree is dirty, the revision number will be wrong (since it won't\naccount for any changes in the working tree since the last\ncommit), so godep will refuse to use that dependency.\n\nYou could also try:\n\n```\n$ rm -rf /Users/bill/example/src/labix.org/v2/mgo\n$ go get labix.org/v2/mgo\n$ godep save -copy\n```\n. All software has bugs. The idea is for godep to do the\nright thing in the common case. When the user runs\n'go get', followed by 'godep save' or 'godep save -copy',\nit should just work.\n\nI'll open another bug for this.\n. Just opened #15.\n. Yes. Using the `godep go` command workflow will be unchanged.\n\nI'd also like to improve the case when you're initially fetching and\nbuilding a godep-using project, but that's a separate issue.\n. One nice ancillary benefit of flag -copy, the Heroku buildpack will\nbe able to skip installing all VCS systems (hg and bzr).\n. This was done in f44942b5afbe2c9d1ce5f4047dcde6b61e3b69ab.\n. Yes! I've been meaning to open an issue for this for a while.\n\nThanks for bringing this up!\n\nI think it should be called `godep get`, since it has to do more\nthan just invoke the go tool in a sandbox. The behavior I'm\ncurrently imagining, for the command `godep get foo`:\n1. It runs `go get -d foo`\n2. It runs `cd $(go list -f {{.Dir}} foo) && godep go install foo`\n. See also #6.\n. I edited the description above to say \"godep get\".\n\nBut if you really like the \"godep go get\" form (or something else),\nplease say so. I'm very much open to bikeshed painting. :)\n. It's not quite as simple as the two steps I described above, because\nthe arguments might specify multiple packages. So it would probably\nhave to expand the package list first, then do those two steps for\neach package (and maybe this could be optimized to avoid redundant\nwork).\n. I also want \"godep get\" to to The Right Thing even if the specified package\ndoesn't use godep at all. It should gracefully fall back to behaving equivalently\nto whatever \"go get\" does.\n. This should be fixed now.\n\ncc @ardan-bkennedy, does this work correctly for you now?\n. Awesome, thanks :)\n. Awesome, thanks for the report!\nShould be fixed now.\n\nA couple of things puzzled me about the initial report:\n- My version of go get (Go version 1.1.2) doesn't have `-t` flag. I removed that flag and successfully reproduced the issue.\n- It's a little unusual to specify a full import path (github.com/globocom/tsuru/provision/docker) on the godep save command line. Did you do that just for the sake of reporting this issue, or do you intend to use it that way for the real project?\n. That is a bug. Thanks for the report!\n. > If you have dependencies that are also not gettable (but in the local workspace), you get the same \"unrecognized import path\" error\n\nInteresting. I opened #18 to track this.\n. Note that, even currently, the dependencies don't have to be _publicly_ available,\nas long as RepoRootForImportDynamic succeeds for the person running godep save.\n. We could also write our own version of RepoRootForImportPath that\nonly uses the local filesystem (looking for sentinel directories .git, .bzr,\netc). This would require the package to be present locally, but we already\nrequire that anyway.\n. Nice, FromDir will help a lot. I didn't notice that before.\n. The push that closed this issue was a mistake.\nI'm waiting for a reply on pull request #20 first.\n. > If I use godep to manage my dependencies, what happens if my dependencies also happen to use godep to manage their own dependencies?\n\nTheir Godeps list will be ignored in your project. You decide\nwhich version to use of all transitive dependencies.\n\n> And what happens if such a third party package decides to use -copy and include its dependencies in its repo?\n\nYou'll get one copy of each transitive dependency,\nbut not the copies, if any, that intermediate packages\nhave vendored.\n\nThis is because godep and the go tool skip directories\nstarting with `.` and `_`. Specifically, the directory\nGodeps/_workspace will be skipped when godep is\ncopying source code into your project.\n. This looks really nice!\n. This is merged in d91fda717ffef4017f4c7376efcc997df97b24b1. Thanks!\n. Yeah I tend to agree \u2013\u00a0it's easy to turn `godep run` into an interactive shell, but not so nice the other way around.\n. It's possible you were unlucky enough to pull godep after d91fda717ffef4017f4c7376efcc997df97b24b1\nbut before fb07940c7669536d2f5c49b8a368fa91883b9ef6. Godep should ignore all packages given on the\ncommand line (count them as \"seen\").\n\nDo you mind updating and trying again?\n\nIf it's still broken then yes, something else is going on that needs\nto be fixed.\n. Oh, I see. The problem is that `go list ./...` doesn't include `github.com/bitly/nsq`.\nGodep tries to work with repo roots so we don't get two entries for the same repo:\n\n```\n        {\n            \"ImportPath\": \"github.com/lib/pq\",\n            \"Rev\": \"f5dbc67a0263fbfffeb80970e47d589783d62854\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"ImportPath\": \"github.com/lib/pq/oid\",\n            \"Rev\": \"f5dbc67a0263fbfffeb80970e47d589783d62854\"\n        }\n```\n\nInstead, we want just one entry:\n\n```\n        {\n            \"ImportPath\": \"github.com/lib/pq\",\n            \"Rev\": \"f5dbc67a0263fbfffeb80970e47d589783d62854\"\n        },\n```\n\nI think to fix this problem, we should revert d7319384365b73b6f26efa402f0aa568e1539278 but use\nVCSFromDir instead of VCSForImportPath as a better fix for #17.\n(This is the same way we fixed #18.)\n\nI'll do that this afternoon unless you beat me to it.\n. Done! Thanks. :)\n. @mreiferson and @fsouza, do you mind trying out this fix?\n\nI tested it myself on github.com/bitly/nsq and it seems to do the right thing.\nI also tested it on an internal project that exhibited the \"lib/pq and lib/pq/oid\"\nduplicate entry problem described in #22, and it does the right thing there\nas well.\n. You can vendor the code, but you need to make a commit first,\nso there's a way to identify exactly what you've vendored.\nYou can push this commit to your fork of the package if you want,\nbut that's not necessary.\n. I'd like to make a blog post or something soon describing how\nto do this and other common tasks with more fleshed-out\nexamples. The instructions in the readme are perhaps too terse.\n. One of the big benefits of godep's vendoring is that you can\nmaintain a fork without changing import paths. But this is really\na separate issue. You don't need a fork.\n\nAll you have to do is commit your change locally, then godep\nwill happily vendor the code.\n\n```\n$ cd /path/to/package && git commit -a -m 'fix bug'\n```\n. The save command arguments are packages, not files,\njust like most of the go tool commands. What happens\nwhen you run 'go list app/tmp/main.go'?\n\nTry this from the root:\n\n```\n$ godep save ./...\n```\n\nOr perhaps\n\n```\n$ godep save ./app/tmp\n```\n\n(On a slightly tangential note, putting a main package in\na directory called 'tmp' will give you a binary named 'tmp'.\nIs that what you want?)\n. I'm going to close this issue; it seems to be resolved in https://github.com/kr/godep/issues/24#issuecomment-28250406.\n\nIf saving dependencies for a revel project continues to be a problem,\nlet's open a separate issue for that.\n\nBTW, thanks so much for all this feedback. It's a huge help in making\ngodep correct and robust in many situations.\n. Awesome! Thanks again for the help. :)\n. Something similar was addressed in #23 and #22.\nDo you mind updating your copy of godep and trying again?\nSorry for the trouble.\n\n```\n$ go get -u github.com/kr/godep\n```\n. Where did you run the `godep save` command?\nWhich project or package was it?\n. Bear in mind that Godeps.json doesn't just list the direct dependencies\nof your project, it lists all transitive dependencies. Both packages sqs\nand aws are dependencies of your package, but as you've observed,\nwe only include one entry for each repo, and the choice is arbitrary\n(currently alphabetical). Neither one is right or wrong; they're both\ndependencies of your project.\n\nWould you feel more comfortable with `github.com/crowdmob/goamz`\nas the path listed in Godeps.json? I've been thinking about making\nthat change. (Arguably the name ImportPath is no longer correct,\nsince it can be a directory with no .go files, as in this case.)\n. And, you're welcome! :)\n. My apologies, I misunderstood the problem here.\n\nThe save command needs to copy _both_ packages aws\nand sqs, and it's only copying aws. Yes, I think the simplest\nsolution is to move to using the repo root for both the json\nentry and the path to copy in.\n. If you'd like to update this pull request to use the repo root\n(but keep the json field name \"ImportPath\" for now), go for it.\nOtherwise I'll take care of it.\n. Cc @goinggo you were interested in this issue as well.\nIt should be fixed. Please reopen or open a new issue\nif you still see problems.\n. That's it. I haven't managed to define all the vcs operations for bzr.\n\nThe existing sandbox code is \"clever\", and uses operations that\ndon't map well across different vcs's. It would probably be good\nto redo that to use only the operations already defined in\ncode.google.com/p/go.tools/go/vcs.\n. Ah yes, thanks.\n. This looks like a duplicate of #27.\n. You can use `godep restore` to set up your gopath for\ndevelopment with the go tool (so you don't have to\nprefix every command with 'godep'). Then your\nworkflow can look like this:\n- Change P; run P's tests.\n- Run your tests, to make sure the change is what you really want.\n- Commit the changes to P.\n- `godep save` to copy over the final changes.\n. Sure, a PR would be great. As much as possible, I'd like to match\nthe style and conventions of the go tool's help text.\n\nFor example, it consistently uses 'download' to mean putting source\ncode into $GOPATH/src and 'install' to mean putting binaries into\n$GOPATH/{pkg,bin}. The godep restore help uses 'install' to mean\nputting source code into $GOPATH/src, so we should fix that usage.\n\nAnd you're absolutely right, we need to be more clear about where\ncode is going to be installed, since unlike the go tool there are two\npossible places.\n\nTo clear this up will probably require revising help text of several\ncommands for consistent usage:\n\n```\n    save      list and copy dependency code into Godeps\n    path      print sandbox path for use in GOPATH\n    restore   download listed dependency versions to GOPATH\n```\n\n\u2026or something like that.\n. I changed the issue summary to reflect this discussion.\n. We shouldn't add new commands for every random tool\nthat people come up with. If the existing `godep path`\ncommand isn't sufficient, then we should make either\n`godep run` or `godep shell` and be done with it.\n. I'll go ahead and close this issue as a duplicate of #21.\n. Hey @davecheney and @mreiferson, could I ask for a\nquick review of this? Thoughts?\n\nBasically this gives a more tightly focused set of dependency\npackages at the cost of more entries in the manifest.\n\nDo you like this change? Or prefer the current way?\n. As an example, before this change, importing package\n`github.com/crowdmob/goamz/sqs` would result in one json entry:\n\n```\n        {\n            \"ImportPath\": \"github.com/crowdmob/goamz\",\n            \"Rev\": \"9bee4d46f8a986ae73c9c05e7359e940f9ffa80c\"\n        },\n```\n\nAnd that entire repo would be copied, including all its packages:\naws, cloudwatch, dynamodb, ec2, elb, exp, iam, s3, sqs, and testutil.\n\nWith this patch, you get two entries:\n\n```\n        {\n            \"ImportPath\": \"github.com/crowdmob/goamz/aws\",\n            \"Rev\": \"9bee4d46f8a986ae73c9c05e7359e940f9ffa80c\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"ImportPath\": \"github.com/crowdmob/goamz/sqs\",\n            \"Rev\": \"9bee4d46f8a986ae73c9c05e7359e940f9ffa80c\"\n        },\n```\n\nand only those two directories, aws and sqs, are copied.\n. Interesting point about the commit ids getting out of sync.\nI hadn't considered that explicitly. I think it's out of scope\nfor godep. After all, there are countless other ways things\ncould get out of sync, if people are editing them by hand.\nThe code could change, the commit id could simply be\nwrong, etc. As long as the json contents are generated by\n'godep save', I don't see how they could get out of sync.\nI'm inclined not to worry much about it.\n\nThe possible implication that they might _correctly_ diverge\nis a little more troubling. Not sure what to do to combat that\nfalse impression.\n\nI did think about putting a list of import paths inside the\nentry for a dependency, but went with this approach because\nit's a smaller change (and requires no changes to logic that\nconsumes the list), and out of a vague desire to keep the\nstructure flatter, with fewer optional or alternative fields,\nand not overdo the DRY impulse.\n\nI want it to be at least within the realm of possibility to\nconsume Godeps.json with things like [jq](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/) and shell\nscripts. So the flatter and more regular the better.\n. I hope we never have to make incompatible changes.\nAnd I hope the godep implementation doesn't have to\nget very much bigger or different. Ideally it will soon\nsettle into something that feels right.\n\nIf godep turns out to be fundamentally or drastically\nwrong, I'd probably rather start over with a separate\ntool with a different approach.\n\nMaybe there will arise a change we want to make that\nfits well within the godep approach but would best be\ndone as an incompatible format change (such as the\nsuggested list-of-paths approach in #35). Maybe we\ncan put this issue off until we're forced to address it.\nCan we get away with that?\n. Excellent, thanks!\n. I'm going to close this issue. Feel free to reopen it\nif there's still godep behavior that seems to be wrong.\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. Confirmed. This is a bug.\n. Yes, this is a serious bug. I'm away from my home country right now with limited internet and no real computer, so I can't properly test and verify the fix. I'll take a look at #46 and probably just merge it in the interest of expediency. Any non-fatal problems with the patch can be fixed later.\n. If restore fails to download a missing package, that's a bug.\nThis is related to #41 and should have been fixed in 6eb924d67ab5588a788376e7d8996f120998abf3.\n\nIf this is still a problem, please reopen.\n. Can you provide the actual error message you see?\nI don't immediately see why this wouldn't work.\n\nWhat happens when you run `go list -json` instead of `godep save`?\n. (My apologies for the delay. I was on out of the country\nwith limited computer access.)\n. It seems like you are trying to recreate some of the functionality of godep by hand. Why not just use godep?\n. > `go list -json` returns what you'd expect (failure)\n\nGodep assumes that you're in a standard Go workspace. That's a fundamental assumption and not likely to change. In particular, if the go tool itself doesn't work in your environment, then godep definitely won't work.\n. As you say, the go tool commands other than 'go get' don't care where you put the .git directory, and this is because they don't interact with git (or any other VCS) at all. However, godep interacts with git quite a lot, even more than go get, and I've chosen to support the most common convention, the same one that 'go get' encourages: repos that live inside subdirectories (typically domain names) of src.\n\nI don't see why you wouldn't be able to follow this convention too.\n\nTry something like this, mashing up both of your examples:\n\n```\n/home/user\n    src\n        company\n            branch\n                .git\n                ops\n                ansible\n                cpp\n                go/proj1\n                go/proj2\n                Makefile\n                README\n                whatever\n```\n\nIn your shell .profile, set `GOPATH=/home/user`.\n\nThen you can `cd ~/src/company/branch` and run `godep save ./...` to freeze all your dependencies for the entire organization in one repo, alongside non-go code. A typical import path for one of your go projects will be company/branch/go/proj1. Optionally, omit the 'go' directory level and make your import paths company/branch/proj1. Also optionally, instead of 'company/branch' you can use a valid domain name and path for your organization, and then the repo will be go-gettable.\n\n> I'm not sure i understand your comment about it not being a standard go workspace.\n\nAll I said was that if 'go list' doesn't work, then certainly godep won't work. But I don't think you meant to focus on the example you gave where that's the case.\n. @dickeyxxx I wasn't able to reproduce the error you describe.\n\nHere's what I get:\n\n```\nume:~ kr$ go get github.com/dickeyxxx/martini-godep\nume:~ kr$ cd src/github.com/dickeyxxx/martini-godep\nume:martini-godep kr$ godep save\nume:martini-godep kr$ \n```\n. Ok well, it's true that godep interacts with the VCS a lot, but this particular case was a little excessive. Does #107 solve this issue?\n. After more thought, I have what I think is a better approach in #108.\n\nI'd love to know if that solves the issue here.\n. Thanks for the minimal test case. This still isn't working because godep tries to keep track of which packages are subdirectories of other packages by the import path, but the import path of the root looks like `_/home/rich/dev/godep_example/src` and therefore `github.com/rliebling/main` looks like it's not contained in the same tree.\n\nI think we might be able to do this in terms of filepaths instead. I will try.\n. I'm continuing to work on this, but I should reiterate that I _strongly_ recommend you set up a single GOPATH for your computer and put the git repos inside it. It will make your life easier.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/bketelsen/status/456036577010270208\n. Please note the example in http://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces depicts repo roots _inside_ subdirectories of src. That's not an accident.\n. It still seems like you should be able to accomplish all you describe, including the docker and vagrant stuff, with the example layout I proposed [above](https://github.com/tools/godep/issues/43#issuecomment-51306728). I think you can include docker stuff to help out people with the go bits of a non-go project while the repo layout fits inside a standard go workspace. Then people will have the option of using either standard go tooling or the special container tooling you describe.\n\nIf your developers ever have other go projects they want to work on, then the layout with a src directory inside the repo will cause them trouble\u2014they'll have to start switching their GOPATH depending on whether they're working on this particular project (or else they'll have to use the special Makefile or Dockerfile or whatever build procedure in this project instead of using the standard Go tools). But perhaps that is YAGNI.\n\nRegardless, it seems like you are creating extra work for yourself here. Many people use docker or vagrant for a standardized build environment for Go and other languages, but usually the developers end up cloning the project to work on from inside the container, or the container does this automatically. Once you're inside the container, you can do whatever's best for whatever language you're working with at the moment, since it's so easy to set up for new people. They can use standard C makefiles, standard go tooling, a uniform JVM version, whatever.\n. @rliebling that's totally fair. :)\n\nIt's possible my next change (mentioned [above](https://github.com/tools/godep/issues/43#issuecomment-51673270)) will make this work for you. If not, my apologies.\n. If the working tree is dirty, godep ought to refuse to save outright.\n. Regardless of how the working tree is dirty (changed files,\nuntracked files, whatever), godep should refuse to save.\n\nIf it used a fresh checkout, then you'd be saving something\nthat doesn't match what you had been using to test, before\nyou ran godep.\n\nI'll try to fix this. Is there a git command that can report\n(ideally by exit status) whether the tree is dirty?\n. I have a possible fix in cb8be8bb6e8475bff5bc30b1d1aa68174bb152e1. Does that patch do something reasonable for you?\n. Thanks. I don't know if I'll be able to fix this before\nI go on vacation, but hopefully you can get by with\nthe workaround for a few weeks.\n. Awesome. A reproducible test case makes this so much easier! Thanks.\n. That is a relief. I'll go ahead and close this issue now. If folks come asking about it in the future we can direct them to update to Go 1.5.\n\n@freeformz \n. This isn't the right place to do this. If the package doesn't exist\nin the filesystem, LoadPackages should say so. Setting Root\nto an element of GOPATH yields false information.\n\nBug #41 is fixed in 6eb924d67ab5588a788376e7d8996f120998abf3.\n. What problem is this meant to solve?\n. I agree a version command would be useful for people.\n\nThe main difficulty I have with this approach is having to remember to bump the version string for pretty much every single commit. This is necessary since the main way to install godep is with 'go get', and there's little reason to distribute infrequent tarballs or anything like that.\n\nIf necessary I guess I could just suck it up and deal with that, but I'm trying to think of other solutions that don't have that drawback.\n\nAny ideas?\n. Agreed, I'd like this case to work better, but I'm not convinced this patch is the best approach. My gut feeling is there's a way to make godep do the right thing without a flag.\n\nFirst, I'd argue your project _does_ follow the directory naming conventions for Go as described in http://golang.org/doc/code.html. You'll note that document doesn't require the repo root to be beneath the src directory, that's only the \"typical\" case.\n. I don't have a specific solution. I just mean that the behavior here should be useful, predictable, and in line with godep's (and Go's) established conventions. If there's no vcs root available (for example, because the vcs root is outside the gopath element as in your case), then perhaps godep can use some other directory as the \"root\". Or, for the current project, it might be able to get away without a root at all \u2013\u00a0it already uses the current directory as the location for Godeps. Maybe that alone is sufficient. Or, maybe there's another way to get the vcs root reliably. AFAIK package vcs uses GOPATH entries so it can construct an import path for the root of the repo, so maybe we could use \"/\" as the srcRoot when calling FromDir, as a fallback. That might be enough information for godep to do its job in the same way it already does.\n. The 'godep path' output isn't meant to go in your bashrc.\nIt's just a way to recreate what 'godep go' does \u2013 to let you\nmake a sandbox for running tools other than the go tool.\n\nRunning 'godep restore' will try to download code into\nyour GOPATH. The sandbox for the project already has\nall the code in it, so trying to restore with the sandbox in\nyour GOPATH will produce strange results.\n. Another attempt to put this: if you're only using the\nstandard go tool, you don't need 'godep path'.\n. @mreiferson is referring to the original behavior of godep; it's now what you get when you run `godep save -copy=false`. Instead of a directory, it puts just the json manifest in a plain file `Godeps`. Then running `godep go whatever` will fetch all the dependencies into $TMPDIR on the fly and build a gopath.\n\nIt's complex and slow compared to checking in all the source code but seems to work ok.\n. > is there another way to use godep non-vendored?\n\nYou can add `src` into the .gitignore file by hand.\nSeveral projects have done this, including\nhttps://github.com/antifuchs/zeus/tree/revamp-build.\n. Godep doesn't (currently) do anything special when src is ignored.\n`godep path` will just print {projectroot}/Godeps/_workspace. For a\nfresh clone, it's not very useful, since it'll be empty of source code.\n. I think it would be reasonable to have `godep restore` restore packages to _both_ the outer GOPATH and the local _workspace dir, so that both match what's listed in Godeps.json.\n\nI think that would solve the original issue here, without removing the original intent of `godep restore`, which is to be the opposite of `godep save` (taking its list from the repo and installing outside, rather than taking its list from outside and installing into the current repo).\n. > If `godep save` creates and uses `Godeps/_workspace` by _default_ it seems like it's dual - `godep restore` - should do the same. I was hoping it would create the workspace if it did not exist.\n\nGodep save creates and uses Godeps; its dual - restore - does the opposite. The first reads your GOPATH and writes to Godeps; the second reads Godeps and writes to your GOPATH.\n\n---\n\nI have a different proposal now:\n\nCommands 'godep go' and 'godep path' should make an effort to make sure code is available. If `src` is checked in, there's nothing extra to do, they can just use `Godeps/_workspace` as they currently do. If `src` is missing, they should attempt to fetch code and put it in `Godeps/_workspace/src` (similar to godep's original behavior, but simpler).\n\nWhat does everyone think of this? Would it solve the problem?\n\nA potential follow-on to this would be to change the -copy=false behavior to produce the directory structure being discussed here, Godeps/_workspace with 'src' in gitignore. This would let us deprecate and eventually remove a big chunk of complex code supporting creation of the old TMPDIR workspace.\n. Restore is sometimes necessary when updating dependencies or saving new dependencies. Those other commands would have to be more careful if we want them to work without access to the full dependency set in $GOPATH.\n\nThis would be helped with better documentation for 'godep restore'. Restore is the opposite of save: save takes packages from GOPATH and puts the corresponding list of commit IDs in Godeps; restore takes a list of commit IDs from Godeps and puts the corresponding packages in GOPATH.\n. I would instead say that the premise of this issue is increasingly invalid: \"non-vendored operation\" is something that godep doesn't support. When folks ask how to handle the Godeps directory when they don't commit the source code, the response should be \"you should commit the source code\". If they _really_ don't want to vendor code, then godep is not the tool for them.\n. Overriding the whole thing means the current project (everything outside\nof Godeps/_workspace) is not in GOPATH. I'd expect that to be ok for an\nisolated package but not if the current package imports something else, e.g.\nhttps://github.com/antifuchs/zeus/blob/master/go/zeusmaster/zeusmaster.go#L8\n\nWould #6 be sufficient instead?\n. Just to spell out the example above, if zeusmaster imports\ngithub.com/burke/zeus/go/clienthandler, I'd expect the go tool\nto be unable to find clienthandler, since it's not in the godep\nsandbox, and so nowhere to be found in GOPATH.\n. I think `godep get package` already does what you want.\n\n```\nyuzu:~ kr$ ls bin\ngodep\nyuzu:~ kr$ ls src/github.com/mitchellh\nls: src/github.com/mitchellh: No such file or directory\nyuzu:~ kr$ godep get github.com/mitchellh/gox\nyuzu:~ kr$ ls bin\ngodep   gox\n```\n\nAm I misunderstanding?\n. Oh, yes I'm misunderstanding. You want to compile and install the\nversion of gox listed in zeus's manifest, not whatever's at the tip of\nmaster in gox's repo.\n. Since leaving those comments I realized I don't fully understand what you're asking for. :'(\n\nCould you give maybe some example directory trees, or command sessions (including fictitious commands) showing the desired workflow?\n. Good call. It should be more careful about when to delete the old Godeps.\n. Merged as 0eddae56318276eb16180e29594092d3d0f7094e. Thanks!\n. Ah, I have an idea for what this could be.\n. Uh, I left that comment on my phone on a train and then forgot to follow up. Now I don't remember what the idea was.\n\nMaybe something to do with git setting timestamps in the past during a checkout, but I doubt that would explain this case since I know hk has had commits since Jan 17.\n\nIt's hard to understand what's going wrong here. The command you ran `godep go build` is really just doing the equivalent of:\n\n```\n$ GOPATH=/path/to/hk/Godeps/_workspace:$GOPATH go build\n```\n. Hopefully de4fb952cb414a9a9ddbeeabf68cc851718417a7 has fixed this satisfactorily.\n\nPlease reopen this issue (or open a new one) if there's still a problem.\n. Godep can't simply follow symlinks, because that can result in pathological behavior. (Consider a symlink that points to its parent directory.) Godep is in a similar situation to the standard go tool with respect to symlinks. As Ian Lance Taylor [put it](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-dev/GLUZGtUSj8A/SGUtCooLIT0J):\n\n> Yes.  In general the go tool does not work well with symlinks.  There\n> is no current plan to change this.  Any fix would have to describe a\n> complete and coherent solution for how symlinks should be handled.  I\n> don't know what that would look like.\n\nGodep is in the same boat.\n. You can use 'go get' on private repos if you put a github access token in `~/.netrc`.\n\nHere's a (fake) example:\n\n```\nmachine github.com\n  login kr\n  password d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e\n```\n\nThis works for the plain go tool and anything else that uses it, not just godep.\n. I agree it makes sense for godep to have this.\n\nFor your particular case, is there a reason you can't put the import in a regular source file, without any build constraints?\n. @wfreeman @oxtoacart does pull request #66 fix this problem for you?\n. I went ahead and merged my proposed fix. If you still see the problem, please reopen this issue or open a new one. :)\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. Go programmers typically do this without godep's help. Put the dependency in your filesystem under its original import path. Commit any changes you like and push them to and from any remote repositories from there.\n\nFeel free to reopen this if I'm misunderstanding the situation you describe, but I think it doesn't belong in godep.\n. Ok, understood. This problem has come up in my projects as well. Godep with vendoring made it easier for us to test and deploy our changes in staging and production before they were merged upstream.\n\nGodep is primarily a vendoring tool. I highly recommend that approach.\n. Eventually I'd like to support subversion, but it's not very high on my todo list. I'd gladly accept a well-written patch for this.\n. This should become possible after we remove -copy=false mode from the save command.\n. > It would have to work transitively as well right?\n\nYes.\n. Started working on this yesterday.\n. I've thought about the directory name more since this issue was opened. The benefit to changing the name is small, and purely aesthetic. It's not worth having extra logic (and the accordant extra documentation). Plus, the top level element will never be anything other than exactly 'Godeps', so the shortest it could be is 'Godeps/_something'.\n. Another approach is to make changes in the upstream project and re-vendor it to test in your own project. You might also ask other projects that already rewrite import paths, such as camlistore, to see their workflow.\n. PTAL at #82. I think it is about ready to merge.\n. Maintaining patches to a project you don't own is quite a bit of additional work, yes.\n\n> I'd probably need to fork the dependency into my own \"vendor\" repo (separate from the consumer repo), maintain any changes there, and then vendor that into the product.\n\nI think you're taking on a little unnecessary extra work for yourself here.\n\nFor nontrivial patches I agree you should fork the upstream library on github and use that to publish your pending PRs. But don't change its import path, develop your patch in the original directory. Then the act of vendoring this library will be the same whether or not your patch has been merged yet.\n. Yes, agreed. I've been thinking of having godep also put git URLs\nin the json manifest, in case the listed commit isn't available in the\nimplicit url that the go tool derives from the import path.\n. Cool, I'm glad this got fixed, even if inadvertently. I should add a test to make sure it doesn't regress.\n. Thanks for reporting this. We definitely need to work on handling symlinks better.\n\nWhat does the `go list ./...` command you mentioned print?\n. The originally reported error message says the working directory was /Users/lachlan/Projects/xyz/xyz, but the accompanying description says it was ~/.go/src/github.com/xyz/xyz. Which is it?\n\nA working directory of /Users/lachlan/Projects/xyz/xyz is definitely not following the standard Go code layout described at http://golang.org/doc/code.html. This is a basic assumption of godep; it's not going to change.\n. Yes, my apologies, I misremembered the direction of the symlink.\n\nThe problem here is that Getwd returns the actual directory on disk, rather than a path containing a symlink. In general, it is not possible for the Go process (or any other process) to determine which path was used to arrive at that directory.\n\n```\n$ mkdir a\n$ ln -s a b\n$ cd b\n$ python -c 'import os; print os.getcwd()'\n/Users/kr/tmp/a\n```\n. > I'm not even sure how one would fix this particular problem.\n\nDon't use symlinks.\n. > All that said, AFAICT, the go command itself seems to have no problem with this setup.\n\nIf you run 'go list', it doesn't print github.com/xyz/xyz, even though that's the import path of the package. This is a problem.\n. > the \"standard Go layout\" doesn't work out so well when you're trying to, for example, include a repo of go code as a submodule in some other non-Go repo.\n\nI'd like to hear more about this situation, and why it's necessary in the first place. What are you trying to do?\n. > The other alternative is to simply import all the Go code into the main Perl repo, then check that out under the GOPATH and adjust our Go code import paths to match this. It's a pain, but clearly fighting Go is a pain too.\n\nYeah, that's what I'd recommend, if you want to keep your Go code in the same repo as the Perl. Move all the files and change the import paths. Sorry.\n\nI'm still curious why you want it to be in a subdirectory in the first place (either via submodules or copying files).\n. > As opposed to what?\n\nAs opposed to keeping it in a separate repo.\n\nYou mentioned that you want to share a test harness, but I'm not quite making the connection. Even if the code for the test harness is in the Perl repo, that doesn't necessarily mean you can't use it when your working directory is in another repo.\n. Ok. Well at this point it seems like there's not really anything godep can do to help. You just have to keep your go code in a standard go workspace (a symlink mimicking a standard go workspace pointing to code that actually lives elsewhere isn't the same thing) if you want godep to work.\n\nNote, there's a similar discussion happening in #43. It's almost always possible to use a standard go workspace, even in a repo that spans many projects over the whole organization, and uses multiple programming languages.\n\nI'm going to close this issue, but feel free to keep the discussion going, and let me know if you have any other concrete ideas for how godep might help.\n. (I'd use the \"wontfix\" label, but it's really more like \"can't fix\". :bow:)\n. Publishing your docs would be fantastic! Godep could use more guides written in a different voice and different communication styles.\n. @intabulas do you mind opening an issue for case sensitivity? I'm not sure what (if anything) godep can do to help there, but it would be a separate problem (despite resulting in the same error message).\n. cc @simonz05 @fdr \n. Agreed, something like this would be nice. And possibly also a more explicit baked-in pre-commit hook.\n. On a second look, this seems to be a duplicate of #1.\n. @bmizerany that ought to be an error. I'll add a test for that case and make sure it does the right thing. Thanks.\n. Thanks everyone. I'm just working on fixing @bmizerany's reported bug in da956b74d2617869f583a8a2db27dc6680e991f2  and then I'll merge this.\n. Ok, I think this is ready. If you're into code review, now would be a great time for comments. :)\n. Thanks so much! Whew. Now on to #68!\n. The usual approach with the go tool is to clone the repo from github (with the usual 'go get github.com/x/y'), make local changes there, and (optionally) push your changes to your public fork if you want them to be merged upstream. It's the same with godep.\n\nDon't ever change import path github.com/x/y to github.com/myfork/y unless you intend to maintain a separate project indefinitely.\n. You don't need the '-r' flag to maintain a temporary fork. Just stick with the original import path and you should be ok. Remember, an import path is just a directory ('go get' is the only go command that accesses the network). When you run 'godep save', you'll pick up the code in that directory, just as when you run 'go install'.\n\nYour modified source code will go into _workspace, and the hash of your commit in Godeps.json.\n\nFor project P using dependency X:\n1. go get X\n2. make your changes to X until it works\n3. godep update X\n4. commit and share P\n\nOptional:\n1. fork X on github\n2. push your X changes to your fork\n3. at some point the pull requests is accepted\n4. godep update X\n5. delete your fork\n. > However, as long as you have a fork of a package, nobody else will be able to run godep restore because nothing in your Godeps.json teaches them in what repository they will find the Rev in question, right?\n\nThat's right. I had been considering adding a field to Godeps.json to handle this case for some time. This issue is mentioned in https://github.com/kardianos/vendor-spec/issues/6 and #207 that I can find.\n. Thanks! This is what I get for rushing a patch out for testing before getting on an airplane. :sweat_smile:  \n. I had some trouble installing scollector, but I was able to reproduce what you describe with github.com/heroku/hk.\n1. There are incorrect whitespace changes. Maybe this has something to do with how I'm using package [go/printer](http://godoc.org/go/printer).\n2. Rewriting import paths that aren't part of the dependency manifest was a bug. I've pushed an updated commit to the branch and now hk with rewriting compiles cleanly for me.\n3. I'll look into the build constraints. Does it miss out putting the dependency in the list, or just rewriting the path?\n4. To get packages in subdirectories, use `godep save -r ./...`. Godep follows the convention established by the go tool: for commands that take a list of packages, no argument means the same as just dot (`.`).\n. The whitespace formatting problem should be fixed now. Can you confirm @mjibson?\n\nI'll work on the build tags next.\n. Yes, it's pushed. Github doesn't do such a hot job of indicating revisions to a patch.\nYou can see the newest code on https://github.com/tools/godep/pull/82/files if you\nsearch for \"Config\".\n. FYI the commit id is 550fdb6a9c9a78bf17c6771a17ceadd88d39e1cb.\n. Ok, then the build tag problem is a separate bug. It would happen even if\nyou didn't use `-r`. I'll open an issue for that and track it separately from the\nrewriting pull request. Probably fix it after merging this.\n. Opened #84 to track build constraints.\n\nWith that, I think this issue is resolved and I'm almost ready to merge #82.\n. Thanks for reporting all these issues!\n. PTAL.\n\nI think this is about ready to merge.\n. At last this is merged! Thanks for all the feedback everyone. :heart: :smile: :heart:\n. The current approach is to duplicate the go tool's logic for scanning packages (and therefore stop calling the go tool). But that's a substantial amount of new code for godep (about 1000 lines), so I just asked about a couple of possible alternatives on golang-nuts:\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-nuts/4Bgl5DcPuBw/UjGonF4nOpAJ\n. Thanks for reporting this!\n\nFirst, I should point out that you'll need to use 'godep update' to\nupdate a dependency to a newer version. Try this:\n\n```\n$ go get -u github.com/mitchellh/goamz/...\n$ godep update github.com/mitchellh/goamz/...\n```\n\n(There's no need to run godep restore beforehand.) Command 'save'\npreserves versions of packages already listed in Godeps.json.\n\nSecond, you uncovered a bug in save when it scans the old and new\nlists of dependencies to carry over existing versions. It doesn't prioritize\nexact matches as it should, and so it's incorrectly comparing\ngoamz/aws with goamz/s3, when it should in this case compare each\npackage in the old list with its exact companion in the new list.\n\nThird, that error message is terribly unhelpful. It should be improved.\n. @buro9 would you mind trying again to verify that commit bbdfa05 fixes the problem you saw?\n\nI also opened #86 so we get a better error message there.\n. It's a basic requirement of godep (and a common assumption in go tooling in general) that the repo should be in a standard Go workspace. I don't think it's worth spending effort to try to accommodate situations where that assumption doesn't hold.\n\nIt's not very hard to determine where the repo ought to be placed when cloning it to a fresh system; that's part of the purpose of the ImportPath entry in Godeps.json.\n\nAlso, this strategy isn't portable; windows doesn't support symlinks.\n. I don't have any experience with Jenkins in particular, but I'd be surprised if it really can't be configured to work with a standard Go project. Other popular CI systems, including Travis, work with Go just fine.\n. I'm sorry, we can't be adding code to godep to accommodate every peculiar environment out there. Please use a standard Go workspace as described in http://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces.\n. This patch is fine if you (or the user) is using `godep restore` to work with the repo. The reason for the error message is that `godep go` doesn't work when a dependency uses bzr. Maybe this should be a warning?\n. Your directory tree looks ok, if a little unusual.\n\nJust don't ever use relative imports such as `./web` in Go source code.\n. Relative paths in import statements are prohibited inside a work space.\nhttps://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Relative_import_paths\n\nGodep isn't going to make any effort to support something the standard 'go' tool doesn't.\n. Thank you so much!\n. This was fixed in #95 d7653730bd16b6a001e5b54d603bd519a86c5f11.\n. My apologies for the late response on this. Thanks so much for the fix!\n. Thanks so much for reporting this. I wasn't at a computer earlier. :)\n. This is a dup of #94 and was fixed a while ago. Sorry I missed updating this issue!\n. Thanks for the patch! I think this is a promising approach.\n\nYou might have to do all the unqualify calls in a separate pass before the main loop in Godeps.Load, to make the containsPathPrefix check work properly. Sorting the paths is important to make sure we don't accidentally include a dependency D's subdirectory in addition to the D itself. (Imagine importing both A/Godeps/_workspace/src/D/X and D itself \u2013\u00a0we'd end up listing both D and D/X.) The current modification to the behavior of containsPathPrefix doesn't seem to cover this case (aside from just being unexpected behavior anyway).\n. Another reason to do the unqualify calls earlier is that they can hopefully be done before even calling LoadPackages. Modifying pkg.ImportPath and pkg.Dir but assuming the same pkg.Root isn't correct \u2013 two dependencies might come from two different Roots.\n. Also, you can delete readGodepsForImportPath entirely. Yay!\n. Sure, I can help make some test cases.\n. Looks like there are three things to test here:\n1. Windows paths (can't easily unit test)\n2. Multiple GOPATH roots.\n3. Excluding subdirectories.\n\nI pushed a commit (f3038ffa61657b7a39328d39e7c2505557dfee86) that tests those last two.\n. Looking pretty good! A couple of small comments and then we just need a unit test covering the new behavior.\n. Beautiful. This is the best kind of patch! Deleting code :heart:\n\nIf you're not comfortable adding a unit test for this change, I'm happy to do it.\n. Merged as f6274c18822c8931834f558a5dde22864a089a0f. Thanks so much!\n. My understanding of appengine is that they provide two separate implementations of their packages for the SDK and the production system. Even if godep were to save appengine/..., it wouldn't work.\n\nIf this is right, then we need some way to exclude appengine packages.\n\nIt could be built in to godep as in https://github.com/matthewbelisle-wf/godep/commit/dba190f14fc83759b74df44e4ab4e7a492eedb1d, or provided by the user as a flag, for example `-omit=appengine/...`.\n. I am leaning toward an \"ignore\" or \"omit\" flag plus a default list of patterns to ignore that is just appengine.\n. That's a good question. There isn't really a good way to specify these in godep.\n\nIf #84 were fixed (I'm working on it), you could do something like this:\n\n```\n// +build ignore\n\n// Dummy package so we can explicitly depend on build tools.\npackage dummy\n\nimport \"github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata/go-bindata\"\n```\n\nAnother way to look at these examples is as commands, used by the build process, that happen to be written in Go. What if some of them were written in Python or C? (Such as the protoc command itself.) This feels like potentially a can of worms.\n. Awesome. Thanks so much!\n. This seems worth considering. The go tool and vcs package take a different approach, having a verbose mode that prints the all arguments for each command. In general, I'd prefer to approach things the same way as the standard tooling unless there's a good reason to be different.\n. Any anyway, thanks for putting in this work! It will be useful one way or another. :)\n. This PR is meant to address #43.\n. This should fix #43 as well.\n. I've thought through this case before but clearly the current approach is not working well yet. (I'm a little puzzled by importing `github.com/coreos/fleet` itself \u2013\u00a0that's a command. But the same problem would arise from importing other packages in that same repo.)\n\nThe problem here is that godep expects all dependencies to be present in GOPATH, so it can load info about them and copy the code. But transitive dependencies (such as `github.com/godbus/dbus`) that have been copied into an intermediate package's repo (such as `github.com/coreos/fleet`) might not be installed under their original import paths, as seen above. \n\nHonestly, the best solution to this problem is to avoid it in the first place: libraries should not use godep at all, only commands (package main) should.\n\nHere's one possible way godep might enforce that:\n1. Of the packages given on the command line, consider only main packages, and discard others.\n2. If this results in the empty set, it's simply an error.\n3. Copy all dependencies, even the ones that live in the same repo.\n\nThis has the drawback that when developing, edits to packages in the same repo won't be picked up by the commands until you rerun godep save.\n\nAnother alternative would be to continue godep's current approach of \"undoing\" import path rewriting when copying packages that have already used godep, and to add more logic to automatically run 'go get' or otherwise fetch packages that aren't readily available in GOPATH.\n. I'm interested in more opinions about this @bcwaldon @philips @bmizerany @bradfitz.\n. Where would you get \"whateverhash\" from, and why should it be any more trustworthy than the code you can get directly from https://github.com/tools/godep/archive/master.tar.gz? (Or from 'go get', which also uses https on github.)\n. Looks like you are using Go version 1, which came out well over two years ago. The package code.google.com/p/go.tools/go/vcs (which is used by godep) uses features of the language that were introduced after that release. If you want to compile godep, you'll have to download a newer Go version, I recommend the latest, which is 1.3.1, and can be found at http://golang.org/dl/.\n\nAlso, I apologize that the error message in this situation is so unhelpful.\n. Maybe wontfix/cantfix is more appropriate. There are two problems here:\n1. We don't support ancient versions of Go. I agree it's arguably a problem but it's better for people to upgrade than to keep supporting outdated releases.\n2. The error message is terrible. This is for sure a problem but there's no good way to fix it. Brad started [a thread about this](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-dev/jyQq8ZYmZaI/_2ulYK67RykJ) recently but there's still no good solution.\n. Yes, this is a bug.\n. Good call. Thanks for reporting this.\n. Anything godep does has to work on Windows. This rules out symlinks.\n\nAs a first step, we might add a command such as 'godep check', that tells you if there are any dependencies missing from Godeps.\n. I have hope that this can be solved without exposing additional knobs. The general approach I would take: godep should find all dependencies, ignoring `// +build` lines entirely. It should behave as if all build constraints are satisfied when finding imports. #84 has a little bit of discussion on this topic.\n. This approach wouldn't change what gets built, only what code is included in the repository.\n. > could then be triggered with a `-tag` by the builder\n\nIf that's the case, then the alternative is it wouldn't build at all for that builder.\n\nIt's still the responsibility of the person running `godep save` to at least glance at the diff to make sure it's reasonable, regardless of what godep does about tags.\n. I suppose not building at all can be preferable to including unsupported code for an unsupported build configuration. Hmmm.\n. Thanks for doing this work! This looks similar to #1, would you consider updating this patch to provide the interface described there?\n. Usually, people run `godep save` with no further arguments, or `godep save ./...` to save the dependencies of all packages inside the current directory.\n\nIf you want import statements to refer to the copied source code, use flag `-r` and it will rewrite them for you. You don't have to do it by hand.\n\nHope this helps!\n. Ah, I see those import paths were already rewritten. That's fine, you can leave them as is. But the godep usage typically stays the same: whenever you add or remove a dependency, rerun `godep save -r` to pull in the new code.\n. The flag `-r` isn't quite right yet, which is why I haven't been promoting its use much so far. It works for most cases, but there are a few corner cases that need fixing.\n. Of course!\n. This looks great, thanks!\n. Sent github/linguist#1549.\n. The patch was merged into linguist earlier today, so now we just wait for github to deploy.\n. Note, we are currently waiting on github/linguist#2017.\n. > Though it wouldn't help if paths became internal/github.com/...\n\nYeah, I was thinking about that recently.\nWe'll cross that bridge when we come to it.\n. The fix is live on github as of a few hours ago. :tada: \n. Good call. The documentation needs a lot of work. Thanks for reporting this.\n. Is it possible to use the commit hash (perhaps abbreviated) as the version?\n. By the way, thanks for doing this!\n\nI will make a tag if that's the only way, but given that we don't do any of the other things that usually accompany a version tag (for example, releasing tarballs, providing compiled binaries, having a `godep version` command), sticking with commit hashes for now would be preferable.\n\nPlease also let me know if there's anything else I can do to help.\n. Ah, good idea! I think I'll tag the first commit (36059b6) as `0`. Would that satisfy your needs?\n. Done https://github.com/tools/godep/tree/0\n\nThanks again!\n. I think it's a fine concept. The output seems a little haphazard. It would be nice if it were more predictable, but maybe that's not feasible.\n. Thanks for all this discussion folks. It's super helpful! :sparkling_heart: \n. Did you mean #243? Looks like #153 is still open (but should be closed?).\n. Thanks for writing this patch!\n. Sorry, this isn't going to change.\n. Sorry, the go toolchain does not allow package names ending in `.go`.\n\nhttps://code.google.com/p/go/issues/detail?id=8782\n. No problem, glad it worked out! :)\n. Yes, you're absolutely right on all counts. We're explicitly trying to avoid having two different revisions from the same repo.\n\nReally need a better error message for this.\n. Ideally it should say why there is an error and what to do about it, like:\n\n```\ngodep: cannot update repo/A without repo/B\n\nRun 'godep update repo/...' to update all packages from repo.\n```\n. Yeah, we should fix this. Thanks!\n. Thanks for doing this!\n\nWould it be better to refuse to vendor the package if there are untracked files? That's what we do when any tracked files are modified, and this is arguably the same thing: the repo is \"dirty\".\n. What's wrong with copying ignored files? (We also copy `.gitignore`, so they should still be ignored even after the copy.)\n. True. Ok let me give this a more thorough review.\n. I've covered this in a couple of talks (here's one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myCHCXFFTPY), but I haven't written it down yet.\n\nBasic flow:\n1. Go into `src/github.com/foo/bar` and commit your change.\n2. Publish your change to your fork, and send a pull request.\n3. Go back to `src/github.com/marcesher/myproject` and rerun `godep save`.\n\nThis will vendor your modified code along with the commit id. When the project merges your change, you won't have to do anything, your commit is now included in the project's history.\n. Can you provide a test case? I haven't been able to reproduce the behavior you describe.\n. The ideal would be to automatically detect whether to rewrite import statements. It is always possible to do this: if flag `-r` was previously used there must be at least one import statement already rewritten, in a source file of one of the packages listed in Godeps.json under `Packages`.\n. I'd love to review a patch, @deoxxa. Thanks! I am also happy to discuss the approach further, if you prefer, before you write code.\n. This looks great. Do you mind rebasing this? Otherwise I can do it.\n. Thanks so much!\n. PTAL @bgentry @dsymonds @mjibson @ryandotsmith @bmizerany \n. I am starting to wonder if the regexp is more trouble than it is worth. If it gets any more unwieldy, I will be tempted to try something else altogether.\n\nAnyway,\nPTAL\n. Sorry, the list needs to go in a well-known place so that other tools can find it later. Making it configurable would defeat the purpose.\n. I agree with @freeformz on this.\n. Thanks for the fix! :grinning: \n. Done. Thanks for the report!\n. Update matches its arguments as a pattern against the list of dependencies. By construction, none of the dependency packages are inside `.`, so the pattern `./...` matches none of them. If you want to match all dependencies, the easiest way is to use `...`.\n. This is reasonable for a start. Another possibility would be to copy code from the go tool to download all packages in process. This would give much more control over this process, and let us fix one or two other issues as well. However, that would be a lot more work.\n\nFor checking the error output of `go get`, there are a couple of things to consider:\n1. If the `godep restore` is eventually successful, it should produce be no output.\n2. If it is not successful, each error should be printed exactly once.\n. This is no longer a problem with Go 1.5 and `GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1` in your environment.\n. > What is the issue with giving users more control over how Godep behaves?\n\nA proliferation of knobs and switches creates drag on both the interface and implementation. That makes it harder to design and implement truly important changes as they arise. Each new feature must \"pay its way\" by providing more benefit than the cost of maintaining it for the rest of eternity. This is doubly true for features that expose configuration options. (The ideal new feature \"just works\" without any change in the user's behavior. [Adding more configuration is an admission of failure.](http://ometer.com/preferences.html))\n\n> In this case I've proposed an option to increase the utility of Godep.\n\nThis change would give a _local_ increase in utility\u2014confined to a few unusual cases\u2014at the cost of a small but _global_ decrease in the utility of Godep\u2014for the numerous \"background\" use cases. It is not clear to me that the few occurrences of increased utility add up to more than the global cost.\n\nIt seems to me like a net decrease in utility.\n\nHowever, these days @freeformz probably has a better idea than I do about how godep is being used. We should defer to his estimate.\n. We could also solve this by using godep on itself. ;)\n. The parser can accept a []byte or string as the third argument. It would be nice not to create a temporary file in the filesystem, but instead keep the intermediate file in memory.\n. LGTM\n. Thanks so much!\n. Sounds like DWIM. If I type `godep save`, it's not the same thing as `godep save ./...`.\n\nStoring the -r might be ok, but then how would a project switch to not rewriting import paths?\n\nIf we did something like this, then the rules for godep's behavior would be more complicated. It would be a guessing game what exactly it'll do when you run `godep save`, and it's not really clear how to get the \"real\" `godep save` behavior when that's what you want.\n. You can import another package's main package:\n\n##### depmain/main.go\n\n``` go\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\nvar X int\n\nfunc main() {\n    fmt.Println(\"hello from dependency\")\n}\n```\n\n##### example/main.go\n\n``` go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n\n    _ \"depmain\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    fmt.Println(\"hello from example\")\n}\n```\n\n```\n$ go run main.go \nhello from example\n$ go install\n$ example\nhello from example\n```\n\nThis only works if you haven't installed the other package as a binary in your `$GOPATH/bin`.\n. The save and update commands check for this case and prevent it from happening. Godeps.json should never contain two different commit hashes from the same repo. If it happens anyway, that's a bug.\n. @thockin is right tho, even though godep tries to avoid this situation, it's reasonable to also check for it later, because who knows what happened to the file in between.\n. The approach I've tried to take so far is to let package main decide which revision of each dependency to use. Normally, a dependency package that itself has further dependencies should not even use godep. A repo like etcd is a little more confusing because it also has some commands, so they vendor all their deps. But when using packages from etcd in another project, we should try to treat the etcd packages as if they hadn't vendored anything.\n\nGodep could try to use etcd's recorded revision of those leaf dependencies, but that strategy doesn't always work: it's possible to have two repos that have each vendored a different revision of a leaf package. Our approach so far is to use a simple rule consistently: always let the user choose. The way the user expresses this choice is by installing their chosen revision of each dependency (leaf or otherwise) into their $GOPATH.\n\nHowever, there's certainly still room for making this more convenient. If a project has a lot of dependency repos like etcd, it's tedious to run `godep restore` for each one. Godep could potentially make this process more automatic. But note that that if the same leaf dependency has been vendored in multiple repos, the user will be left with an arbitrary revision of it in GOPATH\u2014whichever one was restored last. Maybe that's fine, but I'm a little worried that folks might not be aware of that. It could go unnoticed for a long time, and might be an unwelcome surprise.\n. It is a basic assumption of godep that you are vendoring packages, not commands.\n\nI agree that it would be useful to vendor commands along with their dependencies, but as you have indicated, that's a different thing, and godep doesn't really do that (yet). It might sort of work, but if so, that is a consequence of godep not being careful enough about what it does, not a deliberate feature.\n. The very rough plan is to change godep to use the new /vendor/ directory layout, possibly guarded by a command line flag. Then if the go tool -vendor flag is successful, godep will use that layout by default and remove import path rewriting (the -r flag) entirely.\n. I'm going to help update godep to support the new format, but I won't have the time it would take to devote to a whole new tool.\n. However, that certainly shouldn't stop anyone else if they want to try that route. Godep is open source, so if its code would help they are welcome to use it!\n. I think this is actually #160.\n. +1 LGTM\n. Rad, looking at this now.\n. BTW, maybe I should write this up in a [contributing.md file](https://github.com/blog/1184-contributing-guidelines), but this project has a \"rebase & squash\" policy. It's fine for a pull request to have multiple commits, but to land it should be rebased on top of master and squashed into a single commit.\n. LGTM after the minor things above.\n. This sounds reasonable to me. Some people complain about the amount of data it takes to vendor code, and vendoring the whole history will exacerbate those complaints, but personally I think it would be ok.\n. LGTM\n. PTAL\n. Uhh, it would have been nice to be able to address your feedback before we merged this. If we don't want travis complaining while this PR is still open the fix is to turn on this option:\n\n![build only if travis.yml is present](http://cl.ly/image/1h3o2g3P0M0J/Screen%20Shot%202015-07-02%20at%2010.30.11%20AM.png)\n\nI just turned it on.\n. Sorry, I guess I had 2 days' worth of chance to address the feedback. :sweat_smile:\n\nMy bad.\n. LGTM\n. Very exciting! I've also started playing around with this. Maybe there is something here that can help godep https://github.com/kr/vexp.\n\nI suspect the hardest part will be making godep work with both formats, projects saved with older versions of godep as well as the new vendor directory. And possibly also some sort of automatic or explicit migration.\n. Yeah as far as I know those are still unsolved questions.\n\nI think it's pretty safe to say that the result of vendoring should be a \"flat\" set of dependencies. That is, no \"vendor\" directory as a descendant another \"vendor\" directory. Seems to me like the hardest question is how to choose which version of each dependency.\n. Rebased.\n. I agree. What else do you think it would need?\n. LGTM\n. What do you think about putting Godeps.json inside vendor? It would mean more work for other tools that read that file (e.g. the Heroku buildpack) but it would produce less clutter in a project's root directory.\n\nEither way, LGTM\n. Looks like this was closed in fe7138c011ae7875d4af21efe8b237f4987d8c4a.\n. It should be copying all files, not just `.go` source files. See copySrc in save.go.\n. Aha, it seems the license file is in a parent directory of all the go packages. Since godep copies only packages, it misses the parent directory. Yes, this would be difficult to fix.\n\nAlthough godep mainly operates on packages, it already has some special cases for the root of a repository. It is not too hard to imagine another special case that copies all regular files from the repo root of any dependency. (We still want to avoid simply copying the entire repo, because it might contain some very large packages that are unused and could otherwise be omitted.)\n. Yeah, that would be reasonable as well.\n. LGTM\n. (I am assuming your GOROOT is `/usr/lib/go`; you can check this by running `go env`.)\n\nGodep tries to update packages on disk wherever they are found; if they are not found, it downloads them to the first entry in GOPATH, just like 'go get'.\n\nI would guess that `/usr/lib/go/src/golang.org/x/net/html` was created somehow outside of godep, and now that it exists, godep finds the package there and tries to update it. Or perhaps the first item in your GOPATH is `/usr/lib/go`\u2014if so, you should remove it. The value of GOROOT should not be in GOPATH.\n. Commands 'godep restore' and 'godep get' follow the same rules as the go tool for locating and downloading packages. That will remain the case. (In fact, godep doesn't download any packages itself, it just runs the go tool to do that work. Any behavior change there would have to happen in the go tool.)\n\nYou should remove the value of GOROOT from your GOPATH, if it's there. I also recommend you delete golang.org/x/net/html from your GOROOT, along with any other packages in GOROOT that aren't part of the standard library. That should get you back up and running, so that both 'godep restore' and 'go get' work properly for all packages.\n. Can you provide a complete program that exhibits the behavior you're describing? Please also include steps to reproduce the problem and describe the behavior you expected to see.\n. Godep uses the json file to, among other things, keep track of which dependencies it has vendored. If a package is listed in Godeps.json, godep will not bother to copy its source code into Godeps/_workspace/src.\n. The flag `-r` means to rewrite import paths.\n\nYou should use `godep save -r ./...` as your command.\n. You're welcome! :balloon: \n. Hah. :)\n. This sounds like a bug. If an updated dependency needs to pull in a new package, I think godep should do so.\n\nFor now, you can try to work around this by running `godep save -r` after running `godep update`.\n. It is safe to run `godep save -r` (or `godep save`) even if you have newer versions of some packages. Only `update` will update a package. You don't have to run `godep restore`.\n. LGTM\n. LGTM\n. Sure, LGTM\n. LGTM\n. If you have `GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1` in your environment, you don't need to use `godep path` at all.\n. > having godep path return the right thing means it's easier\n> to write portable shellscript wrappers in the interim\n\nIt sounds like you're asking for a new feature. The command `godep path` returns a workspace\u2014a directory suitable for including in the `GOPATH` list. The vendor directory is not a workspace and it can't usefully be included in your `GOPATH`. When you're using `GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1`, there is no \"right thing\" for `godep path` to print.\n\nHowever, in that case, it's trivial to construct the correct path yourself, so I don't see how a godep feature would make writing portable shell script wrappers any easier.\n. But I do agree there's a bug in godep here: if `GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1` is in the environment, then `godep path` should print a helpful error message and exit with a nonzero status code.\n. This feature sounds reasonable in principle, just for the sake of convenience. (I would be careful about doing things for the sake of security without thinking more deeply about it from top to bottom. I suspect that godep isn't in a position to provide any meaningful security guarantees without some serious redesign. A feature that is nominally \"for security\" but where the threat model is half-baked or nonexistent will be misleading, and probably worse than just making no promises in the first place.)\n\nI don't have much opinion about the mechanism to achieve it. If this works reliably, cool.\n. :+1: this is a big improvement.\n\nOne could nit-pick the wording or formatting, but this is already much better than what it currently does.\n. It would be better to fix this by calling path.Clean on the command line arg before supplying it to matchPattern. The function matchPattern is a lower-level routine that expects to get a true import path.\n\nIn the go tool, this is the difference between\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/blob/6083bd65f7/src/cmd/go/main.go#L347-L355\n\nand matchPattern:\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/blob/6083bd65f7/src/cmd/go/main.go#L476\n. Using path.Clean would fix not just trailing slashes, but all unclean paths, such as `github.com/golang/protobuf///.//proto`.\n. LGTM\nThat was fast! :)\n. :+1:\n. Is there a way to do this without a flag? Optional behavior makes for [poor UX and harder-to-maintain software](http://ometer.com/free-software-ui.html).\n. I can sympathize with the instinctual desire to maintain backwards compatibility. It's worth asking whether that's necessary. I don't know the answer, but if it's acceptable to change the meaning of godep save, then I think that would be preferable.\n\nI'm only aware of one thing that consumes this field, and it's buildpacks (both heroku and cloudfoundry) that need to install the go compiler. If that's the extent of it, then I think it would be fine to simply make the change unilaterally. There might be additional ways this field is used, but I sort of doubt it.\n\n@freeformz do you have any insight here?\n. Yeah, that was the original intention. But if some other behavior would be more useful, it's not set in stone. :)\n. Try `godep update ...` (three literal dots).\n. This should absolutely be documented better. There could be an example in the help output for `godep help update`.\n. This sounds like a bug.\n. I'm sorry for this. It's a good idea to avoid using symlinks for elements of GOPATH, or inside your workspace.\n\nThe go tool includes code to explicitly prohibit some cases, though it seems there are still others that it doesn't catch. We (godep) should consider taking a similar approach, to find cases that are unlikely to work correctly and produce a helpful error message instead of silently doing something useless.\n. I think this is the right approach in the long run. It had to happen eventually.\n. LGTM\n. Now that @freeformz is making binary releases of godep, it seems like there's less reason to spend effort making godep compile with older Go versions.\n. That looks like a good fix. There are two slight refinements you might want to make:\n1. You don't need `$GOPATH` in there; it's unlikely any executables will be put there.\n2. You don't need to set `GOBIN`, you can just put the bin directory directly in path as `$GOPATH/bin`.\n\nSo, putting those together it would be:\n\n``` shell\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n```\n. > I did a 'go get -u' yesterday\n\nOk, but what version do you have? It would be helpful if you can run `godep version` and paste the output here so we know exactly what you have.\n. It's not, in general, possible to save only some of your dependencies. You have to save all or none. \n. > Both godep and go installed from Homebrew.\n\n(Offtopic) pro tip: don't install Go from homebrew (or any package manager). Download a tarball from https://golang.org/dl/ and unzip it into /usr/local/go.\n. ",

Please not that you probably want to use `godep update github.com/hashicorp/go-getter/...` atm because of a bug in the update code.\n. @dadgar did you run `godep update github.com/hashicorp/go-getter/...` And is `github.com/hashicorp/go-getter` anywhere in your Godeps.json file?\n. @dadgar godep is platform agnostic. the go tool isn't atm, so it will not pull down all possible deps for a package, only the ones the local arch needs to build. Godep will find all deps across all arches as it ignores build tags (except for ignore and appengine) atm.\n. #108 is merged and may fix this.\n. I believe this is now fixed. If not please re-open.\n. For the purposes of cleanup I'm going to close this as it's obvious that we're not going to merge it as is. If someone would like to re-open this issue with an up-to-date PR (perhaps with a different implementation) I'd be happy to review and consider/discuss inclusion.\n\nThanks!\n. @kr How about we remove `restore` at this point?\n. +1 and that is in line with the official Go team stance as well. With that said I'm going to close this issue. \n\nThanks everyone for the discussion.\n. There's no real way to accomplish this AFAIK in go land w/o going down the `gb` path.\n\nA `godep status` or `godep list` command to ensure everything in use is probably the best that can be done for now. I'm going to close this in favor of: #273\n. This is possible by specifying the path to the full vendored package, so something like:\n\n``` console\n$ go install -v github.com/my/project/Godeps/_workspace/src/github.com/your/project/cmd/thing\nor\n$ go install -v github.com/my/project/vendor/github.com/your/project/cmd/thing\n```\n\nworks properly (AFAIKCT) with rewriting or the vendor experiment.\n. Every time I've tracked these things down in the past it was because of the go tool using the wrong cached package file from outside. rewrites and/or vendor directory solve this AFAIK, so those should be used instead. Closing for now. If I'm way off base and/or we can reproduce with go 1.5\\* and current godep please re-open. Thanks!\n. atm as long as the imported package has files with build tags that include it on the local machine (a file with `// +build heroku` and a different file with `// +build !heroku`) both files will be included (assuming they are both committed to vcs). Ultimately we want to vendor everything regardless of tags so that code is buildable in multiple environments. See #271. I'm closing this for now in favor of that issue.\n. For those of you having this problem:\n\n1) is it with golang switch to golang.org/x / github? If so you will likely need to update your deps in a brute source kinda way as per @bhcleek 's suggetions. I recently had to do something similar for https://github.com/sclasen/swfsm/pull/60\n\n2) Can you provide a repeatable test case?\n. Travis shouldn't do that as that's an implementation detail of godep and may break in the future.\n. @pdxjohnny This works fine for me:\n\n``` console\n$ go get -u go get -u github.com/authit/crypto\n$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/authit/crypto\n$ godep restore\n```\n\nI would try nuking `$GOPATH/src/github.com/spf13/cobra` and try `godep restore` again.\n\nBTW: `godep restore` isn't really necessary unless you don't want to wrap your `go` commands with `godep`. I would also encourage the authors of the package to rewrite their deps.\n. @gngeorgiev godep works under the assumption that all packages are in a VCS controlled repository. That repository doesn't actually have to be pushed anywhere else though.\n\nI personally put all code into a VCS (almost always git), even if it's ever just local.\n. godep uses the go tooling for various bits and they mostly require the code to be in VCS, organized in certain ways.\n. @tchap what version of godep do you have? If it's not `v2` or the command isn't recognized, please `go get -u github.com/tools/godep` and try again.\n. @tchap can you paste the full output?\n. This works this way...\n\n``` console\n$ cd <path to blablabla>/workspace/src\n$ GOPATH=\"$(dirname $(dirname $(dirname $(pwd)))):$GOPATH\" godep save\n```\n\nThat above works for me in a trivial test case.\n. @kamal-github Please open a new issue describing the problem and don't comment on an old issue.. Godep no longer works this way and we make the following assumptions:\n1. godep save was used and the `_workspace` was committed to git.\n2. If the dependencies **were** saved with the `-r` flag, the `go` tool itself w/o needing to modify `$GOPATH` or wrapping commands with `godep` can be used to `go install` the project. This is the recommended way to use `godep` and you will have the least amount of problems using it this way.\n3. If the dependencies were **NOT** saved with the `-r` flag, then **one** of two things **must** happen:\n   1. `go` tool commands to build code must be wrapped with `godep`, so `godep go install` and the like. This happens to re-exec the go tool with a modified `$GOPATH`, but this is just an implementation detail, subject to change at whim (although it is unlikely to).\n   2. `godep restore` must be run before using the `go` tool to build code. This modifies the copies of the dependencies in your `$GOPATH` by checking out the `Rev`s for each dependency in the proper `$GOPATH` location. This is sub-optimal.\n\nI hope this help clarify things. I'll try to improve the docs.\n\nPS: rewrites do not work with the Go15 `vendor/` experiment further complicating things, but this is be reflected in the docs already.\n. godep doesn't do anything with submodules AFAIK. Is this reproducible with the current version of godep and can a publicly accessible reproducer be made available?\n. Closing in favor of #271.\n. I am closing this because -copy=false hasn't been supported for a whule (since 754ee6f4e0e5fc8d0ef2692fb239d15c7a09dd84).\n. @duggan Why would you not import it as `<canonical>/<package>/<sub package>` ?\n\nFor instance when I have a \"local\" package of some sort I'll import it like `github.com/freefromz/mypackage/subpackage` instead of `./subpackage`.\n\nOr do you always work outside of  `$GOPATH` (which AFAIK is the only place local imports work properly ... but I could be wrong)?\n\nAlso, AFAIK, relative import paths are discouraged.\n. @steenzout What project?\n. It needs to be in your path, just like go does for this to work.\n. This is maybe something we should report on when working on #273, but generally I agree. Closing.\n. @shutej it's primarily for other systems to know which version of go to select to build the code.\n\nUltimately godep will **not** be involved in building code. My plan is to deprecate `godep go ...` after Go 1.6 and remove it around Go 1.7. Once Go 1.6 is released people should switch to using `vendor/` (this is possible now, but requires an ENV variable), which is supported by the `go` tool directly.\n. @neurogeek you may be interested in this one?\n. @neurogeek What are the use cases for an `omit` flag? My intent is not challenging it, I'm asking to clarify your reasoning.\n. @neurogeek I'd rather not add -omit if we can help it.\n\n@dsymonds Does this mean that users should `import \"google.golang.org/appengine\"` instead of `import \"appengine\"` and apply any updates necessary?\n. @dsymonds @ronoaldo For reference that README is here right? https://github.com/golang/appengine\n. Awesome. I'm going to close this issue out again then as I think it documents what people should do.\n. IMO these things are outside the scope of godep. You can't import a main package anymore starting with Go 1.5. If you vendor the code and have the go tools around you can still install it. So I'm going to close this. Thanks!\n. We have a bunch of other verbose output these days. If your are still interested in discussing something like this please re-open with an updated PR.\n. #108 is merged, so closing.\n. I rebased this on top of master and fixed a problem with the diff command.\n\n@kr @neurogeek I'm tempted to merge this at least because it stops common issues: (a) where people are working in a repo that isn't in version control (yet) and (b) the go code that you want to vendor deps for is a subdirectory of the VCS project.\n\nThis would close #107, #108, #173 (And maybe #43 and #48).\n\nPlease review/comment.\n. AFAIK `godep save -r` works with packages that also use godep as the dependent packages dependencies also get rewritten. godep does not use the deps from the dependency directly though and imports them from your local $GOPATH, which leads to different versions of the deps. So :-(\n\nAlso if your deps are rewriting and you are not it doesn't work. Probably vice versa as well. And I shudder to think about the case where one dep is and another isn't.\n. Closing in favor of #273 \n. @abhat Don't modify the GOPATH like that. Wrap the go commands with godep: e.g. godep go install ...\n. I'm going to close this as we now indicate which repo isn't using a VCS.\n. @abhat I really wish Kubernetes rewrote their deps so the restore and a few of their other dev bits wouldn't be necessary.\n. @themihai `godep version` ?\n. @least-olegs godep requires the commit sha / tag of the version of the code that it is copying. Without that info there is no way for godep to help you manage your dependencies.\n. @themihai `godep version`\n. @least-olegs godep does analyze all of your source code to determine which deps are in use and then copies those deps from $GOPATH into `vendor/` (or, for older versions of Go, `Godeps/_workspace/src`). \n. @themihai that is a super old version, so am not surprised you are having issues.\n. @binary132 I'm not sure how you are using godeps then? It's really meant to be run at the top level of a repo. Maybe I should enforce that? Or will need to make tests to exercise other use cases.\n. That's a very unusual workspace (https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces). If you are going to check a $GOPATH entry in, why not just git subtree your deps into your tree instead?\n. @jnfeinstein Please rebase against master and I'll take a look.\n. Thanks @jnfeinstein. At this point I think we need to have the new exported method documented and a test case.\n. @kr That probably makes the most sense in most circumstances.\n\nalthough I do wonder if there is a case where the developer doesn't support building everything with a dep that uses a different build tag then the one they designed for.\n. That is correct, but since it's vendoring everything regardless of `// +build` it could include something the developer didn't intent to include/support, which could then be triggered with a `-tag` by the builder.\n\nNot sure if it matters though.\n. @jsha would it work for you guys if godep just included all the deps, ignoring `// +build` tags? Thereby punting the tagging off to those building the code later?\n\nIMO this is the best solution.\n. Great I am going to close this then in favor of: #271\n. Closing as it's been there for a while. \n. +1, although I would expand the `go get` statement to include all `go *` tasks (e.g. `go test`).\n. Thanks! Merging.\n. Project maybe no longer uses godep, so closing because I can't repro.\n. `vendor/` provides some of this as you can have multiple vendor folders at different levels. I'm not yet sure we should support that and instead only make a top level `vendor/` folder with everything flattened down into it with a way smarter system for package resolution.\n. Thanks, but I think the way we're going to approach this by vendoring everything regardless of build tags.\n. @kr what do you think about this? I'm tempted to merge this, but I'm not sure you would agree. You've previously stated that a -v option (across all commands I believe) would be nice.\n. @Soulou Are you interested in fixing this up? If not I will likely start on the feedback from @kr.\n. @Soulou Maybe need another tweak of the rewrite output?\n\nSome things I think would make it clearer:\n\n1) rewrite:\\t...\n2) Use relative file paths instead of full paths\n3) maybe don't bother with the new rewritten path? We basically know what it will be and I'm mostly interested in knowing a rewrite happened, not all the details.\n4) There is inconsistent quoting in package names (original is quoted, rewritten isn't).\n. re: #3 that would make -r=false less clear though. Hmm. \n\nAnother option would be to say \"unrewrite\" or \"undo rewrite\" then the relative path and the original package name.\n\nBasically I'm just trying to make that output a little more visually parseable. \n. @Soulou Any thoughts on the most recent feedback?\n. I also added a -v flag, but atm it only outputs skipped files, so please rebase.\n. I'm going to close this out for now. Please feel free to re-open with an updated, rebased PR. Thanks!\n. Thanks, but while this is supported by go it's actively discouraged and we won't support this.\n. @mariokostelac Can you rebase this and I'll check it out?\n. #152 is similar(ish) and merged. If you want to re-open a PR with cleaned up (or additional) output that would be great, but I'm going to close this for now.\n. @kr Yeah. I did. I think I meant to reference both #152 and #243, but got distracted part of the way through. Thanks\n. godep relies on the go tool and by extension things being compatible with a $GOPATH workspace layout.\n. Closing in favor of #86, which I believe is the same thing.\n. I don't understand the use case for selecting dependencies manually. The goal of godeps is to make builds repeatable by vendoring all dependencies. This seems to contradict this goal. \n\nSince this has been here a while I'm going to close this. Feel free to re-open with comments / mergable update if you still want to pursue this.\n\nThanks!\n. This is why I suggest that we change the behavior to just skip parsing of testdata directories and copy them as is.\n. @neurogeek Awesome. Thanks!\n. get is a holdover from when godep didn't save the files. You generally don't need to use it.\n. Closing in favor of #86 as well.\n. Already done in 3d123490b0a248b2dea64deee887504a63295717 so closing. Thanks!\n. @edsrzf Can you please rebase this and I'll take a look more?\n. @edsrzf Thanks I changed a little and merged it. Also added a `-v` flag to go so you can see what's skipped if you want to.\n. Thanks. I rebased and merged this via fc2e546d696e649f7309cce1a644a1057d3710d5\n. Closing in favor of #79 \n. Well this is a godep bug as godep should be smarter. ;-) This is basically a problem where godep uses `go list` and that tool will filter out files that don't match the current OS (like *_linux.go files on OSX) or build tags.\n. @Raffo What version of godep are you using (godep version)? This is actually fixed in current versions as godep is no longer using `go list`. PS: This may be why a new save is fixed things for you.\n\nClosing because the reported problem is fixed. \n. @tsuna look at `list.go`, the main driver being listPackage().\n. I think I've effectively closed this with ba35b97d0db08d8d57599079d99b65add0282b4e.\n\nPlease let me know (new PR / Issue) if we should do anything more.\n\nThanks!\n. This should now be fixed by #231.\n. What version of godep are you using? At this point godep no longer uses `go list` to resolve any dependencies and processes files/deps for all files except those that include the `appengine` or `ignore` build tags.\n. Great! Thanks. Closing. For anyone else on this ticket please re-open / post a follow up if, after updating, things aren't working for you.\n. @jzelinskie If so please file that as a separate issue unless someone else has already done so. ;-) \n. @brandur what project / revision was this on ?\n. @brandur Ahh yes, that makes sense. I'm going to close this as a dupe of #138 then.\n. `godep save -r ./...`, then you don't need `godep exec`\n. I don't think we're going to be adding an `exec` command in light of using rewriting now and the upcoming `-vendor` option to the go tooling. With either of those you should just be able to use the go toolchain normally and use godep \"just\" for managing dependencies.\n\nI'm not sure if @kr agrees with me or not however.\n. @tarrant Thanks for the PR, but I'm going to close this out, please consider using rewriting for now until go1.5's `-vendor` option becomes available.\n. @conslo Read down to the bottom: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/golang-dev/74zjMON9glU/4lWCRDCRZg0J\n. @mpuncel How would `godep restore` work if different packages in the same repo are recorded at different versions? Which is the right version of the repository to restore to? That goes away when we can get rid of `godep restore`, which won't be until after Go 1.6 though.\n. @mpuncel agreed.\n. What is the use case here? Why would I want to vendor a \"package\" that I don't use in code?\n. I'm going to close this as I can't reproduce it. If this is still an issue please re-open with steps to reproduce.\n. Thank, but ...\n\nI don't think godep should be messing around with GIT_\\* environment variables. For instance this would mess with my own setup in a negative way as I rely on GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL & GIT_AUTHOR_NAME at times. If you are using godep inside of a git hook you should unset GIT_DIR/GIT_INDEX_FILE before calling godep.\n\nFWIW: I'd be happy to re-visit this if a different solution is presented. \n. @ErikDubbelboer Those env vars are not being used inside of godep, but I am using them in my environment. Thanks for contributing.\n. Why not just rewrite the vendored deps and then there is no need for godep, except when managing deps?\n. After Go 1.6 godep path and rewritting is going to go away and we won't be adding a godep exec.\n\nGodep can't vendor gox, you should install it and use it as necessary.\n. We're supporting the go 1.5 vendor experiment, so I'm closing this.\n\nThanks!\n. #108 is merged, so closing.\n. Closing. See #161 \n. Thanks, but In #103 it was decided that people should upgrade their apps to the current appending libraries which aren't so strange AFAICT.\n. You could do this with the linker now, it would just be a bunch of convoluted uses of -X.\n\nA convention like this is better off made as a https://github.com/golang/proposal though.\n. Please PR if you are still interested in this. I think it's becoming increasingly important.\n. This should now be fixed by #231.\n. How about `fmt.Errorf(\"error inspecting %q: %v\", dir, err)` ?\n. This shouldn't happen now so closing. If it's still happening please re-open.\n. This was fixed in https://github.com/tools/godep/commit/6a67fc143981c5d893576c3fbeb964a3745d7b12\n\nThanks for taking the time to submit this.\n. We're supporting the go 1.5 vendor experiment so I'm closing this. Thanks!\n. I think I am running into this issue in an internal repo...\n\n```\nbroker/io.go:8:2: code in directory /Users/emuller/go/src/github.com/heroku/busl/Godeps/_workspace/src/github.com/garyburd/redigo/redis expects import \"github.com/garyburd/redigo/redis\"\n```\n\nWhen I look into the files there I see things like this...\n\nhttps://github.com/garyburd/redigo/blob/master/redis/conn_test.go#L27, which aren't rewritten, althought L28 is.\n. Hmm. Maybe this wasn't related to this problem as I've managed to resolve it with some updates.\n. @charleswli update requires you to specify a specific package. AFAIK `./...` doesn't work with update.\n. The reported issue works for me. I made a test lib with a single function and used gomega to test it and ran `godeps save` and here's what it generated...\n\n``` console\n$ cat Godeps/Godeps.json\n{\n    \"ImportPath\": \"github.com/freeformz/t185\",\n    \"GoVersion\": \"go1.5\",\n    \"Packages\": [\n        \"./...\"\n    ],\n    \"Deps\": [\n        {\n            \"ImportPath\": \"github.com/onsi/ginkgo\",\n            \"Comment\": \"v1.2.0-6-gd981d36\",\n            \"Rev\": \"d981d36e9884231afa909627b9c275e4ba678f90\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"ImportPath\": \"github.com/onsi/gomega\",\n            \"Comment\": \"v1.0-28-g8adf9e1\",\n            \"Rev\": \"8adf9e1730c55cdc590de7d49766cb2acc88d8f2\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n@jayunit100 What issue are you running into? \n. Great. Closing this issue as it appears to be solved.\n. This should now be fixed in v37. Please re-open if not. Thanks!\n. @neurogeek I would rather say that testdata files should just be copied over as is w/o attempting to parse. This is especially true as we move to the use of `vendor/` and some of the discussions I've seen crop up around testing vendored code.\n. The stance of the go team/tooling is \"don't use symlinks\". Godep ends up utilizing that go tools / libs underneath and I'm of the opinion that supporting this will cause more issues than it solves.\n\nSo thank you for spending time on this issue, but I'm not going to accept this patch atm.\n. Does `godep save -r=false` not accomplish this?\n. @gfrey I'm not sure what you mean by \"given package\".\n. So you don't really want to unrewrite the import you want to remove it? If you remove all of the import statements imports a dependency and re-run `godep save -r` any no longer used imports will be removed from the workspace. The arguments to `godep save` aren't the packages that you want to vendor, they are the package spec(s) that you want to analyze for vendoring.\n. @gfrey that would confuse the meaning of the package spec passed to `godep save`, which is the packages you want to analyze dependencies for, usually '.' (the default), './...', or './cmd/...'. To be honest rewrites are going away as we approach Go 1.6 and the use of the `vendor/` directory, so I'm tempted to close as won't fix with the expectation being that you would use the vendor directory directly w/o rewrites anyway. At that time a `godep rm` command (which doesn't exist) would solve your problem (or just rm stuff manually from `vendor/`). ATM `godep save -r=false <your local package spec>` will un-rewrite everything so you can still do what you want, it will just take a few extra commands before or after. \n\nDoes that make sense?\n. `hg` is one of the supported vcs systems. I don't use mercurial much so if there is a specific problem please re-open describing that. Thanks!\n. It looks like \"/home/geovani/Code/foo\" is outside of your GOPATH. godep really only works with packages inside of a GOPATH.\n. I don't think godep will (or should) support this.\n\nYou could rsync the package from one machine to another.\nOr use github (or other git hosting service).\n. Upgrade your go version as per @akavel.\nIf this still persists and you are also on the most recent version of godep (go get -u github.com/tools/godep) please re-open this issue.\n. I use gox to cross compile several projects that are under godep. \n\nThese tools run the `go` command you need to rewrite your dependencies (`godep save -r ./...`), then you  will no longer need to do `godep go ....` and will only need to use godep when adding new files to your application or managing dependencies.\n. @neurogeek +1 on your suggestions.\n\nAlthough I am personally wary of adding this. If you don't rewrite the files, you'll end up picking up the same dep from elsewhere. AFAIK if you could get 2 copies of the dependencies initialized. I think this will add confusion overall.\n. @activars \n\nCan't you use a directory structure like so:\n\n```\n./cmd/cmd-b-name/main.go\n./cmd/cmd-b-name/main.go\n./common_package.go\n```\n\nThe above is installable with `go install ./...` or via `go get github.com/activars/mypackage/...` (at least with rewrites).\n\nIf you can't can you please expand on your explanation as to why, perhaps with an example?\n. Also, the stance of the go team/tooling is \"don't use symlinks\". Godep ends up utilizing that go tools / libs underneath and I'm of the opinion that supporting this will cause more issues than it solves. This is one example of them.\n\nSo thank you for spending time on this issue, but I'm not going to accept this patch atm.\n. I suspect this was a bug that was fixed a few months ago as I can't duplicate and I remember we had a bug that sounded like this.\n\nAlso, as @kr points out rewrites aren't necessary with Go 1.5 + the vendor/ experiment. So closing. \n\nPlease re-open if this is still an issue.\n. ATM you need to manually prune out the olds locations and then godep save the new deps. You may be able to get away with doing a godep restore, blowing away $project/Godeps, updating the deps in your code and doing a new godep save. Or at least that's what I would try first.\n. godep does not upload or download source files, it manages package locally vendored copies from those installed into your $GOPATH.\n\nTry ..\n\n``` term\n$ go get -u gopkg.in/alecthomas/kingpin.v2\n$ cd $GOPATH/src/<your package>\n# ensure that you are importing \"gopkg.in/alecthomas/kingpin.v2\" in one of your files\n$ godep save -r ./...\n```\n. I cannot duplicate this with go from source as of today + current version of godep from source. Please re-open with a reproducible test case if this is still an issue.\n\nThanks!\n. If you are \"forking\" a repo for temporary fixes / updates and plan on merging things up stream I suggest just adding the fork as a remote to the original package.\n\nIf you are not then you want to change all/any of the package paths anyway as you're effectively working on a different package.\n. @gelraen Why does it require a makefile?\n1. I am using package X (which is also a github repo) in my project Y. The package I am using is vendored in the Godep workspace (or vendor/) of my project.\n2. I find a bug in package X, so I fork it on github.\n3. I cd $GOPATH/src/<PKG X> and `git remote add freeformz https://github.com/freeformz/X.git\n4. I create a branch, fix the bug, commit, `git push freeformz bug_fix_branch`.\n5. I go to gituhb and open a PR against X with my fixes.\n6. I go to project Y on the filesystem ($GOPATH/src/github.com/freeformz/Y) and `godep update X`, which vendors what I currently have for X in my $GOPATH. I commit those vendored changes and push them to my public (or private) repo.\n7. Other's pull my code, with the vendored bits and use the vendored versions because they are in my repo and I'm using either a) rewriting; b) the GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT or; c) `godep go install ./...` (my recommended order btw).\n\nNow eventually the upstream either merges my changes or I do in fact need to fork the project and maintain something else.\n\nIf they merge my changes I can checkout master on project X in my $GOPATH and `godep update X` in project Y, commit and push.\n. FWIW: This works fine for me unless the checked out version of `gopkg.in\\flosch\\pongo2.v3` had uncommitted changes in it, hence the \"dirty working tree\" error. \n. If anything the `_workspace` folder and restore are going away with the advent of the `vendor/` directory. You can't make reproducible builds if the code is not vendored, and that is the point of godep, so unfortunately -1.\n\nAFAIK: `godep restore` is there as a relic of the past. If I can make it go away (and I haven't spent the requisite time yet) it will.\n. If you update the paths in your code / Godeps.json file it should just work if the commits are the same. If not I would suggest the following:\n1. Checkout the new package (go get it).\n2. Update your code to use the new package.\n3. Remove the old package from Godeps/Godeps.json\n4. run `godep save`.\n. _Maybe_ (and I'm not convinced this is the right thing to do) we could check to see if we have the commit in the repo first and only try to fetch if we don't have the repo and/or commit?\n\nOtherwise I'm not sure there is anything sensible to do here except bail out so the error can be corrected.\n. If we did this and the developer doing `godep restore` didn't have the repo locally in their $GOPATH we'd still have to fetch it anyway and bail out.\n\nWith that said fetching things we don't have is probably a fairly sane thing to do **but** could greatly complicate things.\n\nHonestly I think failing fast is still probably the best thing here.\n\nWhat do others think?\n. @lavalamp Doh!. Well my assertions still apply AFAICT.\n\n@tsuna What would be reasonable for godep to do?\n. I don't understand this use case though. \n\nGodep's goal is to vendor code for reproducible builds.\n. WRT Go: If you push me your repo or I check it out on a random machine, I need all the code in that repo to build the code. W/o all the necessary code I can't build the app.\n. @kr Thanks I was just about to attempt to write more or less the same thing. Thanks for being so eloquent as always.\n. @tsuna I'll have to think about it more. \n. As of 9570f62c8b83f643855711292495c37ebd2ceffc, godep uses the vcs list command, so that should close this. If I'm not understanding things right please re-open.\n. See comments on https://github.com/tools/godep/pull/214 for a workaround.\n. A workaround for this would be to checkout the github golang tools git repo to `$GOPATH/src/golang/x/tools`. After that you can use `import \"golang.org/x/tools...\"` and  `godep save -r ./...` as needed.\n. @kr Yes, perhaps we should.\n. I don't know if this is a good idea. What's the use case?\n. Wouldn't you want Godep to vendor the directory though?\n. @dprotaso any updates?\n. I'm going to close this out for now since there haven't been updates in a while. Please feel free to re-open / start new PR if you still think this feature is valuable.\n. confirmed.\n. Looking at rewrite.go (for the first time, so _grain_ _salt_) this may actually be a bug in either go/parser or go/printer (or maybe go/ast).\n. FWIW: When the comment is removed things work correctly.\n. Comment text is preserved when the file is parsed. `Comment.Text()` for that Import returns the text found in the file.\n. Closing this as we merged the PR to fix it.\n. Thanks!\n\nMerged in 8063f550a728b76d3a1a828e45d482f7dbde61e7\n. @jeeyoungk what happens to the extra intermediate file?\n. @jeeyoungk you can just pass in the buffer itself as it also takes an io.Reader, which bytes.Buffer is.\n. LGTM. I tested this on a few random projects and it also fixes the bug originally reported.\n. Closing as @jeeyoungk updated his PR with basically the same thing.\n. I would also add a `-r` to that as well so that the dependencies get rewritten. This will allow you to not have to use godep unless you are modifying dependencies (i.e. you can just use `go test` and the like naked and the app is then `go get` 'able). Assuming it's an app and not a library.\n. @kr what are your thoughts on storing the -r flag (or detecting it) and picking up the package spec from an existing Godeps.json file if none is provided? \n. SGTM. I'm going to close this then as it's unlikely something that we'll do.\n. You likely need to re-vendor under the new paths?\n. You can't import another package's main package.\n. hunh. My bad. I thought you couldn't and never checked that assumption out.\n. @thockin Can you re-produce on a public repo that I can test with / base a test on?\n. I assume this happened on a `godep restore`?\n\nTBH: I'm more interested in how you got into that situation in the first case, which is what I'd like a reproducer for.\n. @thockin @kr agreed. \n. For each of the deps that aren't found, run `go get -u <dep>` to make sure you have them installed locally and then you will be able to run `godep save`.\n\nTBH though I'm not 100% sure that the side effects of using etcd like this.\n. @kr Should we instead resolve these dependencies to the versions vendored in the sub project?\n\nFor instance `github.com/coreos/etcd/raft` imports `github.com/coreos/etcd/Godeps/_workspace/src/golang.org/x/net/context`. ATM you have to have `golang.org/x/net/context` in your $GOPATH to be able to run `godep save`.\n. It worked for me: https://github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient/pull/341\n. @apriendeau Do you have an example repo and steps to reproduce?\n. @apriendeau Sorry, I am lost. I am not sure what your starting point is above. \n\nCan you provide a step by step repro from a clean $GOPATH?\n. @timothysc Can you provide more information about what problem you are experiencing and/or put together a publicly accessible reproduction?\n. ATM, if you are vendoring etcd and it uses Godep to vendor net/context and you want to use the version of net/context that etcd vendors then you need to import it as:\n`your.package/Godeps/_workspace/src/github.com/coreos/etcd/Godeps/_workspace/src/golang.org/x/net/context`\n\nGiven the go vendor experiment becoming the standard in 1.6 I'm not sure it's worth putting much effort behind `godep save` being able to handle this case.\n\nThoughts?\n. FWIW: This is also an issue with any nested vendor directory setup. I opened (or commented anyway) on a similar issue against Go itself. The only real way to handle this is to flatten the deps so there is only one  `google.golang.org/grpc` package in use. I'd like to teach godep to do this (it already does it for the older workspace format). It needs to be taught how to check _both_ and DTRT. Hopefully later this month unless someone else shows up with PRs.\n. @thockin While it may be nice, I wonder if the possible vectors for confusion would be worth it.\n. See #240. I'm going to close this and urge anyone with input to discuss there. Thanks!\n. I don't think that's something Godep should really be involved in. \n\nIf you feel different I suggest opening an issue on https://github.com/kardianos/vendor-spec, which will likely be supported in the future.\n\nThank You!\n. Godep is truncating data, probably because the line being truncated is longer than 64k. If I'm right I may have a fix soon.\n. This should now be fixed by #231, so please `go get -u github.com/tools/godep` and re-open if this is still a problem (PS: You may need to cleanup your broken workspace first).\n. I do not have that problem at `v0.9.0-100-g38b4f07` of influxdb/client. Try an updated version?\n. You need to run go generate inside the workspace. \n\nTry this...\n\n``` bash\ncd <your repo>\nOGOPATH=$GOPATH\nGOPATH=$(godep path)\ncd Godeps/_workspace/src/github.com/btcsuite/btcd/btcec\ngo generate \nGOPATH=$OGOPATH\ncd <root of your repo>\ngodep go install ./...\n```\n\nYou will have to check the generate code in though, which you may not want to do.\n\nYour other option would be to wrap the build in a Makefile. This is because `go generate` is meant to be run before building **by design**.\n. @kr Gah, you are correct. I fixed it in #231. btcd already ran and saved the go generated bits, which were truncated silently by that bug, but would have been fixed by my example above (AFAICT).\n. @kr Done. If it LGTY, then I'll merge it.\n. Do you have syntastic enabled?\n. FWIW: I removed syntastic from my vim setup and similar issues are now resolved for me.\n. @fatih thanks btw.\n. @kr @neurogeek I've already run into this once with a user having previously installed godep via amd64 on darwin and then updating to a newer go version, but using the 386 package instead and then having issues pushing code.  So unless you have any objections wrt the implementation I'm going to merge this at some point.\n. godep restore modifies stuff in your $GOPATH by cloning repos and attempting to checkout the specified revisions. It's _all_ about messing with your $GOPATH. I generally recommend using rewrites limiting the need for restore to primary developers. With the vendor experiment this becomes even less necessary.\n. LGTM modulo questions.\n. @kr I'm going to merge this so things stop failing as Travis seems to default to ruby.\n. @kr Also my bad. Was kind of trigger happy.\n. @kr yes. Playing with it I just blew away log-shuttle's Godeps directory and didn't migrate anything.\n\nThe other thing that came up is what to do with vendored deps inside of vendored deps. There are several (many?) libraries that can't safely be vendored inside of vendored deps (lib/pq is one example). \n\nShould they be extracted to a top level? What if your package and a package you vendor both require the same lib. What if they are different versions? Just error out? \n\nHow does all of that affect things like  the cmd/CmdName structure where the root of your package is a library (which should or should not vendor stuff), but the library had deps and the cmd uses the library?\n\nAlso not sure how much of this tools like godep/vendor/nut/etc should care about.\n. @azylman While it allows it will cause problems. For instance if multiple things import multiple lib/pq's database/sql will panic because of multiple registrations in the same namespace (making few assumptions here). That is one example of course, but many things assume they'll be initialized once. That is at least one reason, there are probably more.\n. Closing this in favor of #244 / fe7138c\n. LGTM. Sorry about merging that too fast. I really wanted travis to stop erroring (and emailing me). Merge away.\n. I don't like the output of restore in verbose mode, but it's what get's output by go's tools/vcs stuff. We could clean that up later as I think this is helpful as is, modulo a few changes (which I'm just doing).\n. Thanks! merged\n. @kr Updated with suggestions.\n\nRe: What more. TBH I think this is enough for now. It's usable for me w/o changes to my workflow (modulo https://github.com/golang/go/issues/11659 anyway).\n. @kr just to be clear I don't think that golang issue should block. Just pointing it out.\n. @kr I also added docs and fixed an issue, so if you could take another look ++.\n. @kr I think I'd rather leave the file where it is. For now at least.\n. @kr Yeah, sorry I got distracted after the merge with other work.\n. @pierrre Not 100%, but essentially yes.\n. Hmm. Godep uses go's own libraries/tools to handle package/file selection, which basically ignores everything that isn't a *.go file. This is unlikely to be a \"trivial\" fix. :-( \n. I am okay with it. Basic implementation would be to do a case insensitive check for common License files (LICENSE, LICENSE.TXT, LICENSE.MD, ??) in the root of a repo and include the file if it exists. @ahmetalpbalkan Feel free to work on it and submit a PR when you are ready.\n. @ahmetalpbalkan Recent changes I made to the vcs file listing commands should play well with this. vcs also now has a way to determine the repo root (since it's given the package path).\n. @client9 A PR for the functionality described in this issue would be great!\n. @client9 Go for it. My focus for the next week or so is elsewhere (other projects) unfortunately. I'm just trying to keep anything godep related (Issues/PRs) moving along until I can get back to working directly on things.\n. Godep isn't really designed for this scenario.\n\nPersonally, I would do the above differently, like so:\n\n``` term\n$ export GOPATH=~/go\n$ mkdir -p ~/go/src/github.com/freeformz/project-dir\n$ cd ~/go/src/github.com/freeformz/project-dir\n$ mkdir pkg1\n$ mkdir pkg2\n$ .... code .....\n$ godep save -r ./...\n$ go test -v -race ./...\n...\n```\n\nThe above would make `pkg1` and `pkg2` available to any other project in my `$GOPATH` as `import github.com/freeformz/project-dir/pkg1` and `import github.com/freeformz/project-dir/pkg2`, although I would then vendor + rewrite them for use in other projects.\n\nIf you want to work on \"projects\" in the way you describe then I suggest checking out https://github.com/constabulary/gb\n. Do you have a simple case / repo that we can use to reproduce?\n. @brandur Thanks! Merged.\n. @neurogeek I am not sure, we discussed that @ Gophercon but there wasn't any resolution. Another idea was to use tags and travis to do binary releases to github, but people are still likely to go get godep and we still won't know what version is in use.\n\nMaybe a merge checklist? Even then you can forget to do it.\n. @neurogeek I'm going to merge this in for now. If we forget to increment the number then at least we know what could possibly be included (last version change and later), where now we don't know.\n. It's updatable like any other go gettable application: go get -u github.com/tools/godep\n. @jacobsa Sorry about that.\n. And I have confirmed the bug with a test app.\n. @jacobsa If you update godep (go get -u github.com/tools/godep) you should be good to go.\n. How do I reproduce this?\n. @sundarv85 rewrite your import paths (the -r option) is the way to work around having to use `godep restore` for the common cases (you will still need to do this before a `godep update` though).\n. Works fine for me.\n. Is your godep current (go get -u github.com/tools/godep)?\n. Okay. I was able to duplicate the issue, but I think it's a problem with the github.com/cloudfoundry/sonde-go/events, which won't compile on master (the same commit that is vendored) with the same errors.\n. /cc https://github.com/cloudfoundry/sonde-go\n. Ahh so the problem appears to be with the vendored version of gogo protobufs.\n\nThis commit updates deps a bit...\nhttps://github.com/shinji62/firehose-to-syslog/compare/feature/update-sonde-go...freeformz:feature/update-sonde-go\n\nAnd the resulting errors are with the code in the repo.\n. @shinji62 I would try to pull in the linked patch, which updates gogo protobufs, then fix the issues in the code locally.\n. @shinji62 no worries.\n. @JanSichula I'm going to have to setup a windows environment to test.\n. @JanSichula Which version of windows is this?\n. @JanSichula I was able to repo and make a small fix. Was exactly what I thought it was. Thanks!\n. @JanSichula Great. Let me know if you run into other troubles.\n. @kr @neurogeek For your review.\n. @neurogeek Thanks!\n. @kr Crap. Sorry I clicked the merge button. Habits. :-( \n. @windweller I can't reproduce this error. To test I put together 2 sample projects in my $GOPATH like so..\n\n``` term\n$ echo $GOPATH\n/Users/emuller/go\n\n$ cd $GOPATH/src\n/Users/emuller/go/src\n\n$ cat projA/comm/a.go\npackage comm\n\nconst Variable = \"Hello From projA/comm\"\n\n$ cat projB/b.go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"projA/comm\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    fmt.Println(comm.Variable)\n}\n\n$ cd projB\n$ find .\n.\n./b.go\n./Godeps\n./Godeps/_workspace\n./Godeps/_workspace/.gitignore\n./Godeps/_workspace/src\n./Godeps/_workspace/src/projA\n./Godeps/_workspace/src/projA/comm\n./Godeps/_workspace/src/projA/comm/a.go\n./Godeps/Godeps.json\n./Godeps/Readme\n\n$ godep go run b.go\nHello From projA/comm\n```\n\n`projA` was saved inside of projB with `godep save ./...` after `b.go` was written.\n\nCan you provide steps to reproduce?\n. Oh wait this was about `godep restore`. I get that same error. But you only ever need to do a restore if you want to reset the copies of a dependency in your GOPATH  to the vendored versions. This is still a bug though as projA/comm is valid AFAIK.\n. So while it's technically possible to do so in Go, atm godep (because of it's use of the go toolings vcs library) only fully supports packages in `host/user/pkg` format. But ...\n\nYou do not need to run `godep restore` if you wrap your `go` commands with `godep`. So `godep go install ./...`. Furthermore if you rewrite your deps (`godep save -r ./...`) you don't need to use godep on the server at all.\n. The way I would do this is ...\n\nWhen writing code use `godep save -r ./...`.\n\nWhen installing code run `go install -v ./...`.\n. @cdeadlock I don't understand the linked repo and what it's trying to do show.\n. BTW: I get this error with the \"graceful\" version even without involving godeps at all:\n\n```\n[martini] PANIC: Value not found for type martini.Context\n/usr/local/go/src/runtime/panic.go:387 (0x145c8)\n    gopanic: reflectcall(unsafe.Pointer(d.fn), deferArgs(d), uint32(d.siz), uint32(d.siz))\n/Users/emuller/go/src/github.com/go-martini/martini/martini.go:175 (0xaa8a6)\n    (*context).run: panic(err)\n/Users/emuller/go/src/github.com/go-martini/martini/martini.go:164 (0xaa773)\n    (*context).Next: c.run()\n/Users/emuller/go/src/github.com/go-martini/martini/recovery.go:140 (0xafb99)\n    func.004: c.Next()\n/usr/local/go/src/runtime/asm_amd64.s:402 (0x3cb05)\n    call32: CALLFN(\u00b7call32, 32)\n/usr/local/go/src/reflect/value.go:419 (0xd78d5)\n    Value.call: call(fn, args, uint32(frametype.size), uint32(retOffset))\n/usr/local/go/src/reflect/value.go:296 (0xd66cc)\n    Value.Call: return v.call(\"Call\", in)\n/Users/emuller/go/src/github.com/codegangsta/inject/inject.go:102 (0x187b97)\n    (*injector).Invoke: return reflect.ValueOf(f).Call(in), nil\n/Users/emuller/go/src/github.com/go-martini/martini/martini.go:173 (0xaa861)\n    (*context).run: _, err := c.Invoke(c.handler())\n/Users/emuller/go/src/github.com/go-martini/martini/martini.go:164 (0xaa773)\n    (*context).Next: c.run()\n/Users/emuller/go/src/github.com/go-martini/martini/logger.go:25 (0xaf29f)\n    func.001: c.Next()\n/usr/local/go/src/runtime/asm_amd64.s:403 (0x3cb75)\n    call64: CALLFN(\u00b7call64, 64)\n/usr/local/go/src/reflect/value.go:419 (0xd78d5)\n    Value.call: call(fn, args, uint32(frametype.size), uint32(retOffset))\n/usr/local/go/src/reflect/value.go:296 (0xd66cc)\n    Value.Call: return v.call(\"Call\", in)\n/Users/emuller/go/src/github.com/codegangsta/inject/inject.go:102 (0x187b97)\n    (*injector).Invoke: return reflect.ValueOf(f).Call(in), nil\n/Users/emuller/go/src/github.com/go-martini/martini/martini.go:173 (0xaa861)\n    (*context).run: _, err := c.Invoke(c.handler())\n/Users/emuller/go/src/github.com/go-martini/martini/martini.go:69 (0xa95e4)\n    (*Martini).ServeHTTP: m.createContext(res, req).run()\n/usr/local/go/src/net/http/server.go:1703 (0x6e51a)\n    serverHandler.ServeHTTP: handler.ServeHTTP(rw, req)\n/usr/local/go/src/net/http/server.go:1204 (0x6bfe7)\n    (*conn).serve: serverHandler{c.server}.ServeHTTP(w, w.req)\n/usr/local/go/src/runtime/asm_amd64.s:2232 (0x3ebc1)\n    goexit:\n[martini] Completed 500 Internal Server Error in 8.869917ms\n```\n. @cdeadlock The code here works (either version): https://github.com/freeformz/grb\n\nI updated martini after posting and before saving the deps.\n. @cdeadlock the repo I linked to is my recommended project layout as inspired by https://medium.com/@benbjohnson/structuring-applications-in-go-3b04be4ff091\n. This is why I highly suggest using `godep save -r ./...` as name spacing compiled stuff can become an issue.\n\nIf things get to messed up you can nuke your packages directory (`$GOPATH/pkg`) and it's sub-dirs and `go install -v ./...` will show you what it's re-compiling.\n. Sorry about that. I'm not really sure how this ever worked. Why not clean this up and use godep to vendor everything?\n\nAlso can you provide a publicly accessible repository that duplicates the issue?\n\nPS: What is your $GOPATH set to?\n. So it looks like a mix of git and hg then. FWIW I would use godep to vendor those deps and remove them  from the other locations.\n. Thanks. One more small change and we're good. Thanks!\n. AFAICT this doesn't skip at the right place as per your description. It skips errors in parsing the GoDeps file, not on restore.\n. There are other errors that can occur. Please generalize the message and report the error.\n. Also needs a rebase.\n. I am going to close this since there haven't been any updates in ~ 2 weeks or so. Please feel free to re-open with an updated branch if this feature is still important to you. Thanks!\n. Orly? I use `goimports` with `godep save -r` all the time.\n. Interesting to note. I've seen this, but I end up doing a save -r ./... to rewrite files whenever I add a new one so it hasn't bothered me. It probably should though. TBH this won't be needed at some point with `vendor/` being a thing (which is incompatible with rewrites).\n. that would be awesome.\n. Yeah. it's sub optimal (save vs. save -r). We could record what was used in Godeps.json, but that will also cause it's own set of problems at times. Plus rewriting should be going away pending the outcome of the 1.5 vendor experiment, so I really haven't had enough incentive to do anything.\n. See my comments. Eyeballing the testdata looks good.\n. @neurogeek I rebased and merged this as aeda8bab6aa7e64e94a83b40e29858daeb85ee87\n. FWIW: I am slowly working through the godep code to understand it's idiosyncrasies better than I do now and with an eye towards this. No promises and if anyone surprised me with a patch that would close this issue I wouldn't complain. ;-) \n. @mattfarina What needs did you feel were not met?\n. @captncraig Yep. I've spent a lot of time going down that same path and before I went on vacation (which I'm back from) I started writing my own version of go/build.Context because of this. It's no where near ready though. ;-) \n. FWIW: I'm acutely aware of this issue every day.\n. What version of godep are you using? What is the output of `godep version`?\nCan you link to your repo or is it private?\nCan you provide a publicly accessible reproduction (a public repo with a project the shows this issue)?\n. @neurogeek Doh. I blame being up early for the first day of school for not realizing that. ;-)\n. #276 should fix this once I get it reviewed by other maintainers and merged.\n. @neurogeek @kr this is on top of #275.\n. @eparis Doh! I fixed this in v10. Sorry about that.\n. @ahmetalpbalkan I can't duplicate this. I added an import for check.v1 to a main.go file and then used the C struct from there and godep save worked and did the right thing (added the dep to Godeps/Godeps.json and vendored the files in vendor/)\n\nAre you using check in a test file? I tried that as well (making a main_test) and `godep save` DTRT as well.\n\nWhat Go version are you using?\nWhat Godep version are you using?\nWhat is your $GOPATH?\n. Ahh. I was able to repro! Had an idea after posting that.\n\nI had to delete (remove from my $GOPATH) `gopkg.in/yaml.v2`. A `godep restore` solved that.\n\nMaybe you temporarily had a different $GOPATH set? One without `gopkg.in/yaml.v2` in it?\n. well I can duplicate by removing `gopkg.in/yaml.v2` from $GOPATH. I think this is a bug in `vendor/`support because the go tool should be able to find the package in the vendor directory. We're just doing `go list -e -json`.\n. ahh I forgot that the go tooling internally add `vendor` to all things in `vendor`. So it can't find it becuse go list returns `\"github.com/freeformz/t/vendor/gopkg.in/yaml.v2\"` in my case.\n. So currently godep strips out the vendor part of the path and then passes a constructed list of all flattened paths to `go list -e -json`, which then can't find `gopkg.in/yaml.v2` because in the context of `go list` in my test app it's really `github.com/freeformz/t/vendor/gopkg.in/yaml.v2`. This isn't trivial to fix AFAICT, especially when dealing with `vendor/` behavior vs. `Godeps/_workspace`. But probably worth the investment in time.\n. PS: For now the best way to handle new `godep save` is to do a `godep restore` before hand, ensuring that your GOPATH contains all of the required dependencies at the right versions before doing the new save.\n. on second thought `godep save` (which is perhaps now not aptly named) already removes dependencies when they are no longer used by your code base. The main idea behind this is you shouldn't be thinking about adding/removing dependencies by hand, just re-run save and let it DTRT.\n. What revision of `github.com/influxdb/influxdb` is vendored? What is the \"Rev\" key for it from your Godeps/Godeps.json file?\n. Also, what version of godep are you using?\n. while testing this I get the same thing with a simple go get -u of github.com/influxdb/influxdb (before \n\n``` console\n$ go get -u github.com/influxdb/influxdb\npackage golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt: cannot find package \"golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt\" in any of:\n    /usr/local/go/src/golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt (from $GOROOT)\n    /Users/emuller/go/src/golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt (from $GOPATH)\n```\n\nI ended up having to remove $GOPATH/src/golang.org/x/crypto from my $GOPATH. I suspect that the golang.org/x/crypto package is somehow incomplete and suggest removing it and then either re-fetching or using `godep restore`.\n. What version of go are you using?\n. What happens if you run `golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt` ? What is the output of that?\n. go get ....\n\n> On Sep 24, 2015, at 17:56, Li Yichao notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> You mean godep go get golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt or go get golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n.

Thanks!\n. Sure, care to update this and add a 'v' in front of the version? If you can back track this a little as well that would be good, but not 100% necessary.\n. @buddhamagnet looks great! I squashed them all down to a single commit and merged them. Thanks!\n. Merged! thanks!\n. I think Command belongs in main as it's mostly involved with the setup and execution of the various commands anyway. Good place to keep all the code, at least for now.\n. Thanks!\n. @ncdc sorry for the delay, I was on vacation for a little over a week.\n\nAFAICT there would also be an issue with resolving dependencies as well and recording the correct one.\nThis would be required anyway though.\n\nSo LGTM, merged!\n. I pushed a tag and I'll endeavor to do that in the future as well.\n. @kr @neurogeek thoughts?\n. @kr Re: Security. My goal is to just automate the creation of releases when tags are pushed. I don't intend to tackle the other parts of #110 really for all of the reasons you mention. IMO for \"normal\" use cases trusting Travis + GitHub and their certs is probably fine for the 90% of people wanting to curl down a release. I understand that isn't \"secure\" though in any way.\n. +1, merging because this isn't meant to address the security part.\n. :+1: \n\n@tsuna how about telling the user \"how\" to update first?\n. May also want to indicate the relationship between the two packages. \"packages belong to same repo\" or some such?\n. This should also fix #86 \n. @tsuna thanks. merged.\n. What happens if you `go get` each of your dependencies? Which one(s) print the same error?\n. I was able to reproduce with a simple test project. :-( Looking.\n.

Basically hg had a bug in it when there were sub packages in play. This is now resolved.\n\n@awsmsrc You should switch to the package @client9 mentions though regardless. \n. `go get -u github.com/tools/godep` will upgrade your local install of godep.\n\nYou can now also download binaries as well from https://github.com/tools/godep/releases, but `go get -u` is easier if you already have a working Go setup.\n. There are no files in contrib, they are in sub packages so you need to do `godep get github.com/gin-gonic/contrib/<sub package you want>`\n. The output of godep restore -v is sub optimal atm, but you don't need -v to see the error messages, normal `godep restore` will output any errors (as will -v, you'll just have a bunch of extra output as well).\n\n`godep restore` is what attempts to set the state of your dependencies in your $GOPATH to what they are in your repo. To do this it first downloads (via `go get -d`) each of the packages in your `Godeps/Godeps.json` file and then using the proper vcs for each package's repo attempts to checkout the recorded version. \n\nGiven that explanation, are you having a specific problem with anything?\n. Can you include the copy of the error and your Godeps.json file?\n. Yes so godep tries to 'go get -d' those packages and if it can't you'll get those errors. The go tooling only works off of master atm. So you'll get those errors since those packages don't exist on master anymore. \n\nWe probably want to switch to using the appropriate vcs to checkout the right repo instead of go get, but that's probably more work than I think it will be.\n\nthis is also probably a source of a lot of restore issue and frustration.\n\nThe only way to resolve this atm is manually with something like:\n1. go get -u <base package>\n2. Update your code/removing references to no longer supported packages.\n3. Remove the old packages from `Godeps/Godeps.json`.\n4. `godep save` to vendor your new imports.\n. It's used in the heroku buildpack to determine what version of go should be used to compile the provided code. I have thought about doing something similar in the heroku buildpack (where '1.4.*' would mean the latest patch revision of 1.4'. Beyond that I consider it an optional field as godep really shouldn't be involved with compiling code in any way in the long term. But also note that godep will update that value if you save and are running a newer version.\n. That would be great!\n. We should. PRs always welcome ;-). I'll see if I can get to it sometime soon.\n. I have been thinking about doing just this thing, so that when `GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1` is set to have `godep get` DL directly into the `vendor/` directory. It's pretty much what I would expect.\n. I am, but I don't have a timeline atm.\n. This would make the code unbuildable w/o those packages, so I can't accept this.\n. Looks like a good start.\nAny reason why we shouldn't include this as a library though?\n\nWrt using it ...\ngodep (generally speaking) uses absolute paths to files it finds in the repo. [copySrc](https://github.com/tools/godep/blob/32d49a17abe34aec8a58f6b4d049efd846206dfe/save.go#L268-L296) uses [vcs.listFiles()](https://github.com/tools/godep/blob/32d49a17abe34aec8a58f6b4d049efd846206dfe/vcs.go#L124-L144)  to get that list and [copyPkgFile](https://github.com/tools/godep/blob/32d49a17abe34aec8a58f6b4d049efd846206dfe/save.go#L298-L328) to conditionally copy the files into the vendor directory.\n\nSo IMO `IsLicenseFile` and `IsLegalFile` should take into consideration that it may get a full (or partial) path to a filename, not just the basename\n. @client9 vcs.listFiles() already produces a list of all possible filenames (with absolute paths) that would be considered for copying. Each of those is passed to copyPkgFile, where filtering takes place (arguably the filtering should be in a separate function) and if not filtered out the file is then copied. Please take a look at those functions as you can probably just hook into copyPkgFile.\n. @client9 After reading your comment I realized that [dep.dir](https://github.com/tools/godep/blob/32d49a17abe34aec8a58f6b4d049efd846206dfe/save.go#L282) could be a sub package as well, which I didn't consider last night, so you'll only be [walking](https://github.com/tools/godep/blob/32d49a17abe34aec8a58f6b4d049efd846206dfe/save.go#L284-L290) through the files in that sub package.\n\nAnother loop, using the contents of [vf](https://github.com/tools/godep/blob/32d49a17abe34aec8a58f6b4d049efd846206dfe/save.go#L282), which contains all tracked files in the repo (as absolute paths) is possibly the way to go?\n. @client9 Cool, let me know when I should re-review the PR.\n. @client9 Thanks, merged after a rebase/squash/version/changelog addition.\n. dcbe29c7a18887497b4857e64665d25be43f7c7e\n. What about other vcs?\n. @rasky I'll accept this if we can cover all vcs types. Tests would also be good.\n\nI also need to think about this a little more. What does it mean if the repo is dirty, with changes elsewhere but the particular package is \"clean\",  I think erroring out is still the sanest path.\n. 2 months w/o movement, so closing for now. Please re-open if you are still interested.\n. What is the vcs root in the above example? I assume it's the parent directory of `dirty` and `help` as in the example?\n. @rasky I am trying to understand what's going on here and the motivators. Godep is designed to be run in the top package of a repo. There is nothing in your PR BTW.\n. Sorry, I missed the `.` in the diff (I thought it was only a space via a quick glance). My bad.\n\nRe: description.\n\nAs I said godep is designed to work against the top level package of a repo. You are asking for a fundamental change to the tool.\n. PS: I guess I've already started that fundamental change with previous changes, so I'll have to think about this more.\n. @rasky That's for a dependency, not for the repo you are vendoring into. In your example, let's say `golang.org/x/crypto/ssh` needed to vendor something, `godep save` should only be run at the `golang.org/x/crypto` level.\n. @Alex-Addy You do not need to use godep to build if you a) rewrite your deps or b) are using go1.5+ with the GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1. Both of those are recommended over using godep to build.\n. @Alex-Addy godep should only be used from the root package of a repo. If a repo contains multiple packages you should not be running `godep save` in each package, but in the root package for that repo and use a more inclusive package selector (`./...`, `./<dira> ./<dirb>`, etc).\n. It's because you specified `./...` with `go test`. Which means you are running all of your tests and all tests inside the `vendor/` directory. Go test needs to build the code first so you run into this error. In go 1.5+ you can't import main packages (you could previously), so I think it makes sense for us to not vendor them. I won't be able to look into this more until later in the week / early next week, but will do so.\n. When you say 'adjacent' directory, what do you mean. Can you give me an example package directory structure?\n. @aj0strow Can I get your Heroku ticket #?\n. Moving this back to that Heroku ticket for now. Will update either this issue or open a new one pending the outcome there.\n. Turns out that you can also add the package to the godep save command line package spec. BUT, that's unlikely to work with the GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT.\n. Interesting. There used to be a bug like this, but it's been fixed for months. What version of godep are you using (`godep version`)? Can you produce a public repo that reproduces?\n. I was thinking of issue #231, which was about long lines, not really long files per se, but should be fixed anyway.\n. @client9 Any commits merged to master should include a version bump, a changelog entry and a tag. Since that's a manualish process it hasn't gone as smoothly as I'd like. Improvements to the process that continue to maintain godep's `go get`ableness are appreciated.\n. That already exists https://github.com/tools/godep/blob/58b9be6061a97e574c0695d6f15031f8b01a9629/main.go#L83-L86\n. No, thank you!\n. -t wasn't propagated to update. This should be fixed. If you have time/interested in doing a PR, great. If not I'll probably get to it either later today or tomorrow.\n. Thanks @kr. See #316 \n. how about this instead?\n\n``` go\nfunc runIn(dir, name string, args ...string) error {\n    c := exec.Command(name, args...)\n    c.Dir = dir\n    output, err := c.CombinedOutput()\n\n    if verbose {\n        fmt.Printf(\"execute: %+v\\n\", c)\n        fmt.Printf(\" output: %s\\n\", output)\n    }\n\n    return err\n}\n```\n\nSeems simpler and maintains intent AFAICT.\n. @jmhodges Thanks, merged as 605fb21360e22cca107bdc4d0c972cbf14353977 (I assume due to a rebase).\n. I'm not sure I follow. Do you mean editing files in `<proj>/Godeps/_workspace/src/..`? \n. @kr I was around. ;-)\n. Merged as: 0a8bd86405086a8fe6ceb91efc7214ebef864da8, so closing this.\n. Merged as e9ac6d762b492fd3c1fbf50e7c50f8ba64b9c42e\n. I think I'm alright with is as well (which is a change from my initial reaction).  Asking around a little internally as well.\n\nI would like to land a change to heroku/heroku-buildpack-go to select the latest minor version of the specified major version before merging a PR that implements @kr's suggestion.\n. @jtarchie If this lands before the buildpack changes they will be tied to the major go version until the BP can resolve the latest minor release (assuming they update their Godeps.json file and push). I don't like that behavior.\n. @flavorjones #342 merged as v39.\n. What would restoring from the Godeps workspace mean? We don't vendor the entire repository of packages being used, including the commit history, just the packages being used and the commit hash.\n. @matejkramny it's what is used to build a project and the only way to guarantee that the code is available is to commit it along with our own code.\n. To fully restore the repos that the packages live in to the $GOPATH. If we didn't do that there would be missing packages/tests/etc in your $GOPATH.\n\nFWIW: My plan is to remove `restore` sometime after most people appear to be using go1.6+ and using the GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT. So probably around the go1.7 timeframe. I'm hoping other maintainers/users agree with that (TBD).\n. I'm pretty sure I know why. Not sure what to do about it. Need to see if I can make a test case for this as well.\n. I don't think we can rely on `go get` to DTRT for downloads. The internal package doesn't exist in master anymore, so go getting the package first produces this error.\n. It's probably best if you want to discuss these / work these through to split this PR into two. One for each issue.\n\nPS: Symlinks inside $GOPATH aren't really supported (ex. https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-dev/GLUZGtUSj8A/SGUtCooLIT0J), so I'm curious as to how you are using them and why we would need to resolve them.\n. Thank you!\n. I started looking into this and I think this is really a side effect of a bug in /vendor/ (and possibly Godeps workspace handling or because of it). I'm digging in more.\n. Merged as 5e3d21abab679aef179d5dce308289619a59cf22\n\nThanks!\n. @sbogacz @michaeltrobinson This may be fixed in master now, can you please confirm.\n. @michaeltrobinson Great. I'm going to close this then. Thanks!\n. FWIW: Godep should support this as it knowns about both styles, old Godeps with and without rewrites and vendor. I hope to fix that issue \"soonish\", but don't know when I'll get to it.\n. Agreed. It's pretty low on _my_ priority list atm, given the other issues related to `vendor/` vs. Godeps workspace vs. Godeps workspace with rewrites. If you would like to take a crack at it though that would be great.\n. I don't understand this use case.\n\nI use and have several multi-command repositories that use godep.\n\nHere is one of them: https://github.com/heroku/shh\n\nWhen working with this project we `cd` into `$GOPATH/src/github.com/heroku/shh` and run `godep save -r ./...` and all of the deps for everything are vendored/rewritten.\n. a) godep is meant to be run against the root of a repo containing one or more packages. If you have a structure of `./mylib/cmd/cmdname` and run godep save in the `cmdname` directory `mylib` will be vendored again in `cmdname's` Godep workspace. This will likely lead to additional confusion.\n\nb) A PR that changes a single vcs command will not be accepted unless all vcs commands are updated, or proven to not need the same update. In the past this has led to problems/breakage in other vcs.\n\nc) The change probably doesn't do what you want as `git diff <rev> .` still considers sub dirs of `.`. So if you are running this in a `cmd` directory it will detect the library as dirty if any of the sub dirs/packages are dirty. Or at least it does with my version of git (2.6.3) / local config. I googled around for a \"fix\", but I don't think there's a simple fix to this w/o filtering things like dirstat output.\n. FWIW: I think the point of isDirty(dir,rev) was to determine if the repo root is dirty, not any given directory in a repo, but I'd have to let @kr chime in.\n. @azylman if that unmodified package pulls in other packages in the same repo that aren dirty and have local changes that you rely on? I guess we'd pick that up as a dependency on bomb out there though. So no, I don't think there's any problem with doing that, code just need to be adjusted properly.\n. FWIW This only works with git, what about the other vcs? Whatever we do we need to be able to support it across all supported vcs implementations.\n. Try unsetting $GIT_DIR maybe?\n. Oh duh on me. That's probably because godep save adds files to the repository, leaving it in a dirty state.\n. godep save will will copy deps to `<proj>/Godeps/_workspace/src`. At that point the tree is dirty. At the very least least the hook needs to `git add -A Godeps` after the godep save.\n. Tested this and with a few minor changes to the hook, it works currently.\n\nThis is the hook I used....\n\n``` bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\nset -e\n\nunset GIT_DIR\nunset GIT_INDEX_FILE\n\n$GOPATH/bin/godep save ./...\nNOGODEPCHANGES=\"$(git ls-files . --exclude-standard --others --modified | grep Godeps | wc -l)\"\n\nif [ $NOGODEPCHANGES -gt 0 ]; then\n  cat <<\\EOF\nERROR: Some Go dependencies have been updated with `godep save`\nERROR: Please add them to your commit.\nEOF\n  exit 1\nfi\n\nexit 0\n```\n. @bojan-embroker I don't understand your problem then as this worked for me.\n. @bbokorney Since you are updating the version, please also update the Changelog and squash down to a single commit. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. @shurcooL Thanks, merged as cf33bd75a8243ac701090bb6fa8e0b81b9746fcb\n. Try `godep save -r ./...`\n. `.` is the default.\n. We currently rely on go get, so if it's fixed in go 1.6 (and if we're continuing to rely on get by then) it will be fixed then. Nothing much we can do here aside from re-implement `go get`, which we may need to do anyway for other reasons. :-( I'm going to leave open for now though as reminder of issues with go get.\n. What godep version? \n. See https://github.com/tools/godep/pull/362 and https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/18695 (similar, dep was basically missing before).\n. godep save supports saving any package specified in the pkg spec.\nWe are using that internally to vendor `github.com/zimbatm/socketmaster` into an application. socketmaster is a `main` package.\n\nSo specifying something like `godep save -r ./... github.com/zimbatm/socketmaster` works as expected. using something like `jq` the heroku buildpack [reads the Packages out of the Godeps/Godeps.json](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-go/blob/52ebcad122e4cb12ae9bf9bba13aa9f0342fd5d6/bin/compile#L177) file and installs all of the packages specified there with [`godep go install $pkgs`](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-go/blob/52ebcad122e4cb12ae9bf9bba13aa9f0342fd5d6/bin/compile#L227).\n\nCould you try something like that instead?\n. PS: I'm also -1 wrt adding another file.\n. @jonboulle the package spec passed to `godep save` is what feeds godep the list of packages to inspect for 'automagical detection'. I would only list `main` packages if you want them saved. Arguably `godep save` w/o any args should default to `.` or the contents of the `Godeps/Godeps.json` Packages array, if the file exists. This would probably help a lot and help people DTRT more often. Thoughts?\n. Re Rewrites: it would rewrite and vendor any of the imports the vendored tool imports. But you'de want that wouldn't you? That's the only way to guarantee you can build that tool later.\n\nre: Godeps.jon: It's already a manifest, and I don't mean manually editable. Yes, it changes the current workflow a bit (but not much). I'm basically saying that every time you do a `godep save` it reads in `Godeps/Godeps.json` and if there is a Packages array there it uses those values for the package spec. If there is none, it defaults to `.`. If you specify a new package spec with a save it uses that one, overwriting the existing one in the file. This is where problems could come up though.\n. Ahh yeah. I missed that. For instance github.com/zimbatm/socketmaster doesn't have any external deps, so no rewrites. You could _not_ use rewrites for now, but either way that's a bug,\n. Hmm. This may break how some people use godep, not sure. The way _I'd_ like godep used is that it would only rewrite packages that are specified via a relative package spec (`., ./, ./..., ./cmd/..., etc`) and their dependencies. In my mind it should not rewrite other package specs at their original location(s). But I can see how some people may use the fully qualified package spec when doing save (e.g.: `godep save github.com/me/thepackageImworkingon`). I've also seen people construct oddities in Makefiles to enumerate packages and pass the fully qualified package names to godep (I don't know _why_ they do that though).\n\nThis would also require some tests, if they don't exist.\n. If you want to take a crack at any of the things we discussed I'd be happy to review. For now I'm going to close this PR though. Thanks!\n. LoadPackages still uses `go list`. I opened a PR yesterday that removes `go list` and also solves the missing deps problem: #341, effectively making your `-a` just the way godeps works (at least AFAICT).\n. FWIW: I've never run into this and use godep almost daily. I'm not against sorting the dependencies though. I would like a repeatable example of when/how this happens and a test for it.\n. @JekaMas Can you provide an example of this workflow?\n. What is the output of `echo $GOPATH` and `pwd` when you run these commands?\n. Turns out @imajes's $GOPATH is symlinked out of a Dropbox folder. `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` shows the symlink resolved path, so none of the `Contains()` calls finds the file.\n. This may also fix #334.\n. @kr sorry about the noise a bunch of stuff in pkg.go slipped in from another, earlier experiment.\n. Would close #337 \n. @neurogeek After some issue discussion (heroku/heroku-buildpack-go/100 and another I can't find atm) I generally think that we should really only care about the major version of Go and let downstream systems care about selecting the minor version (the user or build systems). There are probably exceptions to that, hence I also stopped auto-updating the go version on save, allowing people to specify whatever they want if they manually want to manage the file. \n. Thanks for taking the time to write this PR. FWIW: I'm -1 another flag. I'm +1 for an implementation that skips rewrites for any package specified that falls outside of the package in the cwd and it's sub packages though. While this may nerf godep for some people I think it's a what most people would expect and the least surprising. \n. It probably needs another rebase. Let me take a quick look and make some code comments too.\n. See comments, also a rebase (sorry). Thanks for adding the positions to the comments. Otherwise LGTM.\n. Small comment about the new type, otherwise LGTM\n. @krnowak Thanks for your patience with the extended review!\n. FWIW: My plan is to really only support \"compilation\" (go get github.com/tools/godep) against the current major version of go and the last major version of go. Currently go1.5.\\* & go1.4.\\* basically.\n\nPS: Once #352 lands this should be fixed.\n. @robdimsdale I updated the readme slightly to reflect the new versions. If you feel that's not sufficient a PR would be great!\n\nPS: #352 is merged as v34 and should fix this problem. Can you confirm?\n. \"Fixed\" in #352 as we'll also ignore files with the \"ignore\" build tag, at least for now. I think that's the path of least surprise. \n. Thanks for the PR, but I took a different approach in #352.\n. @njohns-grovo Yeah [v32](https://github.com/tools/godep/tree/v32) should be okay atm. Sorry about that. I think I was being too optimistic with my use of build.Context. I'll add a test to duplicate this and bang on the new package evaluation code to fix it.\n. What version of go (output of `go version`) are you using?\n. This is because `go/build` does not have MultiplePackageError previous to go1.4 (IIRC; didn't check). #350 should fix this as we don't use that error anymore.\n. ps: also using the v33 executable should also work (barring other problems fixed in #352)\n. v34 (#352) should fix this.\n. Thanks for the PR, but I took a different approach in #352.\n. I'm going to let this sit for bit as I want to re-read it after I put it down for a little. Probably also a bunch of cleanups I can do as well.\n. Probably also fixes #345, #346, #347, #351. Need to make sure we have tests to cover those cases though.\n. Fixes #350 (We don't that error anymore).\n. \"Fixes\" #353 \n. We can probably get some (hopefully all?) of that back with a cache of ast files and/or a package cache. I'll PR later today.\n\n> On Dec 8, 2015, at 20:57, Jonathan Boulle notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> This change appears to have had a pathological effect on performance in at least one of our repos (coreos/rkt):\n> \n>  ; time /tmp/gopath/bin/godep32 save -r ./...\n> \n> real    0m1.649s\n> user    0m1.383s\n> sys 0m0.341s\n>  ; time /tmp/gopath/bin/godep33 save -r ./...\n> godep: found packages keygen.go (main) and keymap.go (keystoretest) in /tmp/gopath/src/github.com/coreos/rkt/pkg/keystore/keystoretest\n> \n> real    0m1.729s\n> user    0m1.487s\n> sys 0m0.240s\n>  ; time /tmp/gopath/bin/godep34 save -r ./...\n> \n> real    0m41.054s\n> user    0m37.493s\n> sys 0m4.088s\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. @jonboulle v34 should fix that.

Since this is guarded by a build tag `go list -e -json google.golang.org/appengine` wouldn't pick it up, so it worked. \n\nWe now parse all files regardless of build tag and \"appengine\" isn't a valid import (except on appengine probably).\n\n``` console\n$ go list -e -json appengine\n{\n    \"ImportPath\": \"appengine\",\n    \"Stale\": true,\n    \"Incomplete\": true,\n    \"Error\": {\n        \"ImportStack\": [\n            \"appengine\"\n        ],\n        \"Pos\": \"\",\n        \"Err\": \"cannot find package \\\"appengine\\\" in any of:\\n\\t/usr/local/go/src/appengine (from $GOROOT)\\n\\t/Users/emuller/go/src/appengine (from $GOPATH)\"\n    }\n}\n```\n. I'm not 100% sure what to do about this (aside from full build tag support for godeps). I may just special case \"appengine\" for now to unblock anyone hitting this issue and then remove that special case if/when full build tag support materializes. \n. Yes. Sorry. I was so focused on #357 and other stuff this week I haven't kept up on many other PRs. :-( \n. Thanks for taking the time to do the PR.\n. `godep save -r ./... github.com/gengo/grpc-gateway/third_party/googleapis/...`\n\nRewrites will work sanely once #343 is merged (likely next week pending rebase / update by author).\n\nThat should vendor the `github.com/gengo/grpc-gateway/third_party/googleapis` and all it's sub packages assuming they're not messed up in some way (or a bug).\n.

FWIW: Based on the [Makefile](https://github.com/libopenstorage/openstorage/blob/d84dc4ab90841c3d6413d21339b4d6c4fb856d03/Makefile) I don't really understand how you are using godep. You want to keep the Godeps/Godeps.json file around so it's relatively easy to determine what was already vendored (either in the godeps workspace or `vendor/`)\n. Also, at least until I can do away with the Godep workspace, godep works on the principle that packages be installed in the $GOPATH for save to work. I would do a `godep restore` to continue testing, but there is no `Godeps/Godeps.json` file available for a restore to work and be reliable.\n. @peter-edge I'm going to close this issue again. I'd like to continue discussion your use of godep but there are several issues and AFAICT they don't have anything to do with this one.\n. I realized what the problem is. My understanding of how `build.FindOnly` works was faulty. So I'm working on a replacement.\n. @eparis GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1 ?\n. This is probably because these newer versions are more inclusive wrt what they'll vendor and the same rules are being applied to restore, so it's not finding a package it thinks should be vendored. :-( \n\nI wonder if doing a `go get golang.org/x/sys/unix` will take care of it and/or change the errors?\n. For some more clarity we only ignore files tagged with `ignore` and `appengine` build tags. Before `go list` would also filter out any non local platform files. This caused issues in that a lot of development happens on OSX, but deployments happen on Linux. So if your deps required an extra package on Linux, they wouldn't be saved and then your build would likely fail (depending how how you setup your environment TBH and lots of people mistook how godeps works because of this).\n. I'm going to poke at this early this afternoon (Pacific/US) and see if I can provide better guidance / work around / suggestions / patch / etc.\n. This is what I get currently on master with godep v36:\n\n``` console\n$ mkdir ~/go2\n$ export GOPATH=~/go2\n$ go get -u k8s.io/kubernetes\npackage k8s.io/kubernetes: no buildable Go source files in /Users/emuller/go2/src/k8s.io/kubernetes\n$ cd ~/go2/src/k8s.io/kubernetes\n$ godep restore\ngodep: error downloading dep (github.com/google/cadvisor/api): exit status 1\ngodep: error downloading dep (github.com/google/cadvisor/http): exit status 1\ngodep: error downloading dep (github.com/google/cadvisor/manager): exit status 1\ngodep: error downloading dep (github.com/google/cadvisor/pages): exit status 1\ngodep: error downloading dep (github.com/google/cadvisor/validate): exit status 1\ngodep: error downloading dep (golang.org/x/exp/inotify): exit status 1\n```\n\nThese restore issues may be related to something else I need to look into. Digging.\n. Not sure. There is also an issue where restore will fail (currently) if the dep package is no longer available in master (that's the issue I was referring to, not sure the number). I'd like to fix that issue this week, but may be unrelated.\n. ``` console\n$ go get -d github.com/google/cadvisor/api\ncontainer/raw/handler.go:38:2: no buildable Go source files in /Users/emuller/go2/src/golang.org/x/exp/inotify\n```\n\ncadvisor is having issues on master. This is basically the same bug as the one I mentioned.\n. FWIW: the cadvisor issue has nothing to do with godeps per se. Master isn't even buildable for me.\n. @eparis BTW: I wasn't able to reproduce the initial issue (`Unable to find dependent package golang.org/x/sys/unix`). What OS was that restore run on ?\n. I suspect it was linux. If so you probably want to re-save using v35 to pick up new deps.\n. That's possible. I'll make a linux VM /  AWS instance after lunch and duplicate / etc.\n. Duplicated in a linux docker container:\n\n``` console\n$ godep restore\ngodep: error restoring dep (github.com/Sirupsen/logrus): Unable to find dependent package golang.org/x/sys/unix in context of /app/user/src/github.com/Sirupsen/logrus\ngodep: error restoring dep (github.com/boltdb/bolt): Unable to find dependent package golang.org/x/sys/unix in context of /app/user/src/github.com/boltdb/bolt\ngodep: error restoring dep (github.com/docker/docker/pkg/jsonmessage): Unable to find dependent package github.com/Azure/go-ansiterm/winterm in context of /app/user/src/github.com/docker/docker/pkg/term\ngodep: error restoring dep (github.com/docker/docker/pkg/term): Unable to find dependent package github.com/Azure/go-ansiterm/winterm in context of /app/user/src/github.com/docker/docker/pkg/term\ngodep: error restoring dep (github.com/docker/libcontainer): Unable to find dependent package golang.org/x/sys/unix in context of /app/user/src/github.com/Sirupsen/logrus\n\ngodep: error restoring dep (github.com/google/cadvisor/api): Unable to find dependent package github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient/external/github.com/hashicorp/go-cleanhttp in context of /app/user/src/github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient\ngodep: error restoring dep (github.com/google/cadvisor/http): Unable to find dependent package github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient/external/github.com/hashicorp/go-cleanhttp in context of /app/user/src/github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient\ngodep: error restoring dep (github.com/google/cadvisor/manager): Unable to find dependent package github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient/external/github.com/hashicorp/go-cleanhttp in context of /app/user/src/github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient\ngodep: error restoring dep (github.com/google/cadvisor/pages): Unable to find dependent package github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient/external/github.com/hashicorp/go-cleanhttp in context of /app/user/src/github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient\ngodep: error restoring dep (github.com/google/cadvisor/validate): Unable to find dependent package github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient/external/github.com/hashicorp/go-cleanhttp in context of /app/user/src/github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient\n```\n\nSome of these are confirmed platform specific transitive dependencies that were missed by older versions of godep.\n\nIn the case of logrus & bolt they both import `golang.org/x/sys/unix` on solaris.\n`docker/docker/pkg/term` has a windows specific transitive import on `github.com/Azure/go-ansiterm\"`\n\nThe `github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient/external/github.com/hashicorp/go-cleanhttp` errors are something else, possibly related to an ordering issue in the restore code.\n\nI'm looking into this and related stuff.\n. @eparis See #362 along with https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/18695\n. @thanodnl Previous to #362 godep loaded the packages before checking out the specified versions. This caused problems, especially with other recent changes (but they were present before anyway, just less pronounced).\n\n@eparis You guys need `golang.org/x/sys/unix` because of bolt:\n\n``` console\n$ godep restore -v  #Using the #362 version of godep.\n...\ngodep: Checking dependency: github.com/boltdb/bolt\ngodep: Dep (github.com/boltdb/bolt) restored, but was unable to load it with error:\n    Unable to find dependent package golang.org/x/sys/unix in context of /Users/emuller/go2/src/github.com/boltdb/bolt\ngodep:  This may be because the dependencies were saved with an older version of godep (< v33).\ngodep:  Try `go get golang.org/x/sys/unix`. Then `godep save` to update deps.\n...\n```\n. @ironcladlou yes. Thanks. Marked as resolved.\n. what is your godep version?\n. FWIW: until v33 `godep save ./...` would only save deps for the current platform.\n. `godep version` should work for any version of godep after ~v1 (IIRC).\n. If you are using GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT (and it looks like you are) and running v35 then update to v36 (https://github.com/tools/godep/issues/358)  and let me know if there is still an issue.\n\nI'm going to start committing GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT related tests tomorrow (hopefully) and if not I'd like to get a reproducable test case for this. \n. :-( I'll see if I can make a small repro tomorrow (although I probably won't get to it until the afternoon).\n. Closing in favor of #358 \n. Thanks! (merged as part of bf180cbe9d2f255d72616470db39c2cae2f77e5d)\n. @ironcladlou This should solve the aws-sdk issue .... but there are some consistency issues with `github.com/openshift/origin` Godeps.json file. \n\nSome of them are duplicate shas for the same repo, one for package A another for package B in the same repo:\n- https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/0d4de0b1801e8c58a28c8bcd9d12b5d0c46de1cb/Godeps/Godeps.json#L744-L753\n- https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/0d4de0b1801e8c58a28c8bcd9d12b5d0c46de1cb/Godeps/Godeps.json#L876-L895 \n\nSome appear to be shas from forks of the repos that are not on the canonical master (see #366).\n\nThere is at least once case where a recorded package is missing (looks to be in a [PR](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/7893)) but is also recorded twice with 2 [different shas](https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/0d4de0b1801e8c58a28c8bcd9d12b5d0c46de1cb/Godeps/Godeps.json#L1241-L1250).\n. /cc @eparis This should solve for packages that were removed.\n. @eparis confirmed that this solves the docker/timeutils issues for you as well.\n. https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/18685 for reference\n. @tsaikd What version of godep are you using? and if it's not the latest, is it still an issue with the latest version?\n. AFAICT your Godeps.json file is incomplete?\n\nIf I make a simple app that uses the appengine package my generated Godeps.json file looks like this:\n\n``` console\n$ cat Godeps/Godeps.json\n{\n    \"ImportPath\": \"github.com/freeformz/t365\",\n    \"GoVersion\": \"go1.5\",\n    \"Deps\": [\n        {\n            \"ImportPath\": \"github.com/golang/protobuf/proto\",\n            \"Rev\": \"68415e7123da32b07eab49c96d2c4d6158360e9b\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"ImportPath\": \"golang.org/x/net/context\",\n            \"Rev\": \"0ab009005dc16437045369e823a35d1af6232b69\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"ImportPath\": \"google.golang.org/appengine\",\n            \"Rev\": \"54bf9150c922186bfc45a00bf9dfcb91a5063275\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nAlso: You do not need to do a `go get` after a `godep restore` as long as all of your deps are recorded (which `godep save` does).\n. Go is not node. The `google.golang.org/appengine` package uses `github.com/golang/protobuf/proto` and w/o it the code won't build. Godeps is about making builds repeatable. W/o that code vendored there may be times where I can build your code (I've seen npm go down and cause all sorts of problems where users could no longer deploy).\n. @DreadPirateShawn I was able to reproduce this by synthetically checking out the affected package and running restore. Will look more: \n\n``` console\n$ godep restore -v\n...\ngodep: error restoring dep (github.com/prometheus/client_golang/model): cannot find package \"github.com/prometheus/client_golang/model\" in any of:\n    /usr/local/go/src/github.com/prometheus/client_golang/model (from $GOROOT)\n    /Users/emuller/go2/src/github.com/prometheus/client_golang/model (from $GOPATH)\n```\n. I was wondering if, across all vcs, if it's possible to determine which remote has a given ref. godep save could record the appropriate remote if so in a key.\n. This seems to work okay for me with current godep:\n\n``` console\n$ mkdir ~/go2\n$ export GOPATH=~/go2\n$ go get -u github.com/go-gomail/gomail\n$ cd ~/go2/src/github.com/go-gomail/gomail\n$ godep save -r -v\ngodep: Unable to find dependent package gopkg.in/alexcesaro/quotedprintable.v3 in context of /Users/emuller/go2/src/github.com/go-gomail/gomail\n$ # This is fine since it's an empty GOPATH\n$ go get gopkg.in/alexcesaro/quotedprintable.v3 # This is the package that mime_go14.go uses\n$ godep save -r -v\ngodep: cannot find package \"gopkg.in/gomail.v2\" in any of:\n    /usr/local/go/src/gopkg.in/gomail.v2 (from $GOROOT)\n    /Users/emuller/go2/src/gopkg.in/gomail.v2 (from $GOPATH)\n$ go get gopkg.in/gomail.v2\n$ godep save -r -v\ngodep: save: skipping test file: /Users/emuller/go2/src/gopkg.in/alexcesaro/quotedprintable.v3/encodedword_test.go\ngodep: save: skipping test file: /Users/emuller/go2/src/gopkg.in/alexcesaro/quotedprintable.v3/reader_test.go\ngodep: save: skipping test file: /Users/emuller/go2/src/gopkg.in/alexcesaro/quotedprintable.v3/writer_test.go\ngodep: save: skipping test file: /Users/emuller/go2/src/gopkg.in/gomail.v2/auth_test.go\ngodep: save: skipping test file: /Users/emuller/go2/src/gopkg.in/gomail.v2/example_test.go\ngodep: save: skipping test file: /Users/emuller/go2/src/gopkg.in/gomail.v2/message_test.go\ngodep: save: skipping test file: /Users/emuller/go2/src/gopkg.in/gomail.v2/send_test.go\ngodep: save: skipping test file: /Users/emuller/go2/src/gopkg.in/gomail.v2/smtp_test.go\n$ git status\nOn branch master\nYour branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.\nChanges not staged for commit:\n  (use \"git add <file>...\" to update what will be committed)\n  (use \"git checkout -- <file>...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n\n    modified:   example_test.go\n    modified:   mime_go14.go\n\nUntracked files:\n  (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\n\n    Godeps/\n\nno changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\n$ # Files modified because of rewrites\n$ find Godeps\nGodeps\nGodeps/_workspace\nGodeps/_workspace/.gitignore\nGodeps/_workspace/src\nGodeps/_workspace/src/gopkg.in\nGodeps/_workspace/src/gopkg.in/alexcesaro\nGodeps/_workspace/src/gopkg.in/alexcesaro/quotedprintable.v3\nGodeps/_workspace/src/gopkg.in/alexcesaro/quotedprintable.v3/encodedword.go\nGodeps/_workspace/src/gopkg.in/alexcesaro/quotedprintable.v3/LICENSE\nGodeps/_workspace/src/gopkg.in/alexcesaro/quotedprintable.v3/pool.go\nGodeps/_workspace/src/gopkg.in/alexcesaro/quotedprintable.v3/pool_go12.go\nGodeps/_workspace/src/gopkg.in/alexcesaro/quotedprintable.v3/reader.go\nGodeps/_workspace/src/gopkg.in/alexcesaro/quotedprintable.v3/README.md\nGodeps/_workspace/src/gopkg.in/alexcesaro/quotedprintable.v3/writer.go\nGodeps/_workspace/src/gopkg.in/gomail.v2\nGodeps/_workspace/src/gopkg.in/gomail.v2/.travis.yml\nGodeps/_workspace/src/gopkg.in/gomail.v2/auth.go\nGodeps/_workspace/src/gopkg.in/gomail.v2/CHANGELOG.md\nGodeps/_workspace/src/gopkg.in/gomail.v2/CONTRIBUTING.md\nGodeps/_workspace/src/gopkg.in/gomail.v2/doc.go\nGodeps/_workspace/src/gopkg.in/gomail.v2/LICENSE\nGodeps/_workspace/src/gopkg.in/gomail.v2/message.go\nGodeps/_workspace/src/gopkg.in/gomail.v2/mime.go\nGodeps/_workspace/src/gopkg.in/gomail.v2/mime_go14.go\nGodeps/_workspace/src/gopkg.in/gomail.v2/README.md\nGodeps/_workspace/src/gopkg.in/gomail.v2/send.go\nGodeps/_workspace/src/gopkg.in/gomail.v2/smtp.go\nGodeps/_workspace/src/gopkg.in/gomail.v2/writeto.go\nGodeps/Godeps.json\nGodeps/Readme\n$ cat Godeps/Godeps.json\n{\n    \"ImportPath\": \"github.com/go-gomail/gomail\",\n    \"GoVersion\": \"go1.5\",\n    \"Deps\": [\n        {\n            \"ImportPath\": \"gopkg.in/alexcesaro/quotedprintable.v3\",\n            \"Rev\": \"2caba252f4dc53eaf6b553000885530023f54623\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"ImportPath\": \"gopkg.in/gomail.v2\",\n            \"Comment\": \"2.0.0-8-gfbb71dd\",\n            \"Rev\": \"fbb71ddc63acd07dd0ed49ababdf02c551e2539a\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n. I plan on changing up the error message a bit to recommend a `godep get <pkg>` and then have the get command properly fetch all transitive deps (right now it can still miss some as it's still using `go get`). As a possible additional step I was thinking of adding a `get` option to save (or just make it the default). For now you can fetch the other deps manually with `go get`.\n. Maybe godep should also handle build tags based on the version specified in Godep.json? That does open up a different set of problems (like additional work on `godep update -goversion`). ATM godep will vendor every dep it finds, regardless of tags (except for `ignore` and `appengine`), this is by design.\n. Not yet, I am thinking that godep should probably use the recorded go version in conjunction with build tags to DTRT and not analyze deps for go versions that differ from what's recorded. The idea being that what's recorded as the go version is the version in use and the one being tested against. But I'm sure some people would disagree with that. There is an argument to be made for either case. For instance see #386 \n. Recent versions of go record the version of go in use and also support go version build tags, so I'm closing this.\n. Can you commit the `Godeps/Godeps.json` file that your are using so that I can investigate?\n. You would have already created a Godeps/Godeps.json file when you originally saved your `vendor/` directory. You would then `godep restore` things into your $GOPATH. FWIW: I realize that this usage with `vendor/` is less than optimal, but I can't change it too much w/o breaking the non `vendor/` way ATM.\n. let me see if I can repro after manually installing all the deps.\n. Heh. I see there is a makefile target for that. \n. ``` console\n$ mkdir ~/go2\n$ export GOPATH=~/go2\n$ go get -d github.com/libopenstorage/openstorage\npackage github.com/libopenstorage/openstorage: no

The package argument that you pass to `godep save` is the package(s) that you want to analyze for vendoring, not the package that you want to save.

It is a transitive dependency that \"go get\" does not fetch, but can be required on other platforms to build the package.

If you `godep save` and record that dep you can remove the need to fetch it with go get.\n. @geofffranks Yes, this should be fixed as of a month or two ago. I'm going to close this issue, but feel free to re-open if it's still failing with deps saved by v55.\n\nThanks!\n. Something you are requiring is transitively pulling in golang.org/x/sys/unix across OSes.\n. `go get golang.org/x/sys/unix`. After the restore you probably need to re-save to record `golang.org/x/sys/unix`.\n. Sorry. I should have replied sooner. This got lost in email. :-( \n\nI'd much rather do this by making [this](https://github.com/tools/godep/blob/master/list.go#L22) configurable via an array in Godps.json. Plus ensure that our code handles all the various permutations of build tags. And maybe default to what is hard coded now.\n. @diogogmt This is likely due to the fact that godep ignores arch build constraints, since it doesn't know where you will finally compile code. It's very common for people to dev on macOS, but build on Linux for instance.\n. `go get golang.org/x/sys/unix`\n\nFWIW: Now that work has started for a native solution (\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/go-package-management/P8TehVoFLjg/Ni6VRyOjEAAJ),\nI'm likely not going to be working on godep very much.

Nevermind, realized that your package root has a trailing slash, so this should be fixed in v44. Please let me know!\n. @c-knowles I could test the underlying function probably, but I'm not really sure how these paths are being generated in the first place, hence the initial ask for the entire debug output.\n. Sorry about that. I'll have to spin up a windows machine to test with. \n. @DamienFontaine So this looks like a case insensitive issue (which was different, but similar to the original issue). Can you test with a godep built from this branch: https://github.com/tools/godep/tree/pathEqual and confirm if things are fixed or not?\n. @DamienFontaine Great. Merged and released as v56.\n. This should be closed by v45. If not please re-open. Thanks!\n. This looks good, but what happens when a legal file get's dropped at `github.com/camlistore/go4/legal/LICENSE.md` ? AFAICT we'd include that one too when we probably shouldn't as errorutil doesn't depend on legal and shouldn't vendor anything from it.\n. @jonboulle I'm suggesting that fixing the later will also fix this issue, but in a more complete fashion.\n. @thockin godep does not verify if what you have in the workspace is what's recorded in `Godeps.json`. That is kind of hard tbh w/o messing with your $GOPATH and/or downloading a bunch of stuff. So yes, it assumes that if it's in Godeps.json that it's in your workspace. \n\nGO15VENDOREXPERIMENT only means something to go versions >= 1.5, so I don't really understand the use case for 1.4 versions of go.\n. I have to enable the vendor experiment if the target version of go is 1.6 and the environment variable != \"0\". It's what I would expect as a developer.\n\nI think this would work better for you...\n\n``` go\n    go15ve := os.Getenv(\"GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT\")\n    VendorExperiment = go15ve == \"1\" || (majorGoVersion == \"go1.6\" && go15ve != \"0\")\n```\n. TBH though I wouldn't expect that env var to do anything when using any version of go < 1.5\n. My intention when introducing `GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT` support was to mirror the go tool's behavior. With go 1.4 that flag doesn't mean anything. Since we no longer depend on `go list` I felt a stricter interpretation within godep was necessary to be more closely align with the go tool.\n\nPS: Why aren't you using go 1.5.2 locally at this point?\n. @thockin godep defines it's GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT flag like the go tool. So when using go1.4 it shouldn't do anything wrt that flag. I probably should have specified harder checks initially, but I really didn't expect people to _want_ to use it with go1.4 in that way, nor do I think most of our users. So I'm going to close this as \"works as intended\" in a few days unless others pipe up that my expectations are way off base.\n. Do you think we should record the sha?\n\n``` console\n$ go version\ngo version devel +8d5ff2e Tue Dec 29 21:16:59 2015 +0000 darwin/amd64\n```\n\nProbably not worth the hassle. If you are using devel it will just always vary most likely.\n. Thanks!\n.

It would have to be a separate flag, or a modification to the -t flag (make it have different modes beyond true/false). Many people want to save the deps for their tests, but not the deps for their dep's tests.\n\nAlso, would require a test case in save_test.go\n. Maybe we could combine this with the `diff` command somehow?  Or at the very least deprecate the diff command for this or something like it.\n\nI'm hesitant to add another command atm w/o more thought into it's purpose and how it fits in long term. For instance. I'd like to have `godep get` fetch directly into the `vendor/` directory when VendorExperiment is on (with a switch to disable) ... how would this command work then?\n. @awsmsrc I totally get the point and it's something I like. I don't use `diff` much because frankly it's not useful enough to me. I think something like this could be more useful.\n\n@shurcooL Nice packages/tools. I have been wanting to add something like `godep status` for a while to relay what godep thinks about the status of the project you are working on and it's dependencies. I think our licenses are compatible so I may look at \"borrowing\" some of that work. ;-) \n\n@client9 Godep has no real \"api\" atm, but I'm open to PRs / work to open one up.\n. @awsmsrc `godep diff` already shows what's outdated (although perhaps a little more haphazardly than we'd like. How about altering the way that command works to work like this proposal? I think this would be more useful to people anyway.\n. @awsmsrc SGTM I have a bunch of other stuff scheduled for this week.\n. @awsmsrc Are you still interested in working on this?\n. Closing, please open a new issue (or re-open this one) if you are interested.\n. It was an oversight omitting it from the Changelog (at the least) and the README. I'll see about fixing that up ASAP.\n\nWe currently do ignore files with `ignore` and `appengine` tags: https://github.com/tools/godep/blob/a1054101461cab7f7c67a22e3aabd0fdb567ce3a/list.go#L271\n\nFWIW: I'd like to add back in more tag support at some point.\n. Maybe we should just check earlier and abort as basically the GOPATH is assumed to exist ATM?\n. Thanks. Merged as c98cb3f12da9d553e2e47522800fec483a524beb.\n. If you can show me how to do that via travis-ci I'll be happy to add that. ATM travis-ci does all of the [releasing](https://github.com/tools/godep/blob/2daafc44881230f2d032188a278a7acc68dd5488/.travis.yml#L23-L35). \n. I'd be willing to test it out.\n. Should devel not have the same rule as 1.6  and be written as:\n\n``` go\n((majorGoVersion == \"go1.6\" || majorGoVersion == \"devel\" )&& os.Getenv(\"GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT\") != \"0\")\n```\n. Yes, the environment variable is supposed to be removed in go1.7 (so likely sometime after go1.6 release for devel). I'd say keep it split out, but fix the logic so it's inline with go1.6.\n. Thanks. This was merged as b922ec76f7137e4a33a07663f4cf8f9614e494cd.\n. Please make sure to `go fmt` the code and I'll merge.\n. This was merged in as 26e6c638845825cecd1addc3f03578c9977676bd. Thanks!\n. @shurcooL Is this satisfactory for now?\n. Probably. godep expects the packages to exist in the $GOPATH atm. If you are starting a new project you'd start with `go get <pkg>`, use it, then `godep save` to record / copy it into your godep workspace (or `vendor/`). If you are working with an existing project that uses godep, you can start with a `godep restore`, which will modify your gopath to equal the recorded/saved deps. This can be worked around somewhat by saving with rewrites (`godep save -r`), but the ultimate solution is that godep will (eventually) use what's in `vendor/`. Some of that logic already exists, but not all of it yet.\n\nDoes that help? If not, can you please describe what you are doing in more detail?\n. @kevinburkeshyp do a restore, re-save without `-r` (or -r=false) to remove any rewrites if you have them and then blow away `./Godeps`, then checkout any updated deps you want in your `$GOPATH` and then `godep save` everything again.\n. This is also an issue when a package starts importing new packages too. For instance grpc 51d644aca6b8eca07b6bd2f5ea435998bf73fa92 to fea7689493da00c4590150b3534c256a962259d3\n. Thanks for reporting this. Total oversight. ;-) Should be fixed in master (v51) and as soon as travis makes a release it will be on the releases page.\n. Hmm it may. I'll have to look into it and make a test case. Thanks for the report.\n. Thanks for the report. Will look into it.\n. I'll have to see what the vcs library generated for a url and see if that's the problem in these cases. Sorry, been working on other stuff for a bit. Hoping to get back to this later in the week or next week.\n. @MrJoy `godep save -d <other args>` should do that and a LOT more however.\n. @MrJoy Thanks for the analysis ! This is pretty much what I _thought_ is likely happening, sorry I wasn't more specific in my response.\n\nFWIW: godep uses https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/go/vcs, which I _thought_ took care of all of that. It may not though as there is a wide discrepancy between the go command line tooling and these supplemental libraries. \n\nI'll look into those libs to verify what they do and if they don't work like the go tooling will patch and PR them.\n. @MrJoy @derekdowling So the error for goji is being returned from https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/3f1f7eeff104d9ef829677f12b9780dfdd26a96a/go/vcs/vcs.go#L395, which was thrown from `RepoRootForImportDynamic` which calls `parseMetaGoImports` which looks for the `go-import` tag. So something in the golang/tools/go/vcs package is busted vs `go get` AFAICT. \n\nDigging more.\n. This is fixed in v64. It was a bug in the [vcs package](https://github.com/golang/tools/commit/157f8abbbd7c19e90432c72cb6216cf0b9324c55)\n. @cmoesel Can you share your Godeps.json file and any code? Also, what does 'find . -type d -name \"bson\"` return ?\n. I can't duplicate this, so I need more info.\n\n``` console\n$ cat main.go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n\n    \"gopkg.in/mgo.v2/bson\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    fmt.Println(bson.Binary{})\n}\n$ godep save\n$ cat Godeps/Godeps.json\n{\n    \"ImportPath\": \"github.com/freeformz/t408\",\n    \"GoVersion\": \"go1.6\",\n    \"GodepVersion\": \"v70\",\n    \"Deps\": [\n        {\n            \"ImportPath\": \"gopkg.in/mgo.v2/bson\",\n            \"Comment\": \"r2016.02.04-1-gb6e2fa3\",\n            \"Rev\": \"b6e2fa371e64216a45e61072a96d4e3859f169da\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n$ find .\n.\n./Godeps\n./Godeps/Godeps.json\n./Godeps/Readme\n./main.go\n./vendor\n./vendor/gopkg.in\n./vendor/gopkg.in/mgo.v2\n./vendor/gopkg.in/mgo.v2/bson\n./vendor/gopkg.in/mgo.v2/bson/bson.go\n./vendor/gopkg.in/mgo.v2/bson/decode.go\n./vendor/gopkg.in/mgo.v2/bson/encode.go\n./vendor/gopkg.in/mgo.v2/bson/LICENSE\n./vendor/gopkg.in/mgo.v2/LICENSE\n```\n\nAlso @russellhaering when I checkout your example repo and I run godep save on it `Godeps/_workspace/src/gopkg.in/` get's added.\n\nMaybe it was solved in the meantime?\n\n@cmoesel What version of godep are you using?\n. godep doesn't support this. It may have inadvertently done so in the past however. I'm going to keep this open though for now while I reconsider.\n. Can you try a build of godep with #418 applied and see if that fixes things?\n. @Manbeardo thanks for the update. I'll have to make a test case (even if it's manual) and figure out where else we fall down.\n. Thanks for the test & report. I'll have to investigate more and see if I can make a test case.\n. FWIW: godep (v60) no prints out a warning whenever you are NOT in the $GOPATH.\n. What version of godep are you using?\n. Also, when you say private repos, what do you mean? godep works with what's on disk already in your $GOPATH.\n. Please upgrade and try again w/o a `vendor/` or `Godeps/` directory. The current version is v52 and I remember something like this being fixed a ways back.\n. No worried. Thanks for giving it a try!\n. `godep` is designed to be run from within your $GOPATH with all of the deps also in the $GOPATH. So if you are working outside of the $GOPATH with symlinks and/or your deps are the same way `godep` may not work well for you. If you are inside of the $GOPATH though I'd really like to see if we can re-produce this to fix the issue and make a test case for it.\n. That seems like  a strange $GOPATH. Normally $GOPATH is something like `export GOPATH=$HOME/go`. And the you `cd $GOPATH/src/<project>`, where `<project>` == something like `cd $GOPATH/go/src/github.com/tools/godep; edit code; godep save`.\n. what version of godep, go, is the vendor experiment turned on or off and (based on the tree output example) I assume the project was created w the vendor experiment turned off....\n. Hmm. Nothing jumps out as off. I'm going to need the extremely large (possibly) output of `godep save -d -v <whatever other args you are using` unless you can re-produce it on a public repo.\n. Please try again with v55+ and if there is still a problem please upload a new `godep save -d -v <pkg spec>`. I fixed a few bugs and added some more debug output (which may help in this case).\n. Does `github.com/foo/bar/backend` import anything ? godep isn't detecting any imports or dependencies.\n. Thanks for trying. I don't understand what you mean by \"standard vendor support\". Are you not using a tool to maintain `vendor/`? \n. Oh, so if `backend` doesn't contain any files you need to pass `godep save` a package spec that includes all of the packages you want to have it analyze. This defaults to `.`, hence nothing is being saved to `vendor/`. Given the package structure you described, you probably want `godep save ./cmd/...`\n. Ahh okay. FWIW: godep writes to `vendor/` when go1.6 (or go1.5 + env var) is used. Sorry you had troubles. Do you think there is any way I could update godep or the docs to better convey how save is supposed to be used?\n. Please upgrade to v53 and let me know if this is still an issue.\n\nThanks!\n. Also note that this patch \"increases\" the number of listed dependencies because we're no longer doing the path prefix match in godep fill. Previously if you had something like:\n\n```\npackage A/B, imports A/B/C\npackage A/B/C\n```\n\nYou would get a dependency on `A/B` recorded and then everything (including _any_ sub dirs) of `A/B` would be copied in, including `A/B/C`. So things would work, but the recorded deps would be off (in that they didn't include all transitive deps).\n\nNow you get both dependencies recorded (`A/B` and `A/B/C`).\n. This was _okay_ in the \"workspace\" days because of the rewrites or requirement to prefix `go` tool runs with `godep`. But with `vendor/` you can just use the naked `go` tool and `./...` really should just work when everything is vendored properly. This should (barring other issues) fix that after a re-save of dependencies. \n. @phinze Yep. I was looking into why `./...` wasn't working with go install's for various go1.6 setups (with vendor) because it just should have. And that's when I noticed what seems to be previously spec'd behavior that I disagree with (copying all sub dirs of a required package).\n. @phinze checking with terraform master now to see if what godep's generates is good.\n. Once hashicorp/terraform#5248 is merged the instructions should be:\n\n``` console\n$ git checkout master\n$ godep restore\n$ git checkout <feature-branch>\n$ <edit code, add imports as necessary>\n$ godep save ./...\n$ git add -A .\n$ git commit -av\n```\n\nIf that doesn't work (except for exotic situations) then I consider it a bug.\n. Did you start out with a `godep restore` ? \n. The process I've used several times is : https://github.com/tools/godep#migrating-to-vendor \n\nThere could be bad revisions being restored though. For instance https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/5248 needed to update a google cloud library because the code was using a local version and hadn't updated the vendored version yet.\n\nCan you provide a copy of you Godeps/Godeps.json file? \n. @sunheng that's probably because you have 2 different revs recorded, which is invalid. Fix all Revs to be the same for all `code.google.com/p/google-api-go-client/googleapi` packages.\n. @gracedo Are you outside of your $GOPATH and/or using symlinks?\n. @gracedo when the above output says `<path-to-project>` what is that? \n. @gracedo what is the output of `godep version` (looking for the entire string).\n. Is your fs case sensitive or not? It's part of the output of `diskutil info /`. I wonder if there is a regression there for some reason.\n. At this point I think I either need access to the code or the full dump of `godep save -d -v  > out 2>&1` (which can be large) using v54.\n. Actually wait. I got that backwards. So it's not case sensitive. What do you get from the following 2 commands run inside of `$GOPATH/src/github.com/SocialCodeInc/advisor-notifications/` (using whichever method you normally use to cd there).\n\n`pwd`\n\n`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`\n. Hmm. then I'm not really sure what's going on w/o the dump or the ability to reproduce it. Sorry.\n. I haven't been able to. I've done this now with a bunch of projects w/o incident (aside from stuff that was otherwise inflicted). I need the `-d` switch added to that, which will add tons of info.\n. Note all of the \"skipping untracked file\" output. That's telling me that symlinks may be used somewhere.\n\nIf you go to `cd /Users/grace/code/go/src/github.com/Sirupsen/logrus` and run `git ls-files --full-name` what is the output?\n. Also what is the output of `echo $GOPATH` ?\n. And also `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` in the same place that `git ls-files --full-name` is run.\n. So here's the problem: `/Users/grace/Code/go/src/github.com/Sirupsen/logrus` vs `/Users/grace/code/go/src/github.com/Sirupsen/logrus`\n\nI added a simple check of == recently.\n\nPlease update and try with v55 (just pushed). I bet that fixes it.\n. @gracedo thanks for working through this and sorry for all of the back and forth.\n. May (partially) fix #409.\n. May (partially) fix #334 \n. We _used_ to be able to do this via `godep save github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo ./...` and use `godep go install github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo` to DTRT. But with the vendor experiment that doesn't work.\n\nWe can vendor it in the same way (`godep save github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo ./...`), but it needs to be installed a little differently:\n1. as `go install github.com/hashicorp/terraform/vendor/github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo`.\n2. `godep restore && go install github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo` (This touches the network though)\n\nSo that provides 2 possible immediate work arounds.\n\nAnother possible solution is just manually copy `github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo` into `ginkgo/ginkgo`, `godep save ./...` and install it with `go install ./ginkgo/ginkgo`. That's not fun though.\n\nSome thoughts (none of which I'm convinced are good or not):\n1. Addition of a `godep install` command which could walk through Packages from Godeps.json and install the non local packages (or all of them). So you would then run `godep install github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo` and that would shell out to `go install github.com/hashicorp/terraform/vendor/github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo`.\n2. A modifier to `godep restore` to restore directly vendored files to $GOPATH w/o hitting the network, which would then let you `go install github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo`.\n3. I could make `godep go` vendor aware and when it seems a target that it knows/thinks is in vendor it tries to DTRT and append the local package name + \"vendor/\" to the target. I'm afraid this may be fraught with errors and edge cases though.\n\nI'm open to suggestions on how to otherwise deal with this though. \n. A draw back to this is that you also need to _always_ add `github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo` to your `godep save` pkg spec. I am considering having `godep save` w/o any params just use what's in `Godeps/Godeps.json` if it exists or default to `.` (which is what it does now if you don't specify a pkg spec). Thoughts?\n. If you are using the `vendor/` experiment and have vendored an external dep like ginkgo, you can install it along with everything else via `go install ./...`. Since `./...` will consider everything (including mains) inside of `vendor/`. See hashicorp/terraform#5291 for instance.\n. There are several issues here AFAICT.\n1. github.com/drone/drone does not use godep (there is no metadata file listing the contents of vendor).\n2.  godep does not as of yet collapse / pull up all dependencies. This can lead to this problem like here.\n3. godep relies on things being in $GOPATH.\n4. I don't really understand how drone manages these dependencies as there is no Godeps/Godeps.json file, so it's impossible to do a `godep restore`, which should be done before a re-save.\n. Ahh. Thanks for the clarification.\n\nSo the biggest issue is probably because we don\u2019t pull up all deps and flatten them at the top level (yet).\n\n> On Feb 23, 2016, at 7:22 PM, Dmitri Shuralyov notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> To clarify, the codebase I was referring to (src.sourcegraph.com/sourcegraph/...) imports and uses both github.com/drone/drone/... and github.com/docker/docker/... or parts there-of.

Probably v54 as I made the godep save exact dependencies. The current resolver doesn't know about figuring out / including C dependencies. It accidentally (or on purpose depending on how you look at it) worked before hand, but you had to drop your C deps in the correct spot for it to work.\n\nCan you link me to the repo this is an issue with and/or detail your directory layout?\n. The package analyzer doesn't understand parsing cgo imports. The workaround that should work for now is to put the c code in the same directory as the package that uses it. I'm not sure if we'll ever support anything beyond that going forward either. Need to think more about it and look at more projects using cgo before making a decision.\n. @twmb godep does use go/parser when analyzing packages, but currently that all get's thrown out and isn't used during the copy process. My next steps are to not throw that data out and preserve it so that it will simplify other code (like copy) and enable things like `godep status` (and maybe even a `godep graph`).\n\n@karalabe Thanks. Agreed. I need to dig through some common libraries that use CGO to really understand the assumptions. I don't think just blindly copying over .c/.cpp/.h files anywhere below the package would be sufficient, but maybe it is?\n. FWIW sqlite-3 has moved their files around so it will no longer happen with that library after an update of that package: https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3/commit/3a5555302e9b06eb5461016462900f1412ae3f7c\n. There may be some stuff in here I can use: https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/go/loader/cgo.go\n. You save dependencies by running. `godep save <pkg spec>`, where `<pkg spec>` is the code you want to analyze for dependencies (i.e. your code). It sounds like you are running `godep save github.com\\golang\\protobuf`, which is telling godep to analyze `github.com\\golang\\protobuf` for dependencies and vendor that. \n\nDoes that help explain usage? I should probably take another pass at the README, especially give go1.6.\n. That is not the way godep is used. Godep looks at your source code and figures out what packages your code is using and vendors those packages. So something like this ...\n\n``` console\n$ cd $GOPATH/github.com/<you>/<your project>\n$ vim main.go\npackage main\n\nimport \"gopkg.in/natefinch/lumberjack.v2\"\n\nfunc main() {\n  // make a logger, use it, etc\n}\n$ godep save\n```\n\nGiven the above the `godep save` looks at the code in the current directory and discovers that `gopkg.in/natefinch/lumberjack.v2` is being used and copies `$GOPATH/src/gopkg.in/natefinch/lumberjack.v2` to `vendor/` (or `Godeps/_workspace/src/gopkg.in/natefinch/lumberjack.v2` if you are using go1.5 w/o the vendor experiment).\n\nDoes that make sense?\n. What version of godep are you using? `godep version` output ?\n. Please upgrade to v57 and see if the issue is resolved or not. \n. What version of godep (output of `godep version`)?\n. What version of godep are you using (godep version).\n. Can you attach the output of `godep save -v -d 2>&1`. it will be quite large and you may need to upload it elsewhere / provide a compressed version.\n. Godep hasn't vendored dependency's test files by default since ~v9 (9/2015). So any save that was created before v9 may have done so, but any later saves should remove them.  What version of godep are you using?\n. I also fixed a bug recently where godep was vendoring more than it should have (because of old assumptions in the code that also included any sub directories of a package). If you are using godep please update to v56+ and do the following:\n\n``` console\n$ godep restore\n$ rm -rf Godeps vendor\n$ godep save <pkg spec> \n$ git add -A .\n$ git commit -am \"re-save to remove cruft\"\n```\n\nWhere <pkg spec> is the packages you want godep to analyze, so proabably `.` (the default) or `./...`.\n. Thanks! I try to respond quickly, but can't always. So yay for finding just the right time to ask a Q. ;-) \n. Yes. It should flatten those deps out.\n. yes, we should do better there. There are also all sorts of problem related to v1 and v2 of \"a\" being used at the same time. For instance a type from v1 of \"a\" is not the same as the same type returned from v2 of \"a\". Even if they look the same. The only sane thing to do is flatten. We should ask / prompt / let the user decide which one to choose though (assuming we can't programmatically determine the best version).\n. Because there would then be 3 versions of the same dep. That can lead to confusing, unexpected and subtle errors in the program.\n. if `foo` and `bar` happen to return their own `a` types to their users they won't be equal if compared, which can lead to issues. I don't have links handy but this has been discussed a bunch in Go issues and IIRC go-nuts.\n. I have been thinking about doing this very thing for those very reasons. \n. So my main concern with this is Godep.json churn. But that's probably un-avoidable if we do want to record the version string. w/o using this version elsewhere I'm not sure this is all that useful. And I can see trying to enforce the version to add overhead to interactions with developers. But maybe that overhead is already being imposed, just in an ad-hoc way?\n. PS: I am interested in figuring this out, just thinking through the details here a little and the end goal.\n. `save` or `update` will modify Godeps.json. `godep get` just (currently, I have a notion to change this to something more useful given `vendor/`) shells out to go get with some wrapping. I'm not sure the version should be updated on `godep update` though, since it's not a total re-save, more like selective editing. So if you see a Godeps.json file that had a small modification done you can't really assume it has all of the package fixes from recent versions for instance.\n\nI don't know if that's enough to re-consider this or not.\n\nI guess looking at the git history and the comments would probably tell you enough though about what was done?\n. Err Sorry. I meant the commit log with the version numbers and comments like \"Updated github.com/foo/bar\" would tell you.\n. Thanks!\n. Sorry it took so long to answer this Q. It got lost in email :-(\n\nIt probably has less to do with `.` than with godep being explicit about which packages it is importing. Previously godep would only note the top level package and would also copy in all sub packages and directories, even if they **aren't** being used. This causes a bunch of problems when using `./...` with the go1.5+ vendor experiment as the go tool's use of `./...` includes **everything** in vendor.\n\nThis change happened in v54: https://github.com/tools/godep/blob/master/Changelog.md#v54-20160222\n. Yes, it's expected as godep is more specific wrt what it records as being used. Before it was kind of loose. I don't think it's related to `.` (`.` isn't treated specially by godep), it's just that those packages actually import sub packages that are properly part of your dependencies. \n. What version of godep are you using?\nWere you in your project's root directory in your $GOPATH?\nWhat options did you pass to 'godep save'?\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\n> On Mar 10, 2016, at 19:10, WanliTian notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> hi, all\n> there are items about subpackages under golang.org within godeps.json\n> but i cannot find any packages in vendor dir.\n> \n> go 1.6\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. @WanliTian And the other things I asked about?\n.

Thank you, that will help tremendously. \n. @Sironfoot Your home directory is symlinked into your Dropbox folder? \nWhat is your version of godep (`godep version`). If you are not on v57+, please upgrade (`go get -u github.com/tools/godep`) and try again, providing any log (if it's different).\n\nAlso, what is your `echo $GOPATH` and `pwd` when you run `godep save` and ends up in the loop. \n. AFAICT your home directory is in dropbox, and it looks symlinked to /Users. What is the output of `echo $HOME`?.\n. Yes. godep uses path based case-insensitive file system path matches. So when you are on your desktop, somehow when you open a terminal to run godep you aren't actually in your $GOPATH (`/Users/sironfoot/Dropbox (Personal)/Development/Tutorials/gocode`), you are instead in `/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/sironfoot/Dropbox (Personal)/Development/Tutorials/gocode/src/dominic/godep-test`. Do you use a context menu in Finder to open a terminal? Or some other method? Basically, how did you get to `/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/sironfoot/Dropbox (Personal)/Development/Tutorials/gocode/src/dominic/godep-test` instead of  `/Users/sironfoot/Dropbox (Personal)/Development/Tutorials/gocode/src/dominic/godep-test`\n. changing your $GOPATH to `/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/sironfoot/Dropbox (Personal)/Development/Tutorials/gocode` should solve the problem. I'm somewhat surprised all of the go tools work as well. I _do_ need to track down why some symlink stuff works and some doesn't though.\n. There is no need to use 'godep go' with the vendor experiment (go1.6 and go1.5 with env var set).

Godep looks directly at the environment AND go version. If a `./Godeps/_workspace` exists though it keeps using it and disables the vendor experiment (and warns you about that). Here is the code it uses to determine this: https://github.com/tools/godep/blob/a62a9149e4443308c1574383a5e2b713088e5c58/main.go#L69-L88\n\nPlease see this if you are looking to move an existing Godeps workspace to vendor: https://github.com/tools/godep#migrating-to-vendor\n. @didip I don't really consider #377 a bug per se, at least not as it's stated.

Can you push a repo that I can use to reproduce this?\n\nIf you run `godep save` do you get any warning about being outside of the $GOPATH? `go` prepends stuff with _ when you are working outside of the $GOPATH (AFAICT).\n. godep does not work with relative imports and they are generally frowned upon toy code.

I need to see about constructing a test case for this, but the above 3 commands are what I have used to ensure everything is as clean as can be.\n. It's probably an invalid go file, likely a temporary editor file. Godep should skip parsing files that start with '.' and it should return parsing errors to the user.

Nested vendor folders only lead to problems in the long run. Most tools un-nest them. godep is a little naive in the way it handles that, but the end result is the same.\n. @donhcd Aa(B.Btype) can't be called because it's really A/vendor/B.Btype. Also what happens when you use a B and the project vendors a different B and then returns something of it's B.BType? Your projects B.Btype != A/vendor/B.Btype.\n\nAnd what if A requires a database/sql driver an you go to use the same driver? You'll get a panic.\n\nre vendor inside of internal packages. It doesn't solve all the problems and IMO I don't think we should ever vendor anything inside of internal packages.\n. @roylou packages that are libraries should not lock their dependencies to a specific version, but need to specify ranges that are known to work. There are several attempts in go land to implement this in the different tools and I'm waiting to see what people adopt. My favorite ATM is what dave chenney is doing with GB's depfile https://github.com/constabulary/gb/tree/master/depfile\n. godep's goal is to produce a single, top level vendor folder. See the convo in #444 as to why.\n. @galeone See #451, which was merged as v61.\n. Hmm. 'fmt' is a stdlib package and should be easily found. Is your go install special in any way?

Can your provide a link to a copy of the output from `godep save -d -v <pkg spec> >log 2>&1` ? The output may be huge, so it may not attach here.\n. @stroborobo `go get` obeys local arch. Since code can be deployed to different architectures godep looks at all dependencies. So when you `godep save` cross arch deps may be missing. I'm not sure what the best solution to that is.\n. @stroborobo my comment was wrt third party packages, not the stdlib. godep relies on the $GOPATH reguardless of installation method. As I mentioned above I wasn't able to replicate this with the \"same install\", meaning I removed my own godep / go and installed them via homebrew. Furthermore I was trying to clarify how godep analyzes packages. It always relies on $GOPATH, but can pull in extra transitive deps across architectures vs. `go get`. This is important if you develop on OSX, but deploy to Linux, which is a very common case.\n. If $GOPATH/github.com/stroborobo/myfmt isn't there then you will get not found because the package isn't in $GOPATH. The way godep currently works is that to update / save deps the packages need to be in the $GOPATH, even if they are already saved. This is for various reasons.\n\nRe: `go get`. Yes and No. Yes, in that `go get` fetches all the source code for your current os/architecture. No, in that the same code can require additional transitive dependencies on different os/architectures. I'm not sure if that's what happened here, but it's likely.\n. @stroborobo Maybe I should treat it as a bug. \n. @hadv context is part of go1.7 and therefore requires tip or a go1.7 build.\n. @hadv what version of godep are you using? I added support for handling go version build tags a few months ago, so this should work if the lib you are importing is conditionally importing context behind a build flag (unless your godep version is old). \n\nOtherwise the package you are using is just blankly importing context no matter of go version and the package needs to be fixed.\n. @Gnouc does anything use it transitively ? \n@jingweno I can't replicate, can you provide a step by step reproducer using go1.7rc3 and a clean gopath?\n@tejasmanohar This issue talks about several different problems AFAICT, can you be more specific?\n.

It does, but you should consider migrating to [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) or [govendor](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor) instead.. What version of godep? Versions of godep (circa v41+, I would need to check the changelog for the specific version) process all .go files, except for those with \"ignore\" and \"appengine\" build tags. Adding go version build tags shouldn't be that hard since we also store the major go version in the Godeps.json file though.\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\n> On Apr 5, 2016, at 10:17, Cannibal Vox notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> It's worse than that- deleting go17.go wont' help because it actually refused to read pre_go17.go.

Looks like go1.7 includes a package named \"context\" and if you are not on 1.7 (really devel) then godep can't find the package because you don't actually have it.\n. Can anyone test out the branch that I pushed for this (See #451) ? I tested it here, but it's late and I don't want to merge it before reviewing it in the morning (and/or getting other +1s).\n. Thanks everyone, this should now be fixed.\n. Closing in favor of #451 for now.\n\nThanks for taking the time to take a stab at this though.\n. Merged as 35ee059b4e6c3df99fb6afc2d3b0f0790b22e1c1\n. Ugh. I'm not sure how to ask the `go` command if it's go1.7 or not while it's in \"devel\" mode.\n. I could at this point just assume that anything that reports \"devel\" is go1.7 though.\n. The go tool uses a build.Context.ReleaseTags slice and `go1.7` has been added in devel. To take a \"guess\" at this I could compile/run this code with the current `go` version and take the left most element of the array. This is likely to work, until the go team changes the order of this slice for any random reason.\n\n``` go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n  \"fmt\"\n  \"go/build\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n  fmt.Println(build.Default.ReleaseTags[len(build.Default.ReleaseTags)-1])\n}\n```\n\nThat's super fragile, but so is having to say deal with what the definition of \"devel\" is.\n\nThoughts?\n. I could also parse the date returned by version in the devel case and hard code in the dates the tree was opened. This may then break every major cycle though.\n. Longer term, yes, by removing the need to `godep restore`. A go tooling change recently (go1.6) made this a problem AFAIK.\n. PS: godep restore is doing what it's always done, restore the recorded versions to the $GOPATH. it can only do this by checking out the various shas (AFAIK) it's recorded.\n\nAs a temp work around I could implement a `godep unrestore`, which would check out master again. But I'm hesitant to add another command that should be removed in the future and I'm not sure it's super helpful in the workflow ... ie. you have to remember to use it.\n\nThoughts?\n. PRs welcome. I don't have an exact commit to golang where this broke. Let me see if I can dig it up though.\n. It was likely this one: https://github.com/golang/go/commit/42206598671a44111c8f726ad33dc7b265bdf669\n. @Raffo What would you suggest be added to the README? It states what `godep restore` already does in a non VCS specific manner, since godep handles multiple types of VCS.\n. How about\n\n**NOTE**: godep restore leaves git repositories in a detached state. `go1.6`\\+ no longer checks out the master branch when doing a `go get`, see [here](https://github.com/golang/go/commit/42206598671a44111c8f726ad33dc7b265bdf669).\n\nThen if you land an `unrestore` PR we can adjust that to recommend the usage of `unrestore` afterwards?\n. @Raffo README / restore help text updated in 584a3f5bf2671886bd3f7dc2b252762b5aa2a087\n. Why does the remote branch matter? I don't think we want to pull new code with unrestore, just check out the local master.\n. It only matters what it's merged to locally AFAIK, so `git config --local branch.master.merge` should tell us what to checkout. \n\nI could totally be wrong here, I don't think I've ever worked with remotes who HEAD was not `master`.\n. I see. If there is only one branch returned from `git config --local --get-regexp 'branch.*'` we could check that out and otherwise punt with instructions to the user to start?\n. I'm not sure I really want to require people to populate that field manually. Also AFAICT RemoteHEAD is detectable through either:\n\n``` console\n$ git remote show origin\n...\nHEAD branch: develop\n...\n```\n\nor\n\n``` console\n$ git branch -r | grep \"origin/HEAD ->\"\n  origin/HEAD -> origin/develop\n```\n\npossibly some other means as well.\n. I'm not sure we should save RemoteHEAD though and just honor the remote head from git info for what's already there.\n. `godep save` takes package paths or files as you point out. It analyzes the package(s) you point it to and determines what dependencies are required based on what is in your $GOPATH. I plan to enhance `godep get <pkg>` to just vendor <pkg> into `vendor/`.\n\nThis along with some other future enhancements should go a long way to removing the need for godep restore, which I also plan to remove.\n. Not really.I really suggest people look into using [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) or [govendor](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor) instead of godep.. It does, although it's a little janky and doesn't work well with the vendor experiment. We use it internally @ Heroku.\n\n`godep save ./... github.com/mattes/migrate` saves both local deps and the main that is `github.com/mattes/migrate`.\n\nJanky parts:\n1. You need to _always_ save both of those.\n2. It doesn't work well with `vendor/` in that you can't then `go install github.com/mattes/migrate`. You have to prefix your local project's package name to it + vendor like so `go install github,com/heroku/project/vendor/github.com/mattes/migrate`. This is a limitation of how the `vendor/` experiment works. If you are using old style godep workspaces then it's simply `godep go install github.com/mattes/migrate`.\n\nDoes that help?\n. Thanks!\n. I assume you resolved the issue?\n. I'll have to see if I can duplicate this with a test. Thanks for the report.\n. @robsix Can you give steps to reproduce?\n. Oops, linked wrong issue.\n. What are the contents of `/Users/aaron/documents/gowork/src/github.com/Throckmortra/ryp` ? What is your `$GOPATH`?\n. Also, does `go install -v .` run / work / install anything?\n. According to the output, godep didn't find any valid go files in `.` (GoFiles is nil)\n. So you either have invalid go files in `.` (syntax error maybe?) or you need to specificy `./...` when you save. \n. v62 was just a doc update.\n. Your $GOPATH is `/Users/aaron/Documents/gowork` and you are in `/Users/aaron/documents/gowork`. So there is still some case related isuses apparently.\n. Hmm. Thanks for the report. I'll have to figure out a way to test this better. I don't think Travis CI has the option for case insensitive filesystems though.\n. Where did you git clone the package to?\n. I believe this ping is part of the golang.org/x/tools/go/vcs package which godep uses.\n. It looks like you have a newer version of golang.org/x/net in your GOPATH. Since godep works off what's in the GOPATH you need to 'godep restore' before saving new deps or this can happen. I'd like to get away from having to do that, but I'm not sure the right UI for it.\n\nThe error / help text should be clearer as well.\n\nThanks for the report.\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\n> On May 5, 2016, at 15:10, Jeff Hodges notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> With godep version: godep v63 (darwin/amd64/go1.6.2)\n> \n> I added some code that added go grpc to my repository (and so, golang.org/x/net/http2 was added).\n> \n> But then godep save failed and the godep update it told me that there was nothing for it to do:\n> \n> $  godep save ./go/...\n> godep: cannot save golang.org/x/net/http2 at revision 7e42c0e1329bb108f7376a7618a2871ab90f1c4d: already have golang.org/x/net/context at revision 35ec611a141ee705590b9eb64d673f9e6dfeb1ac.\n> Run `godep update golang.org/x/net/context' first.\n> $  godep update golang.org/x/net/context\n>  godep: no packages can be updated\n> Here's a quick grep of my Godeps.json:\n> \n> $  cat Godeps/Godeps.json  | grep -A 1 'x/net'\n>             \"ImportPath\": \"golang.org/x/net/context\",\n> \n> ##             \"Rev\": \"35ec611a141ee705590b9eb64d673f9e6dfeb1ac\"\n> \n> ```\n>         \"ImportPath\": \"golang.org/x/net/context/ctxhttp\",\n>         \"Rev\": \"35ec611a141ee705590b9eb64d673f9e6dfeb1ac\"\n> ```\n> \n> ## \n> \n> ```\n>         \"ImportPath\": \"golang.org/x/net/html\",\n>         \"Rev\": \"35ec611a141ee705590b9eb64d673f9e6dfeb1ac\"\n> ```\n> \n> ## \n> \n> ```\n>         \"ImportPath\": \"golang.org/x/net/html/atom\",\n>         \"Rev\": \"35ec611a141ee705590b9eb64d673f9e6dfeb1ac\"\n> ```\n> \n> Running go get -u -a golang.org/x/net/... per a comment in #335 and trying save and update again changed nothing.\n> \n> \u2014\n> You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n. I am in the middle of [rewritting](https://github.com/tools/godep/pull/462) update, so let's see if I can also tackle some of this ...\n\nI'm not sure what you mean wrt \"recording the path\". I'm not familiar with gvt, so I'll have to play with it. FWIW: Go packages are path based already. There is code in godep to figure out the root repo for a given package, so godep already has that info. It's just the way things are stringed together right now is sub optimal.\n\nBefore you did a `go get -u -a` did you do a `godep restore`?\n\nBasically I'm trying to figure out a starting state to replicate this issue.\n. PS: Thanks for the report. ;-) \n. Yeah. that's why you need to `godep restore` before saving new deps and/or updating deps. Basically the workflow (both fortunately and unfortunately) is:\n\n``` console\n$ godep restore\n$ cd $GOPATH/src/<package you want to update>\n$ git checkout master\n$ git pull origin master (or checkout whatever you want to update to)\n$ cd $GOPATH/src/<package I am working on>\n$ godep update <package you want to update>/... (most likely need the /... atm)\n```\n\nAnd yes, that kinda sucks.\n\nI am thinking of side-stepping this with a `godep get <package>[@<version/sha>` command, which would just pull the package directly into `vendor/` (or the workspace), including deps. It <version/sha> would default to `origin/HEAD` unless specified. There is already a `godep get`, but it's a small, almost useless wrapper around `go get`.\n\nThoughts?\n. This is because of this: https://github.com/golang/go/commit/42206598671a44111c8f726ad33dc7b265bdf669\n\nThis doesn't \"fix\" anything for non godep users, just allows godep restore to work properly.\n. This came up in #453\n. The workflow for godep update is to first `godep restore`, then checkout the version of the package you want to update to, then update.\n. I agree. I thought there was a test for this, but maybe not. \n\nSent from my iPhone\n\n> On May 12, 2016, at 08:58, Amir Abu Shareb notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> I see, is there a workaround at all?\n> \n> Seems to me that godep <pkg> should update a single package and it's dependencies and not error if another package does not exists, is there a reason for this workflow that i'm missing?\n> \n> Would love to work on a fix if you're interested :)\n> \n> \u2014\n> You are receiving this because you commented.\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n. `godep` and `go get` can't work the same way. `go get` only pulls dependencies for the current architecture. `godep` needs to get all dependencies, across all OS, so that when a developer is working on OS Y the code can be deployed to OS Z. This is pretty common (I for one do most development on OSX, but most deployments to Linux).\n\nI do plan to add a field to Godeps.json to either blacklist or whitelist OS / build tags, but that is not done yet.\n. `go get` will also fetch any missing dependencies required to build packageX. This is the same as godep. `godep` will only scan dependencies for packages required by the package spec provided to `godep save`.\n\nWhat version of godep are you using? Older versions of godep were more \"liberal\".\n. ``` console\n$ cd ~/go/src/github.com\n$ mkdir jmhodges\n$ cd jmhodges\n$ git clone https://github.com/jmhodges/howsmyssl.git\nCloning into 'howsmyssl'...\nremote: Counting objects: 1283, done.\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (61/61), done.\nremote: Total 1283 (delta 28), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 1216\nReceiving objects: 100% (1283/1283), 800.82 KiB | 324.00 KiB/s, done.\nResolving deltas: 100% (727/727), done.\nChecking connectivity... done.\n$ cd howsmyssl\n$ ls\nDockerfile                            allow_test.go                         howsmyssl-gcloud-credentials.json.enc static\nLICENSE                               client_info.go                        howsmyssl.go                          templates\nREADME.md                             config                                index_test.go                         tls\nall_suites.go                         conn.go                               insecure_suites.go                    travis_docker_push.sh\nallow.go                              gzip                                  stat_writer.go                        vendor\n$ git checkout test_allow\nBranch test_allow set up to track remote branch test_allow from origin.\nSwitched to a new branch 'test_allow'\n$ go get -u golang.org/x/net/publicsuffix\n$ godep save ./...\n$ cat Godeps/Godeps.json\n{\n    \"ImportPath\": \"github.com/jmhodges/howsmyssl\",\n    \"GoVersion\": \"devel-8f48efb\",\n    \"GodepVersion\": \"v67\",\n    \"Packages\": [\n        \"./...\"\n    ],\n    \"Deps\": [\n        {\n            \"ImportPath\": \"golang.org/x/net/publicsuffix\",\n            \"Rev\": \"ef00b378c73f107bf44d5c9b69875255ce89b79a\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nInterestingly `golang.org/x/net/publicsuffix` isn't in vendor though. \n\nLooking more into why that is.\n.

This needs to be fixed in the same way it was fixed for git. Resolving the symlink isn't acceptable. If mercurial is resolving the symlink then we need to change the behavior of mercurial to provide a path w/o resolving the symlinks for us. See also: https://github.com/tools/godep/commit/446e2f61cbc0bfa616de9b4b0cf6271945704a77\n. ditto and mercurial is horribly untested inside of godep. ;-) I'll see if I can take a look later.\n. You can (and arguably should) do those change in a branch and commit them. `git checkout {{commit}}` would then work. Why not modify your vendored copy?\n. I'd much rather do this by making [this](https://github.com/tools/godep/blob/master/list.go#L22) configurable via an array in Godps.json. Plus ensure that our code handles all the various permutations of build tags. And maybe default to what is hard coded now.\n. When a repo is git pushed to remote that has no source, how will that remote build the source w/o hitting the network?\n. If you are looking for that feature, please see [govendor](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor/blob/master/doc/faq.md#q-how-do-i-prevent-vendor-source-from-being-checked-in). PS: If you migrate to govendor, please don't use it's migrate command. I suggest instead doing:\n\n``` console\n$ godep restore\n$ rm -rf Godeps vendor\n$ govendor init\n$ govendor add +ex\n```\n. @cleung2010 `godep restore` doesn't use the contents of `vendor/` it's sole job is to fetch what is described in `Godeps.json` into `$GOPATH`. \n. @cleung2010 Great! FWIW: My recommendation would be [govendor](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor).\n. godep save looks at existing code to determine what packages should be saved and then copies those packages from your $GOPATH into a vendor directory. It's telling you that those packages aren't available in $GOPATH. `godep save` does not download any missing dependencies. Maybe a switch to do so would be useful? \n. This is because github.com/hpcloud/tail vendors a a version of gopkg.in/fsnotify.v1 that doesn't import golang.org/x/sys/unix. But godep flattens vendor folders and pulls up the dependency, so that there is only a single top level vendor directory. This required a version of gopkg.in/fsnotify.v1 be installed in the $GOPATH. The version vendored in hpcloud/tail is \"7be54206639f256967dd82fa767397ba5f8f48f5\" (1.2.1), while the version vendored in node-problem-detector is \"30411dbcefb7a1da7e84f75530ad3abe4011b4f8\".\n. At some point godep should start taking a look at the versions of vendored deps and throwing an error if they (a) conflict or (b) what it would copy would be different.\n. Thanks for the report!\n\nI don't think there is a test for that. I'll check and add one if there isn't and see if I can get it passing.\n\nThe easiest way to do this atm is:\n\n``` console\n$ godep restore -v\n$ rm -rf Godeps vendor\n$ godep save <pkg spec>\n$ git commit -av\n```\n\nThe `restore` downloads and checks out your project's deps into $GOPATH. This makes it so that when you save again you get the same version of the deps re-saved. Anything that is no longer necessary won't be saved. Also any new tweaks to the save process are applied if you are using the latest godep (perms, stricter package matching, etc). I suggest upgrading to the latest version of godep before doing any of this.\n. It is indeed. Thanks!\n. I'll likely add an \"origin\" field to each dep instead. That's probably not the _best_ for your use case, but probably more generally applicable. Thoughts on that?\n. Thanks!\n. Would an \"origin\" field referencing the full path to a different repo location be acceptable (this is what vendor.json does)? \n\nSo you would have something like this to \"alias\" the package `github.com/heroku/slog` from the location `github.com/freeformz/slog`.\n\n``` json\n...\n\"Deps\": [\n  {\n    \"ImportPath\": \"github.com/heroku/slog\",\n    \"Origin\": \"github.com/freeformz/slog\",\n    \"Rev\": \"abcdefg\"\n  }\n]\n...\n```\n\nrestore would also have to add the other remote somehow and also fetch from there. Maybe it's okay to punt on that though to start?\n. I'm not actively maintaining godep anymore. I should update the README to reflect that. I suggest taking a look at [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) instead.. I can't duplicate this.\n\n``` console\n$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/freeformz/t485\n$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/freeformz/t485\n$ echo 'package main\n\nimport (\n        \"fmt\"\n\n        \"golang.org/x/crypto/ssh\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n        fmt.Println(ssh.Permissions{})\n}' > main.go\n$ godep save\n$ cat Godeps/Godeps.json\n{\n    \"ImportPath\": \"github.com/freeformz/t485\",\n    \"GoVersion\": \"go1.7\",\n    \"GodepVersion\": \"v74\",\n    \"Deps\": [\n        {\n            \"ImportPath\": \"golang.org/x/crypto/curve25519\",\n            \"Rev\": \"c197bcf24cde29d3f73c7b4ac6fd41f4384e8af6\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"ImportPath\": \"golang.org/x/crypto/ssh\",\n            \"Rev\": \"c197bcf24cde29d3f73c7b4ac6fd41f4384e8af6\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n$ find vendor\nvendor\nvendor/golang.org\nvendor/golang.org/x\nvendor/golang.org/x/crypto\nvendor/golang.org/x/crypto/curve25519\nvendor/golang.org/x/crypto/curve25519/const_amd64.s\nvendor/golang.org/x/crypto/curve25519/cswap_amd64.s\nvendor/golang.org/x/crypto/curve25519/curve25519.go\nvendor/golang.org/x/crypto/curve25519/doc.go\nvendor/golang.org/x/crypto/curve25519/freeze_amd64.s\nvendor/golang.org/x/crypto/curve25519/ladderstep_amd64.s\nvendor/golang.org/x/crypto/curve25519/mont25519_amd64.go\nvendor/golang.org/x/crypto/curve25519/mul_amd64.s\nvendor/golang.org/x/crypto/curve25519/square_amd64.s\nvendor/golang.org/x/crypto/LICENSE\nvendor/golang.org/x/crypto/PATENTS\nvendor/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh\nvendor/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/buffer.go\nvendor/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/certs.go\nvendor/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/channel.go\nvendor/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/cipher.go\nvendor/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/client.go\nvendor/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/client_auth.go\nvendor/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/common.go\nvendor/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/connection.go\nvendor/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/doc.go\nvendor/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/handshake.go\nvendor/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/kex.go\nvendor/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/keys.go\nvendor/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/mac.go\nvendor/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/messages.go\nvendor/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/mux.go\nvendor/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/server.go\nvendor/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/session.go\nvendor/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/tcpip.go\nvendor/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/transport.go\n```\n\nIf you can reliably reproduce locally, please add `-v -d` to you commands, save the output and upload it somewhere I can inspect it.\n.

What does your Godeps.json file look like ?\n. I can't reproduce this. When I require \"github.com/prometheus/common/expfmt\" and godep save I get \"github.com/prometheus/common/internal/bitbucket.org/ww/goautoneg\" vendored. Can you explain which dep requires this? Is it vendored there? Do you have the same version vendored there on your GOPATH?\n. If you ran `go get github.com/tools/godep`, is $GOPATH/bin in your $PATH ? Sounds like it isn't.\n. They are using the older style Godep workspace w/o rewrites, so run `godep restore` before running any go commands (or use `godep go <cmd>`).\n. godep just shells out to git. Are you sure that git is working because of .netrc or cached stuff in a local .git?\n. I'll have to setup a bitbucket private repo to rest this out, will probably take a bit because @ Gophercon.\n. In the meantime, could you provide the complete output of -d ?\n. So this is the problem: https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/go/vcs/vcs.go#L668 The golang/tools/vcs stuff that godep uses doesn't use .netrc at all. I wonder if they would accept a patch to support .netrc. That's probably unlikely. Of course the go tooling doesn't work the same way either. :-( \n. See also: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/16315\n. BTW: You should not need to `go get` or `godep restore` any vendored deps (assuming the use of `vendor/`) before running `go install`. If you do, there is a problem somewhere.\n. So I would recommend removing the following lines:\n\n``` console\nRUN go get github.com/segmentio/go-loggly # Dependency from the logging app\nRUN go get bitbucket.org/frobl/logging # Use go get here\n```\n\nand changing the last run line to\n\n``` console\nRUN go install\n```\n\nThis assumes using `vendor/``\n. It is there for historic purposes (people using workspaces) and a few different advanced uses. The only thing `godep restore` does is to make the packages in your $GOPATH reflect what is in Godeps.json. Since those packages are already in `vendor/` and the go tool supports vendoring (go 1.5+), there is no `godep restore` required as the required code is already in `vendor/`.\n. Does this help? https://github.com/tools/godep/blob/master/FAQ.md#should-i-use-godep-restore\n. I also edited the readme around restore a little as well.\n. Looks legit to me. ;-) \n. This is confirmed and strange. I am out most of today through monday though.\n. My next step is to `godep save -v -d ./... &> log` and walk through the log to see why this is happening.\n. I am really not sure what is going on here. I will have to look deeper when I get back from vacation on tuesday. Your existing work around LGTM for now. Sorry.\n. No, this is a bug.\n\nOn Wed, Aug 10, 2016 at 1:24 AM David Mohl notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> I am also not sure whether this is normal beahvior or a bug.

Blinly checking out master isn't a good thing, but probably works in the 90% case. I'd argue that the appropriate place to fix this is to have `go get` determine the remote head and check that out when not already on that branch when doing a `go get -u`.  godep already has logic to do that because it needs to check out the correct default head when updating to ensure the correct sha is present.\n\nAlso my goal, although I don't know if I'll ever get to it, is to remove the need to ever godep restore.\n\nThoughts?\n. This PR changes much more than that though. Please remove the other changes or describe why they were necessary.\n. I don't know the history. Tool late to change now really.

They are probably additional transitive deps that godep picks up that go\nbuild does not consider because godep includes all deps across all build\ntags. This is so that people can develop on one OS and build on another. I\nwould suggest giving `govendor` a try, which has an additional `ignore`\nfield in it's vendor.json file that can tweak this.

Re: maintenance mode, throw up some PRs. ;-) . Thanks!. Godep ignores build tags (except [ignore and appengine](https://github.com/tools/godep/blob/master/list.go#L22)), so I'm not sure why this is happening.. With that said, I was able to [reproduce](https://github.com/freeformz/godeptags) this. :-( . Ugh. I did. I really need to write a `make release`.\r\n\r\nThanks!. Yeah. sorry, although I won't promise to not do that again. IMO tags are mutable and should be treated as such, although I do agree that doing so should be discouraged.. It may be huge, but can you provide the output of `godep save -d -v ./... &> output` ?. It looks like the change to stop using build.ImportDir in the code that handles './...' and the like is returning stuff above the current directory. There probably aren't tests for that specific issue, but I expected the existing tests to cover them. I'll have to dig more to figure out why.. Fixed. Sorry about that. [Silly](https://github.com/tools/godep/commit/f15f6db5da33a4ac48be83e20b9dd838e14f117b) mistake. :-(. Something is likely wrong with your go install as this is just calling a stdlib function of the log package.. This is by design. godep only records go packages and any license files it can find.\r\n\r\nPossible work arounds:\r\n\r\n1. Make `dict` and `deps` (or their sub directories) actual go packages and have `gojieba` _ import them and they will be picked up.\r\n1. Use a tool such as [go-bindata](https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata) to embed the info into a go package as binary data. There are tools other than go-bindata as well.. This seems wrong to me on BlueMix's part.\r\n\r\nThe ImportPath recorded is the package name of the project you are saving dependencies for. If you send the code to them and they use the app name as the package name then code that uses sub packages will break as the names are different. For instance, your application is located in the package named `github.com/olliephillips/test`, which is stored in `$GOPATH/src/github.com/olliephillips/test`. Let's say `github.com/olliephillips/test` imports `github.com/olliephillips/test/lib/stuff` but Bluemix actually puts the code in `$GOPATH/src/gohelloworld` when it's compiling the software. The import will break unless BlueMix also looks through your code and fixes up imports. And even then, panics, traces and error messages will also be changed.\r\n\r\nMaybe Bluemix is doing something different, IDK, but this seems strange to me.\r\n\r\nPS: This isn't really a bug with godep, so I'm going to close this, sorry. If Bluemix support would like to weigh in please have them re-open this issue. Thx.. That's not a valid Godeps.json file because the package specified is not a valid go package declaration because it (a) contains no valid *.go files and (b) the packages contained there are actually `golang.org/x/tools`. So if the file is changed to:\r\n\r\n```go\r\n{\r\n  \"ImportPath\": \"github.com/tools/godep\",\r\n  \"GoVersion\": \"go1.7\",\r\n  \"Deps\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"ImportPath\": \"golang.org/x/tools/cover\",\r\n      \"Rev\": \"3fe2afc9e626f32e91aff6eddb78b14743446865\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`godep restore` works properly because the correct namespace for the code is `golang.org/x/tools` and `golang.org/x/tools/cover` is an actual go package.\r\n\r\nPS: This may have worked in previous versions of godep, but that was purely by accident.. I'm going to close this as it's pretty broad and I think a little outdated. As these things come up again (if they do) I'll open new issues/PRs.\n. I don't think this is still an issue. Closing for now. Please re-open if it is and I am wrong. Thanks!\n. For now you should rewrite your deps so that you only need to use godep when managing dependencies. Long term it's likely the need to rewrite will go away pending the [vendoring experiment](https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/10923/).\n. I am closing this because it's no longer possible to use -copy=false (since 754ee6f4e0e5fc8d0ef2692fb239d15c7a09dd84). \n. `godep version` now works and prints a version.\nGodep is likely (but not finally) going to use https://github.com/kardianos/vendor-spec as per #270.\n\nSo I'm going to close this. Please re-open and update if I'm wrong.\n\nThanks!.\n. What version of godep are you using?\n\nI\u2019ll also see if I can reproduce this.\n\n> On Mar 14, 2016, at 4:57 PM, Alex Dadgar notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> I am also getting this when trying to update:\n> godep update github.com/hashicorp/go-getter\n> godep: no buildable Go source files in /Users/adadgar/Projects/go/src/github.com/StackExchange/wmi\n> godep: error loading dependencies\n> \n> I have a project that has different imports depending on OS and the above is only used on windows.

Please not that you probably want to use `godep update github.com/hashicorp/go-getter/...` atm because of a bug in the update code.\n. @dadgar did you run `godep update github.com/hashicorp/go-getter/...` And is `github.com/hashicorp/go-getter` anywhere in your Godeps.json file?\n. @dadgar godep is platform agnostic. the go tool isn't atm, so it will not pull down all possible deps for a package, only the ones the local arch needs to build. Godep will find all deps across all arches as it ignores build tags (except for ignore and appengine) atm.\n. #108 is merged and may fix this.\n. I believe this is now fixed. If not please re-open.\n. For the purposes of cleanup I'm going to close this as it's obvious that we're not going to merge it as is. If someone would like to re-open this issue with an up-to-date PR (perhaps with a different implementation) I'd be happy to review and consider/discuss inclusion.\n\nThanks!\n. @kr How about we remove `restore` at this point?\n. +1 and that is in line with the official Go team stance as well. With that said I'm going to close this issue. \n\nThanks everyone for the discussion.\n. There's no real way to accomplish this AFAIK in go land w/o going down the `gb` path.\n\nA `godep status` or `godep list` command to ensure everything in use is probably the best that can be done for now. I'm going to close this in favor of: #273\n. This is possible by specifying the path to the full vendored package, so something like:\n\n``` console\n$ go install -v github.com/my/project/Godeps/_workspace/src/github.com/your/project/cmd/thing\nor\n$ go install -v github.com/my/project/vendor/github.com/your/project/cmd/thing\n```\n\nworks properly (AFAIKCT) with rewriting or the vendor experiment.\n. Every time I've tracked these things down in the past it was because of the go tool using the wrong cached package file from outside. rewrites and/or vendor directory solve this AFAIK, so those should be used instead. Closing for now. If I'm way off base and/or we can reproduce with go 1.5\\* and current godep please re-open. Thanks!\n. atm as long as the imported package has files with build tags that include it on the local machine (a file with `// +build heroku` and a different file with `// +build !heroku`) both files will be included (assuming they are both committed to vcs). Ultimately we want to vendor everything regardless of tags so that code is buildable in multiple environments. See #271. I'm closing this for now in favor of that issue.\n. For those of you having this problem:\n\n1) is it with golang switch to golang.org/x / github? If so you will likely need to update your deps in a brute source kinda way as per @bhcleek 's suggetions. I recently had to do something similar for https://github.com/sclasen/swfsm/pull/60\n\n2) Can you provide a repeatable test case?\n. Travis shouldn't do that as that's an implementation detail of godep and may break in the future.\n. @pdxjohnny This works fine for me:\n\n``` console\n$ go get -u go get -u github.com/authit/crypto\n$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/authit/crypto\n$ godep restore\n```\n\nI would try nuking `$GOPATH/src/github.com/spf13/cobra` and try `godep restore` again.\n\nBTW: `godep restore` isn't really necessary unless you don't want to wrap your `go` commands with `godep`. I would also encourage the authors of the package to rewrite their deps.\n. @gngeorgiev godep works under the assumption that all packages are in a VCS controlled repository. That repository doesn't actually have to be pushed anywhere else though.\n\nI personally put all code into a VCS (almost always git), even if it's ever just local.\n. godep uses the go tooling for various bits and they mostly require the code to be in VCS, organized in certain ways.\n. @tchap what version of godep do you have? If it's not `v2` or the command isn't recognized, please `go get -u github.com/tools/godep` and try again.\n. @tchap can you paste the full output?\n. This works this way...\n\n``` console\n$ cd <path to blablabla>/workspace/src\n$ GOPATH=\"$(dirname $(dirname $(dirname $(pwd)))):$GOPATH\" godep save\n```\n\nThat above works for me in a trivial test case.\n. @kamal-github Please open a new issue describing the problem and don't comment on an old issue.. Godep no longer works this way and we make the following assumptions:\n1. godep save was used and the `_workspace` was committed to git.\n2. If the dependencies **were** saved with the `-r` flag, the `go` tool itself w/o needing to modify `$GOPATH` or wrapping commands with `godep` can be used to `go install` the project. This is the recommended way to use `godep` and you will have the least amount of problems using it this way.\n3. If the dependencies were **NOT** saved with the `-r` flag, then **one** of two things **must** happen:\n   1. `go` tool commands to build code must be wrapped with `godep`, so `godep go install` and the like. This happens to re-exec the go tool with a modified `$GOPATH`, but this is just an implementation detail, subject to change at whim (although it is unlikely to).\n   2. `godep restore` must be run before using the `go` tool to build code. This modifies the copies of the dependencies in your `$GOPATH` by checking out the `Rev`s for each dependency in the proper `$GOPATH` location. This is sub-optimal.\n\nI hope this help clarify things. I'll try to improve the docs.\n\nPS: rewrites do not work with the Go15 `vendor/` experiment further complicating things, but this is be reflected in the docs already.\n. godep doesn't do anything with submodules AFAIK. Is this reproducible with the current version of godep and can a publicly accessible reproducer be made available?\n. Closing in favor of #271.\n. I am closing this because -copy=false hasn't been supported for a whule (since 754ee6f4e0e5fc8d0ef2692fb239d15c7a09dd84).\n. @duggan Why would you not import it as `<canonical>/<package>/<sub package>` ?\n\nFor instance when I have a \"local\" package of some sort I'll import it like `github.com/freefromz/mypackage/subpackage` instead of `./subpackage`.\n\nOr do you always work outside of  `$GOPATH` (which AFAIK is the only place local imports work properly ... but I could be wrong)?\n\nAlso, AFAIK, relative import paths are discouraged.\n. @steenzout What project?\n. It needs to be in your path, just like go does for this to work.\n. This is maybe something we should report on when working on #273, but generally I agree. Closing.\n. @shutej it's primarily for other systems to know which version of go to select to build the code.\n\nUltimately godep will **not** be involved in building code. My plan is to deprecate `godep go ...` after Go 1.6 and remove it around Go 1.7. Once Go 1.6 is released people should switch to using `vendor/` (this is possible now, but requires an ENV variable), which is supported by the `go` tool directly.\n. @neurogeek you may be interested in this one?\n. @neurogeek What are the use cases for an `omit` flag? My intent is not challenging it, I'm asking to clarify your reasoning.\n. @neurogeek I'd rather not add -omit if we can help it.\n\n@dsymonds Does this mean that users should `import \"google.golang.org/appengine\"` instead of `import \"appengine\"` and apply any updates necessary?\n. @dsymonds @ronoaldo For reference that README is here right? https://github.com/golang/appengine\n. Awesome. I'm going to close this issue out again then as I think it documents what people should do.\n. IMO these things are outside the scope of godep. You can't import a main package anymore starting with Go 1.5. If you vendor the code and have the go tools around you can still install it. So I'm going to close this. Thanks!\n. We have a bunch of other verbose output these days. If your are still interested in discussing something like this please re-open with an updated PR.\n. #108 is merged, so closing.\n. I rebased this on top of master and fixed a problem with the diff command.\n\n@kr @neurogeek I'm tempted to merge this at least because it stops common issues: (a) where people are working in a repo that isn't in version control (yet) and (b) the go code that you want to vendor deps for is a subdirectory of the VCS project.\n\nThis would close #107, #108, #173 (And maybe #43 and #48).\n\nPlease review/comment.\n. AFAIK `godep save -r` works with packages that also use godep as the dependent packages dependencies also get rewritten. godep does not use the deps from the dependency directly though and imports them from your local $GOPATH, which leads to different versions of the deps. So :-(\n\nAlso if your deps are rewriting and you are not it doesn't work. Probably vice versa as well. And I shudder to think about the case where one dep is and another isn't.\n. Closing in favor of #273 \n. @abhat Don't modify the GOPATH like that. Wrap the go commands with godep: e.g. godep go install ...\n. I'm going to close this as we now indicate which repo isn't using a VCS.\n. @abhat I really wish Kubernetes rewrote their deps so the restore and a few of their other dev bits wouldn't be necessary.\n. @themihai `godep version` ?\n. @least-olegs godep requires the commit sha / tag of the version of the code that it is copying. Without that info there is no way for godep to help you manage your dependencies.\n. @themihai `godep version`\n. @least-olegs godep does analyze all of your source code to determine which deps are in use and then copies those deps from $GOPATH into `vendor/` (or, for older versions of Go, `Godeps/_workspace/src`). \n. @themihai that is a super old version, so am not surprised you are having issues.\n. @binary132 I'm not sure how you are using godeps then? It's really meant to be run at the top level of a repo. Maybe I should enforce that? Or will need to make tests to exercise other use cases.\n. That's a very unusual workspace (https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces). If you are going to check a $GOPATH entry in, why not just git subtree your deps into your tree instead?\n. @jnfeinstein Please rebase against master and I'll take a look.\n. Thanks @jnfeinstein. At this point I think we need to have the new exported method documented and a test case.\n. @kr That probably makes the most sense in most circumstances.\n\nalthough I do wonder if there is a case where the developer doesn't support building everything with a dep that uses a different build tag then the one they designed for.\n. That is correct, but since it's vendoring everything regardless of `// +build` it could include something the developer didn't intent to include/support, which could then be triggered with a `-tag` by the builder.\n\nNot sure if it matters though.\n. @jsha would it work for you guys if godep just included all the deps, ignoring `// +build` tags? Thereby punting the tagging off to those building the code later?\n\nIMO this is the best solution.\n. Great I am going to close this then in favor of: #271\n. Closing as it's been there for a while. \n. +1, although I would expand the `go get` statement to include all `go *` tasks (e.g. `go test`).\n. Thanks! Merging.\n. Project maybe no longer uses godep, so closing because I can't repro.\n. `vendor/` provides some of this as you can have multiple vendor folders at different levels. I'm not yet sure we should support that and instead only make a top level `vendor/` folder with everything flattened down into it with a way smarter system for package resolution.\n. Thanks, but I think the way we're going to approach this by vendoring everything regardless of build tags.\n. @kr what do you think about this? I'm tempted to merge this, but I'm not sure you would agree. You've previously stated that a -v option (across all commands I believe) would be nice.\n. @Soulou Are you interested in fixing this up? If not I will likely start on the feedback from @kr.\n. @Soulou Maybe need another tweak of the rewrite output?\n\nSome things I think would make it clearer:\n\n1) rewrite:\\t...\n2) Use relative file paths instead of full paths\n3) maybe don't bother with the new rewritten path? We basically know what it will be and I'm mostly interested in knowing a rewrite happened, not all the details.\n4) There is inconsistent quoting in package names (original is quoted, rewritten isn't).\n. re: #3 that would make -r=false less clear though. Hmm. \n\nAnother option would be to say \"unrewrite\" or \"undo rewrite\" then the relative path and the original package name.\n\nBasically I'm just trying to make that output a little more visually parseable. \n. @Soulou Any thoughts on the most recent feedback?\n. I also added a -v flag, but atm it only outputs skipped files, so please rebase.\n. I'm going to close this out for now. Please feel free to re-open with an updated, rebased PR. Thanks!\n. Thanks, but while this is supported by go it's actively discouraged and we won't support this.\n. @mariokostelac Can you rebase this and I'll check it out?\n. #152 is similar(ish) and merged. If you want to re-open a PR with cleaned up (or additional) output that would be great, but I'm going to close this for now.\n. @kr Yeah. I did. I think I meant to reference both #152 and #243, but got distracted part of the way through. Thanks\n. godep relies on the go tool and by extension things being compatible with a $GOPATH workspace layout.\n. Closing in favor of #86, which I believe is the same thing.\n. I don't understand the use case for selecting dependencies manually. The goal of godeps is to make builds repeatable by vendoring all dependencies. This seems to contradict this goal. \n\nSince this has been here a while I'm going to close this. Feel free to re-open with comments / mergable update if you still want to pursue this.\n\nThanks!\n. This is why I suggest that we change the behavior to just skip parsing of testdata directories and copy them as is.\n. @neurogeek Awesome. Thanks!\n. get is a holdover from when godep didn't save the files. You generally don't need to use it.\n. Closing in favor of #86 as well.\n. Already done in 3d123490b0a248b2dea64deee887504a63295717 so closing. Thanks!\n. @edsrzf Can you please rebase this and I'll take a look more?\n. @edsrzf Thanks I changed a little and merged it. Also added a `-v` flag to go so you can see what's skipped if you want to.\n. Thanks. I rebased and merged this via fc2e546d696e649f7309cce1a644a1057d3710d5\n. Closing in favor of #79 \n. Well this is a godep bug as godep should be smarter. ;-) This is basically a problem where godep uses `go list` and that tool will filter out files that don't match the current OS (like *_linux.go files on OSX) or build tags.\n. @Raffo What version of godep are you using (godep version)? This is actually fixed in current versions as godep is no longer using `go list`. PS: This may be why a new save is fixed things for you.\n\nClosing because the reported problem is fixed. \n. @tsuna look at `list.go`, the main driver being listPackage().\n. I think I've effectively closed this with ba35b97d0db08d8d57599079d99b65add0282b4e.\n\nPlease let me know (new PR / Issue) if we should do anything more.\n\nThanks!\n. This should now be fixed by #231.\n. What version of godep are you using? At this point godep no longer uses `go list` to resolve any dependencies and processes files/deps for all files except those that include the `appengine` or `ignore` build tags.\n. Great! Thanks. Closing. For anyone else on this ticket please re-open / post a follow up if, after updating, things aren't working for you.\n. @jzelinskie If so please file that as a separate issue unless someone else has already done so. ;-) \n. @brandur what project / revision was this on ?\n. @brandur Ahh yes, that makes sense. I'm going to close this as a dupe of #138 then.\n. `godep save -r ./...`, then you don't need `godep exec`\n. I don't think we're going to be adding an `exec` command in light of using rewriting now and the upcoming `-vendor` option to the go tooling. With either of those you should just be able to use the go toolchain normally and use godep \"just\" for managing dependencies.\n\nI'm not sure if @kr agrees with me or not however.\n. @tarrant Thanks for the PR, but I'm going to close this out, please consider using rewriting for now until go1.5's `-vendor` option becomes available.\n. @conslo Read down to the bottom: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/golang-dev/74zjMON9glU/4lWCRDCRZg0J\n. @mpuncel How would `godep restore` work if different packages in the same repo are recorded at different versions? Which is the right version of the repository to restore to? That goes away when we can get rid of `godep restore`, which won't be until after Go 1.6 though.\n. @mpuncel agreed.\n. What is the use case here? Why would I want to vendor a \"package\" that I don't use in code?\n. I'm going to close this as I can't reproduce it. If this is still an issue please re-open with steps to reproduce.\n. Thank, but ...\n\nI don't think godep should be messing around with GIT_\\* environment variables. For instance this would mess with my own setup in a negative way as I rely on GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL & GIT_AUTHOR_NAME at times. If you are using godep inside of a git hook you should unset GIT_DIR/GIT_INDEX_FILE before calling godep.\n\nFWIW: I'd be happy to re-visit this if a different solution is presented. \n. @ErikDubbelboer Those env vars are not being used inside of godep, but I am using them in my environment. Thanks for contributing.\n. Why not just rewrite the vendored deps and then there is no need for godep, except when managing deps?\n. After Go 1.6 godep path and rewritting is going to go away and we won't be adding a godep exec.\n\nGodep can't vendor gox, you should install it and use it as necessary.\n. We're supporting the go 1.5 vendor experiment, so I'm closing this.\n\nThanks!\n. #108 is merged, so closing.\n. Closing. See #161 \n. Thanks, but In #103 it was decided that people should upgrade their apps to the current appending libraries which aren't so strange AFAICT.\n. You could do this with the linker now, it would just be a bunch of convoluted uses of -X.\n\nA convention like this is better off made as a https://github.com/golang/proposal though.\n. Please PR if you are still interested in this. I think it's becoming increasingly important.\n. This should now be fixed by #231.\n. How about `fmt.Errorf(\"error inspecting %q: %v\", dir, err)` ?\n. This shouldn't happen now so closing. If it's still happening please re-open.\n. This was fixed in https://github.com/tools/godep/commit/6a67fc143981c5d893576c3fbeb964a3745d7b12\n\nThanks for taking the time to submit this.\n. We're supporting the go 1.5 vendor experiment so I'm closing this. Thanks!\n. I think I am running into this issue in an internal repo...\n\n```\nbroker/io.go:8:2: code in directory /Users/emuller/go/src/github.com/heroku/busl/Godeps/_workspace/src/github.com/garyburd/redigo/redis expects import \"github.com/garyburd/redigo/redis\"\n```\n\nWhen I look into the files there I see things like this...\n\nhttps://github.com/garyburd/redigo/blob/master/redis/conn_test.go#L27, which aren't rewritten, althought L28 is.\n. Hmm. Maybe this wasn't related to this problem as I've managed to resolve it with some updates.\n. @charleswli update requires you to specify a specific package. AFAIK `./...` doesn't work with update.\n. The reported issue works for me. I made a test lib with a single function and used gomega to test it and ran `godeps save` and here's what it generated...\n\n``` console\n$ cat Godeps/Godeps.json\n{\n    \"ImportPath\": \"github.com/freeformz/t185\",\n    \"GoVersion\": \"go1.5\",\n    \"Packages\": [\n        \"./...\"\n    ],\n    \"Deps\": [\n        {\n            \"ImportPath\": \"github.com/onsi/ginkgo\",\n            \"Comment\": \"v1.2.0-6-gd981d36\",\n            \"Rev\": \"d981d36e9884231afa909627b9c275e4ba678f90\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"ImportPath\": \"github.com/onsi/gomega\",\n            \"Comment\": \"v1.0-28-g8adf9e1\",\n            \"Rev\": \"8adf9e1730c55cdc590de7d49766cb2acc88d8f2\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n@jayunit100 What issue are you running into? \n. Great. Closing this issue as it appears to be solved.\n. This should now be fixed in v37. Please re-open if not. Thanks!\n. @neurogeek I would rather say that testdata files should just be copied over as is w/o attempting to parse. This is especially true as we move to the use of `vendor/` and some of the discussions I've seen crop up around testing vendored code.\n. The stance of the go team/tooling is \"don't use symlinks\". Godep ends up utilizing that go tools / libs underneath and I'm of the opinion that supporting this will cause more issues than it solves.\n\nSo thank you for spending time on this issue, but I'm not going to accept this patch atm.\n. Does `godep save -r=false` not accomplish this?\n. @gfrey I'm not sure what you mean by \"given package\".\n. So you don't really want to unrewrite the import you want to remove it? If you remove all of the import statements imports a dependency and re-run `godep save -r` any no longer used imports will be removed from the workspace. The arguments to `godep save` aren't the packages that you want to vendor, they are the package spec(s) that you want to analyze for vendoring.\n. @gfrey that would confuse the meaning of the package spec passed to `godep save`, which is the packages you want to analyze dependencies for, usually '.' (the default), './...', or './cmd/...'. To be honest rewrites are going away as we approach Go 1.6 and the use of the `vendor/` directory, so I'm tempted to close as won't fix with the expectation being that you would use the vendor directory directly w/o rewrites anyway. At that time a `godep rm` command (which doesn't exist) would solve your problem (or just rm stuff manually from `vendor/`). ATM `godep save -r=false <your local package spec>` will un-rewrite everything so you can still do what you want, it will just take a few extra commands before or after. \n\nDoes that make sense?\n. `hg` is one of the supported vcs systems. I don't use mercurial much so if there is a specific problem please re-open describing that. Thanks!\n. It looks like \"/home/geovani/Code/foo\" is outside of your GOPATH. godep really only works with packages inside of a GOPATH.\n. I don't think godep will (or should) support this.\n\nYou could rsync the package from one machine to another.\nOr use github (or other git hosting service).\n. Upgrade your go version as per @akavel.\nIf this still persists and you are also on the most recent version of godep (go get -u github.com/tools/godep) please re-open this issue.\n. I use gox to cross compile several projects that are under godep. \n\nThese tools run the `go` command you need to rewrite your dependencies (`godep save -r ./...`), then you  will no longer need to do `godep go ....` and will only need to use godep when adding new files to your application or managing dependencies.\n. @neurogeek +1 on your suggestions.\n\nAlthough I am personally wary of adding this. If you don't rewrite the files, you'll end up picking up the same dep from elsewhere. AFAIK if you could get 2 copies of the dependencies initialized. I think this will add confusion overall.\n. @activars \n\nCan't you use a directory structure like so:\n\n```\n./cmd/cmd-b-name/main.go\n./cmd/cmd-b-name/main.go\n./common_package.go\n```\n\nThe above is installable with `go install ./...` or via `go get github.com/activars/mypackage/...` (at least with rewrites).\n\nIf you can't can you please expand on your explanation as to why, perhaps with an example?\n. Also, the stance of the go team/tooling is \"don't use symlinks\". Godep ends up utilizing that go tools / libs underneath and I'm of the opinion that supporting this will cause more issues than it solves. This is one example of them.\n\nSo thank you for spending time on this issue, but I'm not going to accept this patch atm.\n. I suspect this was a bug that was fixed a few months ago as I can't duplicate and I remember we had a bug that sounded like this.\n\nAlso, as @kr points out rewrites aren't necessary with Go 1.5 + the vendor/ experiment. So closing. \n\nPlease re-open if this is still an issue.\n. ATM you need to manually prune out the olds locations and then godep save the new deps. You may be able to get away with doing a godep restore, blowing away $project/Godeps, updating the deps in your code and doing a new godep save. Or at least that's what I would try first.\n. godep does not upload or download source files, it manages package locally vendored copies from those installed into your $GOPATH.\n\nTry ..\n\n``` term\n$ go get -u gopkg.in/alecthomas/kingpin.v2\n$ cd $GOPATH/src/<your package>\n# ensure that you are importing \"gopkg.in/alecthomas/kingpin.v2\" in one of your files\n$ godep save -r ./...\n```\n. I cannot duplicate this with go from source as of today + current version of godep from source. Please re-open with a reproducible test case if this is still an issue.\n\nThanks!\n. If you are \"forking\" a repo for temporary fixes / updates and plan on merging things up stream I suggest just adding the fork as a remote to the original package.\n\nIf you are not then you want to change all/any of the package paths anyway as you're effectively working on a different package.\n. @gelraen Why does it require a makefile?\n1. I am using package X (which is also a github repo) in my project Y. The package I am using is vendored in the Godep workspace (or vendor/) of my project.\n2. I find a bug in package X, so I fork it on github.\n3. I cd $GOPATH/src/<PKG X> and `git remote add freeformz https://github.com/freeformz/X.git\n4. I create a branch, fix the bug, commit, `git push freeformz bug_fix_branch`.\n5. I go to gituhb and open a PR against X with my fixes.\n6. I go to project Y on the filesystem ($GOPATH/src/github.com/freeformz/Y) and `godep update X`, which vendors what I currently have for X in my $GOPATH. I commit those vendored changes and push them to my public (or private) repo.\n7. Other's pull my code, with the vendored bits and use the vendored versions because they are in my repo and I'm using either a) rewriting; b) the GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT or; c) `godep go install ./...` (my recommended order btw).\n\nNow eventually the upstream either merges my changes or I do in fact need to fork the project and maintain something else.\n\nIf they merge my changes I can checkout master on project X in my $GOPATH and `godep update X` in project Y, commit and push.\n. FWIW: This works fine for me unless the checked out version of `gopkg.in\\flosch\\pongo2.v3` had uncommitted changes in it, hence the \"dirty working tree\" error. \n. If anything the `_workspace` folder and restore are going away with the advent of the `vendor/` directory. You can't make reproducible builds if the code is not vendored, and that is the point of godep, so unfortunately -1.\n\nAFAIK: `godep restore` is there as a relic of the past. If I can make it go away (and I haven't spent the requisite time yet) it will.\n. If you update the paths in your code / Godeps.json file it should just work if the commits are the same. If not I would suggest the following:\n1. Checkout the new package (go get it).\n2. Update your code to use the new package.\n3. Remove the old package from Godeps/Godeps.json\n4. run `godep save`.\n. _Maybe_ (and I'm not convinced this is the right thing to do) we could check to see if we have the commit in the repo first and only try to fetch if we don't have the repo and/or commit?\n\nOtherwise I'm not sure there is anything sensible to do here except bail out so the error can be corrected.\n. If we did this and the developer doing `godep restore` didn't have the repo locally in their $GOPATH we'd still have to fetch it anyway and bail out.\n\nWith that said fetching things we don't have is probably a fairly sane thing to do **but** could greatly complicate things.\n\nHonestly I think failing fast is still probably the best thing here.\n\nWhat do others think?\n. @lavalamp Doh!. Well my assertions still apply AFAICT.\n\n@tsuna What would be reasonable for godep to do?\n. I don't understand this use case though. \n\nGodep's goal is to vendor code for reproducible builds.\n. WRT Go: If you push me your repo or I check it out on a random machine, I need all the code in that repo to build the code. W/o all the necessary code I can't build the app.\n. @kr Thanks I was just about to attempt to write more or less the same thing. Thanks for being so eloquent as always.\n. @tsuna I'll have to think about it more. \n. As of 9570f62c8b83f643855711292495c37ebd2ceffc, godep uses the vcs list command, so that should close this. If I'm not understanding things right please re-open.\n. See comments on https://github.com/tools/godep/pull/214 for a workaround.\n. A workaround for this would be to checkout the github golang tools git repo to `$GOPATH/src/golang/x/tools`. After that you can use `import \"golang.org/x/tools...\"` and  `godep save -r ./...` as needed.\n. @kr Yes, perhaps we should.\n. I don't know if this is a good idea. What's the use case?\n. Wouldn't you want Godep to vendor the directory though?\n. @dprotaso any updates?\n. I'm going to close this out for now since there haven't been updates in a while. Please feel free to re-open / start new PR if you still think this feature is valuable.\n. confirmed.\n. Looking at rewrite.go (for the first time, so _grain_ _salt_) this may actually be a bug in either go/parser or go/printer (or maybe go/ast).\n. FWIW: When the comment is removed things work correctly.\n. Comment text is preserved when the file is parsed. `Comment.Text()` for that Import returns the text found in the file.\n. Closing this as we merged the PR to fix it.\n. Thanks!\n\nMerged in 8063f550a728b76d3a1a828e45d482f7dbde61e7\n. @jeeyoungk what happens to the extra intermediate file?\n. @jeeyoungk you can just pass in the buffer itself as it also takes an io.Reader, which bytes.Buffer is.\n. LGTM. I tested this on a few random projects and it also fixes the bug originally reported.\n. Closing as @jeeyoungk updated his PR with basically the same thing.\n. I would also add a `-r` to that as well so that the dependencies get rewritten. This will allow you to not have to use godep unless you are modifying dependencies (i.e. you can just use `go test` and the like naked and the app is then `go get` 'able). Assuming it's an app and not a library.\n. @kr what are your thoughts on storing the -r flag (or detecting it) and picking up the package spec from an existing Godeps.json file if none is provided? \n. SGTM. I'm going to close this then as it's unlikely something that we'll do.\n. You likely need to re-vendor under the new paths?\n. You can't import another package's main package.\n. hunh. My bad. I thought you couldn't and never checked that assumption out.\n. @thockin Can you re-produce on a public repo that I can test with / base a test on?\n. I assume this happened on a `godep restore`?\n\nTBH: I'm more interested in how you got into that situation in the first case, which is what I'd like a reproducer for.\n. @thockin @kr agreed. \n. For each of the deps that aren't found, run `go get -u <dep>` to make sure you have them installed locally and then you will be able to run `godep save`.\n\nTBH though I'm not 100% sure that the side effects of using etcd like this.\n. @kr Should we instead resolve these dependencies to the versions vendored in the sub project?\n\nFor instance `github.com/coreos/etcd/raft` imports `github.com/coreos/etcd/Godeps/_workspace/src/golang.org/x/net/context`. ATM you have to have `golang.org/x/net/context` in your $GOPATH to be able to run `godep save`.\n. It worked for me: https://github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient/pull/341\n. @apriendeau Do you have an example repo and steps to reproduce?\n. @apriendeau Sorry, I am lost. I am not sure what your starting point is above. \n\nCan you provide a step by step repro from a clean $GOPATH?\n. @timothysc Can you provide more information about what problem you are experiencing and/or put together a publicly accessible reproduction?\n. ATM, if you are vendoring etcd and it uses Godep to vendor net/context and you want to use the version of net/context that etcd vendors then you need to import it as:\n`your.package/Godeps/_workspace/src/github.com/coreos/etcd/Godeps/_workspace/src/golang.org/x/net/context`\n\nGiven the go vendor experiment becoming the standard in 1.6 I'm not sure it's worth putting much effort behind `godep save` being able to handle this case.\n\nThoughts?\n. FWIW: This is also an issue with any nested vendor directory setup. I opened (or commented anyway) on a similar issue against Go itself. The only real way to handle this is to flatten the deps so there is only one  `google.golang.org/grpc` package in use. I'd like to teach godep to do this (it already does it for the older workspace format). It needs to be taught how to check _both_ and DTRT. Hopefully later this month unless someone else shows up with PRs.\n. @thockin While it may be nice, I wonder if the possible vectors for confusion would be worth it.\n. See #240. I'm going to close this and urge anyone with input to discuss there. Thanks!\n. I don't think that's something Godep should really be involved in. \n\nIf you feel different I suggest opening an issue on https://github.com/kardianos/vendor-spec, which will likely be supported in the future.\n\nThank You!\n. Godep is truncating data, probably because the line being truncated is longer than 64k. If I'm right I may have a fix soon.\n. This should now be fixed by #231, so please `go get -u github.com/tools/godep` and re-open if this is still a problem (PS: You may need to cleanup your broken workspace first).\n. I do not have that problem at `v0.9.0-100-g38b4f07` of influxdb/client. Try an updated version?\n. You need to run go generate inside the workspace. \n\nTry this...\n\n``` bash\ncd <your repo>\nOGOPATH=$GOPATH\nGOPATH=$(godep path)\ncd Godeps/_workspace/src/github.com/btcsuite/btcd/btcec\ngo generate \nGOPATH=$OGOPATH\ncd <root of your repo>\ngodep go install ./...\n```\n\nYou will have to check the generate code in though, which you may not want to do.\n\nYour other option would be to wrap the build in a Makefile. This is because `go generate` is meant to be run before building **by design**.\n. @kr Gah, you are correct. I fixed it in #231. btcd already ran and saved the go generated bits, which were truncated silently by that bug, but would have been fixed by my example above (AFAICT).\n. @kr Done. If it LGTY, then I'll merge it.\n. Do you have syntastic enabled?\n. FWIW: I removed syntastic from my vim setup and similar issues are now resolved for me.\n. @fatih thanks btw.\n. @kr @neurogeek I've already run into this once with a user having previously installed godep via amd64 on darwin and then updating to a newer go version, but using the 386 package instead and then having issues pushing code.  So unless you have any objections wrt the implementation I'm going to merge this at some point.\n. godep restore modifies stuff in your $GOPATH by cloning repos and attempting to checkout the specified revisions. It's _all_ about messing with your $GOPATH. I generally recommend using rewrites limiting the need for restore to primary developers. With the vendor experiment this becomes even less necessary.\n. LGTM modulo questions.\n. @kr I'm going to merge this so things stop failing as Travis seems to default to ruby.\n. @kr Also my bad. Was kind of trigger happy.\n. @kr yes. Playing with it I just blew away log-shuttle's Godeps directory and didn't migrate anything.\n\nThe other thing that came up is what to do with vendored deps inside of vendored deps. There are several (many?) libraries that can't safely be vendored inside of vendored deps (lib/pq is one example). \n\nShould they be extracted to a top level? What if your package and a package you vendor both require the same lib. What if they are different versions? Just error out? \n\nHow does all of that affect things like  the cmd/CmdName structure where the root of your package is a library (which should or should not vendor stuff), but the library had deps and the cmd uses the library?\n\nAlso not sure how much of this tools like godep/vendor/nut/etc should care about.\n. @azylman While it allows it will cause problems. For instance if multiple things import multiple lib/pq's database/sql will panic because of multiple registrations in the same namespace (making few assumptions here). That is one example of course, but many things assume they'll be initialized once. That is at least one reason, there are probably more.\n. Closing this in favor of #244 / fe7138c\n. LGTM. Sorry about merging that too fast. I really wanted travis to stop erroring (and emailing me). Merge away.\n. I don't like the output of restore in verbose mode, but it's what get's output by go's tools/vcs stuff. We could clean that up later as I think this is helpful as is, modulo a few changes (which I'm just doing).\n. Thanks! merged\n. @kr Updated with suggestions.\n\nRe: What more. TBH I think this is enough for now. It's usable for me w/o changes to my workflow (modulo https://github.com/golang/go/issues/11659 anyway).\n. @kr just to be clear I don't think that golang issue should block. Just pointing it out.\n. @kr I also added docs and fixed an issue, so if you could take another look ++.\n. @kr I think I'd rather leave the file where it is. For now at least.\n. @kr Yeah, sorry I got distracted after the merge with other work.\n. @pierrre Not 100%, but essentially yes.\n. Hmm. Godep uses go's own libraries/tools to handle package/file selection, which basically ignores everything that isn't a *.go file. This is unlikely to be a \"trivial\" fix. :-( \n. I am okay with it. Basic implementation would be to do a case insensitive check for common License files (LICENSE, LICENSE.TXT, LICENSE.MD, ??) in the root of a repo and include the file if it exists. @ahmetalpbalkan Feel free to work on it and submit a PR when you are ready.\n. @ahmetalpbalkan Recent changes I made to the vcs file listing commands should play well with this. vcs also now has a way to determine the repo root (since it's given the package path).\n. @client9 A PR for the functionality described in this issue would be great!\n. @client9 Go for it. My focus for the next week or so is elsewhere (other projects) unfortunately. I'm just trying to keep anything godep related (Issues/PRs) moving along until I can get back to working directly on things.\n. Godep isn't really designed for this scenario.\n\nPersonally, I would do the above differently, like so:\n\n``` term\n$ export GOPATH=~/go\n$ mkdir -p ~/go/src/github.com/freeformz/project-dir\n$ cd ~/go/src/github.com/freeformz/project-dir\n$ mkdir pkg1\n$ mkdir pkg2\n$ .... code .....\n$ godep save -r ./...\n$ go test -v -race ./...\n...\n```\n\nThe above would make `pkg1` and `pkg2` available to any other project in my `$GOPATH` as `import github.com/freeformz/project-dir/pkg1` and `import github.com/freeformz/project-dir/pkg2`, although I would then vendor + rewrite them for use in other projects.\n\nIf you want to work on \"projects\" in the way you describe then I suggest checking out https://github.com/constabulary/gb\n. Do you have a simple case / repo that we can use to reproduce?\n. @brandur Thanks! Merged.\n. @neurogeek I am not sure, we discussed that @ Gophercon but there wasn't any resolution. Another idea was to use tags and travis to do binary releases to github, but people are still likely to go get godep and we still won't know what version is in use.\n\nMaybe a merge checklist? Even then you can forget to do it.\n. @neurogeek I'm going to merge this in for now. If we forget to increment the number then at least we know what could possibly be included (last version change and later), where now we don't know.\n. It's updatable like any other go gettable application: go get -u github.com/tools/godep\n. @jacobsa Sorry about that.\n. And I have confirmed the bug with a test app.\n. @jacobsa If you update godep (go get -u github.com/tools/godep) you should be good to go.\n. How do I reproduce this?\n. @sundarv85 rewrite your import paths (the -r option) is the way to work around having to use `godep restore` for the common cases (you will still need to do this before a `godep update` though).\n. Works fine for me.\n. Is your godep current (go get -u github.com/tools/godep)?\n. Okay. I was able to duplicate the issue, but I think it's a problem with the github.com/cloudfoundry/sonde-go/events, which won't compile on master (the same commit that is vendored) with the same errors.\n. /cc https://github.com/cloudfoundry/sonde-go\n. Ahh so the problem appears to be with the vendored version of gogo protobufs.\n\nThis commit updates deps a bit...\nhttps://github.com/shinji62/firehose-to-syslog/compare/feature/update-sonde-go...freeformz:feature/update-sonde-go\n\nAnd the resulting errors are with the code in the repo.\n. @shinji62 I would try to pull in the linked patch, which updates gogo protobufs, then fix the issues in the code locally.\n. @shinji62 no worries.\n. @JanSichula I'm going to have to setup a windows environment to test.\n. @JanSichula Which version of windows is this?\n. @JanSichula I was able to repo and make a small fix. Was exactly what I thought it was. Thanks!\n. @JanSichula Great. Let me know if you run into other troubles.\n. @kr @neurogeek For your review.\n. @neurogeek Thanks!\n. @kr Crap. Sorry I clicked the merge button. Habits. :-( \n. @windweller I can't reproduce this error. To test I put together 2 sample projects in my $GOPATH like so..\n\n``` term\n$ echo $GOPATH\n/Users/emuller/go\n\n$ cd $GOPATH/src\n/Users/emuller/go/src\n\n$ cat projA/comm/a.go\npackage comm\n\nconst Variable = \"Hello From projA/comm\"\n\n$ cat projB/b.go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"projA/comm\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    fmt.Println(comm.Variable)\n}\n\n$ cd projB\n$ find .\n.\n./b.go\n./Godeps\n./Godeps/_workspace\n./Godeps/_workspace/.gitignore\n./Godeps/_workspace/src\n./Godeps/_workspace/src/projA\n./Godeps/_workspace/src/projA/comm\n./Godeps/_workspace/src/projA/comm/a.go\n./Godeps/Godeps.json\n./Godeps/Readme\n\n$ godep go run b.go\nHello From projA/comm\n```\n\n`projA` was saved inside of projB with `godep save ./...` after `b.go` was written.\n\nCan you provide steps to reproduce?\n. Oh wait this was about `godep restore`. I get that same error. But you only ever need to do a restore if you want to reset the copies of a dependency in your GOPATH  to the vendored versions. This is still a bug though as projA/comm is valid AFAIK.\n. So while it's technically possible to do so in Go, atm godep (because of it's use of the go toolings vcs library) only fully supports packages in `host/user/pkg` format. But ...\n\nYou do not need to run `godep restore` if you wrap your `go` commands with `godep`. So `godep go install ./...`. Furthermore if you rewrite your deps (`godep save -r ./...`) you don't need to use godep on the server at all.\n. The way I would do this is ...\n\nWhen writing code use `godep save -r ./...`.\n\nWhen installing code run `go install -v ./...`.\n. @cdeadlock I don't understand the linked repo and what it's trying to do show.\n. BTW: I get this error with the \"graceful\" version even without involving godeps at all:\n\n```\n[martini] PANIC: Value not found for type martini.Context\n/usr/local/go/src/runtime/panic.go:387 (0x145c8)\n    gopanic: reflectcall(unsafe.Pointer(d.fn), deferArgs(d), uint32(d.siz), uint32(d.siz))\n/Users/emuller/go/src/github.com/go-martini/martini/martini.go:175 (0xaa8a6)\n    (*context).run: panic(err)\n/Users/emuller/go/src/github.com/go-martini/martini/martini.go:164 (0xaa773)\n    (*context).Next: c.run()\n/Users/emuller/go/src/github.com/go-martini/martini/recovery.go:140 (0xafb99)\n    func.004: c.Next()\n/usr/local/go/src/runtime/asm_amd64.s:402 (0x3cb05)\n    call32: CALLFN(\u00b7call32, 32)\n/usr/local/go/src/reflect/value.go:419 (0xd78d5)\n    Value.call: call(fn, args, uint32(frametype.size), uint32(retOffset))\n/usr/local/go/src/reflect/value.go:296 (0xd66cc)\n    Value.Call: return v.call(\"Call\", in)\n/Users/emuller/go/src/github.com/codegangsta/inject/inject.go:102 (0x187b97)\n    (*injector).Invoke: return reflect.ValueOf(f).Call(in), nil\n/Users/emuller/go/src/github.com/go-martini/martini/martini.go:173 (0xaa861)\n    (*context).run: _, err := c.Invoke(c.handler())\n/Users/emuller/go/src/github.com/go-martini/martini/martini.go:164 (0xaa773)\n    (*context).Next: c.run()\n/Users/emuller/go/src/github.com/go-martini/martini/logger.go:25 (0xaf29f)\n    func.001: c.Next()\n/usr/local/go/src/runtime/asm_amd64.s:403 (0x3cb75)\n    call64: CALLFN(\u00b7call64, 64)\n/usr/local/go/src/reflect/value.go:419 (0xd78d5)\n    Value.call: call(fn, args, uint32(frametype.size), uint32(retOffset))\n/usr/local/go/src/reflect/value.go:296 (0xd66cc)\n    Value.Call: return v.call(\"Call\", in)\n/Users/emuller/go/src/github.com/codegangsta/inject/inject.go:102 (0x187b97)\n    (*injector).Invoke: return reflect.ValueOf(f).Call(in), nil\n/Users/emuller/go/src/github.com/go-martini/martini/martini.go:173 (0xaa861)\n    (*context).run: _, err := c.Invoke(c.handler())\n/Users/emuller/go/src/github.com/go-martini/martini/martini.go:69 (0xa95e4)\n    (*Martini).ServeHTTP: m.createContext(res, req).run()\n/usr/local/go/src/net/http/server.go:1703 (0x6e51a)\n    serverHandler.ServeHTTP: handler.ServeHTTP(rw, req)\n/usr/local/go/src/net/http/server.go:1204 (0x6bfe7)\n    (*conn).serve: serverHandler{c.server}.ServeHTTP(w, w.req)\n/usr/local/go/src/runtime/asm_amd64.s:2232 (0x3ebc1)\n    goexit:\n[martini] Completed 500 Internal Server Error in 8.869917ms\n```\n. @cdeadlock The code here works (either version): https://github.com/freeformz/grb\n\nI updated martini after posting and before saving the deps.\n. @cdeadlock the repo I linked to is my recommended project layout as inspired by https://medium.com/@benbjohnson/structuring-applications-in-go-3b04be4ff091\n. This is why I highly suggest using `godep save -r ./...` as name spacing compiled stuff can become an issue.\n\nIf things get to messed up you can nuke your packages directory (`$GOPATH/pkg`) and it's sub-dirs and `go install -v ./...` will show you what it's re-compiling.\n. Sorry about that. I'm not really sure how this ever worked. Why not clean this up and use godep to vendor everything?\n\nAlso can you provide a publicly accessible repository that duplicates the issue?\n\nPS: What is your $GOPATH set to?\n. So it looks like a mix of git and hg then. FWIW I would use godep to vendor those deps and remove them  from the other locations.\n. Thanks. One more small change and we're good. Thanks!\n. AFAICT this doesn't skip at the right place as per your description. It skips errors in parsing the GoDeps file, not on restore.\n. There are other errors that can occur. Please generalize the message and report the error.\n. Also needs a rebase.\n. I am going to close this since there haven't been any updates in ~ 2 weeks or so. Please feel free to re-open with an updated branch if this feature is still important to you. Thanks!\n. Orly? I use `goimports` with `godep save -r` all the time.\n. Interesting to note. I've seen this, but I end up doing a save -r ./... to rewrite files whenever I add a new one so it hasn't bothered me. It probably should though. TBH this won't be needed at some point with `vendor/` being a thing (which is incompatible with rewrites).\n. that would be awesome.\n. Yeah. it's sub optimal (save vs. save -r). We could record what was used in Godeps.json, but that will also cause it's own set of problems at times. Plus rewriting should be going away pending the outcome of the 1.5 vendor experiment, so I really haven't had enough incentive to do anything.\n. See my comments. Eyeballing the testdata looks good.\n. @neurogeek I rebased and merged this as aeda8bab6aa7e64e94a83b40e29858daeb85ee87\n. FWIW: I am slowly working through the godep code to understand it's idiosyncrasies better than I do now and with an eye towards this. No promises and if anyone surprised me with a patch that would close this issue I wouldn't complain. ;-) \n. @mattfarina What needs did you feel were not met?\n. @captncraig Yep. I've spent a lot of time going down that same path and before I went on vacation (which I'm back from) I started writing my own version of go/build.Context because of this. It's no where near ready though. ;-) \n. FWIW: I'm acutely aware of this issue every day.\n. What version of godep are you using? What is the output of `godep version`?\nCan you link to your repo or is it private?\nCan you provide a publicly accessible reproduction (a public repo with a project the shows this issue)?\n. @neurogeek Doh. I blame being up early for the first day of school for not realizing that. ;-)\n. #276 should fix this once I get it reviewed by other maintainers and merged.\n. @neurogeek @kr this is on top of #275.\n. @eparis Doh! I fixed this in v10. Sorry about that.\n. @ahmetalpbalkan I can't duplicate this. I added an import for check.v1 to a main.go file and then used the C struct from there and godep save worked and did the right thing (added the dep to Godeps/Godeps.json and vendored the files in vendor/)\n\nAre you using check in a test file? I tried that as well (making a main_test) and `godep save` DTRT as well.\n\nWhat Go version are you using?\nWhat Godep version are you using?\nWhat is your $GOPATH?\n. Ahh. I was able to repro! Had an idea after posting that.\n\nI had to delete (remove from my $GOPATH) `gopkg.in/yaml.v2`. A `godep restore` solved that.\n\nMaybe you temporarily had a different $GOPATH set? One without `gopkg.in/yaml.v2` in it?\n. well I can duplicate by removing `gopkg.in/yaml.v2` from $GOPATH. I think this is a bug in `vendor/`support because the go tool should be able to find the package in the vendor directory. We're just doing `go list -e -json`.\n. ahh I forgot that the go tooling internally add `vendor` to all things in `vendor`. So it can't find it becuse go list returns `\"github.com/freeformz/t/vendor/gopkg.in/yaml.v2\"` in my case.\n. So currently godep strips out the vendor part of the path and then passes a constructed list of all flattened paths to `go list -e -json`, which then can't find `gopkg.in/yaml.v2` because in the context of `go list` in my test app it's really `github.com/freeformz/t/vendor/gopkg.in/yaml.v2`. This isn't trivial to fix AFAICT, especially when dealing with `vendor/` behavior vs. `Godeps/_workspace`. But probably worth the investment in time.\n. PS: For now the best way to handle new `godep save` is to do a `godep restore` before hand, ensuring that your GOPATH contains all of the required dependencies at the right versions before doing the new save.\n. on second thought `godep save` (which is perhaps now not aptly named) already removes dependencies when they are no longer used by your code base. The main idea behind this is you shouldn't be thinking about adding/removing dependencies by hand, just re-run save and let it DTRT.\n. What revision of `github.com/influxdb/influxdb` is vendored? What is the \"Rev\" key for it from your Godeps/Godeps.json file?\n. Also, what version of godep are you using?\n. while testing this I get the same thing with a simple go get -u of github.com/influxdb/influxdb (before \n\n``` console\n$ go get -u github.com/influxdb/influxdb\npackage golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt: cannot find package \"golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt\" in any of:\n    /usr/local/go/src/golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt (from $GOROOT)\n    /Users/emuller/go/src/golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt (from $GOPATH)\n```\n\nI ended up having to remove $GOPATH/src/golang.org/x/crypto from my $GOPATH. I suspect that the golang.org/x/crypto package is somehow incomplete and suggest removing it and then either re-fetching or using `godep restore`.\n. What version of go are you using?\n. What happens if you run `golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt` ? What is the output of that?\n. go get ....\n\n> On Sep 24, 2015, at 17:56, Li Yichao notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> You mean godep go get golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt or go get golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n.

Thanks!\n. Sure, care to update this and add a 'v' in front of the version? If you can back track this a little as well that would be good, but not 100% necessary.\n. @buddhamagnet looks great! I squashed them all down to a single commit and merged them. Thanks!\n. Merged! thanks!\n. I think Command belongs in main as it's mostly involved with the setup and execution of the various commands anyway. Good place to keep all the code, at least for now.\n. Thanks!\n. @ncdc sorry for the delay, I was on vacation for a little over a week.\n\nAFAICT there would also be an issue with resolving dependencies as well and recording the correct one.\nThis would be required anyway though.\n\nSo LGTM, merged!\n. I pushed a tag and I'll endeavor to do that in the future as well.\n. @kr @neurogeek thoughts?\n. @kr Re: Security. My goal is to just automate the creation of releases when tags are pushed. I don't intend to tackle the other parts of #110 really for all of the reasons you mention. IMO for \"normal\" use cases trusting Travis + GitHub and their certs is probably fine for the 90% of people wanting to curl down a release. I understand that isn't \"secure\" though in any way.\n. +1, merging because this isn't meant to address the security part.\n. :+1: \n\n@tsuna how about telling the user \"how\" to update first?\n. May also want to indicate the relationship between the two packages. \"packages belong to same repo\" or some such?\n. This should also fix #86 \n. @tsuna thanks. merged.\n. What happens if you `go get` each of your dependencies? Which one(s) print the same error?\n. I was able to reproduce with a simple test project. :-( Looking.\n. Well `godep save -v` tells me what's going on:\n\n``` console\n$ godep save -v\ngodep: save: skipping untracked file: /Users/emuller/go/src/code.google.com/p/go-uuid/uuid/LICENSE\ngodep: save: skipping untracked file: /Users/emuller/go/src/code.google.com/p/go-uuid/uuid/dce.go\ngodep: save: skipping untracked file: /Users/emuller/go/src/code.google.com/p/go-uuid/uuid/doc.go\ngodep: save: skipping untracked file: /Users/emuller/go/src/code.google.com/p/go-uuid/uuid/hash.go\ngodep: save: skipping untracked file: /Users/emuller/go/src/code.google.com/p/go-uuid/uuid/json.go\ngodep: save: skipping test file: /Users/emuller/go/src/code.google.com/p/go-uuid/uuid/json_test.go\ngodep: save: skipping untracked file: /Users/emuller/go/src/code.google.com/p/go-uuid/uuid/node.go\ngodep: save: skipping test file: /Users/emuller/go/src/code.google.com/p/go-uuid/uuid/seq_test.go\ngodep: save: skipping untracked file: /Users/emuller/go/src/code.google.com/p/go-uuid/uuid/time.go\ngodep: save: skipping untracked file: /Users/emuller/go/src/code.google.com/p/go-uuid/uuid/util.go\ngodep: save: skipping untracked file: /Users/emuller/go/src/code.google.com/p/go-uuid/uuid/uuid.go\ngodep: save: skipping test file: /Users/emuller/go/src/code.google.com/p/go-uuid/uuid/uuid_test.go\ngodep: save: skipping untracked file: /Users/emuller/go/src/code.google.com/p/go-uuid/uuid/version1.go\ngodep: save: skipping untracked file: /Users/emuller/go/src/code.google.com/p/go-uuid/uuid/version4.go\n```\n\nDef a bug.\n. @client9 it would because that uses git. Basically hg had a bug in it when there were sub packages in play. This is now resolved.\n\n@awsmsrc You should switch to the package @client9 mentions though regardless. \n. `go get -u github.com/tools/godep` will upgrade your local install of godep.\n\nYou can now also download binaries as well from https://github.com/tools/godep/releases, but `go get -u` is easier if you already have a working Go setup.\n. There are no files in contrib, they are in sub packages so you need to do `godep get github.com/gin-gonic/contrib/<sub package you want>`\n. The output of godep restore -v is sub optimal atm, but you don't need -v to see the error messages, normal `godep restore` will output any errors (as will -v, you'll just have a bunch of extra output as well).\n\n`godep restore` is what attempts to set the state of your dependencies in your $GOPATH to what they are in your repo. To do this it first downloads (via `go get -d`) each of the packages in your `Godeps/Godeps.json` file and then using the proper vcs for each package's repo attempts to checkout the recorded version. \n\nGiven that explanation, are you having a specific problem with anything?\n. Can you include the copy of the error and your Godeps.json file?\n. Yes so godep tries to 'go get -d' those packages and if it can't you'll get those errors. The go tooling only works off of master atm. So you'll get those errors since those packages don't exist on master anymore. \n\nWe probably want to switch to using the appropriate vcs to checkout the right repo instead of go get, but that's probably more work than I think it will be.\n\nthis is also probably a source of a lot of restore issue and frustration.\n\nThe only way to resolve this atm is manually with something like:\n1. go get -u <base package>\n2. Update your code/removing references to no longer supported packages.\n3. Remove the old packages from `Godeps/Godeps.json`.\n4. `godep save` to vendor your new imports.\n. It's used in the heroku buildpack to determine what version of go should be used to compile the provided code. I have thought about doing something similar in the heroku buildpack (where '1.4.*' would mean the latest patch revision of 1.4'. Beyond that I consider it an optional field as godep really shouldn't be involved with compiling code in any way in the long term. But also note that godep will update that value if you save and are running a newer version.\n. That would be great!\n. We should. PRs always welcome ;-). I'll see if I can get to it sometime soon.\n. I have been thinking about doing just this thing, so that when `GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1` is set to have `godep get` DL directly into the `vendor/` directory. It's pretty much what I would expect.\n. I am, but I don't have a timeline atm.\n. This would make the code unbuildable w/o those packages, so I can't accept this.\n. Looks like a good start.\nAny reason why we shouldn't include this as a library though?\n\nWrt using it ...\ngodep (generally speaking) uses absolute paths to files it finds in the repo. [copySrc](https://github.com/tools/godep/blob/32d49a17abe34aec8a58f6b4d049efd846206dfe/save.go#L268-L296) uses [vcs.listFiles()](https://github.com/tools/godep/blob/32d49a17abe34aec8a58f6b4d049efd846206dfe/vcs.go#L124-L144)  to get that list and [copyPkgFile](https://github.com/tools/godep/blob/32d49a17abe34aec8a58f6b4d049efd846206dfe/save.go#L298-L328) to conditionally copy the files into the vendor directory.\n\nSo IMO `IsLicenseFile` and `IsLegalFile` should take into consideration that it may get a full (or partial) path to a filename, not just the basename\n. @client9 vcs.listFiles() already produces a list of all possible filenames (with absolute paths) that would be considered for copying. Each of those is passed to copyPkgFile, where filtering takes place (arguably the filtering should be in a separate function) and if not filtered out the file is then copied. Please take a look at those functions as you can probably just hook into copyPkgFile.\n. @client9 After reading your comment I realized that [dep.dir](https://github.com/tools/godep/blob/32d49a17abe34aec8a58f6b4d049efd846206dfe/save.go#L282) could be a sub package as well, which I didn't consider last night, so you'll only be [walking](https://github.com/tools/godep/blob/32d49a17abe34aec8a58f6b4d049efd846206dfe/save.go#L284-L290) through the files in that sub package.\n\nAnother loop, using the contents of [vf](https://github.com/tools/godep/blob/32d49a17abe34aec8a58f6b4d049efd846206dfe/save.go#L282), which contains all tracked files in the repo (as absolute paths) is possibly the way to go?\n. @client9 Cool, let me know when I should re-review the PR.\n. @client9 Thanks, merged after a rebase/squash/version/changelog addition.\n. dcbe29c7a18887497b4857e64665d25be43f7c7e\n. What about other vcs?\n. @rasky I'll accept this if we can cover all vcs types. Tests would also be good.\n\nI also need to think about this a little more. What does it mean if the repo is dirty, with changes elsewhere but the particular package is \"clean\",  I think erroring out is still the sanest path.\n. 2 months w/o movement, so closing for now. Please re-open if you are still interested.\n. What is the vcs root in the above example? I assume it's the parent directory of `dirty` and `help` as in the example?\n. @rasky I am trying to understand what's going on here and the motivators. Godep is designed to be run in the top package of a repo. There is nothing in your PR BTW.\n. Sorry, I missed the `.` in the diff (I thought it was only a space via a quick glance). My bad.\n\nRe: description.\n\nAs I said godep is designed to work against the top level package of a repo. You are asking for a fundamental change to the tool.\n. PS: I guess I've already started that fundamental change with previous changes, so I'll have to think about this more.\n. @rasky That's for a dependency, not for the repo you are vendoring into. In your example, let's say `golang.org/x/crypto/ssh` needed to vendor something, `godep save` should only be run at the `golang.org/x/crypto` level.\n. @Alex-Addy You do not need to use godep to build if you a) rewrite your deps or b) are using go1.5+ with the GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1. Both of those are recommended over using godep to build.\n. @Alex-Addy godep should only be used from the root package of a repo. If a repo contains multiple packages you should not be running `godep save` in each package, but in the root package for that repo and use a more inclusive package selector (`./...`, `./<dira> ./<dirb>`, etc).\n. It's because you specified `./...` with `go test`. Which means you are running all of your tests and all tests inside the `vendor/` directory. Go test needs to build the code first so you run into this error. In go 1.5+ you can't import main packages (you could previously), so I think it makes sense for us to not vendor them. I won't be able to look into this more until later in the week / early next week, but will do so.\n. When you say 'adjacent' directory, what do you mean. Can you give me an example package directory structure?\n. @aj0strow Can I get your Heroku ticket #?\n. Moving this back to that Heroku ticket for now. Will update either this issue or open a new one pending the outcome there.\n. Turns out that you can also add the package to the godep save command line package spec. BUT, that's unlikely to work with the GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT.\n. Interesting. There used to be a bug like this, but it's been fixed for months. What version of godep are you using (`godep version`)? Can you produce a public repo that reproduces?\n. I was thinking of issue #231, which was about long lines, not really long files per se, but should be fixed anyway.\n. @client9 Any commits merged to master should include a version bump, a changelog entry and a tag. Since that's a manualish process it hasn't gone as smoothly as I'd like. Improvements to the process that continue to maintain godep's `go get`ableness are appreciated.\n. That already exists https://github.com/tools/godep/blob/58b9be6061a97e574c0695d6f15031f8b01a9629/main.go#L83-L86\n. No, thank you!\n. -t wasn't propagated to update. This should be fixed. If you have time/interested in doing a PR, great. If not I'll probably get to it either later today or tomorrow.\n. Thanks @kr. See #316 \n. how about this instead?\n\n``` go\nfunc runIn(dir, name string, args ...string) error {\n    c := exec.Command(name, args...)\n    c.Dir = dir\n    output, err := c.CombinedOutput()\n\n    if verbose {\n        fmt.Printf(\"execute: %+v\\n\", c)\n        fmt.Printf(\" output: %s\\n\", output)\n    }\n\n    return err\n}\n```\n\nSeems simpler and maintains intent AFAICT.\n. @jmhodges Thanks, merged as 605fb21360e22cca107bdc4d0c972cbf14353977 (I assume due to a rebase).\n. I'm not sure I follow. Do you mean editing files in `<proj>/Godeps/_workspace/src/..`? \n. @kr I was around. ;-)\n. Merged as: 0a8bd86405086a8fe6ceb91efc7214ebef864da8, so closing this.\n. Merged as e9ac6d762b492fd3c1fbf50e7c50f8ba64b9c42e\n. I think I'm alright with is as well (which is a change from my initial reaction).  Asking around a little internally as well.\n\nI would like to land a change to heroku/heroku-buildpack-go to select the latest minor version of the specified major version before merging a PR that implements @kr's suggestion.\n. @jtarchie If this lands before the buildpack changes they will be tied to the major go version until the BP can resolve the latest minor release (assuming they update their Godeps.json file and push). I don't like that behavior.\n. @flavorjones #342 merged as v39.\n. What would restoring from the Godeps workspace mean? We don't vendor the entire repository of packages being used, including the commit history, just the packages being used and the commit hash.\n. @matejkramny it's what is used to build a project and the only way to guarantee that the code is available is to commit it along with our own code.\n. To fully restore the repos that the packages live in to the $GOPATH. If we didn't do that there would be missing packages/tests/etc in your $GOPATH.\n\nFWIW: My plan is to remove `restore` sometime after most people appear to be using go1.6+ and using the GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT. So probably around the go1.7 timeframe. I'm hoping other maintainers/users agree with that (TBD).\n. I'm pretty sure I know why. Not sure what to do about it. Need to see if I can make a test case for this as well.\n. I don't think we can rely on `go get` to DTRT for downloads. The internal package doesn't exist in master anymore, so go getting the package first produces this error.\n. It's probably best if you want to discuss these / work these through to split this PR into two. One for each issue.\n\nPS: Symlinks inside $GOPATH aren't really supported (ex. https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-dev/GLUZGtUSj8A/SGUtCooLIT0J), so I'm curious as to how you are using them and why we would need to resolve them.\n. Thank you!\n. I started looking into this and I think this is really a side effect of a bug in /vendor/ (and possibly Godeps workspace handling or because of it). I'm digging in more.\n. Merged as 5e3d21abab679aef179d5dce308289619a59cf22\n\nThanks!\n. @sbogacz @michaeltrobinson This may be fixed in master now, can you please confirm.\n. @michaeltrobinson Great. I'm going to close this then. Thanks!\n. FWIW: Godep should support this as it knowns about both styles, old Godeps with and without rewrites and vendor. I hope to fix that issue \"soonish\", but don't know when I'll get to it.\n. Agreed. It's pretty low on _my_ priority list atm, given the other issues related to `vendor/` vs. Godeps workspace vs. Godeps workspace with rewrites. If you would like to take a crack at it though that would be great.\n. I don't understand this use case.\n\nI use and have several multi-command repositories that use godep.\n\nHere is one of them: https://github.com/heroku/shh\n\nWhen working with this project we `cd` into `$GOPATH/src/github.com/heroku/shh` and run `godep save -r ./...` and all of the deps for everything are vendored/rewritten.\n. a) godep is meant to be run against the root of a repo containing one or more packages. If you have a structure of `./mylib/cmd/cmdname` and run godep save in the `cmdname` directory `mylib` will be vendored again in `cmdname's` Godep workspace. This will likely lead to additional confusion.\n\nb) A PR that changes a single vcs command will not be accepted unless all vcs commands are updated, or proven to not need the same update. In the past this has led to problems/breakage in other vcs.\n\nc) The change probably doesn't do what you want as `git diff <rev> .` still considers sub dirs of `.`. So if you are running this in a `cmd` directory it will detect the library as dirty if any of the sub dirs/packages are dirty. Or at least it does with my version of git (2.6.3) / local config. I googled around for a \"fix\", but I don't think there's a simple fix to this w/o filtering things like dirstat output.\n. FWIW: I think the point of isDirty(dir,rev) was to determine if the repo root is dirty, not any given directory in a repo, but I'd have to let @kr chime in.\n. @azylman if that unmodified package pulls in other packages in the same repo that aren dirty and have local changes that you rely on? I guess we'd pick that up as a dependency on bomb out there though. So no, I don't think there's any problem with doing that, code just need to be adjusted properly.\n. FWIW This only works with git, what about the other vcs? Whatever we do we need to be able to support it across all supported vcs implementations.\n. Try unsetting $GIT_DIR maybe?\n. Oh duh on me. That's probably because godep save adds files to the repository, leaving it in a dirty state.\n. godep save will will copy deps to `<proj>/Godeps/_workspace/src`. At that point the tree is dirty. At the very least least the hook needs to `git add -A Godeps` after the godep save.\n. Tested this and with a few minor changes to the hook, it works currently.\n\nThis is the hook I used....\n\n``` bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\nset -e\n\nunset GIT_DIR\nunset GIT_INDEX_FILE\n\n$GOPATH/bin/godep save ./...\nNOGODEPCHANGES=\"$(git ls-files . --exclude-standard --others --modified | grep Godeps | wc -l)\"\n\nif [ $NOGODEPCHANGES -gt 0 ]; then\n  cat <<\\EOF\nERROR: Some Go dependencies have been updated with `godep save`\nERROR: Please add them to your commit.\nEOF\n  exit 1\nfi\n\nexit 0\n```\n. @bojan-embroker I don't understand your problem then as this worked for me.\n. @bbokorney Since you are updating the version, please also update the Changelog and squash down to a single commit. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. @shurcooL Thanks, merged as cf33bd75a8243ac701090bb6fa8e0b81b9746fcb\n. Try `godep save -r ./...`\n. `.` is the default.\n. We currently rely on go get, so if it's fixed in go 1.6 (and if we're continuing to rely on get by then) it will be fixed then. Nothing much we can do here aside from re-implement `go get`, which we may need to do anyway for other reasons. :-( I'm going to leave open for now though as reminder of issues with go get.\n. What godep version? \n. See https://github.com/tools/godep/pull/362 and https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/18695 (similar, dep was basically missing before).\n. godep save supports saving any package specified in the pkg spec.\nWe are using that internally to vendor `github.com/zimbatm/socketmaster` into an application. socketmaster is a `main` package.\n\nSo specifying something like `godep save -r ./... github.com/zimbatm/socketmaster` works as expected. using something like `jq` the heroku buildpack [reads the Packages out of the Godeps/Godeps.json](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-go/blob/52ebcad122e4cb12ae9bf9bba13aa9f0342fd5d6/bin/compile#L177) file and installs all of the packages specified there with [`godep go install $pkgs`](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-go/blob/52ebcad122e4cb12ae9bf9bba13aa9f0342fd5d6/bin/compile#L227).\n\nCould you try something like that instead?\n. PS: I'm also -1 wrt adding another file.\n. @jonboulle the package spec passed to `godep save` is what feeds godep the list of packages to inspect for 'automagical detection'. I would only list `main` packages if you want them saved. Arguably `godep save` w/o any args should default to `.` or the contents of the `Godeps/Godeps.json` Packages array, if the file exists. This would probably help a lot and help people DTRT more often. Thoughts?\n. Re Rewrites: it would rewrite and vendor any of the imports the vendored tool imports. But you'de want that wouldn't you? That's the only way to guarantee you can build that tool later.\n\nre: Godeps.jon: It's already a manifest, and I don't mean manually editable. Yes, it changes the current workflow a bit (but not much). I'm basically saying that every time you do a `godep save` it reads in `Godeps/Godeps.json` and if there is a Packages array there it uses those values for the package spec. If there is none, it defaults to `.`. If you specify a new package spec with a save it uses that one, overwriting the existing one in the file. This is where problems could come up though.\n. Ahh yeah. I missed that. For instance github.com/zimbatm/socketmaster doesn't have any external deps, so no rewrites. You could _not_ use rewrites for now, but either way that's a bug,\n. Hmm. This may break how some people use godep, not sure. The way _I'd_ like godep used is that it would only rewrite packages that are specified via a relative package spec (`., ./, ./..., ./cmd/..., etc`) and their dependencies. In my mind it should not rewrite other package specs at their original location(s). But I can see how some people may use the fully qualified package spec when doing save (e.g.: `godep save github.com/me/thepackageImworkingon`). I've also seen people construct oddities in Makefiles to enumerate packages and pass the fully qualified package names to godep (I don't know _why_ they do that though).\n\nThis would also require some tests, if they don't exist.\n. If you want to take a crack at any of the things we discussed I'd be happy to review. For now I'm going to close this PR though. Thanks!\n. LoadPackages still uses `go list`. I opened a PR yesterday that removes `go list` and also solves the missing deps problem: #341, effectively making your `-a` just the way godeps works (at least AFAICT).\n. FWIW: I've never run into this and use godep almost daily. I'm not against sorting the dependencies though. I would like a repeatable example of when/how this happens and a test for it.\n. @JekaMas Can you provide an example of this workflow?\n. What is the output of `echo $GOPATH` and `pwd` when you run these commands?\n. Turns out @imajes's $GOPATH is symlinked out of a Dropbox folder. `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` shows the symlink resolved path, so none of the `Contains()` calls finds the file.\n. This may also fix #334.\n. @kr sorry about the noise a bunch of stuff in pkg.go slipped in from another, earlier experiment.\n. Would close #337 \n. @neurogeek After some issue discussion (heroku/heroku-buildpack-go/100 and another I can't find atm) I generally think that we should really only care about the major version of Go and let downstream systems care about selecting the minor version (the user or build systems). There are probably exceptions to that, hence I also stopped auto-updating the go version on save, allowing people to specify whatever they want if they manually want to manage the file. \n. Thanks for taking the time to write this PR. FWIW: I'm -1 another flag. I'm +1 for an implementation that skips rewrites for any package specified that falls outside of the package in the cwd and it's sub packages though. While this may nerf godep for some people I think it's a what most people would expect and the least surprising. \n. It probably needs another rebase. Let me take a quick look and make some code comments too.\n. See comments, also a rebase (sorry). Thanks for adding the positions to the comments. Otherwise LGTM.\n. Small comment about the new type, otherwise LGTM\n. @krnowak Thanks for your patience with the extended review!\n. FWIW: My plan is to really only support \"compilation\" (go get github.com/tools/godep) against the current major version of go and the last major version of go. Currently go1.5.\\* & go1.4.\\* basically.\n\nPS: Once #352 lands this should be fixed.\n. @robdimsdale I updated the readme slightly to reflect the new versions. If you feel that's not sufficient a PR would be great!\n\nPS: #352 is merged as v34 and should fix this problem. Can you confirm?\n. \"Fixed\" in #352 as we'll also ignore files with the \"ignore\" build tag, at least for now. I think that's the path of least surprise. \n. Thanks for the PR, but I took a different approach in #352.\n. @njohns-grovo Yeah [v32](https://github.com/tools/godep/tree/v32) should be okay atm. Sorry about that. I think I was being too optimistic with my use of build.Context. I'll add a test to duplicate this and bang on the new package evaluation code to fix it.\n. What version of go (output of `go version`) are you using?\n. This is because `go/build` does not have MultiplePackageError previous to go1.4 (IIRC; didn't check). #350 should fix this as we don't use that error anymore.\n. ps: also using the v33 executable should also work (barring other problems fixed in #352)\n. v34 (#352) should fix this.\n. Thanks for the PR, but I took a different approach in #352.\n. I'm going to let this sit for bit as I want to re-read it after I put it down for a little. Probably also a bunch of cleanups I can do as well.\n. Probably also fixes #345, #346, #347, #351. Need to make sure we have tests to cover those cases though.\n. Fixes #350 (We don't that error anymore).\n. \"Fixes\" #353 \n. We can probably get some (hopefully all?) of that back with a cache of ast files and/or a package cache. I'll PR later today.\n\n> On Dec 8, 2015, at 20:57, Jonathan Boulle notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> This change appears to have had a pathological effect on performance in at least one of our repos (coreos/rkt):\n> \n>  ; time /tmp/gopath/bin/godep32 save -r ./...\n> \n> real    0m1.649s\n> user    0m1.383s\n> sys 0m0.341s\n>  ; time /tmp/gopath/bin/godep33 save -r ./...\n> godep: found packages keygen.go (main) and keymap.go (keystoretest) in /tmp/gopath/src/github.com/coreos/rkt/pkg/keystore/keystoretest\n> \n> real    0m1.729s\n> user    0m1.487s\n> sys 0m0.240s\n>  ; time /tmp/gopath/bin/godep34 save -r ./...\n> \n> real    0m41.054s\n> user    0m37.493s\n> sys 0m4.088s\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. @jonboulle v34 should fix that.

I am really interested in making sure I can duplicate via a test case. A PR with a failing test is even better. ;-) \n. [`identity_classic.go`](https://github.com/golang/appengine/blob/7f9f17f358c21d90f402980f83776898c53cb377/internal/identity_classic.go) is importing \"appengine\". Since this is guarded by a build tag `go list -e -json google.golang.org/appengine` wouldn't pick it up, so it worked. \n\nWe now parse all files regardless of build tag and \"appengine\" isn't a valid import (except on appengine probably).\n\n``` console\n$ go list -e -json appengine\n{\n    \"ImportPath\": \"appengine\",\n    \"Stale\": true,\n    \"Incomplete\": true,\n    \"Error\": {\n        \"ImportStack\": [\n            \"appengine\"\n        ],\n        \"Pos\": \"\",\n        \"Err\": \"cannot find package \\\"appengine\\\" in any of:\\n\\t/usr/local/go/src/appengine (from $GOROOT)\\n\\t/Users/emuller/go/src/appengine (from $GOPATH)\"\n    }\n}\n```\n. I'm not 100% sure what to do about this (aside from full build tag support for godeps). I may just special case \"appengine\" for now to unblock anyone hitting this issue and then remove that special case if/when full build tag support materializes. \n. Yes. Sorry. I was so focused on #357 and other stuff this week I haven't kept up on many other PRs. :-( \n. Thanks for taking the time to do the PR.\n. `godep save -r ./... github.com/gengo/grpc-gateway/third_party/googleapis/...`\n\nRewrites will work sanely once #343 is merged (likely next week pending rebase / update by author).\n\nThat should vendor the `github.com/gengo/grpc-gateway/third_party/googleapis` and all it's sub packages assuming they're not messed up in some way (or a bug).\n. My main performance testing repo https://github.com/coreos/rkt  went from a little less than 60s to a little less than 4s on my laptop.\n. @tevino vendor experiment enabled or not ?\n. @tevino confirmed w/o anyway. Which is strange. Digging now.\n. @peter-edge I'll be looking into this today.\n. @tevino Actually I take that back, not confirmed w/o experiment.\n\n``` console\n$ export GOPATH=~/go2\n$ mkdir -p ~/go2/src/github.com/freeformz/t358\n$ cd ~/go2/src/github.com/freeformz/t358\n$ cat > main.go <<EOF\npackage main\n\nimport \"github.com/bitly/go-simplejson\"\n\nfunc main() {\n    simplejson.New()\n}\nEOF\n$ go get \n$ godep save\n$ find .\n.\n./Godeps\n./Godeps/_workspace\n./Godeps/_workspace/.gitignore\n./Godeps/_workspace/src\n./Godeps/_workspace/src/github.com\n./Godeps/_workspace/src/github.com/bitly\n./Godeps/_workspace/src/github.com/bitly/go-simplejson\n./Godeps/_workspace/src/github.com/bitly/go-simplejson/.travis.yml\n./Godeps/_workspace/src/github.com/bitly/go-simplejson/LICENSE\n./Godeps/_workspace/src/github.com/bitly/go-simplejson/README.md\n./Godeps/_workspace/src/github.com/bitly/go-simplejson/simplejson.go\n./Godeps/_workspace/src/github.com/bitly/go-simplejson/simplejson_go10.go\n./Godeps/_workspace/src/github.com/bitly/go-simplejson/simplejson_go11.go\n./Godeps/Godeps.json\n./Godeps/Readme\n./main.go\n$ cat Godeps/Godeps.json\n{\n    \"ImportPath\": \"github.com/freeformz/t358\",\n    \"GoVersion\": \"go1.5.2\",\n    \"Deps\": [\n        {\n            \"ImportPath\": \"github.com/bitly/go-simplejson\",\n            \"Comment\": \"v0.5.0\",\n            \"Rev\": \"aabad6e819789e569bd6aabf444c935aa9ba1e44\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n. @tevino confirmed with experiment though.\n\n``` console\n$ rm -rf ~/go2\n$ mkdir -p ~/go2/src/github.com/freeformz/t358\n$ cd ~/go2/src/github.com/freeformz/t358\n$ cat > main.go <<EOF\npackage main\n\nimport \"github.com/bitly/go-simplejson\"\n\nfunc main() {\n    simplejson.New()\n}\nEOF\n$ export GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1\n$ go get\n$ godep save\n$ find .\n.\n./Godeps\n./Godeps/Godeps.json\n./Godeps/Readme\n./main.go\n```\n. @peter-edge It was closed because it should be fixed in b34e1d5bdabea644cd12faffd2eadcfad52caea2, which is what closed it.\n. @peter-edge What package are you in when you save?\n. FWIW: Based on the [Makefile](https://github.com/libopenstorage/openstorage/blob/d84dc4ab90841c3d6413d21339b4d6c4fb856d03/Makefile) I don't really understand how you are using godep. You want to keep the Godeps/Godeps.json file around so it's relatively easy to determine what was already vendored (either in the godeps workspace or `vendor/`)\n. Also, at least until I can do away with the Godep workspace, godep works on the principle that packages be installed in the $GOPATH for save to work. I would do a `godep restore` to continue testing, but there is no `Godeps/Godeps.json` file available for a restore to work and be reliable.\n. @peter-edge I'm going to close this issue again. I'd like to continue discussion your use of godep but there are several issues and AFAICT they don't have anything to do with this one.\n. I realized what the problem is. My understanding of how `build.FindOnly` works was faulty. So I'm working on a replacement.\n. @eparis GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1 ?\n. This is probably because these newer versions are more inclusive wrt what they'll vendor and the same rules are being applied to restore, so it's not finding a package it thinks should be vendored. :-( \n\nI wonder if doing a `go get golang.org/x/sys/unix` will take care of it and/or change the errors?\n. For some more clarity we only ignore files tagged with `ignore` and `appengine` build tags. Before `go list` would also filter out any non local platform files. This caused issues in that a lot of development happens on OSX, but deployments happen on Linux. So if your deps required an extra package on Linux, they wouldn't be saved and then your build would likely fail (depending how how you setup your environment TBH and lots of people mistook how godeps works because of this).\n. I'm going to poke at this early this afternoon (Pacific/US) and see if I can provide better guidance / work around / suggestions / patch / etc.\n. This is what I get currently on master with godep v36:\n\n``` console\n$ mkdir ~/go2\n$ export GOPATH=~/go2\n$ go get -u k8s.io/kubernetes\npackage k8s.io/kubernetes: no buildable Go source files in /Users/emuller/go2/src/k8s.io/kubernetes\n$ cd ~/go2/src/k8s.io/kubernetes\n$ godep restore\ngodep: error downloading dep (github.com/google/cadvisor/api): exit status 1\ngodep: error downloading dep (github.com/google/cadvisor/http): exit status 1\ngodep: error downloading dep (github.com/google/cadvisor/manager): exit status 1\ngodep: error downloading dep (github.com/google/cadvisor/pages): exit status 1\ngodep: error downloading dep (github.com/google/cadvisor/validate): exit status 1\ngodep: error downloading dep (golang.org/x/exp/inotify): exit status 1\n```\n\nThese restore issues may be related to something else I need to look into. Digging.\n. Not sure. There is also an issue where restore will fail (currently) if the dep package is no longer available in master (that's the issue I was referring to, not sure the number). I'd like to fix that issue this week, but may be unrelated.\n. ``` console\n$ go get -d github.com/google/cadvisor/api\ncontainer/raw/handler.go:38:2: no buildable Go source files in /Users/emuller/go2/src/golang.org/x/exp/inotify\n```\n\ncadvisor is having issues on master. This is basically the same bug as the one I mentioned.\n. FWIW: the cadvisor issue has nothing to do with godeps per se. Master isn't even buildable for me.\n. @eparis BTW: I wasn't able to reproduce the initial issue (`Unable to find dependent package golang.org/x/sys/unix`). What OS was that restore run on ?\n. I suspect it was linux. If so you probably want to re-save using v35 to pick up new deps.\n. That's possible. I'll make a linux VM /  AWS instance after lunch and duplicate / etc.\n. Duplicated in a linux docker container:\n\n``` console\n$ godep restore\ngodep: error restoring dep (github.com/Sirupsen/logrus): Unable to find dependent package golang.org/x/sys/unix in context of /app/user/src/github.com/Sirupsen/logrus\ngodep: error restoring dep (github.com/boltdb/bolt): Unable to find dependent package golang.org/x/sys/unix in context of /app/user/src/github.com/boltdb/bolt\ngodep: error restoring dep (github.com/docker/docker/pkg/jsonmessage): Unable to find dependent package github.com/Azure/go-ansiterm/winterm in context of /app/user/src/github.com/docker/docker/pkg/term\ngodep: error restoring dep (github.com/docker/docker/pkg/term): Unable to find dependent package github.com/Azure/go-ansiterm/winterm in context of /app/user/src/github.com/docker/docker/pkg/term\ngodep: error restoring dep (github.com/docker/libcontainer): Unable to find dependent package golang.org/x/sys/unix in context of /app/user/src/github.com/Sirupsen/logrus\n\ngodep: error restoring dep (github.com/google/cadvisor/api): Unable to find dependent package github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient/external/github.com/hashicorp/go-cleanhttp in context of /app/user/src/github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient\ngodep: error restoring dep (github.com/google/cadvisor/http): Unable to find dependent package github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient/external/github.com/hashicorp/go-cleanhttp in context of /app/user/src/github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient\ngodep: error restoring dep (github.com/google/cadvisor/manager): Unable to find dependent package github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient/external/github.com/hashicorp/go-cleanhttp in context of /app/user/src/github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient\ngodep: error restoring dep (github.com/google/cadvisor/pages): Unable to find dependent package github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient/external/github.com/hashicorp/go-cleanhttp in context of /app/user/src/github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient\ngodep: error restoring dep (github.com/google/cadvisor/validate): Unable to find dependent package github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient/external/github.com/hashicorp/go-cleanhttp in context of /app/user/src/github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient\n```\n\nSome of these are confirmed platform specific transitive dependencies that were missed by older versions of godep.\n\nIn the case of logrus & bolt they both import `golang.org/x/sys/unix` on solaris.\n`docker/docker/pkg/term` has a windows specific transitive import on `github.com/Azure/go-ansiterm\"`\n\nThe `github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient/external/github.com/hashicorp/go-cleanhttp` errors are something else, possibly related to an ordering issue in the restore code.\n\nI'm looking into this and related stuff.\n. @eparis See #362 along with https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/18695\n. @thanodnl Previous to #362 godep loaded the packages before checking out the specified versions. This caused problems, especially with other recent changes (but they were present before anyway, just less pronounced).\n\n@eparis You guys need `golang.org/x/sys/unix` because of bolt:\n\n``` console\n$ godep restore -v  #Using the #362 version of godep.\n...\ngodep: Checking dependency: github.com/boltdb/bolt\ngodep: Dep (github.com/boltdb/bolt) restored, but was unable to load it with error:\n    Unable to find dependent package golang.org/x/sys/unix in context of /Users/emuller/go2/src/github.com/boltdb/bolt\ngodep:  This may be because the dependencies were saved with an older version of godep (< v33).\ngodep:  Try `go get golang.org/x/sys/unix`.

FWIW: until v33 `godep save ./...` would only save deps for the current platform.\n. `godep version` should work for any version of godep after ~v1 (IIRC).\n. If you are using GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT (and it looks like you are) and running v35 then update to v36 (https://github.com/tools/godep/issues/358)  and let me know if there is still an issue.\n\nI'm going to start committing GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT related tests tomorrow (hopefully) and if not I'd like to get a reproducable test case for this. \n. :-( I'll see if I can make a small repro tomorrow (although I probably won't get to it until the afternoon).\n. Closing in favor of #358 \n. Thanks! (merged as part of bf180cbe9d2f255d72616470db39c2cae2f77e5d)\n. @ironcladlou This should solve the aws-sdk issue .... but there are some consistency issues with `github.com/openshift/origin` Godeps.json file. \n\nSome of them are duplicate shas for the same repo, one for package A another for package B in the same repo:\n- https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/0d4de0b1801e8c58a28c8bcd9d12b5d0c46de1cb/Godeps/Godeps.json#L744-L753\n- https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/0d4de0b1801e8c58a28c8bcd9d12b5d0c46de1cb/Godeps/Godeps.json#L876-L895 \n\nSome appear to be shas from forks of the repos that are not on the canonical master (see #366).\n\nThere is at least once case where a recorded package is missing (looks to be in a [PR](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/7893)) but is also recorded twice with 2 [different shas](https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/0d4de0b1801e8c58a28c8bcd9d12b5d0c46de1cb/Godeps/Godeps.json#L1241-L1250).\n. /cc @eparis This should solve for packages that were removed.\n. @eparis confirmed that this solves the docker/timeutils issues for you as well.\n. https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/18685 for reference\n. @tsaikd What version of godep are you using? and if it's not the latest, is it still an issue with the latest version?\n. AFAICT your Godeps.json file is incomplete?\n\nIf I make a simple app that uses the appengine package my generated Godeps.json file looks like this:\n\n``` console\n$ cat Godeps/Godeps.json\n{\n    \"ImportPath\": \"github.com/freeformz/t365\",\n    \"GoVersion\": \"go1.5\",\n    \"Deps\": [\n        {\n            \"ImportPath\": \"github.com/golang/protobuf/proto\",\n            \"Rev\": \"68415e7123da32b07eab49c96d2c4d6158360e9b\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"ImportPath\": \"golang.org/x/net/context\",\n            \"Rev\": \"0ab009005dc16437045369e823a35d1af6232b69\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"ImportPath\": \"google.golang.org/appengine\",\n            \"Rev\": \"54bf9150c922186bfc45a00bf9dfcb91a5063275\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nAlso: You do not need to do a `go get` after a `godep restore` as long as all of your deps are recorded (which `godep save` does).\n. Go is not node. The `google.golang.org/appengine` package uses `github.com/golang/protobuf/proto` and w/o it the code won't build. Godeps is about making builds repeatable. W/o that code vendored there may be times where I can build your code (I've seen npm go down and cause all sorts of problems where users could no longer deploy).\n. @DreadPirateShawn I was able to reproduce this by synthetically checking out the affected package and running restore.

I plan on changing up the error message a bit to recommend a `godep get <pkg>` and then have the get command properly fetch all transitive deps (right now it can still miss some as it's still using `go get`). As a possible additional step I was thinking of adding a `get` option to save (or just make it the default). For now you can fetch the other deps manually with `go get`.\n. Maybe godep should also handle build tags based on the version specified in Godep.json? That does open up a different set of problems (like additional work on `godep update -goversion`). ATM godep will vendor every dep it finds, regardless of tags (except for `ignore` and `appengine`), this is by design.\n. Not yet, I am thinking that godep should probably use the recorded go version in conjunction with build tags to DTRT and not analyze deps for go versions that differ from what's recorded. The idea being that what's recorded as the go version is the version in use and the one being tested against. But I'm sure some people would disagree with that. There is an argument to be made for either case. For instance see #386 \n. Recent versions of go record the version of go in use and also support go version build tags, so I'm closing this.\n. Can you commit the `Godeps/Godeps.json` file that your are using so that I can investigate?\n. You would have already created a Godeps/Godeps.json file when you originally saved your `vendor/` directory. You would then `godep restore` things into your $GOPATH. FWIW: I realize that this usage with `vendor/` is less than optimal, but I can't change it too much w/o breaking the non `vendor/` way ATM.\n. let me see if I can repro after manually installing all the deps.\n. Heh. I see there is a makefile target for that. \n. ``` console\n$ mkdir ~/go2\n$ export GOPATH=~/go2\n$ go get -d github.com/libopenstorage/openstorage\npackage github.com/libopenstorage/openstorage: no

The package argument that you pass to `godep save` is the package(s) that you want to analyze for vendoring, not the package that you want to save. Put another way it's the packages who's dependencies you want save. Does that help?\n.

It is a transitive dependency that \"go get\" does not fetch, but can be required on other platforms to build the package. Older versions of godep relied on the go tool, but we no longer do, for exactly this reason.\n\nI plan on enhancing this workflow, especially around GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT.\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\n> On Dec 22, 2015, at 06:06, Ged notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> This is a bug i think.\n> Once i did a go get golang.org/x/sys/unix, then godep was happy.\n> So it should be included in godep binary or whatever ?\n> \n> dw99-MacBook-Pro:backend apple$ godep save -r\n> godep: Unable to find dependent package golang.org/x/sys/unix in context of /Users/apple/workspace/go/src/github.com/Sirupsen/logrus\n> gedw99-MacBook-Pro:backend apple$ go get golang.org/x/sys/unix\n> gedw99-MacBook-Pro:backend apple$ godep save -r\n> gedw99-MacBook-Pro:backend apple$ \n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. @mikeatlas `golang.org/x/sys/unix` is not a \"core\" Go package. If you `godep save` and record that dep you can remove the need to fetch it with go get.\n. @geofffranks Yes, this should be fixed as of a month or two ago. I'm going to close this issue, but feel free to re-open if it's still failing with deps saved by v55.\n\nThanks!\n. Something you are requiring is transitively pulling in golang.org/x/sys/unix across OSes.\n. `go get golang.org/x/sys/unix`. After the restore you probably need to re-save to record `golang.org/x/sys/unix`.\n. Sorry. I should have replied sooner. This got lost in email. :-( \n\nI'd much rather do this by making [this](https://github.com/tools/godep/blob/master/list.go#L22) configurable via an array in Godps.json. Plus ensure that our code handles all the various permutations of build tags. And maybe default to what is hard coded now.\n. @diogogmt This is likely due to the fact that godep ignores arch build constraints, since it doesn't know where you will finally compile code.

Nevermind, realized that your package root has a trailing slash, so this should be fixed in v44. Please let me know!\n. @c-knowles I could test the underlying function probably, but I'm not really sure how these paths are being generated in the first place, hence the initial ask for the entire debug output.\n. Sorry about that. I'll have to spin up a windows machine to test with. \n. @DamienFontaine So this looks like a case insensitive issue (which was different, but similar to the original issue). Can you test with a godep built from this branch: https://github.com/tools/godep/tree/pathEqual and confirm if things are fixed or not?\n. @DamienFontaine Great. Merged and released as v56.\n. This should be closed by v45. If not please re-open. Thanks!\n. This looks good, but what happens when a legal file get's dropped at `github.com/camlistore/go4/legal/LICENSE.md` ? AFAICT we'd include that one too when we probably shouldn't as errorutil doesn't depend on legal and shouldn't vendor anything from it.\n. @jonboulle I'm suggesting that fixing the later will also fix this issue, but in a more complete fashion.\n. @thockin godep does not verify if what you have in the workspace is what's recorded in `Godeps.json`. That is kind of hard tbh w/o messing with your $GOPATH and/or downloading a bunch of stuff. So yes, it assumes that if it's in Godeps.json that it's in your workspace. \n\nGO15VENDOREXPERIMENT only means something to go versions >= 1.5, so I don't really understand the use case for 1.4 versions of go.\n. I have to enable the vendor experiment if the target version of go is 1.6 and the environment variable != \"0\". It's what I would expect as a developer.\n\nI think this would work better for you...\n\n``` go\n    go15ve := os.Getenv(\"GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT\")\n    VendorExperiment = go15ve == \"1\" || (majorGoVersion == \"go1.6\" && go15ve != \"0\")\n```\n. TBH though I wouldn't expect that env var to do anything when using any version of go < 1.5\n. My intention when introducing `GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT` support was to mirror the go tool's behavior. With go 1.4 that flag doesn't mean anything. Since we no longer depend on `go list` I felt a stricter interpretation within godep was necessary to be more closely align with the go tool.\n\nPS: Why aren't you using go 1.5.2 locally at this point?\n. @thockin godep defines it's GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT flag like the go tool. So when using go1.4 it shouldn't do anything wrt that flag. I probably should have specified harder checks initially, but I really didn't expect people to _want_ to use it with go1.4 in that way, nor do I think most of our users. So I'm going to close this as \"works as intended\" in a few days unless others pipe up that my expectations are way off base.\n. Do you think we should record the sha?\n\n``` console\n$ go version\ngo version devel +8d5ff2e Tue Dec 29 21:16:59 2015 +0000 darwin/amd64\n```\n\nProbably not worth the hassle. If you are using devel it will just always vary most likely.\n. Thanks!\n.

It would have to be a separate flag, or a modification to the -t flag (make it have different modes beyond true/false). Many people want to save the deps for their tests, but not the deps for their dep's tests.\n\nAlso, would require a test case in save_test.go\n. Maybe we could combine this with the `diff` command somehow?  Or at the very least deprecate the diff command for this or something like it.\n\nI'm hesitant to add another command atm w/o more thought into it's purpose and how it fits in long term. For instance. I'd like to have `godep get` fetch directly into the `vendor/` directory when VendorExperiment is on (with a switch to disable) ... how would this command work then?\n. @awsmsrc I totally get the point and it's something I like. I don't use `diff` much because frankly it's not useful enough to me. I think something like this could be more useful.\n\n@shurcooL Nice packages/tools. I have been wanting to add something like `godep status` for a while to relay what godep thinks about the status of the project you are working on and it's dependencies. I think our licenses are compatible so I may look at \"borrowing\" some of that work. ;-) \n\n@client9 Godep has no real \"api\" atm, but I'm open to PRs / work to open one up.\n. @awsmsrc `godep diff` already shows what's outdated (although perhaps a little more haphazardly than we'd like. How about altering the way that command works to work like this proposal? I think this would be more useful to people anyway.\n. @awsmsrc SGTM I have a bunch of other stuff scheduled for this week.\n. @awsmsrc Are you still interested in working on this?\n. Closing, please open a new issue (or re-open this one) if you are interested.\n. It was an oversight omitting it from the Changelog (at the least) and the README. I'll see about fixing that up ASAP.\n\nWe currently do ignore files with `ignore` and `appengine` tags: https://github.com/tools/godep/blob/a1054101461cab7f7c67a22e3aabd0fdb567ce3a/list.go#L271\n\nFWIW: I'd like to add back in more tag support at some point.\n. Maybe we should just check earlier and abort as basically the GOPATH is assumed to exist ATM?\n. Thanks. Merged as c98cb3f12da9d553e2e47522800fec483a524beb.\n. If you can show me how to do that via travis-ci I'll be happy to add that. ATM travis-ci does all of the [releasing](https://github.com/tools/godep/blob/2daafc44881230f2d032188a278a7acc68dd5488/.travis.yml#L23-L35). \n. I'd be willing to test it out.\n. Should devel not have the same rule as 1.6  and be written as:\n\n``` go\n((majorGoVersion == \"go1.6\" || majorGoVersion == \"devel\" )&& os.Getenv(\"GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT\") != \"0\")\n```\n. Yes, the environment variable is supposed to be removed in go1.7 (so likely sometime after go1.6 release for devel). I'd say keep it split out, but fix the logic so it's inline with go1.6.\n. Thanks. This was merged as b922ec76f7137e4a33a07663f4cf8f9614e494cd.\n. Please make sure to `go fmt` the code and I'll merge.\n. This was merged in as 26e6c638845825cecd1addc3f03578c9977676bd. Thanks!\n. @shurcooL Is this satisfactory for now?\n. Probably. godep expects the packages to exist in the $GOPATH atm. If you are starting a new project you'd start with `go get <pkg>`, use it, then `godep save` to record / copy it into your godep workspace (or `vendor/`). If you are working with an existing project that uses godep, you can start with a `godep restore`, which will modify your gopath to equal the recorded/saved deps. This can be worked around somewhat by saving with rewrites (`godep save -r`), but the ultimate solution is that godep will (eventually) use what's in `vendor/`. Some of that logic already exists, but not all of it yet.\n\nDoes that help? If not, can you please describe what you are doing in more detail?\n. @kevinburkeshyp do a restore, re-save without `-r` (or -r=false) to remove any rewrites if you have them and then blow away `./Godeps`, then checkout any updated deps you want in your `$GOPATH` and then `godep save` everything again.\n. This is also an issue when a package starts importing new packages too. For instance grpc 51d644aca6b8eca07b6bd2f5ea435998bf73fa92 to fea7689493da00c4590150b3534c256a962259d3\n. Thanks for reporting this. Total oversight. ;-) Should be fixed in master (v51) and as soon as travis makes a release it will be on the releases page.\n. Hmm it may. I'll have to look into it and make a test case. Thanks for the report.\n. Thanks for the report. Will look into it.\n. I'll have to see what the vcs library generated for a url and see if that's the problem in these cases. Sorry, been working on other stuff for a bit. Hoping to get back to this later in the week or next week.\n. @MrJoy `godep save -d <other args>` should do that and a LOT more however.\n. @MrJoy Thanks for the analysis ! This is pretty much what I _thought_ is likely happening, sorry I wasn't more specific in my response.\n\nFWIW: godep uses https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/go/vcs, which I _thought_ took care of all of that. It may not though as there is a wide discrepancy between the go command line tooling and these supplemental libraries. \n\nI'll look into those libs to verify what they do and if they don't work like the go tooling will patch and PR them.\n. @MrJoy @derekdowling So the error for goji is being returned from https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/3f1f7eeff104d9ef829677f12b9780dfdd26a96a/go/vcs/vcs.go#L395, which was thrown from `RepoRootForImportDynamic` which calls `parseMetaGoImports` which looks for the `go-import` tag. So something in the golang/tools/go/vcs package is busted vs `go get` AFAICT. \n\nDigging more.\n. This is fixed in v64. It was a bug in the [vcs package](https://github.com/golang/tools/commit/157f8abbbd7c19e90432c72cb6216cf0b9324c55)\n. @cmoesel Can you share your Godeps.json file and any code? Also, what does 'find . -type d -name \"bson\"` return ?\n. I can't duplicate this, so I need more info.\n\n``` console\n$ cat main.go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n\n    \"gopkg.in/mgo.v2/bson\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    fmt.Println(bson.Binary{})\n}\n$ godep save\n$ cat Godeps/Godeps.json\n{\n    \"ImportPath\": \"github.com/freeformz/t408\",\n    \"GoVersion\": \"go1.6\",\n    \"GodepVersion\": \"v70\",\n    \"Deps\": [\n        {\n            \"ImportPath\": \"gopkg.in/mgo.v2/bson\",\n            \"Comment\": \"r2016.02.04-1-gb6e2fa3\",\n            \"Rev\": \"b6e2fa371e64216a45e61072a96d4e3859f169da\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n$ find .\n.\n./Godeps\n./Godeps/Godeps.json\n./Godeps/Readme\n./main.go\n./vendor\n./vendor/gopkg.in\n./vendor/gopkg.in/mgo.v2\n./vendor/gopkg.in/mgo.v2/bson\n./vendor/gopkg.in/mgo.v2/bson/bson.go\n./vendor/gopkg.in/mgo.v2/bson/decode.go\n./vendor/gopkg.in/mgo.v2/bson/encode.go\n./vendor/gopkg.in/mgo.v2/bson/LICENSE\n./vendor/gopkg.in/mgo.v2/LICENSE\n```\n\nAlso @russellhaering when I checkout your example repo and I run godep save on it `Godeps/_workspace/src/gopkg.in/` get's added.\n\nMaybe it was solved in the meantime?\n\n@cmoesel What version of godep are you using?\n. godep doesn't support this. It may have inadvertently done so in the past however. I'm going to keep this open though for now while I reconsider.\n. Can you try a build of godep with #418 applied and see if that fixes things?\n. @Manbeardo thanks for the update. I'll have to make a test case (even if it's manual) and figure out where else we fall down.\n. Thanks for the test & report. I'll have to investigate more and see if I can make a test case.\n. FWIW: godep (v60) no prints out a warning whenever you are NOT in the $GOPATH.\n. What version of godep are you using?\n. Also, when you say private repos, what do you mean? godep works with what's on disk already in your $GOPATH.\n. Please upgrade and try again w/o a `vendor/` or `Godeps/` directory. The current version is v52 and I remember something like this being fixed a ways back.\n. No worried. Thanks for giving it a try!\n. `godep` is designed to be run from within your $GOPATH with all of the deps also in the $GOPATH. So if you are working outside of the $GOPATH with symlinks and/or your deps are the same way `godep` may not work well for you. If you are inside of the $GOPATH though I'd really like to see if we can re-produce this to fix the issue and make a test case for it.\n. That seems like  a strange $GOPATH. Normally $GOPATH is something like `export GOPATH=$HOME/go`. And the you `cd $GOPATH/src/<project>`, where `<project>` == something like `cd $GOPATH/go/src/github.com/tools/godep; edit code; godep save`.\n. what version of godep, go, is the vendor experiment turned on or off and (based on the tree output example) I assume the project was created w the vendor experiment turned off....\n. Hmm. Nothing jumps out as off. I'm going to need the extremely large (possibly) output of `godep save -d -v <whatever other args you are using` unless you can re-produce it on a public repo.\n. Please try again with v55+ and if there is still a problem please upload a new `godep save -d -v <pkg spec>`. I fixed a few bugs and added some more debug output (which may help in this case).\n. Does `github.com/foo/bar/backend` import anything ? godep isn't detecting any imports or dependencies.\n. Thanks for trying. I don't understand what you mean by \"standard vendor support\". Are you not using a tool to maintain `vendor/`? \n. Oh, so if `backend` doesn't contain any files you need to pass `godep save` a package spec that includes all of the packages you want to have it analyze. This defaults to `.`, hence nothing is being saved to `vendor/`. Given the package structure you described, you probably want `godep save ./cmd/...`\n. Ahh okay. FWIW: godep writes to `vendor/` when go1.6 (or go1.5 + env var) is used. Sorry you had troubles. Do you think there is any way I could update godep or the docs to better convey how save is supposed to be used?\n. Please upgrade to v53 and let me know if this is still an issue.\n\nThanks!\n. Also note that this patch \"increases\" the number of listed dependencies because we're no longer doing the path prefix match in godep fill. Previously if you had something like:\n\n```\npackage A/B, imports A/B/C\npackage A/B/C\n```\n\nYou would get a dependency on `A/B` recorded and then everything (including _any_ sub dirs) of `A/B` would be copied in, including `A/B/C`. So things would work, but the recorded deps would be off (in that they didn't include all transitive deps).\n\nNow you get both dependencies recorded (`A/B` and `A/B/C`).\n. This was _okay_ in the \"workspace\" days because of the rewrites or requirement to prefix `go` tool runs with `godep`. But with `vendor/` you can just use the naked `go` tool and `./...` really should just work when everything is vendored properly. This should (barring other issues) fix that after a re-save of dependencies. \n. @phinze Yep. I was looking into why `./...` wasn't working with go install's for various go1.6 setups (with vendor) because it just should have. And that's when I noticed what seems to be previously spec'd behavior that I disagree with (copying all sub dirs of a required package).\n. @phinze checking with terraform master now to see if what godep's generates is good.\n. Once hashicorp/terraform#5248 is merged the instructions should be:\n\n``` console\n$ git checkout master\n$ godep restore\n$ git checkout <feature-branch>\n$ <edit code, add imports as necessary>\n$ godep save ./...\n$ git add -A .\n$ git commit -av\n```\n\nIf that doesn't work (except for exotic situations) then I consider it a bug.\n. Did you start out with a `godep restore` ? \n. The process I've used several times is : https://github.com/tools/godep#migrating-to-vendor \n\nThere could be bad revisions being restored though. For instance https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/5248 needed to update a google cloud library because the code was using a local version and hadn't updated the vendored version yet.\n\nCan you provide a copy of you Godeps/Godeps.json file? \n. @sunheng that's probably because you have 2 different revs recorded, which is invalid. Fix all Revs to be the same for all `code.google.com/p/google-api-go-client/googleapi` packages.\n. @gracedo Are you outside of your $GOPATH and/or using symlinks?\n. @gracedo when the above output says `<path-to-project>` what is that? \n. @gracedo what is the output of `godep version` (looking for the entire string).\n. Is your fs case sensitive or not? It's part of the output of `diskutil info /`. I wonder if there is a regression there for some reason.\n. At this point I think I either need access to the code or the full dump of `godep save -d -v  > out 2>&1` (which can be large) using v54.\n. Actually wait. I got that backwards. So it's not case sensitive. What do you get from the following 2 commands run inside of `$GOPATH/src/github.com/SocialCodeInc/advisor-notifications/` (using whichever method you normally use to cd there).\n\n`pwd`\n\n`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`\n. Hmm. then I'm not really sure what's going on w/o the dump or the ability to reproduce it. Sorry.\n. I haven't been able to. I've done this now with a bunch of projects w/o incident (aside from stuff that was otherwise inflicted). I need the `-d` switch added to that, which will add tons of info.\n. Note all of the \"skipping untracked file\" output. That's telling me that symlinks may be used somewhere.\n\nIf you go to `cd /Users/grace/code/go/src/github.com/Sirupsen/logrus` and run `git ls-files --full-name` what is the output?\n. Also what is the output of `echo $GOPATH` ?\n. And also `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` in the same place that `git ls-files --full-name` is run.\n. So here's the problem: `/Users/grace/Code/go/src/github.com/Sirupsen/logrus` vs `/Users/grace/code/go/src/github.com/Sirupsen/logrus`\n\nI added a simple check of == recently.\n\nPlease update and try with v55 (just pushed). I bet that fixes it.\n. @gracedo thanks for working through this and sorry for all of the back and forth.\n. May (partially) fix #409.\n. May (partially) fix #334 \n. We _used_ to be able to do this via `godep save github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo ./...` and use `godep go install github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo` to DTRT. But with the vendor experiment that doesn't work.\n\nWe can vendor it in the same way (`godep save github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo ./...`), but it needs to be installed a little differently:\n1. as `go install github.com/hashicorp/terraform/vendor/github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo`.\n2. `godep restore && go install github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo` (This touches the network though)\n\nSo that provides 2 possible immediate work arounds.\n\nAnother possible solution is just manually copy `github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo` into `ginkgo/ginkgo`, `godep save ./...` and install it with `go install ./ginkgo/ginkgo`. That's not fun though.\n\nSome thoughts (none of which I'm convinced are good or not):\n1. Addition of a `godep install` command which could walk through Packages from Godeps.json and install the non local packages (or all of them). So you would then run `godep install github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo` and that would shell out to `go install github.com/hashicorp/terraform/vendor/github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo`.\n2. A modifier to `godep restore` to restore directly vendored files to $GOPATH w/o hitting the network, which would then let you `go install github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo`.\n3. I could make `godep go` vendor aware and when it seems a target that it knows/thinks is in vendor it tries to DTRT and append the local package name + \"vendor/\" to the target. I'm afraid this may be fraught with errors and edge cases though.\n\nI'm open to suggestions on how to otherwise deal with this though. \n. A draw back to this is that you also need to _always_ add `github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo` to your `godep save` pkg spec. I am considering having `godep save` w/o any params just use what's in `Godeps/Godeps.json` if it exists or default to `.` (which is what it does now if you don't specify a pkg spec). Thoughts?\n. If you are using the `vendor/` experiment and have vendored an external dep like ginkgo, you can install it along with everything else via `go install ./...`. Since `./...` will consider everything (including mains) inside of `vendor/`. See hashicorp/terraform#5291 for instance.\n. There are several issues here AFAICT.\n1. github.com/drone/drone does not use godep (there is no metadata file listing the contents of vendor).\n2.  godep does not as of yet collapse / pull up all dependencies. This can lead to this problem like here.\n3. godep relies on things being in $GOPATH.\n4. I don't really understand how drone manages these dependencies as there is no Godeps/Godeps.json file, so it's impossible to do a `godep restore`, which should be done before a re-save.\n. Ahh. Thanks for the clarification.\n\nSo the biggest issue is probably because we don\u2019t pull up all deps and flatten them at the top level (yet).\n\n> On Feb 23, 2016, at 7:22 PM, Dmitri Shuralyov notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> To clarify, the codebase I was referring to (src.sourcegraph.com/sourcegraph/...) imports and uses both github.com/drone/drone/... and github.com/docker/docker/... or parts there-of.

Probably v54 as I made the godep save exact dependencies. The current resolver doesn't know about figuring out / including C dependencies. It accidentally (or on purpose depending on how you look at it) worked before hand, but you had to drop your C deps in the correct spot for it to work.\n\nCan you link me to the repo this is an issue with and/or detail your directory layout?\n. The package analyzer doesn't understand parsing cgo imports. The workaround that should work for now is to put the c code in the same directory as the package that uses it. I'm not sure if we'll ever support anything beyond that going forward either. Need to think more about it and look at more projects using cgo before making a decision.\n. @twmb godep does use go/parser when analyzing packages, but currently that all get's thrown out and isn't used during the copy process. My next steps are to not throw that data out and preserve it so that it will simplify other code (like copy) and enable things like `godep status` (and maybe even a `godep graph`).\n\n@karalabe Thanks. Agreed. I need to dig through some common libraries that use CGO to really understand the assumptions. I don't think just blindly copying over .c/.cpp/.h files anywhere below the package would be sufficient, but maybe it is?\n. FWIW sqlite-3 has moved their files around so it will no longer happen with that library after an update of that package: https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3/commit/3a5555302e9b06eb5461016462900f1412ae3f7c\n. There may be some stuff in here I can use: https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/go/loader/cgo.go\n. You save dependencies by running. `godep save <pkg spec>`, where `<pkg spec>` is the code you want to analyze for dependencies (i.e. your code). It sounds like you are running `godep save github.com\\golang\\protobuf`, which is telling godep to analyze `github.com\\golang\\protobuf` for dependencies and vendor that. \n\nDoes that help explain usage? I should probably take another pass at the README, especially give go1.6.\n. That is not the way godep is used. Godep looks at your source code and figures out what packages your code is using and vendors those packages. So something like this ...\n\n``` console\n$ cd $GOPATH/github.com/<you>/<your project>\n$ vim main.go\npackage main\n\nimport \"gopkg.in/natefinch/lumberjack.v2\"\n\nfunc main() {\n  // make a logger, use it, etc\n}\n$ godep save\n```\n\nGiven the above the `godep save` looks at the code in the current directory and discovers that `gopkg.in/natefinch/lumberjack.v2` is being used and copies `$GOPATH/src/gopkg.in/natefinch/lumberjack.v2` to `vendor/` (or `Godeps/_workspace/src/gopkg.in/natefinch/lumberjack.v2` if you are using go1.5 w/o the vendor experiment).\n\nDoes that make sense?\n. What version of godep are you using? `godep version` output ?\n. Please upgrade to v57 and see if the issue is resolved or not. \n. What version of godep (output of `godep version`)?\n. What version of godep are you using (godep version).\n. Can you attach the output of `godep save -v -d 2>&1`. it will be quite large and you may need to upload it elsewhere / provide a compressed version.\n. Godep hasn't vendored dependency's test files by default since ~v9 (9/2015). So any save that was created before v9 may have done so, but any later saves should remove them.  What version of godep are you using?\n. I also fixed a bug recently where godep was vendoring more than it should have (because of old assumptions in the code that also included any sub directories of a package). If you are using godep please update to v56+ and do the following:\n\n``` console\n$ godep restore\n$ rm -rf Godeps vendor\n$ godep save <pkg spec> \n$ git add -A .\n$ git commit -am \"re-save to remove cruft\"\n```\n\nWhere <pkg spec> is the packages you want godep to analyze, so proabably `.` (the default) or `./...`.\n. Thanks! I try to respond quickly, but can't always. So yay for finding just the right time to ask a Q. ;-) \n. Yes. It should flatten those deps out.\n. yes, we should do better there. There are also all sorts of problem related to v1 and v2 of \"a\" being used at the same time. For instance a type from v1 of \"a\" is not the same as the same type returned from v2 of \"a\". Even if they look the same. The only sane thing to do is flatten. We should ask / prompt / let the user decide which one to choose though (assuming we can't programmatically determine the best version).\n. Because there would then be 3 versions of the same dep. That can lead to confusing, unexpected and subtle errors in the program.\n. if `foo` and `bar` happen to return their own `a` types to their users they won't be equal if compared, which can lead to issues. I don't have links handy but this has been discussed a bunch in Go issues and IIRC go-nuts.\n. I have been thinking about doing this very thing for those very reasons. \n. So my main concern with this is Godep.json churn. But that's probably un-avoidable if we do want to record the version string. w/o using this version elsewhere I'm not sure this is all that useful. And I can see trying to enforce the version to add overhead to interactions with developers. But maybe that overhead is already being imposed, just in an ad-hoc way?\n. PS: I am interested in figuring this out, just thinking through the details here a little and the end goal.\n. `save` or `update` will modify Godeps.json. `godep get` just (currently, I have a notion to change this to something more useful given `vendor/`) shells out to go get with some wrapping. I'm not sure the version should be updated on `godep update` though, since it's not a total re-save, more like selective editing. So if you see a Godeps.json file that had a small modification done you can't really assume it has all of the package fixes from recent versions for instance.\n\nI don't know if that's enough to re-consider this or not.\n\nI guess looking at the git history and the comments would probably tell you enough though about what was done?\n. Err Sorry. I meant the commit log with the version numbers and comments like \"Updated github.com/foo/bar\" would tell you.\n. Thanks!\n. Sorry it took so long to answer this Q. It got lost in email :-(\n\nIt probably has less to do with `.` than with godep being explicit about which packages it is importing. Previously godep would only note the top level package and would also copy in all sub packages and directories, even if they **aren't** being used. This causes a bunch of problems when using `./...` with the go1.5+ vendor experiment as the go tool's use of `./...` includes **everything** in vendor.\n\nThis change happened in v54: https://github.com/tools/godep/blob/master/Changelog.md#v54-20160222\n. Yes, it's expected as godep is more specific wrt what it records as being used. Before it was kind of loose. I don't think it's related to `.` (`.` isn't treated specially by godep), it's just that those packages actually import sub packages that are properly part of your dependencies. \n. What version of godep are you using?\nWere you in your project's root directory in your $GOPATH?\nWhat options did you pass to 'godep save'?\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\n> On Mar 10, 2016, at 19:10, WanliTian notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> hi, all\n> there are items about subpackages under golang.org within godeps.json\n> but i cannot find any packages in vendor dir.\n> \n> go 1.6\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. @WanliTian And the other things I asked about?\n.

Thank you, that will help tremendously. \n. @Sironfoot Your home directory is symlinked into your Dropbox folder? \nWhat is your version of godep (`godep version`). If you are not on v57+, please upgrade (`go get -u github.com/tools/godep`) and try again, providing any log (if it's different).\n\nAlso, what is your `echo $GOPATH` and `pwd` when you run `godep save` and ends up in the loop. \n. AFAICT your home directory is in dropbox, and it looks symlinked to /Users. What is the output of `echo $HOME`?.\n. Yes. godep uses path based case-insensitive file system path matches. So when you are on your desktop, somehow when you open a terminal to run godep you aren't actually in your $GOPATH (`/Users/sironfoot/Dropbox (Personal)/Development/Tutorials/gocode`), you are instead in `/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/sironfoot/Dropbox (Personal)/Development/Tutorials/gocode/src/dominic/godep-test`. Do you use a context menu in Finder to open a terminal? Or some other method? Basically, how did you get to `/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/sironfoot/Dropbox (Personal)/Development/Tutorials/gocode/src/dominic/godep-test` instead of  `/Users/sironfoot/Dropbox (Personal)/Development/Tutorials/gocode/src/dominic/godep-test`\n. changing your $GOPATH to `/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/sironfoot/Dropbox (Personal)/Development/Tutorials/gocode` should solve the problem. I'm somewhat surprised all of the go tools work as well. I _do_ need to track down why some symlink stuff works and some doesn't though.\n. There is no need to use 'godep go' with the vendor experiment (go1.6 and go1.5 with env var set). It's likely to be removed in the future.\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\n> On Mar 13, 2016, at 22:19, WanliTian notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> godep save can save all dependent packages to vendor directory,but godep go build donot find packages in vendor.\n> \n> how to resolve this?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n.

If you could provide your Godeps/Godeps.json file I may be able to re-construct something. If it's large it will be harder to do though.\n.

Godep looks directly at the environment AND go version. If a `./Godeps/_workspace` exists though it keeps using it and disables the vendor experiment (and warns you about that). Here is the code it uses to determine this: https://github.com/tools/godep/blob/a62a9149e4443308c1574383a5e2b713088e5c58/main.go#L69-L88\n\nPlease see this if you are looking to move an existing Godeps workspace to vendor: https://github.com/tools/godep#migrating-to-vendor\n. @didip I don't really consider #377 a bug per se, at least not as it's stated. It will be \"solved\" by better build tag support though at some point.\n. That or progress as reported by git/hg/bzr.\n. When you say \"installed\" what do you mean? installed into your $GOPATH with `go get` ?\n\nWhat version of `godep`? (run `godep version`). If you are not running v60, please upgrade and try to re-save your deps.\n\ngodep is not adding the _, go is. \n. Can you push a repo that I can use to reproduce this?\n\nIf you run `godep save` do you get any warning about being outside of the $GOPATH? `go` prepends stuff with _ when you are working outside of the $GOPATH (AFAICT).\n. godep does not work with relative imports and they are generally frowned upon toy code. Please make sure you are inside of a $GOPATH.\n.

I need to see about constructing a test case for this, but the above 3 commands are what I have used to ensure everything is as clean as can be.\n. It's probably an invalid go file, likely a temporary editor file. Godep should skip parsing files that start with '.' and it should return parsing errors to the user.

Nested vendor folders only lead to problems in the long run. Most tools un-nest them. godep is a little naive in the way it handles that, but the end result is the same.\n. @donhcd Aa(B.Btype) can't be called because it's really A/vendor/B.Btype. Also what happens when you use a B and the project vendors a different B and then returns something of it's B.BType? Your projects B.Btype != A/vendor/B.Btype.\n\nAnd what if A requires a database/sql driver an you go to use the same driver? You'll get a panic.\n\nre vendor inside of internal packages. It doesn't solve all the problems and IMO I don't think we should ever vendor anything inside of internal packages.\n. @roylou packages that are libraries should not lock their dependencies to a specific version, but need to specify ranges that are known to work. There are several attempts in go land to implement this in the different tools and I'm waiting to see what people adopt. My favorite ATM is what dave chenney is doing with GB's depfile https://github.com/constabulary/gb/tree/master/depfile\n. godep's goal is to produce a single, top level vendor folder. See the convo in #444 as to why.\n. @galeone See #451, which was merged as v61.\n. Hmm. 'fmt' is a stdlib package and should be easily found. Is your go install special in any way? How was it installed? Are symlinks involved?\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\n> On Apr 21, 2016, at 06:40, David Dollar notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> I'm getting a similar error to @galeone .

Can your provide a link to a copy of the output from `godep save -d -v <pkg spec> >log 2>&1` ? The output may be huge, so it may not attach here.\n. @stroborobo `go get` obeys local arch. Since code can be deployed to different architectures godep looks at all dependencies. So when you `godep save` cross arch deps may be missing. I'm not sure what the best solution to that is.\n. @stroborobo my comment was wrt third party packages, not the stdlib. godep relies on the $GOPATH reguardless of installation method. As I mentioned above I wasn't able to replicate this with the \"same install\", meaning I removed my own godep / go and installed them via homebrew. Furthermore I was trying to clarify how godep analyzes packages. It always relies on $GOPATH, but can pull in extra transitive deps across architectures vs. `go get`. This is important if you develop on OSX, but deploy to Linux, which is a very common case.\n. If $GOPATH/github.com/stroborobo/myfmt isn't there then you will get not found because the package isn't in $GOPATH. The way godep currently works is that to update / save deps the packages need to be in the $GOPATH, even if they are already saved. This is for various reasons.\n\nRe: `go get`. Yes and No. Yes, in that `go get` fetches all the source code for your current os/architecture. No, in that the same code can require additional transitive dependencies on different os/architectures. I'm not sure if that's what happened here, but it's likely.\n. @stroborobo Maybe I should treat it as a bug. \n. @hadv context is part of go1.7 and therefore requires tip or a go1.7 build.\n. @hadv what version of godep are you using? I added support for handling go version build tags a few months ago, so this should work if the lib you are importing is conditionally importing context behind a build flag (unless your godep version is old). \n\nOtherwise the package you are using is just blankly importing context no matter of go version and the package needs to be fixed.\n. @Gnouc does anything use it transitively ? \n@jingweno I can't replicate, can you provide a step by step reproducer using go1.7rc3 and a clean gopath?\n@tejasmanohar This issue talks about several different problems AFAICT, can you be more specific?\n. Sounds like a problem with the version of go you are using or your install\nof go.\n\nOn Thu, Jul 21, 2016 at 5:44 PM Tejas Manohar notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> $ godep save ./...\n> godep: Package (encoding/json) not found\n> \n> \u2014\n> You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/tools/godep/issues/447#issuecomment-234425413, or mute\n> the thread\n> https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAAAZ_T-Xln2rTvM4TS1bxTwY2RgKmNkks5qYBJXgaJpZM4H-fKt\n> .\n. `godep save -d -v nvidia-docker/nvidia` is telling godep to analyze and\nsave the deps for the `nvidia-docker/nvidia` package.

It does, but you should consider migrating to [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) or [govendor](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor) instead.. What version of godep? Versions of godep (circa v41+, I would need to check the changelog for the specific version) process all .go files, except for those with \"ignore\" and \"appengine\" build tags. Adding go version build tags shouldn't be that hard since we also store the major go version in the Godeps.json file though.\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\n> On Apr 5, 2016, at 10:17, Cannibal Vox notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> It's worse than that- deleting go17.go wont' help because it actually refused to read pre_go17.go.

Looks like go1.7 includes a package named \"context\" and if you are not on 1.7 (really devel) then godep can't find the package because you don't actually have it.\n. Can anyone test out the branch that I pushed for this (See #451) ? I tested it here, but it's late and I don't want to merge it before reviewing it in the morning (and/or getting other +1s).\n. Thanks everyone, this should now be fixed.\n. Closing in favor of #451 for now.\n\nThanks for taking the time to take a stab at this though.\n. Merged as 35ee059b4e6c3df99fb6afc2d3b0f0790b22e1c1\n. Ugh. I'm not sure how to ask the `go` command if it's go1.7 or not while it's in \"devel\" mode.\n. I could at this point just assume that anything that reports \"devel\" is go1.7 though.\n. The go tool uses a build.Context.ReleaseTags slice and `go1.7` has been added in devel. To take a \"guess\" at this I could compile/run this code with the current `go` version and take the left most element of the array. This is likely to work, until the go team changes the order of this slice for any random reason.\n\n``` go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n  \"fmt\"\n  \"go/build\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n  fmt.Println(build.Default.ReleaseTags[len(build.Default.ReleaseTags)-1])\n}\n```\n\nThat's super fragile, but so is having to say deal with what the definition of \"devel\" is.\n\nThoughts?\n. I could also parse the date returned by version in the devel case and hard code in the dates the tree was opened. This may then break every major cycle though.\n. Longer term, yes, by removing the need to `godep restore`. A go tooling change recently (go1.6) made this a problem AFAIK.\n. PS: godep restore is doing what it's always done, restore the recorded versions to the $GOPATH. it can only do this by checking out the various shas (AFAIK) it's recorded.\n\nAs a temp work around I could implement a `godep unrestore`, which would check out master again. But I'm hesitant to add another command that should be removed in the future and I'm not sure it's super helpful in the workflow ... ie. you have to remember to use it.\n\nThoughts?\n. PRs welcome. I don't have an exact commit to golang where this broke. Let me see if I can dig it up though.\n. It was likely this one: https://github.com/golang/go/commit/42206598671a44111c8f726ad33dc7b265bdf669\n. @Raffo What would you suggest be added to the README? It states what `godep restore` already does in a non VCS specific manner, since godep handles multiple types of VCS.\n. How about\n\n**NOTE**: godep restore leaves git repositories in a detached state. `go1.6`\\+ no longer checks out the master branch when doing a `go get`, see [here](https://github.com/golang/go/commit/42206598671a44111c8f726ad33dc7b265bdf669).\n\nThen if you land an `unrestore` PR we can adjust that to recommend the usage of `unrestore` afterwards?\n. @Raffo README / restore help text updated in 584a3f5bf2671886bd3f7dc2b252762b5aa2a087\n. Why does the remote branch matter? I don't think we want to pull new code with unrestore, just check out the local master.\n. It only matters what it's merged to locally AFAIK, so `git config --local branch.master.merge` should tell us what to checkout. \n\nI could totally be wrong here, I don't think I've ever worked with remotes who HEAD was not `master`.\n. I see. If there is only one branch returned from `git config --local --get-regexp 'branch.*'` we could check that out and otherwise punt with instructions to the user to start?\n. I'm not sure I really want to require people to populate that field manually. Also AFAICT RemoteHEAD is detectable through either:\n\n``` console\n$ git remote show origin\n...\nHEAD branch: develop\n...\n```\n\nor\n\n``` console\n$ git branch -r | grep \"origin/HEAD ->\"\n  origin/HEAD -> origin/develop\n```\n\npossibly some other means as well.\n. I'm not sure we should save RemoteHEAD though and just honor the remote head from git info for what's already there.\n. `godep save` takes package paths or files as you point out. It analyzes the package(s) you point it to and determines what dependencies are required based on what is in your $GOPATH. I plan to enhance `godep get <pkg>` to just vendor <pkg> into `vendor/`.\n\nThis along with some other future enhancements should go a long way to removing the need for godep restore, which I also plan to remove.\n. Not really.I really suggest people look into using [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) or [govendor](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor) instead of godep.. It does, although it's a little janky and doesn't work well with the vendor experiment. We use it internally @ Heroku.\n\n`godep save ./... github.com/mattes/migrate` saves both local deps and the main that is `github.com/mattes/migrate`.\n\nJanky parts:\n1. You need to _always_ save both of those.\n2. It doesn't work well with `vendor/` in that you can't then `go install github.com/mattes/migrate`. You have to prefix your local project's package name to it + vendor like so `go install github,com/heroku/project/vendor/github.com/mattes/migrate`. This is a limitation of how the `vendor/` experiment works. If you are using old style godep workspaces then it's simply `godep go install github.com/mattes/migrate`.\n\nDoes that help?\n. Thanks!\n. I assume you resolved the issue?\n. I'll have to see if I can duplicate this with a test. Thanks for the report.\n. @robsix Can you give steps to reproduce?\n. Oops, linked wrong issue.\n. What are the contents of `/Users/aaron/documents/gowork/src/github.com/Throckmortra/ryp` ? What is your `$GOPATH`?\n. Also, does `go install -v .` run / work / install anything?\n. According to the output, godep didn't find any valid go files in `.` (GoFiles is nil)\n. So you either have invalid go files in `.` (syntax error maybe?) or you need to specificy `./...` when you save. \n. v62 was just a doc update.\n. Your $GOPATH is `/Users/aaron/Documents/gowork` and you are in `/Users/aaron/documents/gowork`. So there is still some case related isuses apparently.\n. Hmm. Thanks for the report. I'll have to figure out a way to test this better. I don't think Travis CI has the option for case insensitive filesystems though.\n. Where did you git clone the package to?\n. I believe this ping is part of the golang.org/x/tools/go/vcs package which godep uses.\n. It looks like you have a newer version of golang.org/x/net in your GOPATH. Since godep works off what's in the GOPATH you need to 'godep restore' before saving new deps or this can happen. I'd like to get away from having to do that, but I'm not sure the right UI for it.\n\nThe error / help text should be clearer as well.\n\nThanks for the report.\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\n> On May 5, 2016, at 15:10, Jeff Hodges notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> With godep version: godep v63 (darwin/amd64/go1.6.2)\n> \n> I added some code that added go grpc to my repository (and so, golang.org/x/net/http2 was added).\n> \n> But then godep save failed and the godep update it told me that there was nothing for it to do:\n> \n> $  godep save ./go/...\n> godep: cannot save golang.org/x/net/http2 at revision 7e42c0e1329bb108f7376a7618a2871ab90f1c4d: already have golang.org/x/net/context at revision 35ec611a141ee705590b9eb64d673f9e6dfeb1ac.\n> Run `godep update golang.org/x/net/context' first.\n> $  godep update golang.org/x/net/context\n>  godep: no packages can be updated\n> Here's a quick grep of my Godeps.json:\n> \n> $  cat Godeps/Godeps.json  | grep -A 1 'x/net'\n>             \"ImportPath\": \"golang.org/x/net/context\",\n> \n> ##             \"Rev\": \"35ec611a141ee705590b9eb64d673f9e6dfeb1ac\"\n> \n> ```\n>         \"ImportPath\": \"golang.org/x/net/context/ctxhttp\",\n>         \"Rev\": \"35ec611a141ee705590b9eb64d673f9e6dfeb1ac\"\n> ```\n> \n> ## \n> \n> ```\n>         \"ImportPath\": \"golang.org/x/net/html\",\n>         \"Rev\": \"35ec611a141ee705590b9eb64d673f9e6dfeb1ac\"\n> ```\n> \n> ## \n> \n> ```\n>         \"ImportPath\": \"golang.org/x/net/html/atom\",\n>         \"Rev\": \"35ec611a141ee705590b9eb64d673f9e6dfeb1ac\"\n> ```\n> \n> Running go get -u -a golang.org/x/net/... per a comment in #335 and trying save and update again changed nothing.\n> \n> \u2014\n> You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n. I am in the middle of [rewritting](https://github.com/tools/godep/pull/462) update, so let's see if I can also tackle some of this ...\n\nI'm not sure what you mean wrt \"recording the path\". I'm not familiar with gvt, so I'll have to play with it. FWIW: Go packages are path based already. There is code in godep to figure out the root repo for a given package, so godep already has that info. It's just the way things are stringed together right now is sub optimal.\n\nBefore you did a `go get -u -a` did you do a `godep restore`?\n\nBasically I'm trying to figure out a starting state to replicate this issue.\n. PS: Thanks for the report. ;-) \n. Yeah. that's why you need to `godep restore` before saving new deps and/or updating deps. Basically the workflow (both fortunately and unfortunately) is:\n\n``` console\n$ godep restore\n$ cd $GOPATH/src/<package you want to update>\n$ git checkout master\n$ git pull origin master (or checkout whatever you want to update to)\n$ cd $GOPATH/src/<package I am working on>\n$ godep update <package you want to update>/... (most likely need the /... atm)\n```\n\nAnd yes, that kinda sucks.\n\nI am thinking of side-stepping this with a `godep get <package>[@<version/sha>` command, which would just pull the package directly into `vendor/` (or the workspace), including deps. It <version/sha> would default to `origin/HEAD` unless specified. There is already a `godep get`, but it's a small, almost useless wrapper around `go get`.\n\nThoughts?\n. This is because of this: https://github.com/golang/go/commit/42206598671a44111c8f726ad33dc7b265bdf669\n\nThis doesn't \"fix\" anything for non godep users, just allows godep restore to work properly.\n. This came up in #453\n. The workflow for godep update is to first `godep restore`, then checkout the version of the package you want to update to, then update.\n. I agree. I thought there was a test for this, but maybe not. \n\nSent from my iPhone\n\n> On May 12, 2016, at 08:58, Amir Abu Shareb notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> I see, is there a workaround at all?\n> \n> Seems to me that godep <pkg> should update a single package and it's dependencies and not error if another package does not exists, is there a reason for this workflow that i'm missing?\n> \n> Would love to work on a fix if you're interested :)\n> \n> \u2014\n> You are receiving this because you commented.\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n. `godep` and `go get` can't work the same way. `go get` only pulls dependencies for the current architecture. `godep` needs to get all dependencies, across all OS, so that when a developer is working on OS Y the code can be deployed to OS Z. This is pretty common (I for one do most development on OSX, but most deployments to Linux).\n\nI do plan to add a field to Godeps.json to either blacklist or whitelist OS / build tags, but that is not done yet.\n. `go get` will also fetch any missing dependencies required to build packageX. This is the same as godep. `godep` will only scan dependencies for packages required by the package spec provided to `godep save`.\n\nWhat version of godep are you using? Older versions of godep were more \"liberal\".\n. ``` console\n$ cd ~/go/src/github.com\n$ mkdir jmhodges\n$ cd jmhodges\n$ git clone https://github.com/jmhodges/howsmyssl.git\nCloning into 'howsmyssl'...\nremote: Counting objects: 1283, done.\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (61/61), done.\nremote: Total 1283 (delta 28), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 1216\nReceiving objects: 100% (1283/1283), 800.82 KiB | 324.00 KiB/s, done.\nResolving deltas: 100% (727/727), done.\nChecking connectivity... done.\n$ cd howsmyssl\n$ ls\nDockerfile                            allow_test.go                         howsmyssl-gcloud-credentials.json.enc static\nLICENSE                               client_info.go                        howsmyssl.go                          templates\nREADME.md                             config                                index_test.go                         tls\nall_suites.go                         conn.go                               insecure_suites.go                    travis_docker_push.sh\nallow.go                              gzip                                  stat_writer.go                        vendor\n$ git checkout test_allow\nBranch test_allow set up to track remote branch test_allow from origin.\nSwitched to a new branch 'test_allow'\n$ go get -u golang.org/x/net/publicsuffix\n$ godep save ./...\n$ cat Godeps/Godeps.json\n{\n    \"ImportPath\": \"github.com/jmhodges/howsmyssl\",\n    \"GoVersion\": \"devel-8f48efb\",\n    \"GodepVersion\": \"v67\",\n    \"Packages\": [\n        \"./...\"\n    ],\n    \"Deps\": [\n        {\n            \"ImportPath\": \"golang.org/x/net/publicsuffix\",\n            \"Rev\": \"ef00b378c73f107bf44d5c9b69875255ce89b79a\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nInterestingly `golang.org/x/net/publicsuffix` isn't in vendor though. \n\nLooking more into why that is.\n.

Please update godep and try again, there are some update fixes recently.\nWRT save removing everything. This is because godep was unable to find any deps for the provided package spec (defaults to '.'). So either (a) save was run w/o the right package spec, (b) some weird symlink issue, (c) another filesystem case bug.\n.

This needs to be fixed in the same way it was fixed for git. Resolving the symlink isn't acceptable. If mercurial is resolving the symlink then we need to change the behavior of mercurial to provide a path w/o resolving the symlinks for us. See also: https://github.com/tools/godep/commit/446e2f61cbc0bfa616de9b4b0cf6271945704a77\n. ditto and mercurial is horribly untested inside of godep. ;-) I'll see if I can take a look later.\n. You can (and arguably should) do those change in a branch and commit them. `git checkout {{commit}}` would then work. Why not modify your vendored copy?\n. I'd much rather do this by making [this](https://github.com/tools/godep/blob/master/list.go#L22) configurable via an array in Godps.json. Plus ensure that our code handles all the various permutations of build tags. And maybe default to what is hard coded now.\n. When a repo is git pushed to remote that has no source, how will that remote build the source w/o hitting the network?\n. If you are looking for that feature, please see [govendor](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor/blob/master/doc/faq.md#q-how-do-i-prevent-vendor-source-from-being-checked-in). PS: If you migrate to govendor, please don't use it's migrate command. I suggest instead doing:\n\n``` console\n$ godep restore\n$ rm -rf Godeps vendor\n$ govendor init\n$ govendor add +ex\n```\n. @cleung2010 `godep restore` doesn't use the contents of `vendor/` it's sole job is to fetch what is described in `Godeps.json` into `$GOPATH`. \n. @cleung2010 Great! FWIW: My recommendation would be [govendor](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor).\n. godep save looks at existing code to determine what packages should be saved and then copies those packages from your $GOPATH into a vendor directory. It's telling you that those packages aren't available in $GOPATH. `godep save` does not download any missing dependencies. Maybe a switch to do so would be useful? \n. This is because github.com/hpcloud/tail vendors a a version of gopkg.in/fsnotify.v1 that doesn't import golang.org/x/sys/unix. But godep flattens vendor folders and pulls up the dependency, so that there is only a single top level vendor directory. This required a version of gopkg.in/fsnotify.v1 be installed in the $GOPATH. The version vendored in hpcloud/tail is \"7be54206639f256967dd82fa767397ba5f8f48f5\" (1.2.1), while the version vendored in node-problem-detector is \"30411dbcefb7a1da7e84f75530ad3abe4011b4f8\".\n. At some point godep should start taking a look at the versions of vendored deps and throwing an error if they (a) conflict or (b) what it would copy would be different.\n. Thanks for the report!\n\nI don't think there is a test for that. I'll check and add one if there isn't and see if I can get it passing.\n\nThe easiest way to do this atm is:\n\n``` console\n$ godep restore -v\n$ rm -rf Godeps vendor\n$ godep save <pkg spec>\n$ git commit -av\n```\n\nThe `restore` downloads and checks out your project's deps into $GOPATH. This makes it so that when you save again you get the same version of the deps re-saved. Anything that is no longer necessary won't be saved. Also any new tweaks to the save process are applied if you are using the latest godep (perms, stricter package matching, etc). I suggest upgrading to the latest version of godep before doing any of this.\n. It is indeed. Thanks!\n. I'll likely add an \"origin\" field to each dep instead. That's probably not the _best_ for your use case, but probably more generally applicable. Thoughts on that?\n. Thanks!\n. Would an \"origin\" field referencing the full path to a different repo location be acceptable (this is what vendor.json does)? \n\nSo you would have something like this to \"alias\" the package `github.com/heroku/slog` from the location `github.com/freeformz/slog`.\n\n``` json\n...\n\"Deps\": [\n  {\n    \"ImportPath\": \"github.com/heroku/slog\",\n    \"Origin\": \"github.com/freeformz/slog\",\n    \"Rev\": \"abcdefg\"\n  }\n]\n...\n```\n\nrestore would also have to add the other remote somehow and also fetch from there.

What does your Godeps.json file look like ?\n. I can't reproduce this. When I require \"github.com/prometheus/common/expfmt\" and godep save I get \"github.com/prometheus/common/internal/bitbucket.org/ww/goautoneg\" vendored. Can you explain which dep requires this? Is it vendored there? Do you have the same version vendored there on your GOPATH?\n. If you ran `go get github.com/tools/godep`, is $GOPATH/bin in your $PATH ? Sounds like it isn't.\n. They are using the older style Godep workspace w/o rewrites, so run `godep restore` before running any go commands (or use `godep go <cmd>`).\n. godep just shells out to git. Are you sure that git is working because of .netrc or cached stuff in a local .git?\n. I'll have to setup a bitbucket private repo to rest this out, will probably take a bit because @ Gophercon.\n. In the meantime, could you provide the complete output of -d ?\n. So this is the problem: https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/go/vcs/vcs.go#L668 The golang/tools/vcs stuff that godep uses doesn't use .netrc at all. I wonder if they would accept a patch to support .netrc. That's probably unlikely. Of course the go tooling doesn't work the same way either. :-( \n. See also: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/16315\n. BTW: You should not need to `go get` or `godep restore` any vendored deps (assuming the use of `vendor/`) before running `go install`. If you do, there is a problem somewhere.\n. So I would recommend removing the following lines:\n\n``` console\nRUN go get github.com/segmentio/go-loggly # Dependency from the logging app\nRUN go get bitbucket.org/frobl/logging # Use go get here\n```\n\nand changing the last run line to\n\n``` console\nRUN go install\n```\n\nThis assumes using `vendor/``\n. It is there for historic purposes (people using workspaces) and a few different advanced uses. The only thing `godep restore` does is to make the packages in your $GOPATH reflect what is in Godeps.json. Since those packages are already in `vendor/` and the go tool supports vendoring (go 1.5+), there is no `godep restore` required as the required code is already in `vendor/`.\n. Does this help? https://github.com/tools/godep/blob/master/FAQ.md#should-i-use-godep-restore\n. I also edited the readme around restore a little as well.\n. Looks legit to me. ;-) \n. This is confirmed and strange. I am out most of today through monday though.\n. My next step is to `godep save -v -d ./... &> log` and walk through the log to see why this is happening.\n. I am really not sure what is going on here. I will have to look deeper when I get back from vacation on tuesday. Your existing work around LGTM for now. Sorry.\n. No, this is a bug.\n\nOn Wed, Aug 10, 2016 at 1:24 AM David Mohl notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> I am also not sure whether this is normal beahvior or a bug.

Blinly checking out master isn't a good thing, but probably works in the 90% case. I'd argue that the appropriate place to fix this is to have `go get` determine the remote head and check that out when not already on that branch when doing a `go get -u`.  godep already has logic to do that because it needs to check out the correct default head when updating to ensure the correct sha is present.\n\nAlso my goal, although I don't know if I'll ever get to it, is to remove the need to ever godep restore.\n\nThoughts?\n. This PR changes much more than that though. Please remove the other changes or describe why they were necessary.\n. I don't know the history. Tool late to change now really.

They are probably additional transitive deps that godep picks up that go\nbuild does not consider because godep includes all deps across all build\ntags. This is so that people can develop on one OS and build on another. I\nwould suggest giving `govendor` a try, which has an additional `ignore`\nfield in it's vendor.json file that can tweak this.

Re: maintenance mode, throw up some PRs. ;-) . Thanks!. Godep ignores build tags (except [ignore and appengine](https://github.com/tools/godep/blob/master/list.go#L22)), so I'm not sure why this is happening.. With that said, I was able to [reproduce](https://github.com/freeformz/godeptags) this. :-( . Ugh. I did. I really need to write a `make release`.\r\n\r\nThanks!. Yeah. sorry, although I won't promise to not do that again. IMO tags are mutable and should be treated as such, although I do agree that doing so should be discouraged.. It may be huge, but can you provide the output of `godep save -d -v ./... &> output` ?. It looks like the change to stop using build.ImportDir in the code that handles './...' and the like is returning stuff above the current directory. There probably aren't tests for that specific issue, but I expected the existing tests to cover them. I'll have to dig more to figure out why.. Fixed. Sorry about that. [Silly](https://github.com/tools/godep/commit/f15f6db5da33a4ac48be83e20b9dd838e14f117b) mistake. :-(. Something is likely wrong with your go install as this is just calling a stdlib function of the log package.. This is by design. godep only records go packages and any license files it can find.\r\n\r\nPossible work arounds:\r\n\r\n1. Make `dict` and `deps` (or their sub directories) actual go packages and have `gojieba` _ import them and they will be picked up.\r\n1. Use a tool such as [go-bindata](https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata) to embed the info into a go package as binary data. There are tools other than go-bindata as well.. This seems wrong to me on BlueMix's part.\r\n\r\nThe ImportPath recorded is the package name of the project you are saving dependencies for. If you send the code to them and they use the app name as the package name then code that uses sub packages will break as the names are different. For instance, your application is located in the package named `github.com/olliephillips/test`, which is stored in `$GOPATH/src/github.com/olliephillips/test`. Let's say `github.com/olliephillips/test` imports `github.com/olliephillips/test/lib/stuff` but Bluemix actually puts the code in `$GOPATH/src/gohelloworld` when it's compiling the software. The import will break unless BlueMix also looks through your code and fixes up imports. And even then, panics, traces and error messages will also be changed.\r\n\r\nMaybe Bluemix is doing something different, IDK, but this seems strange to me.\r\n\r\nPS: This isn't really a bug with godep, so I'm going to close this, sorry. If Bluemix support would like to weigh in please have them re-open this issue. Thx.. That's not a valid Godeps.json file because the package specified is not a valid go package declaration because it (a) contains no valid *.go files and (b) the packages contained there are actually `golang.org/x/tools`. So if the file is changed to:\r\n\r\n```go\r\n{\r\n  \"ImportPath\": \"github.com/tools/godep\",\r\n  \"GoVersion\": \"go1.7\",\r\n  \"Deps\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"ImportPath\": \"golang.org/x/tools/cover\",\r\n      \"Rev\": \"3fe2afc9e626f32e91aff6eddb78b14743446865\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`godep restore` works properly because the correct namespace for the code is `golang.org/x/tools` and `golang.org/x/tools/cover` is an actual go package.\r\n\r\nPS: This may have worked in previous versions of godep, but that was purely by accident..

I follow, feel free to close when you merge #23\n. :+1:\n. FYI this is probably out of date post #35\n. I like the higher granularity and more explicit references to what you're actually importing and depending on.  I don't mind the \"overhead\" in the manifest at all.\n\nDo you think theres a possibility that the duplication could be construed as implying that those two dependent packages could be pinned to _different_ hashes?  Should this be an explicit error condition if they diverge?\n\nEven more radical, should the manifest (for each dependent repo) record the root, pinned hash, and an array of dependent import paths instead?

I follow, feel free to close when you merge #23\n. :+1:\n. FYI this is probably out of date post #35\n. I like the higher granularity and more explicit references to what you're actually importing and depending on.  I don't mind the \"overhead\" in the manifest at all.\n\nDo you think theres a possibility that the duplication could be construed as implying that those two dependent packages could be pinned to _different_ hashes?  Should this be an explicit error condition if they diverge?\n\nEven more radical, should the manifest (for each dependent repo) record the root, pinned hash, and an array of dependent import paths instead? Your example above becomes:\n\n``` json\n        {\n            \"RepoRoot\": \"github.com/crowdmob/goamz\",\n            \"Rev\": \"9bee4d46f8a986ae73c9c05e7359e940f9ffa80c\",\n            \"ImportPaths\": [\n                \"github.com/crowdmob/goamz/aws\",\n                \"github.com/crowdmob/goamz/sqs\"\n            ]\n        }\n```\n\nDoes this make it more obvious that there is a single repo that we depend on but we only import the specified subset of packages?

    "dmitshur": "**Edit:** I would like to retract my +1, I no longer want this.\n\nThe few good libraries I care about that used to be on Launchpad have moved to GitHub by now.\n. Yeah, it seems odd that `godep` itself doesn't have a way of printing its version (build date).\n\nWhen debugging some problem where it works for me but not for someone else (or vice versa), the first thing I want to ask is \"what version of godep are you running?\"\n. There's a related issue (from Jan 2014) with discussion here:\n\nhttps://github.com/jimmyfrasche/goutil/issues/2\n\nWe made a post on golang-nuts to try to motivate improving the situation upstream in Go, but it did not catch much attention:\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-nuts/Z5uJf6mEF6E/K7yb6Xc5zQUJ\n\nIt was suggested to me by minux to make the thread in golang-dev (since Russ was away at the time), which I did, but it didn't get any traction either:\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-dev/svxuGkGJTD8\n\n(Just mentioning relevant links here. I am extremely familiar with this issue and would really like to see it fixed, because it forces me to avoid installing my packages and thus lose benefits of faster compilation, auto completion, etc.)\n. ### Summary\n\n@fkautz, it may be quite difficult to come up with a patch that addresses the problem but doesn't create additional problems in edge cases.\n\n### Details\n\nThe difficulty comes from having to consider _all_ edge cases - the `go` command has to deal with a lot. Most of those edge cases are less common, but still valid conditions where the `go` command is expected to behave correctly. An example would be building Go from source. In some cases, the `go` command needs to write to GOROOT workspace, in most other cases it should not.\n\nIt would require very careful consideration of all edge cases and planning, and seeing if it's possible to change the behavior such that this problem is resolved without compromising anything. If that can be done, I would imagine they would accept such a patch (after very thorough review).\n\nAt some point I had plans to try to do that, by making a fork of the `go` tool, making the changes I would want, and seeing if everything works out. I haven't gotten around to doing that (and I don't have short term plans to do it atm).\n\nIn the end, it may end up being trivial - or impossible. You can only find out after starting the work. It's quite hard to predict.\n. This issue has been resolved in Go 1.5. See https://github.com/golang/go/issues/10509.\n. +1.\n\n> What problem is this meant to solve?\n\nIt can help answer \"what version of godep am I/someone else running? Do I/that other person need to run `go get -u github.com/kr/godep`?\"\n. That is a problem that I've thought about for some time, but so far I still haven't come up with anything better than just manually modifying some const in one of the package's .go files (it only needs to be done for final releases that go into master branch though, so if you dev on a feature branch, it can be a last commit before a PR merge).\n. Just leaving a comment here as I've witnessed yet another instance where having a version command would've helped detect a problem sooner for people. The person had the latest source of godep, but the installed binary was out of date and for some reason `go get -u github.com/tools/godep` did not update the binary (until it was removed and installed again).\n\nAlso, it's possible to set blank strings in Go via a linker flag, see http://technosophos.com/2014/06/11/compile-time-string-in-go.html article. Unfortunately, that will not be acceptable, because it requires the flag to be provided when building the binary, so it's not compatible with users doing `go get -u github.com/tools/godep`.\n. > Haven't looked at the code yet, but +1 to the new command and behavior change.\n\nSame here, +1 to the new command and behavior change.\n. You should read some guide on how to use `godep`, what you're expecting isn't how it works. (I would link to the readme, but it doesn't really talk about the `godep save --copy=false` usage model, so it's not applicable.)\n\nUnless you do `godep restore`, godep doesn't touch your GOPATH workspace. Instead, it creates a temporary virtual GOPATH workspace and checks out the specified versions there. If you use `godep path` command, it will print the path of that temporary virtual GOPATH workspace. That's where the correct revisions will be checked out (and used by the `go ...` command when you do `godep go ...`).\n\n**Edit:** Actually, I could be wrong. What I said applies to older versions of godep, back when doing `godep get` was nonsensical. Perhaps by now `godep get` does do something like what you described - since I see issue #13 is closed. Sorry.\n. This PR seems reasonable to me.\n. I'm not sure what's up, but this repo has not seen any activity aside from people reporting issues in a long while.\n\n@kr Are you getting notifications about this? He does have public commits as recent as 11 hours ago.\n. This issue prevents godep from working in some cases:\n\n``` bash\n$ godep save\ngodep: Godeps/_workspace/src/golang.org/x/tools/go/loader/testdata/badpkgdecl.go:1:34: expected 'package', found 'EOF'\n```\n\nIt should not be reading .go files inside testdata folder!\n\n**Edit:** This may be a separate (albeit related) issue.\n\nActually, it is related. The problem is that the workspace was _already_ created with an existing version of `godep` which mistakenly included the testdata folder. If a new (fixed) version of godep were used, that testdata folder would be skipped, and this problem wouldn't occur.\n. There's a PR #166 that fixes this issue, can it be reviewed and merged please?\n. For reference, this issue was resolved in commit bb418303c7e0886d29a75b5bbec49b64cdc3fa1c, not closed as \"wontfix\".\n\n(As a side note, if you had used one of the [supported keywords](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/#keywords-for-closing-issues) like \"resolves\", \"fixes\" or \"closes\", that would've been clearer. \"addresses\" is not one of the supported keywords.)\n. LGTM because it fixes the issue, but I would copy and paste the way the Go tool does this exactly, instead of using a different syntax. That way it's easier to keep it in sync with any future changes to the Go tool.\n\n``` Go\n// Avoid .foo, _foo, and testdata directory trees, but do not avoid \".\" or \"..\".\nelem := w.Stat().Name()\ndot := strings.HasPrefix(elem, \".\") && elem != \".\" && elem != \"..\"\nif dot || strings.HasPrefix(elem, \"_\") || elem == \"testdata\" {\n    w.SkipDir()\n}\n```\n\nSource: https://github.com/golang/go/blob/dc870d5f4b77c0a2a276f8fd12510a53969c56b5/src/cmd/go/main.go#L616-L619\n. Actually, this may not fix issue, looking into it.\n. Okay, I've done some testing regarding https://github.com/tools/godep/issues/140#issuecomment-98222302, and this fix works. But it's not retroactive. Workspaces saved with older godep will need to be removed and recreated using new version, which will skip over testdata folder and avoid the issue in the future.\n. Actually, I will retract my LGTM and say -1, I'd prefer this not be merged as is.\n\nI think what it fixes is a symptom, not the real cause. It should be okay to vendor `testdata` folders, the issue is that they shouldn't be navigated into when listing Go packages and causing errors since `testdata` folders may purposefully (correctly) contain .go files that are invalid Go code.\n\nThat issue should  be fixed first, then perhaps `testdata` folders should be skipped when vendoring also. After all, folders starting with `.` and `_` are already skipped.\n\nI'll try to look into this more closely in some time.\n.

Any feedback on this change?\n. I don't remember what the underlying problem was exactly when I ran into this. I think either the repository was deleted and no longer existed upstream. Or perhaps just the commit wasn't found and that produced the error.\n\nThe main problem was that I had no way of knowing what package even had the problem. This small change resolves that.\n\nI agree that it'd be nicer still to decorate the error returned from `download` to include more info on the error (such as stderr), but I think that can be a separate PR.\n. I think this PR can/should be merged since it's a strict improvement over the previous behavior, where it was completely impossible to know which package had download/restore problems.\n\nAny reason not to?\n. > I tried to use build.Context to handle most of the grunt work, but that didn't work out that well.\n\nCan you elaborate on that please, I'd like to learn what the problem with that approach was.\n. Thanks for mentioning `gostatus` here @client9, it's indeed very relevant.\n\nI agree this can and should (at least initially) be done outside. If wanted, it can be later brought inside.\n\nIn addition to `gostatus`, I'd highly recommend @awsmsrc to take a look at [Go Package Store](https://github.com/shurcooL/Go-Package-Store#go-package-store--). It adds a visual presentation of commits on top of `gostatus` minimal output. It also supports a `-godeps` flag to specify a Godeps.json file to use as \"base\" versions, e.g.:\n\n``` bash\n$ Go-Package-Store -godeps=/path/to/some/Godeps.json\nReading the list of Go packages from Godeps.json file: /path/to/some/Godeps.json\n...\n```\n. @freeformz Thanks.

I'm hoping to have that merged into master soon, but just in case.\n. That does look related.\n\nIt sounds like this is WAI.

    "rliebling": "I did a little hacking to get this to work and identified two barriers to supporting this alternate layout.\n1.  in dep.go (from this package) the calls to VCSFromDir pass the `src` directory as the toplevel directory at which to stop searching for version control info (eg a `.git/` dir).  That is, it invokes:\n\n```\n_, reporoot, err := VCSFromDir(p.Dir, filepath.Join(p.Root, \"src\"))\n```\n\nwhere p is a package.  In my hacking i changed the second arg to `VCSFromDir` to just '/'.  But, this may be bad for various reasons.  (I didn't really think about it; just wanted to see if i could make things work)\n2.  After making that change, there was a second problem.  In `code.google.com/p/go/go.tools/go/vcs/vcs.go` the `FromDir` method executes:\n\n```\n    if len(dir) <= len(srcRoot) || dir[len(srcRoot)] != filepath.Separator {\n        return nil, \"\", fmt.Errorf(\"directory %q is outside source root %q\", dir, srcRoot)\n    }\n```\n\nBut, this fails when `srcRoot` is just '/'.  Not sure why they check it this way, but replacing it with (what I think is better):\n\n```\n    if strings.HasPrefix(dir, srcRoot) {\n        return nil, \"\", fmt.Errorf(\"directory %q is outside source root %q\", dir, srcRoot)\n    }\n```\n\nresolves that issue.  But, this code is not directly under the control of godeps...\n\nAnyway, i'm not sure what the best solution is here.  But, as i did hack my way through to find the issues, i wanted to share them here.  I would like to see this resolved.\n. @kr I'm not sure i understand your comment about it not being a standard go workspace.  I think what we're talking about is just where the root of the version control repo lies (eg - where does .git live).  The issue arises when the VCS root lies outside/above the `src` directory.  I don't really think that the \"standard go workspace\" really does or should care about that.  The only time it matters, i think, to the go tool chain is whether the code in this particular repo is `go get`-able.\n\nIn my particular case, the go code i'm dealing with is but one part of a bigger repo where i have reasons to want the go code versioned together with the rest of the repo.  (and, don't want to deal with git submodules or such alternatives).  Within this repo i'd like to be able to build the go tool by just changing to the appropriate subdirectory, setting `export GOPATH=$PWD`, and running `godep go install github.com/foo/bar`\n\nAnyway, i understand if you don't want to support such situations, although I think it would be a good addition.\n. @kr Thanks!  It sounds like it should, at least to the extent i understand it.  However, i have checked out your branch and tried it and still get errors.  But, I may well not be doing it right :)\n\nI've pushed a trivial example demonstrating my basic setup; please see https://github.com/rliebling/godep_example\n\nThe readme explains what i've tried.  \n. @kr - thanks for the suggestions on proper workspace layout and links to the twitter status with several examples.  I understand and accept that my layout is not the intended way a go project should be organized.  And, I will certainly continue to think about possible changes.  To my thinking, though, the issue is that I think of my repo not as a go project with other files, but as a non-Go project, one small piece of which is a go program.  In fact, at the subdir I set as my GOPATH, i have a Vagrantfile and Dockerfile to build (and crosscompile) the go project for windows, osx and linux.  (The Vagrantfile allows any team member to do this whichever platform they are using.)  The point is, most of these team members won't even have a Go compiler installed on their dev machine (outside of the docker image that automatically does the work for them).  The setup is so they can git clone the project and simply build the current version of the Go project, for whichever platform, and use that tool to do their work in the larger project.  The recommended layout seems appropriate only when Go is the primary focus of the project.\n\nAnyway, all that aside, i do appreciate your efforts to make this work, especially when we all acknowledge this is to support a non-standard, non-recommended layout.\n\nBack to my example demonstrating the problem, the point is that godep needs to figure out what to do with the github.com/rliebling/dep package.  I understand that to handle the `dep` package properly godep will need to determine that it's in the same repo as the main package.  With that in mind, I can propose a few possibilities (or, what seem to me like possibilities)\n1.  you don't find a VCS root for it, so you omit it from the godeps.json file, possibly only acting this way if some command line argument enables this behavior\n2.  a command line argument adds other, external, directories to be considered as VCS roots.  So, in my example i'd specify '/home/rich/dev/godep_example' and godep would, after vcs.FromDir() returns an error, VCSFromDir would try this other VCS root dir.\n3. You allow the search for VCS roots to go above the `src/` dir, perhaps enabled by having a command line flag to specify a top level directory beyond which it should not search.\n4.  After not finding a VCS root for it, you compare directories and notice that as you recurse up the directory tree searching for the VCS root you end up in the same directory as you do searching for the VCS root of the rootset (destImportPath).  You conclude that this package is already maintained in sync with the rootset pkg (for which you are generating the Godeps.json) - whether by being in the same repo or just neither being version-controlled. \n\nI must admit that I'm only thinking about the `godep save` scenario and don't know the godep code very well at all.

For whatever reasons, good or bad, I don't think that makes sense in my case.  For lack of a better analogy, retructuring the project layout around the tool I'm writing in go feels like having a house where when you enter through the front door you are taken immediately into the laundry room.  It's functional, but it sure feels wrong.\n\nFor Go in general, i think the only real limitation (at least the only one I'm aware of) regarding VCS is for a package to be `go get`-able.  If you don't care that your package can be retrieved automatically by `go get` then Go really does not care where the root of your VCS is.  So, Go is perfectly ok with having its workspace live in a subdirectory of a VCS project.  I understand godep must understand more about the VCS structure and so this issue arises.  \n\nFor me, personally, i'd be perfectly happy with a flag for `godep save` to have godep merely warn about errors finding VCS roots and omit those packages from the Godeps.json file.  This is a trivial fix, but a bit more involved to report which packages were skipped because `dep.Load()` would have to return more data in its errors.  \n. I did a little hacking to get this to work and identified two barriers to supporting this alternate layout.\n1.  in dep.go (from this package) the calls to VCSFromDir pass the `src` directory as the toplevel directory at which to stop searching for version control info (eg a `.git/` dir).  That is, it invokes:\n\n```\n_, reporoot, err := VCSFromDir(p.Dir, filepath.Join(p.Root, \"src\"))\n```\n\nwhere p is a package.  In my hacking i changed the second arg to `VCSFromDir` to just '/'.  But, this may be bad for various reasons.  (I didn't really think about it; just wanted to see if i could make things work)\n2.  After making that change, there was a second problem.  In `code.google.com/p/go/go.tools/go/vcs/vcs.go` the `FromDir` method executes:\n\n```\n    if len(dir) <= len(srcRoot) || dir[len(srcRoot)] != filepath.Separator {\n        return nil, \"\", fmt.Errorf(\"directory %q is outside source root %q\", dir, srcRoot)\n    }\n```\n\nBut, this fails when `srcRoot` is just '/'.  Not sure why they check it this way, but replacing it with (what I think is better):\n\n```\n    if strings.HasPrefix(dir, srcRoot) {\n        return nil, \"\", fmt.Errorf(\"directory %q is outside source root %q\", dir, srcRoot)\n    }\n```\n\nresolves that issue.  But, this code is not directly under the control of godeps...\n\nAnyway, i'm not sure what the best solution is here.  But, as i did hack my way through to find the issues, i wanted to share them here.  I would like to see this resolved.\n. @kr I'm not sure i understand your comment about it not being a standard go workspace.  I think what we're talking about is just where the root of the version control repo lies (eg - where does .git live).  The issue arises when the VCS root lies outside/above the `src` directory.  I don't really think that the \"standard go workspace\" really does or should care about that.  The only time it matters, i think, to the go tool chain is whether the code in this particular repo is `go get`-able.\n\nIn my particular case, the go code i'm dealing with is but one part of a bigger repo where i have reasons to want the go code versioned together with the rest of the repo.  (and, don't want to deal with git submodules or such alternatives).  Within this repo i'd like to be able to build the go tool by just changing to the appropriate subdirectory, setting `export GOPATH=$PWD`, and running `godep go install github.com/foo/bar`\n\nAnyway, i understand if you don't want to support such situations, although I think it would be a good addition.\n. @kr Thanks!  It sounds like it should, at least to the extent i understand it.  However, i have checked out your branch and tried it and still get errors.  But, I may well not be doing it right :)\n\nI've pushed a trivial example demonstrating my basic setup; please see https://github.com/rliebling/godep_example\n\nThe readme explains what i've tried.  \n. @kr - thanks for the suggestions on proper workspace layout and links to the twitter status with several examples.  I understand and accept that my layout is not the intended way a go project should be organized.  And, I will certainly continue to think about possible changes.  To my thinking, though, the issue is that I think of my repo not as a go project with other files, but as a non-Go project, one small piece of which is a go program.  In fact, at the subdir I set as my GOPATH, i have a Vagrantfile and Dockerfile to build (and crosscompile) the go project for windows, osx and linux.  (The Vagrantfile allows any team member to do this whichever platform they are using.)  The point is, most of these team members won't even have a Go compiler installed on their dev machine (outside of the docker image that automatically does the work for them).  The setup is so they can git clone the project and simply build the current version of the Go project, for whichever platform, and use that tool to do their work in the larger project.  The recommended layout seems appropriate only when Go is the primary focus of the project.\n\nAnyway, all that aside, i do appreciate your efforts to make this work, especially when we all acknowledge this is to support a non-standard, non-recommended layout.\n\nBack to my example demonstrating the problem, the point is that godep needs to figure out what to do with the github.com/rliebling/dep package.  I understand that to handle the `dep` package properly godep will need to determine that it's in the same repo as the main package.  With that in mind, I can propose a few possibilities (or, what seem to me like possibilities)\n1.  you don't find a VCS root for it, so you omit it from the godeps.json file, possibly only acting this way if some command line argument enables this behavior\n2.  a command line argument adds other, external, directories to be considered as VCS roots.  So, in my example i'd specify '/home/rich/dev/godep_example' and godep would, after vcs.FromDir() returns an error, VCSFromDir would try this other VCS root dir.\n3. You allow the search for VCS roots to go above the `src/` dir, perhaps enabled by having a command line flag to specify a top level directory beyond which it should not search.\n4.  After not finding a VCS root for it, you compare directories and notice that as you recurse up the directory tree searching for the VCS root you end up in the same directory as you do searching for the VCS root of the rootset (destImportPath).  You conclude that this package is already maintained in sync with the rootset pkg (for which you are generating the Godeps.json) - whether by being in the same repo or just neither being version-controlled. \n\nI must admit that I'm only thinking about the `godep save` scenario and don't know the godep code very well at all.

Basically, dependency pkgs in Godeps/_workspace are shown as Stale with `godep go list`, are rebuilt if you run `godep go install` on them directly, but aren't rebuilt if you run `godep go install` on a pkg that imports them.\n\n`go help install` says: \"Install compiles and installs the packages named by the import paths, along with their dependencies.\" This seems to imply that the same operation should be performed on dependencies as on the named package arguments to `go install`.\n\nMy current guesses are either:\n1. I'm completely misunderstanding what `go install` should do.\n2. There's an special, undocumented way (or that I haven't seen the docs for) in which `go install` treats sub-GOPATHs or GOPATHs with underscore-leading names.\n3. There's a bug in how the go tool treats sub-GOPATHs or GOPATHs with underscore-leading names.\n\nFWIW, go1.4beta1 has the same issue.\n. Following up on this, we experience this 100% of the time when checking out git branches with different files in `Godeps/_workspace/src` (because the old pkg files are there), git pulling commits that change files in `Godeps/_workspace/src`, editing `.go` files in `Godeps/_workspace/src`, etc. It's also something that confuses people we're onboarding. The workaround is to nuke the `Godeps/_workspace/pkg` dir, of course.\n\nThe thing that's kept me from digging into this more (beyond the repro at https://github.com/sqs/godeps-stale-pkg-repro) is that nobody else seems to experience this issue with such regularity. And that makes me suspect that something is different about our setup. For the other folks who have reported this, does this issue occur all of the time, or just occasionally?\n.

In this case, it is not.\n. Always appending `-a` would slow down partial rebuilds, which would be undesirable for us (from a dev speed and iteration POV).\n.

Basically, dependency pkgs in Godeps/_workspace are shown as Stale with `godep go list`, are rebuilt if you run `godep go install` on them directly, but aren't rebuilt if you run `godep go install` on a pkg that imports them.\n\n`go help install` says: \"Install compiles and installs the packages named by the import paths, along with their dependencies.\" This seems to imply that the same operation should be performed on dependencies as on the named package arguments to `go install`.\n\nMy current guesses are either:\n1. I'm completely misunderstanding what `go install` should do.\n2. There's an special, undocumented way (or that I haven't seen the docs for) in which `go install` treats sub-GOPATHs or GOPATHs with underscore-leading names.\n3. There's a bug in how the go tool treats sub-GOPATHs or GOPATHs with underscore-leading names.\n\nFWIW, go1.4beta1 has the same issue.\n. Following up on this, we experience this 100% of the time when checking out git branches with different files in `Godeps/_workspace/src` (because the old pkg files are there), git pulling commits that change files in `Godeps/_workspace/src`, editing `.go` files in `Godeps/_workspace/src`, etc. It's also something that confuses people we're onboarding. The workaround is to nuke the `Godeps/_workspace/pkg` dir, of course.\n\nThe thing that's kept me from digging into this more (beyond the repro at https://github.com/sqs/godeps-stale-pkg-repro) is that nobody else seems to experience this issue with such regularity. And that makes me suspect that something is different about our setup. For the other folks who have reported this, does this issue occur all of the time, or just occasionally?\n. I think I found the root cause:\n\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/blob/906aefb038b6baddc38f165bdfb6ecf624db398d/src/cmd/go/pkg.go#L784-L796\n\n```\n    // Have installed copy, probably built using current compilers,\n    // and built after its imported packages.  The only reason now\n    // that we'd have to rebuild it is if the sources were newer than\n    // the package.   If a package p is not in the same tree as any\n    // package named on the command-line, assume it is up-to-date\n    // no matter what the modification times on the source files indicate.\n    // This avoids rebuilding $GOROOT packages when people are\n    // working outside the Go root, and it effectively makes each tree\n    // listed in $GOPATH a separate compilation world.\n    // See issue 3149.\n    if p.Root != \"\" && !topRoot[p.Root] {\n        return false\n    }\n```\n\nIt refers to https://github.com/golang/go/issues/3149.\n\nI can see why you wouldn't want to recompile $GOROOT packages, but I wonder if the side effect of \"mak[ing] each tree listed in $GOPATH a separate compilation world\" is desirable. In this case, it is not.\n. Always appending `-a` would slow down partial rebuilds, which would be undesirable for us (from a dev speed and iteration POV).\n.

    "ThisGuyCodes": "I have an idea I'm surprised no one has proposed yet.\n\nMany of these dependency pinning tools in some way reference Bundler as inspiration, I know that's what I think of whenever I see or use them. So why not take a page from that book and make a command `godep install`, which does exactly what's needed here: installs the dependencies listed in Godeps.json into the current projects `_workspace`.\n\nI actually think `godep restore`'s functionality makes sense, it's a little ambiguous, so renaming it to `godep export` might make sense, but that's a breaking change so it should at the very least be done slowly (let both work with a deprecation warning for a while). Having `godep go` install dependencies if they're not already present is certainly a thing that could be done, but it's a bit to 'magic' for me. The most I'd be comfortable with there is a check and a warning printed. And I totally agree with @pdf, putting that expensive an operation into `godep path` is a bad idea.\n. I would like to add that I already do this as a shell alias:\n\n``` Bash\nalias godep_install='GOPATH=$(godep path) godep restore'\n```\n\nand it works great. (if anyone wants to use this, it's quite important you use single quotes instead of double quotes, otherwise `godep path` is evaluated at alias creation, and not each time you run it)\n. `GOPATH=$(godep path) $COMMAND`\n\nI don't feel like this is something this tool should be responsible for.\n. @freeformz could you point me in the right direction for information about this `-vendor` option? I did some googling but I seem to be failing to find anything.\n. this problem makes sense, but instead of a blacklist which gets things working via a curated magic list of \"stuff that breaks other commands\", maybe it should be a whitelist of \"this is what we need to do what _we_ do\". That way instead of being responsible for finding every environment variable that might break anything, the tool is only responsible for knowing what environment variables it needs to do _its_ thing(s), and it can be established as a rule that \"commands this runs are isolated from the environment\".\n\nThis idea may also prompt some sort of flag to specify other environment variables to pass through, should someone's need arise to break this isolation.\n. With git and mercurial this could actually be solved by using the respective tool (ie: `git clone $DIRECTORY` instead of copying). I don't know about bzr, but I imagine it's pretty similar. This would mean until you make a commit you can't save the repo into your Godeps.\n\nBut regardless of the more plumbing-style approach suggested above, or this, this alludes to another issue: if you're using a locally edited version of the repo, how does the tool know you're not depending on files that are .gitignored? It doesn't, of course, and it's unrealistic to expect it to.\n\nWith my suggestion, there are four options I see (much of the same concerns are present in the suggestion above as well):\n1.

I have an idea I'm surprised no one has proposed yet.\n\nMany of these dependency pinning tools in some way reference Bundler as inspiration, I know that's what I think of whenever I see or use them. So why not take a page from that book and make a command `godep install`, which does exactly what's needed here: installs the dependencies listed in Godeps.json into the current projects `_workspace`.\n\nI actually think `godep restore`'s functionality makes sense, it's a little ambiguous, so renaming it to `godep export` might make sense, but that's a breaking change so it should at the very least be done slowly (let both work with a deprecation warning for a while). Having `godep go` install dependencies if they're not already present is certainly a thing that could be done, but it's a bit to 'magic' for me. The most I'd be comfortable with there is a check and a warning printed. And I totally agree with @pdf, putting that expensive an operation into `godep path` is a bad idea.\n. I would like to add that I already do this as a shell alias:\n\n``` Bash\nalias godep_install='GOPATH=$(godep path) godep restore'\n```\n\nand it works great. (if anyone wants to use this, it's quite important you use single quotes instead of double quotes, otherwise `godep path` is evaluated at alias creation, and not each time you run it)\n. `GOPATH=$(godep path) $COMMAND`\n\nI don't feel like this is something this tool should be responsible for.\n. @freeformz could you point me in the right direction for information about this `-vendor` option? I did some googling but I seem to be failing to find anything.\n. this problem makes sense, but instead of a blacklist which gets things working via a curated magic list of \"stuff that breaks other commands\", maybe it should be a whitelist of \"this is what we need to do what _we_ do\". That way instead of being responsible for finding every environment variable that might break anything, the tool is only responsible for knowing what environment variables it needs to do _its_ thing(s), and it can be established as a rule that \"commands this runs are isolated from the environment\".\n\nThis idea may also prompt some sort of flag to specify other environment variables to pass through, should someone's need arise to break this isolation.\n. With git and mercurial this could actually be solved by using the respective tool (ie: `git clone $DIRECTORY` instead of copying). I don't know about bzr, but I imagine it's pretty similar. This would mean until you make a commit you can't save the repo into your Godeps.\n\nBut regardless of the more plumbing-style approach suggested above, or this, this alludes to another issue: if you're using a locally edited version of the repo, how does the tool know you're not depending on files that are .gitignored? It doesn't, of course, and it's unrealistic to expect it to.\n\nWith my suggestion, there are four options I see (much of the same concerns are present in the suggestion above as well):\n1. Let it go, if someone does `godep save` with uncommitted code in a dependency they're going to break things, sorry!\n2. Don't support copying local dependencies.\n3. For each tool that's supported, do a check to see if there's uncommitted changes (git status, etc).\n4.

",
    "ronoaldo": "Sorry to \"revive\" this but the comment regarding appengine pacakges beign \"replaced\" is misleading, as the new packages are targeted to Managed VMs, and they provide a layer for compatibility that, once built with App Engine SDK (or with the build flag +appengine), will end up importing appengine/\\* imports as well. Given the fact that App Engine is now out of beta and the classic packages + SDK will follow the deprecation policies, I think this is a real issue.\n\nIf you are working with App Engine and run godep save it will not work. I think that a solution like -omit is nice, but should be also recorded in Godep.json, so it would be recorded in the revision control and help other users working on the same repo/codebase to take advantage of that.\n. Currently, I'm using the `import \"appengine\"` statements on lots of places, including some tools. The way I'm handling vendor on these apps is by vendoring the vendor tool itself: we have a cmd/godep copy that is, basically, a copy from this fork `https://github.com/fredr/godep`, which works out of the box on both cases. The problem is that this causes confusion, as I have to instruct any team member or new collaborator to checkout a different copy o godep to make it work.\n\nAlso, I just noted that if you run `godep` with a `$GOROOT` pointing to the App Engine GOROOT (which I was expecting to work, as the appengine package exists there), it does not. The reason is that `go list -e -json` cannot find any packages at all, since the App Engine SDK `$GOROOT` does not have the `src/pkg` folder; all sources are at the `src/` folder directly (i.e., src/time instead of src/pkg/time).\n\nSo, to sum up my experiences so far:\n- You can't use `github.com/tools/godep` with `import \"appengine\"`\n- Even if you `export $(goapp env)`, you still can't use godep because $GOROOT/src/pkg does not exist.\n- If you have an existing app and want to use godep for vendoring, you have to rewrite a reasonable amount of code to move `import \"appengine\"` to `import \"google.golang.org/appengine\"`\n- You end up vendoring the vendor tool itself, which is where I am at now until I can move to the new packages.\n\nI'm just wondering if there is a better/recommended way to work with both tools, and avoid the confusion that I am having. If the only supported way is the new imports, then let it be - I would suggest that maybe it worth adding this to the documentation.\n\nThe -omit flag may not solve the problem; maybe a special case for appengine/\\* would help everyone, even if transitivelly until the new packages are more widelly addopted.\n. @dsymonds @freeformz @pshevtsov thanks. I am happy that the recommendation is then to move to the new packages, which hence are compatible with `godep`, and that the new App Engine packages are long-term support.\n. Sorry to \"revive\" this but the comment regarding appengine pacakges beign \"replaced\" is misleading, as the new packages are targeted to Managed VMs, and they provide a layer for compatibility that, once built with App Engine SDK (or with the build flag +appengine), will end up importing appengine/\\* imports as well. Given the fact that App Engine is now out of beta and the classic packages + SDK will follow the deprecation policies, I think this is a real issue.\n\nIf you are working with App Engine and run godep save it will not work. I think that a solution like -omit is nice, but should be also recorded in Godep.json, so it would be recorded in the revision control and help other users working on the same repo/codebase to take advantage of that.\n. Currently, I'm using the `import \"appengine\"` statements on lots of places, including some tools. The way I'm handling vendor on these apps is by vendoring the vendor tool itself: we have a cmd/godep copy that is, basically, a copy from this fork `https://github.com/fredr/godep`, which works out of the box on both cases. The problem is that this causes confusion, as I have to instruct any team member or new collaborator to checkout a different copy o godep to make it work.\n\nAlso, I just noted that if you run `godep` with a `$GOROOT` pointing to the App Engine GOROOT (which I was expecting to work, as the appengine package exists there), it does not. The reason is that `go list -e -json` cannot find any packages at all, since the App Engine SDK `$GOROOT` does not have the `src/pkg` folder; all sources are at the `src/` folder directly (i.e., src/time instead of src/pkg/time).\n\nSo, to sum up my experiences so far:\n- You can't use `github.com/tools/godep` with `import \"appengine\"`\n- Even if you `export $(goapp env)`, you still can't use godep because $GOROOT/src/pkg does not exist.\n- If you have an existing app and want to use godep for vendoring, you have to rewrite a reasonable amount of code to move `import \"appengine\"` to `import \"google.golang.org/appengine\"`\n- You end up vendoring the vendor tool itself, which is where I am at now until I can move to the new packages.\n\nI'm just wondering if there is a better/recommended way to work with both tools, and avoid the confusion that I am having.

Ok I think see the code that needs to change, and nifty way of unit testing `cpySrc` @kr\nIm happy to take a stab at this if you want @freeformz (or you can of course too.. not sure what other work is in progress)\n. Ok, not soo bad.  It's a bit tricky since things are working in filesystem paths, but this seems to work.\n\nFor each dependency, it walks backwards grabbing any license files, until it hits the top level. meaning if we have `github.com/foo/bar/something` it will check the following directories for license files.\n- `github.com/foo/bar`\n- `github.com/foo`\n- `github.com` \n\nThere is a simple test case added.\n\nNext step is to make a fake app that uses `github.com/cactus/go-statsd-client` and try it out.\n. pull request https://github.com/tools/godep/pull/301 updated,  waiting for review.\n. note: \"code.google.com/p/go-uuid/uuid\" and everything on code.google.com is going to be shutdown (although when I'm not sure).  I believe with go 1.5 a warning is emitted.\n\nThe item in question should be updated to point to https://github.com/pborman/uuid\n\nHopefully that will solve your immediate issue, but doesn't solve the silent failure.\n. Oh you can include it as a library.  Maybe thats better since godep isn't really structured as a library (thats too bad since the VCS stuff might be nice to reuse else where).  I was under the (wrong) impression you didn't use external dependencies in godep.  I will work on cleaning up my library.\n\nI just added some code to copySrc that seems to do the right thing.  But Im new to this code base.  Suggestions most welcome.\n\nI'll make a fake app and try it out with cactus's statsd library.\n\nre: So IMO IsLicenseFile and IsLegalFile should take into consideration that it may get a full (or partial) path to a filename, not just the base name\n\nthanks for tips.  I'll take a look at other calls to copySrc\n\nonward\n. ahh great.  Will look!\n. Hmm, my understanding of the code is that if it's a normal dependency directory, then\n_everything_ gets copied unless it ends in `_test.go` (sometimes).\n\nFrom reading the ticket, for the parent directories, we want _nothing_ copied unless it's legal file.\n\nOptions:\n- pass in another flag to `copyPkgFile` and sort this out in this function. \n- write a `copyLegalFile` function which is a simplified version of  `copyPkgFile`  that just tests and copies legal-like files.\n\nany preference or did I miss something here?\n\nOption 1 would look like this\n\n``` go\nfunc copyPkgFile(vf vcsFiles, dstroot, srcroot string, w *fs.Walker, legalOnly bool) error {\n```\n\nand \n\n``` go\nif !legalOnly && !saveT && strings.HasSuffix(name, \"_test.go\") {\n```\n\nand\n\n``` go\nif legalOnly && !IsLegalFile(name) {\n    return nil\n}\n```\n\nor so.\n. thanks for your review.\n\nre: \"After reading your comment I realized that dep.dir could be a sub package as well, which I didn't consider last night, so you'll only be walking through the files in that sub package.\"\n\nTrue, but legal files in a sub package are copied already.  Its really just the parents that is a problem.  So the current pull solves the ticket issue (although we can clean up the patch a bit).  Or are we solving different problems ?\n. Ahh I put my comments in the original ticket.  Sorry for the confusion.\n\nhttps://github.com/tools/godep/issues/245#issuecomment-150476193\n. oh @freeformz.. mostly me posting in issue and in pull request, and learning how you guys like doing stuff, and a new code base.  Nothing you did.  I'll take a look more closely...\n. I played around with vcs and friends and finally understand the hint you are giving....  and realized I was \"solving\" a more general problem of a license is any parent directory.   We just assume if the sub-package is missing a license, the license (if any) better be at the top of the package.  No need to walk up.\n. hi @freeformz   latest should have a simplified version, although I think it can be simplified further.  Let me know what you think. \n. Ahh intersting ok.\n\nas intermediate step I was thinking of something like this\n\n``` bash\n$ godep version\nv20\n```\n\nor something to let you know what version (or last tagged version) is running.  Thats probably 10 LOC max since you have the version info in go-code already.\n\nThat won't fix the process, but should help.\n. hilar.. I didn't try that since the \"godep help\" didn't list it.  I'll make a pull request adding that to help page.\nthx!\n. @freeformz  \n\nfor `x/net` and `x/crypto` I've had to do \n\n```\ngo get -u golang.org/x/net/...\ngodep update golang.org/x/net/...\n```\n\nthen `go get` and `godep` seem to work fine.  Its something to do with the way these packages are setup and I think not particular to `godep`\n. Hi @jonboulle   I wrote the original code here.  My apologies that it's causing you troubles.\n\nJust so I understand... is the problem just that godep just vendoring files it doesn't need to?  Or is this causing some other issue for you as well.\n\nAnother way of doing this is adding a HasSuffix check of `.txt`, `.rst`, `.md`, `.rtf`, will cover 99.999% of license files out there (well I don't know exactly but my previous scanning suggested this covered most of them).\n\nRegards,\n\nn\n. hi @awsmsrc \n\nLove the idea, but IMHO probably best done as a separate package.\n\nYou also might like https://github.com/shurcooL/gostatus which is a completely different take on reporting of dependences. (cc @shurcooL )\n\nI have a bunch of half-baked stuff, but we use this to make reports doing exactly what you suggested\n\n   github.com/client9/gosupplychain/\n\nIn particular look at the  `github-behind command`.

If one notice is good, more must be better\n\nthese guys\nhttps://github.com/janestreet/fieldslib\n\nSure have a license but also:\nhttps://github.com/janestreet/fieldslib/blob/master/LICENSE.txt\n\nLegal disclaimer\nhttps://github.com/janestreet/fieldslib/blob/master/INRIA-DISCLAIMER.txt\n\nSeparate copyright\nhttps://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/COPYRIGHT.txt\n\nAnd notice of other stuff\nhttps://github.com/janestreet/fieldslib/blob/master/THIRD-PARTY.txt\n\nPhew!\n. @ahmetalpbalkan @freeformz \n\nIm happy to donate `IsLicenseFile` and/or `IsLegalFile` (along with tests)\n\nhttps://github.com/client9/gosupplychain/blob/master/license.go\nhttps://github.com/client9/gosupplychain/blob/master/license_test.go\n\nif it helps.  Let me know if you'd like a pull request, and/or any file/function naming changes.\n\nregards,\n\nn\n. Pull request #301 ready for review @freeformz \n. Ok I think see the code that needs to change, and nifty way of unit testing `cpySrc` @kr\nIm happy to take a stab at this if you want @freeformz (or you can of course too.. not sure what other work is in progress)\n. Ok, not soo bad.  It's a bit tricky since things are working in filesystem paths, but this seems to work.\n\nFor each dependency, it walks backwards grabbing any license files, until it hits the top level. meaning if we have `github.com/foo/bar/something` it will check the following directories for license files.\n- `github.com/foo/bar`\n- `github.com/foo`\n- `github.com` \n\nThere is a simple test case added.\n\nNext step is to make a fake app that uses `github.com/cactus/go-statsd-client` and try it out.\n. pull request https://github.com/tools/godep/pull/301 updated,  waiting for review.\n. note: \"code.google.com/p/go-uuid/uuid\" and everything on code.google.com is going to be shutdown (although when I'm not sure).  I believe with go 1.5 a warning is emitted.\n\nThe item in question should be updated to point to https://github.com/pborman/uuid\n\nHopefully that will solve your immediate issue, but doesn't solve the silent failure.\n. Oh you can include it as a library.  Maybe thats better since godep isn't really structured as a library (thats too bad since the VCS stuff might be nice to reuse else where).  I was under the (wrong) impression you didn't use external dependencies in godep.  I will work on cleaning up my library.\n\nI just added some code to copySrc that seems to do the right thing.  But Im new to this code base.  Suggestions most welcome.\n\nI'll make a fake app and try it out with cactus's statsd library.\n\nre: So IMO IsLicenseFile and IsLegalFile should take into consideration that it may get a full (or partial) path to a filename, not just the base name\n\nthanks for tips.  I'll take a look at other calls to copySrc\n\nonward\n. ahh great.  Will look!\n. Hmm, my understanding of the code is that if it's a normal dependency directory, then\n_everything_ gets copied unless it ends in `_test.go` (sometimes).\n\nFrom reading the ticket, for the parent directories, we want _nothing_ copied unless it's legal file.\n\nOptions:\n- pass in another flag to `copyPkgFile` and sort this out in this function. \n- write a `copyLegalFile` function which is a simplified version of  `copyPkgFile`  that just tests and copies legal-like files.\n\nany preference or did I miss something here?\n\nOption 1 would look like this\n\n``` go\nfunc copyPkgFile(vf vcsFiles, dstroot, srcroot string, w *fs.Walker, legalOnly bool) error {\n```\n\nand \n\n``` go\nif !legalOnly && !saveT && strings.HasSuffix(name, \"_test.go\") {\n```\n\nand\n\n``` go\nif legalOnly && !IsLegalFile(name) {\n    return nil\n}\n```\n\nor so.\n. thanks for your review.\n\nre: \"After reading your comment I realized that dep.dir could be a sub package as well, which I didn't consider last night, so you'll only be walking through the files in that sub package.\"\n\nTrue, but legal files in a sub package are copied already.  Its really just the parents that is a problem.  So the current pull solves the ticket issue (although we can clean up the patch a bit).  Or are we solving different problems ?\n. Ahh I put my comments in the original ticket.  Sorry for the confusion.\n\nhttps://github.com/tools/godep/issues/245#issuecomment-150476193\n. oh @freeformz.. mostly me posting in issue and in pull request, and learning how you guys like doing stuff, and a new code base.  Nothing you did.  I'll take a look more closely...\n. I played around with vcs and friends and finally understand the hint you are giving....  and realized I was \"solving\" a more general problem of a license is any parent directory.   We just assume if the sub-package is missing a license, the license (if any) better be at the top of the package.  No need to walk up.\n. hi @freeformz   latest should have a simplified version, although I think it can be simplified further.  Let me know what you think. \n. Ahh intersting ok.\n\nas intermediate step I was thinking of something like this\n\n``` bash\n$ godep version\nv20\n```\n\nor something to let you know what version (or last tagged version) is running.  Thats probably 10 LOC max since you have the version info in go-code already.\n\nThat won't fix the process, but should help.\n. hilar.. I didn't try that since the \"godep help\" didn't list it.  I'll make a pull request adding that to help page.\nthx!\n. @freeformz  \n\nfor `x/net` and `x/crypto` I've had to do \n\n```\ngo get -u golang.org/x/net/...\ngodep update golang.org/x/net/...\n```\n\nthen `go get` and `godep` seem to work fine.  Its something to do with the way these packages are setup and I think not particular to `godep`\n. Hi @jonboulle   I wrote the original code here.  My apologies that it's causing you troubles.\n\nJust so I understand... is the problem just that godep just vendoring files it doesn't need to?  Or is this causing some other issue for you as well.\n\nAnother way of doing this is adding a HasSuffix check of `.txt`, `.rst`, `.md`, `.rtf`, will cover 99.999% of license files out there (well I don't know exactly but my previous scanning suggested this covered most of them).\n\nRegards,\n\nn\n. hi @awsmsrc \n\nLove the idea, but IMHO probably best done as a separate package.\n\nYou also might like https://github.com/shurcooL/gostatus which is a completely different take on reporting of dependences. (cc @shurcooL )\n\nI have a bunch of half-baked stuff, but we use this to make reports doing exactly what you suggested\n\n   github.com/client9/gosupplychain/\n\nIn particular look at the  `github-behind command`.  It takes a `Godep` file and does something similar to what you are doing.   good: it doesnt mess-up your go path or need to do a restore or checkout big blobs of code.   bad: It's github specific\n\nHere's sample:\n\n```\ngithub.com/client9/tlstext: ahead\n    0 5bd8b72 badges\n    1 0c2f760 badges\n    2 1be66ac badges\n    3 dd4ebd7 badges\n    4 4afdf94 badges\ngithub.com/cloudflare/ahocorasick: identical\ngithub.com/daaku/go.zipexe: identical\ngithub.com/fatih/camelcase: identical\ngithub.com/fatih/structs: ahead\n    0 24ec389 fix typos\n    1 dd04eba Merge pull request #42 from shawnps/patch-2 fix typos\ngithub.com/go-ini/ini: identical\ngithub.com/go-ole/go-ole: ahead\n    0 849646a implement ToValueArray()\n    1 5005588 Merge branch 'master' of git://github.com/go-ole/go-ole\n```\n\nFree free to rip out anything here and use it.\n\nregards,\n\nn\n. hi me again @awsmsrc\n\nI'd be curious if you could make your report outside of godep using it's api.  I seem to recall a lot of good functionality wasn't made public or made into a package.\n\nMaybe we could merge our projects.. really they should be different only in output since they are doing the same things. (i.e. just specific a template file to make different outputs).\n\nhappy to help in either way.\n\nregards,\n\nn\n. hmm weird.  ok.  (meaning surprised it wasn't)\n. done.\n. ",

The only valid info I know how to get is in `git remote show origin`, but I don't really want to parse the output. Any suggestion/help? \n. @freeformz Any input on what I wrote above? \n. @freeformz because it's not obvious that the main branch is the master. If you clone a repository which remote HEAD is not the master you will end up with something different than a master branch. In such a case, if `godep unrestore` tries to restore it to the master branch this could lead to wrong results. \n. Take the [gin repository](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin): the `master` branch exist, but the remote HEAD is `develop`. I think that in this case it will not work. \n. Or we just modify `Godep.json` to be something like: \n\n```\n    {\n            \"ImportPath\": \"github.com/spf13/pflag\",\n            \"Rev\": \"8f6a28b0916586e7f22fe931ae2fcfc380b1c0e6\",\n            \"RemoteHEAD\": \"master\"\n        },\n```\n\nAnd use the `RemoteHEAD` when executing `unrestore`. This will break only in case the remote head of the repo changes from the last time the Godep.json is updated, which is not perfect, but acceptable (IMO). \n. This is exactly what I meant, RemoteHEAD would be populated when `godep save` is executed. When doing `godep unrestore` we could also add a `--force` option (I'm not sure if this flag is already used in another way in other godep commands) to remove the dependency and re-executing a `go get` from scratch in case of failures. Obviously after a warning and a confirmation from the user. \n. So, what you suggest is to just use the info from `git remote show origin` , i.e:\n\n```\n* remote origin\n  Fetch URL: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes.git\n  Push  URL: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes.git\n  HEAD branch: master\n  Remote branches:\n```\n\nIs this right? \n. Any update on this? I broke the build for the same reason. My solution is to run `godep save` again from scratch and compare with the previous Godeps folder. This seems to be the only safe approach in case of update.\n. I was about to implement a `godep unrestore` myself, I think it would be useful (I can work on it and submit a PR, but if you want to work on it, as you whish). More important, though is to document in the `README` what happens now if a user executes `godep restore`. \n\nAlso, can you give me the detail of this change in 1.6 you are mentioning above? \n. Thanks for the link to the commit. \n\nDo you think that a warning like \"`godep restore` could leave some of the dependencies in a detached state. This could lead to problems to update your dependencies\" would be too much? Maybe we could add some text to specify that the users should avoid using `godep restore` if not strictly necessary. \n. Sounds good to me. \n. :+1: \n.

This would keep everything else fixed, keep the clutter in `git diff` minimal and allow for easy manipulation of a single library.\n\nNot sure how dependent libraries of the dependency should be handled though.\n. In the example given (`godep save -r=false github.com/dynport/urknall`) I don't want to totally remove the usage of the urknall package (what I guess you understood), but un-rewrite the import paths, so that the version in my `$GOPATH` is used again, instead of the one in the `Godeps/_workspace`.\n\nBenefit would be, that I'd not have to commit changes to the urknall library and use `godep update github.com/dynport/urknall` to test them in the respective binary.\n\nWhen being finished with changing the urknall library, I'd just `godep update github.com/dynport/urknall && godep save -r ./...` to get everything back to normal in the binary.\n. If rewrite is going away anyway you are right (maybe I should put some focus on Go project politics), so I'm fine with issue being closed. Keep in mind I'm not the OP!\n. ",

It's effectively impossible to vendor a project like etcd that uses godep rewriting with GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT.  As an example, we vendor from rkt, which does uses rewriting.  Error:\n\n```\n... cannot use apisvcConn (type *\"google.golang.org/grpc\".ClientConn) as type *\"github.com/coreos/rkt/Godeps/_workspace/src/google.golang.org/grpc\".ClientConn ...\n```\n\nrkt is expecting a `ClientConn` from github.com/coreos/rkt/Godeps/_workspace/src/google.golang.org/grpc, but my code is passing it from google.golang.org/grpc.  You can argue that the rkt API should not be exposing any types from other pkgs, but it is.\n\nHow is one supposed to get past this, given that there are and will be repos that use Godep in the old way for a while, yet.  Can we teach godep to recognize this and un-rewrite?\n. It would be nice to have a choice - some libs are ONLY consumed by a dep\ninternally, and having 2 versions linked is not so bad.

I agree it might be confusing, and would need REALLY good tooling to make\nit clear how things are currently configured and to allow\nmanagement/changes.

It's effectively impossible to vendor a project like etcd that uses godep rewriting with GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT.  As an example, we vendor from rkt, which does uses rewriting.  Error:\n\n```\n... cannot use apisvcConn (type *\"google.golang.org/grpc\".ClientConn) as type *\"github.com/coreos/rkt/Godeps/_workspace/src/google.golang.org/grpc\".ClientConn ...\n```\n\nrkt is expecting a `ClientConn` from github.com/coreos/rkt/Godeps/_workspace/src/google.golang.org/grpc, but my code is passing it from google.golang.org/grpc.  You can argue that the rkt API should not be exposing any types from other pkgs, but it is.\n\nHow is one supposed to get past this, given that there are and will be repos that use Godep in the old way for a while, yet.  Can we teach godep to recognize this and un-rewrite?\n. It would be nice to have a choice - some libs are ONLY consumed by a dep\ninternally, and having 2 versions linked is not so bad.  Other times you\nneed to flatten, like this grpc case.\nOn Jan 4, 2016 12:03 PM, \"Edward Muller\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> FWIW: This is also an issue with any nested vendor directory setup.

I agree it might be confusing, and would need REALLY good tooling to make\nit clear how things are currently configured and to allow\nmanagement/changes.  OTOH, library L which uses dep D and exposes an API to\napp A should not expose D's type.  It would be much better to take and\nreturn L-defined interfaces.

The things you listed in #358 do not affect the bug. I branched openstorage to use godep in the manner that is suggested, the bug still exists: https://github.com/libopenstorage/openstorage/tree/godep_normal - I think the original bug should be opened, this branch can be worked off of.\n. That branch actually can't even get a Godep.json file into it because godep is broken and won't get all the dependencies in - imagine you have a completely fresh libopenstorage, no vendoring, that you want to now use godep with. As of v33, you can't do that, because it misses a ton of dependencies.\n. I can try to get one in tomorrow using v32, but the bug would be the same\nif this was a first time usage of godep. There's a couple recent things\nthat may cause other errors, so I will let you know, but this bug does not\nrequire previous usage of godep.\n\nOn Thursday, December 17, 2015, Edward Muller notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> Can you commit the Godeps/Godeps.json file that your are using so that I\n> can investigate?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/tools/godep/issues/368#issuecomment-165290631.\n.

Aha! I think I found part of the bug.\n\nSince there is a vendor directory, I do `godep save $(go list ./... | grep -v vendor)` This produces:\n\n```\nGOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 godep save github.com/peter-edge/go-import-server github.com/peter-edge/go-import-server/cmd/import-server github.com/peter-edge/go-import-server/data github.com/peter-edge/go-import-server/testing\n```\n\nWhen I add `/...` to the end of each package:\n\n```\n$ GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 godep save github.com/peter-edge/go-import-server/... github.com/peter-edge/go-import-server/cmd/import-server/... github.com/peter-edge/go-import-server/data/... github.com/peter-edge/go-import-server/testing/...\n```\n\nThis is now the git status:\n\n```\n[~/go/src/github.com/peter-edge/go-import-server]\npedge$ git status\nOn branch master\nYour branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.\nChanges not staged for commit:\n  (use \"git add <file>...\" to update what will be committed)\n  (use \"git checkout -- <file>...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n\n    modified:   Godeps/Godeps.json\n\nUntracked files:\n  (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\n\n    vendor/github.com/Sirupsen/\n    vendor/github.com/codegangsta/\n    vendor/github.com/golang/glog/\n    vendor/github.com/tylerb/\n    vendor/google.golang.org/\n\nno changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\n```\n\nSo adding `/...` to the end of each package makes it so that godep gets all the packages that versions <= v32 get, but also adds new ones. So my hypothesis is that versions > v32 have breaking or backwards-incompatible behavior with recursive dependencies. The above additions in the git status ARE actually external dependencies according to https://github.com/peter-edge/go-tools/tree/master/go-external-deps, but for <=v32, they were not added for whatever reason. And the code builds just fine without them in a docker container.\n. I believe this is related to https://github.com/tools/godep/issues/361, I think #358 should again be opened, or we track this in one place\n. @apriendeau @freeformz of note, you should pull on go-dockerclient, I preemptively fixed the go 1.5 vendoring issue with https://github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient/pull/339\n. I'm having a lot of packages not saved when vendoring github.com/libopenstorage/openstorage. Go 1.5.1, vendor experiment enabled, linux, amd64. \n. I'm having issues all the way back to v33, when `go list` was removed, a ton of packages end up missing. github.com/libopenstorage/openstorage is repeatable (on linux/amd64):\n\n```\nmake update-test-deps # get everything for save\nmake vendor # save, but if you want to test v33-v35, comment out the custom stuff I did to lock it to v32, and re-add go get -v github.com/tools/godep\ngit status # so much stuffz gone!\nmake docker-test # will not be able to build because a lot of packages are not in vendor\n```\n. thanks :-)\n. Was this closed because it is a duplicate?\n. It remains unfixed then, the above comment for openstorage is a repeatable example. Can we re-open?\n. ```\n$ make vendor\nrm -f $GOPATH/bin/godep\ngo get -v github.com/tools/godep\ngithub.com/tools/godep\n#curl -sS -L

The things you listed in #358 do not affect the bug. I branched openstorage to use godep in the manner that is suggested, the bug still exists: https://github.com/libopenstorage/openstorage/tree/godep_normal - I think the original bug should be opened, this branch can be worked off of.\n. That branch actually can't even get a Godep.json file into it because godep is broken and won't get all the dependencies in - imagine you have a completely fresh libopenstorage, no vendoring, that you want to now use godep with. As of v33, you can't do that, because it misses a ton of dependencies.\n. I can try to get one in tomorrow using v32, but the bug would be the same\nif this was a first time usage of godep. There's a couple recent things\nthat may cause other errors, so I will let you know, but this bug does not\nrequire previous usage of godep.\n\nOn Thursday, December 17, 2015, Edward Muller notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> Can you commit the Godeps/Godeps.json file that your are using so that I\n> can investigate?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/tools/godep/issues/368#issuecomment-165290631.\n.

Aha! I think I found part of the bug.\n\nSince there is a vendor directory, I do `godep save $(go list ./... | grep -v vendor)` This produces:\n\n```\nGOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 godep save github.com/peter-edge/go-import-server github.com/peter-edge/go-import-server/cmd/import-server github.com/peter-edge/go-import-server/data github.com/peter-edge/go-import-server/testing\n```\n\nWhen I add `/...` to the end of each package:\n\n```\n$ GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 godep save github.com/peter-edge/go-import-server/... github.com/peter-edge/go-import-server/cmd/import-server/... github.com/peter-edge/go-import-server/data/... github.com/peter-edge/go-import-server/testing/...\n```\n\nThis is now the git status:\n\n```\n[~/go/src/github.com/peter-edge/go-import-server]\npedge$ git status\nOn branch master\nYour branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.\nChanges not staged for commit:\n  (use \"git add <file>...\" to update what will be committed)\n  (use \"git checkout -- <file>...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n\n    modified:   Godeps/Godeps.json\n\nUntracked files:\n  (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\n\n    vendor/github.com/Sirupsen/\n    vendor/github.com/codegangsta/\n    vendor/github.com/golang/glog/\n    vendor/github.com/tylerb/\n    vendor/google.golang.org/\n\nno changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\n```\n\nSo adding `/...` to the end of each package makes it so that godep gets all the packages that versions <= v32 get, but also adds new ones. So my hypothesis is that versions > v32 have breaking or backwards-incompatible behavior with recursive dependencies. The above additions in the git status ARE actually external dependencies according to https://github.com/peter-edge/go-tools/tree/master/go-external-deps, but for <=v32, they were not added for whatever reason. And the code builds just fine without them in a docker container.\n. I believe this is related to https://github.com/tools/godep/issues/361, I think #358 should again be opened, or we track this in one place\n. ",

    "azylman": "Why should the result of vendoring be a \"flat\" set of dependencies? That seems very confusing - if package A depends on package B and C that both depend on different versions of package D, what version of package D is used?\n\nThe spec for vendoring allows for nested vendor folders (https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-dev/74zjMON9glU/0e7M7FHipusJ) and you can sidestep that hairy issue if you allow it.\n\nI can see the benefit to \"promoting\" a vendored dependency upwards if they're the same version, but that seems like an optimization and not necessary.\n. There's a couple reasons you might want this. For us, where this came up is that the top-level package is a library and it has a command-line interface that consumes it in `<pkd>/cmd/<binary name>`. We want to vendor dependencies in the cmd but not in the library, because other packages consume that library, so ideally we'd have `<pkg>/cmd/<binary name>/vendor`.\n\nAnother reason that I mentioned in the pull request is that you want different versions of the same dependency for different commands within your repository, which is less common, but definitely happens (e.g. at companies that are big into monorepos). I think this was the use case mentioned in #303 and #305.\n\nI think regardless of whether or not you agree with the use case, it should be pretty clear that the `isDirty` function right now is broken: it takes in a package and purports to tell you if that package is dirty, but instead it tells you if the repo that that package is in is dirty. These are not the same, for example they'd vary when the package is a subpackage within a repository. Luckily, this can be fixed while enabling new use cases without breaking existing use cases.\n. a) I'm aware that it's vendored again - I think this is less confusing than the current behavior\n\nb) That's unfortunate\n\nc) Yes, good point. In the use case that I was testing this on, it was actually sibling packages, not parent/child, so I didn't notice that. My guess is that there's not really a good way to do it for parent/child, since it would require knowledge of your project - e.g. when is a subpackage relevant and when it isn't. This would still fix the monorepo sibling packages case mentioned in #303 and #305, but wouldn't fix the other issue\n. Is there any risk to vendoring a package in a dirty repository when the package itself isn't dirty? I can't think of anything, but might be missing something.\n\nObviously you don't want to vendor a dirty package because then the code doesn't correspond to any commit.\n.

That seems very confusing - if package A depends on package B and C that both depend on different versions of package D, what version of package D is used?\n\nThe spec for vendoring allows for nested vendor folders (https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-dev/74zjMON9glU/0e7M7FHipusJ) and you can sidestep that hairy issue if you allow it.\n\nI can see the benefit to \"promoting\" a vendored dependency upwards if they're the same version, but that seems like an optimization and not necessary.\n.

We want to vendor dependencies in the cmd but not in the library, because other packages consume that library, so ideally we'd have `<pkg>/cmd/<binary name>/vendor`.\n\nAnother reason that I mentioned in the pull request is that you want different versions of the same dependency for different commands within your repository, which is less common, but definitely happens (e.g. at companies that are big into monorepos). I think this was the use case mentioned in #303 and #305.\n\nI think regardless of whether or not you agree with the use case, it should be pretty clear that the `isDirty` function right now is broken: it takes in a package and purports to tell you if that package is dirty, but instead it tells you if the repo that that package is in is dirty. These are not the same, for example they'd vary when the package is a subpackage within a repository. Luckily, this can be fixed while enabling new use cases without breaking existing use cases.\n. a) I'm aware that it's vendored again - I think this is less confusing than the current behavior\n\nb) That's unfortunate\n\nc) Yes, good point. In the use case that I was testing this on, it was actually sibling packages, not parent/child, so I didn't notice that. My guess is that there's not really a good way to do it for parent/child, since it would require knowledge of your project - e.g. when is a subpackage relevant and when it isn't. This would still fix the monorepo sibling packages case mentioned in #303 and #305, but wouldn't fix the other issue\n. Is there any risk to vendoring a package in a dirty repository when the package itself isn't dirty? I can't think of anything, but might be missing something.\n\nObviously you don't want to vendor a dirty package because then the code doesn't correspond to any commit.\n. ",

So I went through a restructuring of my project, and eventually had it working.\nThen I somehow screwed up by calling go install without godep infront of it somewhere....\n\nThis put my system in a perpetually bad build situation where no matter what kind of cleaning I did it was still building improperly, and I would get the same runtime error.\n\nI used \n\n```\ngodep go install -a -v -x ./...\n```\n\nand I could see that it was referencing the martini source that was NOT in the GODEPS\n\nSo I deleted the martini code from my $GOROOT/src. The next build with the same -a -v -x looked ok, and works.\n. ",

Sorry, this is duplicate with https://github.com/tools/godep/issues/448.\n. +1. Any updates on this?\n. @freeformz This might be a little hacky but I tried it and it worked.\n\nEasy example is https://github.com/boltdb/bolt. It has only one external dependency of `golang.org/x/sys/unix` in https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/master/bolt_unix_solaris.go. If you don't `godep` in Solaris, it will spin out empty `Godeps.json`.\n\nI cannot think of an easier way because `go list` command gets its list from `go build` command, which is very hard to change. This approach would give us what we want, I hope.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any feedback.\n. Just pushed another updates to walk through the raw Go files without go list command.\n. Great. Thanks @freeformz . I will close this in favor of https://github.com/tools/godep/pull/341/.\n.

Sorry I forgot to add my errors. \nActually there is no obvious error occurred unless some project moved or delete some folder, it shows \"cannot find package in any of GOROOT GOPATH\", for me they are:\ngithub.com/prometheus/client_golang/model \ngithub.com/prometheus/client_golang/text\ngithub.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/internal/apierr\nall above projects deleted some folders between old and current versions.\n.

But that's probably un-avoidable if we do want to record the version string.\n\nThe version would only be changed when you write to Godeps.json (`godep save` or `godep get`). So it's inherently going to be part of some larger diff.\n\n> w/o using this version elsewhere I'm not sure this is all that useful.\n\nHard to use it until the version's already in Godeps.json :)\n\n> And I can see trying to enforce the version to add overhead to interactions with developers. But maybe that overhead is already being imposed, just in an ad-hoc way?\n\nYeah that's definitely what I'm getting at. We already have to enforce versions with developers since godep has been around a while (I worked with someone with v20something installed yesterday).\n\nBut also it's really useful to know when you're running a more recent version of godep as well. When I run a `godep save` and the diff of the Godeps directory has a bunch of files removed that had nothing to do with the packages I was trying to alter, it's very hard to know if that's user error or because someone was using a really old version of Godeps for the last commit.\n\nI can see the biggest annoyance begin when you get a commit when the version goes from \"v62\" to \"v61\". But again, this should only happen when you're updating a vendored package anyway and those diffs are generally pretty big.\n. > I guess looking at the git history and the comments would probably tell you enough though about what was done?\n\nHow so? Without the version in the Godeps.json file we can't tell what version of godep was used to generate which commit.\n. FYI this change also dramatically reduces the memory usage of `godep restore` (~3 GB) when using it against the Kubernetes repo.. The issue is that godep running go 1.4.X is looking into a file with a `// +build go1.5` tag and finding an import that doesn't exist in go 1.4.X.\n\nHere's the files that are causing trouble.\n\n```\n$ head mime.go \n// +build go1.5\n\npackage gomail\n\nimport (\n    \"mime\"\n    \"mime/quotedprintable\"\n)\n\nvar newQPWriter = quotedprintable.NewWriter\n$ head mime_go14.go \n// +build !go1.5\n\npackage gomail\n\nimport \"gopkg.in/alexcesaro/quotedprintable.v3\"\n\nvar newQPWriter = quotedprintable.NewWriter\n\ntype mimeEncoder struct {\n    quotedprintable.WordEncoder\n```\n\nThe go tool itself correctly states that `mime/quotedprintable` isn't part of the imports for this package when using go 1.4.X\n\n```\n$ go version gopkg.in/gomail.v2\ngo version go1.4.3 linux/amd64\n$ go list -f '{{.Imports}}'\n[bytes crypto/tls encoding/base64 errors fmt gopkg.in/alexcesaro/quotedprintable.v3 io mime mime/multipart net net/mail net/smtp os path/filepath time]\n```\n\nHowever godep thinks that `mime/quotedprintable` is a dependency when running go 1.4.X\n. Okay that makes sense. Then the issue here is that `mime/quotedprintable` isn't a go getable package since it's part of the standard library.\n\n```\n$ godep restore\ngodep: Dep (gopkg.in/gomail.v2) restored, but was unable to load it with error:\n    Unable to find dependent package mime/quotedprintable in context of /home/eric/src/gopkg.in/gomail.v2\ngodep:  This may be because the dependencies were saved with an older version of godep (< v33).\ngodep:  Try `go get mime/quotedprintable`. Then `godep save` to update deps.\ngodep: Error checking some deps.\n```\n\nCan godep keep a white list of standard library packages for all go versions, then skip these when attempting to restore a package?\n. bump @freeformz (https://github.com/google/cadvisor/pull/1162#issuecomment-197068631)\n. > So my main concern with this is Godep.json churn. But that's probably un-avoidable if we do want to record the version string.\n\nThe version would only be changed when you write to Godeps.json (`godep save` or `godep get`). So it's inherently going to be part of some larger diff.\n\n> w/o using this version elsewhere I'm not sure this is all that useful.\n\nHard to use it until the version's already in Godeps.json :)\n\n> And I can see trying to enforce the version to add overhead to interactions with developers. But maybe that overhead is already being imposed, just in an ad-hoc way?\n\nYeah that's definitely what I'm getting at. We already have to enforce versions with developers since godep has been around a while (I worked with someone with v20something installed yesterday).\n\nBut also it's really useful to know when you're running a more recent version of godep as well. When I run a `godep save` and the diff of the Godeps directory has a bunch of files removed that had nothing to do with the packages I was trying to alter, it's very hard to know if that's user error or because someone was using a really old version of Godeps for the last commit.\n\nI can see the biggest annoyance begin when you get a commit when the version goes from \"v62\" to \"v61\". But again, this should only happen when you're updating a vendored package anyway and those diffs are generally pretty big.\n. > I guess looking at the git history and the comments would probably tell you enough though about what was done?\n\nHow so? Without the version in the Godeps.json file we can't tell what version of godep was used to generate which commit.\n.

I just mean the go1.6 `vendor` folder (not a Godeps folder) without import rewriting. For the time being I am using `glide` to maintain the `vendor` folder. Not perfect but got the job when I couldn't convince `godep` to do it. Thanks for the help.\n. Ah - didn't know about the `vendor` folder support in `godep`.\nHm - how did I miss that? That's quite prominent in the docs.\nAnyway - what to pass as parameter could indeed be expanded on in docs.\nUnless I missed that, too :-p\n.

Not perfect but got the job when I couldn't convince `godep` to do it. Thanks for the help.\n. Ah - didn't know about the `vendor` folder support in `godep`.\nHm - how did I miss that?

    "karalabe": "@freeformz Sorry I didn't have time sooner to make a repro. However I'm not sure the workaround will be enough for many cases. Usually you have three types of CGO use cases (at least what I've encountered / worked with):\n- Small embedded snippets, usually to access some platform specific stuff.\n- Using C libraries from the host system straight.\n- Using C libraries distributed along the Go codebase.\n\nIn the first two scenarios, the C code lives beside the Go code in the same folder/packages, so Godep will handle these cases just fine. The problematic part is the third case, where you want to pull in an entire external library (usually because it's not something so common as to be available on all OSes, or easily installable: e.g. snappy encoding, rocksdb, secp256k1 curve crypto). The issue is that these C dependencies can be quite huge, and are already structured as C projects by themselves, so to use them in your own repo, it's not clean practice to copy in Go files into the C project structure. The solution is to simply have a Go package with the wrappers and a subfolder containing the C code that is being wrapped. And this is exactly the scenario Godep fails on currently.\n\nMaybe a possible solution would be to always copy over .c/.cpp/.h etc files that could be used by CGO? Or perhaps only do this if there's some `import \"C\"` statement present that could cause them to be needed? Or perhaps you could also use a flag/env var similar to the vendor experiment flag that would (`CGOENABLED`) that would alter the godep behavior to pull in the C file types?\n. @freeformz Sorry I didn't have time sooner to make a repro. However I'm not sure the workaround will be enough for many cases. Usually you have three types of CGO use cases (at least what I've encountered / worked with):\n- Small embedded snippets, usually to access some platform specific stuff.\n- Using C libraries from the host system straight.\n- Using C libraries distributed along the Go codebase.\n\nIn the first two scenarios, the C code lives beside the Go code in the same folder/packages, so Godep will handle these cases just fine. The problematic part is the third case, where you want to pull in an entire external library (usually because it's not something so common as to be available on all OSes, or easily installable: e.g. snappy encoding, rocksdb, secp256k1 curve crypto). The issue is that these C dependencies can be quite huge, and are already structured as C projects by themselves, so to use them in your own repo, it's not clean practice to copy in Go files into the C project structure.

Your point is fair, but I think that git-ignoring `vendor/` should be an option. `godep restore` should _try_ to fetch remote dependencies if `vendor/` is absent before showing failure due to network, if there is one. If `vendor/` is already present, then simply skip that step.
