We need better proxy support. :(\n. Fixing this again for the first time, for the last time? ;)\n. Hopefully this is fixed with the latest bits coming in 0.9.8.17. If not we will add a config value to specify your proxy type.\n. I'm thinking we'll want to do some configuration file stuff for proxies since there seems to be different ways of handling the way in\n. @grenade would you file a new issue? \n. fixed in 63cf4e0470248c2a7bb602db82af1d7da66d12ca\n.

We are likely putting together a packages.config file that will keep all of the installed packages...likely we will put it there.\n. So it might be good to also have the ability to exclude at runtime.

Folks have expressed issues with the cunst (too close to another word)\n. If there is only one version, it shouldn't prompt.\n. Dependencies are not removed right now. That could get very tricky as multiple items in the repo could depend on the same package (application really) to be installed. Plus the dependency may not be a runtime dependency, only an install dependency.\n\nConsider ruby.devkit - it has dependencies on 7zip.commandline and ruby. Ruby is the hard dependency, 7zip is only so it can unpack the files.  Which dependency would you remove? The proper answer is probably neither as I might still want ruby around. Thoughts?\n. #389 & #295\n#187 \n. I think this is done-ish. New tickets will get added to choco regarding plussing up autouninstaller and registry name going into chocopackages.\n. See this for more explanation section \"3.6 Virtual packages\" http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-binary.html\n. Another resource for explanation: http://www.linuxtopia.org/online_books/linux_system_administration/debian_linux_guides/debian_linux_faq/ch-pkg_basics.en_007.html\n. Meta packages are already in chocolatey. Thanks for the suggestion though, I probably need to make the docs highlight that a little more.\n. Thought about it quite a bit, but maybe I'm missing the boat with virtual packages. I need to depend on the virtual package, but how does the virtual know what packages satisfy the virtual package requirement? \n\nFrom what you are saying, it sounds like debian uses some metadata about packages to know whether they are say a \"PDFReader\" or not.  That could get pretty server intensive as chocolatey doesn't keep a local list of packages (which also means it doesn't give a nice \"Did you mean 'apt-get curl'?\" message either.\n\nPerhaps one could depend on a tag, but that's not reliable on the nuget framework.  The current method of implementation I've thought of isn't perfect (doesn't automatically have new packages that meet the virtual requirement), but it's a start... :)\n\n\"We never usually go the right direction in the start, only discover it after we've made progress.\"\n\nAlthough if you have ideas on how to make it easier to register an application as satisfying a virtual requirement, I'm definitely open to it.\n. I believe in the blog post you were reading, I was thinking of taking virtual packages to a new level where someone could configure whether they want the \".noinstall\" or \".install\" version of a tool/application (like nodejs). Other packages would only depend on the virtual package and then the one the user wants would be installed.\n. No progress yet. We have other fundamental design issues to finish back up in the rewrite before we could even approach this. But it will be in a special extension of the nuspec format.\n. This has been moved to https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/858\n. Fixed in f467af1062950d4c4c0cbb6063448452d8ec73e9\n. By the way, this would have first surfaced for users in version 0.9.8.7 (where we upgraded to NuGet 1.5)\n. @henningc - I did log another issue for you on what you are experiencing - https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/16 - I also closed it with chocolatey 0.9.8.11 (which you can get with cup)\n. Yeah, definitely want to address this in the upcoming version. \n. This is fixed...\n. @mkmurray let's chat on chocolatey/choco, ensure you are on 0.9.10.x.\n. What you are seeing is likely a different issue and definitely not over here on the old POSH version. Https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/new \n. Fixed in f4de1072706d13561edb9b07b7b82cbf67b156ad\n. cinst paint.net\n. @zilexa also that menu is there when you type `choco install -h`\n. Fixed in aba01ffafbb4c47aa50daa7266aa8de88bde93b1\n. right on.\n. That's kind of like cheating... thanks :D\n. Think this is done... http://chocolatey.org/packages/hg\n. It's okay. Why don't we migrate your notes over to the other issue?\n. awesome. I fixed the curl package by the way and updated to the latest version. The site owner takes down old downloads.\n. This is fixed in 490390d35c2e4c9ff3ba7293c9a1da374bf4ff65\n. Yes - the whole gallery isn't complete yet, so you will probably see oddities.\n. That's why there is a huge message in red on the front page of the gallery. ;)\n. Closing this for now. When the next version of the gallery comes out, this should be fixed. If you want to, log the bug with https://github.com/ferventcoder/nugetgallery\n. It's actually .net framework 4.0 that you need installed. it's listed as a\nprerequisite for chocolatey on the readme in source, but that's probably not\nan obvious location.\n\n---\n\nRob\n\"Be passionate in all you do\"\n\nhttp://devlicio.us/blogs/rob_reynolds\nhttp://ferventcoder.com\nhttp://twitter.com/ferventcoder\nOn Oct 18, 2011 12:47 AM, \"marisks\" <\nreply@reply.github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> I tried to install completely fresh machine and started with package\n> installation.

Actually, I just noticed that the requirements are listed at the bottom of the home wiki page as well. https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki\n. I will take a look at this one...\n. Yes, this is a problem. While I am working this out, you can still install an older version.\n\ncinst notepadplusplus -version 5.9.0.1\n. Notepad++ latest version is now working. Thanks for reporting. Let's log another issue on Paint.NET...\n. Set-ExecutionPolicy UnRestricted is what is actually suggested. \n\nThis is literally from https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/Installation without any changes. Note the bolded section.\nPowerShell\nThis is the easiest method. Open a powershell command line and paste in the following and press &lt;Enter&gt;:\n\niex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString(\"http://bit.ly/psChocInstall\"))\n**Note: You must have your execution policy set to remote unsigned for this to work.**\nIt downloads and runs (https://raw.github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/master/chocolateyInstall/InstallChocolatey.ps1).\n. On the front page of chocolatey.org where it talks about Easy Install, there is also a blurb in there about having powershell set to unrestricted. Perhaps this could be made more clear somehow?\n. I bolded it and brightened up the text a bit on https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/Installation - does this help?\n. I also brightened it and made it a bit clearer on http://chocolatey.org. If you have other ideas into how to relay this a little better, please let me know.\n. Are you seeing this across the board?\n. Does the second window even pop up for you?  Do me a favor and look in C:\\Nuget\\chocolateyInstall for a chocolateyPSInstall.log file. This may help lead us to what is really going on.\n\nFrom what it looks like, it is not finding powershell on your machine to execute. What version of powershell do you have installed?\n. sounds like we need to specify the full path to powershell and possibly make it configurable?\n. https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/23\n. Strange... perhaps we should investigate using just lowercase in the code base?  Although this sounds a bit deeper of an issue if you need to rename items to get them to run.\n. Fixing this could get very interesting...since it extends to packages themselves as well. :(\n. I am about to check in some code that may fix this issue. Can you do a build from source, install and test for me?\n. Fixed in bd850d80ef4e4a173dabe00aa61a8680bf44cc60 \n\nUnless of course you find it didn't work.\n. The culture was set to InvariantCulture at run time to help eliminate issues like this.\n. Fixed in 3bb2cf9657255038c5ea81bcb03a630a1b198591\n. I merged in the first commit. After our discussion on the second one, I gave you something else. In the source you will now see a setup.cmd. It will set up things you need to hack on the source. :D\n. Merged in 42bf8359c6dca1fba3df65de9144150d4cf2c264\n. For future readers: This is a fix for getting modules. Powershell 3.0 gets stricter on how you can get these items. This fixes an issue with write-host and write-error overrides that happens in the next version of powershell (3.0).\n. If something never asserts admin privileges it is possible that there may not be any window pop ups (unzips will still pop a window)\n. Fixed in 3bb2cf9657255038c5ea81bcb03a630a1b198591\n. Fixed in 3471a3bb1a48255ed2d0cfad2d053a415595ffdc\n. Not seeing this issue, I think it might be coming up due to $pwd\n. No, that is still working... I am slightly perplexed..\n. I put a space in the path I was installing from and it blew up nuget install due to me not catching for spaces in paths to install from, only to.  \n. what version are you putting on ahk?\n. what if I told you this thing absolutely worked for me? \n. I did the same steps as you, put it all in the same directory and called the stuff. Worked fine. \n\nOnly difference I can think of offhand is that my choco install directory does not have spaces in it.\n. I also attempted installing with nuget to a directory with spaces and nuget worked fine.  I would need to change my choco install directory to completely test what you are doing... \n. Try this, in your chocolatey lib directory, delete anything to do with windowpad that you may have there. When the item is already downloaded, nuget will not make an attempt to re-download it. This can cause issues.\n. I actually did it with a space as well and it worked. What you need to do is -source \"D:\\users\\Anthony Mastrean\\Dropbox\\Projects\" and it should work. That's pretty much an expectation though when you have spaces.\n. When you quote the path with spaces, does it work?\n. Closing this guy. Do we want to file a new issue for the spaces?\n. Fixed in 2451ebc2dc72b97752ad6bd823a37185441c4039\n. For list you just type `clist -source webpi` (and you already need to have webpi.commandline installed for it to work.)\n. `chocolatey webpi packageName` `cwebpi packageName` or `cinst packageName -source webpi`\n. the list command issue is here: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/37\n. Fixed in 2451ebc2dc72b97752ad6bd823a37185441c4039\n. `Chocolatey gem packageName` , `cgem packageName` or `cinst packageName -source ruby`  \nDoes not require ruby gems to be installed prior to running this command.\n. This seems reasonable enough to accomplish.\n. Fixed in revision e5006cd77fa42f3805626d656f98e5af08fbf64e\n. I like it.\n. I would totally dig a pull request here ;)\n. This has been completed in https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/43\n. For notes of others, this packages.config differs a little from a vanilla nuget's packages.config in that it adds a source element. For example:\n\n``` xml\n<packages>\n    <package id=\"somepackage\"   />\n    <package id=\"somepackagewithversion\" version=\"1.0\"  />\n    <package id=\"somepackagewithsource\" version=\"1.0\" source=\"http://myget.org/f/customfeed\" />\n    <package id=\"IISExpress\" source=\"webpi\" />\n</packages>\n```\n. That is an interesting idea. You want to log a new issue for it (or would you like me to)? I'm curious in how we could get the items that are from different sources... and also how to account for items that never end up in lib (ruby gems and WebPI items)\n. This has been moved to https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/258\n. Fixed in 244bf4aeef54d8a833069427cc699d262cac830c\n. What version of powershell do you have on your machine?\n. No worries... :D\n. @HKochniss We accept pull requests. :D\n. @HKochniss Alternatively, please file a new issue for us to check the powershell version.  We do have requirements listed, but perhaps it would be better to also have that in the installer script.\n. Because I'm too lazy to type nuget pack \n.

Fixed in 951d47b27743fbefb976e1093d95fc3a5e95a571\n. Pretty neat. Works with directories as well.\n. Fixed in 3570d7bac2e695d139c5569b4b3737ffa8cbce59\n. In this case we don't limit at all, but have also removed the usage of nuget.org/chocolatey.org b/c that would be insane... :D\n. This is the test feed I used: www.myget.org/F/chocoinstallall/\n\nAnd for directories, I just put packages in a directory and called the same thing.\n. Well, shoot, I am going to write some tests for it, but it appears to work. I think it will fall in with -force, and the rename of the folder to c:\\chocolatey instead of c:\\nuget.\n. Fixed in 3570d7bac2e695d139c5569b4b3737ffa8cbce59\n. Fixed in 1b823d5eeae51ab19a757ef80a9bc7585ad5aa1b\n. This sounds pretty doable. :D\n. Fixed in e09a0e1a871708cdf90cd1d082b8ca71b7d9226d\n. Still thinking about whether nuget.exe will continue to be part of chocolatey's package or not. It is an artifact of necessity at the current time.\n. Consider the nuget.exe inside of chocolatey as an internal item to chocolatey's execution. It could go away at some point so linking it now would create later pains.  \n\nIf you want nuget on the path then install nuget.commandline. :D\n. Fixed in c0cb47a9c4e0e8fc27d0b95e0e97c7cf2599e463\n. This shouldn't be too hard,  I just did something similar for the cinst all command\n. Fixed in 59e71754bb726bddec5ee6dd601ac414c5ff2471\n. Does it break anything or is it only during the upgrade?\n. It might be some remnants of having a preview version installed that may have had issues? I honestly only saw that while I was working on the feature. \n. It's in the chocolatey.cmd file and inside the chocolatey.ps1 file. Solves an issue with the Turkish \"I\" which was making it impossible to use chocolatey.\n. closing unless there is anything left to discuss\n. unintended side effect of still running the old code during the install of chocolatey.\n. Thoughts?\n. It's written out in the Generate-BinFile method. In 0.9.8.13 it writes them in a more portable manner. However during the upgrade, the nuget.bat file is generated using the 0.9.8.12 code.\n. Nuget.exe will not be linked in vNext\n. Undocumented feature this release but fixed in fc768d4b097e97d243e661e654588431d183c50b\n. Undocumented meaning dark feature, subject to change.\n. Nuget.CommandLine - it's been there since the beginning. Bad name (on nuget.org)\n. Fixed in 9c73f18beb0ed6cb6aee38b09479507d73877240\n. Apparently there is a second one with the same name: http://win-get.sourceforge.net\n. Sounds like we just need to not work with any packages ending in .config. Do you think that would be agreeable? Or if we don't find a file named something.config we try looking at it as a package name instead.\n. Oh, sorry, I already fixed the issue using EndsWith(). But then I thought about it some more and we shouldn't restrict a package name ending in .config or cause confusion if someone has one named as such.\n. Fixed in 6d2c54f6d290088cb622ded3560476a61b03db24\n. Here https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CommandsInstall - probably could draw out the packages.config to it's own wiki page though.\n. Fixed in 3c7701e49b8d912aee52d911c4c16d3f4873605a\n. Fixed in 6d56726e9aca6818d3fc9810d943d16eff6a4c14\n. interesting that you would use BITS...\n. Maybe choco should use Curl - how does it do with proxies?\n. This is in 97b94b2d7d5874da2e94bad693b3e8c51a146b64 and 5a9d3968042cdacfdfce62f05e0108a772c5019e. This closes #297\n. Fixed in 7aac8983c358bf4e0dcccaa6465b567628063480\n. Noticed a couple of things here. \n\nWindows XP would no longer be supported.\nAdmin privileges are required - one of the tenants of choco is to run on systems w/out admin. And it does as long as you stay way from admin packages.\nHow does this work with tools that have required dlls or configs sitting next to them ?\n\nWe talked about generating batches differently for gui files. While this would be awesome and a very clean way of doing this, I can't limit choco down to only admin users on greater than xp.\notherwise I would kick up choco in admin mode.\n\nPerhaps this is a \"mode\" we can support later for those that will be running as admins.\n. Tried with nant - couldn't load log4net. Boo.\n. you can put the symlinks under a user profile? Chocolatey installs under user environment settings since 0.9.8.7.\n. Agreed.\n. your link didn't work.\n. I think this may be duplicated by some other issues...\n. Is this still an issue? \n. The nuget.exe file inside of chocolatey isn't meant for public usage. Once we get in a feature to ignore exes, that will be one of the first on the list.\n. Fixed in b18b0819b3f67b06ca47cef7745d7d2f2dd1d12c\n. Fixed in 4aeea37b2a91ccaf279c6c34bef136b4c812edc9\n. Open PowerShell as an administrator. \n. calling this good to go...\n. Freakin awesome idea. :D\n. @jasondenizac It's fine to put issues on NuGet gallery, but keep in mind that Chocolatey and chocolatey.org are separate projects. Having the nuget gallery add it would be awesome, but sometimes things are quicker to get added to chocolatey.org and pointed to later. See this PR: https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/525\n. It's coming hopefully with next release. I was just thinking of this\nenhancement this morning.\n\nOn Monday, May 20, 2013, Phil Baines wrote:\n\n> @gep13 https://github.com/gep13 Thanks!\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/67#issuecomment-18153324\n> .\n\n## \n\n---\n\nRob\n\"Be passionate in all you do\"\n\nhttp://devlicio.us/blogs/rob_reynolds\nhttp://ferventcoder.com\nhttp://twitter.com/ferventcoder\n. no updates yet, but it will be automatic without a save flag.

Freaking droid web browser i'm on right now is a pos when it comes to editing. It doesn't go to where you point and it's impossible to navigate by keys\n. By the way, this is a dark feature right now since 0.9.8.15: if you have bobBob.exe in a folder, you can place a file named bobBob.exe.gui right next to it and chocolatey will set it up as a gui app instead.\n. This is now documented in https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages\n. Unfortunately building is not in the vision of chocolatey. Library packages are not out of the realm of chocolatey's vision, but pretty darn close.\n\nThis is where apt and chocolatey diverge. Chocolatey does not do source packages. CoApp on the other hand is up and coming for exactly this idea. https://github.com/coapp \n\nMore details here: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/ChocolateyFAQs\n\nThank you for asking.\n\nBy the way, nuget is looking to add support for C++ - http://nuget.codeplex.com/discussions/280649\n. Closing this for now pending any further discussion....\n. This shouldn't be too hard. Likely it will be pulled into the next version. :D\n. Great... :( Thanks for reporting this. \n. It seems that other folks are reporting this issue as well. For now try adding source=\"http://chocolatey.org/api/v2/\" />\n. Fixed in dc736b5c9d6bb99c64b0841ae6bf0a8eec6389b8\n. slap the source into it for now... It's the source that is the issue\n. Thanks. This definitely appears to be a bug...\n. Fixed in d34231feb682e834f7d8b404e6e0bfc4487ebcf8\n. By the way, what is the actual value of the environment variable on the machine? Closing and reopening powershell and calling this might be sufficient to get the machine value.\n. The error at the end is the changeover of chocolatey to a new folder and it having issues updating the powershell session's path.\n. Close, reopen powershell.\n. https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/80 - already fixed the issue. It's related only to the instance you are in...\n. Good, job? ;)\n. @krivan you can already starting hosting your own private repositories now. The one trick around this at the moment is that you would have to host both the public package and your private one on the private repository\n. This now works thanks to @LucidSage's work. :D\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/101\n. And you don't even need to have the dependent packages on the same feed.\n. @MarkJohnson1974 I've added a new issue to capture the additional differences - https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/105\n. Apparently you can already do this - `cinst blah -source \"\"source1;source2\"\"` (note the double quotes)\n. @MarkJohnson1974 UNC paths should work - if you quote for spaces, make sure you double quote.\n. Awesome! It's likely we'll have a configuration at some point to ease all pain in proxy issues, since they all like to work differently... \n. Until then I don't have a problem setting this one up.\n. Fixed in bd3eefefc440d821b6a97abd1381fe64d7b176a6\n\nFull disclosure, moving stuff around so I just pulled it in like a patch.\n. In the next couple of weeks I am looking at a release. Got one more bug to fix and hopefully some pull requests to bring in. :D\n. The beta is out, unfortunately you will have to do a little bit of manual work to install it (the new version will handle prereleases, 0.9.8.16 doesn't) - \n\nGo to https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/Installation\nand use the NuGet.exe + PowerShell Method (very bottom) - you can use chocolatey to pull it down but you will still need to dive into the installation folder to run the install script manually.\n. Hmmm - just make sure you don't have a Help.ps1 and an Install-All.ps1 in the functions folder anymore (two files that were in 0.9.8.16 were renamed to include \"Chocolatey-\" on the front).\n. Oh right - to do the nuget method you would have to say `nuget install chocolatey -pre`\n. fixed in 2eec8417032c706075c7b872f926411129ac8530\n. Fixed in 2eec8417032c706075c7b872f926411129ac8530\n. You are close - step #3 is just the verbose output coming back from NuGet. It is not considered installed by chocolatey until finished and the message comes out.\n. But I do agree - chocolatey needs that last step to say - \"Yes, this was successful\" \n. This is related to https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/10\n. Chocolatey != 1.0 fellas. Expect some rough edges that need to be smoothed out. :) \n\nThis is one of those. \nMy preference is to mark as broken so someone can inspect what went wrong. (and move it to a particular folder that contains broken packages)\n. Still stewing on this one... leaning towards good.\n. This is going to be done with a configuration - you will need to enable it on the configuration. I will push that up and then you can set the command if you like\n. The default is to NOT use the nuget config. If you want to use it, you will have to set a user configuration telling it to. Does that sound fair?\n. I'm pushing the config file in master, if you want to take a look at that and reissue a pull request (that way you get your name on the work). Use a different branch than master please. Thanks.\n. Closing this one...waiting on the other. Let me know if you want it (I can reimplement if not)\n. Great! There is github for windows that helps when learning git. I'm releasing chocolatey this week so if you want to get in on that try to get it to me today or tomorrow. If not, it can just roll into the next release. :D\n. Hopefully addressing this in 0.9.8.17. It doesn't find the right folder when looking for one with prerelease bits on it...\n. Just fixed the cup side of the house (https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/90) and I should get to this sometime this week.\n. I believe this is fixed. I could not reproduce this with the latest code...that should be out in beta form in the next day or so\n. Nice...not everyone installs chocolatey to C:\\chocolatey though\n. You can actually pre set the chocolateyinstall variable to point it somewhere else. But in this case it would capture 90% of the first hits.\n\nIf you are in powershell, it is already set at first initialization (it's just wrong for some reason - it was fixed in the source and will go out on the next release)\n. I think I might go ahead and add this to the code... thanks for this\n. Thanks...I will take a look at this.\n. Fixed in ab24dda6aa0596d31f78f0d21357b80de2056bc1 - out with 0.9.8.17 release\n. You had multiple folders with 0.1.0 of sake in your folder structure, even though they were different prerelease versions. \n\nChocolatey had not yet made it to handling prerelease folders, but it will in 0.9.8.17 (next release). It errorred trying to add more than one item to the found packages dictionary. The fix is in with specs (https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/commit/80df71b6f2bbecc4ec0f01539050cc966641dec9#L3R71).\n. Thanks...I will look at implementing tests for this unless you want to\n. We use Pester - the testing aspect is not exactly straightforward. But we have really good examples in the tests folder. If you follow that down to unit you will see an example of some tests. https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/tree/master/tests/unit\n\nIf you come up a folder you will notice another folder named functions (which really should be named mocks). https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/tree/master/tests/functions\n\nThe mock may already be setup correctly. Most tests in the system (there are not a ton yet, I'm new to powershell testing as well!) are unit and not integration tests. Which means you test by what you expect from different functions.\n\nI did a recent presentation on powershell testing which may give you some pointers into this area: https://github.com/ferventcoder/presentations/tree/master/dotNet/powershellbdd\n. I have it in mind to make changes to Pester to autogenerate the mocks and variables. Although I haven't yet made much progress (priority over time) yet.\n\nScott is on board with the idea so it should be pretty easy to get into Pester once completed.\n. looks like it missed this commit - 3c27cb91bfbc6e44293eef3629cf94200f60a768\n. Not too bad. You went to the level to add the mock in. Almost there for specs.\n. files are in. Freakin awesome. Thanks!\n. Found an annoying issue with UAC - it's fixed now but can you confirm that cygwin runner (not the installation of cygwin) requires administrative access?\n. It was not an issue with your code, but rather how Start-Process -Wait misbehaves when you use -Verb \"RunAs\" and UAC is on. Take a look at this: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/commit/27d9288a30e19b1511006051920b0d0da1f3b367\n. the bug was there all along for Chocolatey-WebPI. I just fixed it for both files\n. That question only answers the installer - not the question I have which is when it runs to download and install packages. Which by the way is freakin awesome. \n. Usually I do as well - UAC is annoying to me. But chocolatey must support it.\n. Awesome. :D\n. Not a problem. About to put out a beta. The best thanks you can give me is finishing the puppet provider. :D\n. I think msiexec already uses start process -wait :D\n. This is a good start. Very highly appreciated!!!\n. We'll have to figure out the uninstall path (I was thinking hints to program files locations [x86 versus not] for the longest time) for the most common scenarios.\n. This is in. Please delete your branch and pull from there to work on additional pieces...\n. Yeah. A whole bunch of helpers for uninstall would be good. Let's see how much choco itself can do without helpers in a parallel track. I'd like to pick this back up once the posh runner uses runspaces.\n. used to be a big file that was broken out. Not sure what you are asking.\n. 0.9.8.16 is still a big file, not broken out.\n. Delete the versioned chocolatey folder from chocolatey\\lib and then from the _packaged_output folder call cinst chocolatey -source %cd%\n. I like how you send me a pull request. DO NOT ACCEPT. lol\n. We can drop it in the package folder to a known file. If it is there we don't really even need a chocolatey uninstall file. :D\n. Shouldn't an uninstall handle the stopping of services/etc? I know that it doesn't always but one would think it should. Pre-uninstall. :D The uninstall before the uninstall. ;)\n. I'd say this is pretty close. Only thing I might do is drop this file in the package directory itself (the versioned one). That way if I have side by side installations I can uninstall them separately if I want. If I understand right, the code changes for each install.\n. Awesome! \n. @tyrken @rismoney auto-uninstall has always been the idea so that an uninstall script would not be necessary with certain installer.\n. Fixed in e5d8eec65ee90b94ad2188d06675b23d4b9d9abc\n. This uses the older easy_install as opposed to pip. http://stackoverflow.com/a/3224103/18475\n. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4750806/how-to-install-pip-on-windows\n. It's so much cleaner than all of that stuff I was doing... :D\n. This is in. Thanks!\n. This is in...thanks man\n. Good thing that is only in the beta. Thanks... Let's get that fixed before release\n. I can take it or you can... seems pretty straightforward.\n. Fixed with PR https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/104\n. Awesome....\n. package availability. Nuget.exe handles all of this on the back end, you just need to send it the right arguments. :D\n. Ha! Just realized through @LucidSage 's commit that you can already do this - `cinst blah -source \"\"source1;source2\"\"` (note the double quotes)\n. https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages\n. These are only the files in the package folder. It's extremely convenient when you have a whole set of executables you want created, which is more often the case in my experience.  \n\nCurious why you more executables in your package folder that you don't want added as redirects versus the ones that you do. Are the others temporary? If so maybe it is better to use a temporary folder and clean it up when you are done using it in chocolateyInstall.ps1.\n\nCan you give me an example @u9520107?\n. It looks like you may have overwritten your repository unintentionally.\n. Looks good, only issue I run into is that you need double quotes around the values since powershell strips them off as it comes in\n. I also noticed that chocolatey already supports multiple sources if you just cinst blah -source \"\"source1;source2\"\" right now...\n. It might be that when it passes it to nuget.exe it is stripping off the quotes (appears that way from your pull request).\n. Thanks! I'm a little lost on when you would reuse the same download for install. The only time that most folks would reuse the file is when there was an issue with the install (usually only helpful while building/testing a package).   \n\nIt brings up questions like  \n1. What if the installer file is corrupted (or for some reason unusable)?\n2. What if the remote file doesn't have different versions? \n.  1 - I like where you are going with that. The head request though, how well does it work with redirects that need cookies? I would prefer that over making pkg authors figure out the MD5 (especially for applications that always have the same url for every version).\n\n 2 - We can communicate information to the helpers - I prefer not making the author pass more information to the helpers when we can easily get the information to the helper through an environment variable.\n\nOne of the biggest benefits of chocolatey is the ease of creating/maintaining packages. We want that to be as straightforward as possible.\n. It's called a redirect loop.\nDownload anything from sourceforge and you will see why a need for cookies on a redirect. Here is the code with a reference https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/helpers/functions/Get-WebFile.ps1#L43-44\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/518181/too-many-automatic-redirections-were-attempted-error-message-when-using-a-http\n. :D\n. I do think this is going to be pulled in...in one form or another.\n. @rismoney agreed.\n. Unless we can guarantee that folks are doing the updates against latest chocolatey code correctly,  I'm not sure we should be advising they do. To do it correctly, they essentially have to do a force push to overwrite history on github and that essentially scares folks.\n. Gary, \n I think it's something we can add as a wiki/markdown file for contributors.\n. Folks, I think I'm implementing the idea of this, but not in the way this pull request was done. Closing this as not fixing.\n. Yep, #428 will be closed in a few.\n. @LucidSage - This is great! I think though that we may want to talk more at length about setting config values. Do you want to start a discussion on the forum?\n\nThings to think about -  \n1. right now when I update chocolatey the global config will be overwritten. Not sure people would like this behavior.\n2. I think I would like the command for changing configuration values to be `chocolatey config` as in chocolatey config _configValue_ [add|remove _values_]. If there is not an add or remove, it will display the current value. And if it's a list it should display all of the values.\n. As I've thought about this more and more, I think I want to move forward with this one. :D\n. Oh right on. I should have came in an looked to see if you had additional messages prior to troubleshooting.... :D\n. Probably a network hiccup.\n. I get that at the end as well. \n. I ran chocolatey afterwards with -debug and things look good. \n. Might be a fluke of some sort in the installer files\n. Could have been worse - https://gist.github.com/2420a607be697debaa44 - DOH!\n. Fixed in f612e17d6339406a829fad2499355b3272d70148\n. So I can close this one because I pulled in the other?\n. What is the original PR for specific folder capability?\n. This is in.\n. Packages for extensions would be named something.extension to make them discoverable. We might want to enforce the convention by only calling the extensions installer if the package name ends in \".extension\"\n. The folder: we could name the folder modules. I think extensions explains the purpose better.\n. Fixed in 0cec008dcd3ca23061740dff7c1bd44f562a9364\n. psm1 - IIS helper may be one. To do something like that we could push the extensions to the admin calls as well if they exist. Then you can take a dependency on the extension - wow this could get really interesting (and confusing).\n\nThis is really an opportunity to see where folks want to take chocolatey and to see what extensions we would bring into the core product. It would also allow folks to add new commands to chocolatey (still working on that one though)\n. I want an IIS helper in the core product - I think we are missing out on many pkg opportunities since the product itself is a website.\n. There are folks out there smarter and better than us and I want to be able to add them into the chocolatey equation. :D\n. Reason for psm1 over ps1, you may have some ps1 functions you want to keep internal so the psm1 serves as the methods you want to expose.\n. Fixed in afd98764188af090e6b3f8569696e37aaa81e47a\n. Thanks! I will be pulling this in this week and pushing out a new version.\n. Might have missed something in there with python. Ruby I converted back to not using the config file or external process.\n. Thanks for reporting this...\n. Per chance does your chocolatey path have spaces in it?\n. Fixed in 8743e1ca28a572c651e4464a2037047924b9b7a3\n. I found that the easy.install nuget package (I don't own is a little wonky). It may take a couple of tries to get it to work right.\n. Why closed?\n. Great question, but one for @rismoney \n. Cver serves the purpose of finding what the local package is on based on the remote package. Cup uses cver.\n\nBut I think I understand what you are saying... calling it to just query the local versions.\n. When I need to use switches, I don't pass them as parameters but I set them globally. That seems to work in PowerShell versus passing them.\n. and I thought about the last night. I think it should be renamed to localonly so if the switch exists then we only look locally. Thoughts?\n. like -force and -pre\n. This is in...\n. We do use a proxy. Try adding -debug switch to your calls to see if you get anymore information on what is happening...\n. Thanks! I have a multi core processor and I haven't noticed this as an issue but I'll definitely take a look\n. Maybe that is an issue then... :D\n. This has been merged c540769811b452f28edbca759ae7c822769acdb2\n. Workaround for now is to just call cinst packagename\n. We may need to talk about his some more. Never heard of it before...\n. I think we'll likely pull this in... :D\n. This is in. Thanks for the contribution!\n. You are using master branch for pull requests...\nWe like to keep things concise and ask that the pull requests come in from specific branches...\n. If you need help with this I would be glad to discuss\n. yes, unless you can update this current one...\n. I don't think that is possible though... When you create the new one, make sure you reference this one before you close it. \n. Pull request moved to https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/130\n. Will be later this week or next week before I get to the pull requests. :D\n. I take it the local only meets your needs. If so, please close this issue.\n. It might be better in the upcoming release... I think that is what @rismoney was saying. Thanks for the suggestion. \n. The ChocolateyInstall variable lets you install it where ever you want. https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/Installation\n\nChocolatey installs to the root of the system drive which just happens to be C on most machines by default. Curiosity on why this is not clean? \n\nIt depends on your definition of warning, but it clearly logs out where it is installing to during the installation: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/nuget/tools/chocolateysetup.psm1#L159\n\nA prompt stops execution and waits on user input. This goes against the ideas behind chocolatey, which is unattended installs, even of itself. The upgrade process of chocolatey uses chocolatey and that would result in a 'cup all' execution stopping, which might upset folks who want the whole thing to just happen silently in the background. \n\nFor the folks who want more power over their experience, that is why we provide you the ability to change your conventions and pass in Install Arguments for packages (https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CommandsInstall). \n. Ruby, Python, PHP, CygWin, PostgreSQL, etc, also install to the root of the system drive as a default. I'm never sure why some folks feel the program files is more clean (not saying this is where you suggested, just that other folks have). \n\nTo me if something goes to the program files it also goes to the registry as an installed application, one that can be uninstalled from programs list in the control panel. To me having things in there that are not controlled through the system install registry is not clean so I wouldn't see chocolatey there.\n\nThe other location, User Path (C:\\Users\\username and C:\\Documents and Settings\\username) to me starts to scare me based on the character limit in batch based redirects (not sure if it used to be 255 character path length or not). I don't want to get into cases where we go \"C:\\Documents And Settings\\ALongUserNameCuzICanUse32Chars\\Chocolatey\\lib\" (which is already over 70 characters) before we get to the actual folder. Plus I don't know about you, but if I need to break into the lib folder for some reason, that's a lot of folder navigation. It's already bad enough I have to go 3 folders deep, I get irritated when I have to drop 5 folders just to get to something useful. Not that I always use folder navigation starting with computer.\n\nSo to me, and you don't have to agree, the systemroot is much cleaner. And for those that don't agree, that's why we provide a means to install to some other directory.\n\nThoughts?\n. I also don't feel this way about everything. Somethings I would rather see in a subfolder. I'm not even really sure what and when I want to see things in systemroot versus a subfolder like c:\\tools (where I put many useful tools I find).\n\n I reserve the right to contradict myself. ;) (quote originated from Oren Eine)\n. It's all good. We can agree to disagree on this one.\n\nOne thing I also didn't mention is the low privilege install aspect of chocolatey (another reason we shy away from Program Files). Non administrators can install chocolatey (through one of the methods, not sure if the default will work) and be able to run chocolatey for non-administrative installs of applications (aka what chocolatey calls tools).  I'm not sure if you've checked, but Program Files requires higher privileges than the Users group to be able to write to the folder (at least on Windows 7, I didn't check all the others).\n. Guess I didn't have a wiki page up yet: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/Uninstallation\n. We could provide a version of chocolatey that would \"install\" to the system meaning program files and the install registry. Would always run under administrative rights and other things... of course this version would likely cost money since it would be for commercial/enterprise uses.  \n\nI did my time with massive scale enterprise applications. I am very familiar with SOx and many of the good things developers should do (like principle of least privilege)...  \n\nChocolatey is free, OSS and meant for consumer purposes in it's current existence. It's not perfect, but it is also not v1 either. And even when it is I wouldn't expect perfection. Perfect software has problems shipping. ;)\n. Based on the following, where would you install chocolatey (some repetition from this discussion)? https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/DefaultChocolateyInstallReasoning\n\nI am really curious, I am not trying to be facetious. I welcome healthy discussion (including healthy arguments). :)\n. Yep, we make use of that in some places. :D\n. Closing this for now pending further discussion.\n. That's definitely not right. Can you list whatyou've  installed thus far?\n\nOn Tuesday, October 22, 2013, Nathanael Jones wrote:\n\n> Is every chocolatey application supposed to install in C:\\ as well?

I will take a look this weekend hopefully :D\n. Since I pulled in the other it's reasonable that this can be closed. Thanks for the contribution though!\n. The only thing I think would be acceptable is to pass those items through the command line and have them passed as header values when making the request (if they are there).\n\nThat would get you into the src/helpers/Get-WebFile.ps1 (I think it is called)\n. Short answer: I'd like to stay away from storing sensitive information in a file with chocolatey (at least for now). \n\ntl;dr\n\nThere is a config file, but I don't want passwords in a file. Some folks put chocolatey in a dropbox folder so they can move it easily between computers. I don't quite agree with this b/c it gets things out of sync (what do you really have natively installed on this computer?) and can cause confusion when updating all of your packages. Some folks like it though. While I don't agree with it/support it, I don't want to introduce changes to chocolatey that limit their ability to do so. If we had some kind of encrypted string in a file it may not translate between computers (depending on the algorithm used). In the past (in other projects) we've used X509 certificates to get a good algorithm between machines. I don't want to take chocolatey in this direction of complexity (using certificates) unless it is absolutely required (read: it's probably not).\n\nI could be wrong, but the way you save secure string to a file is still machine specific (http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/csharpgeneral/thread/d4557d9b-6e7d-4695-bfd0-a22a08e06160/ | http://stackoverflow.com/a/6982430/18475). To save the securestring to a file you would use some algorithm which usually ties you to the machine (or store the IV you would need somewhere, which still gets us into the same issue if we want to store that with chocolatey's directory). Or use X509 certificates, which opens up even more complexity than the other methods (how to install, where to install, what about permissions to the private key, how to sync between machines, etc).\n\nOne of Chocolatey's tenants is simplicity. Note that simplicity is not the opposite of complex, only the opposite of complicated. I don't want a complicated experience for users. So whatever answer we come up with, it should not impact the user experience in a detrimental way.\n. With choco.exe, this is already resolved. This closes when we switch in the new repository.\n. @skyguy94 \n\n> I'm not certain I get the argument here. If my summary is correct, then Chocolatey complicates behavior by breaking a NuGet feature.\n\nChocolatey != NuGet\n\nYou are also treading on a 2 year old comment. ;)\n. Chocolatey uses the NuGet packaging infrastructure. \n\nPer the comments on active/unresolved: This is unresolved in current releases of choco b/c the code to do so could have been very painful in POSH, and we've been holding off on some things we knew were painful until the rewrite. Although this is an issues list, some things are enhancements (although this one is not marked as one though...) :/.\n\nThis has sat because we didn't have a good solution at the time. Apologies, hopefully many of the current issues will be cleaned up.\n. @codearoo clarification - choco.exe uses `nuget.core.dll`, not `nuget.exe`.\n. All nuget packages will continue to work. That would be unwise of us without a long term deprecation. I would assume that we tend to handle compatibility well on the team and deprecations. But with your concern, maybe that is not the case? \n. The installation instructions also say you do this from a command line (cmd.exe) and not a powershell prompt. Were you getting these errors from the command line?\n. perfect :D\n. Original discussion here: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/124\n. Multiple reasons:\n1. Once you have a pull request out from master you cannot do anything additional or it will affect the pull request\n2. You really can't have multiple pull requests at the same time.\n3. It's not as easy for me to see the straight line from where you made changes IF you update your master with my latest changes.\n4. Following the above, it messes up the nice straight line for git history if you update the master with my latest changes when I go to pull them in.\n. If you take a look at the history of chocolatey (gitk from the command line or if you have gitextensions installed you can see it as well)\n. Do you want to see if https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/119 meets your needs?\n. The tool that chocolatey uses for downloads doesn't appear to allow me to do this, but we can keep chocolatey from trying to do anything further with the packages once they are there.\n. I like where you are going. Install and update both ignore dependencies... the trick is how do you get cup all to work correctly...? I'm thinking if someone puts in ignore dependencies and those dependencies are installed, we want to go ahead and clean them up right then during install (or update). If they are already there we just move on.\n. Well that is interesting. If you installed ruby and then called for devkit it should not have....oooohhhhh, freaking nuget algorithm with dependencies. It still should not have installed another version of ruby with an existing one there. We will be upgrading the nuget client once we get a fix released from a bug report I filed a couple weeks ago (the fix is in the code base now, just waiting on the out of band release).\n. My take is we allow someone to pass the switch. In the documentation we say results are not guaranteed. If someone complains, we say it's a sharp tool that won't constrain you but you better understand what you are doing or it will cut you.\n\nThat's the way I like tools to be. Allow folks to take off all of the safety guards if they need to.\n. It should not have upgraded a dependency that was already met.\n. It should be in the prerelease.\n\nOn Monday, September 30, 2013, jamescrowley wrote:\n\n> Is this available at the moment?

This is fixed...\n. I could always add a link. Please add this an an issue on http://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org/\n. As much as possible I would like to avoid something powershell from the command line. The inner guts of chocolatey are powershell, but the way folks use it from the outside doesn't have to be. \n. Ha! I actually typed out the word \"powershell-y\" but then removed it. :D\n\nYou can access that within the ps1 (it's gets set as an environment variable), but are you worried about it moving on to the installer?\n. More information on how it is used: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/helpers/functions/Install-ChocolateyInstallPackage.ps1#L51-53\n. `$env:chocolateyInstallArguments`\n\nDo you think this might be better as an addition to https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/helpers/functions/Install-ChocolateyZipPackage.ps1\n. Like we'd leave it as `installarguments` but allow the settings to override defaults in chocolatey zip package function?\n. I'm closing this as a dupe of #159 - that's where the work was done. Use -params \n. @alyssenko-ssi An environment variable for Install Arguments was implemented. However it should not be looked at all for packages. If you need information from the user, one should be using `$env:chocolateyPackageParameters`, see #159. \n. WHAT?! That's awesome. \n. The initial workings for this are in b87541a5fe5ec04c4a29846c761e528f9070b3b3 - we'll see what other things crop up.\n. @ForNeVeR We already have the powershell refresh in and once the commands become aliases back to the module methods, you will see this happen automatically as there will be no call out to a batch and then back into powershell.\n. Fixed in a09e15896fbc5e790b17b6699cd6b50bc7eb14e4\n. The current state is that unless you import the chocolateyinstaller module, you won't automatically get path updates. Importing the module isn't recommended at this time but some folks are experimenting with it.\n\nWith cmd.exe you can just call RefreshEnv after an install that would update something in your environment and it will update your session's environment.\n. system vars require admin - that's why the default goes to user. \n\nTo go to system, it would just take adding them manually and applying this fix for now.\n\nI think in the future we could make the installer smarter.\n. Weird. Interesting. It might be a bug somewhere in chocolatey's installer script.\n. I would be fine with more named parameters in there. \n\nKeep in mind that whatever is done, it should work without the supplied parameters or property files.\n. Think I'm getting ready to pull this in. We'll also be rewriting this to make it a ton cleaner as well.\n. This being the installer, not your code. :)\n. Definitely want to get this into .21\n. I don't think is necessary now. 0.9.8.24 had some major improvements to how it handles environment variables during install. \n\nThis is superseded by #453 which was later superseded by #486.\n. I have two pull requests for FTP support. Probably time to start a document on \"So you want to contribute?\"\n. I like this...quite a bit. Whatever you do though, don't update your repository with my latest changes. I think that document for contributions is going to get written soon. \n\nWe usually want people to contribute pull requests from a branch that is not master. That allows you to contribute multiple patches that way and doesn't get us into where we need to cherry pick your commits to keep the history in a nice straight line. \n. we'll be pulling it in soon.\n. This is in...thanks for the contribution!\n. This won't work of course until we release the next version of chocolatey (0.9.8.20), but that should be by the end of the month.\n\nYou can download and play with a prerelease version now.\n. This goes out into full release in a couple of days. So many new things being added. :D\n. grats for the update. Gonna try to get this in this weekend.\n. This is in... thanks! \n. Looks like this may have messed something up with the get config values...\n. Nevermind, this was my bad... \n. Thanks. Not sure why I didn't get an email on this...\n. I think this is still valid.\n. I also have one in email from someone on this as well.\n. This only happens on the session (or existing sessions) that you do the install from, correct?\n. Once you close and open a new powershell session, this works appropriately, correct?\n. Or you actually checked the environment path and it wasn't there and then added that to your session?\n. Last time I checked that only updates your current session, not the path variables stored on your machine.\n. I'm referring to opening control panel, system, advanced, variables and the PATH variables in there. There is one for user and one for system. Just b/c it doesn't end up in your current session (of powershell or cmd) doesn't mean it didn't get added to the actual path.\n\nHere's an experiment: open the system stuff in control panel and then go back to your powershell session and add c:\\bob; to the path the same way you did in powershell. Now look in the actual path to see if it got added. Both places (user and system). Now close and reopen powershell. Write-host your path. Is c:\\bob still there?\n. I think I like that better dropped into a new issue - your fix... please submit as an enhancement.\n. Just FYI - choco 0.9.10 supports this now without closing and reopening your shell - https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/664\n. @acgetchell Can you tell me the output of calling refreshenv? Does it say \"Refreshing for ***cmd.exe***\" or does it say for ***powershell.exe***?  If it says the former, it means you do not have the PowerShell profile installed - which provides this and tab completion.\r\n\r\nSee https://chocolatey.org/docs/troubleshooting#why-does-choco-intab-not-work-for-me on how to remedy this so that when you call refreshenv, it is the PowerShell version that is being called and not refreshenv.bat. . Please see https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/991 and https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/894 to get a better understanding of why this isn't set by default on install.. I also filed https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1392. @acgetchell Looks like an artifact of already having that in the PATH when you ran it the second time. It doesn't show that environment variables like PATH were updated in the output and I don't see a call to refreshenv here.. okay\n. Any chance you get this to me in a branch (not master)? There are two other commits in here that are not related to this pull request.\n\nPlus it helps if you want to send multiple PRs at a time.\n. Sorry for the confusion. Branch on your end and make the changes there. A branch named something like the issue itself. Send the pull request TO master. ;)\n. This looks awesome. Thanks!\n. Awesome. :D\n. Taking a look right now...\n. Ran it with /l*v %cd%\\msi.log and found the issue.  \n\n```\nMSI (s) (D0!FC) [12:12:38:922]: PROPERTY CHANGE: Adding HideFatalErrorForm property. Its value is 'TRUE'.\nThis setup requires the .NET Framework version 2.0.50727.  Please install the .NET Framework and run this setup again.  The .NET Framework can be obtained from the web.  Would you like to do this now?\nCustomAction VSDCA_VsdLaunchConditions returned actual error code 1603 (note this may not be 100% accurate if translation happened inside sandbox)\nAction ended 12:12:38: VSDCA_VsdLaunchConditions. Return value 3.\nAction ended 12:12:38: INSTALL. Return value 3.\n```\n\nI'm thinking Win8 doesn't come with .NET framework 2.0. I believe you can install that right from chocolatey using webpi as a source, but you will need to list out the available packages so you can install it.\n\nOne thing we might think about doing is adding a .net framework 2.0 package so other packages can depend on it. It would work much the same way as .net 4.5, where it only goes to install if it doesn't find the installed registry key it is looking for.\n. Closing as not a chocolatey issue.\n. Thanks, definitely something that can be added.\n\nThe option of adding executable containing folders to the path would add quite a bit of noise to your path depending on how many tools you install.\n. Shimgen has fixed this. \n. Now this is awesome! With tests, that's a plus 1000. :D\n. I think all should do that. It aligns well with other package managers. Just haven't yet gotten to that one.\n.

Thanks! This is probably better to do in general than looking at a file. \n. This is in... thanks!\n. It's the capital \"I\". I thought I had fixed all of those.\n. First fix in 556024f1482370bb3b056276ae08689b3ddcc064\n. Are you still finding issues?\n. I symlink or just run the tests as part of the build. You will need pester installed.\n. Command is a bit harder, but for powershell you suggested the following: \n\n``` powershell\nEnv:PATH = (@(,[Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('PATH', 'Machine') -s\nplit ';') + @([Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('PATH', 'User') -split ';') | Select -Unique) -join ';'\n```\n. https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/134\n. It's in issue #134\n. How do you do a full environment refresh? I would love for that to happen with both powershell and command...\n. Install-ChocolateyPath actually pushes the new path...perhaps we can emulate that a bit.\n. But it won't carry all the way back to the command line. That's what I'm hoping that crazy poshcode will do.\n. Boo...\n. Need both powershell and cmd shell versions... \n\n@mwrock we'd need to iterate over all of them.\n. Command line - (it's ugly) - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/171588/is-there-a-command-to-refresh-environment-variables-from-the-command-prompt-in-w\n. HA! We found the same article!\n. I'm down for it if it works. :D\n. It just show up too many times per package (the errors are displayed more than once sometimes). \n. Same goes for success logging.\n\nAs far as the holding area, yeah, I think we install the packages to a holding area - when they are successful we copy them up (prior to running the exe locator).\n. You can add to the wiki page... please mention the binroot for packages - we have the concept of having some packages install to another directory if someone defines an environment variable.\n. And it should be mentioned that if you want to override the default installation, just add to the installation arguments the correct switch and location for the particular native installer - jhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CommandsInstall \n\nThe important part is that you need to be intimate enough with the package to know this...\n. Lots of questions in here. \n\nI would point to the FAQ question from the create packages page - and maybe put a little blurb that highlights the difference. It is definitely an asked question, and frequently. :)\n\nThere is a push for an Install-ChocolateyTool function - in that function it would look up the binRoot (or whatever we call it once it is in chocolatey).\n\nConsole2 is a tool (no native installer). But there are other ways to get tools - which download the archived version (.zip, .7z, .tar) and then unpack it to somewhere. Lots of these just unpack it into the package folder itself, which allows the executables to be found by chocolatey and put on the path.\n\nAs far as MSIs and native installers - the person who wrote these had in mind a location for the application to install to (in program files). This IMHO should stay the default. I know the argument can be made that there are some packages that don't, but this is due to the littering of the systemdrive with installs. Usually MSIs are easier to work with since 99% of the time they have the same installation switches, one of which is the install location.\n\nThe general idea behind chocolatey is to move to less and less work being required in the chocolateyInstall.ps1. We want to address patterns and make that easier so that one can just call one line functions. You can see there are a lot of packages that already go that route (if they are just pulling in an application). \n. One thing we will likely do in the future is allow folks to pass in the installer type (NSIS, InstallShield, etc). Then we can make assumptions on some of the switches. This is closer to what I saw chef was starting to do in their default provider for windows. I also saw it in another package manager that is now defunct.\n. Is this seriously a behavior in Powershell? That it messes up the PATH user env var if it doesn't exist?! You think it would treat it fine... \n\nThanks for reporting, guess we are going to need to look into it a little more.\n. Fixed by https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/699\n. Implemented in choco.exe as `choco new`.\n. Ha - the don't pull yet is still in the one that is outstanding. :D\n. I'm one of those archaic users that spends more time on the straight command line shell. :( \n. you can just call dir in powershell (although it's an alias of something else now).\n. Maybe that brings up the idea of opening something native to powershell with chocolatey - and installing it to their profile (much like poshgit/hg/whathaveyou do).  It still looks like the native command but it doesn't fall down to the command shell. \n\nAs in Set-Alias cinst Chocolatey-Install (and for all the rest). :D\n. Agreed on what Matt said. And if they haven't, they will find chocolatey fairly useless in powershell as well. :D\n. The real trick is finding the modules since someone can install it to other folders. We could also provide a module that is dot-sourced with all of the commands we want seen.\n. I'd prefer not documenting the conventions on the methods, even though those could be used as well.\n\ncinst (so it's one for both interfaces) references Install-ChocolateyPackage (or something similar if we have a naming conflict).\ncup - Update-ChocolateyPackage\ncver - List-ChocolateyVersion (or something like this)\ncuninst - Uninstall-ChocolateyPackage \n. LOL - Export-ModuleMember is exactly what chocolatey already does for the utility functions it allows the chocolateyInstall.ps1 to use. \n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/helpers/chocolateyInstaller.psm1#L12\n. @mwrock Did those separate issues get created? \n. This already exists today? installargs - https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CommandsInstall\n\nIs this not the same?\n. Yes. This gives someone direct access to the native installer so they can pass their own arguments and even override the args going to it.  It's really a power user feature b/c it puts you right against the metal.\n. So you could be talking about something slightly different...\n. We've already talked about the -platform x86 switch - I think there is an enhancement listed for that (and if not, let's make sure it gets listed). :D\n. -platform is for the utility function which the package dev has no access to. So the key is completely transparent to them.\n. We need to get this in for the next version. Granted it will be rudimentary, but it is necessary for a recent package issue where the vendor wanted you to pass something or fail the package.\n. How about `choco something -params \"@{bob=1;bill=2}\"`\n. This is very naive as mentioned in the commit (no spaces and must be specified in EXACTLY the format shown). If you want to start playing with it though, it's in the just sent out prerelease.\n\n`cinst chocolatey -version 0.9.8.22-alpha1`\n. $env:chocolateyPackageParameters in the package....\n.

Well that is easy enough to fix... ;)\n. Here we go `choco something -params 'value1=bob;value2=''with spaces'''` - the two single quotes `value2=''with spaces''` will be converted to `value2=\"with spaces\"`\n. @rismoney @Iristyle Interesting idea proposed by you guys - the chocolateyInstall.ps1 becomes chocolateyRun.ps1 and in it it contains functions that chocolatey will call \n\n``` powershell\nfunction ShouldInstall {}\nfunction InstallSteps {}\nfunction ConfigureSteps {} #optional, in case folks want things installed but not configured.\nfunction UninstallSteps {}\n```\n. I guess the comment here is if I install the package for a pre-existing installation and it doesn't run the install steps, Can I still uninstall the application with chocolatey?\n. See, this is where I disagree. To me this is a nice way of making chocolatey aware of existing apps and taking over the updating of those items.\n\nBut I can see the argument for both ways.  The question is, even with a switch to get both behaviors, what is the default?\n\nBy default now it uninstalls (in the case where ruby 1.87 comes in and you already have 1.87 installed).\n. Second question - \n I have ruby installed but an older version. How far back should the ruby package be looking as acceptable?\n\nIf you have 1.8.7.123 (not sure on the last part of the version, this is an example) and the installer pulls down 1.8.7.124, should it go ahead and upgrade the older version?  Now contrast that with 1.8.7 and 1.9.3? \n\nThere are situations we will run into where an app requires a specific version of a dependency. Consider how that should work as you consider the answer for this. I might have ruby 1.8.7 installed, but the app requires 1.9.3 to be installed. What should happen in this case? \n. Of course, if I have 1.8.7.123 installed and the package that comes down is 1.8.7.123, this is where I want this behavior to not install. \n\nI have to throw out how idempotent is the process right now? Most apps don't f things up when you run the installer multiple times.\n. You said it here and I said it on the issue itself. Ha. :D\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/165#issuecomment-8741741\n. The neat thing here is that what it does now without all of this extra work DOES bring an existing install inline with chocolatey. \n. It's a matter of perception, but I would want chocolatey to take over something I have existing if I issued the request for it to install it.  I mean, after all, don't you think I already know I have git installed when I ask it to install git?\n. ```\nDEBUG: Running 'Get-ConfigValue' with\nconfigValue:'useNuGetForSources'\nDEBUG: Running 'Get-UserConfigValue' with\nconfigValue:'useNuGetForSources'\nDEBUG: After checking the user config the value of\n'useNuGetForSources' is 'false'\nDEBUG: Running 'Get-UserConfigValue' with configValue:'sources'\nDEBUG: Running 'Get-GlobalConfigValue' with configValue:'sources'\nDEBUG: System.Xml.XmlDocument\nDEBUG: chocolatey.sources\nDEBUG: Using '-Source \"\" ' as the source arguments\nDEBUG: Calling NuGet.exe install cygwin -Outputdirectory\n\"C:\\Chocolatey\\lib\" -Source \"\"\n```\n. Okay, so this is my fault. Thought I was correcting something back so that it would work with powershell3...\n. Fixed in 784e45fb3b94e71a2d11b43c6c67c791e2396804\n. This is tagged for the next release... :)\n. Since we have http://chocolatey.org/installabsolutelatest.ps1, is this still important?\n. :D\n. Even better - except in cases where they don't set up the proxy stuff. But we can always do that after the fact. I don't want to give the illusion that we are not going to handle some of that in the back end.\n. I have to say I like @ewilde 's approach. It's closer to what I was initially thinking. I could go both ways though, it just depends on how much work we want to do with each new set of options.\n\nIt's kind of like the argument between primitive parameters versus object parameters. Except in this case both are objects, just one isn't the actual object used.\n\nSomeone could still not use our utility functions if they need more control over that and I think that is a fair trade.\n\nThoughts?\n. This was fixed for choco v0.9.10 - see https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/332\n. With anything like this, we would have a need to support the existing infrastructure while we phase it out, so it would be something that package makers can move to over time.\n\nI know I'm preaching to the choir here but I just wanted to make sure that was understood before any work started.\n. Seems reasonable. If it is local it should just forward it to cver\n. -source local\n\nTHoughts?\n. The trick here is the searching filter...so maybe not the same code. Or is it?\n. Closing this as a duplicate of a newer issue.. .I know.. #276 \n. I'm not sure I like the name of it yet. It really doesn't tell me what it is doing.\n. How does it work with bindir? \n. So I install a tool package - that tool uses bin dir so it installs to something like c:/tools/packagename where it auto adds a that directory to the path. How do I trace that back to the package itself as it wouldn't be as easy to find?\n. I'm not against this, I just want to really understand it better.\n. Ok, right on.

Then I pull the changes. Then I rebase against all of the current. And if all goes well (usually does), I just merge back to master.\n\nIt keeps the commit history a nice straight line. Don't think of commit history so linearly ;)\n. For me, if someone is willing to keep their PR up to date, I'm okay with\nthat (if they do it without creating multiple lines of history).\n\nBut when it takes awhile for a project team to evaluate PRs, it should not\nbe on the person who took the time to create the patch in the first place.\nIt should be the responsibility of the project team. I've submitted PRs\nbefore where this happened a few times. I felt is was kind of against\netiquette of the project team to have an expectation for me to keep up with\nthem when they were taking their time to evaluating my request.\n\nI don't want to create this same feeling on chocolatey as it doesn't really\ncreate a feeling of community. If we wait awhile before evaluating\nrequests, that is on us and we should be feeling a little pain (if there is\nsome) rather than the person who is taking time to contribute to our\nproject.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nOn Friday, April 19, 2013, Rich Siegel wrote:\n\n> your the boss ;) how do you back that branch to the parent commit and then\n> pull the changes.

Need to start looking at this one for the release after this one.\n. Yeah, I was slowly going through and tagging things we want to move. This particular thing is planned as we rewrite the helpers into compiled powershell cmd-lets.\n. This was fixed in choco for 0.9.10 https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/332\n. Before anyone goes down this path, we need to discuss some changes going into chocolatey.org.\n\nI always expect the project site to be the actual project, not a github repo for someone. It should never point back.\n\nSpecifically we are putting together a profile page for package owners where they can list contact information and a few sites including the repository where they keep their packages.\n- https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org/issues/10\n- https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org/issues/11\n\nThere are some other neat things that will be put in (like marking a pkg as outdated, or broken) - https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org/issues/12 \n. @rismoney Not sure what you are trying to say here...\n. I say we close with enhancing chocolatey.org for now.\n. You know discussions are great in the google group. ;)\n. Gaaah, NuGet schema validation decides it is an error and there is no way to tell it otherwise... at least not yet.\n\nThe element 'metadata' in namespace 'http://schemas.microsoft.com/packaging/2010/07/nuspec.xsd' has invalid child element 'packageRepositoryUrl' in namespace 'http://schemas.microsoft.com/packaging/2010/07/nuspec.xsd'. List of possible elements expected: 'frameworkAssemblies, copyright, iconUrl, developmentDependency, dependencies, references, language, requireLicenseAcceptance, licenseUrl' in namespace 'http://schemas.microsoft.com/packaging/2010/07/nuspec.xsd'.\n\nI'm thinking I'm going to need  special build of nuget.core to avoid this behavior.\n. For references see\n- https://nuget.codeplex.com/discussions/240844\n- https://nuget.codeplex.com/discussions/238253\n- https://twitter.com/ferventcoder/status/523894747031949312\n. I started down this path on https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org/issues/101 - but got held up in that nuget throws the error above if you add anything it doesn't recognize to the schema.\n. Also #352 is sort of a dupe\n. I've moved this issue to https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/205\n. Looks good. Merge it in. Remember to keep my line straight. ;)\n. Interesting. So you are saying if it is called we go ahead and write the filename.ignore on it? That would be cool.\n. Shouldn't be too hard. Slap a tiny ignore file next to it no matter where it is. No one is going to complain if it is up in the temp dir. :D\n. Done 6a4961692162496f00d36381542e7bc5c0aae824\n. To be clear, this is for apps that when pulled don't require further compilation. So in effect these are still \"binary\" packages...\n. Is this still relevant?\n. This may already be done for 0.9.8.20.\n. It's right here: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/helpers/functions/Get-WebFile.ps1#L21 \n. I'm closing this as ready for the next release. Unless you have questions or comments?\n. We are also looking at bumping up the buffer. Try this bump that number to 1048576  \n\n``` powershell\n[byte[]]$buffer = new-object byte[] 1048576\n```\n. This is in. I had to bump it down to 100 iterations with the larger buffer pipe. Please let me know if that is too low and still grabs too much memory\n. I think these would be helpful in chocolatey as well. We are always moving forward to pulling as much logic into utility functions and out of packages so that packages can stay small and readable. And the other side effect is that we can fix/update logic without having to edit a bunch of packages. \n. This prolly makes the intent clearer, but the code was never broken. Just FYI. We're gonna need to work on those merge commits...\n. The parameters are read in the helper functions, so it's completely transparent to the package unless pkg maintainer wanted to know about them and use them.\n. Bad or good - the arguments passed into chocolatey are global (powershell script thing). Like I said, this makes it more direct and less transparent to the methods where this comes from.\n. This is completed 41c87c064d3c73c933dba9a4a5ee72a435a3ab2d\n. Great question...going to need to look at history for that one. The functionality here is to return a string that is up to 8 chars long padded w/zeroes on the front. I think this pull request may have broken that functionality\n. Actually the thought here it to completely rip this out with something better at some point. This was a stop gap solution.\n.  This is very interesting territory.  However this may be better suited to be tackled after v1.\n. I'm a little scared of editing the registry uninstaller values. That could get us into some dangerous territory. However it does pose a very interesting scenario.\n. Maybe I'm biased, but a package owner (not author of tool/app) is not who I would want to have this either. If anything, this would be something that we might eventually bake into chocolatey and expose through a function to package owners.\n. Thanks, will likely be pulling this in over the weekend.\n. This is completed - bd03ec769c550d534dedef803781b0a066fca082\n. Will be looking this over and merging soon, likely this weekend.\n. I just realized what you are doing here. calling nuget list without a filter will only return so many results. 635 is what it looks like it returned. nuget.org, one of the two default sources for chocolatey, has over 9200 packages. Chocolatey has about 550 at the moment. If this only pulls back around 500 results from each source, you can see how this becomes inaccurate really quickly. \n\nI should be able to take the 1 second of sleep time out of this.\n. Agreed on refactoring - need to get in a PR that might fix this prior to a refactor though.\n. Is this still relevant?\n. Not disagreeing with any of these points. All polish and eventually where chocolatey will be.\n\nI was thinking `choco` would be a good entry point - easy and short. You might have mentioned it in your stuff here.\n. The problem with this issue/enhancement is that it is not one issue enhancement but several.\n. A great forum for this would be like the google group - then we can list them out and point to the topic\n. Agreed on the wiki - I would love to have a http://chocolatey.github.com \n. I accept pull requests on the chocolatey.github.com repo. I won't be able to get to this myself for a few weeks.\n. This is called choco.\n. I know there a LOT of issues to look through, but this should already be in the issues log as an enhancement. We don't fully support uninstall until 0.9.9. That's when it will have helper utility functions.  If you look around a bit, for MSIs we are goung to store the guid. Then when you uninstall we'll just /x guid /quiet. Nothing else necessary. \n. Dumb question on Air installations, shouldn't there be an AIR package?\n. @bswerdlen Howdy, note one of the labels here says \"MoveToChoco\" - that means this issue either has been or still needs migrated over to the current codebase at https://github.com/chocolatey/choco.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm guessing this wasn't helpful for you - https://chocolatey.org/docs/helpers-uninstall-chocolatey-package\r\n\r\nWhen you run `choco new pkgid` from a recent version of Chocolatey, it will create a chocolateyUninstall.ps1 that is already pre-filled out with everything you need, saving you countless amount of time (and possible issues). Plus all of the just in time documentation that you get from that will definitely help answer questions like this ahead of time.\r\n\r\nWhile MSU is definitely showing up in Install-ChocolateyInstallPackage - https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/blob/946367a6c263cc2d1b3beec5e6b771404d5f0436/src/chocolatey.resources/helpers/functions/Install-ChocolateyInstallPackage.ps1#L257-L265, it doesn't appear the same exists in the Uninstall-ChocolateyPackage  - The documentation that is produced (linked above) states the same. You can see the source code that generates that documentation at https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/blob/946367a6c263cc2d1b3beec5e6b771404d5f0436/src/chocolatey.resources/helpers/functions/Uninstall-ChocolateyPackage.ps1#L52-L56\r\n\r\nHTH . Try just  \\server\\share\\etc\n. Ftp is already in for next release.\n\nTo change the vocabulary a little, it's not a workaround, it's how it works\nnow. We don't have support for urls written in that manner. If we want\nfile:// that would be an enhancement. same with git://\n\nThanks.\nOn Oct 26, 2012 12:49 PM, \"Alastair Smith\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> That workaround works, thanks.

Thanks, please open this issue on chocolateyautomaticpackages though. It's not chocolatey's fault. ;)\n. I think we are on different pages, although I like what you are talking about here.\n. http://chocolatey.org/packages/binroot\n. There are other items that may have duplicated this. This is done.\n. @Redsandro Hey thanks for the kudos!  \nI'm going to clarify the wording for chocolatey - Chocolatey is **_like**_ apt-get. This doesn't mean that is has every feature or that it is an exact replica of apt-get.   \n\nThis also doesn't mean that features like this cannot be added. We've discussed this a couple of times in the mailing list, however upon searching it doesn't appear that it was ever made into an Enhancement. We are definitely adding this feature.  \n\n## Issue 2 - Stopping on Error\n\nThe second note, that chocolatey stops on error is not a behavior we want in v1. Please file it as a separate issue.\n. Also, it's important to note that apt-get is very stable in it's feature set. It's been around for awhile and is a mature product.\n\nChocolatey on the other hand is not even to v1 yet. It's immature and not stable in it's feature set yet. Something to keep in mind. :D\n. Actually I would have to verify, but I believe npackd is older. Chocolately has been around for about a year and a half.\n\nI don't mind nitpicky at all! It's a way we get better. I honestly don't use packages.config that much. I prefer  \n\n`cinst all -source customsource` or to put together a .ps1 file w/separate calls. Both of these mean I install multiple packages w/1 call, but there is setup time involved.  If you are in powershell you can create an array of package names and pipe them into the install command. Again, not optimal, but available.\n\nThat's why we definitely want the ability to pass in a list and to keep going if one fails.\n. This lifehacker article about npackd is older by a month than chocolatey: http://m.lifehacker.com/5754305/npackd-is-a-linux+like-package-manager-for-windows\n\nAnd to avoid confusion, the date of the article is a month before chocolatey development started.\n. Agreed that the xml batch stopping on error is annoying.\n. This is fixed in https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/commit/6ca7ed1fe2d9f45fcfb3f84bbb2aa9811a544ff2\n. also in alpha2 prerelease... \n. or `cup chocolatey -pre`\n. This sounds reasonable at first glance, however, does it feel natural to say --beta when it installs an alpha or rc?\n\nAnd .... if there was a beta version and a more recent alpha, wouldn't you want it to install the beta and not the alpha based on the wording of the switch? \n. My brain is ...... well somewhat fried. :)\n. Thanks for moving this over from #191\n. It's all good. Wasn't sure if you were misspelling or not.\n. not sure what you mean... new batch functionality... \n. Also an issue we hope to resolve soon.\n\nOn Monday, November 4, 2013, Redsandro wrote:\n\n> I concur, but I lack the knowledge and the knowhow to propose a fix. :)\n> I'm\n> better at making .bat wrappers. :P\n> On Nov 5, 2013 12:17 AM, \"TomOne\" <notifications@github.com<javascript:_e({}, 'cvml', 'notifications@github.com');>>\n> wrote:\n> \n> > This is actually a very important issue to solve.

Is this fixed in vCurrent?\n. @rismoney oldie but a goodie. Now we have a ticket for ensuring full stop if there is a failure in the chain - https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1151. Right now it is up to the package maintainer. The functionality is there, but it's in the packages. It might make sense to have choco note some of these so pkg maintainers do not need to.\n. well, 3010. :)\n\nFor now anyway, that is the expectation. It does make sense that chocolatey should do a better job of noting the common ones though.\n. Chocolatey's exit code is different than what it is seeing from the application install, so a 0 is what you would already get from chocolatey (0.9.8.21 we are ensuring that) when it exits with no errors.\n. I'm curious what you would use for the reboot needed flag. :)\n. Interesting. I think @mwrock is handling this idea as well with boxstarter. I'm curious how he knows it's time to reboot.\n. The BIG Hammer. Like it! \n. Assigning this to you Matt @mwrock ;)\n. @gep13 Didn't we get this in as part of another PR?\n. @rismoney is this still an issue?\n. This is left up to the package itself to install the proper one for your architecture. If the package creator doesn't include a link for a 64 bit version, it is assumed that the 32 bit is the one to install.\n\nWhat we are working on is a flag to allow someone to force a 32 bit version if they need it.\n. That's one way of doing it but long term it would not be the optimal\nsolution. We have a feature coming that will let you pass --x86 and it\nwould use that version no matter what you are on\n\n---\n\nRob\n\"Be passionate in all you do\"\n\nhttp://devlicio.us/blogs/rob_reynolds\nhttp://ferventcoder.com\nhttp://twitter.com/ferventcoder\n\nOn Wed, Oct 2, 2013 at 1:36 PM, BSara notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> So if we need to force install a 32 bit version on a 64 bit machine...we\n> need to request for a 32 bit package?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/197#issuecomment-25564700\n> .\n.

I see what might be wrong. Your nupkg/nuspec might be named incorrectly. the nuspec itself should be named tomboy.nuspec.\nThe name of the package file (3.504 tomboy.1.10.2.nupkg) should not have a number or a space on the front of it.\n. Okay, dumb question. What shell are you using?\n. Your github repo?\n. tried it out on a VM. Getting the appropriate issue about not being able to find gtksharp.\n\nSo it's working on my machine...\n. Still would like to know what is going on on your end though.\n. Installs good for me.\n. What happens when you run cinst tomboy -source %cd% **-debug** ??\n. Double Double Quotes. FTW. The switch from batch to powershell leaves something to be desired in keeping quotes. \n\nso this will work: `cinst tomboy -source \"\"%cd%\"\"`\n\nMy bad, Didn't ask what your path was.\n. Normally with command line applications on Windows you would only need the single quote. It would be interesting to know what you get if you use a single quote (') instead.\n. Nice! Yeah, there is something in the conversion from batch to powershell that destroys all double quotes by themselves. It could be something I'm doing. It is annoying...I should really look into it.\n. Closing as not a bug... you will follow up with the wiki article updates?\n. Ah, I mean source code repository for your packages. Look at my profile on chocolatey.org and you will see  https://github.com/ferventcoder/nugetpackages and https://github.com/ferventcoder/chocolateyautomaticpackages\n. Looks good. Only note is the second source to the package should not contain a file, just a directory\n. No, we didn't delete it. I thought you updated the CreatePackages page only, I never remember seeing a link to another page\n. Agreed. That's an enhancement on the list. And that you could also -force -includedependencies to force the whole chain\n. Not sure if we had it listed or not.\n. thanks\n. @MikeH2012 unfortunately that library requires POSH v3+ so it's no dice\n. I will take the ball on that.\n. Sent the message, just waiting to hear back.\n. Doesn't look like this is going to be a feature that will be freely available. :(\n. This will move to a professional version of chocolatey.\n. This is going to be implemented in the pro version since it is not a free thing.\n. Thanks\n. https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/145\n. cver chocolatey-alpha3 -lo would be incorrect. alpha and 3 are prerelease version information, not part of the packagename. \n\nThere may be some wonkiness related to getting packages that are prereleases, but we have a good way to get to packages that are named pkg1.2.3 (where 2.3 is the version) versus pkg.1.2.3 (where 1.2.3 is the version). I'm confused a little because we are already doing this correctly. Console2 comes to mind.\n. Back to your original issue, I'm a little confused about what you mean about cinst without a version parameter. That should work now.\n. Thinking of other features on the plate, how then will we get to cinst pkg1\npkg2 pkg3 pkgN ??\n\nOn Tuesday, December 4, 2012, Matt Wrock wrote:\n\n> Agreed. and source too.\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/206#issuecomment-10999358.\n\n## \n\n---\n\nRob\n\"Be passionate in all you do\"\n\nhttp://devlicio.us/blogs/rob_reynolds\nhttp://ferventcoder.com\nhttp://twitter.com/ferventcoder\n. https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/commit/6ca7ed1fe2d9f45fcfb3f84bbb2aa9811a544ff2\n\nCommand and PackageName are the only positionals.

Your fixed nuspec should have an updated version.\n2. The nupkg you produce locally should reflect that version (i.e. vagrant.0.8.1.nupkg).\n3.

Please Look in the directory and tell me what the name of the file is with the extension \"nupkg\". \n. What Rich said. The source should be a directory. :D\n. GUI apps have a helper. appname.exe.gui (empty file that matches in case sitting directly next to where the file is or will be).\n. SymLink/Shortcut/exe in choco/bin folder - we've talked about this in the past. The biggest problem here is that it is not a universal thing due to windows, otherwise we would symlink everything in.\n\nWhat may be better is to determine a convention where we can symlink the executable into bin.\n.

Perhaps you missed my comment somewhere that symlinking is not comprehensive enough to handle all the scenarios the .bat handles.\n. Found it - https://groups.google.com/forum/m/?fromgroups#!topic/chocolatey/hP5h0-g-rAM\n. I think this should be an opt in kind of thing - we'd have to know what needs to be copied in besides the actual exe (like dlls/configs/inis) etc. This is where things start to get messy. One exe has a dll it depends on, another has the same dll, but a different version that it depends on. \n. What's the difference between .bat and .cmd anyways? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/148968/windows-batch-files-bat-vs-cmd\n. Opt-in by the package maintainer is what I meant. A way of indicating this file should be linked or copied somehow. \n\nOne thing to note, if ffmpeg comes to my machine without requiring admin privileges, it shouldn't require an admin privilege for me to get to use the tool (aka mklink is out of the question then). \n. I know I'm throwing things at you that seem to come out of nowhere, but they are all reasons we went for bat files in the first place.\n. Interesting thing here - if your package requires a particular version of chocolatey, you can specify the version requirements in the nuspec\n. That way if you have a minimum required version for chocolatey, you just specify that in the nuspec. When they go to install your package, it will update chocolatey automatically.\n. Yeah, symlinks are pretty limited in windows. It's kind of sad really.\n. ``` xml\n<package>\n  <metadata>\n    <dependencies>\n      <dependency id=\"Chocolatey\" version=\"0.9.8.20\" />\n    </dependencies>\n  </metadata>\n</package>\n```\n\nThe version is based on the lowest compatible version - http://docs.nuget.org/docs/reference/versioning \n. RE: Unified approach -  \n\n\"Shouldn't everything be opt-in?\" - I disagree on this because it breaks the convention there now. The convention exists so that folks can do a minimal amount of work and rock out a chocolatey package. If they have a project they want to share with the world, they can just drop the exe in a package and boom. It works. :D\n\n`.exe.startMenu` - I like this idea\n`.exe.moveToBin` - or perhaps `exe.copy`\n`.exe.linkBat` - this is the default convention, so it's unnecessary to have\n`.exe.linkGui` - this is already here as `exe.gui`\n. The script is here: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/functions/Get-ChocolateyBins.ps1#L19\n. This is not something we are looking at doing currently. Does the ShimGen answer this need?\n. It also mentions where the ruby package installs if it has not been set.\n. As far as a default value, I agree - https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/190\n. And the addition of Install-ChocolateyTool (with some parameters) that does all of this magical work for you. :D\n\nJust added for tracking - https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/221\n. We do try to keep the documentation updated with the things that exist or are in the code base but have not yet been released.\n. @Redsandro Rich is talking about the '1.0.2' in rismoney-v1.0.2_setup.exe\n.

It's all good. With all pull requests, you want them to come from branches. Makes it easier to submit multiple pull requests and to continue to work on other changes without affecting your PRs (pull requests)\n. I think you'll find that when you are using a fork of an active repo, you want your master to be pristine (aka look like the master in the active repo). \n\nYou do all of your work in branches. Those become pull requests.\n\nWhen we evaluate a PR, we look at testing and how big the impact of the change is. The bigger the impact, the longer it takes to pull in. \n\nWhen we've decided to pull one in, we like the history line to be as straight up and down as possible. That means we rewind a branch we create for your PR to the last commit from master that your branch used and then pull it in. Then we rebase that commit against all of the stuff that has happened since then (what that means is that your commit goes to the very front of the commits, even if it was two months ago). After that is done we merge it to master and push it up. You are the author, one of us is the committer (because we are moving the commit).\n. We actively work with PR authors the best we can (since this is OSS and we all have full time work) to get PRs in a state of good to go, unless the PR is a completely different direction from where I believe chocolatey should go. \n\nWe don't reject PRs just because we are getting ready for a release. We just let them sit a little longer until the release is done before evaluating them and pulling them in or not. \n. Interesting. Why not make get-webfile work with these additions?\n. Interesting...we have made choco silent by default. This seems to go\nagainst that idea. Should this not be a pkg then?\n\nOn Friday, April 19, 2013, Drew Burlingame wrote:\n\n> I agree.

Yep, not an issue with chocolatey. Going to close this and let you pass that onto the package\n. Jeff, nice that you noticed this. Is there somewhere better that this issue can be placed (since it may not be a choco issue)?\n. Cool. Closing for now pending discovery of a chocolatey issue.\n. I think this can happen. :)\n. This is implemented rather when choco calls out to the package provider it puts this in the environment variables for that process.\n. %CHOCOLATEY_VERSION%\n.

Agreed though, this is a little different than clean\n. +1000. Yeah, this current area is a pain point for all of us. \n. cuninst would need an explicit item to be called on.\n\nThe failed installs will move to a directory so someone can go inspect why they failed later.\n. Be sure to look at #595 for perspective.\n. --force --force-dependencies (or -fx)\n. This is now linked up with https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1124 so please follow from there.. There are multiple methods of installation - https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/Installation . You are not likely going to be able to use the simplest method.  It seems to me though that if you cannot open a command prompt (not powershell) and run the one on the front page of chocolatey.org (with runs a powershell command with an explicit unrestricted setting), then chocolatey is probably not going to work out for you since that is exactly how it runs when it does. \n\nI don't know how difficult it is to sign a script or what kind of maintenance issues we would see by this (since every time we change a script it would require a re-signing I believe). This makes it seem like the case - http://www.mikepfeiffer.net/2010/02/obtaining-a-code-signing-certificate-and-signing-powershell-scripts/ (and some other sites I've read over). \n\nUnfortunately it's not likely at this time that we will want to approach the cost (of both maintenance and the real cost of a VeriSign cert) of signing and re-signing our scripts. You are welcome to do a self-signed certificate and if you come up with a good way to automate that we would welcome a patch that would create a self-signed certificate, install it on a user's machine and then sign all of the chocolatey files (and probably every package at runtime just after they download since they will also have powershell in them).\n. Yep, that's going to make chocolatey very hard to use in your environment. So your option is to sign all of them with a self signed cert. When a new version comes out you will need to do that as well. The really tricky part is that you need to add a module to chocolatey to sign scripts just before chocolatey runs them as it downloads packages.  \n\nYour other option is not to use chocolatey. Unfortunately.\n. Thanks Matt, I'll get this over to .org as well.\n. Currently improving this a bit.\n. Most likely rismoney's stuff get's into choco proper. \n. And yes, things get very busy for me with my full time job. It ebbs and flows a bit, but the nature of the beast can consume most of my free time. \n. It's never returned exit codes... as we found in a different discussion (#384). I believe it was related to nuget always returning the incorrect exit code from way back 2 years ago.\n. Let's file a new issue about this over at chocolatey/choco.\n\nOn Friday, October 16, 2015, Josh Buedel notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> This still happens in at least one situation.

Except work on mono\n. I have a longstanding request to put in mono support. I agree though - I use apt and brew when on those OSes as well. I'm not sure that I would use it, but it is an interesting use case. Plus it could potentially open the door to using choco as the mono pkg mgr. Potentially b/c I'm pretty sure most folks would rather just see a mono debian repo they could add to apt. It has a much richer set of features and hooks right into the app updater in ubuntu (for the folks that like gui tools). \n. The mono idea is a low priority due to that, but scriptcs support is more interesting for a few reasons. I don't necessarily see a need for scriptcs at the moment, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't explore it. This isn't about replacing powershell, just adding options.\n. And just b/c I do not understand something does not negate that there might be some really good use cases.\n. @rismoney I agree on all points here. Folks on the IRC channel would rather wait for a perfect solution than a good enough for now solution. :) \n\nI agree that rebuilding nuget is a daunting task. I don't expect it to be done in powershell. Another reason why the core of choco will be rewritten in c#.\n. This is in. Thanks! \n. what you mean is choco clean.\n. We do not remove the previous version at all when a new version comes in by design. You can install two versions of ruby.\n. You need to be explicit on installing ruby versions. \n\nBut what I think we are missing here is a bigger design. \n\nChoco clean removes all older versions of packages except for those you have pinned.\n\nSo if you have 3 versions of ruby and you pin the latest and the first one behind it, when you clean, the one that is not pinned goes away (from the chocolatey lib, but not uninstalled yet). \n\nThe uninstall itself should be smarter about asking someone what they want to remove when there are multiple versions. Like the way ruby gems does it when you have multiple installs of a gem.\n\n```\nchoco uninstall ruby\n\nDo you want to remove:\n\n 1. Ruby v1.8.6\n 2. Ruby v1.8.7\n 3. Ruby v1.9.2\n 4. All of the above\n```\n\nSo you wouldn't have a need for bump. What you could do is add clean to the end of the install command `cinst ruby -clean` so it cleans up the old.\n. And yes, right now when there are multiple active versions, PPAs break down a bit on keeping these separate if you try to treat them as the package. What we are looking to do here is create some meta packages that are dependent on a range of versions of a package so you can install them. What it doesn't handle very well right now is the upgrade scenario and why I haven't moved forward with it. It works right now just like it is, it's just not as easy for someone to see how they would get 1.8.7 and 1.9.2 of ruby and keep them updated independently. They have to use `choco update ruby -version 1.8.7.###` to go up and stay on 1.8.7. \n\nThese are special edge cases that don't always fit nicely into the versioning concept since they are maintained over time instead of deprecated for the newer versions. Nothing wrong with it, it just complicates things a bit, that's all.\n. This is also where the evolution of the chocolateyInstall.ps1 will come in handy (where we break some areas into known functions chocolatey can call).\n. I think that's where the clean command comes in. Choco has no way of\nknowing what us side by side and what is not. However a user pins packages\nthey want to keep and then later runs clean, it only cleans older pkgs that\nare not pinned. Punning also excludes a pkg fron upgrade during cup all.\n\nOn Wednesday, March 27, 2013, Rich Siegel wrote:\n\n> Maybe cup should delete all versions.

This is a non-starter as the c# version does not display the behavior of multiple versions installed. Or in other words, this is already fixed for choco.exe. ;)\n. If you watch the video here, I circle the ability to add the old behavior - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sm_U53sxt2c\n. I think we need to look at list or search -localonly - It's much much faster.\n\n`clist nodejs -lo -all`\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/commit/5052e19bda652f71626105c0cebb8459e92a3e31\n. So this is going to be `choco list pkgname -lo` and `choco list pkgname -lo -all`\n. I mean super fast :)\n. It will be a documentation change.

It is developed, but you have to have the latest source installed. Otherwise the -lo is going to be ignored. I just added it last night. :)\n. It points to the local chocolatey lib folder as a source and good old nuget to do the searching.\n. We can upgrade the list to return object - I'm not sure if it does now.\n. That's exactly the design. You should always bump the dependencies to the least usable version. Leaving out the version in the dependency is a shortcut that when taken produces exactly the results you are seeing.\n\n**Reasoning:** What if say the newest version of a dependency was no longer compatible with your package that depended on it? If we implemented the above, it would not be the desired behavior.\n. Folks are welcome to cup a dependency installed package as well.\n. And there is cup all, which would bump everything to the latest version. However, it may bump something you don't want upgraded (until we get the pinning feature implemented).\n. I don't believe this is the answer you were looking for, perhaps we can add the switch to force it. Just not make it the default. Which is likely exactly what you were looking for.\n. I think we can do this, but it may not make it in until after v1.\n. Thanks for finding this.\n. We're looking at May/June.\n. True that...\n. This is done - it's called `--noop`, but you can also use `-whatif` to invoke the same behavior. It's a core switch. https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/CommandsReference#default-options-and-switches\n. This actually goes to this repo - https://github.com/chocolatey/puppet-chocolatey\n. Of course, it also requires @rismoney to actually check in the files from his repo and then add the module out on puppet forge.\n. Updated the URL folks.

I'm guessing that nuget is failing silently?\n. @gep13 You want this one?\n. Nothing works in choco.exe without .NET 4.0. So there will be a very visible error.\n.

If you have a package installed already, the dependency is resolved. Therefore you wouldn't need to include it in your current directory (source). Otherwise you need to put it there. In the case of chocolatey itself, it was treated differently for the first install and not also put in the %choco install%\\lib directory. We are going to fix that so that things can take dependencies on newer versions of chocolatey better.\n. You can take a dependency on a minimum version of chocolatey like you are doing and it should be fine. You just need to make sure when you are testing out dependencies in a local source, if you don't want to add the dependency packages to the source, specify the source they are in as well. As in -source \"\"%cd%;http://chocolatey.org/api/v2/\"\" (note the double double quotes here).\n\nDoes this make sense?\n.

I understand what is being asked here. It's not a trivial thing to list out dependents with accuracy as the graph can change without a package's knowledge and does not span across multiple sources. \n\nI'm assuming this could really only be based on a source, where it would build a tree of current dependents (or some stale value, perhaps every 6 hours or so, that is acceptable so that it doesn't kill the server).\n\nDo you have a good example of a pkg manager that is doing this now?\n. Perfect. Thanks for the example. :)\n. IMHO managing dependencies is fundamental for a pkg mgr - getting info about what depends on a pkg is very handy, but I'd hardly argue fundamental. \r\n\r\nHowever I'd like to understand a use case that makes this fundamental.. Agreed it would be great to see who depends on a package, graphed locally and on a package source.. I think we can accomodate this... the priorities might fall this to take some time. I see you've done this on your master branch. If you plan to make any more changes and do pull requests you would be limited. \n\nMy suggestion is that you close this, move the changes to a branch, and then issue the pull request. That would allow you to make any additional pull requests or update your branch without influencing this request.\n\nKeep in mind the current wait time for acceptance of pull requests in chocolatey is on the order of a couple of months if not longer. Some things we get in very quickly, some things we do not, depending on where it falls for prioritization.\n. I'm less concerned about the rebase... what I don't want you to do though is do a pull and merge, that messes with source. Then I have to cherry pick your commits out to keep a good linear history.\n. I have the methods I expect committers to use in an email somewhere - it might be a good idea to put it into a readme markdown in the source.. it's very close to what you are saying here Rich.\n. Basically what should happen for the requestee:  \n1. git checkout -b support_msu\n2. reissue pull request.\n3. reset your master to remove these changes. git extensions gui is a helpful one for doing that.\n. This isn't so bad... :)\n. Please don't update pull requests. There is only one recommended way of\ndoing this to keep the history line straight and it requires quite a few\nsteps on your part (including force push to your remote branch). It's\nactually easier for me to accept a PR if it hasn't  been updated (I may\nneed to cherry pick otherwise). I would rather the work be on my side of\nthe house because i'm the holdup here. :)\n\nWe'll publish what we are looking for in the contributor's guide for\nkeeping a pull request up to date.\n\nI mentioned this as I saw you update more than one.\n\nOn Saturday, April 27, 2013, Justin Dearing wrote:\n\n> Updated to current master\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/274#issuecomment-17116137\n> .\n\n## \n\n---\n\nRob\n\"Be passionate in all you do\"\n\nhttp://devlicio.us/blogs/rob_reynolds\nhttp://ferventcoder.com\nhttp://twitter.com/ferventcoder\n.

Superseded by #628 \n. Is this a chocolatey issue or a package issue?\n. Think I figured out the issue... \n%chocolatey_bin_root% is set to c:\\chocolatey\\bin, right?\n. Try installing it again. I updated the package to not change the system drive if you have already specified it.\n. So in the case of the triumvirate, you can never go wrong with just the default (7zip). It will almost always install the .install/.app version of the application. No further thought necessary. The zipped version is there purely for the folks who won't have admin permissions to their machines or who don't mind going through a little extra work to keep things out of add/remove programs. \n\nWe are working to make the docs better and it will come with time. HTH\n. It's not really a specialization. Virtual packages are not baked at all at the moment. All there is are metapackages that point to the .install or the .commandline version of the packages. They exist for discoverability as well.\n. Agreed on most points. Some of this is definitely a polish aspect that we won't see until version 2 of chocolatey. Some of it is an infrastructure design for how we better handle package breakdowns, i.e. to your point of the one package, how do you handle french, japanese, and chinese versions of a package? What is the actual versions are out of sync? Should that hold up the package? Or should we somehow hide the other packages and we have the virtual make the best decision? That's kind of what I'm leaning towards.\n\nLots of design considerations here. :)\n.

That's why we usually let the native installers that already know how to upgrade do their thing. In most times they handle the upgrade well, however there are cases where you mentioned artifacts are left behind.  In the principal of least surprise, I would find it more surprising if files / configuration were missing versus some extra files/folders around.\n\nThoughts?\n. > 1) Introduce the \"chocolateyUpdate.ps1\" script mentioned in the title, which should be placed in the newer package (the newer version knows about older versions, but not the other way around). Chocolatey should call that script if it exists (and skip chocolateyUninstall.ps1 from the existing, older package), otherwise fall back to uninstall old + install new.\n\nAnd this `chocolateyUpdate.ps1` could call the older package's uninstall should the maintainer know the ramifications of this.\n. Will be thinking of improvements we can make as we move forward on the new version.\n. Migrated to https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/268\n. Install-PowershellModulePath (or something like that). \n- This copies something to a path specified.\n- If the path is not already created in the environment variable, it will add it.\n- Be able to specify user/machine (unless this is only one or the other).\n\nSo looks like three parameters to be passed.\n. @jaykul may also be interested in this discussion and being more of an SME on this, he probably has suggestions on how to implement.\n. I know @jaykul had something he was working on for this kind of thing. \n.

Hmmm....that sounds bad. I haven't run it through any profilers but we can take a look.\n. So this is due to needing the COM shell for unzipping files. That doesn't exist on core. We are looking into using something non-native but for now you will need to follow one of the other installation methods on the wiki.\n. Cheers \n.

Gildas, would you be up for a hangout to discuss some of these things? \n. Interesting dilemma. Seems we need to be able to pass something to the downloaded string as we invoke it.\n. call this instead of the normal install - https://chocolatey.org/installabsolutelatest.ps1\n. Yes, we already published a notice on this: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/chocolatey/PSA$3A$20Possible$20Action$20Required!$20Schema$20Version$20Errors$20if$20you$20have$20upgraded$20to$20Nuget$202.5/chocolatey/HGIqDlOSXTQ/lPPOpmvuP84J\n. Closing since this is already fixed in the next version and we have a workaround. \n. For posterity, and so you don't have to read through my thread to find the nuget bug - https://nuget.codeplex.com/discussions/445455\n. Well, 15 months or a few days... still doesn't make it right https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/commit/c9f9e8dc95ccd337059cd84bbd571b026a7eb7dd\n. so this requires comma between package names. I am trying to figure out removing everything from implicitly being positional but running into a few issues I will need to explore later.\n. Yep. Notice I said temporarily need a comma.\n\nOn Thursday, June 27, 2013, Redsandro wrote:\n\n> Wow, it's handy to know powershell. :P\n> \n> Details are very important.

So I either have to change the names, which I'm not going to do, or drop powershell in favor of c# calling powershell packages (which is in the plans anyway).\n. I have it working now, but I had to remove the two naming conflicts... and those need to stay in.\n\nFor reference: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6870362/can-i-create-a-script-with-parameter-that-has-aliasdb-in-powershell\n\nand http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10536282/powershell-defining-the-verbose-switch-in-a-function\n. And you ask the twitters and the twitters provide... :) \n\nFixed in https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/commit/6ca7ed1fe2d9f45fcfb3f84bbb2aa9811a544ff2\n. I didn't remove, I just moved them down... :) \n\nSo those things are still there.\n. cup chocolatey -pre and you have it... :)\n. That and I've been mulling over this guy for awhile in how I would see it implemented. :)\n. Also your sarcasm went a long way into me getting off of my duff and getting 'er done. :+1: \n\nWith my new job you should see a much faster response time...\n. Beauty of a prerelease. Those can go out all day and night so folks can play with them. And if they don't work, well it was a prerelase... ;)\n. yep... know what you are talking about @rismoney - will Mark Johnson's stuff not work for you? The offline installer piece?\n. It would go in the helpers\\functions dir - anything outside of that is considered not available to pkgs. If they use anything outside of that, it's not guaranteed to be there...\n. FYI - the packages doing this is fine, but it will eventually be part of Install-ChocolateyPortablePackage (vaporware at the moment) so it just happens behind the scenes.\n. Also, when I had this in my head, I'd always called it tools root so as not to confuse with the bin folder. not a big deal, just trying to figure out the naming :)\n. It's a convention. Just trying to figure out if it's the right convention or if it needs to be changed. Heck, we just changed the convention on .app / .tool to .install / .portable to convey the obvious. :)\n. It comes on the google group - https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/chocolatey/dxnOBFly3vU\n. Not sure... That's interesting. What is upstream for you?\n. I tend to use rebase to keep my commits at the top before I push them back to the remote repo.\n\nBut what you are doing should work... should. ;)\n. Closing as #359 has been accepted.\n. This sounds pretty solid. It might be a version or two before we get to this though.\n. Like I suggested, what we need first is a way to pass a universal switch to chocolatey for directory to install has to happen first and then packages will need to buy into that some.\n. Seems like you could have an internal fork of chocolatey where you make that change right in the first lines of chocolatey.ps1 :)\n. At least as stop gap. It would be really easy to make the change here but I'm reluctant as the really easy changes is what has kept around the POSH version for two years past it's usefulness.\n. This partially closes #647.\n. Bad Example - papercut IS now maintained by the author - http://papercut.codeplex.com/discussions/251360\n. But I get what you are saying - you need to reach out to the pkg maintainers on chocolatey.org through the contact owners link. If you don't hear back from them within a week followup with an abuse report. If you don't hear back, follow up with an email to the chocolatey google group. This triage process is published on the google group, but probably needs to be published on the wiki as well.\n. https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/PackageTriageProcess\n. Are we good to close this guy?\n. Also updated http://devlicio.us/blogs/rob_reynolds/archive/2013/01/03/chocolatey-automatic-packages.aspx\n. In older versions of nuget.exe, it would bubble up false errors back to chocolatey (like when you asked it to install something you already had installed and it noop-ed). \n\nIf that is out of the current, then I'm fine with us looking at @rismoney's issue #210 - which this could be considered a duplicate of. We'll reference this in 210 and close this issue. Thanks! \n. Sometimes it's `cinst [package] -pre` (just like the website states). If you are upgrading perhaps we should add this as well to the commands you can call.\n. This enhancement goes on https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org\n. That right there should go to it's own issue. Thanks! \n. Thank you. This is likely the same thing that Katherine has been talking about. It's a strange issue that seems to go away if you use -debug (so it's extremely hard to detect WHAT is causing it).\n.

Boo, we'll switch to write-output all at the same time... right now it's write-host and we have a function that is overriding the default write-host, so we'd like to see that stay for now.\n. You would need to know natively what the install arguments are that you would pass to each installer to do this. It is not a trivial task for us to handle this with chocolatey and a universal switch as each installer could do it differently, but it is on our list: #32 \n. Well that's kind of what we are planning on doing. A universal switch for users to pass and on the back end each different type of installer would get passed the proper args.\n.

This is fixed in 2db80fa929491c7b38ef6ca329782f8f11b11b3c\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. I ended up adding this functionality here 2db80fa929491c7b38ef6ca329782f8f11b11b3c\n. `imagemagick-6.8.6-1` would be what you were actually suggesting (I hope). If you read that, ubuntu packages are built on top of debian, so you already have the debian package version on there with `-1` right before `ubuntu6` (where six is the ubuntu package version). \n\nI think ultimately we can find something more flexible. Along these lines I could see something like `sometool.1.2.3-prereleaseinfo(1)` or something like that. I am not a fan of that yet, just thinking out loud.\n. > What if the software itself already uses four dot-separated segments for its version and you need to fix the package? If you have for example a software version 2.5.8.1, you are forced to alter the last segment, so the original software version information gets destroyed: 2.5.8.20140327. Then, for all the following packages of version 2.5.8.x, you are forced to use the current date as last segment, even if the affected package does not actually fix a previous package revision. You would have to wait until the packaged software gets released with version 2.5.9.x to be able to drop the date in the last segment and use the real software version again. So here an essential information is removed just because of a senseless restriction.\n\nActually you can get creative here. It's not suggested to do this in the fourth segment if it is used. Look at the ruby package. `1.9.3.392` becomes `1.9.3.39200` and the next release is `1.9.3.39201`. It's not perfect and yes we should look at enhancing stuff like that. Where do you see this in terms of priority? \n. Fixed in 8d10898b682e03cefa02123b404397a34580f778\n. @Gab-km I think for me, the username is a requirement. While we hope people also have a password that is not empty, can you think of any cases where someone might have it set empty? I can't off the top of my head so having it required would also be helpful\n. The interesting thing here is easy_install is supported already with\n-source python.\n\nNot sure if you realized that.

There is nothing that keeps chocolatey from inspecting an already built package and attempting to do many of these things before it allows a package to be available to consumers.\n. Nothing but rolling up some sleeves and getting to work that is.\n. It's actually a both kind of thing. There would be a certain set of\nelements that would be run locally. Then a much bigger set that would\noverlap the local set (in case of client funny business) and run on the\nserver.\n\nAnother way to think about it is unit tests versus integration tests.\nLocally we run some smoke checks and some validation of common issues.\n\nOn the server we let the package through but hold it until it passes more\nextensive validation rules.\n\nThe whole idea is a business rules engine that is based on a validation\nlibrary I've written in the past.

It is possible to do so with myget (copy them anyway)\n. There is an easier fix, which is package moderation. Reject anything that doesn't meet the guidelines.

Old one that is fixed. This may have been fixed already...\n. It's unfortunately the way powershell works. You can force powershell to acknowledge quotes with `\"\n. This could also be considered a bug as well.\n. I'm not sure if this is still an issue on new choco or not.\n. I think while the two things being discussed are related, they are slightly different. The related part is surrounding OS and dependencies. The part that is different is that one decides whether the package should be installed or not and the other decides what specifically would be installed per OS.\n\nAm I catching the differences appropriately?\n. The check that @mwrock does for the existence of the framework should be done in a separate package named solely for .net framework 3.5. I think we can agree on that. \n\nWe can either go - \"Packages - its packages all the way down.\" or build in dependency types that are not necessarily package related. \n.

My wording in the first comment didn't make a whole lot of sense. I think you answered correctly though.\n. @mlt I'm thinking you may have Emacs looking for `SumatraPDF` before `SumatraPDF.exe`, which could cause the need for double quotation. A simple where/which query `where sumatrapdf` could prove this out followed by `SumatraPDF.exe \"one set.pdf\"`. Can you provide those things?\n. @mlt I see it stripping off quotes. Let me see what I can do.\n. Right, but we need it to work in almost all cases. How will we be able to detect that it works without actually running the application in some controlled state and seeing if it errors due to an unfound library? That's why we're moving to a shim. Still provides really good functionality over batches with minimal issue.\n. @mlt we still support windows 2003 (and so does MS until 7/14/2015).\n. @georgehemmings This is done based on the call in the Win32 API, meaning Windows strips them out (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9287812/backslash-and-quote-in-command-line-arguments & http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/archive/2006/09/13/Command-Line-Confusion.aspx) - What I'll need to do is likely detect spaces and strap on quotes when found. Or just add quotes every time around arguments.\n. @mlt thanks for pointing out the console window appears. I think I have fixed that (but not yet released).\n. @mlt I have the spaces issue fixed.

Apologies, I did ask what would happen in the call from cmd.exe trying to\nisolate whether this is a powershell issue with the batch redirects or not.\n\nPowershell tends to strip off double quotes from calls, I've got about 10+\nhours testing this recently.

What was the issue?\n. In case there is something to follow up on and fix. :)\n. Sad...that's sad to look at. This happens because you are using the alias which is passing install or update to choco.\n\nSo what this means is we should either remove all aliases or search for those strings and do replacement. I'm in favor of deprecation of shortcuts.\n. Note that this is the transition phase... it has already begun. :)\n. `choco` is the ubiquitous term. It beat the rest of the possibilities...\n. The first is not a replace all, it's just a one line change. https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org/blob/master/chocolatey/Website/Views/Packages/DisplayPackage.cshtml#L98\n\nThe second is a change to an image. \n. This is a duplicate of #295. However that one has bad naming as compared to this one, so I will close it as a dupe of this.\n. This is really a duplicate of #6 (just FYI).\n. Installs are silent and scriptable, that doesn't mean other actions should also be (by default). That might be where you pass a switch to make it so.\n\nNote that the uninstall in choco at the moment is very naive, it doesn't do much without help.\n\nAnd to touch on @TomOne 's suggestion - I have been giving that alot of thought and I think we will move that way. Choco is 100% semver compliant (AKA no real rules for less than v1), so wild changes are still okay while we are working out how it should be for the release.\n. I'm not a fan of that as much as you are not (the nuget cache)....\n. @TomOne I agree. One needs to have a hash in the package so you know that the local is the same as the MD5 hash so you wouldn't have to download it again. Perhaps search and open an issue on this?\n. `choco uninstall pkgname --all-versions`\n. That's funny, someone else requested the autofocus... perhaps we add a key (it breaks vimium for me until I tab out of it).\n. A key like Alt+S to focus on the search box.\n. It supports package parameters but very naively. It doesn't send a param in\nthe way you would. It doesn't do an inspection of the\nchocolateyInstall.ps1, look and try to map the parameters to the file as it\ncomes into the script.\n\nWhat you pass to the package should be -params 'key=value;key2=value2'\n. Updated the documentation you referenced to reflect that $env:chocolateyPackageParameters will be a value that will contain these items \n. Right, as you parse the string out, you would convert the key value for the bool to a switch.\n. Was waiting for sysnative to come out.... \n. This looks good. I think we can pull it in just so. Thoughts @mwrock ??\n. New  at #393\n. Awesome! Thank you for doing that. This looks pretty clean and easy to pull\nin.\n\nOn Thursday, December 19, 2013, Julian Easterling wrote:\n\n> Recently while creating a chocolatey package, I ran into an issue where\n> trying to install a windows feature would fail on my 64-bit windows\n> operating system with a message saying that I could not use the 32-bit\n> version of DISM to manage features.

Prefer more control over what gets installed and more importantly, what doesn't get installed.\n. I'm not sure anyone does....\n. Yes, check out #6 I believe.

It's #6\n. Note my comment about it being naive (aka not fully implemented)\n. This should be fixed as part of 0.9.8.24\n. Thanks. I think we can pull this in.\n. So this is a fluke... I noticed that we had a couple of folks report this on the mailing list as well.\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/d/msgid/chocolatey/c7f05386-d37b-4e87-89b8-24956857ccb3%40googlegroups.com\n. I'm not sure that your error has the same causation as those from a couple of years ago. The 7za.exe and choco come from https://chocolatey.org now.\n. @jnm2 Can you log this recent issue to choco instead of this repository?\n. What version of chocolatey are you using? \n. What does the following produce?\n`choco sources` \n\nAre you behind a proxy/firewall?\n. @evanw21 many times the problem is getting the install.ps1 downloaded in the first place... then everything after that as well.\n. @youRFate ~~I think your issue is related, but not exactly the same as the original discussion.~~ (Update, I reread and this is the same). Please follow this issue so you know when it is corrected - https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/243\n\nThanks! \n. Closing this issue as it has moved to choco\n. I would subscribe to that issue so that you receive notifications on it. Thanks!\n. :)\n. Undocumented means unsupported ;) \n. AKA dark features. Actually I think this is probably undocumented b/c it's something we may have missed documenting... :(\n. @AnthonyMastrean Did I miss the PR? \n. I'm going to bump this to the next version while waiting for updates.\n. Migrated to https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/676\n. Binaries like DLLs? \n. And when you say a solution for chocolatey to put things on the `%PATH%` you mean something like this - https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/HelpersInstallChocolateyPath ? Or something different?\n. I am a little confused. `PSFTP.exe` _is_ added to as a batch redirect. I think you might be looking at an older package version?\n. Ah! Understood completely. But you see `PSFTP.exe` is the shim that is added to `c:\\chocolatey\\bin` for me. ;)\n\nHave a look at this feature - https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/372\n. Batch redirects are a POS solution that don't work that well with other shells like cygwin/bash.\n. I was letting another of our group handle the beta release for the new version. Let's find out where @gep13 is on that... \n. Which was the harsh reply? ;)  IOW, no worries. \n. No worries. \n. Might give me a little more time to get the install replacing all of the batch redirects part done so I can close out #372.\n. This is in reference to a recent conversation we had on the mailing list.\nThis is to help folks not have to parse output to find the version.\n\nOn Sunday, January 26, 2014, Gary Ewan Park notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> Hello,\n> \n> By executing the following:\n> \n> choco\n> \n> You will get an output similar to the following:\n> \n> Please run chocolatey /? or chocolatey help - chocolatey v0.9.8.23\n> \n> From which you can get the current installed version of Chocolatey.\n> \n> Hope that helps!\n> \n> Gary\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/409#issuecomment-33317958\n> .\n\n## \n\nRob\n\"Be passionate in all you do\"\n\nhttp://devlicio.us/blogs/rob_reynolds\nhttp://ferventcoder.com\nhttp://twitter.com/ferventcoder\n.

No, I don't believe you are. The feature is quite naive. \n. Closing this as dupe of #134 as the feature isn't considered done.\n. Closed as code is merged in\n.

That did just point out a possible bug in new choco install logic. **NOTE**: It believes chocolatey 0.9.8.23 is installed. :/\n. Pinned, means you \"pin\" to a particular version. It's a way to suppress upgrades...\n. Attempting to upgrade shows the proper version:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/63502/5993780/eb32d902-aa20-11e4-884b-edf0e213b637.png)\n\nIt's there in the package directory:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/63502/5993782/04f657ec-aa21-11e4-94f8-122982545521.png)\n\nBut list, not so much. Shows last release version of everything. Anyone want to guess what I forgot to pass? Yes, `-pre`. Listing what you have installed should include and prefer a prerelease. Otherwise it can get confusing about what version you actually have installed. So it's a bug.\n. https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/46 (and fixed)\n. FYI, the `-r` option is meant for machines to read, not humans. But at least it's a start for taking something over and piping it to a posh script.\n. I think this is perfect. This is what NuGet should have done and one thing that made me want to start looking else where.  Is .NET 4.0 still supported in NuGet 2.8?\n. @nabheet yes in the nuspec.\n. @AnthonyMastrean NuGet indeed did introduce Dependency Resolution strategy, but they didn't expose it as all in NuGet.exe. Sad but no matter as choco.exe does it just fine. https://github.com/chocolatey/choco\n. I have to agree on logout.

Thanks for the contributions folks! Much appreciated. :)\n\nSorry I've been (*ahem*) slow with the PRs lately.\n. Now that is interesting. The behavior is that it is **supposed** to move on to the next source but from what I see here that is not the case when the first source errors.\n. Sweet! We need to explore the latest version. Probably in 0.9.8.25 though (or 0.99 if we call it that).\n. This particular issue is at https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/612 (and not necessarily related to what this was originally, because we have an even newer version of NuGet than was suggested earlier in this post).\n\n@metalseargolid can you perhaps move your comment over to that thread? Thanks! \n. Yes, this is by design. You are telling chocolatey to only use this one\nsource to resolve all packages. When choco runs normally it uses all known\nsources to resolve packages and dependencies, in source order.\n\nYou can specify multiple sources by separating with a semicolon and\nencapsulating with single quote marks, e.g. 'C:\\somesource;\nhttps://chocolatey.org/api/v2/'.\nThis is noted in the wiki documentation as well, although the format\ndoesn't always make it easy to find.\n\nYou might try using the mailing list for things like this.

Well that seems like a bug... Looks like you added that to #421?\n. This is fixed with merging of #421\n. Use `choco pack` instead if you find collisions. `choco command` is becoming the ubiquitous usage of chocolatey.\n. @bbenoist Great arguments. We're deprecating most of them. It's quite possible that most if not all will be removed by v1. `cinst` may stick around for a v2 removal since it is the most widely used and would impact a much larger set of folks.\n. Yes... :)\n. @paulsapps - You should delete `c:\\programdata\\chocolatey\\bin\\cpack.exe` as a workaround for now. Or you can try to update the path so that cmake's cpack evaluates first on the path.\n. Issue moved to https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/89\n. Ah, good point. Grammar. :)\n. We went with the fix of not allowing c:\\ for now.\n. See cd11749affd02b9445437517b46d49ad25ce7eb5\n.

We've fixed this on chocolatey.org. This is what happens when I go down to spend time with the family and am in a low speed internet area... :(\n. Thanks so much for reporting.

Was the item you are fixing in stable?\n. Okay, that's fine. We will just pull this into master.\n. You want to send me this against stable branch instead and I will get it into the next version?\n.

I'm closing this as not able to reproduce until we hear back.\n. This is something I want as well, thanks for filing the ticket. We are a ways from having a REPL but eventually I think we want to get there. There are a few more important things we want to cover first (like rewriting chocolatey into something that would support a REPL) and package indexes that would be able to help with getting the list with tab completion.\n. The issue with creating packages is a validation of fields in the nuspec\nthat need to be in http format.

Thanks! This will be released in 0.9.8.25 (unless we rename it to 0.9.9.0).\n. @thigg - what is the issue you opened? \n. Right, the ruby.devkit doesn't work with ruby 2. You can still install 1.9.3 and 1.8.7 - 1.9.3 is still in active use, 1.8.7 not so much.\n. Oh yeah, that was an issue with 0.9.8.23 and trying to reference something with 7z that doesn't exist #371. It does make sense to remove cinstm and to add ruby there\n. Done... please let me know if you need me to look at anything else. Closing this for now.\n. There, updated. Knowing that you can natively do this now by taking a dependency on something that can do .tar.gz and then doing so in the package like I have shared on Stackoverflow, this is most definitely a feature request and not an issue, since it does work today.\n. I think the current implementation of the helper can be given an optional -type parameter or in the absence of that, looks at the url of the remote file/name of local file to realize the extension and do the right thing. This is part of the ideas behind chocolatey. Do the right thing without a ton of different helpers that are essentially doing the same thing. \n\nThe difference here is knowing what to do with a tar versus a tar.gz versus a zip versus a 7z. I don't want four helpers, that's wasteful and adds mental context for users.\n. Archive?\n. This is being implemented in https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/386. It's still going to ask for uac permissions - we already use this. Look at Start-processasadmin\n. Agreed all over.\n. You are however using chocolatey in an unsupported scenario. When we prep for a powershell module we will need to do this\n. I believe this is fixed as of 0.9.10.3, further in 0.10.0, and has one outstanding issue to be fixed.\n\n### 0.9.10.x\n- Refresh environment between packages, ensure process variables stay set - https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/439\n- In PowerShell, do not update PSModulePath - https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/295\n- Ensure SYSTEM Temp folder - https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/826\n\n### 0.10.0\n- Capturing additional PSModulePath process items and making them available for the Internal PowerShell Host - https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/830\n\n### Further fixes for Update-SessionEnvironment\n- Ensure refresh while running in PowerShell doesn't wipe out variables - https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/129\n. The last one may not be required.\n. Fixes #455 \n. I had to rebase onto stable...\n\nMerged in at https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/commit/e2927d6cae116d9966166bbb6c7bc3aac3cc087b\n. Thanks so much for providing tests as well. Aside from your branch basing off of _env.cmd stuff, this was well done.\n. Well something went wrong on this end, could be that I had to change those commits some on the way in and your changes did not so it looked like different commits.\n. Yes, it did. I think that was due to the different commit hashes\n. @gep13 This looks good to me\n. No need on this one.\n. Always fun to see these errors. It's not there in 0.9.8.24, but another issue is right now.\n. You might see this in 0.9.8.24 final, the reason is that the chocolatey.cmd file is upgraded in place (including all of the other files). The PowerShell files are loaded into memory so they cause no issues with things missing, but it falls back to the new chocolatey.cmd coming out of the posh bits and encounters a variable that was set in the beginning of the new chocolatey.cmd and called there and at that point it doesn't know what it is since it was never set in the original call.\n\nAnd a long explanation to what that craziness is.\n. There is nothing to fix from here at this time.\n. You killed the process. :)\n\nWe have a somewhat naive interpretation that things are installed at the moment. That needs to be in a pending status until everything is successful or failed.\n\nThanks for noting this.\n. Terminology: Nuget marks a package as installed once the folder is there and it is unpacked. \n\nSince choco relies on nuget to determine installation, not the steps following the package install to install the software, that's where the issue lies.\n. Thank you sir\n. Yes, the cruft in chocolateysetup has been reduced but definitely requires more work. It's nice to see that you are putting in some work in that respect. It's very much appreciated but it does show that we need some mocking or abstraction in some cases here as these tests would actually alter the state of the system/user environment variables. The last time there was something like that in chocolatey it killed out my entire path (that I later rebuilt from a backup). I didn't introduce the tests that did that, but they were fixed in a way where mocking was made easier.\n\nThis is a good start. I have started conversations in some areas where I'm trying to understand what is going on or where I have specific concerns, especially with the use of test code in the production code. I think even though we explicitly import the helpers during installation, some of that code stands to be changed as well due to another error. I think we can find a smarter way to go about this, perhaps put the mocked code where the real code would have been for tests.\n. That was fun, for future reference `git rebase --onto stable master` while in the feature branch.\n. This is in locally by the way. I haven't pushed it up yet as I'm verifying it all the way back to win2003\n. Okay, let me back up the commits and set that up.\n. Merged into stable at https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/commit/02eccc940ca6341a094a408244206b13c87eacc1\n. This is implemented by #488 \n. Keep in mind that some of this is on borrowed time as c# choco will ultimately replace this area.\n. Left some comments at https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/commit/9a0af45c12973a6fafe6b28dbc90a6df7db7441c \nI think there are some design decisions here that are a little outside of chocolatey that would need to be fixed up.\n. Also, you can just use `(GH-489)` at the start of your commits. That is the way most of the commits are done to reference issues.\n. @030 If you submit a PR we can work through changes there. It's much easier to do.\n. Can you do that from the command line with ruby? Or is it just in gemfiles\nand gemspecs?\n\nOn Thu, Jun 19, 2014 at 2:45 PM, Christian H\u00f6ltje notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> It would be nice to be able to add version constraints instead of a\n> specific version.\n> \n> An example borrowing from Ruby's ~> (aka squid rocket) notation:\n> \n> chocolatey install windb -version '~> 8.59.20140318'\n> \n> This would install \"8.59.20140318\" or newer-third-place. e.g.\n> 8.59.20200101 but not 8.60 or 9.0\n> \n> Ciao!\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/490.\n\n## \n\nRob\n\"Be passionate in all you do\"\n\nhttp://devlicio.us/blogs/rob_reynolds\nhttp://ferventcoder.com\nhttp://twitter.com/ferventcoder\n. I'm saying this because you can do version constraints with chocolatey already (not on the command line though).\n\nhttp://docs.nuget.org/docs/reference/versioning#Specifying_Version_Ranges_in_.nuspec_Files\n\nThat same range works in package.config files as well.\n. Closing this as already an existing feature (based on the earlier note on version constraints in package files) unless you can show me how to do this on command line at runtime and not in a gemfile. \n. You don't have to worry about them. \n\nWhat happens is this:\n1. you call `chocolatey update chocolatey`\n2. chocolatey batch redirect calls chocolatey.cmd.\n3. chocolatey.cmd calls powershell and chocolatey.ps1, which is loaded into memory.\n4. the upgrade process does an in place upgrade/replacement of all the files in the executing directory.\n5. powershell files are upgraded, but powershell is executing from memory so it continues using the old \"files\".\n6. When powershell finishes, it hands it back over to chocolatey.cmd, but it's the newly placed chocolatey.cmd file that contains a new variable that the old one didn't.\n7. The variable is declared way before the step in the execution process we are on, so it evaluates to `''` instead of whatever value it should hold.\n8. So when it executes something later related to this variable, it doesn't know what it is, and the rest of the path looks wrong that it is using. %DIR% is the variable btw.\n9. RefreshEnv is still found since it is local to the script and so it is run.\n\nSo nothing to worry about. I had a special environment set up recently where I discovered all of this fun. I was fixing https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/459\n.

This is not a chocolatey issue. I suggest you use the contact maintainers form and or follow through the maintainers to find their chocolatey repository and file the issue there. \n\nTo help - https://github.com/ferventcoder/chocolateyautomaticpackages.\n. :+1: \n. Looks to be the same version?\n. Closing for now... unless this is an issue with chocolatey.\n. You may want to use the mailing list for questions like this - https://groups.google.com/group/chocolatey\n. and why not use invoke expression?\n. oh wait, nevermind... you are talking about against a remote computer. \n. So let me throw this out there, you have a bunch of computers all in some zone that could potentially reach a common known UNC share somewhere where you could ALREADY have unpacked chocolatey.\nAll that's left is for them to run the rest of the script, which is internal to you anyway.\n. Likely. I should have mentioned this is somewhat a duplicate as well. See https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/136 (similar but not exact).\n. By the way:\n\n> That said, while we have already slightly customized the installer already to 1) ensure we get a system-scoped ChocolateyInstall env variable for all users 2) set a specific installation directory and 3) set a specific URL to serve the installation files\n1. 0.9.8.24 will do this if you are running a process with elevated privileges\n2. You can already do this now if you set the environment variable prior to install - see https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/Installation#before-you-install\n3. choco sources add _name_ _location_\n. This looks to be a package issue...\n. If the package is doing something more than it should be and/or not using the helpers, I fully expect those packages to break. And they should b/c they need to stay out of chocolatey's purview. Anything that reaches into chocolatey's internals and uses functions, whatever, that are not in the API will start to break hard once choco.exe comes out.\n. I don't see anything too out of the ordinary going on here though.\n. So it does look like we have an issue\n\n```\n[ERROR] Chocolatey expected a file at \n'C:\\Users\\vagrant\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\chocolatey\\Firefox\\availableLocales.html' to \nbe of length '' but the length was '107268'.\n```\n. Probably need a more rigid check in there if the content-type is html and a content-length is not found, don't attempt to error.\n. I pushed chocolatey 0.9.8.25-alpha1 - this fixes the issue on my end. Can you verify it also works for you?\n\n```\nchoco install chocolatey -pre\n```\n. Don't expect a long lead time here. Once we get your other issue figured out, the release cycle should be within a few days - #505 \n\nThe faster we get to the bottom of that and get a correction, the faster we release.\n. Release cycles generally go really fast when a new release causes gating issues, like this issue. And like the other issue you have reported.\n\nIssues found that have  workarounds usually tend to be longer release cycles.\n. @TomOne Let's not twist my words around here. I said **IF**. The intent is if a package is reaching in and using chocolatey's internals, such as internal methods **NOT** in the public api (`Get-ChocolateyWebFile` **is** part of the public api), they will break.  The comment was **in general**, not necessarily applying to firefox's package. And it doesn't as we realized in a later comment I made that you skipped over.\n\nLet me give you an example. There are packages looking up the path to c:\\chocolatey\\chocolateyInstall\\Nuget.exe and using it. I've advised the ones I know to not depend on internals as they can and will change.  ScriptCs fixed this - https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/pull/240 (from https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/issues/239).\n\nOther examples include using any function not in here: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/helpers/chocolateyInstaller.psm1#L12\n\nWhich would include https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/functions/Generate-BinFile.ps1 and anything in https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/tree/master/src/functions, which believe it or not, folks have done in the past and are still doing now. \n\nI have to say anytime you use things from any tool that are not part of the public api, you should expect that any upgrade should break your stuff. If you are using the API then it should not break it without a major version change (that's semver). If it does, it's a bug and you should expect me to do as I've done here.\n\nChocolatey is SemVer compliant - because we are not v1 we can make wild changes. But I try to provide non-breaking changes where possible. Let's not twist these words here. \n. > Are you seriously saying that every package code outside Chocolatey\u2019s API (e.g regular PowerShell code) will start to break once Chocolatey gets rewritten in C#?\n\nPowershell is not going away. Far from it. Just the internal stuff (internal chocolatey code, not part of the public API) is going away from powershell, so if folks are depending on things they should not (as previously stated), then they are going to have their packages break. Regular powershell is still going to be available as it is a fundamental part of how choco works.\n\nHope this brings an understanding into what I mean by not reaching into chocolatey's purview (internals and areas of concern).\n. I think this might have to do with something similar to #454 \n. @030 Some real live examples would be good.\n. I'm still confused what kind of service this is installing. Is this not a Windows Service (most of those do NOT require ports)?\n. No need, I was trying to understand how port would keep the service from being started if no port is specified when it is optional.\n. One of these is https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/505. Other known issue was https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/372 (specifically https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/372#issuecomment-37553192 relates to this).\n. Nope, let's call this a bug. \n. Also #509 \n. This seems to only be on GUI applications :(\n. @kevinsawicki I pushed a prerelease package with the fixes. Can you install chocolatey prerelease and then reinstall atom to regenerate the shim? Or have the person who reported the issue do this... :)\n\n``` sh\nchoco install chocolatey -pre\nchoco install atom -f\n```\n\nThen try the issue reported again to see if it also working for you now?\n. @vbsql7 can you post the gist? It could be related to the package, but it may be a bug in choco.\n. This could be the issue of just installing chocolatey and not having that\nvariable set.\n\nOn Sunday, December 21, 2014, Gary Ewan Park notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> @vbsql7 https://github.com/vbsql7 can you confirm what version of\n> Chocolatey you are using?

Backwards compatibility with a nice deprecation message when used. :) Or we just create an alias\n. The alias would be part of this work.\n. We don't need an issue opened for tests when it is part of the rollup of something else.\n. Awesome. Thanks for catching that!\n. It was a tiny change so I just put it on stable and pushed it. Thanks again for catching the issue!\n. That's a package issue and not a chocolatey issue. Please contact the\npackage maintainers through the package page on chocolatey.org\n\nOn Thursday, July 10, 2014, mawasay notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> After installing jdk8.

This caused a major issue with chocolatey that made me yank the new release shortly after pushing it out. For reference see https://github.com/atom/chocolatey/issues/23#issuecomment-48799362\n. Will need to add some more guards around this...\n. @jberezanski I added a comment noting why we would wait the process.\n. This is a duplicate of #516 \n. It's there in 2.0, but the documentation on MSDN is misleading. Since it is a bug with 3+, I made sure we didn't hit some infinite loop waiting.\n. What bat files?\n. Aka, we don't generate bat files as of 0.9.8.24. You may want to upgrade.\n. Once you do that you can change the heading of this ticket and reopen it ;)\n. Perhaps there is  shimgen depth we can pass?\n. Done\n. It's part of integrating with other systems, like ruby gems, python and webpi. We may only have support for getting things installed.\n. @Apazman Not the same issue. Please create another issue and include debug output.\n. @brettporter I think this might be useful for chocolatey/choco as well.\n. This was implemented as part of https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/14\n. Specifically https://github.com/ferventcoder/choco/commit/10105b300c80a952b3c905f9a298bc8e86199083\n. Perhaps. This should only leave the installer alone if it finds the checksum to be the same, but it could be I introduced something else into the mix fixing what was thought to be an issue.\n. Adding checksums to your package would also be helpful.\n. When you say you cleaned up all the files, do you mean you deleted the %TEMP% files?\n. What is wonky then?\n. Definitely not clear as you said it worked in the end with a file in the temp folder (as I was attempting to clear that up).\n\nSo did it work in the end or did it fail?\n. Now I understand. Yes, big bug.\n. I think I understand what might be causing this - are pandoc 1.11 and 1.12 installer files the exact same size (get-contentlength)?\n. super big bug then :(\n. Help me out here - I'm trying to reproduce - https://gist.github.com/ferventcoder/d928b61f69d65ac7bd4e\n. Going to have to close this as not reproducible unless we get to the bottom of this. I'll need full debug output to understand what is wrong.\n. That would be super helpful.\n. I tried this with a local package and it appears to work just fine. \n\n```\nC:\\> choco install pandoc\nChocolatey (v0.9.8.28-alpha2) is installing 'pandoc' and dependencies.

Could this just be a misunderstanding of -force? If you have a package in chocolateyinstall + lib, force doesn't remove what is already there (yet).\n. Closing as non-repro\n. Likely a bug, but I'm going to need -debug output to know for sure.\n\nAlso, you should be using single tick marks surrounding, not double double quotes. Powershell doesn't handle those double quotes correctly so instead of `\"\"url;url\"\"`, try `''url;url''` (note that is two single `'` marks)\n.

Closing as not an issue unless we hear back that the adjustment did not work.\n. Remote execution is not considered supported right now.\n. Is that ALL it takes? whoa\n. Done.\n. Don't know.\n. It appears that it supports a -Version argument but that help menu is the same across all commands. We are rewriting choco in c# and the help menus are very specific.\n. I see what you mean. It is passing the help through to nuget, but choco itself doesn't support a -version option at the current time.\n. It's planned. :)\n. The intent is for you to copy that, not try to type it out yourself. The cmd.exe stuff is especially archaic and I think I've only attempted to type it out by hand maybe twice in 3 years. It's not easy, it's not fun. It's better to copy. :)\n. @tedsanders Ah, good point. Perhaps we teach people how to do that. :)\n\nRight click -> paste or set quick edit mode (right click is all you need and it pastes for you).\n\nThen once you have chocolatey installed, you install `wincommandpaste` and then you can Control+V. :)\n. Weird, I just ran exactly this without error.\n. Hmm. Run the install command like this: `choco install atom -debug -force`\nand post the output here.\n. Delete whatever is located at 'C:\\Users\\Samuel\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\chocolatey\\Atom\\AtomInstall.zip'\n. The errors you are seeing are not normal. I'm not yet sure what is causing\nit on your system as opposed to others. Can we have you move your install\nlocation to the default programdata to rule out a permissions issue with\nyour current install location?\n\nOn Saturday, July 26, 2014, Samuel Debruyn notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Same issue, every install/update seems to fail by the way.

FWIW other folks are not experiencing these issues. Due to not being reproducible, I'd like to understand what it is about your environment that is causing issues. Let me know if you experience these errors in the future when/if you reinstall.\n. think of filetype as installertype :)\n. perhaps a vagrant box?\n. Boo. Would you see this as an issue?\n. It's likely the upgrade from nuget 2.1 to nuget 2.8\n. This is fixed in choco.exe. Everything is happily in abc order again.\n. @Redsandro yeah, it gets fun. You are trying too hard to get to these VMs - you should really use vagrant - see https://github.com/ferventcoder/vagrant-windows-puppet\n. Operation timing out is weird, it shouldn't do that. You might try upgrading chocolatey to the latest version first.\n. depends on the boxes - https://vagrantcloud.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&sort=&provider=&q=windows\n. There is also a vagrant box offered by MSOpenTech. It is like 8GB packed though.\n. 4GB for Windows 2012R2 isn't bad. Mine is 4GB on both vrtualbox and vmware_fusion\n. Back to the issue at hand, what is the output of chocolatey v.27?\n. DEBUG: Running 'Get-WebHeaders' with url:'http://download.gnome.org/binaries/win32/tomboy/1.14/Tomboy-1.14.0.msi', userAgent: 'chocolatey command line'\nDEBUG: Setting the UserAgent to 'chocolatey command line'\nWrite-Error : tomboy did not finish successfully. Boo to the chocolatey gods!\n. Does it time out on HEAD?\n. Upon further investigation, the .net framework is unable to download the file for some reason. It's not just a HEAD request that times out, it's any request.\n. The 302 redirect to HTTPS... \n. Just of note, this doesn't affect PowerShell 3/4 as they use .NET Framework 4.0\n. It's Powershell v2.0 related as it uses .NET framework 2.0/3.5. Whatever issue it was seems to be fixed in newer versions of powershell, but to be sure I'm going to update to posh 3 in my vm and see if it fails.\n. Inspection with fiddler determines that the SSLv3 has a handshake failure - http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/5be893c2-b16c-4e2c-ad9a-ab4deb0c8962/ssl-handshake-failure?forum=netfxcompact\n. @Redsandro Posh v2 uses .net framework 2.\n. You are going to love the answer to this... \n. This is a bit naive implementation. What we might want to do is create a short timeout and then move to the fallback when it fails for the remainder of the run.\n. It's b/c the fallback doesn't work on .net framework v2, but it works on v4. If you look at current protocol you will see: `Ssl3, Tls`\n. Give it a shot - https://chocolatey.org/packages/chocolatey/0.9.8.28-alpha1\n. @Redsandro the undocumented way to get absolute latest:\n\n`@powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy unrestricted -Command \"iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/installabsolutelatest.ps1'))\" && SET PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\chocolatey\\bin`\n\nNote `https://chocolatey.org/installabsolutelatest.ps1`\n. Similar but not the same - you are missing a certificate that is required to allow the installation. https://chocolatey.org/docs/proxy-settings-for-chocolatey#still-having-trust-issues - we'll be moving this to a troubleshooting page.\n. That's simple, you just remove the -lo\n. I pushed this fix. `choco install chocolatey -pre`.\n. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25129232/chocolatey-cant-install-git\n. Not missing much important other than a naive implementation ensuring the name of the file.\n. I think this may be covered by another issue...?\n. Migrated to https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/435\n. There is a way to add debugging information to the installer: \n1. Download the package file from https://chocolatey.org/packages/chocolatey/0.9.8.27\n2. Unzip it (treat it as a zip file, it might help to add .zip to the end of the filename).\n3. Start up PowerShell.\n4. Type the following: \n\n``` ps\nSet-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted\n$DebugPreference = \"Continue\";\n$env:ChocolateyEnvironmentDebug = 'true'\n```\n1. Navigate to the folder you just unzipped and run\n\n``` ps\n& tools\\chocolateyInstall.ps1\n```\n. @SpeCter is this the error? \n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/chocolatey.ps1#L89-L93\n. @SpeCter Under which context did you originally set the executionpolicy?\n\nTo verify your setting, `get-executionpolicy`.\n\nIt may also provide some WTF moments, brought to you by powershell.\n. I don't know a ton about bypass other than it should bypass the current policy (passed as you startup PowerShell).\n. Alternatively, we could stop operation without a special switch\n. The first was added so that the second made sense.\n. @Redsandro It didn't, that is correct. It operated in a totally insecure way and was located in c:\\chocolatey where anyone could have messed with any file at any point. \n. You can install it to somewhere else, we are just making the default more secure.\n. right. In program data it needs a user with admin permissions to do stuff.\n. This is no bueno :(\n. > It also looks like you really don't need to pass in the zip file name because the unzip log file is based on the package name.\n\nThis change would be considered a possible security issue in implementation.\n. It's probably more so that the uninstall functionality just doesn't work appropriately.\n. @DarwinJS This is already a known issue and also already has a PR to fix it up. I've also added notes on how this would be fixed in the powershell function file related to install-chocolateypath.\n. Let's continue discussion in the actual ticket over on Choco.\n. https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/310\n. Never saw that one before.\n\nWhat gives with the folder `C:\\xampp`?\n. Is it possible that this is local to the package and thus a package issue?\n. what version of chocolatey?\n. Can I get full debug output?\n. XAMPP works on your version of Windows yes?\n. As a workaround, you can explicitly add the source at the end to call `choco update pkgname -source 'https://chocolatey.org/api/v2/'` OR call `choco install pkgname`\n. And then magically it starts to work again... total WTF\n. What version of chocolatey?\n. Please upgrade to 0.9.8.27 and tell me if the issue still exists?\n\nEverything past 0.9.8.24 is using the latest nuget.exe.\n. Closing for now, this isn't really something we want in there yet. If this is needed, I'm sure it will come up again in the new choco.\n. This was an issue previously (for about one beta release) when chocolatey was looking at nuget 2.8 output incorrectly. This was almost immediately corrected. Not sure why you are seeing it.\n. But having fiddler open while testing could cause issues. Run it with -debug and pass back the output.\n. That is actually not a bad idea, but I think folks would still have issues if they were set to restricted.\n. This could potentially move over to choco.\n. Went a different way here. Yep, I've been seeing this as well. Seems like something wonky going on with the newly included nuget.exe 2.8.2.\n\nFYI, I'm also seeing this behavior on nuget.core.\n. Seems like something went wrong with my email reply.... so here goes again:\n\nOn the mailing list I recently went through what it would take for this package to include npm. Perhaps I'll put some time to it. \n\nTo reduce confusion though, the chocolatey issues list is reserved for problems/enhancements for chocolatey, not the community maintained packages. Problems with packages should be reported directly to the maintainers. Thanks!\n. Here's the link to that message where I detailed what it would take to include npm - https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/chocolatey/IcIkfqEvxtI/zsMvlmhdQm0J\n. So... try the install now. Should also include npm.\n.

I need the output of the following commands:\n\n```\nGet-ItemProperty \"hklm:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Command Processor\"\nGet-ItemProperty \"hklm:\\Software\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Command Processor\"\nGet-ItemProperty \"hkcu:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Command Processor\"\n&where.exe cpack \ncmd\n```\n\nI think you have something set to run automatically when you start up the cmd.exe, which is causing your errors.\n. Closing this as an environmental issue until I hear back (as it appears local to your system).\n. @haf About two weeks ago I would not have known to do that either. \n. That should probably be putting ansicon somewhere with less changes.... \n. @carolynvs apologies, somehow this fell of my radar. \n- src/functions are things subject to be completely absorbed into c# and thus not open for API usage.\n- src/helpers/functions are things that are usually part of the published api (that the chocolateyinstaller.psm1 publishes) that folks can depend on being there as a powershell function.\n. This implements #307 \n. @carolynvs I went with a bit of an easier fix for now. It helps with when package maintainers are also not using our defined functions and using `$env:TEMP` in their scripts. \n. I just pushed 0.9.8.29-beta1 with the functionality in it.\n. Would be nice right? Yeah, we need the client to understand when it can't reach the server... I think it says right now that the site is unreachable in debug output?\n. @Redsandro I know you well enough now to know you almost always are in jest. :)\n\n> PS - The :poop: was a joke, not a flame.\n\nShould have said:\nPS - The :poop: was a joke, not a defecation.\n. This is already done in the C# rewrite...\n. - You are on an older version of chocolatey. Please upgrade and see if this is still an issue.\n1. I've never seen that happen before (installing the wrong package). Ever. It could have been an Issue with your source (I've never seen private.feed.ca), which explains a problem. Do you trust that source? \n2. I don't think there is a bug in the matching algorithm, I think it's related to that feed doing something completely wonky.\n\nPerhaps the client should do a better job with feeds, but the problem here is with the feed doing the wrong thing, not with chocolatey doing the wrong thing. \n\nLet's update this issue a bit to something more workable regarding the client doing an id match versus what was requested.\n. What I'd need from you is a -debug output and fiddler output.\n. Might want to make sure it is https://plus.google.com/+RobReynolds_FerventCoder/ \n. That's not really a good looking error at all. :-1: \n\nAny chance you would run with `-debug` and post output here?\n. Also, this may or may not have to do with a fresh install of the .net framework. It can get finicky after just being installed and sitting on a pending reboot and refuse to cooperate. So it might just need a reboot?\n. Don't have a tag for not reproducible... \n. windows--\n. I recently changed it to installertype. That was my bad, changing it before\nthe source code catches up.

Chocolatey is in beta, and by v1 it won't need to have an uninstall script except for areas where folks want/need to do extra work. \n\nFor the most part, most packages don't do more than the native installer does, so simply going to programs and features and removing the software removes it from the machine, one just needs to also remember to remove the package files.\n. Would you rather work be put into this or into making it unnecessary?\n. Ah, but if they don't do anything outside of chocolatey install boundaries, choco uninstall cleans it right up. This is the case of atom (except maybe the desktop shortcut).\n. MinGW and CygWin I can see needing something to help cleanup, but I am not familiar with cwrsync.\n. Agreed. This will get better. My hope has always been to be able to inspect the chocolatey install and see what was done and do the opposite in some respects. \n. @JVimes perhaps you can help me on that. I don't know that I ever changed the default value of .txt files, but I don't have the context menu entries for new files in Windows 2012R2. I wonder if it was removed?\n. Don't worry about the appveyor failure. It's going to fail for awhile methinks...\n. There are some tests that seem to fail in that environment. I need to get to the bottom of those.\n. https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ferventcoder/chocolatey/build/1.0.5  - would be neat to see the test output show up but it is not adding the test output file for some reason.\n. @gep13 I thought I could just use artifacts but apparently not...\n. @mwrock Right. That's what I was trying to say before. The failures are not related to your pull request, so feel free to ignore those.\n. Duplicate of https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/5\n. > This is a general query about apt-like functionality that I can't find. Either I've missed it or the query will evolve into some enhancement requests ;)\n\nIt's possible some or all of this isn't included due to differences between Chocolatey and Windows versus Debian and *nix.\n\n> With the choco update command, is it possible to do some/any of the following?\n> 1. get an indication before downloading how much will be downloaded\n\nUnfortunately most packages only contain instructions on where to go download items from the official distribution point. Chocolatey operates without the need for `-y` presently, so it's hard to see ahead of time without adding in a switch. It would also need to download the packages themselves to get an indication of what they are going to need to download prior to giving an accurate estimate. Some packages contain everything they need though, so it makes it hard to get an exact indication without downloading some packages. I think it's possible this could be implemented though, but probably not by v1.\n\n> 2 failing that, get an indication before downloading which packages will be updated\n\nAdding in an indication is definitely possible, but I think that chocolatey first needs to be able to update package indexes.\n\n> 3 interrupt a download and resume later\n\nI could see this at some point, but probably not by v1. \n\n> 4 request a download only (no installation)\n\nThis definitely needs to be written down as a feature. Plans are in mind to implement this in the rewrite, but I'm not sure it's been added as a feature.\n\n> 5 install from a previous download only (don't attempt to download at all - \"offline mode\")\n\nIt already does this as of 0.9.8.24.\n\n> 6 get a report of release notes for downloaded packages (ok, this is a feature of apt-listchanges not core apt :)\n\nInteresting. This is definitely something that could be added. Probably after v1 though.\n. Done, but over here https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/releases.atom\n. Agreed.\n. I wonder if the chocolateyInstall.ps1 is swallowing the error... \n. @warnergodfrey @bmedlin I believe this was just fixed by @mwrock  in a recent PR.\n. #658 \n. @mwrock where would you put that bit of code?\n. @mwrock nevermind, found a good spot. :)\n. Where did you get `\\` in front of `@powershell` ?\n. Please move this over to https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org\n. awesome! \n. Actually we put in a fix just to address a bug in PS v3 with not waiting processes...\n. It's possible it's something in there that is messed up? https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/516\n. No, it appears #516 caused this issue :)\n. it's already done in the rewrite.\n. #595 #253 \n. @Stanzilla it's not yet FOSS but it will be soon.\n. Closing as a duplicate.\n. This isn't exactly a duplicate but yeah. \n. This looks like a package issue. It seems like it would be much better served to make the comment on the disqus thread on the package page itself for others who may run into this issue?\n. @smikims packages can change environment variables. If they have an underlying installer they can do just about anything.\n. Ahhh virus scanners. You can't live with them, you can't live without them. :/\n. I wonder if we could get something there that allows it to wait on a lock...\n. This won't be fixed in powershell. The posh version is at its limit. The new c# version is almost done.\n. @fibric We'll see if this remains an issue once the new c# version comes out. I expect many of the logged issues to just close as non-issues once that happens. This may be one of them.\n. @Stanzilla Repo is not publicly available yet. For ETA, I'd suggest signing up for the newsletter. :)\n. This looks like a problem with the package itself. Please follow up on the package page at https://chocolatey.org/packages/xampp\n. Need a debug log. \n\nCall with `-debug`\n. Uninstall has .... ...issues. :/ The order of execution in the POSH chocolatey could be part of the issue... \n. It looks like this has broken some tests. https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ferventcoder/chocolatey/build/1.0.37\n. Also, we have a rewrite coming... I wouldn't suggest pursuing this any further as it will be deprecated in a few weeks for something that works so much better.\n. > ShimGen is non-free proprietary software: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/master/src/tools/shimgen.license.txt\n\nIt's possible that it could later be offered as a standalone product. I do doubt that it will be a free product though. At the current time we are wanting to see more folks making packages to take advantage of it. \n. If you want to play with this, there is a prerelease https://chocolatey.org/packages/chocolatey/0.9.8.29-alpha1\n. So it works if it finds the path. However the working directory of shimgen doesn't find it appropriately :/\n. > choco install cygwin -debug -overrideArgs '-q -R C:\\tools\\cygwin\n> -l C:\\tools\\cygwin\\packages -s http://mirrors.kernel.org/sourceware/cygwin'\n\nOverrideArgs is a switch, it just means ONLY use what I pass in for InstallArgs (if documentation is confusing, please let us know how to make it better).\n\nIf you take a look at the files section of the package http://chocolatey.org/packages/cygwin, you can see what Chocolatey does. \n\nYou need to run the command like `choco install cygwin -debug -overrideArgs -installArgs '-q -R C:\\tools\\cygwin -l C:\\tools\\cygwin\\packages -s http://mirrors.kernel.org/sourceware/cygwin'`\nto make it work correctly.\n. I'm going to close this as not an issue, if you feel the docs need work though to better explain, please make further comments and I will reopen it as a documentation issue.\n. It also works for me, but you do have a good point. It should be attempting from https now that we are no longer subject to SNI.\n. Are you subject to a proxy at all?\n. No worries, thanks for following up! \n. Thanks, I think we should have grabbed this but apparently I missed it. I will see what we can work up in new choco.\n. That is not the correct reason we chose to move it. It was related to CVEs\nthat were never made public. It had nothing to do with folks that do not\nknow how to call the right functions. When stuff fails do to folks not\nknowing how to properly call for admin access, the packages should properly\nfail.\n\nI'm not really sure how you came to that conclusion as the reason but I've\nnever stated as much and I've never heard anyone on the team state as much\neither.\n\nRegarding the CVE - The old default install location has too many\nprivileges that allows anyone to make changes to pkg installers or do other\nnasty stuff if they get access to a box. There were some other CVEs related\nto domain poisoning that we've also fixed.\n\nFurther, the old posh version of choco is ending with a new version that is\nfaster and more stable. Not sure if you have seen that yet. You may want to\nsign up for the newsletter if you have not.\n\nOnce we get the security stuff ironed out, the plan is to allow easier\nnon-admin installations again. But it must be done in a way that is secure\nfor that user and not open to package security issues like before.\n\nOn Saturday, October 4, 2014, Julian Easterling notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> That has been a sticking point for me as well recently...

It is a bit annoying to see \n. > Given that Chocolatey is still not a 1.0 product and that I have not seen the new rewrite yet, and to be honest, I'm still waiting to see what the OneGet project does; however, I will sign up for the newsletter as the chocolatey project has made package management on Windows systems much closer to the same experience I have under the Ubuntu systems I manage.\n\nOneGet is a package manager aggregator.

Let me know if it doesn't work. It should. I haven't tried a `choco install chocolatey --version 0.9.8.32 --force`\n. Although doing exactly that seems to have worked for me.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/63502/5939944/3173a52e-a6cd-11e4-9c87-a6271417cffc.png)\n. Interestingly enough, I would have thought there would be more output from the install.\n. Show me the chocolateyInstall.ps1 file? \n\nI think you need to remove the $url64 completely.\n. It's a bug then... \n. Curious about the actual PATH - like in the registry or in Control Panel -> System.\nBoth PowerShell and Cmd.exe are very limited in their ability to refresh environment variables. \n. This is fixed by https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/303 I believe, and further fixed by https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/699\n. Yep, it's because you call chocolatey, it starts a child session of cmd.exe then powershell.exe - and that gets updated. Which works appropriately if you are installing something that depends on something else being on the path because during that session everything is updated. \n. To see it on your path in posh, you need to exit and come back in. We are working on getting `Update-Session` where you can call it for updating your environment as well.\n. We are going to be adding a module for update-sessonenvironment so you can do this in powershell. Look for that over in https://github.com/chocolatey/choco\n. I'd prefer it be compatible all the way back to posh v2 unless there is some requirement to be with posh v3+\n. Closed by updating all three locations.\n. This may be a dupe\n. #253 \n. Yikes, yeah. The benefit of putting downloads stuff in the temp folder is that the bigger stuff goes away with cleaning the temp folder out.\n\nHowever the packages (lib) folder will start to get smaller with one package version in/one out for upgrades and stuff. In choco rewrite this is the default.\n. Closed as a duplicate. Sorry, mentioned that awhile ago. Just doing some issue triage and noticed it was still open. \n. Appreciate the thoughts. However we are rewriting chocolatey, which is why we ask in contributing that you contact us first to get buy off on a feature before you start working on it. \n\nThis looks like an interesting feature though. I'd like to get some input on it later as it relates to the rewrite (which is c#).\n. I think ultimately being able to do an install from a web server with an open index should be doable.\n. So I am curious. Is it causing problems or more just an annoyance?\n. We are rewriting chocolatey as an exe so you won't have any bats that are subject to this issue. :)\n. #602 closes this. Thanks!\n. Thanks! \n. @kaiaie what version of posh do you have installed on Win2008?\n\nAlso, we tweaked an issue with this in the current release (released a few hours ago - 0.9.8.28) - it's possible that you won't see the process id issues on the latest version.\n. It looks like it is erroring on the line that tries to wait the process if it is still running (which has a try catch) but I think it might actually be something else. It's hard to say. \n. What happens if you try to install the app without chocolatey in the equation on one of the failing systems?\n. I believe I just fixed this - It will be testable in choco 0.9.9-rc8 and above.\n. @cleung2010 I see how this may look like a similar issue but it doesn't appear to be. You may want to remove the try catch from around the chocolatey script so you get a better handle on where the error is occurring. It looks like something in the package itself. Also any issues with choco belong at https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues, not over here. Thanks!\n. @cleung2010 thanks, I will follow up over there.\n. @lmayorga1980 try `-ia` - that's the short version of installargs\n. That is a command/batch issue and will not exist in the new compiled version of choco. It's an annoyance at best, but it is an issue with using batch files. The underlying process gets orphaned, but it still knows about it, so it keeps asking if you want to terminate the process.\n\nYou can observe this behavior by pulling up Process Explorer (Sysinternals)\n. Other tools that use .cmd/.bat files that call out to executables will display this same behavior.\n\nI'm closing this as a non-issue. A message would be good, but this issue should not exist in the new version of choco.exe.\n. There you go, XML code. ;)\n. I think this may be similar to #589 and #544\n. Calling this closed as a duplicate, plus I think it is fixed in choco.exe.\n. Import the `chocolateyInstaller.psm1` file in %chocolateyinstall%\\chocolateyinstall\\helpers\n. @svnpenn `#3` is no longer an issue with choco.exe, it works now. The creating packages story is starting to get smoother, expect more plus ups this winter. Of course choco.exe needs to get finished....\n. No you are good. The rewrite stuff isn't out yet. There isn't anything public to play with. We are going to FOSS it soon.\n. @lonniev raise a new issue for that please. Thanks! \n. 1. create `chocolateyInstall.ps1`\n2. call choco install `pkg.nuspec` --force\n. FYI - https://github.com/chocolatey/choco\n. @jmbeach Howdy. It looks like you are missing something. However if you want to follow up, let's do that over at https://github.com/chocolatey/choco.. That answers the question. Uninstall is very naive. Recommend you would uninstall prior to upgrade or wait for the c# version which will be out soon. It does a much better job of handling older versions, upgrades and uninstalls.\n. That's an interesting issue. This looks like it might be something with https://github.com/chocolatey/puppet-chocolatey though. Thoughts?\n. Can you run that with --debug --verbose --trace and post the output?\n. ```\n==> default: Wrapped exception:\n==> default: Execution of 'C:\\ProgramData\\chocolatey\\chocolateyInstall\\chocolatey.cmd install siteminder -version 12.51 -ia \"-f C:\\Temp\\siteminder-12.51-win64.properties\" -source http://myserver/nuget' returned 1: Chocolatey (v0.9.8.28) is installing 'siteminder' and dependencies.

Lots of [search results](https://www.google.com/search?q=Second+path+fragment+must+not+be+a+drive+or+UNC+name&oq=Second+path+fragment+must+not+be+a+drive+or+UNC+name&aqs=chrome..69i57&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=119&ie=UTF-8), particularly this one about using `c:\\` - http://gayotfow.wordpress.com/2014/04/27/second-path-fragment-must-not-be-a-drive-or-unc-name/\n\nI think it has to do with your install args from the looks of things. Thoughts?\n. @lmayorga1980 I think this might be fixed in the new choco, but the puppet provider would need to be updated first...\n. Yup - https://chocolatey.org/docs/features-automatically-recompile-packages\n. This is closed by https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/108\n. when you run with -debug, where does this fail?\n. This looks actually to be more of an issue with the current PHP package. The download link doesn't work for me. \n\nAre you experiencing this issue with other packages or just this one?\n. Oh no - it is a package issue, the original download link works. But unfortunately the package itself attempts to check there prior to going to the archives folder. Which would work if it were there.\n. Take a look here: https://chocolatey.org/packages/php#files - I posted this over at https://github.com/ferventcoder/chocolatey-packages/issues/38\n\nI'm going to close this as not a chocolatey issue. Please followup on the package issue itself.\n. @gep13 no proxy for you I'm afraid. Not something I would have immediately thought to look at either.\n. This repository is for issues with Chocolatey itself. This seems like a package issue. Please follow up directly with those folks through the contact maintainers page on chocolatey.org - https://chocolatey.org/packages/atom OR you can take a shortcut and file the issue here: https://github.com/atom/chocolatey/issues\n. Try this instead - choco install chocolatey\n. Not sure why but sometimes it gets a bit weird about version differences.\n. This is a duplicate of #122 \n. I'm thinking a file named something like `.bins` that points to a relative path in the package where all of the exe/batch files are. If found, choco will only evaluate this file (but `.gui` and `.ignore` files will still be used).\n. Actually scratch that name, nuget [has a bug](https://nuget.codeplex.com/workitem/4285) on names of files/folders that start with dot `.`. It's a really stupid limitation, I don't remember if we override it with choco.exe or not.\n. @jberezanski agreed. \n\nAnd I think ultimately extending the nuspec schema. We are definitely going in that direction.\n. sure why not... \n.

Merged into stable at https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/commit/9947bae570efaf4d34027f53e3f371fab6328cd3\n. Is this a docs issue? I don't see this as a code issue. For matters such as this, it is a much better avenue to use the discussion list - chocolatey at googlegroups dot com.\n. @030 move `/disablepush` further to the left. \n. This is a duplicate of probably a few items. Uninstall is stupidly naive. We are rewriting choco and it doesn't suffer from this. \n. That said, you can just keep calling the uninstall or go to the folder and manually remove those items for now.\n. Duplicate of #389 \n. Apologies if I don't give you a direct answer but after answering the question several times already (all are searchable and readily readable) - I think we just need to document it on the wiki.\n. Also, questions work out much better on the mailing list - chocolatey at googlegroups dot com.\n. You can, if you provide a custom override for write-host. We do... that's how we log the output.\n. https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/helpers/functions/Write-Host.ps1\n. https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/helpers/functions/Write-Debug.ps1\n. https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/helpers/functions/Write-Error.ps1\n. See #416 and #411 \n. Closing as a duplicate\n. You are using an older npm. It is now bundled with Msi and newer versions\nare not released separately.

Interesting. I'm really impressed with that latest design. It has less of a blocky feel.\n\nSome things I like:\n- It captures the essence of a package that is being unwrapped to get to the inside, it's what's inside the package that counts.\n- The design is smooth. This signifies the process is a smooth transition from one state to another.\n- It's simple but not over simplistic. This signifies another essence of choco. A tool that is super simple to use and create packages with.\n- I think you are really starting to capture the essence of Chocolatey (as I described above).\n\nSome things I'd like you to keep thinking about:\n- It should show a transition of moving from non-real to very real in a sense that you go from a concept of \"choco install\" to having real software on your machine.\n- I'm not in love with the package wrapper color. Would prefer some contrast between the chocolatey goodness in the wrapper but somewhat darker on the wrapping. Should still really stand out against a black background.\n- I'm not sure about the skew. It's interesting and I think I'm starting to like it, but trying to determine if it adds or takes away from the design. I think it adds but I'm still chewing on it a bit.\n\nFor the packages themselves, I feel that this design would be too much/too long. So perhaps an icon that is necessary as well. Some key points for an icon:\n- It should be square.\n- Still captures the essence of unwrapping a package to get to the goodness inside.\n- Is simple but not over-simplistic.\n- No letters, numbers or words. Should stand out as an icon alone.\n- Looks good at 16x16 all the way up to 512x512. \n- Maybe the current icon captures that already?\n. updated my last set of comments a bit. @juliankrispel This is looking really good!\n. Make the C white?\n. @juliankrispel can you render the last image with a colon so we can get a side by side? https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/640#issuecomment-70228696\n. @juliankrispel color of the wrapping - The lighter color on https://chocolatey.org \n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/63502/5837853/844f9238-a148-11e4-9d49-514df965d238.png)\n. I missed mentioning it but I showed your designs to my wife and kids and they also preferred `#8` then `#6`. \n. We have plans for a redesign of the site - https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org/issues/149 - your last image fits right in there, although some of that will break out to other pages.\n. I'm digging `#8` with the white `Chocolatey` - I also like `#6` quite a bit.

Awesome. Thanks for understanding. I'm trying to understand why you would want to remove traces of the install. We have similar packages that only run once, but you keep them around in case there are updates to the packages and you want to deploy that new functionality out.\n. Pending discussion a PR may be issued against new choco.\n. > I also noticed that even though the Kickstarter is funded and closed, that you have sold very few of the larger business pledges.\n\nI think this is mostly in part due to a short 30 day window, no guarantee that the kickstarter was going to be successful (until about 3 days out when it funded), businesses usually want to remain private, and most businesses go through a PO to do amounts over $1,000 (the PO process is usually longer than 10 days - they are not going to do it through a kickstarter). \n\nWould you guys have funded with your name on the public backers page and been able to do so with a credit card (not a PO)? That question is mostly curiosity, because most of the businesses I talked to indicated one or more of the above.\n. I wouldn't hold much water in the low amount of business licenses sold. I'd reserve that for when we have a billing system set up and what the potential is going to be. I'd imagine that we are going to see a few that I probably won't be able to name. :)\n. > Would it be possible to go for one of these pledges even though the Kickstarter is closed?\n\nUnfortunately, once a Kickstarter is over, you can't back the project. However next summer we will have a system set up for accepting payments and generating licenses. \n. A chocolatey package != install something\n. That's my first response. I will want to consider a bit more based on your example.\n. installing a package gets misinterpreted as only \"installing\" software on a machine, but it can also make configuration changes (which I believe you are defining as .run packages).\n. The question being, if you applied a configuration, how would you know it happened if you deleted the package?\n\nUpdate - What I mean is, if you have a large range of computers and you want to know which ones were successful and which ones were not applying a configuration, what would you need to do to see it happened? \n\nAlso, how does dpkg/rpm handle this concept now?\n. Concept of pinning packages prevents automatic upgrade of those packages.\n. Also, I wouldn't necessarily look at the community feed (chocolatey.org) as the end all be all of how most businesses use choco. The simple fact is that many, many of them NEVER hit the community feed. They are doing things somewhat differently with the packages they create, including binaries much more often and setting up configurations (so they can replace GPO). Sometimes folks couple those configurations with a configuration management tool like Puppet (config management means any change to the configuration of a computer, including settings and software). Chocolatey plugs right in as a package manager provider to Puppet.\n. I'm not dismissing this one straight off. Just trying to understand how it is different and necessary over just the normal concept of normal packages that do some configuration tasks.\n. That's :<\n. https://github.com/chocolatey/shimgen/issues/5\n. This is seen when chocolatey is being used with Windows 2003.\n. Definitely should stay with equals if possible.\n. perhaps. How does on PR wiki docs?\n. Can this be closed?\n. Does it have issues if you have `<cacheLocation></cacheLocation>` set? The intention is not for it to be removed.\n. No need. This will be completely unnecessary due to new codebase that\noverrides this. The logic in this codebase may be a bit naive, yes.\n\nOn Thursday, January 8, 2015, Glenn notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> If you add in the empty tag then no error is thrown.\n> In my case when I upgraded chocolatey from x.28 to x.30 it was missing.\n> However I could be experiencing a one-off error.\n> \n> While this has a low probability of occuring and the workaround is fairly\n> simple, I feel the logic error still needs attention;\n> - If the cacheLocation tag should _always_ be in the config file, then\n>   the error 'Write-Error : A configuration value for cacheLocation was not\n>   found' should be terminal and perhaps steps how to fix it be presented to\n>   the user\n> \n> or\n> - If it is _possible_ that the cacheLocation tag to not exist, then\n>   the case of $cacheLocation of being $null should be handled in the code as\n>   per one of my proposals.\n> \n> I realise this is a low priority issue, so I'm happy to make the changes\n> and submit a PR for it.\n> Also happy to write some pester tests for it.\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/657#issuecomment-69281884\n> .\n\n## \n\nRob\n\"Be passionate in all you do\"\n\nhttp://devlicio.us/blogs/rob_reynolds\nhttp://ferventcoder.com\nhttp://twitter.com/ferventcoder\n.

I will likely go ahead on this one.\n. This looks like a fix for #568 (ha, transposed! Wild!)\n. Merged into stable at https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/commit/bcea921831373864a908f4d48e8fbd0c390bd2b6\n. Released as well a little while ago.\n. Duplicate of #568\n. That's the problem. Get-ToolsRoot is really the name of this. It's horrrrrribly named.\n. The problem is that the terminology of the command is so bad, you and many others have identified it as essentially the same location as `c:\\programdata\\chocolatey\\bin` when in fact it represents something else entirely.\n. There is a concept of a place where you can install tools due to two reasons - \n1) current POSH choco putting version numbers on folders and \n2) folks want a place on the system out of the choco folders where they can put tools.\n\nThis is basically a location that a user can specify as `ToolsRoot`. \n\nNow muddy that up and call it `BinRoot` instead.\n. Do we need a bin root? Or is it that choco is not doing a sufficient job in some cases?\n. > I don't know. I prefer a non-shimmed binRoot for command line tools\n\nThis is what I'm curious about. Is it the older shims that were batch files? Is it performance? What hesitations do you have? Brutal honesty is fine here.\n. Tools (or portables) in this context refers to the actual software that does not come with a native installer, which is like git for windows portable zip compared to git for windows install. If software is offered as an archive of some sort in addition to or instead of through an installer - that is what is meant by \"tools.\" We actually have a pretty extensive definition of portables vs install in the context of chocolatey in the faq on the wiki.\n. @CMCDragonkai Shim, not symlink. And no, only executables found in the package directory will be shimmed automatically. Anything else that one wants to shim, they would need to use `Install-BinFile`.\n\nReferences:\n- https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/HelpersReference\n. This is fixed in choco with https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/631\n. The next upgrade is going to automatically move choco, I've just finished\ntesting that code. Hmm, what we could do is have you set an environment\nvariable that it would explicitly look for and not do the move.

THere are other options for install. - Can you take a look at those as a workaround for now? https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/Installation\n. Download the package, unzip it (https://chocolatey.org/api/v2/package/chocolatey/) In the tools folder is a chocolateyInstall.ps1, run it with PowerShell. If it doesn't work, you likely have not met the requirements.\n. For full instructions, I added the following: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/Installation#download--powershell-method\n. It's looking for `$env:SystemDrive` coming back with C: and then giving you a message that Drive C doesn't exist. \n. Actually this is even more interesting. It happens before that - \n\n``` powershell\n$toolsPath = (Split-Path -parent $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Definition)\n\n# ensure module loading preference is on\n$PSModuleAutoLoadingPreference = \"All\";\n\n$modules = Get-ChildItem $toolsPath -Filter *.psm1\n$modules | ForEach-Object {\n    $psm1File = $_.FullName;\n    $moduleName = $([System.IO.Path]::GetFileNameWithoutExtension($psm1File))\n    remove-module $moduleName -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue;\n    import-module -name  $psm1File;\n}\n\nInitialize-Chocolatey\n```\n\nFor some reason it doesn't recognize the $psm1File path.\n. Here's what I want you to do. Edit that `chocolateyInstall.ps1` to be:\n\n``` powershell\n$toolsPath = (Split-Path -parent $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Definition)\n\nWrite-Output \"`$toolsPath = $toolsPath\"\n# ensure module loading preference is on\n$PSModuleAutoLoadingPreference = \"All\";\n\n$modules = Get-ChildItem $toolsPath -Filter *.psm1\n$modules | ForEach-Object {\n    $psm1File = $_.FullName;\n    Write-Output \"`$psm1File = $psm1File\"\n    $moduleName = $([System.IO.Path]::GetFileNameWithoutExtension($psm1File))\n    remove-module $moduleName -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue;\n    import-module -name  $psm1File;\n}\n\nInitialize-Chocolatey\n```\n\nRun that and put the results back in this ticket please.\n. Do you have any idea why it is searching for C?\n\nThis seems a powershell issue, not a chocolatey issue. It seems like it wants to import the module to somewhere on the C drive (which may not exist).\n\nI'd also like the output of `$env:SystemDrive` from those machines.\n\nAlso, are those drives local drives or network mapped drives? You can't use network mapped drives without setting proper permissions for .Net. That is out of the context of this issue for me to explain that one - https://www.google.com/webhp?ie=UTF-8#q=.net%20permissions%20network%20share\n. If it is a network mapped drive, you will need to set permissions appropriately, some helpful articles:\n- https://www.sellsbrothers.com/posts/Details/1519\n- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3718697/nant-failing-with-bad-permissions-on-build-server\n- http://blogs.msdn.com/b/shawnfa/archive/2004/12/30/344554.aspx\n. Sounds like first you need to fix `$env:SystemDrive` to the proper system drive. It should have been done based on the way the computer had the system drive moved.\n\nThat is an environment variable and when wrong can affect quite a few things.\n. I am curious if `F:` and `S:` drives are network mapped drives. Trying to run code from there without the proper trust set up is going to cause you issues. It's possible you haven't hit those yet due to your first issue.\n. Hmmm, that's no bueno. I think we'll want you to jump on choco.exe as soon as we have a beta available. Until then you could set the $env:PSModulePath explicitly in chocolatey.cmd as part of starting it up. It will only affect chocolatey while it is running.\n. I'm not sure if this is is still affected in the c# version. If you find this is still the case, please open an issue over at https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/new and reference this issue. Thanks! \n. Duplicate of https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/568\n. #658 implements a fix for that.\n. You went global - @mwrock went script - https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/658\n. Hmm... Do you think folks will want a 0.9.8.x along with the new choco\nclient at 0.9.9?\n\nOn Tuesday, January 20, 2015, Rich Siegel notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> I would love to see one of these 2 go in as it has required me to fork for\n> internal use.

Closing this to prefer #658.\n. Path persisted or local shell path?\n. Do you know if these packages that are being installed/updated are using Install-ChocolateyPath? \n. I could see an issue with the way it would expand registry values on update. I did some work recently to keep that from happening in other tool. I plan to bring back some of that to choco as well.\n. I'll close for now. Feel free to open a new issue and reference this (or just comment here again) if you run into this issue again. \n. Thanks for the follow up! \n. If you are in cmd.exe and not powershell you can type `refreshenv`\n. Chocolatey comes with a batch file named the above and will query the registry and reset all of your environment variables.\n. Perhaps we need more documentation surrounding that.\n. It's an issue with Windows inability to refresh shells. It doesn't have\nanything to do with choco itself. Now that that is it off the way,\nrefreshenv is a stop gap for choco to keep you from having to close and\nreopen your cmd window. Its also mostly undocumented. The recommendation is\nthat you close and reopen your shell.\nYou can also do PowerShell if you call &\nc:\\programdata\\chocolatey\\chocolateyinstall\\helpers\\Update-Session.ps1 (the\npath may not be exactly right but you get the idea)- it may require\nimporting the module first and then calling update-session.\n\nOn Tuesday, January 27, 2015, Andy Li notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Is it possible to get RefreshEnv to work in powershell too?\n> If it cannot, there should be a warning message if RefreshEnv is used in\n> powershell instead of a silent fail.\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/666#issuecomment-71639225\n> .\n\n## \n\nRob\n\"Be passionate in all you do\"\n\nhttp://devlicio.us/blogs/rob_reynolds\nhttp://ferventcoder.com\nhttp://twitter.com/ferventcoder\n.

Yes, they are. But anything they do with respect to environment vars only\nlasts during that choco run. Once it comes back to the shell, all child\nprocess changes are gone. It would be an egregious security issue with\nWindows if child processes did more than they do to the parent process.\n\nI'm giving you an option for updating your environment variables. Also\nundocumented and not supported. Ymmv. Remember, you can just close and\nreopen your shell as well.\n\nOn Tuesday, January 27, 2015, Andy Li notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Umm..

I see those images fine? \n. Thanks.\n. Will be fixing in chocolatey/choco\n. Well apparently the commit didn't close this but https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/AutomaticPackages#testing-ketarinchocopkgup and https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/AutomaticPackages/_compare/5701cb8178cb7449de3c6fcc6d3f6efca03ddc09...6f6e97c164a85a556cb7fbab81b4246adde24947\n. https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/blob/master/src/chocolatey.resources/helpers/functions/Write-ChocolateySuccess.ps1 ( still need to remove it from https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/blob/master/src/chocolatey.resources/helpers/functions/Write-ChocolateyFailure.ps1 ) \n. Note that these fixes are in the NEW repo. This repo is currently being deprecated. https://github.com/chocolatey/choco\n. This is closed now with https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/commit/eed1f5df88a94da88a930340b3226d97db5e4626\n. It is updated. See for yourself by adding the following to your chocolateyInstall.ps1:\n\n``` powershell\nWrite-Host $env:PSModulePath\nUpdate-SessionEnvironment\nWrite-Host $env:PSModulePath\n```\n\nNow, once chocolatey EXITS and you come back to your shell (which is likely powershell), $env:PSModulePath is whatever the shell was started with + any changes you have explicitly set.\n\nIf you want `Update-SessionEnvironment` to work, you need to import the chocolateyInstaller.psm1 module into your current shell session and call `Update-SessionEnvironment`. \n\nHTH.\n. For clarity, this is not a chocolatey issue, this is is how child processes work on Windows. They have limited abilities to affect their parent process, which we can all agree is a good thing based on security issues that having that ability would create.\n. Also a duplicate of https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/666\n. I think part of the problem is that you believe that chocolatey is meant to be invoked from PowerShell because it is written in PowerShell and it's not meant to be a powershell module/script. It's a tool that can be executed from any shell. Let's be completely clear - this chocolatey is written in POSH. It is within days of being deprecated for choco (https://github.com/chocolatey/choco) which is written in C# and has a posh install provider. \n\nIt's entirely possible that we will include a module that you can add to your profile that will give you this behavior. \n. Duplicate of https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/577\n. By the way, already fixed and already out in 0.9.8.28+\n. Wrong repository. https://github.com/chocolatey/choco\n. But also, warnings are a good lead to what may later be an error. Warnings are usually information sake and may require action. Errors mean bad things.\n. Where is this? Thanks in advance!\n. Ah, just the shims. Sweet. Yeah I will get that fixed.\n. This was handled in https://github.com/chocolatey/shimgen/issues/9\n. Ping @dschinkel \n. It's been a few weeks. @dschinkel please feel free to comment on this issue or raise another one if you have more information. \n. That's interesting. I think we can make it happen, but not with this Chocolatey. Let's move this issue over to https://github.com/chocolatey/choco.\n. Wrong repository - there is already an API using OData.\n. Sorry for such a short answer. A question like this is better suited for the mailing list. If you want to learn more about the API, search for NuGet package metadata API.\n\nIf you still need to file an issue for enhancement, please do so on https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org\n. Just a quick mention. Some of these are already covered as\nissues/enhancements over at https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org.\nWould you mind subscribing/commenting on the existing issues and creating\nissues for the enhancements you can't find?\n\nAnd we can close this ticket as wrong repository.\n\nOn Tuesday, February 17, 2015, Christian Rondeau notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> As a developer and heavy user of Chocolatey - especially due to the\n> ability to choco update all - I'd like to contribute to upgrading\n> packages that are not maintained, or simply not updated \"fast enough\".\n> \n> Many packages, such as ChromeDriver2\n> https://chocolatey.org/packages/ChromeDriver2, do not reference a\n> GitHub repository with the NuGet and PowerShell source files, so it is\n> impossible for users like me to \"help\" other than poking the official\n> package maintainer.\n> \n> I think it would be greatly useful to _force_ package maintainers to\n> provide a public repository, therefore allowing pull requests and\n> potentially reducing the workload of the maintainer.\n> \n> This is related to issue #308\n> https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/308, and partially\n> covered in issue #342\n> https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/342\n> \n> Here are a few other ideas that could reduce this problem; let me know if\n> you'd like me to create several issues, as they all try to solve the same\n> problem.\n> - Ability to flag a package as outdated.

You are not supposed to uninstall - that is for when you are removing\nchocolatey completely. You should just upgrade as normal - as instructed\neverywhere else.

Fixing. Also, log issues over at chocolatey/choco repo please.\n. This was also mentioned in https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/216 & https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/215\n. Whoops @ShaneIsrael wrong repo. Please open at https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues (link to this and close this one)\n. Wrong repo - duplicate of https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/64\n. Please open this in https://github.com/chocolatey/choco \n. Closing as not applicable - you already found the proper place to post the issue though\n. @hifriend21 do you have PowerShell installed?\n. Type `where.exe powershell` after updating your path locally like you did.\n\nIf it comes up with nothing, you need to ensure you install powershell first.\n. ~~Windows 7 - it should be there by default, but you can disable the Windows Feature.~~\n. Nevermind, scratch that. Not sure how you disable/remove it. Unless you lite the install.\n. Debug is a switch, not something that accepts parameters. Basically you are saying `choco install cyg-get -y --debug` AND `choco install 1 -y --debug`.\n. This is because we allow you to state `choco install cyg-get git notepadplusplus`\n. No worries. Try to log any future issues over at chocolatey/choco. You can also hop into gitter if you want to determine if you are seeing an issue or not.\n. https://github.com/chocolatey/choco\n. https://gitter.im/chocolatey/choco\n. Wrong repository. This goes to either chocolatey/choco, or most correctly to chocolatey/chocolatey.org\n. Here's the issue technically - the site was under heavy load and so things were timing out and it was returning the 404 HTML page as the zip. You will know, the zip will be about 5KB and if you rename it to .html you will see the error page html in a text editor.\n\nHowever yesterday at 17:00 PM CDT I put in a new caching strategy and increased the timeout to nearly remove this from happening in the future.\n. You should delete the file and give it a shot now.\n. I put this over on https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org/issues/236 and I will capture all of the technical details there.\n. Try removing pre when you call for a specific version. Does that work?\n. Thanks for the followup! \n. @magmax all future requests should go over to chocolatey/choco by the way. :)\n. Please file a request with the maintainers. This is not the place for package issues. Only if there is an issue with Chocolatey itself. Thanks!\n. We shut it off completely at one point, but must have missed it during the rewrite when we moved to NuGet.Core. I'll file an issue there.\n. Moved to  https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/479\n. Howdy! This appears to he an issue with the package itself?\n. yes, use `--force`. If it also fails, you can look for skip. `-n` - See `choco uninstall -h` for options.\n. By the way, all future requests should go to chocolatey/choco repository. Thanks!\n. Thanks for filing this issue. However I believe you wanted to file it at https://github.com/chocolatey/choco?\n. No worries, I was trying to find the already created issue\n. This has been raised. I believe they are the same root cause.\n. Maybe not, thought it might be related to https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/466, but perhaps it is https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/262. \n\nI see you just raised https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/497\n. Can you explain the problem a bit more? What are you seeing, what do you expect?\n\nPriority may be explained in `choco source -h`\n. Also, this is the wrong repository. \n. Please file this issue at https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/new\n. That is a packaging issue. The maintainer needs to indicate the file is a GUI - see https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/CreatePackages#how-do-i-set-up-batch-redirects-for-applications-that-have-a-gui\n\nAlso, any further issues should be logged at https://github.com/chocolatey/choco.\n. Please contact the maintainers and ask them to make the adjustments. Thanks!\n. https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/610\n. This repository is deprecated. Please see https://github.com/chocolatey/choco - your question is actually better to ask in Gitter. \n. Gitter is https://gitter.im/chocolatey/choco \n. ? \n. No worries. :D\n. Howdy wrong repo https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/836\n. Howdy.\n\nWhen you went to create an issue, did you happen to read the note? \n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/63502/18810463/8b957250-825c-11e6-923d-fe0842c40acb.png)\n\nThis is a duplicate of https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/969\n. Big issue though - high priority for a 0.10.2 release. Follow along over on https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/969, thanks! \n. @renerchen when you went to file the issue, did you happen to notice that the template that showed up in the text box said this repo is deprected and issues should be filed somewhere else (it had a link to the new location)? I'm curious, because we've had other people also do this and I want to understand if the messaging doesn't show up.. Here is the issue - you need to upgrade .NET framework to 4.5 so Chocolatey can auto add TLS 1.1 and 1.2. There are many sites that just will not work without at least TLS 1.1 and that is not in .NET Framework 4.0, only in 4.5+. \r\n\r\nThen you should no longer see that message. HTH.\r\n\r\nIf it does not, please head over to https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/new and continue this discussion. Thanks! . @tiantianwei When you created this issue, it appears you did not read the following:\r\n\r\n> THIS REPOSITORY IS DEPRECATED. DO NOT CREATE AN ISSUE HERE.\r\n> You are looking for https://github.com/chocolatey/choco instead. Thanks!\r\n\r\nNote that it is still in your issue comments. Please advise on how we can make that clearer?\r\n\r\n\r\n. \r\nSecond, your issue is a packaging issue with the commmunity package repository. For that you want to follow up **directly** with the maintainers of the package. You can do that on the package page itself (look for Contact Maintainers on the left menu). HTH.. @tiantianwei I can not read Chinese. :D \r\n\r\nI am not a maintainer of the Bazel package on the community repository. You will want to follow up with the folks that are. At https://chocolatey.org/packages/bazel\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/63502/23558622/ee329bc0-fff9-11e6-9ea3-b2362ae13288.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you do followup, please tell them that they are using 'convertfrom-json', which is not available in PowerShell v2.

Or is it any package?\n. do you guys have a proxy in place?\n\nSomeone else reported issues with the proxy code that we took from a patch. \n\nIf you go to C:\\NuGet\\chocolateyInstall\\helpers\\chocolateyInstaller.psm1\n\nand comment out lines 499-507: \n\n``` powershell\n  if (!$webclient.Proxy.IsBypassed($url))\n  {\n    $cred = get-credential\n    $proxyaddress = $webclient.Proxy.GetProxy($url).Authority\n    Write-host \"Using this proxyserver: \" $proxyaddress\n    $proxy = New-Object System.Net.WebProxy($proxyaddress)\n    $proxy.credentials = $cred.GetNetworkCredential();\n    $req.proxy = $proxy\n  }\n```\n\nto be  \n\n``` powershell\n#  if (!$webclient.Proxy.IsBypassed($url))\n#  {\n#    $cred = get-credential\n#    $proxyaddress = $webclient.Proxy.GetProxy($url).Authority\n#    Write-host \"Using this proxyserver: \" $proxyaddress\n#    $proxy = New-Object System.Net.WebProxy($proxyaddress)\n#    $proxy.credentials = $cred.GetNetworkCredential();\n#    $req.proxy = $proxy\n#  }\n```\n\nThen tell me what you see.\n. We need better proxy support. :(\n. Fixing this again for the first time, for the last time? ;)\n. Hopefully this is fixed with the latest bits coming in 0.9.8.17. If not we will add a config value to specify your proxy type.\n. I'm thinking we'll want to do some configuration file stuff for proxies since there seems to be different ways of handling the way in\n. @grenade would you file a new issue? \n. fixed in 63cf4e0470248c2a7bb602db82af1d7da66d12ca\n.

Folks have expressed issues with the cunst (too close to another word)\n. If there is only one version, it shouldn't prompt.\n. Dependencies are not removed right now. That could get very tricky as multiple items in the repo could depend on the same package (application really) to be installed. Plus the dependency may not be a runtime dependency, only an install dependency.\n\nConsider ruby.devkit - it has dependencies on 7zip.commandline and ruby. Ruby is the hard dependency, 7zip is only so it can unpack the files.  Which dependency would you remove? The proper answer is probably neither as I might still want ruby around. Thoughts?\n. #389 & #295\n#187 \n. I think this is done-ish. New tickets will get added to choco regarding plussing up autouninstaller and registry name going into chocopackages.\n. See this for more explanation section \"3.6 Virtual packages\" http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-binary.html\n. Another resource for explanation: http://www.linuxtopia.org/online_books/linux_system_administration/debian_linux_guides/debian_linux_faq/ch-pkg_basics.en_007.html\n. Meta packages are already in chocolatey. Thanks for the suggestion though, I probably need to make the docs highlight that a little more.\n. Thought about it quite a bit, but maybe I'm missing the boat with virtual packages. I need to depend on the virtual package, but how does the virtual know what packages satisfy the virtual package requirement? \n\nFrom what you are saying, it sounds like debian uses some metadata about packages to know whether they are say a \"PDFReader\" or not.  That could get pretty server intensive as chocolatey doesn't keep a local list of packages (which also means it doesn't give a nice \"Did you mean 'apt-get curl'?\" message either.\n\nPerhaps one could depend on a tag, but that's not reliable on the nuget framework.  The current method of implementation I've thought of isn't perfect (doesn't automatically have new packages that meet the virtual requirement), but it's a start... :)\n\n\"We never usually go the right direction in the start, only discover it after we've made progress.\"\n\nAlthough if you have ideas on how to make it easier to register an application as satisfying a virtual requirement, I'm definitely open to it.\n. I believe in the blog post you were reading, I was thinking of taking virtual packages to a new level where someone could configure whether they want the \".noinstall\" or \".install\" version of a tool/application (like nodejs). Other packages would only depend on the virtual package and then the one the user wants would be installed.\n. No progress yet. We have other fundamental design issues to finish back up in the rewrite before we could even approach this. But it will be in a special extension of the nuspec format.\n. This has been moved to https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/858\n. Fixed in f467af1062950d4c4c0cbb6063448452d8ec73e9\n. By the way, this would have first surfaced for users in version 0.9.8.7 (where we upgraded to NuGet 1.5)\n. @henningc - I did log another issue for you on what you are experiencing - https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/16 - I also closed it with chocolatey 0.9.8.11 (which you can get with cup)\n. Yeah, definitely want to address this in the upcoming version. \n. This is fixed...\n. @mkmurray let's chat on chocolatey/choco, ensure you are on 0.9.10.x.\n. What you are seeing is likely a different issue and definitely not over here on the old POSH version. Https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/new \n.

Why don't we migrate your notes over to the other issue?\n. awesome. I fixed the curl package by the way and updated to the latest version. The site owner takes down old downloads.\n. This is fixed in 490390d35c2e4c9ff3ba7293c9a1da374bf4ff65\n. Yes - the whole gallery isn't complete yet, so you will probably see oddities.\n. That's why there is a huge message in red on the front page of the gallery. ;)\n. Closing this for now. When the next version of the gallery comes out, this should be fixed. If you want to, log the bug with https://github.com/ferventcoder/nugetgallery\n. It's actually .net framework 4.0 that you need installed. it's listed as a\nprerequisite for chocolatey on the readme in source, but that's probably not\nan obvious location.\n\n---\n\nRob\n\"Be passionate in all you do\"\n\nhttp://devlicio.us/blogs/rob_reynolds\nhttp://ferventcoder.com\nhttp://twitter.com/ferventcoder\nOn Oct 18, 2011 12:47 AM, \"marisks\" <\nreply@reply.github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> I tried to install completely fresh machine and started with package\n> installation.

Actually, I just noticed that the requirements are listed at the bottom of the home wiki page as well. https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki\n. I will take a look at this one...\n. Yes, this is a problem. While I am working this out, you can still install an older version.\n\ncinst notepadplusplus -version 5.9.0.1\n. Notepad++ latest version is now working. Thanks for reporting. Let's log another issue on Paint.NET...\n. Set-ExecutionPolicy UnRestricted is what is actually suggested. \n\nThis is literally from https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/Installation without any changes. Note the bolded section.\nPowerShell\nThis is the easiest method. Open a powershell command line and paste in the following and press &lt;Enter&gt;:\n\niex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString(\"http://bit.ly/psChocInstall\"))\n**Note: You must have your execution policy set to remote unsigned for this to work.**\nIt downloads and runs (https://raw.github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/master/chocolateyInstall/InstallChocolatey.ps1).\n. On the front page of chocolatey.org where it talks about Easy Install, there is also a blurb in there about having powershell set to unrestricted. Perhaps this could be made more clear somehow?\n. I bolded it and brightened up the text a bit on https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/Installation - does this help?\n. I also brightened it and made it a bit clearer on http://chocolatey.org. If you have other ideas into how to relay this a little better, please let me know.\n. Are you seeing this across the board?\n. Does the second window even pop up for you?  Do me a favor and look in C:\\Nuget\\chocolateyInstall for a chocolateyPSInstall.log file. This may help lead us to what is really going on.\n\nFrom what it looks like, it is not finding powershell on your machine to execute. What version of powershell do you have installed?\n. sounds like we need to specify the full path to powershell and possibly make it configurable?\n. https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/23\n. Strange... perhaps we should investigate using just lowercase in the code base?  Although this sounds a bit deeper of an issue if you need to rename items to get them to run.\n. Fixing this could get very interesting...since it extends to packages themselves as well. :(\n. I am about to check in some code that may fix this issue. Can you do a build from source, install and test for me?\n. Fixed in bd850d80ef4e4a173dabe00aa61a8680bf44cc60 \n\nUnless of course you find it didn't work.\n. The culture was set to InvariantCulture at run time to help eliminate issues like this.\n. Fixed in 3bb2cf9657255038c5ea81bcb03a630a1b198591\n. I merged in the first commit. After our discussion on the second one, I gave you something else. In the source you will now see a setup.cmd. It will set up things you need to hack on the source. :D\n. Merged in 42bf8359c6dca1fba3df65de9144150d4cf2c264\n. For future readers: This is a fix for getting modules. Powershell 3.0 gets stricter on how you can get these items. This fixes an issue with write-host and write-error overrides that happens in the next version of powershell (3.0).\n. If something never asserts admin privileges it is possible that there may not be any window pop ups (unzips will still pop a window)\n. Fixed in 3bb2cf9657255038c5ea81bcb03a630a1b198591\n. Fixed in 3471a3bb1a48255ed2d0cfad2d053a415595ffdc\n. Not seeing this issue, I think it might be coming up due to $pwd\n. No, that is still working... I am slightly perplexed..\n. I put a space in the path I was installing from and it blew up nuget install due to me not catching for spaces in paths to install from, only to.  \n. what version are you putting on ahk?\n. what if I told you this thing absolutely worked for me? \n. I did the same steps as you, put it all in the same directory and called the stuff. Worked fine. \n\nOnly difference I can think of offhand is that my choco install directory does not have spaces in it.\n. I also attempted installing with nuget to a directory with spaces and nuget worked fine.  I would need to change my choco install directory to completely test what you are doing... \n. Try this, in your chocolatey lib directory, delete anything to do with windowpad that you may have there. When the item is already downloaded, nuget will not make an attempt to re-download it. This can cause issues.\n. I actually did it with a space as well and it worked. What you need to do is -source \"D:\\users\\Anthony Mastrean\\Dropbox\\Projects\" and it should work. That's pretty much an expectation though when you have spaces.\n. When you quote the path with spaces, does it work?\n. Closing this guy. Do we want to file a new issue for the spaces?\n. Fixed in 2451ebc2dc72b97752ad6bd823a37185441c4039\n. For list you just type `clist -source webpi` (and you already need to have webpi.commandline installed for it to work.)\n. `chocolatey webpi packageName` `cwebpi packageName` or `cinst packageName -source webpi`\n. the list command issue is here: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/37\n. Fixed in 2451ebc2dc72b97752ad6bd823a37185441c4039\n. `Chocolatey gem packageName` , `cgem packageName` or `cinst packageName -source ruby`  \nDoes not require ruby gems to be installed prior to running this command.\n. This seems reasonable enough to accomplish.\n. Fixed in revision e5006cd77fa42f3805626d656f98e5af08fbf64e\n. I like it.\n. I would totally dig a pull request here ;)\n. This has been completed in https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/43\n. For notes of others, this packages.config differs a little from a vanilla nuget's packages.config in that it adds a source element. For example:\n\n``` xml\n<packages>\n    <package id=\"somepackage\"   />\n    <package id=\"somepackagewithversion\" version=\"1.0\"  />\n    <package id=\"somepackagewithsource\" version=\"1.0\" source=\"http://myget.org/f/customfeed\" />\n    <package id=\"IISExpress\" source=\"webpi\" />\n</packages>\n```\n. That is an interesting idea. You want to log a new issue for it (or would you like me to)? I'm curious in how we could get the items that are from different sources... and also how to account for items that never end up in lib (ruby gems and WebPI items)\n. This has been moved to https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/258\n. Fixed in 244bf4aeef54d8a833069427cc699d262cac830c\n. What version of powershell do you have on your machine?\n. No worries... :D\n. @HKochniss We accept pull requests. :D\n. @HKochniss Alternatively, please file a new issue for us to check the powershell version.  We do have requirements listed, but perhaps it would be better to also have that in the installer script.\n. Because I'm too lazy to type nuget pack \n.

Fixed in 951d47b27743fbefb976e1093d95fc3a5e95a571\n. Pretty neat. Works with directories as well.\n. Fixed in 3570d7bac2e695d139c5569b4b3737ffa8cbce59\n. In this case we don't limit at all, but have also removed the usage of nuget.org/chocolatey.org b/c that would be insane... :D\n. This is the test feed I used: www.myget.org/F/chocoinstallall/\n\nAnd for directories, I just put packages in a directory and called the same thing.\n. Well, shoot, I am going to write some tests for it, but it appears to work. I think it will fall in with -force, and the rename of the folder to c:\\chocolatey instead of c:\\nuget.\n. Fixed in 3570d7bac2e695d139c5569b4b3737ffa8cbce59\n. Fixed in 1b823d5eeae51ab19a757ef80a9bc7585ad5aa1b\n. This sounds pretty doable. :D\n. Fixed in e09a0e1a871708cdf90cd1d082b8ca71b7d9226d\n. Still thinking about whether nuget.exe will continue to be part of chocolatey's package or not. It is an artifact of necessity at the current time.\n. Consider the nuget.exe inside of chocolatey as an internal item to chocolatey's execution. It could go away at some point so linking it now would create later pains.  \n\nIf you want nuget on the path then install nuget.commandline. :D\n. Fixed in c0cb47a9c4e0e8fc27d0b95e0e97c7cf2599e463\n. This shouldn't be too hard,  I just did something similar for the cinst all command\n. Fixed in 59e71754bb726bddec5ee6dd601ac414c5ff2471\n. Does it break anything or is it only during the upgrade?\n. It might be some remnants of having a preview version installed that may have had issues? I honestly only saw that while I was working on the feature. \n. It's in the chocolatey.cmd file and inside the chocolatey.ps1 file. Solves an issue with the Turkish \"I\" which was making it impossible to use chocolatey.\n. closing unless there is anything left to discuss\n. unintended side effect of still running the old code during the install of chocolatey.\n. Thoughts?\n. It's written out in the Generate-BinFile method. In 0.9.8.13 it writes them in a more portable manner. However during the upgrade, the nuget.bat file is generated using the 0.9.8.12 code.\n. Nuget.exe will not be linked in vNext\n. Undocumented feature this release but fixed in fc768d4b097e97d243e661e654588431d183c50b\n. Undocumented meaning dark feature, subject to change.\n. Nuget.CommandLine - it's been there since the beginning. Bad name (on nuget.org)\n. Fixed in 9c73f18beb0ed6cb6aee38b09479507d73877240\n. Apparently there is a second one with the same name: http://win-get.sourceforge.net\n. Sounds like we just need to not work with any packages ending in .config. Do you think that would be agreeable? Or if we don't find a file named something.config we try looking at it as a package name instead.\n. Oh, sorry, I already fixed the issue using EndsWith(). But then I thought about it some more and we shouldn't restrict a package name ending in .config or cause confusion if someone has one named as such.\n. Fixed in 6d2c54f6d290088cb622ded3560476a61b03db24\n. Here https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CommandsInstall - probably could draw out the packages.config to it's own wiki page though.\n. Fixed in 3c7701e49b8d912aee52d911c4c16d3f4873605a\n. Fixed in 6d56726e9aca6818d3fc9810d943d16eff6a4c14\n. interesting that you would use BITS...\n. Maybe choco should use Curl - how does it do with proxies?\n. This is in 97b94b2d7d5874da2e94bad693b3e8c51a146b64 and 5a9d3968042cdacfdfce62f05e0108a772c5019e. This closes #297\n. Fixed in 7aac8983c358bf4e0dcccaa6465b567628063480\n. Noticed a couple of things here. \n\nWindows XP would no longer be supported.\nAdmin privileges are required - one of the tenants of choco is to run on systems w/out admin. And it does as long as you stay way from admin packages.\nHow does this work with tools that have required dlls or configs sitting next to them ?\n\nWe talked about generating batches differently for gui files. While this would be awesome and a very clean way of doing this, I can't limit choco down to only admin users on greater than xp.\notherwise I would kick up choco in admin mode.\n\nPerhaps this is a \"mode\" we can support later for those that will be running as admins.\n. Tried with nant - couldn't load log4net. Boo.\n. you can put the symlinks under a user profile? Chocolatey installs under user environment settings since 0.9.8.7.\n. Agreed.\n. your link didn't work.\n. I think this may be duplicated by some other issues...\n. Is this still an issue? \n. The nuget.exe file inside of chocolatey isn't meant for public usage. Once we get in a feature to ignore exes, that will be one of the first on the list.\n. Fixed in b18b0819b3f67b06ca47cef7745d7d2f2dd1d12c\n. Fixed in 4aeea37b2a91ccaf279c6c34bef136b4c812edc9\n. Open PowerShell as an administrator. \n. calling this good to go...\n. Freakin awesome idea. :D\n. @jasondenizac It's fine to put issues on NuGet gallery, but keep in mind that Chocolatey and chocolatey.org are separate projects. Having the nuget gallery add it would be awesome, but sometimes things are quicker to get added to chocolatey.org and pointed to later. See this PR: https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/525\n. It's coming hopefully with next release. I was just thinking of this\nenhancement this morning.\n\nOn Monday, May 20, 2013, Phil Baines wrote:\n\n> @gep13 https://github.com/gep13 Thanks!\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/67#issuecomment-18153324\n> .\n\n## \n\n---\n\nRob\n\"Be passionate in all you do\"\n\nhttp://devlicio.us/blogs/rob_reynolds\nhttp://ferventcoder.com\nhttp://twitter.com/ferventcoder\n. no updates yet, but it will be automatic without a save flag.

I will get that fixed. \n. okay, give it it a whirl now. \n. Awesome. With ruby.devkit you should not need to restart. It should start from nothing and hook it all the way up.\n. After the install you would need to restart the console though :D\n. This should be fixed now.\n. Actually people have reported that this is true just the way it is now. Can you verify?\n. Awesome.

Freaking droid web browser i'm on right now is a pos when it comes to editing. It doesn't go to where you point and it's impossible to navigate by keys\n. By the way, this is a dark feature right now since 0.9.8.15: if you have bobBob.exe in a folder, you can place a file named bobBob.exe.gui right next to it and chocolatey will set it up as a gui app instead.\n. This is now documented in https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages\n. Unfortunately building is not in the vision of chocolatey. Library packages are not out of the realm of chocolatey's vision, but pretty darn close.\n\nThis is where apt and chocolatey diverge. Chocolatey does not do source packages. CoApp on the other hand is up and coming for exactly this idea. https://github.com/coapp \n\nMore details here: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/ChocolateyFAQs\n\nThank you for asking.\n\nBy the way, nuget is looking to add support for C++ - http://nuget.codeplex.com/discussions/280649\n. Closing this for now pending any further discussion....\n. This shouldn't be too hard. Likely it will be pulled into the next version. :D\n. Great... :( Thanks for reporting this. \n. It seems that other folks are reporting this issue as well. For now try adding source=\"http://chocolatey.org/api/v2/\" />\n. Fixed in dc736b5c9d6bb99c64b0841ae6bf0a8eec6389b8\n. slap the source into it for now... It's the source that is the issue\n. Thanks. This definitely appears to be a bug...\n. Fixed in d34231feb682e834f7d8b404e6e0bfc4487ebcf8\n. By the way, what is the actual value of the environment variable on the machine? Closing and reopening powershell and calling this might be sufficient to get the machine value.\n. The error at the end is the changeover of chocolatey to a new folder and it having issues updating the powershell session's path.\n. Close, reopen powershell.\n. https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/80 - already fixed the issue. It's related only to the instance you are in...\n. Good, job? ;)\n. @krivan you can already starting hosting your own private repositories now. The one trick around this at the moment is that you would have to host both the public package and your private one on the private repository\n. This now works thanks to @LucidSage's work. :D\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/101\n. And you don't even need to have the dependent packages on the same feed.\n. @MarkJohnson1974 I've added a new issue to capture the additional differences - https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/105\n. Apparently you can already do this - `cinst blah -source \"\"source1;source2\"\"` (note the double quotes)\n. @MarkJohnson1974 UNC paths should work - if you quote for spaces, make sure you double quote.\n. Awesome! It's likely we'll have a configuration at some point to ease all pain in proxy issues, since they all like to work differently... \n. Until then I don't have a problem setting this one up.\n. Fixed in bd3eefefc440d821b6a97abd1381fe64d7b176a6\n\nFull disclosure, moving stuff around so I just pulled it in like a patch.\n. In the next couple of weeks I am looking at a release. Got one more bug to fix and hopefully some pull requests to bring in. :D\n. The beta is out, unfortunately you will have to do a little bit of manual work to install it (the new version will handle prereleases, 0.9.8.16 doesn't) - \n\nGo to https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/Installation\nand use the NuGet.exe + PowerShell Method (very bottom) - you can use chocolatey to pull it down but you will still need to dive into the installation folder to run the install script manually.\n. Hmmm - just make sure you don't have a Help.ps1 and an Install-All.ps1 in the functions folder anymore (two files that were in 0.9.8.16 were renamed to include \"Chocolatey-\" on the front).\n. Oh right - to do the nuget method you would have to say `nuget install chocolatey -pre`\n. fixed in 2eec8417032c706075c7b872f926411129ac8530\n. Fixed in 2eec8417032c706075c7b872f926411129ac8530\n. You are close - step #3 is just the verbose output coming back from NuGet. It is not considered installed by chocolatey until finished and the message comes out.\n. But I do agree - chocolatey needs that last step to say - \"Yes, this was successful\" \n. This is related to https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/10\n. Chocolatey != 1.0 fellas. Expect some rough edges that need to be smoothed out. :) \n\nThis is one of those. \nMy preference is to mark as broken so someone can inspect what went wrong. (and move it to a particular folder that contains broken packages)\n. Still stewing on this one... leaning towards good.\n. This is going to be done with a configuration - you will need to enable it on the configuration. I will push that up and then you can set the command if you like\n. The default is to NOT use the nuget config. If you want to use it, you will have to set a user configuration telling it to. Does that sound fair?\n. I'm pushing the config file in master, if you want to take a look at that and reissue a pull request (that way you get your name on the work). Use a different branch than master please. Thanks.\n. Closing this one...waiting on the other. Let me know if you want it (I can reimplement if not)\n. Great! There is github for windows that helps when learning git. I'm releasing chocolatey this week so if you want to get in on that try to get it to me today or tomorrow. If not, it can just roll into the next release. :D\n. Hopefully addressing this in 0.9.8.17. It doesn't find the right folder when looking for one with prerelease bits on it...\n. Just fixed the cup side of the house (https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/90) and I should get to this sometime this week.\n. I believe this is fixed. I could not reproduce this with the latest code...that should be out in beta form in the next day or so\n. Nice...not everyone installs chocolatey to C:\\chocolatey though\n. You can actually pre set the chocolateyinstall variable to point it somewhere else. But in this case it would capture 90% of the first hits.\n\nIf you are in powershell, it is already set at first initialization (it's just wrong for some reason - it was fixed in the source and will go out on the next release)\n. I think I might go ahead and add this to the code... thanks for this\n. Thanks...I will take a look at this.\n. Fixed in ab24dda6aa0596d31f78f0d21357b80de2056bc1 - out with 0.9.8.17 release\n. You had multiple folders with 0.1.0 of sake in your folder structure, even though they were different prerelease versions. \n\nChocolatey had not yet made it to handling prerelease folders, but it will in 0.9.8.17 (next release). It errorred trying to add more than one item to the found packages dictionary. The fix is in with specs (https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/commit/80df71b6f2bbecc4ec0f01539050cc966641dec9#L3R71).\n. Thanks...I will look at implementing tests for this unless you want to\n. We use Pester - the testing aspect is not exactly straightforward. But we have really good examples in the tests folder. If you follow that down to unit you will see an example of some tests. https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/tree/master/tests/unit\n\nIf you come up a folder you will notice another folder named functions (which really should be named mocks). https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/tree/master/tests/functions\n\nThe mock may already be setup correctly. Most tests in the system (there are not a ton yet, I'm new to powershell testing as well!) are unit and not integration tests. Which means you test by what you expect from different functions.\n\nI did a recent presentation on powershell testing which may give you some pointers into this area: https://github.com/ferventcoder/presentations/tree/master/dotNet/powershellbdd\n. I have it in mind to make changes to Pester to autogenerate the mocks and variables. Although I haven't yet made much progress (priority over time) yet.\n\nScott is on board with the idea so it should be pretty easy to get into Pester once completed.\n. looks like it missed this commit - 3c27cb91bfbc6e44293eef3629cf94200f60a768\n. Not too bad. You went to the level to add the mock in. Almost there for specs.\n. files are in. Freakin awesome. Thanks!\n. Found an annoying issue with UAC - it's fixed now but can you confirm that cygwin runner (not the installation of cygwin) requires administrative access?\n. It was not an issue with your code, but rather how Start-Process -Wait misbehaves when you use -Verb \"RunAs\" and UAC is on. Take a look at this: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/commit/27d9288a30e19b1511006051920b0d0da1f3b367\n. the bug was there all along for Chocolatey-WebPI. I just fixed it for both files\n. That question only answers the installer - not the question I have which is when it runs to download and install packages. Which by the way is freakin awesome. \n. Usually I do as well - UAC is annoying to me. But chocolatey must support it.\n. Awesome. :D\n. Not a problem. About to put out a beta. The best thanks you can give me is finishing the puppet provider. :D\n. I think msiexec already uses start process -wait :D\n. This is a good start. Very highly appreciated!!!\n. We'll have to figure out the uninstall path (I was thinking hints to program files locations [x86 versus not] for the longest time) for the most common scenarios.\n. This is in. Please delete your branch and pull from there to work on additional pieces...\n. Yeah. A whole bunch of helpers for uninstall would be good. Let's see how much choco itself can do without helpers in a parallel track. I'd like to pick this back up once the posh runner uses runspaces.\n. used to be a big file that was broken out. Not sure what you are asking.\n. 0.9.8.16 is still a big file, not broken out.\n. Delete the versioned chocolatey folder from chocolatey\\lib and then from the _packaged_output folder call cinst chocolatey -source %cd%\n. I like how you send me a pull request. DO NOT ACCEPT. lol\n. We can drop it in the package folder to a known file. If it is there we don't really even need a chocolatey uninstall file. :D\n. Shouldn't an uninstall handle the stopping of services/etc? I know that it doesn't always but one would think it should. Pre-uninstall. :D The uninstall before the uninstall. ;)\n. I'd say this is pretty close. Only thing I might do is drop this file in the package directory itself (the versioned one). That way if I have side by side installations I can uninstall them separately if I want. If I understand right, the code changes for each install.\n. Awesome! \n. @tyrken @rismoney auto-uninstall has always been the idea so that an uninstall script would not be necessary with certain installer.\n. Fixed in e5d8eec65ee90b94ad2188d06675b23d4b9d9abc\n. This uses the older easy_install as opposed to pip. http://stackoverflow.com/a/3224103/18475\n. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4750806/how-to-install-pip-on-windows\n. It's so much cleaner than all of that stuff I was doing... :D\n. This is in. Thanks!\n. This is in...thanks man\n. Good thing that is only in the beta. Thanks... Let's get that fixed before release\n. I can take it or you can... seems pretty straightforward.\n. Fixed with PR https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/104\n. Awesome....\n. package availability. Nuget.exe handles all of this on the back end, you just need to send it the right arguments. :D\n. Ha! Just realized through @LucidSage 's commit that you can already do this - `cinst blah -source \"\"source1;source2\"\"` (note the double quotes)\n. https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages\n. These are only the files in the package folder. It's extremely convenient when you have a whole set of executables you want created, which is more often the case in my experience.  \n\nCurious why you more executables in your package folder that you don't want added as redirects versus the ones that you do. Are the others temporary? If so maybe it is better to use a temporary folder and clean it up when you are done using it in chocolateyInstall.ps1.\n\nCan you give me an example @u9520107?\n. It looks like you may have overwritten your repository unintentionally.\n. Looks good, only issue I run into is that you need double quotes around the values since powershell strips them off as it comes in\n. I also noticed that chocolatey already supports multiple sources if you just cinst blah -source \"\"source1;source2\"\" right now...\n. It might be that when it passes it to nuget.exe it is stripping off the quotes (appears that way from your pull request).\n. Thanks! I'm a little lost on when you would reuse the same download for install. The only time that most folks would reuse the file is when there was an issue with the install (usually only helpful while building/testing a package).   \n\nIt brings up questions like  \n1. What if the installer file is corrupted (or for some reason unusable)?\n2. What if the remote file doesn't have different versions? \n.  1 - I like where you are going with that. The head request though, how well does it work with redirects that need cookies? I would prefer that over making pkg authors figure out the MD5 (especially for applications that always have the same url for every version).\n\n 2 - We can communicate information to the helpers - I prefer not making the author pass more information to the helpers when we can easily get the information to the helper through an environment variable.\n\nOne of the biggest benefits of chocolatey is the ease of creating/maintaining packages. We want that to be as straightforward as possible.\n. It's called a redirect loop.\nDownload anything from sourceforge and you will see why a need for cookies on a redirect. Here is the code with a reference https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/helpers/functions/Get-WebFile.ps1#L43-44\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/518181/too-many-automatic-redirections-were-attempted-error-message-when-using-a-http\n. :D\n. I do think this is going to be pulled in...in one form or another.\n. @rismoney agreed.\n. Unless we can guarantee that folks are doing the updates against latest chocolatey code correctly,  I'm not sure we should be advising they do. To do it correctly, they essentially have to do a force push to overwrite history on github and that essentially scares folks.\n. Gary, \n I think it's something we can add as a wiki/markdown file for contributors.\n. Folks, I think I'm implementing the idea of this, but not in the way this pull request was done. Closing this as not fixing.\n. Yep, #428 will be closed in a few.\n. @LucidSage - This is great! I think though that we may want to talk more at length about setting config values. Do you want to start a discussion on the forum?\n\nThings to think about -  \n1. right now when I update chocolatey the global config will be overwritten. Not sure people would like this behavior.\n2. I think I would like the command for changing configuration values to be `chocolatey config` as in chocolatey config _configValue_ [add|remove _values_]. If there is not an add or remove, it will display the current value. And if it's a list it should display all of the values.\n. As I've thought about this more and more, I think I want to move forward with this one. :D\n. Oh right on. I should have came in an looked to see if you had additional messages prior to troubleshooting.... :D\n. Probably a network hiccup.\n. I get that at the end as well. \n. I ran chocolatey afterwards with -debug and things look good. \n. Might be a fluke of some sort in the installer files\n. Could have been worse - https://gist.github.com/2420a607be697debaa44 - DOH!\n. Fixed in f612e17d6339406a829fad2499355b3272d70148\n. So I can close this one because I pulled in the other?\n. What is the original PR for specific folder capability?\n. This is in.\n. Packages for extensions would be named something.extension to make them discoverable. We might want to enforce the convention by only calling the extensions installer if the package name ends in \".extension\"\n. The folder: we could name the folder modules. I think extensions explains the purpose better.\n. Fixed in 0cec008dcd3ca23061740dff7c1bd44f562a9364\n. psm1 - IIS helper may be one. To do something like that we could push the extensions to the admin calls as well if they exist. Then you can take a dependency on the extension - wow this could get really interesting (and confusing).\n\nThis is really an opportunity to see where folks want to take chocolatey and to see what extensions we would bring into the core product. It would also allow folks to add new commands to chocolatey (still working on that one though)\n. I want an IIS helper in the core product - I think we are missing out on many pkg opportunities since the product itself is a website.\n. There are folks out there smarter and better than us and I want to be able to add them into the chocolatey equation. :D\n. Reason for psm1 over ps1, you may have some ps1 functions you want to keep internal so the psm1 serves as the methods you want to expose.\n. Fixed in afd98764188af090e6b3f8569696e37aaa81e47a\n. Thanks! I will be pulling this in this week and pushing out a new version.\n. Might have missed something in there with python. Ruby I converted back to not using the config file or external process.\n. Thanks for reporting this...\n. Per chance does your chocolatey path have spaces in it?\n. Fixed in 8743e1ca28a572c651e4464a2037047924b9b7a3\n. I found that the easy.install nuget package (I don't own is a little wonky). It may take a couple of tries to get it to work right.\n. Why closed?\n. Great question, but one for @rismoney \n. Cver serves the purpose of finding what the local package is on based on the remote package. Cup uses cver.\n\nBut I think I understand what you are saying... calling it to just query the local versions.\n. When I need to use switches, I don't pass them as parameters but I set them globally. That seems to work in PowerShell versus passing them.\n. and I thought about the last night. I think it should be renamed to localonly so if the switch exists then we only look locally.

Will be later this week or next week before I get to the pull requests. :D\n. I take it the local only meets your needs. If so, please close this issue.\n. It might be better in the upcoming release... I think that is what @rismoney was saying. Thanks for the suggestion. \n. The ChocolateyInstall variable lets you install it where ever you want. https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/Installation\n\nChocolatey installs to the root of the system drive which just happens to be C on most machines by default. Curiosity on why this is not clean? \n\nIt depends on your definition of warning, but it clearly logs out where it is installing to during the installation: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/nuget/tools/chocolateysetup.psm1#L159\n\nA prompt stops execution and waits on user input. This goes against the ideas behind chocolatey, which is unattended installs, even of itself. The upgrade process of chocolatey uses chocolatey and that would result in a 'cup all' execution stopping, which might upset folks who want the whole thing to just happen silently in the background. \n\nFor the folks who want more power over their experience, that is why we provide you the ability to change your conventions and pass in Install Arguments for packages (https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CommandsInstall). \n. Ruby, Python, PHP, CygWin, PostgreSQL, etc, also install to the root of the system drive as a default. I'm never sure why some folks feel the program files is more clean (not saying this is where you suggested, just that other folks have). \n\nTo me if something goes to the program files it also goes to the registry as an installed application, one that can be uninstalled from programs list in the control panel. To me having things in there that are not controlled through the system install registry is not clean so I wouldn't see chocolatey there.\n\nThe other location, User Path (C:\\Users\\username and C:\\Documents and Settings\\username) to me starts to scare me based on the character limit in batch based redirects (not sure if it used to be 255 character path length or not). I don't want to get into cases where we go \"C:\\Documents And Settings\\ALongUserNameCuzICanUse32Chars\\Chocolatey\\lib\" (which is already over 70 characters) before we get to the actual folder. Plus I don't know about you, but if I need to break into the lib folder for some reason, that's a lot of folder navigation. It's already bad enough I have to go 3 folders deep, I get irritated when I have to drop 5 folders just to get to something useful. Not that I always use folder navigation starting with computer.\n\nSo to me, and you don't have to agree, the systemroot is much cleaner. And for those that don't agree, that's why we provide a means to install to some other directory.\n\nThoughts?\n. I also don't feel this way about everything. Somethings I would rather see in a subfolder. I'm not even really sure what and when I want to see things in systemroot versus a subfolder like c:\\tools (where I put many useful tools I find).\n\n I reserve the right to contradict myself. ;) (quote originated from Oren Eine)\n. It's all good. We can agree to disagree on this one.\n\nOne thing I also didn't mention is the low privilege install aspect of chocolatey (another reason we shy away from Program Files). Non administrators can install chocolatey (through one of the methods, not sure if the default will work) and be able to run chocolatey for non-administrative installs of applications (aka what chocolatey calls tools).  I'm not sure if you've checked, but Program Files requires higher privileges than the Users group to be able to write to the folder (at least on Windows 7, I didn't check all the others).\n. Guess I didn't have a wiki page up yet: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/Uninstallation\n. We could provide a version of chocolatey that would \"install\" to the system meaning program files and the install registry. Would always run under administrative rights and other things... of course this version would likely cost money since it would be for commercial/enterprise uses.  \n\nI did my time with massive scale enterprise applications. I am very familiar with SOx and many of the good things developers should do (like principle of least privilege)...  \n\nChocolatey is free, OSS and meant for consumer purposes in it's current existence. It's not perfect, but it is also not v1 either. And even when it is I wouldn't expect perfection. Perfect software has problems shipping. ;)\n. Based on the following, where would you install chocolatey (some repetition from this discussion)? https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/DefaultChocolateyInstallReasoning\n\nI am really curious, I am not trying to be facetious. I welcome healthy discussion (including healthy arguments). :)\n. Yep, we make use of that in some places. :D\n. Closing this for now pending further discussion.\n. That's definitely not right. Can you list whatyou've  installed thus far?\n\nOn Tuesday, October 22, 2013, Nathanael Jones wrote:\n\n> Is every chocolatey application supposed to install in C:\\ as well?

I will take a look this weekend hopefully :D\n. Since I pulled in the other it's reasonable that this can be closed. Thanks for the contribution though!\n. The only thing I think would be acceptable is to pass those items through the command line and have them passed as header values when making the request (if they are there).\n\nThat would get you into the src/helpers/Get-WebFile.ps1 (I think it is called)\n. Short answer: I'd like to stay away from storing sensitive information in a file with chocolatey (at least for now). \n\ntl;dr\n\nThere is a config file, but I don't want passwords in a file. Some folks put chocolatey in a dropbox folder so they can move it easily between computers. I don't quite agree with this b/c it gets things out of sync (what do you really have natively installed on this computer?) and can cause confusion when updating all of your packages. Some folks like it though. While I don't agree with it/support it, I don't want to introduce changes to chocolatey that limit their ability to do so. If we had some kind of encrypted string in a file it may not translate between computers (depending on the algorithm used). In the past (in other projects) we've used X509 certificates to get a good algorithm between machines. I don't want to take chocolatey in this direction of complexity (using certificates) unless it is absolutely required (read: it's probably not).\n\nI could be wrong, but the way you save secure string to a file is still machine specific (http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/csharpgeneral/thread/d4557d9b-6e7d-4695-bfd0-a22a08e06160/ | http://stackoverflow.com/a/6982430/18475). To save the securestring to a file you would use some algorithm which usually ties you to the machine (or store the IV you would need somewhere, which still gets us into the same issue if we want to store that with chocolatey's directory). Or use X509 certificates, which opens up even more complexity than the other methods (how to install, where to install, what about permissions to the private key, how to sync between machines, etc).\n\nOne of Chocolatey's tenants is simplicity. Note that simplicity is not the opposite of complex, only the opposite of complicated. I don't want a complicated experience for users. So whatever answer we come up with, it should not impact the user experience in a detrimental way.\n. With choco.exe, this is already resolved. This closes when we switch in the new repository.\n. @skyguy94 \n\n> I'm not certain I get the argument here. If my summary is correct, then Chocolatey complicates behavior by breaking a NuGet feature.\n\nChocolatey != NuGet\n\nYou are also treading on a 2 year old comment. ;)\n. Chocolatey uses the NuGet packaging infrastructure. \n\nPer the comments on active/unresolved: This is unresolved in current releases of choco b/c the code to do so could have been very painful in POSH, and we've been holding off on some things we knew were painful until the rewrite. Although this is an issues list, some things are enhancements (although this one is not marked as one though...) :/.\n\nThis has sat because we didn't have a good solution at the time. Apologies, hopefully many of the current issues will be cleaned up.\n. @codearoo clarification - choco.exe uses `nuget.core.dll`, not `nuget.exe`.\n. All nuget packages will continue to work. That would be unwise of us without a long term deprecation. I would assume that we tend to handle compatibility well on the team and deprecations. But with your concern, maybe that is not the case? \n. The installation instructions also say you do this from a command line (cmd.exe) and not a powershell prompt. Were you getting these errors from the command line?\n. perfect :D\n. Original discussion here: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/124\n. Multiple reasons:\n1. Once you have a pull request out from master you cannot do anything additional or it will affect the pull request\n2. You really can't have multiple pull requests at the same time.\n3. It's not as easy for me to see the straight line from where you made changes IF you update your master with my latest changes.\n4. Following the above, it messes up the nice straight line for git history if you update the master with my latest changes when I go to pull them in.\n. If you take a look at the history of chocolatey (gitk from the command line or if you have gitextensions installed you can see it as well)\n. Do you want to see if https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/119 meets your needs?\n. The tool that chocolatey uses for downloads doesn't appear to allow me to do this, but we can keep chocolatey from trying to do anything further with the packages once they are there.\n. I like where you are going. Install and update both ignore dependencies... the trick is how do you get cup all to work correctly...? I'm thinking if someone puts in ignore dependencies and those dependencies are installed, we want to go ahead and clean them up right then during install (or update). If they are already there we just move on.\n. Well that is interesting. If you installed ruby and then called for devkit it should not have....oooohhhhh, freaking nuget algorithm with dependencies. It still should not have installed another version of ruby with an existing one there. We will be upgrading the nuget client once we get a fix released from a bug report I filed a couple weeks ago (the fix is in the code base now, just waiting on the out of band release).\n. My take is we allow someone to pass the switch. In the documentation we say results are not guaranteed. If someone complains, we say it's a sharp tool that won't constrain you but you better understand what you are doing or it will cut you.\n\nThat's the way I like tools to be. Allow folks to take off all of the safety guards if they need to.\n. It should not have upgraded a dependency that was already met.\n. It should be in the prerelease.\n\nOn Monday, September 30, 2013, jamescrowley wrote:\n\n> Is this available at the moment?

This is fixed...\n. I could always add a link. Please add this an an issue on http://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org/\n. As much as possible I would like to avoid something powershell from the command line. The inner guts of chocolatey are powershell, but the way folks use it from the outside doesn't have to be. \n. Ha! I actually typed out the word \"powershell-y\" but then removed it. :D\n\nYou can access that within the ps1 (it's gets set as an environment variable), but are you worried about it moving on to the installer?\n. More information on how it is used: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/helpers/functions/Install-ChocolateyInstallPackage.ps1#L51-53\n. `$env:chocolateyInstallArguments`\n\nDo you think this might be better as an addition to https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/helpers/functions/Install-ChocolateyZipPackage.ps1\n. Like we'd leave it as `installarguments` but allow the settings to override defaults in chocolatey zip package function?\n. I'm closing this as a dupe of #159 - that's where the work was done. Use -params \n. @alyssenko-ssi An environment variable for Install Arguments was implemented. However it should not be looked at all for packages. If you need information from the user, one should be using `$env:chocolateyPackageParameters`, see #159. \n. WHAT?! That's awesome. \n. The initial workings for this are in b87541a5fe5ec04c4a29846c761e528f9070b3b3 - we'll see what other things crop up.\n. @ForNeVeR We already have the powershell refresh in and once the commands become aliases back to the module methods, you will see this happen automatically as there will be no call out to a batch and then back into powershell.\n. Fixed in a09e15896fbc5e790b17b6699cd6b50bc7eb14e4\n. The current state is that unless you import the chocolateyinstaller module, you won't automatically get path updates. Importing the module isn't recommended at this time but some folks are experimenting with it.\n\nWith cmd.exe you can just call RefreshEnv after an install that would update something in your environment and it will update your session's environment.\n. system vars require admin - that's why the default goes to user. \n\nTo go to system, it would just take adding them manually and applying this fix for now.\n\nI think in the future we could make the installer smarter.\n. Weird. Interesting. It might be a bug somewhere in chocolatey's installer script.\n. I would be fine with more named parameters in there. \n\nKeep in mind that whatever is done, it should work without the supplied parameters or property files.\n. Think I'm getting ready to pull this in. We'll also be rewriting this to make it a ton cleaner as well.\n. This being the installer, not your code. :)\n. Definitely want to get this into .21\n. I don't think is necessary now. 0.9.8.24 had some major improvements to how it handles environment variables during install. \n\nThis is superseded by #453 which was later superseded by #486.\n. I have two pull requests for FTP support. Probably time to start a document on \"So you want to contribute?\"\n. I like this...quite a bit. Whatever you do though, don't update your repository with my latest changes. I think that document for contributions is going to get written soon. \n\nWe usually want people to contribute pull requests from a branch that is not master. That allows you to contribute multiple patches that way and doesn't get us into where we need to cherry pick your commits to keep the history in a nice straight line. \n. we'll be pulling it in soon.\n. This is in...thanks for the contribution!\n. This won't work of course until we release the next version of chocolatey (0.9.8.20), but that should be by the end of the month.\n\nYou can download and play with a prerelease version now.\n. This goes out into full release in a couple of days. So many new things being added. :D\n. grats for the update. Gonna try to get this in this weekend.\n. This is in... thanks! \n. Looks like this may have messed something up with the get config values...\n. Nevermind, this was my bad... \n. Thanks. Not sure why I didn't get an email on this...\n. I think this is still valid.\n. I also have one in email from someone on this as well.\n. This only happens on the session (or existing sessions) that you do the install from, correct?\n. Once you close and open a new powershell session, this works appropriately, correct?\n. Or you actually checked the environment path and it wasn't there and then added that to your session?\n. Last time I checked that only updates your current session, not the path variables stored on your machine.\n. I'm referring to opening control panel, system, advanced, variables and the PATH variables in there. There is one for user and one for system. Just b/c it doesn't end up in your current session (of powershell or cmd) doesn't mean it didn't get added to the actual path.\n\nHere's an experiment: open the system stuff in control panel and then go back to your powershell session and add c:\\bob; to the path the same way you did in powershell. Now look in the actual path to see if it got added. Both places (user and system). Now close and reopen powershell. Write-host your path. Is c:\\bob still there?\n. I think I like that better dropped into a new issue - your fix... please submit as an enhancement.\n. Just FYI - choco 0.9.10 supports this now without closing and reopening your shell - https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/664\n. @acgetchell Can you tell me the output of calling refreshenv? Does it say \"Refreshing for ***cmd.exe***\" or does it say for ***powershell.exe***?  If it says the former, it means you do not have the PowerShell profile installed - which provides this and tab completion.\r\n\r\nSee https://chocolatey.org/docs/troubleshooting#why-does-choco-intab-not-work-for-me on how to remedy this so that when you call refreshenv, it is the PowerShell version that is being called and not refreshenv.bat. . Please see https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/991 and https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/894 to get a better understanding of why this isn't set by default on install.. I also filed https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1392. @acgetchell Looks like an artifact of already having that in the PATH when you ran it the second time. It doesn't show that environment variables like PATH were updated in the output and I don't see a call to refreshenv here.. okay\n. Any chance you get this to me in a branch (not master)? There are two other commits in here that are not related to this pull request.\n\nPlus it helps if you want to send multiple PRs at a time.\n. Sorry for the confusion. Branch on your end and make the changes there. A branch named something like the issue itself. Send the pull request TO master. ;)\n. This looks awesome. Thanks!\n. Awesome. :D\n. Taking a look right now...\n. Ran it with /l*v %cd%\\msi.log and found the issue.  \n\n```\nMSI (s) (D0!FC) [12:12:38:922]: PROPERTY CHANGE: Adding HideFatalErrorForm property. Its value is 'TRUE'.\nThis setup requires the .NET Framework version 2.0.50727.  Please install the .NET Framework and run this setup again.  The .NET Framework can be obtained from the web.  Would you like to do this now?\nCustomAction VSDCA_VsdLaunchConditions returned actual error code 1603 (note this may not be 100% accurate if translation happened inside sandbox)\nAction ended 12:12:38: VSDCA_VsdLaunchConditions. Return value 3.\nAction ended 12:12:38: INSTALL. Return value 3.\n```\n\nI'm thinking Win8 doesn't come with .NET framework 2.0. I believe you can install that right from chocolatey using webpi as a source, but you will need to list out the available packages so you can install it.\n\nOne thing we might think about doing is adding a .net framework 2.0 package so other packages can depend on it. It would work much the same way as .net 4.5, where it only goes to install if it doesn't find the installed registry key it is looking for.\n. Closing as not a chocolatey issue.\n. Thanks, definitely something that can be added.\n\nThe option of adding executable containing folders to the path would add quite a bit of noise to your path depending on how many tools you install.\n. Shimgen has fixed this. \n. Now this is awesome! With tests, that's a plus 1000. :D\n. I think all should do that. It aligns well with other package managers. Just haven't yet gotten to that one.\n.

Thanks! This is probably better to do in general than looking at a file. \n. This is in... thanks!\n. It's the capital \"I\". I thought I had fixed all of those.\n. First fix in 556024f1482370bb3b056276ae08689b3ddcc064\n. Are you still finding issues?\n. I symlink or just run the tests as part of the build. You will need pester installed.\n. Command is a bit harder, but for powershell you suggested the following: \n\n``` powershell\nEnv:PATH = (@(,[Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('PATH', 'Machine') -s\nplit ';') + @([Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('PATH', 'User') -split ';') | Select -Unique) -join ';'\n```\n. https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/134\n. It's in issue #134\n. How do you do a full environment refresh? I would love for that to happen with both powershell and command...\n. Install-ChocolateyPath actually pushes the new path...perhaps we can emulate that a bit.\n. But it won't carry all the way back to the command line. That's what I'm hoping that crazy poshcode will do.\n. Boo...\n. Need both powershell and cmd shell versions... \n\n@mwrock we'd need to iterate over all of them.\n. Command line - (it's ugly) - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/171588/is-there-a-command-to-refresh-environment-variables-from-the-command-prompt-in-w\n. HA! We found the same article!\n. I'm down for it if it works. :D\n. It just show up too many times per package (the errors are displayed more than once sometimes). \n. Same goes for success logging.\n\nAs far as the holding area, yeah, I think we install the packages to a holding area - when they are successful we copy them up (prior to running the exe locator).\n. You can add to the wiki page... please mention the binroot for packages - we have the concept of having some packages install to another directory if someone defines an environment variable.\n. And it should be mentioned that if you want to override the default installation, just add to the installation arguments the correct switch and location for the particular native installer - jhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CommandsInstall \n\nThe important part is that you need to be intimate enough with the package to know this...\n. Lots of questions in here. \n\nI would point to the FAQ question from the create packages page - and maybe put a little blurb that highlights the difference. It is definitely an asked question, and frequently. :)\n\nThere is a push for an Install-ChocolateyTool function - in that function it would look up the binRoot (or whatever we call it once it is in chocolatey).\n\nConsole2 is a tool (no native installer). But there are other ways to get tools - which download the archived version (.zip, .7z, .tar) and then unpack it to somewhere. Lots of these just unpack it into the package folder itself, which allows the executables to be found by chocolatey and put on the path.\n\nAs far as MSIs and native installers - the person who wrote these had in mind a location for the application to install to (in program files). This IMHO should stay the default. I know the argument can be made that there are some packages that don't, but this is due to the littering of the systemdrive with installs. Usually MSIs are easier to work with since 99% of the time they have the same installation switches, one of which is the install location.\n\nThe general idea behind chocolatey is to move to less and less work being required in the chocolateyInstall.ps1. We want to address patterns and make that easier so that one can just call one line functions. You can see there are a lot of packages that already go that route (if they are just pulling in an application). \n. One thing we will likely do in the future is allow folks to pass in the installer type (NSIS, InstallShield, etc). Then we can make assumptions on some of the switches. This is closer to what I saw chef was starting to do in their default provider for windows. I also saw it in another package manager that is now defunct.\n. Is this seriously a behavior in Powershell? That it messes up the PATH user env var if it doesn't exist?! You think it would treat it fine... \n\nThanks for reporting, guess we are going to need to look into it a little more.\n. Fixed by https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/699\n. Implemented in choco.exe as `choco new`.\n. Ha - the don't pull yet is still in the one that is outstanding. :D\n. I'm one of those archaic users that spends more time on the straight command line shell. :( \n. you can just call dir in powershell (although it's an alias of something else now).\n. Maybe that brings up the idea of opening something native to powershell with chocolatey - and installing it to their profile (much like poshgit/hg/whathaveyou do).  It still looks like the native command but it doesn't fall down to the command shell. \n\nAs in Set-Alias cinst Chocolatey-Install (and for all the rest). :D\n. Agreed on what Matt said. And if they haven't, they will find chocolatey fairly useless in powershell as well. :D\n. The real trick is finding the modules since someone can install it to other folders. We could also provide a module that is dot-sourced with all of the commands we want seen.\n. I'd prefer not documenting the conventions on the methods, even though those could be used as well.\n\ncinst (so it's one for both interfaces) references Install-ChocolateyPackage (or something similar if we have a naming conflict).\ncup - Update-ChocolateyPackage\ncver - List-ChocolateyVersion (or something like this)\ncuninst - Uninstall-ChocolateyPackage \n.

This already exists today? installargs - https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CommandsInstall\n\nIs this not the same?\n. Yes. This gives someone direct access to the native installer so they can pass their own arguments and even override the args going to it.  It's really a power user feature b/c it puts you right against the metal.\n. So you could be talking about something slightly different...\n. We've already talked about the -platform x86 switch - I think there is an enhancement listed for that (and if not, let's make sure it gets listed). :D\n. -platform is for the utility function which the package dev has no access to. So the key is completely transparent to them.\n. We need to get this in for the next version. Granted it will be rudimentary, but it is necessary for a recent package issue where the vendor wanted you to pass something or fail the package.\n. How about `choco something -params \"@{bob=1;bill=2}\"`\n. This is very naive as mentioned in the commit (no spaces and must be specified in EXACTLY the format shown).

Well that is easy enough to fix... ;)\n. Here we go `choco something -params 'value1=bob;value2=''with spaces'''` - the two single quotes `value2=''with spaces''` will be converted to `value2=\"with spaces\"`\n. @rismoney @Iristyle Interesting idea proposed by you guys - the chocolateyInstall.ps1 becomes chocolateyRun.ps1 and in it it contains functions that chocolatey will call \n\n``` powershell\nfunction ShouldInstall {}\nfunction InstallSteps {}\nfunction ConfigureSteps {} #optional, in case folks want things installed but not configured.\nfunction UninstallSteps {}\n```\n. I guess the comment here is if I install the package for a pre-existing installation and it doesn't run the install steps, Can I still uninstall the application with chocolatey?\n. See, this is where I disagree. To me this is a nice way of making chocolatey aware of existing apps and taking over the updating of those items.\n\nBut I can see the argument for both ways.  The question is, even with a switch to get both behaviors, what is the default?\n\nBy default now it uninstalls (in the case where ruby 1.87 comes in and you already have 1.87 installed).\n. Second question - \n I have ruby installed but an older version. How far back should the ruby package be looking as acceptable?\n\nIf you have 1.8.7.123 (not sure on the last part of the version, this is an example) and the installer pulls down 1.8.7.124, should it go ahead and upgrade the older version?  Now contrast that with 1.8.7 and 1.9.3? \n\nThere are situations we will run into where an app requires a specific version of a dependency. Consider how that should work as you consider the answer for this. I might have ruby 1.8.7 installed, but the app requires 1.9.3 to be installed. What should happen in this case? \n. Of course, if I have 1.8.7.123 installed and the package that comes down is 1.8.7.123, this is where I want this behavior to not install. \n\nI have to throw out how idempotent is the process right now? Most apps don't f things up when you run the installer multiple times.\n. You said it here and I said it on the issue itself. Ha. :D\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/165#issuecomment-8741741\n. The neat thing here is that what it does now without all of this extra work DOES bring an existing install inline with chocolatey. \n. It's a matter of perception, but I would want chocolatey to take over something I have existing if I issued the request for it to install it.  I mean, after all, don't you think I already know I have git installed when I ask it to install git?\n. ```\nDEBUG: Running 'Get-ConfigValue' with\nconfigValue:'useNuGetForSources'\nDEBUG: Running 'Get-UserConfigValue' with\nconfigValue:'useNuGetForSources'\nDEBUG: After checking the user config the value of\n'useNuGetForSources' is 'false'\nDEBUG: Running 'Get-UserConfigValue' with configValue:'sources'\nDEBUG: Running 'Get-GlobalConfigValue' with configValue:'sources'\nDEBUG: System.Xml.XmlDocument\nDEBUG: chocolatey.sources\nDEBUG: Using '-Source \"\" ' as the source arguments\nDEBUG: Calling NuGet.exe install cygwin -Outputdirectory\n\"C:\\Chocolatey\\lib\" -Source \"\"\n```\n. Okay, so this is my fault. Thought I was correcting something back so that it would work with powershell3...\n. Fixed in 784e45fb3b94e71a2d11b43c6c67c791e2396804\n. This is tagged for the next release... :)\n. Since we have http://chocolatey.org/installabsolutelatest.ps1, is this still important?\n. :D\n. Even better - except in cases where they don't set up the proxy stuff. But we can always do that after the fact. I don't want to give the illusion that we are not going to handle some of that in the back end.\n. I have to say I like @ewilde 's approach. It's closer to what I was initially thinking. I could go both ways though, it just depends on how much work we want to do with each new set of options.\n\nIt's kind of like the argument between primitive parameters versus object parameters. Except in this case both are objects, just one isn't the actual object used.\n\nSomeone could still not use our utility functions if they need more control over that and I think that is a fair trade.\n\nThoughts?\n. This was fixed for choco v0.9.10 - see https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/332\n. With anything like this, we would have a need to support the existing infrastructure while we phase it out, so it would be something that package makers can move to over time.\n\nI know I'm preaching to the choir here but I just wanted to make sure that was understood before any work started.\n. Seems reasonable. If it is local it should just forward it to cver\n. -source local\n\nTHoughts?\n. The trick here is the searching filter...so maybe not the same code. Or is it?\n. Closing this as a duplicate of a newer issue.. .I know.. #276 \n. I'm not sure I like the name of it yet. It really doesn't tell me what it is doing.\n. How does it work with bindir? \n. So I install a tool package - that tool uses bin dir so it installs to something like c:/tools/packagename where it auto adds a that directory to the path. How do I trace that back to the package itself as it wouldn't be as easy to find?\n. I'm not against this, I just want to really understand it better.\n. Ok, right on. I now understand the benefit of this. On board with the idea.\n\nOn Friday, April 19, 2013, Rich Siegel wrote:\n\n> ok - its not perfect implementation (what is?). but here is the usage-\n> \n> I have a file on my system.

Move the idea to choco, not necessarily the PR.\n. Service and web (iis first, apache later) should also become helpers.\n. Had those in mind for awhile.\n. There are a couple of these in here.\n. Thanks - still discussing this in the other issue. :D\n. I don't want them updated. When I roll these in, I branch to a new section, then I back that branch to the parent commit of this. Then I pull the changes. Then I rebase against all of the current. And if all goes well (usually does), I just merge back to master.\n\nIt keeps the commit history a nice straight line. Don't think of commit history so linearly ;)\n. For me, if someone is willing to keep their PR up to date, I'm okay with\nthat (if they do it without creating multiple lines of history).\n\nBut when it takes awhile for a project team to evaluate PRs, it should not\nbe on the person who took the time to create the patch in the first place.\nIt should be the responsibility of the project team. I've submitted PRs\nbefore where this happened a few times. I felt is was kind of against\netiquette of the project team to have an expectation for me to keep up with\nthem when they were taking their time to evaluating my request.\n\nI don't want to create this same feeling on chocolatey as it doesn't really\ncreate a feeling of community. If we wait awhile before evaluating\nrequests, that is on us and we should be feeling a little pain (if there is\nsome) rather than the person who is taking time to contribute to our\nproject.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nOn Friday, April 19, 2013, Rich Siegel wrote:\n\n> your the boss ;) how do you back that branch to the parent commit and then\n> pull the changes.

Need to start looking at this one for the release after this one.\n. Yeah, I was slowly going through and tagging things we want to move. This particular thing is planned as we rewrite the helpers into compiled powershell cmd-lets.\n. This was fixed in choco for 0.9.10 https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/332\n. Before anyone goes down this path, we need to discuss some changes going into chocolatey.org.\n\nI always expect the project site to be the actual project, not a github repo for someone. It should never point back.\n\nSpecifically we are putting together a profile page for package owners where they can list contact information and a few sites including the repository where they keep their packages.\n- https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org/issues/10\n- https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org/issues/11\n\nThere are some other neat things that will be put in (like marking a pkg as outdated, or broken) - https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org/issues/12 \n. @rismoney Not sure what you are trying to say here...\n. I say we close with enhancing chocolatey.org for now.\n. You know discussions are great in the google group. ;)\n. Gaaah, NuGet schema validation decides it is an error and there is no way to tell it otherwise... at least not yet.\n\nThe element 'metadata' in namespace 'http://schemas.microsoft.com/packaging/2010/07/nuspec.xsd' has invalid child element 'packageRepositoryUrl' in namespace 'http://schemas.microsoft.com/packaging/2010/07/nuspec.xsd'. List of possible elements expected: 'frameworkAssemblies, copyright, iconUrl, developmentDependency, dependencies, references, language, requireLicenseAcceptance, licenseUrl' in namespace 'http://schemas.microsoft.com/packaging/2010/07/nuspec.xsd'.\n\nI'm thinking I'm going to need  special build of nuget.core to avoid this behavior.\n. For references see\n- https://nuget.codeplex.com/discussions/240844\n- https://nuget.codeplex.com/discussions/238253\n- https://twitter.com/ferventcoder/status/523894747031949312\n. I started down this path on https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org/issues/101 - but got held up in that nuget throws the error above if you add anything it doesn't recognize to the schema.\n. Also #352 is sort of a dupe\n. I've moved this issue to https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/205\n. Looks good. Merge it in. Remember to keep my line straight. ;)\n. Interesting. So you are saying if it is called we go ahead and write the filename.ignore on it? That would be cool.\n. Shouldn't be too hard. Slap a tiny ignore file next to it no matter where it is. No one is going to complain if it is up in the temp dir. :D\n. Done 6a4961692162496f00d36381542e7bc5c0aae824\n. To be clear, this is for apps that when pulled don't require further compilation. So in effect these are still \"binary\" packages...\n. Is this still relevant?\n. This may already be done for 0.9.8.20.\n. It's right here: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/helpers/functions/Get-WebFile.ps1#L21 \n. I'm closing this as ready for the next release. Unless you have questions or comments?\n. We are also looking at bumping up the buffer. Try this bump that number to 1048576  \n\n``` powershell\n[byte[]]$buffer = new-object byte[] 1048576\n```\n. This is in. I had to bump it down to 100 iterations with the larger buffer pipe. Please let me know if that is too low and still grabs too much memory\n. I think these would be helpful in chocolatey as well. We are always moving forward to pulling as much logic into utility functions and out of packages so that packages can stay small and readable. And the other side effect is that we can fix/update logic without having to edit a bunch of packages. \n. This prolly makes the intent clearer, but the code was never broken. Just FYI. We're gonna need to work on those merge commits...\n. The parameters are read in the helper functions, so it's completely transparent to the package unless pkg maintainer wanted to know about them and use them.\n. Bad or good - the arguments passed into chocolatey are global (powershell script thing). Like I said, this makes it more direct and less transparent to the methods where this comes from.\n. This is completed 41c87c064d3c73c933dba9a4a5ee72a435a3ab2d\n. Great question...going to need to look at history for that one. The functionality here is to return a string that is up to 8 chars long padded w/zeroes on the front. I think this pull request may have broken that functionality\n. Actually the thought here it to completely rip this out with something better at some point. This was a stop gap solution.\n.  This is very interesting territory.  However this may be better suited to be tackled after v1.\n. I'm a little scared of editing the registry uninstaller values. That could get us into some dangerous territory. However it does pose a very interesting scenario.\n. Maybe I'm biased, but a package owner (not author of tool/app) is not who I would want to have this either. If anything, this would be something that we might eventually bake into chocolatey and expose through a function to package owners.\n. Thanks, will likely be pulling this in over the weekend.\n. This is completed - bd03ec769c550d534dedef803781b0a066fca082\n. Will be looking this over and merging soon, likely this weekend.\n. I just realized what you are doing here. calling nuget list without a filter will only return so many results. 635 is what it looks like it returned. nuget.org, one of the two default sources for chocolatey, has over 9200 packages. Chocolatey has about 550 at the moment. If this only pulls back around 500 results from each source, you can see how this becomes inaccurate really quickly. \n\nI should be able to take the 1 second of sleep time out of this.\n. Agreed on refactoring - need to get in a PR that might fix this prior to a refactor though.\n. Is this still relevant?\n. Not disagreeing with any of these points. All polish and eventually where chocolatey will be.\n\nI was thinking `choco` would be a good entry point - easy and short. You might have mentioned it in your stuff here.\n. The problem with this issue/enhancement is that it is not one issue enhancement but several.\n. A great forum for this would be like the google group - then we can list them out and point to the topic\n. Agreed on the wiki - I would love to have a http://chocolatey.github.com \n. I accept pull requests on the chocolatey.github.com repo. I won't be able to get to this myself for a few weeks.\n. This is called choco.\n. I know there a LOT of issues to look through, but this should already be in the issues log as an enhancement. We don't fully support uninstall until 0.9.9. That's when it will have helper utility functions.  If you look around a bit, for MSIs we are goung to store the guid. Then when you uninstall we'll just /x guid /quiet. Nothing else necessary. \n. Dumb question on Air installations, shouldn't there be an AIR package?\n. @bswerdlen Howdy, note one of the labels here says \"MoveToChoco\" - that means this issue either has been or still needs migrated over to the current codebase at https://github.com/chocolatey/choco.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm guessing this wasn't helpful for you - https://chocolatey.org/docs/helpers-uninstall-chocolatey-package\r\n\r\nWhen you run `choco new pkgid` from a recent version of Chocolatey, it will create a chocolateyUninstall.ps1 that is already pre-filled out with everything you need, saving you countless amount of time (and possible issues). Plus all of the just in time documentation that you get from that will definitely help answer questions like this ahead of time.\r\n\r\nWhile MSU is definitely showing up in Install-ChocolateyInstallPackage - https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/blob/946367a6c263cc2d1b3beec5e6b771404d5f0436/src/chocolatey.resources/helpers/functions/Install-ChocolateyInstallPackage.ps1#L257-L265, it doesn't appear the same exists in the Uninstall-ChocolateyPackage  - The documentation that is produced (linked above) states the same. You can see the source code that generates that documentation at https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/blob/946367a6c263cc2d1b3beec5e6b771404d5f0436/src/chocolatey.resources/helpers/functions/Uninstall-ChocolateyPackage.ps1#L52-L56\r\n\r\nHTH . Try just  \\server\\share\\etc\n. Ftp is already in for next release.\n\nTo change the vocabulary a little, it's not a workaround, it's how it works\nnow. We don't have support for urls written in that manner. If we want\nfile:// that would be an enhancement. same with git://\n\nThanks.\nOn Oct 26, 2012 12:49 PM, \"Alastair Smith\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> That workaround works, thanks.

Thanks, please open this issue on chocolateyautomaticpackages though. It's not chocolatey's fault. ;)\n. I think we are on different pages, although I like what you are talking about here.\n. http://chocolatey.org/packages/binroot\n. There are other items that may have duplicated this. This is done.\n. @Redsandro Hey thanks for the kudos!  \nI'm going to clarify the wording for chocolatey - Chocolatey is **_like**_ apt-get. This doesn't mean that is has every feature or that it is an exact replica of apt-get.   \n\nThis also doesn't mean that features like this cannot be added. We've discussed this a couple of times in the mailing list, however upon searching it doesn't appear that it was ever made into an Enhancement. We are definitely adding this feature.  \n\n## Issue 2 - Stopping on Error\n\nThe second note, that chocolatey stops on error is not a behavior we want in v1. Please file it as a separate issue.\n. Also, it's important to note that apt-get is very stable in it's feature set. It's been around for awhile and is a mature product.\n\nChocolatey on the other hand is not even to v1 yet. It's immature and not stable in it's feature set yet. Something to keep in mind. :D\n. Actually I would have to verify, but I believe npackd is older. Chocolately has been around for about a year and a half.\n\nI don't mind nitpicky at all! It's a way we get better. I honestly don't use packages.config that much. I prefer  \n\n`cinst all -source customsource` or to put together a .ps1 file w/separate calls. Both of these mean I install multiple packages w/1 call, but there is setup time involved.  If you are in powershell you can create an array of package names and pipe them into the install command. Again, not optimal, but available.\n\nThat's why we definitely want the ability to pass in a list and to keep going if one fails.\n. This lifehacker article about npackd is older by a month than chocolatey: http://m.lifehacker.com/5754305/npackd-is-a-linux+like-package-manager-for-windows\n\nAnd to avoid confusion, the date of the article is a month before chocolatey development started.\n. Agreed that the xml batch stopping on error is annoying.\n. This is fixed in https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/commit/6ca7ed1fe2d9f45fcfb3f84bbb2aa9811a544ff2\n. also in alpha2 prerelease... \n. or `cup chocolatey -pre`\n. This sounds reasonable at first glance, however, does it feel natural to say --beta when it installs an alpha or rc?\n\nAnd .... if there was a beta version and a more recent alpha, wouldn't you want it to install the beta and not the alpha based on the wording of the switch? \n. My brain is ...... well somewhat fried. :)\n. Thanks for moving this over from #191\n. It's all good. Wasn't sure if you were misspelling or not.\n. not sure what you mean... new batch functionality... \n.

Is this fixed in vCurrent?\n. @rismoney oldie but a goodie. Now we have a ticket for ensuring full stop if there is a failure in the chain - https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1151. Right now it is up to the package maintainer. The functionality is there, but it's in the packages. It might make sense to have choco note some of these so pkg maintainers do not need to.\n. well, 3010. :)\n\nFor now anyway, that is the expectation. It does make sense that chocolatey should do a better job of noting the common ones though.\n. Chocolatey's exit code is different than what it is seeing from the application install, so a 0 is what you would already get from chocolatey (0.9.8.21 we are ensuring that) when it exits with no errors.\n. I'm curious what you would use for the reboot needed flag. :)\n. Interesting. I think @mwrock is handling this idea as well with boxstarter. I'm curious how he knows it's time to reboot.\n. The BIG Hammer. Like it! \n. Assigning this to you Matt @mwrock ;)\n. @gep13 Didn't we get this in as part of another PR?\n. @rismoney is this still an issue?\n. This is left up to the package itself to install the proper one for your architecture. If the package creator doesn't include a link for a 64 bit version, it is assumed that the 32 bit is the one to install.\n\nWhat we are working on is a flag to allow someone to force a 32 bit version if they need it.\n.

I see what might be wrong. Your nupkg/nuspec might be named incorrectly. the nuspec itself should be named tomboy.nuspec.\nThe name of the package file (3.504 tomboy.1.10.2.nupkg) should not have a number or a space on the front of it.\n. Okay, dumb question. What shell are you using?\n. Your github repo?\n. tried it out on a VM. Getting the appropriate issue about not being able to find gtksharp.\n\nSo it's working on my machine...\n. Still would like to know what is going on on your end though.\n. Installs good for me.\n. What happens when you run cinst tomboy -source %cd% **-debug** ??\n. Double Double Quotes. FTW. The switch from batch to powershell leaves something to be desired in keeping quotes. \n\nso this will work: `cinst tomboy -source \"\"%cd%\"\"`\n\nMy bad, Didn't ask what your path was.\n. Normally with command line applications on Windows you would only need the single quote. It would be interesting to know what you get if you use a single quote (') instead.\n. Nice! Yeah, there is something in the conversion from batch to powershell that destroys all double quotes by themselves. It could be something I'm doing. It is annoying...I should really look into it.\n. Closing as not a bug... you will follow up with the wiki article updates?\n. Ah, I mean source code repository for your packages. Look at my profile on chocolatey.org and you will see  https://github.com/ferventcoder/nugetpackages and https://github.com/ferventcoder/chocolateyautomaticpackages\n. Looks good. Only note is the second source to the package should not contain a file, just a directory\n. No, we didn't delete it. I thought you updated the CreatePackages page only, I never remember seeing a link to another page\n. Agreed. That's an enhancement on the list. And that you could also -force -includedependencies to force the whole chain\n. Not sure if we had it listed or not.\n. thanks\n. @MikeH2012 unfortunately that library requires POSH v3+ so it's no dice\n. I will take the ball on that.\n. Sent the message, just waiting to hear back.\n. Doesn't look like this is going to be a feature that will be freely available. :(\n. This will move to a professional version of chocolatey.\n. This is going to be implemented in the pro version since it is not a free thing.\n. Thanks\n. https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/145\n. cver chocolatey-alpha3 -lo would be incorrect. alpha and 3 are prerelease version information, not part of the packagename. \n\nThere may be some wonkiness related to getting packages that are prereleases, but we have a good way to get to packages that are named pkg1.2.3 (where 2.3 is the version) versus pkg.1.2.3 (where 1.2.3 is the version). I'm confused a little because we are already doing this correctly. Console2 comes to mind.\n. Back to your original issue, I'm a little confused about what you mean about cinst without a version parameter. That should work now.\n. Thinking of other features on the plate, how then will we get to cinst pkg1\npkg2 pkg3 pkgN ??\n\nOn Tuesday, December 4, 2012, Matt Wrock wrote:\n\n> Agreed. and source too.\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/206#issuecomment-10999358.\n\n## \n\n---\n\nRob\n\"Be passionate in all you do\"\n\nhttp://devlicio.us/blogs/rob_reynolds\nhttp://ferventcoder.com\nhttp://twitter.com/ferventcoder\n. https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/commit/6ca7ed1fe2d9f45fcfb3f84bbb2aa9811a544ff2\n\nCommand and PackageName are the only positionals.

Please Look in the directory and tell me what the name of the file is with the extension \"nupkg\". \n. What Rich said. The source should be a directory. :D\n. GUI apps have a helper. appname.exe.gui (empty file that matches in case sitting directly next to where the file is or will be).\n. SymLink/Shortcut/exe in choco/bin folder - we've talked about this in the past. The biggest problem here is that it is not a universal thing due to windows, otherwise we would symlink everything in.\n\nWhat may be better is to determine a convention where we can symlink the executable into bin.\n. Spaces in Exe Names - Are there really executables with spaces in them or are you providing an example? I've never seen one, that's why I'm asking.\n.

Perhaps you missed my comment somewhere that symlinking is not comprehensive enough to handle all the scenarios the .bat handles.\n. Found it - https://groups.google.com/forum/m/?fromgroups#!topic/chocolatey/hP5h0-g-rAM\n. I think this should be an opt in kind of thing - we'd have to know what needs to be copied in besides the actual exe (like dlls/configs/inis) etc. This is where things start to get messy. One exe has a dll it depends on, another has the same dll, but a different version that it depends on. \n. What's the difference between .bat and .cmd anyways? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/148968/windows-batch-files-bat-vs-cmd\n. Opt-in by the package maintainer is what I meant. A way of indicating this file should be linked or copied somehow. \n\nOne thing to note, if ffmpeg comes to my machine without requiring admin privileges, it shouldn't require an admin privilege for me to get to use the tool (aka mklink is out of the question then). \n. I know I'm throwing things at you that seem to come out of nowhere, but they are all reasons we went for bat files in the first place.\n. Interesting thing here - if your package requires a particular version of chocolatey, you can specify the version requirements in the nuspec\n. That way if you have a minimum required version for chocolatey, you just specify that in the nuspec. When they go to install your package, it will update chocolatey automatically.\n. Yeah, symlinks are pretty limited in windows. It's kind of sad really.\n. ``` xml\n<package>\n  <metadata>\n    <dependencies>\n      <dependency id=\"Chocolatey\" version=\"0.9.8.20\" />\n    </dependencies>\n  </metadata>\n</package>\n```\n\nThe version is based on the lowest compatible version - http://docs.nuget.org/docs/reference/versioning \n. RE: Unified approach -  \n\n\"Shouldn't everything be opt-in?\" - I disagree on this because it breaks the convention there now. The convention exists so that folks can do a minimal amount of work and rock out a chocolatey package. If they have a project they want to share with the world, they can just drop the exe in a package and boom. It works. :D\n\n`.exe.startMenu` - I like this idea\n`.exe.moveToBin` - or perhaps `exe.copy`\n`.exe.linkBat` - this is the default convention, so it's unnecessary to have\n`.exe.linkGui` - this is already here as `exe.gui`\n. The script is here: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/functions/Get-ChocolateyBins.ps1#L19\n. This is not something we are looking at doing currently. Does the ShimGen answer this need?\n. It also mentions where the ruby package installs if it has not been set.\n. As far as a default value, I agree - https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/190\n. And the addition of Install-ChocolateyTool (with some parameters) that does all of this magical work for you. :D\n\nJust added for tracking - https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/221\n. We do try to keep the documentation updated with the things that exist or are in the code base but have not yet been released.\n. @Redsandro Rich is talking about the '1.0.2' in rismoney-v1.0.2_setup.exe\n.

It's all good. With all pull requests, you want them to come from branches. Makes it easier to submit multiple pull requests and to continue to work on other changes without affecting your PRs (pull requests)\n. I think you'll find that when you are using a fork of an active repo, you want your master to be pristine (aka look like the master in the active repo). \n\nYou do all of your work in branches. Those become pull requests.\n\nWhen we evaluate a PR, we look at testing and how big the impact of the change is. The bigger the impact, the longer it takes to pull in. \n\nWhen we've decided to pull one in, we like the history line to be as straight up and down as possible. That means we rewind a branch we create for your PR to the last commit from master that your branch used and then pull it in. Then we rebase that commit against all of the stuff that has happened since then (what that means is that your commit goes to the very front of the commits, even if it was two months ago). After that is done we merge it to master and push it up. You are the author, one of us is the committer (because we are moving the commit).\n. We actively work with PR authors the best we can (since this is OSS and we all have full time work) to get PRs in a state of good to go, unless the PR is a completely different direction from where I believe chocolatey should go. \n\nWe don't reject PRs just because we are getting ready for a release. We just let them sit a little longer until the release is done before evaluating them and pulling them in or not. \n. Interesting. Why not make get-webfile work with these additions?\n. Interesting...we have made choco silent by default. This seems to go\nagainst that idea. Should this not be a pkg then?\n\nOn Friday, April 19, 2013, Drew Burlingame wrote:\n\n> I agree.

Is there somewhere better that this issue can be placed (since it may not be a choco issue)?\n. Cool. Closing for now pending discovery of a chocolatey issue.\n. I think this can happen. :)\n.

Be sure to look at #595 for perspective.\n. --force --force-dependencies (or -fx)\n. This is now linked up with https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1124 so please follow from there.. There are multiple methods of installation - https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/Installation . You are not likely going to be able to use the simplest method.  It seems to me though that if you cannot open a command prompt (not powershell) and run the one on the front page of chocolatey.org (with runs a powershell command with an explicit unrestricted setting), then chocolatey is probably not going to work out for you since that is exactly how it runs when it does. \n\nI don't know how difficult it is to sign a script or what kind of maintenance issues we would see by this (since every time we change a script it would require a re-signing I believe). This makes it seem like the case - http://www.mikepfeiffer.net/2010/02/obtaining-a-code-signing-certificate-and-signing-powershell-scripts/ (and some other sites I've read over). \n\nUnfortunately it's not likely at this time that we will want to approach the cost (of both maintenance and the real cost of a VeriSign cert) of signing and re-signing our scripts. You are welcome to do a self-signed certificate and if you come up with a good way to automate that we would welcome a patch that would create a self-signed certificate, install it on a user's machine and then sign all of the chocolatey files (and probably every package at runtime just after they download since they will also have powershell in them).\n. Yep, that's going to make chocolatey very hard to use in your environment. So your option is to sign all of them with a self signed cert. When a new version comes out you will need to do that as well. The really tricky part is that you need to add a module to chocolatey to sign scripts just before chocolatey runs them as it downloads packages.  \n\nYour other option is not to use chocolatey. Unfortunately.\n. Thanks Matt, I'll get this over to .org as well.\n. Currently improving this a bit.\n. Most likely rismoney's stuff get's into choco proper. \n. And yes, things get very busy for me with my full time job. It ebbs and flows a bit, but the nature of the beast can consume most of my free time. \n. It's never returned exit codes... as we found in a different discussion (#384). I believe it was related to nuget always returning the incorrect exit code from way back 2 years ago.\n. Let's file a new issue about this over at chocolatey/choco.\n\nOn Friday, October 16, 2015, Josh Buedel notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> This still happens in at least one situation.

Except work on mono\n. I have a longstanding request to put in mono support. I agree though - I use apt and brew when on those OSes as well. I'm not sure that I would use it, but it is an interesting use case. Plus it could potentially open the door to using choco as the mono pkg mgr. Potentially b/c I'm pretty sure most folks would rather just see a mono debian repo they could add to apt. It has a much richer set of features and hooks right into the app updater in ubuntu (for the folks that like gui tools). \n. The mono idea is a low priority due to that, but scriptcs support is more interesting for a few reasons. I don't necessarily see a need for scriptcs at the moment, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't explore it. This isn't about replacing powershell, just adding options.\n. And just b/c I do not understand something does not negate that there might be some really good use cases.\n. @rismoney I agree on all points here. Folks on the IRC channel would rather wait for a perfect solution than a good enough for now solution. :) \n\nI agree that rebuilding nuget is a daunting task. I don't expect it to be done in powershell. Another reason why the core of choco will be rewritten in c#.\n. This is in. Thanks! \n. what you mean is choco clean.\n. We do not remove the previous version at all when a new version comes in by design. You can install two versions of ruby.\n. You need to be explicit on installing ruby versions. \n\nBut what I think we are missing here is a bigger design. \n\nChoco clean removes all older versions of packages except for those you have pinned.\n\nSo if you have 3 versions of ruby and you pin the latest and the first one behind it, when you clean, the one that is not pinned goes away (from the chocolatey lib, but not uninstalled yet). \n\nThe uninstall itself should be smarter about asking someone what they want to remove when there are multiple versions. Like the way ruby gems does it when you have multiple installs of a gem.\n\n```\nchoco uninstall ruby\n\nDo you want to remove:\n\n 1. Ruby v1.8.6\n 2. Ruby v1.8.7\n 3. Ruby v1.9.2\n 4. All of the above\n```\n\nSo you wouldn't have a need for bump. What you could do is add clean to the end of the install command `cinst ruby -clean` so it cleans up the old.\n. And yes, right now when there are multiple active versions, PPAs break down a bit on keeping these separate if you try to treat them as the package. What we are looking to do here is create some meta packages that are dependent on a range of versions of a package so you can install them. What it doesn't handle very well right now is the upgrade scenario and why I haven't moved forward with it. It works right now just like it is, it's just not as easy for someone to see how they would get 1.8.7 and 1.9.2 of ruby and keep them updated independently. They have to use `choco update ruby -version 1.8.7.###` to go up and stay on 1.8.7. \n\nThese are special edge cases that don't always fit nicely into the versioning concept since they are maintained over time instead of deprecated for the newer versions. Nothing wrong with it, it just complicates things a bit, that's all.\n. This is also where the evolution of the chocolateyInstall.ps1 will come in handy (where we break some areas into known functions chocolatey can call).\n. I think that's where the clean command comes in. Choco has no way of\nknowing what us side by side and what is not. However a user pins packages\nthey want to keep and then later runs clean, it only cleans older pkgs that\nare not pinned. Punning also excludes a pkg fron upgrade during cup all.\n\nOn Wednesday, March 27, 2013, Rich Siegel wrote:\n\n> Maybe cup should delete all versions.

It is developed, but you have to have the latest source installed. Otherwise the -lo is going to be ignored. I just added it last night. :)\n. It points to the local chocolatey lib folder as a source and good old nuget to do the searching.\n. We can upgrade the list to return object - I'm not sure if it does now.\n. That's exactly the design. You should always bump the dependencies to the least usable version. Leaving out the version in the dependency is a shortcut that when taken produces exactly the results you are seeing.\n\n**Reasoning:** What if say the newest version of a dependency was no longer compatible with your package that depended on it? If we implemented the above, it would not be the desired behavior.\n. Folks are welcome to cup a dependency installed package as well.\n. And there is cup all, which would bump everything to the latest version. However, it may bump something you don't want upgraded (until we get the pinning feature implemented).\n. I don't believe this is the answer you were looking for, perhaps we can add the switch to force it. Just not make it the default. Which is likely exactly what you were looking for.\n. I think we can do this, but it may not make it in until after v1.\n. Thanks for finding this.\n. We're looking at May/June.\n. True that...\n. This is done - it's called `--noop`, but you can also use `-whatif` to invoke the same behavior.

If you have a package installed already, the dependency is resolved. Therefore you wouldn't need to include it in your current directory (source). Otherwise you need to put it there. In the case of chocolatey itself, it was treated differently for the first install and not also put in the %choco install%\\lib directory. We are going to fix that so that things can take dependencies on newer versions of chocolatey better.\n. You can take a dependency on a minimum version of chocolatey like you are doing and it should be fine. You just need to make sure when you are testing out dependencies in a local source, if you don't want to add the dependency packages to the source, specify the source they are in as well. As in -source \"\"%cd%;http://chocolatey.org/api/v2/\"\" (note the double double quotes here).\n\nDoes this make sense?\n.

I understand what is being asked here. It's not a trivial thing to list out dependents with accuracy as the graph can change without a package's knowledge and does not span across multiple sources. \n\nI'm assuming this could really only be based on a source, where it would build a tree of current dependents (or some stale value, perhaps every 6 hours or so, that is acceptable so that it doesn't kill the server).\n\nDo you have a good example of a pkg manager that is doing this now?\n. Perfect. Thanks for the example. :)\n. IMHO managing dependencies is fundamental for a pkg mgr - getting info about what depends on a pkg is very handy, but I'd hardly argue fundamental. \r\n\r\nHowever I'd like to understand a use case that makes this fundamental.. Agreed it would be great to see who depends on a package, graphed locally and on a package source.. I think we can accomodate this... the priorities might fall this to take some time. I see you've done this on your master branch. If you plan to make any more changes and do pull requests you would be limited. \n\nMy suggestion is that you close this, move the changes to a branch, and then issue the pull request. That would allow you to make any additional pull requests or update your branch without influencing this request.\n\nKeep in mind the current wait time for acceptance of pull requests in chocolatey is on the order of a couple of months if not longer. Some things we get in very quickly, some things we do not, depending on where it falls for prioritization.\n. I'm less concerned about the rebase... what I don't want you to do though is do a pull and merge, that messes with source. Then I have to cherry pick your commits out to keep a good linear history.\n. I have the methods I expect committers to use in an email somewhere - it might be a good idea to put it into a readme markdown in the source.. it's very close to what you are saying here Rich.\n. Basically what should happen for the requestee:  \n1. git checkout -b support_msu\n2. reissue pull request.\n3. reset your master to remove these changes. git extensions gui is a helpful one for doing that.\n. This isn't so bad... :)\n. Please don't update pull requests.

Superseded by #628 \n. Is this a chocolatey issue or a package issue?\n. Think I figured out the issue... \n%chocolatey_bin_root% is set to c:\\chocolatey\\bin, right?\n. Try installing it again. I updated the package to not change the system drive if you have already specified it.\n. So in the case of the triumvirate, you can never go wrong with just the default (7zip). It will almost always install the .install/.app version of the application. No further thought necessary. The zipped version is there purely for the folks who won't have admin permissions to their machines or who don't mind going through a little extra work to keep things out of add/remove programs. \n\nWe are working to make the docs better and it will come with time. HTH\n. It's not really a specialization. Virtual packages are not baked at all at the moment. All there is are metapackages that point to the .install or the .commandline version of the packages. They exist for discoverability as well.\n. Agreed on most points. Some of this is definitely a polish aspect that we won't see until version 2 of chocolatey. Some of it is an infrastructure design for how we better handle package breakdowns, i.e. to your point of the one package, how do you handle french, japanese, and chinese versions of a package? What is the actual versions are out of sync? Should that hold up the package? Or should we somehow hide the other packages and we have the virtual make the best decision? That's kind of what I'm leaning towards.\n\nLots of design considerations here. :)\n.

That's why we usually let the native installers that already know how to upgrade do their thing. In most times they handle the upgrade well, however there are cases where you mentioned artifacts are left behind.  In the principal of least surprise, I would find it more surprising if files / configuration were missing versus some extra files/folders around.\n\nThoughts?\n. > 1) Introduce the \"chocolateyUpdate.ps1\" script mentioned in the title, which should be placed in the newer package (the newer version knows about older versions, but not the other way around). Chocolatey should call that script if it exists (and skip chocolateyUninstall.ps1 from the existing, older package), otherwise fall back to uninstall old + install new.\n\nAnd this `chocolateyUpdate.ps1` could call the older package's uninstall should the maintainer know the ramifications of this.\n. Will be thinking of improvements we can make as we move forward on the new version.\n. Migrated to https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/268\n. Install-PowershellModulePath (or something like that). \n- This copies something to a path specified.\n- If the path is not already created in the environment variable, it will add it.\n- Be able to specify user/machine (unless this is only one or the other).\n\nSo looks like three parameters to be passed.\n. @jaykul may also be interested in this discussion and being more of an SME on this, he probably has suggestions on how to implement.\n. I know @jaykul had something he was working on for this kind of thing. \n.

Hmmm....that sounds bad. I haven't run it through any profilers but we can take a look.\n. So this is due to needing the COM shell for unzipping files. That doesn't exist on core.

Gildas, would you be up for a hangout to discuss some of these things? \n. Interesting dilemma. Seems we need to be able to pass something to the downloaded string as we invoke it.\n. call this instead of the normal install - https://chocolatey.org/installabsolutelatest.ps1\n. Yes, we already published a notice on this: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/chocolatey/PSA$3A$20Possible$20Action$20Required!$20Schema$20Version$20Errors$20if$20you$20have$20upgraded$20to$20Nuget$202.5/chocolatey/HGIqDlOSXTQ/lPPOpmvuP84J\n.

So I either have to change the names, which I'm not going to do, or drop powershell in favor of c# calling powershell packages (which is in the plans anyway).\n. I have it working now, but I had to remove the two naming conflicts... and those need to stay in.\n\nFor reference: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6870362/can-i-create-a-script-with-parameter-that-has-aliasdb-in-powershell\n\nand http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10536282/powershell-defining-the-verbose-switch-in-a-function\n.

I didn't remove, I just moved them down... :) \n\nSo those things are still there.\n. cup chocolatey -pre and you have it... :)\n. That and I've been mulling over this guy for awhile in how I would see it implemented. :)\n. Also your sarcasm went a long way into me getting off of my duff and getting 'er done. :+1: \n\nWith my new job you should see a much faster response time...\n. Beauty of a prerelease. Those can go out all day and night so folks can play with them. And if they don't work, well it was a prerelase... ;)\n. yep... know what you are talking about @rismoney - will Mark Johnson's stuff not work for you? The offline installer piece?\n. It would go in the helpers\\functions dir - anything outside of that is considered not available to pkgs. If they use anything outside of that, it's not guaranteed to be there...\n. FYI - the packages doing this is fine, but it will eventually be part of Install-ChocolateyPortablePackage (vaporware at the moment) so it just happens behind the scenes.\n. Also, when I had this in my head, I'd always called it tools root so as not to confuse with the bin folder. not a big deal, just trying to figure out the naming :)\n. It's a convention. Just trying to figure out if it's the right convention or if it needs to be changed. Heck, we just changed the convention on .app / .tool to .install / .portable to convey the obvious. :)\n. It comes on the google group - https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/chocolatey/dxnOBFly3vU\n. Not sure... That's interesting. What is upstream for you?\n. I tend to use rebase to keep my commits at the top before I push them back to the remote repo.\n\nBut what you are doing should work... should. ;)\n. Closing as #359 has been accepted.\n. This sounds pretty solid. It might be a version or two before we get to this though.\n. Like I suggested, what we need first is a way to pass a universal switch to chocolatey for directory to install has to happen first and then packages will need to buy into that some.\n. Seems like you could have an internal fork of chocolatey where you make that change right in the first lines of chocolatey.ps1 :)\n. At least as stop gap. It would be really easy to make the change here but I'm reluctant as the really easy changes is what has kept around the POSH version for two years past it's usefulness.\n. This partially closes #647.\n. Bad Example - papercut IS now maintained by the author - http://papercut.codeplex.com/discussions/251360\n. But I get what you are saying - you need to reach out to the pkg maintainers on chocolatey.org through the contact owners link. If you don't hear back from them within a week followup with an abuse report. If you don't hear back, follow up with an email to the chocolatey google group. This triage process is published on the google group, but probably needs to be published on the wiki as well.\n. https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/PackageTriageProcess\n. Are we good to close this guy?\n. Also updated http://devlicio.us/blogs/rob_reynolds/archive/2013/01/03/chocolatey-automatic-packages.aspx\n. In older versions of nuget.exe, it would bubble up false errors back to chocolatey (like when you asked it to install something you already had installed and it noop-ed). \n\nIf that is out of the current, then I'm fine with us looking at @rismoney's issue #210 - which this could be considered a duplicate of. We'll reference this in 210 and close this issue. Thanks! \n. Sometimes it's `cinst [package] -pre` (just like the website states). If you are upgrading perhaps we should add this as well to the commands you can call.\n. This enhancement goes on https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org\n. That right there should go to it's own issue. Thanks! \n. Thank you. This is likely the same thing that Katherine has been talking about. It's a strange issue that seems to go away if you use -debug (so it's extremely hard to detect WHAT is causing it).\n.

I ended up adding this functionality here 2db80fa929491c7b38ef6ca329782f8f11b11b3c\n. `imagemagick-6.8.6-1` would be what you were actually suggesting (I hope). If you read that, ubuntu packages are built on top of debian, so you already have the debian package version on there with `-1` right before `ubuntu6` (where six is the ubuntu package version). \n\nI think ultimately we can find something more flexible. Along these lines I could see something like `sometool.1.2.3-prereleaseinfo(1)` or something like that. I am not a fan of that yet, just thinking out loud.\n. > What if the software itself already uses four dot-separated segments for its version and you need to fix the package? If you have for example a software version 2.5.8.1, you are forced to alter the last segment, so the original software version information gets destroyed: 2.5.8.20140327. Then, for all the following packages of version 2.5.8.x, you are forced to use the current date as last segment, even if the affected package does not actually fix a previous package revision. You would have to wait until the packaged software gets released with version 2.5.9.x to be able to drop the date in the last segment and use the real software version again. So here an essential information is removed just because of a senseless restriction.\n\nActually you can get creative here. It's not suggested to do this in the fourth segment if it is used. Look at the ruby package. `1.9.3.392` becomes `1.9.3.39200` and the next release is `1.9.3.39201`. It's not perfect and yes we should look at enhancing stuff like that. Where do you see this in terms of priority? \n. Fixed in 8d10898b682e03cefa02123b404397a34580f778\n. @Gab-km I think for me, the username is a requirement. While we hope people also have a password that is not empty, can you think of any cases where someone might have it set empty? I can't off the top of my head so having it required would also be helpful\n. The interesting thing here is easy_install is supported already with\n-source python.\n\nNot sure if you realized that.

There is nothing that keeps chocolatey from inspecting an already built package and attempting to do many of these things before it allows a package to be available to consumers.\n. Nothing but rolling up some sleeves and getting to work that is.\n. It's actually a both kind of thing. There would be a certain set of\nelements that would be run locally. Then a much bigger set that would\noverlap the local set (in case of client funny business) and run on the\nserver.\n\nAnother way to think about it is unit tests versus integration tests.\nLocally we run some smoke checks and some validation of common issues.\n\nOn the server we let the package through but hold it until it passes more\nextensive validation rules.\n\nThe whole idea is a business rules engine that is based on a validation\nlibrary I've written in the past.

It is possible to do so with myget (copy them anyway)\n. There is an easier fix, which is package moderation. Reject anything that doesn't meet the guidelines.

Old one that is fixed. This may have been fixed already...\n. It's unfortunately the way powershell works. You can force powershell to acknowledge quotes with `\"\n. This could also be considered a bug as well.\n. I'm not sure if this is still an issue on new choco or not.\n. I think while the two things being discussed are related, they are slightly different. The related part is surrounding OS and dependencies. The part that is different is that one decides whether the package should be installed or not and the other decides what specifically would be installed per OS.\n\nAm I catching the differences appropriately?\n. The check that @mwrock does for the existence of the framework should be done in a separate package named solely for .net framework 3.5. I think we can agree on that. \n\nWe can either go - \"Packages - its packages all the way down.\" or build in dependency types that are not necessarily package related. \n.

My wording in the first comment didn't make a whole lot of sense. I think you answered correctly though.\n. @mlt I'm thinking you may have Emacs looking for `SumatraPDF` before `SumatraPDF.exe`, which could cause the need for double quotation. A simple where/which query `where sumatrapdf` could prove this out followed by `SumatraPDF.exe \"one set.pdf\"`. Can you provide those things?\n. @mlt I see it stripping off quotes. Let me see what I can do.\n. Right, but we need it to work in almost all cases. How will we be able to detect that it works without actually running the application in some controlled state and seeing if it errors due to an unfound library? That's why we're moving to a shim. Still provides really good functionality over batches with minimal issue.\n. @mlt we still support windows 2003 (and so does MS until 7/14/2015).\n. @georgehemmings This is done based on the call in the Win32 API, meaning Windows strips them out (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9287812/backslash-and-quote-in-command-line-arguments & http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/archive/2006/09/13/Command-Line-Confusion.aspx) - What I'll need to do is likely detect spaces and strap on quotes when found. Or just add quotes every time around arguments.\n. @mlt thanks for pointing out the console window appears. I think I have fixed that (but not yet released).\n. @mlt I have the spaces issue fixed. Should be a call like normal to that once you see the next beta/release go out.\n. This should be ready to go.\n. That's a really pretty image. :)\n. I am going to pull in #376 though.\n. `cinst chocolatey -pre` for most of the cool things I just did this weekend.\n. Not really a fan of 3 lines of output over the original 1 line. If there is a want for a reduction in output, there should be a nice middle point where we make the output nicer but also don't trade one line for three. Thoughts?\n.

Well how about this summer sometime?  .......Things always take longer than you hope.\n. Thanks google. :/\n. I should test this and possible pull it in. Do you know if that requires .net framework 4 or 4.5?\n. Note the fix of the double install folks.\n. If you call an installer, it will generate the ignore file automatically. That's where this was failing, when it tries to create one in a readonly share or something based on how this is being used.\n. The only time that a batch redirect would be created is if it doesn't get called during the chocolatey install process (which generates the ignore file)\n. `choco list -localonly`\n`choco list -lo`\n\nThose are the fast ones. \n\nAlso just `choco` now outputs the version.\n.

So with some testing it might be an okay change to make.\n. @codearoo Ha, looks like we hijacked this thread. I didn't even pay attention to what the main issue was that was reported.\n. I believe this is now fixed\n. try 'whoami && whoami' and from cmd.exe to see if it works, then follow up\nwith powershell. I don't expect it to work at all in a bash shell since it\nhas been stripping all single and double quotes.

What was the issue?\n. In case there is something to follow up on and fix. :)\n. Sad...that's sad to look at. This happens because you are using the alias which is passing install or update to choco.\n\nSo what this means is we should either remove all aliases or search for those strings and do replacement. I'm in favor of deprecation of shortcuts.\n. Note that this is the transition phase... it has already begun. :)\n. `choco` is the ubiquitous term. It beat the rest of the possibilities...\n. The first is not a replace all, it's just a one line change. https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org/blob/master/chocolatey/Website/Views/Packages/DisplayPackage.cshtml#L98\n\nThe second is a change to an image. \n. This is a duplicate of #295. However that one has bad naming as compared to this one, so I will close it as a dupe of this.\n. This is really a duplicate of #6 (just FYI).\n. Installs are silent and scriptable, that doesn't mean other actions should also be (by default). That might be where you pass a switch to make it so.\n\nNote that the uninstall in choco at the moment is very naive, it doesn't do much without help.\n\nAnd to touch on @TomOne 's suggestion - I have been giving that alot of thought and I think we will move that way. Choco is 100% semver compliant (AKA no real rules for less than v1), so wild changes are still okay while we are working out how it should be for the release.\n. I'm not a fan of that as much as you are not (the nuget cache)....\n. @TomOne I agree. One needs to have a hash in the package so you know that the local is the same as the MD5 hash so you wouldn't have to download it again. Perhaps search and open an issue on this?\n. `choco uninstall pkgname --all-versions`\n. That's funny, someone else requested the autofocus... perhaps we add a key (it breaks vimium for me until I tab out of it).\n. A key like Alt+S to focus on the search box.\n. It supports package parameters but very naively. It doesn't send a param in\nthe way you would. It doesn't do an inspection of the\nchocolateyInstall.ps1, look and try to map the parameters to the file as it\ncomes into the script.\n\nWhat you pass to the package should be -params 'key=value;key2=value2'\n. Updated the documentation you referenced to reflect that $env:chocolateyPackageParameters will be a value that will contain these items \n. Right, as you parse the string out, you would convert the key value for the bool to a switch.\n. Was waiting for sysnative to come out.... \n. This looks good. I think we can pull it in just so. Thoughts @mwrock ??\n. New  at #393\n. Awesome! Thank you for doing that. This looks pretty clean and easy to pull\nin.\n\nOn Thursday, December 19, 2013, Julian Easterling wrote:\n\n> Recently while creating a chocolatey package, I ran into an issue where\n> trying to install a windows feature would fail on my 64-bit windows\n> operating system with a message saying that I could not use the 32-bit\n> version of DISM to manage features.

That did just point out a possible bug in new choco install logic. **NOTE**: It believes chocolatey 0.9.8.23 is installed. :/\n. Pinned, means you \"pin\" to a particular version. It's a way to suppress upgrades...\n. Attempting to upgrade shows the proper version:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/63502/5993780/eb32d902-aa20-11e4-884b-edf0e213b637.png)\n\nIt's there in the package directory:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/63502/5993782/04f657ec-aa21-11e4-94f8-122982545521.png)\n\nBut list, not so much. Shows last release version of everything. Anyone want to guess what I forgot to pass? Yes, `-pre`. Listing what you have installed should include and prefer a prerelease. Otherwise it can get confusing about what version you actually have installed. So it's a bug.\n. https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/46 (and fixed)\n. FYI, the `-r` option is meant for machines to read, not humans. But at least it's a start for taking something over and piping it to a posh script.\n. I think this is perfect. This is what NuGet should have done and one thing that made me want to start looking else where.  Is .NET 4.0 still supported in NuGet 2.8?\n. @nabheet yes in the nuspec.\n. @AnthonyMastrean NuGet indeed did introduce Dependency Resolution strategy, but they didn't expose it as all in NuGet.exe. Sad but no matter as choco.exe does it just fine. https://github.com/chocolatey/choco\n. I have to agree on logout.

Thanks for the contributions folks! Much appreciated. :)\n\nSorry I've been (*ahem*) slow with the PRs lately.\n. Now that is interesting. The behavior is that it is **supposed** to move on to the next source but from what I see here that is not the case when the first source errors.\n. Sweet! We need to explore the latest version. Probably in 0.9.8.25 though (or 0.99 if we call it that).\n. This particular issue is at https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/612 (and not necessarily related to what this was originally, because we have an even newer version of NuGet than was suggested earlier in this post).\n\n@metalseargolid can you perhaps move your comment over to that thread? Thanks! \n. Yes, this is by design. You are telling chocolatey to only use this one\nsource to resolve all packages. When choco runs normally it uses all known\nsources to resolve packages and dependencies, in source order.\n\nYou can specify multiple sources by separating with a semicolon and\nencapsulating with single quote marks, e.g. 'C:\\somesource;\nhttps://chocolatey.org/api/v2/'.\nThis is noted in the wiki documentation as well, although the format\ndoesn't always make it easy to find.\n\nYou might try using the mailing list for things like this.

Well that seems like a bug... Looks like you added that to #421?\n. This is fixed with merging of #421\n. Use `choco pack` instead if you find collisions. `choco command` is becoming the ubiquitous usage of chocolatey.\n. @bbenoist Great arguments. We're deprecating most of them. It's quite possible that most if not all will be removed by v1. `cinst` may stick around for a v2 removal since it is the most widely used and would impact a much larger set of folks.\n. Yes... :)\n. @paulsapps - You should delete `c:\\programdata\\chocolatey\\bin\\cpack.exe` as a workaround for now. Or you can try to update the path so that cmake's cpack evaluates first on the path.\n. Issue moved to https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/89\n. Ah, good point. Grammar. :)\n. We went with the fix of not allowing c:\\ for now.\n. See cd11749affd02b9445437517b46d49ad25ce7eb5\n.

We've fixed this on chocolatey.org. This is what happens when I go down to spend time with the family and am in a low speed internet area... :(\n. Thanks so much for reporting.

Was the item you are fixing in stable?\n. Okay, that's fine. We will just pull this into master.\n. You want to send me this against stable branch instead and I will get it into the next version?\n.

I'm closing this as not able to reproduce until we hear back.\n. This is something I want as well, thanks for filing the ticket. We are a ways from having a REPL but eventually I think we want to get there. There are a few more important things we want to cover first (like rewriting chocolatey into something that would support a REPL) and package indexes that would be able to help with getting the list with tab completion.\n. The issue with creating packages is a validation of fields in the nuspec\nthat need to be in http format.

Thanks! This will be released in 0.9.8.25 (unless we rename it to 0.9.9.0).\n. @thigg - what is the issue you opened? \n. Right, the ruby.devkit doesn't work with ruby 2. You can still install 1.9.3 and 1.8.7 - 1.9.3 is still in active use, 1.8.7 not so much.\n. Oh yeah, that was an issue with 0.9.8.23 and trying to reference something with 7z that doesn't exist #371. It does make sense to remove cinstm and to add ruby there\n. Done... please let me know if you need me to look at anything else. Closing this for now.\n. There, updated. Knowing that you can natively do this now by taking a dependency on something that can do .tar.gz and then doing so in the package like I have shared on Stackoverflow, this is most definitely a feature request and not an issue, since it does work today.\n. I think the current implementation of the helper can be given an optional -type parameter or in the absence of that, looks at the url of the remote file/name of local file to realize the extension and do the right thing. This is part of the ideas behind chocolatey. Do the right thing without a ton of different helpers that are essentially doing the same thing. \n\nThe difference here is knowing what to do with a tar versus a tar.gz versus a zip versus a 7z. I don't want four helpers, that's wasteful and adds mental context for users.\n. Archive?\n. This is being implemented in https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/386. It's still going to ask for uac permissions - we already use this. Look at Start-processasadmin\n. Agreed all over.\n. You are however using chocolatey in an unsupported scenario. When we prep for a powershell module we will need to do this\n. I believe this is fixed as of 0.9.10.3, further in 0.10.0, and has one outstanding issue to be fixed.\n\n### 0.9.10.x\n- Refresh environment between packages, ensure process variables stay set - https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/439\n- In PowerShell, do not update PSModulePath - https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/295\n- Ensure SYSTEM Temp folder - https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/826\n\n### 0.10.0\n- Capturing additional PSModulePath process items and making them available for the Internal PowerShell Host - https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/830\n\n### Further fixes for Update-SessionEnvironment\n- Ensure refresh while running in PowerShell doesn't wipe out variables - https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/129\n. The last one may not be required.\n. Fixes #455 \n. I had to rebase onto stable...\n\nMerged in at https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/commit/e2927d6cae116d9966166bbb6c7bc3aac3cc087b\n. Thanks so much for providing tests as well. Aside from your branch basing off of _env.cmd stuff, this was well done.\n. Well something went wrong on this end, could be that I had to change those commits some on the way in and your changes did not so it looked like different commits.\n. Yes, it did. I think that was due to the different commit hashes\n. @gep13 This looks good to me\n. No need on this one.\n. Always fun to see these errors. It's not there in 0.9.8.24, but another issue is right now.\n. You might see this in 0.9.8.24 final, the reason is that the chocolatey.cmd file is upgraded in place (including all of the other files). The PowerShell files are loaded into memory so they cause no issues with things missing, but it falls back to the new chocolatey.cmd coming out of the posh bits and encounters a variable that was set in the beginning of the new chocolatey.cmd and called there and at that point it doesn't know what it is since it was never set in the original call.\n\nAnd a long explanation to what that craziness is.\n. There is nothing to fix from here at this time.\n. You killed the process. :)\n\nWe have a somewhat naive interpretation that things are installed at the moment. That needs to be in a pending status until everything is successful or failed.\n\nThanks for noting this.\n. Terminology: Nuget marks a package as installed once the folder is there and it is unpacked. \n\nSince choco relies on nuget to determine installation, not the steps following the package install to install the software, that's where the issue lies.\n. Thank you sir\n. Yes, the cruft in chocolateysetup has been reduced but definitely requires more work. It's nice to see that you are putting in some work in that respect. It's very much appreciated but it does show that we need some mocking or abstraction in some cases here as these tests would actually alter the state of the system/user environment variables. The last time there was something like that in chocolatey it killed out my entire path (that I later rebuilt from a backup). I didn't introduce the tests that did that, but they were fixed in a way where mocking was made easier.\n\nThis is a good start. I have started conversations in some areas where I'm trying to understand what is going on or where I have specific concerns, especially with the use of test code in the production code. I think even though we explicitly import the helpers during installation, some of that code stands to be changed as well due to another error. I think we can find a smarter way to go about this, perhaps put the mocked code where the real code would have been for tests.\n. That was fun, for future reference `git rebase --onto stable master` while in the feature branch.\n. This is in locally by the way. I haven't pushed it up yet as I'm verifying it all the way back to win2003\n. Okay, let me back up the commits and set that up.\n. Merged into stable at https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/commit/02eccc940ca6341a094a408244206b13c87eacc1\n. This is implemented by #488 \n. Keep in mind that some of this is on borrowed time as c# choco will ultimately replace this area.\n. Left some comments at https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/commit/9a0af45c12973a6fafe6b28dbc90a6df7db7441c \nI think there are some design decisions here that are a little outside of chocolatey that would need to be fixed up.\n. Also, you can just use `(GH-489)` at the start of your commits. That is the way most of the commits are done to reference issues.\n. @030 If you submit a PR we can work through changes there. It's much easier to do.\n. Can you do that from the command line with ruby? Or is it just in gemfiles\nand gemspecs?\n\nOn Thu, Jun 19, 2014 at 2:45 PM, Christian H\u00f6ltje notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> It would be nice to be able to add version constraints instead of a\n> specific version.\n> \n> An example borrowing from Ruby's ~> (aka squid rocket) notation:\n> \n> chocolatey install windb -version '~> 8.59.20140318'\n> \n> This would install \"8.59.20140318\" or newer-third-place. e.g.\n> 8.59.20200101 but not 8.60 or 9.0\n> \n> Ciao!\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/490.\n\n## \n\nRob\n\"Be passionate in all you do\"\n\nhttp://devlicio.us/blogs/rob_reynolds\nhttp://ferventcoder.com\nhttp://twitter.com/ferventcoder\n. I'm saying this because you can do version constraints with chocolatey already (not on the command line though).\n\nhttp://docs.nuget.org/docs/reference/versioning#Specifying_Version_Ranges_in_.nuspec_Files\n\nThat same range works in package.config files as well.\n. Closing this as already an existing feature (based on the earlier note on version constraints in package files) unless you can show me how to do this on command line at runtime and not in a gemfile. \n. You don't have to worry about them. \n\nWhat happens is this:\n1. you call `chocolatey update chocolatey`\n2. chocolatey batch redirect calls chocolatey.cmd.\n3. chocolatey.cmd calls powershell and chocolatey.ps1, which is loaded into memory.\n4. the upgrade process does an in place upgrade/replacement of all the files in the executing directory.\n5. powershell files are upgraded, but powershell is executing from memory so it continues using the old \"files\".\n6. When powershell finishes, it hands it back over to chocolatey.cmd, but it's the newly placed chocolatey.cmd file that contains a new variable that the old one didn't.\n7. The variable is declared way before the step in the execution process we are on, so it evaluates to `''` instead of whatever value it should hold.\n8. So when it executes something later related to this variable, it doesn't know what it is, and the rest of the path looks wrong that it is using. %DIR% is the variable btw.\n9. RefreshEnv is still found since it is local to the script and so it is run.\n\nSo nothing to worry about. I had a special environment set up recently where I discovered all of this fun. I was fixing https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/459\n.

This is not a chocolatey issue. I suggest you use the contact maintainers form and or follow through the maintainers to find their chocolatey repository and file the issue there. \n\nTo help - https://github.com/ferventcoder/chocolateyautomaticpackages.\n. :+1: \n. Looks to be the same version?\n. Closing for now... unless this is an issue with chocolatey.\n. You may want to use the mailing list for questions like this - https://groups.google.com/group/chocolatey\n. and why not use invoke expression?\n. oh wait, nevermind... you are talking about against a remote computer. \n. So let me throw this out there, you have a bunch of computers all in some zone that could potentially reach a common known UNC share somewhere where you could ALREADY have unpacked chocolatey.\nAll that's left is for them to run the rest of the script, which is internal to you anyway.\n. Likely. I should have mentioned this is somewhat a duplicate as well. See https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/136 (similar but not exact).\n. By the way:\n\n> That said, while we have already slightly customized the installer already to 1) ensure we get a system-scoped ChocolateyInstall env variable for all users 2) set a specific installation directory and 3) set a specific URL to serve the installation files\n1. 0.9.8.24 will do this if you are running a process with elevated privileges\n2. You can already do this now if you set the environment variable prior to install - see https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/Installation#before-you-install\n3. choco sources add _name_ _location_\n. This looks to be a package issue...\n. If the package is doing something more than it should be and/or not using the helpers, I fully expect those packages to break. And they should b/c they need to stay out of chocolatey's purview. Anything that reaches into chocolatey's internals and uses functions, whatever, that are not in the API will start to break hard once choco.exe comes out.\n. I don't see anything too out of the ordinary going on here though.\n. So it does look like we have an issue\n\n```\n[ERROR] Chocolatey expected a file at \n'C:\\Users\\vagrant\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\chocolatey\\Firefox\\availableLocales.html' to \nbe of length '' but the length was '107268'.\n```\n. Probably need a more rigid check in there if the content-type is html and a content-length is not found, don't attempt to error.\n. I pushed chocolatey 0.9.8.25-alpha1 - this fixes the issue on my end. Can you verify it also works for you?\n\n```\nchoco install chocolatey -pre\n```\n. Don't expect a long lead time here. Once we get your other issue figured out, the release cycle should be within a few days - #505 \n\nThe faster we get to the bottom of that and get a correction, the faster we release.\n. Release cycles generally go really fast when a new release causes gating issues, like this issue. And like the other issue you have reported.\n\nIssues found that have  workarounds usually tend to be longer release cycles.\n. @TomOne Let's not twist my words around here. I said **IF**. The intent is if a package is reaching in and using chocolatey's internals, such as internal methods **NOT** in the public api (`Get-ChocolateyWebFile` **is** part of the public api), they will break.  The comment was **in general**, not necessarily applying to firefox's package. And it doesn't as we realized in a later comment I made that you skipped over.\n\nLet me give you an example. There are packages looking up the path to c:\\chocolatey\\chocolateyInstall\\Nuget.exe and using it. I've advised the ones I know to not depend on internals as they can and will change.  ScriptCs fixed this - https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/pull/240 (from https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/issues/239).\n\nOther examples include using any function not in here: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/helpers/chocolateyInstaller.psm1#L12\n\nWhich would include https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/functions/Generate-BinFile.ps1 and anything in https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/tree/master/src/functions, which believe it or not, folks have done in the past and are still doing now. \n\nI have to say anytime you use things from any tool that are not part of the public api, you should expect that any upgrade should break your stuff. If you are using the API then it should not break it without a major version change (that's semver). If it does, it's a bug and you should expect me to do as I've done here.\n\nChocolatey is SemVer compliant - because we are not v1 we can make wild changes. But I try to provide non-breaking changes where possible. Let's not twist these words here. \n. > Are you seriously saying that every package code outside Chocolatey\u2019s API (e.g regular PowerShell code) will start to break once Chocolatey gets rewritten in C#?\n\nPowershell is not going away. Far from it. Just the internal stuff (internal chocolatey code, not part of the public API) is going away from powershell, so if folks are depending on things they should not (as previously stated), then they are going to have their packages break. Regular powershell is still going to be available as it is a fundamental part of how choco works.\n\nHope this brings an understanding into what I mean by not reaching into chocolatey's purview (internals and areas of concern).\n. I think this might have to do with something similar to #454 \n. @030 Some real live examples would be good.\n. I'm still confused what kind of service this is installing. Is this not a Windows Service (most of those do NOT require ports)?\n. No need, I was trying to understand how port would keep the service from being started if no port is specified when it is optional.\n. One of these is https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/505. Other known issue was https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/372 (specifically https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/372#issuecomment-37553192 relates to this).\n. Nope, let's call this a bug. \n. Also #509 \n. This seems to only be on GUI applications :(\n. @kevinsawicki I pushed a prerelease package with the fixes. Can you install chocolatey prerelease and then reinstall atom to regenerate the shim? Or have the person who reported the issue do this... :)\n\n``` sh\nchoco install chocolatey -pre\nchoco install atom -f\n```\n\nThen try the issue reported again to see if it also working for you now?\n. @vbsql7 can you post the gist? It could be related to the package, but it may be a bug in choco.\n. This could be the issue of just installing chocolatey and not having that\nvariable set.\n\nOn Sunday, December 21, 2014, Gary Ewan Park notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> @vbsql7 https://github.com/vbsql7 can you confirm what version of\n> Chocolatey you are using?

Backwards compatibility with a nice deprecation message when used. :) Or we just create an alias\n. The alias would be part of this work.\n. We don't need an issue opened for tests when it is part of the rollup of something else.\n. Awesome. Thanks for catching that!\n. It was a tiny change so I just put it on stable and pushed it. Thanks again for catching the issue!\n. That's a package issue and not a chocolatey issue. Please contact the\npackage maintainers through the package page on chocolatey.org\n\nOn Thursday, July 10, 2014, mawasay notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> After installing jdk8.

This caused a major issue with chocolatey that made me yank the new release shortly after pushing it out. For reference see https://github.com/atom/chocolatey/issues/23#issuecomment-48799362\n. Will need to add some more guards around this...\n. @jberezanski I added a comment noting why we would wait the process.\n. This is a duplicate of #516 \n. It's there in 2.0, but the documentation on MSDN is misleading. Since it is a bug with 3+, I made sure we didn't hit some infinite loop waiting.\n. What bat files?\n. Aka, we don't generate bat files as of 0.9.8.24. You may want to upgrade.\n. Once you do that you can change the heading of this ticket and reopen it ;)\n. Perhaps there is  shimgen depth we can pass?\n. Done\n. It's part of integrating with other systems, like ruby gems, python and webpi. We may only have support for getting things installed.\n. @Apazman Not the same issue. Please create another issue and include debug output.\n. @brettporter I think this might be useful for chocolatey/choco as well.\n. This was implemented as part of https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/14\n. Specifically https://github.com/ferventcoder/choco/commit/10105b300c80a952b3c905f9a298bc8e86199083\n. Perhaps. This should only leave the installer alone if it finds the checksum to be the same, but it could be I introduced something else into the mix fixing what was thought to be an issue.\n. Adding checksums to your package would also be helpful.\n. When you say you cleaned up all the files, do you mean you deleted the %TEMP% files?\n. What is wonky then?\n. Definitely not clear as you said it worked in the end with a file in the temp folder (as I was attempting to clear that up).\n\nSo did it work in the end or did it fail?\n. Now I understand. Yes, big bug.\n. I think I understand what might be causing this - are pandoc 1.11 and 1.12 installer files the exact same size (get-contentlength)?\n. super big bug then :(\n. Help me out here - I'm trying to reproduce - https://gist.github.com/ferventcoder/d928b61f69d65ac7bd4e\n. Going to have to close this as not reproducible unless we get to the bottom of this. I'll need full debug output to understand what is wrong.\n. That would be super helpful.\n. I tried this with a local package and it appears to work just fine. \n\n```\nC:\\> choco install pandoc\nChocolatey (v0.9.8.28-alpha2) is installing 'pandoc' and dependencies.

Could this just be a misunderstanding of -force? If you have a package in chocolateyinstall + lib, force doesn't remove what is already there (yet).\n. Closing as non-repro\n. Likely a bug, but I'm going to need -debug output to know for sure.\n\nAlso, you should be using single tick marks surrounding, not double double quotes. Powershell doesn't handle those double quotes correctly so instead of `\"\"url;url\"\"`, try `''url;url''` (note that is two single `'` marks)\n.

Closing as not an issue unless we hear back that the adjustment did not work.\n. Remote execution is not considered supported right now.\n. Is that ALL it takes? whoa\n. Done.\n. Don't know.\n. It appears that it supports a -Version argument but that help menu is the same across all commands. We are rewriting choco in c# and the help menus are very specific.\n. I see what you mean. It is passing the help through to nuget, but choco itself doesn't support a -version option at the current time.\n. It's planned. :)\n. The intent is for you to copy that, not try to type it out yourself. The cmd.exe stuff is especially archaic and I think I've only attempted to type it out by hand maybe twice in 3 years. It's not easy, it's not fun. It's better to copy. :)\n. @tedsanders Ah, good point. Perhaps we teach people how to do that. :)\n\nRight click -> paste or set quick edit mode (right click is all you need and it pastes for you).\n\nThen once you have chocolatey installed, you install `wincommandpaste` and then you can Control+V. :)\n. Weird, I just ran exactly this without error.\n. Hmm. Run the install command like this: `choco install atom -debug -force`\nand post the output here.\n. Delete whatever is located at 'C:\\Users\\Samuel\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\chocolatey\\Atom\\AtomInstall.zip'\n. The errors you are seeing are not normal. I'm not yet sure what is causing\nit on your system as opposed to others. Can we have you move your install\nlocation to the default programdata to rule out a permissions issue with\nyour current install location?\n\nOn Saturday, July 26, 2014, Samuel Debruyn notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Same issue, every install/update seems to fail by the way.

FWIW other folks are not experiencing these issues. Due to not being reproducible, I'd like to understand what it is about your environment that is causing issues. Let me know if you experience these errors in the future when/if you reinstall.\n. think of filetype as installertype :)\n. perhaps a vagrant box?\n. Boo. Would you see this as an issue?\n. It's likely the upgrade from nuget 2.1 to nuget 2.8\n. This is fixed in choco.exe. Everything is happily in abc order again.\n. @Redsandro yeah, it gets fun. You are trying too hard to get to these VMs - you should really use vagrant - see https://github.com/ferventcoder/vagrant-windows-puppet\n. Operation timing out is weird, it shouldn't do that. You might try upgrading chocolatey to the latest version first.\n. depends on the boxes - https://vagrantcloud.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&sort=&provider=&q=windows\n. There is also a vagrant box offered by MSOpenTech. It is like 8GB packed though.\n. 4GB for Windows 2012R2 isn't bad. Mine is 4GB on both vrtualbox and vmware_fusion\n. Back to the issue at hand, what is the output of chocolatey v.27?\n. DEBUG: Running 'Get-WebHeaders' with url:'http://download.gnome.org/binaries/win32/tomboy/1.14/Tomboy-1.14.0.msi', userAgent: 'chocolatey command line'\nDEBUG: Setting the UserAgent to 'chocolatey command line'\nWrite-Error : tomboy did not finish successfully. Boo to the chocolatey gods!\n. Does it time out on HEAD?\n. Upon further investigation, the .net framework is unable to download the file for some reason. It's not just a HEAD request that times out, it's any request.\n. The 302 redirect to HTTPS... \n. Just of note, this doesn't affect PowerShell 3/4 as they use .NET Framework 4.0\n. It's Powershell v2.0 related as it uses .NET framework 2.0/3.5. Whatever issue it was seems to be fixed in newer versions of powershell, but to be sure I'm going to update to posh 3 in my vm and see if it fails.\n. Inspection with fiddler determines that the SSLv3 has a handshake failure - http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/5be893c2-b16c-4e2c-ad9a-ab4deb0c8962/ssl-handshake-failure?forum=netfxcompact\n. @Redsandro Posh v2 uses .net framework 2.\n. You are going to love the answer to this... \n. This is a bit naive implementation. What we might want to do is create a short timeout and then move to the fallback when it fails for the remainder of the run.\n. It's b/c the fallback doesn't work on .net framework v2, but it works on v4. If you look at current protocol you will see: `Ssl3, Tls`\n. Give it a shot - https://chocolatey.org/packages/chocolatey/0.9.8.28-alpha1\n. @Redsandro the undocumented way to get absolute latest:\n\n`@powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy unrestricted -Command \"iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/installabsolutelatest.ps1'))\" && SET PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\chocolatey\\bin`\n\nNote `https://chocolatey.org/installabsolutelatest.ps1`\n. Similar but not the same - you are missing a certificate that is required to allow the installation. https://chocolatey.org/docs/proxy-settings-for-chocolatey#still-having-trust-issues - we'll be moving this to a troubleshooting page.\n. That's simple, you just remove the -lo\n. I pushed this fix. `choco install chocolatey -pre`.\n. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25129232/chocolatey-cant-install-git\n. Not missing much important other than a naive implementation ensuring the name of the file.\n. I think this may be covered by another issue...?\n. Migrated to https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/435\n. There is a way to add debugging information to the installer: \n1. Download the package file from https://chocolatey.org/packages/chocolatey/0.9.8.27\n2. Unzip it (treat it as a zip file, it might help to add .zip to the end of the filename).\n3. Start up PowerShell.\n4. Type the following: \n\n``` ps\nSet-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted\n$DebugPreference = \"Continue\";\n$env:ChocolateyEnvironmentDebug = 'true'\n```\n1. Navigate to the folder you just unzipped and run\n\n``` ps\n& tools\\chocolateyInstall.ps1\n```\n. @SpeCter is this the error? \n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/chocolatey.ps1#L89-L93\n. @SpeCter Under which context did you originally set the executionpolicy?\n\nTo verify your setting, `get-executionpolicy`.\n\nIt may also provide some WTF moments, brought to you by powershell.\n. I don't know a ton about bypass other than it should bypass the current policy (passed as you startup PowerShell).\n. Alternatively, we could stop operation without a special switch\n. The first was added so that the second made sense.\n. @Redsandro It didn't, that is correct. It operated in a totally insecure way and was located in c:\\chocolatey where anyone could have messed with any file at any point. \n. You can install it to somewhere else, we are just making the default more secure.\n. right. In program data it needs a user with admin permissions to do stuff.\n. This is no bueno :(\n. > It also looks like you really don't need to pass in the zip file name because the unzip log file is based on the package name.\n\nThis change would be considered a possible security issue in implementation.\n. It's probably more so that the uninstall functionality just doesn't work appropriately.\n. @DarwinJS This is already a known issue and also already has a PR to fix it up. I've also added notes on how this would be fixed in the powershell function file related to install-chocolateypath.\n. Let's continue discussion in the actual ticket over on Choco.\n. https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/310\n. Never saw that one before.\n\nWhat gives with the folder `C:\\xampp`?\n. Is it possible that this is local to the package and thus a package issue?\n. what version of chocolatey?\n. Can I get full debug output?\n. XAMPP works on your version of Windows yes?\n. As a workaround, you can explicitly add the source at the end to call `choco update pkgname -source 'https://chocolatey.org/api/v2/'` OR call `choco install pkgname`\n. And then magically it starts to work again... total WTF\n. What version of chocolatey?\n. Please upgrade to 0.9.8.27 and tell me if the issue still exists?\n\nEverything past 0.9.8.24 is using the latest nuget.exe.\n. Closing for now, this isn't really something we want in there yet. If this is needed, I'm sure it will come up again in the new choco.\n. This was an issue previously (for about one beta release) when chocolatey was looking at nuget 2.8 output incorrectly. This was almost immediately corrected. Not sure why you are seeing it.\n. But having fiddler open while testing could cause issues. Run it with -debug and pass back the output.\n. That is actually not a bad idea, but I think folks would still have issues if they were set to restricted.\n. This could potentially move over to choco.\n. Went a different way here. Yep, I've been seeing this as well. Seems like something wonky going on with the newly included nuget.exe 2.8.2.\n\nFYI, I'm also seeing this behavior on nuget.core.\n. Seems like something went wrong with my email reply.... so here goes again:\n\nOn the mailing list I recently went through what it would take for this package to include npm. Perhaps I'll put some time to it. \n\nTo reduce confusion though, the chocolatey issues list is reserved for problems/enhancements for chocolatey, not the community maintained packages. Problems with packages should be reported directly to the maintainers. Thanks!\n. Here's the link to that message where I detailed what it would take to include npm - https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/chocolatey/IcIkfqEvxtI/zsMvlmhdQm0J\n. So... try the install now. Should also include npm.\n.

I need the output of the following commands:\n\n```\nGet-ItemProperty \"hklm:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Command Processor\"\nGet-ItemProperty \"hklm:\\Software\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Command Processor\"\nGet-ItemProperty \"hkcu:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Command Processor\"\n&where.exe cpack \ncmd\n```\n\nI think you have something set to run automatically when you start up the cmd.exe, which is causing your errors.\n. Closing this as an environmental issue until I hear back (as it appears local to your system).\n. @haf About two weeks ago I would not have known to do that either. \n. That should probably be putting ansicon somewhere with less changes.... \n. @carolynvs apologies, somehow this fell of my radar. \n- src/functions are things subject to be completely absorbed into c# and thus not open for API usage.\n- src/helpers/functions are things that are usually part of the published api (that the chocolateyinstaller.psm1 publishes) that folks can depend on being there as a powershell function.\n. This implements #307 \n. @carolynvs I went with a bit of an easier fix for now. It helps with when package maintainers are also not using our defined functions and using `$env:TEMP` in their scripts. \n. I just pushed 0.9.8.29-beta1 with the functionality in it.\n. Would be nice right? Yeah, we need the client to understand when it can't reach the server... I think it says right now that the site is unreachable in debug output?\n. @Redsandro I know you well enough now to know you almost always are in jest. :)\n\n> PS - The :poop: was a joke, not a flame.\n\nShould have said:\nPS - The :poop: was a joke, not a defecation.\n. This is already done in the C# rewrite...\n. - You are on an older version of chocolatey. Please upgrade and see if this is still an issue.\n1. I've never seen that happen before (installing the wrong package). Ever. It could have been an Issue with your source (I've never seen private.feed.ca), which explains a problem. Do you trust that source? \n2. I don't think there is a bug in the matching algorithm, I think it's related to that feed doing something completely wonky.\n\nPerhaps the client should do a better job with feeds, but the problem here is with the feed doing the wrong thing, not with chocolatey doing the wrong thing. \n\nLet's update this issue a bit to something more workable regarding the client doing an id match versus what was requested.\n. What I'd need from you is a -debug output and fiddler output.\n. Might want to make sure it is https://plus.google.com/+RobReynolds_FerventCoder/ \n. That's not really a good looking error at all. :-1: \n\nAny chance you would run with `-debug` and post output here?\n. Also, this may or may not have to do with a fresh install of the .net framework. It can get finicky after just being installed and sitting on a pending reboot and refuse to cooperate. So it might just need a reboot?\n. Don't have a tag for not reproducible... \n. windows--\n. I recently changed it to installertype. That was my bad, changing it before\nthe source code catches up.

Chocolatey is in beta, and by v1 it won't need to have an uninstall script except for areas where folks want/need to do extra work. \n\nFor the most part, most packages don't do more than the native installer does, so simply going to programs and features and removing the software removes it from the machine, one just needs to also remember to remove the package files.\n. Would you rather work be put into this or into making it unnecessary?\n. Ah, but if they don't do anything outside of chocolatey install boundaries, choco uninstall cleans it right up. This is the case of atom (except maybe the desktop shortcut).\n. MinGW and CygWin I can see needing something to help cleanup, but I am not familiar with cwrsync.\n. Agreed. This will get better. My hope has always been to be able to inspect the chocolatey install and see what was done and do the opposite in some respects. \n. @JVimes perhaps you can help me on that. I don't know that I ever changed the default value of .txt files, but I don't have the context menu entries for new files in Windows 2012R2. I wonder if it was removed?\n. Don't worry about the appveyor failure. It's going to fail for awhile methinks...\n. There are some tests that seem to fail in that environment. I need to get to the bottom of those.\n. https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ferventcoder/chocolatey/build/1.0.5  - would be neat to see the test output show up but it is not adding the test output file for some reason.\n. @gep13 I thought I could just use artifacts but apparently not...\n. @mwrock Right. That's what I was trying to say before. The failures are not related to your pull request, so feel free to ignore those.\n. Duplicate of https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/5\n. > This is a general query about apt-like functionality that I can't find. Either I've missed it or the query will evolve into some enhancement requests ;)\n\nIt's possible some or all of this isn't included due to differences between Chocolatey and Windows versus Debian and *nix.\n\n> With the choco update command, is it possible to do some/any of the following?\n> 1. get an indication before downloading how much will be downloaded\n\nUnfortunately most packages only contain instructions on where to go download items from the official distribution point. Chocolatey operates without the need for `-y` presently, so it's hard to see ahead of time without adding in a switch. It would also need to download the packages themselves to get an indication of what they are going to need to download prior to giving an accurate estimate. Some packages contain everything they need though, so it makes it hard to get an exact indication without downloading some packages. I think it's possible this could be implemented though, but probably not by v1.\n\n> 2 failing that, get an indication before downloading which packages will be updated\n\nAdding in an indication is definitely possible, but I think that chocolatey first needs to be able to update package indexes.\n\n> 3 interrupt a download and resume later\n\nI could see this at some point, but probably not by v1. \n\n> 4 request a download only (no installation)\n\nThis definitely needs to be written down as a feature. Plans are in mind to implement this in the rewrite, but I'm not sure it's been added as a feature.\n\n> 5 install from a previous download only (don't attempt to download at all - \"offline mode\")\n\nIt already does this as of 0.9.8.24.\n\n> 6 get a report of release notes for downloaded packages (ok, this is a feature of apt-listchanges not core apt :)\n\nInteresting. This is definitely something that could be added. Probably after v1 though.\n. Done, but over here https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/releases.atom\n. Agreed.\n. I wonder if the chocolateyInstall.ps1 is swallowing the error... \n. @warnergodfrey @bmedlin I believe this was just fixed by @mwrock  in a recent PR.\n. #658 \n. @mwrock where would you put that bit of code?\n. @mwrock nevermind, found a good spot. :)\n. Where did you get `\\` in front of `@powershell` ?\n. Please move this over to https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org\n. awesome! \n. Actually we put in a fix just to address a bug in PS v3 with not waiting processes...\n. It's possible it's something in there that is messed up? https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/516\n. No, it appears #516 caused this issue :)\n. it's already done in the rewrite.\n. #595 #253 \n. @Stanzilla it's not yet FOSS but it will be soon.\n. Closing as a duplicate.\n. This isn't exactly a duplicate but yeah. \n. This looks like a package issue. It seems like it would be much better served to make the comment on the disqus thread on the package page itself for others who may run into this issue?\n. @smikims packages can change environment variables. If they have an underlying installer they can do just about anything.\n. Ahhh virus scanners. You can't live with them, you can't live without them. :/\n. I wonder if we could get something there that allows it to wait on a lock...\n. This won't be fixed in powershell. The posh version is at its limit. The new c# version is almost done.\n. @fibric We'll see if this remains an issue once the new c# version comes out. I expect many of the logged issues to just close as non-issues once that happens. This may be one of them.\n. @Stanzilla Repo is not publicly available yet. For ETA, I'd suggest signing up for the newsletter. :)\n. This looks like a problem with the package itself. Please follow up on the package page at https://chocolatey.org/packages/xampp\n. Need a debug log. \n\nCall with `-debug`\n. Uninstall has .... ...issues. :/ The order of execution in the POSH chocolatey could be part of the issue... \n. It looks like this has broken some tests. https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ferventcoder/chocolatey/build/1.0.37\n. Also, we have a rewrite coming... I wouldn't suggest pursuing this any further as it will be deprecated in a few weeks for something that works so much better.\n. > ShimGen is non-free proprietary software: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/master/src/tools/shimgen.license.txt\n\nIt's possible that it could later be offered as a standalone product. I do doubt that it will be a free product though. At the current time we are wanting to see more folks making packages to take advantage of it. \n. If you want to play with this, there is a prerelease https://chocolatey.org/packages/chocolatey/0.9.8.29-alpha1\n. So it works if it finds the path. However the working directory of shimgen doesn't find it appropriately :/\n. > choco install cygwin -debug -overrideArgs '-q -R C:\\tools\\cygwin\n> -l C:\\tools\\cygwin\\packages -s http://mirrors.kernel.org/sourceware/cygwin'\n\nOverrideArgs is a switch, it just means ONLY use what I pass in for InstallArgs (if documentation is confusing, please let us know how to make it better).\n\nIf you take a look at the files section of the package http://chocolatey.org/packages/cygwin, you can see what Chocolatey does. \n\nYou need to run the command like `choco install cygwin -debug -overrideArgs -installArgs '-q -R C:\\tools\\cygwin -l C:\\tools\\cygwin\\packages -s http://mirrors.kernel.org/sourceware/cygwin'`\nto make it work correctly.\n. I'm going to close this as not an issue, if you feel the docs need work though to better explain, please make further comments and I will reopen it as a documentation issue.\n. It also works for me, but you do have a good point. It should be attempting from https now that we are no longer subject to SNI.\n. Are you subject to a proxy at all?\n. No worries, thanks for following up! \n. Thanks, I think we should have grabbed this but apparently I missed it. I will see what we can work up in new choco.\n. That is not the correct reason we chose to move it. It was related to CVEs\nthat were never made public. It had nothing to do with folks that do not\nknow how to call the right functions. When stuff fails do to folks not\nknowing how to properly call for admin access, the packages should properly\nfail.\n\nI'm not really sure how you came to that conclusion as the reason but I've\nnever stated as much and I've never heard anyone on the team state as much\neither.\n\nRegarding the CVE - The old default install location has too many\nprivileges that allows anyone to make changes to pkg installers or do other\nnasty stuff if they get access to a box. There were some other CVEs related\nto domain poisoning that we've also fixed.\n\nFurther, the old posh version of choco is ending with a new version that is\nfaster and more stable. Not sure if you have seen that yet. You may want to\nsign up for the newsletter if you have not.\n\nOnce we get the security stuff ironed out, the plan is to allow easier\nnon-admin installations again. But it must be done in a way that is secure\nfor that user and not open to package security issues like before.\n\nOn Saturday, October 4, 2014, Julian Easterling notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> That has been a sticking point for me as well recently...

It is a bit annoying to see \n. > Given that Chocolatey is still not a 1.0 product and that I have not seen the new rewrite yet, and to be honest, I'm still waiting to see what the OneGet project does; however, I will sign up for the newsletter as the chocolatey project has made package management on Windows systems much closer to the same experience I have under the Ubuntu systems I manage.\n\nOneGet is a package manager aggregator.

Let me know if it doesn't work. It should. I haven't tried a `choco install chocolatey --version 0.9.8.32 --force`\n. Although doing exactly that seems to have worked for me.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/63502/5939944/3173a52e-a6cd-11e4-9c87-a6271417cffc.png)\n. Interestingly enough, I would have thought there would be more output from the install.\n. Show me the chocolateyInstall.ps1 file? \n\nI think you need to remove the $url64 completely.\n. It's a bug then... \n. Curious about the actual PATH - like in the registry or in Control Panel -> System.\nBoth PowerShell and Cmd.exe are very limited in their ability to refresh environment variables. \n. This is fixed by https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/303 I believe, and further fixed by https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/699\n. Yep, it's because you call chocolatey, it starts a child session of cmd.exe then powershell.exe - and that gets updated. Which works appropriately if you are installing something that depends on something else being on the path because during that session everything is updated. \n. To see it on your path in posh, you need to exit and come back in. We are working on getting `Update-Session` where you can call it for updating your environment as well.\n. We are going to be adding a module for update-sessonenvironment so you can do this in powershell. Look for that over in https://github.com/chocolatey/choco\n. I'd prefer it be compatible all the way back to posh v2 unless there is some requirement to be with posh v3+\n. Closed by updating all three locations.\n. This may be a dupe\n. #253 \n. Yikes, yeah. The benefit of putting downloads stuff in the temp folder is that the bigger stuff goes away with cleaning the temp folder out.\n\nHowever the packages (lib) folder will start to get smaller with one package version in/one out for upgrades and stuff. In choco rewrite this is the default.\n. Closed as a duplicate. Sorry, mentioned that awhile ago. Just doing some issue triage and noticed it was still open. \n. Appreciate the thoughts. However we are rewriting chocolatey, which is why we ask in contributing that you contact us first to get buy off on a feature before you start working on it. \n\nThis looks like an interesting feature though. I'd like to get some input on it later as it relates to the rewrite (which is c#).\n. I think ultimately being able to do an install from a web server with an open index should be doable.\n. So I am curious. Is it causing problems or more just an annoyance?\n. We are rewriting chocolatey as an exe so you won't have any bats that are subject to this issue. :)\n. #602 closes this. Thanks!\n. Thanks! \n. @kaiaie what version of posh do you have installed on Win2008?\n\nAlso, we tweaked an issue with this in the current release (released a few hours ago - 0.9.8.28) - it's possible that you won't see the process id issues on the latest version.\n. It looks like it is erroring on the line that tries to wait the process if it is still running (which has a try catch) but I think it might actually be something else. It's hard to say. \n. What happens if you try to install the app without chocolatey in the equation on one of the failing systems?\n. I believe I just fixed this - It will be testable in choco 0.9.9-rc8 and above.\n. @cleung2010 I see how this may look like a similar issue but it doesn't appear to be. You may want to remove the try catch from around the chocolatey script so you get a better handle on where the error is occurring. It looks like something in the package itself. Also any issues with choco belong at https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues, not over here. Thanks!\n. @cleung2010 thanks, I will follow up over there.\n. @lmayorga1980 try `-ia` - that's the short version of installargs\n. That is a command/batch issue and will not exist in the new compiled version of choco. It's an annoyance at best, but it is an issue with using batch files. The underlying process gets orphaned, but it still knows about it, so it keeps asking if you want to terminate the process.\n\nYou can observe this behavior by pulling up Process Explorer (Sysinternals)\n. Other tools that use .cmd/.bat files that call out to executables will display this same behavior.\n\nI'm closing this as a non-issue. A message would be good, but this issue should not exist in the new version of choco.exe.\n. There you go, XML code. ;)\n. I think this may be similar to #589 and #544\n. Calling this closed as a duplicate, plus I think it is fixed in choco.exe.\n. Import the `chocolateyInstaller.psm1` file in %chocolateyinstall%\\chocolateyinstall\\helpers\n. @svnpenn `#3` is no longer an issue with choco.exe, it works now. The creating packages story is starting to get smoother, expect more plus ups this winter. Of course choco.exe needs to get finished....\n. No you are good. The rewrite stuff isn't out yet. There isn't anything public to play with. We are going to FOSS it soon.\n. @lonniev raise a new issue for that please. Thanks! \n. 1. create `chocolateyInstall.ps1`\n2. call choco install `pkg.nuspec` --force\n. FYI - https://github.com/chocolatey/choco\n. @jmbeach Howdy. It looks like you are missing something. However if you want to follow up, let's do that over at https://github.com/chocolatey/choco.. That answers the question. Uninstall is very naive. Recommend you would uninstall prior to upgrade or wait for the c# version which will be out soon. It does a much better job of handling older versions, upgrades and uninstalls.\n. That's an interesting issue. This looks like it might be something with https://github.com/chocolatey/puppet-chocolatey though. Thoughts?\n. Can you run that with --debug --verbose --trace and post the output?\n. ```\n==> default: Wrapped exception:\n==> default: Execution of 'C:\\ProgramData\\chocolatey\\chocolateyInstall\\chocolatey.cmd install siteminder -version 12.51 -ia \"-f C:\\Temp\\siteminder-12.51-win64.properties\" -source http://myserver/nuget' returned 1: Chocolatey (v0.9.8.28) is installing 'siteminder' and dependencies.

Lots of [search results](https://www.google.com/search?q=Second+path+fragment+must+not+be+a+drive+or+UNC+name&oq=Second+path+fragment+must+not+be+a+drive+or+UNC+name&aqs=chrome..69i57&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=119&ie=UTF-8), particularly this one about using `c:\\` - http://gayotfow.wordpress.com/2014/04/27/second-path-fragment-must-not-be-a-drive-or-unc-name/\n\nI think it has to do with your install args from the looks of things. Thoughts?\n. @lmayorga1980 I think this might be fixed in the new choco, but the puppet provider would need to be updated first...\n. Yup - https://chocolatey.org/docs/features-automatically-recompile-packages\n. This is closed by https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/108\n. when you run with -debug, where does this fail?\n. This looks actually to be more of an issue with the current PHP package. The download link doesn't work for me. \n\nAre you experiencing this issue with other packages or just this one?\n. Oh no - it is a package issue, the original download link works. But unfortunately the package itself attempts to check there prior to going to the archives folder. Which would work if it were there.\n. Take a look here: https://chocolatey.org/packages/php#files - I posted this over at https://github.com/ferventcoder/chocolatey-packages/issues/38\n\nI'm going to close this as not a chocolatey issue. Please followup on the package issue itself.\n. @gep13 no proxy for you I'm afraid. Not something I would have immediately thought to look at either.\n. This repository is for issues with Chocolatey itself. This seems like a package issue. Please follow up directly with those folks through the contact maintainers page on chocolatey.org - https://chocolatey.org/packages/atom OR you can take a shortcut and file the issue here: https://github.com/atom/chocolatey/issues\n. Try this instead - choco install chocolatey\n. Not sure why but sometimes it gets a bit weird about version differences.\n. This is a duplicate of #122 \n. I'm thinking a file named something like `.bins` that points to a relative path in the package where all of the exe/batch files are. If found, choco will only evaluate this file (but `.gui` and `.ignore` files will still be used).\n. Actually scratch that name, nuget [has a bug](https://nuget.codeplex.com/workitem/4285) on names of files/folders that start with dot `.`. It's a really stupid limitation, I don't remember if we override it with choco.exe or not.\n. @jberezanski agreed. \n\nAnd I think ultimately extending the nuspec schema. We are definitely going in that direction.\n. sure why not... \n.

Merged into stable at https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/commit/9947bae570efaf4d34027f53e3f371fab6328cd3\n. Is this a docs issue? I don't see this as a code issue. For matters such as this, it is a much better avenue to use the discussion list - chocolatey at googlegroups dot com.\n. @030 move `/disablepush` further to the left. \n. This is a duplicate of probably a few items. Uninstall is stupidly naive. We are rewriting choco and it doesn't suffer from this. \n. That said, you can just keep calling the uninstall or go to the folder and manually remove those items for now.\n. Duplicate of #389 \n. Apologies if I don't give you a direct answer but after answering the question several times already (all are searchable and readily readable) - I think we just need to document it on the wiki.\n. Also, questions work out much better on the mailing list - chocolatey at googlegroups dot com.\n. You can, if you provide a custom override for write-host. We do... that's how we log the output.\n. https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/helpers/functions/Write-Host.ps1\n. https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/helpers/functions/Write-Debug.ps1\n. https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/helpers/functions/Write-Error.ps1\n. See #416 and #411 \n. Closing as a duplicate\n. You are using an older npm. It is now bundled with Msi and newer versions\nare not released separately.

Interesting. I'm really impressed with that latest design. It has less of a blocky feel.\n\nSome things I like:\n- It captures the essence of a package that is being unwrapped to get to the inside, it's what's inside the package that counts.\n- The design is smooth. This signifies the process is a smooth transition from one state to another.\n- It's simple but not over simplistic. This signifies another essence of choco. A tool that is super simple to use and create packages with.\n- I think you are really starting to capture the essence of Chocolatey (as I described above).\n\nSome things I'd like you to keep thinking about:\n- It should show a transition of moving from non-real to very real in a sense that you go from a concept of \"choco install\" to having real software on your machine.\n- I'm not in love with the package wrapper color. Would prefer some contrast between the chocolatey goodness in the wrapper but somewhat darker on the wrapping. Should still really stand out against a black background.\n- I'm not sure about the skew. It's interesting and I think I'm starting to like it, but trying to determine if it adds or takes away from the design. I think it adds but I'm still chewing on it a bit.\n\nFor the packages themselves, I feel that this design would be too much/too long. So perhaps an icon that is necessary as well. Some key points for an icon:\n- It should be square.\n- Still captures the essence of unwrapping a package to get to the goodness inside.\n- Is simple but not over-simplistic.\n- No letters, numbers or words. Should stand out as an icon alone.\n- Looks good at 16x16 all the way up to 512x512. \n- Maybe the current icon captures that already?\n. updated my last set of comments a bit. @juliankrispel This is looking really good!\n. Make the C white?\n. @juliankrispel can you render the last image with a colon so we can get a side by side? https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/640#issuecomment-70228696\n. @juliankrispel color of the wrapping - The lighter color on https://chocolatey.org \n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/63502/5837853/844f9238-a148-11e4-9d49-514df965d238.png)\n. I missed mentioning it but I showed your designs to my wife and kids and they also preferred `#8` then `#6`. \n. We have plans for a redesign of the site - https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org/issues/149 - your last image fits right in there, although some of that will break out to other pages.\n. I'm digging `#8` with the white `Chocolatey` - I also like `#6` quite a bit.

Awesome. Thanks for understanding. I'm trying to understand why you would want to remove traces of the install. We have similar packages that only run once, but you keep them around in case there are updates to the packages and you want to deploy that new functionality out.\n. Pending discussion a PR may be issued against new choco.\n. > I also noticed that even though the Kickstarter is funded and closed, that you have sold very few of the larger business pledges.\n\nI think this is mostly in part due to a short 30 day window, no guarantee that the kickstarter was going to be successful (until about 3 days out when it funded), businesses usually want to remain private, and most businesses go through a PO to do amounts over $1,000 (the PO process is usually longer than 10 days - they are not going to do it through a kickstarter). \n\nWould you guys have funded with your name on the public backers page and been able to do so with a credit card (not a PO)? That question is mostly curiosity, because most of the businesses I talked to indicated one or more of the above.\n. I wouldn't hold much water in the low amount of business licenses sold. I'd reserve that for when we have a billing system set up and what the potential is going to be. I'd imagine that we are going to see a few that I probably won't be able to name. :)\n. > Would it be possible to go for one of these pledges even though the Kickstarter is closed?\n\nUnfortunately, once a Kickstarter is over, you can't back the project. However next summer we will have a system set up for accepting payments and generating licenses. \n. A chocolatey package != install something\n. That's my first response. I will want to consider a bit more based on your example.\n. installing a package gets misinterpreted as only \"installing\" software on a machine, but it can also make configuration changes (which I believe you are defining as .run packages).\n. The question being, if you applied a configuration, how would you know it happened if you deleted the package?\n\nUpdate - What I mean is, if you have a large range of computers and you want to know which ones were successful and which ones were not applying a configuration, what would you need to do to see it happened? \n\nAlso, how does dpkg/rpm handle this concept now?\n. Concept of pinning packages prevents automatic upgrade of those packages.\n. Also, I wouldn't necessarily look at the community feed (chocolatey.org) as the end all be all of how most businesses use choco. The simple fact is that many, many of them NEVER hit the community feed. They are doing things somewhat differently with the packages they create, including binaries much more often and setting up configurations (so they can replace GPO). Sometimes folks couple those configurations with a configuration management tool like Puppet (config management means any change to the configuration of a computer, including settings and software). Chocolatey plugs right in as a package manager provider to Puppet.\n. I'm not dismissing this one straight off. Just trying to understand how it is different and necessary over just the normal concept of normal packages that do some configuration tasks.\n. That's :<\n. https://github.com/chocolatey/shimgen/issues/5\n. This is seen when chocolatey is being used with Windows 2003.\n. Definitely should stay with equals if possible.\n. perhaps. How does on PR wiki docs?\n. Can this be closed?\n. Does it have issues if you have `<cacheLocation></cacheLocation>` set? The intention is not for it to be removed.\n. No need. This will be completely unnecessary due to new codebase that\noverrides this. The logic in this codebase may be a bit naive, yes.\n\nOn Thursday, January 8, 2015, Glenn notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> If you add in the empty tag then no error is thrown.\n> In my case when I upgraded chocolatey from x.28 to x.30 it was missing.\n> However I could be experiencing a one-off error.\n> \n> While this has a low probability of occuring and the workaround is fairly\n> simple, I feel the logic error still needs attention;\n> - If the cacheLocation tag should _always_ be in the config file, then\n>   the error 'Write-Error : A configuration value for cacheLocation was not\n>   found' should be terminal and perhaps steps how to fix it be presented to\n>   the user\n> \n> or\n> - If it is _possible_ that the cacheLocation tag to not exist, then\n>   the case of $cacheLocation of being $null should be handled in the code as\n>   per one of my proposals.\n> \n> I realise this is a low priority issue, so I'm happy to make the changes\n> and submit a PR for it.\n> Also happy to write some pester tests for it.\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/657#issuecomment-69281884\n> .\n\n## \n\nRob\n\"Be passionate in all you do\"\n\nhttp://devlicio.us/blogs/rob_reynolds\nhttp://ferventcoder.com\nhttp://twitter.com/ferventcoder\n.

I will likely go ahead on this one.\n. This looks like a fix for #568 (ha, transposed! Wild!)\n. Merged into stable at https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/commit/bcea921831373864a908f4d48e8fbd0c390bd2b6\n. Released as well a little while ago.\n. Duplicate of #568\n. That's the problem. Get-ToolsRoot is really the name of this. It's horrrrrribly named.\n. The problem is that the terminology of the command is so bad, you and many others have identified it as essentially the same location as `c:\\programdata\\chocolatey\\bin` when in fact it represents something else entirely.\n. There is a concept of a place where you can install tools due to two reasons - \n1) current POSH choco putting version numbers on folders and \n2) folks want a place on the system out of the choco folders where they can put tools.\n\nThis is basically a location that a user can specify as `ToolsRoot`. \n\nNow muddy that up and call it `BinRoot` instead.\n. Do we need a bin root? Or is it that choco is not doing a sufficient job in some cases?\n. > I don't know. I prefer a non-shimmed binRoot for command line tools\n\nThis is what I'm curious about. Is it the older shims that were batch files? Is it performance? What hesitations do you have? Brutal honesty is fine here.\n. Tools (or portables) in this context refers to the actual software that does not come with a native installer, which is like git for windows portable zip compared to git for windows install. If software is offered as an archive of some sort in addition to or instead of through an installer - that is what is meant by \"tools.\" We actually have a pretty extensive definition of portables vs install in the context of chocolatey in the faq on the wiki.\n. @CMCDragonkai Shim, not symlink. And no, only executables found in the package directory will be shimmed automatically. Anything else that one wants to shim, they would need to use `Install-BinFile`.\n\nReferences:\n- https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/HelpersReference\n. This is fixed in choco with https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/631\n. The next upgrade is going to automatically move choco, I've just finished\ntesting that code. Hmm, what we could do is have you set an environment\nvariable that it would explicitly look for and not do the move.

THere are other options for install. - Can you take a look at those as a workaround for now? https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/Installation\n. Download the package, unzip it (https://chocolatey.org/api/v2/package/chocolatey/) In the tools folder is a chocolateyInstall.ps1, run it with PowerShell. If it doesn't work, you likely have not met the requirements.\n. For full instructions, I added the following: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/Installation#download--powershell-method\n. It's looking for `$env:SystemDrive` coming back with C: and then giving you a message that Drive C doesn't exist. \n. Actually this is even more interesting. It happens before that - \n\n``` powershell\n$toolsPath = (Split-Path -parent $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Definition)\n\n# ensure module loading preference is on\n$PSModuleAutoLoadingPreference = \"All\";\n\n$modules = Get-ChildItem $toolsPath -Filter *.psm1\n$modules | ForEach-Object {\n    $psm1File = $_.FullName;\n    $moduleName = $([System.IO.Path]::GetFileNameWithoutExtension($psm1File))\n    remove-module $moduleName -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue;\n    import-module -name  $psm1File;\n}\n\nInitialize-Chocolatey\n```\n\nFor some reason it doesn't recognize the $psm1File path.\n. Here's what I want you to do. Edit that `chocolateyInstall.ps1` to be:\n\n``` powershell\n$toolsPath = (Split-Path -parent $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Definition)\n\nWrite-Output \"`$toolsPath = $toolsPath\"\n# ensure module loading preference is on\n$PSModuleAutoLoadingPreference = \"All\";\n\n$modules = Get-ChildItem $toolsPath -Filter *.psm1\n$modules | ForEach-Object {\n    $psm1File = $_.FullName;\n    Write-Output \"`$psm1File = $psm1File\"\n    $moduleName = $([System.IO.Path]::GetFileNameWithoutExtension($psm1File))\n    remove-module $moduleName -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue;\n    import-module -name  $psm1File;\n}\n\nInitialize-Chocolatey\n```\n\nRun that and put the results back in this ticket please.\n. Do you have any idea why it is searching for C?\n\nThis seems a powershell issue, not a chocolatey issue. It seems like it wants to import the module to somewhere on the C drive (which may not exist).\n\nI'd also like the output of `$env:SystemDrive` from those machines.\n\nAlso, are those drives local drives or network mapped drives? You can't use network mapped drives without setting proper permissions for .Net. That is out of the context of this issue for me to explain that one - https://www.google.com/webhp?ie=UTF-8#q=.net%20permissions%20network%20share\n. If it is a network mapped drive, you will need to set permissions appropriately, some helpful articles:\n- https://www.sellsbrothers.com/posts/Details/1519\n- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3718697/nant-failing-with-bad-permissions-on-build-server\n- http://blogs.msdn.com/b/shawnfa/archive/2004/12/30/344554.aspx\n. Sounds like first you need to fix `$env:SystemDrive` to the proper system drive. It should have been done based on the way the computer had the system drive moved.\n\nThat is an environment variable and when wrong can affect quite a few things.\n. I am curious if `F:` and `S:` drives are network mapped drives. Trying to run code from there without the proper trust set up is going to cause you issues. It's possible you haven't hit those yet due to your first issue.\n. Hmmm, that's no bueno. I think we'll want you to jump on choco.exe as soon as we have a beta available. Until then you could set the $env:PSModulePath explicitly in chocolatey.cmd as part of starting it up. It will only affect chocolatey while it is running.\n. I'm not sure if this is is still affected in the c# version. If you find this is still the case, please open an issue over at https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/new and reference this issue. Thanks! \n. Duplicate of https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/568\n. #658 implements a fix for that.\n. You went global - @mwrock went script - https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/658\n. Hmm... Do you think folks will want a 0.9.8.x along with the new choco\nclient at 0.9.9?\n\nOn Tuesday, January 20, 2015, Rich Siegel notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> I would love to see one of these 2 go in as it has required me to fork for\n> internal use.

Closing this to prefer #658.\n. Path persisted or local shell path?\n. Do you know if these packages that are being installed/updated are using Install-ChocolateyPath? \n. I could see an issue with the way it would expand registry values on update. I did some work recently to keep that from happening in other tool. I plan to bring back some of that to choco as well.\n. I'll close for now. Feel free to open a new issue and reference this (or just comment here again) if you run into this issue again. \n. Thanks for the follow up! \n. If you are in cmd.exe and not powershell you can type `refreshenv`\n. Chocolatey comes with a batch file named the above and will query the registry and reset all of your environment variables.\n. Perhaps we need more documentation surrounding that.\n. It's an issue with Windows inability to refresh shells. It doesn't have\nanything to do with choco itself. Now that that is it off the way,\nrefreshenv is a stop gap for choco to keep you from having to close and\nreopen your cmd window. Its also mostly undocumented. The recommendation is\nthat you close and reopen your shell.\nYou can also do PowerShell if you call &\nc:\\programdata\\chocolatey\\chocolateyinstall\\helpers\\Update-Session.ps1 (the\npath may not be exactly right but you get the idea)- it may require\nimporting the module first and then calling update-session.\n\nOn Tuesday, January 27, 2015, Andy Li notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Is it possible to get RefreshEnv to work in powershell too?\n> If it cannot, there should be a warning message if RefreshEnv is used in\n> powershell instead of a silent fail.\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/666#issuecomment-71639225\n> .\n\n## \n\nRob\n\"Be passionate in all you do\"\n\nhttp://devlicio.us/blogs/rob_reynolds\nhttp://ferventcoder.com\nhttp://twitter.com/ferventcoder\n.

Yes, they are. But anything they do with respect to environment vars only\nlasts during that choco run. Once it comes back to the shell, all child\nprocess changes are gone. It would be an egregious security issue with\nWindows if child processes did more than they do to the parent process.\n\nI'm giving you an option for updating your environment variables. Also\nundocumented and not supported. Ymmv. Remember, you can just close and\nreopen your shell as well.\n\nOn Tuesday, January 27, 2015, Andy Li notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Umm..

I see those images fine? \n. Thanks.\n. Will be fixing in chocolatey/choco\n. Well apparently the commit didn't close this but https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/AutomaticPackages#testing-ketarinchocopkgup and https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/AutomaticPackages/_compare/5701cb8178cb7449de3c6fcc6d3f6efca03ddc09...6f6e97c164a85a556cb7fbab81b4246adde24947\n. https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/blob/master/src/chocolatey.resources/helpers/functions/Write-ChocolateySuccess.ps1 ( still need to remove it from https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/blob/master/src/chocolatey.resources/helpers/functions/Write-ChocolateyFailure.ps1 ) \n. Note that these fixes are in the NEW repo. This repo is currently being deprecated. https://github.com/chocolatey/choco\n. This is closed now with https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/commit/eed1f5df88a94da88a930340b3226d97db5e4626\n. It is updated. See for yourself by adding the following to your chocolateyInstall.ps1:\n\n``` powershell\nWrite-Host $env:PSModulePath\nUpdate-SessionEnvironment\nWrite-Host $env:PSModulePath\n```\n\nNow, once chocolatey EXITS and you come back to your shell (which is likely powershell), $env:PSModulePath is whatever the shell was started with + any changes you have explicitly set.\n\nIf you want `Update-SessionEnvironment` to work, you need to import the chocolateyInstaller.psm1 module into your current shell session and call `Update-SessionEnvironment`. \n\nHTH.\n. For clarity, this is not a chocolatey issue, this is is how child processes work on Windows. They have limited abilities to affect their parent process, which we can all agree is a good thing based on security issues that having that ability would create.\n. Also a duplicate of https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/666\n. I think part of the problem is that you believe that chocolatey is meant to be invoked from PowerShell because it is written in PowerShell and it's not meant to be a powershell module/script. It's a tool that can be executed from any shell. Let's be completely clear - this chocolatey is written in POSH. It is within days of being deprecated for choco (https://github.com/chocolatey/choco) which is written in C# and has a posh install provider. \n\nIt's entirely possible that we will include a module that you can add to your profile that will give you this behavior. \n. Duplicate of https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/577\n. By the way, already fixed and already out in 0.9.8.28+\n. Wrong repository. https://github.com/chocolatey/choco\n. But also, warnings are a good lead to what may later be an error. Warnings are usually information sake and may require action. Errors mean bad things.\n. Where is this? Thanks in advance!\n. Ah, just the shims. Sweet. Yeah I will get that fixed.\n. This was handled in https://github.com/chocolatey/shimgen/issues/9\n. Ping @dschinkel \n. It's been a few weeks. @dschinkel please feel free to comment on this issue or raise another one if you have more information. \n. That's interesting. I think we can make it happen, but not with this Chocolatey. Let's move this issue over to https://github.com/chocolatey/choco.\n. Wrong repository - there is already an API using OData.\n. Sorry for such a short answer. A question like this is better suited for the mailing list. If you want to learn more about the API, search for NuGet package metadata API.\n\nIf you still need to file an issue for enhancement, please do so on https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org\n. Just a quick mention. Some of these are already covered as\nissues/enhancements over at https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org.\nWould you mind subscribing/commenting on the existing issues and creating\nissues for the enhancements you can't find?\n\nAnd we can close this ticket as wrong repository.\n\nOn Tuesday, February 17, 2015, Christian Rondeau notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> As a developer and heavy user of Chocolatey - especially due to the\n> ability to choco update all - I'd like to contribute to upgrading\n> packages that are not maintained, or simply not updated \"fast enough\".\n> \n> Many packages, such as ChromeDriver2\n> https://chocolatey.org/packages/ChromeDriver2, do not reference a\n> GitHub repository with the NuGet and PowerShell source files, so it is\n> impossible for users like me to \"help\" other than poking the official\n> package maintainer.\n> \n> I think it would be greatly useful to _force_ package maintainers to\n> provide a public repository, therefore allowing pull requests and\n> potentially reducing the workload of the maintainer.\n> \n> This is related to issue #308\n> https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/308, and partially\n> covered in issue #342\n> https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/342\n> \n> Here are a few other ideas that could reduce this problem; let me know if\n> you'd like me to create several issues, as they all try to solve the same\n> problem.\n> - Ability to flag a package as outdated.

You are not supposed to uninstall - that is for when you are removing\nchocolatey completely. You should just upgrade as normal - as instructed\neverywhere else.

Fixing. Also, log issues over at chocolatey/choco repo please.\n. This was also mentioned in https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/216 & https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/215\n. Whoops @ShaneIsrael wrong repo. Please open at https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues (link to this and close this one)\n. Wrong repo - duplicate of https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/64\n. Please open this in https://github.com/chocolatey/choco \n. Closing as not applicable - you already found the proper place to post the issue though\n. @hifriend21 do you have PowerShell installed?\n. Type `where.exe powershell` after updating your path locally like you did.\n\nIf it comes up with nothing, you need to ensure you install powershell first.\n. ~~Windows 7 - it should be there by default, but you can disable the Windows Feature.~~\n. Nevermind, scratch that. Not sure how you disable/remove it. Unless you lite the install.\n. Debug is a switch, not something that accepts parameters. Basically you are saying `choco install cyg-get -y --debug` AND `choco install 1 -y --debug`.\n. This is because we allow you to state `choco install cyg-get git notepadplusplus`\n. No worries. Try to log any future issues over at chocolatey/choco. You can also hop into gitter if you want to determine if you are seeing an issue or not.\n. https://github.com/chocolatey/choco\n. https://gitter.im/chocolatey/choco\n. Wrong repository. This goes to either chocolatey/choco, or most correctly to chocolatey/chocolatey.org\n. Here's the issue technically - the site was under heavy load and so things were timing out and it was returning the 404 HTML page as the zip. You will know, the zip will be about 5KB and if you rename it to .html you will see the error page html in a text editor.\n\nHowever yesterday at 17:00 PM CDT I put in a new caching strategy and increased the timeout to nearly remove this from happening in the future.\n. You should delete the file and give it a shot now.\n. I put this over on https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org/issues/236 and I will capture all of the technical details there.\n. Try removing pre when you call for a specific version. Does that work?\n. Thanks for the followup! \n. @magmax all future requests should go over to chocolatey/choco by the way. :)\n. Please file a request with the maintainers. This is not the place for package issues. Only if there is an issue with Chocolatey itself. Thanks!\n. We shut it off completely at one point, but must have missed it during the rewrite when we moved to NuGet.Core. I'll file an issue there.\n. Moved to  https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/479\n. Howdy! This appears to he an issue with the package itself?\n. yes, use `--force`. If it also fails, you can look for skip. `-n` - See `choco uninstall -h` for options.\n. By the way, all future requests should go to chocolatey/choco repository. Thanks!\n. Thanks for filing this issue. However I believe you wanted to file it at https://github.com/chocolatey/choco?\n. No worries, I was trying to find the already created issue\n. This has been raised. I believe they are the same root cause.\n. Maybe not, thought it might be related to https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/466, but perhaps it is https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/262. \n\nI see you just raised https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/497\n. Can you explain the problem a bit more? What are you seeing, what do you expect?\n\nPriority may be explained in `choco source -h`\n. Also, this is the wrong repository. \n. Please file this issue at https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/new\n. That is a packaging issue. The maintainer needs to indicate the file is a GUI - see https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/CreatePackages#how-do-i-set-up-batch-redirects-for-applications-that-have-a-gui\n\nAlso, any further issues should be logged at https://github.com/chocolatey/choco.\n. Please contact the maintainers and ask them to make the adjustments. Thanks!\n. https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/610\n. This repository is deprecated. Please see https://github.com/chocolatey/choco - your question is actually better to ask in Gitter. \n. Gitter is https://gitter.im/chocolatey/choco \n. ? \n. No worries. :D\n. Howdy wrong repo https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/836\n. Howdy.\n\nWhen you went to create an issue, did you happen to read the note? \n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/63502/18810463/8b957250-825c-11e6-923d-fe0842c40acb.png)\n\nThis is a duplicate of https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/969\n. Big issue though - high priority for a 0.10.2 release. Follow along over on https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/969, thanks! \n. @renerchen when you went to file the issue, did you happen to notice that the template that showed up in the text box said this repo is deprected and issues should be filed somewhere else (it had a link to the new location)? I'm curious, because we've had other people also do this and I want to understand if the messaging doesn't show up.. Here is the issue - you need to upgrade .NET framework to 4.5 so Chocolatey can auto add TLS 1.1 and 1.2. There are many sites that just will not work without at least TLS 1.1 and that is not in .NET Framework 4.0, only in 4.5+. \r\n\r\nThen you should no longer see that message. HTH.\r\n\r\nIf it does not, please head over to https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/new and continue this discussion. Thanks! . @tiantianwei When you created this issue, it appears you did not read the following:\r\n\r\n> THIS REPOSITORY IS DEPRECATED. DO NOT CREATE AN ISSUE HERE.\r\n> You are looking for https://github.com/chocolatey/choco instead. Thanks!\r\n\r\nNote that it is still in your issue comments. Please advise on how we can make that clearer?\r\n\r\n\r\n. \r\nSecond, your issue is a packaging issue with the commmunity package repository. For that you want to follow up **directly** with the maintainers of the package. You can do that on the package page itself (look for Contact Maintainers on the left menu). HTH.. @tiantianwei I can not read Chinese. :D \r\n\r\nI am not a maintainer of the Bazel package on the community repository. You will want to follow up with the folks that are. At https://chocolatey.org/packages/bazel\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/63502/23558622/ee329bc0-fff9-11e6-9ea3-b2362ae13288.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you do followup, please tell them that they are using 'convertfrom-json', which is not available in PowerShell v2. HTH. @laxselocke please file an issue at https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/new. Thanks! . ",

    "rismoney": "This is a great idea.  Can we store the ignores in the config.xml where the sources will be?  This way a cup all accidental run does not have unintended consequences.\n. well if package foo.1.0.0 is on one source, but foo.1.0.1 is on another source, do you really want to cross sources?  My source names could be staging, test, dev, prod, and so latest might have different meanings.\n\nPerhaps we should store a source.txt file inside each package listed in the lib folder, and then use when performing a clist -lo -source example.com\n. I just saw this.   Precisely what I was thinking on the google board.  Are there challenges you see with this, because I think I can build something around this pretty easily.   I haven't worked with nuget long (or chocolatey more than a few days), but maybe this should ultimately address dependencies in nuspec.   Like force removal, manual step through dependencies,  or just the singleton specified.\n. I should have a pull request by Tues for uninstall sometime this weekend.  Just got it working!  Awesomeness\n. Agree on name for obvious reasons.\nI am not up to dependencies.   Have a few ideas, but all rely on persisting a dependency.file in some form.  Only until last dependency is removed can underlying be removed, unless forced.\nAgree on not prompting\n. Does chocolatey even know about dependencies or is this purely a nuget construct?\n. strictly nuget handling for now-\n\n@ferventcoder https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/functions/Chocolatey-NuGet.ps1#26 is each $line here the packages and dependencies returned by nuget?  \n\nWe can check if $line is not  match for $packagename (therefore it must be a dependency) to place a flag in \\lib\\$dependency, like dependency_of.XYZ.ver\n\nThat's trivial.\n\nThe uninstaller then needs to do what?  We instead save $nugetOutput L24 to \\lib\\$packagefolder and reparse it at uninstall time.\n\nFurther we can make L 29+ we can make it install/uninstall agnostic.\n. so before write-chocolatey-failure.ps1 is called during an cinst then a remove-item needs to occur on \\lib\\$packagename.\nI find myself deleting \\lib\\$packagename manually on fails regularly.\n. So I took in your change LucidSage- I like the bulk of what you are attempting!  I am confused as it now uses the nuget registered source list (you add chocolatey.org) to that list during setup?\n\nWhat if I have my own internal repo?  I run nuget sources?  Where does chocolatey read in the sources? I didn't read the whole pull-req.\n\nI was really hoping for a chocolatey sources command to not mess with nuget, but this might be solid.\n. Awesome, thanks for the clarification!  It might be easy to cherry pick most of your commits and just leverage a specific config file.    I had been search/replacing all this since I run a chocolatey org internal and didn't want to use actual internet chocolatey.org\n. I am not sure how ;)... I haven't built unit tests for powershell, though I would like to learn.\n. Wow Pester looks like an awesome project and I like how you used it.  I am not sure if I have the cycles to dive into crafting this (maybe 1-2 months before I can revisit pester) since it would be yak shaving against my short term continous integration objectives. \n. tyvm!\n. you're awesome.  thanks for acceptance into your project!  btw-I just hecked out some blogs you wrote, and enjoyed the content, particularly the remote workers/highly collaborative stuff.\n. Great idea-Thoughts on this- cinst msi1,msi2,msi3 -arguments '/quiet'.  the msiexec call-outs should use start-process -Wait to enusure async.\n. I think by default if no uninstall path is provided, it tries to find it automatically perhaps via reglookup or similar wmi query.\n\n2 relevant links \nhttp://community.spiceworks.com/how_to/show/2238\nhttp://www.vbforums.com/showthread.php?t=598355\n. the web installer version still uses that big file, then right? just clarifying half a dozen folders i got here ;)\n. trying to use the version from _packaged_output... i think i just needed to run chocolateyinstall.ps1\n. all good 9.8.16 =big.  i have like choc-ultimate, choc-build, choc-current, choc-lucid, choc-myco, and thought i was losing my mind.  i got probs and should go to bed.\n. I now see the paradox in requesting a pull not for pulling :-) Is the right thing to do creating a gist or repo link?\n\non a more relevant note-I wanted to make a func where the user doesn't need to specify a guid for uninstall.ps1 for msi.  looking up the code at uninstall time won't be reliable.  so I thought if we can grab it during install we know it is definitely associated with that package.  the question becomes where to put it.  I know you were working on additional persistence so I didn't want to just drop it in lib\n. i think that is solid thinking.  for msi, chocolatey uninstall can and should be optional for ease of use, but you still want to call that if it exists. \n\nthis way you can execute a post msi task.  for instance a remove-item -recurse on a folder the msi doesn't clean up every now and again.  \n\nAs I type this, I am now wondering if there should be a chocolatey-pre-uninstall ps1.  For instance if something runs as a service, I might want to stop them/taskill whatever to insure msi doesn't complain about something being open.\n. I finally had some time to look at this.   I think it is close, I just need to test it a bit.  \n. do i not have it right?  I thought it was dropping in a join-path $env:chocolateyinstall`\\lib $packageName\n\nthe code does not change for each install.  it is unique product code per package.  for example package1.1.1.msi will also be the same code on every system.   package 1.1.2 will be a unique product code (at least thats how i  read it - i could be wrong)\n\nside by side installs aren't possible with msi, unless some transform magic or a wrapper that provides a unique product code for additional installs is built in.\n. rebased obviously.  this now requires fix_zipfolderpath PR for the environment variable.  need to retest later today hopefully.\n. added some crazy msi file dumping to assist with whatprovides for msi\n\nneed to retest...\n. thats an interesting idea. \n. i have thought about toying with honing a registry event hook for the uninstall key.  i wanted to unify ARP with choco.\ni think i can do it.\n\nsome thoughts were\npreserving regkeys\nif choco does it then stronger packaging reqts are needed.  ie matching arp name with title for instance.\nwe want to minimize choco making assumptions.  it has to be deterministic.\n. thinking everything not just msi\n\nthe uninstall string is dynamically created by the installer service itself.  in msi this is not provided beyond the guid.\n\nessentially i see swapping this uninstall key for cuninst pkgname.  it works awesome.\ni also considered append to that key and call chocolateyunistall -arp to have it just do a minimal amt of cleanup.  \n\ni have this stuff on my todo list but i am swamped with projects. \n. interesting ideas. the diff would be interesting.  Plus there is 32 bit and 64 bit keys... also not sure what would happen with depdendency packages. lot of variables in this thing.\n\nwhen does the garbage collection function get called?\n. awesome.. so does this particularly address the author that does not provide the chocolateyuninstall.ps1and this attempts the needful basee on reg diffs of uninstall keys?\n. i can do this, no prob\n. what level is this for-- fault tolerance, package availability, or both?  like would a test-ping on the array members be sufficient, or if the package is not found try the next source, etc?\n. Did you pull request the wrong branch?\n. I have some posh code that might make the hashing virtually invisible to package authors and users.  Need to sort out a few details.  cpack sounds  right for authors.   checksum files, nupkg, scripts,  dirs, we have options.   Have not given this thought, but I just played with headlock a bit the other day and may have an concept\n. the ftp PR conflicts w/ this iirc.  i feel a rebase for someone :)\n. Going back to the original message - has anyone tried changing the buffers in get-webfile?  I bumped that all the way up to 1048576 and helped a ton...\n. I think we should re-invigorate this-  \n\nThe guys here are putting logic in chocolateyuninstall to see if the binary that was already downloaded exists.  if so then use it, otherwise they are re-fetching it.  this should be built into chocolatey, to eliminate the verbosity in the chocolateyuninstall.  i like it minimal.\n. so this was created on master branch.\nCan you bring this changes in via a new branch?  I think you need to close this PR and open a new one.\nI would also do a git rebase -i upstream/master (assuming the upstream is chocolatey/chocolatey) and fixup your 2nd commit.\n\nI am also going to look at the code now to see if anything stands out.  After you do that, and reopen a PR I will test your change and try to move forward.  I know you have been really patient.\n. also make sure you do a git fetch upstream and a git rebase upstream master to ensure there are no conflicts that need to be reconciled as stuff has changed since you first contributed.\n. agree - \n\nI'll threadcrap - but I think the contributing should use this workflow.\n\nassuming git remote is named upstream for chocolatey/chocolatey\ngit checkout -b <new feature>\nmod make changes.\ngit push --set-upstream origin foo\nmake more changes\ngit push origin \ngit fetch upstream\ngit rebase upstream/master\n\ngit push -f origin (remote username/chocolatey).  Should never be sacared, if they are in a branch.  Be nervous on master. \nopen PR and then \ngit fetch upstream\ngit rebase upstream/master regularly until your PR is approved if commits go in before yours\n. yes\n. would these be ps1? psm... would an example be say - an iis helper?\n. https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/chocolatey/VougffEcvSE\n. pull request 119 supercedes this and includes all the changes in this (118)\nI wasn't sure how to build branches on branches since I have been using 119 in my prod environment, and 99% of the changes were in chocolatey-version.ps1\n\nWhile this PR does fix everything noted in the above commit msg, it proved to be too slow for an instantaneous query need of what is installed according to chocolatey.  So I added more logic to the file and issued a separate PR : https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/119\n. agree - better name.   is there an example of a switch you set globally?  like -pre? \nok, let me revise.\n. I think this now works a lot better - I appreciate the advice.   I was looking at some advance param stuff and it gets wonky with multiple optional parameters if unnamed.\n. ~~i think am going to change the output for localonly to a more meaningful (vs. the unavailables)~~\n~~packagename==version~~\n\n~~I think that is pretty common, pip and some other *nix package managers use that in some scenarios.~~\n\n~~otherwise working with the puppet provider I have 3 layers of escape chars, ruby, dos, and posh and it is ambigious.~~\n. simplified commit\n. I have this in another outstanding pull request... :)\nThat is why you had an issue... The provider is based on my repo, and pending upstream acceptance\n. This also a change prepped, -lo or localonly\n. you can grab my changes https://github.com/rismoney/chocolatey if you'd like.  i started down the exact path you seem to have arrived at.  i think it was just chocolatey-version.ps1 for the query changes and chocolatey.ps1 for the switch capability. hope that helps.  feel free to mod it since i just hacked a few other providers to cobble something together, since my ruby knowledge is 1 week in.\n. cver all -localonly or cver all -lo will do this. \nnot sure about chocolatey list -installed off the top of my head, but if we want this, it should be trivial...\n\npersonally i don't understand the difference between list and version... ;)\n. what version of chocolatey are you running?  With the fixed cver (i compile mine from source)\nname                                                                  found\n\n---\n\nDomainTimeII.client                                                   5.2.2.20120215\nGoogleChrome                                                          19.0.1084.52\nHPSPP                                                                 2012.08.0\nMellanoxDrivers                                                       2.1.3\nNetBackup                                                             7.1\ncitrix                                                                12.3.0.8\nlync                                                                  4.07577.0\nOffice                                                                14.0\n. note spaces jacked up\n. Sounds like you want packages.confg (see here https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CommandsInstall)\n\nAlternatively the boxstarter project might be something you are after if you are looking to do multiple repaving\nhttp://boxstarter.org/\n. ferventcoder- what are the implications with putting this in program files, and \\programdata or similar area for lib? I am sure xp/win7 compatibility, uac and folder perms factored in. \n\npersonally I tend to like it on c:\\ because it is somewhat of an entity unto itself - sort of part of the os, but not, but should be :) plus everything is in one spot, making tweaking and fixing easy.  Microsoft never had a clear model like http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/09/linux-file-system-structure/ and so things need to be forced a bit.\n\nI am not sure how you addressed per user installs, per computer, if at all...\n\nI also think it (can't recall) but it sets some variables on the user level, and not machine which i need to look at.  \n. oh, i left out the info you might want - i think the environment variable ChocolateyInstall determines the path where the installer puts it...\n. Program files, with lib in Ugh hidden c:\\programdata would be standard?\n\nBut I like it on sysroot since I treat a pkg mgr different than a traditional app. My coworker wants it on d:\\chocolatey in prod \n. reference-http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/s2esdf4x.aspx\n. @nathanaeljones If you are thinking of installing beneath program files, don't... UAC, gets in the way.  and gem installs will bust. And spaces get ugly... Anywhere else (off root, for example) should be fine.\n. speaking of get-webfile, i swapped in several newer ones for testing - http://poshcode.org/?lang=&q=get-webfile.  I was troubleshooting what I perceive to be slow x-fers on a 10g network.  v 4.1 is significantly SLOWER than the 3.x series.  The issue turned out to be tweaking autotuninglevel and ramping up the buffers from 4096... but whatever was done in 4.1 is slower.\n\nBack on topic - I HATE passing passwords directly from cli.   get-credential requires interaction...maybe something with securestring would work?\n. No config file as of yet, except for sources.\n\n I apologize.  I don't hate pw at cli.   I actually had a conversation with someone on the topic of pw in files that ended up in version control... You can guess where that went.\n\nWhat you are describing does sound reasonable.  \n\nDoes the getweb file support http://user:pw@url syntax?  I know modern browsers disallow it...\n. I think you would want this flexibility on updating as well...  i wouldn't want to cinst pkgname -ignoredependencies and then cup pkgname and get extra stuff.  we should log the initial argument usage for future default preferencing that particular package.  now that I think about it, uninstalls might need a -deletedependency...\n. I an not familiar with the particulars of ruby devkit but I think, that ignoredependencies, would just cause chocolateyinstall.ps1 to execute without the nugety goodness... Am I over simplifying?\n\nSo, I am not sure this would fix your use case.\nWe probably need to track dependencies in both directions...\n. what should it have done in your opinion, upgrade the existing one to 1.9.3?\nruby is an interesting use case, because like java (good/bad) you can take on many concurrent versions... i run a few actually.\n\ni wouldn't trust running the ps1 w/o the dependencies in place. how do you know macler installed 7zip?    if he ignores dependency and 7zip is heavily used in chocolatey-install.ps1, then he will get a boos all over. should those then be supressed because he ignored, and now he is in his own world of support/hurt.\n. http://poshcode.org/3537\n\nGoing to test this one- 7 week's old...\n. yea, i went to the authors website- http://mnaoumov.wordpress.com/2012/07/24/powershell-add-directory-to-environment-path-variable/ and right at the top, is his note...:( fail\n. i'd want to use exclusively system variables.  so what do i need to do exactly?\n\nis there a problem with passing params to InstallChocolatey.ps1 that this can't be done within it? isn't that what's in the bit.ly url that gets invoked?  \n. I was shooting for an optional switch if specified, while running under admin that could do it for me :)  I have been installing chocolatey on 400 servers and I have seen some bizzare issues with environment path modification and powershell putting in 2 semi-colons or none.  \n. I saw a discussion here - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4225748/how-do-i-pass-named-parameters-with-invoke-command which uses script blocks- somewhat convoluted.\n. @ferventcoder \n\n> To go to system, it would just take adding them manually and applying this fix for now.  I think in the future we could make the installer smarter.\n\nAgree. Can we do a git fetch upstream and git rebase upstream/master (assuming your chocolatey/chocolatey remote is upstream).   Lets get the innovation, but lets get @abombss to a git rebase -i  fixup on the 2nd commit, especially since it mods the same file, and we want every commit to stand on its own as workable going forward.\n. it returns \"does not appear to be on the source specified\" if the $versionlatest is empty.  \n\nwhat happens when you just do a nuget list kdiff3 for example?\n\nWhat is in the list.log in your chocolateyinstall folder after you run chocolatey update all?\n. list.log should contain the output of all packages like you listed for kdiff.\nif that file doesn't have the information, you get the errors you see.  lets first make sure it is resolving nuget before going into details.\n\ngo into C:\\chocolatey\\chocolateyinstall.\ntype \n\n```\n. .\\chocolatey.ps1\n$nugetExe\n```\n\ndoes it return C:\\Chocolatey\\chocolateyInstall\\nuget.exe ?\n. didn't forget about this- i will test further, probably next week in my chocolatey lab.  the issue is definitely $versionlatest being empty, but need to instrument it first hand.\n. did the line-feeds or spacing change?  not sure why it shows the whole file changed...\n. I don't have a proxy requiring auth so I will punt.  It looks trivial, as if you don't provide the switch, its a noop.\nI am going to just flag this for updating documentation. before merge/closure.\n. bump this would rock - i have had ppl ask me about this.\n. this approach is actually really clever.  \n\nSeveral questions - Do we need a \"windowsfeatures\" added to chocolatey-uninstall?   Can multiple features be specified on the same line?   I know the dism /online /enable-feature can take an unlimited number of /featurename: switches.\n\nLOVE THIS PR!\n\nAside:\nI am going to modify the puppet chocolatey provider to support just the sources param, since everything else is \"in place\".    .  The more I think about it, the more I think chocolatey is the ultimate provider for puppet on windows.    \n. say i wrote a helper chocolatey-restart that simply closes the active session and reopens a fresh posh. is this invasive? would it work?\n\nanother random thought-maybe wmi event consumers can track the change to env vars...\n. Did you have an idea on holding cell?\nAre you implying that any error in chocolateyinstall.ps1 does not unwind to a clean state upon error?\n. The only \"thinking\" chocolatey does is check lib.\n-force kills thinking\n. are you suggesting then, that if there is a failure, then the $packagefolder then just be moved to something like \\failures\\$packagefolder?   i would think that it should also run chocolateyuninstall.ps1 with a silentlycontinue...  There is no way to know the \"impact\" of errors since anything could have happened.  Also worthy, is everything needs to get logged...\n. @ferventcoder - \"don't pull yet - pull requests\" - where have i seen that before?\n. oh snap.  it does!  good job! \n\nmaybe it needs refinement to provide a bit more user friendliness.   Right now, is the end user supposed to just \"guess\" what the params are?\n. It needs to be fixed for full functionality.\n\nCannot run say /? Because it won't cleanup, which we know about.\n\nThe Params should be at the discretion of the package creator, and they should publish a list.  This way it doesn't need to execute the binary for help.\n\nParams might also cross multiple helpers.  I unzip a set of folders to Param1 then install chocolatey install to param2\n. say i install 2 msi's.  i want to pass /qn to one and /quiet to another.  then i want to install a zip.\nthe developer has to have control over what goes where.   \n\nin https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/160  I'd want in chocolateyrun.ps1 a function usage()\n\nwhat cross my mind earlier is to make some sort of chocolatey  DSL like pester (which i haven't looked at yet)\n. no dice fellahs.  env var's are string only.\n\nref:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/13128284/using-non-string-as-env-variable\n. I think I wanted to have a function help() too... and maybe uninstall should go in same file...\n. > @rismoney @Iristyle Interesting idea proposed by you guys - the chocolateyInstall.ps1 becomes > chocolateyRun.ps1 and in it it contains functions that chocolatey will call \n> \n> powershell\n> function ShouldInstall {}\n> function InstallSteps {}\n> function ConfigureSteps {} #optional, in case folks want things installed but not configured.\n> function UninstallSteps {}\n\nIf we did this, I need to it work for existing packages, so if functions don't exist it has to just call chocolateyinstall.ps1\nas it does today.\n. heh, I left off initial mechanics of the idea-\n\nif (test-path chocolateyrun.ps1) \n. .\\chocolateyrun.ps1\n\nif (test-path function:\\shouldinstall) {run it} repeat where applicable.\nremove function on success (cleanup)\n\ndeco chocolateyinstall.ps1 through attrition.\n. as for the steps shouldinstall,installsteps, configuresteps, uninstallsteps\n\nI think this could also provide the mechanism to support downgrade.  (steps to preserve config files, uninstall reinstall, whatever)\n\nisinstalled (instead of just lib checking) let the package creator define what it means to be installed - does a regkey/file exist for example?)  very useful in .exe where unwinding/detecting is not necessarily in reg.\n\ninfo\nswitch usage - package help - verbosity, dependency listings, version whatever\n. The change looks trivial to me, but how do you call the chocolatey installer with a different url?  I am not familiar, because I use nuget.exe to install from internal chocolatey.org, since it requires a single exe drop (and dotnet4).  Found that to be the best way, because I maintain custom chocolatey builds that aren't in lock step with ferventcoders releases.\n. ditto. no issue for merge. sad 7 months went by.\n. brown fudge, by any other name, would it be sweet? lol\n\nits what yum calls it... I think apt-get uses apt-file search... \nhows about chocolatey filesearch ?  lookup, filelookup, seek, frisk, pry, dig, or taste, reach.\n\nI thought whatprovides was explicit...It tells you what package provides the file.  not as problematic as the cunst.\n. hmmm.  its not so useful yet I guess to determine console.exe is installed by console2.  What about a .dll it dropped in system32.  \n\nthe goal is to be able to track down the \"source\" of any file on the system and make every file traceable back to a package.  at work we are going to mandate that every single piece of software we deploy is sourced from our chocolatey feed.\n\nRight now it is just filename matching.  Imagine this future script /tool in my hopper:\nCreate list of all files on a system and subtract out all known OS files AND package files (the latter always been difficult).\nThen track the rest of the files deltas day over day and allow exception list.\n\nA true rogue file report.  Plan to do this on servers at 2am nightly\n. The package creator needs to provide filelist.txt if using non msi or zip currently...\n\nCrude yes, also worthy to note that whatprovides does not mean does provide...\n\nThe latter would require procmon style inspection or other scanning.\n\nI just thought it might be useful to the community.\n\n---\n\nFrom: Rob Reynolds\nSent: Mon, 24/09/2012 05:10 PM\nTo: chocolatey/chocolatey chocolatey@noreply.github.com\nCC: Siegel, Richard RSiegel@ise.com\nSubject: Re: [chocolatey] chocolatey whatprovides [filename](#168)\n\nSo I install a tool package - that tool uses bin dir so it installs to something like c:/tools/packagename where it auto adds a that directory to the path. How do I trace that back to the package itself as it wouldn't be as easy to find?\n\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/168#issuecomment-8834886.\n. whatprovides is akin to yum whatprovides.  I think its kind of neat and more of a nice to have feature to grow on.   I am ambivalant if this makes it into the codebase.  It was more an experiment that worked... \n. ok - its not perfect implementation (what is?). but here is the usage-\n\nI have a file on my system.  I am not sure if it was from a chocolatey package install, malware, a download, whatever.  I install everything from zip or msi currently.  So I see a file that looks suspect.  I want to see if it came from inside a package.   Since zips (currently) and msi's will be able to log all the files they encompass, we can use that get-content and seach the txt file to determine if a file is rogue (not sourced from a chocolatey package) or we deployed it.  Its not a dead on thing, but it could be a nice feature.  \n\nIdeally I would want have lists from all the operating systems files and then be able to identify every binary file on a host.  It can become really helpful with system32, ruby versions, etc. \n. This PR and the associated #164 haven't been updated in 7 months.   Can we take this in as an advanced user improvement, that if someone down the line wants to simplify and improve, it can be part of a refactor?  I think there is value in the code.\n\nI'd probably fixup the commits and amend the commit msg, to be inclusive of the others.\n. your the boss ;)  how do you back that branch to the parent commit and then pull the changes.  I was just trying to assist as I know there are a ton of PRs and don't want to stifle progress for project newcomers who think they won't get merged. However I can help, let me know.\n. speaking of continuous integration ;)  eliminate direct contributions to chocolatey.org.   have all packages go through a unified gitrepo (even gitsubmodules).   use git hub hooks like on a merged pull request to trigger a cpush.  take the user out of the owner, and turn it into package curators, and contributors.  no direct upload for packages...\n. running alpha2 build now, and the bizarre thing is that it appears slower because it is updating more relaxedly, but is actually faster...  agree with you mwrock-awesome!\n. i see no issue here.  i had no opinion on the status bar.  \n\nglad to see you are using puppet and chocolatey together.  how is that working out for you?\n. registrytreechangeevent could be used to find if uninstall string was added.  We replace with cuninst... Or we do it with helper and its up to package creator to unify package.  Making assumptions even logical can result in busted items...\n. I found good com query but it neglects syswow on 64... Not sure how to fix it...\nCould be panacea, because win32 product wmi sucks and custom mof requires admin...\n. Cuninst should then call uninstall string...\n\nSo then chocolatey can uninstall packages it does not technically manage, albeit not silent... unless we add more logic :)\n. i tend to agree w/ you.  that fear would steer this responsibility to the package owner if he wants his app to be unified.\ndocumentation could detail this...\n\nalso chocolatey might make a data integrity error in trying to be smart into an app that would require an expert to unwind. \n\nthe other interesting thing is we can create a helper to add items to add/remove programs that don't normally get it (like tools) or zip packages, etc. its actually trivial.\n. The 42 seconds is why I added localonly...\n. I relooked at code- got confused, you just moved those lines around.  Its not new. My bad.\n. Ah ensure latest was expensive.   Thats why I switched to present in my manifests.   Need my prod env highly deterministic and latest could update something.\n\nAre you running choc.org internally, or running against the public site ?\n. I am not really sure how we want to do this...\nI started with converting chocolatey.ps1 to a function. This should help testing it.\n\nhttps://github.com/rismoney/chocolatey/blob/039afe39922298af8ba0d2ec74eaddf73f049c9b/src/chocolatey.ps1\n\nchoco could then be a very thin file to call Invoke-Chocolatey\n\ni welcome any input!\n. fyi - my old pull request (still out there)  fishes out the guid, during install, safe storing it to a txt file for later use...I have been meaning to get back to it...\n. interesting... i would have thought people would like to fail early and abort...  Personally I have a bunch of packages, and if a pre-req fails the success of post packages is usually botched as well. Otherwise why are they linked?\n\nPersonally I'd like to strive for idempotency to address @tomOne \"annoying and reduces UX\" issue.  chocolatey should just \"do the needful\"...I hate when I get a box of chocolates (that rocks!) - ie when it doesn't stop on error...\n\nMaybe if there are differing opinions there should be a silentlycontinue or similar switches via config file.\n. I like determinism.  I would need stop on error.  The systems i manage are critical and must not leave things in barney.\n. http://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Get-PendingReboot-Query-bdb79542.  iirc at the summit, @mwrock mentioned he was doing this with his boxstarter.\n\nIt might be nice as a helper for package authors- ie- Get-RebootState before, to fail cinst package fast.  This way we don't attempt an install on an msi that we know will bust with a pending reboot.\n\nor... Building it into choco, might create the undesired behavior where we can't install something unless a boot happens... (Unless we provide a -bootoverride)  This might be good too.\n. noone wants to help me :( - our sysadmins are -matching in every package...ugh - im swamped.\n\n``` powershell\n$getpath = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable(\"PATH\",\"Machine\")\n$getMatch = \"$getpath\" -match \"$installdir\"\"\nif ($getMatch -eq \"True\") {\n  Write-Output \"Note: $installDir exists in the PATH environment variable so we will not be adding it again\" \n}   \nelse {\n  Install-ChocolateyPath $installDir 'Machine' \n }\n```\n.

It is worthy to note, that the Invoke-ChocolateyFunction will give free bubble up throws in any function.

So sad\u2026 it\u2019s a blow to git on win for sure.\n. I am not understanding this at all.\n\nInstall-ChocolateyZipPackage can specify an unzip location of your choice.\nAlso it doesn't have to be all files. You can do partial unzips.\n\nI thought we had a helper for making links.\n. The complete parameters are listed in the files \nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/helpers/functions/Install-ChocolateyZipPackage.ps1\nIn this case, the 3rd parameter allows you to specify unzip location and the 5th allows you to unzip a single folder within the zip.\n\nso \ninstall-chocolateyzippackage mypackage http://myurl32bit C:\\extractionpoint http://myurl64bit onlythisfolder\n\nThe params should probably be named, re-positioned and cleaned up, but it will work.\nAs far as the links, I think @mwrock added a bunch of functionality for links, shortcuts, etc but I haven't any experience with it.  Look in https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/tree/master/src/helpers/functions\n. Should probably always be an array, even with single member.\nshould be able to do this with items.item($arraymembers)\n\nGet-ZipItems_recursive $file.getfolder.items() $specificfolder $target\n\nRedsandro - do you want to take a shot at fixing this? :)\nI need this fixed too, but I'm swamped.\n. actually its aleady done...\nhttp://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/PowerShell-Get-Specific-9b35352f\n\nfunction getzipfileitems recursive has string matching...should be trivial.\n. Git rebase -i upstream/master\nChange the bottom 4 commits to fixup instead of pick\nThen git push -f origin\n. As long as he pushes to his origin its fine.  Its only a nono on chocolatey chocolatey master\n. Needs to make sure remotes are set right of course\n. I don't think we should take this in.   It needs to be reconciled with the existing one. \nIf there are specific use cases for one vs the other then conditional logic can apply the right call...\n. https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/helpers/functions/Get-WebFile.ps1#L46 is this not doing cookie handling? I am not all that familiar with cookie handling in general.\n. I do like the ignore cert switch in theory, but not in practice.  A package author should not be sending consumers of the package to https sites that don't have valid certificates.   I believe that is a call the _end user_ should make, and question the authenticity of the underlying url.\n. > Interesting...we have made choco silent by default. This seems to go against that idea. Should this not be a pkg then?\n\nIts not against the idea.  Bypassing a tenet of an https request is the offense.\nI like ignore, but that is a user call, not a author call.  If I am going to a https site, and the name, CA or date is jacked up I am going to most certainly question if I want this on my system.  \n\nThis is a helper, and doesn't expose the ssl bypass capability to the cli/end user.\n\nIf we wanted silent then it would need to work akin to:\ncinst foo -ignore-ssl-errors\n. getbits?  lol - isn't get-processorAddressWidth or something more appropriate - though wordier for sure ;)\n. asserts changed in new pester, particularly around piping...\nI really like this PR.\n\nAnd I would rebase fixup your commits so its a clean bisectable history.  With all the outstanding PRs we need to make sure if we introduce a bug, we can use git bisect and git blame successfully going forward.\n.

It really is awesome.   I hope I can get a lot of posh people on it at the summit this week. I Cant stand codeplex.\n. wow even this needs to be rebased and reconciled... \n. I will have a look at this as I added this in PR 114.  The functionality here, creates a text file within the package lib folder that lists all the files that were extracted.  The goal of this was to use this text file generated during install to at some later point \"uninstall\" the zip, which essentially iterates through the file delete all entries listed. \n\nIt might be helpful for me to test this, by outputing the var's to see if something amiss in particular to this specific zip file.  I haven't run into this bug and we deploy our entire app w/ zips so its runtime .  I wonder if this particular zip file has deeply nested subfolders, and we're hitting a limitation I need to check for or take into account.\n\nThe impact here for this, is that chocolatey uninstall zip will not have a proper text file to use and clean up the extraction.\n. a lot of the commands need to be cleaned up... good suggestion though.\n. This is really novel.  I am a fan.   I bet we can use this beyond zip... like all the tools, gems, and non msi stuff.\n+1\n. You are not missing anything.  It feels somewhat of an antipattern, from knowing what was installed to knowing what was supposed to be installed...  in this case the actuals might be preferred...  the real issue is native zip capabilities suck.\n\nFor an zip exe though this might work really well as a helper\n. I am not really sure what a plug-in would look like.  Everything in powershell is sort of an add on.  What is the tie in point?  That chocolatey would auto-dot source anything in location, and \"learn\" it?   \n\nAre you thinking like chocolatey config network mynic.xml?\n. https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/HelpersInstallChocolateyPackage\n. so what exactly are you doing... you must be missing some steps-  the commands work for me relative to notepad.exe\n\nare you creating nuspec ,packing it, putting the chocolatey.ps1 in tools, etc?\n. delete relevant files out of the C:\\Users\\%username\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\chocolatey. there could be lock there.\n. @ferventcoder is this an admin thing? \ndid you start powershell by rightclicking 'run as administrator' ? never really looked at start-choc...\n. @kellyelton-\nto troubleshoot i might add make a copy of start-chocolateyprocessasadmin.ps1\nthen add\n\nL37 $s\nL38 $psi\nand see what values it is trying to use, and work back from there.\n\nalso are you sure cloversetup /silent is valid?  have you run it interactively with that switch and it works?\n. had you seen https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/210?  I tried to deal with process exits throughout all of chocolatey.\n\nbtw- linux-vm looks really _really_ awesome.   \n. I completely relate.  My main concern was to always exit 1 if there was a failure on any of the functions.  I recently delved into puppet/ruby so my main concern was to never return an exit 0 if something went wrong which is the current behavior.  It's funny, when I use chocolatey interactively i never use the batch files.  when i use it programmatically via puppet i used the bat files. its because i never use cmd, so its silly for me to call a batch to call powershell if i am already in it.\n\nunrelated, but calling posh from ruby strangely irks me with powershell.exe, maybe for the opposite reason.  If I can run an exec, and call the bat, then i avoid the powershell.exe\n\nI haven't found a great method to interact with powershell via ruby, particularly for multi-line code blocks.\n. the uninstall _should_ be deleting the lib... assuming there is an uninstall\n. I guess I wasn't clear. I wasn't really directing comments :innocent: \n\nI think a fail install should call cuninst, and we should stop on the last successful dependency.  Don't leave the unwinding to the end user.  A cuninst will actually perform a delete of chocolatey.lib.  In this scenario I might silent all stdout/stderr unless debug, and report a failed install has been unwound on package foo.  Further investigation may be necessary.\n\nI am comparing it to an msi, that fails midway, and then the progress bar goes in reverse, and usually leaves :shit: in far worse places than my lib.  love the emoji's btw.\n. Hes not going to be able to install anything upstream unless he rolls his own pkgs.\n. iirc my PR will handle all the exit code failures - https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/210\n\nI know @ferventcoder has been very busy as the PRs have been building up, so I guess patience or perhaps he responds to :cookie:s  lol.. , or if you are so bold, try my branch out and see if it addresses your issue...  It is not guaranteed though to make it in choco so, you are on your own in that regard, but I will say that I run the changes in this branch in my production environment with 1000 servers w/o issue.\n. @abombss you mean like this? ;)\n\nI don't know what the full potential of scriptcs is... \nhttps://github.com/rismoney/puppet-baremetal-windows/blob/master/make_pe/runtime/get-DHCPHostname.ps1\n. I thought msft should have scrapped PowerShell in favor of ruby.net\n\nAnd ditch cmd and not have powershell.exe be so expensive to call out to.\n. Nuget is awesome, but it is constraining imho, like customizinf nuspec... Folks on the irc powershell channel don't have anything nice to say about chocolatey's wrapper approach.  But I have yet to see anyone else do better.\n\nRebuilding nuget in native powershell would be a lot of work...\n. I do like the cinst ruby -clean   - That makes sense to me.  The old versions can be determined using the -version all functionality I just wrote as a PR a few minutes ago against the current.\n\nNow enter cup notepadplusplus.  When you cinst it, you get the latest. perfect! \nIf a new version comes out, and you cup it, you get 2 folders in lib but only 1 version is installed.  A new version comes out again, and you cup it 3 folders.  In actually you only have 1 version of notepadplusplus.\n\nIn this use case- you want the cup process to automatically delete the lib folder for the version 1 rev behind. An upgrade is just that, a replacement of the version you specify (or replace latest if unspecified).  Its not a side by side install, and i think chocolatey doesn't do much different for a cup.\n\nI think in the case of ruby, most users are not going to cup ruby, and instead cinst the version they want.  \n. Maybe cup should delete all versions. I think that's what yum update might do. \n\nOtherwise cinst...\n. i understand what you are saying about pinning, which I am down with.  Do you think this should be a 'feature' of the config file?  say a pinned packages element.   Do we leave this up to the user to populateor leave it to package authors to tamper with chocolatey.config? (ugh-security)...\n\nI have a production request to nail down the default behavior for cup.  Its getting to the point, where package authors are building crazy logic into chocolateyinstall.ps1...  chocolateylib is gettting messy.\n\nIf there are areas where we are giving the users a choice, like in your uninstall example, we also need command line switches to force behaviors for non-interaction. \n. any interest in a helper like this: (taken from one of our sysadmins who used it in a recent package) I horrendously adapted it for understandiing\n\n```\nFunction ChocoCleanUp {\n  #Clean up previous installs out of lib folder if they exist\n  $chocolateyLib = 'c:\\chocolately\\lib'\n  $packagever = \"1.2.3\"\n\n  Write-Host \"* Cleaning up legacy lib folders in c:\\chocolatey\" -foreground green -background black\n  Remove-Item $chocolateyLib\\$packageName* -Force -Recurse -Exclude $chocolateyLib\\$packageName.$packageVer -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue\n  Write-Host \"* Done\" -foreground green -background black\n}\n```\n. so are we needing a -pin switch, and what does it do?  Touch a pinned.txt 0 byte file in it's lib?\nand if it's not there, we do something like the helper I put above?\n\nTrying to understand how we should be creating future packages...\n. do you pin during install, or do you pin as a separate op, or both should be supported.\nie\n\nMethod 1.\nchoco install sysinternals -pin\n\nMethod2.\nchoco install sysinternals\nchoco pin sysinternals\n. > We do not remove the previous version at all when a new version comes in by design. You can install two versions of ruby\n\nthis whole topic confuses me, and a lot of ideas.\nQ:\n1. Should we have the install and uninstall call a function ChocoCleanUp if a pin is not set?\n2. Should we push this responsibility to the package author?  So a ruby package author wouldnt call chococleanup, but a notepadplusplus would?  I don't like this idea as it adds unnecessary clutter to authorship.  Right now this is what our sysdmins have to do, due to lack of options. Or should they have the ability as \"just another option\"\n3. we need a choco pin shim (lol, it just sounds funny) \n4. we need a choco pin param in config mgmt providers - (Kinda why I suggested Method 1 for ease)\n. overall we probably need a refactor of this function (probably a whole bunch of them) but anyway-\n\n this adds the ability to get alist of all versions of a product installed. \ni welcome thoughts.  I based this off, the current master, as I have modded chocolatey.ps1 and version in another PR for error handling, so if those get merged first, I will rebase those mods back in.\n. Ok - so this is confusing...as clist and cver have been for quite some time. But I think we are missing the intent for this PR.\n\nI am running the current source version now... (btw - sysinternals is pkg version for demonstrative purposes)\nThe functionality I added gave this-\n\n``` powershell\nC:\\Chocolatey> chocolatey version sysinternals -version all -lo\n\nname                                                        found\n----                                                        -----\nsysinternals                                                1.2012.05.20130124\nsysinternals                                                2.0\n\n```\n\nThis is the list of packages installed locally on my system.\n\n``` powershell\nThe chocolatey list sysinternals -lo -all gives this (which looks like a \nsysinternals 1.2012.05.20130124\nsysinternals 1.2012.05.23\n```\n\nThis is the list of packages on the feed. not sure what local only does in this use case, unless it is not developed yet...\n.

I don't put usually do a PR until we roll out here. We may need to reconcile merge conflicts though, since I think a few PRs overlap the same sets of files.

Are you just talking about on chocolatey.org? or via chocolatey itself?\n\nthe nuspec file defines the dependencies.  The issue right now in how chocolatey works for the latter is that we are grabbing the nupkg file and popping it into \\lib.  If we handled this in temp (for example) or another means, it would allow us to inspect the nuspec for dependencies, and report back to the user.  \n\nRight now the reliance on nuget.ee is both really helpful to making something work, and a hindrance to innovating.  I am wondering if we need more than a wrapper for it to really move choco forward.   I really like that its powershell though.\n. I think nuget.extensions has a graphing capability against a whole feed.\nhttp://ben.phegan.name/index.php/2012/07/02/nuget-graph/\n. also I would do a git rebase -i and fixup the second commit to make it look like one.\n. yes.  we should strive to keep a clean timeline moving forward.  a couple of things here:\n1.  create new branch\n2.  cherry pick changes into new branch or checkout -b newbranch, and then git reset --hard his master.\n3.  rebase. \n4.  then the maintainers should not do a gui based merged.  these are --no-ff and create a merge commit on top.  This makes the graph bumpy.  If we want a timeline that is easily bisectable we should try to get merges that are --ff and encourage small single commit continuous changes.  also when we leverage the testing frameworks this will help us immensely.\n. can you fixup your commit 2,3 into the 1st one?\n\nassuming upstream is the (chocolatey/chocolatey)\ngit rebase -i upstream/master\nswitch commit 2 and 3 from pick to fixup\n\nthen git push -f origin (zipp1981/chocolatey)\n. yes. a single commit:\n\nHere are my remotes:\n\nC:\\gitrepos\\chocolatey [patch-1]> git remote -v\norigin  git@github.com:rismoney/chocolatey.git (fetch)\norigin  git@github.com:rismoney/chocolatey.git (push)\nupstream        git@github.com:chocolatey/chocolatey.git (fetch)\nupstream        git@github.com:chocolatey/chocolatey.git (push)\n\nso if I first do a:\ngit fetch upstream\ngit rebase upstream/master  \n\nIt will put your 3 commits at the end of the current timeline.\n\nThen you can do an interactive rebase:\ngit rebase -i upstream/master\n\nThis will open a text editor where you can manipulate your commits interactively.\nYou can meld the commits together into the first commit, by switching the first word from pick to fixup inside the editor and save/close.  This will make it a single commit.\n\nThen you can git commit --amend can allow you to put the appropriate verbiage reflecting your change.\n\nYou will need to git push -f origin for it to go back into your origin, because you changed history through amending or interactively rebasing.\n\nHTH,\nRich\n\nIf you are not sure, just make a copy of the file first into a different dir just to test it out.\n. just to clarify- \n\nthe first commit is pick\nthe 2nd and 3rd should be fixup\n. yea (especially since I never use any font except notepad++ and powershell prompt) :smile:\n. its called cver.  We had talked about consolidating cver and clist.\n\nusage cver all -lo will show all local installed packages.  \n\nthe exit codes are in a pending PR.\n\nexamples:\n\nC:\\Users> cver 7zip\n\nname          : 7zip\nfound         : 9.22.0\nlatestCompare : 000000000009.000000000022.000000000000\nverMessage    : Latest version installed\nlatest        : 9.22.0\nfoundCompare  : 000000000009.000000000022.000000000000\n\nC:\\Users> cver 7zip -lo\n\nname                                                        found\n\n---\n\n7zip                                                        9.22.0\n. there is a chocolatey module https://github.com/chocolatey/puppet-chocolatey\n\nbut to get full exit codes natively we need the PR to be accepted, or you can build from my source.\n. The current release of chocolatey isn't complete for puppet as it requires the mods in my outstanding PRs...  \n\nwhen you say does not work properly, what are you experiencing?  I just want to confirm you aren't experiencing a different issue.\n. that does sound like the exit code issue on the cver query.  \n\ntechnically, what I think is happening in this case- it is not doing a ensure latest.  The cver query is failing to determine a package is installed, so it is atempting to cinst package. \nI think that is why I wrote this -\n\nhttps://github.com/rismoney/chocolatey/commit/f8ec947be96a90f8934989188da58d1e241a241e\n\nIts part of the https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/210 \n. First I appreciate your response.  \n\n> Talking specifically about the _.install/_.app package suffix - those are for the packages that have a native installer that they have bundled or they download and run.\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/ChocolateyFAQs\n\nAs far as a compelling reason, that is always going to be a curater vs author subject of contention.  I think even with a fair amount of rules, inevitably it can down to a per package decision.  When I look at other package/library solutions, like yum, gems, those decisions will appeal to some people and others will criticize.\n\nAs far as package research - I disagree wholeheartedly.   I manage 1000s of systems with chocolatey, and when you talk about scalability, if you manage 2 or more systems, the payoff is huge.  You should always research your packages.  For instance-\n\n.\\NuGet.exe install  -source http://chocolatey.org/api/v2/ beyondcompare\nand then look in the tools folder to see what it is actually doing.\n\nI have been thinking about what a chocolatey -whatif would look like, and perhaps this is a starting point.\n. @ferventcoder - i left that out intentionally, because I left it to the package author.  \nNot every package uninstalls via filename.\n\nUninstall-ChocolateyPackage '7zip' 'msi' '{23170F69-40C1-2702-0920-000001000000} /norestart /qn'\n\nOur oldest PR, actually can use the learned guid, so the author doesn't need to specify it... :)\n. @ferventcoder are you referring to HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall \n. gep13 I like that idea _A LOT_ \n\nhttps://github.com/blog/699-making-github-more-open-git-backed-wikis\n\nAs an alternate idea-\nI like the way the cli for git itself works. A really lean version of help is available locally.  For the verbose help it sends you to the wiki.  The only time I don't have internet access is in production, where I shouldn't be needing extended help or else boo to me.\n. Have you thought about - https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/160#issuecomment-8631260\nand using Update {}\n\nThen just call that file chocolateyPackage.ps1\n. > Why not automate a character encoding conversion to the correct encodings before a package gets built? \n\nI like it.\n-Rich :)\n. interesting thread-\n\nyou are bootstrapping chocolatey with puppet.  how do you install puppet?\n\nI have always installed chocolatey, and cinst puppet in unattend.xml\nThen I have a chocolatey module in puppet, that manages it going forward.\nI then put chocolatey into chocolatey repo, and keep it set on latest...\n. ummm...I kindly disagree... - \"but it should not be in there like today\".  \n\ncinst putty -Version 0.62.0.1 works before this change but not after.  Relying on the count of params is not a satisfactory test for batch mode.\n\nplus I agree with @ferventcoder that if you're changing one ingress into calling chocolatey we should make it consistent. Forking the functionality between cmd and powershell functionality is not ideal since the cmd is really a convenience factor for non-posh access\n. one last thing I might opt for array splat handling in posh or take the packages in via a pipeline, which means the source could be handled any way the user wants (objects)\n\nmaybe like 7zip vlc putty | chocolatey install\n. let me retest.  I will use current choco version and report results...  I do like the concept btw - i wasn't trying to be a pita.\n. I removed my custom version an ran this-\n\non a fresh Win7 Enterprise, I bootstrapped with the install method on http://chocolatey.org/ \n\nwithin cmd.exe:\n\n```\nC:\\Users\\admin>cinst putty -Version 0.62.0.1\nInstalling packages in batch mode.\nInstalling putty ...\nChocolatey (v0.9.8.20) is installing putty and dependencies.

I googled this thrift shop and watched http://vimeo.com/m/57418480 ... no words.  Made my day\n. @redsandro I don't have to approve.  I am only here to critique, debase, and hassle people :) \n\nSeriously though - the best thing about open source projects, which this \"issue\" illustrates so well,  is that you had an idea, submitted a PR demonstrating a prototype on how you thought it should work, it was reviewed by people who care about the project, and someone else rose up to implement in a way that fits within the bigger picture.  Awesome work for an awesome feature.  \n. hmm, if sarcasm works....\nI am not going to thread :shit: or anything.\n\nthe feature I could _really_ use to help get my internal packages opensourced is-\na pkgsource id in chocolatey.config file or an environment variable that could then be used within chocolateyinstall.ps1 to replace a hardcoded url.\n\nRight now all my packages are hardcoded to an internal url, and ideally there would be a way to \nif pkgsourceid exists or env:$pkgsourceid exists then use that, otherwise fall back to url like Mozilla.org for firefox or whatever. \n\nSummary I want to be able to create packages that can be used universally, on the public - via mirrors or private feed. Embedding a url becomes problematic to maintain.  \n\nThen a param called pkgsource could be also used to override the default url.\n\nThis has nothing to do with the -source, source (but you know that already)\n. link?\n. example-\n\n```\nInstall-ChocolateyPackage -packageName \"$packageName\" `\n            -fileType 'msi' `\n            -url 'http://chocopackages.myorg.com/PuppetEnterprise/puppet-enterprise-2.6.1.msi' `\n            -silentArgs '/quiet'\n            #-url64bit '' `\n            #-validExitCodes\n```\n\nmyorg.com doesn't help you at all, and I don't want to put myorg url on the interwebs.\n. but I want to publish 100s of packages, for the world to consume, because chocolatey adoption would skyrocket, if people knew how to install/uninstall everything from Office to Exchange Server using just cinst. I just want to sanitize them.\n. we can certainly take this elsewhere.  there might even be an issue on this.\n. https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/269\n. The source code is always available.  Just rename nupkg to zip and extract the spec and ps1 files.\n. https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/210\n. what about write-output ? write-host = bad\n. we would still want customized parameters that can be created by the package owner, than could then be queried through a common syntax. perhaps listed through an xml tag in nuspec\n. Personally I use camelcase for id.  I like it to be poshy vs nixy. But I am ambivalant on setting a standard on that.\n. i think it should suggest a get-help or --help or some other usage information.  All the usage responses need obvious work.\n. I am a big fan of http://semver.org/\n. Passing it to the chocolatey gods for sacrifice... love it\n. not really relevant to .org but for my internal repo I git back all my packages and use https://github.com/rismoney/chocolatey-git\n\nI started making trivial tests for recognizing busted pkgs.\n. thanks... So here is how we manage the package repo internally.\n\nso we start with our git repo, setup very much like https://github.com/ferventcoder/chocolateyautomaticpackages\n\nthe difference being that each time we create or bump a version of the package we git tag it, and push to our internal gitrepo.  This allows for peer review.    The build.ps1 script is then able to iterate through every tag in the repo, and spit out the nupkg file into a dir.  We also run a bunch of validation scripts on the package as a form of package unit testing using pester.  We are getting to a point where the cpush can only be done by the bot running all this.  We don't want to let users upload to the repo anymore, and feel the git review process is ideal for vetting the package before upload.  \n\nNow the chocolatey.org site has different intentions, but perhaps a CI validation process can be instituted.  After all I don't think its practical to host every package in a single gitrepo, and gitsubmodules are nontrivial for the layman.\n. imho, its overreaching for cpack.  the receiver should have a triager (along the lines of a CI model)\n. funny you should say that.  i hacked something pretty crude through appveyor that runs the test suite i have.   it doesn't have the ability to spin up vms... :( and they don't have PR hooks, only single branch hooks).  I ended up ditching it.\n\nbut last I heard travis is getting windows support, so when that drops, we might have something pretty awesome.\nbtw-travis is awesome.\n. Thats so awesome @mwrock !! can i make a suggestion?  if you are going to provide other hypervisor/cloud functions, you might have the start of something like a powershell fog (see fog.io)\n\nyou might have, and I haven't looked at the source yet, but I envision these as external componentry you can just bolt on and re-use outside of box-starter.\n. Can you elaborate more on this @Redsandro -https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/342#issuecomment-31094523\n\n I don't understand not running windows, virtual Choco users, where boxstarter fits...\n. I thought chocolatey goodness was as good as it gets.\n. agree with you ferventcoder- that was my understanding.  \n\ni think its a metric s-ton of a parsing exercise that probably needs to start with TDD via pester, and make each use case pass... just looking at this readme https://github.com/isaacs/node-semver made my head hurt.\n. @ferventcoder - is this alright for me to do?  I rebased and branched https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/273 but preserved the authorship...\n. have you tried the carat ^ escape?\nthats a cmd escape char which might work.   havent tried yiur specific example though.\n. Interestingly - I was asked this question a few days ago.   The long/short of it is that the chocolatey project doesn't directly manage the nuget and/or it's spec.  What you are suggesting here, is a change in nuspec functionality not chocolatey.  \n\nRight now, you can build this logic in via powershell with wmi, but it has its own set of downsides starting with ambiguous connections of packages.\n. > Why is this a change to the nuspec functionality? \n\ndependencies are defined in nuspec.   however there is no conditional logic around it.  It is only package to package dependencies.   foo.1.0 requires bar.2.0 or greater type stuff.\n\n> I would envision Chocolatey installing two empty packages when you install it. \n\nthis seems very hackish, to get at OS versions.  This overcomes package to package dependencies with a fake OS package.  But it only addresses OS dependency.  What about other logical dependencies?  For those am I just left with powershell?\n\nIdeally, I would want some dependency capability to do stuff like:\n\n``` xml\n<chooser>\n  <when $os=6.1>\n    <dependency 1/>\n  </when>\n  <when $os=6.2>\n    <dependency 2/>\n  </when>\n <else>\n    <dependency 3/>\n  </else>\n</chooser>\n```\n\nright now this all needs to happen in chocolateyinstall via just another cinst within a conditonal\n. i think so. ;)\n. I thought I wrote another reply to this- but I guess I didn't click comment...\n\nAn idea on this topic is to make the nuspec dependency element a parseable item around things like os, features, architecture and then have run-nuget or it's caller like install-chocolateypackage use a set of dependency helpers to do the needful...\n\n``` xml\n<dependency id=\"|os|\" version=\"6.2\" />\n```\n\nand we use dependency helpers based on the between the pipes or other delimiter.\n. I was under the impression this functionality was being abandoned.  For ex:  http://support.microsoft.com/kb/834489\n. You suspect L11 in chocolatey cmd as its missing /b?\nExit /b if run inside script shouldn't Close windows...only exit script.  Not near a pc but I will check out asap\n. Ok I get it.   Had you tried cmd /c successfully or do we need something clever.   - i have a few ideas on messing with the call parameters to be passed properly but got to work through edge cases. /? Is being treated as a separate param to call...\n. Ok.  That's fair.  Put that in.  I will later refactor to avoid expensive cmd sub calls\n\nI saw a post on stackoverflow re call issue and ways to deal with params being treated as a single one.  The quotes may be forcing delimiting %\\* as a call param rather than a choco param.   There is no %~\\* so I think the more elegant (read yucky dos quirky crap) solution involves forcing the entire param string into the a single first call argument.\n\n Ie\nChocolatey /? needs to be treated as 1 arg instead of 2 from a call perspective.\n. i think this is the link i found yesterday. (BryceatNetwork) response...\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/9396311/run-a-input-parameter-as-command-in-dos-batch-script\n. Agree with @mwrock wholeheartedly.  \n. Choco version is deprecated...use list or search.\n\n-------- Original message --------\nFrom: codearoo notifications@github.com\nDate: 11/26/2013 6:25 PM (GMT-05:00)\nTo: chocolatey/chocolatey chocolatey@noreply.github.com\nSubject: [chocolatey] choco version command should not do anything other than report its current version. (#382)\n\nRunning 'choco version' or 'chocolatey version' should be quick to just output the version number. But instead it's checking online to see if it's the latest.\nI believe that instead of doing that, it can output something like:\n\nname : chocolatey\nfound : 0.9.8.23\nPlease run 'choco version-check' to check if an update is available.\n\nor something to that nature.\n\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/382.\n. not sure if it helps you guys, but to get an effective && if powershell you would need\n\nwhoami ; if($?) {whoami}\n. i added the original uninstall capability as a naive implementation that requires chocolateyuninstall.ps1.  many pkgs dont have that capability.  its very ymmv at this point but its going to get a lot better as indicated above so stay tuned\n. I say go ahead!  I added the -specificfolder switch before we went 7za so imho it's a regression.\n. iirc this is an intentional omission. the msi guid is typically needed for uninstall.  i have a way of automating that but have not looked at it in a bit.  last i heard was we were looking at choco msi tighter integration overall with windows installer\n. usage:\n\n  $packageName = 'PuppetEnterprise'\n  $fileType = 'MSI'\n  $uninstallGuid = '{89BA3D80-5EEF-40BC-A7F9-9E234BEB0D46}'\n\n  Uninstall-ChocolateyPackage \"$packageName\" \"$fileType\" \"$uninstallGuid /norestart /qn\"\n. see\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/99/files\n. the purpose of that commit functionality comes from a requirement to be integrated in a non interactive environment.  if the functions blindly exit state 0s without exception raising then any automation around chocolatey where failures occur, the errors will be swallowed.  the outer lying tool will think everything was honky dory, when in reality failures occured.\nits not thrilling to me, but i was seeing exit success when failures occured.  I am using puppet with chocolatey.\n. all for the hashtables btw :)\n. > disabled the mandatory exit because it interfered with the ability to continue installing subsequent packages if one package failed \n\nimho the mandatory exit is the right and default behavior.  i agree a switch show control -ignorefailures...  i am a big proponent of fail early and stop all things.\n\nright now for better or worse its being called from puppet via chocolatey.cmd.  that uses -command\n. agree with you 100%.  Inserting proper exception management is needed.   My short term goal was selfish, get the error out.  Improvement is def needed and i think choco has longer term plans to go c# which will probably help resiliency overall.\n. ok someone submit pr and make sure non exit 0 is bubbled all the way back out to cmd/posh on any failure.\n. so if there is a separate md5 file, do you grab that file, get content it into a var and append it like in your link?\n. This url switching is thus driven by a csv file I need to manually build after inspecting each package's chocolateyinstall.ps1 finding the url and mapping it to an alternate url?\n\nI suppose this is scriptable to generate a csv, but does this highlight a bigger issue with urls within packages?  It kills package portability.  Why wouldnt upstream adhere to using a url mapper too... packageid, url. \n\nBtw neat take on the approach!!\n\nI want to opensource my choco repo but do it in a way the pkgs could be used by someone w/o mods.\nThis is 1 approach.\n\nI was originally planning to make the hostname just an env var... but this wont help upstream internet based urls plus you could have foo.com/setup.exe and bar.com/setup.exe\n\n I am interested in ppls thoughts...\n. rebase on top of upstream/master?\n. succinctly, src/functions essentially should not be relied upon. whereas src/helpers/functions should be.\n. who pays the processing fee?\n. got it!\n. interesting, so if i can earn 5% rewards, and spend 2.9% to send a payment, plus 1% in fees, I can earn 1.1% profit, for every $500 I send to my own org ;)\n. Can you describe some of the design choices?  I would like to understand the intent. Any hidden aspects like http://lov5-77.diply.com/love-eat/30-famous-logos-that-have-a-hidden-message/51404\n. Ahh that's really interesting.  My thought was that it was a play on packaging.  I didn't realize it was chocolate :). I thought it was a box.  I really like it.  But would a transparent (no background) be the usage or would everything go yellowy?\n. I couldn't agree more with @ferventcoder comments.\n\nQ: Is the chocolate candy wrapper  too much.  In other words does it not go too faraway from a computer thing to a candy bar, leaving nothing behind?  I see why you showed us the squared off 1 first as I think I am warming up to the 1st one, but I think the \":\" colon is not needed.  choco will go well beyond windows\n. I was not against it.  I was inquiring.  I actually really like all the work you have done and have to express sincere kudos for your hard work and volunteering.  My hope for whatever logo that is chosen is that it represents choco to where its goodness becomes synomous with all the good people involved including you @juliankrispel.\n. Agree.\n\n```\nc:\\>ocalatey ftw! :)\n```\n. going to agree with @gep13  6 pops against the black background and the letters have a transparent magic quality.  I didn't notice this before, but I also love the near symmetry afforded by the C and the Y.\nIt certainly has a richness!\n. I would love to see one of these 2 go in as it has required me to fork for internal use.  I put the changes in that @ferventcoder unwound :) despite them being an ugly fix.\n. > Would love to see a new 0.9.8.x version.\n\n:+1: \n. This is a great idea.  Can we store the ignores in the config.xml where the sources will be?  This way a cup all accidental run does not have unintended consequences.\n. well if package foo.1.0.0 is on one source, but foo.1.0.1 is on another source, do you really want to cross sources?  My source names could be staging, test, dev, prod, and so latest might have different meanings.\n\nPerhaps we should store a source.txt file inside each package listed in the lib folder, and then use when performing a clist -lo -source example.com\n. I just saw this.   Precisely what I was thinking on the google board.  Are there challenges you see with this, because I think I can build something around this pretty easily.   I haven't worked with nuget long (or chocolatey more than a few days), but maybe this should ultimately address dependencies in nuspec.   Like force removal, manual step through dependencies,  or just the singleton specified.\n. I should have a pull request by Tues for uninstall sometime this weekend.  Just got it working!  Awesomeness\n. Agree on name for obvious reasons.\nI am not up to dependencies.   Have a few ideas, but all rely on persisting a dependency.file in some form.  Only until last dependency is removed can underlying be removed, unless forced.\nAgree on not prompting\n. Does chocolatey even know about dependencies or is this purely a nuget construct?\n. strictly nuget handling for now-\n\n@ferventcoder https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/functions/Chocolatey-NuGet.ps1#26 is each $line here the packages and dependencies returned by nuget?  \n\nWe can check if $line is not  match for $packagename (therefore it must be a dependency) to place a flag in \\lib\\$dependency, like dependency_of.XYZ.ver\n\nThat's trivial.\n\nThe uninstaller then needs to do what?  We instead save $nugetOutput L24 to \\lib\\$packagefolder and reparse it at uninstall time.\n\nFurther we can make L 29+ we can make it install/uninstall agnostic.\n. so before write-chocolatey-failure.ps1 is called during an cinst then a remove-item needs to occur on \\lib\\$packagename.\nI find myself deleting \\lib\\$packagename manually on fails regularly.\n. So I took in your change LucidSage- I like the bulk of what you are attempting!  I am confused as it now uses the nuget registered source list (you add chocolatey.org) to that list during setup?\n\nWhat if I have my own internal repo?  I run nuget sources?  Where does chocolatey read in the sources? I didn't read the whole pull-req.\n\nI was really hoping for a chocolatey sources command to not mess with nuget, but this might be solid.\n. Awesome, thanks for the clarification!  It might be easy to cherry pick most of your commits and just leverage a specific config file.    I had been search/replacing all this since I run a chocolatey org internal and didn't want to use actual internet chocolatey.org\n. I am not sure how ;)... I haven't built unit tests for powershell, though I would like to learn.\n. Wow Pester looks like an awesome project and I like how you used it.  I am not sure if I have the cycles to dive into crafting this (maybe 1-2 months before I can revisit pester) since it would be yak shaving against my short term continous integration objectives. \n. tyvm!\n. you're awesome.  thanks for acceptance into your project!  btw-I just hecked out some blogs you wrote, and enjoyed the content, particularly the remote workers/highly collaborative stuff.\n. Great idea-Thoughts on this- cinst msi1,msi2,msi3 -arguments '/quiet'.  the msiexec call-outs should use start-process -Wait to enusure async.\n. I think by default if no uninstall path is provided, it tries to find it automatically perhaps via reglookup or similar wmi query.\n\n2 relevant links \nhttp://community.spiceworks.com/how_to/show/2238\nhttp://www.vbforums.com/showthread.php?t=598355\n. the web installer version still uses that big file, then right? just clarifying half a dozen folders i got here ;)\n. trying to use the version from _packaged_output... i think i just needed to run chocolateyinstall.ps1\n. all good 9.8.16 =big.  i have like choc-ultimate, choc-build, choc-current, choc-lucid, choc-myco, and thought i was losing my mind.  i got probs and should go to bed.\n. I now see the paradox in requesting a pull not for pulling :-) Is the right thing to do creating a gist or repo link?\n\non a more relevant note-I wanted to make a func where the user doesn't need to specify a guid for uninstall.ps1 for msi.  looking up the code at uninstall time won't be reliable.  so I thought if we can grab it during install we know it is definitely associated with that package.  the question becomes where to put it.  I know you were working on additional persistence so I didn't want to just drop it in lib\n. i think that is solid thinking.  for msi, chocolatey uninstall can and should be optional for ease of use, but you still want to call that if it exists. \n\nthis way you can execute a post msi task.  for instance a remove-item -recurse on a folder the msi doesn't clean up every now and again.  \n\nAs I type this, I am now wondering if there should be a chocolatey-pre-uninstall ps1.  For instance if something runs as a service, I might want to stop them/taskill whatever to insure msi doesn't complain about something being open.\n. I finally had some time to look at this.   I think it is close, I just need to test it a bit.  \n. do i not have it right?  I thought it was dropping in a join-path $env:chocolateyinstall`\\lib $packageName\n\nthe code does not change for each install.  it is unique product code per package.  for example package1.1.1.msi will also be the same code on every system.   package 1.1.2 will be a unique product code (at least thats how i  read it - i could be wrong)\n\nside by side installs aren't possible with msi, unless some transform magic or a wrapper that provides a unique product code for additional installs is built in.\n. rebased obviously.  this now requires fix_zipfolderpath PR for the environment variable.  need to retest later today hopefully.\n. added some crazy msi file dumping to assist with whatprovides for msi\n\nneed to retest...\n. thats an interesting idea. \n. i have thought about toying with honing a registry event hook for the uninstall key.  i wanted to unify ARP with choco.\ni think i can do it.\n\nsome thoughts were\npreserving regkeys\nif choco does it then stronger packaging reqts are needed.  ie matching arp name with title for instance.\nwe want to minimize choco making assumptions.  it has to be deterministic.\n. thinking everything not just msi\n\nthe uninstall string is dynamically created by the installer service itself.  in msi this is not provided beyond the guid.\n\nessentially i see swapping this uninstall key for cuninst pkgname.  it works awesome.\ni also considered append to that key and call chocolateyunistall -arp to have it just do a minimal amt of cleanup.  \n\ni have this stuff on my todo list but i am swamped with projects. \n. interesting ideas. the diff would be interesting.  Plus there is 32 bit and 64 bit keys... also not sure what would happen with depdendency packages. lot of variables in this thing.\n\nwhen does the garbage collection function get called?\n. awesome.. so does this particularly address the author that does not provide the chocolateyuninstall.ps1and this attempts the needful basee on reg diffs of uninstall keys?\n. i can do this, no prob\n. what level is this for-- fault tolerance, package availability, or both?  like would a test-ping on the array members be sufficient, or if the package is not found try the next source, etc?\n. Did you pull request the wrong branch?\n. I have some posh code that might make the hashing virtually invisible to package authors and users.  Need to sort out a few details.  cpack sounds  right for authors.   checksum files, nupkg, scripts,  dirs, we have options.   Have not given this thought, but I just played with headlock a bit the other day and may have an concept\n. the ftp PR conflicts w/ this iirc.  i feel a rebase for someone :)\n. Going back to the original message - has anyone tried changing the buffers in get-webfile?  I bumped that all the way up to 1048576 and helped a ton...\n. I think we should re-invigorate this-  \n\nThe guys here are putting logic in chocolateyuninstall to see if the binary that was already downloaded exists.  if so then use it, otherwise they are re-fetching it.  this should be built into chocolatey, to eliminate the verbosity in the chocolateyuninstall.  i like it minimal.\n. so this was created on master branch.\nCan you bring this changes in via a new branch?  I think you need to close this PR and open a new one.\nI would also do a git rebase -i upstream/master (assuming the upstream is chocolatey/chocolatey) and fixup your 2nd commit.\n\nI am also going to look at the code now to see if anything stands out.  After you do that, and reopen a PR I will test your change and try to move forward.  I know you have been really patient.\n. also make sure you do a git fetch upstream and a git rebase upstream master to ensure there are no conflicts that need to be reconciled as stuff has changed since you first contributed.\n. agree - \n\nI'll threadcrap - but I think the contributing should use this workflow.\n\nassuming git remote is named upstream for chocolatey/chocolatey\ngit checkout -b <new feature>\nmod make changes.\ngit push --set-upstream origin foo\nmake more changes\ngit push origin \ngit fetch upstream\ngit rebase upstream/master\n\ngit push -f origin (remote username/chocolatey).

Be nervous on master. \nopen PR and then \ngit fetch upstream\ngit rebase upstream/master regularly until your PR is approved if commits go in before yours\n. yes\n. would these be ps1? psm... would an example be say - an iis helper?\n. https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/chocolatey/VougffEcvSE\n. pull request 119 supercedes this and includes all the changes in this (118)\nI wasn't sure how to build branches on branches since I have been using 119 in my prod environment, and 99% of the changes were in chocolatey-version.ps1\n\nWhile this PR does fix everything noted in the above commit msg, it proved to be too slow for an instantaneous query need of what is installed according to chocolatey.  So I added more logic to the file and issued a separate PR : https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/119\n. agree - better name.   is there an example of a switch you set globally?  like -pre? \nok, let me revise.\n. I think this now works a lot better - I appreciate the advice.   I was looking at some advance param stuff and it gets wonky with multiple optional parameters if unnamed.\n. ~~i think am going to change the output for localonly to a more meaningful (vs. the unavailables)~~\n~~packagename==version~~\n\n~~I think that is pretty common, pip and some other *nix package managers use that in some scenarios.~~\n\n~~otherwise working with the puppet provider I have 3 layers of escape chars, ruby, dos, and posh and it is ambigious.~~\n. simplified commit\n. I have this in another outstanding pull request... :)\nThat is why you had an issue... The provider is based on my repo, and pending upstream acceptance\n. This also a change prepped, -lo or localonly\n. you can grab my changes https://github.com/rismoney/chocolatey if you'd like.  i started down the exact path you seem to have arrived at.  i think it was just chocolatey-version.ps1 for the query changes and chocolatey.ps1 for the switch capability. hope that helps.  feel free to mod it since i just hacked a few other providers to cobble something together, since my ruby knowledge is 1 week in.\n. cver all -localonly or cver all -lo will do this. \nnot sure about chocolatey list -installed off the top of my head, but if we want this, it should be trivial...\n\npersonally i don't understand the difference between list and version... ;)\n. what version of chocolatey are you running?

I am sure xp/win7 compatibility, uac and folder perms factored in. \n\npersonally I tend to like it on c:\\ because it is somewhat of an entity unto itself - sort of part of the os, but not, but should be :) plus everything is in one spot, making tweaking and fixing easy.  Microsoft never had a clear model like http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/09/linux-file-system-structure/ and so things need to be forced a bit.\n\nI am not sure how you addressed per user installs, per computer, if at all...\n\nI also think it (can't recall) but it sets some variables on the user level, and not machine which i need to look at.  \n. oh, i left out the info you might want - i think the environment variable ChocolateyInstall determines the path where the installer puts it...\n. Program files, with lib in Ugh hidden c:\\programdata would be standard?\n\nBut I like it on sysroot since I treat a pkg mgr different than a traditional app. My coworker wants it on d:\\chocolatey in prod \n. reference-http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/s2esdf4x.aspx\n. @nathanaeljones If you are thinking of installing beneath program files, don't... UAC, gets in the way.  and gem installs will bust. And spaces get ugly... Anywhere else (off root, for example) should be fine.\n. speaking of get-webfile, i swapped in several newer ones for testing - http://poshcode.org/?lang=&q=get-webfile.  I was troubleshooting what I perceive to be slow x-fers on a 10g network.  v 4.1 is significantly SLOWER than the 3.x series.  The issue turned out to be tweaking autotuninglevel and ramping up the buffers from 4096... but whatever was done in 4.1 is slower.\n\nBack on topic - I HATE passing passwords directly from cli.   get-credential requires interaction...maybe something with securestring would work?\n. No config file as of yet, except for sources.\n\n I apologize.  I don't hate pw at cli.   I actually had a conversation with someone on the topic of pw in files that ended up in version control... You can guess where that went.\n\nWhat you are describing does sound reasonable.  \n\nDoes the getweb file support http://user:pw@url syntax?  I know modern browsers disallow it...\n. I think you would want this flexibility on updating as well...  i wouldn't want to cinst pkgname -ignoredependencies and then cup pkgname and get extra stuff.  we should log the initial argument usage for future default preferencing that particular package.  now that I think about it, uninstalls might need a -deletedependency...\n. I an not familiar with the particulars of ruby devkit but I think, that ignoredependencies, would just cause chocolateyinstall.ps1 to execute without the nugety goodness... Am I over simplifying?\n\nSo, I am not sure this would fix your use case.\nWe probably need to track dependencies in both directions...\n. what should it have done in your opinion, upgrade the existing one to 1.9.3?\nruby is an interesting use case, because like java (good/bad) you can take on many concurrent versions... i run a few actually.\n\ni wouldn't trust running the ps1 w/o the dependencies in place. how do you know macler installed 7zip?    if he ignores dependency and 7zip is heavily used in chocolatey-install.ps1, then he will get a boos all over. should those then be supressed because he ignored, and now he is in his own world of support/hurt.\n. http://poshcode.org/3537\n\nGoing to test this one- 7 week's old...\n. yea, i went to the authors website- http://mnaoumov.wordpress.com/2012/07/24/powershell-add-directory-to-environment-path-variable/ and right at the top, is his note...:( fail\n. i'd want to use exclusively system variables.  so what do i need to do exactly?\n\nis there a problem with passing params to InstallChocolatey.ps1 that this can't be done within it? isn't that what's in the bit.ly url that gets invoked?  \n. I was shooting for an optional switch if specified, while running under admin that could do it for me :)  I have been installing chocolatey on 400 servers and I have seen some bizzare issues with environment path modification and powershell putting in 2 semi-colons or none.  \n. I saw a discussion here - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4225748/how-do-i-pass-named-parameters-with-invoke-command which uses script blocks- somewhat convoluted.\n. @ferventcoder \n\n> To go to system, it would just take adding them manually and applying this fix for now.  I think in the future we could make the installer smarter.\n\nAgree. Can we do a git fetch upstream and git rebase upstream/master (assuming your chocolatey/chocolatey remote is upstream).   Lets get the innovation, but lets get @abombss to a git rebase -i  fixup on the 2nd commit, especially since it mods the same file, and we want every commit to stand on its own as workable going forward.\n. it returns \"does not appear to be on the source specified\" if the $versionlatest is empty.  \n\nwhat happens when you just do a nuget list kdiff3 for example?\n\nWhat is in the list.log in your chocolateyinstall folder after you run chocolatey update all?\n. list.log should contain the output of all packages like you listed for kdiff.\nif that file doesn't have the information, you get the errors you see.  lets first make sure it is resolving nuget before going into details.\n\ngo into C:\\chocolatey\\chocolateyinstall.\ntype \n\n```\n. .\\chocolatey.ps1\n$nugetExe\n```\n\ndoes it return C:\\Chocolatey\\chocolateyInstall\\nuget.exe ?\n. didn't forget about this- i will test further, probably next week in my chocolatey lab.  the issue is definitely $versionlatest being empty, but need to instrument it first hand.\n. did the line-feeds or spacing change?  not sure why it shows the whole file changed...\n. I don't have a proxy requiring auth so I will punt.  It looks trivial, as if you don't provide the switch, its a noop.\nI am going to just flag this for updating documentation. before merge/closure.\n. bump this would rock - i have had ppl ask me about this.\n. this approach is actually really clever.  \n\nSeveral questions - Do we need a \"windowsfeatures\" added to chocolatey-uninstall?   Can multiple features be specified on the same line?   I know the dism /online /enable-feature can take an unlimited number of /featurename: switches.\n\nLOVE THIS PR!\n\nAside:\nI am going to modify the puppet chocolatey provider to support just the sources param, since everything else is \"in place\".    .  The more I think about it, the more I think chocolatey is the ultimate provider for puppet on windows.    \n. say i wrote a helper chocolatey-restart that simply closes the active session and reopens a fresh posh. is this invasive? would it work?\n\nanother random thought-maybe wmi event consumers can track the change to env vars...\n. Did you have an idea on holding cell?\nAre you implying that any error in chocolateyinstall.ps1 does not unwind to a clean state upon error?\n. The only \"thinking\" chocolatey does is check lib.\n-force kills thinking\n. are you suggesting then, that if there is a failure, then the $packagefolder then just be moved to something like \\failures\\$packagefolder?   i would think that it should also run chocolateyuninstall.ps1 with a silentlycontinue...  There is no way to know the \"impact\" of errors since anything could have happened.  Also worthy, is everything needs to get logged...\n. @ferventcoder - \"don't pull yet - pull requests\" - where have i seen that before?\n. oh snap.  it does!  good job! \n\nmaybe it needs refinement to provide a bit more user friendliness.   Right now, is the end user supposed to just \"guess\" what the params are?\n. It needs to be fixed for full functionality.\n\nCannot run say /? Because it won't cleanup, which we know about.\n\nThe Params should be at the discretion of the package creator, and they should publish a list.  This way it doesn't need to execute the binary for help.\n\nParams might also cross multiple helpers.  I unzip a set of folders to Param1 then install chocolatey install to param2\n. say i install 2 msi's.  i want to pass /qn to one and /quiet to another.  then i want to install a zip.\nthe developer has to have control over what goes where.   \n\nin https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/160  I'd want in chocolateyrun.ps1 a function usage()\n\nwhat cross my mind earlier is to make some sort of chocolatey  DSL like pester (which i haven't looked at yet)\n. no dice fellahs.  env var's are string only.\n\nref:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/13128284/using-non-string-as-env-variable\n. I think I wanted to have a function help() too... and maybe uninstall should go in same file...\n. > @rismoney @Iristyle Interesting idea proposed by you guys - the chocolateyInstall.ps1 becomes > chocolateyRun.ps1 and in it it contains functions that chocolatey will call \n> \n> powershell\n> function ShouldInstall {}\n> function InstallSteps {}\n> function ConfigureSteps {} #optional, in case folks want things installed but not configured.\n> function UninstallSteps {}\n\nIf we did this, I need to it work for existing packages, so if functions don't exist it has to just call chocolateyinstall.ps1\nas it does today.\n. heh, I left off initial mechanics of the idea-\n\nif (test-path chocolateyrun.ps1) \n. .\\chocolateyrun.ps1\n\nif (test-path function:\\shouldinstall) {run it} repeat where applicable.\nremove function on success (cleanup)\n\ndeco chocolateyinstall.ps1 through attrition.\n. as for the steps shouldinstall,installsteps, configuresteps, uninstallsteps\n\nI think this could also provide the mechanism to support downgrade.  (steps to preserve config files, uninstall reinstall, whatever)\n\nisinstalled (instead of just lib checking) let the package creator define what it means to be installed - does a regkey/file exist for example?)  very useful in .exe where unwinding/detecting is not necessarily in reg.\n\ninfo\nswitch usage - package help - verbosity, dependency listings, version whatever\n. The change looks trivial to me, but how do you call the chocolatey installer with a different url?  I am not familiar, because I use nuget.exe to install from internal chocolatey.org, since it requires a single exe drop (and dotnet4).  Found that to be the best way, because I maintain custom chocolatey builds that aren't in lock step with ferventcoders releases.\n. ditto. no issue for merge. sad 7 months went by.\n. brown fudge, by any other name, would it be sweet? lol\n\nits what yum calls it... I think apt-get uses apt-file search... \nhows about chocolatey filesearch ?  lookup, filelookup, seek, frisk, pry, dig, or taste, reach.\n\nI thought whatprovides was explicit...It tells you what package provides the file.  not as problematic as the cunst.\n. hmmm.  its not so useful yet I guess to determine console.exe is installed by console2.  What about a .dll it dropped in system32.  \n\nthe goal is to be able to track down the \"source\" of any file on the system and make every file traceable back to a package.  at work we are going to mandate that every single piece of software we deploy is sourced from our chocolatey feed.\n\nRight now it is just filename matching.  Imagine this future script /tool in my hopper:\nCreate list of all files on a system and subtract out all known OS files AND package files (the latter always been difficult).\nThen track the rest of the files deltas day over day and allow exception list.\n\nA true rogue file report.  Plan to do this on servers at 2am nightly\n. The package creator needs to provide filelist.txt if using non msi or zip currently...\n\nCrude yes, also worthy to note that whatprovides does not mean does provide...\n\nThe latter would require procmon style inspection or other scanning.\n\nI just thought it might be useful to the community.\n\n---\n\nFrom: Rob Reynolds\nSent: Mon, 24/09/2012 05:10 PM\nTo: chocolatey/chocolatey chocolatey@noreply.github.com\nCC: Siegel, Richard RSiegel@ise.com\nSubject: Re: [chocolatey] chocolatey whatprovides [filename](#168)\n\nSo I install a tool package - that tool uses bin dir so it installs to something like c:/tools/packagename where it auto adds a that directory to the path. How do I trace that back to the package itself as it wouldn't be as easy to find?\n\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/168#issuecomment-8834886.\n. whatprovides is akin to yum whatprovides.  I think its kind of neat and more of a nice to have feature to grow on.   I am ambivalant if this makes it into the codebase.  It was more an experiment that worked... \n. ok - its not perfect implementation (what is?). but here is the usage-\n\nI have a file on my system.  I am not sure if it was from a chocolatey package install, malware, a download, whatever.  I install everything from zip or msi currently.  So I see a file that looks suspect.  I want to see if it came from inside a package.   Since zips (currently) and msi's will be able to log all the files they encompass, we can use that get-content and seach the txt file to determine if a file is rogue (not sourced from a chocolatey package) or we deployed it.  Its not a dead on thing, but it could be a nice feature.  \n\nIdeally I would want have lists from all the operating systems files and then be able to identify every binary file on a host.  It can become really helpful with system32, ruby versions, etc. \n. This PR and the associated #164 haven't been updated in 7 months.   Can we take this in as an advanced user improvement, that if someone down the line wants to simplify and improve, it can be part of a refactor?  I think there is value in the code.\n\nI'd probably fixup the commits and amend the commit msg, to be inclusive of the others.\n. your the boss ;)  how do you back that branch to the parent commit and then pull the changes.  I was just trying to assist as I know there are a ton of PRs and don't want to stifle progress for project newcomers who think they won't get merged. However I can help, let me know.\n. speaking of continuous integration ;)  eliminate direct contributions to chocolatey.org.   have all packages go through a unified gitrepo (even gitsubmodules).   use git hub hooks like on a merged pull request to trigger a cpush.  take the user out of the owner, and turn it into package curators, and contributors.  no direct upload for packages...\n. running alpha2 build now, and the bizarre thing is that it appears slower because it is updating more relaxedly, but is actually faster...  agree with you mwrock-awesome!\n. i see no issue here.  i had no opinion on the status bar.  \n\nglad to see you are using puppet and chocolatey together.  how is that working out for you?\n. registrytreechangeevent could be used to find if uninstall string was added.  We replace with cuninst... Or we do it with helper and its up to package creator to unify package.  Making assumptions even logical can result in busted items...\n. I found good com query but it neglects syswow on 64... Not sure how to fix it...\nCould be panacea, because win32 product wmi sucks and custom mof requires admin...\n. Cuninst should then call uninstall string...\n\nSo then chocolatey can uninstall packages it does not technically manage, albeit not silent... unless we add more logic :)\n. i tend to agree w/ you.  that fear would steer this responsibility to the package owner if he wants his app to be unified.\ndocumentation could detail this...\n\nalso chocolatey might make a data integrity error in trying to be smart into an app that would require an expert to unwind. \n\nthe other interesting thing is we can create a helper to add items to add/remove programs that don't normally get it (like tools) or zip packages, etc. its actually trivial.\n. The 42 seconds is why I added localonly...\n. I relooked at code- got confused, you just moved those lines around.  Its not new. My bad.\n. Ah ensure latest was expensive.   Thats why I switched to present in my manifests.   Need my prod env highly deterministic and latest could update something.\n\nAre you running choc.org internally, or running against the public site ?\n. I am not really sure how we want to do this...\nI started with converting chocolatey.ps1 to a function. This should help testing it.\n\nhttps://github.com/rismoney/chocolatey/blob/039afe39922298af8ba0d2ec74eaddf73f049c9b/src/chocolatey.ps1\n\nchoco could then be a very thin file to call Invoke-Chocolatey\n\ni welcome any input!\n. fyi - my old pull request (still out there)  fishes out the guid, during install, safe storing it to a txt file for later use...I have been meaning to get back to it...\n. interesting... i would have thought people would like to fail early and abort...  Personally I have a bunch of packages, and if a pre-req fails the success of post packages is usually botched as well. Otherwise why are they linked?\n\nPersonally I'd like to strive for idempotency to address @tomOne \"annoying and reduces UX\" issue.  chocolatey should just \"do the needful\"...I hate when I get a box of chocolates (that rocks!) - ie when it doesn't stop on error...\n\nMaybe if there are differing opinions there should be a silentlycontinue or similar switches via config file.\n.

This way we don't attempt an install on an msi that we know will bust with a pending reboot.\n\nor...

I am not understanding this at all.\n\nInstall-ChocolateyZipPackage can specify an unzip location of your choice.\nAlso it doesn't have to be all files. You can do partial unzips.\n\nI thought we had a helper for making links.\n. The complete parameters are listed in the files \nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/helpers/functions/Install-ChocolateyZipPackage.ps1\nIn this case, the 3rd parameter allows you to specify unzip location and the 5th allows you to unzip a single folder within the zip.\n\nso \ninstall-chocolateyzippackage mypackage http://myurl32bit C:\\extractionpoint http://myurl64bit onlythisfolder\n\nThe params should probably be named, re-positioned and cleaned up, but it will work.\nAs far as the links, I think @mwrock added a bunch of functionality for links, shortcuts, etc but I haven't any experience with it.  Look in https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/tree/master/src/helpers/functions\n.

Git rebase -i upstream/master\nChange the bottom 4 commits to fixup instead of pick\nThen git push -f origin\n. As long as he pushes to his origin its fine.  Its only a nono on chocolatey chocolatey master\n. Needs to make sure remotes are set right of course\n. I don't think we should take this in.   It needs to be reconciled with the existing one. \nIf there are specific use cases for one vs the other then conditional logic can apply the right call...\n. https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/helpers/functions/Get-WebFile.ps1#L46 is this not doing cookie handling? I am not all that familiar with cookie handling in general.\n. I do like the ignore cert switch in theory, but not in practice.  A package author should not be sending consumers of the package to https sites that don't have valid certificates.   I believe that is a call the _end user_ should make, and question the authenticity of the underlying url.\n. > Interesting...we have made choco silent by default. This seems to go against that idea. Should this not be a pkg then?\n\nIts not against the idea.  Bypassing a tenet of an https request is the offense.\nI like ignore, but that is a user call, not a author call.  If I am going to a https site, and the name, CA or date is jacked up I am going to most certainly question if I want this on my system.  \n\nThis is a helper, and doesn't expose the ssl bypass capability to the cli/end user.\n\nIf we wanted silent then it would need to work akin to:\ncinst foo -ignore-ssl-errors\n. getbits?  lol - isn't get-processorAddressWidth or something more appropriate - though wordier for sure ;)\n. asserts changed in new pester, particularly around piping...\nI really like this PR.\n\nAnd I would rebase fixup your commits so its a clean bisectable history.  With all the outstanding PRs we need to make sure if we introduce a bug, we can use git bisect and git blame successfully going forward.\n.

It really is awesome.   I hope I can get a lot of posh people on it at the summit this week. I Cant stand codeplex.\n. wow even this needs to be rebased and reconciled... \n. I will have a look at this as I added this in PR 114.  The functionality here, creates a text file within the package lib folder that lists all the files that were extracted.  The goal of this was to use this text file generated during install to at some later point \"uninstall\" the zip, which essentially iterates through the file delete all entries listed. \n\nIt might be helpful for me to test this, by outputing the var's to see if something amiss in particular to this specific zip file.  I haven't run into this bug and we deploy our entire app w/ zips so its runtime .  I wonder if this particular zip file has deeply nested subfolders, and we're hitting a limitation I need to check for or take into account.\n\nThe impact here for this, is that chocolatey uninstall zip will not have a proper text file to use and clean up the extraction.\n. a lot of the commands need to be cleaned up... good suggestion though.\n. This is really novel.  I am a fan.   I bet we can use this beyond zip... like all the tools, gems, and non msi stuff.\n+1\n. You are not missing anything.  It feels somewhat of an antipattern, from knowing what was installed to knowing what was supposed to be installed...  in this case the actuals might be preferred...  the real issue is native zip capabilities suck.\n\nFor an zip exe though this might work really well as a helper\n. I am not really sure what a plug-in would look like.  Everything in powershell is sort of an add on.  What is the tie in point?  That chocolatey would auto-dot source anything in location, and \"learn\" it?   \n\nAre you thinking like chocolatey config network mynic.xml?\n. https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/HelpersInstallChocolateyPackage\n. so what exactly are you doing... you must be missing some steps-  the commands work for me relative to notepad.exe\n\nare you creating nuspec ,packing it, putting the chocolatey.ps1 in tools, etc?\n. delete relevant files out of the C:\\Users\\%username\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\chocolatey. there could be lock there.\n. @ferventcoder is this an admin thing? \ndid you start powershell by rightclicking 'run as administrator' ? never really looked at start-choc...\n. @kellyelton-\nto troubleshoot i might add make a copy of start-chocolateyprocessasadmin.ps1\nthen add\n\nL37 $s\nL38 $psi\nand see what values it is trying to use, and work back from there.\n\nalso are you sure cloversetup /silent is valid?  have you run it interactively with that switch and it works?\n. had you seen https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/210?  I tried to deal with process exits throughout all of chocolatey.\n\nbtw- linux-vm looks really _really_ awesome.   \n. I completely relate.  My main concern was to always exit 1 if there was a failure on any of the functions.  I recently delved into puppet/ruby so my main concern was to never return an exit 0 if something went wrong which is the current behavior.  It's funny, when I use chocolatey interactively i never use the batch files.  when i use it programmatically via puppet i used the bat files. its because i never use cmd, so its silly for me to call a batch to call powershell if i am already in it.\n\nunrelated, but calling posh from ruby strangely irks me with powershell.exe, maybe for the opposite reason.  If I can run an exec, and call the bat, then i avoid the powershell.exe\n\nI haven't found a great method to interact with powershell via ruby, particularly for multi-line code blocks.\n. the uninstall _should_ be deleting the lib... assuming there is an uninstall\n. I guess I wasn't clear. I wasn't really directing comments :innocent: \n\nI think a fail install should call cuninst, and we should stop on the last successful dependency.  Don't leave the unwinding to the end user.  A cuninst will actually perform a delete of chocolatey.lib.  In this scenario I might silent all stdout/stderr unless debug, and report a failed install has been unwound on package foo.  Further investigation may be necessary.\n\nI am comparing it to an msi, that fails midway, and then the progress bar goes in reverse, and usually leaves :shit: in far worse places than my lib.  love the emoji's btw.\n. Hes not going to be able to install anything upstream unless he rolls his own pkgs.\n. iirc my PR will handle all the exit code failures - https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/210\n\nI know @ferventcoder has been very busy as the PRs have been building up, so I guess patience or perhaps he responds to :cookie:s  lol.. , or if you are so bold, try my branch out and see if it addresses your issue...  It is not guaranteed though to make it in choco so, you are on your own in that regard, but I will say that I run the changes in this branch in my production environment with 1000 servers w/o issue.\n. @abombss you mean like this? ;)\n\nI don't know what the full potential of scriptcs is... \nhttps://github.com/rismoney/puppet-baremetal-windows/blob/master/make_pe/runtime/get-DHCPHostname.ps1\n. I thought msft should have scrapped PowerShell in favor of ruby.net\n\nAnd ditch cmd and not have powershell.exe be so expensive to call out to.\n. Nuget is awesome, but it is constraining imho, like customizinf nuspec... Folks on the irc powershell channel don't have anything nice to say about chocolatey's wrapper approach.  But I have yet to see anyone else do better.\n\nRebuilding nuget in native powershell would be a lot of work...\n. I do like the cinst ruby -clean   - That makes sense to me.  The old versions can be determined using the -version all functionality I just wrote as a PR a few minutes ago against the current.\n\nNow enter cup notepadplusplus.  When you cinst it, you get the latest. perfect! \nIf a new version comes out, and you cup it, you get 2 folders in lib but only 1 version is installed.  A new version comes out again, and you cup it 3 folders.  In actually you only have 1 version of notepadplusplus.\n\nIn this use case- you want the cup process to automatically delete the lib folder for the version 1 rev behind. An upgrade is just that, a replacement of the version you specify (or replace latest if unspecified).  Its not a side by side install, and i think chocolatey doesn't do much different for a cup.\n\nI think in the case of ruby, most users are not going to cup ruby, and instead cinst the version they want.  \n. Maybe cup should delete all versions. I think that's what yum update might do. \n\nOtherwise cinst...\n. i understand what you are saying about pinning, which I am down with.  Do you think this should be a 'feature' of the config file?  say a pinned packages element.   Do we leave this up to the user to populateor leave it to package authors to tamper with chocolatey.config? (ugh-security)...\n\nI have a production request to nail down the default behavior for cup.  Its getting to the point, where package authors are building crazy logic into chocolateyinstall.ps1...  chocolateylib is gettting messy.\n\nIf there are areas where we are giving the users a choice, like in your uninstall example, we also need command line switches to force behaviors for non-interaction. \n. any interest in a helper like this: (taken from one of our sysadmins who used it in a recent package) I horrendously adapted it for understandiing\n\n```\nFunction ChocoCleanUp {\n  #Clean up previous installs out of lib folder if they exist\n  $chocolateyLib = 'c:\\chocolately\\lib'\n  $packagever = \"1.2.3\"\n\n  Write-Host \"* Cleaning up legacy lib folders in c:\\chocolatey\" -foreground green -background black\n  Remove-Item $chocolateyLib\\$packageName* -Force -Recurse -Exclude $chocolateyLib\\$packageName.$packageVer -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue\n  Write-Host \"* Done\" -foreground green -background black\n}\n```\n. so are we needing a -pin switch, and what does it do?  Touch a pinned.txt 0 byte file in it's lib?\nand if it's not there, we do something like the helper I put above?\n\nTrying to understand how we should be creating future packages...\n. do you pin during install, or do you pin as a separate op, or both should be supported.\nie\n\nMethod 1.\nchoco install sysinternals -pin\n\nMethod2.\nchoco install sysinternals\nchoco pin sysinternals\n. > We do not remove the previous version at all when a new version comes in by design. You can install two versions of ruby\n\nthis whole topic confuses me, and a lot of ideas.\nQ:\n1. Should we have the install and uninstall call a function ChocoCleanUp if a pin is not set?\n2. Should we push this responsibility to the package author?  So a ruby package author wouldnt call chococleanup, but a notepadplusplus would?  I don't like this idea as it adds unnecessary clutter to authorship.  Right now this is what our sysdmins have to do, due to lack of options. Or should they have the ability as \"just another option\"\n3. we need a choco pin shim (lol, it just sounds funny) \n4. we need a choco pin param in config mgmt providers - (Kinda why I suggested Method 1 for ease)\n. overall we probably need a refactor of this function (probably a whole bunch of them) but anyway-\n\n this adds the ability to get alist of all versions of a product installed. \ni welcome thoughts.  I based this off, the current master, as I have modded chocolatey.ps1 and version in another PR for error handling, so if those get merged first, I will rebase those mods back in.\n. Ok - so this is confusing...as clist and cver have been for quite some time. But I think we are missing the intent for this PR.\n\nI am running the current source version now...

Are you just talking about on chocolatey.org? or via chocolatey itself?\n\nthe nuspec file defines the dependencies.  The issue right now in how chocolatey works for the latter is that we are grabbing the nupkg file and popping it into \\lib.  If we handled this in temp (for example) or another means, it would allow us to inspect the nuspec for dependencies, and report back to the user.  \n\nRight now the reliance on nuget.ee is both really helpful to making something work, and a hindrance to innovating.  I am wondering if we need more than a wrapper for it to really move choco forward.   I really like that its powershell though.\n. I think nuget.extensions has a graphing capability against a whole feed.\nhttp://ben.phegan.name/index.php/2012/07/02/nuget-graph/\n. also I would do a git rebase -i and fixup the second commit to make it look like one.\n. yes.  we should strive to keep a clean timeline moving forward.  a couple of things here:\n1.  create new branch\n2.  cherry pick changes into new branch or checkout -b newbranch, and then git reset --hard his master.\n3.  rebase. \n4.  then the maintainers should not do a gui based merged.  these are --no-ff and create a merge commit on top.  This makes the graph bumpy.  If we want a timeline that is easily bisectable we should try to get merges that are --ff and encourage small single commit continuous changes.  also when we leverage the testing frameworks this will help us immensely.\n. can you fixup your commit 2,3 into the 1st one?\n\nassuming upstream is the (chocolatey/chocolatey)\ngit rebase -i upstream/master\nswitch commit 2 and 3 from pick to fixup\n\nthen git push -f origin (zipp1981/chocolatey)\n. yes. a single commit:\n\nHere are my remotes:\n\nC:\\gitrepos\\chocolatey [patch-1]> git remote -v\norigin  git@github.com:rismoney/chocolatey.git (fetch)\norigin  git@github.com:rismoney/chocolatey.git (push)\nupstream        git@github.com:chocolatey/chocolatey.git (fetch)\nupstream        git@github.com:chocolatey/chocolatey.git (push)\n\nso if I first do a:\ngit fetch upstream\ngit rebase upstream/master  \n\nIt will put your 3 commits at the end of the current timeline.\n\nThen you can do an interactive rebase:\ngit rebase -i upstream/master\n\nThis will open a text editor where you can manipulate your commits interactively.\nYou can meld the commits together into the first commit, by switching the first word from pick to fixup inside the editor and save/close.  This will make it a single commit.\n\nThen you can git commit --amend can allow you to put the appropriate verbiage reflecting your change.\n\nYou will need to git push -f origin for it to go back into your origin, because you changed history through amending or interactively rebasing.\n\nHTH,\nRich\n\nIf you are not sure, just make a copy of the file first into a different dir just to test it out.\n. just to clarify- \n\nthe first commit is pick\nthe 2nd and 3rd should be fixup\n. yea (especially since I never use any font except notepad++ and powershell prompt) :smile:\n. its called cver.

The current release of chocolatey isn't complete for puppet as it requires the mods in my outstanding PRs...  \n\nwhen you say does not work properly, what are you experiencing?  I just want to confirm you aren't experiencing a different issue.\n. that does sound like the exit code issue on the cver query.  \n\ntechnically, what I think is happening in this case- it is not doing a ensure latest.  The cver query is failing to determine a package is installed, so it is atempting to cinst package. \nI think that is why I wrote this -\n\nhttps://github.com/rismoney/chocolatey/commit/f8ec947be96a90f8934989188da58d1e241a241e\n\nIts part of the https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/210 \n. First I appreciate your response.  \n\n> Talking specifically about the _.install/_.app package suffix - those are for the packages that have a native installer that they have bundled or they download and run.\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/ChocolateyFAQs\n\nAs far as a compelling reason, that is always going to be a curater vs author subject of contention.  I think even with a fair amount of rules, inevitably it can down to a per package decision.  When I look at other package/library solutions, like yum, gems, those decisions will appeal to some people and others will criticize.\n\nAs far as package research - I disagree wholeheartedly.   I manage 1000s of systems with chocolatey, and when you talk about scalability, if you manage 2 or more systems, the payoff is huge.  You should always research your packages.  For instance-\n\n.\\NuGet.exe install  -source http://chocolatey.org/api/v2/ beyondcompare\nand then look in the tools folder to see what it is actually doing.\n\nI have been thinking about what a chocolatey -whatif would look like, and perhaps this is a starting point.\n. @ferventcoder - i left that out intentionally, because I left it to the package author.  \nNot every package uninstalls via filename.\n\nUninstall-ChocolateyPackage '7zip' 'msi' '{23170F69-40C1-2702-0920-000001000000} /norestart /qn'\n\nOur oldest PR, actually can use the learned guid, so the author doesn't need to specify it... :)\n. @ferventcoder are you referring to HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall \n. gep13 I like that idea _A LOT_ \n\nhttps://github.com/blog/699-making-github-more-open-git-backed-wikis\n\nAs an alternate idea-\nI like the way the cli for git itself works.

Relying on the count of params is not a satisfactory test for batch mode.\n\nplus I agree with @ferventcoder that if you're changing one ingress into calling chocolatey we should make it consistent. Forking the functionality between cmd and powershell functionality is not ideal since the cmd is really a convenience factor for non-posh access\n. one last thing I might opt for array splat handling in posh or take the packages in via a pipeline, which means the source could be handled any way the user wants (objects)\n\nmaybe like 7zip vlc putty | chocolatey install\n. let me retest.

I googled this thrift shop and watched http://vimeo.com/m/57418480 ... no words.  Made my day\n. @redsandro I don't have to approve.  I am only here to critique, debase, and hassle people :) \n\nSeriously though - the best thing about open source projects, which this \"issue\" illustrates so well,  is that you had an idea, submitted a PR demonstrating a prototype on how you thought it should work, it was reviewed by people who care about the project, and someone else rose up to implement in a way that fits within the bigger picture.  Awesome work for an awesome feature.  \n. hmm, if sarcasm works....\nI am not going to thread :shit: or anything.\n\nthe feature I could _really_ use to help get my internal packages opensourced is-\na pkgsource id in chocolatey.config file or an environment variable that could then be used within chocolateyinstall.ps1 to replace a hardcoded url.\n\nRight now all my packages are hardcoded to an internal url, and ideally there would be a way to \nif pkgsourceid exists or env:$pkgsourceid exists then use that, otherwise fall back to url like Mozilla.org for firefox or whatever. \n\nSummary I want to be able to create packages that can be used universally, on the public - via mirrors or private feed. Embedding a url becomes problematic to maintain.  \n\nThen a param called pkgsource could be also used to override the default url.\n\nThis has nothing to do with the -source, source (but you know that already)\n. link?\n. example-\n\n```\nInstall-ChocolateyPackage -packageName \"$packageName\" `\n            -fileType 'msi' `\n            -url 'http://chocopackages.myorg.com/PuppetEnterprise/puppet-enterprise-2.6.1.msi' `\n            -silentArgs '/quiet'\n            #-url64bit '' `\n            #-validExitCodes\n```\n\nmyorg.com doesn't help you at all, and I don't want to put myorg url on the interwebs.\n. but I want to publish 100s of packages, for the world to consume, because chocolatey adoption would skyrocket, if people knew how to install/uninstall everything from Office to Exchange Server using just cinst. I just want to sanitize them.\n. we can certainly take this elsewhere.  there might even be an issue on this.\n. https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/269\n. The source code is always available.  Just rename nupkg to zip and extract the spec and ps1 files.\n. https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/210\n. what about write-output ? write-host = bad\n. we would still want customized parameters that can be created by the package owner, than could then be queried through a common syntax. perhaps listed through an xml tag in nuspec\n. Personally I use camelcase for id.  I like it to be poshy vs nixy. But I am ambivalant on setting a standard on that.\n. i think it should suggest a get-help or --help or some other usage information.  All the usage responses need obvious work.\n. I am a big fan of http://semver.org/\n. Passing it to the chocolatey gods for sacrifice... love it\n. not really relevant to .org but for my internal repo I git back all my packages and use https://github.com/rismoney/chocolatey-git\n\nI started making trivial tests for recognizing busted pkgs.\n. thanks... So here is how we manage the package repo internally.\n\nso we start with our git repo, setup very much like https://github.com/ferventcoder/chocolateyautomaticpackages\n\nthe difference being that each time we create or bump a version of the package we git tag it, and push to our internal gitrepo.  This allows for peer review.    The build.ps1 script is then able to iterate through every tag in the repo, and spit out the nupkg file into a dir.  We also run a bunch of validation scripts on the package as a form of package unit testing using pester.  We are getting to a point where the cpush can only be done by the bot running all this.  We don't want to let users upload to the repo anymore, and feel the git review process is ideal for vetting the package before upload.  \n\nNow the chocolatey.org site has different intentions, but perhaps a CI validation process can be instituted.  After all I don't think its practical to host every package in a single gitrepo, and gitsubmodules are nontrivial for the layman.\n. imho, its overreaching for cpack.  the receiver should have a triager (along the lines of a CI model)\n. funny you should say that.  i hacked something pretty crude through appveyor that runs the test suite i have.   it doesn't have the ability to spin up vms... :( and they don't have PR hooks, only single branch hooks).  I ended up ditching it.\n\nbut last I heard travis is getting windows support, so when that drops, we might have something pretty awesome.\nbtw-travis is awesome.\n. Thats so awesome @mwrock !! can i make a suggestion?  if you are going to provide other hypervisor/cloud functions, you might have the start of something like a powershell fog (see fog.io)\n\nyou might have, and I haven't looked at the source yet, but I envision these as external componentry you can just bolt on and re-use outside of box-starter.\n. Can you elaborate more on this @Redsandro -https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/342#issuecomment-31094523\n\n I don't understand not running windows, virtual Choco users, where boxstarter fits...\n. I thought chocolatey goodness was as good as it gets.\n. agree with you ferventcoder- that was my understanding.  \n\ni think its a metric s-ton of a parsing exercise that probably needs to start with TDD via pester, and make each use case pass... just looking at this readme https://github.com/isaacs/node-semver made my head hurt.\n. @ferventcoder - is this alright for me to do?  I rebased and branched https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/273 but preserved the authorship...\n. have you tried the carat ^ escape?\nthats a cmd escape char which might work.   havent tried yiur specific example though.\n. Interestingly - I was asked this question a few days ago.   The long/short of it is that the chocolatey project doesn't directly manage the nuget and/or it's spec.  What you are suggesting here, is a change in nuspec functionality not chocolatey.  \n\nRight now, you can build this logic in via powershell with wmi, but it has its own set of downsides starting with ambiguous connections of packages.\n. > Why is this a change to the nuspec functionality? \n\ndependencies are defined in nuspec.   however there is no conditional logic around it.  It is only package to package dependencies.   foo.1.0 requires bar.2.0 or greater type stuff.\n\n> I would envision Chocolatey installing two empty packages when you install it. \n\nthis seems very hackish, to get at OS versions.  This overcomes package to package dependencies with a fake OS package.  But it only addresses OS dependency.  What about other logical dependencies?  For those am I just left with powershell?\n\nIdeally, I would want some dependency capability to do stuff like:\n\n``` xml\n<chooser>\n  <when $os=6.1>\n    <dependency 1/>\n  </when>\n  <when $os=6.2>\n    <dependency 2/>\n  </when>\n <else>\n    <dependency 3/>\n  </else>\n</chooser>\n```\n\nright now this all needs to happen in chocolateyinstall via just another cinst within a conditonal\n. i think so. ;)\n. I thought I wrote another reply to this- but I guess I didn't click comment...\n\nAn idea on this topic is to make the nuspec dependency element a parseable item around things like os, features, architecture and then have run-nuget or it's caller like install-chocolateypackage use a set of dependency helpers to do the needful...\n\n``` xml\n<dependency id=\"|os|\" version=\"6.2\" />\n```\n\nand we use dependency helpers based on the between the pipes or other delimiter.\n. I was under the impression this functionality was being abandoned.  For ex:  http://support.microsoft.com/kb/834489\n. You suspect L11 in chocolatey cmd as its missing /b?\nExit /b if run inside script shouldn't Close windows...only exit script.  Not near a pc but I will check out asap\n. Ok I get it.   Had you tried cmd /c successfully or do we need something clever.   - i have a few ideas on messing with the call parameters to be passed properly but got to work through edge cases. /? Is being treated as a separate param to call...\n. Ok.  That's fair.  Put that in.  I will later refactor to avoid expensive cmd sub calls\n\nI saw a post on stackoverflow re call issue and ways to deal with params being treated as a single one.  The quotes may be forcing delimiting %\\* as a call param rather than a choco param.   There is no %~\\* so I think the more elegant (read yucky dos quirky crap) solution involves forcing the entire param string into the a single first call argument.\n\n Ie\nChocolatey /? needs to be treated as 1 arg instead of 2 from a call perspective.\n. i think this is the link i found yesterday. (BryceatNetwork) response...\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/9396311/run-a-input-parameter-as-command-in-dos-batch-script\n. Agree with @mwrock wholeheartedly.  \n. Choco version is deprecated...use list or search.\n\n-------- Original message --------\nFrom: codearoo notifications@github.com\nDate: 11/26/2013 6:25 PM (GMT-05:00)\nTo: chocolatey/chocolatey chocolatey@noreply.github.com\nSubject: [chocolatey] choco version command should not do anything other than report its current version. (#382)\n\nRunning 'choco version' or 'chocolatey version' should be quick to just output the version number. But instead it's checking online to see if it's the latest.\nI believe that instead of doing that, it can output something like:\n\nname : chocolatey\nfound : 0.9.8.23\nPlease run 'choco version-check' to check if an update is available.\n\nor something to that nature.\n\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/382.\n. not sure if it helps you guys, but to get an effective && if powershell you would need\n\nwhoami ; if($?) {whoami}\n. i added the original uninstall capability as a naive implementation that requires chocolateyuninstall.ps1.  many pkgs dont have that capability.  its very ymmv at this point but its going to get a lot better as indicated above so stay tuned\n. I say go ahead!  I added the -specificfolder switch before we went 7za so imho it's a regression.\n. iirc this is an intentional omission. the msi guid is typically needed for uninstall.  i have a way of automating that but have not looked at it in a bit.  last i heard was we were looking at choco msi tighter integration overall with windows installer\n. usage:\n\n  $packageName = 'PuppetEnterprise'\n  $fileType = 'MSI'\n  $uninstallGuid = '{89BA3D80-5EEF-40BC-A7F9-9E234BEB0D46}'\n\n  Uninstall-ChocolateyPackage \"$packageName\" \"$fileType\" \"$uninstallGuid /norestart /qn\"\n. see\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/99/files\n. the purpose of that commit functionality comes from a requirement to be integrated in a non interactive environment.  if the functions blindly exit state 0s without exception raising then any automation around chocolatey where failures occur, the errors will be swallowed.  the outer lying tool will think everything was honky dory, when in reality failures occured.\nits not thrilling to me, but i was seeing exit success when failures occured.  I am using puppet with chocolatey.\n. all for the hashtables btw :)\n. > disabled the mandatory exit because it interfered with the ability to continue installing subsequent packages if one package failed \n\nimho the mandatory exit is the right and default behavior.  i agree a switch show control -ignorefailures...  i am a big proponent of fail early and stop all things.\n\nright now for better or worse its being called from puppet via chocolatey.cmd.  that uses -command\n. agree with you 100%.  Inserting proper exception management is needed.   My short term goal was selfish, get the error out.  Improvement is def needed and i think choco has longer term plans to go c# which will probably help resiliency overall.\n. ok someone submit pr and make sure non exit 0 is bubbled all the way back out to cmd/posh on any failure.\n. so if there is a separate md5 file, do you grab that file, get content it into a var and append it like in your link?\n. This url switching is thus driven by a csv file I need to manually build after inspecting each package's chocolateyinstall.ps1 finding the url and mapping it to an alternate url?\n\nI suppose this is scriptable to generate a csv, but does this highlight a bigger issue with urls within packages?  It kills package portability.  Why wouldnt upstream adhere to using a url mapper too... packageid, url. \n\nBtw neat take on the approach!!\n\nI want to opensource my choco repo but do it in a way the pkgs could be used by someone w/o mods.\nThis is 1 approach.\n\nI was originally planning to make the hostname just an env var... but this wont help upstream internet based urls plus you could have foo.com/setup.exe and bar.com/setup.exe\n\n I am interested in ppls thoughts...\n. rebase on top of upstream/master?\n. succinctly, src/functions essentially should not be relied upon. whereas src/helpers/functions should be.\n. who pays the processing fee?\n. got it!\n. interesting, so if i can earn 5% rewards, and spend 2.9% to send a payment, plus 1% in fees, I can earn 1.1% profit, for every $500 I send to my own org ;)\n. Can you describe some of the design choices?  I would like to understand the intent. Any hidden aspects like http://lov5-77.diply.com/love-eat/30-famous-logos-that-have-a-hidden-message/51404\n. Ahh that's really interesting.  My thought was that it was a play on packaging.  I didn't realize it was chocolate :). I thought it was a box.  I really like it.  But would a transparent (no background) be the usage or would everything go yellowy?\n. I couldn't agree more with @ferventcoder comments.\n\nQ: Is the chocolate candy wrapper  too much.  In other words does it not go too faraway from a computer thing to a candy bar, leaving nothing behind?  I see why you showed us the squared off 1 first as I think I am warming up to the 1st one, but I think the \":\" colon is not needed.  choco will go well beyond windows\n. I was not against it.  I was inquiring.  I actually really like all the work you have done and have to express sincere kudos for your hard work and volunteering.  My hope for whatever logo that is chosen is that it represents choco to where its goodness becomes synomous with all the good people involved including you @juliankrispel.\n. Agree.\n\n```\nc:\\>ocalatey ftw! :)\n```\n. going to agree with @gep13  6 pops against the black background and the letters have a transparent magic quality.  I didn't notice this before, but I also love the near symmetry afforded by the C and the Y.\nIt certainly has a richness!\n. I would love to see one of these 2 go in as it has required me to fork for internal use.

I'm already updating my scripts to use 'choco install'\n. Maybe to avoid confusion with the \"all\" option which is for \"all packages\", the \"-all\" for \"all versions\" maybe should be called \"-all-versions\"\n. Well actually, to be consistent with  \"-version xxx\" option for like 'cinst myapp -version 1.123\" maybe it should be something like this.. and also noticing the uninstallation of a specific version does not work:\n\ncuninst myapp -version 1.123\ncuninst myqpp -version *\ncuninst myqpp -version all\ncuninst myqpp -version-all\n. I also wanted to post up a new feature to allow you to remove OLD VERSIONS of software. For example:\n\ncuninst all -version-old\n???\nso that it only leaves the LATEST versions of the packages.\n. I found another issue ticket mentioning that this works:\ncuninst myapp -version 1.123\n\nbut it does not.. unless it meant that it SHOULD work.\n\nAlso laughed at the old name 'cunst'  :)\n\nI still think it's easier to remove most of those aliases and just get users used to using 'choco'\n\nchoco install\nchoco uninstall\nchoco /?  then would work without the user typing:  cinst /?   and wondering why it's trying to install \"/?\" package.\n. are you sure Linux apt-get REMOVES old versions? I thought it only does\nthat when you run 'apt-get autoremove'\n\nI think it's useful to have old versions locally so you can revert back to\nthem and not rely on the remote source being online. However I would be\nfine with it removing by default when you install...  and maybe adding an\noption to not do that if the user does not want it.\n\ncinst myapp -leave-old\n\nor something like that.\nI did not request it that way because I actually thought how it was working\nnow is in line with 'apt-get'.\n. Regarding your multiple branch thing.. that is ALREADY the case, but maybe\nnot for all apps. Ruby however DOES DO THIS:\n\ncinst ruby  <-- latest stable release of ruby (hopefully) which is 2.0.xx\ncinst ruby1.9  <-- only install latest (again hopefully) of 1.9 branch\n\nSomeone recently added that 1.9 package.\n\nAnd in general I also agree that 'apt-get' is the syntax and form to strive\nto since it advertises as being the 'apt-get for Windows'   however doing\nthat now would mean breaking old habits so not sure how good that would be.\n But moving forward borrowing those ideas probably would only help.\n. I see... only one thing...  since Chocolatey had the goal in mind to JUST DO IT.. making it interactive would conflict with that.  Or at least... if you do, then also add some general -y  -quiet   option to force it to not interact. Fail in certain cases or something..  just provide a way for automated scripts to do whatever the job is.\n. ALSO...  sort of tied with this issue..  in that it eats up disk space a lot.. is this post I wrote about Nuget Cache:\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/chocolatey/nuget/chocolatey/pM0kIM6A3p8/U8fxJPiDsToJ\n.

The TeamCity server running Apache on Windows.\n. And BTW, we also have same results from 2 different versions of TeamCity on Windows 2008 and 2008R2\n. Also..  we've been using the WRONG case for over a year with TeamCity.. so it's not case sensitive.\nIt's only when we updated to Choco ...27 did we realize we have the wrong case on some of our packages.\n. Makes sense. Sounds like a likely culprit.

Well actually, to be consistent with  \"-version xxx\" option for like 'cinst myapp -version 1.123\" maybe it should be something like this.. and also noticing the uninstallation of a specific version does not work:\n\ncuninst myapp -version 1.123\ncuninst myqpp -version *\ncuninst myqpp -version all\ncuninst myqpp -version-all\n. I also wanted to post up a new feature to allow you to remove OLD VERSIONS of software. For example:\n\ncuninst all -version-old\n???\nso that it only leaves the LATEST versions of the packages.\n. I found another issue ticket mentioning that this works:\ncuninst myapp -version 1.123\n\nbut it does not.. unless it meant that it SHOULD work.\n\nAlso laughed at the old name 'cunst'  :)\n\nI still think it's easier to remove most of those aliases and just get users used to using 'choco'\n\nchoco install\nchoco uninstall\nchoco /?  then would work without the user typing:  cinst /?   and wondering why it's trying to install \"/?\" package.\n. are you sure Linux apt-get REMOVES old versions? I thought it only does\nthat when you run 'apt-get autoremove'\n\nI think it's useful to have old versions locally so you can revert back to\nthem and not rely on the remote source being online. However I would be\nfine with it removing by default when you install...  and maybe adding an\noption to not do that if the user does not want it.\n\ncinst myapp -leave-old\n\nor something like that.\nI did not request it that way because I actually thought how it was working\nnow is in line with 'apt-get'.\n. Regarding your multiple branch thing.. that is ALREADY the case, but maybe\nnot for all apps. Ruby however DOES DO THIS:\n\ncinst ruby  <-- latest stable release of ruby (hopefully) which is 2.0.xx\ncinst ruby1.9  <-- only install latest (again hopefully) of 1.9 branch\n\nSomeone recently added that 1.9 package.\n\nAnd in general I also agree that 'apt-get' is the syntax and form to strive\nto since it advertises as being the 'apt-get for Windows'   however doing\nthat now would mean breaking old habits so not sure how good that would be.\n But moving forward borrowing those ideas probably would only help.\n. I see... only one thing...  since Chocolatey had the goal in mind to JUST DO IT.. making it interactive would conflict with that.  Or at least... if you do, then also add some general -y  -quiet   option to force it to not interact. Fail in certain cases or something..  just provide a way for automated scripts to do whatever the job is.\n. ALSO...  sort of tied with this issue..  in that it eats up disk space a lot.. is this post I wrote about Nuget Cache:\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/chocolatey/nuget/chocolatey/pM0kIM6A3p8/U8fxJPiDsToJ\n.

I need to depend on the virtual package, but how does the virtual know what packages satisfy the virtual package requirement? \n\nFrom what you are saying, it sounds like debian uses some metadata about packages to know whether they are say a \"PDFReader\" or not.  That could get pretty server intensive as chocolatey doesn't keep a local list of packages (which also means it doesn't give a nice \"Did you mean 'apt-get curl'?\" message either.\n\nPerhaps one could depend on a tag, but that's not reliable on the nuget framework.  The current method of implementation I've thought of isn't perfect (doesn't automatically have new packages that meet the virtual requirement), but it's a start... :)\n\n\"We never usually go the right direction in the start, only discover it after we've made progress.\"\n\nAlthough if you have ideas on how to make it easier to register an application as satisfying a virtual requirement, I'm definitely open to it.\n\n---\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/7#issuecomment-7257422\n.

Seems like something we could include, but we would need some tests around it.\n. Hey,\n\nI am reasonably new to git, and am certainly no master when it comes to best practices, and although I follow most of what is suggested above, I would LOVE to see this written up into a wiki article that explained the why's and why not's, so that people getting started out can know the process to follow, which then makes the process of pulling in changes that much easier.\n\nFor instance, in all the updates lately I have been reading a lot about the desire to keep the commit history clean, and the need for doing rebases etc.  Now I \"get\" most of this, but I think it would be good if someone (i.e. someone who knows exactly what they are talking about) could describe what this means in the context of the Chocolatey project.  I understand that this could potentially be a lot of work, but I also think that it could save a lot of work when pulling in all the PR's.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nGary\n. That is great news!\n. @ferventcoder off the top of my head, I am not sure.  I will have a look.\n. For what it is worth, I agree with Matt as well.  Contributing to this project was the first time I had ever used Pester, and I can honestly say that it was very simple to get up to speed with, and there are plenty of existing tests in the code base to use as a basis for new tests, so there really is no good reason , IMO, to not include additional unit tests.\n\nGary\n.

Hey,\n\nMore than happy to do what ever is required, but can I ask for a bit of hand holding for this, still relatively new to git, and don't want to do anything wrong :-)\n\nAre you simply looking for me to rebase so that there is a single commit for the PR?  If so, could you walk me through the steps?\n\nThanks, much appreciated!

Due to me deleting the original branch that this PR was created on, the link has been broken.  Even though I created a new branch, with the same name, it didn't \"automagically\" work, which I didn't think that it would.  However, this has been address here:\n\ne8c017ae54c5f2d37f7bdc908bb2e4cab77082d1\n. This is actually a problem with the MySql package, not with chocolatey.  As such, you should really contact the package owners, which you can do from the contact owners link here:\n\nhttp://chocolatey.org/packages/mysql\n\nThis particular issue, I believe, is due to a dependency on the C++ Redistributable.  If you try running the mysql installer directly, it tells you about this.\n\nThe required dependency is actually another chocolatey package, which you can go ahead an install.\n\nGary\n. Hello,\n\nAs per your other issue, your best bet would be to contact the package owner directly, which you can do from this link:\n\nhttp://chocolatey.org/packages/redis\n\nGary\n. Should we add a task, somewhere, to get the documentation updated to reflect this change, or where do things like that get logged so they are not forgotten?\n. Any word on when a new release of choco is going to be pushed out, to include changes like this?\n\nThanks\n\nGary\n. Cool, happy to beta test if you need people to give it a try.\n\nYeah, never tried installing a \"hooky\" version of chocolatey yet, always installed the proper version.  There is nothing immediately pressing.  I know Matt has made a couple of changes that are interesting, but happy to wait, was just curious :-)\n. rismoney, sorry, that wasn't in anyway a slight at you, or anyone, sorry if it came across like that!  All I meant was, if I install something like chocolatey on my own machine, I want to install the fully released version, not a pre-release version, therefore I wouldn't install the source code version.  As a result, I am willing to wait for the new features for my main machines, but can fire up a VM for testing purposes.  The term \"hooky\" probably wasn't the best in this case.  Apologies.\n\nmwrock, that would be great.  We are using MyGet for the ChocolateyGUI and it does a great job!\n. Ah, gotcha.  :-)\n\nI have only touched the surface of Pester, mainly due to Matt's blog posts, but it really is very clever!\n. Is that a new repo?  This link doesn't seem to work for me :-(\n. Just in case you didn't see the other part of the conversation Paul, the Puppet Chocolatey module may not fully work properly (i.e. for validating installed version of a choco package) until the other pull request for completing exit codes is pulled into master and a new version of Chocolatey is released.\n. oh yeah, I know, I have been following, just wanted to let Paul know, who I think is going to be using the Puppet Module in anger, that he may see some issues, until the next release is pushed out. :-)\n. To try to help out, I have added a pull request to try to cover this issue.  Not sure if it covers everything that would be required, but it does add a Unit Test to cover this scenario.  Would be interested to hear thoughts on what I have suggested.  Thanks!\n. Going to go ahead an close this issue.  I will do another pull request with correct line feeds, etc.\n. Woot ;-)\n. Woo hoo!  What is the \"done\" thing now?  Should I delete the branch on my fork?  Or should I leave it.\n\nThanks\n\nGary\n. Okay dokay :-)\n. Just putting in my 2p worth,...\n\nIs it worth supporting Server Core?  There is only going to be a small subset of chocolatey packages that are going to work on Core, with a high number of them simply not going to install at all.  How would we make it such that this was clear across all packages, so the inevitable \"It doesn't work\" issues don't crop up.\n\nGary\n. Yip, this makes sense, just wanted to make sure that we weren't going down a route that didn't make any sense.\n\nYeah, it's SharpZipLIb that is the \"standard\" library that is used in-house.\n. Sure, I can take a look at this one.  I am away this weekend, but I can take a look at it after that :-)\n. Hey,\n\nJust a thought, if this is going to go ahead, I would suggest that the documentation at the top of the Install-ChocolateyInstallPackage.ps1 file should be updated to make it clear that it is not just msi and exe, but also for an msu.\n\nThoughts?\n\nGary\n. I think that this would definitely make sense to be included in the wiki, \"somewhere\".  I have on my todo list to do a complete write up of \"How to contribute to the Chocolatey Project\", i.e. fork the source code, create a branch, do your work, run the Pester Tests, Write new Pester Tests, commit code, do pull request etc, but again, never seem to get the cycles to do it.\n. Is there not already a chocolatey puppet module?  I have it on my todo list to have a look at it, as I am just getting into puppet, but I had assumed that this would already be taken care of there.\n\nGary\n. Ah, I see.  I am still working with straight up package, file, and services in my puppet manifests just now, but I will be looking to extend into using Chocolatey as well.  Look forward to giving it a try.\n. @zippy1981 are you in a position to clean up this PR by rebasing on the current master?  If not, I can submit a new PR with similar functionality?

For EXE's, I use this helper command as per here:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-coreteampackages/blob/master/feeddemon/tools/chocolateyUninstall.ps1\n\nFor MSI's, I typically do something like his:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-coreteampackages/blob/master/calibre/tools/chocolateyUninstall.ps1\n\nGary\n. @ferventcoder This is a known issue, that I need to figure out.  Some testing required here.\n. I really think that this is a good idea!  The only concern that I would have would be keeping what is in the \"help\" in source, in sync with the \"help\" on the wiki.  I mentioned this to @mwrock in a previous commit that I saw him doing where he had to manually update a synopsis on the wiki to match a change to the synopsis in the code.  Is there any way to have \"one source of truth\", i.e. that we store the help documentation and synopsis information in one place, e.g. in the source code repo, and then flow this through into the wiki.  That way you update once, and it is correct in both places?\n\nJust a thought...\n. Hmm, that isn't bad actually, and not unlike other systems, for instance, PowerShell itself with it's Update-Help option.  Would it make sense to use the wiki as the \"one source of truth\" and then have Chocolatey download and cache the help files locally?\n\nThoughts?\n. @rismoney The more I think about this, the more I like it.  Will add it to my ever growing list of things to look into :-)\n. As an experiment, i think it would be good to know that we can load a file from file system and render as help text when requested. I don't see why we couldn't do this though.\n\nBut yes, i think for now, that is the plan.\n\nGary\n\nSent from my Windows Phone\n\n---\n\nFrom: corkupinemailto:notifications@github.com\nSent: \u200e07/\u200e05/\u200e2013 02:07\nTo: chocolatey/chocolateymailto:chocolatey@noreply.github.com\nCc: Gary Ewan Parkmailto:gep13@gep13.co.uk\nSubject: Re: [chocolatey] WIP - help refactor (#288)\n\nSo what do you think I keep going in the same direction for now?

What about something like:\n\nHelp-&lt;Function Name&gt;.txt\n\ni.e.\n\nHelp-Chocolatey-Install.txt\n. Ah, I see what you are getting at. My bad!\n. Hello,\n\nI have just checked the Chocolatey Source Code, and the Stop-OnAppIsInstalled is not part of the code case, so this must be a method that the package owner expects to already be available in the system.\n\nI think the best course of action would be for you to contact the package owner directly:\n\nYou can do that by clicking the Contact Owners link here:\n\nhttp://chocolatey.org/packages/Devbox-ConEmu\n\nHope that helps!\n\nGary\n. When you said:\n\n\"I'm creating a package that runs a service\"\n\nI take it you mean a windows service?  If so, how are you creating the service in the first place?  Are you using something like WiX?  If so, you can put the responsibility for stoppping/starting this service into the hands of the installation package, i.e. the MSI, and not worry about this within the chocolatey package.\n\nGary\n. Rob, what are your thoughts on this?  Does it make sense to add this functionality into another helper method, such as InstallChocolateyPowerShellPath?  There is an existing helper method for a generic environment variable: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/HelpersInstallChocolateyEnvironmentVariable but if it makes sense to split out the PowerShell Module Path, happy to take a stab at implementing this.\n. What version of PowerShell are you running?  And have you installed the Web PI Commandline? (cinst webpicommandline).\n\nThe reason that I ask is that this worked for me:\n\n![clist_webpi](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1271146/571096/f237583e-c76b-11e2-9ae2-b063570c4fef.png)\n. Looks like there is an issue though, in that this should be handled more gracefully, and not just disappear, but if we can trace the problem, we can work on a solution :-)\n. Ah, my test was on a Windows 7 machine :-)  Will do a test on a Windows 8 machine as well.\n. Hmmm...\n\nJust tried again on my Windows 8 machine, and I get the same results as in the above screenshot.\n\nWhat happens if you try running the following:\n\n```\ncmd.exe /c webpicmd /List /ListOption:All\n```\n\nThis is what Chocolatey is doing under the hood for you.\n\nGary\n. Doh! That is the flag I was looking for! I was trying with -verbose, and that wasn't doing anything :-)\n. Ah, that makes sense :-)\n\nI have a potential fix, namely:\n\n```\n  if ($source -like 'webpi') {\n$chocoInstallLog = Join-Path $nugetChocolateyPath 'chocolateyWebPiInstall.log';\nRemove-LastInstallLog $chocoInstallLog\n$webpiArgs =\"/c webpicmd /List /ListOption:All | Tee-Object -FilePath `'$chocoInstallLog`';\"\nStart-ChocolateyProcessAsAdmin \"cmd.exe $webpiArgs\" -nosleep\nCreate-InstallLogIfNotExists $chocoInstallLog\n$installOutput = Get-Content $chocoInstallLog -Encoding Ascii\nforeach ($line in $installOutput) {\n  Write-Host $line\n}\n```\n\nWhich does the same thing as the Windows Feature equivalent, but it makes the command VERY slow to execute.  Should I go ahead and make a PR to add this in?  Or wait for another solution?\n\nGary\n. Just tried the latest webpi cli and looks like it requires admin privileges as well :-(\n. When you mention hosting packages elsewhere, when they are not intended for everyone, is it worth mentioning somewhere like MyGet.org? i.e. The package can still be on a public feed, but not polluting the Chocolatey.org feed?\n\nGary\n. @Redsandro You are right, my command is directed here:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/355\n\nSorry :)\n. An out there suggestion, but...\n\nCan we create a choco package that configuring this as a default in the common editors? Assuming that these settings are exposed somewhere, it should be trivial to check whether an editor is installed, and make the update.\n\nJob done!\n. Agreed, if we could wrap this up in cpack to the point that this was a non-issue, that would be best for everyone.  Would the act of cpack result in changes to the physical file?  i.e. if someone is using source control, (and obviously they shoudl be) would they be left with the \"correct encoding on the file?  If so, should cpack throw a message back to indicate what was done, adn why?\n. Would it be worth creating another command that could be used ahead of cpack?  A dedicated function for doing just this?\n\nThe only problem with this is that it would be down to the user to run the command, and to know to run the command, which takes us back to the same problem.\n\nThe only other suggestion would be to add an \u201cautomatic moderation\u201d step, post upload to the chocolatey servers.  Almost synonymous with a compilation, where we do all the necessary work, in this case the encoding, before setting the package live.\n. From the link posted above:\n\n> If you don\u2019t respect this rule, some characters are not displayed correctly in the Gallery on Chocolatey.org, because the Gallery assumes UTF-8.\n. Perhaps the wiki needs to be refined, but my understanding is that the problem is exactly as stated in the latter part of the quote.  If you don't do what is described here, then characters are rendered incorrectly when pushed to the Chocolatey Gallery.  @TomOne will be able to provide more information on this, as my understanding on this issue is slim, at best.\n. This is great news if it is fixed, as it will ease some of the stricter requirements.  Would be great to get @TomOne who originally raised the issue to confirm that everything is now working as expected.\n. I \"think\" this might be an issue with the package itself, no? Where a call to Write-Success is called twice. Nit at my computer just now, but will try to check the chocolatey package for this application later today to confirm.\n. Doesn't look like this is a package problem.  The choco package has the following:\n\n```\ntry { \n  Install-ChocolateyPackage 'markpad' 'msi' '/quiet /norestart' 'https://github.com/downloads/Code52/DownmarkerWPF/MarkPad.v0.9.0.1.msi'\n\n  Write-ChocolateySuccess 'markpad'\n} catch {\n  Write-ChocolateyFailure 'markpad' \"$($_.Exception.Message)\"\n  throw \n}\n```\n\nGary\n.

Perhaps it ended up in junk folder.  Thanks for getting the package updated though, much appreciated!\n. At present, almost all packages are maintained by the community. There are just too many packages for this to be done by Chocolatey itself, we need the help of the community. However, as is always the case, life sometimes gets in the way, and packages become outdated. At this point, you have done the right thing by trying to reach out to the original author.  If this doesn't work, then the best idea would be to take the current package source code (if available) fork it, make the updates, and then push to Chocolatey. In order for this to happen, you would need to be made a co-owner of the package, which can be done. This is much preferable than creating a duplicate package.\n\nGary\n\nSent from my Windows Phone\n\n---\n\nFrom: Roger Qiumailto:notifications@github.com\nSent: \u200e29/\u200e06/\u200e2013 09:30\nTo: chocolatey/chocolateymailto:chocolatey@noreply.github.com\nSubject: [chocolatey] Updating old packages that are not maintained on Chocolatey (#308)\n\nHow do I go about updating a package that isn't maintained by the author in Chocolatey. For example, papercut is the 2010 version on Chocolatey (which I installed), but I want the 2013 version that is available directly. Do I have to create my own package? There should be an easier process to keep up to date.\n\n---\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/308\n. Rich,\n\nI guess what I was referring to there was the github repo for the package.  It would be easier to fork this code and create a pull request, rather than to re-invent the wheel and extract the files yourself to put them somewhere else.\n\nGary\n. Good catch :)\n\nI have updated the wiki article with the additional quotes.  Can you check and verify, and it you are happy with it, we can close off this issue.\n\nThanks\n\nGary\n. Yip, I think so.\n. I guess I am on the fence with this one.\n\nI see the benefit in using Chocolatey to install Node and NPM, but once installed, why would I use `choco install gulp-imagemin -source npm`, when I could just as easily do `npm install gulp-imagemin`.  Now, don't get me wrong, the same could be said about installing ruby gems, but I think I am on the fence about this as well.\n\nOther things like webpi, windowsfeatures, vsix, etc, make perfect sense to me.  This, not so much.  Happy to be persuaded otherwise though.\n. With regard to the personal packages, I would like to see these moved off the main chocolatey feed onto a Community Chocolatey Feed on MyGet.Org, or encourage people to create their own MyGet feeds to store the packages.\n. Does the Chocolatey Gallery, which comes from the Nuget Gallery, provide a lot of moderation capabilities?  Or is this something that will have to be built in?\n. This is very cool! :-)\n. I really think that we can start to use this as a starter for ten.  If nothing else, I think I am going to try to lever this for the packages that I maintain, and also at work (assuming you don't mind that is :-))\n. Would this be a case of executing some checks during the cpack command, and then have it fail if something goes wrong, or would this be done on the Chocolatey.org server once the package has been uploaded to the server? Or both?\n. The validation is the tricky part though.  For instance, in a recent package there was a sneaky addition of an Google and Google Tooblar:\n\nhttp://chocolatey.org/packages/avastfreeantivirus\n\nWhatever system we create needs to handle, somehow, the checking of unwanted uninstallations.  I was discussing this with Rob earlier this week.  This could be done, if possible, by taking a snapshot of the registry before and after the install (say with regshot) and also doing a diff of the file system (a harder thing to achieve) and checking for things that shouldn't be there.  If anything else does appear, this would flag the package as rogue, and need further manual validation.\n\nGary\n. side note... @mwrock wrt to that script block, which looks amazing, do those names assume that a Hyper-V VM exists with that name?  If it is not there, what does it do? I think you mentioned before that the VM would be created, but how does it know which iso to use when creating it?\n. Also, I love the idea of BoxStarter being used to validate Chocolatey Packages!  :-)  Talk about dog fooding!  If the Azure support lands, would it be within the realm of legality to use an MSDN Subscription for spinning up VM's, even as a Proof of Concept?  Happy to put my MSDN Sub to use for this if it is allowed.  The credits aren't being used for anything else just now.\n. Sweet, sounds like you have it all wrapped up! Is this your sole project just now, features seem to be coming thick and fast :-)\n. Ah, I see, that makes a bit more sense.  Based on what you had been pushing, I figured you hadn't slept in the last month! :-) Nightware, hopefully you can get it sorted out soon.  Look forward to checking it out!\n. I was having the same thought. I wondered whether the choco update package could be extended to include a flag to run the package through Boxstarter, and have it report back on success or failure.

The example that made this \"click\" for me, in terms of \"virtual packages\" is PDF's.  Lets say you are creating a package that has a dependency on being able to read PDF Documents.  You could point this at a virtual package called PDF Reader, and this in turn would point at something like Adode Reader, Sunatra Reader (either the install, or portable), Foxit Reader, or any other package that can read PDF's.  As long as one of these things is installed, then the dependency for your package has been met, and installation can continue.\n. Hey,\n\nFor development purposes, there is a PowerShell script which allows you to side load a compiled application, but I don't think that the would work for app directly from the store.\n\nIn the Windows Phone eco system, there is an application that you can install that will run off and install all applications that you used to have on your phone. This is really useful for installing all apps when you get a new phone.

For instance [Netflix](http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/d8d75bb2-c5cd-44f2-8c26-c1d1ae5b13fa), to name a popular one.\n\nIs it at all possible to install apps from the Windows Store using power script? If so, maybe this should be a template or Chocolatey function.\n\nI have no clue at all how this works under the hood, but you need to be logged in with your Windows Live ID to be able to install apps. So the script would probably need to check if you are logged in.\n\nBut, this is of course total bull*, MS just wants to keep track of things. Apps can run perfectly fine without knowing who is running it. So it would be totally super awesome sweet if we could actually install apps for users without a Live ID.\n\n---\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/356\n.

Can you link to a specific example?\n\n@redsandro all valid points :-)\n. What is being described here sounds to me like a Chocolatey.Contrib project, which is where the helper module would like.  This could then be a standalone package that people can take a dependency on.\n\nThoughts?\n. I am going to say .Net 4.0:\n\n![image](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1271146/1604505/c97b9e56-53bf-11e3-9e13-6e1021f7baeb.png)\n. Hmmm, I for one actually like the search box having focus by default.\n. Hello,\n\nThanks for reporting this.  This actually sounds like an issue with chocolatey.org, rather than with Chocolatey.\n\nCan I get you to raise this issue here:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org/issues/new\n\nThanks\n\nGary\n. @Haacked can you add anything to what might have been going on here? Cheers!\n. @ferventcoder this week has been mental, so not had any time to look into this at all yet.  Hoping to get some time at the weekend to take care of this though.  Sorry!\n. Hello,\n\nBy executing the following:\n\n```\nchoco\n```\n\nYou will get an output similar to the following:\n\n```\nPlease run chocolatey /? or chocolatey help - chocolatey v0.9.8.23\n```\n\nFrom which you can get the current installed version of Chocolatey.\n\nHope that helps!\n\nGary\n. Yeah, I saw this:\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/chocolatey/3RJ-9pCGXyA\n\nAfter I read this enhancement request.  I guess I work in a different order :-)\n. What version of Chocolatey are you using?  Is Chocolatey already installed on the machine when you run the build on the TeamCity Build Agent, or are you installing it as part of the build?\n. On the Build Agent, open PowerShell and type\n\n```\nchoco\n```\n\nThis will output the current version number.\n\nSo, to confirm, although you have chocolatey installed on the Build Agent, you are running the Chocolatey installation script again as part of the TeamCity build, is that correct?\n\nIf so, then I think this is the issue.  There is a known issue in 0.9.8.23 where after installing, you have to close and re-open the PowerShell window before running a cinst, otherwise, you get the issue you are seeing.  Can you try taking out the Chocolatey install script just now?\n\nThis issue is fixed, and will be included in the next release.\n. Glad to hear that you got it working! :+1: \n. I suspect that this pull request got closed because you wrote \"Fixes #421\" in the commit message.  Due to the fact that when you fork a repo references to the issues remain pointing at the parent repo, it had the effect of closing the PR (and you were allowed to do this since you opened it in the first place).\n. @Redsandro it has happened to me on another repo, and I tried to dig up the example, but I think it has gone away, since they \"broke\" the connection with the upstream fork, thus creating their own set of issues.\n. If you can make these packages into auto packages, there is nothing to stop you adding them into here:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-coreteampackages\n\nAnd then the Community Server that I have running in the cloud will automagically check for new versions every hour, and cpack and cpush onto Chocolatey.org.\n\nThe more packages that we have out in this repo, the better, imo :-)\n. @Redsandro I \"think\", and Rob can correct me if I am wrong, but the CoreTeamPackages folder has changed in meaning slightly.  Originally, I believe it was only for packages that would be maintained by the core Chocolatey Team Members, and they could be packages that would have a quick SLA, in terms of getting packages out into the wild.  Now, at least as far as I am concerned, it is really aimed at a core repository for Chocolatey Packages, that are updated frequently (using the server that I have provided) and which will all, eventually, go through an automatic triage process to ensure for validity before being pushed to chocolatey.org.  Personally, I would like to see all the auto packages that are already out there, from core team members, and elsewhere, being combined into this one single repository.  I don't see this becoming a heap, but rather a maintained central repository, which is then much easier to triage with automatic processes that we can put in place.\n\nI know what you mean about the auto package process, it took me a while to get my head around it.  If you want to get onto the server in the cloud to take a look at what I am doing, just give me a shout.\n. @Redsandro yeah, I think I have read that thread before.  Hoping that this still isn't the case, as some of the packages I have pushed into there are certainly not critical :-)\n. Anyone can create and push auto packages, there is no implicit need for the chocolatey user to be involved.  However, any packages that make it into the coreteam repo would need to have the chocolatey user as a co-maintainer.\n\nRight now for the setup I have, I have it set up that both me and the chocolatey user can push each package.  However, on the server that I am using, keratin is essentially running under the chocolatey user, so when it automatically finds a new installation package on the interwebs, it pushes as the chocolatey user.  \n\nSo no, don't add me, add the chocolatey user.\n. That's the one.  From the main https://chocolatey.org/ page, the forum link takes you to the Google Group.\n\nWe should perhaps update the Contributing.md if this is not clear in there.\n. Done:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/424\n. Random question, but what is the GH prefix on the issue number?  And how is it still linking through to the actual issue?\n. Cool thanks, I didn't know about that :-)\n. I really like this addition! Is this something you are planning on adding to the auto choco updating tool as well?\n\nSent from my Windows Phone\n\n---\n\nFrom: Rob Reynoldsmailto:notifications@github.com\nSent: \u200e01/\u200e03/\u200e2014 14:25\nTo: chocolatey/chocolateymailto:chocolatey@noreply.github.com\nSubject: Re: [chocolatey] [Enhancement] CheckSum downloaded files (#427)\n\nNow this is good.\n\n---\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/427#issuecomment-36425893\n. @ferventcoder I am just spitballing here, but does the implementation of this feature give us the \"complete offline install\"?  Assuming you have already run all the installations once on one machine, and you can transport the cache folder to another machine, you would then be in a position to run all the installs again on that other machine without the need to go off to the internet, right?  Or was this part of your cunning plan all along? :-)\n. This has been implemented here:\n7d40f57a00462f6053618dd5ec6dd1d7cd5f7c22\n. While I like the idea of re-directing to a different URL when required, I am wondering what the exact use case is for this.  Does the recent work that @ferventcoder did to first check the download cache to see if a file is already downloaded, before accessing the URL in the nuspec file cover a lot of the use cases?  How I was planning on using it was the following...\n\nOn one machine that has access to the interwebs, install all the packages that you need.  Mirror the Chocolatey Packages that you want to somewhere internal, i.e. ProGet, or a file source.  Deploy the Cache folder from the interwebs facing machine onto all other machines.  Perform all installs on other machines using -source parameter, and you have a full offline install.\n\nGranted, there is a bit of work up front to make this happen, but once you do it once, it's done.\n\nWhat is the use case of the URL re-direct?  Is it required now that Chocolatey first checks whether the required file has already been downloaded?\n. @jberezanski agree, returning a PSObject, which can be inspected (and easily extended if required) definitely makes a lot of sense.\n. For what it is worth, I would say just go for it.  Don't think @ferventcoder will have a problem with it.\n\nThanks for digging into this!\n. @Haacked has something changed on Github's side that would cause this problem to happen?\n. @Haacked  Ah, could be.  If nothing else, we have exposed a problem that @mwrock has been able to work around.  Thanks for getting back to me.  I will subscribe to the blog for future updates.\n. Hello,\n\nThis sounds like a known issue.  Have you just installed Chocolatey? If so, can you try closing and re-opening the Powershell window and try again?\n\nGary\n. @ferventcoder I don't have an issue with this.  Thoughts?\n. @nemchik There is a Chocolatey Helper method that should help you in persisting the change to the environment variable:\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/HelpersInstallChocolateyEnvironmentVariable\n\nOr, if you want to do it yourself, you can find an example here:\n\nhttps://github.com/gep13/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/gep13.ChocolateyDev/tools/ChocolateyInstall.ps1#L42\n. @jamesgecko You don't \"have\" to change the Environment Variables through the command line, you can use standard Windows functionality to change the environment variables.  I do agree though that we need to put up a page, somewhere, to make it clear all the steps that should be executed.\n. Sweet! I will take a read of it, and make some updates if required.  Thanks for doing this, it is much appreciated! :+1:\n. @Redsandro I believe I am right in saying that this was an attempt to provide \"one source of truth\" for the documentation for the wiki.  Currently, we document a helper method in two places.  In the ps1 file and also in markdown in the wiki.  This is currently done as a manual task, and subject to human error, and becoming out of date.\n\nThis PR was an attempt to generate the markdown for the wiki directly from the help documentation in the ps1 files, so at the very least, they were the same, and we only have to update it in one place, i.e. the ps1 files, and then simply update the wiki articles with this helper.\n. @NJ-Brad Glad to hear that you got this sorted out, and thanks for coming back and closing out the issue.  \n\nHappy choco'ing :-)\n\nGary\n. @rappazzo you can find a link to contact the maintainers of this package on this page here:\n\nhttp://chocolatey.org/packages/eclipse-standard-kepler\n\nHopefully you will hear something back from them, but if you don't can you please follow the package triage process outlined here:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/PackageTriageProcess\n\nTo try to get the problem resolved.\n\nThanks\n\nGary\n. The suggestion here is really a feature request, to include a generic helper method for wrapping calls to 7zip, which is capable of handling multiple file types, not just .zip.\n. I was looking for a label to assign to the issue, i.e. Feature, but I didn't see one.  Never thought to update the title.  Will remember for next time :+1: \n. @030 Not all the functions in Chocolatey have Unit Tests, and it looks like this could be one of the areas that it hasn't been included.  If you can, we would more than happily accept some unit tests for this function.\n. @ferventcoder based on the change of usage of the function, do we need to think about changing the name of the function, or at least creating an alias for it?  Install-ChocolateyZipPackage, by it's name, suggests it will only work with Zip files.  Would a name like Install-ChocolateyCompressedPackage make more sense?\n. Yeah, that works too.\n. @jberezanski oops! My bad! :-)  Good catch!\n. Hey,\n\nIn order to get code added to the codebase, you would need to submit a pull request.\n\nHave a look here:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n\nFor the process, and let us know if you have any questions.\n\nGary\n. Hey,\n\nNo probs.  The mailing list is hosted in a Google Group which you can find here:\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/chocolatey\n\nGary\n. Hey,\n\nSince this is your first post to the forum, it was sitting in the moderation queue.  I have just approved it, so you should see it now.\n\nGary\n. Hello,\n\nHave you read through this:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n\nThis is the process that we follow for accepting contributions to Chocolatey.  You would need to make the changes, and then submit the changes in the form of a Pull Request.\n\nGary\n. Looks like you are using version 2.0.1 of Pester.  As per the setup script here:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/setup.ps1\n\nAnd also the discussion here:\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/chocolatey/9oQwi0-z3K0/discussion\n\nChocolatey needs version 2.0.2 of Pester.\n\nCan you try installing this version, and let us know how you get on?\n. Linqpad actually comes in two versions.  The original version \"choco install linqpad\" which installs a version that targets .Net Framework 3.5, and another one \"choco install linqpad4\" which targets .Net Framework 4.0/4.5.  As a result, they are two separate packages, and there isn't an \"upgrade\" path.\n. In this case, triaging is referring to checking the pull request, for suitability, problems, additional suggestions, etc.  This is the first pass at getting the pull request pulled into the main code base of Chocolatey.  This is a good thing :-)\n\nYou will hear from Rob if there are any changes that need to be made.\n. @vbsql7 can you confirm what version of Chocolatey you are using?  I have just done the following, using `0.9.8.28`\n- Download the nupkg package from https://bitbucket.org/jonforums/uru/downloads/uru.0.7.7.nupkg\n- Saved it to `c:\\temp`\n- Executed the following command `choco install uru -source c:\\temp`\n- Installation succeeded successfully\n- I can see a new uru.bat and uru.ps1 file created in the chocolatey bin folder\n. > This could be the issue of just installing chocolatey and not having that\n> variable set\n\nAgreed, I had assumed that based on the title of this bug that closing and re-opening the shell after a fresh install of Chocolatey had been ruled out by @vbsql7.  I had thought it might be an error in the package itself, but after attempting the install on a clean VM myself, that didn't seem to be the case.\n. Glad to hear you got it working! :smile_cat: \n. Hello,\n\nWhen you installed Chocolatey 0.9.8.25, did you already have a Chocolatey version installed?  Or was this a fresh install?\n\nDoes this path:\n\n```\nC:\\ProgramData\\chocolatey\n```\n\nExist on your file system?\n\nGary\n. Hey,\n\nNope, no breaking of issue etiquette, we are not fussy :-)  Happy to hear from you, and to know that you are using Chocolatey.  The only thing that I would say is that this is really an issue with Chocolatey.org, and as such, in future, if there are any other issues they can be posted here:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org\n\nGetting back to this particular problem though....\n\nAm I right in saying that you were typing out the installation command, while following along reading from the website?  If so, I can see how that would be a problem, given the formatting of the page.  What I would say though is that I don't think the intention is that people will manually type out the command, but rather, use the mechanisms on the page itself.  i.e. there are links that you can click which will put either command into your clipboard, which you can then immediately paste into either a command prompt or a PowerShell window.  The visual representation is really just there to show how easy it is to get Chocolatey installed.\n\nDoes that make sense, or did I miss the problem?\n\nGary\n. Yeah, that throws a few people.  You should be able to right click and choose paste. Or use the menu at top left of command prompt window.\n\nGary\n\n---\n\nFrom: Ted Sandersmailto:notifications@github.com\nSent: \u200e25/\u200e07/\u200e2014 18:13\nTo: chocolatey/chocolateymailto:chocolatey@noreply.github.com\nCc: Gary Ewan Parkmailto:gep13@gep13.co.uk\nSubject: Re: [chocolatey] Tip for improving front page installation directions (#527)\n\nThanks for the replies! If I'm not mistaken, in standard Windows command prompt, Ctrl+V does not paste.

There is also the ability to create a generic shortcut using this helper method:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/helpers/functions/Install-ChocolateyShortcut.ps1\n\nGary\n. @030 although the helper has been pulled into the master branch, it hasn't yet made it into the Stable branch, therefore it hasn't made it into a released version of Chocolatey.  The original pull request is labelled as 0.9.9, so we would need to check with @ferventcoder about when that is going to be released.\n\nNo, this helper does not take an array of inputs, but rather, works on creating a single shortcut for a given exe.  That is not to say that it couldn't do this, but as it stands right now, it doesn't.\n. Are you running the command prompt or PowerShell window with Administrator rights?\n. I am confused.  Why would Chocolatey need it's own Proxy Settings?  It simply uses the Proxy configuration for the system that it is running on.\n. I think @mwrock did some signing of the Boxstarter Scripts.  Perhaps he can point in right direction.\n. Ah, that was it! I knew there was something :-)\n. Hello,\n\nAs noted in the package description here:\n\nhttp://chocolatey.org/packages/nodejs\n\n`choco install nodejs``\n\nDoesn't include npm.  To do this, you will need to use:\n\n`choco install nodejs.install`\n\nwhich you can find here:\n\nhttp://chocolatey.org/packages/nodejs.install\n\nIf you have any problems after this, we can re-open the issue.\n. Ah, gotcha.\n\nSince `choco install nodejs` is just an alias to nodejs.commandline, it could be made to install npm by default.  We would need to confirm with @ferventcoder, the maintainer of the package, to see what his thoughts on this are.\n. :+1: \n. Looks like for Pester, you have to tell it where the test results end up:\n\nhttp://www.appveyor.com/docs/running-tests\n\nFor other systems it discovers them automatically.\n. In the current version of Chocolatey, no, it keeps all the old versions of the applications around.  For some applications, like Ruby, this is exactly what you want, for other, like Atom, not so much.  There are plans to change this, but for now, it is a case of manually removing the package folders for the older version of the package that you don't want.\n. There are some open issues already around this topic. Can I ask that you have a look around, and it you think it isn't covered by them, update this issue with further suggestions?  Thanks!\n. :+1: \n. For me, the advantage of the shim's is running the application's from the command line, so icons don't really matter for me.  Personal preference I guess.\n. > I see shimgen as workaround for a broken symlink support in Windows. On Windows and on other operating systems, symlinks always inherit the icon of their target. IMHO that makes sense, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nI don't disagree with you on that point.  However, for me, the shims that end up in the Chocolatey\\bin folder are things like `dupfinder.exe`, `gitversion.exe`, `inspectcode.exe` and various other things.  None of these tools have a GUI, they all run from the command line.  As a result, I typically never have a need to look in the Chocolatey\\bin folder.\n\nOther applications that are installed through Chocolatey almost always have Start Menu, or desktop links, so again, I don't need to go to the Chocolatey\\bin folder.  It is just as simple for me to hit the Windows key, type the first few character of the application name, and then hit enter.\n\nYes, it's personal preference.\n. Can you please try again?\n\nThis link:\n\nhttp://chocolatey.org/api/v2/package/chocolatey/\n\nWorks fine for me.\n\nGary\n. What is the custom source that you are using?\n\nThere was a similar issue here:\n\nhttp://superuser.com/questions/786845/is-packageid-now-case-sensitive-in-chocolatey-install-command\n\nWith ProGet.  Does this help?\n\nChocolatey is **not** case sensitive, but certain custom sources are.\n. > My own custom source. An HTTP URL.\n\nYes, but what is hosting the packages? \n\n> And confirmed that when NOT specifying a custom source, it is NOT case sensitive.\n\nSo this clearly points the finger a NOT being a Chocolatey issue, but rather a problem with what is hosting the packages.\n. As noted in the SuperUser post, there was also a change in NuGet that made things change.\n\nI don't know off the top of my head if .27 took a new dependency on the latest version, I suspect it did, but @ferventcoder can confirm, and if so, this is inadvertently the issue you are now seeing.\n. > We are still running an old NuGet version on the TeamCity server.\n\nYes, but Chocolatey bundles the NuGet.exe, so it will not be using the same one as TeamCity.\n\nI have just confirmed that Chocolatey .27 ships with NuGet 2.8.2:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1271146/4670382/923ac124-5576-11e4-8818-6b201fc9dd0c.png)\n\nThe only thing I can think would be to replace the NuGet.exe in the chocolateyInstall folder with an older version, but this might have **adverse** side effects.\n. > They probably made a mistake.\n\nThis is certainly possible, but I don't think anyone has investigated this yet though in order to follow up with them properly.\n. You can find it here:\n\nhttps://chocolatey.org/packages/chocolatey/0.9.9-alpha-20150125\n\n`choco install chocolatey -Pre`\n. > I don't know where to see the list of valid beta versions.\n\nThe versions of a particular package are shown at the bottom of each package page.\n. > I didn't know how to find this alpha pre-release page.\n\nFrom any package version page, i.e:\n\nhttps://chocolatey.org/packages/chocolatey/0.9.8.32\n\nScroll to the bottom, and you will see:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1271146/5938971/b46c68e2-a6f7-11e4-8f01-32e884b8651c.png)\n\nWhere you can then see _all_ available package versions, including pre-release.\n. In order to support older operating systems, Chocolatey maintains compatibility with PowerShell 2.  There is nothing to stop you as a package maintainer taking a dependency on a higher version of PowerShell for your installation scripts, but bear in mind, unless your package takes an explicit dependency on PowerShell Version 3, which involves a machine reboot, you are going to run into problems.\n. @svnpenn It is my experience, that installing Powershell 3 requires a reboot of the host machine in order to fully install PowerShell.\n. Yip, sounds like we are talking about the same thing :-)\n\nIf you wanted to use PowerShell 3 commands in your package, you could take a dependency on the PowerShell 3 Chocolatey Package.  However, the side effect of this would be that when PowerShell 3 was installed, it would require a reboot.  If you threw something like [Boxstarter](http://boxstarter.org/) into the mix, then the reboot could be handled, but it is certainly a complication.  \n\nYour approach of checking for PowerShell 3, and then gracefully prompting for the user to install it, would save the hassle.\n. This was a good idea! :+1: \n. Hello,\n\nThanks for your interest in doing this.  This is really a duplicate of this Issue: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/67\n\nIf you have a look there, you will see a couple options on how to achieve this just now, while this issue is implemented.\n\nI will close this issue for now.\n\nHope that helps.\n. Looks like you might have changed the wrong file :-)\n\nThe files that you are looking for is in:\n\n```\nC:\\ProgramData\\chocolatey\\chocolateyInstall\n```\n\nThe file you have changed is the one in the nuget package, which is used to populate the ProgramData\\chocolatey folder.  These are not the files that actually run chocolatey.\n\nGive that a try, and let us know how you get on.\n. Sorry, I updated my comment above, as I noticed it wasn't showing properly.\n\nPlease try the above folder, and edit the chocolatey.config file in there.\n. Perfect!\n\nGlad to hear you got it to work.\n. This issues list is reserved for raising issues about Chocolatey core functionality, rather than issues with package creation.\n\nCan I suggest that you ask a question on the forums here:\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/chocolatey\n\nHaving said that, I think what you are looking for in the `installArgs` flag so that you can pass parameters to the native installer.  You can find details about that here:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CommandsInstall#installarguments-optional---v09813\n\nI am going to close this issue for now.\n. > For instance, currently i am trying to send an argument -i and also -installArguments and I can't use both in the same line.\n\nThis is the point that I am making. -i is not a valid argument to pass in when calling `choco install`.  If -i is a parameter that you want to pass into the native installer that is contained within the Chocolatey Package, you will need to pass them into the -installArguments command.  Please see the example that are shown at the bottom of the wiki article that I linked to above.\n. Sorry to hear that you are having problems!\n\nCan I ask that you post this issue here:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org\n\nThat is where all issues with the Chocolatey Website are recorded, this issues list is specifically for the Chocolatey Application.\n\nThanks\n. > Got it. Sorry about that!\n\nNot a problem at all :-)\n. @svnpenn what version of Chocolatey are you using?\n\nI have just tried what @ferventcoder suggested, but it is working for me.\n. Hmm, same here.\n\nThe test that I did was to run the `chocolateyInstall.ps1` file again for the fiddler4 package which I already had installed.  I wonder if it is something in your chocolateyInstall.ps1 file that is causing the issue.\n\nCan you share what you have in there?\n. Hmm, looks like the issue is here:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/helpers/functions/Get-ChocolateyUnzip.ps1#L49\n\nThis environment variable is only set when Chocolatey is run using:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/functions/Run-ChocolateyPS1.ps1#L28\n\nWhich I \"think\" we/you are circumventing doing things this way.  This certainly \"should\" work, but I think we need to take a look at this.\n\nFor now, you should be able to progress by first setting this environment variable to the required value, i.e. where you have the package install files, after you load the PowerShell module.\n\nHTH\n. @gutierri I am not really sure that I understand the reasoning, or what this would look like.\n\nAre you suggesting that if a maintainer is no longer able to keep a package up to date, that if someone else starts to maintain the package, the original maintainer isn't allowed to access them?\n\nThis really doesn't sound useful to me, and certainly not the spirit that Chocolatey was built on.\n\nYes, we are aware that package maintainers come and go, and some packages slip in terms of package versions, but that is inherent in the nature of community contributions.  Doing something like I think you are suggesting would, IMHO, make the situation worse.\n\nIf you are finding that packages are out of date, please feel free to follow the package triage process which is documented here:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/PackageTriageProcess\n. > Remove the permission of the developer, there Seems to be a good idea even.\n\nSorry, this is the part that I don't like.  Take as an example the following situation.\n\nA developer, let's call him Bob, creates a Chocolatey Package, and posts it to Chocolatey.org.  It gets moderated and approved, and people start using it.  It turns out to be a really popular package and lots of people use it.  From time to time, the original application creators release a new version of the application, and Bob updates the Chocolatey Package so that people can get the updates easily.  Then, Bob and his wife have a baby.  Bob doesn't have as much time as he used to, and as a result, the Chocolatey package starts to fall behind in the releases.  The people who are interested in the package start to email Bob and ask him to update the package.  Bob doesn't have time to answer the emails because he is holding a crying baby, and hasn't slept for 48 hours.\n\nOk, granted, this is a made up situation, but I don't think it is far from a potential situation that could happen.  It doesn't have to be a new baby, it could be a new job, moving house, starting a new hobby.  Lots of things could happen that would prevent a developer updating a Chocolatey package.  To then remove permission for that developer to do anything with the package would be the wrong approach in my opinion.\n\nRather, is another developer is interested in helping to maintain a package, they can follow the package Triage process, as defined above, and become a co-maintainer of the package.\n\nHope this makes sense!\n. @ferventcoder I just approved the php package yesterday. It worked fine for me?!?\n. While I see this bug, I am reminded about something else, which is semi-related :-)\n\nI noticed that the Install-ChocolateyShortcut.ps1 file isn't linked in this file either.  While fixing the first, can this be done also, or you want separate issue?\n. :+1: cool, I can take care of this one.  Hopefully get to it tonight.\n. This is the PR that you are referring to: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/278\n\nAnd this looks like exactly what we are going to need.  Although, in his PR he explicitly excludes the file that is being requested in this issue, i.e. UnInstall-ChocolateyZipPackage.\n\nAlso, this issue is a duplicate of https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/230\n\nThe PR targets the master branch, you happy for me to go ahead and pull it in, or how do you want to handle this?\n. Ah, gotcha...\n. Done, diddly, done.\n. This simply means that the package is in the moderation queue, and as a result, it will not be shown to search results.  I am looking at the package now, and if it fits all required criteria, it will be approved, otherwise, you will be asked to make changes, and re-published the same version of the package again, with changes.\n\nGary\n. @sindux Thanks for doing this, this was on my todo list.\n\nI will get this reviewed and hopefully pull in shortly.\n. Sorry, I am not sure that I follow what you mean...\n\nWhat are you expecting that the parameter `extractionPath` is used as the destination path when using the unzip chocolatey helper?\n\nGary\n. I am still unclear about what you are asking for...\n\nDoes this help:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/How-To-Parse-PackageParameters-Argument\n\nGary\n. > Would it be possible to create a function or something? I would like to use this for multiple packages. Is it possible to include this function in InstallChocolatey.ps1. What is your opinion regarding this?\n\nThere is nothing to stop you adding additional ps1 files to your packages, and simply dot sourcing them for use within your chocolateyInstall.ps1 file.  That way, you maintain your helper functions in one place, and use them across multiple packages.  If you think that these helper functions are generic enough, then by all means, submit them as a pull request, and we can look into whether it makes sense to include them within Chocolatey core.\n. > Closed as a solution has been found\n\nFor the benefit of others who might find this issue as the result of a search, could you share what you are now doing?\n\nGary\n. Thank you! :-)\n. > Closed as a solution has been found\n\nAgain, can you share what you are now doing? Thanks!\n. Thank you! :-)\n. I think that this might be a better location for this issue:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-package-updater\n\nWhen you move it there, can you provide some more details about the problem that you are having, with steps to reproduce?\n. @ferventcoder can you provide a link to where this is done in the source code?  I have heard @mwrock talk about this as well, but I have never hunted it out.\n. Thanks! :-)\n. @ferventcoder is this an issue with the Atom package, rather than with Chocolatey?  Or something that will be addressed in vNext?\n. > Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but could this have to do something with the recent force lowercasing the package IDs?\n\nI don't think so, or see how.  I have just done a choco update atom, which took my installation from 0.116.0 to 0.154.0 and the install worked fine.\n. > so if the installer chrashes... choco thinks it has already installed the latest version...\n\nThis is a side effect of the way chocolatey currently does the installation, something which is changing in vNext of Chocolatey.\n. @juliankrispel thanks for the offer of a contribution!  ChocolateyGUI would welcome any assistance you can provide as well :-)  https://github.com/chocolatey/ChocolateyGUI\n. Noice!  Of the two, I think I prefer the top one :-)\n\nWhat do you think @ferventcoder ?\n\nThe one thing I would say is that it does sort of remind me of the Commodore 64 logo.\n. I quite like this one:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1271146/5763915/40591510-9ce6-11e4-9404-787bf0654287.png)\n. Wow, these are really good!  Great work @juliankrispel Personally, I also like 8 a lot, but I keep coming back to normal 6 as well.  I really like the colours, although I appreciate they are completely different to what we have now :smile_cat: \n. > With the icon I'm a fan of no colon. 1b with white C is also quite interesting.\n\nAgreed, I like 1b because of the bevelled edge on the \"wrapper\" of the chocolate.  No colon gets my vote as well.\n. @ferventcoder I like the Jolly Roger Regular :+1: \n. @juliankrispel thanks for getting back to us about this, really appreciate it! :smile_cat: \n. Hey,\n\nHave a look at github.com/chocolatey/chocolateygui it bundles the msi within its Chocolatey package.  I agree that we need some more documentation in this area though.\n\nGary\n\nSent from my Windows Phone\n\n---\n\nFrom: David Keanmailto:notifications@github.com\nSent: \u200e21/\u200e12/\u200e2014 17:52\nTo: chocolatey/chocolateymailto:chocolatey@noreply.github.com\nSubject: [chocolatey] [wiki] Create Packages needs a little more guidance around raw binaries (#646)\n\nHey, new to chocolatey and after getting an issue file against me to add a chocolatey package for https://github.com/davkean/audio-switcher I went to the the wiki to understand what that meant.\n\nAfter just reading the wiki (in particular, https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages), it's unclear to me what exactly I put in the package - all the examples show using chocolateyInstall.ps1 to download from the web and run the installer. This makes sense because most of top packages seem to be wrappers around existing applications (Chrome, Notepad2, etc).\n\nBut I don't have a installer, or a web site with the binaries. Is there a way to just put the executable in the package and call it a day? If there is, the wiki doesn't call this out.\n\nIt would be great if you had a flow chat, ie \"if  you have a traditional MSI on a web, do this\", \"if you just have raw binary do this other thing\", etc.\n\nThanks\n\n---\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/646\n. > Hey, thanks Gary, will do.\n\nLet us know if you run into any problems with getting the package created.  We can leave this issue open as a reminder to improve the documentation in this area.\n\nGary\n. @ahmedmohiduet in both the Command Window and PowerShell Window you will get a download progress indication, as shown here:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1271146/5592937/0479c5c0-91e3-11e4-8b39-4387ee505424.png)\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1271146/5592939/0bfa387a-91e3-11e4-9869-10ac792908eb.png)\n\nThese will disappear once the file download happens.  Anything after that is just the installation time.\n\nDoes that help?\n\nGary\n. In order for this to work, you would have to do the following:\n\n`choco install nodejs.install`\n\nClose and re-open your Command/PowerShell window\n\n`npm install -g grunt-cli`\n\n`npm install -g bower`\n\nThe important thing here is the closing of the shell to get the initial npm installs to work.\n\nHope that helps!\n\nGary\n. @aronovgj I think that this issue would be best added here:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-package-updater\n\nCan you please re-create the issue there, and I will close this issue.\n\nThanks\n. @aronovgj please accept my apologies, I was unaware of the history of this issue, and based on the wording, I believed it sounded like a ChocoPkgUp.exe issue, not a native Chocolatey one.\n. > Dont know if was session timeout or something, or if the group is moderated and the post will show up later? \n\nYes, the forums are moderated.  I don't see it in the queue for moderation though.  Hopefully it will turn up, and if/when it does, it will get approved.  Thanks for taking the time to explain this further.\n. @andulv I have just approved your Google Groups post :+1: \n. > Would it be possible to go for one of these pledges even though the Kickstarter is closed?\n\nSorry, I am going to have to leave that question for @ferventcoder.  I know that he is out just now, but he will definitely follow up with you.\n. > Definitely should stay with equals if possible.\n\nThis is my opinion as well, but wanted to understand the thought process that @glennsarti had before rolling back.\n. Thanks for getting back to me.\n\nI was almost convinced that I tested the code that I used before I posted it into the wiki, but sounds like there is an issue there.  Let me look at this again, and make sure it is correct.\n\nThanks for bringing to it our attention!\n. Hmm, looking again, look like Matt is using a : as the separator within his packages:\n\nhttps://chocolatey.org/packages/VisualStudio2013Ultimate\n\nI must have tried to change this to = and messed up the article.\n\nI will correct this.\n. > No problem. Also, should I be allowed to make changes to wiki like that, or should I be raising an issue first?\n\nThat would be for @ferventcoder to comment on for the official answer :smile_cat: \n\nIn my mind, editing the wiki should be allowed, crowd sourcing documentation has a lot of merit.  However, perhaps we might want to use a Pull Request model for this, rather than allowing editing directly, to ensure the changes are actually required/desired.\n. > perhaps. How does on PR wiki docs?\n\nBoo! I thought since the wiki is just a git repo under the hood that this would be possible, but looks like you have to fudge it!\n\nhttp://fusiongrokker.com/post/how-you-can-contribute-to-taffy-documentation\n. > Do we need a bin root? Or is it that choco is not doing a sufficient job in some cases?\n\nWith the changes that are coming in vNext, or at least, how I understand them, the need to Get-BinRoot should become non-existent, but that does raise the question about deprecating and updating the use of it.\n. Closing this, as it is a duplicate of https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/675\n. @dschinkel can you execute the following command:\n\n```\nchoco install filezilla -force -debug\n```\n\nAnd paste the output into a gist and link to it from here?\n\nAlso, what version of Windows are you on?  And what version of Chocolatey? Are you running from PowerShell or from Command Window?  And are you running either of these as an Administrator?\n. Chocolatey \"knows\" which packages are installed, based on what folders exist in the lib folder.  This is what is used as the \"index\" of installed packages.\n. Yes, that is intended.  See here:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org/issues/162\n\nFor more information.\n. @DarwinCSIWindowscom can I get you to re-create your issue here:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues\n\nThis is where all new work will be carried out.\n\nThanks!\n. Sorry to hear that you are having issues!\n\nCan you please try the answer to this StackOverflow question:\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/30720496/why-is-powershell-not-recognized-when-installing-chocolatey\n. Not sure where the MySQL command would be coming into play though?!?\n. @hifriend21 you will likely need to close and open the command window for the PATH change to take effect.  Did you do this?\n\nCan you output what is currently in your PATH variable here?\n. What happens if you try just `@powershell`\n. That was going to be my next question! :-)\n\nIf you hit the Windows key, and then search for powershell, does anything come up?\n. > @hifriend21 said...\n> Which is I can't even install the powershell.Thanks for helping, there is no other ways to get chocolatey, exept cmd?\n\nWhile there are other way's to do the install, none of them really matter.  Chocolatey, at the minute, has a direct dependency on PowerShell.  If you don't have that installed, then unfortunately, you won't be able to use Chocolatey.\n. @zilexa have a look here:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/CommandsReference#how-to-pass-options--switches\n\nHopefully that will help.\n. There was some more discussion on this here:\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!searchin/chocolatey/.config/chocolatey/VKm1ARnzOcg/3jQ-kX5P09sJ\n\nGary\n. That is great news! :-)\n. A tool has been proposed here:\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/chocolatey/VKm1ARnzOcg\n\nThat does something similar.\n. @CumpsD Is this what you are after?\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CommandsSources\n. Not a problem at all, happy to help out! :-)\n. @ferventcoder have you reviewed https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/542?  Seems like something we could include, but we would need some tests around it.\n. Hey,\n\nI am reasonably new to git, and am certainly no master when it comes to best practices, and although I follow most of what is suggested above, I would LOVE to see this written up into a wiki article that explained the why's and why not's, so that people getting started out can know the process to follow, which then makes the process of pulling in changes that much easier.\n\nFor instance, in all the updates lately I have been reading a lot about the desire to keep the commit history clean, and the need for doing rebases etc.  Now I \"get\" most of this, but I think it would be good if someone (i.e. someone who knows exactly what they are talking about) could describe what this means in the context of the Chocolatey project.  I understand that this could potentially be a lot of work, but I also think that it could save a lot of work when pulling in all the PR's.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nGary\n. That is great news!\n. @ferventcoder off the top of my head, I am not sure.  I will have a look.\n. For what it is worth, I agree with Matt as well.  Contributing to this project was the first time I had ever used Pester, and I can honestly say that it was very simple to get up to speed with, and there are plenty of existing tests in the code base to use as a basis for new tests, so there really is no good reason , IMO, to not include additional unit tests.\n\nGary\n. Hey,\n\nGlad to hear that this will be of some use to you! :-)\n\nGary\n. This has been pulled in here:\n\n201ad95736b974f9ab0625362c2999eda2307408\n. Not a problem at all.  Would welcome any feedback (good or bad), it can only help me to get better :-)\n. Hey,\n\nMore than happy to do what ever is required, but can I ask for a bit of hand holding for this, still relatively new to git, and don't want to do anything wrong :-)\n\nAre you simply looking for me to rebase so that there is a single commit for the PR?  If so, could you walk me through the steps?\n\nThanks, much appreciated!  My experience with git to date has been as a single developer working in one branch and one remote, so I haven't yet ventured into the sort of details that you guys are now facing.\n\nAlso, is there something that I need to change around the asserts?  If so, happy to do this as well.\n\nThanks\n\nGary\n. Sounds easy :P\n\nI will let you know how i get on.\n\nThanks for all your help!\n\nGary\n\nSent from my Windows Phone\n\n---\n\nFrom: Rich Siegelmailto:notifications@github.com\nSent: \u200e19/\u200e04/\u200e2013 21:14\nTo: chocolatey/chocolateymailto:chocolatey@noreply.github.com\nCc: Gary Ewan Parkmailto:gep13@gep13.co.uk\nSubject: Re: [chocolatey] Issue 235 - Created new Helper Function to create generic shortcut (#238)\n\nC:\\gitrepos\\chocolatey [branch]> git remote -v\norigin  git@github.com:rismoney/chocolatey.git (fetch)\norigin  git@github.com:rismoney/chocolatey.git (push)\nupstream        git@github.com:chocolatey/chocolatey.git (fetch)\nupstream        git@github.com:chocolatey/chocolatey.git (push)\n\ngit checkout master\ngit fetch upstream\ngit rebase upstream/master\n\nthen\ngit checkout yourbranch\ngit fetch upstream\ngit rebase upstream/master - this puts your changes on top of the current HEAD\n\nthen\ngit rebase -i upstream/master\neditor should be launched\n\nyou should see a list of all your commits, with the word pick in front.\nstarting with the second commit change the first word from pick to fixup\nrepeat for all subsequent comits\nclose editor with save\n\nthen\ngit commit --amend to fixup the single commit message\n\nthen\ngit push -f origin\n\nyou will then have a single commit that looks like you did it perfectly the 1st time.\n\n---\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/238#issuecomment-16683731\n. Ok, I think I have done everything that you suggested, but I am now also a little confused.  How did it get into this pull request already?  I expected the last command that I ran, i.e:\n\ngit push -f origin\n\nTo put the rewritten commits into my forked repo, and from there I would have to update the pull request, but this seems to have happened automagically.  What gives?  Or what am I missing?\n\nThanks for all the help by the way, it really helped! Would have never figured that out on my own! :-)\n\nGary\n. Gotcha, that makes sense. Have to take my hat off to Git and Github, they really do provide a great system.  Once you get past the learning curve that is :-)\n. Due to me deleting the original branch that this PR was submitted on, I had to recreate it, as a result, the linking is broken.  However, I have recreated the PR, and pulled it in here:\n\n201ad95736b974f9ab0625362c2999eda2307408\n. This has been implemented here:\n\ne8c017ae54c5f2d37f7bdc908bb2e4cab77082d1\n. Hello staabm,\n\nThis would appear to be an issue with the GnuWin package, rather than chocolatey install.\n\nCan I suggest that you ask a question about the package on the (new) discussion forums on the package page:\n\nhttp://chocolatey.org/packages/GnuWin\n\nAnd hopefully the package creator will be able to provide some insight to the problem that you are having.\n\nHope that helps!\n\nGary\n. Due to me deleting the original branch that this PR was created on, the link has been broken.  Even though I created a new branch, with the same name, it didn't \"automagically\" work, which I didn't think that it would.  However, this has been address here:\n\ne8c017ae54c5f2d37f7bdc908bb2e4cab77082d1\n. This is actually a problem with the MySql package, not with chocolatey.  As such, you should really contact the package owners, which you can do from the contact owners link here:\n\nhttp://chocolatey.org/packages/mysql\n\nThis particular issue, I believe, is due to a dependency on the C++ Redistributable.  If you try running the mysql installer directly, it tells you about this.\n\nThe required dependency is actually another chocolatey package, which you can go ahead an install.\n\nGary\n. Hello,\n\nAs per your other issue, your best bet would be to contact the package owner directly, which you can do from this link:\n\nhttp://chocolatey.org/packages/redis\n\nGary\n. Should we add a task, somewhere, to get the documentation updated to reflect this change, or where do things like that get logged so they are not forgotten?\n. Any word on when a new release of choco is going to be pushed out, to include changes like this?\n\nThanks\n\nGary\n. Cool, happy to beta test if you need people to give it a try.\n\nYeah, never tried installing a \"hooky\" version of chocolatey yet, always installed the proper version.  There is nothing immediately pressing.  I know Matt has made a couple of changes that are interesting, but happy to wait, was just curious :-)\n. rismoney, sorry, that wasn't in anyway a slight at you, or anyone, sorry if it came across like that!  All I meant was, if I install something like chocolatey on my own machine, I want to install the fully released version, not a pre-release version, therefore I wouldn't install the source code version.  As a result, I am willing to wait for the new features for my main machines, but can fire up a VM for testing purposes.  The term \"hooky\" probably wasn't the best in this case.  Apologies.\n\nmwrock, that would be great.  We are using MyGet for the ChocolateyGUI and it does a great job!\n. Ah, gotcha.  :-)\n\nI have only touched the surface of Pester, mainly due to Matt's blog posts, but it really is very clever!\n. Is that a new repo?  This link doesn't seem to work for me :-(\n. Just in case you didn't see the other part of the conversation Paul, the Puppet Chocolatey module may not fully work properly (i.e. for validating installed version of a choco package) until the other pull request for completing exit codes is pulled into master and a new version of Chocolatey is released.\n. oh yeah, I know, I have been following, just wanted to let Paul know, who I think is going to be using the Puppet Module in anger, that he may see some issues, until the next release is pushed out. :-)\n. To try to help out, I have added a pull request to try to cover this issue.  Not sure if it covers everything that would be required, but it does add a Unit Test to cover this scenario.  Would be interested to hear thoughts on what I have suggested.  Thanks!\n. Going to go ahead an close this issue.  I will do another pull request with correct line feeds, etc.\n. Woot ;-)\n. Woo hoo!  What is the \"done\" thing now?  Should I delete the branch on my fork?  Or should I leave it.\n\nThanks\n\nGary\n. Okay dokay :-)\n. Just putting in my 2p worth,...\n\nIs it worth supporting Server Core?  There is only going to be a small subset of chocolatey packages that are going to work on Core, with a high number of them simply not going to install at all.  How would we make it such that this was clear across all packages, so the inevitable \"It doesn't work\" issues don't crop up.\n\nGary\n. Yip, this makes sense, just wanted to make sure that we weren't going down a route that didn't make any sense.\n\nYeah, it's SharpZipLIb that is the \"standard\" library that is used in-house.\n. Sure, I can take a look at this one.  I am away this weekend, but I can take a look at it after that :-)\n. Hey,\n\nJust a thought, if this is going to go ahead, I would suggest that the documentation at the top of the Install-ChocolateyInstallPackage.ps1 file should be updated to make it clear that it is not just msi and exe, but also for an msu.\n\nThoughts?\n\nGary\n. I think that this would definitely make sense to be included in the wiki, \"somewhere\".  I have on my todo list to do a complete write up of \"How to contribute to the Chocolatey Project\", i.e. fork the source code, create a branch, do your work, run the Pester Tests, Write new Pester Tests, commit code, do pull request etc, but again, never seem to get the cycles to do it.\n. Is there not already a chocolatey puppet module?  I have it on my todo list to have a look at it, as I am just getting into puppet, but I had assumed that this would already be taken care of there.\n\nGary\n. Ah, I see.  I am still working with straight up package, file, and services in my puppet manifests just now, but I will be looking to extend into using Chocolatey as well.  Look forward to giving it a try.\n. @zippy1981 are you in a position to clean up this PR by rebasing on the current master?  If not, I can submit a new PR with similar functionality? Thanks!\n. @ferventcoder did you follow up with @macioosch about this?\n\nAre you happy for this to be pulled in?\n. @ferventcoder do we keep the most recent logos somewhere?\n.

Some testing required here.\n. I really think that this is a good idea!  The only concern that I would have would be keeping what is in the \"help\" in source, in sync with the \"help\" on the wiki.  I mentioned this to @mwrock in a previous commit that I saw him doing where he had to manually update a synopsis on the wiki to match a change to the synopsis in the code.  Is there any way to have \"one source of truth\", i.e. that we store the help documentation and synopsis information in one place, e.g. in the source code repo, and then flow this through into the wiki.  That way you update once, and it is correct in both places?\n\nJust a thought...\n. Hmm, that isn't bad actually, and not unlike other systems, for instance, PowerShell itself with it's Update-Help option.  Would it make sense to use the wiki as the \"one source of truth\" and then have Chocolatey download and cache the help files locally?\n\nThoughts?\n. @rismoney The more I think about this, the more I like it.  Will add it to my ever growing list of things to look into :-)\n. As an experiment, i think it would be good to know that we can load a file from file system and render as help text when requested. I don't see why we couldn't do this though.\n\nBut yes, i think for now, that is the plan.\n\nGary\n\nSent from my Windows Phone\n\n---\n\nFrom: corkupinemailto:notifications@github.com\nSent: \u200e07/\u200e05/\u200e2013 02:07\nTo: chocolatey/chocolateymailto:chocolatey@noreply.github.com\nCc: Gary Ewan Parkmailto:gep13@gep13.co.uk\nSubject: Re: [chocolatey] WIP - help refactor (#288)\n\nSo what do you think I keep going in the same direction for now?

Hello,\n\nI have just checked the Chocolatey Source Code, and the Stop-OnAppIsInstalled is not part of the code case, so this must be a method that the package owner expects to already be available in the system.\n\nI think the best course of action would be for you to contact the package owner directly:\n\nYou can do that by clicking the Contact Owners link here:\n\nhttp://chocolatey.org/packages/Devbox-ConEmu\n\nHope that helps!\n\nGary\n. When you said:\n\n\"I'm creating a package that runs a service\"\n\nI take it you mean a windows service?  If so, how are you creating the service in the first place?  Are you using something like WiX?  If so, you can put the responsibility for stoppping/starting this service into the hands of the installation package, i.e. the MSI, and not worry about this within the chocolatey package.\n\nGary\n. Rob, what are your thoughts on this?  Does it make sense to add this functionality into another helper method, such as InstallChocolateyPowerShellPath?  There is an existing helper method for a generic environment variable: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/HelpersInstallChocolateyEnvironmentVariable but if it makes sense to split out the PowerShell Module Path, happy to take a stab at implementing this.\n. What version of PowerShell are you running?  And have you installed the Web PI Commandline? (cinst webpicommandline).\n\nThe reason that I ask is that this worked for me:\n\n![clist_webpi](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1271146/571096/f237583e-c76b-11e2-9ae2-b063570c4fef.png)\n. Looks like there is an issue though, in that this should be handled more gracefully, and not just disappear, but if we can trace the problem, we can work on a solution :-)\n. Ah, my test was on a Windows 7 machine :-)  Will do a test on a Windows 8 machine as well.\n. Hmmm...\n\nJust tried again on my Windows 8 machine, and I get the same results as in the above screenshot.\n\nWhat happens if you try running the following:\n\n```\ncmd.exe /c webpicmd /List /ListOption:All\n```\n\nThis is what Chocolatey is doing under the hood for you.\n\nGary\n. Doh! That is the flag I was looking for! I was trying with -verbose, and that wasn't doing anything :-)\n. Ah, that makes sense :-)\n\nI have a potential fix, namely:\n\n```\n  if ($source -like 'webpi') {\n$chocoInstallLog = Join-Path $nugetChocolateyPath 'chocolateyWebPiInstall.log';\nRemove-LastInstallLog $chocoInstallLog\n$webpiArgs =\"/c webpicmd /List /ListOption:All | Tee-Object -FilePath `'$chocoInstallLog`';\"\nStart-ChocolateyProcessAsAdmin \"cmd.exe $webpiArgs\" -nosleep\nCreate-InstallLogIfNotExists $chocoInstallLog\n$installOutput = Get-Content $chocoInstallLog -Encoding Ascii\nforeach ($line in $installOutput) {\n  Write-Host $line\n}\n```\n\nWhich does the same thing as the Windows Feature equivalent, but it makes the command VERY slow to execute.  Should I go ahead and make a PR to add this in?  Or wait for another solution?\n\nGary\n. Just tried the latest webpi cli and looks like it requires admin privileges as well :-(\n. When you mention hosting packages elsewhere, when they are not intended for everyone, is it worth mentioning somewhere like MyGet.org? i.e. The package can still be on a public feed, but not polluting the Chocolatey.org feed?\n\nGary\n. @Redsandro You are right, my command is directed here:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/355\n\nSorry :)\n. An out there suggestion, but...\n\nCan we create a choco package that configuring this as a default in the common editors? Assuming that these settings are exposed somewhere, it should be trivial to check whether an editor is installed, and make the update.\n\nJob done!\n. Agreed, if we could wrap this up in cpack to the point that this was a non-issue, that would be best for everyone.  Would the act of cpack result in changes to the physical file?  i.e. if someone is using source control, (and obviously they shoudl be) would they be left with the \"correct encoding on the file?  If so, should cpack throw a message back to indicate what was done, adn why?\n. Would it be worth creating another command that could be used ahead of cpack?  A dedicated function for doing just this?\n\nThe only problem with this is that it would be down to the user to run the command, and to know to run the command, which takes us back to the same problem.\n\nThe only other suggestion would be to add an \u201cautomatic moderation\u201d step, post upload to the chocolatey servers.  Almost synonymous with a compilation, where we do all the necessary work, in this case the encoding, before setting the package live.\n. From the link posted above:\n\n> If you don\u2019t respect this rule, some characters are not displayed correctly in the Gallery on Chocolatey.org, because the Gallery assumes UTF-8.\n. Perhaps the wiki needs to be refined, but my understanding is that the problem is exactly as stated in the latter part of the quote.  If you don't do what is described here, then characters are rendered incorrectly when pushed to the Chocolatey Gallery.  @TomOne will be able to provide more information on this, as my understanding on this issue is slim, at best.\n.

There are just too many packages for this to be done by Chocolatey itself, we need the help of the community. However, as is always the case, life sometimes gets in the way, and packages become outdated. At this point, you have done the right thing by trying to reach out to the original author.  If this doesn't work, then the best idea would be to take the current package source code (if available) fork it, make the updates, and then push to Chocolatey. In order for this to happen, you would need to be made a co-owner of the package, which can be done. This is much preferable than creating a duplicate package.\n\nGary\n\nSent from my Windows Phone\n\n---\n\nFrom: Roger Qiumailto:notifications@github.com\nSent: \u200e29/\u200e06/\u200e2013 09:30\nTo: chocolatey/chocolateymailto:chocolatey@noreply.github.com\nSubject: [chocolatey] Updating old packages that are not maintained on Chocolatey (#308)\n\nHow do I go about updating a package that isn't maintained by the author in Chocolatey. For example, papercut is the 2010 version on Chocolatey (which I installed), but I want the 2013 version that is available directly. Do I have to create my own package? There should be an easier process to keep up to date.\n\n---\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/308\n. Rich,\n\nI guess what I was referring to there was the github repo for the package.  It would be easier to fork this code and create a pull request, rather than to re-invent the wheel and extract the files yourself to put them somewhere else.\n\nGary\n. Good catch :)\n\nI have updated the wiki article with the additional quotes.  Can you check and verify, and it you are happy with it, we can close off this issue.\n\nThanks\n\nGary\n. Yip, I think so.\n. I guess I am on the fence with this one.\n\nI see the benefit in using Chocolatey to install Node and NPM, but once installed, why would I use `choco install gulp-imagemin -source npm`, when I could just as easily do `npm install gulp-imagemin`.  Now, don't get me wrong, the same could be said about installing ruby gems, but I think I am on the fence about this as well.\n\nOther things like webpi, windowsfeatures, vsix, etc, make perfect sense to me.  This, not so much.  Happy to be persuaded otherwise though.\n. With regard to the personal packages, I would like to see these moved off the main chocolatey feed onto a Community Chocolatey Feed on MyGet.Org, or encourage people to create their own MyGet feeds to store the packages.\n. Does the Chocolatey Gallery, which comes from the Nuget Gallery, provide a lot of moderation capabilities?  Or is this something that will have to be built in?\n. This is very cool! :-)\n. I really think that we can start to use this as a starter for ten.  If nothing else, I think I am going to try to lever this for the packages that I maintain, and also at work (assuming you don't mind that is :-))\n. Would this be a case of executing some checks during the cpack command, and then have it fail if something goes wrong, or would this be done on the Chocolatey.org server once the package has been uploaded to the server? Or both?\n. The validation is the tricky part though.  For instance, in a recent package there was a sneaky addition of an Google and Google Tooblar:\n\nhttp://chocolatey.org/packages/avastfreeantivirus\n\nWhatever system we create needs to handle, somehow, the checking of unwanted uninstallations.  I was discussing this with Rob earlier this week.  This could be done, if possible, by taking a snapshot of the registry before and after the install (say with regshot) and also doing a diff of the file system (a harder thing to achieve) and checking for things that shouldn't be there.  If anything else does appear, this would flag the package as rogue, and need further manual validation.\n\nGary\n. side note... @mwrock wrt to that script block, which looks amazing, do those names assume that a Hyper-V VM exists with that name?  If it is not there, what does it do? I think you mentioned before that the VM would be created, but how does it know which iso to use when creating it?\n. Also, I love the idea of BoxStarter being used to validate Chocolatey Packages!  :-)  Talk about dog fooding!  If the Azure support lands, would it be within the realm of legality to use an MSDN Subscription for spinning up VM's, even as a Proof of Concept?  Happy to put my MSDN Sub to use for this if it is allowed.  The credits aren't being used for anything else just now.\n. Sweet, sounds like you have it all wrapped up! Is this your sole project just now, features seem to be coming thick and fast :-)\n. Ah, I see, that makes a bit more sense.  Based on what you had been pushing, I figured you hadn't slept in the last month! :-) Nightware, hopefully you can get it sorted out soon.  Look forward to checking it out!\n. I was having the same thought. I wondered whether the choco update package could be extended to include a flag to run the package through Boxstarter, and have it report back on success or failure. What do you think @mwrock\n.

The example that made this \"click\" for me, in terms of \"virtual packages\" is PDF's.  Lets say you are creating a package that has a dependency on being able to read PDF Documents.  You could point this at a virtual package called PDF Reader, and this in turn would point at something like Adode Reader, Sunatra Reader (either the install, or portable), Foxit Reader, or any other package that can read PDF's.  As long as one of these things is installed, then the dependency for your package has been met, and installation can continue.\n. Hey,\n\nFor development purposes, there is a PowerShell script which allows you to side load a compiled application, but I don't think that the would work for app directly from the store.\n\nIn the Windows Phone eco system, there is an application that you can install that will run off and install all applications that you used to have on your phone. This is really useful for installing all apps when you get a new phone.

If so, maybe this should be a template or Chocolatey function.\n\nI have no clue at all how this works under the hood, but you need to be logged in with your Windows Live ID to be able to install apps. So the script would probably need to check if you are logged in.\n\nBut, this is of course total bull*, MS just wants to keep track of things. Apps can run perfectly fine without knowing who is running it. So it would be totally super awesome sweet if we could actually install apps for users without a Live ID.\n\n---\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/356\n.

Cheers!\n. @ferventcoder this week has been mental, so not had any time to look into this at all yet.  Hoping to get some time at the weekend to take care of this though.  Sorry!\n. Hello,\n\nBy executing the following:\n\n```\nchoco\n```\n\nYou will get an output similar to the following:\n\n```\nPlease run chocolatey /? or chocolatey help - chocolatey v0.9.8.23\n```\n\nFrom which you can get the current installed version of Chocolatey.\n\nHope that helps!\n\nGary\n. Yeah, I saw this:\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/chocolatey/3RJ-9pCGXyA\n\nAfter I read this enhancement request.  I guess I work in a different order :-)\n. What version of Chocolatey are you using?  Is Chocolatey already installed on the machine when you run the build on the TeamCity Build Agent, or are you installing it as part of the build?\n. On the Build Agent, open PowerShell and type\n\n```\nchoco\n```\n\nThis will output the current version number.\n\nSo, to confirm, although you have chocolatey installed on the Build Agent, you are running the Chocolatey installation script again as part of the TeamCity build, is that correct?\n\nIf so, then I think this is the issue.  There is a known issue in 0.9.8.23 where after installing, you have to close and re-open the PowerShell window before running a cinst, otherwise, you get the issue you are seeing.  Can you try taking out the Chocolatey install script just now?\n\nThis issue is fixed, and will be included in the next release.\n. Glad to hear that you got it working! :+1: \n. I suspect that this pull request got closed because you wrote \"Fixes #421\" in the commit message.  Due to the fact that when you fork a repo references to the issues remain pointing at the parent repo, it had the effect of closing the PR (and you were allowed to do this since you opened it in the first place).\n. @Redsandro it has happened to me on another repo, and I tried to dig up the example, but I think it has gone away, since they \"broke\" the connection with the upstream fork, thus creating their own set of issues.\n. If you can make these packages into auto packages, there is nothing to stop you adding them into here:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-coreteampackages\n\nAnd then the Community Server that I have running in the cloud will automagically check for new versions every hour, and cpack and cpush onto Chocolatey.org.\n\nThe more packages that we have out in this repo, the better, imo :-)\n. @Redsandro I \"think\", and Rob can correct me if I am wrong, but the CoreTeamPackages folder has changed in meaning slightly.  Originally, I believe it was only for packages that would be maintained by the core Chocolatey Team Members, and they could be packages that would have a quick SLA, in terms of getting packages out into the wild.  Now, at least as far as I am concerned, it is really aimed at a core repository for Chocolatey Packages, that are updated frequently (using the server that I have provided) and which will all, eventually, go through an automatic triage process to ensure for validity before being pushed to chocolatey.org.  Personally, I would like to see all the auto packages that are already out there, from core team members, and elsewhere, being combined into this one single repository.  I don't see this becoming a heap, but rather a maintained central repository, which is then much easier to triage with automatic processes that we can put in place.\n\nI know what you mean about the auto package process, it took me a while to get my head around it.  If you want to get onto the server in the cloud to take a look at what I am doing, just give me a shout.\n. @Redsandro yeah, I think I have read that thread before.  Hoping that this still isn't the case, as some of the packages I have pushed into there are certainly not critical :-)\n. Anyone can create and push auto packages, there is no implicit need for the chocolatey user to be involved.  However, any packages that make it into the coreteam repo would need to have the chocolatey user as a co-maintainer.\n\nRight now for the setup I have, I have it set up that both me and the chocolatey user can push each package.  However, on the server that I am using, keratin is essentially running under the chocolatey user, so when it automatically finds a new installation package on the interwebs, it pushes as the chocolatey user.  \n\nSo no, don't add me, add the chocolatey user.\n. That's the one.  From the main https://chocolatey.org/ page, the forum link takes you to the Google Group.\n\nWe should perhaps update the Contributing.md if this is not clear in there.\n.

While I like the idea of re-directing to a different URL when required, I am wondering what the exact use case is for this.  Does the recent work that @ferventcoder did to first check the download cache to see if a file is already downloaded, before accessing the URL in the nuspec file cover a lot of the use cases?  How I was planning on using it was the following...\n\nOn one machine that has access to the interwebs, install all the packages that you need.  Mirror the Chocolatey Packages that you want to somewhere internal, i.e. ProGet, or a file source.  Deploy the Cache folder from the interwebs facing machine onto all other machines.  Perform all installs on other machines using -source parameter, and you have a full offline install.\n\nGranted, there is a bit of work up front to make this happen, but once you do it once, it's done.\n\nWhat is the use case of the URL re-direct?  Is it required now that Chocolatey first checks whether the required file has already been downloaded?\n. @jberezanski agree, returning a PSObject, which can be inspected (and easily extended if required) definitely makes a lot of sense.\n. For what it is worth, I would say just go for it.  Don't think @ferventcoder will have a problem with it.\n\nThanks for digging into this!\n. @Haacked has something changed on Github's side that would cause this problem to happen?\n. @Haacked  Ah, could be.  If nothing else, we have exposed a problem that @mwrock has been able to work around.  Thanks for getting back to me.  I will subscribe to the blog for future updates.\n. Hello,\n\nThis sounds like a known issue.  Have you just installed Chocolatey? If so, can you try closing and re-opening the Powershell window and try again?\n\nGary\n. @ferventcoder I don't have an issue with this.  Thoughts?\n. @nemchik There is a Chocolatey Helper method that should help you in persisting the change to the environment variable:\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/HelpersInstallChocolateyEnvironmentVariable\n\nOr, if you want to do it yourself, you can find an example here:\n\nhttps://github.com/gep13/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/gep13.ChocolateyDev/tools/ChocolateyInstall.ps1#L42\n. @jamesgecko You don't \"have\" to change the Environment Variables through the command line, you can use standard Windows functionality to change the environment variables.  I do agree though that we need to put up a page, somewhere, to make it clear all the steps that should be executed.\n. Sweet! I will take a read of it, and make some updates if required.  Thanks for doing this, it is much appreciated! :+1:\n. @Redsandro I believe I am right in saying that this was an attempt to provide \"one source of truth\" for the documentation for the wiki.  Currently, we document a helper method in two places.  In the ps1 file and also in markdown in the wiki.  This is currently done as a manual task, and subject to human error, and becoming out of date.\n\nThis PR was an attempt to generate the markdown for the wiki directly from the help documentation in the ps1 files, so at the very least, they were the same, and we only have to update it in one place, i.e. the ps1 files, and then simply update the wiki articles with this helper.\n. @NJ-Brad Glad to hear that you got this sorted out, and thanks for coming back and closing out the issue.  \n\nHappy choco'ing :-)\n\nGary\n. @rappazzo you can find a link to contact the maintainers of this package on this page here:\n\nhttp://chocolatey.org/packages/eclipse-standard-kepler\n\nHopefully you will hear something back from them, but if you don't can you please follow the package triage process outlined here:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/PackageTriageProcess\n\nTo try to get the problem resolved.\n\nThanks\n\nGary\n. The suggestion here is really a feature request, to include a generic helper method for wrapping calls to 7zip, which is capable of handling multiple file types, not just .zip.\n. I was looking for a label to assign to the issue, i.e. Feature, but I didn't see one.  Never thought to update the title.  Will remember for next time :+1: \n. @030 Not all the functions in Chocolatey have Unit Tests, and it looks like this could be one of the areas that it hasn't been included.  If you can, we would more than happily accept some unit tests for this function.\n. @ferventcoder based on the change of usage of the function, do we need to think about changing the name of the function, or at least creating an alias for it?  Install-ChocolateyZipPackage, by it's name, suggests it will only work with Zip files.  Would a name like Install-ChocolateyCompressedPackage make more sense?\n. Yeah, that works too.\n. @jberezanski oops! My bad! :-)  Good catch!\n. Hey,\n\nIn order to get code added to the codebase, you would need to submit a pull request.\n\nHave a look here:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n\nFor the process, and let us know if you have any questions.\n\nGary\n. Hey,\n\nNo probs.  The mailing list is hosted in a Google Group which you can find here:\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/chocolatey\n\nGary\n. Hey,\n\nSince this is your first post to the forum, it was sitting in the moderation queue.  I have just approved it, so you should see it now.\n\nGary\n. Hello,\n\nHave you read through this:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n\nThis is the process that we follow for accepting contributions to Chocolatey.  You would need to make the changes, and then submit the changes in the form of a Pull Request.\n\nGary\n. Looks like you are using version 2.0.1 of Pester.  As per the setup script here:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/setup.ps1\n\nAnd also the discussion here:\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/chocolatey/9oQwi0-z3K0/discussion\n\nChocolatey needs version 2.0.2 of Pester.\n\nCan you try installing this version, and let us know how you get on?\n. Linqpad actually comes in two versions.  The original version \"choco install linqpad\" which installs a version that targets .Net Framework 3.5, and another one \"choco install linqpad4\" which targets .Net Framework 4.0/4.5.  As a result, they are two separate packages, and there isn't an \"upgrade\" path.\n. In this case, triaging is referring to checking the pull request, for suitability, problems, additional suggestions, etc.  This is the first pass at getting the pull request pulled into the main code base of Chocolatey.  This is a good thing :-)\n\nYou will hear from Rob if there are any changes that need to be made.\n. @vbsql7 can you confirm what version of Chocolatey you are using?  I have just done the following, using `0.9.8.28`\n- Download the nupkg package from https://bitbucket.org/jonforums/uru/downloads/uru.0.7.7.nupkg\n- Saved it to `c:\\temp`\n- Executed the following command `choco install uru -source c:\\temp`\n- Installation succeeded successfully\n- I can see a new uru.bat and uru.ps1 file created in the chocolatey bin folder\n. > This could be the issue of just installing chocolatey and not having that\n> variable set\n\nAgreed, I had assumed that based on the title of this bug that closing and re-opening the shell after a fresh install of Chocolatey had been ruled out by @vbsql7.  I had thought it might be an error in the package itself, but after attempting the install on a clean VM myself, that didn't seem to be the case.\n. Glad to hear you got it working! :smile_cat: \n. Hello,\n\nWhen you installed Chocolatey 0.9.8.25, did you already have a Chocolatey version installed?  Or was this a fresh install?\n\nDoes this path:\n\n```\nC:\\ProgramData\\chocolatey\n```\n\nExist on your file system?\n\nGary\n. Hey,\n\nNope, no breaking of issue etiquette, we are not fussy :-)  Happy to hear from you, and to know that you are using Chocolatey.  The only thing that I would say is that this is really an issue with Chocolatey.org, and as such, in future, if there are any other issues they can be posted here:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org\n\nGetting back to this particular problem though....\n\nAm I right in saying that you were typing out the installation command, while following along reading from the website?  If so, I can see how that would be a problem, given the formatting of the page.  What I would say though is that I don't think the intention is that people will manually type out the command, but rather, use the mechanisms on the page itself.  i.e. there are links that you can click which will put either command into your clipboard, which you can then immediately paste into either a command prompt or a PowerShell window.  The visual representation is really just there to show how easy it is to get Chocolatey installed.\n\nDoes that make sense, or did I miss the problem?\n\nGary\n. Yeah, that throws a few people.  You should be able to right click and choose paste. Or use the menu at top left of command prompt window.\n\nGary\n\n---\n\nFrom: Ted Sandersmailto:notifications@github.com\nSent: \u200e25/\u200e07/\u200e2014 18:13\nTo: chocolatey/chocolateymailto:chocolatey@noreply.github.com\nCc: Gary Ewan Parkmailto:gep13@gep13.co.uk\nSubject: Re: [chocolatey] Tip for improving front page installation directions (#527)\n\nThanks for the replies! If I'm not mistaken, in standard Windows command prompt, Ctrl+V does not paste. So I didn't know how to paste the code and ended up typing it all out without knowing any better.\n\n---\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/527#issuecomment-50177998\n. There is also the ability to create a generic shortcut using this helper method:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/helpers/functions/Install-ChocolateyShortcut.ps1\n\nGary\n. @030 although the helper has been pulled into the master branch, it hasn't yet made it into the Stable branch, therefore it hasn't made it into a released version of Chocolatey.  The original pull request is labelled as 0.9.9, so we would need to check with @ferventcoder about when that is going to be released.\n\nNo, this helper does not take an array of inputs, but rather, works on creating a single shortcut for a given exe.  That is not to say that it couldn't do this, but as it stands right now, it doesn't.\n. Are you running the command prompt or PowerShell window with Administrator rights?\n. I am confused.  Why would Chocolatey need it's own Proxy Settings?  It simply uses the Proxy configuration for the system that it is running on.\n. I think @mwrock did some signing of the Boxstarter Scripts.  Perhaps he can point in right direction.\n. Ah, that was it! I knew there was something :-)\n. Hello,\n\nAs noted in the package description here:\n\nhttp://chocolatey.org/packages/nodejs\n\n`choco install nodejs``\n\nDoesn't include npm.  To do this, you will need to use:\n\n`choco install nodejs.install`\n\nwhich you can find here:\n\nhttp://chocolatey.org/packages/nodejs.install\n\nIf you have any problems after this, we can re-open the issue.\n. Ah, gotcha.\n\nSince `choco install nodejs` is just an alias to nodejs.commandline, it could be made to install npm by default.  We would need to confirm with @ferventcoder, the maintainer of the package, to see what his thoughts on this are.\n. :+1: \n. Looks like for Pester, you have to tell it where the test results end up:\n\nhttp://www.appveyor.com/docs/running-tests\n\nFor other systems it discovers them automatically.\n. In the current version of Chocolatey, no, it keeps all the old versions of the applications around.  For some applications, like Ruby, this is exactly what you want, for other, like Atom, not so much.  There are plans to change this, but for now, it is a case of manually removing the package folders for the older version of the package that you don't want.\n. There are some open issues already around this topic. Can I ask that you have a look around, and it you think it isn't covered by them, update this issue with further suggestions?  Thanks!\n. :+1: \n. For me, the advantage of the shim's is running the application's from the command line, so icons don't really matter for me.  Personal preference I guess.\n. > I see shimgen as workaround for a broken symlink support in Windows. On Windows and on other operating systems, symlinks always inherit the icon of their target. IMHO that makes sense, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nI don't disagree with you on that point.  However, for me, the shims that end up in the Chocolatey\\bin folder are things like `dupfinder.exe`, `gitversion.exe`, `inspectcode.exe` and various other things.  None of these tools have a GUI, they all run from the command line.  As a result, I typically never have a need to look in the Chocolatey\\bin folder.\n\nOther applications that are installed through Chocolatey almost always have Start Menu, or desktop links, so again, I don't need to go to the Chocolatey\\bin folder.  It is just as simple for me to hit the Windows key, type the first few character of the application name, and then hit enter.\n\nYes, it's personal preference.\n. Can you please try again?\n\nThis link:\n\nhttp://chocolatey.org/api/v2/package/chocolatey/\n\nWorks fine for me.\n\nGary\n. What is the custom source that you are using?\n\nThere was a similar issue here:\n\nhttp://superuser.com/questions/786845/is-packageid-now-case-sensitive-in-chocolatey-install-command\n\nWith ProGet.  Does this help?\n\nChocolatey is **not** case sensitive, but certain custom sources are.\n. > My own custom source. An HTTP URL.\n\nYes, but what is hosting the packages? \n\n> And confirmed that when NOT specifying a custom source, it is NOT case sensitive.\n\nSo this clearly points the finger a NOT being a Chocolatey issue, but rather a problem with what is hosting the packages.\n. As noted in the SuperUser post, there was also a change in NuGet that made things change.\n\nI don't know off the top of my head if .27 took a new dependency on the latest version, I suspect it did, but @ferventcoder can confirm, and if so, this is inadvertently the issue you are now seeing.\n. > We are still running an old NuGet version on the TeamCity server.\n\nYes, but Chocolatey bundles the NuGet.exe, so it will not be using the same one as TeamCity.\n\nI have just confirmed that Chocolatey .27 ships with NuGet 2.8.2:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1271146/4670382/923ac124-5576-11e4-8818-6b201fc9dd0c.png)\n\nThe only thing I can think would be to replace the NuGet.exe in the chocolateyInstall folder with an older version, but this might have **adverse** side effects.\n. > They probably made a mistake.\n\nThis is certainly possible, but I don't think anyone has investigated this yet though in order to follow up with them properly.\n. You can find it here:\n\nhttps://chocolatey.org/packages/chocolatey/0.9.9-alpha-20150125\n\n`choco install chocolatey -Pre`\n. > I don't know where to see the list of valid beta versions.\n\nThe versions of a particular package are shown at the bottom of each package page.\n. > I didn't know how to find this alpha pre-release page.\n\nFrom any package version page, i.e:\n\nhttps://chocolatey.org/packages/chocolatey/0.9.8.32\n\nScroll to the bottom, and you will see:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1271146/5938971/b46c68e2-a6f7-11e4-8f01-32e884b8651c.png)\n\nWhere you can then see _all_ available package versions, including pre-release.\n. In order to support older operating systems, Chocolatey maintains compatibility with PowerShell 2.  There is nothing to stop you as a package maintainer taking a dependency on a higher version of PowerShell for your installation scripts, but bear in mind, unless your package takes an explicit dependency on PowerShell Version 3, which involves a machine reboot, you are going to run into problems.\n. @svnpenn It is my experience, that installing Powershell 3 requires a reboot of the host machine in order to fully install PowerShell.\n. Yip, sounds like we are talking about the same thing :-)\n\nIf you wanted to use PowerShell 3 commands in your package, you could take a dependency on the PowerShell 3 Chocolatey Package.  However, the side effect of this would be that when PowerShell 3 was installed, it would require a reboot.  If you threw something like [Boxstarter](http://boxstarter.org/) into the mix, then the reboot could be handled, but it is certainly a complication.  \n\nYour approach of checking for PowerShell 3, and then gracefully prompting for the user to install it, would save the hassle.\n. This was a good idea! :+1: \n. Hello,\n\nThanks for your interest in doing this.  This is really a duplicate of this Issue: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/67\n\nIf you have a look there, you will see a couple options on how to achieve this just now, while this issue is implemented.\n\nI will close this issue for now.\n\nHope that helps.\n. Looks like you might have changed the wrong file :-)\n\nThe files that you are looking for is in:\n\n```\nC:\\ProgramData\\chocolatey\\chocolateyInstall\n```\n\nThe file you have changed is the one in the nuget package, which is used to populate the ProgramData\\chocolatey folder.  These are not the files that actually run chocolatey.\n\nGive that a try, and let us know how you get on.\n. Sorry, I updated my comment above, as I noticed it wasn't showing properly.\n\nPlease try the above folder, and edit the chocolatey.config file in there.\n. Perfect!\n\nGlad to hear you got it to work.\n. This issues list is reserved for raising issues about Chocolatey core functionality, rather than issues with package creation.\n\nCan I suggest that you ask a question on the forums here:\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/chocolatey\n\nHaving said that, I think what you are looking for in the `installArgs` flag so that you can pass parameters to the native installer.  You can find details about that here:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CommandsInstall#installarguments-optional---v09813\n\nI am going to close this issue for now.\n. > For instance, currently i am trying to send an argument -i and also -installArguments and I can't use both in the same line.\n\nThis is the point that I am making. -i is not a valid argument to pass in when calling `choco install`.  If -i is a parameter that you want to pass into the native installer that is contained within the Chocolatey Package, you will need to pass them into the -installArguments command.  Please see the example that are shown at the bottom of the wiki article that I linked to above.\n. Sorry to hear that you are having problems!\n\nCan I ask that you post this issue here:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org\n\nThat is where all issues with the Chocolatey Website are recorded, this issues list is specifically for the Chocolatey Application.\n\nThanks\n. > Got it. Sorry about that!\n\nNot a problem at all :-)\n. @svnpenn what version of Chocolatey are you using?\n\nI have just tried what @ferventcoder suggested, but it is working for me.\n. Hmm, same here.\n\nThe test that I did was to run the `chocolateyInstall.ps1` file again for the fiddler4 package which I already had installed.  I wonder if it is something in your chocolateyInstall.ps1 file that is causing the issue.\n\nCan you share what you have in there?\n. Hmm, looks like the issue is here:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/helpers/functions/Get-ChocolateyUnzip.ps1#L49\n\nThis environment variable is only set when Chocolatey is run using:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/functions/Run-ChocolateyPS1.ps1#L28\n\nWhich I \"think\" we/you are circumventing doing things this way.  This certainly \"should\" work, but I think we need to take a look at this.\n\nFor now, you should be able to progress by first setting this environment variable to the required value, i.e. where you have the package install files, after you load the PowerShell module.\n\nHTH\n. @gutierri I am not really sure that I understand the reasoning, or what this would look like.\n\nAre you suggesting that if a maintainer is no longer able to keep a package up to date, that if someone else starts to maintain the package, the original maintainer isn't allowed to access them?\n\nThis really doesn't sound useful to me, and certainly not the spirit that Chocolatey was built on.\n\nYes, we are aware that package maintainers come and go, and some packages slip in terms of package versions, but that is inherent in the nature of community contributions.  Doing something like I think you are suggesting would, IMHO, make the situation worse.\n\nIf you are finding that packages are out of date, please feel free to follow the package triage process which is documented here:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/PackageTriageProcess\n. > Remove the permission of the developer, there Seems to be a good idea even.\n\nSorry, this is the part that I don't like.  Take as an example the following situation.\n\nA developer, let's call him Bob, creates a Chocolatey Package, and posts it to Chocolatey.org.  It gets moderated and approved, and people start using it.  It turns out to be a really popular package and lots of people use it.  From time to time, the original application creators release a new version of the application, and Bob updates the Chocolatey Package so that people can get the updates easily.  Then, Bob and his wife have a baby.  Bob doesn't have as much time as he used to, and as a result, the Chocolatey package starts to fall behind in the releases.  The people who are interested in the package start to email Bob and ask him to update the package.  Bob doesn't have time to answer the emails because he is holding a crying baby, and hasn't slept for 48 hours.\n\nOk, granted, this is a made up situation, but I don't think it is far from a potential situation that could happen.  It doesn't have to be a new baby, it could be a new job, moving house, starting a new hobby.  Lots of things could happen that would prevent a developer updating a Chocolatey package.  To then remove permission for that developer to do anything with the package would be the wrong approach in my opinion.\n\nRather, is another developer is interested in helping to maintain a package, they can follow the package Triage process, as defined above, and become a co-maintainer of the package.\n\nHope this makes sense!\n. @ferventcoder I just approved the php package yesterday. It worked fine for me?!?\n. While I see this bug, I am reminded about something else, which is semi-related :-)\n\nI noticed that the Install-ChocolateyShortcut.ps1 file isn't linked in this file either.  While fixing the first, can this be done also, or you want separate issue?\n. :+1: cool, I can take care of this one.  Hopefully get to it tonight.\n. This is the PR that you are referring to: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/278\n\nAnd this looks like exactly what we are going to need.  Although, in his PR he explicitly excludes the file that is being requested in this issue, i.e. UnInstall-ChocolateyZipPackage.\n\nAlso, this issue is a duplicate of https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/230\n\nThe PR targets the master branch, you happy for me to go ahead and pull it in, or how do you want to handle this?\n. Ah, gotcha...\n. Done, diddly, done.\n. This simply means that the package is in the moderation queue, and as a result, it will not be shown to search results.  I am looking at the package now, and if it fits all required criteria, it will be approved, otherwise, you will be asked to make changes, and re-published the same version of the package again, with changes.\n\nGary\n. @sindux Thanks for doing this, this was on my todo list.\n\nI will get this reviewed and hopefully pull in shortly.\n. Sorry, I am not sure that I follow what you mean...\n\nWhat are you expecting that the parameter `extractionPath` is used as the destination path when using the unzip chocolatey helper?\n\nGary\n. I am still unclear about what you are asking for...\n\nDoes this help:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/How-To-Parse-PackageParameters-Argument\n\nGary\n. > Would it be possible to create a function or something? I would like to use this for multiple packages. Is it possible to include this function in InstallChocolatey.ps1. What is your opinion regarding this?\n\nThere is nothing to stop you adding additional ps1 files to your packages, and simply dot sourcing them for use within your chocolateyInstall.ps1 file.  That way, you maintain your helper functions in one place, and use them across multiple packages.  If you think that these helper functions are generic enough, then by all means, submit them as a pull request, and we can look into whether it makes sense to include them within Chocolatey core.\n. > Closed as a solution has been found\n\nFor the benefit of others who might find this issue as the result of a search, could you share what you are now doing?\n\nGary\n. Thank you! :-)\n. > Closed as a solution has been found\n\nAgain, can you share what you are now doing? Thanks!\n. Thank you! :-)\n. I think that this might be a better location for this issue:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-package-updater\n\nWhen you move it there, can you provide some more details about the problem that you are having, with steps to reproduce?\n. @ferventcoder can you provide a link to where this is done in the source code?  I have heard @mwrock talk about this as well, but I have never hunted it out.\n. Thanks! :-)\n. @ferventcoder is this an issue with the Atom package, rather than with Chocolatey?  Or something that will be addressed in vNext?\n. > Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but could this have to do something with the recent force lowercasing the package IDs?\n\nI don't think so, or see how.  I have just done a choco update atom, which took my installation from 0.116.0 to 0.154.0 and the install worked fine.\n. > so if the installer chrashes... choco thinks it has already installed the latest version...\n\nThis is a side effect of the way chocolatey currently does the installation, something which is changing in vNext of Chocolatey.\n. @juliankrispel thanks for the offer of a contribution!  ChocolateyGUI would welcome any assistance you can provide as well :-)  https://github.com/chocolatey/ChocolateyGUI\n. Noice!  Of the two, I think I prefer the top one :-)\n\nWhat do you think @ferventcoder ?\n\nThe one thing I would say is that it does sort of remind me of the Commodore 64 logo.\n. I quite like this one:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1271146/5763915/40591510-9ce6-11e4-9404-787bf0654287.png)\n. Wow, these are really good!  Great work @juliankrispel Personally, I also like 8 a lot, but I keep coming back to normal 6 as well.  I really like the colours, although I appreciate they are completely different to what we have now :smile_cat: \n. > With the icon I'm a fan of no colon. 1b with white C is also quite interesting.\n\nAgreed, I like 1b because of the bevelled edge on the \"wrapper\" of the chocolate.  No colon gets my vote as well.\n. @ferventcoder I like the Jolly Roger Regular :+1: \n. @juliankrispel thanks for getting back to us about this, really appreciate it! :smile_cat: \n.

We can leave this issue open as a reminder to improve the documentation in this area.\n\nGary\n. @ahmedmohiduet in both the Command Window and PowerShell Window you will get a download progress indication, as shown here:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1271146/5592937/0479c5c0-91e3-11e4-8b39-4387ee505424.png)\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1271146/5592939/0bfa387a-91e3-11e4-9869-10ac792908eb.png)\n\nThese will disappear once the file download happens.  Anything after that is just the installation time.\n\nDoes that help?\n\nGary\n. In order for this to work, you would have to do the following:\n\n`choco install nodejs.install`\n\nClose and re-open your Command/PowerShell window\n\n`npm install -g grunt-cli`\n\n`npm install -g bower`\n\nThe important thing here is the closing of the shell to get the initial npm installs to work.\n\nHope that helps!\n\nGary\n. @aronovgj I think that this issue would be best added here:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-package-updater\n\nCan you please re-create the issue there, and I will close this issue.\n\nThanks\n. @aronovgj please accept my apologies, I was unaware of the history of this issue, and based on the wording, I believed it sounded like a ChocoPkgUp.exe issue, not a native Chocolatey one.\n. > Dont know if was session timeout or something, or if the group is moderated and the post will show up later? \n\nYes, the forums are moderated.  I don't see it in the queue for moderation though.  Hopefully it will turn up, and if/when it does, it will get approved.  Thanks for taking the time to explain this further.\n. @andulv I have just approved your Google Groups post :+1: \n. > Would it be possible to go for one of these pledges even though the Kickstarter is closed?\n\nSorry, I am going to have to leave that question for @ferventcoder.  I know that he is out just now, but he will definitely follow up with you.\n. > Definitely should stay with equals if possible.\n\nThis is my opinion as well, but wanted to understand the thought process that @glennsarti had before rolling back.\n. Thanks for getting back to me.\n\nI was almost convinced that I tested the code that I used before I posted it into the wiki, but sounds like there is an issue there.  Let me look at this again, and make sure it is correct.\n\nThanks for bringing to it our attention!\n. Hmm, looking again, look like Matt is using a : as the separator within his packages:\n\nhttps://chocolatey.org/packages/VisualStudio2013Ultimate\n\nI must have tried to change this to = and messed up the article.\n\nI will correct this.\n. > No problem. Also, should I be allowed to make changes to wiki like that, or should I be raising an issue first?\n\nThat would be for @ferventcoder to comment on for the official answer :smile_cat: \n\nIn my mind, editing the wiki should be allowed, crowd sourcing documentation has a lot of merit.  However, perhaps we might want to use a Pull Request model for this, rather than allowing editing directly, to ensure the changes are actually required/desired.\n. > perhaps. How does on PR wiki docs?\n\nBoo! I thought since the wiki is just a git repo under the hood that this would be possible, but looks like you have to fudge it!\n\nhttp://fusiongrokker.com/post/how-you-can-contribute-to-taffy-documentation\n. > Do we need a bin root? Or is it that choco is not doing a sufficient job in some cases?\n\nWith the changes that are coming in vNext, or at least, how I understand them, the need to Get-BinRoot should become non-existent, but that does raise the question about deprecating and updating the use of it.\n. Closing this, as it is a duplicate of https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/675\n. @dschinkel can you execute the following command:\n\n```\nchoco install filezilla -force -debug\n```\n\nAnd paste the output into a gist and link to it from here?\n\nAlso, what version of Windows are you on?  And what version of Chocolatey? Are you running from PowerShell or from Command Window?  And are you running either of these as an Administrator?\n. Chocolatey \"knows\" which packages are installed, based on what folders exist in the lib folder.  This is what is used as the \"index\" of installed packages.\n. Yes, that is intended.  See here:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org/issues/162\n\nFor more information.\n. @DarwinCSIWindowscom can I get you to re-create your issue here:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues\n\nThis is where all new work will be carried out.\n\nThanks!\n. Sorry to hear that you are having issues!\n\nCan you please try the answer to this StackOverflow question:\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/30720496/why-is-powershell-not-recognized-when-installing-chocolatey\n. Not sure where the MySQL command would be coming into play though?!?\n. @hifriend21 you will likely need to close and open the command window for the PATH change to take effect.  Did you do this?\n\nCan you output what is currently in your PATH variable here?\n. What happens if you try just `@powershell`\n. That was going to be my next question! :-)\n\nIf you hit the Windows key, and then search for powershell, does anything come up?\n. > @hifriend21 said...\n> Which is I can't even install the powershell.Thanks for helping, there is no other ways to get chocolatey, exept cmd?\n\nWhile there are other way's to do the install, none of them really matter.  Chocolatey, at the minute, has a direct dependency on PowerShell.  If you don't have that installed, then unfortunately, you won't be able to use Chocolatey.\n. ",

Yikes, this is showing all my commits. How do I squash them into one, but keep the branch? Or maybe that's a case of 'lying to source control' and should be avoided. Looks like you've got the [options](https://makandracards.com/makandra/527-squash-several-git-commits-into-a-single-commit) on your side.\n\nEDIT: I found the [diff view](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/43/files)! Nevermind about all that.\n. These latest commits add a better test for the `-packageName actually being a`packages.config`file. And`Chocolatey-PackagesConfig`calls`Chocolatey-Install`with the`-source` specified, so you can write a manifest like\n\n```\n<packages>\n    <package id=\"whatever\" />\n    <package id=\"whatever.x64\" version=\"0.1\" />\n    <package id=\"foobar\" version=\"0.1.87\" source=\"myget.com/apikey/myfeed\" />\n    <package id=\"somegem\" source=\"ruby\" />\n    <package id=\"somewebthing\" source=\"webpi\" />\n</packages>\n```\n. Chocolatey could always install a NuGet _package_ as part of installing itself. That way it's updateable.\n. This command does work and might be a work-around.\n\n```\nInstall-ChocolateyInstallPackage 'mypackage' 'EXE' '/S' ' file:///mylocalnetwork/gallery/myproduct.exe '\n```\n. Relevant comment from @ferventcoder on the discussion: \n\n> We could probably put some code in to make it work with files not coming over HTTP. In the meantime, Install-ChocolateyInstallPackage will work for things as long as the installer doesn't require being installed from a local drive. In those cases you could copy the installer to a temp directory and then call Install-ChocolateyInstallPackage. Would this work for you for now? \n. It doesn't seem to cause any problems. I've been able to use and develop with the latest Chocolatey since. I'm curious where it's coming from and what code is trying to read the current thread culture or import a module... unless it's unescaped documentation that's being executed.\n. I did a search through the ps1 files and I can't find CurrentUICulture in a string format anywhere. And the only `import-module` is in a comment.\n. Where's that NuGet.bat file stored and how does it get on the disk? I haven't had time to look through the repo. If you're doing the usual here-string to file routine, just edit the raw contents for the next release.\n\n```\n@\"@echo off\nbat file contents here \n\"@ | Out-File\n```\n. Will there be a nuget exe package? Or are there problems with that because of the way CodePlex deals with license agreements?\n. oh snap, I'm on it ;)\n. My package didn't end in `.config` it contained `.config.` in the _middle_. There must be some regex (or another matching technique) that can tell that a string _ends with_ `.config`.\n. There's a tradeoff with any solution. NuGet is being strict on the manifest file name (only `packages.config` is allowed) and getting a little flexibility in package names (may end in `.config`). We're being loose on the manifest name (must be a `.config` file) and losing a little flexibility in package naming (may not end in `.config`).\n\nThe `EndsWith` is ok, as long as we're clear in the documentation (btw, where is NuGet's docs on manifests?)\n. Here's a [shortcut function](https://github.com/AnthonyMastrean/Cookbook/blob/master/win.install/src/New-Shortcut.ps1) I've been using at work to automate all sorts of shortcuts. (updated, this link should stay put for a while)\n. And I'm confused by which nuget version is being used... my chocolatey batch files are pointing to \n\n```\n%chocolateyInstall%\\chocolateyInstall\\\n```\n\nBut, the nuget batch file is pointing to \n\n```\n%chocolateyInstall%\\lib\\chocolatey.0.9.8.13\\tools\\chocolateyInstall\n```\n\nSo, when I updated nuget\n\n```\ncmd> nuget update -self\n```\n\nIt updated the one in the lib and then when I use `cinst`, it uses the nuget in the chocolateyInstall directory!\n. Ok, this is getting weird. I have a different `ChocolateyInstall` value depending on the scope of the variable. I don't know where I got them all. I just re-installed Windows and downloaded my domain profile again. Maybe the bug is that the user/process variable gets set differently. I haven't actually dug into the code yet.\n\n```\nPS> [environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('ChocolateyInstall', 'Machine')\n(null)\n\nPS> [environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('ChocolateyInstall', 'User')\nC:\\Chocolatey\n\nPS> [environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('ChocolateyInstall', 'Process')\nC:\\Chocolatey\\bin\n```\n. Done, works ;)\n. I'm excited about this one, need it for some complicated packages that depend on the hg and 7zip command line packages first, to enable installing itself ([hggit](http://chocolatey.org/packages/hggit)).\n. I'm sooo waiting for this feature, it was working by accident for a while. One of my earliest packages was on an FTP server (prime95). I think the enhancements around the `CookieContainer` stuff started breaking it. Anyway, this pull request looks good.\n\nSomething to consider in general, the `HttpWebRequest` and `FtpWebRequest` method `Create` is actually defined on `WebRequest` and _can return any subtype_. So, I can put \"ftp://\" in `Get-WebFile` and it breaks mysteriously.\n. I just noticed that openwrap is using `o` on the command line... I bet chocolatey could take over as just `c`. It reads well, too...\n\n``` cmd\n> c install foo\n> c list foo\n```\n. Awesome, thanks for the quick fix.\n. If it's pressing and you want it on your personal machine, just download the patch and overwrite the file ;)\n. I'm all in for a font install helper. And I have no doubt that the one that @Iristyle found on the technet blog is the most enterprisey (safe for all edge cases, the most correct implementation, no pesky dialogs, etc). But, I'm always bothered by scripts that claim to do something in \"pure powershell\" and then inline a huge chunk of C#.\n- How do we know that chunk even compiles?\n- How do we put that chunk under test?\n- How high have we raised the bar to contribute to this feature?\n\nThoughts? Is it worth the risk? Does any other implementation satisfy the basic requirements with much less risk?\n. Is that different than the UninstallString solution? Maybe I misunderstood the uninstall technology/scenario and mislabeled this issue. I just wanted to promote Matt's effort out of a discussion and into an issue. It feels more legit ;)\n\nIf someone understands the problem better than I do, please edit!\n. More commentary here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/chocolatey/vqB0y22eWaQ\n. I can supply the patch if you agree it's broken :)\n. Can I use pester to mock the `7za` call?\n. OMG, it's that easy, huh? I guess powershell isn't treating native commands differently than cmdlets, it's interpreting everything and if it finds my mock first, I win, right?\n\nActually... am I able to mock a full file path? The script joins together everything down to the `.exe`.\n\n``` powershell\n$7zip = Join-Path \"$env:ChocolateyInstall\" 'chocolateyinstall\\tools\\7za.exe'\n```\n\nNevermind, I'm mocking `Start-Process` instead, got it ;)\n. I'll take care of that too ;)\n. Nah, life attacked and I haven't gotten around to it or a million other things I want to work on ;) I do remember my initial patch not working entirely (there's a lot of quoting/escaping going on in the line in question). But, this can be a good reminder to get on it.\n. Alright, tested again after updating Chocolatey and it still searches for these EXEs and creates EXE shims.\n. It's not my package yet, but I'm looking to take it over, which is why I am testing :)\n\nI updated the \"cleaned up\" statement in the description above. I'm trying to say that I was being thorough. I reverted to a 1.11-only state: Chocolatey lib, Control Panel, %TEMP%... all 1.11. No trace of 1.12.\n. The choco install command for a newer package is using the cached installer for the old package. Sorry, was that not clear?\n\n---\n\nI could test the same scenario with specific older versions of an existing, public package to remove any local source variability (though, I don't suspect that's part of the problem).\n. Chocolatey `install` is using the older package's cached installer even though Chocolatey finds a newer package (in this case, in my local `-source`). That's a bug. FYI, `update` works in this scenario and skips the installer cache.\n\nWhat's the intended behavior of `install` when you already have an older version of the package installed? I don't think it's reasonable to expect the user to list installed packages before choosing between `install` or `update`. It's not correct either way to use the old installer and then say the new version is successfully installed.\n. Not even close, 1.11 is about 5,664 KB and 1.12 is about 11,644 KB.\n. I'll try to repro it with a published package. But, you should still try it with a local package... I can send you my local pandoc 1.12 package for exact repro.\n. Haha, yeah, image URLs in Markdown are wild.\n. The tipper pays the fee. https://www.gittip.com/about/\n. @rismoney no scheming, this is about gratitude!\n. I've seen that same problem with the machine autorun and ansicon. That package is overly complicated. I'm working on a cleaner, more consistent install script and should probably focus on the uninstall script, as well.\n\nI would like to use the built-in install/uninstall switches, which purport to do all this work for you, but the maintainers have claimed that it doesn't always work (except, without any test cases).\n\nhttps://github.com/AnthonyMastrean/ChocoPackages-1/blob/b3885b6940ad35b3ef27ad08bb5d3c314fad9cc9/AnsiCon/tools/ChocolateyInstall.ps1\n. :christmas_tree: :gift:\n\nWhat I just pushed should be a lot more robust.

Yikes, this is showing all my commits. How do I squash them into one, but keep the branch? Or maybe that's a case of 'lying to source control' and should be avoided. Looks like you've got the [options](https://makandracards.com/makandra/527-squash-several-git-commits-into-a-single-commit) on your side.\n\nEDIT: I found the [diff view](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/43/files)! Nevermind about all that.\n. These latest commits add a better test for the `-packageName actually being a`packages.config`file. And`Chocolatey-PackagesConfig`calls`Chocolatey-Install`with the`-source` specified, so you can write a manifest like\n\n```\n<packages>\n    <package id=\"whatever\" />\n    <package id=\"whatever.x64\" version=\"0.1\" />\n    <package id=\"foobar\" version=\"0.1.87\" source=\"myget.com/apikey/myfeed\" />\n    <package id=\"somegem\" source=\"ruby\" />\n    <package id=\"somewebthing\" source=\"webpi\" />\n</packages>\n```\n. Chocolatey could always install a NuGet _package_ as part of installing itself. That way it's updateable.\n. This command does work and might be a work-around.\n\n```\nInstall-ChocolateyInstallPackage 'mypackage' 'EXE' '/S' ' file:///mylocalnetwork/gallery/myproduct.exe '\n```\n. Relevant comment from @ferventcoder on the discussion: \n\n> We could probably put some code in to make it work with files not coming over HTTP. In the meantime, Install-ChocolateyInstallPackage will work for things as long as the installer doesn't require being installed from a local drive. In those cases you could copy the installer to a temp directory and then call Install-ChocolateyInstallPackage. Would this work for you for now? \n. It doesn't seem to cause any problems. I've been able to use and develop with the latest Chocolatey since. I'm curious where it's coming from and what code is trying to read the current thread culture or import a module... unless it's unescaped documentation that's being executed.\n. I did a search through the ps1 files and I can't find CurrentUICulture in a string format anywhere. And the only `import-module` is in a comment.\n. Where's that NuGet.bat file stored and how does it get on the disk? I haven't had time to look through the repo. If you're doing the usual here-string to file routine, just edit the raw contents for the next release.\n\n```\n@\"@echo off\nbat file contents here \n\"@ | Out-File\n```\n. Will there be a nuget exe package? Or are there problems with that because of the way CodePlex deals with license agreements?\n. oh snap, I'm on it ;)\n. My package didn't end in `.config` it contained `.config.` in the _middle_. There must be some regex (or another matching technique) that can tell that a string _ends with_ `.config`.\n. There's a tradeoff with any solution. NuGet is being strict on the manifest file name (only `packages.config` is allowed) and getting a little flexibility in package names (may end in `.config`). We're being loose on the manifest name (must be a `.config` file) and losing a little flexibility in package naming (may not end in `.config`).\n\nThe `EndsWith` is ok, as long as we're clear in the documentation (btw, where is NuGet's docs on manifests?)\n. Here's a [shortcut function](https://github.com/AnthonyMastrean/Cookbook/blob/master/win.install/src/New-Shortcut.ps1) I've been using at work to automate all sorts of shortcuts. (updated, this link should stay put for a while)\n. And I'm confused by which nuget version is being used... my chocolatey batch files are pointing to \n\n```\n%chocolateyInstall%\\chocolateyInstall\\\n```\n\nBut, the nuget batch file is pointing to \n\n```\n%chocolateyInstall%\\lib\\chocolatey.0.9.8.13\\tools\\chocolateyInstall\n```\n\nSo, when I updated nuget\n\n```\ncmd> nuget update -self\n```\n\nIt updated the one in the lib and then when I use `cinst`, it uses the nuget in the chocolateyInstall directory!\n. Ok, this is getting weird. I have a different `ChocolateyInstall` value depending on the scope of the variable. I don't know where I got them all. I just re-installed Windows and downloaded my domain profile again. Maybe the bug is that the user/process variable gets set differently. I haven't actually dug into the code yet.\n\n```\nPS> [environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('ChocolateyInstall', 'Machine')\n(null)\n\nPS> [environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('ChocolateyInstall', 'User')\nC:\\Chocolatey\n\nPS> [environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('ChocolateyInstall', 'Process')\nC:\\Chocolatey\\bin\n```\n. Done, works ;)\n. I'm excited about this one, need it for some complicated packages that depend on the hg and 7zip command line packages first, to enable installing itself ([hggit](http://chocolatey.org/packages/hggit)).\n. I'm sooo waiting for this feature, it was working by accident for a while. One of my earliest packages was on an FTP server (prime95). I think the enhancements around the `CookieContainer` stuff started breaking it. Anyway, this pull request looks good.\n\nSomething to consider in general, the `HttpWebRequest` and `FtpWebRequest` method `Create` is actually defined on `WebRequest` and _can return any subtype_. So, I can put \"ftp://\" in `Get-WebFile` and it breaks mysteriously.\n. I just noticed that openwrap is using `o` on the command line... I bet chocolatey could take over as just `c`. It reads well, too...\n\n``` cmd\n> c install foo\n> c list foo\n```\n. Awesome, thanks for the quick fix.\n. If it's pressing and you want it on your personal machine, just download the patch and overwrite the file ;)\n. I'm all in for a font install helper. And I have no doubt that the one that @Iristyle found on the technet blog is the most enterprisey (safe for all edge cases, the most correct implementation, no pesky dialogs, etc). But, I'm always bothered by scripts that claim to do something in \"pure powershell\" and then inline a huge chunk of C#.\n- How do we know that chunk even compiles?\n- How do we put that chunk under test?\n- How high have we raised the bar to contribute to this feature?\n\nThoughts? Is it worth the risk? Does any other implementation satisfy the basic requirements with much less risk?\n. Is that different than the UninstallString solution? Maybe I misunderstood the uninstall technology/scenario and mislabeled this issue. I just wanted to promote Matt's effort out of a discussion and into an issue. It feels more legit ;)\n\nIf someone understands the problem better than I do, please edit!\n. More commentary here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/chocolatey/vqB0y22eWaQ\n. I can supply the patch if you agree it's broken :)\n. Can I use pester to mock the `7za` call?\n. OMG, it's that easy, huh? I guess powershell isn't treating native commands differently than cmdlets, it's interpreting everything and if it finds my mock first, I win, right?\n\nActually... am I able to mock a full file path? The script joins together everything down to the `.exe`.\n\n``` powershell\n$7zip = Join-Path \"$env:ChocolateyInstall\" 'chocolateyinstall\\tools\\7za.exe'\n```\n\nNevermind, I'm mocking `Start-Process` instead, got it ;)\n. I'll take care of that too ;)\n. Nah, life attacked and I haven't gotten around to it or a million other things I want to work on ;) I do remember my initial patch not working entirely (there's a lot of quoting/escaping going on in the line in question). But, this can be a good reminder to get on it.\n. Alright, tested again after updating Chocolatey and it still searches for these EXEs and creates EXE shims.\n. It's not my package yet, but I'm looking to take it over, which is why I am testing :)\n\nI updated the \"cleaned up\" statement in the description above. I'm trying to say that I was being thorough. I reverted to a 1.11-only state: Chocolatey lib, Control Panel, %TEMP%... all 1.11. No trace of 1.12.\n. The choco install command for a newer package is using the cached installer for the old package. Sorry, was that not clear?\n\n---\n\nI could test the same scenario with specific older versions of an existing, public package to remove any local source variability (though, I don't suspect that's part of the problem).\n. Chocolatey `install` is using the older package's cached installer even though Chocolatey finds a newer package (in this case, in my local `-source`). That's a bug. FYI, `update` works in this scenario and skips the installer cache.\n\nWhat's the intended behavior of `install` when you already have an older version of the package installed? I don't think it's reasonable to expect the user to list installed packages before choosing between `install` or `update`. It's not correct either way to use the old installer and then say the new version is successfully installed.\n. Not even close, 1.11 is about 5,664 KB and 1.12 is about 11,644 KB.\n. I'll try to repro it with a published package. But, you should still try it with a local package... I can send you my local pandoc 1.12 package for exact repro.\n. Haha, yeah, image URLs in Markdown are wild.\n. The tipper pays the fee. https://www.gittip.com/about/\n. @rismoney no scheming, this is about gratitude!\n. I've seen that same problem with the machine autorun and ansicon. That package is overly complicated. I'm working on a cleaner, more consistent install script and should probably focus on the uninstall script, as well.\n\nI would like to use the built-in install/uninstall switches, which purport to do all this work for you, but the maintainers have claimed that it doesn't always work (except, without any test cases).\n\nhttps://github.com/AnthonyMastrean/ChocoPackages-1/blob/b3885b6940ad35b3ef27ad08bb5d3c314fad9cc9/AnsiCon/tools/ChocolateyInstall.ps1\n. :christmas_tree: :gift:\n\nWhat I just pushed should be a lot more robust.

Much more friendly when dealing with redirects, custom headers, POST data, etc, etc.\n. http://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html\nAnything you could want to do, it can do... at least in my experience...\n\nMy example above was less about the download mechanism though, and more about grabbing 7z to use to unzip on Server Core though.  Other alternatives that I can think of\n- Download and use a 3rd party asm like SharpZipLib\n- Install PsCx (potentially with PsGet) and get access to some zip cmdlets like Read-Archive\n- Stash some code in embedded C# and compile on the fly in PowerShell\n\nObviously it's up to you, but I would vote for the lightest / simplest / fastest / most side effect-free way to get zip support.  7z fits the bill for me, but I own my servers and maybe there's another better general purpose way that works for everyone.\n. Also discussed [in the forum here](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/chocolatey/9Gk8dulfS6E).\n\nAnother newer option (for the sake of completeness) is [System.IO.Compression.ZipArchive](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.compression.ziparchive.aspx), but that's .NET 4.5 only.  Probably don't want that as a dependency.\n\nMy vote at this point is to ship the SharpZipLib ASM along with Chocolatey, as that will give the most bang for the buck in implementation cost.  It's probably the most robust, as 7zip does require the C++ runtime which might not be installed on target systems.  PsCx introduces a whole bunch of extra goop.\n\nFor reference -- here are the file sizes.\n- SharpZipLib 0.86.0.518 for .NET Fx 2.0+ is 196KB\n- DotNetZip (reduced.. whatever that is) 1.9 is 248KB\n\nI think the **ultimate best solution** is to just embed the C# parts of SharpZipLib needed to unzip files, but someone will have to rip through that code and make it part of Chocolatey.\n. A nice single file embed option looks to be [ZipStorer](http://zipstorer.codeplex.com/).  I don't know much about this one... but some of the comments seem to indicate that the goal is exactly the one we would have with Chocolatey -- swap out COM shell stuff with something simple and small in .NET.\n. The problem here is that Powershell does not \"recapture\" the environment variables once a session has been started.\n\nSo PATH could be modified, after running an installer, but Chocolatey cannot gain access to these without using the .NET System EnvironmentVariable APIs or manually accessing the **real** location in the registry -- i.e..\n\n``` powershell\n(Get-ItemProperty 'HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\Environment' -Name Path).Path\n```\n\nIMHO, what needs to be done is that the environment needs to be refreshed after a given installer wraps up.\n\nI would do a pull req, but not sure if this is the best / only spot where an installer finishes up.\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/helpers/functions/Install-ChocolateyPackage.ps1#L63\n\nTo recapture any changes made to PATH by external processes.\n\n``` powershell\n$Env:PATH = (@(,[Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('PATH', 'Machine') -s\nplit ';') + @([Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('PATH', 'User') -split ';') | Select -Unique) -join ';'\n```\n\nBTW - I was just coming to submit this issue based on Yeoman install failing on a machine without Ruby or Node initially installed.\n. So I have a couple of questions\n- Is this the most appropriate spot in the codebase to do the environment refresh?\n- Would it make sense to do a full environment refresh? (there may be other variables that these new tools need)\n- Are there are any potential perm issues?\n. That PoshCode snippet is craziness... let me (manually) see if it actually works ;0\n. I can think of 2 ways to do this.. not sure on security implications.\n- Iterate the registry to get all the environment variable names (it wouldn't simply be good enough to look at the names in the current session, because the list could have additions or removals)\n- Launch a new PS session, capture the environment variable state there, and push it back to the initiating session (probably on the slow side)\n. Ok -- just tried the PoshCode sample...\n- Started a session\n- Manually tweaked my PATH variables in control panel\n- Opened a new session -- verified changes are in new session\n- Verified changes are _not_ in old session\n- Ran crazy PoshCode\n\nOriginal session **does not** have the new PATH\n\nSo in short, no go.\n. So if you want to get the keys\n\n``` powershell\n#user\nGet-Item HKCU:\\Environment | Select -ExpandProperty Property\n\n#machine\nGet-Item 'HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\Environment' | Select -ExpandProperty Property\n```\n. Yeah, except how do you know what new_var is if an MSI just ran and added some new stuff? ;0\n. For cmd -- fun!\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/a/11147132/87793\n. I have used those reg tools before, but I cringe every time I see that old DOS batch style pattern matching stuff.  I think the cmd guys had Larry Wall aspirations.\n. I think the biggest issue then is the security considerations.  As long as I can get to HKLM, the Powershell refresh is pretty straightforward.\n. I also need to double check the rules for environment -- i.e. we know that PATH is special cased to munge Machine and User -- but not sure if any other variables are treated specially.\n\nI believe that User variables override Machine variables when the names overlap and there is no special casing like for PATH.  Will try a few tests here to be sure.\n. Verified - User overrides Machine.\n\nI gave PATHEXT a shot since it has a similar format to PATH.  When I defined a User variant, it totally ate the Machine variant.\n\nSo unless someone has a definitive resource somewhere about this -- I'm going to assume that only PATH has special treatment.\n. I just cooked this up and it works just fine -- no separate process or WMI necessary (I tend to avoid WMI because its just a wrapper on top of other stuff -- with the ability to fail due to DCOM issues, etc)\n\nThis is for Powershell only, not cmd.\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/3732568\n. I'm just about done with a pull req.. just trying to get the unit tests to run under your test suite properly.\n\nWill kick it off just so you guys can have a look, but don't pull it quite yet ;0\n. Also note that I may have the wrong spot for integration into Chocolatey.. I'll let you guys sort that part out if it's in the wrong spot.\n\nhttps://github.com/Iristyle/chocolatey/commit/8515ce2e2e4dd58de0a883e1bc304ec217aa50e6#L0R63\n. Roger that -- will fix.\n. Pull updated with tests that work properly now... \n. See https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/153\n. This is all ready to go... presuming the code is called in the right spot now.\n\nIf .\\build.bat is run as admin, the unit tests against MACHINE pass... but if not, those 2 tests will fail. (USER will pass)\n\nNot sure if you have any similar tests that require elevated privileges?  I know that you have a helper to run commands elevated.. maybe that's the best option?\n. Tried running tests with your *AsAdmin helper.. not so good for this use case.  So I guess you'll just have to live with failing tests when you're not admin.\n\nThe problem is not refresh from MACHINE -- that doesn't need elevation.. its that I can't write a new environment variable to MACHINE without admin, for the sake of the test.\n. Yeah, agree that modding users PS profile with an add to `Update-SessionEnvironment` is invasive, so I would rule that out.  Some people (like me) use customized prompts, and you would have the possibility of breaking those.\n\nWhy not just update how the cinst command is called, so that it calls `Update-SessionEnvironment` after the batch shell has finished up?\n\nI didn't realize that's how you guys were doing things, but if you're using the PS jobs api, you can just hook the event (if you're not already) for when the job finishes... at which point you can make the call to refresh the session vars.\n. It would be a little hacky, but you could have the variables export to a well known temp file location, for import back into cmd, no?  Maybe even pipe the output somewhere (not sure if that's feasible)\n\nThe only thing that makes me jump to `cmd` are some of the `dir` switches I grew up on\n\n`dir /s /od` \n\nA real verbose PITA in Powershell ;0\n. OT: But yeah, it's aliased to get-childitem ... where you have `-Recurse` and `-Filter` and `-Include`\n\nI don't know if they fixed that cmdlet is PS3, but `-Filter` is the faster option, b/c it passes the param to the underlying OS, but it's also busted for anything complex, so you have to do fancier things like `-Include 'foo*', 'bar*'` ... which can be horrendously slow on larger file sets due to implementation details.\n\nAnd obviously no way to pass all the switches like `/ad` -- equiv for `Get-ChildItem` is roughly `| ? { $_.PsIsContainer }`\n\nPITA\n. +1 on that.. if you can get it to work.\n\nAren't you guys passing a bunch of cmd line switches to powershell.exe (like -ExecutionPolicy).  Might run into some issues... I have my machine set to `Unrestricted`, so I wouldn't have any issues, but not sure about everyone else?\n. Best to follow PsGet conventions IMHO, so you can just \n\n`Import-Module Chocolatey`\n\nEach PSM1 uses `Export-ModuleMember` like [this](https://github.com/EastPoint/Midori/blob/master/tools/Jenkins.psm1)\n. Cool, then you're good to go... (as you can tell, I haven't looked at all the Chocolatey source ;0)\n\nMy point re: PsGet ... was along the install dir.  Sorry if that wasn't clear.  By plopping into the user module dir, then you should be able to just call `Import-Module Chocolatey` from anywhere... and the exported stuff will just work.\n\nIf you want to get super fancy (and I'm not at all serious here),  you can have a remote server running all the time, that can just export the commands to a Powershell WinRM session using a one-liner!  Have you ever seen how the Exchange cmdlets work?  \n\nhttp://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/hh750396.aspx\n\nI'm not an admin, but had to help show a co-worker once how to use PS -- first time I had encountered that stuff (the power of `Import-PSSession` that is).  Unfortunately, you can get cmdlets / modules from a remote server, but no way (directly) to push them -- which is why I made this coincidentally -- https://github.com/EastPoint/Midori/blob/master/tools/Remoting.psm1\n. Yeah... I'm not in disagreement with that.\n\nI'm just saying that it would be good to have a well-documented convention within Chocolatey where a function is called before the install as part of the Chocolatey Runtime.\n\ni.e.in `chocolateyInstall.ps1`\n\n``` powershell\nfunction CanInstall()\n{\n  #return true / false here\n}\n```\n\nThis way the logging, etc could be standardized, it could be documented in the wiki, etc.\n. I would say no... Chocolatey doesn't touch anything that wasn't installed by Chocolatey.\n\nIf ShouldInstall() returns false, maybe even flush any trace of the Chocolatey install attempt -- i.e. nothing in `c:\\chocolate\\lib`\n. My main issue with the 'taking over existing installs, etc' is the complexity with the concept.\n\nI generally agree that it's something that would be useful... \n\nI just wonder if it's going to be a real bear to implement properly (with lots of edge cases).  You might have to draw some lines in the sand as to what you will / will not cover, because I think there's a potential for a lot of landmines along the way (as there often is when dealing with Windows and installers!)\n\nBut if you're up to the challenge, then I'm OK with it! ;0\n. Not if the XSD was put together properly... and handles the X by using `<xs:any />` ;0  But most people forget about the X in XML.\n\nIn general, at one point I used to think schema validation was important -- not so much anymore (unless you care about making things go slower - haha).  \n. http://nuget.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/0624b2a0fb2a#src%2fCore%2fAuthoring%2fnuspec.xsd\n\nBoo.. no xs:any -- Don Box would be sad ;0\n. And yeah, I wasn't advocating messing with `projectUrl` either.  I just want a convenient way to get the original package source w/out having to do a ton of detective work.  \n\nIf I can go gallery package -> user -> repos that should be good enough for what I'm talking about.\n\nI still think it would be useful to have a repo for the source of the package a little more directly, but not at the expense of breaking nuget.exe.\n. You know, I'm thinking more and more that it would be good to have a direct link to where the package source lives... and even better to not even accept packages that don't have public source somewhere.\n\nRight now its a royal pain trying to hunt around to find the package source, for people like me, who run into issues with peoples packages and want to fix them.  I've done it at least a few times in the last couple of days, and I feel like I'm wasting time on a goose chase to try to find the sources every time.  Google authors name or handle .. hope they have a GitHub or Bitbucket account, cruise through their repos, etc.\n\nCase in point, I just tried to run the Powershell3 installer.  Of course, it bombed b/c the author didn't take into account the host OS version properly (Vista / Server 2008 are 6.0 and 7 / 2008 R2 are 6.1).  I can't find the source in this case, so I send off an email and hope I get a response... when I could have otherwise taken action.\n\nMy 2c -- this is a really poor feedback loop.\n. I setup something really similar at work.  I have an auto-publish scripts that runs on the build server.  The API key is stored only in the build server... \n\nThis script is kind of a universal one for packaging csproj/nuspec combos or just nuspec files for binaries.

Yeah, these types of apps generally need a runtime of some sort... the above apps are all built on Python.  Of course, substitute in Node or Ruby for Python -- I'm sure there are other similar apps out there.\n. I looked around, but didn't see anything... could've missed it though.  It was late ;0\n. FYI -- I sent Oliver a msg through Google+ [here](https://plus.google.com/108734949552133329827/about), to get the ball rolling on his approval... **IF** this is something Chocolatey agrees with doing ;0\n. FYI -- the software that I'm installing uses nested INI files.  This isn't officially allowed in an ini, but is common practice.  Get-IniContent / Out-IniFile doesn't handle this properly.  I'm fixing now...\n\nExample config\n\n``` ini\n[servers]\n[[serverA]]\nurl = blah.blah.com\n[[serverB]]\nurl = foo.bar.com\n```\n.

I'm going to incorporate these into https://github.com/EastPoint/Midori\n. I think that script could use a bit of a refactor... there's a lot of unnecessary futzing around with `;` \n\nJust `-split ';'` into an array, add to the array if the  `-contains` fails ... then `-join ';'`\n. Yes... failed to mention tab completion.  That is also a biggie IMHO.\n. http://trevorsullivan.net/2012/10/09/powershell-generating-functions-with-dynamic-parameter-auto-completion-values/\n. Yeah, I checked existing issues.. saw a few regarding uninstall -- but nothing about a helper that I saw initially.. but of course, **I could have missed it**.\n\nSometimes you can't just store the GUID though -- case in point -- I just pushed up HipChat, which is built on Air (which I also just pushed up).\n\nFishing out the GUID is a pretty wonky affair\nhttps://github.com/Iristyle/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/HipChat/tools/chocolateyUninstall.ps1\n\nNote that I'm using the `LocalPackage` reg value which is the location that the generated MSI is stored on disk (in `%SYSTEMROOT%\\Installer`)  There is another key called `UninstallString` that has the actual GUID.. but you would need to parse it.\n\nIn this case, it was simpler to `/x` on the path stored in `LocalPackage`, because no additional parsing was required.\n\nAIR is a bit of an edge case I think... but I don't know if there are other runtimes with similar behavior or not.\n. Also, in my example, keying off of SID `S-1-5-18` (local system) is not very robust (its a bit hacky actually)... but to be able to have AIR put HipChat into `Program Files`, I had to launch the AIR installer with `Start-ChocolateyProcessAsAdmin`\nhttps://github.com/Iristyle/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/HipChat/tools/chocolateyInstall.ps1#L29\n\nA better approach would be to scan all the `UserData` to find the right reg key... but I wanted to get something out the door quick ;0\n. I'm not sure what you mean by your question.. I did make an AIR runtime package.\nhttp://chocolatey.org/packages/AdobeAIR\n\nThere are 2 ways to ship Air as far as I can tell...\n- Embed the runtime (requires some signed legal stuff with Adobe)\n- Install the AIR runtime, use the tool from the runtime to install the `.air` file.\n\nFor HipChat, I opted for option 2.  The air runtime is a dependency of HipChat... and then the tool is used to install `hipchat.air`... as part of that install AIR seems to generate a bogus MSI, so that HipChat shows up in add/remove programs.\n. Not sure if your comment is directed to me @rismoney ?  The thing is, this isn't for an uninstall, I want to carry on with the install that got borked.\n\nHere's a real example of what happened this AM.. I told another dev to install [EPSDevTools.Web](chocolatey.org/packages/epsdevtools.web).  I wasn't there for all of this, so I'm kind of paraphrasing what happened:\n- He already has Sublime installed, and accidentally left it open.  So the Sublime installer died, killing the install of the main EPSDevTools.Web package.\n- OK, so now we're in this half installed state.  So try reinstalling with `-force`\n- NodeJS package was goofed up, so that kills us the next time.\n\nSo sometimes you get into this state of .. hmm... did all my dependencies properly install?  Maybe I should just start trashing the new folders out of `/lib` to kick Choc to reinstall missing bits because `-force`, AFAIK, won't execute the installer for dependent packages.. and there can be situations where the install of a dependency started, but couldn't proceed, so now it's in lib and Choc thinks its **installed**.\n\nSo then you say as a package maintainer... maybe I'm just better off calling `cinst` a bunch of times in my `chocolateyInstall.ps1` to work around this, instead of using the `dependencies` in the `nuspec`, because these unexpected things can happen.  But of course that kind of defeats the purpose.\n\nIMHO, this is one of the bigger pain points I've run into choc.  And don't get me wrong, I _love_ Chocolatey, I just think that the user experience here could use some polishing -- principal of least surprise and all that ;0\n\nSo -- maybe to improve on this situation:\n- Ensure that calling `-force` on a parent package, calls it down the hierarchy.  (I don't _think_ this is the current behavior, but obviously correct me if I've drawn the wrong conclusion)\n- When there are `dependencies` for a package, provide a summary at the end that lists success / fail status.  \n\nJust as a quick'n'dirty sample of what this could look like:\n\n```\nInstalled\n[\u2714] - nodejs.install\n[\u2714] - SourceCodePro\n\nFailed\n[\u2716] - SublimeText2.app\n```\n\nThe characters are taken from the [Mocha reporter](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/) -- unicode 2714 for succes and 2716 for fail,.  (These can have problems displaying based on the shell you're in under Windows unfortunately IIRC)\n- If a parent package has failed dependencies, maybe it's also best to do a delete of that package, so you don't need to do any sort of `-force`.  Same for any dependent packages.  If the heuristic for determining if something is installed, is the presence of the package on disk, then if something doesn't succeed, trash the folder.\n- A lot of times if there's a script attached to a package that has a bunch of dependencies, the script is dependent on those things being properly installed / available in `PATH`.  If they aren't, abort running `chocolateyInstall.ps1` for the parent package.\n\nThoughts?\n. Yeah, the `cuninst` approach sounds like it could be good as long as it:\n- Handles being called on **only** the last failed dependency\n- Handles being called up the chain / nested dependency hierarchy\n\nI'm thinking of situations where it's undesirable to run an uninstaller.  In the most extreme, consider Visual Studio was a dependency and took an hour to install.  You definitely don't want to uninstall it as part of a rollback if it was a later dependency in the list that exploded.\n\nAlso -- the docs should probably stress the scope of both `chocolateyInstall.ps1` / `chocolateyUninstall.ps1` and how it's important for them to be iidempotent.\n. Ok, so yeah.. thinking on this some more -- I don't think that `cuninst` is the right way to go.\n\nI think the best approach is to delete the last failed thing from `\\chocolatey\\lib` -- do not pass go, do not collect :moneybag:  If the package was a dependency of a parent package, also delete the parent from `lib`, and so on up the hierarchy.\n\nAlso, there's another contributing factor that is causing a bunch of confusion here.  A co-worker got through like 18 of 20 packages in the mentioned `EPSDevTools.Web`.  There was a temporary network hiccup grabbing Ruby, which killed the Ruby install and everything after that.\n\nFrom that experience, examining his console output and the `lib` directory, I noticed 3 major problems.\n- Chocolatey downloads all the nested dependencies up front.  This should be changed to downloading each on demand IMHO.  With all the packages downloaded to disk, even with a `-force`, chocolatey skips the failed dependencies (in this case Ruby, Vagrant and VirtualBox), because they're on disk.  So a real simple solution is not download until they're ready to be used.\n- So we deleted those 3 folders, and re-ran with a `-force`.  I thought this was supposed to cause the `chocolateyInstall.ps1` for `EPSDevTools.Web` to execute again.  It didn't.  So Ruby, Vagrant and VirtualBox installed, but the extra NPM packages and Gems from the install script did not.  The only way to work around this, was to delete the `EPSDevTools.Web` package from `lib`, then re-run the install.  It skipped all the dependencies as expected, but ran the script it was supposed to.\n- We're still having issues with not recapturing environment variables after `cinst` wraps up.  So clearly my previous work here wasn't enough to fix this.  So of course you end up in the shell dance... close, re-open, re-run, etc. because the current shell can't use the things that were just installed.\n. Haha -- stream of conciousness responses :smiley_cat: \n\nYeah, your **reasoning** works the same in both directions ultimately -- this is, in my mind, a _principle of least surprise_ kind of thing, and I think folks will have different options on it.  I can see both sides of the fence.\n\nI agree that as implemented, the default `explicit` is the best / safest tactic when you're talking about global dependencies... it can just be inconvenient at times because it causes a domino effect of updates for maintainers of packages.\n\nAs a convenience, a switch would def be useful when you're OK with playing fast and loose.\n. Checking for a font being installed might not be sufficient for a versioned font (like `SourceCode Pro` anyhow).  For that situation, I needed to upgrade an existing font in-place without showing dialogs, etc. (which boils down to remove / install)\n\nIt's much harder than it should be ;0\n\nYou have to resort to removing / re-installing in that case to prevent the Windows dialogs, a reboot, etc.  See my [install code](https://github.com/Iristyle/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/SourceCodePro/tools/chocolateyInstall.ps1#L23) for `SourceCode Pro`\n\nI took what was [published here](http://blogs.technet.com/b/deploymentguys/archive/2010/12/04/adding-and-removing-fonts-with-windows-powershell.aspx), and modded it a bit for my needs.\n\nIt lives in my repo as [FontHelpers.ps1](https://github.com/Iristyle/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/core/FontHelpers.ps1)\n. Also, SourceCodePro is OpenType (`.otf`), which is prefered over TrueType (`.ttf`), so any generic function should take that option into account, i.e.\n\n``` powershell\n[Parameter()]\n[ValidateSet('OpenType', 'TrueType')]\n[string]\n$Format = 'TrueType'\n```\n. Related to https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/171 but not quite the same idea\n. BITS works surprisingly well... except when you're over WinRM -- access denied due to security reasons, in case you were wondering.  You need to use WebClient in that case.\n\nOf course, one of the first things I do in my EC2 image bootstrapper scripts is install curl, so that I don't have to bother with either BITS or WebClient.  Much more friendly when dealing with redirects, custom headers, POST data, etc, etc.\n. http://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html\nAnything you could want to do, it can do... at least in my experience...\n\nMy example above was less about the download mechanism though, and more about grabbing 7z to use to unzip on Server Core though.  Other alternatives that I can think of\n- Download and use a 3rd party asm like SharpZipLib\n- Install PsCx (potentially with PsGet) and get access to some zip cmdlets like Read-Archive\n- Stash some code in embedded C# and compile on the fly in PowerShell\n\nObviously it's up to you, but I would vote for the lightest / simplest / fastest / most side effect-free way to get zip support.  7z fits the bill for me, but I own my servers and maybe there's another better general purpose way that works for everyone.\n. Also discussed [in the forum here](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/chocolatey/9Gk8dulfS6E).\n\nAnother newer option (for the sake of completeness) is [System.IO.Compression.ZipArchive](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.compression.ziparchive.aspx), but that's .NET 4.5 only.  Probably don't want that as a dependency.\n\nMy vote at this point is to ship the SharpZipLib ASM along with Chocolatey, as that will give the most bang for the buck in implementation cost.  It's probably the most robust, as 7zip does require the C++ runtime which might not be installed on target systems.  PsCx introduces a whole bunch of extra goop.\n\nFor reference -- here are the file sizes.\n- SharpZipLib 0.86.0.518 for .NET Fx 2.0+ is 196KB\n- DotNetZip (reduced.. whatever that is) 1.9 is 248KB\n\nI think the **ultimate best solution** is to just embed the C# parts of SharpZipLib needed to unzip files, but someone will have to rip through that code and make it part of Chocolatey.\n. A nice single file embed option looks to be [ZipStorer](http://zipstorer.codeplex.com/).  I don't know much about this one... but some of the comments seem to indicate that the goal is exactly the one we would have with Chocolatey -- swap out COM shell stuff with something simple and small in .NET.\n. The problem here is that Powershell does not \"recapture\" the environment variables once a session has been started.\n\nSo PATH could be modified, after running an installer, but Chocolatey cannot gain access to these without using the .NET System EnvironmentVariable APIs or manually accessing the **real** location in the registry -- i.e..\n\n``` powershell\n(Get-ItemProperty 'HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\Environment' -Name Path).Path\n```\n\nIMHO, what needs to be done is that the environment needs to be refreshed after a given installer wraps up.\n\nI would do a pull req, but not sure if this is the best / only spot where an installer finishes up.\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/helpers/functions/Install-ChocolateyPackage.ps1#L63\n\nTo recapture any changes made to PATH by external processes.\n\n``` powershell\n$Env:PATH = (@(,[Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('PATH', 'Machine') -s\nplit ';') + @([Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('PATH', 'User') -split ';') | Select -Unique) -join ';'\n```\n\nBTW - I was just coming to submit this issue based on Yeoman install failing on a machine without Ruby or Node initially installed.\n. So I have a couple of questions\n- Is this the most appropriate spot in the codebase to do the environment refresh?\n- Would it make sense to do a full environment refresh? (there may be other variables that these new tools need)\n- Are there are any potential perm issues?\n. That PoshCode snippet is craziness... let me (manually) see if it actually works ;0\n. I can think of 2 ways to do this.. not sure on security implications.\n- Iterate the registry to get all the environment variable names (it wouldn't simply be good enough to look at the names in the current session, because the list could have additions or removals)\n- Launch a new PS session, capture the environment variable state there, and push it back to the initiating session (probably on the slow side)\n. Ok -- just tried the PoshCode sample...\n- Started a session\n- Manually tweaked my PATH variables in control panel\n- Opened a new session -- verified changes are in new session\n- Verified changes are _not_ in old session\n- Ran crazy PoshCode\n\nOriginal session **does not** have the new PATH\n\nSo in short, no go.\n. So if you want to get the keys\n\n``` powershell\n#user\nGet-Item HKCU:\\Environment | Select -ExpandProperty Property\n\n#machine\nGet-Item 'HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\Environment' | Select -ExpandProperty Property\n```\n. Yeah, except how do you know what new_var is if an MSI just ran and added some new stuff? ;0\n. For cmd -- fun!\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/a/11147132/87793\n. I have used those reg tools before, but I cringe every time I see that old DOS batch style pattern matching stuff.  I think the cmd guys had Larry Wall aspirations.\n. I think the biggest issue then is the security considerations.  As long as I can get to HKLM, the Powershell refresh is pretty straightforward.\n. I also need to double check the rules for environment -- i.e. we know that PATH is special cased to munge Machine and User -- but not sure if any other variables are treated specially.\n\nI believe that User variables override Machine variables when the names overlap and there is no special casing like for PATH.  Will try a few tests here to be sure.\n. Verified - User overrides Machine.\n\nI gave PATHEXT a shot since it has a similar format to PATH.  When I defined a User variant, it totally ate the Machine variant.\n\nSo unless someone has a definitive resource somewhere about this -- I'm going to assume that only PATH has special treatment.\n. I just cooked this up and it works just fine -- no separate process or WMI necessary (I tend to avoid WMI because its just a wrapper on top of other stuff -- with the ability to fail due to DCOM issues, etc)\n\nThis is for Powershell only, not cmd.\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/3732568\n. I'm just about done with a pull req.. just trying to get the unit tests to run under your test suite properly.\n\nWill kick it off just so you guys can have a look, but don't pull it quite yet ;0\n. Also note that I may have the wrong spot for integration into Chocolatey.. I'll let you guys sort that part out if it's in the wrong spot.\n\nhttps://github.com/Iristyle/chocolatey/commit/8515ce2e2e4dd58de0a883e1bc304ec217aa50e6#L0R63\n. Roger that -- will fix.\n. Pull updated with tests that work properly now... \n. See https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/153\n. This is all ready to go... presuming the code is called in the right spot now.\n\nIf .\\build.bat is run as admin, the unit tests against MACHINE pass... but if not, those 2 tests will fail. (USER will pass)\n\nNot sure if you have any similar tests that require elevated privileges?  I know that you have a helper to run commands elevated.. maybe that's the best option?\n. Tried running tests with your *AsAdmin helper.. not so good for this use case.  So I guess you'll just have to live with failing tests when you're not admin.\n\nThe problem is not refresh from MACHINE -- that doesn't need elevation.. its that I can't write a new environment variable to MACHINE without admin, for the sake of the test.\n. Yeah, agree that modding users PS profile with an add to `Update-SessionEnvironment` is invasive, so I would rule that out.  Some people (like me) use customized prompts, and you would have the possibility of breaking those.\n\nWhy not just update how the cinst command is called, so that it calls `Update-SessionEnvironment` after the batch shell has finished up?\n\nI didn't realize that's how you guys were doing things, but if you're using the PS jobs api, you can just hook the event (if you're not already) for when the job finishes... at which point you can make the call to refresh the session vars.\n. It would be a little hacky, but you could have the variables export to a well known temp file location, for import back into cmd, no?  Maybe even pipe the output somewhere (not sure if that's feasible)\n\nThe only thing that makes me jump to `cmd` are some of the `dir` switches I grew up on\n\n`dir /s /od` \n\nA real verbose PITA in Powershell ;0\n. OT: But yeah, it's aliased to get-childitem ... where you have `-Recurse` and `-Filter` and `-Include`\n\nI don't know if they fixed that cmdlet is PS3, but `-Filter` is the faster option, b/c it passes the param to the underlying OS, but it's also busted for anything complex, so you have to do fancier things like `-Include 'foo*', 'bar*'` ... which can be horrendously slow on larger file sets due to implementation details.\n\nAnd obviously no way to pass all the switches like `/ad` -- equiv for `Get-ChildItem` is roughly `| ? { $_.PsIsContainer }`\n\nPITA\n. +1 on that.. if you can get it to work.\n\nAren't you guys passing a bunch of cmd line switches to powershell.exe (like -ExecutionPolicy).  Might run into some issues... I have my machine set to `Unrestricted`, so I wouldn't have any issues, but not sure about everyone else?\n. Best to follow PsGet conventions IMHO, so you can just \n\n`Import-Module Chocolatey`\n\nEach PSM1 uses `Export-ModuleMember` like [this](https://github.com/EastPoint/Midori/blob/master/tools/Jenkins.psm1)\n. Cool, then you're good to go... (as you can tell, I haven't looked at all the Chocolatey source ;0)\n\nMy point re: PsGet ... was along the install dir.  Sorry if that wasn't clear.  By plopping into the user module dir, then you should be able to just call `Import-Module Chocolatey` from anywhere... and the exported stuff will just work.\n\nIf you want to get super fancy (and I'm not at all serious here),  you can have a remote server running all the time, that can just export the commands to a Powershell WinRM session using a one-liner!  Have you ever seen how the Exchange cmdlets work?  \n\nhttp://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/hh750396.aspx\n\nI'm not an admin, but had to help show a co-worker once how to use PS -- first time I had encountered that stuff (the power of `Import-PSSession` that is).  Unfortunately, you can get cmdlets / modules from a remote server, but no way (directly) to push them -- which is why I made this coincidentally -- https://github.com/EastPoint/Midori/blob/master/tools/Remoting.psm1\n. Yeah... I'm not in disagreement with that.\n\nI'm just saying that it would be good to have a well-documented convention within Chocolatey where a function is called before the install as part of the Chocolatey Runtime.\n\ni.e.in `chocolateyInstall.ps1`\n\n``` powershell\nfunction CanInstall()\n{\n  #return true / false here\n}\n```\n\nThis way the logging, etc could be standardized, it could be documented in the wiki, etc.\n. I would say no... Chocolatey doesn't touch anything that wasn't installed by Chocolatey.\n\nIf ShouldInstall() returns false, maybe even flush any trace of the Chocolatey install attempt -- i.e. nothing in `c:\\chocolate\\lib`\n. My main issue with the 'taking over existing installs, etc' is the complexity with the concept.\n\nI generally agree that it's something that would be useful... \n\nI just wonder if it's going to be a real bear to implement properly (with lots of edge cases).  You might have to draw some lines in the sand as to what you will / will not cover, because I think there's a potential for a lot of landmines along the way (as there often is when dealing with Windows and installers!)\n\nBut if you're up to the challenge, then I'm OK with it! ;0\n. Not if the XSD was put together properly... and handles the X by using `<xs:any />` ;0  But most people forget about the X in XML.\n\nIn general, at one point I used to think schema validation was important -- not so much anymore (unless you care about making things go slower - haha).  \n. http://nuget.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/0624b2a0fb2a#src%2fCore%2fAuthoring%2fnuspec.xsd\n\nBoo.. no xs:any -- Don Box would be sad ;0\n. And yeah, I wasn't advocating messing with `projectUrl` either.  I just want a convenient way to get the original package source w/out having to do a ton of detective work.  \n\nIf I can go gallery package -> user -> repos that should be good enough for what I'm talking about.\n\nI still think it would be useful to have a repo for the source of the package a little more directly, but not at the expense of breaking nuget.exe.\n. You know, I'm thinking more and more that it would be good to have a direct link to where the package source lives... and even better to not even accept packages that don't have public source somewhere.\n\nRight now its a royal pain trying to hunt around to find the package source, for people like me, who run into issues with peoples packages and want to fix them.  I've done it at least a few times in the last couple of days, and I feel like I'm wasting time on a goose chase to try to find the sources every time.  Google authors name or handle .. hope they have a GitHub or Bitbucket account, cruise through their repos, etc.\n\nCase in point, I just tried to run the Powershell3 installer.  Of course, it bombed b/c the author didn't take into account the host OS version properly (Vista / Server 2008 are 6.0 and 7 / 2008 R2 are 6.1).  I can't find the source in this case, so I send off an email and hope I get a response... when I could have otherwise taken action.\n\nMy 2c -- this is a really poor feedback loop.\n. I setup something really similar at work.  I have an auto-publish scripts that runs on the build server.  The API key is stored only in the build server... \n\nThis script is kind of a universal one for packaging csproj/nuspec combos or just nuspec files for binaries.

Yeah, these types of apps generally need a runtime of some sort... the above apps are all built on Python.  Of course, substitute in Node or Ruby for Python -- I'm sure there are other similar apps out there.\n. I looked around, but didn't see anything... could've missed it though.  It was late ;0\n. FYI -- I sent Oliver a msg through Google+ [here](https://plus.google.com/108734949552133329827/about), to get the ball rolling on his approval... **IF** this is something Chocolatey agrees with doing ;0\n. FYI -- the software that I'm installing uses nested INI files.  This isn't officially allowed in an ini, but is common practice.  Get-IniContent / Out-IniFile doesn't handle this properly.  I'm fixing now...\n\nExample config\n\n``` ini\n[servers]\n[[serverA]]\nurl = blah.blah.com\n[[serverB]]\nurl = foo.bar.com\n```\n.

I'm going to incorporate these into https://github.com/EastPoint/Midori\n. I think that script could use a bit of a refactor... there's a lot of unnecessary futzing around with `;` \n\nJust `-split ';'` into an array, add to the array if the  `-contains` fails ... then `-join ';'`\n. Yes... failed to mention tab completion.  That is also a biggie IMHO.\n. http://trevorsullivan.net/2012/10/09/powershell-generating-functions-with-dynamic-parameter-auto-completion-values/\n. Yeah, I checked existing issues.. saw a few regarding uninstall -- but nothing about a helper that I saw initially.. but of course, **I could have missed it**.\n\nSometimes you can't just store the GUID though -- case in point -- I just pushed up HipChat, which is built on Air (which I also just pushed up).\n\nFishing out the GUID is a pretty wonky affair\nhttps://github.com/Iristyle/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/HipChat/tools/chocolateyUninstall.ps1\n\nNote that I'm using the `LocalPackage` reg value which is the location that the generated MSI is stored on disk (in `%SYSTEMROOT%\\Installer`)  There is another key called `UninstallString` that has the actual GUID.. but you would need to parse it.\n\nIn this case, it was simpler to `/x` on the path stored in `LocalPackage`, because no additional parsing was required.\n\nAIR is a bit of an edge case I think... but I don't know if there are other runtimes with similar behavior or not.\n. Also, in my example, keying off of SID `S-1-5-18` (local system) is not very robust (its a bit hacky actually)... but to be able to have AIR put HipChat into `Program Files`, I had to launch the AIR installer with `Start-ChocolateyProcessAsAdmin`\nhttps://github.com/Iristyle/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/HipChat/tools/chocolateyInstall.ps1#L29\n\nA better approach would be to scan all the `UserData` to find the right reg key... but I wanted to get something out the door quick ;0\n. I'm not sure what you mean by your question.. I did make an AIR runtime package.\nhttp://chocolatey.org/packages/AdobeAIR\n\nThere are 2 ways to ship Air as far as I can tell...\n- Embed the runtime (requires some signed legal stuff with Adobe)\n- Install the AIR runtime, use the tool from the runtime to install the `.air` file.\n\nFor HipChat, I opted for option 2.  The air runtime is a dependency of HipChat... and then the tool is used to install `hipchat.air`... as part of that install AIR seems to generate a bogus MSI, so that HipChat shows up in add/remove programs.\n. Not sure if your comment is directed to me @rismoney ?  The thing is, this isn't for an uninstall, I want to carry on with the install that got borked.\n\nHere's a real example of what happened this AM.. I told another dev to install [EPSDevTools.Web](chocolatey.org/packages/epsdevtools.web).  I wasn't there for all of this, so I'm kind of paraphrasing what happened:\n- He already has Sublime installed, and accidentally left it open.  So the Sublime installer died, killing the install of the main EPSDevTools.Web package.\n- OK, so now we're in this half installed state.  So try reinstalling with `-force`\n- NodeJS package was goofed up, so that kills us the next time.\n\nSo sometimes you get into this state of .. hmm... did all my dependencies properly install?  Maybe I should just start trashing the new folders out of `/lib` to kick Choc to reinstall missing bits because `-force`, AFAIK, won't execute the installer for dependent packages.. and there can be situations where the install of a dependency started, but couldn't proceed, so now it's in lib and Choc thinks its **installed**.\n\nSo then you say as a package maintainer... maybe I'm just better off calling `cinst` a bunch of times in my `chocolateyInstall.ps1` to work around this, instead of using the `dependencies` in the `nuspec`, because these unexpected things can happen.  But of course that kind of defeats the purpose.\n\nIMHO, this is one of the bigger pain points I've run into choc.  And don't get me wrong, I _love_ Chocolatey, I just think that the user experience here could use some polishing -- principal of least surprise and all that ;0\n\nSo -- maybe to improve on this situation:\n- Ensure that calling `-force` on a parent package, calls it down the hierarchy.  (I don't _think_ this is the current behavior, but obviously correct me if I've drawn the wrong conclusion)\n- When there are `dependencies` for a package, provide a summary at the end that lists success / fail status.  \n\nJust as a quick'n'dirty sample of what this could look like:\n\n```\nInstalled\n[\u2714] - nodejs.install\n[\u2714] - SourceCodePro\n\nFailed\n[\u2716] - SublimeText2.app\n```\n\nThe characters are taken from the [Mocha reporter](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/) -- unicode 2714 for succes and 2716 for fail,.  (These can have problems displaying based on the shell you're in under Windows unfortunately IIRC)\n- If a parent package has failed dependencies, maybe it's also best to do a delete of that package, so you don't need to do any sort of `-force`.  Same for any dependent packages.  If the heuristic for determining if something is installed, is the presence of the package on disk, then if something doesn't succeed, trash the folder.\n- A lot of times if there's a script attached to a package that has a bunch of dependencies, the script is dependent on those things being properly installed / available in `PATH`.  If they aren't, abort running `chocolateyInstall.ps1` for the parent package.\n\nThoughts?\n. Yeah, the `cuninst` approach sounds like it could be good as long as it:\n- Handles being called on **only** the last failed dependency\n- Handles being called up the chain / nested dependency hierarchy\n\nI'm thinking of situations where it's undesirable to run an uninstaller.  In the most extreme, consider Visual Studio was a dependency and took an hour to install.  You definitely don't want to uninstall it as part of a rollback if it was a later dependency in the list that exploded.\n\nAlso -- the docs should probably stress the scope of both `chocolateyInstall.ps1` / `chocolateyUninstall.ps1` and how it's important for them to be iidempotent.\n. Ok, so yeah.. thinking on this some more -- I don't think that `cuninst` is the right way to go.\n\nI think the best approach is to delete the last failed thing from `\\chocolatey\\lib` -- do not pass go, do not collect :moneybag:  If the package was a dependency of a parent package, also delete the parent from `lib`, and so on up the hierarchy.\n\nAlso, there's another contributing factor that is causing a bunch of confusion here.  A co-worker got through like 18 of 20 packages in the mentioned `EPSDevTools.Web`.  There was a temporary network hiccup grabbing Ruby, which killed the Ruby install and everything after that.\n\nFrom that experience, examining his console output and the `lib` directory, I noticed 3 major problems.\n- Chocolatey downloads all the nested dependencies up front.  This should be changed to downloading each on demand IMHO.  With all the packages downloaded to disk, even with a `-force`, chocolatey skips the failed dependencies (in this case Ruby, Vagrant and VirtualBox), because they're on disk.  So a real simple solution is not download until they're ready to be used.\n- So we deleted those 3 folders, and re-ran with a `-force`.  I thought this was supposed to cause the `chocolateyInstall.ps1` for `EPSDevTools.Web` to execute again.  It didn't.  So Ruby, Vagrant and VirtualBox installed, but the extra NPM packages and Gems from the install script did not.  The only way to work around this, was to delete the `EPSDevTools.Web` package from `lib`, then re-run the install.  It skipped all the dependencies as expected, but ran the script it was supposed to.\n- We're still having issues with not recapturing environment variables after `cinst` wraps up.  So clearly my previous work here wasn't enough to fix this.  So of course you end up in the shell dance... close, re-open, re-run, etc. because the current shell can't use the things that were just installed.\n. Haha -- stream of conciousness responses :smiley_cat: \n\nYeah, your **reasoning** works the same in both directions ultimately -- this is, in my mind, a _principle of least surprise_ kind of thing, and I think folks will have different options on it.  I can see both sides of the fence.\n\nI agree that as implemented, the default `explicit` is the best / safest tactic when you're talking about global dependencies... it can just be inconvenient at times because it causes a domino effect of updates for maintainers of packages.\n\nAs a convenience, a switch would def be useful when you're OK with playing fast and loose.\n. Checking for a font being installed might not be sufficient for a versioned font (like `SourceCode Pro` anyhow).  For that situation, I needed to upgrade an existing font in-place without showing dialogs, etc. (which boils down to remove / install)\n\nIt's much harder than it should be ;0\n\nYou have to resort to removing / re-installing in that case to prevent the Windows dialogs, a reboot, etc.  See my [install code](https://github.com/Iristyle/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/SourceCodePro/tools/chocolateyInstall.ps1#L23) for `SourceCode Pro`\n\nI took what was [published here](http://blogs.technet.com/b/deploymentguys/archive/2010/12/04/adding-and-removing-fonts-with-windows-powershell.aspx), and modded it a bit for my needs.\n\nIt lives in my repo as [FontHelpers.ps1](https://github.com/Iristyle/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/core/FontHelpers.ps1)\n. Also, SourceCodePro is OpenType (`.otf`), which is prefered over TrueType (`.ttf`), so any generic function should take that option into account, i.e.\n\n``` powershell\n[Parameter()]\n[ValidateSet('OpenType', 'TrueType')]\n[string]\n$Format = 'TrueType'\n```\n.

I think rob and @Iristyle were looking at his yesterday and found that it did not work. I ran into this issue a couple weeks ago and also tried this without luck. Not sure if thats because powershell.exe does not subscribe to the broadcasts.\n\nI did find however that this:\n\n```\n$paths=(Get-WmiObject Win32_Environment | where-object -filter {$_.Name -eq 'path'})\nforeach($path in $paths) {$newPath += $path.VariableValue}\nWrite-Host $newPath\n```\n\ndoes work. It was mentioned though that \"Path\" may not be enough. There could be other variables that other programs might expect (like JAVA_HOME). Also, this needs to be batch file compliant as well. I believe @Iristyle was going to implement something that would work for both ps and dos. See the Issue #153 for the details of the discussion.\n. This is still an open issue. The above pull request only fixes Chocolatey's ability to refresh its own view but does not refresh the view of the user session. Need to add some bath flavored means of refreshing a normal command line. Also need to provide a means of refreshing PS users most likely via their $Profile.\n. I have been doing alot of experimentation lately around remoting and chocolate. My next boxstarter release will support this and auto configure the remoting client as well as the target as long as the wmi ports are open.\n\nmost packages will work fine using vanilla remoting but there are some tricky edge cases. One is the double hop scenario mentioned above. The solution there is using credssp. This will solve issues around accessing shares that require your auth token.\n\nthe stikiest issue is around windows update. Alot of Ms installs interact with the win update service. Examples are the .net frameworks, ie10, webpi and probably plenty others. Win update will not honor a remote token. The only reliable solution I have found is using scheduled tasks. I create a scheduled task for the choco pkg and forward the output and error streams to a file. I launch the task and use a file stream to stream to the console. Its more painful than I thought it would be.\n\none other case that simply won't work is most packages that use autoit or anything that interacts with a window.\n\nnot sure why there would be issues with enter-possession but I almost always use invoke-command. \n. I guess if we could get one or two users to validate or contribute who have access to an authenticating proxy, that would be good.\n\n---\n\n From: \"Rob Reynolds\" notifications@github.com\nSent: Thursday, April 18, 2013 9:23 PM\nTo: \"chocolatey/chocolatey\" chocolatey@noreply.github.com\nSubject: Re: [chocolatey] Add support for authenticating proxies to installation script (#139)\n\nI also have one in email from someone on this as well. -\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. ugh. that did not go as planned. I'll close and send another.\n. Gonna re clone to get rid of the other commits and resend to develop branch.\n. Squashed the commits and fixed tests. Merged in 1856c76b0b8db290d72b1305ddf9c673fbc30416\n. squashed commits into fa133db415c246d3e35110a796d88c33d56b611c\n. I think adding a uninstall for these makes sense. I'll add that.\n\nI do think that adding multiple features would be handy and should be faster since fewer round trips would be incurred. I didn't add it since it did not seem to mesh with the current chocolatey model of having a single package for each cinst. However, rather than making a special case for this feed, what would you think of adding the ability for any chocolatey feed (or atleast this one and chocolatey nuget) to accept an array of packages. That might be a nice overall enhancement. The challenge is that the normal CommandLine does not have an understanding of arrays but we might be able to change the .bat file generator to convert comma delimited arguments to arrays.\n. Took a look at adding uninstall. While it looks pretty trivial for this feed. It seems like the current codebase is in need of a more pluggable pattern. Right now, each feed have dedicated scripts for install, webpi and winfeatures have inline conditionals for lists and uninstall only supports nuget.\n\nI'd propose that each feed have their own dedicated script(s) for all functions and the Chocolatey-XXX function becomes a factory or just provides obviously common logic. There are a number of patterns that can be implemented. One suggestion:\n- A provider, say webpi, has a entry script WePi-Provider.ps1\n- Chocolatey exposes functions like Install-Strategy ([scriptblock] $InstallScript){ $InstallerRegistry[$source] = $installScript}\n- $chocolatey exposes a $ChocolateyArgs that the plugin script can access ala $ChocolateyArgs.PackageName\n- Chocolatey dot sources all the plugins when the module loads\n- Chocolatey invokes the appropriate script when user invokes Chocolatey-XXX.\n\nThis is very rough and hardly baked but you get the idea. I'll post this on the forum and push this feed as is. Then we can create issues for plugins if we think this makes sense and also add another issue for supporting multiple packages.\n. I think this might work. Assuming new_var is the environment variable set.\n\nGet-WmiObject Win32_Environment | where-object -filter {$_.Name -eq 'new_var'} | select VariableValue\n. Yup. You would have to build a list before the install and then do a delta.\n. I played with some ideas today and I think I found a way to make this work for all env vars in ps and cmd with little batch ugliness. The gist of it is this. I'd have a Refresh-Environment.ps1 and RefreshEnvironment.bat. The ps1 would do something like:\n\n```\n$newVars=(powershell -outputformat xml -command \"Get-WmiObject Win32_Environment | select Name, VariableValue\")\n```\n\nWhat I foud is that you have to either use WMI or go directly to the registry and from a different process. Then it would use the xml api to build a PS dictionary of the environment variables that propperly resolves the system and user variables and does spacial handling on the path via concatenation. Finally it iterates the dictionary and flushes it to the env:\\ drive. Then it outputs \n\n```\ngci env:\n```\n\nto standard output. \n\nThe bat calls the ps1 and flushes it to a file via >> and uses the\n\n```\nFOR /F \"tokens=2,3* delims= \" %%i in (vars.txt) do SET %i=%j\n```\n\nBased on some prototype tests, I think this works. I plan to extract this into a separate chocolatey/repo since I think it has usage scenarios outside of chocolatey. The snippits above might not be syntactically perfect but hopefully you get the idea. Hopefully I can get to this before the end of the weekend. Thoughts?\n. Very nice. Plugged that into my test simulator and it works. I think adding the batch compatibility should be straight forward by having this output the new vars to std out and then having a .bat call that and taking the FOR strategy I mentioned above.\n. Yeah I think this should probably go into Chocolatey-Nuget instead of Install-ChocolateyInstallPackage so it can be applied to all install scenarios.\n. Great job! I'll add in the batch file version later unless someone else beats me too it.\n. I'm closing this since it was essentially fixed with fd8b079c54eb8719f2e8cff4801a8ca363fdd695. That should allow chocolatey (but not the caller) to use paths set by installers. There is another issue for the caller: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/134 \n. The nice thing about the holding cell is that should solve the scenario where after an error occurs, chocolatey thinks that the package is installed.\n. right. Do you think the expectation though is that if a package fails to install calling cinst without -force should not state that the package has already been installed? That was always mine and getting that message feels wrong. If the holding cell is deleted after a failure and nothing goes to lib in the end, then that should solve the issue.\n. That's a good point on the uninstall. I was actually thinking that it just get deleted but your idea is much better.\n. So I've been playing around with this (related to Issue #153 and issue #134). Cleaning up the tests and integration and should have it in a mergeable state tonight. I think this will address scenarios where you are installing a string of packages via normal dependencies or a package config and one ChocolateyInstall may need the new variables defined or modified by a previous install.\n\nUnfortunately I don't think it will have much of an impact on the scenario where the user's shell would like to use the refreshed vars. I had hoped and (incorerrectly I think) assumed that this PR as is would allow someone using chocolatey via PS to have their current shell inherrit all updated env vars and adding a small bit of batch script goodness would expand this to normal command line shells as well. The challenge is that even if you are accessing chocolatey via PS (which I imagine most do), if you use the cinst flavored shortcut commands or even the longer Chocolatey-Install commands, you stil go through a batch shell. This means that when chocolatey calls ths Update-SessionVariables function, the env: affected is a different shell than the one that the user is in. Of course the user can invoke the function on their own and that will update their shell bt it is something they will have to do on their own. Even adding batch script compliance to this will not fix that since again, that is a different shell. That would address users who call chocolatey in a normal command line shell, but is that a typical use case? To me using the batch shell as a day to day shell is like using Windows in Safe Mode which is not a good experience.\n\nOne way to get this to possibly get this to work but i  think is unacceptable would be to add a line to the user's $profile that modifies their prompt(). This might call any existing prompt, refresh the variables and then erase itself. This fels fragile and maybe even invasive.\n. I think getting the vars working on Rob's favorite shell is very possible. But no matter how you change cinst or anything else in the batch goo to get the vars to play nice with the normal command line, it wont work for the user calling cinst from powershell because once yoy are in cinst, you are in a different shell and it cant reach back into the user's PS session.\n. Hey. That's a good idea. Create a example-profile that also gets dot sourced into ones profile and alias all the commands.\n. I think most that work in PS have that set already since its fairly useless otherwise. \n. OK. Pulled this in. Regarding the issue of failing tests when not running as admin. I changed the test to check if the user is admin and if not, the test is essentially skipped. I am going to change the Test msbuild target to elevate privileges. This way, running as a non admin user using just \"Pester\" will skip the test, but when the tests run as a build via ./build, the permisions will elevate and the tests will run.\n\nI will also crete a separate issue for adding the batch style refresh and another the profile stuff discussed above.\n. Issue #134 is the placeholder for this I think. I just added a note to this for clarification.\n\n---\n\n From: \"Rob Reynolds\" notifications@github.com\nSent: Wednesday, October 31, 2012 11:43 PM\nTo: \"chocolatey/chocolatey\" chocolatey@noreply.github.com\nSubject: Re: [chocolatey] [Enhancement] Refresh env vars after Install (#158)\n\n@mwrock Did those separate issues get created?   -\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Seems like it would be tricky for choco to know if software has been installed on its own outside of choc. However the package owner who has more knowledge about the dependencies could check in chocolateyinstall. Similar to the .net 4.5 installer. It checks for the presence of 4.5 in the registry and then just returns success and does nothing more if it is.\n. Yeah this is a bit of an odd case. Im working on a chocolatey bootstrapper and one of the first things that it does is call this script to install chocolatey. The bootstrapper is using alot of the functionality in the alpha. So the bootstrapping snippet looks like this:\n\n```\nif(-not $env:ChocolateyInstall -or -not (Test-Path \"$env:ChocolateyInstall\")){\n    $env:ChocolateyInstall = \"$env:systemdrive\\chocolatey\"\n    New-Item $env:ChocolateyInstall -Force -type directory\n    $url=Config.ChocolateyPackage \n    iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('Config.ChocolateyRepo'))\n    Enable-Net40\n}\n    Import-Module $env:ChocolateyInstall\\chocolateyinstall\\helpers\\chocolateyInstaller.psm1\n```\n\nSo its important in this case that I call into the chocolatey installer code. My Currently My config is:\n\n```\n<config>\n    <ChocolateyPackage>http://chocolatey.org/packages/chocolatey/0.9.8.20-alpha1</ChocolateyPackage>\n    <ChocolateyRepo>https://raw.github.com/mwrock/chocolatey/BootstrapUrlOverride/chocolateyInstall/InstallChocolatey.ps1</ChocolateyRepo>\n</config>\n```\n. thats ok. actually not so important to me now but i do think it is worth having. thanks!\n\n---\n\n From: \"Rich Siegel\" notifications@github.com\nSent: Thursday, April 18, 2013 8:33 PM\nTo: \"chocolatey/chocolatey\" chocolatey@noreply.github.com\nSubject: Re: [chocolatey] [Enhancement] Ability to override bootstrapper url (#162)\n\nditto. no issue for merge. sad 7 months went by. -\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Cool. Maybe have them take an optional WebClient parameter. That way the caller can set it up however they need to.\n. Ya. Definitely. We could detect if they have already set a proxy and if so, leave it alone.\n. This does bring up some interesting and important considerations. I actually originally meant a WebRequest and not a WebClient. With either that solution or @ewilde's, you still get the progress bar and you keep the encapsulation of the main Chocolatey logic. You do delegate the assembly of the request but here assume that the caller accepts responsibility for that control. I had assumed we would pass the request to the callers like the options and forward to Get-WebFile. The trade off I see here is that that gives someone full control over all the possible web request settings which may be desirable, but the Options approach is nice since it may apply optional settings to more than just the web request. The disadvantage of the options is that it is not easy to discover what should be fed into it other than via documentation or source code (which may be fine).\n\nHere is another option. Don't alterthe signatures at  all and create a new function:\n\n```\nSYNTAX\nRegister-WebHandler -ForUrl <string> -Handler <ScriptBlock>\n\nEXAMPLE\nRegister-WebHandler -ForUri $url {  \n  $req = [System.Net.HttpWebRequest]::Create($url)\n  ...\n  return $req.GetResponse()\n}\n```\n\nChocolatey will invoke this script block whenever Get-WebFile has a url that meets the -ForUrl argument.\n\nThis allows us to keep the functions free of clutterand it also allows us to decouple Get-WebFile entirely from network dependencies in testing scenarios.\n. Great points. I don't see much of an issue with the headers and cookie container since most scenarios will work with the default headers and no cookie container, but many wont add the proxy stuff which will end up breaking alot of people behind proxies (like me at work). So it does seem important that we be able to set that up. Since the WebRequest/Response is fairly hard baked into the framework, this way not be so \"private\" but we will see folks begin to move to the new HttpClient/MessageHandler model as the 4.5 framework gains adoption. Of coarse Chocolatey cannot and should not abandon 4.0 clients.\n\nI was thinking that RegisterWebHandler would register the handler script in a hash table keyed on the url. Then Get-WebFile would check if there is a handler for the url it is using and if so, invoke the handler, otherwise invoke its own default handler.\n\nDefinitely need to handle the proxy story. Maybe require the scriptBlock to take a WebRequest argument. So Chocolatey Creates the webRequest and attaches the proxy stuff and then invokes the handler, passing the request in the Invoke-Command -ArgumentList param...or something like that.\n. I was thinking along these lines for a feed source provider. Thats safer since it is really limited to internal chocolatey code. I definitely agree with the need for backwards compatibility. Also need to vbe really careful we dont overly complexify things here which is easy to do. I dont see the value so much in appealing to the layman. That always seems to vome up in DSL discussions but who has ever seen it work? I do like the way it expresses an API in a simple and discoverable way.\n. so just to be clear, If I installed console2 and I enter Chocolatey whatprovides console.exe and assuming the package owner prvided this file name, the command would return the the console2 package name?\n\nSorry if this is obvious (I'll admit I'm not a package management expert), but whats the use case?\n. If you sign in on Chocolatey.org, you can download the nupkg or email the package author. I do agree that it would be nice to have a place in the nuspec where you could specify the package source for the sake of contributing pull requests. Ideally, I'd like to see some kind of extensibility baked into the official nuspec reference for this. If we added custom elements could that break some clients with the current xsd reference?\n. Yeah. I think being able to provide a link to one's package repo is sufficient. I think we get ourselves in trouble by bending the nuspec format if there is no provision for extensions in the schema.\n. heh. Appreciate the link above reminding me why I hate XSDs. That is one form of hate that we should all subscribe to.\n. It sounds like there may be some big changes coming with nuget 3.0. They are trying to make the nuget spec friendlier to different use cases and formats. Might be a good idea to get involved in those discussions.\n. yeah. someone I know was complaining that he now had a .bat file pointing to the installer for a package he created. I told him about the .ignore and suggested he unzip to $env:temp but it still seems like something choco could figure out on its own.\n. Nice!\n. This is a very nice improvement!

Noticed the merge issue and was in a hurry so if we decide to make this change I'll clean it up first.\n\nI'm a bit confused by the flow here and maybe I'm looking at something all together different.\n\nSo when you pass in $installerArguments to Chocolatey-Install.ps1 for a chocolatey nuget package, the function calls:\n\n```\nChocolatey-NuGet $packageName $source $version;\n```\n\nThe $InstallerArguments are not forwarded down the chain. I'm probably misunderstanding something. How is $installerArgs getting acted upon in the package if one wanted to reference it?\n. Ahhh. ok. The scoping rules is still one area of powershell that really confuses me. I had a feeling thats what this was. Thanks for pointing it out!\n\nI'm gonna close this PR and push a new changeset to keep the line straight. Not something worth holding this release for. I want to use this change for testing some pester mocking stuff. Got back to that this morning and made some breakthroughs. It would be nice to mock Get-Children stuff in Run-ChocolateyPS to avoid creating an actual file in the test.\n. At least it is 100% deterministic.\n. I  agree. I spent alot of time last weekend exploring the online help capabilities of powershell and there are some gems that we may not be taking advantage of. I also think tab completion could be leveraged for the sub commands. Of course that only works in powershell but would be nice for those who spend most of their time there.\n. Interesting. What were you thinking of doing here?\n\nOne thing I have been thinking would be nice and might align with this is to have a $chocolatey hashtable exported from the ChocolateyInstaller module that has some properties like the tools dir and the bin dir. So from a package script I dont have to do  `$tools = \"$(Split-Path -parent $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Definition)\"` because I could simply do `$chocolatey.ToolsPath` instead.\n. Yeah. I think it really depends on the installation scenario. I can imagine lots of scenarios like yours where you would want it to fail on the first error. Maybe there is something wrong with the underlying environment (memory, storage space, etc.) or you are using chocolatey to deploy app components and one of the early packages is buggy. You are likely to see lots of failures and would prefer to have it simply stop so you can diagnose the root problem earlier.\n\nMy hunch is that the majority of users land on the other side (myself included) and want the installation to continue. I see alot of failures happen that are not related. Like one package's url is temporarily down or some other network glich. The full test package I use for boxstarter takes 1 to 4 hours to run depending on the OS and network conditions. It would be frustrating for it to stop 75% of the way in. As long as I have a log of what failed I'm good.\n\nI think it would be important to have control over this with some kind of a SilentlyContinue or StopOnError switch.\n. ugh. that looks like my handywork. will fix tonight.\n. Interesting. Could you provide an example?\n. Agreed. and source too.\n. True. That makes it interesting. and on that note, when we do enable multiple packages (which will be super cool) we should make sure you can pass in package names via the pipeline.\n. It should be be doing that now. Pester will pass an exit code equal to the number of failed tests which Chocolaty will forward. However, until earlier this morning, if the chocolatey build failed somewhere other than the tests, it would not exit with a non 0 code. I fixed that and it should all be good now. Let me know if you see anything otherwise. Thanks!\n. Sorry. I think I misunderstood. I was thinking build failures. I am overly obsessed with tests and builds today.\n. I o not feel it is out of line to require submitters of pull requests to write tests. I know that is not necessarily as ubiquitous in powershell as it is in C# but this is one of the larger bits of powershell out there and it just wont be manageable or fun in any way to write tests on our own. It also helps to raise the bar of the community IMO. :)\n.

Just to comment on the scripts v PS. I would have leaned the same way a year ago before becoming comfortable with PS. Scriptcs sounds awesome as another low friction tool for c# devs to leverage their knowledge. There is no question a good learning curve to get comfortable with PS and you need to use it consistently for it to stick. That said, like any language PS has strengths lacking in c# for scriting. Its dynamic nature and the pipeline are very slick. Of course JavaScript and ruby would have done well here too and engaged a much larger community.\n. Hmm. Interesting. Will take a look thanks!\n.

This is also a good topic for the [google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/chocolatey).\n. I just reproduced this. The key is to make sure you do not open your ps console as admin. I opened a standard ps console on win 8. UAC is enabled (as it will be on most win 8 installs since metro does not work without it) and I did not open as administrator. After invoking clist -source webpi, i was prompted to open a new PS session as admin which opened a new ps window where I saw the wonders of webpi flash before me and alas disappeared just as fast as they appeared. If I remember correctly, there is code that pumps the webpi output to a file and then the original session pulls that output from the file back into its own session. So something there is not quite right.\n. Unless someone has already checked, we should check if the latest webpi cli requires admin privileges to list packages and just remove the elevation if not. I'm also wondering if cinst is equally broken.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: \"Gary Ewan Park\" notifications@github.com\nSent: \u200e5/\u200e28/\u200e2013 9:39 AM\nTo: \"chocolatey/chocolatey\" chocolatey@noreply.github.com\nCc: \"Matt Wrock\" matt@mattwrock.com\nSubject: Re: [chocolatey] clist -source webpi doesn't list commands (itflashes and disappears) (#293)\n\nAh, that makes sense :-)\nI have a potential fix, namely:\n  if ($source -like 'webpi') {\n$chocoInstallLog = Join-Path $nugetChocolateyPath 'chocolateyWebPiInstall.log';\nRemove-LastInstallLog $chocoInstallLog\n$webpiArgs =\"/c webpicmd /List /ListOption:All | Tee-Object -FilePath `'$chocoInstallLog`';\"\nStart-ChocolateyProcessAsAdmin \"cmd.exe $webpiArgs\" -nosleep\nCreate-InstallLogIfNotExists $chocoInstallLog\n$installOutput = Get-Content $chocoInstallLog -Encoding Ascii\nforeach ($line in $installOutput) {\n  Write-Host $line\n}\nWhich does the same thing as the Windows Feature equivalent, but it makes the command VERY slow to execute.

For example the 'Turn Windows Features On and Off\" GUI. However I wouldn't say it is by any means official and I definitely see your point. We would want to implement this so that both terms are accepted to support backwards compatibility.\n. I agree with @gep13 that encouraging users to use a myget feed for personal packages is the way to go. As far as the educational process, certainly including the guidelines in the confirmation email or at least a link is a great idea, but might also consider checking conventions at push time. While we could not know for sure if a user is pushing a personalized package, we could look for dot notation that does not include the standard prefixes and then prompt the user with something like, \"This might not be a package intended for public assumption, personal packages are best kept on other feds like myget. Are you sure you want to push this package?\"\n. True. A CI model would be better. The question is what would a reliable CI model look like for chocolatey packages. This is something I have been thinking about lately. Ideally, it would spin up a VM of a vanilla OS install, run the package and validate that there were no errors (you could get fancier and have package authors include a validation scriptblock). \n\nWith the Boxstarter work that I hope to release this week this is simple:\n\n```\n$result = win7VM,win8VM,server2012VM,server2k8r2VM | \n    Enable-BoxstarterVM -Credential $cred -CheckpointName Fresh | \n    Install-BoxstarterPackage -PackageName myPackage -Force\n$passed=$true\n$result | ? { ($_.Errors.Count -gt 0) -or ($_.completed -eq $false)  } | % { $passed = $false }\nreturn $passed\n```\n\nHowever this requires Hyper-V to be accessible. I'll be adding support to azure and AWS next but compute time is not free unless we could get a cloud provider to sponsor this. I think this could help in raising the credibility of the community feed which i think is one of the biggest road blocks to chocolatey adoption. Imagine adding some anti malware checking on top of that.\n. Currently it assumes the VM to exist and will throw an error if not. After I wrap up azure and AWS and make a few \"engineering debt\" adjustments. I'm gonna start the functionality for injecting installer parameters into an ISO. The MS Hyper-V module provides pretty straight forward means to creating a VM from an ISO. I might add a convenience command to wrap it. \n. Totally agree @ferventcoder I was lazy here just throwing out a proof of concept. For a real test I too always like to assume false.\n. @gep13: It is my sole \"after hours\" project :) The code i have been pushing is largely based on spikes done in September so it has just been a matter of getting it fairly clean and around tests. Thought I was gonna be able to release Sunday night but after running tests in a domain joined environment, enabling WMI is kicking my butt. :(\n. For those interested. I released the Hyper-V functionality last night - http://boxstarter.org/VMIntegration\n. Yeah. That is what I'm thinking to a degree. However, this starts to look like Vagrant and my goal is not to be another Vagrant. If I had more time, I'd love to learn some Ruby and create a Boxstarter provisioner and a Hyper-V and azure provider for Vagrant. Hopefully I or someone else will eventually but I have some other stuff I really want to get to first. But yeah. I think you will likely see a Boxstarter API where you use the same command and pass in a provider string or enum value.\n. Yeah that would be nice. I had started to do that on a related spike a while back and then realized that because it is .net 4, it requires at least PS 3 in order to call directly from powershell.\n\nFrom: Gary Ewan Park [mailto:notifications@github.com] \nSent: Thursday, October 24, 2013 9:24 PM\nTo: chocolatey/chocolatey\nSubject: Re: [chocolatey] Support for version pattern matching (for installing, updating, and specifying dependencies) (#346)\n\nThere is a .Net Class for SemVer in the nuget code base, I wonder if we could re-use that. \n\nSent from my Windows Phone \n\n---\n\nFrom: Rich Siegelmailto:notifications@github.com \nSent: \u200e25/\u200e10/\u200e2013 02:04 \nTo: chocolatey/chocolateymailto:chocolatey@noreply.github.com \nSubject: Re: [chocolatey] Support for version pattern matching (for installing, updating, and specifying dependencies) (#346) \n\nagree with you ferventcoder- that was my understanding. \n\ni think its a metric s-ton of a parsing exercise that probably needs to start with TDD via pester, and make each use case pass... just looking at this readme https://github.com/isaacs/node-semver made my head hurt. \n\n---\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub: \nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/346#issuecomment-27047579 \n\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/346#issuecomment-27060509 .  https://github.com/notifications/beacon/SVpp0Doaws5T1aBsNeEOjuhn4qSMKcvXexQ8DxDMiWxbwLGbXJX0oqylR61aZFj8.gif \n. Agree with Rob that the fx3.5 check would be better placed in its own package. I did this for 4.5 and 4.5.1. Not sure why I did not use the WindowsFeature (especially since win features was my contribution). Maybe this package predates that. \n\nOne small caution on webpi: there are times when webPI does more than simply install what it is advertising and the simpler approach might be to simply install an MSI. I have recently discovered the .net4.0 install to be an example. Simply installing the MSI is faster and simpler and often meets your requirements while webpi makes several DISM calls and does some additional asp.net configuration. This might be what you want but not necessarily if you just need the basic framework BCL. \n\nI was having alot of issues in Boxstarter where the webpi was failing if I disabled windows update first and if I kept it enabled, webpi turns it back on and potentially opens the flood gates of updates that then launch their own MSIEXEC processes that will cause the ,net4.0 msi in webpi to either block or sometimes fail. So the next boxstarter release will simply install the .net4.5 MSI and not use webpi which I have found to be far more reliable. Of course this is an edge case affecting new installs primarily on win7 and intermittently occurring. Each webpi package should be considered on a package by package basis.\n. It is a lot of red. Regarding root cause you might be able to get closer by googling exit code 1620. It would either be a msiexec code or one from the app.\n\nHope that helps.\n\nMatt\n\nSent from my Windows Phone\n\n---\n\nFrom: Redsandromailto:notifications@github.com\nSent: \u200e10/\u200e27/\u200e2013 3:18 PM\nTo: chocolatey/chocolateymailto:chocolatey@noreply.github.com\nSubject: [chocolatey] Errors are thrown two or three times (#357)\n\nWhen packages fail, I see a lot of red text.

I do think that better use could be made of the Write-Verbose, Write-Debug  and debug/verbose preference settings so that the default output is a bit more sparse. I think most installs, given no errors have an acceptable amount of out put. There are places though, where it does feel like the output is not that valuable to the casual user. For example the out put when elevating privileges.\n. A few suggestions:\n- output psobjects to the pipeline with info like success/fail, exceptions, packagename\n- all verbose info that goes to the log should also gk to the console if -verbose is passed or $verbose preference is set to continue.\n. Yeah. In v2.1 I reworked Boxstarter output to this model.\n\nRegarding the verbose output, you can handle this with Write-Verbose or Write-Debug or both. Its not always crystal clear when to use one over the other. I use Write-Verbose but Chocolatey already makes use of Write-Debug and proxies the \"real\" Write-Debug function in order to intercept the output and write it to the log. So as long as you use Write-Debug for all output you want to be logged but NOT displayed, that is exactly what will happen. If the user wants the debug output to print to the console, they just need to set $DebugPreference to \"Continue\". Thats a PowerShell automatic variable and tells PS how to handle Write-Debug. The default value of $DebugPreference is \"SilentlyContinue\" which causes Write-Debug to do nothing (or in Choco's case, JUST log to disk). What makes this tricky for choco are the Batch redirects. Setting $debugPreference to \"Continue\" wil only have the desired effect if calling choco's Chocolatey.ps1 directly because then the choco call runs in the same scope as the caller. Using the batch redirect like cinst creates a new powershell session with the preferences set to the defaults. So you would need to add -Debug parameters to the choco commands that will set the $debugPreference of the choco powershell session to print debug output if specified.\n\nThe PSObjects make parsing and reacting to chocolatey results much more script friendly. Instead of (or in addition to) \n\n```\nWrite-Host \"Chocolatey failed to install $packageName yadayadayada\"\n```\n\nYou have \n\n```\nWrite-Output @{PackageName=$PackageName;Success=$true;Exceptions=$TheExceptionsRaised}\n```\n\nThis means I can inspect the results like so:\n\n```\n$result=Chocolatey-Install MyPackage\nif(!$result.Success){\n   #Do something to deal with the failure\n}\n```\n\nAgain this is tricky due to the batch stuff. I lose the Powershell pipeline since the chocolatey batch file spawns a new PS session. So using cinst or another one of the batch file gateways, $result would not capture the output but I do believe it would at least print the object to the console. Users who want to take advantage of the pipeline would just need to call chocolateys powershell functions directly.\n. Its actually the other way around. Permissins need to be elevated to call DISM. If you already have UAC disabled, thats not necessary but its not what is causing the call to fail. As of win7/win 2008R2, the DISM command can be used to install windows features. I'm not sure what mechanism is used on 2008 SP2. At the least, I think it would be reasonable for choco to detect if your OS version is less than 7/2008R2 and provide a message stating that the WindowsFeature source is not available on your platform. Of course finding the win 2008 SP2 compliant method would be ideal as long as the method is reasonable to implement.\n. looks good to me.\n. Ahh. This is because Chocolatey uses th WebPI installer for .net 4 which in addition to installing .net 4 also sets up asp.net and there by sets up IIS\n\nChocolatey does not need this. Clients like 2008R2 that do not have .net4 installed do need .Net4  to work with Nuget.exe but nothing more. I think it would be a good idea to replace the webpi installer with the vanilla MSI install of of 4.0 or 4.5.1 or at least  4.5.\n. yup. exactly.\n. It really depends on what you are trying to accomplish. Unfortunately it is not always easy to discover the complete ramifications of each method. WebPI is great but I think the creators of the .net4 webpi package were \u201casp.net opinionated.\u201d That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. Getting all the asp.net/IIS stuff right can be tricky and they were likely trying to guide people to make the right choices. However, in the interest of taking control over your environment, I\u2019d personally prefer the more minimal approach.\n\nFrom: Daniel Liuzzi [mailto:notifications@github.com] \nSent: Monday, December 30, 2013 2:44 AM\nTo: chocolatey/chocolatey\nCc: Matt Wrock\nSubject: Re: [chocolatey] Installing Chocolatey adds Web Server (IIS) Role (#399)\n\nThank you guys for your replies.

I assume it must the same reason (WebPI adding them when it installs .NET 4.) Now that you bring up WebPI, I remember when I started playing with Chocolatey, I was unsure on which source to use when there are many. For example ASP.NET MVC 3 can be installed from both the default source (i.e. cinst aspnetmvc.install), as well as the from the webpi source (i.e. choco webpi MVC3). I was under the impression the WebPI might be a better choice as it seems more \"package oriented\" than vanilla MSI, so I was using that, but now I'm not so sure. Is the default source better for these cases?\n\nThanks again.\n\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/399#issuecomment-31340715 .  https://github.com/notifications/beacon/655165__eyJzY29wZSI6Ik5ld3NpZXM6QmVhY29uIiwiZXhwaXJlcyI6MTcwMzkzMzA2NiwiZGF0YSI6eyJpZCI6MjI3MTEzMTd9fQ==--c67744b69d3816356f23944e0abe5e56b580293b.gif \n. and technically in this case its for installing the installer to install the installers :)\n. yes. \n\n```\nMock 7za\n```\n.

However -logout seems poorly named to me. The first thing I think of is signing out of something. How about using -Quiet?\n. If you used -Quiet and made the default $false, wouldn't that have the same effect?\n. Yes. I think that is what @jole78 was intending this argument to accomplish and something that I think makes sense - completely silence the \"Host\" stream. I'm assuming keeping the other streams, output/warning/verbose/error untouched is desired since there are already ways built into the PS syntax to silence or redirect those.\n. Interesting. I ran into this exact issue last night. Only happens on a win2k8 AzureVM. I have a 2012R2 VM that works fine. Also, it worked in the morning but has not worked since I got home from work yesterday. I'm thinking it is somehow proxy related. When I turned on fiddler, it went away and I can get to the url in a browser. Blew away and recreated the VM - still broke. I'm planning to troubleshoot further tonight.\n. Both should work, but I think I figured this out. The issue is a combination of how the .net http stack in implemented in v 3.5 and before along with a likely change in protocol or certificate on Github's end. I had to use Wireshark to see the difference. .net3.5 (the version used on win7 and server2008R2) is not handling the SSL client key exchange and just hanging. This can be fixed by calling:\n\n```\n[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = 48\n```\n\n48 is the Enum value for SecurityProtocolType.Ssl3.\n\nI'll be submitting a PR or perhaps just commiting since this is likely a big blocker right now.\n. I sent a PR https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org/pull/72 since even if I did commit, I'm not sure it would go live. \n. It only breaks if using a .net 2/3.5  HttpWebRequest. Works fine in browsers and .net 4+\n. We are not, but that was one of my initial thoughts too. Setting it didn't resolve the issue.\n. I managed to get one packed down to just under 4GB (still huge) using lzma compression:\n\nhttps://vagrantcloud.com/mwrock/Windows2012R2\n\nWon't work for you since it is a hyper-V box and requires a couple recent vagrant PRs I submitted that allow for .vhd format files and a working implementation of SMB on windows guests. I should make a vbox version.\n\nYou can try grabbing the evaluation ISO at http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2012-r2\n. I had to sign the click-once application which is the kinda different. Its the \"delivery mechanism\" of the powershell and it just creates a powershell session, bypassing the execution policy and runs the powershell unsigned.\n\nI do believe that signing powershell does involve an authenticode cert which will cost money.\n.

The menu entry is there by default, and it does appear the particular registry data change is what caused the entry to disappear.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6148201/4111444/eef8f2e6-3208-11e4-9ac7-2fe9ef510a82.png)\n\n---\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/563#issuecomment-54085118\n. I just did a little research and experimentation and figured out the issue. The chocolatey helper uses the DOS commands `assoc` and `ftype` to manipulate the association which in turn edits HKCR registry entries. This is all a bit wonky. For example if you change associations using the windows explorer gui, it changes a different set in HKCU and will give precedence to that. \n\nAnyways the problem with the \"New\" context menu is that when `ftype` creates the new \"content type\" it does not give it a label. The readable text that appears next to each item in the menu. I tried manually adding that to the registry and then the new item appeared.\n\nSo the fix is pretty straight forward. The command will just need to edit the registry entry after calling `fype`. When I wrote the helper, I wanted to avoid direct registry editing and did not notice the missing New context menu item . As I have many times learned, direct registry editing is a core aspect that makes up the joy of windows automation Therefore I will be happily adding a PR to do just that after I slip into something a little more comfortable a little later.\n. Unfortunately there is no argument for adding the label. My hunch is that `ftype` and `assoc` are ancient commands and are not getting much love in later windows versions (but I could be way off here) you cant even call these from powershell directly but have to invoke via cmd.exe. The extra shell is due to the fact that chocolatey has to ensure that the call is run with elevated privileges and invokes in a elevated shell to do that.\n. Just Submitted PR #564 to address this.\n. I'll take a look at tests tonight. I really should have run those locally. \n. Local tests are passing as long as I am using pester v2.0.2. I small just pushed a change to the build scripts that fix an issue if like me one has a version of pester greater than 2.0.2. However I doubt this is why appveyor is failing.\n. all the appveyor failing tests are related to Get-CheckSumValid. Based on the errors it seems like CheckSum.exe is not where Chocolatey expects it to be. Is there a way in Appveyor to browse the chocolatey files that are installed?\n. my PR addresses the exit code but does not rethrow. Honestly I personally prefer actually rethrowing the actual exception. For something like Boxstarter which calls the chocolatey powershell functiuons directly, I can better inspect the exception and provide better logging. I realize that will no longer be possible with choco.exe.\n\nAnother PR I considered was adding more detail to the exceptions logged. Currently chocolotey just captures the error message which is sometimes not very helpful. Doing something like logging:\n\n```\n$_.exception | fl * -force | out-string\n```\n\nwould capture any stacktrace and inner exceptions and even script level stack trace on later OSs. I'm probably gonna hold off on contributing that until the new chocolatey comes out but this is my 2 cents. :)\n\nAlso, chocolatey simply returns an exit code of 1 and it would be better to at least return the original exit code. My PR was just an attempt to \"fix\" what appeared to be the current intent of the code. On the boxstarter side I can always just examine the `$errors` array to grab the full exceptions after the fact. Again, that only works if you are calling chocolatey from powershell and calling the actual powershell functions so you are not crossing any process boundaries.\n. I really like what @juliankrispel is doing here. Even with the goal of running choco on different platforms I like the c: . My guess is that choco will largely be the package manager for Windows apps regardless from where you use it and the c: Drives home that distinction.\n. Awesome work! I like 8 the most.\n. Right but it fixes the PS version. When is choco.exe due?\n. Oh ok.

I think rob and @Iristyle were looking at his yesterday and found that it did not work. I ran into this issue a couple weeks ago and also tried this without luck.

It was mentioned though that \"Path\" may not be enough. There could be other variables that other programs might expect (like JAVA_HOME). Also, this needs to be batch file compliant as well. I believe @Iristyle was going to implement something that would work for both ps and dos. See the Issue #153 for the details of the discussion.\n. This is still an open issue. The above pull request only fixes Chocolatey's ability to refresh its own view but does not refresh the view of the user session. Need to add some bath flavored means of refreshing a normal command line. Also need to provide a means of refreshing PS users most likely via their $Profile.\n. I have been doing alot of experimentation lately around remoting and chocolate. My next boxstarter release will support this and auto configure the remoting client as well as the target as long as the wmi ports are open.\n\nmost packages will work fine using vanilla remoting but there are some tricky edge cases. One is the double hop scenario mentioned above. The solution there is using credssp. This will solve issues around accessing shares that require your auth token.\n\nthe stikiest issue is around windows update. Alot of Ms installs interact with the win update service. Examples are the .net frameworks, ie10, webpi and probably plenty others. Win update will not honor a remote token. The only reliable solution I have found is using scheduled tasks. I create a scheduled task for the choco pkg and forward the output and error streams to a file. I launch the task and use a file stream to stream to the console. Its more painful than I thought it would be.\n\none other case that simply won't work is most packages that use autoit or anything that interacts with a window.\n\nnot sure why there would be issues with enter-possession but I almost always use invoke-command. \n. I guess if we could get one or two users to validate or contribute who have access to an authenticating proxy, that would be good.\n\n---\n\n From: \"Rob Reynolds\" notifications@github.com\nSent: Thursday, April 18, 2013 9:23 PM\nTo: \"chocolatey/chocolatey\" chocolatey@noreply.github.com\nSubject: Re: [chocolatey] Add support for authenticating proxies to installation script (#139)\n\nI also have one in email from someone on this as well. -\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. ugh. that did not go as planned.

I'll add that.\n\nI do think that adding multiple features would be handy and should be faster since fewer round trips would be incurred. I didn't add it since it did not seem to mesh with the current chocolatey model of having a single package for each cinst. However, rather than making a special case for this feed, what would you think of adding the ability for any chocolatey feed (or atleast this one and chocolatey nuget) to accept an array of packages. That might be a nice overall enhancement. The challenge is that the normal CommandLine does not have an understanding of arrays but we might be able to change the .bat file generator to convert comma delimited arguments to arrays.\n. Took a look at adding uninstall. While it looks pretty trivial for this feed. It seems like the current codebase is in need of a more pluggable pattern. Right now, each feed have dedicated scripts for install, webpi and winfeatures have inline conditionals for lists and uninstall only supports nuget.\n\nI'd propose that each feed have their own dedicated script(s) for all functions and the Chocolatey-XXX function becomes a factory or just provides obviously common logic. There are a number of patterns that can be implemented. One suggestion:\n- A provider, say webpi, has a entry script WePi-Provider.ps1\n- Chocolatey exposes functions like Install-Strategy ([scriptblock] $InstallScript){ $InstallerRegistry[$source] = $installScript}\n- $chocolatey exposes a $ChocolateyArgs that the plugin script can access ala $ChocolateyArgs.PackageName\n- Chocolatey dot sources all the plugins when the module loads\n- Chocolatey invokes the appropriate script when user invokes Chocolatey-XXX.\n\nThis is very rough and hardly baked but you get the idea. I'll post this on the forum and push this feed as is. Then we can create issues for plugins if we think this makes sense and also add another issue for supporting multiple packages.\n. I think this might work. Assuming new_var is the environment variable set.\n\nGet-WmiObject Win32_Environment | where-object -filter {$_.Name -eq 'new_var'} | select VariableValue\n. Yup. You would have to build a list before the install and then do a delta.\n. I played with some ideas today and I think I found a way to make this work for all env vars in ps and cmd with little batch ugliness. The gist of it is this. I'd have a Refresh-Environment.ps1 and RefreshEnvironment.bat. The ps1 would do something like:\n\n```\n$newVars=(powershell -outputformat xml -command \"Get-WmiObject Win32_Environment | select Name, VariableValue\")\n```\n\nWhat I foud is that you have to either use WMI or go directly to the registry and from a different process. Then it would use the xml api to build a PS dictionary of the environment variables that propperly resolves the system and user variables and does spacial handling on the path via concatenation. Finally it iterates the dictionary and flushes it to the env:\\ drive. Then it outputs \n\n```\ngci env:\n```\n\nto standard output. \n\nThe bat calls the ps1 and flushes it to a file via >> and uses the\n\n```\nFOR /F \"tokens=2,3* delims= \" %%i in (vars.txt) do SET %i=%j\n```\n\nBased on some prototype tests, I think this works. I plan to extract this into a separate chocolatey/repo since I think it has usage scenarios outside of chocolatey. The snippits above might not be syntactically perfect but hopefully you get the idea. Hopefully I can get to this before the end of the weekend. Thoughts?\n. Very nice. Plugged that into my test simulator and it works. I think adding the batch compatibility should be straight forward by having this output the new vars to std out and then having a .bat call that and taking the FOR strategy I mentioned above.\n. Yeah I think this should probably go into Chocolatey-Nuget instead of Install-ChocolateyInstallPackage so it can be applied to all install scenarios.\n. Great job! I'll add in the batch file version later unless someone else beats me too it.\n. I'm closing this since it was essentially fixed with fd8b079c54eb8719f2e8cff4801a8ca363fdd695. That should allow chocolatey (but not the caller) to use paths set by installers. There is another issue for the caller: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/134 \n. The nice thing about the holding cell is that should solve the scenario where after an error occurs, chocolatey thinks that the package is installed.\n. right. Do you think the expectation though is that if a package fails to install calling cinst without -force should not state that the package has already been installed? That was always mine and getting that message feels wrong. If the holding cell is deleted after a failure and nothing goes to lib in the end, then that should solve the issue.\n. That's a good point on the uninstall. I was actually thinking that it just get deleted but your idea is much better.\n. So I've been playing around with this (related to Issue #153 and issue #134). Cleaning up the tests and integration and should have it in a mergeable state tonight. I think this will address scenarios where you are installing a string of packages via normal dependencies or a package config and one ChocolateyInstall may need the new variables defined or modified by a previous install.\n\nUnfortunately I don't think it will have much of an impact on the scenario where the user's shell would like to use the refreshed vars. I had hoped and (incorerrectly I think) assumed that this PR as is would allow someone using chocolatey via PS to have their current shell inherrit all updated env vars and adding a small bit of batch script goodness would expand this to normal command line shells as well. The challenge is that even if you are accessing chocolatey via PS (which I imagine most do), if you use the cinst flavored shortcut commands or even the longer Chocolatey-Install commands, you stil go through a batch shell. This means that when chocolatey calls ths Update-SessionVariables function, the env: affected is a different shell than the one that the user is in. Of course the user can invoke the function on their own and that will update their shell bt it is something they will have to do on their own. Even adding batch script compliance to this will not fix that since again, that is a different shell. That would address users who call chocolatey in a normal command line shell, but is that a typical use case? To me using the batch shell as a day to day shell is like using Windows in Safe Mode which is not a good experience.\n\nOne way to get this to possibly get this to work but i  think is unacceptable would be to add a line to the user's $profile that modifies their prompt(). This might call any existing prompt, refresh the variables and then erase itself. This fels fragile and maybe even invasive.\n. I think getting the vars working on Rob's favorite shell is very possible. But no matter how you change cinst or anything else in the batch goo to get the vars to play nice with the normal command line, it wont work for the user calling cinst from powershell because once yoy are in cinst, you are in a different shell and it cant reach back into the user's PS session.\n. Hey. That's a good idea. Create a example-profile that also gets dot sourced into ones profile and alias all the commands.\n. I think most that work in PS have that set already since its fairly useless otherwise. \n. OK. Pulled this in. Regarding the issue of failing tests when not running as admin. I changed the test to check if the user is admin and if not, the test is essentially skipped. I am going to change the Test msbuild target to elevate privileges. This way, running as a non admin user using just \"Pester\" will skip the test, but when the tests run as a build via ./build, the permisions will elevate and the tests will run.\n\nI will also crete a separate issue for adding the batch style refresh and another the profile stuff discussed above.\n. Issue #134 is the placeholder for this I think. I just added a note to this for clarification.\n\n---\n\n From: \"Rob Reynolds\" notifications@github.com\nSent: Wednesday, October 31, 2012 11:43 PM\nTo: \"chocolatey/chocolatey\" chocolatey@noreply.github.com\nSubject: Re: [chocolatey] [Enhancement] Refresh env vars after Install (#158)\n\n@mwrock Did those separate issues get created?   -\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Seems like it would be tricky for choco to know if software has been installed on its own outside of choc. However the package owner who has more knowledge about the dependencies could check in chocolateyinstall. Similar to the .net 4.5 installer. It checks for the presence of 4.5 in the registry and then just returns success and does nothing more if it is.\n. Yeah this is a bit of an odd case. Im working on a chocolatey bootstrapper and one of the first things that it does is call this script to install chocolatey. The bootstrapper is using alot of the functionality in the alpha. So the bootstrapping snippet looks like this:\n\n```\nif(-not $env:ChocolateyInstall -or -not (Test-Path \"$env:ChocolateyInstall\")){\n    $env:ChocolateyInstall = \"$env:systemdrive\\chocolatey\"\n    New-Item $env:ChocolateyInstall -Force -type directory\n    $url=Config.ChocolateyPackage \n    iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('Config.ChocolateyRepo'))\n    Enable-Net40\n}\n    Import-Module $env:ChocolateyInstall\\chocolateyinstall\\helpers\\chocolateyInstaller.psm1\n```\n\nSo its important in this case that I call into the chocolatey installer code. My Currently My config is:\n\n```\n<config>\n    <ChocolateyPackage>http://chocolatey.org/packages/chocolatey/0.9.8.20-alpha1</ChocolateyPackage>\n    <ChocolateyRepo>https://raw.github.com/mwrock/chocolatey/BootstrapUrlOverride/chocolateyInstall/InstallChocolatey.ps1</ChocolateyRepo>\n</config>\n```\n. thats ok. actually not so important to me now but i do think it is worth having. thanks!\n\n---\n\n From: \"Rich Siegel\" notifications@github.com\nSent: Thursday, April 18, 2013 8:33 PM\nTo: \"chocolatey/chocolatey\" chocolatey@noreply.github.com\nSubject: Re: [chocolatey] [Enhancement] Ability to override bootstrapper url (#162)\n\nditto. no issue for merge. sad 7 months went by. -\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Cool. Maybe have them take an optional WebClient parameter. That way the caller can set it up however they need to.\n. Ya. Definitely. We could detect if they have already set a proxy and if so, leave it alone.\n. This does bring up some interesting and important considerations. I actually originally meant a WebRequest and not a WebClient. With either that solution or @ewilde's, you still get the progress bar and you keep the encapsulation of the main Chocolatey logic. You do delegate the assembly of the request but here assume that the caller accepts responsibility for that control. I had assumed we would pass the request to the callers like the options and forward to Get-WebFile. The trade off I see here is that that gives someone full control over all the possible web request settings which may be desirable, but the Options approach is nice since it may apply optional settings to more than just the web request. The disadvantage of the options is that it is not easy to discover what should be fed into it other than via documentation or source code (which may be fine).\n\nHere is another option. Don't alterthe signatures at  all and create a new function:\n\n```\nSYNTAX\nRegister-WebHandler -ForUrl <string> -Handler <ScriptBlock>\n\nEXAMPLE\nRegister-WebHandler -ForUri $url {  \n  $req = [System.Net.HttpWebRequest]::Create($url)\n  ...\n  return $req.GetResponse()\n}\n```\n\nChocolatey will invoke this script block whenever Get-WebFile has a url that meets the -ForUrl argument.\n\nThis allows us to keep the functions free of clutterand it also allows us to decouple Get-WebFile entirely from network dependencies in testing scenarios.\n. Great points. I don't see much of an issue with the headers and cookie container since most scenarios will work with the default headers and no cookie container, but many wont add the proxy stuff which will end up breaking alot of people behind proxies (like me at work). So it does seem important that we be able to set that up. Since the WebRequest/Response is fairly hard baked into the framework, this way not be so \"private\" but we will see folks begin to move to the new HttpClient/MessageHandler model as the 4.5 framework gains adoption. Of coarse Chocolatey cannot and should not abandon 4.0 clients.\n\nI was thinking that RegisterWebHandler would register the handler script in a hash table keyed on the url. Then Get-WebFile would check if there is a handler for the url it is using and if so, invoke the handler, otherwise invoke its own default handler.\n\nDefinitely need to handle the proxy story. Maybe require the scriptBlock to take a WebRequest argument. So Chocolatey Creates the webRequest and attaches the proxy stuff and then invokes the handler, passing the request in the Invoke-Command -ArgumentList param...or something like that.\n. I was thinking along these lines for a feed source provider. Thats safer since it is really limited to internal chocolatey code. I definitely agree with the need for backwards compatibility. Also need to vbe really careful we dont overly complexify things here which is easy to do. I dont see the value so much in appealing to the layman. That always seems to vome up in DSL discussions but who has ever seen it work? I do like the way it expresses an API in a simple and discoverable way.\n. so just to be clear, If I installed console2 and I enter Chocolatey whatprovides console.exe and assuming the package owner prvided this file name, the command would return the the console2 package name?\n\nSorry if this is obvious (I'll admit I'm not a package management expert), but whats the use case?\n. If you sign in on Chocolatey.org, you can download the nupkg or email the package author. I do agree that it would be nice to have a place in the nuspec where you could specify the package source for the sake of contributing pull requests. Ideally, I'd like to see some kind of extensibility baked into the official nuspec reference for this. If we added custom elements could that break some clients with the current xsd reference?\n. Yeah. I think being able to provide a link to one's package repo is sufficient. I think we get ourselves in trouble by bending the nuspec format if there is no provision for extensions in the schema.\n. heh. Appreciate the link above reminding me why I hate XSDs. That is one form of hate that we should all subscribe to.\n. It sounds like there may be some big changes coming with nuget 3.0. They are trying to make the nuget spec friendlier to different use cases and formats. Might be a good idea to get involved in those discussions.\n. yeah. someone I know was complaining that he now had a .bat file pointing to the installer for a package he created. I told him about the .ignore and suggested he unzip to $env:temp but it still seems like something choco could figure out on its own.\n. Nice!\n. This is a very nice improvement! Awesome job.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Rob Reynolds\nSent: 10/16/2012 8:59 AM\nTo: chocolatey/chocolatey\nCc: Matt Wrock\nSubject: Re: [chocolatey] Update Write-Progress every 5000 iterations insteadof every iteration (#177)\n\nThis is in.

Noticed the merge issue and was in a hurry so if we decide to make this change I'll clean it up first.\n\nI'm a bit confused by the flow here and maybe I'm looking at something all together different.\n\nSo when you pass in $installerArguments to Chocolatey-Install.ps1 for a chocolatey nuget package, the function calls:\n\n```\nChocolatey-NuGet $packageName $source $version;\n```\n\nThe $InstallerArguments are not forwarded down the chain. I'm probably misunderstanding something. How is $installerArgs getting acted upon in the package if one wanted to reference it?\n. Ahhh. ok. The scoping rules is still one area of powershell that really confuses me. I had a feeling thats what this was. Thanks for pointing it out!\n\nI'm gonna close this PR and push a new changeset to keep the line straight. Not something worth holding this release for. I want to use this change for testing some pester mocking stuff. Got back to that this morning and made some breakthroughs. It would be nice to mock Get-Children stuff in Run-ChocolateyPS to avoid creating an actual file in the test.\n. At least it is 100% deterministic.\n. I  agree. I spent alot of time last weekend exploring the online help capabilities of powershell and there are some gems that we may not be taking advantage of. I also think tab completion could be leveraged for the sub commands. Of course that only works in powershell but would be nice for those who spend most of their time there.\n. Interesting. What were you thinking of doing here?\n\nOne thing I have been thinking would be nice and might align with this is to have a $chocolatey hashtable exported from the ChocolateyInstaller module that has some properties like the tools dir and the bin dir. So from a package script I dont have to do  `$tools = \"$(Split-Path -parent $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Definition)\"` because I could simply do `$chocolatey.ToolsPath` instead.\n. Yeah. I think it really depends on the installation scenario. I can imagine lots of scenarios like yours where you would want it to fail on the first error. Maybe there is something wrong with the underlying environment (memory, storage space, etc.) or you are using chocolatey to deploy app components and one of the early packages is buggy. You are likely to see lots of failures and would prefer to have it simply stop so you can diagnose the root problem earlier.\n\nMy hunch is that the majority of users land on the other side (myself included) and want the installation to continue. I see alot of failures happen that are not related. Like one package's url is temporarily down or some other network glich. The full test package I use for boxstarter takes 1 to 4 hours to run depending on the OS and network conditions. It would be frustrating for it to stop 75% of the way in. As long as I have a log of what failed I'm good.\n\nI think it would be important to have control over this with some kind of a SilentlyContinue or StopOnError switch.\n. ugh. that looks like my handywork. will fix tonight.\n. Interesting. Could you provide an example?\n. Agreed. and source too.\n. True. That makes it interesting. and on that note, when we do enable multiple packages (which will be super cool) we should make sure you can pass in package names via the pipeline.\n. It should be be doing that now. Pester will pass an exit code equal to the number of failed tests which Chocolaty will forward. However, until earlier this morning, if the chocolatey build failed somewhere other than the tests, it would not exit with a non 0 code. I fixed that and it should all be good now. Let me know if you see anything otherwise. Thanks!\n. Sorry. I think I misunderstood. I was thinking build failures. I am overly obsessed with tests and builds today.\n. I o not feel it is out of line to require submitters of pull requests to write tests. I know that is not necessarily as ubiquitous in powershell as it is in C# but this is one of the larger bits of powershell out there and it just wont be manageable or fun in any way to write tests on our own. It also helps to raise the bar of the community IMO. :)\n.

Just to comment on the scripts v PS. I would have leaned the same way a year ago before becoming comfortable with PS. Scriptcs sounds awesome as another low friction tool for c# devs to leverage their knowledge. There is no question a good learning curve to get comfortable with PS and you need to use it consistently for it to stick. That said, like any language PS has strengths lacking in c# for scriting. Its dynamic nature and the pipeline are very slick. Of course JavaScript and ruby would have done well here too and engaged a much larger community.\n. Hmm. Interesting. Will take a look thanks!\n.

This is also a good topic for the [google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/chocolatey).\n. I just reproduced this. The key is to make sure you do not open your ps console as admin. I opened a standard ps console on win 8. UAC is enabled (as it will be on most win 8 installs since metro does not work without it) and I did not open as administrator. After invoking clist -source webpi, i was prompted to open a new PS session as admin which opened a new ps window where I saw the wonders of webpi flash before me and alas disappeared just as fast as they appeared. If I remember correctly, there is code that pumps the webpi output to a file and then the original session pulls that output from the file back into its own session. So something there is not quite right.\n. Unless someone has already checked, we should check if the latest webpi cli requires admin privileges to list packages and just remove the elevation if not. I'm also wondering if cinst is equally broken.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: \"Gary Ewan Park\" notifications@github.com\nSent: \u200e5/\u200e28/\u200e2013 9:39 AM\nTo: \"chocolatey/chocolatey\" chocolatey@noreply.github.com\nCc: \"Matt Wrock\" matt@mattwrock.com\nSubject: Re: [chocolatey] clist -source webpi doesn't list commands (itflashes and disappears) (#293)\n\nAh, that makes sense :-)\nI have a potential fix, namely:\n  if ($source -like 'webpi') {\n$chocoInstallLog = Join-Path $nugetChocolateyPath 'chocolateyWebPiInstall.log';\nRemove-LastInstallLog $chocoInstallLog\n$webpiArgs =\"/c webpicmd /List /ListOption:All | Tee-Object -FilePath `'$chocoInstallLog`';\"\nStart-ChocolateyProcessAsAdmin \"cmd.exe $webpiArgs\" -nosleep\nCreate-InstallLogIfNotExists $chocoInstallLog\n$installOutput = Get-Content $chocoInstallLog -Encoding Ascii\nforeach ($line in $installOutput) {\n  Write-Host $line\n}\nWhich does the same thing as the Windows Feature equivalent, but it makes the command VERY slow to execute.

For example the 'Turn Windows Features On and Off\" GUI. However I wouldn't say it is by any means official and I definitely see your point. We would want to implement this so that both terms are accepted to support backwards compatibility.\n. I agree with @gep13 that encouraging users to use a myget feed for personal packages is the way to go. As far as the educational process, certainly including the guidelines in the confirmation email or at least a link is a great idea, but might also consider checking conventions at push time. While we could not know for sure if a user is pushing a personalized package, we could look for dot notation that does not include the standard prefixes and then prompt the user with something like, \"This might not be a package intended for public assumption, personal packages are best kept on other feds like myget. Are you sure you want to push this package?\"\n. True. A CI model would be better. The question is what would a reliable CI model look like for chocolatey packages. This is something I have been thinking about lately. Ideally, it would spin up a VM of a vanilla OS install, run the package and validate that there were no errors (you could get fancier and have package authors include a validation scriptblock). \n\nWith the Boxstarter work that I hope to release this week this is simple:\n\n```\n$result = win7VM,win8VM,server2012VM,server2k8r2VM | \n    Enable-BoxstarterVM -Credential $cred -CheckpointName Fresh | \n    Install-BoxstarterPackage -PackageName myPackage -Force\n$passed=$true\n$result | ? { ($_.Errors.Count -gt 0) -or ($_.completed -eq $false)  } | % { $passed = $false }\nreturn $passed\n```\n\nHowever this requires Hyper-V to be accessible. I'll be adding support to azure and AWS next but compute time is not free unless we could get a cloud provider to sponsor this. I think this could help in raising the credibility of the community feed which i think is one of the biggest road blocks to chocolatey adoption. Imagine adding some anti malware checking on top of that.\n. Currently it assumes the VM to exist and will throw an error if not. After I wrap up azure and AWS and make a few \"engineering debt\" adjustments. I'm gonna start the functionality for injecting installer parameters into an ISO. The MS Hyper-V module provides pretty straight forward means to creating a VM from an ISO. I might add a convenience command to wrap it. \n. Totally agree @ferventcoder I was lazy here just throwing out a proof of concept. For a real test I too always like to assume false.\n. @gep13: It is my sole \"after hours\" project :) The code i have been pushing is largely based on spikes done in September so it has just been a matter of getting it fairly clean and around tests. Thought I was gonna be able to release Sunday night but after running tests in a domain joined environment, enabling WMI is kicking my butt. :(\n. For those interested. I released the Hyper-V functionality last night - http://boxstarter.org/VMIntegration\n. Yeah. That is what I'm thinking to a degree. However, this starts to look like Vagrant and my goal is not to be another Vagrant. If I had more time, I'd love to learn some Ruby and create a Boxstarter provisioner and a Hyper-V and azure provider for Vagrant. Hopefully I or someone else will eventually but I have some other stuff I really want to get to first. But yeah. I think you will likely see a Boxstarter API where you use the same command and pass in a provider string or enum value.\n. Yeah that would be nice. I had started to do that on a related spike a while back and then realized that because it is .net 4, it requires at least PS 3 in order to call directly from powershell.\n\nFrom: Gary Ewan Park [mailto:notifications@github.com] \nSent: Thursday, October 24, 2013 9:24 PM\nTo: chocolatey/chocolatey\nSubject: Re: [chocolatey] Support for version pattern matching (for installing, updating, and specifying dependencies) (#346)\n\nThere is a .Net Class for SemVer in the nuget code base, I wonder if we could re-use that. \n\nSent from my Windows Phone \n\n---\n\nFrom: Rich Siegelmailto:notifications@github.com \nSent: \u200e25/\u200e10/\u200e2013 02:04 \nTo: chocolatey/chocolateymailto:chocolatey@noreply.github.com \nSubject: Re: [chocolatey] Support for version pattern matching (for installing, updating, and specifying dependencies) (#346) \n\nagree with you ferventcoder- that was my understanding. \n\ni think its a metric s-ton of a parsing exercise that probably needs to start with TDD via pester, and make each use case pass... just looking at this readme https://github.com/isaacs/node-semver made my head hurt. \n\n---\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub: \nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/346#issuecomment-27047579 \n\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/346#issuecomment-27060509 .  https://github.com/notifications/beacon/SVpp0Doaws5T1aBsNeEOjuhn4qSMKcvXexQ8DxDMiWxbwLGbXJX0oqylR61aZFj8.gif \n. Agree with Rob that the fx3.5 check would be better placed in its own package. I did this for 4.5 and 4.5.1. Not sure why I did not use the WindowsFeature (especially since win features was my contribution). Maybe this package predates that. \n\nOne small caution on webpi: there are times when webPI does more than simply install what it is advertising and the simpler approach might be to simply install an MSI. I have recently discovered the .net4.0 install to be an example. Simply installing the MSI is faster and simpler and often meets your requirements while webpi makes several DISM calls and does some additional asp.net configuration. This might be what you want but not necessarily if you just need the basic framework BCL. \n\nI was having alot of issues in Boxstarter where the webpi was failing if I disabled windows update first and if I kept it enabled, webpi turns it back on and potentially opens the flood gates of updates that then launch their own MSIEXEC processes that will cause the ,net4.0 msi in webpi to either block or sometimes fail. So the next boxstarter release will simply install the .net4.5 MSI and not use webpi which I have found to be far more reliable. Of course this is an edge case affecting new installs primarily on win7 and intermittently occurring. Each webpi package should be considered on a package by package basis.\n. It is a lot of red. Regarding root cause you might be able to get closer by googling exit code 1620. It would either be a msiexec code or one from the app.\n\nHope that helps.\n\nMatt\n\nSent from my Windows Phone\n\n---\n\nFrom: Redsandromailto:notifications@github.com\nSent: \u200e10/\u200e27/\u200e2013 3:18 PM\nTo: chocolatey/chocolateymailto:chocolatey@noreply.github.com\nSubject: [chocolatey] Errors are thrown two or three times (#357)\n\nWhen packages fail, I see a lot of red text.

I do think that better use could be made of the Write-Verbose, Write-Debug  and debug/verbose preference settings so that the default output is a bit more sparse. I think most installs, given no errors have an acceptable amount of out put. There are places though, where it does feel like the output is not that valuable to the casual user. For example the out put when elevating privileges.\n. A few suggestions:\n- output psobjects to the pipeline with info like success/fail, exceptions, packagename\n- all verbose info that goes to the log should also gk to the console if -verbose is passed or $verbose preference is set to continue.\n. Yeah. In v2.1 I reworked Boxstarter output to this model.\n\nRegarding the verbose output, you can handle this with Write-Verbose or Write-Debug or both. Its not always crystal clear when to use one over the other. I use Write-Verbose but Chocolatey already makes use of Write-Debug and proxies the \"real\" Write-Debug function in order to intercept the output and write it to the log. So as long as you use Write-Debug for all output you want to be logged but NOT displayed, that is exactly what will happen. If the user wants the debug output to print to the console, they just need to set $DebugPreference to \"Continue\". Thats a PowerShell automatic variable and tells PS how to handle Write-Debug. The default value of $DebugPreference is \"SilentlyContinue\" which causes Write-Debug to do nothing (or in Choco's case, JUST log to disk). What makes this tricky for choco are the Batch redirects. Setting $debugPreference to \"Continue\" wil only have the desired effect if calling choco's Chocolatey.ps1 directly because then the choco call runs in the same scope as the caller. Using the batch redirect like cinst creates a new powershell session with the preferences set to the defaults. So you would need to add -Debug parameters to the choco commands that will set the $debugPreference of the choco powershell session to print debug output if specified.\n\nThe PSObjects make parsing and reacting to chocolatey results much more script friendly. Instead of (or in addition to) \n\n```\nWrite-Host \"Chocolatey failed to install $packageName yadayadayada\"\n```\n\nYou have \n\n```\nWrite-Output @{PackageName=$PackageName;Success=$true;Exceptions=$TheExceptionsRaised}\n```\n\nThis means I can inspect the results like so:\n\n```\n$result=Chocolatey-Install MyPackage\nif(!$result.Success){\n   #Do something to deal with the failure\n}\n```\n\nAgain this is tricky due to the batch stuff. I lose the Powershell pipeline since the chocolatey batch file spawns a new PS session. So using cinst or another one of the batch file gateways, $result would not capture the output but I do believe it would at least print the object to the console. Users who want to take advantage of the pipeline would just need to call chocolateys powershell functions directly.\n. Its actually the other way around. Permissins need to be elevated to call DISM. If you already have UAC disabled, thats not necessary but its not what is causing the call to fail. As of win7/win 2008R2, the DISM command can be used to install windows features. I'm not sure what mechanism is used on 2008 SP2. At the least, I think it would be reasonable for choco to detect if your OS version is less than 7/2008R2 and provide a message stating that the WindowsFeature source is not available on your platform. Of course finding the win 2008 SP2 compliant method would be ideal as long as the method is reasonable to implement.\n. looks good to me.\n. Ahh. This is because Chocolatey uses th WebPI installer for .net 4 which in addition to installing .net 4 also sets up asp.net and there by sets up IIS\n\nChocolatey does not need this. Clients like 2008R2 that do not have .net4 installed do need .Net4  to work with Nuget.exe but nothing more. I think it would be a good idea to replace the webpi installer with the vanilla MSI install of of 4.0 or 4.5.1 or at least  4.5.\n. yup. exactly.\n. It really depends on what you are trying to accomplish. Unfortunately it is not always easy to discover the complete ramifications of each method. WebPI is great but I think the creators of the .net4 webpi package were \u201casp.net opinionated.\u201d That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. Getting all the asp.net/IIS stuff right can be tricky and they were likely trying to guide people to make the right choices. However, in the interest of taking control over your environment, I\u2019d personally prefer the more minimal approach.\n\nFrom: Daniel Liuzzi [mailto:notifications@github.com] \nSent: Monday, December 30, 2013 2:44 AM\nTo: chocolatey/chocolatey\nCc: Matt Wrock\nSubject: Re: [chocolatey] Installing Chocolatey adds Web Server (IIS) Role (#399)\n\nThank you guys for your replies. I forgot to mention that along with the Role, I got a few Features installed as well:\n\nRemote Server Administration Tools\n    Role Administration Tools\n        Web Server (IIS) Tools\nWindows Process Activity Service\n    Process Model\n    .NET Environment\n    Configuration APIs\n\nThese were not there before installing Chocolatey. I assume it must the same reason (WebPI adding them when it installs .NET 4.) Now that you bring up WebPI, I remember when I started playing with Chocolatey, I was unsure on which source to use when there are many. For example ASP.NET MVC 3 can be installed from both the default source (i.e. cinst aspnetmvc.install), as well as the from the webpi source (i.e. choco webpi MVC3). I was under the impression the WebPI might be a better choice as it seems more \"package oriented\" than vanilla MSI, so I was using that, but now I'm not so sure. Is the default source better for these cases?\n\nThanks again.\n\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/399#issuecomment-31340715 .  https://github.com/notifications/beacon/655165__eyJzY29wZSI6Ik5ld3NpZXM6QmVhY29uIiwiZXhwaXJlcyI6MTcwMzkzMzA2NiwiZGF0YSI6eyJpZCI6MjI3MTEzMTd9fQ==--c67744b69d3816356f23944e0abe5e56b580293b.gif \n. and technically in this case its for installing the installer to install the installers :)\n. yes. \n\n```\nMock 7za\n```\n.

However -logout seems poorly named to me. The first thing I think of is signing out of something. How about using -Quiet?\n. If you used -Quiet and made the default $false, wouldn't that have the same effect?\n. Yes. I think that is what @jole78 was intending this argument to accomplish and something that I think makes sense - completely silence the \"Host\" stream. I'm assuming keeping the other streams, output/warning/verbose/error untouched is desired since there are already ways built into the PS syntax to silence or redirect those.\n. Interesting. I ran into this exact issue last night. Only happens on a win2k8 AzureVM. I have a 2012R2 VM that works fine. Also, it worked in the morning but has not worked since I got home from work yesterday. I'm thinking it is somehow proxy related. When I turned on fiddler, it went away and I can get to the url in a browser. Blew away and recreated the VM - still broke. I'm planning to troubleshoot further tonight.\n. Both should work, but I think I figured this out. The issue is a combination of how the .net http stack in implemented in v 3.5 and before along with a likely change in protocol or certificate on Github's end. I had to use Wireshark to see the difference. .net3.5 (the version used on win7 and server2008R2) is not handling the SSL client key exchange and just hanging. This can be fixed by calling:\n\n```\n[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = 48\n```\n\n48 is the Enum value for SecurityProtocolType.Ssl3.\n\nI'll be submitting a PR or perhaps just commiting since this is likely a big blocker right now.\n. I sent a PR https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org/pull/72 since even if I did commit, I'm not sure it would go live. \n. It only breaks if using a .net 2/3.5  HttpWebRequest. Works fine in browsers and .net 4+\n. We are not, but that was one of my initial thoughts too. Setting it didn't resolve the issue.\n. I managed to get one packed down to just under 4GB (still huge) using lzma compression:\n\nhttps://vagrantcloud.com/mwrock/Windows2012R2\n\nWon't work for you since it is a hyper-V box and requires a couple recent vagrant PRs I submitted that allow for .vhd format files and a working implementation of SMB on windows guests. I should make a vbox version.\n\nYou can try grabbing the evaluation ISO at http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2012-r2\n. I had to sign the click-once application which is the kinda different. Its the \"delivery mechanism\" of the powershell and it just creates a powershell session, bypassing the execution policy and runs the powershell unsigned.\n\nI do believe that signing powershell does involve an authenticode cert which will cost money.\n.

The menu entry is there by default, and it does appear the particular registry data change is what caused the entry to disappear.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6148201/4111444/eef8f2e6-3208-11e4-9ac7-2fe9ef510a82.png)\n\n---\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/563#issuecomment-54085118\n. I just did a little research and experimentation and figured out the issue. The chocolatey helper uses the DOS commands `assoc` and `ftype` to manipulate the association which in turn edits HKCR registry entries. This is all a bit wonky. For example if you change associations using the windows explorer gui, it changes a different set in HKCU and will give precedence to that. \n\nAnyways the problem with the \"New\" context menu is that when `ftype` creates the new \"content type\" it does not give it a label. The readable text that appears next to each item in the menu. I tried manually adding that to the registry and then the new item appeared.\n\nSo the fix is pretty straight forward. The command will just need to edit the registry entry after calling `fype`. When I wrote the helper, I wanted to avoid direct registry editing and did not notice the missing New context menu item . As I have many times learned, direct registry editing is a core aspect that makes up the joy of windows automation Therefore I will be happily adding a PR to do just that after I slip into something a little more comfortable a little later.\n. Unfortunately there is no argument for adding the label. My hunch is that `ftype` and `assoc` are ancient commands and are not getting much love in later windows versions (but I could be way off here) you cant even call these from powershell directly but have to invoke via cmd.exe. The extra shell is due to the fact that chocolatey has to ensure that the call is run with elevated privileges and invokes in a elevated shell to do that.\n. Just Submitted PR #564 to address this.\n. I'll take a look at tests tonight. I really should have run those locally. \n. Local tests are passing as long as I am using pester v2.0.2. I small just pushed a change to the build scripts that fix an issue if like me one has a version of pester greater than 2.0.2. However I doubt this is why appveyor is failing.\n. all the appveyor failing tests are related to Get-CheckSumValid. Based on the errors it seems like CheckSum.exe is not where Chocolatey expects it to be. Is there a way in Appveyor to browse the chocolatey files that are installed?\n. my PR addresses the exit code but does not rethrow. Honestly I personally prefer actually rethrowing the actual exception. For something like Boxstarter which calls the chocolatey powershell functiuons directly, I can better inspect the exception and provide better logging. I realize that will no longer be possible with choco.exe.\n\nAnother PR I considered was adding more detail to the exceptions logged. Currently chocolotey just captures the error message which is sometimes not very helpful. Doing something like logging:\n\n```\n$_.exception | fl * -force | out-string\n```\n\nwould capture any stacktrace and inner exceptions and even script level stack trace on later OSs. I'm probably gonna hold off on contributing that until the new chocolatey comes out but this is my 2 cents. :)\n\nAlso, chocolatey simply returns an exit code of 1 and it would be better to at least return the original exit code. My PR was just an attempt to \"fix\" what appeared to be the current intent of the code. On the boxstarter side I can always just examine the `$errors` array to grab the full exceptions after the fact. Again, that only works if you are calling chocolatey from powershell and calling the actual powershell functions so you are not crossing any process boundaries.\n. I really like what @juliankrispel is doing here. Even with the goal of running choco on different platforms I like the c: . My guess is that choco will largely be the package manager for Windows apps regardless from where you use it and the c: Drives home that distinction.\n. Awesome work! I like 8 the most.\n.

I could try to work up a Pull Request for something to snapshot the registry areas before/after we install, look at the delta and write an \"$packageName-uninstallkeys.txt\" to the package-folder as you do with msicodes.\n\nA new auto-uninstaller function would use msicodes.txt or uninstallkeys.txt to fill in for any missing tools/chocolateyUninstall.ps1.  A bit dangerous using the uninstallkeys.txt if people ran two installers at once though...\n\nRather than doctoring the uninstall command, I'd prefer the safer option of a garbage collect function to drop choco-packages if their uninstallkeys.txt looked to be missing, but that would be a separate PR.\n. Not so sure about the garbage collection idea, which would need to run whenever queried as to a package being installed - might be a bit slow, will have to see.\n\nStarted work at https://github.com/tyrken/chocolatey/tree/auto-uninstall.\n. Yes - that's the idea.  Currently struggling keeping just the powershell v2 requirement but able to read all reg key areas when running as 32-bit powershell, but getting there.  Do you think it best to do a in-progress PR now or wait until nearer done, a few more days hopefully?\n\nIf someone does a per-user install, then attempts to uninstall a choco package (which has no per-user concept) when running as a different user, I assume bad things could happen.  So I am planning to detect this & abort with message, do you agree?  I could find the correct uninstall string easily & try that, but suspect I'd have to change user to do it safely & don't want to try implementing that.\n. Added https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/420\n. I've hopefully addressed most of this with pull request #420.  If there are MSI based installers which _dont_ create an Uninstall registry key, then I could merge in the code from that old PR #99 to create an uninstall record for them also - but suspect they are rare.\n. The use case starts with a skilled admin user installing the package which downloads the app from a hard-coded Internet URL onto their own (Internet connected) workstation.  After checking it works as intended & incidentally virus scanning it, they would (yes, manually) update the CSV file - there is a hint in the console/chocolateyInstall.log for beginners.  They also have to dump the orginal or redownloaded binary near the CSV as suggested or at a random other location of their choice.  Now other boxes can use the unaltered package without Internet access - chocolatey will now find the url in the CSV it always checks and so fetch from the alternate url.  It's not so much targeting already downloaded on this one box, as for whether it's already been downloaded & blessed in the whole organisation.\n\nPartly this is for simplicity - wanting to avoid getting in WebDAV for HTTP uploads and keeping the code and cache format simple (compared to my work based on MRJ's fork).  Partly as security policy at my firm & I suspect others is that \"new stuff from the Internet\" must only be used via a conscious, non-automated action (no automagic 'it just does it all for you').  The final steps of uploading it to be widely available in the cache folder & updating a CSV can both be secured and audited easily - e.g. stored in git or a repository like ProGet or Artifactory that we would also use for the Nuget source.\n\nYes, this would allow us & other companties to open source more packaging work as we'd embed Internet Urls (not imposing any url mapping on others) in the scripts on github but redirect them when used locally.  We'd also be able to guarentee supply - even if the original url was broken - as it's modeled as a side-loading repository, not an opaque cache that someone might \"clean out\" without a backup.  Finally it would allow semi-skilled admins to monkey-patch in extremis (e.g. slow package update after a security issue).\n\nPre-populating a machine-local cache would also work, but that would mean a hell of a lot of filecopying - e.g. our SQL Server package uses a 2.5 GB download, and many others are 100's of MB - for each version.  That would be pushed to every C drive of every box, want it or not.  I'd much rather a pull model and prefer HTTP over SMB file shares though accept others may not.\n\nI'm prepared to believe not everyone has the security angle I do - but if so, just set up all the boxes with a web proxy server like squid/varnish/whatever & be done with it.  That helps them get to the Internet in general, and you can add caching to the proxy if you worry about Internet bandwidth - simpler & more efficient than any Chocolatey caching system discussed so far.\n. We could rename Get-RedirectedWebFileUrl to \"Map-CSVRedirectedWebFileUrl\", change to a ref param for $url and return a boolean: $true if mapped.  Then make the addition in Get-ChocolateyWebFile call a \"Map-ChocolateyUrl\" similar to your commit, which daisy chains calls to Map-CSVRedirectedWebFileUrl and other similar functions until one returns $true or runs out.  (I'm assuming it would be winner takes all in a fixed order, rather than calling all mappers always.)\n\nFor the smart-script based idea, I haven't tried it but was the point of the extensions functionality to allow packages ending with \".extension\" to contain a psm1 which could override any existing chocolatey framework/helper method?  So if I made a \"mycompany-redirecter.extension\" package, I could embed in it a script to override Map-ChocolateyUrl & do whatever I want.  Not sure if it's possible to still call the original from the extension, but splitting Map-ChocolateyUrl from Map-CSVRedirectedWebFileUrl means you could get that functionality still if you wanted it.\n. Updated broadly as discussed, except the custom PSObject only has one property, newUrl, and it will overwrite the current one if non-null, rather than using a second boolean.  Also, extension methods don't seem to be able to override existing helper methods, so I added a way to run an extra method if defined, e.g. in an extension.\n\nAnd I had to switch back to \"Get-\" rather than \"Map-\" as the latter is not a Microsoft Approved Verb.\n. How about adding fully-automatic uninstall of MSIs?

I could try to work up a Pull Request for something to snapshot the registry areas before/after we install, look at the delta and write an \"$packageName-uninstallkeys.txt\" to the package-folder as you do with msicodes.\n\nA new auto-uninstaller function would use msicodes.txt or uninstallkeys.txt to fill in for any missing tools/chocolateyUninstall.ps1.  A bit dangerous using the uninstallkeys.txt if people ran two installers at once though...\n\nRather than doctoring the uninstall command, I'd prefer the safer option of a garbage collect function to drop choco-packages if their uninstallkeys.txt looked to be missing, but that would be a separate PR.\n. Not so sure about the garbage collection idea, which would need to run whenever queried as to a package being installed - might be a bit slow, will have to see.\n\nStarted work at https://github.com/tyrken/chocolatey/tree/auto-uninstall.\n. Yes - that's the idea.  Currently struggling keeping just the powershell v2 requirement but able to read all reg key areas when running as 32-bit powershell, but getting there.  Do you think it best to do a in-progress PR now or wait until nearer done, a few more days hopefully?\n\nIf someone does a per-user install, then attempts to uninstall a choco package (which has no per-user concept) when running as a different user, I assume bad things could happen.  So I am planning to detect this & abort with message, do you agree?  I could find the correct uninstall string easily & try that, but suspect I'd have to change user to do it safely & don't want to try implementing that.\n. Added https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/420\n. I've hopefully addressed most of this with pull request #420.  If there are MSI based installers which _dont_ create an Uninstall registry key, then I could merge in the code from that old PR #99 to create an uninstall record for them also - but suspect they are rare.\n. The use case starts with a skilled admin user installing the package which downloads the app from a hard-coded Internet URL onto their own (Internet connected) workstation.  After checking it works as intended & incidentally virus scanning it, they would (yes, manually) update the CSV file - there is a hint in the console/chocolateyInstall.log for beginners.  They also have to dump the orginal or redownloaded binary near the CSV as suggested or at a random other location of their choice.  Now other boxes can use the unaltered package without Internet access - chocolatey will now find the url in the CSV it always checks and so fetch from the alternate url.  It's not so much targeting already downloaded on this one box, as for whether it's already been downloaded & blessed in the whole organisation.\n\nPartly this is for simplicity - wanting to avoid getting in WebDAV for HTTP uploads and keeping the code and cache format simple (compared to my work based on MRJ's fork).  Partly as security policy at my firm & I suspect others is that \"new stuff from the Internet\" must only be used via a conscious, non-automated action (no automagic 'it just does it all for you').  The final steps of uploading it to be widely available in the cache folder & updating a CSV can both be secured and audited easily - e.g. stored in git or a repository like ProGet or Artifactory that we would also use for the Nuget source.\n\nYes, this would allow us & other companties to open source more packaging work as we'd embed Internet Urls (not imposing any url mapping on others) in the scripts on github but redirect them when used locally.  We'd also be able to guarentee supply - even if the original url was broken - as it's modeled as a side-loading repository, not an opaque cache that someone might \"clean out\" without a backup.  Finally it would allow semi-skilled admins to monkey-patch in extremis (e.g. slow package update after a security issue).\n\nPre-populating a machine-local cache would also work, but that would mean a hell of a lot of filecopying - e.g. our SQL Server package uses a 2.5 GB download, and many others are 100's of MB - for each version.  That would be pushed to every C drive of every box, want it or not.  I'd much rather a pull model and prefer HTTP over SMB file shares though accept others may not.\n\nI'm prepared to believe not everyone has the security angle I do - but if so, just set up all the boxes with a web proxy server like squid/varnish/whatever & be done with it.  That helps them get to the Internet in general, and you can add caching to the proxy if you worry about Internet bandwidth - simpler & more efficient than any Chocolatey caching system discussed so far.\n. We could rename Get-RedirectedWebFileUrl to \"Map-CSVRedirectedWebFileUrl\", change to a ref param for $url and return a boolean: $true if mapped.  Then make the addition in Get-ChocolateyWebFile call a \"Map-ChocolateyUrl\" similar to your commit, which daisy chains calls to Map-CSVRedirectedWebFileUrl and other similar functions until one returns $true or runs out.  (I'm assuming it would be winner takes all in a fixed order, rather than calling all mappers always.)\n\nFor the smart-script based idea, I haven't tried it but was the point of the extensions functionality to allow packages ending with \".extension\" to contain a psm1 which could override any existing chocolatey framework/helper method?  So if I made a \"mycompany-redirecter.extension\" package, I could embed in it a script to override Map-ChocolateyUrl & do whatever I want.  Not sure if it's possible to still call the original from the extension, but splitting Map-ChocolateyUrl from Map-CSVRedirectedWebFileUrl means you could get that functionality still if you wanted it.\n. Updated broadly as discussed, except the custom PSObject only has one property, newUrl, and it will overwrite the current one if non-null, rather than using a second boolean.  Also, extension methods don't seem to be able to override existing helper methods, so I added a way to run an extra method if defined, e.g. in an extension.\n\nAnd I had to switch back to \"Get-\" rather than \"Map-\" as the latter is not a Microsoft Approved Verb.\n.

The support for symbolic links on Windows is very naive. If you make for example a symbolic link to an EXE and that EXE requires an external library, the symbolic link won\u2019t resolve the relative path to it. This makes symbolic links on Windows unusable and useless in many cases, because many programs require external libraries. Unix-like systems don\u2019t have this limitation.

However I just tried and a hardlink for SumatraPDF was created just fine with an unprivileged user and it works okay as it has no bundled DLLs/resources. I used Far File Manager 3 to create one with <kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>F6</kbd>. I'm not sure what is an API call for that.\n. I mean to give an option for packagers and keep the rest as is. For example, if we know that SumatraPDF.exe does not need anything else at all, I'd prefer to simply hardlink it if it is cumbersome to fix quotes unfolding. Placing `hardlink` into `SumatraPDF.exe.gui` and letting Chocolatey to respect that seems like a reasonable <del>solution</del>workaround.\n. Does `--gui` for _shimgen_ imply no waiting only? I feel like console window still appears. This is somewhat annoying when used often, for example with SumatraPDF and -inverse-search when used with emacsclientw. A window of the latter blinks when jumping from viewer to source.\nWhile hardlinking \"solves\" the issue, I noticed that apparently SumatraPDF in such case creates `sumatrapdfcache` folder withint `C:\\Chocolatey\\bin\\`. I suspect it used to create it in its own folder formerly. I wonder if that might be an issue with multiuser setup when it may lack permission to write.\n.

My point is that it would be nice for a regular user to easily get similar installation on yet another machine.\n\nI was looking for something like\n\n``` awk\n#!/bin/awk -f\n\nBEGIN {\n  print \"<?xml version=\\\"1.0\\\" encoding=\\\"utf-8\\\"?>\"\n  print \"<packages>\"\n}\n\nNR > 3 {\n  if ($1 != \"\") {\n    print \"  <package id=\\\"\" $1 \"\\\" version=\\\"\"  $2 \"\\\" />\"\n  }\n}\n\nEND {\n  print \"</packages>\"\n}\n```\n\nThat can be called from [msys](http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MSYS) like `chocolatey version all -lo | ./version_all-packages.awk > packages.config`. Unfortunately I don't know PowerShell to make it appropriate for Chocolatey.\n. @Nilzor Thanks! However what I meant by _appropriate_ was to introduce a command to `C:\\Chocolatey\\chocolateyinstall\\chocolatey.ps1` that would set `$localonly = $true` and format $versionsObj returned from `Chocolatey-Version 'all'` instead of parsing stdout.\n[Something like this](https://github.com/mlt/chocolatey/compare/gen-packages-config).\n Phew... too much work for a single time operation ;-)\n. I noticed that portable version of SumatraPDF requires double quotation (actually triple as typed) to open files with spaces in path. Is it shimgen at fault? The real SumatraPDF.exe opens everything just fine with ordinary quotation for files with spaces.\n. I feel like it removes one quotation level. For instance, I'd call real SumatraPDF \"some file.pdf\" however I have to SumatraPDF \"\"\"some file.pdf\"\"\" with shim when running, e.g., from Far file manager in either case. It should be similar to regular cmd.exe . I guess \"\" is treated as a single quote when passed down. I noticed that something is not right when pdf association quit working in my Emacs Org mode setup with Chocolatey version of Sumatra.\n. Nope, didn't fix it, if I tested it correctly. I did `cup -pre chocolatey`. It looks like updated things but gave some (partial?) warning that I ignored.\n\n```\nC:\\Chocolatey>dir chocolateyinstall\\tools\\shimgen.exe\n Volume in drive C is Win7\n Volume Serial Number is 986F-B84D\n\n Directory of C:\\Chocolatey\\chocolateyinstall\\tools\n\n04/03/2014  11:41 AM            42,496 shimgen.exe\n               1 File(s)         42,496 bytes\n               0 Dir(s)  787,509,374,976 bytes free\n\nC:\\Chocolatey>where sumatrapdf\nC:\\Chocolatey\\bin\\SumatraPDF.exe\n\nC:\\Chocolatey>SumatraPDF.exe \"C:\\Users\\user\\Documents\\work\\Side Inlets\\slides\\detection\\detection.pdf\"\n```\n\nAnd it failed by opening 2 SumatraPDF windows one claiming it failed to open `C:\\Chocolatey\\lib\\sumatrapdf.commandline.2.4\\tools\\Inlets\\slides\\detection\\detection.pdf` and another one for `C:\\Users\\user\\Documents\\work\\Side`\n. I think in 99% cases NTFS is used that supports links or whatever it is called on Windows.

Can we make it as an option if there is no such dependencies? E.g. create SumatraPDF.exe.gui containing \"ln\" would create a symlink if FS supports it, if the file is empty, then shimgen.\n\nMikhail\n\n> On Apr 5, 2014, at 1:02 PM, TomOne notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> Shall we use that by default and let OS and FS handle all instead of a separate EXE and just fall back to shimgen if no link functionality is available?\n> \n> Do you mean symbolic links? The support for symbolic links on Windows is very naive. If you make for example a symbolic link to an EXE and that EXE requires an external library, the symbolic link won\u2019t resolve the relative path to it. This makes symbolic links on Windows unusable and useless in many cases, because many programs require external libraries. Unix-like systems don\u2019t have this limitation. I think this is also the reason because shims are preferred here.\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Indeed, symlink creation requires privileges. However I just tried and a hardlink for SumatraPDF was created just fine with an unprivileged user and it works okay as it has no bundled DLLs/resources. I used Far File Manager 3 to create one with <kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>F6</kbd>. I'm not sure what is an API call for that.\n. I mean to give an option for packagers and keep the rest as is. For example, if we know that SumatraPDF.exe does not need anything else at all, I'd prefer to simply hardlink it if it is cumbersome to fix quotes unfolding. Placing `hardlink` into `SumatraPDF.exe.gui` and letting Chocolatey to respect that seems like a reasonable <del>solution</del>workaround.\n. Does `--gui` for _shimgen_ imply no waiting only? I feel like console window still appears. This is somewhat annoying when used often, for example with SumatraPDF and -inverse-search when used with emacsclientw. A window of the latter blinks when jumping from viewer to source.\nWhile hardlinking \"solves\" the issue, I noticed that apparently SumatraPDF in such case creates `sumatrapdfcache` folder withint `C:\\Chocolatey\\bin\\`. I suspect it used to create it in its own folder formerly. I wonder if that might be an issue with multiuser setup when it may lack permission to write.\n. ",

The idea I am thinking of is that I only want to set the variable if its the Default or if the User overrides it via the \"Process\" scope environment variable.  Otherwise the variable came from System or User scope in which case an explicit User scoped environment variable doesn't need to be written because something already exists.\n\nDoes that make sense?  I updated the pull request to fix the issue, let me know if there is anything else you would like me to do.\n. I am all for passing parameters, is that possible, seems like a big change?\nThere still would need a fix for explicitly checking for a user scoped\nenvironment var.\nOn Aug 9, 2012 8:42 PM, \"Rich Siegel\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> i'd want to use exclusively system variables. so what do i need to do\n> exactly?\n> \n> is there a problem with passing params to InstallChocolatey.ps1 that this\n> can't be done within it? isn't that what's in the bit.ly url that gets\n> invoked?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/135#issuecomment-7632159.\n. I actually just run my own bootstrap first that configures\nchocolateyinstall and bin_root, then download and install chocolatey. Our\nrequirements are unique such that everything has to come from the inside.\nNo external packages are allowed. The only hangup I had was chocolatey\nlooking explicitly to user var instead of just $env:. This should fix that\nfor now.\n\nThe installer could use some work. The biggest issue is the lack of named\nparameter support for invoking commands, only positional args that I am\naware of with ps.\n\nMaybe a dictionary hash or reference to a simple property file as the only\ninstaller arg?\nOn Aug 14, 2012 9:06 AM, \"Rich Siegel\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> I was shooting for an optional switch if specified, while running under\n> admin that could do it for me :) I have been installing chocolatey on 400\n> servers and I have seen some bizzare issues with environment path\n> modification and powershell putting in 2 semi-colons or none.\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/135#issuecomment-7726761.\n. Can I just ask why, whats wrong with powershell?  Anything you can do in csx you can do in powershell.\n. @rismoney yes, and that ugly code is the same whether in powershell or scriptcs\n\n@ferventcoder by mono I assume you mean *nix or non-windows, and all those systems already have 101 other package managers. Chocolatey only makes sense on windows imo.\n\nNot trying to troll, just trying to understand the motivation, also trying to understand how scriptcs will be accepted.  I would hate to see the default turn into scriptcs when its still so immature.  It takes a lot just to get chocolatey with powershell accepted in an enterprise, I would hate to see more road blocks.\n. In powershell lingo that would be supporting the -WhatIf option all the way\nthrough the tool chain. Its one of my favorite features of powershell.  The\nnice thing is that once its set in a cmdlet all downstream cmdlets should\nauto-detect it, as long as the cmdlet actually supports it and properly\nhandles it.  So things like Output-File, Copy-Item, etc automatically\nsupport it out of the box, it would just be ensuring that all cmdlets in\nchoco actually support and handle the option. I believe this would also\nmean turning all functions into advanced functions and using the\nCmdletBinding(SupportsShouldProcess=true) attribute.\n\nAdam\n\nOn Mon, Apr 8, 2013 at 3:46 PM, Paul Stack notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Hi\n> \n> From my use of puppet, I have become very fond of the --noop command.

When we originally started using nuget to publish our own packages we tried\nto align the package version and content version numbers but quickly found\nthe pain around this.  Based on experience I think its best to keep package\nversion numbers independent or at best just try to align the \"Major\"\nversion numbers.  SemVer is a good standard for package versions to easily\nhandle compatibility of dependencies and upgrades, I don't think its\nmistake that nuget aligned to this scheme.\n\nThe missing link is nuget's inability to have custom metadata, while we\ncould argue adding a \"Content Version\" field could help in these\nsituations, the better solution would be extensible metadata so Chocolatey\ncould handle this issue independent of the nuget team.\n\nAdam\n\nOn Fri, Apr 11, 2014 at 5:22 PM, TomOne notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> @ferventcoder https://github.com/ferventcoder: Yes, but apart from\n> distorting the original version information, the approach of modifying the\n> already existent fourth segment doesn't solve the problem of an\n> accidentally misspelled first, second or third segment.

Don't get me wrong, I am enthusiastic about this and don't mean to be nitpicky! Ofcourse it's not gonna be apt-get all the way.\n\nBut the ease of installing your favourite apps on a clean OS all at once using a single command is arguably one of the most useful and widely used features of a package manager. I've used _apt-get_, _yum_, _aptitude_, _pacman_ and _dpkg_, and they all do this. I guess I automatically assumed it is expected behavior of a package manager.\n\nSorry, I am new to this, I just googled around, found **chocolately** and **npackd**. One of the reasons I chose chocolately first was because I read it was older, so I didn't really think about _not even to v1 yet._ :P\n\n(The other reason is that the Chocolately site is much nicer and has terminal support out of the box. Very nice!)\n\n(Admittedly I installed npackd afterwards to install the packages that had failed in chocolately (like Security Essentials) and/or didn't have a 64 bit candidate.)\n\n(Since Chocolately is much nicer, but npackd fails less often, think of the amount of bases that are belong to you if the projects are merged! ;))\n. Hey you are right. It's a wonder I made it through school, I still don't do my homework right. :P\n\nThanks for the hints. Is powershell different from the normal shell? Could you give an example on how to do the array thing on powershell? It would give me some power before v1 hits the stage.\n\nOn Linux it would be:\n**for N in app1 app2 app3; do cinst $N; done**\n\nNow you mention it, I think it's also possible in normal shell (cmd), probably something like this iirc:\n**FOR %n IN (app1, app2, app3) DO (cinst %n)**\n(This is a reasonably educated guess, cannot test it, am not on Windows now.)\n. By the way, since Chocolately can internally process a list from XML (packages.conf), isn't it relatively easy to implement a feature to use a command-line list?\n\nI imagine the list from XML will end up in an unshifting array or something. I don't know powershell coding but using javascript pseudocode it would be something like this:\n\n``` javascript\n// Use command line multiple input if no packages.conf is specified\nif (arguments.length > 2) // Multiple packages found\n    for (var n=2; n<arguments.length; n++) // From first to last package\n        install_array.push(arguments[n]); // Create installation array\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n```\narguments[0] = chocolately install app1 app2 app3\narguments[1] = install\narguments[2] = app1\narguments[3] = app2\narguments[4] = app3\n```\n. I updated `chocolatey.cmd` to allow batch-installation. It just continues with the next when a package fails, which is what we want, because with the batch-xml I used to do it was **so annoying** that it stopped on error.\n\nHere is the update: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/304\n. `cinst chocolatey -pre`\n. I noticed I did `-beta` sometimes before I remembered to do `-pre`.\nJust a thought: Maybe add `beta` as a synonym for `pre`?\n. True. I hadn't thought of that. It's not as simple as I thought. Monday half brain day.\n. Today I found out Chocolately is actually called Chocolatey. Why did nobody stop me? :P\nI edited the above issue to fix this.\n. @ferventcoder just a thought: Can `all` packages from `cup` all be rerouted through the new batch functionality? I see you also implemented this in cup when multiple packages are mentioned individually.\n. Installing or updating multiple packages at once #304\n. Let me try that again. Personally I don't really care for `packages.xml` (AKA `packages.conf`) anymore, since we have batch functionality (e.g. `cinst package1 package2 packageN`). However, `cup all` also stops on error, and that one is important.\n\n``` cmd\nFinished installing 'ccleaner' and dependencies - if errors not shown in console, none detected. Check log for errors if unsure.\nChocolatey (v0.9.8.21-beta1) is installing 'chocolatey-beta1' and dependencies.

Additional info/packages: all\nReading environment variables from registry. Please wait... Done.\nC:\\Users\\Redsandro>\n```\n\nThe batch install does not stop on error, right? So can `cup all` somehow use the same don't-stop-on-error magic?\n. I concur, but I lack the knowledge and the knowhow to propose a fix. :) I'm\nbetter at making .bat wrappers. :P\nOn Nov 5, 2013 12:17 AM, \"TomOne\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> This is actually a very important issue to solve.

You want to update them all: `cup all`\n\nAfter 4 packages it breaks because the 5th package maintainer made a mistake. You now have 15 packages that are not updated. You have to remember them all, figure out their _Chocolatey_ IDs, and specify each of them manually. This is a show stopper and is bad for business. \n\nNow that package 5 cannot update because of some error, that does **not** mean you suddenly changed your mind about updating the rest of your system.\n\nThis together with the single-install-only limitation (fixed in #191 ) were my biggest annoyances with Chocolatey, and the stopping on error annoyance is the feedback I hear the most. (I install Chocolatey on other peoples laptops, and sometimes I even tell them how it works. ;)) (The other feedback is that packages often don't work, but that's a different problem.)\n\nSure, when a dependency no one (read: typical user) knows or cares about fails, the parent package should fail, obviously. But the rest of the independent packages are still supposed to be updated.\n\n> You are likely to see lots of failures and would prefer to have it simply stop so you can diagnose the root problem earlier.\n\nI can imagine this too, but it's more of an advanced use-case. There should be a command line option for that.\n\n**\"1.0\" takeoff point:**\n-  Do not stop on error. When client says he wants to update all, he wants to update all.\n\n**Ideally:**\n- Skip packages who's dependencies have errors, continue with the rest.\n\n**Advanced:**\n- Command line option for users who want specific behavior: `cup --stop-on-error all`\n. I'd like to see _Chocolatey_ introduced to the masses. I think _Chocolatey_ is meant for the masses in the end. Meant for easy software management.\n\nA famous developer once [said](http://geekswithblogs.net/robz/archive/2013/06/25/career-defining-moments.aspx) about Chocolatey:  \n\n> I want to see Windows be as automatable and awesome as other operating systems that are out there.\n\nThe Windows audience doesn't really mix well with something that breaks and spits out 20 red lines of error. It just wants to see a (final) message: _\"19 out of 20 packages updated. See error.log for details.\"_\n\nA single independent (in Linux we call this top-level) package should not rely on another top-level (TL) package, and neither should be the order in which they are installed or updated relevant. Hence it should not stop on error.\n\nWhen one failing TL package leaves the system in barney for another TL package, said package is in conflict with both logic and the packaging [guidelines](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages#rules-to-be-observed-before-publishing-packages), and should be hosted somewhere else:  \n\n> A package creator should consider whether his package is also useful for others. If that is not the case, it shouldn\u2019t be published on Chocolatey.org. **Reasons for that can be if the package would require a very special configuration** that is unacceptable for other users **or that would lead to serious vulnerabilities**.\n. Let's strife for flawless UX and command line options for specifics. :smile: \n.

Sorry, I didn't notice there was a mailgroup for questions. New questions will be redirected henceforth. \n\nBut let me assure you, I am one of the cleverest people in my subnet (;)), and if I cannot get my custom package to install from source, I'm afraid it's gonna be a problem for other package committing 'noobs' too.\n\nIn response, yes the tutorial is quite comlpete and it does explain how cpack needs to be run first. When someone points out the problem and I get my first package to work, I will, with your permission, add a quick-start guide to the lengthy package creating part of the wiki.\n\nOr could it be a bug in the latest _cpack_ or _cinst_? That would be a fine coincidence, I would have posted my section in the right section after all.\n. I cannot check that right now as I am on the wrong computer, but I used the command that is on the website yesterday: _@powershell something.DownloadString('http://bit.ly/psChocInstall'))_ one. I am assuming it points to the release version.\n. Yes, works nicely. I was gonna make a screenshot, but I bet you believe me when I say it shows exactly the same as mentioned in the above XML code.\n\n-edit- On second thought, the below comment is probably irrelevant.\n\nI made a typo on a virtual machine just now while playing around with it, and I noticed:\n\n**dir**  \n_3.504 tomboy.1.10.2.nupkg  \n1.351 tomboy.nuspec  \n[DIR]          tools_  \n\n**cinst tomboy -source %cd%**  \n_'tomboy' is not a valid version string. Parameter name: version_  \n\n**cinst -source %cd%**  \n_Unable to find package 'tomboy'._  \n\nDon't know if it's relevant, but if the second command cannot find the package, how does it know which package I mean?\n. Oops, that was a mistake on my part posting the output of the _dir_ command here on github, it is the file size from the _cmd.com_ console window.\n\nThe filename is _tomboy.nuspec_ and when running _cpack_ it automatically creates _tomboy.1.10.2.nupkg_. It must be getting those numbers from the nuspec xml file, so _cpack_ reads the version correctly.\n\nHence we're back at the confusing _'tomboy' is not a valid version string_ error message when testing the package.\n. Windows' default shell.\nRun -> cmd [enter]\n. Don't use one. I thought you only need a repo when you push your package.\nSo far I'm getting it to run correctly before I push it.\n\n(Still have to figure out that repo part, the tutorial doesn't really explain that)\n\nIf you have a virtual machine running and you have a minute to spare, you can see if it has the same error message for you.\nhttps://dl.dropbox.com/u/1919923/chocolatey.tomboy.zip\n. Oh yeah I remember the gtksharp message the first time I ran it. I am guessing the package (owned by somebody else) is not gonna be downloaded in testing mode.\nYou should _cinst gtksharp_ on your vm and try again. Now you get the error message.\n. What?? I am at a loss.\n\nThanks for taking the efford to try it out. I was sure you would get the same error.\nWhat sorcery is this?

Same message.\n\nOh yeah I have version 0.9.8.19 of Chocolatey, I figured out from some logs I got on my dropbox.\n. D'oh\nI found the cause.\n\n``` cmd\nC:\\Users\\Redsandro\\Dropbox\\temp\\chocolatey tomboy>cinst tomboy -source \"%cd%\" -debug\n(..)\n'C:\\Users\\Redsandro\\Dropbox\\temp\\chocolatey', version: 'tomboy',\n(..)\nDEBUG: Using '-Source \"C:\\Users\\Redsandro\\Dropbox\\temp\\chocolatey\"' as the source\n```\n\nThe **\"\"** in **\"%cd%\"** would in Linux cause the path to be a single parameter but apparently not in Windows. The space in the pathname caused the failure.\n. Good thought! \nI tried it out and single quote ' also works!\n. Yes, once I complete pushing the package successfully, I will add the steps.\n\nIf I may be so blunt to ask, is this repository you mentioned earlier necessary for this step? If I read the tutorial correctly, I can just get an api-key and push the package. There is no mention of this repository. In the templating system there is mention of filling in your personal repo and an auto-update repo (without further explanation), but the template I used for this .msi package does not require them.\n\nIf I missed repo documentation from the tutorial, you can just provide a link and I will read from there.\n. Ah I get it now. The only thing I ever do is git clone, so I've git some\nreading to do on how to get my stuff up there.\n. Ouch, gotta love that wiki editor. :')\n\nThanks for the help. In return, a Quick Start Guide: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackagesQuickStart\n. What do you mean by second source to the package?\n\nI am pretty sure it works like this (too) because I copied most commands in\na little notepad when I executed them. But maybe I got something mixed up.\n\nIf you are sure and/or have any other changes in mind, feel free to edit\nthe page.\n. I was looking for that quickstartguide I made earlier and couldn't find a link in the main page (CreatePackages) although I am pretty sure I made one.\n\nAfter googling, I found this issue and rediscovered the page through above link.\n\nAm I having a mini-epilepsy-attack and did I never create a reference in the main packaging wiki, or was it removed with good reason?\n\nI (re)created the reference. Of course, feel free to change if the wording is wrong. \n\nMy rationale is this: I (and therefor undoubtedly others too) just wanted to know the basic steps, and looking at the size of the page (scrollbar) made me initially lose interest. That's why I think a new visitor should see that there is a quick start guide in the first a-screens-length of the CreatePackages page.\n\nMaybe I was an idiot and pressed preview in stead of save. Could also be. :P\n. Okay my bad, please ignore. :P\n. -includedependencies would also be a good idea. That would skip more manual\nsteps.\n. Or: **`-source` should not use cache**\n\n`-source '%cd%' -force` should ignore `c:\\ProgramData\\chocolatey\\lib\\%DataIAmClearlyTryingToIgnore%`\n. (I was considering the google group, but I think the last two points should be identified as important issues.)\n. I will break this up for you soonish.\n\nIn the meanwhile, fyi, the space in .exe names is the case for the example (you can download the zip file and see for yourself), except in this case a .bat link doesn't really make sense anyway because you would want it in the start menu where spaces are no problem.\n\nI've seen it another time with a custom build of x264 64bit in the past. The author claimed it would be used within another script using \"quotes\" anyway, which wasn't true for me.\n\nGranted, for command line tools you won't see this often because devs would quickly start to feel silly.\n\nBack in the day, you could type _filena~1.exe_ in stead of _filename with space.exe_, but those days are long gone. ;)\n. PS is there a page on the wiki that explains what this .exe.gui is and does?\n. Ah so it changes the way the .bat shortcut launches the application.\n\nI remember reading that and thinking it had to do with gui-installers that cannot be put in silent mode, to prevent them from hanging the Chocolatey installer window when running in batch mode. Wrong assumption. I get it now.\n\nIn this case there would need to be a _Core Temp.exe.ignore_ and the hypothetical _Core Temp.exe.copyToBinFolderInstead_ and/or _Core Temp.exe.createShortcutInStartMenu_\n. That is good news.\n\nI have been looking for a user variable that links there but couldn't find it. There were a lot of %VARS% linking to folders in 2k/xp, but they don't work anymore.\n\nI thought in your second comment #issuecomment-11463385 you mentioned this was a problem. But if you have a possible solution for the start menu, please tell me. :)\n\nRedirected issues:\n\n#216 -> [Enhancement] Copy/move .exe tools to \\bin\\ folder in stead of creating a .bat file.\n#217 -> [Enhancement] Use custom \\bin\\ folder\n#218 -> [Enhancement] Create link to GUI tool in Start Menu\n#219 -> [Enhancement] Ignore spaces when creating a 'fake' link (.bat file)\n. How about `mklink \"$env:chocolatey_bin_root\\tool.exe\" \"$env:ChocolateyInstall\\lib\\pathToTool\\tool.exe\"`\n(emphasis on **mklink** as a solution) instead of the _.bat_ routine?\n. Yea I missed that. :(\n\nIn that case, I propose functionality that moves tools to the bin folder, for reasons explained above.\n. I don't know if there should be opt-in or just _'package maintainer knows best.'_\n\nExecutable only files without dll's or even config files (e.g. ffmpeg, x264, faad, faac, avs2avi) should pose no problem, with the added benefit of being able to copy or sync the bin folder to usb or cloud and use it anywhere as-is. The library, your uncle's machine, wine in linux, etc.\n. **.bat** feels like a MS-DOS heritage, and it is, but apparently the only difference with the more modern **.cmd** is the behavior of error levels when _\"Command Extensions\"_ are enabled, which I don't know what they are.\n\nI always thought batch files had to be more carefully constructed as to provide some kind of DOS compatibility and command files were a bit more versatile. I guess the biggest difference is psychological indeed.\n. Ah sorry, I come from Linux where `ln` (`mklink`) is not such a big deal.\n\nShouldn't everything be opt-in? Right now creating `.bat` files is opt-out with `.exe.ignore`. We could have:\n`.exe.startMenu` (as discussed in #218 )\n`.exe.moveToBin` or `.exe.copyToBin` (as discussed above, remember to implement #217 )\n`.exe.linkBat`\n`.exe.linkGui` (remember to implement #219 )\n. This would be very straightforward for new users, not like _\"This thing happens magically, that thing has a helper function, and a 3rd thing is done by the installation script\"_.\n. I know this would change some expected behavior in existing package install scripts.\n\nThe solution could be to have a compatible Chocolatey version number in every package. Chocolatey-Installer compares this package Chocolatey version with it's own (see `(1)`). But if none is defined by the package, assume old package and go to a quicks-mode (e.g. automatically assume `.linkBat`)\n\n`(1)` For future solutions, the other way around, if a package was made with a newer version of Chocolatey (i.e. uses new helper functions that are not available in previous Chocolatey versions) than the installed one, Chocolatey could quit the install or update saying _\"You need to update Chocolatey in order to install/update this package.\"_\n. > if your package requires a particular version of chocolatey,\n> you can specify the version requirements in the nuspec\n> it will update chocolatey automatically.\n\nNice! I think it's not in the nuspec template from the repo though. What tag is used for this? I think I'll drop a line about this in the wiki.\n\n> it\u2019s a blow to git on win for sure.\n\nWindows is not very friendly towards anything that is not Microsoft. But I find that the MinGW Git, or better, using Cygwin, work quite nicely.\n\n---\n\nWhat do you guys think of this more unified approach to different types of binary handling as mentioned above: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/216#issuecomment-11621798\n. Also found this: http://windows.github.com/\nDidn't take a close look yet.\n. https://github.com/blog/1151-designing-github-for-windows\n. Added Nuspec details to Wiki.\n\nMaybe you should set a(n old) version of Chocolatey by default in the template:\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolateytemplates/blob/master/_templates/chocolatey/__NAME__.nuspec\n\nIt's the quickest way to tell (new) packagers that it is possible and it matters, if they see it.\n. RE: Unified approach -\n\nIt probably looks easy to you because you know Chocolatey inside out, but for new people, when you have stuff happening implicitly, stuff happening explicitly, stuff happening on command, stuff happening inverted (.ignore), it kinda looks like the national tax system. They say it makes sense, but with all rules and exceptions no one likes doing their tax report.\n\nIt has to look sexy and intuitive to use, that's how you attract more packagers and a bigger audience.\n\nI would even go as far as renaming `chocolatey_bin_root` to `ChocolateyBinRoot` so it has the same naming convention as `ChocolateyInstall`. It has no technical benefit, other than making Chocolatey look happy instead of \"random/messy\".\n\nAnyway it (unified approach) should not get in the way of exactly what you want, because there can be a flag, like `Install-ChocolateyZipPackage --forceBat $packageName \"$zipUrl\" \"$binRoot\"`.\nAnd then we could just as well have `--forceCopy`, `--forceStartMenu` or `--forceGui`, for people who just want to drop their exe in a package and boom, it's in the start menu!\n. Also, can you point me to the script that detects `.gui` and `.ignore`? I can look at it for taking a crack at `.startmenu` and `.copy`.\n. I noticed that the CreatePackages wiki\\* specifically mentions using the _%chocolatey_bin_root%_ environment variable as installation path under **Installation paths** -> **1. %chocolatey_bin_root% environment variable**, but this variable is empty.\n\n*) https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages\n. You are right, but what I mean is: You are advised (by the docs) to pass the variable to the (random) installer if it is supported. But the path is empty by default. Which means you will be explicitly passing an empty path to the (random) installer and who knows how it will be interpreted.\n\nMy first thought is that `%chocolatey_bin_path%` should be set to `%ChocolateyInstall%\\bin` by default the when Chocolatey is installed, so it is never empty and can be edited by the user.\n\nMy second thought is that the current solution is to check if `%chocolatey_bin_path%` empty in the install script.\n\nBut wouldn't it be more logical to have the installer set a default value, rather than have 500+ packages perform this check?\n\nIf not, we should add a comment about checking the var in the docs so it isn't ambiguous.\n. _Added \"Please note that this variable is empty by default, and needs to be explicitly set by the user. Before installing to %chocolatey_bin_root%, your installation script should check if this variable is not empty.\" to wiki._\n. I have the feeling that people who are not working on the code but do care about packages and documentation miss out on the good stuff. :P\n\nHowever, there is no such file in functions: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/tree/master/src/functions\nCan you point me to the right direction?\n\nI want to see if it will daisychain with Install-ChocolateyZipPackage (or maybe is does that automatically).\n. Ah now I see.. the function doesn't exist yet. I'm slow. :P\n. I'd like to reference this post about env vars and finding the bin path as it is closely related to this issue:\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/221#issuecomment-11603183\n\n**Quote:**\n\nIs `$env:ChocolateyInstall` automatically set when Chocolatey is installed? Because we can use something like:\n\n``` PowerShell\nfunction Get-BinPath {\n    # Calculate $binRoot, which imo should always be set in $env:chocolatey_bin_root as a full path (not relative)\n    if($env:chocolatey_bin_root -eq $null) {\n        $binRoot = \"$env:ChocolateyInstall\\bin\"\n    }\n    # My chocolatey_bin_root is C:\\Common\\bin, but looking at other packages, not everyone assumes chocolatey_bin_root is prepended with a drive letter.\n    elseIf (-not($env:chocolatey_bin_root -imatch \"^\\w:\")) {\n        # Add drive letter\n        $binRoot = join-path $env:systemdrive $env:chocolatey_bin_root\n    }\n    else {\n        $binRoot = $env:chocolatey_bin_root\n    }\n    return $binRoot\n}\n```\n. If the Chocolatey installer would set `$env:chocolatey_bin_root = \"$env:ChocolateyInstall\\bin\"` the effect would be the same, but more straight-forward for the user to change the bin location because the default is set rather than made up by the package if it does not exist.\n\nThese are just thoughts based on things I found confusing as a new user.\n. The first part is explaining how the Install command works as it is now. The second part explains something I cannot do. What part do I need to explain in a different way?\n\nCan you provide an example or link to documentation for all three?\nI haven't seen documentation on this. I will add them to the quick guide.\n- Unzip location\n- Partial unzip\n- (!) Make link in start menu\n. Ah thanks. I see partial unzip is limited for my purposes. So I mentioned it in another Enhancement #220, maybe it can be file-specific.\n\nWow I see it's actually quite powerful, being able to add file associations and pin stuff. I haven't found the specific start menu functionality yet, but pinning is close in essence.\n\nOnce I figure out specific stuff I will add it to the documentation under \"examples\" or \"common tricks\", because if it's easier for others to make packages, there is a bigger chance of more people making packages, which (in my opinion) is good. :)\n. I think this comes really close: _https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/tree/master/src/helpers/functions_\n\nI think only `$desktop` needs to change in:\n\n``` powershell\n$desktop = $([System.Environment]::GetFolderPath([System.Environment+SpecialFolder]::StartMenu))\n```\n\nAs seen in this documentation: http://www.programmersheaven.com/2/Les_CSharp_15_p2\nOf course renaming $desktop to something sensible like $start\n\nBut I'd need someone who actually understands Chocolatey and Powershell to test this and create a directory in the start menu called Chocolatey so Chocolatey-installs won't clutter the root of the start menu, which I don't know how to do.\n\nAm I overlooking something?\n. Nope, swamped too. :( And not enough Powershell knowledge (yet) to fix things within an acceptable timeframe. I think it would take me literally 10 times longer than someone who understands both Powershell and Chocolatey well.\n\nI really hate Powershell, because I have such a hard time reading it.\n\nPHP, Javascript, Python, they are all very natural and there is hardly a learning curve. You often get what is going on by looking at it for the first time.\n\nBut Powershell is **pure syntactic salt**, line for line.\n\nWhen I look at Powershell, almost every single line makes me feel like I have dyslexia. Last time a Microsoft language looked acceptable to me was when I was typing MSX-BASIC.\n\nOkay, end of rant. :)\n\nNice find in the link though!\n. It might be good to have the work of getting the wanted bin path in a separate module, so we can use Get-BinPath (or whatever) for any purpose, not just installing a tool.\n\nWhat does the referenced `$(Split-Path -parent $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Definition` actually do? In my powershell I get a spacebar.\n\nIs `$env:ChocolateyInstall` automatically set when Chocolatey is installed? Because we can use something like:\n\n``` PowerShell\nfunction Get-BinPath {\n    # Calculate $binRoot, which imo should always be set in $env:chocolatey_bin_root as a full path (not relative)\n    if($env:chocolatey_bin_root -eq $null) {\n        $binRoot = \"$env:ChocolateyInstall\\bin\"\n    }\n    # My chocolatey_bin_root is C:\\Common\\bin, but looking at other packages, not everyone assumes chocolatey_bin_root is prepended with a drive letter.\n    elseIf (-not($env:chocolatey_bin_root -imatch \"^\\w:\")) {\n        # Add drive letter\n        $binRoot = join-path $env:systemdrive $env:chocolatey_bin_root\n    }\n    else {\n        $binRoot = $env:chocolatey_bin_root\n    }\n    return $binRoot\n}\n```\n\nIt would make packages with extra sorcery (like Install-ChocolateyExplorerMenuItem) a lot easier.\n. Huh? You don't have to define a `version` in `chocolateyInstall.ps1`?\n\n``` PowerShell\n$name = 'rismoney'\n$url  = 'http://www.rismoney.com/rismoney-v1.0.2_setup.exe'\ntry {\n    Install-ChocolateyPackage $name 'EXE' '/SILENT' $url\n    Write-ChocolateySuccess $name\n} catch {\n  Write-ChocolateyFailure $name $($_.Exception.Message)\n  throw\n}\n```\n\nIs all. You just edit the `url` and the `nuspec` on update. Am I missing something?\n. But that one is not predictable, we do not know if the next one is gonna be called `1.0.3`, `1.1.0-unicode`, or has a different name/url than before. So we would always need to change that manually.\n\nMaybe I'm not aware of another function/reason that requires keying in this version somewhere else except for the software download path. In that case, I am sorry for providing my two cents. :)\n. Git is confusing (to a newbie), This is a separate change but it's automatically added to this pull-request.\n\nI thought a pull-request was a request to verify and merge the changes that were made up until the pullrequest was done, but I need to create a new branch for every different change?\n\n@rismoney Thanks for the help, but what do you mean by _\"Change the bottom 4 commits to fixup instead of pick\"_?\nAlso, I'm especially interested in preventing this. I thought a pull meant an exact replica from the root of the folder.\n\n@ferventcoder With this latest commit you can repair your `foobar2000` package. I am succesfully using it for a new `Rename Master` package but it's not for the public yet because it requires the first (bunch of) commits.\n\nCheck it out. Usage:\n`$url = Get-FilenameFromRegex \"http://www.foobar2000.org/download\" '/getfile/([\\w\\d]+)/foobar2000_v1.1.18.exe' 'http://www.foobar2000.org/getfile/$1/foobar2000_v1.1.18.exe'`\n\nIt could even automatically install the latest version if you regex a second match around the version number, but there is a limitation in `Get-FilenameFromRegex` that makes it replace the first match only, but that is probably easily fixed by someone more seasoned with PowerShell development. :P\n. This stuff about branching.\nSo much to learn, so little time..\n. So I should fork my own master so I can play around without affecting this pull-request, and fork it everytime I do a pull-request, right?\n\nHow does this actually work in regards of Chocolatey? Do you check/accept/reject requests when a new version is about to come out? Should I send these requests to other forks by people who also worked on the original files?\n. I see. Thanks for explaining. I'll leave 'my' master alone for now until I figure out how to do all that branching and merging and master mirroring without screwing it up and getting my paths mixed.\n\nI have fulltime work too. Js developing mostly. I just look like a noob all the time because\n- I am new to PowerShell (and I find it syntacticly horrible)\n- I am new to GitHub (using it for code anyway)\n- I am new to Chocolatey/NuGet, and I like to commit while spending the least amount of time possible actually understanding the inner workings of either of them, while still adding value in the form of packages or helpers.\n. Splitting pull requests\n. This thing has not made it in yet?\n. Also fixed Dutch language\n. I was wondering, is the `Start Menu` directory in Windows translated internally from English to the locale, or vice-versa?\n\nIf so, this becomes a hell of a lot easier:\n\n```\n  $appData = [environment]::GetFolderPath([environment+specialfolder]::ApplicationData)\n  $destPath = Join-Path \"$appData\" \"Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\\"\n  $destLink = Join-Path \"$destPath\" \"Name Of Target.lnk\"\n\n  $shell = New-Object -comObject WScript.Shell\n  $shortcut = $shell.CreateShortcut($destLink)\n  $shortcut.TargetPath = Join-Path \"C:\\Path\\To\\Binary.exe\"\n  $shortcut.Save()\n```\n. A reminder that the old version that only works on English systems is still unfixed one year later:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/helpers/functions/Install-ChocolateyPinnedTaskBarItem.ps1\n. bump\n\n2015 alert. We need this.\n. Where is the discussion about this? You might be right, but I have no\nrecollection of year old decisions. :P\n\nAnyway, this needs to be automated in installZipPackage, where a lot of GUI\ntools now get a command-line shim when they would actually need a start\nmenu entry.\nE.g. SomeGraphicalTool.STARTMENU creates a user-friendly entry in Start\ninstead of a power-user Shim.\n\nThere are a lot of new packages with GUI tools that (automatically) create\nshims, making these packages valid for power users only. There needs to be\nan easy way to have shims for the really nerdy tools, and start menu\nentries for packages that average users might want to have pre-installed on\ntheir laptops.\n\nOp vr 17 jul. 2015 om 14:00 schreef Rob Reynolds notifications@github.com:\n\n> I thought we decided to prefer Install-ChocolateyShortcut over this -\n> https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/blob/master/src/chocolatey.resources/helpers/functions/Install-ChocolateyShortcut.ps1\n> ?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/228#issuecomment-122256001\n> .\n.

Can I assign myself to this?\n. I wanted to attach the pull request here but I guess that's not possible or I am still too new with GitHub :P But here:\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/231\n. The idea is to write less code, not more ;)\n\nAlso, the idea is to make sense for people less tech-savvy but with a wish to make packages. Like my grandma. She would like to make packages, and she called me three times, worried about words like `processorAddressWidth`. She thought it would have to be measured in centimeters haha, silly woman. She knows what bits are though, because 30 years ago she had `System 1` _8 bits_. She also complained that it was renamed to Macintosh _128k_ a few years later, saying it was confusing.\n\nSeriously though, I named the function `Get-ProcessorBits` in the pullrequest. Get two people to agree with you and I'll change it.\n. Closed with unmerged commits. Can I delete the branch?\n. Okay, the Redsandro:getSystemBits  branch has been deleted.\nGithub proposed this, but I'm still a bit foggy on Git and what impacts what so I needed to ask to be sure. :)\n. _Gep13_ said:\n\n>  I believe that this may also solve Issue 218 as well:\n> #218  \n\nThis adds a shortcut to the desktop which does not make the application appear in the Windows 7 or Windows 8 start menu. It is not indexed for searching. \n\nThis https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/228 allows pinning to start. I use it in my own installers, but this should really be included in Chocolatey imo.\n\nI think it'd be best to encourage packagers to do pin to start anything that is _not_ a _command line tool_ as discussed here: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/305\n. I am still unsure about what you mean in the description, but once I do, I can add this to the pull request.\n. Also, I am not sure if this is partially related, but I would like a \"pkgSource\" INSIDE the `nuspec`. That way, a simple package update only requires one file to be edited instead of two.\n\nOh yeah, and if this is going to be an environmental variable, the very essence of #306 is to keep a global naming convention, so this parameter should be `$env:ChocolateyPkgRoot` or `ChocolateyPackageRoot`.\n\nLet's keep all the Chocolatey related env vars in that tiny little \"windows env viewer\" prepended with \"Chocolatey\".\n. Apart from that, is it possible to add a custom property to the nuspec and have the value in the .ps1 install script?\n. I think it should warn though, if something like that is possible.\n\n_Could not package your package because .NET is not installed._\n. I believe running `nuget` actually sais dotnet is missing, but the `cpack` command fails silently. No mention of anything went wrong.\n. I removed the dependency for now in order to get the package to install on my testing VM, so I could push a  new version of [Rename Master](http://chocolatey.org/packages/renamemaster/3.4).\n. I don't fully understand what you are saying because this dependency thing worked before and it had the same source. But if I understand correctly, it's something that is planned to be fixed.\n\nUntil then, better no chocolatey dependencies?\n. Ah I see, thank you for clearing that up!\n. Appended your explanation to the Wiki: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages#testing-your-package\n. The problem is fixed for the website and feeds if people just use html characters, like `&micro;Torrent`.\n. If it works, then I am happy.\n\nBut personally I find it more important that all these _\"trashy\"_ looking packages show up nicely on the site. \n\nAll these \"???\" failed encoding symbols degrade the _perceived_ quality of packages or the whole Chocolatey system for users.\n\nSo if every maintainer would just fix those ???'s into proper encodings **until** it is no longer necessary, no one will notice the encoding is screwed up under the hood.\n. Okay, that sucks.\n\nBut the fact is, this unicode thing doesn't work. _It should,_ but it doesn't. Only ansi.\n\nI'm concerned about the page looking wrong. So for now, packagers shouldn't use unicode characters. Use (C) (R) u etc. in stead.\n\n![Failed characters](http://i.imgur.com/UMCgQgQ.png)\n. I didn't know that, thanks for looking it up.\nSo these problematic packages have a nuspec that was saved with improper encoding.\n\nYes, please add a note to the wiki. :)\n. ![Geany Editor Encoding](http://i.imgur.com/cUcaNDz.png)\n. You recognize Geany. That's cool! :smile: \n. Wow, that's elaborate.\n\nI've added a line to the [guide for people who don't like reading](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackagesQuickStart):\n- You **must** save your files with _UTF-8_ character encoding without BOM.\n\nIf you anchor your character encoding paragraph, I can link to it.\n. Speaking of wiki rules, those rules are annoying to read for people who have ~~sexdaily~~ dyslexia or otherwise have difficulty reading.\n\nIt is pragmatically clever to have every basic rule summarized within the rule and **bold** that section.\n\nE.g.:\n\n> - Packages of software that is illegal in most countries in the world are prohibited to publish on chocolatey.org. This applies in particular to software that violates the copyright, pirated software and activation cracks. Remember that this also affects software that is especially designed to accomplish software piracy.\n\nCould be:\n\n> - **Don't package illegal software.** Packages of software that is illegal in most countries in the world are prohibited to publish on chocolatey.org.

I have no _\"ANSI as UTF-8\"_ option, only _\"UTF-8 without BOM\"_\n\n![Notepad++ encoding](http://i.imgur.com/RZDUqgL.png)\n\nVersion 6.2.2 Build Nov18 2012. (year old)\n. Oh you're right! It goes back to ANSI.\n. Documentation is important, especially for new people. Who get a first impression. So I got a few suggestions if I may. :smile: \n- Provide an easy solution that does not scare away potential new packagers\n- Provide links when obvious. \n- ~~Always write Chocolatey with a capital, just like God.~~ hmm oops I guess this is not the case on the website.\n- A sidebar-like **note** should not be a bullet point. Bullet points should illustrate must-read important points. Notes should be optional and clearly separated from a rule list. (Dyslexia approved documentation)\n\nSuggested edit that implements all of these:  \n\n---\n\n## Character encoding\n\n**Either:**  \n- **Do not use _non-`ASCII`_ characters.**  \n\n**Or:**  \n- **Use the UTF-8 character encoding** for the `*.nuspec` and `*.ps1` files. If you don\u2019t respect this rule, some characters are not displayed correctly in the [Gallery on Chocolatey.org](http://chocolatey.org/packages), because the Gallery assumes `UTF-8`.\n- **Do not save your `*.nuspec` files with a Byte Order Mark** (BOM). A `BOM` is neither required nor recommended for `UTF-8`, because it can lead to several issues.\n- **PowerShell scripts need to be saved in UTF-8 _with_ `BOM`.** PowerShell is ignoring the standards and needs a `BOM` in order to recognize scripts as `UTF-8`. Otherwise it processes non `ASCII` characters incorrectly. \n- Don\u2019t use the default Windows Editor. In addition to its lack of features, it can\u2019t even save `UTF-8` files without `BOM`. Alternatives:\n  - [Notepad++](http://chocolatey.org/packages/notepadplusplus)\n  - [Geany](http://chocolatey.org/packages/geany)\n- **You have to specify the `UTF-8` encoding** in the first line of your `*.nuspec` files like so: `<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>`.\n\n**Note:** There is a lot of confusion in the world of character encodings: For example, `ANSI` is an incorrect term for the internal Windows character encodings, e.g. `Windows-1252`. But you should not use this encoding family anyway. In addition, Notepad++ incorrectly uses the term _ANSI as UTF-8_ for `UTF-8` encoded files without a `BOM`. If you select `UTF-8` in Notepad++, it means `UTF-8 with BOM`. Therefore Notepad++ must show `ANSI as UTF-8` in the statusbar.\n\n---\n. > Good suggestions, except this one\n\nWell, I bet 95% of package maintainers (including myself) never gave it a thought and everything works as long as you stick to `ASCII` characters, because the encoding doesn't really matter then.\n\nSo, in practice (practice trumps theory) it's a proper and within packages widely used solution until you are a seasoned packager and want to do crazy stuff like:\n\n## \u03bcTorrent, \u00a9 2013 bitTorrent\u2122\u00ae\n. @TomOne: Thanks! :)\n\nAlthough I disagree with your story. Meet Hank. Always in a hurry. Dyslexic. Hates reading. Hates editors. Hates Windows. Doesn't care about other people's mess, but cares about end user quality.\n\nWill he be scared away by half a page of encoding guidelines, or will he be saved by a simple rule to keep in mind?\n\nThe fact is, there are many Richard-like package maintainers on Chocolatey.org. Without them, Chocolatey would be worth less. Hank-like packagers are better than Richard-like packagers.\n\nDon't chase away net quality improving Hanks. :runner: \n\nLet's agree to disagree.\n. Yes I know the docs, I run Debian myself. :bowtie: \n\nBut I would never be a Debian packager. Their process is why many popular software isn't packaged for Debian. That's why there has been an ITP (intent to package) of `Ubuntu One` for 5 years now and it still isn't there. `FreeFileSync` has been ITP for 3 years and never seen the light.\n\n> I\u2019m glad that I\u2019ve never met such a person. :smile:\n\nWell I might have exaggerated a bit, but here I am.\n\nLike Hank, I care about the quality of the user experience. Not about rules for the sake of rules, when it is proven that 9 out of 10 packages work fine when ignoring them. My packages are awesome, and apart from one*, they are all just default ANSI and no one will ever notice or care or have a problem with them.\n\n*) Hence my rule, for this one package your rules applied, and now it works fine too. User experience quality: 100%.\n\n(TBH I made one mistake in one package about guidelines but that one is unlisted now.)\n\n> Don\u2019t tell me that almost all Windows users are like Richard or Hank.\n\nI didn't say that. I said that _there are many Richard-like package maintainers on Chocolatey.org_ which is an exact quote from you. To prove my point. That if everyone would share my opinion, Chocolatey's supply would be higher quality than it is today, because Hanks care more than Richards.\n\nAnd to make it more fun, I actually think most Windows users _are_ Richards. Certainly not all. There are a lot of Bobs. Only the above-average Windows user will even know/use/package (for) Chocolatey, and you said it yourself: _there are many Richard-like package maintainers._ Imagine how many Richards there are in the entire pool of Windows users.  :scream: \n\n(Just to clarify, I'm contradicting you because I don't agree, but in no way do I want to imply that all Windows users are Richards. All devs are awesome. Windows devs are even more awesome because they have to dig through those weird Microsoft syntaxes. :stuck_out_tongue: )\n\n-edit-\n\nSame thing happened with the multipackage installation code I proposed. ferventcoder totally rewrote it in clever ways inside the vbs in stead of outside. But for the user experience the end result is the same. It's a great addition either way.\n\nLet's just say we all care about _something_ and we should applaud that. Am I wrong? :wink: \n. Microsoft chose `ANSI` and by `ANSI` they meant `Windows-1252`. I don't know if that's part of an _\"embrace, extend and extinguish\"_ strategy, but when I am on a Windows machine, it's the law.\n\nThey made that a default, and when I use that, everything works. Except for characters that you don't find on MSX-Basic either. So I don't use them. Windows doesn't care because it doesn't need to decode characters. As long as you don't use characters that need decoding.\n\nIt is extremely simple.\n\nYou are seriously comparing this to total chaos?\n\nI'm gonna write my next package in Notepad.exe and no one will notice. :smiling_imp: \n. Your Internet Explorer analogy is flawed. If there's one thing I keep repeating I care about most, it's user experience. Stay away from IE! :smile: \n\nI don't see how you don't get it. Fact: Most packages work perfectly. Fact: Most packages don't have or need character encoding because they don't need character decoding. Fact: If you do need decoded characters, you have to take care of character encoding.\n\nThese are the facts, so I am factually right, although you can disagree with my opinion about the thoughts that surround it.\n\nSo again, agree to disagree, or be wrong. Your choice. :P\nFor the rest, I'm not interested in discussing the matter any further.\n. Agreed, but when maintainers notice they 'suddenly' have a character problem, they should _want_ to read the guidelines in more detail and discover what is happening and fix the problem. If not, we give them a yellow card. :P \n. I don't think that will work. Once you save your file in standard (according to Windows) encoding, the character becomes unreadable when you reopen the file. But when I change encoding to utf-8, the char remains unreadable. I have to enter it again.\n\nBut if it will work, it's clever. What are computers for? To make our lives easier. :)\n. Once certain characters are \u25a1, _like \u25a1Torrent \u25a12013 bitTorrent\u25a1_, you can't get them back from a conversion.\n\nBut if you say there's no problem, I'm not gonna argue. I'd love to have `cpack` take care of this!\n\nI \u25a1 Unicode.\n\n-edit-\n\nI just tried. If you save it directly and load it directly, there is no problem. But if you save your package to a git repository, load it on a different machine and _then_ push it, it's already too late.\n\n-edit-\n\nOr something. I have had this, but am not exactly sure what step causes this.\n. This I like.\n\nAlthough I always thought `cpack` was just a reference plus some alternate configuration to the `nuget pack` binary. Customizing and compiling binaries seems like a difficult thing. But it's too far from my bed so what do I know. :) \n. This is clever. But also pretty far-fetched in my opinion. And by that I mean that no Windows packager with a right mind will have a bash interpreter running.\n\nI don't mean that as an insult because according to those rules, I don't have a right mind either. :P \n. Disregard my earlier message. I was thinking in terms of the `cpack` pipeline. I thought you were working towards a solution for all packagers from which there is no escape, preferably without them even knowing. :)\n. @TomOne [UTFCast Express](http://www.rotatingscrew.com/utfcast-express.aspx) might be relevant to your interests.\n\n(Did not use, just stumbled across)\n.

All I care about is that the `unicode` characters show properly in packages and on the website/gallery.\n\nThey don't by default (when using `BOM`).\n\n@TomOne figured out a set of rules to follow that makes the packages end up nicely with all unicode characters in the _chocolatey gallery._ Personally, I don't care or understand too much about the theory behind this. I do however know that it doesn't work properly if you don't follow this advise.\n\n## But\n\nIf you are saying that this is also possible with a simple fix in `cpack`/`cpush`, I'm all for that.\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/functions/Chocolatey-Pack.ps1  \nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/functions/Chocolatey-Push.ps1\n. Sweet! Are you sure you ignored all the 'rules'?\n\nDid @ferventcoder update things? Can you verify, @TomOne?\nIf anything, the instructions are sexier if we don't need the encoding hackery.\n. @jberezanski and @svnpenn were right to raise the issue. I guess the character guidelines are obsolete.\n. Anyway, I strongly encourage you to merge this (and port it to the monolith if you want, but merge it first). When you do this trick on a random strangers laptop, they become so happy, you get instant Chocolatey fans. But it won't work if they install Chocolatey on someone elses laptop. Until this is merged, that is. ;)\n. Nope, it works fine here. Single packages are handled exactly as before. I just installed putty to confirm your response but I had no problem. This is Windows 7 Home Premium with .NET 4.0.\n\n`cinst.bat` is shorthand for `chocolatey.cmd`, and that is the one I changed. 99% of people will use cinst. 0,9% of people will use `chocolatey.cmd` And you want to hold off the update to accomodate for the other 0,1%? (PS Don't get offended by my exaggeration skills, that's just how I communicate. ;) )\n\nAnd your pipe example is a totally bad unintuitive crazy kinda Chocolatey-will-never-get-popular-this-way language construct IMO. I just want to see this Chocolatey be more like... well, every other package manager out there in the Linux world so that you can actually guess how it works.\n\n`apt-get install geany firefox vlc chromium libreoffice filezilla`\n`yum install apache2 php mysql vsftp mongodb`\n`chocolatey install 7zip vlc putty GoogleChrome firefox filezilla`\n`cinst 7zip vlc putty GoogleChrome firefox filezilla`\n\nThere I fixed it. You're welcome. ;)\n. Are you running windows XP or an older .NET? Or did you make an accidental typo when trying my code?\n\nBecause if it is the former that does not like the code, I can rewrite the batch in MS-DOS style. Uglier but maybe more compatible? (I'm just guessing here) I thought XP already did work with the 'new' syntax though.\n. One last thing, I am not _\"Relying on the count of params\"._ It just batches all params one by one.\n. Oh! I misunderstood you! You are correct. Let me get back to you when I am\nnot asleep. My mistake. I got a solution.\nOn Jun 26, 2013 6:49 AM, \"Rich Siegel\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> i am not using alpha version (which is the one on github iirc)\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/304#issuecomment-20027033\n> .\n. You were absolutely right. When you said _\"cinst putty -Version 0.62.0.1 works before this change but not after.\"_ I thought you just mentioned the version of putty as a courtesy to me to be able to verify, instead of meaning an actual command. I should have picked up on the minus sign, but you can also use `backticks` to minimize confusion.\n\nHaving said that, I now remember why I didn't push this mod in the first place when I made it: Although I personally don't care about version management and just ignored it - I only use Chocolatey to batch install 30 apps on a clean system for others, and additional apps for myself although I rarely use Windows - I know I purposely ignored the rest of the commands and _that_ is why I shouldn't push this. I just forgot about it after a long time.\n\nHowever, I do seriously mean that this feature is **absolutely invaluable** to the point that I'd rather create a custom installer for myself and everyone I recommend Chocolatey to, than wait 15 months for someone to port this to `ps`.\n\nOn a more positive note, I just fixed all the problems in my latest commit. :) You can now either install multiple packages, or give commands using -wildcards as specified in `chocolatey /?`.\n. Single:\n\n``` cmd\nC:\\Users\\Redsandro>cinst notepadplusplus\nChocolatey (v0.9.8.20) is installing notepadplusplus and dependencies. By installing you accept the license for notepadplusplus and each dependency you are installing.\n______ notepadplusplus.install v6.3.3 ______\n# blah blah\n```\n\nAdded commands (works with all commands):\n\n``` cmd\nC:\\Users\\Redsandro>cinst notepadplusplus -version 2.24.1\nChocolatey (v0.9.8.20) is installing notepadplusplus and dependencies.

As far as I know, `$command` is always the first and `$packageName` is always the second, because they are not used as `wildcards`. I don't think that `ps` does automatic shifting if the first is actually `$version` but is extracted.\n\nI think this is pretty rock-solid. But in the end you can break everything if you want it to, especially this hideous thing called `powerscript`. But this implementation does everything **the way `chocolatey /?` says** it is done. At least as far as I have tested.\n. Also, don't underestimate the power of `cmd`. The `ps` does not require fixing. But you're right I'm curious to others' opinions too.\n\nI do know the opinion of non-technical users. It has astounding similarities with the last sentence in the chorus of _Thrift Shop_ by _Macklemore_.\n\nAs a final exposition I would like to constrain how much added value this is to normal users. And we're all busy people, the smallest `ps` features take forever to get in mainline.\n\nThe reason that I am pushing this so vividly is that I had four people applaud enthousiasticly this Chocolatey trick I did, and when they mention they want to implement that in their own workflow, I have to explain that I'm using a custom version and they need to copy my _blabla.cmd_ to _yaddah yaddah_ (translated into how they perceive my instructions) and they are like: Wut? http://goo.gl/OdpNo\n. Wow, it's handy to know powershell. :P \n\nDetails are very important. Details can even make an overpriced turd popular. Just look at Apple Inc. That's why I'm seemingly nitpicky, but please understand it is only because I care. :)\n\nThat said, this is a big step forward. But it's still unintuitive-ish. These days, smartphones come without a manual because everything is tackled in the simplest feasible decimation. People (can) rely on that. Not needing comma's is a smartphone that doesn't need a manual. Otherwise we'd have to explain in the manual: _We know the 10 most popular package managers use space delimited package lists for batch installation, but we need a comma separated list because [insert reason the user doesn't really care about]_.\n\n**Especially if you promote Chocolatey as _\"like apt-get\"_.**\n\nI know, semantically _\"like\"_ allows for variations. But that's not how the world, users from the three most popular distro's that use apt-get, and google, work.\n\nWe can probably use both btw. Just putting it out there.\n. > this requires comma between package names.  \n\nTemporarily? :P\n\nComma is inherent to powershell array afaik so I'm not sure how you propose to do that, but that last comment makes me happy. :)\n. That simple huh.\n\nBy c# replacing ps, do you mean you want to rewrite the entire monolith?\n. I don't understand the consequences of removing something that needs to stay in, but this is a huge step in the usability of Chocolatey! I am happy.\n\nAlthough I didn't test anything (already got a working batcher in place ;)) so I don't know if those **rismoney** testcases will hold up.\n. So once **rismoney** approves, I suggest uploading a new release as soon as possible. YESTERDAY!\n. Yes I approve with a smile on my face. :)\nDid not expect to have this available (through `-prerelease`) _today_.\n. Not really understanding what you mean. I thought your auto-update packages did something like that. I don't really understand those either. :P But apart from that, aren't _all_ package sources hardcoded? We would need to have a sources registry. In which case we might as well add the silent installer switches to a registry. And the installation code. And we wouldn't need packages anymore.\n\nSorry I am probably misunderstanding this. :P\n. Or should I have put this in `src\\helpers\\functions\\` and added to `src\\helpers\\chocolateyInstaller.psm1` in order for it to work like this?\n\nIdk, I tested it inside packages themselves (because I already pushed one), not sure where to put it in the monolith.\n. I did Fus Ro Dah push (--force) and added to `chocolateyInstaller.psm1` as well.\nPlus made it more maintainable (readable) (deja vu).\n. Note that this package also features backwards compatible transitioning between old and new $env: as first mentioned here: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/216#issuecomment-11639464\n\n> I would even go as far as renaming `chocolatey_bin_root` to `ChocolateyBinRoot` so it has the same naming convention as `ChocolateyInstall`.\n\nAs part of my quality assurance policy described here: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/304#issuecomment-20126209\n\n> Details are very important.

I did\n\n```\ngit remote add upstream git://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.git\ngit fetch upstream\ngit merge upstream/master\n```\n. I thought so too (should). Maybe I error-ed in some other way. I'll see what happens next time I create a new module.\n. Oh yeah I see. You have to click on the different version first.\n. > Also, `cup` ends without error if there's an error like package exists or trying to install same version.\n\nThis is a valid issue though, I just had it again, forgot I already upgraded on a machine:\n\n``` cmd\nC:\\Users\\Redsandro>cup tomboy -pre\n...

How did this suddenly turn into something I don't quite follow? :smile: \n\nIt's actually possible to have the package repo fire up a VM and test the package?\n\nWhat if thee of us upload a package at the same time, three VMs will launch and we need three MS licenses?\n\nI think the registry snap compare to check for bs is a bit tough though, updated software often has new fingers in the registry, so it would need manual updating.

Just a thought, this would also help prevent the necessity of triaging in certain cases. Why not have a VM build ~~all~~ ~~some~~ core team Automatic Packages? We wouldn't need to be running Windows and a scheduler. Give a virtual `chocolatey` user some pushing to do. :)\n. > Can you elaborate more on this @Redsandro\n\nIn this case I'm actually not talking about Boxstarter, but in the light of this being a Chocolatey topic, the talk about VMs gave me this idea. Automatic packages need to be automatically generated on computers running all the time (or at least frequently). I don't run Windows, so I cannot turn my packages into automatic packages.\n\nWhy not have a VM do this, and have the user [Chocolatey](http://chocolatey.org/profiles/Chocolatey) user push them, as described in the [community packages repo](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-coreteampackages).\n\nFor every package that is stuck unupdated with an unresponsive maintainer, we (or someone who decides this) can just 'kidnap' the stuck package, turn it into an autopackage, and hand it over to the VM/Chocolatey user.\n. **Idea 1**\n\nConcerning the packages that are similar because owners don't respond and someone else decides to upload a newer version under a different name:\n\nMaybe there should be a small group of moderators with the power to take over packages, remove the install script, add a dependency to the new package, or add the new package owner to the old package (to keep the sensible name).\n\nI wanted to install Visual Studio for someone the other day, and there are like 40 packages. No idea which one I need. Maybe it's a bad example, but I had something like this before with some SQL implementation, and I remember having to compare versions, and guess which one I should install.\n\n**Idea 2**\n\nAutomation. Set a clock (for e.g. 30 days) when a package maintainer is contacted for an update, and if they didn't respond within that timeframe, automatically add core team members as package owners and remove the old owner.\n. Is it possible to automate a system to move packages to MyGet, which I know nothing about, but @gep13 recommended for alternative package hosting?\nWould be cool if moderators could 'move' invalid packages to a separate 'stream'.\n. @TomOne said on _Dec 7 2013_:\n\n> Yes, I agree with you. But remember that many of these name prefixed and duplicate packages were created **before** I suggested the package rules and added them to the wiki after Rob had approved them. \n\nGuidelines like https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/316 and https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/317 are still being ignored well over half a year after I raised the issue. Soon every popular package will have a funny name, and only future obscure ones will be named properly. I recently came across `HitmanProPortable_x64` and `HitmanProPortable_x86`. Thee \"violations\" in one package name. This slowly growing library of bad names can be (partially) prevented using some relatively easy tricks.\n1. Put [the **entire** packaging guidelines text](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages#rules-to-be-observed-before-publishing-packages) in the confirmation mail. ([see comment 30056205](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/342#issuecomment-30056205))\n2. Put [the **entire** naming guidelines](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages#naming-your-package) in the confirmation mail.\n3. Have `cpack` run checks, especially on the package `id`.\n   - Similar to @TomOne's [idea](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/294#issuecomment-27622632) to have `cpack` prevent users from messing up encodings in https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/294\n   - If it matches `/portable/i` but not `/\\.portable$/`, refuse to pack/push.\n     - Friendly message why.\n   - If there's a period `.` not followed by `installer$` or `portable$`, refuse to pack/push.\n     - Friendly suggest replacing dots by dashes with example. E.g.: `my.sweet.package` -> `my-sweet-package`.\n   - Same with underscores `_`.\n. That would help indeed.\n\nBut how would you typify _\"easier\"_? I think a moderation system could be in place a year from now. And as I said before, a poor solution in practice is infinitely better than a perfect solution in theory. (And I'm not even saying the solution is poor.)\n\nThe above 'trick' **1** and **2** could be in place today, because it doesn't require too much thinking or efford.\n\nI can make a proposal with links instead of inline rules (because I cannot figure out how html markup works).\n. Here you go: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org/pull/87\n\nFeel free to word it any way you see fit.\n. I agree, but I'm not sure where the line is drawn. Hell, I'm even annoyed by all the `.tool` `.installer` `.app` `.portable` `.commandline` and `.iDontKnowHowToCategorizeThisAppButOtherwisePeopleDontKnowWhatTheHellTheyAreDoing` packages, but that's the direction we're going.\n\nIn other words, this is something only **ferventcoder** can answer, I just made the rules more readable without actually changing them, and I need some kind of permission before I go ahead and update the wiki. :smile: \n. @TomOne Isn't `.install` the default/obvious way to go? I understand `.portable` but appending `.install` to pretty much every package is pretty silly in my golden opinion.\n\nI discovered Chocolatey when googling apt-get for windows. apt-get is intuitive. Both `apt-get` and `cinst` can do `cinst firefox freefilesync libreoffice` now.\n\nBut do I understand you correctly that this would be `cinst firefox.install freefilesync.install libreoffice.install` in the future? That would be kinda retarded.\n\n> They are essential to understand what the package contains.  \n\nFor `.portable` it is convenient. You can do `cinst pidgin` or `cinst pidgin.portable` (made up example). Makes sense. Intuitive.\nBut the _default_ shouldn't introduce command line bloat in my opinion. You could store all metadata in the package-id: `cinst pidgin.gpl3.x64.tags[internet,messaging].portable` but that's not how we should learn what's in the package, we got the package page with information to know what is in the package.\n. Ah ok, I interpreted that wrong. I have reading issues. :P\n\nSo folks can set a preference for either portable or installer? That makes some sense. :)\n. > And there are still folks which ignore the rules and guidelines in the wiki and use the deprecated suffixes.  \n\nNot so much as ignore, I think more like unaware of. Package maintainers should in my opinion get an email when the guidlines change considerably.\n. Ok I will apply them in about 30 seconds. :+1: \n. https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages#rules-to-be-observed-before-publishing-packages :+1: \n. There are many commercial and trial packages out there. This is not mentioned in the description. If it sounds nice and you try it out, only to find out it's a trial or you need a license immediately, it's annoying.\n\nI suggest adding the rule:\n- **Packaging commercial or trial software?** Clearly state this in the package description.\n\nWhat do you think?\n. Added. :thumbsup: \n. This could get more important over time. Let's put it on a future wishlist. :)\n. I found it: _This installation package could not be opened. Contact the application vendor to verify that this is a valid Windows Installer package._\n[[source](http://www.symantec.com/connect/articles/windows-installer-exit-error-codes-log-files)]\nI already contacted the package owners, though in my experience, I never ever get a reply. :P \n\nAnyway, the point of this issue report is more that in my opinion, `Chocolatey` should just show one error (once) and continue with the next package.\n. > WTF on number 2?\n\nYeah crazy. I just checked on another machine where it still had `Version: '0.9.8.21-alpha2'` installed. There `chocolatey /?` works fine.\n\n``` cmd\nC:\\Users\\Redsandro>chocolatey version\n\nfound         : 0.9.8.21-alpha2\nname          : chocolatey\nlatestCompare : 000000000000.000000000009.000000000008.000000000020\nverMessage    : Your version is newer than the most recent.

Now my terminal closes. Is that normal? I guess so. New terminal:\n\n``` cmd\nC:\\Users\\Redsandro>chocolatey version\n\nfound         : 0.9.8.21-beta1\nname          : chocolatey\nlatestCompare : 000000000000.000000000009.000000000008.000000000020\nverMessage    : Your version is newer than the most recent.

Please wait... Done.\n```\n\nAnd now for the test:\n\n``` cmd\nC:\\Users\\Redsandro>chocolatey /?\nCalls one batch program from another.\n\nCALL [drive:][path]filename [batch-parameters]\n\n  batch-parameters   Specifies any command-line information required by the\n                     batch program.\n\nIf Command Extensions are enabled CALL changes as follows:\n\nCALL command now accepts labels as the target of the CALL.  The syntax\nis:\n\n    CALL :label arguments\n(...)\n```\n\nSo yes, this `call /?` bug was introduced after `alpha2`.\n. How can I downgrade to the alpha from august? (latest after the beta was taken down)\n.

Although I was sure that it was already merged and I got the 'delete branch' message. Or maybe I'm going slightly mad.\n\nAnyway, can you tell us a statistical mean for how long it takes for current branch to become non-prerelease?\nThat's the moment when we can use this in live packages. :)\n. I added this to the `ruby` package and temporarily included the same `Get-BinRoot.ps1` file as an included script: https://github.com/ferventcoder/nugetpackages/pull/110\n\nThis can be a prototype fix for all packages that have this problem. The extra file can be removed from packages once `Chocolatey` is no longer pre-release.\n. You have my interest. I have no idea what you are saying, but I don't like batch redirects.\n\nWhat are shim files in this scope?\n. I'd also like to suggest that `Write-Host` comments should try to stick to an **80 character maximum**. as not to annoy a default-sized terminal. Better use two lines split in a more human way, than rely on auto-wrap.\n\n(Just like comments in most source code is traditionally no longer than 72 characters for readability.)\n. Sweet :)\nOn Mar 2, 2014 10:54 PM, \"Rob Reynolds\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> I am going to pull in #376https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/376though.\n> \n> ## \n> \n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/374#issuecomment-36468591\n> .\n.

Actually, it's often more like 3 lines placed in a more human-readable way over the original 3 lines autowrapped and broken mid-sentence. Unless you changed the width of the default terminal to span one and a half monitor.\n\nBut I thought about your suggestion before and I thought leave the first line/part and have the rest optional with a `-verbose` flag.\n\nOr as a middleground solution, get the width of the terminal, write a single line if it fits, write 3 lines if it doesn't.\n\nOr truncate the url in the output to only the domain, and truncate the target to only the filename. (Not a fan of this)\n. I like to emphasize the importance of prettifying the output. \n\nThere are two kinds of human _conscious perception_: _orderly_ (usually women) and _industrious_ (usually technical people). Right now, Chocolatey scores a 8 at _industriousness_ and a 2 at _orderliness_.\n\nStudies have shown that visual orderliness is psychologically associated with quality and trustworthiness. Right now the general output looks like a mess. I'm just saying that this issue is way more important than most _industriousness_ people (AKA developers AKA people here) think.\n\nI am also talking about #376 here. Of course you don't have to agree with my propositions, but you should do _something_.\n\nThink about spacing, new information should start at the same point the next line. Do not cram too much information on one line. Imagine the Linux dmesg boot process. It would be MUCH shorter if multiple pieces of information would be on the same line like in Chocolatey, but shorter is not always better. They are put below each other because it improves readability and thus the feeling of quality. Think about using color (#376) (orderly) in stead of ascii (industrious) as visual cue's.\n\nLet's be industrious where it counts (in the code) and orderly where it counts (in the output).\n\n(edit/ oh shoot wanted to post this at #374)\n. I am glad we could make a deal! :smile: \n. Cool.

I'm not even using `Yum` (`apt-get` here) but I am not surprised because #GMTA. :wink: \n\nTo illustrate that we don't need large error messages. Just output the error to the log, and output a _single line_ saying _installation failed_ to the output.

Nothing should hang the process. Not waiting for input. It should be able to complete on it's own. Maybe with an exit code.\n\n> list the failed pkg names so one would not have to crack open a log file just to figure out what did not install.\n\nI agree*, but you would not have to open the log file to figure that out. Because now that the new output is actually a pleasure to read, you'll quickly spot a red line. Here's a colored mockup:\n\n![Clean output mockup for Chocolatey](http://i.imgur.com/heqzKz6.png)\nhttp://cssdesk.com/JUTPR\n\n> all verbose info that goes to the log should also gk to the console if -verbose is passed or $verbose preference is set to continue.\n\nI agree.\n\n> output psobjects to the pipeline with info like success/fail, exceptions, packagename\n\nI don't understand so I'll leave opinions to the professionals. :)\n\n*) There's more interesting stuff we could do, for example, list the dependencies of all packages after the to-be-installed packages. But I thought: Let's clean this up first, and add features later. Small steps have a bigger chance of actually being stepped. :)\n\nWe _could_ also remove the `To: %Temp%` line and put it in the log, because it doesn't really add anything. But the `From:` line is important (seeing (and trusting) the source is important).\n. Textually this is pretty awesome! :thumbsup: \n\nHowever, the color doesn't really add anything. And the text can be more 80-friendly. So please allow me to comment on that:\n1. Using all the same color has no visual benefit. Alternate between key information and verbose information (and successful information and error information) with color and weight.\n2. Take care of the default console width, you don't want a sentence wrap it's last two characters to the next line.\n   - Preferably, you don't want to wrap at all. You don't really have to be polite and say please to the user when you can say it in one line. :)\n\nMockup:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1702193/2741881/b860a346-c6f6-11e3-93e9-f80cc86c0488.png)\n. Ah I already made a two-package mockup, shame to throw it away. So I'll paste it anyway.\n\nBut sounds cool. I'm not sure about anything PowerShell either, but it is supported in Unix escape codes and I used to do that for `curses` text output in `python` scripts for Linux. They could be run on Windows too, and it just displayed the bold text in the console. I have no idea if `curses` does that or if the console just supports that natively.\n\n---\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1702193/2741972/b80c492e-c6f9-11e3-8f00-92fc3e1e0326.png)\n.

Very nice!\nThis is convenient for both audiences, neat and simple, or optional verbosity!\n\n:thumbsup: \n. Really cool. What language is that?\n(those lines you removed) :)\n. That's probably cool but not something that will get me excited.\nNow we're going to get all these hipster packages polluting the feed.\nBesides, OSX is totally different in every way, how would that work?\n. Oh I would love that for Linux!\n\nI find myself every now and then making a (requested) update, only having to wait a week before I have access to a Windows machine for `cpack` and `cpush`.\n. The current output and new colors are looking nice! :thumbsup: \n\nThe limegreen package titles are very distinctive, the output is friendly to look at.\n\nIf stuff goes wrong, the `-debug` optionally makes output very verbose.\n. Nothing wrong with it. I use regexes for other packages too. Just didn't think about using a bunch of them in a row.\nFeel free to improve. Coming from Linux myself, I didn't know powershell either when I discovered Chocolatey.\n\nMaybe your regexes are smarter, I just rewrote them because I don't get the `sed` syntax with all the comma's. :question: \n. Same problem again. Fixing the broken CNET parser needs all packages fixed. This should be internal, just like SourceForge is handled internally.\n. For reference:\nhttps://github.com/Redsandro/chocolatey/blob/master/autopackages/PartitionAssistant/tools/Get-UrlFromCnet2.ps1\n\nHowever, why does this return an array?\n\n```\n[0]    =>    True,\n[1]    =>    \"http://www.TheUrlThatIAmLookingFor'\n```\n. Thanks! :+1: \n. I still think helpers should have a certain format, and they should be packages that can be referenced as dependencies.\n\nOne change means one package to fix, and all packages that depend on it will work again.\n. I just tried it here on powershell, it's instant.\n\nYou can optionally add `[environment]::Is64BitOperatingSystem` before the first check, but I am not sure how to check between false and undefined (if there is such a thing in PS) to switch older OSses.\n\nLike (this code is not working in PS, but to give you an idea):\n\n``` ps\nif ([environment]::Is64BitOperatingSystem === True) {\n    $osArch = '64-bit'\n} elseif([environment]::Is64BitOperatingSystem === False) { # False != undefined\n    $osArch = '32-bit'\n}\n# on older systems, $osArch is undefined, so we can continue\nif (-Not $osArch) {\n    $os    = Get-WmiObject Win32_OperatingSystem\n    $osArch = $os.OSArchitecture\n}\n# ... etc\n```\n. Did it work with the testing? ;)\n\nI'm thinking this is an essential fix because I think the old code causes packages to try to install 64 bit software on 64 bit computers with a 32 bit OS installed. Didn't test that though, only people who don't use git install 32 bit OSses on 64 bit computers.\n\nBut I'm trying to make the general public addicted to Chocolatey. That includes intellectually challenged people, or people who for some other reason ended up with a 32 bit license and a 64 bit computer. :P\n. I'm on Linux so I only tested https://github.com/bill-long/chocolatey/pull/1 in my common sense emulator, but this should fix both old and new users. The Get-BinRoot is used in more packages than just `OHM` so it might be a good idea to implement this.\n. No that's not what's supposed to close it, not sure what did.\nBut anything you merge with your pull-request is automatically added to the pull-request so no need to submit a new one. :)\n\n_Edit:_ Ah I read the notification, not the edit.

Either way, please merge @bill-long's initial commit ASAP, otherwise soon everyone will have c:\\ as default.\n\nhttps://github.com/bill-long/chocolatey/commit/d4806255e8d73567a64db0c3a8ad9196a13d226f\n. Agreed. @ferventcoder @bill-long I suggest **not** reverting my additions. If you want to support `c:\\`, first fix the issues at hand that make this impossible, and **then** revert my changes that fix current issues.\n\nDon't deny gifted sneakers when at some point in the future you want to put your feet in boots you haven't bought yet. :wink: \n. Fixed two packages https://github.com/Redsandro/chocolatey/commit/eb8bbcf7f9d745a002a471afcc350c51c53df227\n\nI'm on Linux, won't have access to Windows until sometime next week. Any volunteers I can make co-owner of `OpenHardwareMonitor` and `RenameMaster`, willing to `cpack` and `cpush`?\n- Source:\n  -  OpenHardwareMonitor\n    - https://github.com/Redsandro/chocolatey/tree/master/openhardwaremonitor\n  -  RenameMaster\n    - https://github.com/Redsandro/chocolatey/tree/master/renamemaster\n. Thanks. Added you.\n. @gep13 I agree, but `chocolatey` (the user associated with coreteampackages) never accepted co-ownership of some packages I wanted to put up there.\n\nI think (can't find it back this moment) @ferventcoder argued `coreteampackages` was only meant for certain specific widely used packages (contradicting your idea of _\"The more, the better\"_), otherwise `coreteampackages` would turn into a heap were people could just dump packages. And to some degree, he is right.\n\nAlso, I don't know how to autopackage, even with the nice tutorial. I'm on a Windows machine mostly during the weekends. And lately those weekends are reserved for a beautiful girl until further notice. I don't dare guessing the process without being able to test. :)\n\nAnd also also, RenameMaster can't be autopackage afaik, because it uses some download-trickery that requires human tinkering.\n. **Redsandro**\n\n> I want to drop some packages (..)\n> However people seem to use it (..) so it seems a shame to unlist and abandon it.\n> \n> How does this work? Do I create a pullrequest in the coreteampackages repo?\n\n**Ferventcoder**\n\n> The core team and core packages are/will be those pkgs that are critical/crucial. It is not a dumping ground for offloading packages that folks are no longer interested in maintaining.  \n\nJust quoting the essentials makes the communication lose it's nuance; you can read the full thing here: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/chocolatey/YyQn2Q2xmn0/LBXjjbGkvEIJ\n\nI'm definitely interested in what's going on there, thanks. I'll give you a shout when I have some more time to wrap my head around something new. :smile: \n. So in stead of the `Chocolatey` user, there are just some users (like you) who 'serve' autopackages under their own name?\n\nIf at some point in the future, I got a package auto'ed, I should add you as co-owner in stead of `chocolatey`?\n. Ah, okay, so my picture of the mise-en-sc\u00e8ne was right initially.\n\nIn order to qualify for being `anyone` you'd at least need to have a (periodically) running Windows machine. Your setup (and idea to have all autopackages at the same place anyway) sounds clever to me.\n\n`Chocolatey` didn't accept ownership for reasons outlined by ferventcoder. (And in the end I hadn't figured out how to auto my packages within the time I had set aside for the conversion anyway. Also, for some of the packages, [tonigellida](https://chocolatey.org/profiles/tonigellida) offered to convert them and host them, which I gladly accepted.)\n. :thumbsup: \n. Yeah it should, but there were some bugs. I introduced this as a\ntransitional thing, I think @ferventcoder had a different approach to\ncertain things in mind but I am not sure if that is one release away our\none year away. Is the bugfix merged with mainline (non-pre) release? I can\ndocument some of this in a quick fashion if that's a good idea.\n. @Nilzor, I Added the [Overview](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/HelpersReference#overview) section to the Helper documentation, hoping it might be helpful. I Added minimal summary for `Get-BinRoot` and `Get-ProcessorBits`. Would be helpful if others expand descriptions for other helpers in similar minimal fashion.\n. :warning: @ferventcoder, dude, you haven't merged the fix yet! We reckoned this is pretty critical.\n\nI know everybody is busy and all, but some pullrequests, especially ones that are deemed critical-ish, take (too) long to be merged. Also, discussion for things that are proposed but not merged due to indecisiveness between multiple parties is hard to keep track of, resulting in ideas and bugfixes evaporating in a vacuum of time and dreams.\n\nIf there's a solution to a problem, be it not in line with your personal vision, I'd recommend merging or applying the solution first, and apply your preference whenever you get around to doing it.\n\nA meager solution committed is always infinitely better than a perfect solution in your head.\n. I just created a simple script - that I am ashamed to have worked more than an hour on - that will automate helper documentation somewhat. See #458.\n. Great! :smile: \n\nHowever, to continue the discussion, I do actually think the default should be `$env:ChocolateyInstall\\bin` in stead of `c:\\tools` to prevent root clutter. I think it had always been that, but we accidentally introduced `c:\\tools` because the bug ignored the old default. (I think, not sure)\n. I added this proposed default to `Get-BinRoot.ps1` in branch _docGenerator_ #458 because that one has the embedded comments for the doc generator anyway.\n\nSee https://github.com/Redsandro/chocolatey-origin/blob/docGenerator/src/helpers/functions/Get-BinRoot.ps1\n\n(Of course feel free to change, e.g. %ChocolateyInstall%/tools in stead)\n. Since when do we have a markdown branch for the wiki? Me (and others) just\nuse the editor after a bit of discussion.\n\nThis change seems 100% objective and accurate so I would vote to just add\nit in the wiki which is now outdated indeed.\n\nOn Apr 16, 2014 8:40 AM, \"Frode Nilsen\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n. I have [applied](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages#1-path-provided-by-the-get-binroot-helper) your edit, and changed it slightly:\n- The `Ruby` package is a bad example because it might confuse users into embedding the old and buggy BinRoot. Changed it to `MinGW`.\n- The whole point of `Get-BinRoot` is to not install anything in the root if people forget to set BinRoot, so the `C:\\Ruby###` example is obsolete and will only happen if the package maintainer specifically forces it to install there, or if `C:\\` is set as the `BinRoot`, which is not currently possible due to https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/430 (And if it was up to me it woudln't ever be possible because that's just stupid (imo)).\n- The default path is gonna be either `%SystemDrive%:\\Tools` if https://github.com/bill-long/chocolatey/pull/1 is gonna be merged, or `%ChocolateyInstall%\\bin` to prevent the unpopular thing called clutter, which is under consideration over here https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/458\n\nFeel free to verify and improve the documentation. :)\n. @ferventcoder ssteward54 is right. Because this issue is starting to bug me, I downloaded an image from Modern.IE and installed Chocolatey. Next, I installed sysinternals. And indeed. ChocolateyBinRoot is set to C:.\n. ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1702193/2892753/b70bc9d2-d540-11e3-9b24-f90f80ca1881.png)\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1702193/2892773/e3a136e4-d540-11e3-8c30-2dfe75ed1943.png)\n. @ssteward54 please specify what package(s) cause this. I think maybe some package(s) might have the buggy binroot hardcoded.\n. Do we also need to address the issue where people now have environment `$env:ChocolateyBinRoot` set to `c:\\` because of this bug? It will continue to cause errors.\n\ni.e. pull this one: https://github.com/bill-long/chocolatey/commit/25f7865719e9b101a9860d0a4fa6cad2a0ed3c9d\n. And **until** then, merge the request I proposed. There's no need to have people with unusable broken installations just because we're contemplating future options when there's been a bugfix ready for 3 months now.\n. It was in this one, but @bill-long reverted that. @bill-long, could you\nun-revert that? Can't do much at the moment, I'm on vacation in Berlin with\nmy tablet. :)\nOn May 31, 2014 2:50 PM, \"Rob Reynolds\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> @Redsandro https://github.com/Redsandro is there a PR for that fix\n> somewhere?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/421#issuecomment-44747462.\n.

Thank you so much for testing this on Windows 8.1.\nI will advise people with this problem to update Chocolatey or clean their system.\n. PS - can you tell me what version of Chocolatey you were using?\n. I don't know why the installer recurses all the paths. But good catch.\n. Seems Chocolatey recurses the paths and uses the proper environmental variable impromerly set by getBinRoot.\n. Yes. I think it's ready for pulling now. If you agree with the fixes. Shall I close this one?\n. I have no recollection of this pull request. No idea what I was trying to do.\n. I guess it used to work, but it wasn't picked up, and now it needs work. \n\nI don't have time to look into this right now. Feel free to pick this up. If not, Thanks for inquiring. :) Here's a picture of some shaved ice as a thank you: :shaved_ice: \n. Updated.\n\nCould you be so nice and convert this to proper `powershell` code, @ferventcoder?

Same error.\n\n---\n\nOfftopic: \n\nVagrant is just VirtualBox with a command line wrapper around it, so there's no real difference between `vagrant up` or `modern.ie`, unless you got a special base box with all configuration done in advance. If you do not have a base box, creating a Vagrant instance is a lot more work than just clicking import on VirtualBox. In the end, the result is the same. A running vanilla-ish installation.\n\nWith that said, I didn't know there were Windows base boxes? I couldn't find them anywhere. I thought that was illegal. It does make life easier though. What's in them? How do you communicate with them? They have no ssh, right? How do you preconfigure them on the disk image without starting the license grace period?\n\nAlso, people don't just have a license lying around, that's why I use the `modern.ie` boxes.\n\n---\n\nPS - I already use `Vagrant` with a `Modern.ie` drive. I just didn't mention it because I find it irrelevant.\n. Interesting, I didn't know about these boxes!\n\nWhat do these include? The Modern.ie ones also include guest additions so you can use them without configuration, and after 30 days just remove and re-import them. Ssh would be nice but I can't seem to install stuff without starting the OS (and starting the license timeout)\n\n> You can try grabbing the evaluation ISO at http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2012-r2\n\nIsn't it better for chocolatey testing purposes (AKA figuring out why certain users have problems) to use the product most realistically used by the audience? I use these 'boxes', as in, I just import them and repack them to a box without _any_ kind of vagranty additives.\n\nhttps://modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools#downloads\n. Well like I said the error message is the same, but if you think the new version has more clues in it's output, I will gladly fire up a clean Win7 VM.\n\nBut **note** that the `gtksharp` package was updated (as per my request) to include `dotnet4.0` as a dependency and now `gtksharp` will install fine. Not sure what the impact is for this error, but at least the error in a life Windows installation (not VM) is gone.\n\n## Installing Chocolatey\n\n```\nMicrosoft Windows [Version 6.1.7601]\nCopyright (c) 2009 Microsoft Corporation.

Good find! It won't download a redirect at all, or HTTPS redirect in particular, or just this specific case?\n\nSince I got this in Windows 7, but the person who contacted me had a different error - related to DotNet4 needing a reboot, which is the error that would appear after the download was succesful and the script would proceed - he probably had a newer build (probably service pack); I am thinking that this error might be there in Windows <= 7.0 and not in Windows >= 7.1.\n. I thought `chocolatey` automatically installs `.NET 4.0`, or is that irrelevant concerning powershell?\n\nSorry if stupid question.\n. So ideally, in stead of timing out, it would either:\n- Stop with an error; or\n- Issue a _[WARNING] could not verify certificate of [xyz]_ and continue ignoring SSL:\n  - In Unix that would be `curl -k` or `curl --insecure`\n    - `-k`/`--insecure` (SSL) This option explicitly allows curl to perform \"insecure\" SSL connections and transfers. Starting with curl 7.10, all SSL connections will be attempted to be made secure by using the CA certificate bundle installed by default.\n. I don't fully understand what is happening, but if it works, it works.\nI will test this out in a vm that I know has this problem when new chocolatey is released.\n. Is there a way to install pre-release version directly?

I don't want to handle reboots. It doesn't seem necessary, because the `DotNet4.0` package cancels this requirement out somehow.\n. If it's gonna have trouble, I would suggest stopping the operation without a special switch.\n\nThe first helps a lot. But I think for non-technical users, it would be good if the first message would explicitly say: Expect a bunch of error messages.\n\nSlightly unrelated but curious: Am I correct that, I don't know, six months ago or so, chocolatey didn't need an elevated prompt? I have the feeling that I didn't Ctrl+Shift+Enter `cmd` all the time, but now I am.\n. I thought that was by design to allow software installations in restrictive\nenvironments.

Is _this_ in your comment referring to `C:\\ProgramData\\chocolatey\\bin` or `C:\\Tools`?\nI am assuming the latter, but with the confusion and all, I'm not sure.\n. Can you try and explain it to me?\n. Perhaps we should have a `binRoot` and a `toolsRoot`\n. > Do we need a bin root? Or is it that choco is not doing a sufficient job in some cases?\n\nI don't know. I prefer a non-shimmed binRoot for command line tools, and for everything else a subdirectory of `chocolatey` (like `lib` and `bin` already are). If anyone prefers something arbitrary like `C:\\Tools` they should **manually** make it so.\n\nWith players and browsers and libraries - not just tools but plain software - installing to `Get-BinRoot` ATM AKA `Tools`, I think software or programs or bin is a more intuitive and canonical name. It makes sense to put this inside `chocolatey` unless manually changed to something that has personal preference.\n\n> the need to Get-BinRoot should become non-existent\n\nWhat did I miss/forget?\n. Brutal honesty, nitpicking, lack of knowledge and a touch of ocd combined:\n\nI like to (re-)use my 'own' bin folder and be able to specify it as $binRoot for chocolatey. I like this bin directory to be copyable to USB sticks and between VMs. I like to pipe stuff between 'exe' files within batch files, being able to assume that the .exe files are in the same folders (relatively named). And I like, when some complicated piped script doesn't work, not to have to wonder if it's the shimming that causes a pipe to break.\n. Some packages output an error message and then throw it.\nDoes this cause two out of three error messages?\n\n```\n    } catch {\n        $errorMessage = \"This package tried to do something stupid and has failed to install.\"\n        Write-Error $errorMessage\n        throw $errorMessage\n  }\n```\n\nI don't know what Write-Error does besides writing the message, but if it includes the stack details, maybe that's where it goes wrong.\n\nJust a thought.\n\n-edit-\n\nOther packages do\n\n```\n} catch {\n    Write-ChocolateyFailure $name $($_.Exception.Message)\n    throw   \n}\n```\n\nBut maybe it's irrelevant.\n\n-edit-\nCaught another one. **Four (4) times** the same error message. Skipping the errors itself, it does display line numbers to track down:\n\n```\nWrite-Error : [ERROR] Exit code was '1'.\nAt C:\\Common\\Chocolatey\\chocolateyInstall\\helpers\\functions\\Start-ChocolateyProcessAsAdmin.ps1:46 char:5\n\n[ERROR] [ERROR] Exit code was '1'.\nAt C:\\Common\\Chocolatey\\chocolateyInstall\\helpers\\functions\\Write-ChocolateyFailure.ps1:30 char:2\n\n[ERROR] [ERROR] Exit code was '1'.\nAt C:\\Common\\Chocolatey\\chocolateyInstall\\helpers\\functions\\Write-ChocolateyFailure.ps1:30 char:2\n\nWrite-Error : Package did not install successfully: [ERROR] Exit code was '1'.\nAt C:\\Common\\Chocolatey\\chocolateyInstall\\functions\\Chocolatey-NuGet.ps1:90 char:17\n```\n. Don't get me wrong, I am enthusiastic about this and don't mean to be nitpicky! Ofcourse it's not gonna be apt-get all the way.\n\nBut the ease of installing your favourite apps on a clean OS all at once using a single command is arguably one of the most useful and widely used features of a package manager. I've used _apt-get_, _yum_, _aptitude_, _pacman_ and _dpkg_, and they all do this. I guess I automatically assumed it is expected behavior of a package manager.\n\nSorry, I am new to this, I just googled around, found **chocolately** and **npackd**. One of the reasons I chose chocolately first was because I read it was older, so I didn't really think about _not even to v1 yet._ :P\n\n(The other reason is that the Chocolately site is much nicer and has terminal support out of the box. Very nice!)\n\n(Admittedly I installed npackd afterwards to install the packages that had failed in chocolately (like Security Essentials) and/or didn't have a 64 bit candidate.)\n\n(Since Chocolately is much nicer, but npackd fails less often, think of the amount of bases that are belong to you if the projects are merged! ;))\n. Hey you are right. It's a wonder I made it through school, I still don't do my homework right. :P\n\nThanks for the hints. Is powershell different from the normal shell? Could you give an example on how to do the array thing on powershell? It would give me some power before v1 hits the stage.\n\nOn Linux it would be:\n**for N in app1 app2 app3; do cinst $N; done**\n\nNow you mention it, I think it's also possible in normal shell (cmd), probably something like this iirc:\n**FOR %n IN (app1, app2, app3) DO (cinst %n)**\n(This is a reasonably educated guess, cannot test it, am not on Windows now.)\n. By the way, since Chocolately can internally process a list from XML (packages.conf), isn't it relatively easy to implement a feature to use a command-line list?\n\nI imagine the list from XML will end up in an unshifting array or something. I don't know powershell coding but using javascript pseudocode it would be something like this:\n\n``` javascript\n// Use command line multiple input if no packages.conf is specified\nif (arguments.length > 2) // Multiple packages found\n    for (var n=2; n<arguments.length; n++) // From first to last package\n        install_array.push(arguments[n]); // Create installation array\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n```\narguments[0] = chocolately install app1 app2 app3\narguments[1] = install\narguments[2] = app1\narguments[3] = app2\narguments[4] = app3\n```\n. I updated `chocolatey.cmd` to allow batch-installation. It just continues with the next when a package fails, which is what we want, because with the batch-xml I used to do it was **so annoying** that it stopped on error.\n\nHere is the update: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/304\n. `cinst chocolatey -pre`\n. I noticed I did `-beta` sometimes before I remembered to do `-pre`.\nJust a thought: Maybe add `beta` as a synonym for `pre`?\n. True. I hadn't thought of that. It's not as simple as I thought. Monday half brain day.\n. Today I found out Chocolately is actually called Chocolatey. Why did nobody stop me? :P\nI edited the above issue to fix this.\n. @ferventcoder just a thought: Can `all` packages from `cup` all be rerouted through the new batch functionality? I see you also implemented this in cup when multiple packages are mentioned individually.\n. Installing or updating multiple packages at once #304\n. Let me try that again. Personally I don't really care for `packages.xml` (AKA `packages.conf`) anymore, since we have batch functionality (e.g. `cinst package1 package2 packageN`). However, `cup all` also stops on error, and that one is important.\n\n``` cmd\nFinished installing 'ccleaner' and dependencies - if errors not shown in console, none detected.

Additional info/packages: all\nReading environment variables from registry. Please wait... Done.\nC:\\Users\\Redsandro>\n```\n\nThe batch install does not stop on error, right? So can `cup all` somehow use the same don't-stop-on-error magic?\n. I concur, but I lack the knowledge and the knowhow to propose a fix. :) I'm\nbetter at making .bat wrappers. :P\nOn Nov 5, 2013 12:17 AM, \"TomOne\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> This is actually a very important issue to solve.

You want to update them all: `cup all`\n\nAfter 4 packages it breaks because the 5th package maintainer made a mistake. You now have 15 packages that are not updated. You have to remember them all, figure out their _Chocolatey_ IDs, and specify each of them manually. This is a show stopper and is bad for business. \n\nNow that package 5 cannot update because of some error, that does **not** mean you suddenly changed your mind about updating the rest of your system.\n\nThis together with the single-install-only limitation (fixed in #191 ) were my biggest annoyances with Chocolatey, and the stopping on error annoyance is the feedback I hear the most. (I install Chocolatey on other peoples laptops, and sometimes I even tell them how it works. ;)) (The other feedback is that packages often don't work, but that's a different problem.)\n\nSure, when a dependency no one (read: typical user) knows or cares about fails, the parent package should fail, obviously. But the rest of the independent packages are still supposed to be updated.\n\n> You are likely to see lots of failures and would prefer to have it simply stop so you can diagnose the root problem earlier.\n\nI can imagine this too, but it's more of an advanced use-case. There should be a command line option for that.\n\n**\"1.0\" takeoff point:**\n-  Do not stop on error. When client says he wants to update all, he wants to update all.\n\n**Ideally:**\n- Skip packages who's dependencies have errors, continue with the rest.\n\n**Advanced:**\n- Command line option for users who want specific behavior: `cup --stop-on-error all`\n. I'd like to see _Chocolatey_ introduced to the masses. I think _Chocolatey_ is meant for the masses in the end. Meant for easy software management.\n\nA famous developer once [said](http://geekswithblogs.net/robz/archive/2013/06/25/career-defining-moments.aspx) about Chocolatey:  \n\n> I want to see Windows be as automatable and awesome as other operating systems that are out there.\n\nThe Windows audience doesn't really mix well with something that breaks and spits out 20 red lines of error. It just wants to see a (final) message: _\"19 out of 20 packages updated. See error.log for details.\"_\n\nA single independent (in Linux we call this top-level) package should not rely on another top-level (TL) package, and neither should be the order in which they are installed or updated relevant. Hence it should not stop on error.\n\nWhen one failing TL package leaves the system in barney for another TL package, said package is in conflict with both logic and the packaging [guidelines](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages#rules-to-be-observed-before-publishing-packages), and should be hosted somewhere else:  \n\n> A package creator should consider whether his package is also useful for others. If that is not the case, it shouldn\u2019t be published on Chocolatey.org. **Reasons for that can be if the package would require a very special configuration** that is unacceptable for other users **or that would lead to serious vulnerabilities**.\n. Let's strife for flawless UX and command line options for specifics. :smile: \n.

Sorry, I didn't notice there was a mailgroup for questions. New questions will be redirected henceforth. \n\nBut let me assure you, I am one of the cleverest people in my subnet (;)), and if I cannot get my custom package to install from source, I'm afraid it's gonna be a problem for other package committing 'noobs' too.\n\nIn response, yes the tutorial is quite comlpete and it does explain how cpack needs to be run first. When someone points out the problem and I get my first package to work, I will, with your permission, add a quick-start guide to the lengthy package creating part of the wiki.\n\nOr could it be a bug in the latest _cpack_ or _cinst_? That would be a fine coincidence, I would have posted my section in the right section after all.\n. I cannot check that right now as I am on the wrong computer, but I used the command that is on the website yesterday: _@powershell something.DownloadString('http://bit.ly/psChocInstall'))_ one. I am assuming it points to the release version.\n. Yes, works nicely. I was gonna make a screenshot, but I bet you believe me when I say it shows exactly the same as mentioned in the above XML code.\n\n-edit- On second thought, the below comment is probably irrelevant.\n\nI made a typo on a virtual machine just now while playing around with it, and I noticed:\n\n**dir**  \n_3.504 tomboy.1.10.2.nupkg  \n1.351 tomboy.nuspec  \n[DIR]          tools_  \n\n**cinst tomboy -source %cd%**  \n_'tomboy' is not a valid version string.

Oops, that was a mistake on my part posting the output of the _dir_ command here on github, it is the file size from the _cmd.com_ console window.\n\nThe filename is _tomboy.nuspec_ and when running _cpack_ it automatically creates _tomboy.1.10.2.nupkg_. It must be getting those numbers from the nuspec xml file, so _cpack_ reads the version correctly.\n\nHence we're back at the confusing _'tomboy' is not a valid version string_ error message when testing the package.\n.

Yes, once I complete pushing the package successfully, I will add the steps.\n\nIf I may be so blunt to ask, is this repository you mentioned earlier necessary for this step? If I read the tutorial correctly, I can just get an api-key and push the package. There is no mention of this repository. In the templating system there is mention of filling in your personal repo and an auto-update repo (without further explanation), but the template I used for this .msi package does not require them.\n\nIf I missed repo documentation from the tutorial, you can just provide a link and I will read from there.\n. Ah I get it now. The only thing I ever do is git clone, so I've git some\nreading to do on how to get my stuff up there.\n. Ouch, gotta love that wiki editor. :')\n\nThanks for the help. In return, a Quick Start Guide: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackagesQuickStart\n. What do you mean by second source to the package?\n\nI am pretty sure it works like this (too) because I copied most commands in\na little notepad when I executed them. But maybe I got something mixed up.\n\nIf you are sure and/or have any other changes in mind, feel free to edit\nthe page.\n. I was looking for that quickstartguide I made earlier and couldn't find a link in the main page (CreatePackages) although I am pretty sure I made one.\n\nAfter googling, I found this issue and rediscovered the page through above link.\n\nAm I having a mini-epilepsy-attack and did I never create a reference in the main packaging wiki, or was it removed with good reason?\n\nI (re)created the reference. Of course, feel free to change if the wording is wrong. \n\nMy rationale is this: I (and therefor undoubtedly others too) just wanted to know the basic steps, and looking at the size of the page (scrollbar) made me initially lose interest. That's why I think a new visitor should see that there is a quick start guide in the first a-screens-length of the CreatePackages page.\n\nMaybe I was an idiot and pressed preview in stead of save. Could also be. :P\n. Okay my bad, please ignore. :P\n. -includedependencies would also be a good idea. That would skip more manual\nsteps.\n. Or: **`-source` should not use cache**\n\n`-source '%cd%' -force` should ignore `c:\\ProgramData\\chocolatey\\lib\\%DataIAmClearlyTryingToIgnore%`\n. (I was considering the google group, but I think the last two points should be identified as important issues.)\n. I will break this up for you soonish.\n\nIn the meanwhile, fyi, the space in .exe names is the case for the example (you can download the zip file and see for yourself), except in this case a .bat link doesn't really make sense anyway because you would want it in the start menu where spaces are no problem.\n\nI've seen it another time with a custom build of x264 64bit in the past. The author claimed it would be used within another script using \"quotes\" anyway, which wasn't true for me.\n\nGranted, for command line tools you won't see this often because devs would quickly start to feel silly.\n\nBack in the day, you could type _filena~1.exe_ in stead of _filename with space.exe_, but those days are long gone. ;)\n. PS is there a page on the wiki that explains what this .exe.gui is and does?\n. Ah so it changes the way the .bat shortcut launches the application.\n\nI remember reading that and thinking it had to do with gui-installers that cannot be put in silent mode, to prevent them from hanging the Chocolatey installer window when running in batch mode. Wrong assumption. I get it now.\n\nIn this case there would need to be a _Core Temp.exe.ignore_ and the hypothetical _Core Temp.exe.copyToBinFolderInstead_ and/or _Core Temp.exe.createShortcutInStartMenu_\n. That is good news.\n\nI have been looking for a user variable that links there but couldn't find it. There were a lot of %VARS% linking to folders in 2k/xp, but they don't work anymore.\n\nI thought in your second comment #issuecomment-11463385 you mentioned this was a problem. But if you have a possible solution for the start menu, please tell me. :)\n\nRedirected issues:\n\n#216 -> [Enhancement] Copy/move .exe tools to \\bin\\ folder in stead of creating a .bat file.\n#217 -> [Enhancement] Use custom \\bin\\ folder\n#218 -> [Enhancement] Create link to GUI tool in Start Menu\n#219 -> [Enhancement] Ignore spaces when creating a 'fake' link (.bat file)\n. How about `mklink \"$env:chocolatey_bin_root\\tool.exe\" \"$env:ChocolateyInstall\\lib\\pathToTool\\tool.exe\"`\n(emphasis on **mklink** as a solution) instead of the _.bat_ routine?\n. Yea I missed that. :(\n\nIn that case, I propose functionality that moves tools to the bin folder, for reasons explained above.\n. I don't know if there should be opt-in or just _'package maintainer knows best.'_\n\nExecutable only files without dll's or even config files (e.g. ffmpeg, x264, faad, faac, avs2avi) should pose no problem, with the added benefit of being able to copy or sync the bin folder to usb or cloud and use it anywhere as-is. The library, your uncle's machine, wine in linux, etc.\n. **.bat** feels like a MS-DOS heritage, and it is, but apparently the only difference with the more modern **.cmd** is the behavior of error levels when _\"Command Extensions\"_ are enabled, which I don't know what they are.\n\nI always thought batch files had to be more carefully constructed as to provide some kind of DOS compatibility and command files were a bit more versatile. I guess the biggest difference is psychological indeed.\n. Ah sorry, I come from Linux where `ln` (`mklink`) is not such a big deal.\n\nShouldn't everything be opt-in? Right now creating `.bat` files is opt-out with `.exe.ignore`. We could have:\n`.exe.startMenu` (as discussed in #218 )\n`.exe.moveToBin` or `.exe.copyToBin` (as discussed above, remember to implement #217 )\n`.exe.linkBat`\n`.exe.linkGui` (remember to implement #219 )\n. This would be very straightforward for new users, not like _\"This thing happens magically, that thing has a helper function, and a 3rd thing is done by the installation script\"_.\n. I know this would change some expected behavior in existing package install scripts.\n\nThe solution could be to have a compatible Chocolatey version number in every package. Chocolatey-Installer compares this package Chocolatey version with it's own (see `(1)`). But if none is defined by the package, assume old package and go to a quicks-mode (e.g. automatically assume `.linkBat`)\n\n`(1)` For future solutions, the other way around, if a package was made with a newer version of Chocolatey (i.e. uses new helper functions that are not available in previous Chocolatey versions) than the installed one, Chocolatey could quit the install or update saying _\"You need to update Chocolatey in order to install/update this package.\"_\n. > if your package requires a particular version of chocolatey,\n> you can specify the version requirements in the nuspec\n> it will update chocolatey automatically.\n\nNice! I think it's not in the nuspec template from the repo though. What tag is used for this? I think I'll drop a line about this in the wiki.\n\n> it\u2019s a blow to git on win for sure.\n\nWindows is not very friendly towards anything that is not Microsoft. But I find that the MinGW Git, or better, using Cygwin, work quite nicely.\n\n---\n\nWhat do you guys think of this more unified approach to different types of binary handling as mentioned above: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/216#issuecomment-11621798\n. Also found this: http://windows.github.com/\nDidn't take a close look yet.\n. https://github.com/blog/1151-designing-github-for-windows\n. Added Nuspec details to Wiki.\n\nMaybe you should set a(n old) version of Chocolatey by default in the template:\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolateytemplates/blob/master/_templates/chocolatey/__NAME__.nuspec\n\nIt's the quickest way to tell (new) packagers that it is possible and it matters, if they see it.\n. RE: Unified approach -\n\nIt probably looks easy to you because you know Chocolatey inside out, but for new people, when you have stuff happening implicitly, stuff happening explicitly, stuff happening on command, stuff happening inverted (.ignore), it kinda looks like the national tax system. They say it makes sense, but with all rules and exceptions no one likes doing their tax report.\n\nIt has to look sexy and intuitive to use, that's how you attract more packagers and a bigger audience.\n\nI would even go as far as renaming `chocolatey_bin_root` to `ChocolateyBinRoot` so it has the same naming convention as `ChocolateyInstall`. It has no technical benefit, other than making Chocolatey look happy instead of \"random/messy\".\n\nAnyway it (unified approach) should not get in the way of exactly what you want, because there can be a flag, like `Install-ChocolateyZipPackage --forceBat $packageName \"$zipUrl\" \"$binRoot\"`.\nAnd then we could just as well have `--forceCopy`, `--forceStartMenu` or `--forceGui`, for people who just want to drop their exe in a package and boom, it's in the start menu!\n. Also, can you point me to the script that detects `.gui` and `.ignore`? I can look at it for taking a crack at `.startmenu` and `.copy`.\n. I noticed that the CreatePackages wiki\\* specifically mentions using the _%chocolatey_bin_root%_ environment variable as installation path under **Installation paths** -> **1. %chocolatey_bin_root% environment variable**, but this variable is empty.\n\n*) https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages\n. You are right, but what I mean is: You are advised (by the docs) to pass the variable to the (random) installer if it is supported. But the path is empty by default. Which means you will be explicitly passing an empty path to the (random) installer and who knows how it will be interpreted.\n\nMy first thought is that `%chocolatey_bin_path%` should be set to `%ChocolateyInstall%\\bin` by default the when Chocolatey is installed, so it is never empty and can be edited by the user.\n\nMy second thought is that the current solution is to check if `%chocolatey_bin_path%` empty in the install script.\n\nBut wouldn't it be more logical to have the installer set a default value, rather than have 500+ packages perform this check?\n\nIf not, we should add a comment about checking the var in the docs so it isn't ambiguous.\n. _Added \"Please note that this variable is empty by default, and needs to be explicitly set by the user. Before installing to %chocolatey_bin_root%, your installation script should check if this variable is not empty.\" to wiki._\n. I have the feeling that people who are not working on the code but do care about packages and documentation miss out on the good stuff. :P\n\nHowever, there is no such file in functions: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/tree/master/src/functions\nCan you point me to the right direction?\n\nI want to see if it will daisychain with Install-ChocolateyZipPackage (or maybe is does that automatically).\n. Ah now I see.. the function doesn't exist yet. I'm slow. :P\n. I'd like to reference this post about env vars and finding the bin path as it is closely related to this issue:\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/221#issuecomment-11603183\n\n**Quote:**\n\nIs `$env:ChocolateyInstall` automatically set when Chocolatey is installed? Because we can use something like:\n\n``` PowerShell\nfunction Get-BinPath {\n    # Calculate $binRoot, which imo should always be set in $env:chocolatey_bin_root as a full path (not relative)\n    if($env:chocolatey_bin_root -eq $null) {\n        $binRoot = \"$env:ChocolateyInstall\\bin\"\n    }\n    # My chocolatey_bin_root is C:\\Common\\bin, but looking at other packages, not everyone assumes chocolatey_bin_root is prepended with a drive letter.\n    elseIf (-not($env:chocolatey_bin_root -imatch \"^\\w:\")) {\n        # Add drive letter\n        $binRoot = join-path $env:systemdrive $env:chocolatey_bin_root\n    }\n    else {\n        $binRoot = $env:chocolatey_bin_root\n    }\n    return $binRoot\n}\n```\n. If the Chocolatey installer would set `$env:chocolatey_bin_root = \"$env:ChocolateyInstall\\bin\"` the effect would be the same, but more straight-forward for the user to change the bin location because the default is set rather than made up by the package if it does not exist.\n\nThese are just thoughts based on things I found confusing as a new user.\n. The first part is explaining how the Install command works as it is now. The second part explains something I cannot do. What part do I need to explain in a different way?\n\nCan you provide an example or link to documentation for all three?\nI haven't seen documentation on this. I will add them to the quick guide.\n- Unzip location\n- Partial unzip\n- (!) Make link in start menu\n. Ah thanks. I see partial unzip is limited for my purposes. So I mentioned it in another Enhancement #220, maybe it can be file-specific.\n\nWow I see it's actually quite powerful, being able to add file associations and pin stuff. I haven't found the specific start menu functionality yet, but pinning is close in essence.\n\nOnce I figure out specific stuff I will add it to the documentation under \"examples\" or \"common tricks\", because if it's easier for others to make packages, there is a bigger chance of more people making packages, which (in my opinion) is good. :)\n. I think this comes really close: _https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/tree/master/src/helpers/functions_\n\nI think only `$desktop` needs to change in:\n\n``` powershell\n$desktop = $([System.Environment]::GetFolderPath([System.Environment+SpecialFolder]::StartMenu))\n```\n\nAs seen in this documentation: http://www.programmersheaven.com/2/Les_CSharp_15_p2\nOf course renaming $desktop to something sensible like $start\n\nBut I'd need someone who actually understands Chocolatey and Powershell to test this and create a directory in the start menu called Chocolatey so Chocolatey-installs won't clutter the root of the start menu, which I don't know how to do.\n\nAm I overlooking something?\n. Nope, swamped too. :( And not enough Powershell knowledge (yet) to fix things within an acceptable timeframe. I think it would take me literally 10 times longer than someone who understands both Powershell and Chocolatey well.\n\nI really hate Powershell, because I have such a hard time reading it.\n\nPHP, Javascript, Python, they are all very natural and there is hardly a learning curve. You often get what is going on by looking at it for the first time.\n\nBut Powershell is **pure syntactic salt**, line for line.\n\nWhen I look at Powershell, almost every single line makes me feel like I have dyslexia. Last time a Microsoft language looked acceptable to me was when I was typing MSX-BASIC.\n\nOkay, end of rant. :)\n\nNice find in the link though!\n. It might be good to have the work of getting the wanted bin path in a separate module, so we can use Get-BinPath (or whatever) for any purpose, not just installing a tool.\n\nWhat does the referenced `$(Split-Path -parent $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Definition` actually do? In my powershell I get a spacebar.\n\nIs `$env:ChocolateyInstall` automatically set when Chocolatey is installed? Because we can use something like:\n\n``` PowerShell\nfunction Get-BinPath {\n    # Calculate $binRoot, which imo should always be set in $env:chocolatey_bin_root as a full path (not relative)\n    if($env:chocolatey_bin_root -eq $null) {\n        $binRoot = \"$env:ChocolateyInstall\\bin\"\n    }\n    # My chocolatey_bin_root is C:\\Common\\bin, but looking at other packages, not everyone assumes chocolatey_bin_root is prepended with a drive letter.\n    elseIf (-not($env:chocolatey_bin_root -imatch \"^\\w:\")) {\n        # Add drive letter\n        $binRoot = join-path $env:systemdrive $env:chocolatey_bin_root\n    }\n    else {\n        $binRoot = $env:chocolatey_bin_root\n    }\n    return $binRoot\n}\n```\n\nIt would make packages with extra sorcery (like Install-ChocolateyExplorerMenuItem) a lot easier.\n. Huh? You don't have to define a `version` in `chocolateyInstall.ps1`?\n\n``` PowerShell\n$name = 'rismoney'\n$url  = 'http://www.rismoney.com/rismoney-v1.0.2_setup.exe'\ntry {\n    Install-ChocolateyPackage $name 'EXE' '/SILENT' $url\n    Write-ChocolateySuccess $name\n} catch {\n  Write-ChocolateyFailure $name $($_.Exception.Message)\n  throw\n}\n```\n\nIs all. You just edit the `url` and the `nuspec` on update. Am I missing something?\n. But that one is not predictable, we do not know if the next one is gonna be called `1.0.3`, `1.1.0-unicode`, or has a different name/url than before. So we would always need to change that manually.\n\nMaybe I'm not aware of another function/reason that requires keying in this version somewhere else except for the software download path. In that case, I am sorry for providing my two cents. :)\n. Git is confusing (to a newbie), This is a separate change but it's automatically added to this pull-request.\n\nI thought a pull-request was a request to verify and merge the changes that were made up until the pullrequest was done, but I need to create a new branch for every different change?\n\n@rismoney Thanks for the help, but what do you mean by _\"Change the bottom 4 commits to fixup instead of pick\"_?\nAlso, I'm especially interested in preventing this. I thought a pull meant an exact replica from the root of the folder.\n\n@ferventcoder With this latest commit you can repair your `foobar2000` package. I am succesfully using it for a new `Rename Master` package but it's not for the public yet because it requires the first (bunch of) commits.\n\nCheck it out. Usage:\n`$url = Get-FilenameFromRegex \"http://www.foobar2000.org/download\" '/getfile/([\\w\\d]+)/foobar2000_v1.1.18.exe' 'http://www.foobar2000.org/getfile/$1/foobar2000_v1.1.18.exe'`\n\nIt could even automatically install the latest version if you regex a second match around the version number, but there is a limitation in `Get-FilenameFromRegex` that makes it replace the first match only, but that is probably easily fixed by someone more seasoned with PowerShell development. :P\n. This stuff about branching.\nSo much to learn, so little time..\n. So I should fork my own master so I can play around without affecting this pull-request, and fork it everytime I do a pull-request, right?\n\nHow does this actually work in regards of Chocolatey? Do you check/accept/reject requests when a new version is about to come out? Should I send these requests to other forks by people who also worked on the original files?\n. I see. Thanks for explaining. I'll leave 'my' master alone for now until I figure out how to do all that branching and merging and master mirroring without screwing it up and getting my paths mixed.\n\nI have fulltime work too. Js developing mostly. I just look like a noob all the time because\n- I am new to PowerShell (and I find it syntacticly horrible)\n- I am new to GitHub (using it for code anyway)\n- I am new to Chocolatey/NuGet, and I like to commit while spending the least amount of time possible actually understanding the inner workings of either of them, while still adding value in the form of packages or helpers.\n. Splitting pull requests\n. This thing has not made it in yet?\n. Also fixed Dutch language\n. I was wondering, is the `Start Menu` directory in Windows translated internally from English to the locale, or vice-versa?\n\nIf so, this becomes a hell of a lot easier:\n\n```\n  $appData = [environment]::GetFolderPath([environment+specialfolder]::ApplicationData)\n  $destPath = Join-Path \"$appData\" \"Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\\"\n  $destLink = Join-Path \"$destPath\" \"Name Of Target.lnk\"\n\n  $shell = New-Object -comObject WScript.Shell\n  $shortcut = $shell.CreateShortcut($destLink)\n  $shortcut.TargetPath = Join-Path \"C:\\Path\\To\\Binary.exe\"\n  $shortcut.Save()\n```\n. A reminder that the old version that only works on English systems is still unfixed one year later:\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/helpers/functions/Install-ChocolateyPinnedTaskBarItem.ps1\n. bump\n\n2015 alert. We need this.\n. Where is the discussion about this? You might be right, but I have no\nrecollection of year old decisions. :P\n\nAnyway, this needs to be automated in installZipPackage, where a lot of GUI\ntools now get a command-line shim when they would actually need a start\nmenu entry.\nE.g. SomeGraphicalTool.STARTMENU creates a user-friendly entry in Start\ninstead of a power-user Shim.\n\nThere are a lot of new packages with GUI tools that (automatically) create\nshims, making these packages valid for power users only. There needs to be\nan easy way to have shims for the really nerdy tools, and start menu\nentries for packages that average users might want to have pre-installed on\ntheir laptops.\n\nOp vr 17 jul. 2015 om 14:00 schreef Rob Reynolds notifications@github.com:\n\n> I thought we decided to prefer Install-ChocolateyShortcut over this -\n> https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/blob/master/src/chocolatey.resources/helpers/functions/Install-ChocolateyShortcut.ps1\n> ?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/228#issuecomment-122256001\n> .\n.

What's the reason for that?\n\nFor trivial but handy functions, a global `tricks.ps1` or whatever might be easier on the eyes (contemplating a future where there are multiple trivial functions globalized) when looking inside the functions directory.\n\nJust curious. \n(Knowledge is acceptance and acceptance is peace of mind. ;))\n. Can I assign myself to this?\n. I wanted to attach the pull request here but I guess that's not possible or I am still too new with GitHub :P But here:\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/231\n. The idea is to write less code, not more ;)\n\nAlso, the idea is to make sense for people less tech-savvy but with a wish to make packages. Like my grandma. She would like to make packages, and she called me three times, worried about words like `processorAddressWidth`. She thought it would have to be measured in centimeters haha, silly woman. She knows what bits are though, because 30 years ago she had `System 1` _8 bits_. She also complained that it was renamed to Macintosh _128k_ a few years later, saying it was confusing.\n\nSeriously though, I named the function `Get-ProcessorBits` in the pullrequest. Get two people to agree with you and I'll change it.\n. Closed with unmerged commits. Can I delete the branch?\n. Okay, the Redsandro:getSystemBits  branch has been deleted.\nGithub proposed this, but I'm still a bit foggy on Git and what impacts what so I needed to ask to be sure. :)\n. _Gep13_ said:\n\n>  I believe that this may also solve Issue 218 as well:\n> #218  \n\nThis adds a shortcut to the desktop which does not make the application appear in the Windows 7 or Windows 8 start menu. It is not indexed for searching. \n\nThis https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/228 allows pinning to start. I use it in my own installers, but this should really be included in Chocolatey imo.\n\nI think it'd be best to encourage packagers to do pin to start anything that is _not_ a _command line tool_ as discussed here: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/305\n. I am still unsure about what you mean in the description, but once I do, I can add this to the pull request.\n. Also, I am not sure if this is partially related, but I would like a \"pkgSource\" INSIDE the `nuspec`. That way, a simple package update only requires one file to be edited instead of two.\n\nOh yeah, and if this is going to be an environmental variable, the very essence of #306 is to keep a global naming convention, so this parameter should be `$env:ChocolateyPkgRoot` or `ChocolateyPackageRoot`.\n\nLet's keep all the Chocolatey related env vars in that tiny little \"windows env viewer\" prepended with \"Chocolatey\".\n. Apart from that, is it possible to add a custom property to the nuspec and have the value in the .ps1 install script?\n. I think it should warn though, if something like that is possible.\n\n_Could not package your package because .NET is not installed._\n. I believe running `nuget` actually sais dotnet is missing, but the `cpack` command fails silently. No mention of anything went wrong.\n. I removed the dependency for now in order to get the package to install on my testing VM, so I could push a  new version of [Rename Master](http://chocolatey.org/packages/renamemaster/3.4).\n. I don't fully understand what you are saying because this dependency thing worked before and it had the same source. But if I understand correctly, it's something that is planned to be fixed.\n\nUntil then, better no chocolatey dependencies?\n. Ah I see, thank you for clearing that up!\n. Appended your explanation to the Wiki: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages#testing-your-package\n. The problem is fixed for the website and feeds if people just use html characters, like `&micro;Torrent`.\n. If it works, then I am happy.\n\nBut personally I find it more important that all these _\"trashy\"_ looking packages show up nicely on the site. \n\nAll these \"???\" failed encoding symbols degrade the _perceived_ quality of packages or the whole Chocolatey system for users.\n\nSo if every maintainer would just fix those ???'s into proper encodings **until** it is no longer necessary, no one will notice the encoding is screwed up under the hood.\n. Okay, that sucks.\n\nBut the fact is, this unicode thing doesn't work. _It should,_ but it doesn't. Only ansi.\n\nI'm concerned about the page looking wrong. So for now, packagers shouldn't use unicode characters. Use (C) (R) u etc. in stead.\n\n![Failed characters](http://i.imgur.com/UMCgQgQ.png)\n. I didn't know that, thanks for looking it up.\nSo these problematic packages have a nuspec that was saved with improper encoding.\n\nYes, please add a note to the wiki. :)\n. ![Geany Editor Encoding](http://i.imgur.com/cUcaNDz.png)\n. You recognize Geany. That's cool! :smile: \n. Wow, that's elaborate.\n\nI've added a line to the [guide for people who don't like reading](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackagesQuickStart):\n- You **must** save your files with _UTF-8_ character encoding without BOM.\n\nIf you anchor your character encoding paragraph, I can link to it.\n. Speaking of wiki rules, those rules are annoying to read for people who have ~~sexdaily~~ dyslexia or otherwise have difficulty reading.\n\nIt is pragmatically clever to have every basic rule summarized within the rule and **bold** that section.\n\nE.g.:\n\n> - Packages of software that is illegal in most countries in the world are prohibited to publish on chocolatey.org. This applies in particular to software that violates the copyright, pirated software and activation cracks. Remember that this also affects software that is especially designed to accomplish software piracy.\n\nCould be:\n\n> - **Don't package illegal software.** Packages of software that is illegal in most countries in the world are prohibited to publish on chocolatey.org. This applies in particular to software that violates the copyright, pirated software and activation cracks. Remember that this also affects software that is especially designed to accomplish software piracy.\n. TomOne, I don't see your section yet.

I have no _\"ANSI as UTF-8\"_ option, only _\"UTF-8 without BOM\"_\n\n![Notepad++ encoding](http://i.imgur.com/RZDUqgL.png)\n\nVersion 6.2.2 Build Nov18 2012. (year old)\n. Oh you're right! It goes back to ANSI.\n. Documentation is important, especially for new people. Who get a first impression. So I got a few suggestions if I may. :smile: \n- Provide an easy solution that does not scare away potential new packagers\n- Provide links when obvious. \n- ~~Always write Chocolatey with a capital, just like God.~~ hmm oops I guess this is not the case on the website.\n- A sidebar-like **note** should not be a bullet point. Bullet points should illustrate must-read important points. Notes should be optional and clearly separated from a rule list. (Dyslexia approved documentation)\n\nSuggested edit that implements all of these:  \n\n---\n\n## Character encoding\n\n**Either:**  \n- **Do not use _non-`ASCII`_ characters.**  \n\n**Or:**  \n- **Use the UTF-8 character encoding** for the `*.nuspec` and `*.ps1` files. If you don\u2019t respect this rule, some characters are not displayed correctly in the [Gallery on Chocolatey.org](http://chocolatey.org/packages), because the Gallery assumes `UTF-8`.\n- **Do not save your `*.nuspec` files with a Byte Order Mark** (BOM). A `BOM` is neither required nor recommended for `UTF-8`, because it can lead to several issues.\n- **PowerShell scripts need to be saved in UTF-8 _with_ `BOM`.** PowerShell is ignoring the standards and needs a `BOM` in order to recognize scripts as `UTF-8`. Otherwise it processes non `ASCII` characters incorrectly. \n- Don\u2019t use the default Windows Editor. In addition to its lack of features, it can\u2019t even save `UTF-8` files without `BOM`. Alternatives:\n  - [Notepad++](http://chocolatey.org/packages/notepadplusplus)\n  - [Geany](http://chocolatey.org/packages/geany)\n- **You have to specify the `UTF-8` encoding** in the first line of your `*.nuspec` files like so: `<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>`.\n\n**Note:** There is a lot of confusion in the world of character encodings: For example, `ANSI` is an incorrect term for the internal Windows character encodings, e.g. `Windows-1252`. But you should not use this encoding family anyway. In addition, Notepad++ incorrectly uses the term _ANSI as UTF-8_ for `UTF-8` encoded files without a `BOM`. If you select `UTF-8` in Notepad++, it means `UTF-8 with BOM`. Therefore Notepad++ must show `ANSI as UTF-8` in the statusbar.\n\n---\n. > Good suggestions, except this one\n\nWell, I bet 95% of package maintainers (including myself) never gave it a thought and everything works as long as you stick to `ASCII` characters, because the encoding doesn't really matter then.\n\nSo, in practice (practice trumps theory) it's a proper and within packages widely used solution until you are a seasoned packager and want to do crazy stuff like:\n\n## \u03bcTorrent, \u00a9 2013 bitTorrent\u2122\u00ae\n. @TomOne: Thanks! :)\n\nAlthough I disagree with your story. Meet Hank. Always in a hurry. Dyslexic. Hates reading. Hates editors. Hates Windows. Doesn't care about other people's mess, but cares about end user quality.\n\nWill he be scared away by half a page of encoding guidelines, or will he be saved by a simple rule to keep in mind?\n\nThe fact is, there are many Richard-like package maintainers on Chocolatey.org. Without them, Chocolatey would be worth less. Hank-like packagers are better than Richard-like packagers.\n\nDon't chase away net quality improving Hanks. :runner: \n\nLet's agree to disagree.\n. Yes I know the docs, I run Debian myself. :bowtie: \n\nBut I would never be a Debian packager. Their process is why many popular software isn't packaged for Debian. That's why there has been an ITP (intent to package) of `Ubuntu One` for 5 years now and it still isn't there. `FreeFileSync` has been ITP for 3 years and never seen the light.\n\n> I\u2019m glad that I\u2019ve never met such a person. :smile:\n\nWell I might have exaggerated a bit, but here I am.\n\nLike Hank, I care about the quality of the user experience. Not about rules for the sake of rules, when it is proven that 9 out of 10 packages work fine when ignoring them. My packages are awesome, and apart from one*, they are all just default ANSI and no one will ever notice or care or have a problem with them.\n\n*) Hence my rule, for this one package your rules applied, and now it works fine too. User experience quality: 100%.\n\n(TBH I made one mistake in one package about guidelines but that one is unlisted now.)\n\n> Don\u2019t tell me that almost all Windows users are like Richard or Hank.\n\nI didn't say that. I said that _there are many Richard-like package maintainers on Chocolatey.org_ which is an exact quote from you. To prove my point. That if everyone would share my opinion, Chocolatey's supply would be higher quality than it is today, because Hanks care more than Richards.\n\nAnd to make it more fun, I actually think most Windows users _are_ Richards. Certainly not all. There are a lot of Bobs. Only the above-average Windows user will even know/use/package (for) Chocolatey, and you said it yourself: _there are many Richard-like package maintainers._ Imagine how many Richards there are in the entire pool of Windows users.  :scream: \n\n(Just to clarify, I'm contradicting you because I don't agree, but in no way do I want to imply that all Windows users are Richards. All devs are awesome. Windows devs are even more awesome because they have to dig through those weird Microsoft syntaxes. :stuck_out_tongue: )\n\n-edit-\n\nSame thing happened with the multipackage installation code I proposed. ferventcoder totally rewrote it in clever ways inside the vbs in stead of outside. But for the user experience the end result is the same. It's a great addition either way.\n\nLet's just say we all care about _something_ and we should applaud that. Am I wrong? :wink: \n. Microsoft chose `ANSI` and by `ANSI` they meant `Windows-1252`. I don't know if that's part of an _\"embrace, extend and extinguish\"_ strategy, but when I am on a Windows machine, it's the law.\n\nThey made that a default, and when I use that, everything works. Except for characters that you don't find on MSX-Basic either. So I don't use them. Windows doesn't care because it doesn't need to decode characters. As long as you don't use characters that need decoding.\n\nIt is extremely simple.\n\nYou are seriously comparing this to total chaos?\n\nI'm gonna write my next package in Notepad.exe and no one will notice. :smiling_imp: \n. Your Internet Explorer analogy is flawed. If there's one thing I keep repeating I care about most, it's user experience. Stay away from IE! :smile: \n\nI don't see how you don't get it. Fact: Most packages work perfectly. Fact: Most packages don't have or need character encoding because they don't need character decoding. Fact: If you do need decoded characters, you have to take care of character encoding.\n\nThese are the facts, so I am factually right, although you can disagree with my opinion about the thoughts that surround it.\n\nSo again, agree to disagree, or be wrong. Your choice. :P\nFor the rest, I'm not interested in discussing the matter any further.\n. Agreed, but when maintainers notice they 'suddenly' have a character problem, they should _want_ to read the guidelines in more detail and discover what is happening and fix the problem. If not, we give them a yellow card. :P \n. I don't think that will work. Once you save your file in standard (according to Windows) encoding, the character becomes unreadable when you reopen the file. But when I change encoding to utf-8, the char remains unreadable. I have to enter it again.\n\nBut if it will work, it's clever. What are computers for? To make our lives easier. :)\n. Once certain characters are \u25a1, _like \u25a1Torrent \u25a12013 bitTorrent\u25a1_, you can't get them back from a conversion.\n\nBut if you say there's no problem, I'm not gonna argue. I'd love to have `cpack` take care of this!\n\nI \u25a1 Unicode.\n\n-edit-\n\nI just tried. If you save it directly and load it directly, there is no problem. But if you save your package to a git repository, load it on a different machine and _then_ push it, it's already too late.\n\n-edit-\n\nOr something. I have had this, but am not exactly sure what step causes this.\n. This I like.\n\nAlthough I always thought `cpack` was just a reference plus some alternate configuration to the `nuget pack` binary. Customizing and compiling binaries seems like a difficult thing. But it's too far from my bed so what do I know. :) \n. This is clever. But also pretty far-fetched in my opinion. And by that I mean that no Windows packager with a right mind will have a bash interpreter running.\n\nI don't mean that as an insult because according to those rules, I don't have a right mind either. :P \n. Disregard my earlier message. I was thinking in terms of the `cpack` pipeline. I thought you were working towards a solution for all packagers from which there is no escape, preferably without them even knowing. :)\n. @TomOne [UTFCast Express](http://www.rotatingscrew.com/utfcast-express.aspx) might be relevant to your interests.\n\n(Did not use, just stumbled across)\n.

All I care about is that the `unicode` characters show properly in packages and on the website/gallery.\n\nThey don't by default (when using `BOM`).\n\n@TomOne figured out a set of rules to follow that makes the packages end up nicely with all unicode characters in the _chocolatey gallery._ Personally, I don't care or understand too much about the theory behind this. I do however know that it doesn't work properly if you don't follow this advise.\n\n## But\n\nIf you are saying that this is also possible with a simple fix in `cpack`/`cpush`, I'm all for that.\n\nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/functions/Chocolatey-Pack.ps1  \nhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/functions/Chocolatey-Push.ps1\n. Sweet! Are you sure you ignored all the 'rules'?\n\nDid @ferventcoder update things? Can you verify, @TomOne?\nIf anything, the instructions are sexier if we don't need the encoding hackery.\n. @jberezanski and @svnpenn were right to raise the issue. I guess the character guidelines are obsolete.\n. Anyway, I strongly encourage you to merge this (and port it to the monolith if you want, but merge it first). When you do this trick on a random strangers laptop, they become so happy, you get instant Chocolatey fans. But it won't work if they install Chocolatey on someone elses laptop. Until this is merged, that is. ;)\n. Nope, it works fine here. Single packages are handled exactly as before. I just installed putty to confirm your response but I had no problem. This is Windows 7 Home Premium with .NET 4.0.\n\n`cinst.bat` is shorthand for `chocolatey.cmd`, and that is the one I changed. 99% of people will use cinst. 0,9% of people will use `chocolatey.cmd` And you want to hold off the update to accomodate for the other 0,1%? (PS Don't get offended by my exaggeration skills, that's just how I communicate. ;) )\n\nAnd your pipe example is a totally bad unintuitive crazy kinda Chocolatey-will-never-get-popular-this-way language construct IMO. I just want to see this Chocolatey be more like... well, every other package manager out there in the Linux world so that you can actually guess how it works.\n\n`apt-get install geany firefox vlc chromium libreoffice filezilla`\n`yum install apache2 php mysql vsftp mongodb`\n`chocolatey install 7zip vlc putty GoogleChrome firefox filezilla`\n`cinst 7zip vlc putty GoogleChrome firefox filezilla`\n\nThere I fixed it. You're welcome. ;)\n. Are you running windows XP or an older .NET? Or did you make an accidental typo when trying my code?\n\nBecause if it is the former that does not like the code, I can rewrite the batch in MS-DOS style. Uglier but maybe more compatible? (I'm just guessing here) I thought XP already did work with the 'new' syntax though.\n. One last thing, I am not _\"Relying on the count of params\"._ It just batches all params one by one.\n. Oh! I misunderstood you! You are correct. Let me get back to you when I am\nnot asleep. My mistake. I got a solution.\nOn Jun 26, 2013 6:49 AM, \"Rich Siegel\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> i am not using alpha version (which is the one on github iirc)\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/304#issuecomment-20027033\n> .\n. You were absolutely right. When you said _\"cinst putty -Version 0.62.0.1 works before this change but not after.\"_ I thought you just mentioned the version of putty as a courtesy to me to be able to verify, instead of meaning an actual command. I should have picked up on the minus sign, but you can also use `backticks` to minimize confusion.\n\nHaving said that, I now remember why I didn't push this mod in the first place when I made it: Although I personally don't care about version management and just ignored it - I only use Chocolatey to batch install 30 apps on a clean system for others, and additional apps for myself although I rarely use Windows - I know I purposely ignored the rest of the commands and _that_ is why I shouldn't push this. I just forgot about it after a long time.\n\nHowever, I do seriously mean that this feature is **absolutely invaluable** to the point that I'd rather create a custom installer for myself and everyone I recommend Chocolatey to, than wait 15 months for someone to port this to `ps`.\n\nOn a more positive note, I just fixed all the problems in my latest commit. :) You can now either install multiple packages, or give commands using -wildcards as specified in `chocolatey /?`.\n. Single:\n\n``` cmd\nC:\\Users\\Redsandro>cinst notepadplusplus\nChocolatey (v0.9.8.20) is installing notepadplusplus and dependencies. By installing you accept the license for notepadplusplus and each dependency you are installing.\n______ notepadplusplus.install v6.3.3 ______\n# blah blah\n```\n\nAdded commands (works with all commands):\n\n``` cmd\nC:\\Users\\Redsandro>cinst notepadplusplus -version 2.24.1\nChocolatey (v0.9.8.20) is installing notepadplusplus and dependencies.

As far as I know, `$command` is always the first and `$packageName` is always the second, because they are not used as `wildcards`. I don't think that `ps` does automatic shifting if the first is actually `$version` but is extracted.\n\nI think this is pretty rock-solid. But in the end you can break everything if you want it to, especially this hideous thing called `powerscript`. But this implementation does everything **the way `chocolatey /?` says** it is done. At least as far as I have tested.\n. Also, don't underestimate the power of `cmd`. The `ps` does not require fixing. But you're right I'm curious to others' opinions too.\n\nI do know the opinion of non-technical users. It has astounding similarities with the last sentence in the chorus of _Thrift Shop_ by _Macklemore_.\n\nAs a final exposition I would like to constrain how much added value this is to normal users. And we're all busy people, the smallest `ps` features take forever to get in mainline.\n\nThe reason that I am pushing this so vividly is that I had four people applaud enthousiasticly this Chocolatey trick I did, and when they mention they want to implement that in their own workflow, I have to explain that I'm using a custom version and they need to copy my _blabla.cmd_ to _yaddah yaddah_ (translated into how they perceive my instructions) and they are like: Wut? http://goo.gl/OdpNo\n. Wow, it's handy to know powershell. :P \n\nDetails are very important. Details can even make an overpriced turd popular. Just look at Apple Inc. That's why I'm seemingly nitpicky, but please understand it is only because I care. :)\n\nThat said, this is a big step forward. But it's still unintuitive-ish. These days, smartphones come without a manual because everything is tackled in the simplest feasible decimation. People (can) rely on that. Not needing comma's is a smartphone that doesn't need a manual. Otherwise we'd have to explain in the manual: _We know the 10 most popular package managers use space delimited package lists for batch installation, but we need a comma separated list because [insert reason the user doesn't really care about]_.\n\n**Especially if you promote Chocolatey as _\"like apt-get\"_.**\n\nI know, semantically _\"like\"_ allows for variations. But that's not how the world, users from the three most popular distro's that use apt-get, and google, work.\n\nWe can probably use both btw. Just putting it out there.\n. > this requires comma between package names.  \n\nTemporarily? :P\n\nComma is inherent to powershell array afaik so I'm not sure how you propose to do that, but that last comment makes me happy. :)\n. That simple huh.\n\nBy c# replacing ps, do you mean you want to rewrite the entire monolith?\n. I don't understand the consequences of removing something that needs to stay in, but this is a huge step in the usability of Chocolatey! I am happy.\n\nAlthough I didn't test anything (already got a working batcher in place ;)) so I don't know if those **rismoney** testcases will hold up.\n. So once **rismoney** approves, I suggest uploading a new release as soon as possible. YESTERDAY!\n. Yes I approve with a smile on my face. :)\nDid not expect to have this available (through `-prerelease`) _today_.\n. Not really understanding what you mean. I thought your auto-update packages did something like that. I don't really understand those either. :P But apart from that, aren't _all_ package sources hardcoded? We would need to have a sources registry. In which case we might as well add the silent installer switches to a registry. And the installation code. And we wouldn't need packages anymore.\n\nSorry I am probably misunderstanding this. :P\n. Or should I have put this in `src\\helpers\\functions\\` and added to `src\\helpers\\chocolateyInstaller.psm1` in order for it to work like this?\n\nIdk, I tested it inside packages themselves (because I already pushed one), not sure where to put it in the monolith.\n. I did Fus Ro Dah push (--force) and added to `chocolateyInstaller.psm1` as well.\nPlus made it more maintainable (readable) (deja vu).\n. Note that this package also features backwards compatible transitioning between old and new $env: as first mentioned here: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/216#issuecomment-11639464\n\n> I would even go as far as renaming `chocolatey_bin_root` to `ChocolateyBinRoot` so it has the same naming convention as `ChocolateyInstall`.\n\nAs part of my quality assurance policy described here: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/304#issuecomment-20126209\n\n> Details are very important.

I did\n\n```\ngit remote add upstream git://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.git\ngit fetch upstream\ngit merge upstream/master\n```\n. I thought so too (should). Maybe I error-ed in some other way. I'll see what happens next time I create a new module.\n. Oh yeah I see. You have to click on the different version first.\n. > Also, `cup` ends without error if there's an error like package exists or trying to install same version.\n\nThis is a valid issue though, I just had it again, forgot I already upgraded on a machine:\n\n``` cmd\nC:\\Users\\Redsandro>cup tomboy -pre\n...

How did this suddenly turn into something I don't quite follow? :smile: \n\nIt's actually possible to have the package repo fire up a VM and test the package?\n\nWhat if thee of us upload a package at the same time, three VMs will launch and we need three MS licenses?\n\nI think the registry snap compare to check for bs is a bit tough though, updated software often has new fingers in the registry, so it would need manual updating.

Just a thought, this would also help prevent the necessity of triaging in certain cases. Why not have a VM build ~~all~~ ~~some~~ core team Automatic Packages? We wouldn't need to be running Windows and a scheduler. Give a virtual `chocolatey` user some pushing to do. :)\n. > Can you elaborate more on this @Redsandro\n\nIn this case I'm actually not talking about Boxstarter, but in the light of this being a Chocolatey topic, the talk about VMs gave me this idea. Automatic packages need to be automatically generated on computers running all the time (or at least frequently). I don't run Windows, so I cannot turn my packages into automatic packages.\n\nWhy not have a VM do this, and have the user [Chocolatey](http://chocolatey.org/profiles/Chocolatey) user push them, as described in the [community packages repo](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-coreteampackages).\n\nFor every package that is stuck unupdated with an unresponsive maintainer, we (or someone who decides this) can just 'kidnap' the stuck package, turn it into an autopackage, and hand it over to the VM/Chocolatey user.\n. **Idea 1**\n\nConcerning the packages that are similar because owners don't respond and someone else decides to upload a newer version under a different name:\n\nMaybe there should be a small group of moderators with the power to take over packages, remove the install script, add a dependency to the new package, or add the new package owner to the old package (to keep the sensible name).\n\nI wanted to install Visual Studio for someone the other day, and there are like 40 packages. No idea which one I need. Maybe it's a bad example, but I had something like this before with some SQL implementation, and I remember having to compare versions, and guess which one I should install.\n\n**Idea 2**\n\nAutomation. Set a clock (for e.g. 30 days) when a package maintainer is contacted for an update, and if they didn't respond within that timeframe, automatically add core team members as package owners and remove the old owner.\n. Is it possible to automate a system to move packages to MyGet, which I know nothing about, but @gep13 recommended for alternative package hosting?\nWould be cool if moderators could 'move' invalid packages to a separate 'stream'.\n. @TomOne said on _Dec 7 2013_:\n\n> Yes, I agree with you. But remember that many of these name prefixed and duplicate packages were created **before** I suggested the package rules and added them to the wiki after Rob had approved them. \n\nGuidelines like https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/316 and https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/317 are still being ignored well over half a year after I raised the issue. Soon every popular package will have a funny name, and only future obscure ones will be named properly. I recently came across `HitmanProPortable_x64` and `HitmanProPortable_x86`. Thee \"violations\" in one package name. This slowly growing library of bad names can be (partially) prevented using some relatively easy tricks.\n1. Put [the **entire** packaging guidelines text](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages#rules-to-be-observed-before-publishing-packages) in the confirmation mail. ([see comment 30056205](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/342#issuecomment-30056205))\n2. Put [the **entire** naming guidelines](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages#naming-your-package) in the confirmation mail.\n3. Have `cpack` run checks, especially on the package `id`.\n   - Similar to @TomOne's [idea](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/294#issuecomment-27622632) to have `cpack` prevent users from messing up encodings in https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/294\n   - If it matches `/portable/i` but not `/\\.portable$/`, refuse to pack/push.\n     - Friendly message why.\n   - If there's a period `.` not followed by `installer$` or `portable$`, refuse to pack/push.\n     - Friendly suggest replacing dots by dashes with example. E.g.: `my.sweet.package` -> `my-sweet-package`.\n   - Same with underscores `_`.\n. That would help indeed.\n\nBut how would you typify _\"easier\"_? I think a moderation system could be in place a year from now. And as I said before, a poor solution in practice is infinitely better than a perfect solution in theory. (And I'm not even saying the solution is poor.)\n\nThe above 'trick' **1** and **2** could be in place today, because it doesn't require too much thinking or efford.\n\nI can make a proposal with links instead of inline rules (because I cannot figure out how html markup works).\n. Here you go: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org/pull/87\n\nFeel free to word it any way you see fit.\n. I agree, but I'm not sure where the line is drawn. Hell, I'm even annoyed by all the `.tool` `.installer` `.app` `.portable` `.commandline` and `.iDontKnowHowToCategorizeThisAppButOtherwisePeopleDontKnowWhatTheHellTheyAreDoing` packages, but that's the direction we're going.\n\nIn other words, this is something only **ferventcoder** can answer, I just made the rules more readable without actually changing them, and I need some kind of permission before I go ahead and update the wiki. :smile: \n. @TomOne Isn't `.install` the default/obvious way to go? I understand `.portable` but appending `.install` to pretty much every package is pretty silly in my golden opinion.\n\nI discovered Chocolatey when googling apt-get for windows. apt-get is intuitive. Both `apt-get` and `cinst` can do `cinst firefox freefilesync libreoffice` now.\n\nBut do I understand you correctly that this would be `cinst firefox.install freefilesync.install libreoffice.install` in the future? That would be kinda retarded.\n\n> They are essential to understand what the package contains.  \n\nFor `.portable` it is convenient. You can do `cinst pidgin` or `cinst pidgin.portable` (made up example). Makes sense. Intuitive.\nBut the _default_ shouldn't introduce command line bloat in my opinion. You could store all metadata in the package-id: `cinst pidgin.gpl3.x64.tags[internet,messaging].portable` but that's not how we should learn what's in the package, we got the package page with information to know what is in the package.\n. Ah ok, I interpreted that wrong. I have reading issues. :P\n\nSo folks can set a preference for either portable or installer? That makes some sense. :)\n. > And there are still folks which ignore the rules and guidelines in the wiki and use the deprecated suffixes.  \n\nNot so much as ignore, I think more like unaware of. Package maintainers should in my opinion get an email when the guidlines change considerably.\n. Ok I will apply them in about 30 seconds. :+1: \n. https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages#rules-to-be-observed-before-publishing-packages :+1: \n. There are many commercial and trial packages out there. This is not mentioned in the description. If it sounds nice and you try it out, only to find out it's a trial or you need a license immediately, it's annoying.\n\nI suggest adding the rule:\n- **Packaging commercial or trial software?** Clearly state this in the package description.\n\nWhat do you think?\n. Added. :thumbsup: \n. This could get more important over time. Let's put it on a future wishlist. :)\n. I found it: _This installation package could not be opened. Contact the application vendor to verify that this is a valid Windows Installer package._\n[[source](http://www.symantec.com/connect/articles/windows-installer-exit-error-codes-log-files)]\nI already contacted the package owners, though in my experience, I never ever get a reply. :P \n\nAnyway, the point of this issue report is more that in my opinion, `Chocolatey` should just show one error (once) and continue with the next package.\n. > WTF on number 2?\n\nYeah crazy. I just checked on another machine where it still had `Version: '0.9.8.21-alpha2'` installed. There `chocolatey /?` works fine.\n\n``` cmd\nC:\\Users\\Redsandro>chocolatey version\n\nfound         : 0.9.8.21-alpha2\nname          : chocolatey\nlatestCompare : 000000000000.000000000009.000000000008.000000000020\nverMessage    : Your version is newer than the most recent.

Now my terminal closes. Is that normal? I guess so. New terminal:\n\n``` cmd\nC:\\Users\\Redsandro>chocolatey version\n\nfound         : 0.9.8.21-beta1\nname          : chocolatey\nlatestCompare : 000000000000.000000000009.000000000008.000000000020\nverMessage    : Your version is newer than the most recent.

Please wait... Done.\n```\n\nAnd now for the test:\n\n``` cmd\nC:\\Users\\Redsandro>chocolatey /?\nCalls one batch program from another.\n\nCALL [drive:][path]filename [batch-parameters]\n\n  batch-parameters   Specifies any command-line information required by the\n                     batch program.\n\nIf Command Extensions are enabled CALL changes as follows:\n\nCALL command now accepts labels as the target of the CALL.  The syntax\nis:\n\n    CALL :label arguments\n(...)\n```\n\nSo yes, this `call /?` bug was introduced after `alpha2`.\n. How can I downgrade to the alpha from august? (latest after the beta was taken down)\n.

Although I was sure that it was already merged and I got the 'delete branch' message. Or maybe I'm going slightly mad.\n\nAnyway, can you tell us a statistical mean for how long it takes for current branch to become non-prerelease?\nThat's the moment when we can use this in live packages. :)\n. I added this to the `ruby` package and temporarily included the same `Get-BinRoot.ps1` file as an included script: https://github.com/ferventcoder/nugetpackages/pull/110\n\nThis can be a prototype fix for all packages that have this problem. The extra file can be removed from packages once `Chocolatey` is no longer pre-release.\n. You have my interest. I have no idea what you are saying, but I don't like batch redirects.\n\nWhat are shim files in this scope?\n. I'd also like to suggest that `Write-Host` comments should try to stick to an **80 character maximum**. as not to annoy a default-sized terminal. Better use two lines split in a more human way, than rely on auto-wrap.\n\n(Just like comments in most source code is traditionally no longer than 72 characters for readability.)\n. Sweet :)\nOn Mar 2, 2014 10:54 PM, \"Rob Reynolds\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> I am going to pull in #376https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/376though.\n> \n> ## \n> \n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/374#issuecomment-36468591\n> .\n.

Actually, it's often more like 3 lines placed in a more human-readable way over the original 3 lines autowrapped and broken mid-sentence. Unless you changed the width of the default terminal to span one and a half monitor.\n\nBut I thought about your suggestion before and I thought leave the first line/part and have the rest optional with a `-verbose` flag.\n\nOr as a middleground solution, get the width of the terminal, write a single line if it fits, write 3 lines if it doesn't.\n\nOr truncate the url in the output to only the domain, and truncate the target to only the filename. (Not a fan of this)\n. I like to emphasize the importance of prettifying the output. \n\nThere are two kinds of human _conscious perception_: _orderly_ (usually women) and _industrious_ (usually technical people). Right now, Chocolatey scores a 8 at _industriousness_ and a 2 at _orderliness_.\n\nStudies have shown that visual orderliness is psychologically associated with quality and trustworthiness. Right now the general output looks like a mess. I'm just saying that this issue is way more important than most _industriousness_ people (AKA developers AKA people here) think.\n\nI am also talking about #376 here. Of course you don't have to agree with my propositions, but you should do _something_.\n\nThink about spacing, new information should start at the same point the next line. Do not cram too much information on one line. Imagine the Linux dmesg boot process. It would be MUCH shorter if multiple pieces of information would be on the same line like in Chocolatey, but shorter is not always better. They are put below each other because it improves readability and thus the feeling of quality. Think about using color (#376) (orderly) in stead of ascii (industrious) as visual cue's.\n\nLet's be industrious where it counts (in the code) and orderly where it counts (in the output).\n\n(edit/ oh shoot wanted to post this at #374)\n. I am glad we could make a deal! :smile: \n. Cool.

I'm not even using `Yum` (`apt-get` here) but I am not surprised because #GMTA. :wink: \n\nTo illustrate that we don't need large error messages. Just output the error to the log, and output a _single line_ saying _installation failed_ to the output. It will say, e.g.\n\n``` cmd\n(...)\npaint.net installation failed. :(\n\nChocolatey installed 1 packages. 1 packages failed.\nSee the log for details.\nThe chocolatey gods have answered your request!\n```\n. > If we are going to say see the log for details, then I think we should include where the log file is located\n\nI agree*, as long as it fits in a 80 character line, otherwise it needs to be shortened.\n\n> or have a Read-Host, or something, asking if you want to open the log file.\n\nI absolutely disagree. Nothing should hang the process. Not waiting for input. It should be able to complete on it's own. Maybe with an exit code.\n\n> list the failed pkg names so one would not have to crack open a log file just to figure out what did not install.\n\nI agree*, but you would not have to open the log file to figure that out. Because now that the new output is actually a pleasure to read, you'll quickly spot a red line. Here's a colored mockup:\n\n![Clean output mockup for Chocolatey](http://i.imgur.com/heqzKz6.png)\nhttp://cssdesk.com/JUTPR\n\n> all verbose info that goes to the log should also gk to the console if -verbose is passed or $verbose preference is set to continue.\n\nI agree.\n\n> output psobjects to the pipeline with info like success/fail, exceptions, packagename\n\nI don't understand so I'll leave opinions to the professionals. :)\n\n*) There's more interesting stuff we could do, for example, list the dependencies of all packages after the to-be-installed packages. But I thought: Let's clean this up first, and add features later. Small steps have a bigger chance of actually being stepped. :)\n\nWe _could_ also remove the `To: %Temp%` line and put it in the log, because it doesn't really add anything. But the `From:` line is important (seeing (and trusting) the source is important).\n. Textually this is pretty awesome! :thumbsup: \n\nHowever, the color doesn't really add anything. And the text can be more 80-friendly. So please allow me to comment on that:\n1. Using all the same color has no visual benefit. Alternate between key information and verbose information (and successful information and error information) with color and weight.\n2. Take care of the default console width, you don't want a sentence wrap it's last two characters to the next line.\n   - Preferably, you don't want to wrap at all. You don't really have to be polite and say please to the user when you can say it in one line. :)\n\nMockup:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1702193/2741881/b860a346-c6f6-11e3-93e9-f80cc86c0488.png)\n. Ah I already made a two-package mockup, shame to throw it away. So I'll paste it anyway.\n\nBut sounds cool. I'm not sure about anything PowerShell either, but it is supported in Unix escape codes and I used to do that for `curses` text output in `python` scripts for Linux. They could be run on Windows too, and it just displayed the bold text in the console. I have no idea if `curses` does that or if the console just supports that natively.\n\n---\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1702193/2741972/b80c492e-c6f9-11e3-8f00-92fc3e1e0326.png)\n.

Very nice!\nThis is convenient for both audiences, neat and simple, or optional verbosity!\n\n:thumbsup: \n. Really cool. What language is that?\n(those lines you removed) :)\n. That's probably cool but not something that will get me excited.\nNow we're going to get all these hipster packages polluting the feed.\nBesides, OSX is totally different in every way, how would that work?\n. Oh I would love that for Linux!\n\nI find myself every now and then making a (requested) update, only having to wait a week before I have access to a Windows machine for `cpack` and `cpush`.\n. The current output and new colors are looking nice! :thumbsup: \n\nThe limegreen package titles are very distinctive, the output is friendly to look at.\n\nIf stuff goes wrong, the `-debug` optionally makes output very verbose.\n. Nothing wrong with it. I use regexes for other packages too. Just didn't think about using a bunch of them in a row.\nFeel free to improve. Coming from Linux myself, I didn't know powershell either when I discovered Chocolatey.\n\nMaybe your regexes are smarter, I just rewrote them because I don't get the `sed` syntax with all the comma's. :question: \n. Same problem again. Fixing the broken CNET parser needs all packages fixed. This should be internal, just like SourceForge is handled internally.\n. For reference:\nhttps://github.com/Redsandro/chocolatey/blob/master/autopackages/PartitionAssistant/tools/Get-UrlFromCnet2.ps1\n\nHowever, why does this return an array?\n\n```\n[0]    =>    True,\n[1]    =>    \"http://www.TheUrlThatIAmLookingFor'\n```\n. Thanks! :+1: \n. I still think helpers should have a certain format, and they should be packages that can be referenced as dependencies.\n\nOne change means one package to fix, and all packages that depend on it will work again.\n. I just tried it here on powershell, it's instant.\n\nYou can optionally add `[environment]::Is64BitOperatingSystem` before the first check, but I am not sure how to check between false and undefined (if there is such a thing in PS) to switch older OSses.\n\nLike (this code is not working in PS, but to give you an idea):\n\n``` ps\nif ([environment]::Is64BitOperatingSystem === True) {\n    $osArch = '64-bit'\n} elseif([environment]::Is64BitOperatingSystem === False) { # False != undefined\n    $osArch = '32-bit'\n}\n# on older systems, $osArch is undefined, so we can continue\nif (-Not $osArch) {\n    $os    = Get-WmiObject Win32_OperatingSystem\n    $osArch = $os.OSArchitecture\n}\n# ... etc\n```\n. Did it work with the testing? ;)\n\nI'm thinking this is an essential fix because I think the old code causes packages to try to install 64 bit software on 64 bit computers with a 32 bit OS installed. Didn't test that though, only people who don't use git install 32 bit OSses on 64 bit computers.\n\nBut I'm trying to make the general public addicted to Chocolatey. That includes intellectually challenged people, or people who for some other reason ended up with a 32 bit license and a 64 bit computer. :P\n. I'm on Linux so I only tested https://github.com/bill-long/chocolatey/pull/1 in my common sense emulator, but this should fix both old and new users. The Get-BinRoot is used in more packages than just `OHM` so it might be a good idea to implement this.\n.

Any volunteers I can make co-owner of `OpenHardwareMonitor` and `RenameMaster`, willing to `cpack` and `cpush`?\n- Source:\n  -  OpenHardwareMonitor\n    - https://github.com/Redsandro/chocolatey/tree/master/openhardwaremonitor\n  -  RenameMaster\n    - https://github.com/Redsandro/chocolatey/tree/master/renamemaster\n. Thanks. Added you.\n. @gep13 I agree, but `chocolatey` (the user associated with coreteampackages) never accepted co-ownership of some packages I wanted to put up there.\n\nI think (can't find it back this moment) @ferventcoder argued `coreteampackages` was only meant for certain specific widely used packages (contradicting your idea of _\"The more, the better\"_), otherwise `coreteampackages` would turn into a heap were people could just dump packages. And to some degree, he is right.\n\nAlso, I don't know how to autopackage, even with the nice tutorial. I'm on a Windows machine mostly during the weekends. And lately those weekends are reserved for a beautiful girl until further notice. I don't dare guessing the process without being able to test. :)\n\nAnd also also, RenameMaster can't be autopackage afaik, because it uses some download-trickery that requires human tinkering.\n. **Redsandro**\n\n> I want to drop some packages (..)\n> However people seem to use it (..) so it seems a shame to unlist and abandon it.\n> \n> How does this work? Do I create a pullrequest in the coreteampackages repo?\n\n**Ferventcoder**\n\n> The core team and core packages are/will be those pkgs that are critical/crucial. It is not a dumping ground for offloading packages that folks are no longer interested in maintaining.  \n\nJust quoting the essentials makes the communication lose it's nuance; you can read the full thing here: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/chocolatey/YyQn2Q2xmn0/LBXjjbGkvEIJ\n\nI'm definitely interested in what's going on there, thanks. I'll give you a shout when I have some more time to wrap my head around something new. :smile: \n. So in stead of the `Chocolatey` user, there are just some users (like you) who 'serve' autopackages under their own name?\n\nIf at some point in the future, I got a package auto'ed, I should add you as co-owner in stead of `chocolatey`?\n. Ah, okay, so my picture of the mise-en-sc\u00e8ne was right initially.\n\nIn order to qualify for being `anyone` you'd at least need to have a (periodically) running Windows machine. Your setup (and idea to have all autopackages at the same place anyway) sounds clever to me.\n\n`Chocolatey` didn't accept ownership for reasons outlined by ferventcoder. (And in the end I hadn't figured out how to auto my packages within the time I had set aside for the conversion anyway. Also, for some of the packages, [tonigellida](https://chocolatey.org/profiles/tonigellida) offered to convert them and host them, which I gladly accepted.)\n. :thumbsup: \n. Yeah it should, but there were some bugs. I introduced this as a\ntransitional thing, I think @ferventcoder had a different approach to\ncertain things in mind but I am not sure if that is one release away our\none year away. Is the bugfix merged with mainline (non-pre) release? I can\ndocument some of this in a quick fashion if that's a good idea.\n. @Nilzor, I Added the [Overview](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/HelpersReference#overview) section to the Helper documentation, hoping it might be helpful. I Added minimal summary for `Get-BinRoot` and `Get-ProcessorBits`. Would be helpful if others expand descriptions for other helpers in similar minimal fashion.\n. :warning: @ferventcoder, dude, you haven't merged the fix yet! We reckoned this is pretty critical.\n\nI know everybody is busy and all, but some pullrequests, especially ones that are deemed critical-ish, take (too) long to be merged. Also, discussion for things that are proposed but not merged due to indecisiveness between multiple parties is hard to keep track of, resulting in ideas and bugfixes evaporating in a vacuum of time and dreams.\n\nIf there's a solution to a problem, be it not in line with your personal vision, I'd recommend merging or applying the solution first, and apply your preference whenever you get around to doing it.\n\nA meager solution committed is always infinitely better than a perfect solution in your head.\n. I just created a simple script - that I am ashamed to have worked more than an hour on - that will automate helper documentation somewhat. See #458.\n. Great! :smile: \n\nHowever, to continue the discussion, I do actually think the default should be `$env:ChocolateyInstall\\bin` in stead of `c:\\tools` to prevent root clutter. I think it had always been that, but we accidentally introduced `c:\\tools` because the bug ignored the old default. (I think, not sure)\n. I added this proposed default to `Get-BinRoot.ps1` in branch _docGenerator_ #458 because that one has the embedded comments for the doc generator anyway.\n\nSee https://github.com/Redsandro/chocolatey-origin/blob/docGenerator/src/helpers/functions/Get-BinRoot.ps1\n\n(Of course feel free to change, e.g. %ChocolateyInstall%/tools in stead)\n. Since when do we have a markdown branch for the wiki? Me (and others) just\nuse the editor after a bit of discussion.\n\nThis change seems 100% objective and accurate so I would vote to just add\nit in the wiki which is now outdated indeed.\n\nOn Apr 16, 2014 8:40 AM, \"Frode Nilsen\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n. I have [applied](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages#1-path-provided-by-the-get-binroot-helper) your edit, and changed it slightly:\n- The `Ruby` package is a bad example because it might confuse users into embedding the old and buggy BinRoot. Changed it to `MinGW`.\n- The whole point of `Get-BinRoot` is to not install anything in the root if people forget to set BinRoot, so the `C:\\Ruby###` example is obsolete and will only happen if the package maintainer specifically forces it to install there, or if `C:\\` is set as the `BinRoot`, which is not currently possible due to https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/430 (And if it was up to me it woudln't ever be possible because that's just stupid (imo)).\n- The default path is gonna be either `%SystemDrive%:\\Tools` if https://github.com/bill-long/chocolatey/pull/1 is gonna be merged, or `%ChocolateyInstall%\\bin` to prevent the unpopular thing called clutter, which is under consideration over here https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/458\n\nFeel free to verify and improve the documentation. :)\n. @ferventcoder ssteward54 is right. Because this issue is starting to bug me, I downloaded an image from Modern.IE and installed Chocolatey. Next, I installed sysinternals. And indeed. ChocolateyBinRoot is set to C:.\n. ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1702193/2892753/b70bc9d2-d540-11e3-9b24-f90f80ca1881.png)\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1702193/2892773/e3a136e4-d540-11e3-8c30-2dfe75ed1943.png)\n. @ssteward54 please specify what package(s) cause this. I think maybe some package(s) might have the buggy binroot hardcoded.\n. Do we also need to address the issue where people now have environment `$env:ChocolateyBinRoot` set to `c:\\` because of this bug? It will continue to cause errors.\n\ni.e. pull this one: https://github.com/bill-long/chocolatey/commit/25f7865719e9b101a9860d0a4fa6cad2a0ed3c9d\n. And **until** then, merge the request I proposed. There's no need to have people with unusable broken installations just because we're contemplating future options when there's been a bugfix ready for 3 months now.\n. It was in this one, but @bill-long reverted that. @bill-long, could you\nun-revert that? Can't do much at the moment, I'm on vacation in Berlin with\nmy tablet. :)\nOn May 31, 2014 2:50 PM, \"Rob Reynolds\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> @Redsandro https://github.com/Redsandro is there a PR for that fix\n> somewhere?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/421#issuecomment-44747462.\n.

Thank you so much for testing this on Windows 8.1.\nI will advise people with this problem to update Chocolatey or clean their system.\n. PS - can you tell me what version of Chocolatey you were using?\n. I don't know why the installer recurses all the paths. But good catch.\n. Seems Chocolatey recurses the paths and uses the proper environmental variable impromerly set by getBinRoot.\n. Yes. I think it's ready for pulling now. If you agree with the fixes. Shall I close this one?\n. I have no recollection of this pull request. No idea what I was trying to do.\n. I guess it used to work, but it wasn't picked up, and now it needs work. \n\nI don't have time to look into this right now. Feel free to pick this up.

Same error.\n\n---\n\nOfftopic: \n\nVagrant is just VirtualBox with a command line wrapper around it, so there's no real difference between `vagrant up` or `modern.ie`, unless you got a special base box with all configuration done in advance. If you do not have a base box, creating a Vagrant instance is a lot more work than just clicking import on VirtualBox. In the end, the result is the same. A running vanilla-ish installation.\n\nWith that said, I didn't know there were Windows base boxes? I couldn't find them anywhere. I thought that was illegal. It does make life easier though. What's in them? How do you communicate with them? They have no ssh, right? How do you preconfigure them on the disk image without starting the license grace period?\n\nAlso, people don't just have a license lying around, that's why I use the `modern.ie` boxes.\n\n---\n\nPS - I already use `Vagrant` with a `Modern.ie` drive. I just didn't mention it because I find it irrelevant.\n. Interesting, I didn't know about these boxes!\n\nWhat do these include? The Modern.ie ones also include guest additions so you can use them without configuration, and after 30 days just remove and re-import them. Ssh would be nice but I can't seem to install stuff without starting the OS (and starting the license timeout)\n\n> You can try grabbing the evaluation ISO at http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2012-r2\n\nIsn't it better for chocolatey testing purposes (AKA figuring out why certain users have problems) to use the product most realistically used by the audience? I use these 'boxes', as in, I just import them and repack them to a box without _any_ kind of vagranty additives.\n\nhttps://modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools#downloads\n. Well like I said the error message is the same, but if you think the new version has more clues in it's output, I will gladly fire up a clean Win7 VM.\n\nBut **note** that the `gtksharp` package was updated (as per my request) to include `dotnet4.0` as a dependency and now `gtksharp` will install fine. Not sure what the impact is for this error, but at least the error in a life Windows installation (not VM) is gone.\n\n## Installing Chocolatey\n\n```\nMicrosoft Windows [Version 6.1.7601]\nCopyright (c) 2009 Microsoft Corporation.

Good find! It won't download a redirect at all, or HTTPS redirect in particular, or just this specific case?\n\nSince I got this in Windows 7, but the person who contacted me had a different error - related to DotNet4 needing a reboot, which is the error that would appear after the download was succesful and the script would proceed - he probably had a newer build (probably service pack); I am thinking that this error might be there in Windows <= 7.0 and not in Windows >= 7.1.\n. I thought `chocolatey` automatically installs `.NET 4.0`, or is that irrelevant concerning powershell?\n\nSorry if stupid question.\n. So ideally, in stead of timing out, it would either:\n- Stop with an error; or\n- Issue a _[WARNING] could not verify certificate of [xyz]_ and continue ignoring SSL:\n  - In Unix that would be `curl -k` or `curl --insecure`\n    - `-k`/`--insecure` (SSL) This option explicitly allows curl to perform \"insecure\" SSL connections and transfers. Starting with curl 7.10, all SSL connections will be attempted to be made secure by using the CA certificate bundle installed by default.\n. I don't fully understand what is happening, but if it works, it works.\nI will test this out in a vm that I know has this problem when new chocolatey is released.\n. Is there a way to install pre-release version directly? Instead of:\n\n```\n@powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy unrestricted -Command \"iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))\" && SET PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\chocolatey\\bin\n\nchoco install chocolatey -Pre\n```\n.

I don't want to handle reboots. It doesn't seem necessary, because the `DotNet4.0` package cancels this requirement out somehow.\n.

I prefer a non-shimmed binRoot for command line tools, and for everything else a subdirectory of `chocolatey` (like `lib` and `bin` already are). If anyone prefers something arbitrary like `C:\\Tools` they should **manually** make it so.\n\nWith players and browsers and libraries - not just tools but plain software - installing to `Get-BinRoot` ATM AKA `Tools`, I think software or programs or bin is a more intuitive and canonical name. It makes sense to put this inside `chocolatey` unless manually changed to something that has personal preference.\n\n> the need to Get-BinRoot should become non-existent\n\nWhat did I miss/forget?\n. Brutal honesty, nitpicking, lack of knowledge and a touch of ocd combined:\n\nI like to (re-)use my 'own' bin folder and be able to specify it as $binRoot for chocolatey. I like this bin directory to be copyable to USB sticks and between VMs. I like to pipe stuff between 'exe' files within batch files, being able to assume that the .exe files are in the same folders (relatively named). And I like, when some complicated piped script doesn't work, not to have to wonder if it's the shimming that causes a pipe to break.\n. ",

Another example would be in mwrock's package for Fiddler, he's manually checking to make sure that the correct version of .Net is installed and is installing it if it isn't. It isn't extremely difficult code to write but it gets a bit ugly without a fair bit of knowledge around how to manually check for dependencies and how to install windows features using DISM and _might_ have bugs (not saying it does...).\n\nI'm not sure why he isn't using Chocolatey's 'windowsfeature' source or 'webpi' source but that would be besides the point. If we had packages (physical, logical, or otherwise) that would allow us to specify all of the applications dependencies we wouldn't need to worry about how they were resolved as long as Chocolatey had the means to resolve it. As a bonus for creators of packages they wouldn't have to duplicate efforts or potentially introduce bugs in their installation or uninstallation process due to the oddities around what's available in which version (OS, architecture, language) of Windows they are being installed on.\n\nhttps://github.com/mwrock/Chocolatey-Packages/blob/master/fiddler/tools/chocolateyInstall.ps1\n\n```\n$tools = \"$(Split-Path -parent $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Definition)\"\n\nfunction Is64Bit {  [IntPtr]::Size -eq 8  }\n\nif(Is64Bit) {$fx=\"framework64\"} else {$fx=\"framework\"}\nif(!(test-path \"$env:windir\\Microsoft.Net\\$fx\\v2.0.50727\")) {\n  $packageArgs = \"/c DISM /Online /NoRestart /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:NetFx3\"\n  $statements = \"cmd.exe $packageArgs\"\n  Start-ChocolateyProcessAsAdmin \"$statements\" -minimized -nosleep -validExitCodes @(0,1)\n}\n\nInstall-ChocolateyPackage 'fiddler' 'exe' '/S' 'http://www.getfiddler.com/dl/Fiddler2Setup.exe'\n```\n. Would it be appropriate to create or generate packages that wrap what is available in the windowsfeatures and webpi sources? \n\nWhere there is an intersection we'd probably want to go with webpi since it would cover cases like NetFx3 not being present on WinXp and it needing to be downloaded as opposed to it being a windowsfeature in Win8.\n\nI think it could be automated relatively easily since the webpi feed is extremely well structured and covers OS/arch/lang variations. There would of course be gaps that windowsfeature would need to fill for Hyper-V, MSMQ and so on.\n\nI think there might be some merit to the generation of these packages since if nothing else it would help to simplify the install scripts and not require people to become familiar with what is available from the other sources. The install scripts would be simplified since there wouldn't be any additional dependencies to install in the script since the dependency would be fulfilled by Chocolatey. It would also be forward compatible if the nuspec parsing option was pursued. \n\nThanks for your responses I'm definitely becoming more familiar with the tooling and problems around dependency management thanks to this thread.\n. I have some free time this week and I've been meaning to dig into the WebPI APIs a bit so hopefully I'll be able to figure out some sane solution to generating some packages directly from the WebPI feed and which get installed using WebPI in their install script.\nhttp://blogs.iis.net/kateroh/archive/2010/02/11/webpi-apis-install-a-product-from-a-custom-feed.aspx\nhttp://blogs.iis.net/kateroh/archive/2010/02/27/webpi-api-load-balance-to-set-up-backend-servers-with-latest-microsoft-web-stack.aspx\nhttp://blogs.iis.net/kateroh/archive/2010/03/20/web-pi-apis-visualize-available-products-hierarchy-with-dgml.aspx\n.

That isn't a -windowsfeature option but it would be great to be able to use something like a virtual package to be able to say that I need to be able to mount an ISO, I don't care how, just do it. How would Chocolatey know that it doesn't need to cinst virtualclonedrive but can just instead use posh mount-diskimage if it doesn't have some knowledge about the features of the OS that it is running on?\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/web/webpi/4.6/webproductlist.xml\n\n``` xml\n<dependency>\n    <and>\n        <dependency>\n            <productid>StaticContent</productid>\n        </dependency>\n        <dependency>\n            <productid>IISManagementConsole</productid>\n        </dependency>\n    </and>\n</dependency>\n```\n\n``` xml\n<!--  Win7 / R2, x64  -->\n<!--  x64 English  -->\n<installer>\n<id>40</id>\n<languageid>en</languageid>\n<architectures>\n    <x64 />\n</architectures>\n<oslist>\n    <os>\n        <minimumversion>\n            <osmajorversion>6</osmajorversion>\n            <osminorversion>1</osminorversion>\n        </minimumversion>\n        <ostypes>\n            <server />\n            <homepremium />\n            <ultimate />\n            <enterprise />\n            <business />\n        </ostypes>\n    </os>\n</oslist>\n<eulaurl>...</eulaurl>\n<installerfile>\n    <filesize>6242</filesize>\n    <installerurl>\nhttp://download.microsoft.com/download/6/7/D/67D80164-7DD0-48AF-86E3-DE7A182D6815/rewrite_amd64_en-US.msi\n    </installerurl>\n    <trackingurl>...</trackingurl>\n    <sha1>CBB23944AF77F69E9B31357B114ADEBE12B3B1CE</sha1>\n</installerfile>\n<installcommands>\n    <cmdline>\n        <exe>%SystemRoot%\\System32\\net.exe</exe>\n        <commandlinearguments>stop was /y</commandlinearguments>\n        <ignoreexitcode>true</ignoreexitcode>\n    </cmdline>\n    <cmdline>\n        <exe>%SystemRoot%\\System32\\net.exe</exe>\n        <commandlinearguments>stop wmsvc</commandlinearguments>\n        <ignoreexitcode>true</ignoreexitcode>\n    </cmdline>\n    <cmdline>\n        <exe>%SystemRoot%\\System32\\cmd.exe</exe>\n        <commandlinearguments>\n/C reg.exe save \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\NET Framework Setup\\NDP\\v3.5\" \"%TEMP%\\__rewrite_netfx35_sp_level.txt\" /y\n        </commandlinearguments>\n        <ignoreexitcode>true</ignoreexitcode>\n    </cmdline>\n    <cmdline>\n        <exe>%SystemRoot%\\System32\\cmd.exe</exe>\n        <commandlinearguments>\n/C reg.exe add \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\NET Framework Setup\\NDP\\v3.5\" /v SP /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f\n        </commandlinearguments>\n        <ignoreexitcode>true</ignoreexitcode>\n    </cmdline>\n    <msiinstall>\n        <msi>%InstallerFile%</msi>\n    </msiinstall>\n    <cmdline>\n        <exe>%SystemRoot%\\System32\\cmd.exe</exe>\n        <commandlinearguments>\n/C reg.exe restore \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\NET Framework Setup\\NDP\\v3.5\" \"%TEMP%\\__rewrite_netfx35_sp_level.txt\" & del \"%TEMP%\\__rewrite_netfx35_sp_level.txt\"\n        </commandlinearguments>\n        <ignoreexitcode>true</ignoreexitcode>\n    </cmdline>\n    <cmdline>\n        <exe>%SystemRoot%\\System32\\net.exe</exe>\n        <commandlinearguments>start w3svc</commandlinearguments>\n        <ignoreexitcode>true</ignoreexitcode>\n    </cmdline>\n    <cmdline>\n        <exe>%SystemRoot%\\System32\\net.exe</exe>\n        <commandlinearguments>start wmsvc</commandlinearguments>\n        <ignoreexitcode>true</ignoreexitcode>\n    </cmdline>\n</installcommands>\n</installer>\n```\n. Another example would be in mwrock's package for Fiddler, he's manually checking to make sure that the correct version of .Net is installed and is installing it if it isn't. It isn't extremely difficult code to write but it gets a bit ugly without a fair bit of knowledge around how to manually check for dependencies and how to install windows features using DISM and _might_ have bugs (not saying it does...).\n\nI'm not sure why he isn't using Chocolatey's 'windowsfeature' source or 'webpi' source but that would be besides the point. If we had packages (physical, logical, or otherwise) that would allow us to specify all of the applications dependencies we wouldn't need to worry about how they were resolved as long as Chocolatey had the means to resolve it. As a bonus for creators of packages they wouldn't have to duplicate efforts or potentially introduce bugs in their installation or uninstallation process due to the oddities around what's available in which version (OS, architecture, language) of Windows they are being installed on.\n\nhttps://github.com/mwrock/Chocolatey-Packages/blob/master/fiddler/tools/chocolateyInstall.ps1\n\n```\n$tools = \"$(Split-Path -parent $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Definition)\"\n\nfunction Is64Bit {  [IntPtr]::Size -eq 8  }\n\nif(Is64Bit) {$fx=\"framework64\"} else {$fx=\"framework\"}\nif(!(test-path \"$env:windir\\Microsoft.Net\\$fx\\v2.0.50727\")) {\n  $packageArgs = \"/c DISM /Online /NoRestart /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:NetFx3\"\n  $statements = \"cmd.exe $packageArgs\"\n  Start-ChocolateyProcessAsAdmin \"$statements\" -minimized -nosleep -validExitCodes @(0,1)\n}\n\nInstall-ChocolateyPackage 'fiddler' 'exe' '/S' 'http://www.getfiddler.com/dl/Fiddler2Setup.exe'\n```\n. Would it be appropriate to create or generate packages that wrap what is available in the windowsfeatures and webpi sources? \n\nWhere there is an intersection we'd probably want to go with webpi since it would cover cases like NetFx3 not being present on WinXp and it needing to be downloaded as opposed to it being a windowsfeature in Win8.\n\nI think it could be automated relatively easily since the webpi feed is extremely well structured and covers OS/arch/lang variations. There would of course be gaps that windowsfeature would need to fill for Hyper-V, MSMQ and so on.\n\nI think there might be some merit to the generation of these packages since if nothing else it would help to simplify the install scripts and not require people to become familiar with what is available from the other sources. The install scripts would be simplified since there wouldn't be any additional dependencies to install in the script since the dependency would be fulfilled by Chocolatey. It would also be forward compatible if the nuspec parsing option was pursued. \n\nThanks for your responses I'm definitely becoming more familiar with the tooling and problems around dependency management thanks to this thread.\n. I have some free time this week and I've been meaning to dig into the WebPI APIs a bit so hopefully I'll be able to figure out some sane solution to generating some packages directly from the WebPI feed and which get installed using WebPI in their install script.\nhttp://blogs.iis.net/kateroh/archive/2010/02/11/webpi-apis-install-a-product-from-a-custom-feed.aspx\nhttp://blogs.iis.net/kateroh/archive/2010/02/27/webpi-api-load-balance-to-set-up-backend-servers-with-latest-microsoft-web-stack.aspx\nhttp://blogs.iis.net/kateroh/archive/2010/03/20/web-pi-apis-visualize-available-products-hierarchy-with-dgml.aspx\n.

    "TomOne": "Is there any progress at this issue? It can be very annoying, for example when you do `cup all` and Chocolatey stops the complete process, even if only one package is broken.\n. This is actually a very important issue to solve. Stopping the entire process only because one package failed is very annoying and reduces UX.\n. @Redsandro, I agree with you.\n\n@rismoney, it\u2019s OK if you want it to stop on error, but it should **not** be the default behaviour. I think Redsandro already explained the reasons clearly enough.\n\nAnother reason: packages are usually separate and independent objects (except dependencies). Why would you like to stop the entire process, only because a package failed to install, but has nothing to do with the other packages?\n\nFor comparison: A program on your computer has a small, but not serious bug that affects a certain functionality of that program. And only because of this bug you want that this program stops working completely and terminate with an error message? I think there\u2019s only a minority of users who would want such a behaviour. It\u2019s useful for debugging, but not for normal work. We can\u2019t always have an _everything or nothing philosophy_. :smile: \n\nAnd by the way, nobody prevents you from stopping the process manually if you encounter an error.\n. @Redsandro good arguments. :+1: \n\n@rismoney:\n\n> The systems i manage are critical and must not leave things in barney.\n\nNothing prevents you from investigating possible errors **after** the working packages have been installed/updated. This would also save time for you: If for example multiple packages you want to install/update are broken, with the current behaviour you will only notice the **first** error. Then you have to fix it, run `cup all` again, fix the next broken package, run `cup all` again, fix the next broken package and so on. This is not something I call comfortable. Therefore it reduces UX like I wrote before.\n. On this subject there has been a lot of progress.\nTake a look here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/chocolatey/ua_yqZFtZps\nWe have come to the conclusion that localisation for packages must be handled by the package maintainers and not by chocolatey itself, because for every package there is a different method to obtain localisation. So it isn\u2019t even possible to implement it in chocolatey.\n. I think it\u2019s not a good design to keep the older versions of packages, because it has several drawbacks:\n- It wastes disk space, especially when there are big files inside the package folder in `C:\\Chocolatey\\lib`.\n- The cuninst command would only uninstall the latest installed version of a package and leaving behind the other versions. That is not how an uninstall command is intended for other package managers.\n- Causes issues with applications that store data inside the `C:\\Chocolatey\\lib\\somepackage.version` folder. If a package gets updated, these data rests in the older version folder. Of course this data can be manually moved to the new version folder or moved with some lines in the ps1-file, but this makes things only more complicated than they should be.\n- Leaving multiple versions of a package on the machine would make sense only in one case: If the newer version is not backwards compatible with the older version. The package managers for Linux solve this with different packages for the older and newer version, for example one for Python 2.x and one for Python 3.x, the same for Ruby 1.9.x and Ruby 2.x. I think that\u2019s a far better solution.\n- If an user keeps two versions of one package on his machine, let\u2019s say Ruby 1.9.3 and Ruby 2.0, the older version doesn\u2019t get updated automatically, because it only updates to the newest version starting from 2.0. If for example a bugfix for Ruby 1.9.3 gets released, with the current chocolatey package design the user doesn\u2019t get an update for it unless he does it manually. That\u2019s bad. With the design of the Linux package managers this issue does not appear.\n- The paths to files inside a chocolatey package folder (`C:\\Chocolatey\\lib\\somepackage.someversion\\tools\\\u2026`) is complicated. Even if the executables from a package get covered by the PATH variable it can be sometimes necessary to manually input a path into the commandline or open it in a file manager. Then the user has to remember which version of the package he wants. Also when using scripts it is not good when the package folder always changes. Better would be the path `C:\\Chocolatey\\lib\\somepackage` for the related files, without the version.\n- Of course there can be a small number of folks which absolutely wants to keep multiple versions of a package at the same time, even if they are backwards compatible. But remember, Chocolatey is a package manager, not a backup solution. If one absolutely wants to keep several versions, he should consider making manual backups of the affected packages. But for most people keeping all the versions of packages is totally unnecessary and has all the disadvantages I specified before. Package managers for Linux handle it like this. I never heard that somebody complained about that. :)\n\nLet\u2019s get to the advantages of dropping the current design of keeping multiple package versions. Some of them can be derived from the previous text:\n- Uses less disk space.\n- The cuninst command would work like expected and how it already works in other package managers.\n- No loss of user data when a package gets updated.\n- Would make `binroot` obsolete, because the paths to package folders won\u2019t differ on an update.\n- Less complexity and therefore better conformity with the [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle).\n\nNow I hope I could convince you that this design is better. :)\n. > What I expected: flashplayer derivatives should've been removed, Atom should've copied old user data and then also be removed.\n\nI have another less complicated idea. Why not simply leave off the package version from the package folder name? That would make things a lot easier to handle. Then no user data copying would be needed. I already explained some other benefits that this approach in my previous comment: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/259#issuecomment-23863107\n\nChocolatey has a really weird design in this area that I\u2019ve never seen at any other package manager. Do you really think that it is so common that one wants to keep all package versions ever installed? In most cases that isn\u2019t even possible. For example, most of the software that comes with an installer will overwrite the previous version by default. Therefore having a `flashplayerplugin.13.0` and a `flashplayerplugin14.0` folder is not only confusing, but also semantically incorrect, because in that case only Flash Player 14.0 would be installed on the system.\n\nI want to ask you how often one would really need to have multiple versions of the same package installed at the same time. The only case where that would be 100 % possible would be portable packages. But even then it would not be easy to implement a good way to handle this. I\u2019ve worked with Linux for several years now, where package managers are an essential part of the system and I never had the need to install multiple versions of the same package at the same time. I also never heard of one that would need that and nobody who complained about the fact that upgrading a package overwrites the previous version.\n\n@ferventcoder, please consider a better design for the rewrite of Chocolatey as I already described in https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/259#issuecomment-23863107\n. Yes, that\u2019s the most straightforward solution, isn\u2019t it?\n. What are the other reasons to stop using nuget.exe?\nIt should be possible to modify the source code of nuget.exe to get nice and clean UTF-8 files. Unfortunately I\u2019m not able to do that, because I\u2019m not familiar with C#.\nBut also the gallery on nuget.org would benefit from such an improvement. They have the same issue with UTF-8 and ANSI.\n. That could be a workaround, but I read on multiple coding guidelines that HTML entities should be avoided, except for non distinguishable characters, e. g. `&nbsp;` or `&#x202F;`. HTML entities make the code harder to read and to maintain.\n\nBut it seems that newer versions of NuGet use UTF-8 without BOM for the nuspec when a package gets built. I tested it a few weeks ago. A good improvement, even if I would like if they used UTF-8 starting from their first releases. I think other character encodings are obsolete in most cases since the existence of Unicode.\n. I have bad news for you: NuGet doesn\u2019t even have a full support for HTML/XML entities. If you use an unsupported entity, the `cpack` command will fail and output an error: _\u2026 not declared entity \u2026 Line x, Position y_\n\nHere are some examples of commonly used entities:\n\nSupported by NuGet:\n- > `&gt;`\n- < `&lt;`\n- & `&amp;`\n- Probably all decimal and hexadecimal entities, e. g. `&#190;` or `&#x00AE;`\n\nNot supported by NuGet (outputs the error described above):\n- Most named entities, e. g. `&copy; &reg; &micro; &trade;` and many more.\n\nWell, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very comfortable to use the decimal or hexadecimal notation.\n. I\u2019m very sorry. I made a few mistakes here, mostly because of my inadequate knowledge about character encodings. Therefore I\u2019ve done some research to improve it. ;)\nSo here\u2019s the correction:\n- ANSI doesn\u2019t refer to a character encoding, it stands for _American National Standards Institute_. Microsoft and the Windows community uses ANSI as incorrect term for the Windows-1252 character encoding, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252 as reference. Even popular text editors like Notepad++ use ANSI incorrectly.\n- The `cpack` command **does** output nuspec files in UTF-8. To be more precise, it\u2019s UTF-8 without a BOM. As you probably know, a character encoding can\u2019t be determined easily unless there\u2019s a BOM. Text editors have to determine the encoding with some character detection stuff. They basically look if a character written in the text \u201clooks weird\u201d with a certain encoding, then they switch to the appropriate encoding. Of course this method is not 100 % reliable. If a text for example only contains ASCII characters, a text editor cannot determine the encoding, because UTF-8 has exactly the same character encoding table as ASCII, plus the Unicode table of course.\n  NuGet assumes that nuspec files are encoded in UTF-8 without a BOM. Therefore, if a package maintainer uses another character encoding like Windows-1252, some characters (like the famous \u00a9 or \u03bc) will be displayed incorrectly on chocolatey.org.\n\nBut fortunately there\u2019s a simple solution for that. We must make sure that package maintainers **never** use another encoding than UTF-8 without BOM. They should configure their editors to handle that encoding properly. Note that UTF-8 without BOM is the recommended character encoding for HTML pages and fortunately many websites use it, including nuget.org and chocolatey.org. So if web developers are able to set the character encoding properly, why not also chocolatey package maintainers?\n\nThe thing with HTML/XML entities is definitely more complicated than setting the correct encoding, so I would leave the entities out.\n\n@ferventcoder, this character encoding stuff would be another rule that should be added to the Wiki. I would be happy to do that.\n. You\u2019re using Geany. That\u2019s cool. :+1: \n\nNote that \u201cUTF-8\u201d in Geany means \u201cUTF-8 without BOM\u201d which is fine, while for example Notepad++ displays \u201cUTF-8\u201d when the file contains a BOM. In Notepad++, UTF-8 without BOM is incorrectly called \u201cANSI as UTF-8\u201d. That\u2019s a weird terminology.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t surprise me that there is so much confusion about character encodings, mostly thanks to Microsoft. :-1: \nBut at least some Linux- and cross-platform editors like Geany chose the right terminology. :)\n. Microsoft itself accepted that ANSI is an inappropriate term, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_code_page#ANSI_code_page. So that term shouldn\u2019t be used anymore.\n\nAnd by the way, there are already bug reports for Notepad++ to correct these incorrect terms:\n- http://sourceforge.net/p/notepad-plus/bugs/4095/\n- http://sourceforge.net/p/notepad-plus/bugs/3263/\n\nIf would really like if the Notepad++ devs fix these annoying incorrect and misleading terms, so please post your comments into these bug reports if you can, so we can give these bugs finally the attention they deserve.\n. I wrote this paragraph regarding the character encoding. As soon as you approve it, I\u2019ll add it to the [Creating Packages](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages) section in the Wiki, right after [Rules to be observed before publishing packages](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages#rules-to-be-observed-before-publishing-packages):\n\n## Character encoding\n- Use the UTF-8 character encoding for the *.nuspec and *.ps1 files. If you don\u2019t respect this rule, some characters are not displayed correctly in the Gallery on chocolatey.org, because the Gallery assumes UTF-8.\n- Don\u2019t save your nuspec files with a byte order mark (BOM). A BOM is neither required nor recommended for UTF-8, because it can lead to several issues.\n- Unfortunately, PowerShell scripts need to be saved in UTF-8 with BOM, otherwise PowerShell doesn\u2019t recognize the script as UTF-8 and as a result, it processes non ASCII characters incorrectly. So you have to break the previous rule here, but always keep in mind that a BOM for UTF-8 is not recommended by the Unicode standard.\n- Don\u2019t use the default Windows Editor. In addition to its lack of features, it can\u2019t even save UTF-8 files without BOM.\n- Note that there\u2019s a lot of confusion in the world of character encodings: For example, _ANSI_ is an incorrect term for the internal Windows character encodings, e.&nbsp;g. _Windows-1252_. But you should not use this encoding family anyway. In addition, Notepad++ incorrectly uses the term _ANSI as UTF-8_ for UTF-8 encoded files without a BOM. If you select UTF-8 in Notepad++, it means UTF-8 with BOM. Therefore Notepad++ must show _ANSI as UTF-8_ in the statusbar.\n- You have to specify the UTF-8 encoding in the first line of your nuspec files. Then the first line looks like this: `<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>`.\n. Amen :)\n. The anchor is generated automatically as @ferventcoder already mentioned: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages#character-encoding\n\nDamn, I just found out that PowerShell doesn\u2019t even recognize UTF-8 files without BOM. It uses Microsoft\u2019s ancient Windows-1252 encoding by default. So we have to save PowerShell scripts in UTF-8 with BOM to work correctly. Sorry Microsoft, but we live in 2013. Nobody wants your stupid non-standardized encodings! :-1:\n. @Redsandro, you are right, improve that section for people who have dyslexia. :)\n. UTF-8 and the byte order mark are two different things. A BOM is a special character at the beginning of a file which signals the endianness (byte order of a text file). Because the endianness has absolutely no meaning in UTF-8, it is not recommended to use a BOM there, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark.\n\nBut there are some programs out there which don\u2019t follow this standard, e. g. PowerShell and the Windows Editor. As you can see, Microsoft is retarded when it comes to this topic. It reminds me a bit of the story with IE, which web developers like so much. Haha. ;)\n. Wrong, not the \u201cno BOM\u201d causes issues, Microsoft causes them by ignoring standards!\n\nA gist is not necessary to show you PowerShell\u2019s behavior. PowerShell simply assumes that all PowerShell scripts are in that crappy Windows-1252 encoding unless there\u2019s a BOM. Then it simply reads the character addresses from the file and shows them if they were Windows-1252. Example:\n\ntest.ps1, encoded in UTF-8 without BOM:\n\n``` PowerShell\nWrite-Host \"\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 \u00a9 \u2122 \u03a9\u03a3\"\n```\n\nOutput in Powershell\n\n``` PowerShell\nIn C:\\Users\\Someuser\\test.ps1:1 Character:31\n+ Write-Host \"\u00ce\u00b1\u00ce\u00b2\u00ce\u00b3 \u00c2\u00a9 \u00e2\u201e\u00a2 \u00ce\u00a9\u00ce\u00a3\"\n+                               ~\nThe string has no terminator: \".\n    + CategoryInfo          : ParserError: (:) [], ParseException\n    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : TerminatorExpectedAtEndOfString\n```\n\nI think the [character encoding section](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages#character-encoding) in the Wiki is fine. It clearly explains what a person should do and clarifies the confusion that Microsoft has created. If someone doesn\u2019t understand this, he\u2019s probably retarded and shouldn\u2019t create packages. ;)\n. And by the way, all modern Linux distributions use UTF-8 without BOM by default. The [W3C doesn\u2019t recommend BOMs for the web](http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-byte-order-mark.en.php).\n\nBOMs for UTF-8 really cause issues: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark#UTF-8\nSome issues that I\u2019ve experienced myself when using UTF-8 with a BOM:\n- .gitignore files don\u2019t work properly. The expression in the first line fails because the BOM character stands in the way.\n- A colleague created a small node.js script which merges multiple CSV files. The output file contained multiple BOM characters, even in the middle of a line. Then my colleague imported that file into a database using phpMyAdmin. Then he experienced database inconsistencies. It took him over an hour until he found out that the BOMs were causing that issue.\n\nWell, Microsoft seems to insist on BOMs when using UTF-8. But only because Chocolatey is a Windows software, it doesn\u2019t mean that it has to adapt Microsoft\u2019s inability to follow standards and recommendations, especially when it comes to such fundamental things like character encoding.\n\nI read that from multiple sources that Microsoft is not very open to any suggestions. For example, they keep ignoring bug reports and feature requests for Internet Explorer and automatically delete them after about 48 hours. What kind of weird strategy is this? Are they planning their downfall of their company? Well, at least for IE it seems to work, when I look on the progression of the market share of Internet Explorer. :grinning:\n. > I mostly ignore things I can't change and change the things I can change.\n\nSounds pretty clear to me: We make chocolatey better by leaving the character encoding section as it is and let IE die. :grinning:\n\nSorry if I mention it, but your wisdom phrase has an inconsistency: How can you be sure that you can\u2019t change something? If you take a closer look at history, you will notice great people who have seemingly done the impossible. But today we know that it wasn\u2019t impossible. Thanks to this kind of people we now have democracy, women's suffrage and no more slavery. At least in the countries where we live.\n\nedit:\nsorry, I meant something, not anything ;)\n. Of course :) Simply UTF-8 without BOM for *.nuspec files and UTF-8 with BOM for PowerShell scripts.\n. Screenshot of Notepad++ 6.5:\n![npp-ansi-as-utf-8](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4357973/1417903/64643564-3fa1-11e3-9a7f-9989da841804.png)\nNotepad++ is inconsistent, that\u2019s even worse.\nIt\u2019s also mentioned in these two bug reports:\n- http://sourceforge.net/p/notepad-plus/bugs/4095/\n- http://sourceforge.net/p/notepad-plus/bugs/3263/\n. @Redsandro, I think you misunderstood something here. When you open a file with no special characters, the encoding cannot be determined by the text editor. Then it depends on the settings of the editor which encoding is assumed. In Notepad++, you can override this setting if you tick \u201cApply to opened ANSI files\u201d like in the screenshot above, which will assume UTF-8 for every file that has no special characters and no BOM. That\u2019s the standard for every Linux editor I know, and it\u2019s a good standard. :+1: \n. Sorry, I meant \u201cwhich will assume UTF-8 for every file that has no non-ASCII characters and no BOM.\u201d\n. I updated the title of this issue, because the old one was misleading and wrong.\n\nNow I think we have every information needed to fix the character encoding problem. If you have no further doubts or questions, this issue can be closed.\n. Good suggestions, except this one:\n\n> Either:\n> Do not use non-ASCII characters.\n\nThis is not a solution of the character encoding problem, only an amateurish circumvention for lazy people. I\u2019m very annoyed of all these redcutions to typographically incorrect ASCII characters, like _e'_ instead of _\u00e8_, _ue_ instead of _\u00fc_, _ss_ instead of _\u00df_ or _(c)_ instead of _\u00a9_.\n\nI expect from an advanced computer user, programmer or package maintainer to know the important things about character encodings, or at least to be open to learn it. People that don\u2019t like to read and follow rules, guidelines and standards, **should never ever** create and publish packages. Such people are harmful for the community and make the world to a worse place.\n\nDon\u2019t we all want packages with a good quality? Isn\u2019t it worth to spend a few more minutes or a bit more to read, understand and follow the rules and guidelines of a project?\n. Doesn\u2019t that mean the same as \u201cdo not use\u201d, just with other words? I definitely don\u2019t like this recommendation. It\u2019s like sweeping the dirt under the carpet. :-1: Seriously, what is so hard about reading a few lines and changing the character encoding settings of the editor if necessary?\n\nI\u2019ll make a pull request so that the templates comply with these recommendations.\n. OK, but I still don\u2019t agree with putting\n\n> Either:\n> - Do not use non-ASCII characters.\n\ninto the wiki. I thought the idea is to write less (but sensible) guidelines, not more. I\u2019ll try to explain why that \u201cnon-ASCII characters\u201d guidelines does not make sense, using a little story (inspired by https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/ChocolateyStory)\n\nThere are two guys, Bob and Richard. Both are Windows users and discovered Chocolatey a few moths ago. Now they also want to maintain some packages of their favourite software. \n\nRichard doesn\u2019t care much about guidelines and rules, he starts immediately with creating packages and doesn\u2019t read the Chocolatey wiki. He uses the Windows Editor to edit his nuspec files and saves them with the default character encoding (Micromisleadingsoft\u00ae ANSI\u2122). But in some of his packages there are characters like \u00a9, \u00ae and en dashes. They get displayed with `?` signs in the Chocolatey Gallery, but he doesn\u2019t even notice it. After a few weeks he coincidentally notices this problem, but he does not care.\n\nUnlike Richard, Bob is assiduous. He reads the [Create Packages](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages) page and learns that nuspec files must be saved as UTF-8 without BOM. He didn\u2019t know much about character encodings before, but he configures his Notepad++ editor to save files as UTF-8 without BOM by default. Now he won\u2019t have any problems with character encodings in nuspec files and enjoys creating packages.\n\nUnfortunately there are many Richard-like package maintainers on Chocolatey.org. For them, a suggestion in the wiki like \u201cDo not use non-ASCII characters.\u201d wouldn\u2019t have any effect. And for people like Bob, such a suggestion would be totally superfluous, because the solution to set the correct character encoding in the editor **once** is certainly less complicated than having to remember each time when editing a nuspec to not use non-ASCII characters.\n\nDon\u2019t be a Richard. :smile: \n. @Redsandro: I changed the [character encoding section](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages#character-encoding) as you suggested, but left your recommendation about ASCII out. I hope that my story about Bob and Richard could convince you. :smile: \n\n@gep13, a package that configures text editors with **proper** character encodings would be interesting. I\u2019ve made some research about text editors on Windows and character encodings. We could use it to determine which editor would need a \u201cfix\u201d:\n- Notepad++ uses UTF-8 without BOM as default encoding since a few releases. But if you upgrade from older versions, it continues using Windows-1252 (incorrectly called ANSI) as default encoding.\n- Notepad2 uses that stupid \u201cANSI\u201d by default. :-1: \n- PSPad too\n- Sublime Text 2 and 3 use UTF-8 without BOM as default encoding.\n- Geany: UTF-8 without BOM by default. :+1:\n- Gedit for Windows too. \n- [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) too.\n- Vim/Gvim isn\u2019t even able to to show most Unicode characters. But I think that\u2019s a Windows related issue. In addition, GVim/Vim on Windows doesn\u2019t use UTF-8 as default character encoding. But Vim on Linux shows all Unicode characters provided by font and uses UTF-8 without BOM by default.\n\nAs you can see, most cross-platform editors (except Vim) use UTF-8 without BOM by default. Unfortunately this means that most of the Windows-only community adopted Microsoft\u2019s retarded standards policy. It\u2019s always annoying when a stubborn company insists on obsolete standards and mostly **ignores** user feedback and bug reports. If someone claims Microsoft is innovative, I will point the finger at him and laugh at him. Innovation can never coexist together with such an ultraconservative and ignorant behaviour.\n\nI\u2019m sorry that I criticize Microsoft with these words. But of course my main interest here is to improve Chocolatey. :)\n. You\u2019ve probably never looked at Debian\u2019s guidelines for package maintainers: http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/\n\nThe fact is: being a package maintainer requires great responsibility. Therefore one **must** spend some time to read rules and guidelines of the community. If one does not like to do so, he should never ever join a community.\n\n> Meet Hank. Always in a hurry. Dyslexic. Hates reading. Hates editors. Hates Windows. Doesn't care about other people's mess, but cares about end user quality.\n\nThat\u2019s a paradoxical behaviour. A guy who cares about end user quality, but has all the negative character properties you described? Very unlikely if you ask me. I\u2019m glad that I\u2019ve never met such a person. :smile: \n. By the way, if Debian\u2019s documentation would scare away potential package maintainers, then why is it so popular? Why are there so many Debian package maintainers?\n\nDon\u2019t tell me that almost all Windows users are like Richard or Hank. If that would be true, I would immediately remove Windows from all computers I have access to and throw my Windows license out the window. :smile:\n. OK, then another try: Take a look at Arch Linux\u2019 guidelines: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Creating_Packages\nDon\u2019t tell me that there are too few packages for Arch Linux. :smile: \n\nYes, unlike the Linux package world, there are many Richard-like Chocolatey package maintainers. The reasons for that are quite obvious:\n- Until now, Chocolatey does not have a documentation that covers all important topics. That\u2019s understandable, because it\u2019s a relatively young project.\n- There is no moderation or inspection of new packages by experienced maintainers. Imagine you live in a world without police. It\u2019s obvious that such a world laws wouldn\u2019t be followed by most people, which would end in a total chaos.\n\nAnd remember, we\u2019re talking about guidelines for package maintainers here, not for average Windows users. I still don\u2019t understand why you insist on recommending to use obsolete character encodings, just to support the laziness. It\u2019s so easy to change that setting in the editor. I don\u2019t think that Chocolatey package maintainers are idiots.\n\nMaintainers also need to know about PowerShell if they want to create packages that do more than just invoking the `Install-ChocolateyPackage` helper function. Isn\u2019t that a lot more work than changing the character encoding setting in the editor to UTF-8?\n. Hm, then why did the NuGet developers decide to use UTF-8? Aren\u2019t some of them Microsoft employees? :smile:\n\n> You are seriously comparing this to total chaos?\n\nYou\u2019re misinterpreting this. I didn\u2019t talk just about the character encoding problem, it\u2019s just a scenario if no one would respect rules.\n\nAnother example: Internet Explorer is the default browser in Windows. Why do most people make the effort and install an alternative browser? Internet Explorer will just work fine for them, if they can live without proper HTML5/CSS3 support. :laughing:\n\nIf you like simplicity, then go forth and use Internet Explorer. We must accept Microsoft\u2019s laws, otherwise we will hurt us. :smile: \n\nI\u2019m sorry for that irony, but your arguments arguments make little sense to me.\n. > Stay away from IE! :smile:\n\nYes. Friends don\u2019t let friends use Internet Explorer. But IE isn\u2019t the only Microsoft stuff I don\u2019t like. I\u2019m quite happy that their server software with their locked in ecosystem (Windows Server, ASP/ASP.NET, IIS) is losing market share to Linux/OSS solutions. :smile: Let\u2019s build a better an Internet that belongs to everyone, using openness and innovation. :+1: \n\nYou\u2019re right, let\u2019s stop that discussion here. So here\u2019s a short summary of the results:\n- Recommendation for maintainers who read the wiki: UTF-8.\n- If maintainers don\u2019t use UTF-8, no problem as long as they don\u2019t use non-ASCII characters.\n- Incorrectly displayed characters on Chocolatey.org are not a _serious_ problem as long as the affected packages are functional.\n. Of course.\n. :smile: \n\nI have an idea how we can solve this problem once and for all, even for Richards, Hanks and for people who have not a single clue about character encodings. As you know, there\u2019s much work on the computer that can be automated. Why not automate a character encoding conversion to the correct encodings before a package gets built? That conversion could be for example executed as first step of the `cpack` command.\n\nNow to the technical part: I already mentioned that character encoding detection is not a simple task. I requires a lot more than just a few lines of code. This document describes the approaches: http://www-archive.mozilla.org/projects/intl/UniversalCharsetDetection.html\n\nFor Python, there exists a nice tool to detect the character encoding: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/chardet/2.1.1\n\nI also discovered a PowerShell script that do the same: http://danspowershellstuff.blogspot.it/2012/02/get-file-encoding-even-if-no-byte-order.html.\n\nIf we were on Linux, these things would be a lot easier: using `file -i` to detect the character encoding and `iconv` to convert it.\n. > I don't think that will work. Once you save your file in standard (according to Windows) encoding, the character becomes unreadable when you reopen the file. But when I change encoding to utf-8, the char remains unreadable. I have to enter it again.\n\nI don\u2019t understand what you mean by that. Why would the characters become unreadable? Of course the character encoding conversion works. I tested it myself using Cygwin with the `file -i` and `iconv` method.\n. The `nuspec` files are never converted to ASCII, so that\u2019s not the problem here. The problem we need to solve is that some package maintainers save them in Windows-1252 instead of UTF-8.\n. > It sounds like cpack would be too late in the process to be helpful.\n\nWhy too late? When you for example execute the `cpack` command, the character encodings (Windows-1252, UCS-2 or other weird encodings) could be converted into UTF-8 first and then the cpack command could do the same like it already does now.\n. @Redsandro, you wrote this:\n\n> Once certain characters are \u25a1, like \u25a1Torrent \u25a12013 bitTorrent\u25a1, you can't get them back from a conversion.\n> \n> I just tried. If you save it directly and load it directly, there is no problem. But if you save your package to a git repository, load it on a different machine and then push it, it's already too late.\n\nI tried to reproduce this with Git, but the characters are all fine. This is the workflow I used:\n1. Save `uTorrent.nuspec` with Windows-1252 encoding, including an \u03bc character.\n2. Commit & push\n3. Git clone to another directory on the computer\n4. Convert the nuspec to UTF-8 without BOM\n5. Commit & push\n6. Git clone to another folder on the computer\n7. Open nuspec, the editor correctly recognises the file as UTF-8 and the \u03bc character gets displayed correctly\n\nSo here absolutely nothing gets lost. I used https://github.com/tomone/suggestions as my testing repository.\n\nBut if you try do download an already built package like [\u03bcTorrent](http://chocolatey.org/api/v2/package/uTorrent/3.3.2), unpack it and open the nuspec, your editor will probably show `\ufffdTorrent`. Also setting the encoding to Windows-1252 does not help. Building a package probably causes non-UTF-8 encodings to be destroyed. I don\u2019t know what there happens in the background, because I have only basic knowledge about character encodings.\n\nSo the only workflow where the character encoding would be destroyed is the following:\n1. Create a package, using some non-ASCII characters like \u00a9, \u00ae, \u03bc or \u2013.\n2. Save nuspec as Windows-1252\n3. Build package\n4. On every package update, take a previously built package (the nupkg), extract it, insert the new version and download links and then build it again.\n\nWell, this is a weird workflow, but of course we also must take this into account. What about to let the cpack command scan the nuspec file for weird characters caused by a broken encoding and stop in that case? A meaningful error message could be displayed and then the package maintainer **must** investigate that character encoding problem.\n\n-- edit --\ncorrected step 4 of the second workflow\n. I\u2019ve investigated this problem and now I know a possible solution and what there happens in the background:\n- [Windows-1252](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252) is an 8-bit character encoding, while ASCII is has 7-bit.\n- In UTF-8, characters encoded with a single byte between (hex) 80 and FF are invalid, but in Windows-1252 these addresses represent characters like \u00b5, \u00c4, \u00ae and \u00a9.\n- NuGet assumes UTF-8 and therefore replaces the invalid single-byte-characters between 80 and FF with the Unicode replacement character \ufffd (`&#xfffd;`), which is an [option to handle this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utf-8#Invalid_byte_sequences).\n- Therefore this replacement character shows up in the gallery for example in the [\u03bcTorrent package](http://chocolatey.org/packages/uTorrent/3.3.1)\n- However, RFC 3629 states that implementations of the decoding algorithm **must** protect against decoding invalid sequences. The Unicode standard requires that decoders treat any invalid character sequence as an error condition.\n- If NuGet would follow RFC 3629 and throw an error when a maintainer attempts to package a Windows-1252 encoded nuspec with 80 to FF characters, we wouldn\u2019t have any problem.\n- Therefore, the best way to fix this issue is to implement such an error message on invalid UTF-8 characters directly in NuGet. Has anybody tested newer NuGet versions to see if this has been implemented already? If not, I would open an issue for this on CodePlex.\n- In the case the NuGet developers ignore this issue, I would really like if it gets implemented into Chocolatey\u2019s `cpack`, together with a character encoding detection and conversion to UTF-8.\n\n-- edit --\nSorry, it\u2019s (hex) 80 and not 7F.\n. Sorry, I forgot the solution for nuspecs whose Windows-1252 80 to FF characters have already been destroyed and replaced with \ufffd: `cpack` could detect if the \ufffd character is present in the nuspec, abort in that case and throw an error message. This message should mention that UTF-8 should be used and that \ufffd characters must be replaced with the correct characters, otherwise it won\u2019t proceed.\n\nLet\u2019s improve Chocolatey\u2019s package quality and ban those annoying \ufffd characters. :+1: \n\nI :heart: Unicode.\n. > Although I always thought `cpack` was just a reference plus some alternate configuration to the `nuget pack` binary.\n\nYes, it\u2019s a Windows Batch file in `C:\\Chocolatey\\bin\\cpack.bat`.\n\nBut if we really want to fix this character encoding problem, we need to add a control structure for it to the `cpack` command, since that is the only contact point between the package source files and Chocolatey before the package gets pushed. That\u2019s the only possibility, because there will always be people who don\u2019t read and respect rules and guidelines. And even if there would be some kind of moderation for Chocolatey packages, it\u2019s always better when something gets automated when it\u2019s possible, so it would be less work for the moderators.\n\nA good program doesn\u2019t let the user make mistakes if they can be detected, but also doesn\u2019t treat users like idiots. :smiley: I think this is one of the key rules of good usability.\n. I wrote a [small Bash-script](https://github.com/TomOne/suggestions/blob/master/convertscript.sh) which automatically converts all `*.nuspec` files from other encodings to UTF-8. This could be very useful for package maintainers that have many packages and want to make sure that **every** character in their nuspecs gets displayed correctly in the Gallery.\n\nIn addition, the script removes BOMs and replaces any XML declaration with `<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>`, so that package maintainers can see more easily that the file is encoded as UTF-8.\n\nThis script requires a Bash interpreter (on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows with Cygwin) and the program \u201crecode\u201d to perform the character encoding conversion. Recode is not installed by default in Cygwin and in most Linux distributions, but it\u2019s quite easy to install it.\n. Of course not every Windows user has Cygwin installed. I wrote this script in Bash because I like cross-platform solutions. Personally I don\u2019t like programming/scripting languages which work only on one platform, especially when that platform is a non-free proprietary operating system.\n\nNobody is forced to use this script and nothing prevents anybody from writing a similar script in PowerShell. :smiley: \n. Woah, there\u2019s a PowerShell implementation for Linux: http://pash.sourceforge.net/ :smile: \n. > I thought you were working towards a solution for all packagers from which there is no escape, preferably without them even knowing.\n\nYes, that would be a better solution. First I looked how such a script could be written in PowerShell, but I discovered that it\u2019s a lot more complicated (because you have to write the non-trivial character encoding recognition from scratch) and my PowerShell skills aren\u2019t good enough.\n. I have a new idea. Let me make a summary of a possible approach that would fix this issue:\nThe `cpack` command should perform the following checks before calling NuGet\u2019s `pack` command:\n- Check if the affected `*.nuspec` file is not encoded as UTF-8.\n- Check if an UTF-8 BOM is present.\n- Check if one or more Unicode replacement characters (\ufffd) are present in the `*.nuspec` file.\n\nIf one of the checks above is true, cpack should throw an exception and inform the package maintainer that something is wrong, i.e. that it\u2019s needed to convert the file to UTF-8. Then the maintainer could fix it and execute cpack again.\n\nI think this approach is much better than additional automatic charset conversion because of the following reasons:\n- It has a better learning effect for maintainers. If an automatic conversion would be performed, some maintainers would continue to use legacy character encodings (such as Windows-1252), without ever knowing that UTF-8 would be the correct encoding.\n- Package maintainers would learn that an UTF-8 BOM is a bad thing.\n- To replace \ufffd with the correct characters, it would be necessary anyway to manually edit the `*.nuspec` file.\n- As I already mentioned, a character encoding recognition is never 100 % accurate in all cases. In some rare cases, an automatic character encoding conversion to UTF-8 could result in an output file with wrong characters.\n\nPlease let me know if you have doubts and if you would be interested in this solution.\n. @Redsandro, thanks for the hint. Unfortunately _UTFCast Express_ only supports the _ASCII, UTF-8, UTF-16 Little Endian, UTF-16 Big Endian_ encodings. It does not support 8-bit-encodings (e.g _Windows-1252_) which mostly cause our encoding issues at Chocolatey.\n\nI couldn\u2019t find any free program which performs a batch convert of text files and supports all relevant encodings. To develop one would be a nice FOSS project though, especially useful for Windows users/developers :smiley: \n\nSome time ago I created a small node.js script which performs this task for a folder with Chocolatey/NuGet package source files: https://github.com/TomOne/cpkg-utf8-conv\n\nIt is still very naive, but it works. Of course it is not suitable to automagically prevent the encoding issues we have, but it\u2019s nice tool to clean existing package repositories. At least I like it more than my previous Bash script for this task. :smile: \n. BTW, some time ago I came across [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/). It\u2019s a plugin for many popular editors which automatically sets specific parameters for specific files in a repository. For example, you can write into the config file that all *.nuspec files should be saved as UTF-8 and all *.ps1 files as UTF-8 with BOM.\n\nI already use it for my packages repository: https://github.com/TomOne/chocolatey-packages/blob/master/.editorconfig\n\n@ferventcoder, it would be nice to integrate this also into the https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolateytemplates repository. So we can recommend to package maintainers to install the EditorConfig plugin and at least those folks won\u2019t create packages with inappropriate character encodings.\n. > But I'm not sure what good it would do since that is not a chocolatey packages template repository that they start from (if that makes sense).\n\nThat\u2019s right, it does not help much. But we could add to the [character encoding section in the wiki](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages#character-encoding) that package maintainers should \u2013 if they use EditorConfig \u2013 copy the `.editorconfig` file into the root directory of the repo. Unfortunately I noticed that only the plugin for Sublime Text seems to support the `charset` property of EditorConfig, so only Sublime Text users could actually benefit from that. But note that Sublime Text is one of the most popular code editors nowadays, so it wouldn\u2019t be completely useless.\n\nBTW, the following section is a bit offtopic, but I think it could be interesting for us:\n\nIn my previous comments I mentioned that Notepad++ (the editor with the most downloads on Chocolatey.org) uses an incorrect term to denote \u201cUTF-8 without BOM\u201d, which I also wrote into the [character encoding section in the wiki](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages#character-encoding). I created a [patch on the SourceForge Project site for Notepad++](https://sourceforge.net/p/notepad-plus/patches/571/) to correct that term. Let\u2019s hope that the Notpad++ devs eventually respond to that issue, so that we could reduce a little bit the confusion about character encodings that seems to persist in the Microsoft/Windows community.\n. Because PowerShell uses deprecated character encodings (known as Windows codepages and often incorrectly called \u201cANSI\u201d) by default and a BOM is the only way to force UTF-8.\n\nSee https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages#character-encoding for more information.\n. Good suggestion. This would also be more compliant to package managers for Linux. They also have a specific folder where they download their packages. It\u2019s called \u201cpackage cache\u201d. In apt-get for example, this cache can be cleared with `apt-get clean`. It would be great if we had such a command in chocolatey.\n. Perfect. :)\n. @ferventcoder, better also correct the Ketarin command in your blog: http://ferventcoder.com/archive/2013/01/03/chocolatey-automatic-packages.aspx\nThen this issue can be closed I think. :)\n. All right, I added it to the Wiki: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages#naming-your-package\n\nIt would be good to make known these guidelines. A tweet or/and a blog post would be perfect for that.\n\nAnother Question: What we do with the existing packages that do not follow these guidelines? To leave them so could confuse new package creators. A perfect solution for this issue are aliases: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org/issues/25\n. I browsed through the [Ubuntu package list](http://packages.ubuntu.com/) and discovered that not all packages follow the guideline with the hyphens. This rule was clearly too strict, because if for example the name of an application contains many short words separated by spaces, the many hyphens would disturb.\n\nSo I changed [this in the Wiki](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages#naming-your-package) to also allow no spaces for the package id when the original app name contains spaces.\n\nDo you think it\u2019s a good idea to add a link to the Ubuntu package list or even from other distributions to the _Naming your package_ section in the wiki? When for example someone makes a choco package and that package already exists as DEB/RPM package, it wouldn\u2019t be bad to pick the same package id. In that way Linux and Chocolatey users don\u2019t have to remember different package names.\n. But standards are not bad if they are sensible. ;) I know no other package format (except NuGet of course) which uses CamelCase for id.\n. Sorry, my mistake. ;)\n. Nice. :+1: I updated the wiki. Please check if I did everything correctly: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/ChocolateyFAQs#when-i-install-a-portable-app-like-imagemagicktool-how-is-it-on-my-path-without-littering-my-path\n. Thanks. Does that mean that I can add it to the Wiki?\n\nHmmm, I find it strange that every GitHub user can edit every Wiki without any moderation or inspection by the project members. This is in need of improvement.\n. @ferventcoder: OK, but what about my question?\n. I added it to the wiki: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages#package-icon-guidelines\n. Good, can you add this to the Wiki? Does it make sense to provide separate Ketarin templates for https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolateytemplates/tree/master/_templates/chocolateyauto and https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolateytemplates/tree/master/_templates/chocolateyauto3?\n. The term \u201cupdate\u201d is commonly used for bug fixes or minor software enhancements, while \u201cupgrade\u201d refers to more extensive feature enhancements. An \u201cupgrade\u201d generally leads to an increased major version number.\n\nTherefore these two terms are even not perfectly suitable like they are intended for apt-get.\n\nAbout two weeks ago I switched from Ubuntu to Arch Linux, a highly customizable Linux distribution with a rolling release policy and fast package updates (unlike Ubuntu or Debian, which is ultra-conservative in this area).\n\nArch Linux has its own package manager called _pacman_. Pacman uses a completely different syntax than apt-get, for example:\n\n``` Bash\npacman -S somepackage  # Installs or updates the specified package. The \u201cS\u201d stands for \u201csynchronizing\u201c with the repository. That\u2019s a very nice terminology if you ask me and more suitable than update/upgrade.\npacman -Sy  # update local database (package index), similar to \u2018apt-get update\u2019\npacman -Syu  # complete update of all packages, equivalent to \u2018apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade\u2019\n```\n\nAs you can see, the pacman commands are shorter than their apt-get equivalents. If we ever need to change command syntax of chocolatey, my vote is for a pacman-like syntax. :)\n. If you ask me, a local package database (same as package index) should have a high priority for every package management system. It\u2019s a pity that the NuGet devs didn\u2019t already implement it.\n\nMicrosoft isn\u2019t known for good software in this area. I\u2019m not sure if _Windows Update_ can be seen as package management, but it\u2019s a fact that it\u2019s extremely slow, inefficient and badly designed. For example, it doesn\u2019t install all required updates at once, but it installs some updates, then it needs to reboot, then the next updates, reboot again and so on. That\u2019s ridiculous. ;) If for example an update is superseded by another update, it installs first the old update and then the update which superseded the previous update. Score one for inefficiency. :-1: It looks that Windows Update also has no package (update) index.\n. Done.\n. @ferventcoder: I\u2019ve seen you use Google Analytics on chocolatey.org. It would be very interesting to know how many visitors use IE8 or lower. Then we have facts.\n. Thanks for providing these statistics. IE8 usage is low, as I had expected. But even in 8 months when Windows XP support ends it won\u2019t be zero. :-1: \n\nHowever, I found a very simple solution for a fallback to PNG if a browser doesn\u2019t support SVG using the JavaScript plugin [SVGeezy](http://benhowdle.im/svgeezy/). Then this simple JavaScript code will replace all SVGs with their PNG equivalents:\n\n``` JavaScript\nsvgeezy.init(false, 'png');\n```\n\nThis assumes of course that in the same directory in addition to the SVG file there must exist the equivalent PNG file (e. g. http://example.com/icon.svg and http://example.com/icon.png). But that\u2019s not a problem at all, we just need to mention that in the icon guidelines in the wiki.\n\nI would be very pleased to make a pull request for chocolatey.org to integrate this fallback. @ferventcoder, is that OK for you?\n. Tiny. Only 1.158 KB for the minified version, see the code: https://github.com/benhowdle89/svgeezy/blob/master/svgeezy.min.js\n. Great. I have good news for you. We don\u2019t even need SVGeezy. This plugin was designed for folks who don\u2019t already have Mondernizr and jQuery integrated in their pages, but chocolatey.org has them integrated. So Modernizr can be used for feature detection and jQuery for DOM manupulation and the code becomes even simpler, without the need of SVGeezy:\n\n``` JavaScript\nif (!Modernizr.svg) {\n    $('img[src$=\".svg\"]').each(function()\n    {\n        $(this).attr('src', $(this).attr('src').replace('.svg', '.png'));\n    });\n}\n```\n\nI found this code on [David Bushell\u2019s blog](http://dbushell.com/2013/02/04/a-primer-to-front-end-svg-hacking/), a guy who seems to be very interested into SVG. :+1: \n\nIn addition I played around with SVGZ. That is the gzipped format of SVG. SVG is highly compressible, because it contains a lot of redundant data (like HTML). I was very curious about the filesizes of SVG, SVGZ and PNG in comparison. Therefore I generated some files:\n\nFile size in bytes, filename\n\n1141, [git.svg](http://walterbz.com/git.svg)\n782, [git-opt.svg](http://walterbz.com/git-opt.svg)\n437, [git-opt.svgz](http://walterbz.com/git-opt.svgz)\n1699, [git-opt-128px.png](http://walterbz.com/git-opt-128px.png)\n868, [git-opt-48px.png](http://walterbz.com/git-opt-48px.png)\n\n56431, [mixxx.svg](http://walterbz.com/mixxx.svg)\n16839, [mixxx-opt.svg](http://walterbz.com/mixxx-opt.svg)\n2357, [mixxx-opt.svgz](http://walterbz.com/mixxx-opt.svgz)\n5278, [mixxx-opt-128px.png](http://walterbz.com/mixxx-opt-128px.png)\n1674, [mixxx-opt-48px.png](http://walterbz.com/mixxx-opt-48px.png)\n\n28718, [pyhoca-gui.svg](http://walterbz.com/pyhoca-gui.svg)\n12009, [pyhoca-gui-opt.svg](http://walterbz.com/pyhoca-gui-opt.svg)\n3190, [pyhoca-gui-opt.svgz](http://walterbz.com/pyhoca-gui-opt.svgz)\n16306, [pyhoca-gui-opt-128px.png](http://walterbz.com/pyhoca-gui-opt-128px.png)\n4067, [pyhoca-gui-opt-48px.png](http://walterbz.com/pyhoca-gui-opt-48px.png)\n\nDescription of these files with the example of git:\n- git.svg = original SVG file\n- git-opt-svg = optimized SVG file with [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo), a Node.js tool\n- git-opt.svgz = gzip compressed optimized SVG file\n- git-opt-128px.png = equivalent raster image with 128px, optimized with `optipng -o7`\n- git-opt-48px.png = equivalent raster image with 48px, optimized with `optipng -o7`\n\nAs you can see, SVGZ is clearly smaller than the raster version with 128px, and in some cases even smaller than the 48px version. SVGZ is a very interesting format, perfectly suitable to use it as package icons on chocolatey.org.\n\nHowever, SVGZ cannot be directly integrated in websites without an additional step. The web server must be configured to tell the browser \u201chey this is gzipped, you\u2019ll need to decompress this\u201d.\nThis can be done in Apache by adding this to the .htaccess file:\n\n```\n# SVG\nAddType image/svg+xml .svg .svgz\nAddEncoding x-gzip .svgz\n```\n\nI don\u2019t know how to configure IIS to handle SVGZ properly, but you certainly know it. It would be great if you could test it.\n. Yes, http://semver.org/ is nice, but it only refers to the versioning of an application itself, not the distiction between upstream and package version. Therefore it does not help here.\n\nI like the epoch part in [Debian package versioning](http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Version). It\u2019s a very good idea, because it allows a trouble-free continuation of the version, even when the version policy changes or when there was a mistake in versioning.\n\nThe versioning of Linux packages is a lot better than the one of NuGet. I regret that they have not taken a good example of them. It is not an easy task to change something fundamental like this later.\n. I just don\u2019t see any sensible reason why a package management system should force to mix together the version of the packaged software with package revisions without proper separator characters. In fact I don\u2019t know any other package manager than NuGet/Chocolatey which forces maintainers to do this.\n\nIf for example a Chocolatey package has the version `1.10.3.20140327` I would naturally understand from it that it is also the version of the packaged software. Of course folks can learn that if the fourth segment is an ISO 8601 date, it is a package fix notation, but it is not obvious. Better would be `1.10.3-20140327`, with a hyphen as separator (like used by Debian and Arch Linux), so that people understand that the part after a hyphen belongs to the package version fix notation.\n\nThe current restrictive versioning policy of NuGet/Chocolatey has also other issues:\n- What if the software itself already uses four dot-separated segments for its version and you need to fix the package?\n  If you have for example a software version `2.5.8.1`, you are forced to alter the last segment, so the original software version information gets destroyed: `2.5.8.20140327`. Then, for all the following packages of version `2.5.8.x`, you are forced to use the current date as last segment, even if the affected package does not actually fix a previous package revision. You would have to wait until the packaged software gets released with version `2.5.9.x` to be able to drop the date in the last segment and use the real software version again. So here an essential information is removed just because of a senseless restriction.\n- What if you have a package with version `2.5.8.20140327` and you need to fix it again on the same day? Do you use the date of the following day? That\u2019s not semantically correct. :smile:\n- What if you have released a package and made a mistake in the package version, e.g. `2.5.6` instead of `2.4.6`? NuGet / Chocolatey provides no solution for this, except unlisting a package. But what if already hundreds of people downloaded the package? If you unlist it and the software version `2.4.7` comes out, all users who have the package with the wrong `2.5.6` simply won\u2019t get an update. With something similar like Debian\u2019s epoch notation there wouldn\u2019t be this issue.\n\nAllowing only semver for package versions is not a good idea. Package managers must be more flexible to avoid these versioning issues.\n. @ferventcoder: Yes, but apart from distorting the original version information, the approach of modifying the already existent fourth segment doesn\u2019t solve the problem of an accidentally misspelled first, second or third segment. I described that problem already in my previous comment (in the third list item). It happened to the Dropbox package: http://chocolatey.org/packages/dropbox/9.20. Fortunately there were only 8 downloads of the misspelled version.\n\n> It's not perfect and yes we should look at enhancing stuff like that. Where do you see this in terms of priority?\n\nOf course Chocolatey also works with the current versioning scheme, but to become a robust and well established package management system, this is definitely an important issue to consider. I don\u2019t want to blame the NuGet developers, but If I would build a package management system, I would never apply such a restricted and inflexible versioning policy. SemVer is nice for applications, but not appropriate for package versioning.\n. @abombss, thanks for explaining your point of view.\n\nMy idea is just to look at how other popular package managers for operating systems are built and to learn from them. For example, consider the `openssl` package of other package managers:\n- Debian: https://packages.debian.org/sid/openssl\n- Ubuntu: http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/openssl\n- Arch Linux: https://www.archlinux.org/packages/core/x86_64/openssl/\n- Gentoo: http://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo-x86/dev-libs/openssl/ChangeLog?view=markup\n- opkg: http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/packages/openssl-util_1.0.1g-1_ar71xx.ipk\n- MacPorts: https://www.macports.org/ports.php?by=name&substr=openssl\n- Fink: http://pdb.finkproject.org/pdb/package.php/openssl\n- Fedora: http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/openssl.git/tree/\n\nAs you can see, every single package manager in this list allows the original version notation of openssl (currently `1.0.1g`) in the package version. In this way, an user immediately sees what version of openssl the package contains. I don\u2019t think that this approach is bad as almost all package managers adopted it. The only \u201cdisadvantage\u201d of this approach is that the versioning logic is a bit more complex. But in my opinion in this area a good user experience should have a higher priority than avoiding a little more program complexity. The creators and programmers of these other package managers seem to agree with me.\n\nOr do you think it is better to be forced to version the openssl package with something like `1.0.1.20140411` like [OpenSSL.Light](http://chocolatey.org/packages/OpenSSL.Light) from Chocolatey? I don\u2019t think so.\n\nA separate \u201ccontent version\u201d could be another approach, but that would also bring more complexity into Chocolatey and could also confuse users, because then there would be two version strings and the user must distinguish between them.\n\nI don\u2019t see any sensible reason why Chocolatey should not adopt proven patterns of other popular package managers. I remember to have read \u201cChocolatey NuGet - kind of like apt-get \u2026\u201d in the [Chocolatey wiki](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki). From this I understand that Chocolatey intends to learn from apt-get, otherwise it wouldn\u2019t make sense to write this. :smiley: \n. Yes, I agree with you. But remember that many of these name prefixed and duplicate packages were created **before** I suggested the package rules and added them to the wiki after Rob had approved them. Sending the package rules with the confirmation e-mail would be a good idea, but in this way we won\u2019t reach already registered maintainers.\n\nA major problem is that also if new maintainers read the wiki once, they probably don\u2019t check the wiki every week/month for updates. The only solution to let them know about important wiki and guideline updates would be a kind of newsletter that is sent to **every** single maintainer. These e-mails should then contain a link to the updated wiki sections and an invitation to read them.\n\nBut I see that we are moving a bit offtopic here. If you would like to discuss this aspect further, please open a new thread in the forum.\n\nThis issue is about an improved package triage process. There will always be package maintainers that **ignore** contributions and pull requests from others. The reasons for that are varied:\n- Not even time for a couple of seconds for a short reply to the person who contacted the maintainer\n- The desire to destroy or to harm the Chocolatey community\n- Disinterest, laziness or stubbornness\n  All these behaviours are unacceptable, so the main purpose of this improved triage process is to reduce the amount of time, effort and the vexation when people make pull requests to package maintainers.\n. Awesome :+1: \n. @Redsandro, actually only `.portable` and `.install` are official suffixes. They are essential to understand what the package contains. I suggested them a few months ago and they were accepted. The other suffixes are deprecated, but obviously older packages still use them. And there are still folks which ignore the rules and guidelines in the wiki and use the deprecated suffixes. This problem will never be solved until chocolatey packages get inspected by moderators before they get published.\n. Good, so the suggested modifications to the package rules are approved. Can someone apply them to the Wiki? Or can I do it? It\u2019s better to do it sooner than later. :smile: \n. > Shall we use that by default and let OS and FS handle all instead of a separate EXE and just fall back to shimgen if no link functionality is available?\n\nDo you mean symbolic links? The support for symbolic links on Windows is very naive. If you make for example a symbolic link to an EXE and that EXE requires an external library, the symbolic link won\u2019t resolve the relative path to it. This makes symbolic links on Windows unusable and useless in many cases, because many programs require external libraries. Unix-like systems don\u2019t have this limitation. I think this is also the reason because shims are preferred here.\n. Unfortunately not. Shimgen is closed-source proprietary software. Here\u2019s the license text: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/tools/shimgen.license.txt\n. > I also wanted to post up a new feature to allow you to remove OLD VERSIONS of software.\n\nLike it. But if you ask me, it should be the default behavior of Chocolatey to **remove** the old version when a package gets updated. Every other package manager on Linux (apt-get, yum, opkg, pacman) does that.\n\nPlease forgive me if I am a bit direct here, but I think the current design of Chocolatey to keep older package versions is neither useful nor appropriate. Why don\u2019t follow the design of well established package managers that have already millions of (mostly satisfied) users?\n\nMaybe some people think here that it\u2019s sometimes needed to keep for example older versions of the same Ruby package (for example 1.9 if their app is not compatible with 2.0). But it is the wrong approach, because doing so the idea of a package manager would be undermined. If you have for example two versions of exactly same package installed (let\u2019s say Ruby versions 1.9 and 2.0), the Ruby 1.9.x branch would never be automatically updated, because 2.0 is already newer. If the 1.9.x branch would get an important security update, you would miss it with the current design of Chocolatey, because version 2.0 is newer than 1.9.x.\n\nIt is far better to keep **different** packages for each maintained branch, e.g. `ruby1.9` and `ruby2.0`. The same applies to candidates like `php5.3`, `php5.4`, and `php5.5`. Note that also this approach is already used in the Linux package manager world. The benefits of this: an user can choose which branch he would like to install and then that version **automatically** gets its updates.\n\nOr can you tell me what is the actual benefit to have these packages installed simultaneously?\n- CCleaner 4.08.4428\n- CCleaner 4.07.4369\n- CCleaner 4.06.4324\n- CCleaner 4.05.4250\n- CCleaner 4.04.4197\n- CCleaner 4.03.4151\n- CCleaner 4.02.4115.20130609\n- CCleaner 4.02.4115.20130601\n- CCleaner 4.02.4115\n- CCleaner 4.01.40933\n- Java Runtime (JRE) 7.0.45\n- Java Runtime (JRE) 7.0.40.20131007\n- Java Runtime (JRE) 7.0.40\n- Java Runtime (JRE) 7.0.25\n- Java Runtime (JRE) 7.0.21\n- Java Runtime (JRE) 7.0.17\n- Java Runtime (JRE) 7.0.15\n- Java Runtime (JRE) 7.0.11\n- Java Runtime (JRE) 7.0.9\n- Java Runtime (JRE) 7.0.5.1\n- Java Runtime (JRE) 7.0.5\n- Java Runtime (JRE) 6.0.31.1\n- Jave Runtime (JRE) 6.0.30\n\nPlease also read my other statements why the design to keep older versions is bad idea: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/259#issuecomment-23863107\n. > are you sure Linux apt-get REMOVES old versions?\n\nYes, 100&nbsp;% sure. :smile: \n\n> I thought it only does that when you run 'apt-get autoremove\n\nNo, `apt-get autoremove` does something completely different: autoremove is used to remove packages that were automatically installed to satisfy dependencies for some package and that are no more needed.\n\n> I think it's useful to have old versions locally so you can revert back to them and not rely on the remote source being online.\n\nExactly that is not possible with Chocolatey at the moment, because it downloads files **every** time when you install a package, even if exactly the same files were already downloaded previously. So it\u2019s not a \u201csmart\u201d download cache like apt-get has.\n. I would prefer a cache management like apt-get has. To download again already downloaded files like Chocolatey does is a bit inefficient, don\u2019t you think so?\n. @ferventcoder yes, good idea. I\u2019m going to do that.\n. This is not the right place to report issues with Chocolatey packages, it\u2019s only for Chocolatey itself. If you have a problem with a package or a question about it, use the [contact maintainers link](https://chocolatey.org/packages/javaruntime/ContactOwners), or better, report the issue in the GitHub repo where the package source files are hosted.\n\nI opened an issue in the corresponding repository: https://github.com/TomOne/chocolatey-packages/issues/3. Refer to it and close this one.\n. Are you sure? Then why it does work on 0.9.8.23? Also the `thunderbird` package is affected by the same error.\n\nPerhaps also other packages are broken after the update to 0.9.8.24. But I\u2019ll try to debug the `firefox` package first.\n. Yes, it works. But what should I do in the meantime with the `firefox` and `thunderbird` packages until 0.9.8.25 becomes final? Firefox is one of the most popular packages on Chocolatey.org, so there are lots of users affected by this error. Should I use `wget` in the meantime to download the HTML file, or do you have a better idea?\n. Good\n. @ferventcoder wrote:\n\n> If the package is doing something more than it should be and/or not using the helpers, I fully expect those packages to break. And they should b/c they need to stay out of chocolatey's purview. Anything that reaches into chocolatey's internals and uses functions, whatever, that are not in the API will start to break hard once choco.exe comes out.\n\nSorry, but I don\u2019t agree with you here. First of all, the `firefox` package uses Chocolatey helpers whenever possible. And if I understood it right, it is the `Get-ChocolateyWebFile` helper which causes this package to break, so it is not the fault of the `firefox` package.\n\nAre you seriously saying that every package code outside Chocolatey\u2019s API (e.g regular PowerShell code) will start to break once Chocolatey gets rewritten in C#? Sorry, but that is an extremely unwise idea in my opinion. A package manager \u2013 especially on Windows \u2013 needs to support an entire scripting language in order to cover the various tasks needed to install software and get it to work. I hope that you won\u2019t drop regular PowerShell code support, otherwise Chocolatey will be a lot less useful.\n. @Redsandro: Good one :+1:\n\nFYI: Error 1603 is nasty. This error code is not only thrown when there is \u201ca problem with the system configuration\u201d, but also when an user attempts to install an MSI package that is already installed on the computer in the same version (of course when installed via the silent parameters). This happened quite often with Chocolatey packages, especially with the javaruntime package. Many users complained about the 1603 error until I figured out what the actual cause was.\n\nM$ has a strange conception as errors. Personally I wouldn\u2019t classify a re-installation of the same software version as error, would you? That and only confuses users. A re-installation of the same software version does not harm anything an is not a undesirable \u201cerror\u201d state.\n. :+1: for this. I also would find it much nicer if the original exe icon would be used.\n\nThat is also the reason why there exist different icons for different programs, isn\u2019t it? :smiley: \n. > I'm curious... why the \"shim\" versus mklink?\n\nBecause MS failed to correctly implement symlinks. To create symlinks on Windows requires administrator rights and attempting to run them from GUI (Explorer) fails with an error. In addition, they don\u2019t resolve paths correctly (e.g. paths to DLLs are not resolved correctly).\n. > For me, the advantage of the shim's is running the application's from the command line, so icons don't really matter for me. Personal preference I guess.\n\nI see shimgen as workaround for a broken symlink support in Windows. On Windows and on other operating systems, symlinks always inherit the icon of their target. IMHO that makes sense, doesn\u2019t it?\n. > I see. How does one create their own shims? We might have a use.\n\nShimGen is non-free proprietary software: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/master/src/tools/shimgen.license.txt\n\nI guess the Chocolatey devs won\u2019t tell how it exactly works, otherwise they would have open-sourced it. :smiley:\n. ~~Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but could this have to do something with the recent force lowercasing the package IDs?~~\n\nSorry, wrong. I didn\u2019t read the issue carefully enough.\n. Is there any progress at this issue? It can be very annoying, for example when you do `cup all` and Chocolatey stops the complete process, even if only one package is broken.\n. This is actually a very important issue to solve. Stopping the entire process only because one package failed is very annoying and reduces UX.\n. @Redsandro, I agree with you.\n\n@rismoney, it\u2019s OK if you want it to stop on error, but it should **not** be the default behaviour. I think Redsandro already explained the reasons clearly enough.\n\nAnother reason: packages are usually separate and independent objects (except dependencies). Why would you like to stop the entire process, only because a package failed to install, but has nothing to do with the other packages?\n\nFor comparison: A program on your computer has a small, but not serious bug that affects a certain functionality of that program. And only because of this bug you want that this program stops working completely and terminate with an error message? I think there\u2019s only a minority of users who would want such a behaviour. It\u2019s useful for debugging, but not for normal work. We can\u2019t always have an _everything or nothing philosophy_. :smile: \n\nAnd by the way, nobody prevents you from stopping the process manually if you encounter an error.\n. @Redsandro good arguments. :+1: \n\n@rismoney:\n\n> The systems i manage are critical and must not leave things in barney.\n\nNothing prevents you from investigating possible errors **after** the working packages have been installed/updated. This would also save time for you: If for example multiple packages you want to install/update are broken, with the current behaviour you will only notice the **first** error. Then you have to fix it, run `cup all` again, fix the next broken package, run `cup all` again, fix the next broken package and so on. This is not something I call comfortable. Therefore it reduces UX like I wrote before.\n. On this subject there has been a lot of progress.\nTake a look here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/chocolatey/ua_yqZFtZps\nWe have come to the conclusion that localisation for packages must be handled by the package maintainers and not by chocolatey itself, because for every package there is a different method to obtain localisation. So it isn\u2019t even possible to implement it in chocolatey.\n. I think it\u2019s not a good design to keep the older versions of packages, because it has several drawbacks:\n- It wastes disk space, especially when there are big files inside the package folder in `C:\\Chocolatey\\lib`.\n- The cuninst command would only uninstall the latest installed version of a package and leaving behind the other versions. That is not how an uninstall command is intended for other package managers.\n- Causes issues with applications that store data inside the `C:\\Chocolatey\\lib\\somepackage.version` folder. If a package gets updated, these data rests in the older version folder. Of course this data can be manually moved to the new version folder or moved with some lines in the ps1-file, but this makes things only more complicated than they should be.\n- Leaving multiple versions of a package on the machine would make sense only in one case: If the newer version is not backwards compatible with the older version. The package managers for Linux solve this with different packages for the older and newer version, for example one for Python 2.x and one for Python 3.x, the same for Ruby 1.9.x and Ruby 2.x. I think that\u2019s a far better solution.\n- If an user keeps two versions of one package on his machine, let\u2019s say Ruby 1.9.3 and Ruby 2.0, the older version doesn\u2019t get updated automatically, because it only updates to the newest version starting from 2.0. If for example a bugfix for Ruby 1.9.3 gets released, with the current chocolatey package design the user doesn\u2019t get an update for it unless he does it manually. That\u2019s bad. With the design of the Linux package managers this issue does not appear.\n- The paths to files inside a chocolatey package folder (`C:\\Chocolatey\\lib\\somepackage.someversion\\tools\\\u2026`) is complicated. Even if the executables from a package get covered by the PATH variable it can be sometimes necessary to manually input a path into the commandline or open it in a file manager. Then the user has to remember which version of the package he wants. Also when using scripts it is not good when the package folder always changes. Better would be the path `C:\\Chocolatey\\lib\\somepackage` for the related files, without the version.\n- Of course there can be a small number of folks which absolutely wants to keep multiple versions of a package at the same time, even if they are backwards compatible. But remember, Chocolatey is a package manager, not a backup solution. If one absolutely wants to keep several versions, he should consider making manual backups of the affected packages. But for most people keeping all the versions of packages is totally unnecessary and has all the disadvantages I specified before. Package managers for Linux handle it like this. I never heard that somebody complained about that. :)\n\nLet\u2019s get to the advantages of dropping the current design of keeping multiple package versions. Some of them can be derived from the previous text:\n- Uses less disk space.\n- The cuninst command would work like expected and how it already works in other package managers.\n- No loss of user data when a package gets updated.\n- Would make `binroot` obsolete, because the paths to package folders won\u2019t differ on an update.\n- Less complexity and therefore better conformity with the [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle).\n\nNow I hope I could convince you that this design is better. :)\n. > What I expected: flashplayer derivatives should've been removed, Atom should've copied old user data and then also be removed.\n\nI have another less complicated idea. Why not simply leave off the package version from the package folder name? That would make things a lot easier to handle. Then no user data copying would be needed. I already explained some other benefits that this approach in my previous comment: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/259#issuecomment-23863107\n\nChocolatey has a really weird design in this area that I\u2019ve never seen at any other package manager. Do you really think that it is so common that one wants to keep all package versions ever installed? In most cases that isn\u2019t even possible. For example, most of the software that comes with an installer will overwrite the previous version by default. Therefore having a `flashplayerplugin.13.0` and a `flashplayerplugin14.0` folder is not only confusing, but also semantically incorrect, because in that case only Flash Player 14.0 would be installed on the system.\n\nI want to ask you how often one would really need to have multiple versions of the same package installed at the same time. The only case where that would be 100 % possible would be portable packages. But even then it would not be easy to implement a good way to handle this. I\u2019ve worked with Linux for several years now, where package managers are an essential part of the system and I never had the need to install multiple versions of the same package at the same time. I also never heard of one that would need that and nobody who complained about the fact that upgrading a package overwrites the previous version.\n\n@ferventcoder, please consider a better design for the rewrite of Chocolatey as I already described in https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/259#issuecomment-23863107\n. Yes, that\u2019s the most straightforward solution, isn\u2019t it?\n. What are the other reasons to stop using nuget.exe?\nIt should be possible to modify the source code of nuget.exe to get nice and clean UTF-8 files. Unfortunately I\u2019m not able to do that, because I\u2019m not familiar with C#.\nBut also the gallery on nuget.org would benefit from such an improvement. They have the same issue with UTF-8 and ANSI.\n. That could be a workaround, but I read on multiple coding guidelines that HTML entities should be avoided, except for non distinguishable characters, e. g. `&nbsp;` or `&#x202F;`. HTML entities make the code harder to read and to maintain.\n\nBut it seems that newer versions of NuGet use UTF-8 without BOM for the nuspec when a package gets built. I tested it a few weeks ago. A good improvement, even if I would like if they used UTF-8 starting from their first releases. I think other character encodings are obsolete in most cases since the existence of Unicode.\n. I have bad news for you: NuGet doesn\u2019t even have a full support for HTML/XML entities. If you use an unsupported entity, the `cpack` command will fail and output an error: _\u2026 not declared entity \u2026 Line x, Position y_\n\nHere are some examples of commonly used entities:\n\nSupported by NuGet:\n- > `&gt;`\n- < `&lt;`\n- & `&amp;`\n- Probably all decimal and hexadecimal entities, e. g. `&#190;` or `&#x00AE;`\n\nNot supported by NuGet (outputs the error described above):\n- Most named entities, e. g. `&copy; &reg; &micro; &trade;` and many more.\n\nWell, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very comfortable to use the decimal or hexadecimal notation.\n. I\u2019m very sorry. I made a few mistakes here, mostly because of my inadequate knowledge about character encodings. Therefore I\u2019ve done some research to improve it. ;)\nSo here\u2019s the correction:\n- ANSI doesn\u2019t refer to a character encoding, it stands for _American National Standards Institute_. Microsoft and the Windows community uses ANSI as incorrect term for the Windows-1252 character encoding, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252 as reference. Even popular text editors like Notepad++ use ANSI incorrectly.\n- The `cpack` command **does** output nuspec files in UTF-8. To be more precise, it\u2019s UTF-8 without a BOM. As you probably know, a character encoding can\u2019t be determined easily unless there\u2019s a BOM. Text editors have to determine the encoding with some character detection stuff. They basically look if a character written in the text \u201clooks weird\u201d with a certain encoding, then they switch to the appropriate encoding. Of course this method is not 100 % reliable. If a text for example only contains ASCII characters, a text editor cannot determine the encoding, because UTF-8 has exactly the same character encoding table as ASCII, plus the Unicode table of course.\n  NuGet assumes that nuspec files are encoded in UTF-8 without a BOM. Therefore, if a package maintainer uses another character encoding like Windows-1252, some characters (like the famous \u00a9 or \u03bc) will be displayed incorrectly on chocolatey.org.\n\nBut fortunately there\u2019s a simple solution for that. We must make sure that package maintainers **never** use another encoding than UTF-8 without BOM. They should configure their editors to handle that encoding properly. Note that UTF-8 without BOM is the recommended character encoding for HTML pages and fortunately many websites use it, including nuget.org and chocolatey.org. So if web developers are able to set the character encoding properly, why not also chocolatey package maintainers?\n\nThe thing with HTML/XML entities is definitely more complicated than setting the correct encoding, so I would leave the entities out.\n\n@ferventcoder, this character encoding stuff would be another rule that should be added to the Wiki. I would be happy to do that.\n. You\u2019re using Geany. That\u2019s cool. :+1: \n\nNote that \u201cUTF-8\u201d in Geany means \u201cUTF-8 without BOM\u201d which is fine, while for example Notepad++ displays \u201cUTF-8\u201d when the file contains a BOM. In Notepad++, UTF-8 without BOM is incorrectly called \u201cANSI as UTF-8\u201d. That\u2019s a weird terminology.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t surprise me that there is so much confusion about character encodings, mostly thanks to Microsoft. :-1: \nBut at least some Linux- and cross-platform editors like Geany chose the right terminology. :)\n. Microsoft itself accepted that ANSI is an inappropriate term, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_code_page#ANSI_code_page. So that term shouldn\u2019t be used anymore.\n\nAnd by the way, there are already bug reports for Notepad++ to correct these incorrect terms:\n- http://sourceforge.net/p/notepad-plus/bugs/4095/\n- http://sourceforge.net/p/notepad-plus/bugs/3263/\n\nIf would really like if the Notepad++ devs fix these annoying incorrect and misleading terms, so please post your comments into these bug reports if you can, so we can give these bugs finally the attention they deserve.\n. I wrote this paragraph regarding the character encoding. As soon as you approve it, I\u2019ll add it to the [Creating Packages](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages) section in the Wiki, right after [Rules to be observed before publishing packages](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages#rules-to-be-observed-before-publishing-packages):\n\n## Character encoding\n- Use the UTF-8 character encoding for the *.nuspec and *.ps1 files. If you don\u2019t respect this rule, some characters are not displayed correctly in the Gallery on chocolatey.org, because the Gallery assumes UTF-8.\n- Don\u2019t save your nuspec files with a byte order mark (BOM). A BOM is neither required nor recommended for UTF-8, because it can lead to several issues.\n- Unfortunately, PowerShell scripts need to be saved in UTF-8 with BOM, otherwise PowerShell doesn\u2019t recognize the script as UTF-8 and as a result, it processes non ASCII characters incorrectly. So you have to break the previous rule here, but always keep in mind that a BOM for UTF-8 is not recommended by the Unicode standard.\n- Don\u2019t use the default Windows Editor. In addition to its lack of features, it can\u2019t even save UTF-8 files without BOM.\n- Note that there\u2019s a lot of confusion in the world of character encodings: For example, _ANSI_ is an incorrect term for the internal Windows character encodings, e.&nbsp;g. _Windows-1252_. But you should not use this encoding family anyway. In addition, Notepad++ incorrectly uses the term _ANSI as UTF-8_ for UTF-8 encoded files without a BOM. If you select UTF-8 in Notepad++, it means UTF-8 with BOM. Therefore Notepad++ must show _ANSI as UTF-8_ in the statusbar.\n- You have to specify the UTF-8 encoding in the first line of your nuspec files. Then the first line looks like this: `<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>`.\n. Amen :)\n. The anchor is generated automatically as @ferventcoder already mentioned: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages#character-encoding\n\nDamn, I just found out that PowerShell doesn\u2019t even recognize UTF-8 files without BOM. It uses Microsoft\u2019s ancient Windows-1252 encoding by default. So we have to save PowerShell scripts in UTF-8 with BOM to work correctly. Sorry Microsoft, but we live in 2013. Nobody wants your stupid non-standardized encodings! :-1:\n. @Redsandro, you are right, improve that section for people who have dyslexia. :)\n. UTF-8 and the byte order mark are two different things. A BOM is a special character at the beginning of a file which signals the endianness (byte order of a text file). Because the endianness has absolutely no meaning in UTF-8, it is not recommended to use a BOM there, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark.\n\nBut there are some programs out there which don\u2019t follow this standard, e. g. PowerShell and the Windows Editor. As you can see, Microsoft is retarded when it comes to this topic. It reminds me a bit of the story with IE, which web developers like so much. Haha. ;)\n. Wrong, not the \u201cno BOM\u201d causes issues, Microsoft causes them by ignoring standards!\n\nA gist is not necessary to show you PowerShell\u2019s behavior. PowerShell simply assumes that all PowerShell scripts are in that crappy Windows-1252 encoding unless there\u2019s a BOM. Then it simply reads the character addresses from the file and shows them if they were Windows-1252. Example:\n\ntest.ps1, encoded in UTF-8 without BOM:\n\n``` PowerShell\nWrite-Host \"\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 \u00a9 \u2122 \u03a9\u03a3\"\n```\n\nOutput in Powershell\n\n``` PowerShell\nIn C:\\Users\\Someuser\\test.ps1:1 Character:31\n+ Write-Host \"\u00ce\u00b1\u00ce\u00b2\u00ce\u00b3 \u00c2\u00a9 \u00e2\u201e\u00a2 \u00ce\u00a9\u00ce\u00a3\"\n+                               ~\nThe string has no terminator: \".\n    + CategoryInfo          : ParserError: (:) [], ParseException\n    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : TerminatorExpectedAtEndOfString\n```\n\nI think the [character encoding section](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages#character-encoding) in the Wiki is fine. It clearly explains what a person should do and clarifies the confusion that Microsoft has created. If someone doesn\u2019t understand this, he\u2019s probably retarded and shouldn\u2019t create packages. ;)\n. And by the way, all modern Linux distributions use UTF-8 without BOM by default. The [W3C doesn\u2019t recommend BOMs for the web](http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-byte-order-mark.en.php).\n\nBOMs for UTF-8 really cause issues: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark#UTF-8\nSome issues that I\u2019ve experienced myself when using UTF-8 with a BOM:\n- .gitignore files don\u2019t work properly. The expression in the first line fails because the BOM character stands in the way.\n- A colleague created a small node.js script which merges multiple CSV files. The output file contained multiple BOM characters, even in the middle of a line. Then my colleague imported that file into a database using phpMyAdmin. Then he experienced database inconsistencies. It took him over an hour until he found out that the BOMs were causing that issue.\n\nWell, Microsoft seems to insist on BOMs when using UTF-8. But only because Chocolatey is a Windows software, it doesn\u2019t mean that it has to adapt Microsoft\u2019s inability to follow standards and recommendations, especially when it comes to such fundamental things like character encoding.\n\nI read that from multiple sources that Microsoft is not very open to any suggestions. For example, they keep ignoring bug reports and feature requests for Internet Explorer and automatically delete them after about 48 hours. What kind of weird strategy is this? Are they planning their downfall of their company? Well, at least for IE it seems to work, when I look on the progression of the market share of Internet Explorer. :grinning:\n. > I mostly ignore things I can't change and change the things I can change.\n\nSounds pretty clear to me: We make chocolatey better by leaving the character encoding section as it is and let IE die. :grinning:\n\nSorry if I mention it, but your wisdom phrase has an inconsistency: How can you be sure that you can\u2019t change something? If you take a closer look at history, you will notice great people who have seemingly done the impossible. But today we know that it wasn\u2019t impossible. Thanks to this kind of people we now have democracy, women's suffrage and no more slavery. At least in the countries where we live.\n\nedit:\nsorry, I meant something, not anything ;)\n. Of course :) Simply UTF-8 without BOM for *.nuspec files and UTF-8 with BOM for PowerShell scripts.\n. Screenshot of Notepad++ 6.5:\n![npp-ansi-as-utf-8](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4357973/1417903/64643564-3fa1-11e3-9a7f-9989da841804.png)\nNotepad++ is inconsistent, that\u2019s even worse.\nIt\u2019s also mentioned in these two bug reports:\n- http://sourceforge.net/p/notepad-plus/bugs/4095/\n- http://sourceforge.net/p/notepad-plus/bugs/3263/\n. @Redsandro, I think you misunderstood something here. When you open a file with no special characters, the encoding cannot be determined by the text editor. Then it depends on the settings of the editor which encoding is assumed. In Notepad++, you can override this setting if you tick \u201cApply to opened ANSI files\u201d like in the screenshot above, which will assume UTF-8 for every file that has no special characters and no BOM. That\u2019s the standard for every Linux editor I know, and it\u2019s a good standard. :+1: \n. Sorry, I meant \u201cwhich will assume UTF-8 for every file that has no non-ASCII characters and no BOM.\u201d\n. I updated the title of this issue, because the old one was misleading and wrong.\n\nNow I think we have every information needed to fix the character encoding problem. If you have no further doubts or questions, this issue can be closed.\n. Good suggestions, except this one:\n\n> Either:\n> Do not use non-ASCII characters.\n\nThis is not a solution of the character encoding problem, only an amateurish circumvention for lazy people. I\u2019m very annoyed of all these redcutions to typographically incorrect ASCII characters, like _e'_ instead of _\u00e8_, _ue_ instead of _\u00fc_, _ss_ instead of _\u00df_ or _(c)_ instead of _\u00a9_.\n\nI expect from an advanced computer user, programmer or package maintainer to know the important things about character encodings, or at least to be open to learn it. People that don\u2019t like to read and follow rules, guidelines and standards, **should never ever** create and publish packages. Such people are harmful for the community and make the world to a worse place.\n\nDon\u2019t we all want packages with a good quality? Isn\u2019t it worth to spend a few more minutes or a bit more to read, understand and follow the rules and guidelines of a project?\n. Doesn\u2019t that mean the same as \u201cdo not use\u201d, just with other words? I definitely don\u2019t like this recommendation. It\u2019s like sweeping the dirt under the carpet. :-1: Seriously, what is so hard about reading a few lines and changing the character encoding settings of the editor if necessary?\n\nI\u2019ll make a pull request so that the templates comply with these recommendations.\n. OK, but I still don\u2019t agree with putting\n\n> Either:\n> - Do not use non-ASCII characters.\n\ninto the wiki. I thought the idea is to write less (but sensible) guidelines, not more. I\u2019ll try to explain why that \u201cnon-ASCII characters\u201d guidelines does not make sense, using a little story (inspired by https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/ChocolateyStory)\n\nThere are two guys, Bob and Richard. Both are Windows users and discovered Chocolatey a few moths ago. Now they also want to maintain some packages of their favourite software. \n\nRichard doesn\u2019t care much about guidelines and rules, he starts immediately with creating packages and doesn\u2019t read the Chocolatey wiki. He uses the Windows Editor to edit his nuspec files and saves them with the default character encoding (Micromisleadingsoft\u00ae ANSI\u2122). But in some of his packages there are characters like \u00a9, \u00ae and en dashes. They get displayed with `?` signs in the Chocolatey Gallery, but he doesn\u2019t even notice it. After a few weeks he coincidentally notices this problem, but he does not care.\n\nUnlike Richard, Bob is assiduous. He reads the [Create Packages](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages) page and learns that nuspec files must be saved as UTF-8 without BOM. He didn\u2019t know much about character encodings before, but he configures his Notepad++ editor to save files as UTF-8 without BOM by default. Now he won\u2019t have any problems with character encodings in nuspec files and enjoys creating packages.\n\nUnfortunately there are many Richard-like package maintainers on Chocolatey.org. For them, a suggestion in the wiki like \u201cDo not use non-ASCII characters.\u201d wouldn\u2019t have any effect. And for people like Bob, such a suggestion would be totally superfluous, because the solution to set the correct character encoding in the editor **once** is certainly less complicated than having to remember each time when editing a nuspec to not use non-ASCII characters.\n\nDon\u2019t be a Richard. :smile: \n. @Redsandro: I changed the [character encoding section](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages#character-encoding) as you suggested, but left your recommendation about ASCII out. I hope that my story about Bob and Richard could convince you. :smile: \n\n@gep13, a package that configures text editors with **proper** character encodings would be interesting. I\u2019ve made some research about text editors on Windows and character encodings. We could use it to determine which editor would need a \u201cfix\u201d:\n- Notepad++ uses UTF-8 without BOM as default encoding since a few releases. But if you upgrade from older versions, it continues using Windows-1252 (incorrectly called ANSI) as default encoding.\n- Notepad2 uses that stupid \u201cANSI\u201d by default. :-1: \n- PSPad too\n- Sublime Text 2 and 3 use UTF-8 without BOM as default encoding.\n- Geany: UTF-8 without BOM by default. :+1:\n- Gedit for Windows too. \n- [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) too.\n- Vim/Gvim isn\u2019t even able to to show most Unicode characters. But I think that\u2019s a Windows related issue. In addition, GVim/Vim on Windows doesn\u2019t use UTF-8 as default character encoding. But Vim on Linux shows all Unicode characters provided by font and uses UTF-8 without BOM by default.\n\nAs you can see, most cross-platform editors (except Vim) use UTF-8 without BOM by default. Unfortunately this means that most of the Windows-only community adopted Microsoft\u2019s retarded standards policy. It\u2019s always annoying when a stubborn company insists on obsolete standards and mostly **ignores** user feedback and bug reports. If someone claims Microsoft is innovative, I will point the finger at him and laugh at him. Innovation can never coexist together with such an ultraconservative and ignorant behaviour.\n\nI\u2019m sorry that I criticize Microsoft with these words. But of course my main interest here is to improve Chocolatey. :)\n. You\u2019ve probably never looked at Debian\u2019s guidelines for package maintainers: http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/\n\nThe fact is: being a package maintainer requires great responsibility. Therefore one **must** spend some time to read rules and guidelines of the community. If one does not like to do so, he should never ever join a community.\n\n> Meet Hank. Always in a hurry. Dyslexic. Hates reading. Hates editors. Hates Windows. Doesn't care about other people's mess, but cares about end user quality.\n\nThat\u2019s a paradoxical behaviour. A guy who cares about end user quality, but has all the negative character properties you described? Very unlikely if you ask me. I\u2019m glad that I\u2019ve never met such a person. :smile: \n. By the way, if Debian\u2019s documentation would scare away potential package maintainers, then why is it so popular? Why are there so many Debian package maintainers?\n\nDon\u2019t tell me that almost all Windows users are like Richard or Hank. If that would be true, I would immediately remove Windows from all computers I have access to and throw my Windows license out the window. :smile:\n. OK, then another try: Take a look at Arch Linux\u2019 guidelines: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Creating_Packages\nDon\u2019t tell me that there are too few packages for Arch Linux. :smile: \n\nYes, unlike the Linux package world, there are many Richard-like Chocolatey package maintainers. The reasons for that are quite obvious:\n- Until now, Chocolatey does not have a documentation that covers all important topics. That\u2019s understandable, because it\u2019s a relatively young project.\n- There is no moderation or inspection of new packages by experienced maintainers. Imagine you live in a world without police. It\u2019s obvious that such a world laws wouldn\u2019t be followed by most people, which would end in a total chaos.\n\nAnd remember, we\u2019re talking about guidelines for package maintainers here, not for average Windows users. I still don\u2019t understand why you insist on recommending to use obsolete character encodings, just to support the laziness. It\u2019s so easy to change that setting in the editor. I don\u2019t think that Chocolatey package maintainers are idiots.\n\nMaintainers also need to know about PowerShell if they want to create packages that do more than just invoking the `Install-ChocolateyPackage` helper function. Isn\u2019t that a lot more work than changing the character encoding setting in the editor to UTF-8?\n. Hm, then why did the NuGet developers decide to use UTF-8? Aren\u2019t some of them Microsoft employees? :smile:\n\n> You are seriously comparing this to total chaos?\n\nYou\u2019re misinterpreting this. I didn\u2019t talk just about the character encoding problem, it\u2019s just a scenario if no one would respect rules.\n\nAnother example: Internet Explorer is the default browser in Windows. Why do most people make the effort and install an alternative browser? Internet Explorer will just work fine for them, if they can live without proper HTML5/CSS3 support. :laughing:\n\nIf you like simplicity, then go forth and use Internet Explorer. We must accept Microsoft\u2019s laws, otherwise we will hurt us. :smile: \n\nI\u2019m sorry for that irony, but your arguments arguments make little sense to me.\n. > Stay away from IE! :smile:\n\nYes. Friends don\u2019t let friends use Internet Explorer. But IE isn\u2019t the only Microsoft stuff I don\u2019t like. I\u2019m quite happy that their server software with their locked in ecosystem (Windows Server, ASP/ASP.NET, IIS) is losing market share to Linux/OSS solutions. :smile: Let\u2019s build a better an Internet that belongs to everyone, using openness and innovation. :+1: \n\nYou\u2019re right, let\u2019s stop that discussion here. So here\u2019s a short summary of the results:\n- Recommendation for maintainers who read the wiki: UTF-8.\n- If maintainers don\u2019t use UTF-8, no problem as long as they don\u2019t use non-ASCII characters.\n- Incorrectly displayed characters on Chocolatey.org are not a _serious_ problem as long as the affected packages are functional.\n. Of course.\n. :smile: \n\nI have an idea how we can solve this problem once and for all, even for Richards, Hanks and for people who have not a single clue about character encodings. As you know, there\u2019s much work on the computer that can be automated. Why not automate a character encoding conversion to the correct encodings before a package gets built? That conversion could be for example executed as first step of the `cpack` command.\n\nNow to the technical part: I already mentioned that character encoding detection is not a simple task. I requires a lot more than just a few lines of code. This document describes the approaches: http://www-archive.mozilla.org/projects/intl/UniversalCharsetDetection.html\n\nFor Python, there exists a nice tool to detect the character encoding: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/chardet/2.1.1\n\nI also discovered a PowerShell script that do the same: http://danspowershellstuff.blogspot.it/2012/02/get-file-encoding-even-if-no-byte-order.html.\n\nIf we were on Linux, these things would be a lot easier: using `file -i` to detect the character encoding and `iconv` to convert it.\n. > I don't think that will work. Once you save your file in standard (according to Windows) encoding, the character becomes unreadable when you reopen the file. But when I change encoding to utf-8, the char remains unreadable. I have to enter it again.\n\nI don\u2019t understand what you mean by that. Why would the characters become unreadable? Of course the character encoding conversion works. I tested it myself using Cygwin with the `file -i` and `iconv` method.\n. The `nuspec` files are never converted to ASCII, so that\u2019s not the problem here. The problem we need to solve is that some package maintainers save them in Windows-1252 instead of UTF-8.\n. > It sounds like cpack would be too late in the process to be helpful.\n\nWhy too late? When you for example execute the `cpack` command, the character encodings (Windows-1252, UCS-2 or other weird encodings) could be converted into UTF-8 first and then the cpack command could do the same like it already does now.\n. @Redsandro, you wrote this:\n\n> Once certain characters are \u25a1, like \u25a1Torrent \u25a12013 bitTorrent\u25a1, you can't get them back from a conversion.\n> \n> I just tried. If you save it directly and load it directly, there is no problem. But if you save your package to a git repository, load it on a different machine and then push it, it's already too late.\n\nI tried to reproduce this with Git, but the characters are all fine. This is the workflow I used:\n1. Save `uTorrent.nuspec` with Windows-1252 encoding, including an \u03bc character.\n2. Commit & push\n3. Git clone to another directory on the computer\n4. Convert the nuspec to UTF-8 without BOM\n5. Commit & push\n6. Git clone to another folder on the computer\n7. Open nuspec, the editor correctly recognises the file as UTF-8 and the \u03bc character gets displayed correctly\n\nSo here absolutely nothing gets lost. I used https://github.com/tomone/suggestions as my testing repository.\n\nBut if you try do download an already built package like [\u03bcTorrent](http://chocolatey.org/api/v2/package/uTorrent/3.3.2), unpack it and open the nuspec, your editor will probably show `\ufffdTorrent`. Also setting the encoding to Windows-1252 does not help. Building a package probably causes non-UTF-8 encodings to be destroyed. I don\u2019t know what there happens in the background, because I have only basic knowledge about character encodings.\n\nSo the only workflow where the character encoding would be destroyed is the following:\n1. Create a package, using some non-ASCII characters like \u00a9, \u00ae, \u03bc or \u2013.\n2. Save nuspec as Windows-1252\n3. Build package\n4. On every package update, take a previously built package (the nupkg), extract it, insert the new version and download links and then build it again.\n\nWell, this is a weird workflow, but of course we also must take this into account. What about to let the cpack command scan the nuspec file for weird characters caused by a broken encoding and stop in that case? A meaningful error message could be displayed and then the package maintainer **must** investigate that character encoding problem.\n\n-- edit --\ncorrected step 4 of the second workflow\n. I\u2019ve investigated this problem and now I know a possible solution and what there happens in the background:\n- [Windows-1252](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252) is an 8-bit character encoding, while ASCII is has 7-bit.\n- In UTF-8, characters encoded with a single byte between (hex) 80 and FF are invalid, but in Windows-1252 these addresses represent characters like \u00b5, \u00c4, \u00ae and \u00a9.\n- NuGet assumes UTF-8 and therefore replaces the invalid single-byte-characters between 80 and FF with the Unicode replacement character \ufffd (`&#xfffd;`), which is an [option to handle this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utf-8#Invalid_byte_sequences).\n- Therefore this replacement character shows up in the gallery for example in the [\u03bcTorrent package](http://chocolatey.org/packages/uTorrent/3.3.1)\n- However, RFC 3629 states that implementations of the decoding algorithm **must** protect against decoding invalid sequences. The Unicode standard requires that decoders treat any invalid character sequence as an error condition.\n- If NuGet would follow RFC 3629 and throw an error when a maintainer attempts to package a Windows-1252 encoded nuspec with 80 to FF characters, we wouldn\u2019t have any problem.\n- Therefore, the best way to fix this issue is to implement such an error message on invalid UTF-8 characters directly in NuGet. Has anybody tested newer NuGet versions to see if this has been implemented already? If not, I would open an issue for this on CodePlex.\n- In the case the NuGet developers ignore this issue, I would really like if it gets implemented into Chocolatey\u2019s `cpack`, together with a character encoding detection and conversion to UTF-8.\n\n-- edit --\nSorry, it\u2019s (hex) 80 and not 7F.\n. Sorry, I forgot the solution for nuspecs whose Windows-1252 80 to FF characters have already been destroyed and replaced with \ufffd: `cpack` could detect if the \ufffd character is present in the nuspec, abort in that case and throw an error message. This message should mention that UTF-8 should be used and that \ufffd characters must be replaced with the correct characters, otherwise it won\u2019t proceed.\n\nLet\u2019s improve Chocolatey\u2019s package quality and ban those annoying \ufffd characters. :+1: \n\nI :heart: Unicode.\n. > Although I always thought `cpack` was just a reference plus some alternate configuration to the `nuget pack` binary.\n\nYes, it\u2019s a Windows Batch file in `C:\\Chocolatey\\bin\\cpack.bat`.\n\nBut if we really want to fix this character encoding problem, we need to add a control structure for it to the `cpack` command, since that is the only contact point between the package source files and Chocolatey before the package gets pushed. That\u2019s the only possibility, because there will always be people who don\u2019t read and respect rules and guidelines. And even if there would be some kind of moderation for Chocolatey packages, it\u2019s always better when something gets automated when it\u2019s possible, so it would be less work for the moderators.\n\nA good program doesn\u2019t let the user make mistakes if they can be detected, but also doesn\u2019t treat users like idiots. :smiley: I think this is one of the key rules of good usability.\n. I wrote a [small Bash-script](https://github.com/TomOne/suggestions/blob/master/convertscript.sh) which automatically converts all `*.nuspec` files from other encodings to UTF-8. This could be very useful for package maintainers that have many packages and want to make sure that **every** character in their nuspecs gets displayed correctly in the Gallery.\n\nIn addition, the script removes BOMs and replaces any XML declaration with `<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>`, so that package maintainers can see more easily that the file is encoded as UTF-8.\n\nThis script requires a Bash interpreter (on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows with Cygwin) and the program \u201crecode\u201d to perform the character encoding conversion. Recode is not installed by default in Cygwin and in most Linux distributions, but it\u2019s quite easy to install it.\n. Of course not every Windows user has Cygwin installed. I wrote this script in Bash because I like cross-platform solutions. Personally I don\u2019t like programming/scripting languages which work only on one platform, especially when that platform is a non-free proprietary operating system.\n\nNobody is forced to use this script and nothing prevents anybody from writing a similar script in PowerShell. :smiley: \n. Woah, there\u2019s a PowerShell implementation for Linux: http://pash.sourceforge.net/ :smile: \n. > I thought you were working towards a solution for all packagers from which there is no escape, preferably without them even knowing.\n\nYes, that would be a better solution. First I looked how such a script could be written in PowerShell, but I discovered that it\u2019s a lot more complicated (because you have to write the non-trivial character encoding recognition from scratch) and my PowerShell skills aren\u2019t good enough.\n. I have a new idea. Let me make a summary of a possible approach that would fix this issue:\nThe `cpack` command should perform the following checks before calling NuGet\u2019s `pack` command:\n- Check if the affected `*.nuspec` file is not encoded as UTF-8.\n- Check if an UTF-8 BOM is present.\n- Check if one or more Unicode replacement characters (\ufffd) are present in the `*.nuspec` file.\n\nIf one of the checks above is true, cpack should throw an exception and inform the package maintainer that something is wrong, i.e. that it\u2019s needed to convert the file to UTF-8. Then the maintainer could fix it and execute cpack again.\n\nI think this approach is much better than additional automatic charset conversion because of the following reasons:\n- It has a better learning effect for maintainers. If an automatic conversion would be performed, some maintainers would continue to use legacy character encodings (such as Windows-1252), without ever knowing that UTF-8 would be the correct encoding.\n- Package maintainers would learn that an UTF-8 BOM is a bad thing.\n- To replace \ufffd with the correct characters, it would be necessary anyway to manually edit the `*.nuspec` file.\n- As I already mentioned, a character encoding recognition is never 100 % accurate in all cases. In some rare cases, an automatic character encoding conversion to UTF-8 could result in an output file with wrong characters.\n\nPlease let me know if you have doubts and if you would be interested in this solution.\n. @Redsandro, thanks for the hint. Unfortunately _UTFCast Express_ only supports the _ASCII, UTF-8, UTF-16 Little Endian, UTF-16 Big Endian_ encodings. It does not support 8-bit-encodings (e.g _Windows-1252_) which mostly cause our encoding issues at Chocolatey.\n\nI couldn\u2019t find any free program which performs a batch convert of text files and supports all relevant encodings. To develop one would be a nice FOSS project though, especially useful for Windows users/developers :smiley: \n\nSome time ago I created a small node.js script which performs this task for a folder with Chocolatey/NuGet package source files: https://github.com/TomOne/cpkg-utf8-conv\n\nIt is still very naive, but it works. Of course it is not suitable to automagically prevent the encoding issues we have, but it\u2019s nice tool to clean existing package repositories. At least I like it more than my previous Bash script for this task. :smile: \n. BTW, some time ago I came across [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/). It\u2019s a plugin for many popular editors which automatically sets specific parameters for specific files in a repository. For example, you can write into the config file that all *.nuspec files should be saved as UTF-8 and all *.ps1 files as UTF-8 with BOM.\n\nI already use it for my packages repository: https://github.com/TomOne/chocolatey-packages/blob/master/.editorconfig\n\n@ferventcoder, it would be nice to integrate this also into the https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolateytemplates repository. So we can recommend to package maintainers to install the EditorConfig plugin and at least those folks won\u2019t create packages with inappropriate character encodings.\n. > But I'm not sure what good it would do since that is not a chocolatey packages template repository that they start from (if that makes sense).\n\nThat\u2019s right, it does not help much. But we could add to the [character encoding section in the wiki](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages#character-encoding) that package maintainers should \u2013 if they use EditorConfig \u2013 copy the `.editorconfig` file into the root directory of the repo. Unfortunately I noticed that only the plugin for Sublime Text seems to support the `charset` property of EditorConfig, so only Sublime Text users could actually benefit from that. But note that Sublime Text is one of the most popular code editors nowadays, so it wouldn\u2019t be completely useless.\n\nBTW, the following section is a bit offtopic, but I think it could be interesting for us:\n\nIn my previous comments I mentioned that Notepad++ (the editor with the most downloads on Chocolatey.org) uses an incorrect term to denote \u201cUTF-8 without BOM\u201d, which I also wrote into the [character encoding section in the wiki](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages#character-encoding). I created a [patch on the SourceForge Project site for Notepad++](https://sourceforge.net/p/notepad-plus/patches/571/) to correct that term. Let\u2019s hope that the Notpad++ devs eventually respond to that issue, so that we could reduce a little bit the confusion about character encodings that seems to persist in the Microsoft/Windows community.\n. Because PowerShell uses deprecated character encodings (known as Windows codepages and often incorrectly called \u201cANSI\u201d) by default and a BOM is the only way to force UTF-8.\n\nSee https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages#character-encoding for more information.\n. Good suggestion. This would also be more compliant to package managers for Linux. They also have a specific folder where they download their packages. It\u2019s called \u201cpackage cache\u201d. In apt-get for example, this cache can be cleared with `apt-get clean`. It would be great if we had such a command in chocolatey.\n. Perfect. :)\n. @ferventcoder, better also correct the Ketarin command in your blog: http://ferventcoder.com/archive/2013/01/03/chocolatey-automatic-packages.aspx\nThen this issue can be closed I think. :)\n. All right, I added it to the Wiki: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages#naming-your-package\n\nIt would be good to make known these guidelines. A tweet or/and a blog post would be perfect for that.\n\nAnother Question: What we do with the existing packages that do not follow these guidelines? To leave them so could confuse new package creators. A perfect solution for this issue are aliases: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org/issues/25\n. I browsed through the [Ubuntu package list](http://packages.ubuntu.com/) and discovered that not all packages follow the guideline with the hyphens. This rule was clearly too strict, because if for example the name of an application contains many short words separated by spaces, the many hyphens would disturb.\n\nSo I changed [this in the Wiki](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages#naming-your-package) to also allow no spaces for the package id when the original app name contains spaces.\n\nDo you think it\u2019s a good idea to add a link to the Ubuntu package list or even from other distributions to the _Naming your package_ section in the wiki? When for example someone makes a choco package and that package already exists as DEB/RPM package, it wouldn\u2019t be bad to pick the same package id. In that way Linux and Chocolatey users don\u2019t have to remember different package names.\n. But standards are not bad if they are sensible. ;) I know no other package format (except NuGet of course) which uses CamelCase for id.\n. Sorry, my mistake. ;)\n. Nice. :+1: I updated the wiki. Please check if I did everything correctly: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/ChocolateyFAQs#when-i-install-a-portable-app-like-imagemagicktool-how-is-it-on-my-path-without-littering-my-path\n. Thanks. Does that mean that I can add it to the Wiki?\n\nHmmm, I find it strange that every GitHub user can edit every Wiki without any moderation or inspection by the project members. This is in need of improvement.\n. @ferventcoder: OK, but what about my question?\n. I added it to the wiki: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages#package-icon-guidelines\n. Good, can you add this to the Wiki? Does it make sense to provide separate Ketarin templates for https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolateytemplates/tree/master/_templates/chocolateyauto and https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolateytemplates/tree/master/_templates/chocolateyauto3?\n. The term \u201cupdate\u201d is commonly used for bug fixes or minor software enhancements, while \u201cupgrade\u201d refers to more extensive feature enhancements. An \u201cupgrade\u201d generally leads to an increased major version number.\n\nTherefore these two terms are even not perfectly suitable like they are intended for apt-get.\n\nAbout two weeks ago I switched from Ubuntu to Arch Linux, a highly customizable Linux distribution with a rolling release policy and fast package updates (unlike Ubuntu or Debian, which is ultra-conservative in this area).\n\nArch Linux has its own package manager called _pacman_. Pacman uses a completely different syntax than apt-get, for example:\n\n``` Bash\npacman -S somepackage  # Installs or updates the specified package. The \u201cS\u201d stands for \u201csynchronizing\u201c with the repository. That\u2019s a very nice terminology if you ask me and more suitable than update/upgrade.\npacman -Sy  # update local database (package index), similar to \u2018apt-get update\u2019\npacman -Syu  # complete update of all packages, equivalent to \u2018apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade\u2019\n```\n\nAs you can see, the pacman commands are shorter than their apt-get equivalents. If we ever need to change command syntax of chocolatey, my vote is for a pacman-like syntax. :)\n. If you ask me, a local package database (same as package index) should have a high priority for every package management system. It\u2019s a pity that the NuGet devs didn\u2019t already implement it.\n\nMicrosoft isn\u2019t known for good software in this area. I\u2019m not sure if _Windows Update_ can be seen as package management, but it\u2019s a fact that it\u2019s extremely slow, inefficient and badly designed. For example, it doesn\u2019t install all required updates at once, but it installs some updates, then it needs to reboot, then the next updates, reboot again and so on. That\u2019s ridiculous. ;) If for example an update is superseded by another update, it installs first the old update and then the update which superseded the previous update. Score one for inefficiency. :-1: It looks that Windows Update also has no package (update) index.\n. Done.\n. @ferventcoder: I\u2019ve seen you use Google Analytics on chocolatey.org. It would be very interesting to know how many visitors use IE8 or lower. Then we have facts.\n. Thanks for providing these statistics. IE8 usage is low, as I had expected. But even in 8 months when Windows XP support ends it won\u2019t be zero. :-1: \n\nHowever, I found a very simple solution for a fallback to PNG if a browser doesn\u2019t support SVG using the JavaScript plugin [SVGeezy](http://benhowdle.im/svgeezy/). Then this simple JavaScript code will replace all SVGs with their PNG equivalents:\n\n``` JavaScript\nsvgeezy.init(false, 'png');\n```\n\nThis assumes of course that in the same directory in addition to the SVG file there must exist the equivalent PNG file (e. g. http://example.com/icon.svg and http://example.com/icon.png). But that\u2019s not a problem at all, we just need to mention that in the icon guidelines in the wiki.\n\nI would be very pleased to make a pull request for chocolatey.org to integrate this fallback. @ferventcoder, is that OK for you?\n. Tiny. Only 1.158 KB for the minified version, see the code: https://github.com/benhowdle89/svgeezy/blob/master/svgeezy.min.js\n. Great. I have good news for you. We don\u2019t even need SVGeezy. This plugin was designed for folks who don\u2019t already have Mondernizr and jQuery integrated in their pages, but chocolatey.org has them integrated. So Modernizr can be used for feature detection and jQuery for DOM manupulation and the code becomes even simpler, without the need of SVGeezy:\n\n``` JavaScript\nif (!Modernizr.svg) {\n    $('img[src$=\".svg\"]').each(function()\n    {\n        $(this).attr('src', $(this).attr('src').replace('.svg', '.png'));\n    });\n}\n```\n\nI found this code on [David Bushell\u2019s blog](http://dbushell.com/2013/02/04/a-primer-to-front-end-svg-hacking/), a guy who seems to be very interested into SVG. :+1: \n\nIn addition I played around with SVGZ. That is the gzipped format of SVG. SVG is highly compressible, because it contains a lot of redundant data (like HTML). I was very curious about the filesizes of SVG, SVGZ and PNG in comparison. Therefore I generated some files:\n\nFile size in bytes, filename\n\n1141, [git.svg](http://walterbz.com/git.svg)\n782, [git-opt.svg](http://walterbz.com/git-opt.svg)\n437, [git-opt.svgz](http://walterbz.com/git-opt.svgz)\n1699, [git-opt-128px.png](http://walterbz.com/git-opt-128px.png)\n868, [git-opt-48px.png](http://walterbz.com/git-opt-48px.png)\n\n56431, [mixxx.svg](http://walterbz.com/mixxx.svg)\n16839, [mixxx-opt.svg](http://walterbz.com/mixxx-opt.svg)\n2357, [mixxx-opt.svgz](http://walterbz.com/mixxx-opt.svgz)\n5278, [mixxx-opt-128px.png](http://walterbz.com/mixxx-opt-128px.png)\n1674, [mixxx-opt-48px.png](http://walterbz.com/mixxx-opt-48px.png)\n\n28718, [pyhoca-gui.svg](http://walterbz.com/pyhoca-gui.svg)\n12009, [pyhoca-gui-opt.svg](http://walterbz.com/pyhoca-gui-opt.svg)\n3190, [pyhoca-gui-opt.svgz](http://walterbz.com/pyhoca-gui-opt.svgz)\n16306, [pyhoca-gui-opt-128px.png](http://walterbz.com/pyhoca-gui-opt-128px.png)\n4067, [pyhoca-gui-opt-48px.png](http://walterbz.com/pyhoca-gui-opt-48px.png)\n\nDescription of these files with the example of git:\n- git.svg = original SVG file\n- git-opt-svg = optimized SVG file with [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo), a Node.js tool\n- git-opt.svgz = gzip compressed optimized SVG file\n- git-opt-128px.png = equivalent raster image with 128px, optimized with `optipng -o7`\n- git-opt-48px.png = equivalent raster image with 48px, optimized with `optipng -o7`\n\nAs you can see, SVGZ is clearly smaller than the raster version with 128px, and in some cases even smaller than the 48px version. SVGZ is a very interesting format, perfectly suitable to use it as package icons on chocolatey.org.\n\nHowever, SVGZ cannot be directly integrated in websites without an additional step. The web server must be configured to tell the browser \u201chey this is gzipped, you\u2019ll need to decompress this\u201d.\nThis can be done in Apache by adding this to the .htaccess file:\n\n```\n# SVG\nAddType image/svg+xml .svg .svgz\nAddEncoding x-gzip .svgz\n```\n\nI don\u2019t know how to configure IIS to handle SVGZ properly, but you certainly know it. It would be great if you could test it.\n. Yes, http://semver.org/ is nice, but it only refers to the versioning of an application itself, not the distiction between upstream and package version. Therefore it does not help here.\n\nI like the epoch part in [Debian package versioning](http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Version). It\u2019s a very good idea, because it allows a trouble-free continuation of the version, even when the version policy changes or when there was a mistake in versioning.\n\nThe versioning of Linux packages is a lot better than the one of NuGet. I regret that they have not taken a good example of them. It is not an easy task to change something fundamental like this later.\n. I just don\u2019t see any sensible reason why a package management system should force to mix together the version of the packaged software with package revisions without proper separator characters. In fact I don\u2019t know any other package manager than NuGet/Chocolatey which forces maintainers to do this.\n\nIf for example a Chocolatey package has the version `1.10.3.20140327` I would naturally understand from it that it is also the version of the packaged software. Of course folks can learn that if the fourth segment is an ISO 8601 date, it is a package fix notation, but it is not obvious. Better would be `1.10.3-20140327`, with a hyphen as separator (like used by Debian and Arch Linux), so that people understand that the part after a hyphen belongs to the package version fix notation.\n\nThe current restrictive versioning policy of NuGet/Chocolatey has also other issues:\n- What if the software itself already uses four dot-separated segments for its version and you need to fix the package?\n  If you have for example a software version `2.5.8.1`, you are forced to alter the last segment, so the original software version information gets destroyed: `2.5.8.20140327`. Then, for all the following packages of version `2.5.8.x`, you are forced to use the current date as last segment, even if the affected package does not actually fix a previous package revision. You would have to wait until the packaged software gets released with version `2.5.9.x` to be able to drop the date in the last segment and use the real software version again. So here an essential information is removed just because of a senseless restriction.\n- What if you have a package with version `2.5.8.20140327` and you need to fix it again on the same day? Do you use the date of the following day? That\u2019s not semantically correct. :smile:\n- What if you have released a package and made a mistake in the package version, e.g. `2.5.6` instead of `2.4.6`? NuGet / Chocolatey provides no solution for this, except unlisting a package. But what if already hundreds of people downloaded the package? If you unlist it and the software version `2.4.7` comes out, all users who have the package with the wrong `2.5.6` simply won\u2019t get an update. With something similar like Debian\u2019s epoch notation there wouldn\u2019t be this issue.\n\nAllowing only semver for package versions is not a good idea. Package managers must be more flexible to avoid these versioning issues.\n. @ferventcoder: Yes, but apart from distorting the original version information, the approach of modifying the already existent fourth segment doesn\u2019t solve the problem of an accidentally misspelled first, second or third segment. I described that problem already in my previous comment (in the third list item). It happened to the Dropbox package: http://chocolatey.org/packages/dropbox/9.20. Fortunately there were only 8 downloads of the misspelled version.\n\n> It's not perfect and yes we should look at enhancing stuff like that. Where do you see this in terms of priority?\n\nOf course Chocolatey also works with the current versioning scheme, but to become a robust and well established package management system, this is definitely an important issue to consider. I don\u2019t want to blame the NuGet developers, but If I would build a package management system, I would never apply such a restricted and inflexible versioning policy. SemVer is nice for applications, but not appropriate for package versioning.\n. @abombss, thanks for explaining your point of view.\n\nMy idea is just to look at how other popular package managers for operating systems are built and to learn from them. For example, consider the `openssl` package of other package managers:\n- Debian: https://packages.debian.org/sid/openssl\n- Ubuntu: http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/openssl\n- Arch Linux: https://www.archlinux.org/packages/core/x86_64/openssl/\n- Gentoo: http://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo-x86/dev-libs/openssl/ChangeLog?view=markup\n- opkg: http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/packages/openssl-util_1.0.1g-1_ar71xx.ipk\n- MacPorts: https://www.macports.org/ports.php?by=name&substr=openssl\n- Fink: http://pdb.finkproject.org/pdb/package.php/openssl\n- Fedora: http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/openssl.git/tree/\n\nAs you can see, every single package manager in this list allows the original version notation of openssl (currently `1.0.1g`) in the package version. In this way, an user immediately sees what version of openssl the package contains. I don\u2019t think that this approach is bad as almost all package managers adopted it. The only \u201cdisadvantage\u201d of this approach is that the versioning logic is a bit more complex. But in my opinion in this area a good user experience should have a higher priority than avoiding a little more program complexity. The creators and programmers of these other package managers seem to agree with me.\n\nOr do you think it is better to be forced to version the openssl package with something like `1.0.1.20140411` like [OpenSSL.Light](http://chocolatey.org/packages/OpenSSL.Light) from Chocolatey? I don\u2019t think so.\n\nA separate \u201ccontent version\u201d could be another approach, but that would also bring more complexity into Chocolatey and could also confuse users, because then there would be two version strings and the user must distinguish between them.\n\nI don\u2019t see any sensible reason why Chocolatey should not adopt proven patterns of other popular package managers. I remember to have read \u201cChocolatey NuGet - kind of like apt-get \u2026\u201d in the [Chocolatey wiki](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki). From this I understand that Chocolatey intends to learn from apt-get, otherwise it wouldn\u2019t make sense to write this. :smiley: \n. Yes, I agree with you. But remember that many of these name prefixed and duplicate packages were created **before** I suggested the package rules and added them to the wiki after Rob had approved them. Sending the package rules with the confirmation e-mail would be a good idea, but in this way we won\u2019t reach already registered maintainers.\n\nA major problem is that also if new maintainers read the wiki once, they probably don\u2019t check the wiki every week/month for updates. The only solution to let them know about important wiki and guideline updates would be a kind of newsletter that is sent to **every** single maintainer. These e-mails should then contain a link to the updated wiki sections and an invitation to read them.\n\nBut I see that we are moving a bit offtopic here. If you would like to discuss this aspect further, please open a new thread in the forum.\n\nThis issue is about an improved package triage process. There will always be package maintainers that **ignore** contributions and pull requests from others. The reasons for that are varied:\n- Not even time for a couple of seconds for a short reply to the person who contacted the maintainer\n- The desire to destroy or to harm the Chocolatey community\n- Disinterest, laziness or stubbornness\n  All these behaviours are unacceptable, so the main purpose of this improved triage process is to reduce the amount of time, effort and the vexation when people make pull requests to package maintainers.\n. Awesome :+1: \n. @Redsandro, actually only `.portable` and `.install` are official suffixes. They are essential to understand what the package contains. I suggested them a few months ago and they were accepted. The other suffixes are deprecated, but obviously older packages still use them. And there are still folks which ignore the rules and guidelines in the wiki and use the deprecated suffixes. This problem will never be solved until chocolatey packages get inspected by moderators before they get published.\n. Good, so the suggested modifications to the package rules are approved. Can someone apply them to the Wiki? Or can I do it? It\u2019s better to do it sooner than later. :smile: \n. > Shall we use that by default and let OS and FS handle all instead of a separate EXE and just fall back to shimgen if no link functionality is available?\n\nDo you mean symbolic links? The support for symbolic links on Windows is very naive. If you make for example a symbolic link to an EXE and that EXE requires an external library, the symbolic link won\u2019t resolve the relative path to it. This makes symbolic links on Windows unusable and useless in many cases, because many programs require external libraries. Unix-like systems don\u2019t have this limitation. I think this is also the reason because shims are preferred here.\n. Unfortunately not. Shimgen is closed-source proprietary software. Here\u2019s the license text: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/tools/shimgen.license.txt\n. > I also wanted to post up a new feature to allow you to remove OLD VERSIONS of software.\n\nLike it. But if you ask me, it should be the default behavior of Chocolatey to **remove** the old version when a package gets updated. Every other package manager on Linux (apt-get, yum, opkg, pacman) does that.\n\nPlease forgive me if I am a bit direct here, but I think the current design of Chocolatey to keep older package versions is neither useful nor appropriate. Why don\u2019t follow the design of well established package managers that have already millions of (mostly satisfied) users?\n\nMaybe some people think here that it\u2019s sometimes needed to keep for example older versions of the same Ruby package (for example 1.9 if their app is not compatible with 2.0). But it is the wrong approach, because doing so the idea of a package manager would be undermined. If you have for example two versions of exactly same package installed (let\u2019s say Ruby versions 1.9 and 2.0), the Ruby 1.9.x branch would never be automatically updated, because 2.0 is already newer. If the 1.9.x branch would get an important security update, you would miss it with the current design of Chocolatey, because version 2.0 is newer than 1.9.x.\n\nIt is far better to keep **different** packages for each maintained branch, e.g. `ruby1.9` and `ruby2.0`. The same applies to candidates like `php5.3`, `php5.4`, and `php5.5`. Note that also this approach is already used in the Linux package manager world. The benefits of this: an user can choose which branch he would like to install and then that version **automatically** gets its updates.\n\nOr can you tell me what is the actual benefit to have these packages installed simultaneously?\n- CCleaner 4.08.4428\n- CCleaner 4.07.4369\n- CCleaner 4.06.4324\n- CCleaner 4.05.4250\n- CCleaner 4.04.4197\n- CCleaner 4.03.4151\n- CCleaner 4.02.4115.20130609\n- CCleaner 4.02.4115.20130601\n- CCleaner 4.02.4115\n- CCleaner 4.01.40933\n- Java Runtime (JRE) 7.0.45\n- Java Runtime (JRE) 7.0.40.20131007\n- Java Runtime (JRE) 7.0.40\n- Java Runtime (JRE) 7.0.25\n- Java Runtime (JRE) 7.0.21\n- Java Runtime (JRE) 7.0.17\n- Java Runtime (JRE) 7.0.15\n- Java Runtime (JRE) 7.0.11\n- Java Runtime (JRE) 7.0.9\n- Java Runtime (JRE) 7.0.5.1\n- Java Runtime (JRE) 7.0.5\n- Java Runtime (JRE) 6.0.31.1\n- Jave Runtime (JRE) 6.0.30\n\nPlease also read my other statements why the design to keep older versions is bad idea: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/259#issuecomment-23863107\n. > are you sure Linux apt-get REMOVES old versions?\n\nYes, 100&nbsp;% sure. :smile: \n\n> I thought it only does that when you run 'apt-get autoremove\n\nNo, `apt-get autoremove` does something completely different: autoremove is used to remove packages that were automatically installed to satisfy dependencies for some package and that are no more needed.\n\n> I think it's useful to have old versions locally so you can revert back to them and not rely on the remote source being online.\n\nExactly that is not possible with Chocolatey at the moment, because it downloads files **every** time when you install a package, even if exactly the same files were already downloaded previously. So it\u2019s not a \u201csmart\u201d download cache like apt-get has.\n. I would prefer a cache management like apt-get has. To download again already downloaded files like Chocolatey does is a bit inefficient, don\u2019t you think so?\n. @ferventcoder yes, good idea. I\u2019m going to do that.\n. This is not the right place to report issues with Chocolatey packages, it\u2019s only for Chocolatey itself. If you have a problem with a package or a question about it, use the [contact maintainers link](https://chocolatey.org/packages/javaruntime/ContactOwners), or better, report the issue in the GitHub repo where the package source files are hosted.\n\nI opened an issue in the corresponding repository: https://github.com/TomOne/chocolatey-packages/issues/3. Refer to it and close this one.\n. Are you sure? Then why it does work on 0.9.8.23? Also the `thunderbird` package is affected by the same error.\n\nPerhaps also other packages are broken after the update to 0.9.8.24. But I\u2019ll try to debug the `firefox` package first.\n. Yes, it works. But what should I do in the meantime with the `firefox` and `thunderbird` packages until 0.9.8.25 becomes final? Firefox is one of the most popular packages on Chocolatey.org, so there are lots of users affected by this error. Should I use `wget` in the meantime to download the HTML file, or do you have a better idea?\n. Good\n. @ferventcoder wrote:\n\n> If the package is doing something more than it should be and/or not using the helpers, I fully expect those packages to break. And they should b/c they need to stay out of chocolatey's purview. Anything that reaches into chocolatey's internals and uses functions, whatever, that are not in the API will start to break hard once choco.exe comes out.\n\nSorry, but I don\u2019t agree with you here. First of all, the `firefox` package uses Chocolatey helpers whenever possible. And if I understood it right, it is the `Get-ChocolateyWebFile` helper which causes this package to break, so it is not the fault of the `firefox` package.\n\nAre you seriously saying that every package code outside Chocolatey\u2019s API (e.g regular PowerShell code) will start to break once Chocolatey gets rewritten in C#? Sorry, but that is an extremely unwise idea in my opinion. A package manager \u2013 especially on Windows \u2013 needs to support an entire scripting language in order to cover the various tasks needed to install software and get it to work. I hope that you won\u2019t drop regular PowerShell code support, otherwise Chocolatey will be a lot less useful.\n. @Redsandro: Good one :+1:\n\nFYI: Error 1603 is nasty. This error code is not only thrown when there is \u201ca problem with the system configuration\u201d, but also when an user attempts to install an MSI package that is already installed on the computer in the same version (of course when installed via the silent parameters). This happened quite often with Chocolatey packages, especially with the javaruntime package. Many users complained about the 1603 error until I figured out what the actual cause was.\n\nM$ has a strange conception as errors. Personally I wouldn\u2019t classify a re-installation of the same software version as error, would you? That and only confuses users. A re-installation of the same software version does not harm anything an is not a undesirable \u201cerror\u201d state.\n. :+1: for this. I also would find it much nicer if the original exe icon would be used.\n\nThat is also the reason why there exist different icons for different programs, isn\u2019t it? :smiley: \n. > I'm curious... why the \"shim\" versus mklink?\n\nBecause MS failed to correctly implement symlinks. To create symlinks on Windows requires administrator rights and attempting to run them from GUI (Explorer) fails with an error. In addition, they don\u2019t resolve paths correctly (e.g. paths to DLLs are not resolved correctly).\n. > For me, the advantage of the shim's is running the application's from the command line, so icons don't really matter for me. Personal preference I guess.\n\nI see shimgen as workaround for a broken symlink support in Windows. On Windows and on other operating systems, symlinks always inherit the icon of their target. IMHO that makes sense, doesn\u2019t it?\n. > I see. How does one create their own shims? We might have a use.\n\nShimGen is non-free proprietary software: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/master/src/tools/shimgen.license.txt\n\nI guess the Chocolatey devs won\u2019t tell how it exactly works, otherwise they would have open-sourced it. :smiley:\n. ~~Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but could this have to do something with the recent force lowercasing the package IDs?~~\n\nSorry, wrong. I didn\u2019t read the issue carefully enough.\n. ",

Some of the paths in the current file structure are in the neighbourhood of 250 characters when unpacked into the C:\\Chocolatey\\lib\\ file path structure. If the unpacked location exceeds the path limit Windows will not allow the unpack to occur.\n. No. You can use the the helper for your springtoolsuite package. It's just that the paths of the files that are getting installed are quite long. If they continue to get longer you may soon reach the 260 character limit of Windows.\n\nIt's not a problem now I was just letting you know that you may run into issues in the future.

Most things you'd want to install in parallel (like Python 2 / Python 3 and Java 7 / Java 8) are already in separate packages, anyway. For those that aren't, maybe `cinst` should be used to install a new version without overwriting the old, while `cup` would by default just update and replace old packages. When/if version pinning ( see #5 ) is implemented, it would help users keep packages they want to keep while updating the rest without breaking anything.\n\nThe current behavior breaks file assocations (unless you remember to associate files with the shim instead of the application itself, but then all files get the generic Chocolatey icon no matter what program they're assocated with), Explorer integration, and pretty much every other level of integration (other than the shims) with every update. Atom, for example, has a context menu option to Edit with Atom, but I never know what version of Atom will open when I use it. Usually it uses the oldest version available.\n.

Most things you'd want to install in parallel (like Python 2 / Python 3 and Java 7 / Java 8) are already in separate packages, anyway. For those that aren't, maybe `cinst` should be used to install a new version without overwriting the old, while `cup` would by default just update and replace old packages. When/if version pinning ( see #5 ) is implemented, it would help users keep packages they want to keep while updating the rest without breaking anything.\n\nThe current behavior breaks file assocations (unless you remember to associate files with the shim instead of the application itself, but then all files get the generic Chocolatey icon no matter what program they're assocated with), Explorer integration, and pretty much every other level of integration (other than the shims) with every update. Atom, for example, has a context menu option to Edit with Atom, but I never know what version of Atom will open when I use it. Usually it uses the oldest version available.\n. ",

    "jberezanski": "@gabisa:\n\n> IMO, the correct behavior for the update in this situation is: \n> \u2022if no same version detected - do nothing\n> \u2022if a higher version is detected: \u25e6run the uninstall for the old version - execute the chocolateyUninstall.ps1 script (if exists)\n> \u25e6run the install for the new version - execute the chocolateyInstall.ps1 script (if exists)\n\nI'm afraid that won't do in the general case.\n\nMost nontrivial programs create and keep some state that needs to be preserved when upgrading, but removed when uninstalling: configuration, log files etc. Simply running \"uninstall\" and \"install\", without any sort of cooperation between these two, would destroy that state.\n\nIn addition, an intelligent update (e.g. MSI) could only perform the adjustments necessary to bring the installed software up to the latest version, potentially reducing the time needed to perform the update and minimizing the disturbance to the system.\n\nTherefore, the scripts and installers need to be aware that they are invoked in an update scenario, so that they are able to act appropriately.\n\nI see two solutions:\n1) Introduce the \"chocolateyUpdate.ps1\" script mentioned in the title, which should be placed in the newer package (the newer version knows about older versions, but not the other way around). Chocolatey should call that script if it exists (and skip chocolateyUninstall.ps1 from the existing, older package), otherwise fall back to uninstall old + install new.\n2) Add parameter(s) to chocolateyInstall.ps1 and chocolateyUninstall.ps1 to make them aware that they are being called in an update scenario. (Not a fan of this one, because it would complicate those scripts.)\n. @ferventcoder:\n\n> And this  chocolateyUpdate.ps1  could call the older package's uninstall should the maintainer know the ramifications of this.\n\nPrecisely. The version and path to the package being upgraded could be passed to the update script as parameters, making it really easy.\n\n@rismoney: That would work, too. However, switching to the single file model brings with itself the challenge of reeducating package maintainers and possibly converting existing packages.\n. I don't understand all the anti-BOM advice.\n\nA BOM is a very big clue for the software that reads the file that the file is UTF-8. Without the BOM, the software needs to guess by examining the file contents - an inexact and error-prone process - or assume some default encoding. True, there are programs out there which have incomplete/broken UTF-8 implementation and choke on a BOM, but they are not relevant to Chocolatey. On the other hand, .NET I/O classes by default take advantage of the BOM to unambiguously (or, at least, with a very high degree of probability) detect the encoding of opened files, so all .NET programs (in particular, PowerShell and NuGet) are BOM-aware.\n\nAs a BOM is required for ps1 files (due to PowerShell not playing the guessing game) and not-required-but-sometimes-helpful-for-text-editors for nuspec files, an advice for package creators to always use a BOM would be simpler to follow and less error prone.\n. No fix is necessary, it works right now (0.9.8.27).\nhttps://chocolatey.org/packages/utf8-test\nhttps://github.com/jberezanski/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/utf8-test/utf8-test.nuspec (note: github web view will not show the BOM, even in Raw mode - you need to clone the repo if you wish to verify)\nThe package was built using `cpack` and pushed with `cpush`.\n. It does have when I'm logged in, does not when visiting the page anonymously. Probably because it has not been approved yet (not that I expect it to ever be).\n![utf8-test](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1577094/4801819/690def30-5e39-11e4-8970-c25f878e2cc2.png)\n. @Redsandro:\n\n> Are you sure you ignored all the 'rules'?\n\nI ignored one rule: \"Do not save your  *.nuspec  files with a Byte Order Mark (BOM)\". I followed the other ones.\n\n@ferventcoder:\n\n> When the advice went out we were on Nuget.exe 2.1 and we are using 2.8 now. That could be the difference.\n\nPossible. I found [this one reference from 2011](http://oldblog.davidebbo.com/2011/04/easy-way-to-publish-nuget-packages-with.html) to a NuGet bug with respect to BOM handling, but the bug had apparently been fixed immediately after being reported. Not sure what NuGet version number was that.\n\nMy test proves that current versions of NuGet and the Chocolatey gallery correctly handle nuspec files saved as UTF-8 with BOM. To sum it up, the technical requirements currently are:\n1) nuspec files: should be UTF-8, BOM is optional\n2) ps1 files: should be UTF-8, BOM is _mandatory_\n\nI therefore suggest the following change to the character encoding guidance:\nInstead of those three points\n\n```\n\u2022 Do not save your  *.nuspec  files with a Byte Order Mark (BOM). A  BOM  is neither required nor recommended for  UTF-8 , because it can lead to several issues.\n\u2022 PowerShell scripts need to be saved in UTF-8 with  BOM . PowerShell is ignoring the standards and needs a  BOM  in order to recognize scripts as  UTF-8 . Otherwise it processes non  ASCII  characters incorrectly.\n\u2022 Don\u2019t use the default Windows Editor. In addition to its lack of features, it can\u2019t even save  UTF-8  files without  BOM (...)\n```\n\nthis:\n\n```\n\u2022 DO save your *.nuspec files and PowerShell scripts (*.ps1) with a Byte Order Mark (BOM). It helps the tools parse non-ASCII characters correctly and is required by PowerShell.\n```\n. I think I like the [RPM versioning scheme](http://www.rpm.org/max-rpm/s1-intro-to-rpm-whats-in-package.html) best. The package version there consists of the full version number of packaged software, followed by a distinctly separated package revision number (an integer starting at 1). The third revision of openssl 1.0.1g would be named `openssl-1.0.1g-3`. That way the package can be fixed without artificially changing the packaged software version number, yet the system remains quite simple and does not present the user with two full-length, four-part version numbers.\n\nOne way to implement it on top of NuGet infrastructure could be perhaps to expose the packaged software version number to NuGet as the package version and keep the package revision as custom metadata used only by Chocolatey (and visible on the package details page in the gallery). For fixing a package, Chocolatey gallery should allow uploading a new package with the same NuGet-visible version number as the current one but increased revision. As a consequence, updating a package to fix/improve the install script would not prompt an update for users which already have that package installed - a good thing, IMO.\n\n(To elaborate on the last point, an example: I installed MS SQL 2012 from a package, working around a bug in its chocolateyInstall. After I notified the package owner, he fixed the script and released an updated package. Now that package shows in cver as an available update, but one I do not need or want to install, since I already have a working SQL Server installed by the previous package revision. If the package version exposed to NuGet was the exact version of packaged software, I would not be offered an update - correct, since I do not need it.)\n. In the Resharper case, I'd argue that major versions (with non-transferable licenses) should be released as different packages, e.g. resharper7 and resharper8.\n. Good point. But in that case, the burden of preventing an unwanted/potentially breaking update should ideally lie with the package author, not the user. I.e. the 7.x package should somehow indicate in its metadata that it should not be automatically updated to 8.0 or higher. (But this is more in the topic of #5.)\n. Another thing to consider is that creating a symlink is a privileged operation on Windows, so it would not work for regular users.\n. @mlt right, I forgot about hard links. Coincidentally, Windows itself uses them for similar purpose, creating links in system32 (and other places) to exes and dlls in WinSxS (the unmanaged assembly cache).\n\n@ferventcoder hard links are fully supported in xp/2003 (actually, even in 2000). The convenient command line tool `mklink` is only available in Vista+, however, so Chocolatey would need to ship its own simple binary exposing the `CreateHardLink` API.\n\nOh, and the logic should fall back to shims in cases when the hard link obviously cannot be used, e.g. $ChocolateyBinRoot is on a different drive than $ChocolateyInstall\\bin, or link creation fails (e.g. both variables seem to point to the same drive, but one or more of the directories is actually a NTFS junction pointing to a different drive or even a file share).\n. The new output formatting looks really nice, much more readable than current Chocolatey output. But the fact that it comes from the new binary implementation is even better news :)\n\nDo you plan on providing only an exe, or perhaps a PowerShell module as well? Personally, I find it very convenient to be able to invoke chocolatey.ps1 directly from a PS script without paying the overhead of spawning a new process. PS cmdlets could also return objects as their output, making processing that output in scripts much easier and more reliable.\n. In line 33, the `-match` operator returns a boolean value indicating whether the match succeeded or not. Because this value is neither assigned to a variable nor used in any other way, it becomes part of the function output.\n\nTo fix this, either:\n1) pipe the result to Out-Null: \n`$html -match \"(?ms)data-dl-url=['`\\`\"](.+?)['`\\`\" ]+data-nodlm-url\" | Out-Null`\nor, better, 2) actually check if the match succeeded: \n`if ($html -notmatch \"(?ms)data-dl-url=['`\\`\"](.+?)['`\\`\" ]+data-nodlm-url\") { throw \"Match failed\" }`\n. The \"sysnative\" special alias is not a feature of \"32-bit shells\" (or cmd.exe in particular), rather [it is provided by the WOW64 layer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa384187.aspx) and available to all 32-bit applications running on 64-bit Windows, PowerShell included.\nThere is no need to pay the cost of invoking an intermediate cmd.exe.\n. The wrapper uninstall issues are already fixed in the not-yet-released 0.9.8.24 (GH-418, GH-446, GH-480).\n. The current implementation of `Invoke-ChocolateyFunction` simply catches the exception and rethrows its message. This has no effect on control flow. (It is also, by the way, suboptimal behavior because it loses valuable information, such as the type of the exception; a `throw` statement without arguments would rethrow the exception without losing information. But that's another matter.)\n\nYour original implementation would indeed use the `exit` keyword to terminate running the entire script (and return an exit code). In my opinion internal functions should never make such decisions, as they have no knowledge about the context in which they were called. In such scenario Chocolatey had no chances of handling the error in any way or perform any rollback or cleanup actions. Indeed, a later commit by @ferventcoder (54716e03) disabled the mandatory exit because it interfered with the ability to continue installing subsequent packages if one package failed (ideally, that behavior should be controllable, but in any case the authority of deciding whether to stop execution is with `chocolatey.ps1`, not with a lower-level, internal command).\n\nHaving said that, you certainly have a point about returning an error code when something goes wrong. Powershell not doing that is actually a deficiency of powershell.exe when invoked with the `-file` argument (and documented in [about_Language_Keywords](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh847744.aspx)). I don't know how Powershell is invoked by Puppet, but in my automation scenario (a Jenkins deployment job) I worked around it by invoking Powershell with my script using the `-command` argument:\n\n```\npowershell.exe -command \"& myscript.ps1 args...\"\n```\n\nthis correctly returns a nonzero exit code if the script encounters an error. Please also note that some (\"non-terminating\") errors are subject to [$ErrorHandlingPreference](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh847796.aspx); I usually set it to \"Stop\" (most restrictive) immediately at the beginning of my scripts, so all errors behave like exceptions (e.g. transfer control to the nearest catch clause).\n. My point is, with an exit deep inside an internal function, there would be no way to implement that switch. Also, when an error is encountered during the installation, there is usually some cleanup to be performed, such as deleting the failed package from $Env:ChocolateyInstall\\lib.\n\nI also believe in failing early, but in a controllable fashion. I would not like it, for example, if fopen() called ExitProcess() if it failed to open the file.\n. Obsoleted by #446. Now that this works, I found a new issue concerning shimgen-generated exes - #449.\n. @ferventcoder currently Chocolatey cannot handle $binRoot set to C:\\, because the installation tracking feature (Write-FileUpdateLog) relies on being able to scan the entire directory hierarchy under $binRoot, which will almost certainly fail (no access to other users' profile directories, for instance).\n\nSo, without major code changes, a Chocolatey installation with $binRoot = C:\\ is a broken installation. Since the defective code that causes that is already out there, I would suggest implementing an automatic fix: treat C:\\ the same way as an unset $env:ChocolateyBinRoot and reset to the default (C:\\tools). That way users affected by this issue could get it fixed simply by upgrading Chocolatey.\n. How about renaming Get-ChecksumValid to Test-Checksum (or Test-FileChecksum)? It would be more consistent with Powershell cmdlet naming conventions and standard cmdlets, such as Test-Path, Test-Certificate or Test-Connection.\n\nOr is it too late for that change...?\n. How about verifying the checksum of the cached file as well (if the checksum is provided)? It would make it possible to automatically recover from corrupted downloads, when length matches but content does not. Currently such file will not be downloaded, but will fail the checksum test later.\n. Yes, I've seen that line (that's what I meant by \"the checksum test later\"). However, in the scenario I'm thinking about, it would be too late. Please consider the following sequence of events:\n1. the user invokes `cinst foo`\n2. chocolateyInstall.ps1 of the foo package invokes `Get-ChocolateyWebFile` to download http://unreliablehost.com/foo.zip\n3. foo.zip does not exist in the cache, so the [condition at L85](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/helpers/functions/Get-ChocolateyWebFile.ps1#L85) fails at `$fi.Exists`\n4. foo.zip is downloaded, but due to unreliable server/network connection/whatever ends up corrupted\n5. the [checksum test at L126](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/helpers/functions/Get-ChocolateyWebFile.ps1#L126) catches the corruption and raises an error\n6. installation fails\n7. the user invokes `cinst foo` again, hoping this time the file will be downloaded correctly\n8. chocolateyInstall.ps1 of the foo package invokes `Get-ChocolateyWebFile` to download http://unreliablehost.com/foo.zip\n9. foo.zip exists in the cache and has the expected size, so the [condition at L85](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/helpers/functions/Get-ChocolateyWebFile.ps1#L85) passes and $needsDownload is set to $false\n10. **foo.zip is not downloaded again and remains corrupted**\n11. the [checksum test at L126](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/helpers/functions/Get-ChocolateyWebFile.ps1#L126) catches the corruption and raises an error\n12. installation fails\n\nI propose modifying [L85](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/helpers/functions/Get-ChocolateyWebFile.ps1#L85) to:\n\n``` powershell\nif ($fi.Exists -and ($fi.Length -eq $headers[\"Content-Length\"]) -and (Get-CheckSumValid -file $fi -checkSum $checksum -checksumType $checksumType))\n```\n\nThat change would result in failing the condition at step 9 above and redownloading the file, hopefully uncorrupted this time.\n\nWithout that change, the user would need to delete the cached file by hand (be familiar with cache directory location and layout etc) to fix the broken download.\n. I'd only suggest, instead of complicating things for the caller by using a ref parameter, to return a PSObject with two properties: [string/uri] Url and [bool] Redirected. Or, even simpler, return redirected url or $null if not redirected.\n. Nice. For the record, this should also fix those two bugs:\n- #418 (batch redirects not being removed when uninstalling a package)\n- https://groups.google.com/d/topic/chocolatey/vxad3EOdRSI/discussion (\"-source\" argument causing `cinst all` to fail with \"invalid URI format\")\n. Done as GH-480, since existing PRs apparently cannot be retargeted.\n\nShould all PRs be sent against stable by default? It would be helpful to mention it in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) if that's the case.\n. The guidelines did not specify a target branch, but here's a PR :)\n. A very welcome feature! But, why only when no UAC (i.e. why not trigger elevation)?\n. When testing, please be aware that [Windows caches manifest information for an executable](http://csi-windows.com/blog/all/27-csi-news-general/245-find-out-why-your-external-manifest-is-being-ignored) (including whether the manifest is present or not) for the duration of the logon session, so the external manifest may be ignored by the system until you logoff and logon again, if it has just been added and 7za.exe has been run earlier. To force invalidation of the cached information, change the \"last modified\" time of 7za.exe (the actual value does not matter as long as it is different than the previous time).\n. Yes, you just need to put it next to 7za.exe.\n. Good question. Each exe which might possibly write to a protected location should have a manifest. However, all other exes currently included with Chocolatey (shimgen.exe, checksum.exe, nuget.exe and even shimgen-generated exes in redirects directory) actually do have an embedded manifest with UAC info - you can quickly verify it with the sigcheck SysInternals tool (run sigcheck -m xyz.exe). So only 7za needs to be provided with an external one.\n. It should be. However, there are some gotchas.\n\nFirst, since Start-Process does not set the $LastExitCode PS variable, you need to use the -PassThru argument to Start-Process to receive a Process object, then check its ExitCode property, e.g.\n\n```\n$p = Start-Process $7zip (...) -PassThru\n$exitCode = $p.ExitCode\nswitch ($exitCode) {\n    0: { break }\n    1: { throw 'Some files could not be extracted' } # this one is returned for access denied errors\n    2: { throw '7-Zip encountered a fatal error while extracting the files' }\n    7: { throw '7-Zip command line error' }\n    8: { throw '7-Zip out of memory' }\n    255: { throw 'Extraction cancelled by the user' }\n    default: { throw \"7-Zip signalled an unknown error (code $exitCode)\" }\n}\n```\n\nUnfortunately, Write-FileUpdateLog complicates matters further, as it currently does not allow passing arguments to the scriptblock, so Get-ChocolateyUnzip constructs the scriptblock from strings (complex/messy). A slight modification to Write-FileUpdateLog would support that:\n\n```\nfunction Write-FileUpdateLog {\n  param (\n    [string] $logFilePath,\n    [string] $locationToMonitor,\n    [scriptblock] $scriptToRun,\n    [object[]] $argumentList\n  )\n  (...)\n  # instead of & $scriptToRun\n  Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock $scriptToRun -ArgumentList $argumentList\n  (...)\n}\n```\n\nThe scriptblock in Get-ChocolateyUnzip would be constructed so:\n\n```\n$unzipOps = { \n    param($7zip, $destination, $fileFullPath, [ref]$exitCodeRef)\n    $p = Start-Process $7zip (...) -PassThru\n    $exitCodeRef.Value = $p.ExitCode\n}\n$exitCode = -1\nWrite-FileUpdateLog -logFilePath $zipExtractLogFullPath -locationToMonitor $destination -scriptToRun $unzipOps -argumentList $7zip,$destination,$fileFullPath,([ref]$exitCode)\nswitch ($exitCode) {\n(...)\n```\n\n(Note the $exitCode argument is passed by reference and inside the scriptblock its value is actually an instance of `PSReference<T>` with a Value property)\n. Whew, got carried away a bit... Sorry if some of that is too obvious ;-)\n. This reminded me of a problem I had encountered some time ago but forgot to report (#460). If `Update-SessionEnvironment` is new in 0.9.8.24 and is used in its chocolateyInstall.ps1, this is a similar issue.\n. Hmm, can't find any mention of it, neither on Github, nor on the mailing list.\nBug vs Enhancement: as Choco wiki [explicitly encourages using dependency on Chocolatey](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages#nuspec) as means to ensure the required functionality is present, a bug IMO.\n\nI could take a stab at implementing option 2) some time next week and see if it fixes this issue and possibly #459. Not a bullet-proof solution, but perhaps good enough, and with C#-Choco around the corner it seems unfeasible to put much work into PS-Choco.\n. Whew, talk about big guns and/or a cure worse than the disease ;-) But leaving personal opinions aside...\n\nThe extraction helper, Get-ChocolateyUnzip, already supports many formats other than zip (full list: 7z, lzma, cab, zip, gzip, bzip2, Z and tar), despite its name, thanks to 7za.exe being used under the cover.\n\nThe installation helper, Install-ChocolateyZipPackage, unfortunately hardcodes the file extension to zip. This is not really harmful (only misleading), however, as 7za is able to determine the actual archive type even when the extension is wrong. Adding an archive type parameter to Install-ChocolateyZipPackage would be just a tiny change, but the helper should work with other archive types even now.\n\nThe most complicated case is naturally .tar.gz. There is currently no one-step solution, but a two-step one does exist and is not much more complicated. First download the archive and un-gzip it to a temporary location (using Install-ChocolateyZipPackage), then un-tar it to the final location (using Get-ChocolateyUnzip). Here's a proof of concept using the first publicly downloadable .tar.gz that came into my mind:\n\n```\nInstall-ChocolateyZipPackage -packagename gzip-src -url ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gzip/gzip-1.3.12.tar.gz -unzipLocation (Join-Path $env:chocolateyPackageFolder tmp)\nGet-ChocolateyUnzip -fileFullPath (Join-Path $env:chocolateyPackageFolder tmp\\gzip-srcInstall) -destination (Join-Path $env:chocolateyPackageFolder src)\n```\n\nOne just needs to keep in mind that Chocolatey names downloaded files <packageName>Install.zip and 7za strips the file extension when extracting a gzip archive, so the extracted tar file is named <packageName>Install (without extension).\n. Yes, I realize that. The good thing is, despite being unsupported, it works (with just a few little quirks) and is much more convenient to use from scripts.\nJust wanted to share my findings, perhaps they will come useful in the future.\n. Another nasty consequence: the USERNAME variable gets overwritten with \"SYSTEM\" (from Machine scope). This breaks code (including chocolateyInstall/Uninstall.ps1 scripts of second and subsequent packages if multiple are installed in one go) that uses $Env:USERNAME to determine the current user login.\n. There are at least two scenarios when this issue will bite even in supported usage (chocolatey.cmd):\n1) when installing a package with a dependency that needs installing as well: the dependency will be installed normally, but the dependent package will be installed in a crippled environment;\n2) when installing a bunch of packages at once, using packages.config: only the first package will be installed in the correct environment.\n\nAdd to the list of consequences the fact that PowerShell 4.0 dynamically adds two module locations to PSModulePath, so the following scenario fails:\n- package P depends on package M, where M installs a PowerShell module\n- the user invokes `choco install P`\n- powershell.exe prepends %UserProfile%\\Documents\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules and %ProgramFiles%\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules to PSModulePath\n- M is installed as a dependency and extracts a module to %ProgramFiles%\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules\\M\n- Update-SessionEnvironment is invoked and resets PSModulePath\n- while being installed, P attempts to load the module M, but it won't be found\n. Well, rebasing changes commit hashes, so they are different commits from Git's point of view. No matter, thanks for merging it!\n\nBy the way, it seems the merge resulted also in the _env.cmd stuff being pulled into stable, together with CreateNoWindow/nuget (i.e. commits from master that were not present in stable).\n. Should I retarget it to stable (and perhaps GH-479 as well)?\n. I've fixed this as part of GH-476. It is already merged, so it should be present in the next release.\n\nAs a side note, you're not supposed to put anything in System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\Modules, that directory is reserved for modules that are part of Windows. Please see the [Microsoft guidelines for installing PS modules](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd878350%28v=vs.85%29.aspx).\n. That's weird. Commits eaf8ab2 and 3ef2604 are shown here in the wrong order. 3ef2604 (\"setup tests: add simulated standard...\") should come first, just after ef5395e (\"Enable mocking Test-AdminRights...\"), then eaf8ab2 (\"setup tests: with admin rights...\"), then 6dfbc44 (\"when running...\"). [My source branch for this PR](https://github.com/jberezanski/chocolatey/commits/per-machine-install-v6) has them in the correct order.\na00ec70 and 05d3e22 are swapped too. What the...?\n. Thanks for the encouragement :)\n\nI've reimplemented admin rights mocking in a clean way and added an environment manipulation abstraction, together with mock implementation.\n\nAs an unplanned benefit, tests using those mocking facilities are now actually runnable as standard user - that gives additional security against making systemwide changes due to bugs or test interruption.\n\nRe your first question, for the record: no, this change will not trigger the UAC prompt. The actual, current process rights (I try to avoid the term 'privileges' as it has a [very specific meaning on Windows](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa379306%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)) are examined.\n. (I guess my earlier comment by e-mail didn't make it through...)\n\nHere's one (quite important) test improvement and the helper name change suggested earlier.\nSome of the commits could also be squashed for a more streamlined PR - let me know if you'd prefer that.\n. Squashed somewhat (primarily bugfixes and the earlier Test-AdminRights mocking attempt) and rebased on stable.\nOriginal commits available for reference [here](https://github.com/jberezanski/chocolatey/tree/per-machine-install-orig).\n. @ferventcoder Unfortunately, the unreliability is there, it just has an exceedingly small probability of happening. Please note that my test code _does_ call Unregister-Event, and I still got the occasional cases of std output/error not being captured in its entirety.\n\nThe cause can be found by analyzing the code of the Powershell eventing subsystem (inside System.Management.Automation, decompiled using e.g. ILSpy). In short, the event processing code transfers event invocations through the CLR thread pool in a fire and forget way, with no means of tracking unprocessed events or waiting for all of them to be processed. So, even if Unregister-Event wanted to ensure all events from the source being unregistered are processed (and it is not documented as doing so), it would have no means of fully achieving that goal.\n\nGrisly details follow:\nThe core of the eventing subsystem is the internal `PSLocalEventManager` class, where both registration and event dispatch take place.\nIt turns out, when registering an event subscription, a dynamic method is generated using ILGenerator (like I do in one of my methods in the test script, but the code generated by PSLocalEventManager.GenerateEventHandler() is much more complicated, as it needs to handle all possible delegate signatures). That method is then attached as a handler to the event. When the event is raised, the dynamic method code calls PSEventManager.GenerateEvent(string, object, object[], PSObject) which in turn delegates to PSLocalEventManager.ProcessNewEvent() with bool processSynchronously==false. That method defers actual processing of the event for later, by enqueueing a callback to ProcessNewEventImplementattion() on the CLR thread pool (ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem()). ProcessNewEventImplementattion() creates an EventAction object and inserts it in the queue of events awaiting the next processing cycle. The Powershell engine at certain times calls PSLocalEventManager.ProcessPendingActions(), which takes events from the queue and executes the actions registered for each one.\nNow, looking at UnsubscribeEvent() (called by Unregister-Event), it looks like it indeed tries to flush all events from the source being unregistered that are still _in the queue_. However, there is a certain (usually very short) point of time where the event is not yet in the queue, but exists as a work item queued on the thread pool. These unprocessed work items are not tracked and Unregister-Event ignores them.\n\nThe problem is very volatile and unpredictable (it requires the thread pool to lag a bit in processing the work items), I cannot reliably reproduce it on my system, but it happens from time to time (slightly more often on a cold system). I've added some more checks to my test code, designed to catch not only total lack of output (as before), but also failure to deliver one or more of the last lines of the output (a more common case).\n\nBack to Chocolatey, however:\nMy first observation is that **it is only necessary to read _one_ of the output streams asynchronously** to avoid the deadlock, the other one can be read using ReadToEnd() as before. As it is much more common for the nuget invocation to succeed, **I suggest reading the standard output stream synchronously** and only using an async technique for the standard error.\nSecond, Register-ObjectEvent could be used as a temporary solution. The unreliability happens rarely, so we should be good for a while (better not being able to display the error than a deadlock - waiting forever for nuget.exe). Meanwhile, **I will try to find some time to craft a generic Execute-Process function** that will use the best reliable output redirection technique possible on the framework Chocolatey is running on.\n. You created a wrapper function, not an alias. Please see [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5677136/how-to-export-powershell-module-aliases-with-a-module-manifest) for a few tips for creating and exporting aliases from PS modules.\n. Indeed, it seems in PowerShell 3+ they started using a job object in Start-Process -Wait (but not in Wait-Process). In PowerShell 2 Start-Process -Wait and Wait-Process used equivalent code.\n\n@avdv what OS are you running this on - Win7 or older, by any chance?\n. First, a slight correction: I wrote \"in PowerShell 3+ they started using a job object in Start-Process -Wait\", but, to be precise, I only examined PS 2 and 4 (what I have on my system). So I'm not sure about PS 3. Not that it matters much.\n\n> Is wait-process available in Posh v2?\n\n[Docs say](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh849813%28v=wps.620%29.aspx) \"Applies To: Windows PowerShell 2.0, Windows PowerShell 3.0\", the implemetation I examined was in a .NET 2.0 assembly (so PS 2). But wouldn't hurt to check on a pure PS 2.0 system.\n\n> Yes, I'm on Windows 7.\n\nWindows 8 brought a major improvement to job objects in that now they can be nested, so a process in a job can create another job itself. On earlier systems (e.g. 7), the attempt to create a job (to run a child process in, for example, as PS 4 does in Start-Process -Wait) would fail when the process was already part of one. Perhaps Start-Process -Wait does not cope well with the situation when it cannot create the job - the code seems to be written to handle it, but I don't have the time to debug and verify it. Powershell might be running in a job in various circumstances, such as when the application that starts it is itself in a job - e.g. due to Program Compatibility Assistant - or when that application wants to maintain control over PS - [as SCCM probably does](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/3ec5c7b5-4a36-4890-98c2-ae654993f173/powershell-script-startprocess-no-exitcode-when-run-in-sccm-tasksequence?forum=configmanagerapps). As I use Win 8.1, which has nested jobs, the issue did not have a chance of manifesting on my computer.\n\nI agree that using Wait-Process is a reasonable workaround, now that a probable explanation of the issue might be given. Although dropping the -Wait and adding a comment would add more clarity to the code.\n. > Hrrm, actually that function is only powershell 3.0.\n\nHuh?\n\n```\nD:\\>powershell -version 2 gcm wait-process\nCommandType     Name                                               ModuleName\n-----------     ----                                               ----------\nCmdlet          Wait-Process                                       Microsoft.PowerShell.Management\n```\n. Regardless of NuGet limitations, dot-files (i.e. files with empty name) can generally be a pain to work with, such as when \"show extensions for known file types\" is unchecked and the file is associated with a program, e.g. a text editor. Besides, they look definitely non-Windows.\nI'd suggest something like `shimlist.txt` for the name, with the ability to specify both directories and individual files.\n\nA cleaner solution would be to extend the nuspec schema, but I seem to recall NuGet not liking that...?\n. @gabisa:\n\n> IMO, the correct behavior for the update in this situation is: \n> \u2022if no same version detected - do nothing\n> \u2022if a higher version is detected: \u25e6run the uninstall for the old version - execute the chocolateyUninstall.ps1 script (if exists)\n> \u25e6run the install for the new version - execute the chocolateyInstall.ps1 script (if exists)\n\nI'm afraid that won't do in the general case.\n\nMost nontrivial programs create and keep some state that needs to be preserved when upgrading, but removed when uninstalling: configuration, log files etc. Simply running \"uninstall\" and \"install\", without any sort of cooperation between these two, would destroy that state.\n\nIn addition, an intelligent update (e.g. MSI) could only perform the adjustments necessary to bring the installed software up to the latest version, potentially reducing the time needed to perform the update and minimizing the disturbance to the system.\n\nTherefore, the scripts and installers need to be aware that they are invoked in an update scenario, so that they are able to act appropriately.\n\nI see two solutions:\n1) Introduce the \"chocolateyUpdate.ps1\" script mentioned in the title, which should be placed in the newer package (the newer version knows about older versions, but not the other way around). Chocolatey should call that script if it exists (and skip chocolateyUninstall.ps1 from the existing, older package), otherwise fall back to uninstall old + install new.\n2) Add parameter(s) to chocolateyInstall.ps1 and chocolateyUninstall.ps1 to make them aware that they are being called in an update scenario. (Not a fan of this one, because it would complicate those scripts.)\n. @ferventcoder:\n\n> And this  chocolateyUpdate.ps1  could call the older package's uninstall should the maintainer know the ramifications of this.\n\nPrecisely. The version and path to the package being upgraded could be passed to the update script as parameters, making it really easy.\n\n@rismoney: That would work, too. However, switching to the single file model brings with itself the challenge of reeducating package maintainers and possibly converting existing packages.\n. I don't understand all the anti-BOM advice.\n\nA BOM is a very big clue for the software that reads the file that the file is UTF-8. Without the BOM, the software needs to guess by examining the file contents - an inexact and error-prone process - or assume some default encoding. True, there are programs out there which have incomplete/broken UTF-8 implementation and choke on a BOM, but they are not relevant to Chocolatey. On the other hand, .NET I/O classes by default take advantage of the BOM to unambiguously (or, at least, with a very high degree of probability) detect the encoding of opened files, so all .NET programs (in particular, PowerShell and NuGet) are BOM-aware.\n\nAs a BOM is required for ps1 files (due to PowerShell not playing the guessing game) and not-required-but-sometimes-helpful-for-text-editors for nuspec files, an advice for package creators to always use a BOM would be simpler to follow and less error prone.\n. No fix is necessary, it works right now (0.9.8.27).\nhttps://chocolatey.org/packages/utf8-test\nhttps://github.com/jberezanski/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/utf8-test/utf8-test.nuspec (note: github web view will not show the BOM, even in Raw mode - you need to clone the repo if you wish to verify)\nThe package was built using `cpack` and pushed with `cpush`.\n. It does have when I'm logged in, does not when visiting the page anonymously. Probably because it has not been approved yet (not that I expect it to ever be).\n![utf8-test](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1577094/4801819/690def30-5e39-11e4-8970-c25f878e2cc2.png)\n. @Redsandro:\n\n> Are you sure you ignored all the 'rules'?\n\nI ignored one rule: \"Do not save your  *.nuspec  files with a Byte Order Mark (BOM)\". I followed the other ones.\n\n@ferventcoder:\n\n> When the advice went out we were on Nuget.exe 2.1 and we are using 2.8 now. That could be the difference.\n\nPossible. I found [this one reference from 2011](http://oldblog.davidebbo.com/2011/04/easy-way-to-publish-nuget-packages-with.html) to a NuGet bug with respect to BOM handling, but the bug had apparently been fixed immediately after being reported. Not sure what NuGet version number was that.\n\nMy test proves that current versions of NuGet and the Chocolatey gallery correctly handle nuspec files saved as UTF-8 with BOM. To sum it up, the technical requirements currently are:\n1) nuspec files: should be UTF-8, BOM is optional\n2) ps1 files: should be UTF-8, BOM is _mandatory_\n\nI therefore suggest the following change to the character encoding guidance:\nInstead of those three points\n\n```\n\u2022 Do not save your  *.nuspec  files with a Byte Order Mark (BOM). A  BOM  is neither required nor recommended for  UTF-8 , because it can lead to several issues.\n\u2022 PowerShell scripts need to be saved in UTF-8 with  BOM . PowerShell is ignoring the standards and needs a  BOM  in order to recognize scripts as  UTF-8 . Otherwise it processes non  ASCII  characters incorrectly.\n\u2022 Don\u2019t use the default Windows Editor. In addition to its lack of features, it can\u2019t even save  UTF-8  files without  BOM (...)\n```\n\nthis:\n\n```\n\u2022 DO save your *.nuspec files and PowerShell scripts (*.ps1) with a Byte Order Mark (BOM). It helps the tools parse non-ASCII characters correctly and is required by PowerShell.\n```\n. I think I like the [RPM versioning scheme](http://www.rpm.org/max-rpm/s1-intro-to-rpm-whats-in-package.html) best. The package version there consists of the full version number of packaged software, followed by a distinctly separated package revision number (an integer starting at 1). The third revision of openssl 1.0.1g would be named `openssl-1.0.1g-3`. That way the package can be fixed without artificially changing the packaged software version number, yet the system remains quite simple and does not present the user with two full-length, four-part version numbers.\n\nOne way to implement it on top of NuGet infrastructure could be perhaps to expose the packaged software version number to NuGet as the package version and keep the package revision as custom metadata used only by Chocolatey (and visible on the package details page in the gallery). For fixing a package, Chocolatey gallery should allow uploading a new package with the same NuGet-visible version number as the current one but increased revision. As a consequence, updating a package to fix/improve the install script would not prompt an update for users which already have that package installed - a good thing, IMO.\n\n(To elaborate on the last point, an example: I installed MS SQL 2012 from a package, working around a bug in its chocolateyInstall. After I notified the package owner, he fixed the script and released an updated package. Now that package shows in cver as an available update, but one I do not need or want to install, since I already have a working SQL Server installed by the previous package revision. If the package version exposed to NuGet was the exact version of packaged software, I would not be offered an update - correct, since I do not need it.)\n. In the Resharper case, I'd argue that major versions (with non-transferable licenses) should be released as different packages, e.g. resharper7 and resharper8.\n. Good point. But in that case, the burden of preventing an unwanted/potentially breaking update should ideally lie with the package author, not the user. I.e. the 7.x package should somehow indicate in its metadata that it should not be automatically updated to 8.0 or higher. (But this is more in the topic of #5.)\n. Another thing to consider is that creating a symlink is a privileged operation on Windows, so it would not work for regular users.\n. @mlt right, I forgot about hard links. Coincidentally, Windows itself uses them for similar purpose, creating links in system32 (and other places) to exes and dlls in WinSxS (the unmanaged assembly cache).\n\n@ferventcoder hard links are fully supported in xp/2003 (actually, even in 2000). The convenient command line tool `mklink` is only available in Vista+, however, so Chocolatey would need to ship its own simple binary exposing the `CreateHardLink` API.\n\nOh, and the logic should fall back to shims in cases when the hard link obviously cannot be used, e.g. $ChocolateyBinRoot is on a different drive than $ChocolateyInstall\\bin, or link creation fails (e.g. both variables seem to point to the same drive, but one or more of the directories is actually a NTFS junction pointing to a different drive or even a file share).\n. The new output formatting looks really nice, much more readable than current Chocolatey output. But the fact that it comes from the new binary implementation is even better news :)\n\nDo you plan on providing only an exe, or perhaps a PowerShell module as well? Personally, I find it very convenient to be able to invoke chocolatey.ps1 directly from a PS script without paying the overhead of spawning a new process. PS cmdlets could also return objects as their output, making processing that output in scripts much easier and more reliable.\n. In line 33, the `-match` operator returns a boolean value indicating whether the match succeeded or not. Because this value is neither assigned to a variable nor used in any other way, it becomes part of the function output.\n\nTo fix this, either:\n1) pipe the result to Out-Null: \n`$html -match \"(?ms)data-dl-url=['`\\`\"](.+?)['`\\`\" ]+data-nodlm-url\" | Out-Null`\nor, better, 2) actually check if the match succeeded: \n`if ($html -notmatch \"(?ms)data-dl-url=['`\\`\"](.+?)['`\\`\" ]+data-nodlm-url\") { throw \"Match failed\" }`\n. The \"sysnative\" special alias is not a feature of \"32-bit shells\" (or cmd.exe in particular), rather [it is provided by the WOW64 layer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa384187.aspx) and available to all 32-bit applications running on 64-bit Windows, PowerShell included.\nThere is no need to pay the cost of invoking an intermediate cmd.exe.\n. The wrapper uninstall issues are already fixed in the not-yet-released 0.9.8.24 (GH-418, GH-446, GH-480).\n. The current implementation of `Invoke-ChocolateyFunction` simply catches the exception and rethrows its message. This has no effect on control flow. (It is also, by the way, suboptimal behavior because it loses valuable information, such as the type of the exception; a `throw` statement without arguments would rethrow the exception without losing information. But that's another matter.)\n\nYour original implementation would indeed use the `exit` keyword to terminate running the entire script (and return an exit code). In my opinion internal functions should never make such decisions, as they have no knowledge about the context in which they were called. In such scenario Chocolatey had no chances of handling the error in any way or perform any rollback or cleanup actions. Indeed, a later commit by @ferventcoder (54716e03) disabled the mandatory exit because it interfered with the ability to continue installing subsequent packages if one package failed (ideally, that behavior should be controllable, but in any case the authority of deciding whether to stop execution is with `chocolatey.ps1`, not with a lower-level, internal command).\n\nHaving said that, you certainly have a point about returning an error code when something goes wrong. Powershell not doing that is actually a deficiency of powershell.exe when invoked with the `-file` argument (and documented in [about_Language_Keywords](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh847744.aspx)). I don't know how Powershell is invoked by Puppet, but in my automation scenario (a Jenkins deployment job) I worked around it by invoking Powershell with my script using the `-command` argument:\n\n```\npowershell.exe -command \"& myscript.ps1 args...\"\n```\n\nthis correctly returns a nonzero exit code if the script encounters an error. Please also note that some (\"non-terminating\") errors are subject to [$ErrorHandlingPreference](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh847796.aspx); I usually set it to \"Stop\" (most restrictive) immediately at the beginning of my scripts, so all errors behave like exceptions (e.g. transfer control to the nearest catch clause).\n. My point is, with an exit deep inside an internal function, there would be no way to implement that switch. Also, when an error is encountered during the installation, there is usually some cleanup to be performed, such as deleting the failed package from $Env:ChocolateyInstall\\lib.\n\nI also believe in failing early, but in a controllable fashion. I would not like it, for example, if fopen() called ExitProcess() if it failed to open the file.\n. Obsoleted by #446. Now that this works, I found a new issue concerning shimgen-generated exes - #449.\n. @ferventcoder currently Chocolatey cannot handle $binRoot set to C:\\, because the installation tracking feature (Write-FileUpdateLog) relies on being able to scan the entire directory hierarchy under $binRoot, which will almost certainly fail (no access to other users' profile directories, for instance).\n\nSo, without major code changes, a Chocolatey installation with $binRoot = C:\\ is a broken installation. Since the defective code that causes that is already out there, I would suggest implementing an automatic fix: treat C:\\ the same way as an unset $env:ChocolateyBinRoot and reset to the default (C:\\tools). That way users affected by this issue could get it fixed simply by upgrading Chocolatey.\n. How about renaming Get-ChecksumValid to Test-Checksum (or Test-FileChecksum)? It would be more consistent with Powershell cmdlet naming conventions and standard cmdlets, such as Test-Path, Test-Certificate or Test-Connection.\n\nOr is it too late for that change...?\n. How about verifying the checksum of the cached file as well (if the checksum is provided)? It would make it possible to automatically recover from corrupted downloads, when length matches but content does not. Currently such file will not be downloaded, but will fail the checksum test later.\n. Yes, I've seen that line (that's what I meant by \"the checksum test later\"). However, in the scenario I'm thinking about, it would be too late. Please consider the following sequence of events:\n1. the user invokes `cinst foo`\n2. chocolateyInstall.ps1 of the foo package invokes `Get-ChocolateyWebFile` to download http://unreliablehost.com/foo.zip\n3. foo.zip does not exist in the cache, so the [condition at L85](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/helpers/functions/Get-ChocolateyWebFile.ps1#L85) fails at `$fi.Exists`\n4. foo.zip is downloaded, but due to unreliable server/network connection/whatever ends up corrupted\n5. the [checksum test at L126](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/helpers/functions/Get-ChocolateyWebFile.ps1#L126) catches the corruption and raises an error\n6. installation fails\n7. the user invokes `cinst foo` again, hoping this time the file will be downloaded correctly\n8. chocolateyInstall.ps1 of the foo package invokes `Get-ChocolateyWebFile` to download http://unreliablehost.com/foo.zip\n9. foo.zip exists in the cache and has the expected size, so the [condition at L85](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/helpers/functions/Get-ChocolateyWebFile.ps1#L85) passes and $needsDownload is set to $false\n10. **foo.zip is not downloaded again and remains corrupted**\n11. the [checksum test at L126](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/helpers/functions/Get-ChocolateyWebFile.ps1#L126) catches the corruption and raises an error\n12. installation fails\n\nI propose modifying [L85](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/src/helpers/functions/Get-ChocolateyWebFile.ps1#L85) to:\n\n``` powershell\nif ($fi.Exists -and ($fi.Length -eq $headers[\"Content-Length\"]) -and (Get-CheckSumValid -file $fi -checkSum $checksum -checksumType $checksumType))\n```\n\nThat change would result in failing the condition at step 9 above and redownloading the file, hopefully uncorrupted this time.\n\nWithout that change, the user would need to delete the cached file by hand (be familiar with cache directory location and layout etc) to fix the broken download.\n. I'd only suggest, instead of complicating things for the caller by using a ref parameter, to return a PSObject with two properties: [string/uri] Url and [bool] Redirected. Or, even simpler, return redirected url or $null if not redirected.\n. Nice. For the record, this should also fix those two bugs:\n- #418 (batch redirects not being removed when uninstalling a package)\n- https://groups.google.com/d/topic/chocolatey/vxad3EOdRSI/discussion (\"-source\" argument causing `cinst all` to fail with \"invalid URI format\")\n. Done as GH-480, since existing PRs apparently cannot be retargeted.\n\nShould all PRs be sent against stable by default? It would be helpful to mention it in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) if that's the case.\n. The guidelines did not specify a target branch, but here's a PR :)\n. A very welcome feature! But, why only when no UAC (i.e. why not trigger elevation)?\n. When testing, please be aware that [Windows caches manifest information for an executable](http://csi-windows.com/blog/all/27-csi-news-general/245-find-out-why-your-external-manifest-is-being-ignored) (including whether the manifest is present or not) for the duration of the logon session, so the external manifest may be ignored by the system until you logoff and logon again, if it has just been added and 7za.exe has been run earlier. To force invalidation of the cached information, change the \"last modified\" time of 7za.exe (the actual value does not matter as long as it is different than the previous time).\n. Yes, you just need to put it next to 7za.exe.\n. Good question. Each exe which might possibly write to a protected location should have a manifest. However, all other exes currently included with Chocolatey (shimgen.exe, checksum.exe, nuget.exe and even shimgen-generated exes in redirects directory) actually do have an embedded manifest with UAC info - you can quickly verify it with the sigcheck SysInternals tool (run sigcheck -m xyz.exe). So only 7za needs to be provided with an external one.\n. It should be. However, there are some gotchas.\n\nFirst, since Start-Process does not set the $LastExitCode PS variable, you need to use the -PassThru argument to Start-Process to receive a Process object, then check its ExitCode property, e.g.\n\n```\n$p = Start-Process $7zip (...) -PassThru\n$exitCode = $p.ExitCode\nswitch ($exitCode) {\n    0: { break }\n    1: { throw 'Some files could not be extracted' } # this one is returned for access denied errors\n    2: { throw '7-Zip encountered a fatal error while extracting the files' }\n    7: { throw '7-Zip command line error' }\n    8: { throw '7-Zip out of memory' }\n    255: { throw 'Extraction cancelled by the user' }\n    default: { throw \"7-Zip signalled an unknown error (code $exitCode)\" }\n}\n```\n\nUnfortunately, Write-FileUpdateLog complicates matters further, as it currently does not allow passing arguments to the scriptblock, so Get-ChocolateyUnzip constructs the scriptblock from strings (complex/messy). A slight modification to Write-FileUpdateLog would support that:\n\n```\nfunction Write-FileUpdateLog {\n  param (\n    [string] $logFilePath,\n    [string] $locationToMonitor,\n    [scriptblock] $scriptToRun,\n    [object[]] $argumentList\n  )\n  (...)\n  # instead of & $scriptToRun\n  Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock $scriptToRun -ArgumentList $argumentList\n  (...)\n}\n```\n\nThe scriptblock in Get-ChocolateyUnzip would be constructed so:\n\n```\n$unzipOps = { \n    param($7zip, $destination, $fileFullPath, [ref]$exitCodeRef)\n    $p = Start-Process $7zip (...) -PassThru\n    $exitCodeRef.Value = $p.ExitCode\n}\n$exitCode = -1\nWrite-FileUpdateLog -logFilePath $zipExtractLogFullPath -locationToMonitor $destination -scriptToRun $unzipOps -argumentList $7zip,$destination,$fileFullPath,([ref]$exitCode)\nswitch ($exitCode) {\n(...)\n```\n\n(Note the $exitCode argument is passed by reference and inside the scriptblock its value is actually an instance of `PSReference<T>` with a Value property)\n. Whew, got carried away a bit... Sorry if some of that is too obvious ;-)\n. This reminded me of a problem I had encountered some time ago but forgot to report (#460). If `Update-SessionEnvironment` is new in 0.9.8.24 and is used in its chocolateyInstall.ps1, this is a similar issue.\n. Hmm, can't find any mention of it, neither on Github, nor on the mailing list.\nBug vs Enhancement: as Choco wiki [explicitly encourages using dependency on Chocolatey](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages#nuspec) as means to ensure the required functionality is present, a bug IMO.\n\nI could take a stab at implementing option 2) some time next week and see if it fixes this issue and possibly #459. Not a bullet-proof solution, but perhaps good enough, and with C#-Choco around the corner it seems unfeasible to put much work into PS-Choco.\n. Whew, talk about big guns and/or a cure worse than the disease ;-) But leaving personal opinions aside...\n\nThe extraction helper, Get-ChocolateyUnzip, already supports many formats other than zip (full list: 7z, lzma, cab, zip, gzip, bzip2, Z and tar), despite its name, thanks to 7za.exe being used under the cover.\n\nThe installation helper, Install-ChocolateyZipPackage, unfortunately hardcodes the file extension to zip. This is not really harmful (only misleading), however, as 7za is able to determine the actual archive type even when the extension is wrong. Adding an archive type parameter to Install-ChocolateyZipPackage would be just a tiny change, but the helper should work with other archive types even now.\n\nThe most complicated case is naturally .tar.gz. There is currently no one-step solution, but a two-step one does exist and is not much more complicated. First download the archive and un-gzip it to a temporary location (using Install-ChocolateyZipPackage), then un-tar it to the final location (using Get-ChocolateyUnzip). Here's a proof of concept using the first publicly downloadable .tar.gz that came into my mind:\n\n```\nInstall-ChocolateyZipPackage -packagename gzip-src -url ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gzip/gzip-1.3.12.tar.gz -unzipLocation (Join-Path $env:chocolateyPackageFolder tmp)\nGet-ChocolateyUnzip -fileFullPath (Join-Path $env:chocolateyPackageFolder tmp\\gzip-srcInstall) -destination (Join-Path $env:chocolateyPackageFolder src)\n```\n\nOne just needs to keep in mind that Chocolatey names downloaded files <packageName>Install.zip and 7za strips the file extension when extracting a gzip archive, so the extracted tar file is named <packageName>Install (without extension).\n. Yes, I realize that. The good thing is, despite being unsupported, it works (with just a few little quirks) and is much more convenient to use from scripts.\nJust wanted to share my findings, perhaps they will come useful in the future.\n. Another nasty consequence: the USERNAME variable gets overwritten with \"SYSTEM\" (from Machine scope). This breaks code (including chocolateyInstall/Uninstall.ps1 scripts of second and subsequent packages if multiple are installed in one go) that uses $Env:USERNAME to determine the current user login.\n. There are at least two scenarios when this issue will bite even in supported usage (chocolatey.cmd):\n1) when installing a package with a dependency that needs installing as well: the dependency will be installed normally, but the dependent package will be installed in a crippled environment;\n2) when installing a bunch of packages at once, using packages.config: only the first package will be installed in the correct environment.\n\nAdd to the list of consequences the fact that PowerShell 4.0 dynamically adds two module locations to PSModulePath, so the following scenario fails:\n- package P depends on package M, where M installs a PowerShell module\n- the user invokes `choco install P`\n- powershell.exe prepends %UserProfile%\\Documents\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules and %ProgramFiles%\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules to PSModulePath\n- M is installed as a dependency and extracts a module to %ProgramFiles%\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules\\M\n- Update-SessionEnvironment is invoked and resets PSModulePath\n- while being installed, P attempts to load the module M, but it won't be found\n. Well, rebasing changes commit hashes, so they are different commits from Git's point of view. No matter, thanks for merging it!\n\nBy the way, it seems the merge resulted also in the _env.cmd stuff being pulled into stable, together with CreateNoWindow/nuget (i.e. commits from master that were not present in stable).\n. Should I retarget it to stable (and perhaps GH-479 as well)?\n. I've fixed this as part of GH-476. It is already merged, so it should be present in the next release.\n\nAs a side note, you're not supposed to put anything in System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\Modules, that directory is reserved for modules that are part of Windows. Please see the [Microsoft guidelines for installing PS modules](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd878350%28v=vs.85%29.aspx).\n. That's weird. Commits eaf8ab2 and 3ef2604 are shown here in the wrong order. 3ef2604 (\"setup tests: add simulated standard...\") should come first, just after ef5395e (\"Enable mocking Test-AdminRights...\"), then eaf8ab2 (\"setup tests: with admin rights...\"), then 6dfbc44 (\"when running...\"). [My source branch for this PR](https://github.com/jberezanski/chocolatey/commits/per-machine-install-v6) has them in the correct order.\na00ec70 and 05d3e22 are swapped too. What the...?\n. Thanks for the encouragement :)\n\nI've reimplemented admin rights mocking in a clean way and added an environment manipulation abstraction, together with mock implementation.\n\nAs an unplanned benefit, tests using those mocking facilities are now actually runnable as standard user - that gives additional security against making systemwide changes due to bugs or test interruption.\n\nRe your first question, for the record: no, this change will not trigger the UAC prompt. The actual, current process rights (I try to avoid the term 'privileges' as it has a [very specific meaning on Windows](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa379306%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)) are examined.\n. (I guess my earlier comment by e-mail didn't make it through...)\n\nHere's one (quite important) test improvement and the helper name change suggested earlier.\nSome of the commits could also be squashed for a more streamlined PR - let me know if you'd prefer that.\n. Squashed somewhat (primarily bugfixes and the earlier Test-AdminRights mocking attempt) and rebased on stable.\nOriginal commits available for reference [here](https://github.com/jberezanski/chocolatey/tree/per-machine-install-orig).\n. @ferventcoder Unfortunately, the unreliability is there, it just has an exceedingly small probability of happening. Please note that my test code _does_ call Unregister-Event, and I still got the occasional cases of std output/error not being captured in its entirety.\n\nThe cause can be found by analyzing the code of the Powershell eventing subsystem (inside System.Management.Automation, decompiled using e.g. ILSpy). In short, the event processing code transfers event invocations through the CLR thread pool in a fire and forget way, with no means of tracking unprocessed events or waiting for all of them to be processed. So, even if Unregister-Event wanted to ensure all events from the source being unregistered are processed (and it is not documented as doing so), it would have no means of fully achieving that goal.\n\nGrisly details follow:\nThe core of the eventing subsystem is the internal `PSLocalEventManager` class, where both registration and event dispatch take place.\nIt turns out, when registering an event subscription, a dynamic method is generated using ILGenerator (like I do in one of my methods in the test script, but the code generated by PSLocalEventManager.GenerateEventHandler() is much more complicated, as it needs to handle all possible delegate signatures). That method is then attached as a handler to the event. When the event is raised, the dynamic method code calls PSEventManager.GenerateEvent(string, object, object[], PSObject) which in turn delegates to PSLocalEventManager.ProcessNewEvent() with bool processSynchronously==false. That method defers actual processing of the event for later, by enqueueing a callback to ProcessNewEventImplementattion() on the CLR thread pool (ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem()). ProcessNewEventImplementattion() creates an EventAction object and inserts it in the queue of events awaiting the next processing cycle. The Powershell engine at certain times calls PSLocalEventManager.ProcessPendingActions(), which takes events from the queue and executes the actions registered for each one.\nNow, looking at UnsubscribeEvent() (called by Unregister-Event), it looks like it indeed tries to flush all events from the source being unregistered that are still _in the queue_. However, there is a certain (usually very short) point of time where the event is not yet in the queue, but exists as a work item queued on the thread pool. These unprocessed work items are not tracked and Unregister-Event ignores them.\n\nThe problem is very volatile and unpredictable (it requires the thread pool to lag a bit in processing the work items), I cannot reliably reproduce it on my system, but it happens from time to time (slightly more often on a cold system). I've added some more checks to my test code, designed to catch not only total lack of output (as before), but also failure to deliver one or more of the last lines of the output (a more common case).\n\nBack to Chocolatey, however:\nMy first observation is that **it is only necessary to read _one_ of the output streams asynchronously** to avoid the deadlock, the other one can be read using ReadToEnd() as before. As it is much more common for the nuget invocation to succeed, **I suggest reading the standard output stream synchronously** and only using an async technique for the standard error.\nSecond, Register-ObjectEvent could be used as a temporary solution. The unreliability happens rarely, so we should be good for a while (better not being able to display the error than a deadlock - waiting forever for nuget.exe). Meanwhile, **I will try to find some time to craft a generic Execute-Process function** that will use the best reliable output redirection technique possible on the framework Chocolatey is running on.\n. You created a wrapper function, not an alias. Please see [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5677136/how-to-export-powershell-module-aliases-with-a-module-manifest) for a few tips for creating and exporting aliases from PS modules.\n. Indeed, it seems in PowerShell 3+ they started using a job object in Start-Process -Wait (but not in Wait-Process). In PowerShell 2 Start-Process -Wait and Wait-Process used equivalent code.\n\n@avdv what OS are you running this on - Win7 or older, by any chance?\n. First, a slight correction: I wrote \"in PowerShell 3+ they started using a job object in Start-Process -Wait\", but, to be precise, I only examined PS 2 and 4 (what I have on my system). So I'm not sure about PS 3. Not that it matters much.\n\n> Is wait-process available in Posh v2?\n\n[Docs say](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh849813%28v=wps.620%29.aspx) \"Applies To: Windows PowerShell 2.0, Windows PowerShell 3.0\", the implemetation I examined was in a .NET 2.0 assembly (so PS 2). But wouldn't hurt to check on a pure PS 2.0 system.\n\n> Yes, I'm on Windows 7.\n\nWindows 8 brought a major improvement to job objects in that now they can be nested, so a process in a job can create another job itself. On earlier systems (e.g. 7), the attempt to create a job (to run a child process in, for example, as PS 4 does in Start-Process -Wait) would fail when the process was already part of one. Perhaps Start-Process -Wait does not cope well with the situation when it cannot create the job - the code seems to be written to handle it, but I don't have the time to debug and verify it. Powershell might be running in a job in various circumstances, such as when the application that starts it is itself in a job - e.g. due to Program Compatibility Assistant - or when that application wants to maintain control over PS - [as SCCM probably does](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/3ec5c7b5-4a36-4890-98c2-ae654993f173/powershell-script-startprocess-no-exitcode-when-run-in-sccm-tasksequence?forum=configmanagerapps). As I use Win 8.1, which has nested jobs, the issue did not have a chance of manifesting on my computer.\n\nI agree that using Wait-Process is a reasonable workaround, now that a probable explanation of the issue might be given. Although dropping the -Wait and adding a comment would add more clarity to the code.\n. > Hrrm, actually that function is only powershell 3.0.\n\nHuh?\n\n```\nD:\\>powershell -version 2 gcm wait-process\nCommandType     Name                                               ModuleName\n-----------     ----                                               ----------\nCmdlet          Wait-Process                                       Microsoft.PowerShell.Management\n```\n. Regardless of NuGet limitations, dot-files (i.e. files with empty name) can generally be a pain to work with, such as when \"show extensions for known file types\" is unchecked and the file is associated with a program, e.g. a text editor. Besides, they look definitely non-Windows.\nI'd suggest something like `shimlist.txt` for the name, with the ability to specify both directories and individual files.\n\nA cleaner solution would be to extend the nuspec schema, but I seem to recall NuGet not liking that...?\n.

The chocolatey gods have answered your request!\n\n#ok so chocolatey did the install.. now invoke $env:PSModulePath\nunchanged value\n```\n\nI'm just curious but why is chocolateyInstall.ps1 run in it's own session and not the session used to invoke cinst with?\n. I understand the problem; it just seems an approach could be taken which did not result in this limitation; i.e. not using a child session to perform the actual install. Where is the requirement for an entirely separate session coming from? just seems unnecessary/ convoluted\n. ",

Is the mailing list the same thing as the google group? I see the contributing.md mentions a mailing list but I can't find anything that says what the mailing list actually is.\n.

I noticed in the log you posted the user didn't have %ChocolateyBinRoot% set, whereas in mine, I have it set to C:\\tools. There's an issue in Get-BinRoot.ps1 that causes it to default to C:\\ if it isn't set, so I removed the value to see what would happen.\n\nFor some reason, it's trying to Get-ChildItem on just about everything, It looks like the command is Get-ChildItem -Recurse $locationToMonitor. That's failing becaue it doesn't have access to everything under C:.\n\n![capture](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4518572/2322990/6bdc87e0-a3b7-11e3-8b18-89f391316c8c.PNG)\n\nAnd finally:\n\n![capture](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4518572/2323009/a7f0b9c2-a3b7-11e3-8e97-9cf0ad2a9f42.PNG)\n\nSo I guess this is a side effect of #421. Since this package actually contains the Get-BinRoot.ps1 script directly, I suppose you could fix it by implementing my #421 fix directly in the package, so that it defaults to C:\\tools like it's supposed to, instead of C:.\n\nOf course, if someone has actually set %ChocolateyBinRoot% to C:\\ in their environment variables (or if a package with a bad Get-BinRoot.ps1, such as this one, has set the environment variable already from a previous install), then it's still going to fail.\n. In other words, fixing the script in the package will fix this problem for any users who have never run the buggy Get-BinRoot.ps1. For users have that have already run it, the environment variable will already be set to C:\\ (unless they've changed it), so this package will continue failing for them until either they change their bin root to something that makes sense, or until this installer quits trying to recurse every folder under the path.\n. @ferventcoder note that with the updated #421 fix, purposely setting the system drive root as the bin root is no longer possible. See the conversation here: https://github.com/bill-long/chocolatey/pull/1\n\nIf you did want to allow people to purposely set the system drive root as bin root, we need to back out @Redsandro's additions to #421 and take a different approach.\n. I'm not able to reproduce this. Works fine on Win 7 even with a space in the path:\n\n![1](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4518572/2504203/7a71e588-b38a-11e3-95a2-54f6af98e55f.PNG)\n![2](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4518572/2504206/8079d56c-b38a-11e3-98e8-035333db08a5.PNG)\n\nCan you post the exact errors you saw?\n.

Is the VM running 32-bit Windows by chance? I just took a quick look at the chocolateyInstall.ps1 for SublimeText3, and it might only work on 64-bit:\n\n![1](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4518572/2505825/0e2bc1fa-b39e-11e3-80c6-e4269c542964.PNG)\n\nDoes that environment variable exist on a 32-bit Windows install? I don't have a 32-bit VM to test at the moment, but if you are indeed running 32-bit, just go to Powershell and type:\n\n\"$env:ProgramFiles(x86)\"\n\n![2](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4518572/2505868/8477eb2c-b39e-11e3-9788-baaa545a9fb9.PNG)\n\nEdit: Yeah, according to TechNet, that environment variable does not exist on 32-bit Windows.

That's failing becaue it doesn't have access to everything under C:.\n\n![capture](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4518572/2322990/6bdc87e0-a3b7-11e3-8b18-89f391316c8c.PNG)\n\nAnd finally:\n\n![capture](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4518572/2323009/a7f0b9c2-a3b7-11e3-8e97-9cf0ad2a9f42.PNG)\n\nSo I guess this is a side effect of #421. Since this package actually contains the Get-BinRoot.ps1 script directly, I suppose you could fix it by implementing my #421 fix directly in the package, so that it defaults to C:\\tools like it's supposed to, instead of C:.\n\nOf course, if someone has actually set %ChocolateyBinRoot% to C:\\ in their environment variables (or if a package with a bad Get-BinRoot.ps1, such as this one, has set the environment variable already from a previous install), then it's still going to fail.\n. In other words, fixing the script in the package will fix this problem for any users who have never run the buggy Get-BinRoot.ps1. For users have that have already run it, the environment variable will already be set to C:\\ (unless they've changed it), so this package will continue failing for them until either they change their bin root to something that makes sense, or until this installer quits trying to recurse every folder under the path.\n. @ferventcoder note that with the updated #421 fix, purposely setting the system drive root as the bin root is no longer possible. See the conversation here: https://github.com/bill-long/chocolatey/pull/1\n\nIf you did want to allow people to purposely set the system drive root as bin root, we need to back out @Redsandro's additions to #421 and take a different approach.\n. I'm not able to reproduce this. Works fine on Win 7 even with a space in the path:\n\n![1](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4518572/2504203/7a71e588-b38a-11e3-95a2-54f6af98e55f.PNG)\n![2](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4518572/2504206/8079d56c-b38a-11e3-98e8-035333db08a5.PNG)\n\nCan you post the exact errors you saw?\n. I noticed in my previous screenshots it was using the 8.3 name, so I disabled 8.3 naming, logged in as a new user with a space in the name, and it still works even without the 8.3 name:\n\n![3](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4518572/2504346/169ff6e2-b38c-11e3-86f2-e3ea32631651.PNG)\n. Is the VM running 32-bit Windows by chance? I just took a quick look at the chocolateyInstall.ps1 for SublimeText3, and it might only work on 64-bit:\n\n![1](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4518572/2505825/0e2bc1fa-b39e-11e3-80c6-e4269c542964.PNG)\n\nDoes that environment variable exist on a 32-bit Windows install? I don't have a 32-bit VM to test at the moment, but if you are indeed running 32-bit, just go to Powershell and type:\n\n\"$env:ProgramFiles(x86)\"\n\n![2](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4518572/2505868/8477eb2c-b39e-11e3-9788-baaa545a9fb9.PNG)\n\nEdit: Yeah, according to TechNet, that environment variable does not exist on 32-bit Windows. Also, when I nuked that environment variable on one of my 64-bit VMs, SublimeText3 began failing with the same error.\n. Ugh, wrong repo.\n. ",

I'm using Chef to deploy packages via chocolatey.\n\nI was able to reproduce this error by using add/remove programs to uninstall packages installed via the chocolatey framework.\n\nRemoving each packages folder from the c:\\ProgramData\\chcolatey\\lib folder allows chocolatey to reinstall. I suspect packages remaining in this folder is due to people using add/remove programs to uninstall applications rather than using chocolatey to uninstall it.\n\nc:> choco uninstall <package> deletes the folder from the libs directory and allows the application to be reinstalled without issue. I have tested this multiple times and works fine.\n\nBasically, if you use chocolatey to install a package, use it to remove/uninstall that package.\n\nI think this issue can be closed.\n.

At the moment the createServiceCommand needs to be a valid command. I have tried to add more options to this, but the destinction between the services I would like to create using the Install-ChocolateyService is too large, e.g. apacheds (NSSM + two options), dcm4chee (NSSM + 1 option), tomcatzip (native service.bat) and postgresqlzip (native service.bat). Should I add more examples regarding the creation of a service?\n. @ferventcoder Real live examples have been added\n. Could you specify the label? What does 0-triaging mean in this case? Does it mean that this feature will be dropped or implemented soon?\n. @gep13 Thank you for the explanation\n. If no port is specified the service will not be started as TRUE will be returned\n. The port is optional. E.g. PostgreSQL, DCM4CHEE, Tomcat, JBoss require that ports are available. The script installs a Windows service indeed.\n. Should `Install-ChocolateyService` be renamed to `Install-WindowsService`?\n. How to create the alias using powershell? Using `set-alias` in some file? `set-alias Install-ChocolateyArchivePackage path/to/Install-ChocolateyArchivePackage.ps1` or `function Install-ChocolateyArchivePackage { Install-ChocolateyArchivePackage }`?\n. alias has been created\n. Ok. I will check that Q&A. Thank you.\n. Putting `set-alias Install-ChocolateyArchivePackage Install-ChocolateyZipPackage` at the end of the file solves the issue. I will commit the change ASAP.\n. AKA created\n. @jberezanski Exporting the alias has been implemented as it became clear during testing that setting an alias was insufficient and exporting is required as well. Thank you for the advice.\n. Should a new pull request be created? GH-506 has been created for another feature.\n. Ok. Thank you for the explanation. This ticket could be closed.\n. @gep13 It seems that the Install-ChocolateyShortcut.ps1 does not reside in the \"C:\\Chocolatey\\chocolateyinstall\\functions\" path (0.9.27). Will this function become available in the next release of Chocolatey? Could this function prevent conflicts between executables of different packages, e.g. eclipse vs. eclipse android. \n\nWhen `Install-ChocolateyPinnedTaskBarItem` or `Install-ChocolateyDesktopLink` is used there is a conflict between eclipse.exe of both packages. \n\nDoes the Install-ChocolateyShortcut.ps1 support passing arrays instead of string, e.g. \n`Install-ChocolateyShortcut one.exe, two.exe` \ninstead of \n\n```\nInstall-ChocolateyShortcut one.exe \nInstall-ChocolateyShortcut two.exe\n```\n\n?\n. Could you indicate whether the IP 10.200.2.2 is correct? http://superuser.com/questions/794247/how-to-change-the-default-using-this-proxyserver-127-0-0-18888\n. 4.4.1 > 4.402, but according the https://chocolatey.org it is not\n. # chocolateyInstall.ps1\n\n```\n$packageName = '{{PackageName}}'\n$packageVersion = '{{PackageVersion}}'\n$32BitUrl = '{{DownloadUrl}}'\n$64BitUrl = '{{DownloadUrlx64}}'\n$extractionPath = \"c:\\Program Files\\Eclipse Foundation\\$packageVersion\"\n\nInstall-ChocolateyZipPackage \"$packageName\" \"$32BitUrl\" \"$extractionPath\" \"$64BitUrl\"\n```\n\nI was trying to overwrite the parameter $extractionPath while installing the package\n. This works. Thank you. \n\nWould it be possible to create a function or something? I would like to use this for multiple packages. Is it possible to include this function in InstallChocolatey.ps1. What is your opinion regarding this?\n\nIf the installDir is overwritten then an issue could occur if the package will be uninstalled as the uninstallChocolatey function contains the default installDirectory as defined in the installChocolatey\n. For example, when an installer is run in Windows it is possible to define a installDirectory that is registered in the registry. Once the uninstaller is run, the installDiretory will be found in the registry and the package will be removed from that directory.\n\nIn this situation the installDirectory is modified, but once the uninstallChocolatey,ps1 script runs the default installDirectory will be removed. Should the installDirectory be registered on the system somewhere to avoid this issue?\n. Closed as a solution has been found\n. https://github.com/030/chocolateyautomatic/blob/master/common/Uninstall-ChocolateyZipPackage030.ps1 reads the installationZip file and removes the directory. If a custom path had been chosen this is registered in the file and by reading it the package will be removed from the correct location\n. Closed as a solution has been found\n. If none of the Chocolatey scripts could help, a custom script could be made that can be included in nuspec\n\n```\n$packageName = '{{PackageName}}'\n. \"$PSScriptRoot\\Uninstall-ChocolateyZipPackage030.ps1\"\nUninstall-ChocolateyZipPackage030 \"$packageName\"\n```\n\ninclude the file in nuspec\n\n```\n<files>\n  <file src=\"..\\..\\..\\common\\Uninstall-ChocolateyZipPackage030.ps1\" target=\"tools\\Uninstall-ChocolateyZipPackage030.ps1\" />\n```\n. An issue has been created\n. Close as invalid as it seems to work for other packages.\n. An example to extract a tar.gz was found at http://superuser.com/questions/80019/how-can-i-unzip-a-tar-gz-in-one-step-using-7-zip. Including Cygwin as a dependency and subsequently extract the tar.gz using the following command: tar xvfz packageName.tar.gz -C c:/temp/helloworld extracts the package in a preferred directory\n. Thank you for the example. The tar.gz package has been extracted to the preferred directory.\n\n```\nInstall-ChocolateyZipPackage -packagename gzip-src -url \"$url\" -unzipLocation (Join-Path $env:chocolateyPackageFolder tmp)\nGet-ChocolateyUnzip -fileFullPath (Join-Path $env:chocolateyPackageFolder tmp\\gzip-srcInstall) -destination \"$installDir\"\n```\n. I would like to create an Install-ChocolateyTarPackage\n. Where does the Install-ChocolateyZipPackage.Test.ps1 reside? I cannot find it at tests/unit.

At the moment the createServiceCommand needs to be a valid command. I have tried to add more options to this, but the destinction between the services I would like to create using the Install-ChocolateyService is too large, e.g. apacheds (NSSM + two options), dcm4chee (NSSM + 1 option), tomcatzip (native service.bat) and postgresqlzip (native service.bat). Should I add more examples regarding the creation of a service?\n. @ferventcoder Real live examples have been added\n. Could you specify the label? What does 0-triaging mean in this case? Does it mean that this feature will be dropped or implemented soon?\n. @gep13 Thank you for the explanation\n. If no port is specified the service will not be started as TRUE will be returned\n. The port is optional. E.g. PostgreSQL, DCM4CHEE, Tomcat, JBoss require that ports are available. The script installs a Windows service indeed.\n. Should `Install-ChocolateyService` be renamed to `Install-WindowsService`?\n. How to create the alias using powershell? Using `set-alias` in some file? `set-alias Install-ChocolateyArchivePackage path/to/Install-ChocolateyArchivePackage.ps1` or `function Install-ChocolateyArchivePackage { Install-ChocolateyArchivePackage }`?\n. alias has been created\n. Ok. I will check that Q&A. Thank you.\n. Putting `set-alias Install-ChocolateyArchivePackage Install-ChocolateyZipPackage` at the end of the file solves the issue. I will commit the change ASAP.\n. AKA created\n. @jberezanski Exporting the alias has been implemented as it became clear during testing that setting an alias was insufficient and exporting is required as well. Thank you for the advice.\n. Should a new pull request be created? GH-506 has been created for another feature.\n. Ok. Thank you for the explanation. This ticket could be closed.\n. @gep13 It seems that the Install-ChocolateyShortcut.ps1 does not reside in the \"C:\\Chocolatey\\chocolateyinstall\\functions\" path (0.9.27). Will this function become available in the next release of Chocolatey? Could this function prevent conflicts between executables of different packages, e.g. eclipse vs. eclipse android. \n\nWhen `Install-ChocolateyPinnedTaskBarItem` or `Install-ChocolateyDesktopLink` is used there is a conflict between eclipse.exe of both packages. \n\nDoes the Install-ChocolateyShortcut.ps1 support passing arrays instead of string, e.g. \n`Install-ChocolateyShortcut one.exe, two.exe` \ninstead of \n\n```\nInstall-ChocolateyShortcut one.exe \nInstall-ChocolateyShortcut two.exe\n```\n\n?\n. Could you indicate whether the IP 10.200.2.2 is correct? http://superuser.com/questions/794247/how-to-change-the-default-using-this-proxyserver-127-0-0-18888\n. 4.4.1 > 4.402, but according the https://chocolatey.org it is not\n. # chocolateyInstall.ps1\n\n```\n$packageName = '{{PackageName}}'\n$packageVersion = '{{PackageVersion}}'\n$32BitUrl = '{{DownloadUrl}}'\n$64BitUrl = '{{DownloadUrlx64}}'\n$extractionPath = \"c:\\Program Files\\Eclipse Foundation\\$packageVersion\"\n\nInstall-ChocolateyZipPackage \"$packageName\" \"$32BitUrl\" \"$extractionPath\" \"$64BitUrl\"\n```\n\nI was trying to overwrite the parameter $extractionPath while installing the package\n. This works. Thank you. \n\nWould it be possible to create a function or something? I would like to use this for multiple packages. Is it possible to include this function in InstallChocolatey.ps1. What is your opinion regarding this?\n\nIf the installDir is overwritten then an issue could occur if the package will be uninstalled as the uninstallChocolatey function contains the default installDirectory as defined in the installChocolatey\n. For example, when an installer is run in Windows it is possible to define a installDirectory that is registered in the registry. Once the uninstaller is run, the installDiretory will be found in the registry and the package will be removed from that directory.\n\nIn this situation the installDirectory is modified, but once the uninstallChocolatey,ps1 script runs the default installDirectory will be removed. Should the installDirectory be registered on the system somewhere to avoid this issue?\n. Closed as a solution has been found\n. https://github.com/030/chocolateyautomatic/blob/master/common/Uninstall-ChocolateyZipPackage030.ps1 reads the installationZip file and removes the directory. If a custom path had been chosen this is registered in the file and by reading it the package will be removed from the correct location\n. Closed as a solution has been found\n. If none of the Chocolatey scripts could help, a custom script could be made that can be included in nuspec\n\n```\n$packageName = '{{PackageName}}'\n. \"$PSScriptRoot\\Uninstall-ChocolateyZipPackage030.ps1\"\nUninstall-ChocolateyZipPackage030 \"$packageName\"\n```\n\ninclude the file in nuspec\n\n```\n<files>\n  <file src=\"..\\..\\..\\common\\Uninstall-ChocolateyZipPackage030.ps1\" target=\"tools\\Uninstall-ChocolateyZipPackage030.ps1\" />\n```\n. An issue has been created\n. Close as invalid as it seems to work for other packages.\n. ",

I had it running fine for a few months before apache started to refuse to launch, so I decided to do a reinstall to see if something dumb was going on or there was some underlying issue that needed to be solved. I attempted to do the reinstall through chocolatey (previous install was before I started using chocolatey) and encountered this issue. I'll go download and install the standalone version to confirm it's not an XAMPP issue.  It'll take a hot minute, the internet here is slow and XAMPP is a slow install.\n. I'll go for 1.8.1, which isn't the latest version, just for consistency with what chocolatey is attempting to install.\n. XAMPP 1.8.1 installs fine, but the issue I was having that caused me to attempt reinstall persists (apache won't launch).\n. I solved the issue I was having with XAMPP, but chocolatey still cannot successfully install it.  The issue I was having was skype reserving port 80 and apache requiring port 80 to launch. If apache is started before skype, there are no issues.  If skype starts first, apache won't start.  Chocolatey cannot install XAMPP regardless of whether or not Skype is running.\n. Folder existed from a previous install of xampp.  I removed the previous xampp install because it was giving me issues and because I'm trying to move stuff over to chocolatey.  Folder was partially read only.  I deleted the folder and am currently re-attempting the install.\n. Throws the same error, with the exception of line 88 (DEBUG line with the date in it) being today instead of yesterday.\n. Perhaps, but I'd been having issues with other package not too long ago that I never really resolved. I can't recall any particular packages unfortunately.  I successfully installed speedfan via chocolatey yesterday, so it's not ALL packages.  I'm willing to try any ideas you have.\n. 0.9.8.27\n.

Right, I'm back in action after a long christmas break. Here are some first ideas.\n\nPersonally I'm not settled on anything yet, want to try out some other ideas, but please let me know your thoughts, it's your product after all.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1188186/5734347/1d6c3542-9bb4-11e4-87c1-c88c097e5e91.png)\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1188186/5734352/2b0822ba-9bb4-11e4-96d7-f9b21d4b7b8e.png)\n. @gep13 good point. it does look a little like the commodore logo.\n\nhere's a revised version.

I had a feeling it might be too stylized to be recognizable.\n\nSo another idea I've had was to take it a step further and make it look a lot more like a chocolate bar brand.\n\nSo the first thing I did was to hand-letter the name in a curvy, indulgent kind of style, not to far removed from brands like catbury.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1188186/5758218/9f0b9d58-9cc3-11e4-9ec8-e398b5f3d86e.png)\n\nAnd then I played around with some varieties in different colours and different sizes. I think that could work quite well:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1188186/5758375/67ed1f7a-9cc5-11e4-923c-b192e186ad66.png)\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1188186/5758380/78024426-9cc5-11e4-9378-649f8c0cc400.png)\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1188186/5758384/81b81702-9cc5-11e4-893c-a6b7cb8d9389.png)\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1188186/5758803/bd1f12de-9cc8-11e4-8859-9a9d23e9c92d.png)\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1188186/5758808/e0768122-9cc8-11e4-8d56-7a15b033ef1e.png)\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1188186/5758973/5978f040-9cca-11e4-8fc0-a17d20803a0c.png)\n. @rismoney thanks I didn't know that there are plans for chocolatey on other platforms.\n\nIn answer to your question. From my experience branding doesn't have to be literal in a sense that it depicts the thing that it stands for i.e. machine package managing. It can be metaphorical. In fact the name 'chocolatey' already does exactly that, it's a metaphor for packaging/wrapping/containing software.\n. @ferventcoder thanks for your extensive feedback, super helpful.\n\nSo firstly I should have been a little bit clearer. The big chocolate bar with wrapping isn't really a logo in the traditional sense that it works in all sizes. It's more like a treatment of the logo, an illustration.\n\nThe idea is that you can represent your brand in different ways as long as you keep some similarities that make it identifiable. Different versions for different purposes. A large one with more detail could be used for display purposes like the header of a homepage or an ad, or a tshirt, or something like that. \n\nAnd a smaller version would then be used for such things as favicons, app icons (like the gui) etc. I've included icons in my last post but here are another couple of treatments, in different sizes:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1188186/5761266/a62af68a-9cda-11e4-953f-0ff6804c5ad2.png)\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1188186/5761661/2303abbe-9cdd-11e4-8712-ce39359a40cf.png)\n. Excellent! Looking at it on my phone I guess I would need to improve the contrast of it\n\n> On 15 Jan 2015, at 19:42, Gary Ewan Park notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> I quite like this one:\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n.

Before I go there I'd like to nail the colour of the wrapping. Any suggestions? Also, any further comments on what I've done so far @ferventcoder? Take your time I probably won't get to it until next week, got to do some paid work hehe :)\n. also a decision on wether or not the colon behind the c is appropriate is called for. So far I count one vote for it and one against it. But ultimately I guess this should be the owners decision @ferventcoder.\n. @rismoney very kind words much appreciated thank you!\n\nJust so you know I didn't take any offence. Doing branding work for a couple of years really helped me learn to not be too attached to my own work. I appreciate the feedback that all of you have given, in fact I rely on it. Wether negative or positive, without feedback I'm flying blind.\n\nI think the small logo works with or without the colon, so although I sway towards the colon, I don't think it makes or breaks the graphic. \n\nThe thought behind the colon was that it adds a tiny bit of extra meaning to it. I liked the coincidence that the first letter of the product name is also the first windows drive letter. And a drive letter followed by a colon is significantly windows. I get a little sentimental when I see a `C:` it takes me back to launching [Decent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keS0Hts2LpQ) from my MSDOS on my first PC.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1188186/5776037/99daeb9e-9d82-11e4-8548-e8b9111f1acc.png)\n. thanks @AnneTheAgile. Very encouraging! \n\n@ferventcoder first regarding the colour choice,  number one below is using the chocolatey light brown. To quickly get some variety, I headed over to [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/explore) and searched for colour schemes related to chocolate. Then I picked some of them, the results are below. Personally, I think there are better ones than number 1 in there. What do you think?\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1188186/5838537/74d2a5da-a188-11e4-8d8b-bdef68c1a9e5.png)\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1188186/5838548/80a9daa4-a188-11e4-838f-bff415a0a6d1.png)\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1188186/5838577/a4374772-a188-11e4-9fac-d2490f6f3fa9.png)\n. Thanks guys! Personally I think both 6 and 8 are good choices.\n\nAlso @ferventcoder  here are the two side by side \n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1188186/5870833/5424f312-a2d5-11e4-9989-224dab260420.png)\n\nAnd here are some more variations on that icon-size, but with the packaging theme retained:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1188186/5870939/3225a53a-a2d6-11e4-8cc4-02b022ed0d27.png)\n. And here are the beginnings of an accompanying redesign of the website, in those two colour schemes. This is really only just kicking it off, there are so many paths to explore in that area as well. Of course as always feedback is welcome.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1188186/5873822/dc2b5dd0-a2fa-11e4-88af-1ab132311a34.png)\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1188186/5873831/eefb6982-a2fa-11e4-8d1b-380bd874580c.png)\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1188186/5874283/0acc5392-a300-11e4-8504-76bfa148185a.png)\n\n@ferventcoder If I'm going to far here at all let me know, also if you do want to discuss any of this outside of a github issue, feel free to ping me on skype or such, I'm julian[dot]krispel on skype\n\nOn a side note: I'm sick of the notion that mac apps always have better design, or that macs in general are much better for design. So one of my goals with this is to help reverse this trend a little.\n. colourscheme number `#8` it is then. And 1b with no colon and a white c! I'll make a final round up of the identity now. The goal is to have a zip file with all assets one could possibly need, on and offline. \n\n@ferventcoder All the better that the redoing of the website is already in motion. As you know, I'd like to contribute to that as well, so I'll continue to engage with the appropriate issue. I imagine that if you take care of the content I could just chime in with some CSS and html changes. If and when you feel comfortable working on this together, let me know :)\n. @ferventcoder awesome thanks!\n. Oh crap. Forgot about this. Will send tomorrow morning!\n\nOn Sat, May 16, 2015 at 8:54 PM, Rob Reynolds notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> Hi @juliankrispel https://github.com/juliankrispel - checking in.

Personally I think both 6 and 8 are good choices.\n\nAlso @ferventcoder  here are the two side by side \n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1188186/5870833/5424f312-a2d5-11e4-9989-224dab260420.png)\n\nAnd here are some more variations on that icon-size, but with the packaging theme retained:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1188186/5870939/3225a53a-a2d6-11e4-8cc4-02b022ed0d27.png)\n. And here are the beginnings of an accompanying redesign of the website, in those two colour schemes. This is really only just kicking it off, there are so many paths to explore in that area as well. Of course as always feedback is welcome.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1188186/5873822/dc2b5dd0-a2fa-11e4-88af-1ab132311a34.png)\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1188186/5873831/eefb6982-a2fa-11e4-8d1b-380bd874580c.png)\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1188186/5874283/0acc5392-a300-11e4-8504-76bfa148185a.png)\n\n@ferventcoder If I'm going to far here at all let me know, also if you do want to discuss any of this outside of a github issue, feel free to ping me on skype or such, I'm julian[dot]krispel on skype\n\nOn a side note: I'm sick of the notion that mac apps always have better design, or that macs in general are much better for design. So one of my goals with this is to help reverse this trend a little.\n. colourscheme number `#8` it is then. And 1b with no colon and a white c! I'll make a final round up of the identity now. The goal is to have a zip file with all assets one could possibly need, on and offline. \n\n@ferventcoder All the better that the redoing of the website is already in motion. As you know, I'd like to contribute to that as well, so I'll continue to engage with the appropriate issue. I imagine that if you take care of the content I could just chime in with some CSS and html changes. If and when you feel comfortable working on this together, let me know :)\n. @ferventcoder awesome thanks!\n. Oh crap. Forgot about this.

    "andulv": "Thanks for the feedback.\n\nI have read the contributors.md and totally understand that you might not accept this PR.\n\nI implemented this feature for own use. We are in the process of deploying Chocolatey against a private repository, and needed a way to enable clients to execute centrally administered scripts.\n\nWe will be rolling out this modified version of Chocolatey to our clients, but figured we would like to contribute our efforts upstreams.\n\nConsider this pull request as my first \"feature request\" for this feature. I will follow up on mailing list. :)\n\nIf the feature is accepted I can reimplement it in the new C# version. \n. Just filed a issue (#652) where I tried to explain this feature and why we see the need for it.\n\nI also posted to the mailing list (Google group). But my post just disappeared upon submit. Dont know if was session timeout or something, or if the group is moderated and the post will show up later? (I dont have much experience with Google groups).\n. @gep13 Thanks. Waiting for response. Hopefully others will agree with me, or someone comes up with a better way to achieve the same result.\n\nBTW: If you guys have read the use-case in the issue I filed, you have probably noticed that we are a potential fit for your business licenses. I also noticed that even though the Kickstarter is funded and closed, that you have sold very few of the larger business pledges.\n\nWould it be possible to go for one of these pledges even though the Kickstarter is closed? \n\nSend me an e-mail at anders@definit.no if you want to discuss it. \n. Credit card would be no problem for us, as long as we get at an invoice / receipt that specifies that we have paid for software/support or something similar. But we are a small three-person company so not much bureucracy needed.\n\nBut, guess we'll have to wait then. Judging from the amount of free support I have received today I believe we will manage without paid support for a while. :)\n\nAnyway, I think our use case might be a interesting niche for you. We support a lot of standalone desktop computers that are not on the same network or in a domain.\n\nThere exists tons of solutions for distributing / updating desktop applications and configurations, but all/most of them are based on network shares, login scripts, remote powershell or similar. \n\nJuding by the success of TeamViewer and similar software, there are quite a lof of small companies like us that support non-corporate-networked desktops.\n\nThe focus (and userbase) of Chocolatey today seems to be prosumers/developers for desktops and enterprise / developers on servers. Our use case is something of a mix between them. \n\nI.e. a business license that is valid only for internal use in one company, would probably be impossible for us and other similar shops. A license that allows us to deploy on customers computers would be needed.\n. I am aware that our exact use case is probably a bit off from typical Chocolatey usage. But I believe this feature also opens up for a lot of similar use-cases for example regarding server-management and maintenance.\n\nI can also see some possible use cases for ordinary public Chocolatey packages.\n\nConsider: CleanUp-TeamViewer.run - A package that removes all traces of all TV versions from your computer.\n\nThis would probably be useful to have as Chocolatey package.\n\nBut without special support for .run packages in Chocolatey, this package will be installed and show up in the list of Installed packages. Uninstalling makes no sense. (Some users will maybe even believe uninstallation will revert the cleanup done).\n. I am not quite sure how to interpret your reply.\n\nAs Chocolatey is today, it appears to me that \"running a package\" == installing something. I think that is also how most other users perceive it.\n\nThis appearance is augmented by the fact that all packages are kept track of, and can be uininstalled or upgraded. Especially the automatic update bite (cup all, possibly scheduled).\n\nIf it is your intention that chocolatey package != install something, I think that this feature (or something similar or better) is exactly what is needed. :)\n\nBTW: I updated the original issue-post with an additional point under 'Use case vs. existing Chocolatey features':\n..When a new script is published, all installed scripts (read: scripts that have been run atleast once) will ..be automatically rerun when we do cup all. (And if e.g. we publish a defrag script, it will be quite weird ..behaviour to have your disk defragged when you update your applications).\n. Configuratiion changes might be(by my definition) in a \"grey zone\" betweeen .run packages and ordinary packages.  \n\nIn some cases they might qualify for a .run package, but usually it is something you can apply/update/remove and then it is a normal package. And as you say, you want to keep track of it has been done.\n\nI have noticed the business use of Chocolatey. Most (other) business cases I have read about have very much been concerned with configuration and deployment to servers. Puppet and its like very seldom mentions client/desktop management.\n\nOne usage I had thought of is systeminfo scripts:\nchoco install ListDriveInfo.run - Lists all drives with available space.\nchoco install ListSqlServer.run - Lists all installed SQL Server instances, with all databases\n\nAnother is problemfixing:\nchoco install ResetCustomerDisplay.run - Sends commands to COM port that resets stuck display. This command will only be issued when the display actually is stuck. As soon as we have deployed a version of the POS Application that solves this problem (or replaced the brand of customer displays) we can retire this package.\n\nOr maintenance:\nchoco install DefragDatabase.run <-connectionstring>\n\nBut I see your arguments, and I am starting to get less than 110% convinced that this feature really is necessary.\n\nWe might be able to manage with \"Configuration packages\" and ordinary packages that installs sets of custom utils (which are then executed outside of Chocolatey).\n\nWe are starting deployment now. I will come back with actual real-word examples of situations where we see the need for .run scripts if/when we encounter them. :)\n. Thanks for the feedback.\n\nI have read the contributors.md and totally understand that you might not accept this PR.\n\nI implemented this feature for own use. We are in the process of deploying Chocolatey against a private repository, and needed a way to enable clients to execute centrally administered scripts.\n\nWe will be rolling out this modified version of Chocolatey to our clients, but figured we would like to contribute our efforts upstreams.\n\nConsider this pull request as my first \"feature request\" for this feature. I will follow up on mailing list. :)\n\nIf the feature is accepted I can reimplement it in the new C# version. \n. Just filed a issue (#652) where I tried to explain this feature and why we see the need for it.\n\nI also posted to the mailing list (Google group). But my post just disappeared upon submit. Dont know if was session timeout or something, or if the group is moderated and the post will show up later? (I dont have much experience with Google groups).\n. @gep13 Thanks. Waiting for response. Hopefully others will agree with me, or someone comes up with a better way to achieve the same result.\n\nBTW: If you guys have read the use-case in the issue I filed, you have probably noticed that we are a potential fit for your business licenses. I also noticed that even though the Kickstarter is funded and closed, that you have sold very few of the larger business pledges.\n\nWould it be possible to go for one of these pledges even though the Kickstarter is closed? \n\nSend me an e-mail at anders@definit.no if you want to discuss it. \n. Credit card would be no problem for us, as long as we get at an invoice / receipt that specifies that we have paid for software/support or something similar. But we are a small three-person company so not much bureucracy needed.\n\nBut, guess we'll have to wait then. Judging from the amount of free support I have received today I believe we will manage without paid support for a while. :)\n\nAnyway, I think our use case might be a interesting niche for you. We support a lot of standalone desktop computers that are not on the same network or in a domain.\n\nThere exists tons of solutions for distributing / updating desktop applications and configurations, but all/most of them are based on network shares, login scripts, remote powershell or similar. \n\nJuding by the success of TeamViewer and similar software, there are quite a lof of small companies like us that support non-corporate-networked desktops.\n\nThe focus (and userbase) of Chocolatey today seems to be prosumers/developers for desktops and enterprise / developers on servers. Our use case is something of a mix between them. \n\nI.e. a business license that is valid only for internal use in one company, would probably be impossible for us and other similar shops. A license that allows us to deploy on customers computers would be needed.\n. I am aware that our exact use case is probably a bit off from typical Chocolatey usage. But I believe this feature also opens up for a lot of similar use-cases for example regarding server-management and maintenance.\n\nI can also see some possible use cases for ordinary public Chocolatey packages.\n\nConsider: CleanUp-TeamViewer.run - A package that removes all traces of all TV versions from your computer.\n\nThis would probably be useful to have as Chocolatey package.\n\nBut without special support for .run packages in Chocolatey, this package will be installed and show up in the list of Installed packages. Uninstalling makes no sense. (Some users will maybe even believe uninstallation will revert the cleanup done).\n. I am not quite sure how to interpret your reply.\n\nAs Chocolatey is today, it appears to me that \"running a package\" == installing something. I think that is also how most other users perceive it.\n\nThis appearance is augmented by the fact that all packages are kept track of, and can be uininstalled or upgraded. Especially the automatic update bite (cup all, possibly scheduled).\n\nIf it is your intention that chocolatey package != install something, I think that this feature (or something similar or better) is exactly what is needed. :)\n\nBTW: I updated the original issue-post with an additional point under 'Use case vs. existing Chocolatey features':\n..When a new script is published, all installed scripts (read: scripts that have been run atleast once) will ..be automatically rerun when we do cup all. (And if e.g. we publish a defrag script, it will be quite weird ..behaviour to have your disk defragged when you update your applications).\n. Configuratiion changes might be(by my definition) in a \"grey zone\" betweeen .run packages and ordinary packages.  \n\nIn some cases they might qualify for a .run package, but usually it is something you can apply/update/remove and then it is a normal package. And as you say, you want to keep track of it has been done.\n\nI have noticed the business use of Chocolatey. Most (other) business cases I have read about have very much been concerned with configuration and deployment to servers. Puppet and its like very seldom mentions client/desktop management.\n\nOne usage I had thought of is systeminfo scripts:\nchoco install ListDriveInfo.run - Lists all drives with available space.\nchoco install ListSqlServer.run - Lists all installed SQL Server instances, with all databases\n\nAnother is problemfixing:\nchoco install ResetCustomerDisplay.run - Sends commands to COM port that resets stuck display. This command will only be issued when the display actually is stuck. As soon as we have deployed a version of the POS Application that solves this problem (or replaced the brand of customer displays) we can retire this package.\n\nOr maintenance:\nchoco install DefragDatabase.run <-connectionstring>\n\nBut I see your arguments, and I am starting to get less than 110% convinced that this feature really is necessary.\n\nWe might be able to manage with \"Configuration packages\" and ordinary packages that installs sets of custom utils (which are then executed outside of Chocolatey).\n\nWe are starting deployment now. I will come back with actual real-word examples of situations where we see the need for .run scripts if/when we encounter them. :)\n. ",
