    "markdalgleish": "Thanks for the pull request! I think this is a really good addition, something that I had actually thought about but I wasn't sure if anybody would use it but I guess I was wrong.\n\nJust a few points:\n- Looks like your revised pull request still has a bunch of whitespace changes...\n- Could you remove the changelog from the JS? Maybe add it to the readme instead. If you want to put your name in there, maybe add a contributors section at the bottom and note what you added. I don't want to make the license section any larger than it currently is inside the actual script.\n- Could you add this functionality for backgrounds too?\n\nOnce these issues have been fixed, I'll be more than happy to merge it in :)\n. Any development on this? :)\n. I'm closing the issue. Feel free to update your fork, make the suggested changes and submit another pull request.\n. I'm not sure I understand this pull request. If '_startAnimationLoop' returns early, then none of the parallax effects will work. Could you explain this further?\n. Yeah, a demo would really help.\n\nWhat you're doing is really interesting, but it sounds like this option, when enabled, would require you to rewrite portions of Stellar.js in your own code, correct? If that's the case, I don't think this would belong in the plugin... if I can have a look at your demo, maybe we can figure out a way to better integrate Stellar.js with other scrolling libraries.\n\nHaving an option that just disables the main animation loop would confuse people and be very difficult to explain in the documentation.\n. Wow, nice work! That's amazing. I love how it works so well on iPad too.\n\nI think what I might do is make an update that exposes the 'Plugin' prototype globally (as 'Stellar') so you can override functions without having to modify the plugin code directly. I'd rather you be able to monkey-patch it than be forced to change the code.\n\nThat way, in your case, you could override _startAnimationLoop with an empty function, and manually run '_repositionElements' on the instance. The instance of the plugin is already available via $(scrollingElem).data('plugin_stellar');\n\nOf course doing this would be considered unsupported as newer versions of Stellar.js could break any modifications.\n. Thanks for the pull request.\n\nAs much as I wish they were, background-position-x/y aren't standard properties: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9653685/is-background-position-x-background-position-y-a-standard-w3c-css-property. Any fix would have to use only 'background-position'.\n. I merged Malchata's pull request this morning so this issue should be fixed.\n. Hey Steven,\n\nElements align relative to the top position relative to the top of the browser window, so the top of the element is in a different spot at the end of the page depending on how tall your browser window is. This isn't an issue with Stellar.js, you just need to work within those constraints.\n\nAligning elements from the bottom rather than the top wouldn't work too well, you'd have the same issue you're having, except at the top of the page.\n\nHope that clears things up :)\n. I've had a bit of a look and there's a few of things you're doing which is throwing off the calculations.\n\n1) Any parallax element needs to have its height specified. The reason it changes when you reload the page is that you're catching the images at various stages of loading.\n\n2) You've got parallax elements with a 'top' value of '50%'. Stellar.js doesn't support percentage values because elements need to be adjusted up or down in pixels relative to their starting positions. Instead, try nesting elements inside other elements that are set to 'top: 50%'. I haven't tried it before so I'm not sure if it will work.\n\n3) You've got elements positioned with negative margins. This is something that I didn't have in mind originally, I only assumed that the margin would make the element larger, but your massive negative margins are making the elements' outer heights negative numbers. If you modify your page as per my previous point, you'll find that you shouldn't need negative margins.\n\nIf you update your site to reflect these and you're still having problems, feel free to file another more specific issue :)\n. @bensmithett @maloky I've pushed an update to the readme to clarify this requirement. Let me know if you think I could have explained it better.\n. All 'scrollProperty' options other than the default ('scroll') aren't designed to be run on 'window'. The 'transform' option assumes that the selected element is moving within the window, probably due to a scrolling library like iScroll or Zynga Scroller. The error you're getting is because you can't read CSS properties from the window.\n\nYou need to detect iOS and initialise Stellar.js differently depending on the platform and which scrolling library you use. How you handle that is up to you, and outside the scope of the plugin.\n. This has been fixed in v0.4.0.\n. `Position: fixed` is the best way to avoid clunky animations. I'm closing the issue for now, feel free to re-open it if you have more issues.\n. Fixed positioning is the only way to avoid the jitter on iOS, so maybe try calculating its position based on the position of the element you want to treat as its parent. You might just have to tweak your concept, or disable some effects on mobile if the overflow limitations are a deal breaker.\n. I'm not sure why this was closed without comments, but a negative \"data-stellar-ratio\" or \"data-stellar-background-ratio\" attribute should do the trick.\n. I've just pushed a fix to this bug.\n\nIn jQuery 1.8, if the viewport element doesn't have offsets (usually `window`), `$.fn.offset()` returns `undefined` instead of `null`. I've updated the logic to check for this case.\n. Thanks for the pull request, but I'm closing this as it's the sort of custom logic that goes beyond what Stellar.js is trying to do.\n. Would you be able to provide an example, using JSFiddle or something similar? If you can reproduce this for me, I'll re-open the issue.\n. If it works after a refresh, it's most likely that you haven't specified dimensions on image elements, since on first load Stellar.js doesn't know the size of the images.\n\nLet me know if that doesn't fix the problem and I'll re-open the issue.\n. The problem is that without fixed positioning, you're essentially pitting the browser's JavaScript speed against its rendering speed.\n\nEvery time you scroll, the browser is moving the element to where it would normally be, then Stellar.js is repositioning it backwards to an earlier position. In fast browsers like Chrome you might not notice it, whereas in slower browsers it is painfully obvious.\n\nThe two workarounds are:\n1. Use fixed positioning, which essentially detaches the element from being affected by scroll events; or\n2. Use a background image, since background images can be fixed.\n\nApart from that, there isn't much you can do about it. As far as I'm aware, whichever solution works for you would have to be a variant of those two workarounds.\n. I think this might be possible without any extra attributes, if we decide that a fixed element inside an element with `data-stellar-offset-parent=\"true\"` means that it should first be offset by its parent's offset. I'll try this out and see if it feels right.\n. I've forked your example to show how it should work: http://jsfiddle.net/CNarz/\n\nLet me know if you have any further issues.\n. It's possible, it just means your images have to be larger than their containing divs.\n\nDoes it show up when you scroll down, at least?\n. Oh, now I see what you're trying to do.\n\nThe background should stay put, it's the element that should be moving. I've updated the example to reflect this: http://jsfiddle.net/CNarz/1/\n. Also, as more of an artistic suggestion...\n\nOn the page you're working on, your left background is \"behind\" the main content, yet it's moving faster.\n\nIdeally, you should be using a parallax effect to simulate reality and/or tell a story. If it's behind the content, it should go slower. If it's in front of the content, it should go faster.\n\nThese rules should only be broken if the elements are supposed to be actually moving, e.g. helium balloons in the background rising up quickly as you scroll: http://themeforest.net/bundles/birthday2012\n\nIf you break these rules, the effect becomes jarring because the animation doesn't make sense to our simple monkey brains :)\n. Can you show me an example of what you have so far? Or put it on JSFiddle?\n\nGenerally, though, the solution would be to nest the animated element inside a parallax element.\n. I've just updated your example to fix the first problem of the black div disappearing: http://jsfiddle.net/vNMxp/6/\n\nBasically, resizing parallax elements is tricky as it messes with all the calculations. All I can really say is to try and experiment a bit with nesting elements.\n\nThis isn't really an issue with the plugin, so I'm closing the issue. Feel free to contact me directly if you need more help.\n. In v0.5 you can now turn on 'responsive' mode:\n\n``` js\n$.stellar({\n  responsive: true\n});\n```\n\nThis will cause Stellar.js to automatically re-initialise on window load/resize.\n. Hard for me to tell without seeing what you're working on. Can you show me an example?\n. I've looked into this, and I find this highly platform dependant. I'm on a Mac, and I find Chrome to be faster than Firefox, but Chrome and IE aren't as fast on my ageing Windows 7 PC.\n\nIn an upcoming release, which I've already begun working on, I'm focusing on improving performance across the board, so this issue should be solved relatively soon.\n. EDIT: I posted a link to a potential fix, but it doesn't seem to be working like it was yesterday. I'll get back to you.\n. I've just pushed an update to the fix. It's a little crude, but it works. Safari doesn't want to play nice for some reason, but Chrome and Firefox are working. I'll keep looking into a better fix, but let me know if it does the trick in the meantime.\n. Thanks :)\n. The parallax element is moving beyond the bottom of the page, effectively growing the page height and forcing the browser the readjust the scrollbar to accommodate it.\n\nYou need to set '#container' to have an `overflow` of `hidden`. I've created a demo for you on JSFiddle: [http://jsfiddle.net/KDUZy/](http://jsfiddle.net/KDUZy/) - hopefully that clears it up for you. If not, feel free to re-open the issue :)\n. @chris-wong I reproduced your issue on my machine, but it looks like it was a CSS issue. If you replace the `.mobile #wrapper` styles with the following, it should work:\n\n``` css\n.mobile #wrapper {\n  position: absolute;\n  top: 0;\n  bottom: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  right: 0;\n  height: 100%;\n}\n```\n\nFeel free to re-open the issue if you have any problems.\n\n@TechnotronicOz Using iScroll with a 'positionProperty' value of 'transform' can result in a very smooth parallax effect. The only thing that's flakey is support for parallax backgrounds because they aren't hardware accelerated.\n. Nice pickup, thanks for the pull request :)\n. Thanks for the suggestion. Generally, these modifications are outside the scope of a \"parallax\" framework.\n\nStellar.js is aiming to keep the API as simple while mimicking real-life parallax. In reality, as I'm sure you're aware, objects don't randomly stop and start moving as your viewpoint changes.\n\nYou may be more interested in a general-purpose scrolling animation library like [Superscrollorama](http://johnpolacek.github.com/superscrollorama/). Of course, because it is more powerful, it's more complicated for standard parallax effects.\n. It sounds like you're not disabling the axis you're using, e.g.:\n\n``` js\n$.stellar({\n  horizontalScrolling: false\n});\n```\n\nTry that and let me know how it goes :)\n. It sounds like tour best bet is the [jQuery Waypoints](http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/) plugin.\n\nGive it a try and let me know how you go :)\n. Positioning differences between page loads usually means you haven't specified image dimensions, either in the HTML or the CSS.\n\nCan you add a width and height value to all images and let me know how it goes?\n. In that case, do you have 'responsive' set to true?\n. Can I see what you're working on, or a JSFiddle example?\n. If you send an email to markdalgleish AT shortmail dot com, I'll get back to you.\n. Okay, great :)\n. Sorry, I haven't had a chance to look into this. Are you still having issues?\n. This would be great but I don't have a lot of time to look at this. Happy to accept a pull request, though.\n. I haven't tested with Opera, but this won't be a problem for long since they are moving to Blink.\n. Do you have a working example of the problem you're having?\n. Yeah, that would work. I've deliberately made Stellar.js completely unopinionated when it comes to device detection, so you may find that you have to tweak your solution depending on the platforms you're targeting.\n. It doesn't disable it, it just never initialises it.\n. Have you disabled the axis you're not using?\n\nFor example:\n\n``` js\n$.stellar({\n  horizontalScrolling: false\n});\n```\n. Can I see what you have so far?\n. Thanks for the pull request! The IE10 fix looks great, but I'm not sure why you're trying to fix the 'transform' adapter for IE8 when it doesn't support CSS transforms at all. Am I missing something?\n. I've had a quick look at your code, and it appears you're making a couple of mistakes:\n- You don't need to specify a position property adapter if you only have parallax backgrounds. The 'transform' adapter is written assuming that you have elements that it's acting on.\n- The 'transform' scroll property adapter is generally only for mobile scrolling libraries like iScroll, so the default value should be fine.\n\nAre you able to fix these so I can see the actual problem in isolation?\n. @ceehaupt Are you using the 'transform' scroll property adaper?\n. Then you shouldn't be getting the same error as the parent, right? Can I see what you have so far?\n. You should probably switch opacity to 0 and use a CSS transition. You'd get much better performance from this, too.\n. Very cool :)\n. Not currently, it requires multiple elements. Happy to accept a pull request if you can get this working.\n. Stellar.js positions everything relative to top/left. You could change this behaviour by writing a plugin, if you like.\n. Sorry, closing as this doesn't seem to be an issue with Stellar.js and I don't have the bandwidth to look at it in detail.\n. Do you have an example I can look at?\n. Sorry, closing as this isn't an issue with Stellar.js,\n. Closing as this doesn't seem to be an issue with Stellar.js. Something like StackOverflow would be a better place for a question like this.\n. Great work, thanks for showing me :)\n. The Stellar.js website is an example of horizontal parallax.\n. Maybe try manually refreshing all parallax elements with `$.stellar('refresh');`\n. If elements stop moving, it's no longer [parallax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax), but instead more general scrolling animation. Check out [Superscrollorama](http://johnpolacek.github.io/superscrollorama/) instead.\n. I don't have a lot of time to look into this, but I can say that you should look into [position property adapters](https://github.com/markdalgleish/stellar.js#configuring-scroll-positioning). They are designed to allow you to interface with different scrolling methods. The full list of adapters can be seen in the source code here: https://github.com/markdalgleish/stellar.js/blob/master/src/jquery.stellar.js#L20-L44\n. I've updated your fiddle to show how it works: http://jsfiddle.net/YsJ6Q/2/\n\nFeel free to re-open this issue if this doesn't solve your problem.\n. Thank you! :)\n. This is why I prefer a separate publish step like npm ;)\n\nThis fix will go out in the next release. I currently don't have anything planned so I might need to find a reason to bump the version number.\n. Thanks for the pull request. Would you be able to write tests for this?\n. Could you please provide some details about the changes you've made in this pull request?\n. I'm open to this idea, but finding collaborators can definitely be tricky.\n\nIf you're keen to be a contributor, comment below with a link to one of your projects.\n. Thanks!\n. I don't maintain this project anymore. You can install from GitHub with `npm install --save markdalgleish/stellar.js#v0.6.2`.\n. Thanks for the pull request! I think this is a really good addition, something that I had actually thought about but I wasn't sure if anybody would use it but I guess I was wrong.\n\nJust a few points:\n- Looks like your revised pull request still has a bunch of whitespace changes...\n- Could you remove the changelog from the JS? Maybe add it to the readme instead. If you want to put your name in there, maybe add a contributors section at the bottom and note what you added.

It doesn't disable it, it just never initialises it.\n. Have you disabled the axis you're not using?\n\nFor example:\n\n``` js\n$.stellar({\n  horizontalScrolling: false\n});\n```\n. Can I see what you have so far?\n. Thanks for the pull request! The IE10 fix looks great, but I'm not sure why you're trying to fix the 'transform' adapter for IE8 when it doesn't support CSS transforms at all. Am I missing something?\n. I've had a quick look at your code, and it appears you're making a couple of mistakes:\n- You don't need to specify a position property adapter if you only have parallax backgrounds. The 'transform' adapter is written assuming that you have elements that it's acting on.\n- The 'transform' scroll property adapter is generally only for mobile scrolling libraries like iScroll, so the default value should be fine.\n\nAre you able to fix these so I can see the actual problem in isolation?\n. @ceehaupt Are you using the 'transform' scroll property adaper?\n. Then you shouldn't be getting the same error as the parent, right? Can I see what you have so far?\n. You should probably switch opacity to 0 and use a CSS transition. You'd get much better performance from this, too.\n. Very cool :)\n. Not currently, it requires multiple elements. Happy to accept a pull request if you can get this working.\n. Stellar.js positions everything relative to top/left. You could change this behaviour by writing a plugin, if you like.\n. Sorry, closing as this doesn't seem to be an issue with Stellar.js and I don't have the bandwidth to look at it in detail.\n. Do you have an example I can look at?\n. Sorry, closing as this isn't an issue with Stellar.js,\n. Closing as this doesn't seem to be an issue with Stellar.js. Something like StackOverflow would be a better place for a question like this.\n. Great work, thanks for showing me :)\n. The Stellar.js website is an example of horizontal parallax.\n. Maybe try manually refreshing all parallax elements with `$.stellar('refresh');`\n. If elements stop moving, it's no longer [parallax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax), but instead more general scrolling animation. Check out [Superscrollorama](http://johnpolacek.github.io/superscrollorama/) instead.\n. I don't have a lot of time to look into this, but I can say that you should look into [position property adapters](https://github.com/markdalgleish/stellar.js#configuring-scroll-positioning). They are designed to allow you to interface with different scrolling methods. The full list of adapters can be seen in the source code here: https://github.com/markdalgleish/stellar.js/blob/master/src/jquery.stellar.js#L20-L44\n. I've updated your fiddle to show how it works: http://jsfiddle.net/YsJ6Q/2/\n\nFeel free to re-open this issue if this doesn't solve your problem.\n. Thank you! :)\n. This is why I prefer a separate publish step like npm ;)\n\nThis fix will go out in the next release. I currently don't have anything planned so I might need to find a reason to bump the version number.\n. Thanks for the pull request. Would you be able to write tests for this?\n. Could you please provide some details about the changes you've made in this pull request?\n. I'm open to this idea, but finding collaborators can definitely be tricky.\n\nIf you're keen to be a contributor, comment below with a link to one of your projects.\n. Thanks!\n. I don't maintain this project anymore. You can install from GitHub with `npm install --save markdalgleish/stellar.js#v0.6.2`.\n. ",

When using superscollama with duration ( animation based on the scroll position of the page ) on my page , the parallax elements that even not using superscrollama and just stellar ratio , appears sooo much more jittery ( or flickering ).\nI don't know why is that. If this is because of the heavy calculations when I set the duration or something else. But Firefox has no problem and every things goes very smooth.\n\nIssue 4\nThere is one solution this beside using fixed positioning. And that is to use background images instead of image and div element directly. Because the browser it self doesn't try to reposition the background image when scrolling ( as mentioned in Issue 1 ). All you have to do is set div to 100% width and height , and change the background size and position.\nThere is a small problem to this solution too.

However, I need to programmatically add the offset to the element prior to rendering by stellar. What's the best way to achieve that, since the calculation has to happen after ready, but before stellar calculates the proper offset?\n. ",
