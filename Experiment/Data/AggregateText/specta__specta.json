They should apply to nested specs too. Could you check again?\n. thanks!\n. Oops I thought I've already merged this\n. thanks!\n. did you have `it` blocks when you were declaring shared examples?\n\n```\nsharedExamplesFor(@\"a shared behavior\", ^(NSDictionary *data) {\n  it(@\"should do some stuff\", ^{\n    // ...\n  });\n});\n```\n. @drouchy can you show me your spec code?\n. @drouchy I see, that is because `project.services`, and `delegate` are evaluated immediately, not when the `it` block is evaluated. I am pushing a fix now.\n. @drouchy, Try Specta v0.1.6 and make a slight modification to your spec like so:\n\n``` objective-c\ndescribe(@\"outlineView:isGroupItem: & outlineView:shouldSelectItem\", ^{\n  __block Project *project ;\n  __block ApiProjectOulineViewDelegate *delegate ;\n\n  beforeEach(^{\n    project = [[Project alloc] init] ;\n    delegate = [[ ApiProjectOulineViewDelegate alloc] init] ;\n  }) ;\n\n  describe(@\"the services\", ^{\n    itShouldBehaveLike(@\"a group item\", ^{\n      return @{  @\"item\": project.services,\n                 @\"delegate\": delegate,\n                 @\"isGroupItem\": [NSNumber numberWithBool:YES]  } ; \n    }) ;\n  }) ;\n}) ;\n```\n. @drouchy The second spec without the use of block should still be executing. What's probably happening is that `delegate` and `isGroupItem` are nil since they are evaluated immediately, so it essentially ends up doing `expect(nil).to.equal(nil)`..., which passes. perhaps add some assertion to check nullity?\n. I am unable to reproduce this, you have to put breakpoints within `it` blocks in `sharedExamplesFor`. Could you add some `NSLog`s to the `it` blocks and see if it can print text?\n. @drouchy If possible, could you send me the spec and sharedexample.m files (private gist)?\n. @drouchy ocunit does that. I will see if I can do anything about it.\n. agreed. will look into this and #14 asap\n. implemented in v0.1.7\n. thanks! also made it such that you don't need `it_`, specta will inspect block's signature.\n\nbeforeEach/all/after etc also accept async blocks.\n. thanks!\n. I will take a look at the commits as soon as I get some free time, thanks!\n. merged\n. hmm this is odd... are you using ARC?\n. yep it is. let me investigate this \n. what is your deployment target? what's the version of the base sdk? @thalmicMark  @ianmurrays \n. could you check that you are using clang compiler? (Apple LLVM compiler)\n. Does it say LLVM GCC 4.2 or Apple LLVM compiler 4.2 (Clang)?\n. ![screen shot 2013-07-18 at 12 14 57 am](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/30173/817618/c9414b84-ef79-11e2-9e8b-465d43b24992.png)\n\nCould you make sure that you are using Apple LLVM compiler and try again?\n\n@ianmurrays @thalmicMark\n. @thalmicMark is it possible to share your repo? I am unable to reproduce :(\n. @vtsatskin It's really difficult to debug this because I am unable to reproduce this issue. Could you check that you are using clang (apple llvm compiler) and provide a failing test case if possible?\n. @thalmicMark, it's super odd, 'cause all the test cases pass and work fine on xcode 5-dp5. if you could provide a failing test case, it would be tremendously helpful.\n. @thalmicMark or if you could extract the part that is crashing as a separate project without the rest of the stuff, that will be helpful too\n. @thalmicMark hmm the tests run fine for me. \n![screen shot 2013-08-07 at 1 36 22 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/30173/927475/09740e76-ffa1-11e2-9365-871e348127a4.png)\n. @thalmicMark, i checked your repo. To make your tests run, change the \"wrapper extension\" under build settings from \"xctest\" to \"octest\".\n\nPlease do `xcode-select -print-path` and make sure that the correct XCode version you are trying to use is selected, before compiling the static library. If it isn't, please switch to the correct XCode path:\n\n`sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode5-DP5.app`\n\nand then recompile the static library, it should then run without crashing.\n\nSee https://github.com/thalmicMark/SpectaAsyncTest/pull/1\n. @ianmurrays @vtsatskin are you still experiencing problems?\n. @ianmurrays There shouldn't be any problem using it with Cocoapods though - i use it with Cocoapod for all of my projects. This problem seems to occur if your project and specta were compiled using different compiler versions.\n. @thalmicMark can you confirm that the problem you were experiencing is resolved?\n. Is this still an issue with v0.2?\n. merged/fixed, thanks!\n. I couldn't reproduce this, could you provide a failing spec?\n. merged, thanks!\n. merged a6518614658e3b3648a5d0dd0402e615b2170d02\n. could you give an example of when this is needed? \n. tests should always be wrapped within \"it\" blocks. is this for assertions made outside \"it\" blocks?\n. thanks!\n. thanks!\n. @wonga00 could you confirm that it did fix the issue for you?\n. thanks\n. merged, thanks!\n. thanks. fixed.\n. Please see:\nhttps://github.com/mpdifran/PodsTest/pull/1\n\nrun `pod install` after cloning.\n\n``` ruby\ntarget 'PodsTestTests' do\n  pod 'Specta',      '~> 0.1.9'\n  pod 'Expecta',     '~> 0.2.1'\n  pod 'OCMock',      '~> 2.2'\nend\ntarget 'StaticLibTestTests' do\n  pod 'Specta',      '~> 0.1.9'\n  pod 'Expecta',     '~> 0.2.1'\n  pod 'OCMock',      '~> 2.2'\nend\n```\n. Maybe @nerdyc's +beforeEach and +afterEach do what you need?\n. how did you setup specta and expecta? do you have -ObjC in your linker flags?\n. if they are setup as cocoapods then it should just work. it's weird. are you able to share your project by any chance?\n. Alright I guess the consensus is to dump sentestingkit support and move to xctest in v0.2 will start working on it asap.\n. Thanks, that is definitely useful, my goal is to ship v0.2 with xctest+arc by the end of this week.\n. @tonyarnold maybe you could help with #46 if you are free, I will look at and finish the xctest stuff this weekend\n. @tonyarnold added you to the org. you can create a branch and commit to the main repo\n. @nerdyc @jkrall @blakewatters @mgrimes @Ahti @AshFurrow @tonyarnold @gfontenot @Abizern @tibr @mickeyreiss @jspahrsummers  @bainfu \n\nFinished XCTest integration: https://github.com/specta/specta/tree/xctest\n\nAll specs pass, but I had to temporarily remove custom reporter support. Will add that back in later.\n\nCould you please help test it with your existing projects? We'll ship it if everything seems ok.\n. @mickeyreiss @robb that's because i removed custom reporter support for now. will add that back in 2.0.1 release probably @nerdyc\n. With Specta v0.2.x, you can set `SPECTA_REPORTER_CLASS` env var to `SPTXCTestReporter` in your test scheme to use original XCTest reporter.\n. Yes that is correct, 64-bit only for OS X, and both 32 and 64-bit for iOS\nCorrect me if I am wrong, but AFAIK all of the above should be supported by iOS 6+ / OSX 10.7+?\n. @jspahrsummers What do you think? Maybe we can have the same deployment target as GitHub's open source libraries.\n. I am seeing it too with Xcode 5.0.1/OS X 10.9, this is not expected, I haven't investigated \n. Are you able to run iOS tests without crashing xcode 5? @robb @jspahrsummers @tonyarnold \n. Specta's iOS tests.\n. @tonyarnold, could you try this on your XCode 5, please:\n\nNew -> Project -> iOS -> Framwork & Library -> Cocoa Touch Static Library\n\nPick any of the iOS Simulators -> Product -> Test\n. Was that with xcode 5.01 on Mavericks? @tonyarnold \n. I realized I was running GM versions of Mavericks and Xcode, that happened to be different from actual App Store builds. Downloading and installing them now.\n. merged\n. i guess WIP branch is fine\n. @nerdyc that's a good idea, maybe we can have a separate branch for v0.1.x\n. Does running a single example or a spec in the test navigator work fine for you as well?\n. @mgrimes @bainfu Does it work if you remove that line? Also make sure that \"Wrapper Extension\" is set to \"xctest\" in your test targets..\n. @mgrimes How is Specta added to your project?\n. I am rebuilding the xcode project file, just to give it a shot\n. I've rebuilt the xcode project from scratch, starting with iOS project then adding OSX target. Starting with OSX project and adding iOS target seems to cause this issue... regardless of the deployment target settings.\n. @mgrimes @bainfu try the new commit, and also quit Xcode, run: `rm -rf $HOME/Library/Caches/com.apple.dt.Xcode $HOME/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData` and then restart Xcode\n. Things seem stable, will release it as soon as I get home tonight\n. :smiley:\n. Is this still needed in master?\n. can you try specta 0.2.0?\n. thanks, merged in 0.3-wip branch!\n. merged in 0.3-wip branch. thanks!\n. Xcode 6 support is being worked on in \"https://github.com/specta/specta/tree/0.3-wip\" branch.\n. I am trying to fix this, but I can't seem to get Specta to compile under Xcode6 beta. I am getting lots of \"Expected expression\" errors on `SPTAssert*` macros... Any idea?\n. Looks like commenting the following lines in SpectaSupport.h\n\n```\n#undef _XCTRegisterFailure\n#define _XCTRegisterFailure(condition, format...) \\\n({ \\\n_XCTFailureHandler((id)self, YES, __FILE__, __LINE__, condition, @\"\" format); \\\n})\n```\n\ngets it to compile, but exception handling for async tests seems to be broken. \n\nrelated: #83\n. I might have to remove support for previous versions of SDK/Xcode (< 6) in v0.3. How do you guys feel about this? I am assuming most people compile code against latest SDK with deployment target set to lower versions. @tonyarnold @jspahrsummers @robb @nskboy\n. Should Specta 0.3 for iOS be released as a framework or static library?\n\n@nskboy @tonyarnold @robb \n. Swift support requires the library to be packaged as a framework. However, you lose support for iOS < 8.0. I am moving the Swift bit to a separate add-on framework though, so I might be able to get away with the framework requirement.\n. Ok. will add this in 0.3\n. will definitely add this to the todo list for 0.3\n. implemented in bcba04d57fd05ce1a7ce110d998d8363053da0ef\n. this is gone in 0.3 (see 0.3-wip branch)\n. This will be fixed in 0.3. I am trying to release 0.3 beta some time next week, but every new build of Xcode 6 has been breaking the build :(\n. 0.3-wip branch should work with xcode 6 gm\n. https://github.com/specta/specta/tree/0.3-wip\n. There won't be anymore breaking changes. 0.3 branch is stable enough to be used in production today.\n. I am still trying to figure out if it makes any sense to bring back static lib targets. You can still use Cocoapods to build static libs though.\n. in 0.3.0 beta 1, `rake` produces both framework and static lib binaries.\n. will support this in 0.3\n. @fatuhoku  should it be\n1. `-[SomeSpec test_group__group__example]` or\n2. `-[SomeSpec test__group__group__example]`?\n. I am going with 1 for now\n. implemented in 525712e93f48890a5ed412621a6e11a9468b1ea2\n. Can you check that this fixes the issue:\n\nhttps://github.com/specta/specta/commit/f3c4afe21c8cf9099f3bed09d329f663f945890b\n. yes that tag does not exist yet. tried this? @visav\n\n```\npod 'Specta', :git => 'https://github.com/specta/specta.git', :commit => 'f3c4afe21c8cf9099f3bed09d329f663f945890b'\n```\n. Let me attempt to solve this by printing the seed in a \"fake\" test case.\n. while this appears to be fixed in master of xctool, xctool also no longer prints test seed.\n. The header file for SPTUtility (that defines SPTCurrentSpec) is no longer exposed, so you should do: \n\n``` objectivec\nSPTSpec *spec = [[NSThread currentThread] threadDictionary][@\"SPTCurrentSpec\"];\n```\n\nI will think about exposing all header files again in beta2.\n. It's not pushed to Cocoapods repo yet, do the following until it is pushed:\n\n``` ruby\npod 'Specta', :git => 'https://github.com/specta/specta.git', :tag => 'v0.3.0.beta1'\n```\n. which version of cocoapods are you using?\n. can you try again?\n.

I've used them in the past to create API integration tests for each version of an app. That way I knew if API changes would break older versions of the app.\n\nStandalone tests can also be run within Instruments, which I've found really useful to find memory or performance issues from time to time.\n.

The default reporter format that I built breaks Xcode's test integration in Xcode 5.0.1. Since Xcode seems to be finicky about the format, Specta should modify the output format as little as possible by default.\n\nI'll work on restoring this feature, but the new format may be much closer to Xcode's default.\n. My commit above re-adds support for custom reporters, but the format has changed to be compatible with Xcode's test integration features.\n\nThis is a much simpler implementation than the original. SPTReporter is simply a subclass of XCTestLog so its output should track any changes made by the Xcode team. As just another observer, it should play well with any 3rd-party observers too.\n\nThe only non-standard aspect is that I was forced to swizzle -[XCTestLog startObserving] and -[XCTestLog stopObserving]. There was no other way to force XCTest to use SPTReporter without requiring users to explicitly add the -XCTestObserverClass default to their test scheme.\n. I often compare arrays by equality, so the failure message will include the mis-matched values. Something like:\n\n``` objc\nexpect([array valueForKey:@\"someValue\"]).to.equal(expectedValues);\n```\n\nThe ease of constructing `expectedValues` sometimes isn't easy. I've sometimes included the array index in the comparison simply to include it in the text output. \n\n``` objc\nexpect([ @(i), [array[i] someValue] ]).to.equal([@(i), @1]);\n```\n\nLastly, you can write custom matchers in expecta which might be more expressive if you have lots of expectations:\n\n``` objc\nexpect(array[i]).to.beValidUser();\n```\n\nThat makes the test much more readable, even if the matchers aren't used that often. If you don't want to write a matcher, there's always a C function too!\n. The custom reporter stuff is addressed now -- what is the relationship to 'standalone' specs?\n\nI actually had need for running tests outside of OCUnit this afternoon. I couldn't find any way to profile tests to look for memory leaks under OCUnit. Does 'standalone' mean outside of OCUnit?\n. I actually think standalone tests would be worthwhile. I've used them in the past to create API integration tests for each version of an app. That way I knew if API changes would break older versions of the app.\n\nStandalone tests can also be run within Instruments, which I've found really useful to find memory or performance issues from time to time.\n. Oops! I also developed some Xcode templates, which I should have put on a branch and submitted separately. LMK if you want me to break this up, or if you're good with both commits.\n. I've continued to work on new features, in particular:\n- New output format that's easier to read, while maintaining the stuff Xcode needs for its integration\n- Report pending specs in the output, and support Cedar's PENDING macro.\n- Focused specs, allowing a subset of specs to be run.\n\nI'd like to keep this on my master branch, so if you want to integrate any of this into Specta main, let me know and I can split this into more appropriate feature branches.\n. Thanks for tracking this down! Can you submit a pull request?\n\nI'm heading out of town, but will have a bit of time this weekend to review and accept.\n\n> On Jul 10, 2013, at 11:33 AM, Andrew Wong notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> i tracked down the problem to commit 8608ba8 and it appears to be the same problem that appeared in Cedar (pivotal/cedar@6ace9c9)\n> \n> looks like the implementation of ClassesWithClassMethod has an incompatibility with Apple's class UIAccessibilitySafeCategory__NSObject, resulting in a crash on:\n> Method globalMethod = class_getClassMethod(aClass, classMethodSelector);\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Exactly. I typically use them with categories to setup and tear down global test state. Here's a contrived example with NSUserDefaults:\n\n@interface NSUserDefaults (SpecHelper)\n@end\n\n@implementation NSUserDefaults (SpecHelper)\n- (void)setCustomReporter\n  {\n  [[self standardUserDefaults]  setObject:@\"SPTVerboseReporter\" forKey:@\"com.github.petejkim.specta.SharedReporterClass\"];\n  }\n- (void)afterEach\n  {\n  [[self standardUserDefaults]  removeObjectForKey:@\"com.github.petejkim.specta.SharedReporterClass\"];\n  }\n\n@end\n\nThe drawback is that these run before ALL examples in your suite. I think the -[SPTSenTestCase SPT_setUp] version would only run before and after each example in a single spec, right?\n\nIf that's the case, then they might be complimentary, especially if you renamed the methods to -beforeEach and -afterEach.\n\nOn Aug 5, 2013, at 7:41 PM, Justin Spahr-Summers notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> @petejkim Ah, perhaps.

My tests crash with XCTest + ARC when it tries to invoke global +beforeEach and +afterEach methods.

But curious if nobody else saw this, or is using this feature.\n. @petejkim I noticed that you pulled the custom reporters I added to Specta awhile back. This is sad, but probably necessary given that Xcode and other tools are completely dependent on the output format.\n\nAny objection if I try to find a way to add this back in as an opt-in, off-by-default feature?

The default reporter format that I built breaks Xcode's test integration in Xcode 5.0.1. Since Xcode seems to be finicky about the format, Specta should modify the output format as little as possible by default.\n\nI'll work on restoring this feature, but the new format may be much closer to Xcode's default.\n. My commit above re-adds support for custom reporters, but the format has changed to be compatible with Xcode's test integration features.\n\nThis is a much simpler implementation than the original. SPTReporter is simply a subclass of XCTestLog so its output should track any changes made by the Xcode team. As just another observer, it should play well with any 3rd-party observers too.\n\nThe only non-standard aspect is that I was forced to swizzle -[XCTestLog startObserving] and -[XCTestLog stopObserving]. There was no other way to force XCTest to use SPTReporter without requiring users to explicitly add the -XCTestObserverClass default to their test scheme.\n.

I don't think there's much Specta can do to improve this though this issue specifically is an Expecta issue, it uses all the official APIs for failing with lines/files.  Specta generating test cases that conform to how XCTest would, I think the flakiness is basically Xcode.\n. This is all cool now. I just released `0.3.2`.\n.

Then maybe take a look at the potential for a Swift Specta separate lib, and rely on swift matcher libs.\n.

I think the tradeoff of \n\n>  All Obj-C global functions are now prefixed with `spt_`. This is to provide unprefixed versions functions of the same name for Swift. It is recommended to add shorthands to your Obj-C test helper header. The  rest of this document assumes that shorthands are used.\n\nIs quite serious.\n. > I think we can get around the issue by creating a separate framework (e.g. Specta-Swift) that uses the objc Specta framework.\n\nThink this is a great idea. `Suspecta`\n. OK, think this is also fine to be closed, I think encouraging Quick/Nimble as a great option for Swift support is probably the best call.\n. @paweldudek thanks for doing this!\n\nI agree with @danpalmer - looking at the screenshot in this issue: https://github.com/specta/specta/issues/116 you see the issue raised at the place in code that we're making changes in. So we could add inline documentation in `Specta/Specta/SPTExampleGroup.m` before line 26 along the lines of:\n\n```\n// Specta supports blacklisting specific Classes from being treated as before/after helper classes\n// to add an new class to the list add the following lines to a project initialiser ( e.g. App Delegate callbacks )\n//\n//  Class accessbilitySafeCategoryClass = NSClassFromString(@\"MyClass\");\n//  class_addProtocol(accessbilitySafeCategoryClass, @protocol(SPTExcludeGlobalBeforeAfterEach));\n//\n```\n\nHow does that sound?\n. I think this is :+1: \n. re:README, I'm 60/40 towards not adding it. \n\nI don't think it's something you're going to necessarily need to know about library. More likely that it comes up and you see the crash then you've got a reference point. The counter argument though is that you could be just running the framework and not have source code access, in which case it might be useful.\n. Looking through the [builds on travis](https://travis-ci.org/specta/specta/builds) I don't see any flakiness anymore.\n. Think this is something we should do on Expecta too? ( [1](https://github.com/specta/expecta/blob/a9694cc390c9e86dc68b96ca5a5f14e8a4f0a990/Expecta/ExpectaSupport.m#L161-L175) & [2](https://github.com/tonyarnold/expecta/blob/a9694cc390c9e86dc68b96ca5a5f14e8a4f0a990/Expecta/ExpectaSupport.h#L43-43) )\n. I, personally, don't think so, but it has been in since commit 1, https://github.com/specta/specta/commit/a24a1fd3f4710ff9e66beef19d5b528100031fcc#diff-28827b6c203d48ba1b463ab3854fbe9aR30 \n. OK, I'm good for this then :+1: - THANKS!\n\n![Bitch slapping](http://i.imgur.com/EqhPVyX.gif)\n. Cool, this makes sense in relation with #134 \n. CI issue may have been https://github.com/specta/specta/issues/132\n. Yeah, this makes sense :+1: \n. This is a stack overflow question really as it's a usage question. However, your answer is in `__block` and the `before` methods. Take a look through [these tests](https://github.com/artsy/eigen/blob/master/Artsy%20Tests/ARAnnotatedMapViewTests.m) ( and the rest if you're interested).\n. We have a similar thing with CocoaPods, even including a way of highlighting that you're read the contributing guides in your issue, so we know to put more effort in.\n\nThink this is a good idea.\n. Done!\n. I think Specta has semi-accidentally become one of the most widespread testing framework due to it being the default when creating [a new CocoaPod](http://guides.cocoapods.org/making/using-pod-lib-create.html).\n\nMy initial worry was a lack of releases and a sense of stagnation, that I feel is gone. I think this makes sense for a wiki page though!\n. OK, I'm calling this one as not needed, there's at least [4,000 test targets](http://cocoapods.org/pods/Specta) using Specta now \ud83d\udc6f \n. There is work from Quick on this: https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/233\n. Ah yeah, thanks @mokagio \n. This looks good, thanks a lot @dbarden :+1: \n. Yeah!\n. Capital P on CocoaPods please in the title. Other than that looks good to merge.\n. :+1: \n. I think we should break it, and call the next release `1.0.0` with whitelisting. Feels like a weird feature in general to me.\n. The 1.0.0 is an ideological thing, Specta is very production worthy. Its version should reflect that.\n. Can you make a changeling note too please?\n. @modocache / @paweldudek / @robb  - I'm happy with this from a end-user perspective, if it's good to go, feel free to hit merge.\n. :D\n. A great contribution @dasmer - you can get a high five when I see you next.\n. #161 may have fixed this\n. I think this will require changing the Rakefile yeah, we shouldn't skip running iOS on CI. If this is the only way to support Carthage correctly I guess it should be done then. \n. The CI rake task has always ran the iOS schemes,  `The command \"bundle exec rake specs:ios\" exited with 1.` - I'd rather not lose those tests, given that iOS is probably the context most tests are being ran in.\n\nThis is the command it is running, it's probably just a matter of re-hooking it up somewhere else:\n\n```\nRunning xcrun xcodebuild -workspace Specta.xcworkspace -scheme Specta-iOS -configuration Release test SYMROOT=build | xcpretty -c && exit ${PIPESTATUS[0]}...\nxcodebuild: error: Scheme Specta-iOS is not currently configured for the test action.\n```\n. Yeah, that should be fine :+1: \n. There are tests around unexpected Exceptions, in [UnexpectedExceptionTest.m](https://github.com/specta/specta/blob/master/Specta/SpectaTests/UnexpectedExceptionTest.m) that pass. \n\nDo you have some reproducible code? \n. Adding this to the README worries me, it's a lot of noise. Could we change the project, and inject in the config files for the code coverage in the rake task?\n. This is totally cool from my perspective :+1: \n. Hrm, can you verify that the test are actually being ran? Xcode still tells you the names of the tests I believe, but they're just not ran.\n. Alright, let's do it :+1: \n. This is released in 1.0.1\n. It's showing a green tick for the test that successfully passed, but not for the missing result. Perhaps we need to hook in to uncaught exceptions and raise an `XCTFail`. Any chance you can post the crashing code or can make a PR tackling this?\n. Cool, this looks good to me then!\n. This is released in 1.0.2\n. Thanks for contributing!\n. Ace, thanks @coverback \n. This is released in 1.0.2\n. A PR is far more useful than a +1, please don't do them. Specta is built in a language you're writing code in, if you can diagnose a problem you can help contribute an answer.\n. Seriously? \n. TBH, the build setting could probably be removed from Specta and sent in via the CI test command, which is how we do it [at Artsy](https://github.com/artsy/energy/blob/master/Makefile#L43).\n. specifically adding `GCC_INSTRUMENT_PROGRAM_FLOW_ARCS=YES GCC_GENERATE_TEST_COVERAGE_FILES=YES` to the `xcodebuild` command\n. I'm not sure about this, Spectra's responsibilities are to provide a structure for the tests and projects like [expecta](https://github.com/specta/expecta) offer matchers separately. This de-clarifys the feature-set in a way I'm not sold on. Anyone else got opinions?\n. @WilliamZang as long as it's pretty generic in Specta, sure :+1: \n. Closing due to inactivity :+1: feel free to re-open.\n. @modocache and I were looking at this earlier with respect to Quick, not sure if he found anything\n. After looking at all the Quick/Nimble PRs around this, no-one came up with anything - I'm going to close this PR, no need to keep fighting that battle, when Xcode 8 comes out, we can see if those radars have helped.\n. @pvinis if you want to look at a collection of Specta/Expecta tests, you can check out: https://github.com/artsy/eigen/tree/master/Artsy_Tests\n. If you put it outside the `SpecBegin` and `SpecEnd` blocks then you can treat it like any objective-c file, including [methods](https://github.com/artsy/eigen/blob/master/Artsy_Tests/Networking_Tests/Collection/ARGeneArtworksNetworkModelTests.m#L98), [classes](https://github.com/artsy/eigen/blob/master/Artsy_Tests/Networking_Tests/Collection/ARGeneArtworksNetworkModelTests.m#L4-L11) etc.\n. This seems reasonable to me :+1: \n. This makes sense, would happily accept PRs on this :+1: \n. There is no better way, TBH, I like both of the approaches that Kiwi does. The warning and the output. We've seen a few \"user issues\" over time because of this and I think Kiwis solves it pretty elegantly. \n\nAny chance of a PR adding this?\n. Ace!\n. :+1: \n. @modocache any ideas?\n. This is fixed in master :+1: \n. Seems legit, don't think anyone is gonna be submitting apps with this to the store.\n. Thanks @guidomb \n. When I checked this out, it looked like they've been in since 2013 - likely were added to do something that isn't needed anymore. :+1: \n. sigh\n. OK, I'm cool with migrating to Xcode 7 on CI :+1: \n. Importing this is basically a major release bump, given that it breaks Xcode6 compatibility after looking at #182 \n. Fixed by #186 \n. Yeah, this is a usage problem, `describe`s  should be used for grouping, and `it` is used for the tests. In implementation terms an `it` represents an XCTestCase, and they cannot be built inside each other.\n. This feels good to me then :+1: \n. New version deployed.\n![screen shot 2015-09-22 at 07 56 20](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/49038/10012383/70028d18-60ff-11e5-8266-f02fa63bbdc5.png)\n. also, @melote - please don't go around +1ing a bunch of things, as someone with enough github email a bunch of +1s only make it harder to decide what I want to work on.\n. :+1: \n. I'm afraid not, I don't feel comfortable shipping binaries, personally.\n. Probably best to use specta's waitUntil:\n\n```\n  it(@\"should do some stuff asynchronously\", ^{\n    waitUntil(^(DoneCallback done) {\n      // Async example blocks need to invoke done() callback.\n      done();\n    });\n  });\n```\n\nGiven that we don't expose XCTest anywhere else. \n. Calling as done, we've only used `waitUntil` in multiple codebases and been happy. Would be happy to take PRs on allowing the usage of XCTExpectations though.\n. That's handled by matcher libraries normally, https://github.com/specta/expecta#asynchronous-testing\n. The same thing happens in Quick, no-one has figured it out I'm afraid. You're welcome to try dig, but I think you'll need to be looking in Xcode.\n. I haven't raised one, happy to have others do it :+1: \n. Duped \ud83d\udc4d \n. Looks like you need code signing.\n. Not too sure what we can do here, we're using Apple's API that says the LOC and the file that the error occurred on. Otherwise the warnings / error labels in Xcode would work.\n. This is a duplicate of #187 \n. You might be the first to look into this, any chance you can dig in and get us a PR?\n. I don't know much about how UI tests work, do they have constraints around threading? \n\nIt might be worth seeing if an XCTestExpectation works (outside of Specta) in UITesting\n. Hah, thanks for digging in @blackivory86 !\n. Given that no-one should be pushing Specta to the app store in their app, this seems :+1: to me\n. Awesome! Thanks!\n. Works for me :+1: \n. :+1: Looks good for me.\n. I'm not really sure this is something we should change, it feels like a change in xctool has cause this which is working fine in xcodebuild etc. If quick is having the same problems, it seems like the problem really lies in xctool.\n. I'm not really sure, I didn't write that back in the day, I'm just making sure that it's staying working. You're welcome to take a look around the source.\n. Yeah, code you want to run inside the describe/context blocks should always be running inside before/after/it blocks: [for example](https://github.com/artsy/eigen/blob/master/Artsy_Tests/Networking_Tests/ARRouterTests.m#L7-L26) - unless it's OK to set once on app startup [e.g.](https://github.com/artsy/eigen/blob/master/Artsy_Tests/Networking_Tests/ARRouterTests.m#L107).\n. I guess xctool might load the test bundle, try gather all the `it` blocks before it's ready to run them so they can make assumptions for the tool itself, perhaps there's something getting something created and nil'd when it's not expecting it. Hard to say.\n. Sounds like it's worth making a PR to the podspec to make sure that tvOS support does not have bit code disabled, would you like to do that?\n. ![screen shot 2016-02-11 at 15 25 36](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/49038/12980292/ba88aaa4-d0d3-11e5-8666-1f6950fc6d6e.png)\n\nHappy to add the example name ~~it is both on the line above and the line below too~~  - hrm that might be by-product of how Specta tests itself. I'm going to add the name.\n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. I did not know about `[ci skip]`\n. No plans for it, it's been a pretty niche platform. Would definitely merge a PR adding it to the Podspec after you've tested it.\n. :+1:  can't assign people not in the org, but consider it yours\n. Gonna call this one for now, you're welcome to re-open via a PR.\n. AppCode has special support for Kiwi, but not for Specta alas.\n. Yep \ud83d\udc6f \n. Thanks\n. Sure, seems reasonable to me :+1: \n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. I'm afraid I don't really know too much about how `BFTask` works, and from the looks of it, neither does any of the other contributors. It might be more prudent to ask if there's anything that BFTask does that might have issues around running inside a separate runloop.\n. Thanks!\n. Not really, Xcode opens the application and then tells the test runner that it should start and eventually to close. \n\nThe other side of this, is that loading your app up from scratch takes ~2-3 seconds, I don't think anyone wants to wait that long between each test. _maybe_ between each test suite, but still, it's outside of Specta/Kiwis scope - you'd need to replace the XCTest runner, or have an Xcode plugin to pull it off I'm afraid.\n. Note: there are no end-user changes here, only fixes to the Specs.\n. \ud83d\udc4d works for me - thanks. Sure thing \ud83d\udc4d . Yep - this looks good, want to add a changelog entry and I'll ship a release?. cool, shipped\r\n![screen shot 2017-02-08 at 10 34 31 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/49038/22744071/413aa05a-edea-11e6-9f68-2e11865695df.png)\r\n. Yeah, this looks right to me \ud83d\udc4d . This is shipped in 1.0.7. Sorry for the delay, lots of projects to manage. Is this because of a specific build warning?

I think think a test launch argument probably makes the most sense\n\n![screen shot 2014-07-04 at 16 50 50](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/49038/3483665/089f10ee-0393-11e4-98ea-696e5c87170a.png)\n\nI'm happy for that to also shuffle the classes, the more shuffling the merrier IMO :dancers: \n. ![http://treasure.diylol.com/uploads/post/image/513436/resized_all-the-things-meme-generator-add-all-the-features-137487.jpg](http://treasure.diylol.com/uploads/post/image/513436/resized_all-the-things-meme-generator-add-all-the-features-137487.jpg)\n. There's been two of these PRs - it should probably get merged so anyone using `:git` has a working version.\n\n#95 \n. Agree, documentation issue.\n. Related: https://github.com/specta/specta/issues/123\n. This is merged with #133 \n. Closing, looks resolved.\n. This is working for me in Xcode 6.1.1\n\n![screen shot 2015-02-10 at 5 35 51 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/49038/6137974/4a35cf96-b14b-11e4-9f03-d9a9d3d5b889.png)\n. I don't think there's much Specta can do to improve this though this issue specifically is an Expecta issue, it uses all the official APIs for failing with lines/files.  Specta generating test cases that conform to how XCTest would, I think the flakiness is basically Xcode.\n. This is all cool now. I just released `0.3.2`.\n. This might fit better as a custom Expecta matcher :+1: - check some [examples here](http://cocoapods.org/?q=expecta)\n. closing as a dupe of #85 - this seems to be based on the phase of the moon and how strong venus' pull is.\n. I think this is off topic, plus pretty much resolved. Closing.\n. Given that frameworks are the future for the library I think it makes sense to keep this out as it'll be confusing for people that it won't work for. Thanks for the PR @twobitlabs \n. PR merged. Though @tonyarnold's point about removal is probably legit.\n. Ran locally, works for me where it doesn't on master :+1: \n\n```\n=== GENERATE UNIVERSAL iOS BINARY (Device/Simulator) ===\nRunning mkdir -p 'Specta/build/Release-ios-universal'...\nRunning cp -a 'Specta/build/Release-iphoneos/Specta.framework' 'Specta/build/Release-ios-universal'...\nRunning cp -a 'Specta/build/Release-iphoneos/libSpecta.a' 'Specta/build/Release-ios-universal'...\nRunning lipo -create 'Specta/build/Release-iphoneos/Specta.framework/Specta' 'Specta/build/Release-iphonesimulator/Specta.framework/Specta' -output 'Specta/build/Release-ios-universal/Specta.framework/Specta'...\nRunning lipo -create 'Specta/build/Release-iphoneos/libSpecta.a' 'Specta/build/Release-iphonesimulator/libSpecta.a' -output 'Specta/build/Release-ios-universal/libSpecta.a'...\n\n=== CODESIGN iOS FRAMEWORK ===\nRunning /usr/bin/codesign --force --sign 'iPhone Developer: Caroline Lau (AE9AEY2F5Z)' --resource-rules='Specta/build/Release-ios-universal/Specta.framework'/ResourceRules.plist 'Specta/build/Release-ios-universal/Specta.framework'...\nWarning: --resource-rules has been deprecated in Mac OS X >= 10.10!\n\n=== COPY PRODUCTS ===\nRunning yes | rm -rf Products...\nRunning mkdir -p Products/ios...\nRunning mkdir -p Products/osx...\nRunning cp -a Specta/build/Release/Specta.framework Products/osx...\nRunning cp -a Specta/build/Release/libSpecta.a Products/osx...\nRunning cp -a Specta/build/Release-ios-universal/Specta.framework Products/ios...\nRunning cp -a Specta/build/Release-ios-universal/libSpecta.a Products/ios...\nRunning cp -a Specta/build/Release/usr/local/include/* Products...\n\n** BUILD SUCCEEDED **\n```\n. I think https://github.com/specta/specta/pull/120 has fixed this.\n. Fixed in #131\n\n( You can add support in your project to make it skip any specific class )\n. Any ideas on this? I've not seen this in a long time\n\n![screen shot 2015-02-10 at 4 40 36 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/49038/6137027/9d7703d0-b143-11e4-85f9-f0643fd4be4f.png)\n. closing as a dupe of https://github.com/specta/specta/issues/85 - which has more info\n. @jsteinberg Can you provide an example of how this was failing? The logic now seems to be inversed\n. Alright, think this is better overall :+1: \n. This looks good, discussed it on [twitter](https://twitter.com/orta/status/565250689472159744). Thanks @neonacho\n. Expecta will need a similar PR I think.\n. Yep: https://github.com/specta/expecta/blob/master/Expecta/ExpectaSupport.m#L161-L175\n\nWould love a PR\n. I think this makes sense, would love to see a PR :+1: \n. I, conveniently, have the power to add people to push podspecs, currently only Peter / Blake can push, would anyone else (who is in the org) want adding?\n. Hah totally was worth it. I added you for daring to speak up. \n\nI tested running Specta as a framework, it works as expected, so I'm removing the `_spt_it` to `it` out, that is a requirement for Swift support, but swift support should be outside of the scope of cleanup IMO. \n\n![screen shot 2015-02-07 at 2 35 55 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/49038/6093671/b63dbbd0-aed6-11e4-89ec-3366f310cca2.png)\n. > means that there's some OCUnit support still out there, but I can find any. Could you shed some light on what you mean by that?\n\nThis might be more Expecta things also! I'll tick it.\n. Alright, I'm closing this issue. Looks like @paweldudek did most of the code work, thanks :tada: !\nOnce Expecta has caught up I'll tag a `1.0.0` release to coincide with that. Then maybe take a look at the potential for a Swift Specta separate lib, and rely on swift matcher libs.\n. Hey, awesome work @paweldudek !\n. this is interesting - master is running additional tests which include sequence tests which are failing, https://travis-ci.org/specta/specta/builds/50258272\n. Makes sense, digging right now :+1: \n. Yeah, that's definitely it.\n. Day one making changes and something already needs to be reverted :dancers: \n. I think the tradeoff of \n\n>  All Obj-C global functions are now prefixed with `spt_`. This is to provide unprefixed versions functions of the same name for Swift. It is recommended to add shorthands to your Obj-C test helper header. The  rest of this document assumes that shorthands are used.\n\nIs quite serious.\n. > I think we can get around the issue by creating a separate framework (e.g. Specta-Swift) that uses the objc Specta framework.\n\nThink this is a great idea. `Suspecta`\n. OK, think this is also fine to be closed, I think encouraging Quick/Nimble as a great option for Swift support is probably the best call.\n. @paweldudek thanks for doing this!\n\nI agree with @danpalmer - looking at the screenshot in this issue: https://github.com/specta/specta/issues/116 you see the issue raised at the place in code that we're making changes in. So we could add inline documentation in `Specta/Specta/SPTExampleGroup.m` before line 26 along the lines of:\n\n```\n// Specta supports blacklisting specific Classes from being treated as before/after helper classes\n// to add an new class to the list add the following lines to a project initialiser ( e.g. App Delegate callbacks )\n//\n//  Class accessbilitySafeCategoryClass = NSClassFromString(@\"MyClass\");\n//  class_addProtocol(accessbilitySafeCategoryClass, @protocol(SPTExcludeGlobalBeforeAfterEach));\n//\n```\n\nHow does that sound?\n. I think this is :+1: \n. re:README, I'm 60/40 towards not adding it. \n\nI don't think it's something you're going to necessarily need to know about library. More likely that it comes up and you see the crash then you've got a reference point. The counter argument though is that you could be just running the framework and not have source code access, in which case it might be useful.\n. Looking through the [builds on travis](https://travis-ci.org/specta/specta/builds) I don't see any flakiness anymore.\n. Think this is something we should do on Expecta too? ( [1](https://github.com/specta/expecta/blob/a9694cc390c9e86dc68b96ca5a5f14e8a4f0a990/Expecta/ExpectaSupport.m#L161-L175) & [2](https://github.com/tonyarnold/expecta/blob/a9694cc390c9e86dc68b96ca5a5f14e8a4f0a990/Expecta/ExpectaSupport.h#L43-43) )\n. I, personally, don't think so, but it has been in since commit 1, https://github.com/specta/specta/commit/a24a1fd3f4710ff9e66beef19d5b528100031fcc#diff-28827b6c203d48ba1b463ab3854fbe9aR30 \n. OK, I'm good for this then :+1: - THANKS!\n\n![Bitch slapping](http://i.imgur.com/EqhPVyX.gif)\n. Cool, this makes sense in relation with #134 \n. CI issue may have been https://github.com/specta/specta/issues/132\n. Yeah, this makes sense :+1: \n. This is a stack overflow question really as it's a usage question. However, your answer is in `__block` and the `before` methods. Take a look through [these tests](https://github.com/artsy/eigen/blob/master/Artsy%20Tests/ARAnnotatedMapViewTests.m) ( and the rest if you're interested).\n. We have a similar thing with CocoaPods, even including a way of highlighting that you're read the contributing guides in your issue, so we know to put more effort in.\n\nThink this is a good idea.\n. Done!\n. I think Specta has semi-accidentally become one of the most widespread testing framework due to it being the default when creating [a new CocoaPod](http://guides.cocoapods.org/making/using-pod-lib-create.html).\n\nMy initial worry was a lack of releases and a sense of stagnation, that I feel is gone. I think this makes sense for a wiki page though!\n. OK, I'm calling this one as not needed, there's at least [4,000 test targets](http://cocoapods.org/pods/Specta) using Specta now \ud83d\udc6f \n. There is work from Quick on this: https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/233\n. Ah yeah, thanks @mokagio \n. This looks good, thanks a lot @dbarden :+1: \n. Yeah!\n. Capital P on CocoaPods please in the title. Other than that looks good to merge.\n. :+1: \n. I think we should break it, and call the next release `1.0.0` with whitelisting. Feels like a weird feature in general to me.\n. The 1.0.0 is an ideological thing, Specta is very production worthy. Its version should reflect that.\n. Can you make a changeling note too please?\n. @modocache / @paweldudek / @robb  - I'm happy with this from a end-user perspective, if it's good to go, feel free to hit merge.\n. :D\n. A great contribution @dasmer - you can get a high five when I see you next.\n. #161 may have fixed this\n. I think this will require changing the Rakefile yeah, we shouldn't skip running iOS on CI. If this is the only way to support Carthage correctly I guess it should be done then. \n. The CI rake task has always ran the iOS schemes,  `The command \"bundle exec rake specs:ios\" exited with 1.` - I'd rather not lose those tests, given that iOS is probably the context most tests are being ran in.\n\nThis is the command it is running, it's probably just a matter of re-hooking it up somewhere else:\n\n```\nRunning xcrun xcodebuild -workspace Specta.xcworkspace -scheme Specta-iOS -configuration Release test SYMROOT=build | xcpretty -c && exit ${PIPESTATUS[0]}...\nxcodebuild: error: Scheme Specta-iOS is not currently configured for the test action.\n```\n. Yeah, that should be fine :+1: \n. There are tests around unexpected Exceptions, in [UnexpectedExceptionTest.m](https://github.com/specta/specta/blob/master/Specta/SpectaTests/UnexpectedExceptionTest.m) that pass. \n\nDo you have some reproducible code? \n. Adding this to the README worries me, it's a lot of noise. Could we change the project, and inject in the config files for the code coverage in the rake task?\n. This is totally cool from my perspective :+1: \n. Hrm, can you verify that the test are actually being ran? Xcode still tells you the names of the tests I believe, but they're just not ran.\n. Alright, let's do it :+1: \n. This is released in 1.0.1\n. It's showing a green tick for the test that successfully passed, but not for the missing result. Perhaps we need to hook in to uncaught exceptions and raise an `XCTFail`. Any chance you can post the crashing code or can make a PR tackling this?\n. Cool, this looks good to me then!\n. This is released in 1.0.2\n. Thanks for contributing!\n. Ace, thanks @coverback \n. This is released in 1.0.2\n. A PR is far more useful than a +1, please don't do them. Specta is built in a language you're writing code in, if you can diagnose a problem you can help contribute an answer.\n. Seriously? \n. TBH, the build setting could probably be removed from Specta and sent in via the CI test command, which is how we do it [at Artsy](https://github.com/artsy/energy/blob/master/Makefile#L43).\n. specifically adding `GCC_INSTRUMENT_PROGRAM_FLOW_ARCS=YES GCC_GENERATE_TEST_COVERAGE_FILES=YES` to the `xcodebuild` command\n. I'm not sure about this, Spectra's responsibilities are to provide a structure for the tests and projects like [expecta](https://github.com/specta/expecta) offer matchers separately. This de-clarifys the feature-set in a way I'm not sold on. Anyone else got opinions?\n. @WilliamZang as long as it's pretty generic in Specta, sure :+1: \n. Closing due to inactivity :+1: feel free to re-open.\n. @modocache and I were looking at this earlier with respect to Quick, not sure if he found anything\n. After looking at all the Quick/Nimble PRs around this, no-one came up with anything - I'm going to close this PR, no need to keep fighting that battle, when Xcode 8 comes out, we can see if those radars have helped.\n. @pvinis if you want to look at a collection of Specta/Expecta tests, you can check out: https://github.com/artsy/eigen/tree/master/Artsy_Tests\n. If you put it outside the `SpecBegin` and `SpecEnd` blocks then you can treat it like any objective-c file, including [methods](https://github.com/artsy/eigen/blob/master/Artsy_Tests/Networking_Tests/Collection/ARGeneArtworksNetworkModelTests.m#L98), [classes](https://github.com/artsy/eigen/blob/master/Artsy_Tests/Networking_Tests/Collection/ARGeneArtworksNetworkModelTests.m#L4-L11) etc.\n. This seems reasonable to me :+1: \n. This makes sense, would happily accept PRs on this :+1: \n. There is no better way, TBH, I like both of the approaches that Kiwi does. The warning and the output. We've seen a few \"user issues\" over time because of this and I think Kiwis solves it pretty elegantly. \n\nAny chance of a PR adding this?\n. Ace!\n. :+1: \n. @modocache any ideas?\n. This is fixed in master :+1: \n. Seems legit, don't think anyone is gonna be submitting apps with this to the store.\n. Thanks @guidomb \n. When I checked this out, it looked like they've been in since 2013 - likely were added to do something that isn't needed anymore. :+1: \n. sigh\n. OK, I'm cool with migrating to Xcode 7 on CI :+1: \n. Importing this is basically a major release bump, given that it breaks Xcode6 compatibility after looking at #182 \n. Fixed by #186 \n. Yeah, this is a usage problem, `describe`s  should be used for grouping, and `it` is used for the tests. In implementation terms an `it` represents an XCTestCase, and they cannot be built inside each other.\n. This feels good to me then :+1: \n. New version deployed.\n![screen shot 2015-09-22 at 07 56 20](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/49038/10012383/70028d18-60ff-11e5-8266-f02fa63bbdc5.png)\n. also, @melote - please don't go around +1ing a bunch of things, as someone with enough github email a bunch of +1s only make it harder to decide what I want to work on.\n. :+1: \n. I'm afraid not, I don't feel comfortable shipping binaries, personally.\n. Probably best to use specta's waitUntil:\n\n```\n  it(@\"should do some stuff asynchronously\", ^{\n    waitUntil(^(DoneCallback done) {\n      // Async example blocks need to invoke done() callback.\n      done();\n    });\n  });\n```\n\nGiven that we don't expose XCTest anywhere else. \n. Calling as done, we've only used `waitUntil` in multiple codebases and been happy. Would be happy to take PRs on allowing the usage of XCTExpectations though.\n. That's handled by matcher libraries normally, https://github.com/specta/expecta#asynchronous-testing\n. The same thing happens in Quick, no-one has figured it out I'm afraid. You're welcome to try dig, but I think you'll need to be looking in Xcode.\n. I haven't raised one, happy to have others do it :+1: \n. Duped \ud83d\udc4d \n. Looks like you need code signing.\n. Not too sure what we can do here, we're using Apple's API that says the LOC and the file that the error occurred on. Otherwise the warnings / error labels in Xcode would work.\n. This is a duplicate of #187 \n. You might be the first to look into this, any chance you can dig in and get us a PR?\n. I don't know much about how UI tests work, do they have constraints around threading? \n\nIt might be worth seeing if an XCTestExpectation works (outside of Specta) in UITesting\n. Hah, thanks for digging in @blackivory86 !\n. Given that no-one should be pushing Specta to the app store in their app, this seems :+1: to me\n. Awesome! Thanks!\n. Works for me :+1: \n. :+1: Looks good for me.\n. I'm not really sure this is something we should change, it feels like a change in xctool has cause this which is working fine in xcodebuild etc. If quick is having the same problems, it seems like the problem really lies in xctool.\n. I'm not really sure, I didn't write that back in the day, I'm just making sure that it's staying working. You're welcome to take a look around the source.\n. Yeah, code you want to run inside the describe/context blocks should always be running inside before/after/it blocks: [for example](https://github.com/artsy/eigen/blob/master/Artsy_Tests/Networking_Tests/ARRouterTests.m#L7-L26) - unless it's OK to set once on app startup [e.g.](https://github.com/artsy/eigen/blob/master/Artsy_Tests/Networking_Tests/ARRouterTests.m#L107).\n. I guess xctool might load the test bundle, try gather all the `it` blocks before it's ready to run them so they can make assumptions for the tool itself, perhaps there's something getting something created and nil'd when it's not expecting it. Hard to say.\n. Sounds like it's worth making a PR to the podspec to make sure that tvOS support does not have bit code disabled, would you like to do that?\n. ![screen shot 2016-02-11 at 15 25 36](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/49038/12980292/ba88aaa4-d0d3-11e5-8666-1f6950fc6d6e.png)\n\nHappy to add the example name ~~it is both on the line above and the line below too~~  - hrm that might be by-product of how Specta tests itself. I'm going to add the name.\n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. I did not know about `[ci skip]`\n. No plans for it, it's been a pretty niche platform. Would definitely merge a PR adding it to the Podspec after you've tested it.\n. :+1:  can't assign people not in the org, but consider it yours\n. Gonna call this one for now, you're welcome to re-open via a PR.\n. AppCode has special support for Kiwi, but not for Specta alas.\n. Yep \ud83d\udc6f \n. Thanks\n. Sure, seems reasonable to me :+1: \n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. I'm afraid I don't really know too much about how `BFTask` works, and from the looks of it, neither does any of the other contributors. It might be more prudent to ask if there's anything that BFTask does that might have issues around running inside a separate runloop.\n. Thanks!\n. Not really, Xcode opens the application and then tells the test runner that it should start and eventually to close. \n\nThe other side of this, is that loading your app up from scratch takes ~2-3 seconds, I don't think anyone wants to wait that long between each test. _maybe_ between each test suite, but still, it's outside of Specta/Kiwis scope - you'd need to replace the XCTest runner, or have an Xcode plugin to pull it off I'm afraid.\n. Note: there are no end-user changes here, only fixes to the Specs.\n. \ud83d\udc4d works for me - thanks. Sure thing \ud83d\udc4d . Yep - this looks good, want to add a changelog entry and I'll ship a release?. cool, shipped\r\n![screen shot 2017-02-08 at 10 34 31 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/49038/22744071/413aa05a-edea-11e6-9f68-2e11865695df.png)\r\n. Yeah, this looks right to me \ud83d\udc4d . This is shipped in 1.0.7. Sorry for the delay, lots of projects to manage. Is this because of a specific build warning? I've been running Specta fine in Xcode 9. I'm happy to have this though.. This is shipped in 1.0.7. ",

So this seems like a pretty definitive answer going forward: https://twitter.com/joar_at_work/status/393121651321106432\n. Thanks @bainfu \u2014 that's @mgrimes' repository (he linked to his fork earlier in this thread).\n. @petejkim what can we do to help? Anything?\n. Absolutely can, @petejkim \u2014 I'll take a run at it tonight.\n. This is going to mean targeting 64-bit only on OS X. We should probably target 32/64-bit on iOS at the same time.\n. Actually, we'll need to skip 64-bit iOS until a future release of Xcode. If iOS 6.1 is the target, it can't contain 64-bit architectures just yet.\n. Just quickly (as this is early days for me with Specta's source):\n\n```\n/Users/tonyarnold/Documents/Open Source Projects/Specta/test/UnexpectedExceptionTest.m:0: error: -[_UnexpectedExceptionTestSpec group_example_1] : MyException: Oh Noes! %@\n```\n\nI'm seeing that when running Specta's test suite in master without any changes at all \u2014 is that expected? I've converted everything to ARC in a branch that I'll push up, but I'm seeing the exact same failure there.\n. OK, great. Well the basic conversion to ARC/modern Objective-C is (strangely enough) in the `arc-and-modern-objective-c` branch. I've updated the targets to iOS 6.1 & OS X 10.8, but I'd imagine they can both go back a notch if needs be. \n\nBeyond that, I'll have a sweep through and look for anything awry, but there are no analyser warnings, nor build errors \u2014 just the failing exception test.\n. It looks to me like facebook/xctool#219 addresses the problems with test introspection when using Specta and xctool. Can you confirm please, @jden?\n. Specifically Specta tests, or XCTest/SenTest as well?\n. I can't get them to run at all with Xcode 5 \u2014 it doesn't crash, I just get:\n\n```\nRunning 136 tests:\n\n........................................................................................................................................\n\n# ----- XCode (OCUnit) Test Output --------------------\n\nTest target SpectaTests encountered an error (Unexpected TestCaseDidStart)\n```\n\nBut it was doing that on the master branch as well for me.\n. It works in as far as it should:\n\n```\nTest Case '-[SpectaThingTestTests testExample]' started.\n/Users/tonyarnold/Desktop/SpectaThingTest/SpectaThingTestTests/SpectaThingTestTests.m:31: error: -[SpectaThingTestTests testExample] : failed - No implementation for \"-[SpectaThingTestTests testExample]\"\nTest Case '-[SpectaThingTestTests testExample]' failed (0.000 seconds).\n```\n. Yes, it was \u2014 OS X 10.9 (13A603) with Xcode 5.0.1 (5A2053).\n. Good to hear, @petejkim \u2014 hopefully you can get up and running shortly.\n. :thumbsup: works for me (in as far as anything works in Xcode 5 right now) \u2014 thanks @robb!\n. @robb, does Specta pass the test suite when you run it?

I'll check it out when I'm back at my mac!\n. Does this work on OS X? I see a reference to iOS 6 in the code, but I assume you're just testing for the existence of a selector that was present on both platforms?\n. You're right \u2014 my apologies. I read that wrong!\n. I don't have enough experience with OCMock to be able to answer. I never mock all that much\u2026\n. One thing to consider: Services like Travis CI won't be able to take advantage of this for quite a while given how long it took for Mavericks support on their service to land. I wouldn't expect they'll be running Yosemite/Xcode 6 for months after it's release. \n\nIs there a way to keep everything working with Xcode 5, but adding some Xcode 6 specific features as extensions (like Swift support)?

Even if you pass it to `codesign`you are warned not to use it. It was part of the changes introduced with OS X 10.9.5 and 10.10.0.\n\nI'd get rid of the build setting and the file, to be honest. I'm not sure what the impact will be on older versions of Xcode.\n. I could get behind this push \u2014 I was considering switching my projects over to XCTest directly (and to a degree, I have) but I would prefer to keep using Specta/Expecta for the foreseeable future. \n\nI'm happy to tackle the framework-related changes.\n. > I'm happy to tackle the framework-related changes. \n\nWhich @petejkim already took care of in his earlier 0.3-wip branch.

Is @mgrimes taking the right approach by dropping SenTestingKit support entirely? I've got a branch at [tonyarnold/specta/tree/xctest](/tonyarnold/specta/tree/xctest) that supports both, but isn't yet functional, and I wonder if there's really a lot of point in pouring effort into continuing to support SenTestingKit.\n\nThoughts?\n. So this seems like a pretty definitive answer going forward: https://twitter.com/joar_at_work/status/393121651321106432\n. Thanks @bainfu \u2014 that's @mgrimes' repository (he linked to his fork earlier in this thread).\n. @petejkim what can we do to help? Anything?\n. Absolutely can, @petejkim \u2014 I'll take a run at it tonight.\n. This is going to mean targeting 64-bit only on OS X. We should probably target 32/64-bit on iOS at the same time.\n. Actually, we'll need to skip 64-bit iOS until a future release of Xcode. If iOS 6.1 is the target, it can't contain 64-bit architectures just yet.\n. Just quickly (as this is early days for me with Specta's source):\n\n```\n/Users/tonyarnold/Documents/Open Source Projects/Specta/test/UnexpectedExceptionTest.m:0: error: -[_UnexpectedExceptionTestSpec group_example_1] : MyException: Oh Noes! %@\n```\n\nI'm seeing that when running Specta's test suite in master without any changes at all \u2014 is that expected? I've converted everything to ARC in a branch that I'll push up, but I'm seeing the exact same failure there.\n. OK, great. Well the basic conversion to ARC/modern Objective-C is (strangely enough) in the `arc-and-modern-objective-c` branch. I've updated the targets to iOS 6.1 & OS X 10.8, but I'd imagine they can both go back a notch if needs be. \n\nBeyond that, I'll have a sweep through and look for anything awry, but there are no analyser warnings, nor build errors \u2014 just the failing exception test.\n. It looks to me like facebook/xctool#219 addresses the problems with test introspection when using Specta and xctool. Can you confirm please, @jden?\n. Specifically Specta tests, or XCTest/SenTest as well?\n. I can't get them to run at all with Xcode 5 \u2014 it doesn't crash, I just get:\n\n```\nRunning 136 tests:\n\n........................................................................................................................................\n\n# ----- XCode (OCUnit) Test Output --------------------\n\nTest target SpectaTests encountered an error (Unexpected TestCaseDidStart)\n```\n\nBut it was doing that on the master branch as well for me.\n.

Yes, it was \u2014 OS X 10.9 (13A603) with Xcode 5.0.1 (5A2053).\n. Good to hear, @petejkim \u2014 hopefully you can get up and running shortly.\n. :thumbsup: works for me (in as far as anything works in Xcode 5 right now) \u2014 thanks @robb!\n. @robb, does Specta pass the test suite when you run it?

It's easier to review and give feedback this way\n. This was fixed in xctool 0.1.14 :sparkles: \n. I'm not very experienced in rspec but I found [this Stack Overflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5359558/when-to-use-rspec-let/5359979#5359979) helpful in understanding when to use `let` over `beforeEach`.\nThat being said, the compiler already catches misspelled names.\n\nFiner grained and more specific `let` blocks seem like a good addition to me, I also like the readability.\n\nJust to throw an idea out there, what if the syntax was reduced further by (ab)using keyed subscripts?\n\n``` objc\nlet(@\"foo\") = ^{ return @\"bar\"; };\n\nNSString *foo = get(@\"foo\");\n```\n\nkinda lke ReactiveCocoa uses its `RAC()` macro to communicate bindings.\n. > I also decided that each example group needs to retains it's own key/value collection, such that, if a few examples need a different value, their example group could define its own value w/o affecting the rest.\n\nDo you mean something like this?\n\n``` objc\ndescribe(@\"outer\", ^{\n    let(@\"foo\") = ^{ return @\"bar\"; };\n\n    it(@\"should be bar\", ^{\n        expect(get(@\"foo\")).to.equal(@\"bar\");\n    });\n\n    describe(@\"inner\", ^{\n        let(@\"foo\") = ^{ return @\"baz\"; };\n\n        it(@\"should be baz\", ^{\n            expect(get(@\"foo\")).to.equal(@\"baz\");\n        });\n    });\n});\n```\n. The lack of type information is a very good point.\n\nI suppose it's possible to build a macro so that `let` and `get` create and invoke a memoized block of the correct return type but that may be a bit too far out.\n\nIf you use `let` on stateful objects, you can end up with accidental dependencies across your tests. Are there any best-practices in Ruby to deal with that? If you create your dependencies in `beforeEach`, at least you get \"fresh\" objects in a well known state but at the expense of performance.\n. :ok_hand: \n. :bow:\n. Looks good to me :+1: \n.

Have you tried anything in particular that didn't work?\n. > It should be possible to make beforeEach (and friends) have a parameter type that would suggest to AppCode that it's a block.\n\nI believe the reason that `beforeEach` and `it` take `id` as a parameter for their block is that `^{ /* \u2026 */ }` and `^AsyncBlock { done(); }` have different signatures. It's pretty much a poor man's overloading.\n\nHave you looked if AppCode supports code snippets that you could use?\n. Looks like [AppCode 3.0 will ship with Kiwi Live Templates](http://blog.jetbrains.com/objc/2014/04/appcode-3-0-eap-opens-with-an-integrated-ui-designer-and-improved-project-settings/), so that seems to be way to go.\n. 1. You should be able to check out an earlier version of Specta that still supports OCTest, `0.1.11` might work\n2.

Would it make sense to have the random generator seed be an (optional) argument as well? That way, you could replay a specific permutation to verify you fixed your inter-test dependencies.\n. Closed by #93 \n. Would you mind doing a [`git bisect`](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect) on your codebase?\n. /cc @supermarin\n. @supermarin Whoops, guess I summoned you to the wrong issue \u2013 I guess I meant this in #99 :\n\n> @fatuhoku should it be\n> 1. -[SomeSpec test_group__group__example] or\n> 2. -[SomeSpec test__group__group__example]?\n. Thanks\n. Is the view controller hierarchy connected to a `UIWindow` in any way?\n. > Well the ETLoadingVC is set like this in the appDelegate.\n\nNot sure I follow, is the `ETLoadingVC` created in the `beforeEach` block or `-application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` ?\n\nEither way, I'd suggest against running your tests in parallel with your application logic, since there may be shared state that can make the tests hard to reason about.\n. Yeah, you could also consider creating a `UIWindow` in the `beforeEach` block.\n. If the `UIWindow` goes out of scope in the `beforeEach` block, it's going to be deallocated. Try\n\n``` objc\n__block UIWindow *window;\n\nbeforeEach(^{\n    mockUserDefaults = mock([NSUserDefaults class]);\n    loadingVC = [[ETLoadingVC alloc] initWithUserDefaults:mockUserDefaults];\n\n    window = [[UIWindow alloc] initWithFrame:[[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds]];\n    window.rootViewController = loadingVC;\n    [window makeKeyAndVisible];\n});\n```\n. `strcmp` returns 0 if strings are equal (-1 or 1 if they are not, depending on how they compare).\n\nIt seems to me, however, that a better approach here would be to use `NSClassFromString` \n. That's a long con if I've ever seen one\n. :boom:\n. > CI issue may have been #132\n\nYup.\n. :cherry_blossom: \n. :+1: \n. How did you verify that this actually helps in that case? I'm looking at a project here that has `Generate Test Coverage Files` and `Instrument Program Flow` set to `NO`, yet it produces no such error.\n. That seems like a good idea.\n. Sure, e.g.:\n\n``` objc\nSpecBegin(Thing)\n\n__block id foo;\n\nbeforeEach({\n    foo = [Foo new];\n});\n\nSpecEnd\n```\n. I think you'd have to make the variable `static` if you wanted to use it outside of `SpecBegin`. I'd put everything after `SpecBegin`.\n\nNote that you only need to use `__block` when you want to assign a value in e.g. `beforeEach`, which I believe is generally a good idea to ensure there is no shared state between tests.\n. FWIW, I'd be looking into committing frameworks with git lfs now.\n. Checking in `Carthage/Build` should do the trick I reckon\n. I take it this will have the name of the spec directly before it?\n. works for me\n. What's the migration path from SenTest to XCTest? Anything that could rain on a users parade when updating?\n. :sparkling_heart: \n. @mickeyreiss good thinking. Is that a regression compared to SenTest? If not, would you mind opening a separate issue for that?\n. @tonyarnold would you mind creating a [WIP] pull request from the arc branch? It's easier to review and give feedback this way\n. This was fixed in xctool 0.1.14 :sparkles: \n. I'm not very experienced in rspec but I found [this Stack Overflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5359558/when-to-use-rspec-let/5359979#5359979) helpful in understanding when to use `let` over `beforeEach`.\nThat being said, the compiler already catches misspelled names.\n\nFiner grained and more specific `let` blocks seem like a good addition to me, I also like the readability.\n\nJust to throw an idea out there, what if the syntax was reduced further by (ab)using keyed subscripts?\n\n``` objc\nlet(@\"foo\") = ^{ return @\"bar\"; };\n\nNSString *foo = get(@\"foo\");\n```\n\nkinda lke ReactiveCocoa uses its `RAC()` macro to communicate bindings.\n. > I also decided that each example group needs to retains it's own key/value collection, such that, if a few examples need a different value, their example group could define its own value w/o affecting the rest.\n\nDo you mean something like this?\n\n``` objc\ndescribe(@\"outer\", ^{\n    let(@\"foo\") = ^{ return @\"bar\"; };\n\n    it(@\"should be bar\", ^{\n        expect(get(@\"foo\")).to.equal(@\"bar\");\n    });\n\n    describe(@\"inner\", ^{\n        let(@\"foo\") = ^{ return @\"baz\"; };\n\n        it(@\"should be baz\", ^{\n            expect(get(@\"foo\")).to.equal(@\"baz\");\n        });\n    });\n});\n```\n. The lack of type information is a very good point.\n\nI suppose it's possible to build a macro so that `let` and `get` create and invoke a memoized block of the correct return type but that may be a bit too far out.\n\nIf you use `let` on stateful objects, you can end up with accidental dependencies across your tests. Are there any best-practices in Ruby to deal with that? If you create your dependencies in `beforeEach`, at least you get \"fresh\" objects in a well known state but at the expense of performance.\n. :ok_hand: \n. :bow:\n. Looks good to me :+1: \n. It runs, but it crashes quite frequently on Xcode 5.0, 10.8.4, updating to 5.0.1 right now\u2026\n. Yeah, just tried again and got these results:\n\n```\nSession completed in 0.611 seconds\n136 tests; 3 skipped; 0 failures; 0 exceptions; 18 pending\nProgram ended with exit code: 0\n```\n\n[Full report](https://gist.github.com/robb/7170438)\n. Just gave it a spin in Mantle and it seemed to work fine\n. I don't see the little run button next to examples, only full specs, if that's what you're asking?\n![screen shot 2013-10-29 at 1 57 14 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/212465/1428045/a82f1edc-4099-11e3-9fac-c1f0aefb4b46.png)\n. @nerdyc are you speaking about #54 ?\n. Thanks!\n. Seems like a bug to me\n. Thanks for your pull request :sparkling_heart: \n\ncould you add a test for this, too?\n. Ha, sorry, I only mentally `grep`ed this for asserts.\n. Looks good\n. > and add these 2 extra lines(Bold).\n\nNot sure which lines you mean exactly, but turning this into a Pull Request would be nice :sparkles: \n. @tonyarnold what's your feel on this?\n. In an effort to make progress on #125, I'll self-merge this if no one stops me :trollface: \n. :sparkling_heart: \n. Have you tried anything in particular that didn't work?\n. > It should be possible to make beforeEach (and friends) have a parameter type that would suggest to AppCode that it's a block.\n\nI believe the reason that `beforeEach` and `it` take `id` as a parameter for their block is that `^{ /* \u2026 */ }` and `^AsyncBlock { done(); }` have different signatures. It's pretty much a poor man's overloading.\n\nHave you looked if AppCode supports code snippets that you could use?\n. Looks like [AppCode 3.0 will ship with Kiwi Live Templates](http://blog.jetbrains.com/objc/2014/04/appcode-3-0-eap-opens-with-an-integrated-ui-designer-and-improved-project-settings/), so that seems to be way to go.\n. 1. You should be able to check out an earlier version of Specta that still supports OCTest, `0.1.11` might work\n2. TBH, I probably wouldn't bother with iOS 6 anymore when iOS 8 will be in beta next week.\n. Of course, it works on my box :unamused: \n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. What are the implications of that?\n. > I'm running Specta 0.3-wip branch in XCode 6 & iOS 7.1 & iOS 8 using Cocoapods 0.34.0.rc (I think if you upgrade to that it will solve the problem for you).\n\nYeah, I'm using Specta 2.1 in Xcode 6 which I installed with a dev version of cocoapods (0.33.something), the missing `<XCTest/XCTest.h>` seemed to have been a Cocoapods problem.\n. :+1: \n. Would it make sense to have the random generator seed be an (optional) argument as well? That way, you could replay a specific permutation to verify you fixed your inter-test dependencies.\n. Closed by #93 \n. Would you mind doing a [`git bisect`](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect) on your codebase?\n. /cc @supermarin\n. @supermarin Whoops, guess I summoned you to the wrong issue \u2013 I guess I meant this in #99 :\n\n> @fatuhoku should it be\n> 1. -[SomeSpec test_group__group__example] or\n> 2. -[SomeSpec test__group__group__example]?\n. Thanks\n. Is the view controller hierarchy connected to a `UIWindow` in any way?\n. > Well the ETLoadingVC is set like this in the appDelegate.\n\nNot sure I follow, is the `ETLoadingVC` created in the `beforeEach` block or `-application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` ?\n\nEither way, I'd suggest against running your tests in parallel with your application logic, since there may be shared state that can make the tests hard to reason about.\n. Yeah, you could also consider creating a `UIWindow` in the `beforeEach` block.\n. If the `UIWindow` goes out of scope in the `beforeEach` block, it's going to be deallocated. Try\n\n``` objc\n__block UIWindow *window;\n\nbeforeEach(^{\n    mockUserDefaults = mock([NSUserDefaults class]);\n    loadingVC = [[ETLoadingVC alloc] initWithUserDefaults:mockUserDefaults];\n\n    window = [[UIWindow alloc] initWithFrame:[[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds]];\n    window.rootViewController = loadingVC;\n    [window makeKeyAndVisible];\n});\n```\n. `strcmp` returns 0 if strings are equal (-1 or 1 if they are not, depending on how they compare).\n\nIt seems to me, however, that a better approach here would be to use `NSClassFromString` \n.

How would you want to randomize examples in Specta? Command line arguments as well?\n. @NSDex @hatunike Can you show the full code for your `sharedExamples(@\"some shared example\")`? As @akashivskyy mentions, it's possible you're accessing variables before Specta expects you to.\n. Looks like this can be closed! I'll keep this in mind when improving documentation in the future.

IIRC that PR has custom output piped to a file, rather than `stdout`, which might be the best we can do without reaching into Xcode internals.\n\nOne of the best ways to see support for this, across all testing frameworks, would be filing a radar. :snail: \n. It does seem unsafe for Specta to pick up _every_ class that implements `+beforeEach` and `+afterEach`.  Shouldn't it be _opt-in_, not _opt-out_? That is, _only_ classes that conform to a protocol like `SPTGlobalBeforeAfterEach` should be included.\n\n@wasnotrice, can you try putting the following code somewhere it'll be executed before Specta runs its tests, like maybe in your test helper's `+load` method?\n\n``` objc\nClass klass = NSClassFromString(@\"AVYPhotoEditorCustomization\");\nclass_addProtocol(klass, @protocol(SPTExcludeGlobalBeforeAfterEach));\n```\n. > @wasnotrice could you please check what hits +[AVYPhotoEditorCustomization initialize] if it has the exclude protocol added?\n\nFor the scope of this issue, I think it's worth double-checking here. :point_up: \n\nBut a few notes:\n\n> So far we had two issues related to this. I'm pretty sure this issue is unavoidable even with whitelisting mechanism\n\nThere are [other approaches](https://github.com/Quick/Quick/blob/47079aea66854e9398cf211037d7409bf40b2e5d/Documentation/ConfiguringQuick.md#adding-global-beforeeach-and-aftereach-closures), ones that doesn't involve checking the class list for protocol conformance in either direction. I don't think that's the only way to do it, and would love to see more, but I don't necessarily think looking for protocol _conformance_ (as opposed to adoption, or some other method) is the best approach.

I know of only two users in the real world: @wasnotrice and [libgit2/objective-git](https://github.com/libgit2/objective-git). I'd rather it be a little harder to use than for users to accidentally have it fire on them. I mean, take a look at [the PR that introduced the opt-out feature](https://github.com/specta/specta/pull/131/files): it includes a code comment that says \"If you're seeing a crash here then...\", which I think is a pretty bad experience for users. (Sorry if that sounds harsh--I think the set of PRs that @paweldudek sent are a massive improvement on the whole! I just think that code comment highlights the issue we're seeing here.)\n\n> Requires a bit of work for people who already implement this\n\nThis, I think, is the biggest problem with changing how it currently works. I don't want to change an API that people rely upon. https://github.com/specta/specta/pull/149 does that, and users who use the feature are going to have to make changes to keep up. I think it's worth it to make sure that's absolutely necessary in this case, and whether they may be a better approach to global before/after each as a whole.\n. That sounds fine to me. I think whitelisting sounds pretty safe.\n\n> I'm pretty sure this issue is unavoidable even with whitelisting mechanism\n\n@paweldudek Can you explain your thoughts a bit? From what I can tell, the problem here is that @wasnotrice is trying to opt-out _before_ his class is picked up by Specta's code, so he needed to find a way to dynamically opt-out in time. With a whitelisting mechanism, users won't accidentally be opted-in, so they won't have to race Specta in order to prevent a crash. :snail: \n. Thank _you_! :100: \n. Is `NLRecord` part of your application target, your test target, or both? If it's included in both your application and test target, then it's actually two different classes, and you may see both of them registered. Just a theory! :bulb: \n. @valerius Great resource, thanks for the link! :+1: \n. Potentially related to https://github.com/Quick/Quick/issues/373, with a proposed solution here: https://github.com/Quick/Quick/issues/439.\n. Thanks for the issue, @mickeyreiss!! Super cool stuff. :gift_heart: \n\nhttps://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/328 solved a very similar issue in Quick. From the commit messages:\n\n> XCTAssert macros must use some internal machinery to report failures. Quick specs don't have the correct state to report failures, but the XCTestRun objects passed to the -[XCTestCase performTest:] method do. Use those instead.\n\nPerhaps Specta (and I imagine Quick will have to do this as well) could achieve a similar solution for test expectations by ensuring that `XCTestExpectation` objects interact with the current `XCTestRun`, not the `SPTSpec` itself. Maybe override `-[SPTSpec -expectationWithDescription:]`, like so?\n\n``` objc\n// SPTSpec.m\n\n- (XCTestExpectation *)expectationWithDescription:(NSString *)description {\n  // Specta stores the current test run in a property called `spt_run`.\n  // This is the test run passed to `-[XCTestCase performTest:]`.\n  return [self.spt_run expectationWithDescription:description];\n}\n```\n\n> All this with the caveat that I'd recommend simply using Expecta's (or [Nimble's](https://github.com/Quick/Nimble)) asynchronous expectations.\n\nI'm curious, though--why does this pull request pass the CI? Shouldn't it be crashing?\n\nThis internal wackiness around `XCTAssert` macros and `XCTestExpectation` objects is confusing. I'll try to reach out to the XCTest team to see what the dealio is. If anyone wants to file a radar, that'd be swell, too! :+1: \n. The issue would manifest with any consumer of `+[XCTestCase testInvocations]`, in which a different set of tests was generated between two test runs.\n\nIt would be great to create a sample project that demonstrates this. We could then encourage commenters on this, https://github.com/Quick/Quick/issues/219, and https://github.com/Quick/Quick/issues/427 to \"dupe\" a master Radar. It's about time we try to effectively communicate what we need to Apple.\n\nNo promises, but I'll try to get to this sometime this weekend. If someone beats me to it, I'd be much obliged. \u2764\ufe0f \n. Oh, hmm, good question... I would assume that running the tests via the command line would not affect the test navigator, so yes, that does seem like a reasonable workaround.\n. If you use Specta or Quick and are disappointed with tests disappearing in Xcode's Test Navigator, tests lingering in the Test Navigator despite no longer being defined, or even tests not being run, please read and duplicate this radar: https://openradar.appspot.com/26028557.\n\nXcode does not provide the Specta or Quick maintainers with an API to address these problems. The best way to contribute to fixing these issues is to communicate to the Apple XCTest team that this is a use case we wish they'd support better. The best way I know to do that is to ask you all to re-submit https://openradar.appspot.com/26028557. \ud83d\ude47 \n. Thanks! Every little bit counts. \ud83d\udcaf \n. @StatusReport That's awesome, thanks!! \ud83d\udc93  Raising awareness is very valuable -- if more people file radars or mention this to Apple engineers, the problem is more likely to be addressed. Every radar dupe counts.\n. @robb Oh, good point.\n\nLet's merge this sucker.\n. @rsaunders100 One alternative is to use the [Kiwi testing framework](https://github.com/allending/Kiwi) still supports OCUnit test bundles (for the time being), and has syntax very similar to Specta's.\n\nIf your project uses Specta and Expecta, you will have to change the assertions from `EXP_expect(subject).to` to the Kiwi syntax,`[subject should]`.

Quick specs don't have the correct state to report failures, but the XCTestRun objects passed to the -[XCTestCase performTest:] method do. Use those instead.\n\nPerhaps Specta (and I imagine Quick will have to do this as well) could achieve a similar solution for test expectations by ensuring that `XCTestExpectation` objects interact with the current `XCTestRun`, not the `SPTSpec` itself. Maybe override `-[SPTSpec -expectationWithDescription:]`, like so?\n\n``` objc\n// SPTSpec.m\n\n- (XCTestExpectation *)expectationWithDescription:(NSString *)description {\n  // Specta stores the current test run in a property called `spt_run`.\n  // This is the test run passed to `-[XCTestCase performTest:]`.\n  return [self.spt_run expectationWithDescription:description];\n}\n```\n\n> All this with the caveat that I'd recommend simply using Expecta's (or [Nimble's](https://github.com/Quick/Nimble)) asynchronous expectations.\n\nI'm curious, though--why does this pull request pass the CI? Shouldn't it be crashing?\n\nThis internal wackiness around `XCTAssert` macros and `XCTestExpectation` objects is confusing. I'll try to reach out to the XCTest team to see what the dealio is. If anyone wants to file a radar, that'd be swell, too! :+1: \n. The issue would manifest with any consumer of `+[XCTestCase testInvocations]`, in which a different set of tests was generated between two test runs.\n\nIt would be great to create a sample project that demonstrates this. We could then encourage commenters on this, https://github.com/Quick/Quick/issues/219, and https://github.com/Quick/Quick/issues/427 to \"dupe\" a master Radar. It's about time we try to effectively communicate what we need to Apple.\n\nNo promises, but I'll try to get to this sometime this weekend. If someone beats me to it, I'd be much obliged. \u2764\ufe0f \n. Oh, hmm, good question... I would assume that running the tests via the command line would not affect the test navigator, so yes, that does seem like a reasonable workaround.\n. If you use Specta or Quick and are disappointed with tests disappearing in Xcode's Test Navigator, tests lingering in the Test Navigator despite no longer being defined, or even tests not being run, please read and duplicate this radar: https://openradar.appspot.com/26028557.\n\nXcode does not provide the Specta or Quick maintainers with an API to address these problems. The best way to contribute to fixing these issues is to communicate to the Apple XCTest team that this is a use case we wish they'd support better. The best way I know to do that is to ask you all to re-submit https://openradar.appspot.com/26028557. \ud83d\ude47 \n. Thanks! Every little bit counts. \ud83d\udcaf \n. @StatusReport That's awesome, thanks!! \ud83d\udc93  Raising awareness is very valuable -- if more people file radars or mention this to Apple engineers, the problem is more likely to be addressed. Every radar dupe counts.\n. @robb Oh, good point.\n\nLet's merge this sucker.\n. ",

I've been thinking about this for a bit of time and I'm pretty sure that I'd rather have a way of blacklisting classes rather than having a way of whitelisting. That way you keep backwards compatibility + you can still work around issue described here. \n\nWould that work for OCMock? Is there a base class that could be marked that way? We could apply the same thing to our beloved `UIAccessibilitySafeCategory__NSObject`. \n\n@tonyarnold @orta @robb what do you guys think? \n. @bwaresiak the problem here is that you're not using `it` and `beforeEach` blocks in `sharedExamplesFor`. Under the hood they behave just like a describe block (which can be passed some additional info). \n\nThus the appropriate approach would be:\n\n```\nsharedExamplesFor(@\"shared example\", ^(NSDictionary* data)\n{\n    beforeEach(^{\n        NSString *something = data[SBEventKey];\n    });\n\n    it(@\"should work\", ^{\n        expect(something).toNot.beNil();\n        expect(something).to.equal(@\"something\");\n    });\n});\n```\n\nAnd it is absolutely legal (actually required) to use `it` with shared behaviours.

Docs are a bit more specific:\n\n> The runtime sends initialize to each class in a program just before the class, or any class that inherits from it, is sent its first message from within the program. The runtime sends the initialize message to classes in a thread-safe manner. Superclasses receive this message before their subclasses. The superclass implementation may be called multiple times if subclasses do not implement initialize\u2014the runtime will call the inherited implementation\u2014or if subclasses explicitly call [super initialize]. If you want to protect yourself from being run multiple times, you can structure your implementation along these lines:\n> \n> Because initialize is called in a thread-safe manner and the order of initialize being called on different classes is not guaranteed, it\u2019s important to do the minimum amount of work necessary in initialize methods. Specifically, any code that takes locks that might be required by other classes in their initialize methods is liable to lead to deadlocks. Therefore you should not rely on initialize for complex initialization, and should instead limit it to straightforward, class local initialization.\n\nIt seems that Aviary is doing some weird stuff in their initialize method which then leads to this crash. \n\nNow the reason why I think this will not work. Code responsible for both blacklisting and whitelisting is nearly the same:\n\nBlacklisting:\n\n```\nclass_conformsToProtocol(aClass, @protocol(SPTExcludeGlobalBeforeAfterEach)) == NO\n```\n\nWhitelisting:\n\n```\nclass_conformsToProtocol(aClass, @protocol(SPTIncludeGlobalBeforeAfterEach)) == YES\n```\n\nand thus I don't see any reason why it will not call `+[NSObject initialize]` as well, which will, unfortunately, result in the same issue as @wasnotrice described. \n\nThe real solution here would be to add logic that somehow checks whether a class conforms to protocol without actually initializing it. I'm not sure how `class_conformsToProtocol` behaves and whether it actually initializes classes. \n\nAnother thing you can try is to avoid `NSClassFromString(@\"AVYPhotoEditorCustomization\");` and use `objc_lookUpClass` which is a bit more low-level and might actually not call `+[NSObject initialize]`. \n. So I made a quick test. I've created a class `Test` with `+[NSObject initialize]` overridden. \n\nI've put a breakpoint in the aforementioned method and checked whether it was called for specific scenarios:\n- Without any additional action `+[NSObject initialize]` was called\n- Adding exclude protocol via category for `Test`: `+[NSObject initialize]` was not called\n- Adding exclude protocol via `NSClassFromString`: `+[NSObject initialize]` was not called\n- Adding exclude protocol via `objc_lookUpClass`: `+[NSObject initialize]` was not called\n\n@wasnotrice could you please check what hits `+[AVYPhotoEditorCustomization initialize]` if it has the exclude protocol added? \n. @modocache no problem! \n\nSo the issue @wasnotrice is seeing is caused by Aviary SDK hitting an assertion in their `[NSObject initialize]` method (which sounds like a horrible design, but that's a different story :wink:). Specta tries to send `beforeEach` (as we can see in the stack trace) message to that class, which triggers `initialize`, which then results in an exception. \n\n`initialize` method is, according to docs, sent before first message is received by given class. And is sent only once per given class (however since some classes do not implement it superclasses can receive this call multiple times). \n\n@wasnotrice noted that he tried to exclude that class using previous method with blacklisting protocol. However that did not work and the exception was still raised. \n\nNow there are two possibilities here. Either previous blacklisting mechanism was broken (as it allowed that class to somehow slip through, in this case I'm 100% for changing to whitelisting) or something else triggered that `[NSObject initialize]` call (that's why I'd love to see the stack trace for this exception when blacklisting is added). \n\nIt is possible that code for adding blacklisting protocol somehow resulted in an `initialize` message being sent to `AVYPhotoEditorCustomization`, but I'm not sure how is that possible as my simple test confirmed that using\n- `objc_lookUpClass`\n- `NSClassFromString`\n\ndoes not trigger `initialize`. \n\nAnd the opt-out mechanism works at the same time as opt-in mechanism so, from behavior perspective, there should be no difference between adding a blacklisting/whitelisting here (aka the `ClassesWithClassMethod` function). \n\nAlso, I sort of convinced myself that whitelisting might be a better idea - it's way more complicated to explain what to do if you don't want to use global before/after each methods rather than explain what to do if you want to have them. \n\n> Maybe it's just me, but I struggle to think of when this feature might be necessary.\n\nI might be opposing this a bit as I know how many global hooks like that we have in our codebase and my subconscious tells me it's gonna be quite a lot of work to update all our private pods to make specs work again :wink:\n. @orta :+1:, we're doing the same thing. \n. I agree with @orta on this one, Specta's supposed to provide DSL for BDD-like tests. Nothing more. \n\nExpecta's responsibility is to provide set of assertions for, well, asserting whether certain behaviour occurred. \n\nThis feels like a specific matcher that leaked into Spectas internal architecture, especially this method: \n\n``` objc\n- (void)spt_checkThis:(id)obj {\n  SPTCheckerObj *checkObj = [SPTCheckerObj new];\n  checkObj.obj = obj;\n  checkObj.checkBlock = ^(id checkingObj) {\n    XCTAssertNil(checkingObj);\n  };\n  @synchronized(self.checkerObjs) {\n    [self.checkerObjs addObject:checkObj];\n  }\n}\n```\n\nas it actually contains a matcher (which should be a part of Expecta). Perhaps it is possible to extend Specta to provide sort of generic interface which Expecta could use and that would solve your problem?\n\nAlso, personally I just write a test that contains an `@autorelease` and a `__weak` variable before it and then just use Expecta to check whether object has been released. It's a bit longer but it does the trick :wink:\n. @ExtremeMan do you happen to have any setup logic outside of `beforeEach`/`afterEach`/`it` blocks? \n\nFrom what I can tell from the stack trace you're attempting to call `+[SKZTournamentSummary addMatchCodeTournament:forContext:]` method while Specta is preparing a test suite. \n\nA general rule of thumb is that you should keep all your setup logic in `beforeEach`/`beforeAll` methods, putting it outside causes it to run before tests are actually executed, which should not be supported. \n\nIf this is not the case - could you please paste a few lines from your spec file that cause this error? Or prepare an example project? \n. Ok, I now see I should've referenced @MattFoley for the comment above, sorry! \n. My assumption is that `xctool` loads testing bundle a little bit earlier than regular `xcodebuild` and your environment is just not set up correctly yet. Since Specta prepares all tests the moment spec classes are initialised (aka accessed for the first time via `+[XCTestSuite allTests]`) this might cause your tests to crash. \n\nI assume you're setting up Core Data stack somewhere in your App Delegate. One could do a simple tests and see which gets called first in `xcodebuild` and `xctool` - the Specta test initialisation (aka code between `before`/`after`/`it` blocks) or the app delegate callbacks. \n\nLast but not leasts it might be a good idea to mention this in docs. :+1: \n. @ExtremeMan I assume that means no App Delegate is created when test bundle is opened? If so then there's the root reason for this issue. \n. This has already been resolved https://github.com/specta/specta/pull/80. @orta yet another one to close :wink:\n. @robb I think you can close this one :wink: \n. I've been thinking about this for a bit of time and I'm pretty sure that I'd rather have a way of blacklisting classes rather than having a way of whitelisting. That way you keep backwards compatibility + you can still work around issue described here. \n\nWould that work for OCMock? Is there a base class that could be marked that way? We could apply the same thing to our beloved `UIAccessibilitySafeCategory__NSObject`. \n\n@tonyarnold @orta @robb what do you guys think? \n. @bwaresiak the problem here is that you're not using `it` and `beforeEach` blocks in `sharedExamplesFor`. Under the hood they behave just like a describe block (which can be passed some additional info). \n\nThus the appropriate approach would be:\n\n```\nsharedExamplesFor(@\"shared example\", ^(NSDictionary* data)\n{\n    beforeEach(^{\n        NSString *something = data[SBEventKey];\n    });\n\n    it(@\"should work\", ^{\n        expect(something).toNot.beNil();\n        expect(something).to.equal(@\"something\");\n    });\n});\n```\n\nAnd it is absolutely legal (actually required) to use `it` with shared behaviours. The fact that your tests were passing in the first place is probably because you passed in a simple dictionary to your `itShouldBehaveLike` rather than a block that generates a dict, tho I'm not 100% sure about this. \n\n@orta this probably means a better documentation on shared examples is needed, there were two issues where people reported problems with using them. (other issue: https://github.com/specta/specta/issues/103)\n.

Docs are a bit more specific:\n\n> The runtime sends initialize to each class in a program just before the class, or any class that inherits from it, is sent its first message from within the program. The runtime sends the initialize message to classes in a thread-safe manner. Superclasses receive this message before their subclasses. The superclass implementation may be called multiple times if subclasses do not implement initialize\u2014the runtime will call the inherited implementation\u2014or if subclasses explicitly call [super initialize]. If you want to protect yourself from being run multiple times, you can structure your implementation along these lines:\n> \n> Because initialize is called in a thread-safe manner and the order of initialize being called on different classes is not guaranteed, it\u2019s important to do the minimum amount of work necessary in initialize methods. Specifically, any code that takes locks that might be required by other classes in their initialize methods is liable to lead to deadlocks. Therefore you should not rely on initialize for complex initialization, and should instead limit it to straightforward, class local initialization.\n\nIt seems that Aviary is doing some weird stuff in their initialize method which then leads to this crash. \n\nNow the reason why I think this will not work. Code responsible for both blacklisting and whitelisting is nearly the same:\n\nBlacklisting:\n\n```\nclass_conformsToProtocol(aClass, @protocol(SPTExcludeGlobalBeforeAfterEach)) == NO\n```\n\nWhitelisting:\n\n```\nclass_conformsToProtocol(aClass, @protocol(SPTIncludeGlobalBeforeAfterEach)) == YES\n```\n\nand thus I don't see any reason why it will not call `+[NSObject initialize]` as well, which will, unfortunately, result in the same issue as @wasnotrice described. \n\nThe real solution here would be to add logic that somehow checks whether a class conforms to protocol without actually initializing it. I'm not sure how `class_conformsToProtocol` behaves and whether it actually initializes classes. \n\nAnother thing you can try is to avoid `NSClassFromString(@\"AVYPhotoEditorCustomization\");` and use `objc_lookUpClass` which is a bit more low-level and might actually not call `+[NSObject initialize]`. \n. So I made a quick test. I've created a class `Test` with `+[NSObject initialize]` overridden. \n\nI've put a breakpoint in the aforementioned method and checked whether it was called for specific scenarios:\n- Without any additional action `+[NSObject initialize]` was called\n- Adding exclude protocol via category for `Test`: `+[NSObject initialize]` was not called\n- Adding exclude protocol via `NSClassFromString`: `+[NSObject initialize]` was not called\n- Adding exclude protocol via `objc_lookUpClass`: `+[NSObject initialize]` was not called\n\n@wasnotrice could you please check what hits `+[AVYPhotoEditorCustomization initialize]` if it has the exclude protocol added? \n. @modocache no problem! \n\nSo the issue @wasnotrice is seeing is caused by Aviary SDK hitting an assertion in their `[NSObject initialize]` method (which sounds like a horrible design, but that's a different story :wink:). Specta tries to send `beforeEach` (as we can see in the stack trace) message to that class, which triggers `initialize`, which then results in an exception. \n\n`initialize` method is, according to docs, sent before first message is received by given class. And is sent only once per given class (however since some classes do not implement it superclasses can receive this call multiple times). \n\n@wasnotrice noted that he tried to exclude that class using previous method with blacklisting protocol. However that did not work and the exception was still raised. \n\nNow there are two possibilities here. Either previous blacklisting mechanism was broken (as it allowed that class to somehow slip through, in this case I'm 100% for changing to whitelisting) or something else triggered that `[NSObject initialize]` call (that's why I'd love to see the stack trace for this exception when blacklisting is added). \n\nIt is possible that code for adding blacklisting protocol somehow resulted in an `initialize` message being sent to `AVYPhotoEditorCustomization`, but I'm not sure how is that possible as my simple test confirmed that using\n- `objc_lookUpClass`\n- `NSClassFromString`\n\ndoes not trigger `initialize`. \n\nAnd the opt-out mechanism works at the same time as opt-in mechanism so, from behavior perspective, there should be no difference between adding a blacklisting/whitelisting here (aka the `ClassesWithClassMethod` function). \n\nAlso, I sort of convinced myself that whitelisting might be a better idea - it's way more complicated to explain what to do if you don't want to use global before/after each methods rather than explain what to do if you want to have them. \n\n> Maybe it's just me, but I struggle to think of when this feature might be necessary.\n\nI might be opposing this a bit as I know how many global hooks like that we have in our codebase and my subconscious tells me it's gonna be quite a lot of work to update all our private pods to make specs work again :wink:\n. @orta :+1:, we're doing the same thing. \n. I agree with @orta on this one, Specta's supposed to provide DSL for BDD-like tests. Nothing more. \n\nExpecta's responsibility is to provide set of assertions for, well, asserting whether certain behaviour occurred. \n\nThis feels like a specific matcher that leaked into Spectas internal architecture, especially this method: \n\n``` objc\n- (void)spt_checkThis:(id)obj {\n  SPTCheckerObj *checkObj = [SPTCheckerObj new];\n  checkObj.obj = obj;\n  checkObj.checkBlock = ^(id checkingObj) {\n    XCTAssertNil(checkingObj);\n  };\n  @synchronized(self.checkerObjs) {\n    [self.checkerObjs addObject:checkObj];\n  }\n}\n```\n\nas it actually contains a matcher (which should be a part of Expecta). Perhaps it is possible to extend Specta to provide sort of generic interface which Expecta could use and that would solve your problem?\n\nAlso, personally I just write a test that contains an `@autorelease` and a `__weak` variable before it and then just use Expecta to check whether object has been released. It's a bit longer but it does the trick :wink:\n. @ExtremeMan do you happen to have any setup logic outside of `beforeEach`/`afterEach`/`it` blocks? \n\nFrom what I can tell from the stack trace you're attempting to call `+[SKZTournamentSummary addMatchCodeTournament:forContext:]` method while Specta is preparing a test suite. \n\nA general rule of thumb is that you should keep all your setup logic in `beforeEach`/`beforeAll` methods, putting it outside causes it to run before tests are actually executed, which should not be supported. \n\nIf this is not the case - could you please paste a few lines from your spec file that cause this error? Or prepare an example project? \n. Ok, I now see I should've referenced @MattFoley for the comment above, sorry! \n. My assumption is that `xctool` loads testing bundle a little bit earlier than regular `xcodebuild` and your environment is just not set up correctly yet. Since Specta prepares all tests the moment spec classes are initialised (aka accessed for the first time via `+[XCTestSuite allTests]`) this might cause your tests to crash. \n\nI assume you're setting up Core Data stack somewhere in your App Delegate. One could do a simple tests and see which gets called first in `xcodebuild` and `xctool` - the Specta test initialisation (aka code between `before`/`after`/`it` blocks) or the app delegate callbacks. \n\nLast but not leasts it might be a good idea to mention this in docs. :+1: \n. @ExtremeMan I assume that means no App Delegate is created when test bundle is opened? If so then there's the root reason for this issue. \n. ",

For instance, if we were to run these tests from the command line instead of the Xcode interface, could we avoid this issue?\n. My team has experienced the tests \"disappearing\" as well, and it makes evaluating results very difficult. Has there been any movement here?\n. Thanks for the quick response @orta, I appreciate it. Has a bug report been filed on this from the Xcode perspective?\n. @orta: I filed a radar on this: Bug ID 25679988: Test cases disappear from the Test Navigator, on 12 April. Apple responded with: \"It seems this issue only manifests when using the Specta framework.

    "MattFoley": "That line of code is in a `context()` block. If I understand the back and forth here, no code should be unwrapped in a `context` or describe block? All executing code for tests should be in `beforeEach`/`beforeAll`/`it` methods? \n\nHere's some pseudo code to give you an idea of what I mean:\n\n```\ndescribe(){\n    context(){\n        //Some setup code\n        it(){}\n        it(){}\n}\n```\n\nIf that's the case, and that's the whole problem, mind if I update the docs saying so?\n. That was the problem! I've fixed our test suite and it now runs just fine with xctool. I'm curious why xcodebuild doesn't complain about this, but xctool does. Mainly just for my own curiosity about the architecture of the two. Any ideas?\n\nRegardless, closing this issue, thanks!\n. So what I gather is that xcodebuild just launches the simulator first, and then queries the test bundle. Querying the test bundle causes Specta to execute any code not inside a before, after, or it block.\n\nTo answer the question, yep, I set up a CoreData stack in my appDelegate for my test host, and because the app delegate was never called, the stack was never setup which leads to an assert. For me, the problem was easily solved by just moving some setup code into before blocks.\n\nThanks for the information!\n. That line of code is in a `context()` block.
