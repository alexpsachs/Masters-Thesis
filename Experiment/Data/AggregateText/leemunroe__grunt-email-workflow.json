While Roadie looks interesting, it re-introduces ruby dep.\n. Sure thing. Few ways you could do it. How do you upload your images to your host?\n\nOne way would be to use the [replace task](https://github.com/leemunroe/grunt-email-workflow/blob/master/grunt/replace.js) and replace the source path with your URL.\n. Hey @oldirony thanks for making the change.\n\nCan somebody else that uses s3 confirm? Maybe @clecompte?\n. Nice one. Does Pardot have an API  / Grunt task that would enable sending these templates to their system?\n. @xavisavvy Definitely I think these would be useful. Now that grunt tasks have their own file in `/grunt` and we have `aliases.yaml` I think that lessens the risk of cluttering the repo.\n. Solid. Glad you got it fixed. And would love to see any of the emails you produce!\n. Interesting. Now I'm wondering why and if I need both `assemble` and `grunt-assemble`. Let me know if you have any recommendations for tidying up dependencies.\n. Where are you trying to use `src: ['<%= paths.src %>/emails/*.hbs']`?\n. I see, glad you got it working. I'm not sure off hand what it was dependent on. \n. I'm guessing the use of `<%= paths.src %>` is dependent on a module you removed, but I could be wrong.\n\nWhat happens if you revert `package.json` back?\n\n```\n\"assemble\": \"^0.4.42\",\n    \"cheerio\": \"^0.19.0\",\n    \"ejs\": \"^2.3.1\",\n    \"express\": \"^4.12.3\",\n    \"grunt\": \"^0.4.5\",\n    \"grunt-assemble\": \"^0.3.1\",\n    \"grunt-autoprefixer\": \"^2.2.0\",\n    \"grunt-aws-s3\": \"^0.13.1\",\n    \"grunt-cdn\": \"^0.6.5\",\n    \"grunt-cloudfiles\": \"^0.3.0\",\n    \"grunt-contrib-clean\": \"^0.6.0\",\n    \"grunt-contrib-imagemin\": \"^1.0.0\",\n    \"grunt-contrib-watch\": \"^0.6.1\",\n    \"grunt-express\": \"^1.4.1\",\n    \"grunt-juice-email\": \"^0.1.3\",\n    \"grunt-litmus\": \"^0.1.8\",\n    \"grunt-mailgun\": \"^1.0.1\",\n    \"grunt-open\": \"^0.2.3\",\n    \"grunt-replace\": \"^0.9.3\",\n    \"grunt-sass\": \"^1.0.0\",\n    \"imagemin-mozjpeg\": \"^5.1.0\",\n    \"load-grunt-config\": \"^0.19.0\",\n    \"load-grunt-tasks\": \"^3.2.0\"\n```\n. I see, yes. How does your `Gruntfile.js` currently look?\n. Not currently. But you could use a flag to set something like that up e.g. `grunt build --template=templateOne` and then modify `aliases.yaml` and `assemble.js` to support it.\n. Sure, take a look at https://github.com/firstandthird/load-grunt-config\n. Has anything changed with the Litmus API recently?\n\n/cc @rodriguezcommaj @jeremypeter\n. Working again\n. @mtsweir Good Q, not sure off hand. Curious if you were able to find a solution for this as it bugged me at first also.\n. Awesome! Would love to see a quick video demo of these in action (I'm not currently a user).\n. You're right. What I've done for other projects (and should probably update this repo) is added another SCSS file for styles that I wanted preserved, and put them in an \"all\" media query e.g.\n\n```\n@media all {\n\n  // External class fix for Outlook.com\n  .ExternalClass {\n    width: 100%;\n  }\n\n  .ExternalClass,\n  .ExternalClass p,\n  .ExternalClass span,\n  .ExternalClass font,\n  .ExternalClass td,\n  .ExternalClass div {\n    line-height: 100%;\n  }\n\n  // Blue link fix for iOS\n  .apple-link a {\n    color: inherit !important;\n    font-family: inherit !important;\n    font-size: inherit !important;\n    font-weight: inherit !important;\n    line-height: inherit !important;\n    text-decoration: none !important;\n  }\n}\n```\n. @danilomatos I think these are warnings for dependencies that are out of date. The workflow should still work though. What happens when you run `grunt`?\n. I'm afraid I don't have a Windows environment to test this on. Can some one try this with latest dependencies and see if that has fixed things?\n. @FGRibreau I think so. Here are the Litmus tests with `height` attribute removed https://litmus.com/checklist/emails/public/8592bc5\n. \ud83c\udf89\n. @adyz Looks like Mailgun updated some things recently for security purposes. The workflow should still work but you'll have to add your own domain and verify it on Mailgun.\r\n\r\nhttp://blog.mailgun.com/domain-verification-changes-for-new-and-existing-domains/\r\n\r\n. @adyz Or you can still use the sandbox but just have to add the recipient as a authorized address https://help.mailgun.com/hc/en-us/articles/217531258. Hey @Mizpah haven't had time to look into this in detail but looks like you've tried the `raw` option which I thought would have worked. I found a slight variation of it [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20129909/mixing-dynamic-precompiled-handlebar-templates-using-assemble). And also a helper someone documented [here](https://gist.github.com/phobia/9110443). Two options worth looking at. I can dig deeper if this doesn't work.. @markhuge Thanks for doing this. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately I wasn't able to get this to work. Played around with it for a while running your branch but didn't see any logs come in. Tried creating a new project with just a gruntfile and grunt-mailgun but no luck either. Tried creating a new Mailgun account and adding a verified email but no luck. Any other ideas what it could be?. All looks good in output\r\n\r\n```\r\n\u279c  grunt-mailgun grunt mailgun -v\r\nInitializing\r\nCommand-line options: --verbose\r\n\r\nReading \"gruntfile.js\" Gruntfile...OK\r\n\r\nRegistering Gruntfile tasks.\r\nInitializing config...OK\r\n\r\nRegistering \"grunt-mailgun\" local Npm module tasks.\r\nReading /Users/lee/Sites/tmp/grunt-mailgun/node_modules/grunt-mailgun/package.json...OK\r\nParsing /Users/lee/Sites/tmp/grunt-mailgun/node_modules/grunt-mailgun/package.json...OK\r\nLoading \"mailgun.js\" tasks...OK\r\n+ mailgun\r\nLoading \"gruntfile.js\" tasks...OK\r\n>> No tasks were registered or unregistered.\r\n\r\nRunning tasks: mailgun\r\n\r\nRunning \"mailgun\" task\r\n\r\nRunning \"mailgun:marketingTemplates\" (mailgun) task\r\nVerifying property mailgun.marketingTemplates exists in config...OK\r\nFiles: test.html\r\nReading test.html...OK\r\n\r\nDone.\r\n```. Awesome working for me now. Thanks @markhuge . @VanGTO Absolutely lets do it. I think the way it is modularized now, where each grunt task has it's own file, makes this great for plugging in new options.. Love this suggestion. Admittedly I usually hack the flow a bit to provide outputs for whatever 3rd party tool/code I'm using e.g. a service that needs `{{ content }}` and `{{ unsubscribe }}` or a rails app that needs .erb templates.\r\n\r\n@taeo All your ideas make sense. `Allow the preview tool to render supported template types`. Maybe you have a good idea here but I imagine that getting quite complex if `server.js` is trying to support more than html.. @taeo Your call. Some times I find it easier to just create a fork and start hacking. But if you want to get something a bit more formal in here to nail down ideas and scope, also sounds good. . Wow impressive work!\r\n\r\nSome things that come to mind after playing with this:\r\n\r\n* It's great that it can support these types. One concern I have though is it might add some confusion to noobs. Cloning this repo and running grunt for the first time usually involves a bit of a learning curve (at least for most email developers I've tested it with). If the ejs/hbs/liquid/php files are in there too (in both `dist` and `src`) it adds to that learning curve. Don't have a preferred solution but wondering if this is something that is turned off by default, or maybe they're in another examples folder, something to help them not being an additional distraction.\r\n* Another thought that comes to mind after playing with this is how do I have just one `src` file that integrates with the other features/commands e.g. I would love to have one email source file that I develop and preview locally, send to Mailgun, send to Litmus, and then send off to my 3rd party service.\r\n* Noticed the PHP issue. It's been a while since I wrote PHP so not sure how to fix off hand. Sidenote: What apps/ESPs are you guys using to send email that use PHP?\r\n\r\n. 1. Good idea.\r\n\r\n2. Exactly. Figured that was the plan, just making sure.\r\n\r\n3. That's what I was thinking. Figured there might be some sort of Wordpress use case but maybe ignore it until someone really wants it.. Oh 3 years ago. I'm not sure. Some sort of secret project no doubt. Likely before we had secrets.json :). This would be amazing. @cjcorney Do you have any ideas or sketches to share to get the conversation going?. 1. This is looking really impressive.\r\n\r\n2. I'm afraid not. I get the same thing using `*.html`. Possibly a bug with https://github.com/markhuge/grunt-mailgun. Have you looked at something like https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-ftp?\r\n\r\nI haven't used it, but looks like you could use this in place of the S3/Cloudfiles task to upload your images directory. Then you would create a CDN option for replacing local paths with your FTP absolute path. . Of course. Feel free to share in this thread so others can see and help also.. For styles like this, you don't want them to be inlined. What you can do is put this styles in to a media query so that the inliner preserves them and doesn't clear them.\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\n@media all {\r\n  // Your styles go here\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe inliner will see the media query and embed these styles in the `<head>` instead of inlining them.. I like it and was doing this locally but wasn't sure if designers would understand it.\n. Closing this. I like it but don't want to have to explain this in the readme. Devs can make this change if they want.\n. Good catch. Do we need both? I think hpricot is enough.\n.

I'm guessing the use of `<%= paths.src %>` is dependent on a module you removed, but I could be wrong.\n\nWhat happens if you revert `package.json` back?\n\n```\n\"assemble\": \"^0.4.42\",\n    \"cheerio\": \"^0.19.0\",\n    \"ejs\": \"^2.3.1\",\n    \"express\": \"^4.12.3\",\n    \"grunt\": \"^0.4.5\",\n    \"grunt-assemble\": \"^0.3.1\",\n    \"grunt-autoprefixer\": \"^2.2.0\",\n    \"grunt-aws-s3\": \"^0.13.1\",\n    \"grunt-cdn\": \"^0.6.5\",\n    \"grunt-cloudfiles\": \"^0.3.0\",\n    \"grunt-contrib-clean\": \"^0.6.0\",\n    \"grunt-contrib-imagemin\": \"^1.0.0\",\n    \"grunt-contrib-watch\": \"^0.6.1\",\n    \"grunt-express\": \"^1.4.1\",\n    \"grunt-juice-email\": \"^0.1.3\",\n    \"grunt-litmus\": \"^0.1.8\",\n    \"grunt-mailgun\": \"^1.0.1\",\n    \"grunt-open\": \"^0.2.3\",\n    \"grunt-replace\": \"^0.9.3\",\n    \"grunt-sass\": \"^1.0.0\",\n    \"imagemin-mozjpeg\": \"^5.1.0\",\n    \"load-grunt-config\": \"^0.19.0\",\n    \"load-grunt-tasks\": \"^3.2.0\"\n```\n. I see, yes. How does your `Gruntfile.js` currently look?\n. Not currently. But you could use a flag to set something like that up e.g. `grunt build --template=templateOne` and then modify `aliases.yaml` and `assemble.js` to support it.\n. Sure, take a look at https://github.com/firstandthird/load-grunt-config\n. Has anything changed with the Litmus API recently?\n\n/cc @rodriguezcommaj @jeremypeter\n. Working again\n. @mtsweir Good Q, not sure off hand. Curious if you were able to find a solution for this as it bugged me at first also.\n. Awesome! Would love to see a quick video demo of these in action (I'm not currently a user).\n. You're right. What I've done for other projects (and should probably update this repo) is added another SCSS file for styles that I wanted preserved, and put them in an \"all\" media query e.g.\n\n```\n@media all {\n\n  // External class fix for Outlook.com\n  .ExternalClass {\n    width: 100%;\n  }\n\n  .ExternalClass,\n  .ExternalClass p,\n  .ExternalClass span,\n  .ExternalClass font,\n  .ExternalClass td,\n  .ExternalClass div {\n    line-height: 100%;\n  }\n\n  // Blue link fix for iOS\n  .apple-link a {\n    color: inherit !important;\n    font-family: inherit !important;\n    font-size: inherit !important;\n    font-weight: inherit !important;\n    line-height: inherit !important;\n    text-decoration: none !important;\n  }\n}\n```\n. @danilomatos I think these are warnings for dependencies that are out of date. The workflow should still work though. What happens when you run `grunt`?\n. I'm afraid I don't have a Windows environment to test this on. Can some one try this with latest dependencies and see if that has fixed things?\n. @FGRibreau I think so. Here are the Litmus tests with `height` attribute removed https://litmus.com/checklist/emails/public/8592bc5\n. \ud83c\udf89\n. @adyz Looks like Mailgun updated some things recently for security purposes. The workflow should still work but you'll have to add your own domain and verify it on Mailgun.\r\n\r\nhttp://blog.mailgun.com/domain-verification-changes-for-new-and-existing-domains/\r\n\r\n. @adyz Or you can still use the sandbox but just have to add the recipient as a authorized address https://help.mailgun.com/hc/en-us/articles/217531258. Hey @Mizpah haven't had time to look into this in detail but looks like you've tried the `raw` option which I thought would have worked. I found a slight variation of it [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20129909/mixing-dynamic-precompiled-handlebar-templates-using-assemble). And also a helper someone documented [here](https://gist.github.com/phobia/9110443). Two options worth looking at. I can dig deeper if this doesn't work.. @markhuge Thanks for doing this. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately I wasn't able to get this to work. Played around with it for a while running your branch but didn't see any logs come in. Tried creating a new project with just a gruntfile and grunt-mailgun but no luck either. Tried creating a new Mailgun account and adding a verified email but no luck. Any other ideas what it could be?. All looks good in output\r\n\r\n```\r\n\u279c  grunt-mailgun grunt mailgun -v\r\nInitializing\r\nCommand-line options: --verbose\r\n\r\nReading \"gruntfile.js\" Gruntfile...OK\r\n\r\nRegistering Gruntfile tasks.\r\nInitializing config...OK\r\n\r\nRegistering \"grunt-mailgun\" local Npm module tasks.\r\nReading /Users/lee/Sites/tmp/grunt-mailgun/node_modules/grunt-mailgun/package.json...OK\r\nParsing /Users/lee/Sites/tmp/grunt-mailgun/node_modules/grunt-mailgun/package.json...OK\r\nLoading \"mailgun.js\" tasks...OK\r\n+ mailgun\r\nLoading \"gruntfile.js\" tasks...OK\r\n>> No tasks were registered or unregistered.\r\n\r\nRunning tasks: mailgun\r\n\r\nRunning \"mailgun\" task\r\n\r\nRunning \"mailgun:marketingTemplates\" (mailgun) task\r\nVerifying property mailgun.marketingTemplates exists in config...OK\r\nFiles: test.html\r\nReading test.html...OK\r\n\r\nDone.\r\n```. Awesome working for me now. Thanks @markhuge . @VanGTO Absolutely lets do it. I think the way it is modularized now, where each grunt task has it's own file, makes this great for plugging in new options.. Love this suggestion. Admittedly I usually hack the flow a bit to provide outputs for whatever 3rd party tool/code I'm using e.g. a service that needs `{{ content }}` and `{{ unsubscribe }}` or a rails app that needs .erb templates.\r\n\r\n@taeo All your ideas make sense. `Allow the preview tool to render supported template types`. Maybe you have a good idea here but I imagine that getting quite complex if `server.js` is trying to support more than html.. @taeo Your call. Some times I find it easier to just create a fork and start hacking. But if you want to get something a bit more formal in here to nail down ideas and scope, also sounds good. . Wow impressive work!\r\n\r\nSome things that come to mind after playing with this:\r\n\r\n* It's great that it can support these types. One concern I have though is it might add some confusion to noobs. Cloning this repo and running grunt for the first time usually involves a bit of a learning curve (at least for most email developers I've tested it with). If the ejs/hbs/liquid/php files are in there too (in both `dist` and `src`) it adds to that learning curve. Don't have a preferred solution but wondering if this is something that is turned off by default, or maybe they're in another examples folder, something to help them not being an additional distraction.\r\n* Another thought that comes to mind after playing with this is how do I have just one `src` file that integrates with the other features/commands e.g. I would love to have one email source file that I develop and preview locally, send to Mailgun, send to Litmus, and then send off to my 3rd party service.\r\n* Noticed the PHP issue. It's been a while since I wrote PHP so not sure how to fix off hand. Sidenote: What apps/ESPs are you guys using to send email that use PHP?\r\n\r\n. 1. Good idea.\r\n\r\n2. Exactly. Figured that was the plan, just making sure.\r\n\r\n3. That's what I was thinking. Figured there might be some sort of Wordpress use case but maybe ignore it until someone really wants it.. Oh 3 years ago. I'm not sure. Some sort of secret project no doubt. Likely before we had secrets.json :). This would be amazing. @cjcorney Do you have any ideas or sketches to share to get the conversation going?. 1. This is looking really impressive.\r\n\r\n2. I'm afraid not. I get the same thing using `*.html`. Possibly a bug with https://github.com/markhuge/grunt-mailgun. Have you looked at something like https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-ftp?\r\n\r\nI haven't used it, but looks like you could use this in place of the S3/Cloudfiles task to upload your images directory. Then you would create a CDN option for replacing local paths with your FTP absolute path. . Of course. Feel free to share in this thread so others can see and help also.. For styles like this, you don't want them to be inlined. What you can do is put this styles in to a media query so that the inliner preserves them and doesn't clear them.\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\n@media all {\r\n  // Your styles go here\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe inliner will see the media query and embed these styles in the `<head>` instead of inlining them..

I'll update shortly.\n. @leemunroe - This should be good to go. The PR did merge in the latest secrets PR that landed on master. Cheers!\n. If this get's merged, we'll want to track #21 and adhere to this standard.\nFYI @clecompte @leemunroe \n\n``` js\n s3: {\n  options: {\n    key: '<%= secrets.s3.key %>', // define this in secrets.json\n    secret: '<%= secrets.s3.secret %>', // define this in secrets.json\n    cont....\n  }\n}\n```\n. @leemunroe - my gut feeling is that teams would want common, non sensitive account settings such as `litmus.company` or `cloudfiles.region` etc... to be saved in their repo.\n\nWith respect to sending - recipients and subjects, i'd recommend something like so (so it's not fixed).\n\n``` js\n        mailgun: {\n          mailer: {\n            options: {\n              key: '<%= secrets.mailgun.api_key %>',\n              sender: grunt.option('from') || 'you@youremail.com',\n              recipient: grunt.option('to') || 'you@youremail.com',\n              subject: grunt.option('subject') || '[TEST] - Subject n/a'\n            },\n            src: ['preview/'+grunt.option('template')]\n          }\n        },\n```\n\n**Send with all the following options other than template as optional:**\n\n```\ngrunt mailgun --template=branded.html --from=you@email.com --to=you@email.com,optionalsecond@email.com --subject=\"My custom subject\"\n```\n\nThis suggested format could work in combination with some of your ideas.\nWhat do you think? \n. @leemunroe - Cool.

This issue is still on master.\n. @clecompte - Sorry, I'm still seeing quite a few inconsistencies and bugs\n\n**Imagemin:**\n- `cloudfiles` task is still serving from `./src/img/` (not the optimized path `./dist/img/`)\n- when running `grunt` (default tasks), the complied templates are still serving images from `./src/img/`, so any `send` or forthcoming browser-previews wouldn't be correct.\n\n**AWS S3:**\n- This is serving from `./src/img` (not the min files from `./dist/img`)\n\n**Replace S3:**\n- This is doing essentially the same thing as the `cdn` task. Ideally the cdn task would have options for `cloudfiles` and `aws_s3` respectively.\n\nHope this comes across as constructive.\n. @clecompte - Sorry for tossing imagemin in there.\n\nThe cdn task could be updated like so:\n\n```\n        cdn: {\n          cloudfiles: {\n            options: {\n              cdn: '<%= secrets.cloudfiles.uri %>', // See README for secrets.json or replace this with your cdn uri\n              flatten: true,\n              supportedTypes: 'html'\n            },\n            cwd: './dist/',\n            dest: './dist/',\n            src: ['*.html']\n          },\n          aws: {\n            options: {\n              cdn: '<%= secrets.s3.bucketpath %>', // See README for secrets.json or replace this with your cdn uri\n              flatten: true,\n              supportedTypes: 'html'\n            },\n            cwd: './dist/',\n            dest: './dist/',\n            src: ['*.html']\n          }\n        },\n```\n\nThe current `cdnify` alias would need to be updated like so:\n\n```\ngrunt.registerTask('cdnify', ['default','cloudfiles','cdn:cloudfiles']);\n```\n. @brandonb927 - My 10\u00a2 is that this is a starter kit that already supports a css pre-processor. If you prefer less to sass, you can download this project and make those preference-based changes.\n. @martinbutler it's possible to escape the line using a backslash\n\n```\n\\{{ first_name }}\n```\n\n**OR**\n\nYou can use an alternate syntax such as:\n`[[ first_name ]]` > `{{ first_name }}`\n\nThen and then add a custom regex via grunt task to replace it:\n\n```\npatterns: [ {\n    match: /(\\[\\[)([^\\]\\r\\n]+)(\\]\\])/gi,\n    replacement: '{{ $2 }}'\n}]\n```\n\nBetter to post a new issue / question in an issue that isn't closed :)\n. @leemunroe - Word.

I was doing that on a couple projects with the following components:\n- Buttons\n- Horizontal\n- Signatures\n- Social Badges\n. @xavierartot - Checkout #33 and let us know if that's a preferable alternative to browsersync. It supports watch, live reload, browser preview(s) and quick nav to jump between compiled templates.\n\nIf you aren't feeling it, I can provide some sample code for BrowserSync to work with this project.\n. More directly, I'd consider adding a task. What's important is that `watch` is called after `browserSync`.\n`grunt.registerTask('giddyup', ['default','browserSync', 'watch']);`\n. @toby1kenobi - It's not you. The cloudfiles task was never updated properly when imagemin was implemented. We'll get a fix / PR for this.\n\n[Line 173 of Gruntfile.js](https://github.com/leemunroe/grunt-email-workflow/blob/master/Gruntfile.js#L173) should be `'src': '<%= paths.dist_img %>/*',` NOT `'src': '<%= paths.src_img %>/*',`\n.

This is definitely a complicated. I think there's some refactoring/options to watch that can make this better and faster.\r\n\r\n* `scss` changes should trigger scss, assemble, juice, and replace tasks for **all** templates.\r\n* `layouts`, `partials`, and `data` changes should trigger assemble, juice, and replace tasks for **all** templates.\r\n* `img` changes should trigger only imagemin task\r\n\r\nTaking it a step further, it's possible to incorporate something like the following that would process only a subset of `src/emails/` templates.\r\n```\r\ngrunt watch:specific --files=\"filename_or_pattern\"\r\n\r\ngrunt build:specific --files=\"filename_or_pattern\"\r\n``` \r\n\r\n. No worries. I'll give this a spin when I have a second. I'm currently trying to wrap up #87 if you have any opinions or desire to help test that out.. Hey @macbookandrew \r\n\r\nI just pushed up a fork on my branch for [build times and options](https://github.com/taeo/grunt-email-design/tree/feature/build-time-and-options). It addresses build times as well as watch related options.\r\n\r\nIt's not \"automagic\" unfortunately, but here's a use case that would only watch for and process:\r\n* template updates matching the name `*2016-08*`. \r\n* scss updates get compiled, but only applied to the afore mentioned templates\r\n* _(Any layouts, data, or partials trigger a complete rebuild of all templates)_\r\n\r\n```\r\ngrunt preview --template=\"*2016-08*\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Additional grunt option** `--noinline` can be passed if you don't want css styles inlined (will be preserved in `<style>` tag.\r\n```\r\ngrunt preview --template=\"*2016-08*\" --noinline\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet me know if you're willing to give the branch a spin and provide any thoughts, feedback, or questions.. Solid. Thanks for testing!\r\n\r\nThere's a little tidying up and README updates to make. Other than that, should we give it a little time and prompt a few more people to test, or just go PR and done?. @macbookandrew - welcome back! Hope you had a good vacay. No rush here. Would love to have input + further testing to see if it meets your needs and is easy enough to use this way.. You'd have to remove the `flatten: true` option as well from `/grunt/assemble.js`\n\nThe downside(s) to this currently are:\n- The preview UI naively looks for `/dist/*.html` files, so template select will be blank. \n- You get more of the tree than you might want `/dist/src/emails/<templates + subdirs>`\n- css inlining and a number of other tasks don't compensate for depth in `/dist` at the moment\n. I'd stay away from near-duplicate grunt tasks.\n\nIdeal approach for what you're wanting to do would be to go through every grunt task and make sure it supported directory depth + add recursion to the preview app's template finder.\n\nAnother option would be to just prefix all your emails as opposed to having hierarchy. `/emails/back_<template_name>.hbs`\n\nI personally don't foresee the need to support directory structure in `dist`, but maybe that's just me and/or I don't see the full picture.\n\nCheers\n. Nice. Thanks for posting your solution :+1: \n. Not answering your question here, but avoiding ruby dependencies is pry a good move to keep this project more accessible. Roadie is ruby-centric.\n. Don't wrap your php in handlebars notation. PHP tags will be passed through assemble / handlebars unmodified if you write them as normal.\n`{{{ <?= $firstname; ?> }}}` should be simply `<?php echo $firstname; ?>`\n\nNOTE: The previewer will not parse or display your php code and the templates will still have .html extensions. You can go the extra mile to support .php extensions.\n\nin file `grunt/assemble.js` add:\n\n```\noptions:\n    ext: '.php'\n```\n\nThen for preview you'd have to add [express-php](https://www.npmjs.com/package/php-express) via npm and in file `server.js` adapt the view engine from `ejs` to `php`\n.

Installing and running `npm install && run task` is equally simple in both worlds.\r\n\r\nIf there's a huge cry for gulp over grunt, we could just port everything. . @ericdfields - data formats / naming conventions are key for sure. I do like the consideration of not inlining styles, presuming that the final engine will do that.\r\n\r\n@leemunroe - Express Server comes with a number of [template engines](https://github.com/expressjs/express/wiki?_ga=1.23539322.1742926776.1490762831#template-engines) supported out of the box, and many, many others from 3rd parties. I don't see that being too complicated to add supported engines and then conditionally process the preview based on the template extension / engine. Hypothetically of course.\r\n\r\nPushing this to the next level - should we make a bit of a spec, go YOLO style and just start a fork to play with, other?. Some quick research and feasibility tests are looking \ud83d\udc4d.\r\n\r\n- [x] Create templates with any combination of extensions\r\n- [x] Helper to pass mustache syntax through the compiler\r\n- [x] Express preview handling multiple rending engines based on extension\r\n. Hey @ericdfields, @leemunroe and anyone else interested in testing this out.\r\n\r\nI just got a branch pushed up on my fork for [multiple template engines](https://github.com/taeo/grunt-email-design/tree/feature-multiple-template-engines).\r\n\r\nIt supports `.ejs`, `.liquid`, `.hbs` templates using [consolidate](https://github.com/tj/consolidate.js) (room for many more template engines).\r\nThe caveat is you have to name your `src/emails/` as `filename.<desired-extension>.hbs`\r\n\r\nIt adds a raw helper:\r\n```\r\n{{{{raw}}}}\r\n  whatever your heart desires... or non-rendered hbs code\r\n{{{{/raw}}}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSample data can be created in `/preview/data/` either `.json` or `.yml` by simply adding one of those flavors with the base template name > `_sample.html.hbs` would lookup `/preview/data/_sample.json` or `/preview/data/_sample.yaml`\r\n\r\nThere's room for improvement, but it's a fully functional proof of concept! Look forward to your feedback.\r\n\r\n**caveat** php is in there, but it's broken. There's some awkwardness passing variables into the previewer.. Thanks!\r\n\r\nTo your points.\r\n\r\n1. I vote we should fire up the gh wiki on this project to help elaborate on variations and options. That will help keep the README smaller, and we can include code samples as opposed to including them in the core repo.\r\n\r\n2. Maybe I'm not understanding correctly. Are you saying there's no way to send the `dist/_sample.liquid` for example via mailgun or to litmus fully rendered with the sample data? If I'm tracking... you're correct that doesn't work, but it could. `dist/_sample.liquid` is what you'd send off to your 3rd party service, right?\r\n\r\n3. PHP - not sure how to fix that either at the moment, nor do I care to spend more time trying to figure it out. I don't personally use many apps, or know of any ESP's that are php-driven. Someone else in the community with a hankering for that could patch and PR.... Chris, @romanlelek is mostly correct. \r\n\r\nYou would have to edit `/grunt/aliases.yml` to add a custom series of tasks. You would also need to modify or copy/rename some of the `/grunt/*js` tasks to suit your needs.\r\n\r\nIssue #57 is along these lines as a feature request.. Historical reference - This did not fix the issue #77 (authors words). Hey @jzantua - Can you post a sample of the configuration you're using and confirm it you are using this package (https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-ftp) or something else?. @jzantua - Yep, authentication is definitely required and unsupported. At the very top of the readme for the [ftp-deploy](https://github.com/simonh1000/ftp-deploy) package it says \"(Need sftp? Check out [sftp-upload](https://github.com/pirumpi/sftp-upload))\". . @leemunroe & @clecompte - Looks like the `cloudfiles` task should be updated for the imagemin PR to be consistent.\n\n**suggested cloudfiles task change:**\n`'src': 'src/img/*',` > `'src': 'dist/img/*',`\n. @leemunroe & @clecompte - grunt imagemin does not update html file strings/paths.\nTake a look at [assemble assets](http://assemble.io/docs/options-assets.html).\n. @leemunroe - Yeah, I like that. I'll update shortly.\n. @leemunroe - This should be good to go. The PR did merge in the latest secrets PR that landed on master. Cheers!\n. If this get's merged, we'll want to track #21 and adhere to this standard.\nFYI @clecompte @leemunroe \n\n``` js\n s3: {\n  options: {\n    key: '<%= secrets.s3.key %>', // define this in secrets.json\n    secret: '<%= secrets.s3.secret %>', // define this in secrets.json\n    cont....\n  }\n}\n```\n. @leemunroe - my gut feeling is that teams would want common, non sensitive account settings such as `litmus.company` or `cloudfiles.region` etc... to be saved in their repo.\n\nWith respect to sending - recipients and subjects, i'd recommend something like so (so it's not fixed).\n\n``` js\n        mailgun: {\n          mailer: {\n            options: {\n              key: '<%= secrets.mailgun.api_key %>',\n              sender: grunt.option('from') || 'you@youremail.com',\n              recipient: grunt.option('to') || 'you@youremail.com',\n              subject: grunt.option('subject') || '[TEST] - Subject n/a'\n            },\n            src: ['preview/'+grunt.option('template')]\n          }\n        },\n```\n\n**Send with all the following options other than template as optional:**\n\n```\ngrunt mailgun --template=branded.html --from=you@email.com --to=you@email.com,optionalsecond@email.com --subject=\"My custom subject\"\n```\n\nThis suggested format could work in combination with some of your ideas.\nWhat do you think? \n. @leemunroe - Cool. I agree anyone capable enough dev-wise to use this project (starter kit) can figure out customizing / extending secrets to their liking.\n\nre: Adding options to the command line. I'm either way on it for the project. I personally would make that mod for my local project copies. \n\nCheers. Happy fri.\n. @leemunroe - I have a ready-to-go version of this if you'd like to check it out and provide any thoughts.\n[feature/browser-preview](https://github.com/taeo/grunt-email-design/tree/feature/browser-preview)\n\nAll you need do differently is run `grunt serve` to start the project. It will do all the standard stuff + start up an express server and open the preview UI.\n. @leemunroe - sweet! Glad you like the idea.\n\nWeird issues. Did you do an `npm install` after switching branches?\n\nI just pulled from scratch fine:\n\n```\nmkdir grunt-email-workflow-test; cd grunt-email-workflow-test; git clone git@github.com:taeo/grunt-email-design.git .\n```\n\n```\ngit checkout feature/browser-preview\n```\n\n```\ngit pull origin feature/browser-preview\n```\n\n```\nnpm install\n```\n\n**!!! copy your secrets.json file !!!**\n\n```\ngrunt serve\n```\n. @leemunroe - Excellent. Let me know if you have any changes you'd like to see and I'll send in a PR.\nI know that I'll need to add a server route for `./dist/img` in order for the imagemin #21 to work right.\n. @leemunroe - My 10\u00a2, headlined with\n\n> \"I think this project is a starter kit that works out of the box if you follow the readme.

Your thoughts on my comments?\n. @leemunroe - Bump.\nI can refactor PR #33 to bring up to date with master. I'm using my fork w/ previews on a few projects and loving it...\n. @leemunroe - why closed? This issue is still on master.\n. @clecompte - Sorry, I'm still seeing quite a few inconsistencies and bugs\n\n**Imagemin:**\n- `cloudfiles` task is still serving from `./src/img/` (not the optimized path `./dist/img/`)\n- when running `grunt` (default tasks), the complied templates are still serving images from `./src/img/`, so any `send` or forthcoming browser-previews wouldn't be correct.\n\n**AWS S3:**\n- This is serving from `./src/img` (not the min files from `./dist/img`)\n\n**Replace S3:**\n- This is doing essentially the same thing as the `cdn` task. Ideally the cdn task would have options for `cloudfiles` and `aws_s3` respectively.\n\nHope this comes across as constructive.\n. @clecompte - Sorry for tossing imagemin in there.\n\nThe cdn task could be updated like so:\n\n```\n        cdn: {\n          cloudfiles: {\n            options: {\n              cdn: '<%= secrets.cloudfiles.uri %>', // See README for secrets.json or replace this with your cdn uri\n              flatten: true,\n              supportedTypes: 'html'\n            },\n            cwd: './dist/',\n            dest: './dist/',\n            src: ['*.html']\n          },\n          aws: {\n            options: {\n              cdn: '<%= secrets.s3.bucketpath %>', // See README for secrets.json or replace this with your cdn uri\n              flatten: true,\n              supportedTypes: 'html'\n            },\n            cwd: './dist/',\n            dest: './dist/',\n            src: ['*.html']\n          }\n        },\n```\n\nThe current `cdnify` alias would need to be updated like so:\n\n```\ngrunt.registerTask('cdnify', ['default','cloudfiles','cdn:cloudfiles']);\n```\n. @brandonb927 - My 10\u00a2 is that this is a starter kit that already supports a css pre-processor. If you prefer less to sass, you can download this project and make those preference-based changes.\n. @martinbutler it's possible to escape the line using a backslash\n\n```\n\\{{ first_name }}\n```\n\n**OR**\n\nYou can use an alternate syntax such as:\n`[[ first_name ]]` > `{{ first_name }}`\n\nThen and then add a custom regex via grunt task to replace it:\n\n```\npatterns: [ {\n    match: /(\\[\\[)([^\\]\\r\\n]+)(\\]\\])/gi,\n    replacement: '{{ $2 }}'\n}]\n```\n\nBetter to post a new issue / question in an issue that isn't closed :)\n. @leemunroe - Word. Preference on how we want to go about this and who's doing what?\n\nFYI - @clecompte\n. @leemunroe - Yes, sorry for the silence. I'll get this up to date with master and send the PR.\n\nCheers \n. a'ight @leemunroe - This looks good on my end and is up to date. \nFYI @chrisrowe \n. @leemunroe - Good catch. I caught that on my master, but never hit the feature branch. just cherry picked it and should be good to go!\n. Thank You! :bow: \n. @leemunroe - Took your suggestion and updated all refs to `./src/`\n\n**Related, but not part of this PR:**\n- `s3` still needs to be removed ala #27\n- Cloudfiles task should get a separate PR and testing to change `dest: '/'` to `dest: <%= paths.dist_img %>` (#26)\n. @leemunroe - Love it. I was doing that on a couple projects with the following components:\n- Buttons\n- Horizontal\n- Signatures\n- Social Badges\n. @xavierartot - Checkout #33 and let us know if that's a preferable alternative to browsersync. It supports watch, live reload, browser preview(s) and quick nav to jump between compiled templates.\n\nIf you aren't feeling it, I can provide some sample code for BrowserSync to work with this project.\n. More directly, I'd consider adding a task. What's important is that `watch` is called after `browserSync`.\n`grunt.registerTask('giddyup', ['default','browserSync', 'watch']);`\n. @toby1kenobi - It's not you. The cloudfiles task was never updated properly when imagemin was implemented. We'll get a fix / PR for this.\n\n[Line 173 of Gruntfile.js](https://github.com/leemunroe/grunt-email-workflow/blob/master/Gruntfile.js#L173) should be `'src': '<%= paths.dist_img %>/*',` NOT `'src': '<%= paths.src_img %>/*',`\n.

Hit me back with any feedback / questions once you've had time to review.\n. @leemunroe - Thanks for feedback / suggestions.\nThe first issue was word-break related with the long path in the `code` tag.\n\nThese latest updates should cover all your points. :beers: \n. :+1:\n. This is definitely a complicated. I think there's some refactoring/options to watch that can make this better and faster.\r\n\r\n* `scss` changes should trigger scss, assemble, juice, and replace tasks for **all** templates.\r\n* `layouts`, `partials`, and `data` changes should trigger assemble, juice, and replace tasks for **all** templates.\r\n* `img` changes should trigger only imagemin task\r\n\r\nTaking it a step further, it's possible to incorporate something like the following that would process only a subset of `src/emails/` templates.\r\n```\r\ngrunt watch:specific --files=\"filename_or_pattern\"\r\n\r\ngrunt build:specific --files=\"filename_or_pattern\"\r\n``` \r\n\r\n. No worries. I'll give this a spin when I have a second. I'm currently trying to wrap up #87 if you have any opinions or desire to help test that out.. Hey @macbookandrew \r\n\r\nI just pushed up a fork on my branch for [build times and options](https://github.com/taeo/grunt-email-design/tree/feature/build-time-and-options). It addresses build times as well as watch related options.\r\n\r\nIt's not \"automagic\" unfortunately, but here's a use case that would only watch for and process:\r\n* template updates matching the name `*2016-08*`. \r\n* scss updates get compiled, but only applied to the afore mentioned templates\r\n* _(Any layouts, data, or partials trigger a complete rebuild of all templates)_\r\n\r\n```\r\ngrunt preview --template=\"*2016-08*\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Additional grunt option** `--noinline` can be passed if you don't want css styles inlined (will be preserved in `<style>` tag.\r\n```\r\ngrunt preview --template=\"*2016-08*\" --noinline\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet me know if you're willing to give the branch a spin and provide any thoughts, feedback, or questions.. Solid. Thanks for testing!\r\n\r\nThere's a little tidying up and README updates to make. Other than that, should we give it a little time and prompt a few more people to test, or just go PR and done?. @macbookandrew - welcome back! Hope you had a good vacay. No rush here. Would love to have input + further testing to see if it meets your needs and is easy enough to use this way.. You'd have to remove the `flatten: true` option as well from `/grunt/assemble.js`\n\nThe downside(s) to this currently are:\n- The preview UI naively looks for `/dist/*.html` files, so template select will be blank. \n- You get more of the tree than you might want `/dist/src/emails/<templates + subdirs>`\n- css inlining and a number of other tasks don't compensate for depth in `/dist` at the moment\n. I'd stay away from near-duplicate grunt tasks.\n\nIdeal approach for what you're wanting to do would be to go through every grunt task and make sure it supported directory depth + add recursion to the preview app's template finder.\n\nAnother option would be to just prefix all your emails as opposed to having hierarchy. `/emails/back_<template_name>.hbs`\n\nI personally don't foresee the need to support directory structure in `dist`, but maybe that's just me and/or I don't see the full picture.\n\nCheers\n. Nice. Thanks for posting your solution :+1: \n. Not answering your question here, but avoiding ruby dependencies is pry a good move to keep this project more accessible. Roadie is ruby-centric.\n. Don't wrap your php in handlebars notation. PHP tags will be passed through assemble / handlebars unmodified if you write them as normal.\n`{{{ <?= $firstname; ?> }}}` should be simply `<?php echo $firstname; ?>`\n\nNOTE: The previewer will not parse or display your php code and the templates will still have .html extensions. You can go the extra mile to support .php extensions.\n\nin file `grunt/assemble.js` add:\n\n```\noptions:\n    ext: '.php'\n```\n\nThen for preview you'd have to add [express-php](https://www.npmjs.com/package/php-express) via npm and in file `server.js` adapt the view engine from `ejs` to `php`\n. This does solve the issue of the actual replaced path(s). That said here are the related issues it creates that makes it incomplete for the workflow to function.\r\n\r\n1.

Looks like your [PR is still lingering](https://github.com/markhuge/node-mailgun-send/pull/4).\r\n\r\nI was able to send mailgun emails just fine with the `grunt send --template=[THE_TEMPLATE_NAME]` command.\r\n\r\n@rwillwerth - What is your node version? That could be an issue if you're on an older version. I'm on v7.x\r\n`node --version`\r\n. Nothing wrong with that, Mark. Thanks.\r\n\r\nWe can call this closed.. On the grunt -vs- gulp -vs- both scene, I'd recommend **not** trying to support both. Seems like a recipe for headaches and redundant code that needs to be kept in sync and maintained.\r\n\r\nI'd be curious to hear any specifics about why gulp would be *better*, or if just a cooler/newer thing. Installing and running `npm install && run task` is equally simple in both worlds.\r\n\r\nIf there's a huge cry for gulp over grunt, we could just port everything. . @ericdfields - data formats / naming conventions are key for sure. I do like the consideration of not inlining styles, presuming that the final engine will do that.\r\n\r\n@leemunroe - Express Server comes with a number of [template engines](https://github.com/expressjs/express/wiki?_ga=1.23539322.1742926776.1490762831#template-engines) supported out of the box, and many, many others from 3rd parties. I don't see that being too complicated to add supported engines and then conditionally process the preview based on the template extension / engine. Hypothetically of course.\r\n\r\nPushing this to the next level - should we make a bit of a spec, go YOLO style and just start a fork to play with, other?. Some quick research and feasibility tests are looking \ud83d\udc4d.\r\n\r\n- [x] Create templates with any combination of extensions\r\n- [x] Helper to pass mustache syntax through the compiler\r\n- [x] Express preview handling multiple rending engines based on extension\r\n. Hey @ericdfields, @leemunroe and anyone else interested in testing this out.\r\n\r\nI just got a branch pushed up on my fork for [multiple template engines](https://github.com/taeo/grunt-email-design/tree/feature-multiple-template-engines).\r\n\r\nIt supports `.ejs`, `.liquid`, `.hbs` templates using [consolidate](https://github.com/tj/consolidate.js) (room for many more template engines).\r\nThe caveat is you have to name your `src/emails/` as `filename.<desired-extension>.hbs`\r\n\r\nIt adds a raw helper:\r\n```\r\n{{{{raw}}}}\r\n  whatever your heart desires... or non-rendered hbs code\r\n{{{{/raw}}}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSample data can be created in `/preview/data/` either `.json` or `.yml` by simply adding one of those flavors with the base template name > `_sample.html.hbs` would lookup `/preview/data/_sample.json` or `/preview/data/_sample.yaml`\r\n\r\nThere's room for improvement, but it's a fully functional proof of concept! Look forward to your feedback.\r\n\r\n**caveat** php is in there, but it's broken. There's some awkwardness passing variables into the previewer.. Thanks!\r\n\r\nTo your points.\r\n\r\n1. I vote we should fire up the gh wiki on this project to help elaborate on variations and options. That will help keep the README smaller, and we can include code samples as opposed to including them in the core repo.\r\n\r\n2. Maybe I'm not understanding correctly. Are you saying there's no way to send the `dist/_sample.liquid` for example via mailgun or to litmus fully rendered with the sample data? If I'm tracking... you're correct that doesn't work, but it could. `dist/_sample.liquid` is what you'd send off to your 3rd party service, right?\r\n\r\n3. PHP - not sure how to fix that either at the moment, nor do I care to spend more time trying to figure it out. I don't personally use many apps, or know of any ESP's that are php-driven. Someone else in the community with a hankering for that could patch and PR.... Chris, @romanlelek is mostly correct. \r\n\r\nYou would have to edit `/grunt/aliases.yml` to add a custom series of tasks. You would also need to modify or copy/rename some of the `/grunt/*js` tasks to suit your needs.\r\n\r\nIssue #57 is along these lines as a feature request.. Historical reference - This did not fix the issue #77 (authors words). Hey @jzantua - Can you post a sample of the configuration you're using and confirm it you are using this package (https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-ftp) or something else?. @jzantua - Yep, authentication is definitely required and unsupported. At the very top of the readme for the [ftp-deploy](https://github.com/simonh1000/ftp-deploy) package it says \"(Need sftp? Check out [sftp-upload](https://github.com/pirumpi/sftp-upload))\". . ",

Right here:\n\n```\n  // Assembles your email content with HTML layout\n  assemble: {\n    options: {\n      layoutdir: 'src/layouts',\n      partials: ['src/partials/**/*.hbs'],\n      flatten: true\n    },\n    pages: {\n      src: ['src/emails/*.hbs'],\n      dest: 'dist/'\n    }\n  },\n```\n\nSo basically I have had to change these to just src instead of the <% %> method.\n.

I've followed changes:\r\n\r\nAdded to grunt/mailgun.js\r\n`domain: '<%= secrets.mailgun.domain %>', // See README for secrets.json or replace this with your own email domain`\r\n\r\nAdded to secrets.json\r\n`\"domain\": \"mail.my-domain-name.com\",` NB - tried naked domain, and also with http:// unsuccessfully\r\n\r\nAdded to package.json\r\n`\"grunt-mailgun\": \"^2.0.1\",` NB removed 1.0.1 and then 2.0.0\r\n\r\nAs i say, still not working for me.. Sounds good. It's always good to have options/redundancies. \r\n\r\nTo that end, I have been meaning to ask if you had appetite to add options for other transactional mail vendors. I'm specifically looking at AWS SES. I'm looking to try and replicate your grunt (and/or gulp process once developed) for SES. Thus allowing another option and having a redundancy in place should things go a bit 'Pete Tong'.\r\n\r\nThoughts?. I can confirm same issue as @williamdavies90 - I ran a test run about half an hour ago and it's not appearing in the Mailgun logs. Last run i sent successfully, was on 22 Feb 2017. So it appears something has changed between then and now.\r\n\r\n@leemunroe anything in the source below that you think may be responsible?\r\n\r\nhttps://www.hitchhq.com/mailgun/activities?utm_source=mailgun&utm_medium=widget&utm_campaign=click_widget. So I've also tried applying the changes in the PR:\r\n\r\n- grunt/mailgun.js\r\n- package.json\r\n- Also added the corresponding \"domain\" entry to the secrets.json file\r\n- Didn't update the readme.md as didn't seem necessary at this point for my test.\r\n\r\nThe test send appears to go through fine in terminal. However, still no dice in the logs.\r\n\r\nHere's my console output:\r\n\r\n`Craigs-MacBook-Pro:mailgun-workflow craig$ grunt mailgun -v\r\nInitializing\r\nCommand-line options:
