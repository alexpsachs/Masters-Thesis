It is 7.\n\nI think I'm going to hold off on this, mostly because I don't really _want_ it to be estimated in that way.

Do you know of a decent way to check for that (and then just show `help()` in this case)?\n\nThanks again for your help!\n. Love it.\n. Awesome. Thanks for your help.\n. That's cool, but I think I want to keep things simple for the main spark script. By all means, keep it in your own script, though. :)\n. Pretty rad.

Not a huge fan of using environment variables here (probably), but I think given how we call `spark` this is a pretty non-invasive way of doing things.\n.

Pretty cool usage of it. I haven't really mucked with something like this before, though, so I don't know what the problem might be.\n.

It's a strange feature, to be sure, but I'm going to stick with it for now.\n. I'm not interested in porting it to Python, but thanks- looks cool!\n. Yeah; I'm not interested in adding more dependencies.\n. It's a bug that we should probably fix, sure. To be honest, though, if you're looking for a very accurate graphs you should probably be running far away from sparklines in the first place.\n. Pulls (in bash) requested. :)\n. Who knows; mostly it's more fun to write it in bash.\n. Nice!\n\nThanks for this. :heart:\n. I like the idea, but I'm not a huge fan of the implementation. The colors don't really have any meaning. If it were all shades from cool to warm, that might make sense (although we're limited by typical shell color palettes), but I don't think there's a lot of definition to be had here regardless. It's mostly just color for color's sake.\n\nGoing to close this for now, but we can always revisit it in the future!\n. best-spark-ever\n. :) I think if there's a conflict I'd go with `spark-shell`.\n. I think I'm cool with that. Or maybe spark.sh. I'm at dinner and I've had a lot of wine so I reserve judgement on this a bit.\n. :)\n\nGoing to close this out, since there's nothing to do on spark's end now.\n. `$b` is really non-descriptive. Can you change it to `$spark`?\n. Thanks!\n. Going to go with #54 instead here.\n. I'm mostly just not into the additional code that comes with it.\n. I think I'm good with spark being a single-line thing, but thanks for the pull! Cool idea.\n. :+1:\n. There's a bit more than detailed in the pull's description here; if you want to send separate pulls for the printf or the basename call (or pull out the min/max commit) I can merge it in.\n. I think this was a temporary issue; give it another show and it should work for ya.\n. Work's been done in this in #54 and #70; haven't really sat down and looked at what makes sense to pull in yet.\n. #54.\n. 22439644fb39de086482d71d36a9251966affc67\n. Hm. Interesting thought, and it appeals to my everything-in-their-place part of my brain.\n\nI'm kind of on the fence; part of what I like about spark is that it's pretty accessible, particularly for people who might be new to shell scripts (or even programming at all!). It's a little thing, but tucking it away in `bin/` might make it a bit more opaque, or otherwise give the impression that what's going on in here is more complicated than it is.\n\nMight be overthinking it, though. Would be curious on what other people think make the most sense here. (And if we move to `bin/`, we'll also need to update the README link and then probably add a `test/` for the test files, too.)\n. I think I'm going to :-1: this; I like the discoverability of it right in the directory. Thanks for the idea, though!\n. #54 should fix this one up.\n. I think this came up awhile back as an aside in another pull request. It's too bad there's formatting differences for this, because Kate's screenshot looks prettttttty. I agree that it's likely best to hold off on this so we can keep a bit of consistency across environments, though.\n. I think spark's pretty simple enough to just plug in additional characters in the local copy of it rather than supporting a flag in the repo; don't think it's necessary to add more options.\n. Thanks for creating and linking the issue, @rogeruiz! I'm going to tentatively close this issue out. I'm subscribed on that thread, and if it ends up being a problem with Spark itself we can reopen and make some fixes.\n. Dig it! Thanks!\n. What's the current look of it in tmux?\n. Do you mind dropping in a quick screenshot here?\n\nI'm a little concerned about bloating things a little bit much (I don't think we'd need multiple color schemes, for example... maybe just a `-c` option), but I'm not totally :-1: on this yet either. Would be interested to hear what others think on this.\n. Ha, good catch. :)\n. Nice approach to it \u2014 I dig it. Thanks! :+1:\n. Huh- maybe it was just a temporary thing?

The maximum input should be set the the 7th element and the minimum input should be set to the 0th element and everything graphed in between - we should be showing as much variation as exists, not whatever the current thing is.

I dunno. Tough problem; when you call `cat`, it takes over control. And you can't simply check `$#` because then you break piping in, when there are no arguments.

Because spark has a resolution of 8.

The fractional part is just scaled away.\n\nSo using very big numbers together with very small numbers doesn't make sense.\n\nThe purpose of spark is to show relative differences on a scale of 8 and it does that well. There's no need to pull in python (or any other dependency) to do this. It can all be done with bash only and that's all it should need.\n\nIt's very easy to scale your input values (whatever they may be) to get into a meaningful range. That conversion should not be part of spark because converting data is another matter (and probably part of a specific domain).\n\nYou might have heard of the [Unix philosophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy): Write programs that do one thing and do it well.

Please, do always question them and don't just pull them in blindly. You suspect there's virtually no situation where there is bash but no python.
