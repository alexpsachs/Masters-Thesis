Great idea. I'll get on that this week.\n. .woff files have been added to the latest commit. Thanks for the suggestion!\n. Thanks Lucas, I'm fixing this right now.\n. Ah, I see - so a separate font face that merges all of the icons into one font. I'm still conflicted on the mapping structure for duplicate icons (with different styles). I wrote about the subject here: http://somerandomdude.com/2012/01/31/font-embedding-icons-the-right-way/. Having one document icon map to the Unicode document glyph and another map to an unused glyph seems semantically inappropriate.  \n\nI would prefer to have this unified font exist in a fork. I think a unified font is useful, but I strongly support proper Unicode mapping when possible. To me, this seems akin to putting regular and bold weights of the letter 'a' in one font where the regular weight was mapped to 'a' and the other was mapped to a character in the private range. \n. OK, let's give this a shot and see what people think. Thanks again for all the help.\n. Right now, it's manual. I can't think of any _good_ way to automate the process. I was considering using the JSX files which generate PNGs and SVGs from the source Illustrator file to write the JSON files, but there still needs to be a Unicode mapping to each icon at some point in the process - and that can never be automated. If you have any thoughts on the process, I would love to hear them.\n. Thank you sir! Would you mind if I added this to the wiki?\n. This is good to hear. For some reason, it didn't work for me, I need to do a little more research as to why that was the case.\n. Hey guys, I just wanted to thank you for all the effort you're putting into this and let you know how much I appreciate it. I'm having one hell of a time wrangling FontForge to get it what I need to do, so any help in that area would be great. \n\nI am more than happy to contribute however I can. This is exactly what I was hoping to see by open-sourcing Iconic, so I'm pretty stoked about this. Thanks!\n. Made a significant push on the font sizes which should alleviate this issue.\n. Given the style guide of Iconic, a stroked star is literally impossible. I would need to change the weight of the stroke for that one icon and I think that would cause more problems than it would solve. I don't think there will be a stroked star in Iconic, but it will definitely show up in any new icon set I design.\n. Hey man, your work looks great!\n\nFontAwesome is a great icon set and probably a better fit for Bootstrap. Iconic was designed for some very specific purposes (a large range of legibility, usually down to 8 pixels) and a \u00fcber minimal style (often too minimal) based on an 8x8 grid system. This limits what icons I can make and how I can make them.\n\nThat said, I am _highly_ considering making a new icon set without those tight restrictions and just go for aesthetics. I feel very confident that I could provide a top-tier icon set that would be a good fit for something like Bootstrap. I am seriously mulling it, I just need the time and resources to make it happen. \n. I honestly thought it would be impossible, but I was able to design a decent-looking paperclip icon in the 8x8 grid. It will be in the next release.\n. I will be working on this soon. Apologies for the radio silence.\n. Great call on this guys. The latest commit addresses this issue.\n. Yeah, that makes good sense. I'll see if I can fix that in the coming days.\n\nOn Oct 11, 2012, at 12:18 AM, Bryce Adams notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Didn't want to open a new issue for this but I was thinking why not just change it so instead of:\n> .book_alt2:before {content:'\\e049';} or .iconic-book_alt2:before {content:'\\e049';}\n> it be made:\n> .iconic.book_alt2:before {content:'\\e049';}\n> as the .iconic class is required regardless.\n> \n> Any thoughts on this?

Thank you so much for your contribution and my apologies for the late response to this!\n. Hey guys, apologies for the delay in responding. I've intentionally left logos out of Iconic because I never felt they belonged in the icon set. I think providing vector logos for influential online properties is useful, but it flirts with intellectual property and I'd like to avoid it. Especially as an open source project, making vector versions of logos \"open\" seems strange. \n\nOn the general subject of Iconic, there's a lot happening behind the scenes. I can't wait to share some pretty big news.\n. Agreed\nP.J.\n\nOn Fri, May 17, 2013 at 5:56 AM, Bengt L\u00fcers notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> Social and other company icons are subject of other icon sets, already.

Great idea. I'll get on that this week.\n. .woff files have been added to the latest commit. Thanks for the suggestion!\n. Thanks Lucas, I'm fixing this right now.\n. Ah, I see - so a separate font face that merges all of the icons into one font. I'm still conflicted on the mapping structure for duplicate icons (with different styles). I wrote about the subject here: http://somerandomdude.com/2012/01/31/font-embedding-icons-the-right-way/. Having one document icon map to the Unicode document glyph and another map to an unused glyph seems semantically inappropriate.  \n\nI would prefer to have this unified font exist in a fork. I think a unified font is useful, but I strongly support proper Unicode mapping when possible. To me, this seems akin to putting regular and bold weights of the letter 'a' in one font where the regular weight was mapped to 'a' and the other was mapped to a character in the private range. \n. OK, let's give this a shot and see what people think. Thanks again for all the help.\n. Right now, it's manual. I can't think of any _good_ way to automate the process. I was considering using the JSX files which generate PNGs and SVGs from the source Illustrator file to write the JSON files, but there still needs to be a Unicode mapping to each icon at some point in the process - and that can never be automated. If you have any thoughts on the process, I would love to hear them.\n. Thank you sir! Would you mind if I added this to the wiki?\n. This is good to hear. For some reason, it didn't work for me, I need to do a little more research as to why that was the case.\n. Hey guys, I just wanted to thank you for all the effort you're putting into this and let you know how much I appreciate it. I'm having one hell of a time wrangling FontForge to get it what I need to do, so any help in that area would be great. \n\nI am more than happy to contribute however I can. This is exactly what I was hoping to see by open-sourcing Iconic, so I'm pretty stoked about this. Thanks!\n. Made a significant push on the font sizes which should alleviate this issue.\n. Given the style guide of Iconic, a stroked star is literally impossible. I would need to change the weight of the stroke for that one icon and I think that would cause more problems than it would solve. I don't think there will be a stroked star in Iconic, but it will definitely show up in any new icon set I design.\n. Hey man, your work looks great!\n\nFontAwesome is a great icon set and probably a better fit for Bootstrap. Iconic was designed for some very specific purposes (a large range of legibility, usually down to 8 pixels) and a \u00fcber minimal style (often too minimal) based on an 8x8 grid system. This limits what icons I can make and how I can make them.\n\nThat said, I am _highly_ considering making a new icon set without those tight restrictions and just go for aesthetics. I feel very confident that I could provide a top-tier icon set that would be a good fit for something like Bootstrap. I am seriously mulling it, I just need the time and resources to make it happen. \n. I honestly thought it would be impossible, but I was able to design a decent-looking paperclip icon in the 8x8 grid. It will be in the next release.\n. I will be working on this soon. Apologies for the radio silence.\n. Great call on this guys. The latest commit addresses this issue.\n. Yeah, that makes good sense. I'll see if I can fix that in the coming days.\n\nOn Oct 11, 2012, at 12:18 AM, Bryce Adams notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Didn't want to open a new issue for this but I was thinking why not just change it so instead of:\n> .book_alt2:before {content:'\\e049';} or .iconic-book_alt2:before {content:'\\e049';}\n> it be made:\n> .iconic.book_alt2:before {content:'\\e049';}\n> as the .iconic class is required regardless.\n> \n> Any thoughts on this?

I've intentionally left logos out of Iconic because I never felt they belonged in the icon set. I think providing vector logos for influential online properties is useful, but it flirts with intellectual property and I'd like to avoid it. Especially as an open source project, making vector versions of logos \"open\" seems strange. \n\nOn the general subject of Iconic, there's a lot happening behind the scenes.

As a graphic designer i felt that 16 px is to small and 32 px to big and by making them 20x20 they would also render well at 15x15. So it is at that size as the pictograms should look as sharp as possible.\n\nAt a size of 20x20 all pictograms are also designed to have a even hight and width so they always align nicely in the middle of\u2014let's say\u2014a square 30x30 px button.\n\nThe aesthetics of the pictograms has also been high importance to me apart from the obvious of them being functional. So my approach has\u2014in many cases\u2014been more optical than mechanical in getting the perfect result. \n\nThe font's UPM size is 1000\u2014as it should be for an OpenType font. So to achieve the same result when using Entypo as a font as you get when using vectors\u2014or a result as close as possible\u2014I had the option of making the glyphs either 1000 or 500 high and so they should render perfect at 20pt or 40pt. I went for the second option. None of the options would render the glyphs at a perfect size next to a text in the same size.\n\nThe pictograms are also design to vertically alight to middle in relation to each other. \n\nI'll see what changes I will make to the font in the next release. Better hinting and 20-30 new glyphs will be a part of it for sure.\n\nMaybe I can send you some stripped down versions playing with the dimensions for you to try out.
