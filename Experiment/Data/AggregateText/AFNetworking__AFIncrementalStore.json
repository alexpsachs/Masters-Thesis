    "mattt": "Great. Thanks!\n. Just ran into the same problem myself.\n\nApparently you need to specify the iOS version in the `platform` declaration:\n\n``` ruby\nplatform :ios, '5.0'\n```\n\nThat does the trick.\n. Ah, the 'old copy-paste error. How embarrassing for me! Thanks for the patch!\n. Excellent work. This goes to show the importance of developing against non-trivial examples (something which I've been admittedly slow in doing this time, so I appreciate your working through this). Thanks so much for the patch\u2014this has all been merged into master as of 788c5e5c256ee0a6522915f25e29717f63349d5b.\n. Heh, sure enough... Thanks for the patch, @dismory.\n. Ah, right you are. Thanks for the patch, @bjtitus!\n. Ah, good call. I've added this in acccc43. Thanks!\n. Hmm... I'm not particularly keen on adding things to `.gitignore` that should be in a global `.gitignore` in the first place. I've been holding out on AFNetworking for a year and a half now, so if nothing else, I'm stubborn about it, too.\n. Hey, thanks so much for submitting your documentation\u2014I really appreciate it. I took that as a long-needed kick-in-the-ass to give it some proper documentation, which is now in there as of 1171474a48f3e61afcf16d47295487939750ca78.\n\nTake a look at the way everything is formatted in my patch; you may want to use that as a starting point for any more docs you write. I'm following Apple's conventions for style, content, and formatting, which seems to be pretty comprehensive for how exhausting it is to write in the first place. Either way, documentation generally goes in the interface (.h), rather than in the implementation, which may contain some inline comments to clarify complicated codes.\n\nThanks again!\n. Ah, this is correct. I think I only re-realized the distinction between properties and attributes halfway through my original implementation, so there are a few lingering references to properties where I really mean attributes. Anyway, thanks.\n. Wait, no, this is incorrect. These properties are then used in `representationsForRelationshipsFromRepresentation:ofEntity:fromResponse:`. We need those in there. Reverting.\n. Apologies for taking so long to respond to your pull request.\n\nI just merged 96101a6 into master. See Issue #46 for the full discussion, but my approach was to use notifications to communicate all of the context necessary to do things like update activity indicators, or alert users about errors.\n\nA `AFIncrementalStoreContextDidFetchRemoteValues` notification will contain the associated HTTP request operation at `AFIncrementalStoreRequestOperationKey`. If it failed for some reason, its `error` field will be non-`nil`.\n\nI hope this approach works alright for you. Thanks again for your patch.\n. I'm embarrassed to admit that I only recently realized that `UIWindow rootViewController` was a thing. Goes to show how long I've been out of the iOS development loop.\n\nI cherry-picked all but the `.gitignore` commit. Thanks!\n. Core Data _should_ do that automatically, but it didn't without doing this manually. Unless I'm mistaken. Can you check your change against the example projects to see if everything functions as expected?\n. Cool cool. Thanks again for that. This is all starting to come together, I think.\n\nI think I've reached a breakthrough as far as write operations, so I hope to push something for that in the next day or two.\n. I'm certain that discovering things that work for entirely the wrong reason doesn't exactly inspire confidence, but thanks all the same for the patch, Ben. I've merged it in 05f4f2a.\n. Thank you for this. I really appreciate it!\n. I dig it. Thanks so much for following up on that\u2014I really appreciate it.\n. Thanks for the pull request. I merged in all but the `.gitignore`, for reasons explained in Issues #30 and #23. Cheers!\n. That's a great idea. Thanks for the patch, Kevin! \n. I thought I'd made that change myself in an earlier commit, but it seems that it didn't go through. Thanks all the same, @lottadot\u2014I appreciate it.\n. Thanks for the pull request, @pitiphong-p. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems that this approach would only support 2 levels deep, no? \n\nA recursive solution would support any arbitrary depth, and even help to break up the wall of code in that method now. I've implemented that in 8743ea97c2599ee7edb1c2e1023218cf2583dcda ... e487c6a.\n\nLet me know how that works for you. Cheers!\n. Heh, almost forgot that one. Added in 34815bb.\n\n> 1 files changed, 5 insertions(+), 39 deletions(-)\n\n:+1:\n. Whoops, sorry about that. Fixed in 54f04e0.\n. @pitiphong-p Works for me :)\n\nJust merged in your code in d7c7209. I committed it with you as the author, if that's alright with you. Thanks so much for your help on all of this! Sorry I wasn't hitting the same problems myself while debugging\u2014I really need to come up with a more complex example to test against.\n. Thanks for your pull request, @xslim. There's a lot in here other than the foreign ID stuff, so it's going to take some time for me to determine what I should take from this. Bear with me for a moment.\n. No worries at all\u2014thanks for your contributions.\n\nAs it were, I _just_ added `Last-Modified` support myself, with 40bee2dfe9324210ed42c89d96095c27097284a3. It takes a different approach from yours by managing `Last-Modified` in the same way as resource identifiers. Interested to hear any thoughts you have.\n. As of e8c6472bf42f763d77e5c5ca584099abd555f906, AFIncrementalStore is no longer being actively maintained. Thank you for your contributions; my sincere apologies for any inconvenience this may have caused.\n. Finally getting around to merging all of this. Thought this is a bit late, some notes about coding conventions:\n- For now, I'm trying to avoid usage of object literals in AFIncrementalStore itself, to maximize compatibility in the short term (a few people complained about it before).\n- There shouldn't be any whitespace padding inside curly brace code blocks.\n- `NSCParameterAssert` is specifically for C functions, `NSParameterAssert` is for methods.\n\nThanks again for your hard work. I'll be making my attempt to pull in as much as I can from your develop branch today and tomorrow.\n. Going commit-by-commit, I was able to cherry pick a majority of these changes. There were some things that I've held off on, like adding a dependency on RASchedulingKit, and externalizing private categories, but I think for the most part, I was able to pull in a lot of the nice improvements you made with respect to concurrency and robustness.\n\nThanks again!\n. @pitiphong-p I've read the release notes extensively and watched the WWDC sessions many times, but in my experience from developing this originally, I found that the child context was, in fact, not actually notifying its parent context of its saves. Now, this could have been caused by an entirely orthogonal mistake on my part, that has since been made moot. Either way, I'll have to test that everything is, in fact, working as advertised. I'd love nothing more than to be able to remove those notifications.\n. I not entirely sure about what's going on, but things don't work quite right without the notification stuff. Right now, the pattern looks like this:\n\n``` objective-c\nid observer = [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserverForName:NSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotification object:childContext queue:[NSOperationQueue mainQueue] usingBlock:^(NSNotification *note) {\n    [context mergeChangesFromContextDidSaveNotification:note];\n}];\n//...\n[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] removeObserver:observer];\n```\n\nIf I ever do figure out what's up, and it is indeed unnecessary, I'll gladly remove this.\n. Awesome\u2014I forgot about optional relationships. This has been merged in (with attribution) in 579ebb2. Thanks!\n. Thanks. I'm looking to remove that dependency soon, but in the meantime, it might as well be correct, right? :)\n. Interesting example\u2014thanks for sharing it.\n\nSo for APIs that have inconsistent formats, this method needs a way to determine what the \"meat\" of the response body is.\n\nWhen I designed this all, my thought was that you could determine this just from the response body itself. In this case, that would look like:\n\n``` objective-c\nif ([responseBody valueForKey:@\"matches\"]) {\n  return [responseBody valueForKey:@\"matches\"];\n} else {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nUsing the added operation would turn this into something like:\n\n``` objective-c\nif ([[operation.request.URL lastPathComponent] isEqualToString:@\"search\"]) {\n  return [responseBody valueForKey:@\"matches\"];\n} else {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nThat second example is inherently going to be more brittle, because now it's baking in an assumption of how the API is going to serve something. Not only that, it seems like it's generally more difficult to match the request rather than some element of the response.\n\nIt's hard to imagine too many cases where it would be nontrivial or impossible to determine what part(s) of a response object (is/are) the representation(s). \n\n> FWIW, if it were somehow impossible (e.g. unpredictable keys), there would be the potential out of overriding the response object returned in the success block on a per-request basis in the HTTP client to turn the response object into something more reasonable.\n\nIf I were to add that field, I'm worried that it would just end up being more confusing than useful. Let me know how my suggested approach works for you; I can revisit this if it's found to be overly cumbersome.\n\nThanks, @lordkev\n. Thanks for your fix to Issue #76. I cherry-picked just those lines with attribution in 18805daac907ac498c6a23c1f25d3922623bca35.\n\nAs for the rest of the changes, I'm not the biggest fan of that approach. Necessary categories on Core Data classes goes down the path of API bloat and dependencies that plagues Core Data meta-frameworks. Communicating vital state through `userInfo` like this also feels somewhat fragile.\n\nAs far as conditionally triggering network requests for inserts / updates / deletes, I think the terms of that could just be determined based on whether the client implements the optional protocol methods (or returns non-nil request, even).\n\nBlock methods for context saving would be better than the current use of notifications. Someone recently suggested that I could accomplish this with a manager object that saves the context and listens for the relevant notifications, triggering the specified blocks when appropriate. Manager as an interface to blocks from notifications seems like the best pattern in this case.\n\nAnyway, thanks again for that one fix. I'll those aforementioned changes in soon.\n. Ah, yep. That's some unused code leftover from that refactoring. Thanks for sending that over.\n. As of 836875d717cc54f09155b9d92b4051d373d3c998, all of the child contexts are using private concurrency types. Thanks to @evadne for doing a lot of the legwork around that.\n. Yeah, I've been punting on the inflection stuff as I figure out the best way to go about that. My current plan is to create a new dependency to handle all of the inflection logic, which could then be used in other projects.\n\nThe intention was to cover a good portion of the cases with a simple algorithm, and have the option to override as necessary. If you don't mind waiting a day or two, I'll replace that with a more robust solution rather than patching the partial solution. Thanks!\n. I just pushed a commit (c8e10e5) that persists inserts / updates / deletes to the backing store if the corresponding request from the REST client is `nil`. In the case of inserted objects, the resource identifier is generated from a UUID. The next steps are to refactor this to remove the code duplication between the conditional and the block, and to make this work when the client simply does not respond to the method as well.\n. I like this a lot. Everything's merged in and looking great. Thanks!\n. Thanks for your pull request, @wtmoose. In the process of merging a batch of commits from an earlier patch, it seems like these issues have been addressed. Specifically, d497e3286ab6649fd6b90ba5418e31b6f8954acb fixes the backing object ID in the update / delete callback, cc6fc7eb76e07dc048cb86b849cf2eadefb51e04 fixes the typo with managed / backing objects, and 830def614c9823fadda99d7a2c6305897a95b1ce fixes the notification infinite loop.\n\nLet me know if there's anything missing from all of that.\n. I just merged in 3b8443fce24dc551d55f2513ed26c19fde99e9de and b421dd6660f590f8efabc3c51ed531e5234f371d, which pull in the changes from this pull request, adjusted to the changes I'd already made that prevented a direct merge.\n\nActually, having just revisited it, I'm coming around to the idea that the Last-Modified header may be better off going in directly, unparsed, into the backing store, rather than going through the hassle of converting back and forth (especially since all that's being done is adding it to the request header if present. Thoughts?\n. RFC conversion removed in 516617790223e946732e465a85b65a4babbe083c, which has the unfortunate side effect of causing incompatibility in model, as attribute type changed from date to string.\n. As of e8c6472bf42f763d77e5c5ca584099abd555f906, AFIncrementalStore is no longer being actively maintained. Thank you for your contributions; my sincere apologies for any inconvenience this may have caused.\n. It appears that almost the exact same thing has been merged in from Pull Request #87. From all I can tell about that implementation, only root objects are exposed in the fetched objects array--any relationships are keyed as properties. Cheers!\n. This has quite a few other changes in it, aside from not dispatching to main to deliver the notification. Can you explain those changes?\n. Thanks for the patch, @pitiphong-p. Unfortunately, since I took so long to get around to this one, this can't be merged cleanly. On the plus side, I think everything in here was added in some place or another. The latest version of AFIncrementalStore is _significantly_ more stable that it was before. I'm excited to push out a new release soon.\n. Thanks @pitiphong-p  and @adamhowardprice  for your fixes on this patch. I merged this in with 10bb56948ea203f5a6882d75643ec57c4a800c20, which did a bit of refactoring & cleanup, ultimately renaming the method to `-updateBackingObject:withAttributeAndRelationshipValuesFromManagedObject:`.\n. I cherry-picked just the part about using the private queue concurrency type in 50edfc5. Thanks again for that.\n. Indeed, this was a typo from a merge I did on this (though I forget the exact one). Thanks for the patch, Cory.\n. Hi, @tsakoyan. Thanks for your pull request\u2014my apologies for taking so long to review it.\n\nI was hoping you could help clarify what this code fixes, and tell me a little more about what's going on in the code. There seems to be a lot of similar-looking code in `-insertOrUpdateObjectsFromRepresentations:ofEntity:fromResponse:withContext:error:completionBlock:`; is there any way that your patch could be refactored to use this function? Likewise with `-updateBackingObject:withAttributeAndRelationshipValuesFromManagedObject:`; is there any overlap there?\n. As of e8c6472bf42f763d77e5c5ca584099abd555f906, AFIncrementalStore is no longer being actively maintained. Thank you for your contributions; my sincere apologies for any inconvenience this may have caused.\n. Thank you so much for the thoughtful pull request, @julienfantin. I hadn't realized that a `NSSaveChangesRequest` would have its object references removed as each one saves, although I guess that's actually a reasonably side-effect.\n\nI've merged this in with some an inline comment explaining what's going on.\n\nThere are a few things I'm worried about, but can respond to as they prove themselves out:\n- The cost of copying all of the objects. Could this ever become unreasonable to the point of affecting performance?\n- Whether there's any use in getting the resulting `NSSaveChangesRequest`, with all of the saved objects removed. If there are objects that _aren't_ saved, do they stick around in the request?\n\nThose will be something to watch out for going forward, but for now, this seems like a reasonable and useful patch. Thanks again!\n. > When it's different it's different in a consistent way... the fetchLimit is fetchLimit+1.\n\nWell, you know what they say, there are two problems in programming: naming things, threading, and off-by-one errors.\n\nTotally bizarre, that.\n\nBut you're spot-on as far as the fetch request goes\u2014I totally missed that this was being passed further down the line. I'll merge that in now.\n. Thanks again for the patch!\n\nLet me know if you have any more leads on the bizarre off-by-one error. Just Core Data being cheeky, maybe?\n. Yep, a vestige of when it used SQLite. Thanks for the patch.\n. Indeed it is. I'll package all of the latest commits into a new tiny release now.\n. Dang, that typo again? I swear, I've probably gotten that wrong more than I got it right. Thanks for the pull request.\n. Looks good. Always glad to merge in documentation. Thanks, dude!\n. Glad to see that the solution was so straightforward. Thanks for sending this patch.\n. I'm a bit squeamish about automatically translating arbitrary integers to dates. If the server sent a number when a date was expected, there's almost certainly a problem somewhere along the line. It's not hard to imagine this leading to a weird class of error where dates from the server are inexplicably Jan 1, 1970, because it sent back a `0`.\n\nAny update on the sub-entity patch?\n. Good call. Thanks so much for the patch, @zulfishah. Sorry it took so long to merge this in.\n. Great! I've seen other data providers adopt this convention, which makes this all-the-more applicable.\n.

Thank you for your contributions; my sincere apologies for any inconvenience this may have caused.\n. Sorry for the delay. Thanks for sending the patch, @f1fe.\n. Cherry-picked lines to commit in 39e407a. Thanks for the patch!\n. Good call. Merged in 7b8c4de. Thanks!\n. This looks like a great patch, @alvinhu. Thanks so much, and apologies for taking so long to get around to taking a look at it.\n\nIf I'm not mistaken, wouldn't this logic be useful for the other fetch request result types as well? Would it make sense to put this outside the `switch` statement, and have all of that translated into the backing context?\n.

Thank you for your contributions; my sincere apologies for any inconvenience this may have caused.\n. Indeed, this is correct. Although unlikely, I added a check for `representationOrArrayOfRepresentationsOfEntity` to be an `NSDictionary` with 75923beb576d92055428aa4c30a851c5d0a3bebe. Cheers!\n. Merged! Tagging 0.4.1 with this now. Thanks, @jerryhjones!\n. Again, a flurry of recent changes made it impossible to merge directly, but 03fc331 is credited to you, and should make the same change. Thanks, @Metamogul!\n. Thanks for the patch, @marthinfreij. With all of the changes I've made recently, I wasn't able to merge this cleanly, but b6582bc is credited to you, and (should) have the equivalent diff. Cheers!\n. Sorry for taking so long to get around to this.\n\nHow do your changes to the `__strong` / `__weak` references relate to the changes made in #193? Is this ready to go, or did #193 address this?\n. Thanks, @jerryhjones.\n. Thanks for the fixes, @Metamogul. I've been working hard on AFIncrementalStore over the last couple of days, so I was only able to merge e9cbf6a, which I cherry-picked as a1bcc2ffa282d07b27393ec65df42b997e4fa1ed. Cheers!\n. Much obliged. Cheers, @dulaccc!\n. Thanks, @agassiyzh :+1: \n. Yikes. That's embarrassing. I'm definitely not the first, nor the last person to flip-flop an `NSValueTransformer`, but still... \n\nAnyway, thanks for the patch, @t089.\n. Thanks for the patch, @ric2z. FWIW, the version there is unnecessary (especially with the library not yet at 1.0), so I removed it outright with e7b6b05d239665b6b295c377bb5c496a5be64356.\n. Thanks for your patch, @MattNewberry. This is an interesting idea, but the implementation is rather brittle, since it relies on a specific predicate format pattern. My intention with the original design was for the user to implement this logic in the `-requestForFetchRequest:withContext:` method, using `NSExpression` to extract the necessary components and handle routing according the specific needs of the application.\n\nYours is a great example of how one might implement that, but it's a little too specific to be incorporated as a core feature.\n. @davidbitton It's pretty much copy-paste from one method into the other for your particular `AFRESTClient` subclass.\n. Thanks for the patch, @baarde. I'll be pushing a new bugfix release (0.5.1) shortly.\n. Actually, this is by design: an object cannot have a permanent ID until the server returns a resource identifier. I'm not entirely sure what the correct workaround is for webservices that send blank 201 responses, but I don't think this is it, unfortunately...\n. D'oh. :sweat:\n\nThanks, @jerryhjones.\n. This is great, @jerryhjones. It looks like I'll have to add logic for resetting ordered relations, but other than that, this is really helpful. Thanks!\n. Actually, scratch that\u2014I misunderstood the purpose of the `isToMany` check. Looks good!\n. Nice. Thanks for the patch, @baarde.\n.

There's a lot in here other than the foreign ID stuff, so it's going to take some time for me to determine what I should take from this. Bear with me for a moment.\n. No worries at all\u2014thanks for your contributions.\n\nAs it were, I _just_ added `Last-Modified` support myself, with 40bee2dfe9324210ed42c89d96095c27097284a3. It takes a different approach from yours by managing `Last-Modified` in the same way as resource identifiers. Interested to hear any thoughts you have.\n. As of e8c6472bf42f763d77e5c5ca584099abd555f906, AFIncrementalStore is no longer being actively maintained. Thank you for your contributions; my sincere apologies for any inconvenience this may have caused.\n. Finally getting around to merging all of this. Thought this is a bit late, some notes about coding conventions:\n- For now, I'm trying to avoid usage of object literals in AFIncrementalStore itself, to maximize compatibility in the short term (a few people complained about it before).\n- There shouldn't be any whitespace padding inside curly brace code blocks.\n- `NSCParameterAssert` is specifically for C functions, `NSParameterAssert` is for methods.\n\nThanks again for your hard work. I'll be making my attempt to pull in as much as I can from your develop branch today and tomorrow.\n. Going commit-by-commit, I was able to cherry pick a majority of these changes. There were some things that I've held off on, like adding a dependency on RASchedulingKit, and externalizing private categories, but I think for the most part, I was able to pull in a lot of the nice improvements you made with respect to concurrency and robustness.\n\nThanks again!\n. @pitiphong-p I've read the release notes extensively and watched the WWDC sessions many times, but in my experience from developing this originally, I found that the child context was, in fact, not actually notifying its parent context of its saves. Now, this could have been caused by an entirely orthogonal mistake on my part, that has since been made moot. Either way, I'll have to test that everything is, in fact, working as advertised. I'd love nothing more than to be able to remove those notifications.\n. I not entirely sure about what's going on, but things don't work quite right without the notification stuff. Right now, the pattern looks like this:\n\n``` objective-c\nid observer = [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserverForName:NSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotification object:childContext queue:[NSOperationQueue mainQueue] usingBlock:^(NSNotification *note) {\n    [context mergeChangesFromContextDidSaveNotification:note];\n}];\n//...\n[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] removeObserver:observer];\n```\n\nIf I ever do figure out what's up, and it is indeed unnecessary, I'll gladly remove this.\n. Awesome\u2014I forgot about optional relationships. This has been merged in (with attribution) in 579ebb2. Thanks!\n. Thanks. I'm looking to remove that dependency soon, but in the meantime, it might as well be correct, right? :)\n. Interesting example\u2014thanks for sharing it.\n\nSo for APIs that have inconsistent formats, this method needs a way to determine what the \"meat\" of the response body is.\n\nWhen I designed this all, my thought was that you could determine this just from the response body itself. In this case, that would look like:\n\n``` objective-c\nif ([responseBody valueForKey:@\"matches\"]) {\n  return [responseBody valueForKey:@\"matches\"];\n} else {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nUsing the added operation would turn this into something like:\n\n``` objective-c\nif ([[operation.request.URL lastPathComponent] isEqualToString:@\"search\"]) {\n  return [responseBody valueForKey:@\"matches\"];\n} else {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nThat second example is inherently going to be more brittle, because now it's baking in an assumption of how the API is going to serve something. Not only that, it seems like it's generally more difficult to match the request rather than some element of the response.\n\nIt's hard to imagine too many cases where it would be nontrivial or impossible to determine what part(s) of a response object (is/are) the representation(s). \n\n> FWIW, if it were somehow impossible (e.g. unpredictable keys), there would be the potential out of overriding the response object returned in the success block on a per-request basis in the HTTP client to turn the response object into something more reasonable.\n\nIf I were to add that field, I'm worried that it would just end up being more confusing than useful. Let me know how my suggested approach works for you; I can revisit this if it's found to be overly cumbersome.\n\nThanks, @lordkev\n. Thanks for your fix to Issue #76. I cherry-picked just those lines with attribution in 18805daac907ac498c6a23c1f25d3922623bca35.\n\nAs for the rest of the changes, I'm not the biggest fan of that approach. Necessary categories on Core Data classes goes down the path of API bloat and dependencies that plagues Core Data meta-frameworks. Communicating vital state through `userInfo` like this also feels somewhat fragile.\n\nAs far as conditionally triggering network requests for inserts / updates / deletes, I think the terms of that could just be determined based on whether the client implements the optional protocol methods (or returns non-nil request, even).\n\nBlock methods for context saving would be better than the current use of notifications. Someone recently suggested that I could accomplish this with a manager object that saves the context and listens for the relevant notifications, triggering the specified blocks when appropriate. Manager as an interface to blocks from notifications seems like the best pattern in this case.\n\nAnyway, thanks again for that one fix. I'll those aforementioned changes in soon.\n. Ah, yep. That's some unused code leftover from that refactoring. Thanks for sending that over.\n. As of 836875d717cc54f09155b9d92b4051d373d3c998, all of the child contexts are using private concurrency types. Thanks to @evadne for doing a lot of the legwork around that.\n. Yeah, I've been punting on the inflection stuff as I figure out the best way to go about that. My current plan is to create a new dependency to handle all of the inflection logic, which could then be used in other projects.\n\nThe intention was to cover a good portion of the cases with a simple algorithm, and have the option to override as necessary. If you don't mind waiting a day or two, I'll replace that with a more robust solution rather than patching the partial solution. Thanks!\n. I just pushed a commit (c8e10e5) that persists inserts / updates / deletes to the backing store if the corresponding request from the REST client is `nil`. In the case of inserted objects, the resource identifier is generated from a UUID. The next steps are to refactor this to remove the code duplication between the conditional and the block, and to make this work when the client simply does not respond to the method as well.\n. I like this a lot. Everything's merged in and looking great. Thanks!\n. Thanks for your pull request, @wtmoose. In the process of merging a batch of commits from an earlier patch, it seems like these issues have been addressed. Specifically, d497e3286ab6649fd6b90ba5418e31b6f8954acb fixes the backing object ID in the update / delete callback, cc6fc7eb76e07dc048cb86b849cf2eadefb51e04 fixes the typo with managed / backing objects, and 830def614c9823fadda99d7a2c6305897a95b1ce fixes the notification infinite loop.\n\nLet me know if there's anything missing from all of that.\n. I just merged in 3b8443fce24dc551d55f2513ed26c19fde99e9de and b421dd6660f590f8efabc3c51ed531e5234f371d, which pull in the changes from this pull request, adjusted to the changes I'd already made that prevented a direct merge.\n\nActually, having just revisited it, I'm coming around to the idea that the Last-Modified header may be better off going in directly, unparsed, into the backing store, rather than going through the hassle of converting back and forth (especially since all that's being done is adding it to the request header if present. Thoughts?\n. RFC conversion removed in 516617790223e946732e465a85b65a4babbe083c, which has the unfortunate side effect of causing incompatibility in model, as attribute type changed from date to string.\n. As of e8c6472bf42f763d77e5c5ca584099abd555f906, AFIncrementalStore is no longer being actively maintained. Thank you for your contributions; my sincere apologies for any inconvenience this may have caused.\n. It appears that almost the exact same thing has been merged in from Pull Request #87. From all I can tell about that implementation, only root objects are exposed in the fetched objects array--any relationships are keyed as properties. Cheers!\n. This has quite a few other changes in it, aside from not dispatching to main to deliver the notification. Can you explain those changes?\n. Thanks for the patch, @pitiphong-p. Unfortunately, since I took so long to get around to this one, this can't be merged cleanly. On the plus side, I think everything in here was added in some place or another. The latest version of AFIncrementalStore is _significantly_ more stable that it was before. I'm excited to push out a new release soon.\n. Thanks @pitiphong-p  and @adamhowardprice  for your fixes on this patch. I merged this in with 10bb56948ea203f5a6882d75643ec57c4a800c20, which did a bit of refactoring & cleanup, ultimately renaming the method to `-updateBackingObject:withAttributeAndRelationshipValuesFromManagedObject:`.\n. I cherry-picked just the part about using the private queue concurrency type in 50edfc5. Thanks again for that.\n. Indeed, this was a typo from a merge I did on this (though I forget the exact one). Thanks for the patch, Cory.\n. Hi, @tsakoyan. Thanks for your pull request\u2014my apologies for taking so long to review it.\n\nI was hoping you could help clarify what this code fixes, and tell me a little more about what's going on in the code. There seems to be a lot of similar-looking code in `-insertOrUpdateObjectsFromRepresentations:ofEntity:fromResponse:withContext:error:completionBlock:`; is there any way that your patch could be refactored to use this function? Likewise with `-updateBackingObject:withAttributeAndRelationshipValuesFromManagedObject:`; is there any overlap there?\n. As of e8c6472bf42f763d77e5c5ca584099abd555f906, AFIncrementalStore is no longer being actively maintained. Thank you for your contributions; my sincere apologies for any inconvenience this may have caused.\n. Thank you so much for the thoughtful pull request, @julienfantin. I hadn't realized that a `NSSaveChangesRequest` would have its object references removed as each one saves, although I guess that's actually a reasonably side-effect.\n\nI've merged this in with some an inline comment explaining what's going on.\n\nThere are a few things I'm worried about, but can respond to as they prove themselves out:\n- The cost of copying all of the objects. Could this ever become unreasonable to the point of affecting performance?\n- Whether there's any use in getting the resulting `NSSaveChangesRequest`, with all of the saved objects removed. If there are objects that _aren't_ saved, do they stick around in the request?\n\nThose will be something to watch out for going forward, but for now, this seems like a reasonable and useful patch. Thanks again!\n. > When it's different it's different in a consistent way... the fetchLimit is fetchLimit+1.\n\nWell, you know what they say, there are two problems in programming: naming things, threading, and off-by-one errors.\n\nTotally bizarre, that.\n\nBut you're spot-on as far as the fetch request goes\u2014I totally missed that this was being passed further down the line. I'll merge that in now.\n. Thanks again for the patch!\n\nLet me know if you have any more leads on the bizarre off-by-one error. Just Core Data being cheeky, maybe?\n. Yep, a vestige of when it used SQLite. Thanks for the patch.\n. Indeed it is. I'll package all of the latest commits into a new tiny release now.\n. Dang, that typo again? I swear, I've probably gotten that wrong more than I got it right. Thanks for the pull request.\n. Looks good. Always glad to merge in documentation. Thanks, dude!\n. Glad to see that the solution was so straightforward. Thanks for sending this patch.\n. I'm a bit squeamish about automatically translating arbitrary integers to dates. If the server sent a number when a date was expected, there's almost certainly a problem somewhere along the line. It's not hard to imagine this leading to a weird class of error where dates from the server are inexplicably Jan 1, 1970, because it sent back a `0`.\n\nAny update on the sub-entity patch?\n. Good call. Thanks so much for the patch, @zulfishah. Sorry it took so long to merge this in.\n. Great! I've seen other data providers adopt this convention, which makes this all-the-more applicable.\n.

Cherry-picked lines to commit in 39e407a. Thanks for the patch!\n. Good call. Merged in 7b8c4de. Thanks!\n. This looks like a great patch, @alvinhu. Thanks so much, and apologies for taking so long to get around to taking a look at it.\n\nIf I'm not mistaken, wouldn't this logic be useful for the other fetch request result types as well? Would it make sense to put this outside the `switch` statement, and have all of that translated into the backing context?\n.

Thank you for your contributions; my sincere apologies for any inconvenience this may have caused.\n. Indeed, this is correct. Although unlikely, I added a check for `representationOrArrayOfRepresentationsOfEntity` to be an `NSDictionary` with 75923beb576d92055428aa4c30a851c5d0a3bebe. Cheers!\n. Merged! Tagging 0.4.1 with this now. Thanks, @jerryhjones!\n. Again, a flurry of recent changes made it impossible to merge directly, but 03fc331 is credited to you, and should make the same change. Thanks, @Metamogul!\n. Thanks for the patch, @marthinfreij. With all of the changes I've made recently, I wasn't able to merge this cleanly, but b6582bc is credited to you, and (should) have the equivalent diff. Cheers!\n. Sorry for taking so long to get around to this.\n\nHow do your changes to the `__strong` / `__weak` references relate to the changes made in #193? Is this ready to go, or did #193 address this?\n. Thanks, @jerryhjones.\n. Thanks for the fixes, @Metamogul. I've been working hard on AFIncrementalStore over the last couple of days, so I was only able to merge e9cbf6a, which I cherry-picked as a1bcc2ffa282d07b27393ec65df42b997e4fa1ed. Cheers!\n. Much obliged. Cheers, @dulaccc!\n. Thanks, @agassiyzh :+1: \n. Yikes. That's embarrassing. I'm definitely not the first, nor the last person to flip-flop an `NSValueTransformer`, but still... \n\nAnyway, thanks for the patch, @t089.\n. Thanks for the patch, @ric2z. FWIW, the version there is unnecessary (especially with the library not yet at 1.0), so I removed it outright with e7b6b05d239665b6b295c377bb5c496a5be64356.\n. Thanks for your patch, @MattNewberry. This is an interesting idea, but the implementation is rather brittle, since it relies on a specific predicate format pattern. My intention with the original design was for the user to implement this logic in the `-requestForFetchRequest:withContext:` method, using `NSExpression` to extract the necessary components and handle routing according the specific needs of the application.\n\nYours is a great example of how one might implement that, but it's a little too specific to be incorporated as a core feature.\n. @davidbitton It's pretty much copy-paste from one method into the other for your particular `AFRESTClient` subclass.\n. Thanks for the patch, @baarde. I'll be pushing a new bugfix release (0.5.1) shortly.\n. Actually, this is by design: an object cannot have a permanent ID until the server returns a resource identifier. I'm not entirely sure what the correct workaround is for webservices that send blank 201 responses, but I don't think this is it, unfortunately...\n. D'oh. :sweat:\n\nThanks, @jerryhjones.\n. This is great, @jerryhjones. It looks like I'll have to add logic for resetting ordered relations, but other than that, this is really helpful. Thanks!\n. Actually, scratch that\u2014I misunderstood the purpose of the `isToMany` check. Looks good!\n. Nice. Thanks for the patch, @baarde.\n.

But not set the relationship back after inserted. So I had to manually set it back to the managed object.\nAny idea?\n. Oh I found that current implementation is crash my program\nI think you should use relationship.destinationEntity in ofEntity: argument?\n. Thanks :)\nWhat's about the other problem?\nI'm not sure that my solution is good enough.\n. WOWWW That's great!\n\nThank you for your great work :)\n. Well, I removed it and it work properly on my app.\nAnyway you still have to remove observer returned from the addObserverForName:object:queue:usingBlock: right?\n. It has the problem with backing context now. I'm looking for nit now\n. It's seem to work properly now :)\n. Well there are relationship values is disappear form from backing store in some case. I'm investingating on it now. Hope can fixed in soon.\n. It's seem to work properly now.\nIf you find problem please tell me :)\n. I sort the fetched objects with the fetch request's sort descriptors in 862b4c7\n. Others changes is for handling the invalid (nil) request. So it's not quite related to the issue. Sorry for unrelated codes.\n. The Managed Objects is not thread safe so I think we should post notification on the operating thread.

Thank you @conradev for the point.\nUpdate the code in 1bbca5b8708194d62f8eb8ff2c545a61e1421e75\n.

After have given it some thought, I didn't really understand why this `__strong` and `__weak` modifications should do the trick and prevent deadlocks. I realized, though, that the `__weak` modifier on `weakChildContext` could lead to the context being released long before it will get reassigned to `strongChildContext` within the success block, since `__weak` doesn't guarantee the survival of the object in any way. Nevertheless, `__block` was intended for exactly that purpose, and it worked for me instead of `__weak`. Any other thoughts?\n. After refreshing my knowledge of CoreData concurrency and nested contexts, I gave debugging this deadlock mess another round, and I might have identified a serious issue: When carefully formatting the kinda messy and uncommented AFIS code of `newValueForRelationship:...`, I stumbled upon the following messages enclosing the contexts `save:` operations, whose benefit I somehow didn't get before:\n\n``` obj-c\nid observer = [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserverForName:NSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotification object:strongChildContext queue:[NSOperationQueue mainQueue] usingBlock:^(NSNotification *note) {\n                            [context mergeChangesFromContextDidSaveNotification:note];\n                        }];\n\n                        // ...

The mentioned code, which I therefore consider as unnecessary and possibly even dangerous, might lead to more than one issue:\n1. I'm not sure if merging changes twice could lead to crashes and collisions, since saving a child context already automatically pushes the changes to the parent, merging them in. Most probably nothing would happen at all, since the changes are already in place - but we shouldn't just rely on possibilities. At least, a safe but unnecessary operation could cut down on AFIS overall performance.\n2.

At least, the amount of deadlocks occurring during tests with my testing app seems to have substantially diminished. I've already seen this in an older temporary fix of the deadlock issue I can't find atm, but back then I didn't get the reason for cutting out these lines of code. Now, I think I have learned and can state that removing them would definitely improve stability and decrease the number of deadlocks produced by AFIS.\n\nWould do you think?
