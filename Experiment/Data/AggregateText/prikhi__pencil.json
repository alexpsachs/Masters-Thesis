I wasn't sure if `scrollbar` referred to an wireframe element or to the Pencil window's actual scrollbar, so I tested this with both.\n\nWith a vertical scrollbar for the window(caused by having a page height setting that is less than the window's working area height), I couldn't get the scrollbar to disappear by increasing(or decreasing) the Page's height. Same when putting a vertical scrollbar element on a Page.\n. _From [dgthanhan](https://code.google.com/u/dgthanhan/) on July 09, 2008 08:41:23_\n\nThe hyperlink function in richtext component is to make a portion of text to be\nrendered as a hyperlink. And that is all what it do, at least for now.\n\nI think that we should implement the functionalities you described here as some thing\ncalled 'Interaction behaviour' which defines an action to be invoked when a specific\nevent occurs on an element. This will be applicable on all elements like buttons...\n\nThe results of this should be that the exported HTML set is navigatible by users by\ninteraction with the elements.\n\n**Status:** Accepted  \n  **Owner:** dgthanhan  \n  **Labels:** -Type-Defect Type-Enhancement  \n. _From [weedfl...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/112810357085890613402/) on August 22, 2008 08:47:00_\n\nI concur.

Since it all happens very fast, the user won't notice.\n\nAnother problem is when opening a document from command line when a Pencil window is\nalready open. It seems Xulrunner now also passes \"-app\", \"application.ini\" and\n\"-console\" (no clue why), and this ends up in the file path being loaded.

Download one stencil, the Dojo one is fine.\n2. Try to install it in Pencil 2.05\n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\nThe stencil is not installed. It gives \"Error installing collection\". \n\nA similar error message is known if I try to install an already-installed Template by \"Tools / Manage Export Template\u2026\", button \"Install New Template\u2026\", where it is right. \n\nHere such error message is not right, as there is no name conflict, if a Stencil is not yet installed, or installed manually.\n\nWhat version of the product are you using? On what operating system?\nI'm using the standalone version of Pencil 2.05 on Win7 ( I got Firefox 22 installed, with which the Firefox plugin does no work )\n\nA workaround is to install the stencils manually:\n1. Extract the archives in \u201d<PencilProfile>/Pencil/Stencils\u201d directory.\n2. For the standolone (xulrunner) version:\nBy example, on win7 by default: \u201d%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Pencil\\Profiles{your-profile-name}\\Pencil\\Stencils\u201d\n3. For the Firefox extension version:\nBy example, on win7 by default: \u201d%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles{your-profile-name}\\Pencil\\Stencils\u201d\n4. Each Stencil has its own a directory in this directory, with a \u201cDefinition.xml\u201d file (and some other optional files).\nBy example:\n\u201d[\u2026]\\Pencil\\Stencils\\ExtJs.GUI_v11\\Definition.xml\u201d.\n\u201d[\u2026]\\Pencil\\Stencils\\ExtJs.GUI_v11\\Icons[\u2026]\u201d.\n. _From [gregory....@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/103343291109575242106/) on November 19, 2013 09:26:13_\n\nHi,\nI'm in the same situation as Rolf.\nI have exported a collection form Pencil (Firefox add-on) and tried to import it in Pencil stand alone, and I have got this message \"Error installing collection\" without any details.\nBut I have successfully import \"iOS Wireframe\" for exemple\u2026\n. _From [ralflehm...@googlemail.com](https://code.google.com/u/115671393915063348259/) on February 25, 2010 01:11:12_\n\nseems to be a duplicate of `#32` I think!?\nBut type \"Defect\" of this issue seems to be correct for me instead of \"Shape\nEnhancement\" in `#32`...\n\nPlease look at my comment on `#32` as well.\n. _From [mar...@heidt-tech.com](https://code.google.com/u/100416503401256105382/) on August 05, 2010 05:57:35_\n\nThis doesn't seem to the same as `#32`, because it is possible to create more tabs on a Tab Box.\nBut this issue should have a higher priority.\nThe bug doesn't show up only when copying and pasting but even when you export the pages to png. \nTherefore it's not possible to use this tool in a real work environment without using a screenshot-tool.\n\nversion 1.2\n. _From [gernot.s...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/102264719838988707770/) on August 19, 2010 05:43:08_\n\nExactly the same happens here...\n\nFF 3.6.8\nPencil 1.2 build 0\n. _From [maffyew...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/115137739123252137569/) on September 28, 2010 07:03:53_\n\nI'm getting exactly the same thing on win 7, latest build.\n\nI agree with comment 2.

Holding down SPACE activate free canvas scrolling when dragging w/ mouse\n2.\n3.\n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\n\nWhat version of the product are you using? On what operating system?\nVersion 1.2 on Windows 7\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nI propose introducing a flexible scrolling mode across canvas, like seen in most Adobe products (and in wireframing tools like Balsamiq Mockups, Cacoo, etc.).\n\nIn Cacoo, you can hold down the SPACE bar on the keyboard, enabling the user to drag (scrolling) the canvas by dragging w/ mouse. This is a very convenient way of quickly navigating a large canvas, instead of having to drag the scrollbars.\n. _From [podgor...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/118126680857920021085/) on June 20, 2010 09:43:49_\n\nSame for me, but my Win XP is on a virtual machine with Sun Virtual box.

I think they got this one right (delete forward is less frequently used ;). Anyway, ideological arguments it would be great if the keyboard mappings were either configurable or mapped to platform-specific idioms.

The resulting file should work fine in Firefox (where the foreignObject tag of SVG is well supported), but libraries like batik (used in apache fop for example) will have trouble with the XHTML, XUL or XLink in it.

However, the main thing is that you can continue writing mockups on Firefox 4.\n. _From [ngtdungnt@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/ngtdungnt@gmail.com/) on October 19, 2011 01:08:16_\n\n**Status:** Fixed  \n. _From [jeanluc....@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/106726802250387182133/) on October 19, 2011 04:45:19_\n\nGot the latest release: same issue with FF7! :-( Is this only related to FF version number?\n. _From [kvitorou...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/109642362688779776723/) on July 05, 2011 05:41:14_\n\nsame for me on Vista\n. _From [paco_cas...@yahoo.es](https://code.google.com/u/107160567240417038975/) on August 03, 2011 04:05:26_\n\nI'm using XUbuntu and I have the same problem so it does not seem to be related to the underlying O.S.\n.

Simply changing the supported version will cause some backgrounds to be missing from context menus (right click) and exporting images or using pages as background won't work if the stencil contains any XUL. Also sandbox evaluation has become more strict which breaks some stencil definitions. \n\nSee http://pencil-ff4.googlecode.com where some of these issues have been addressed.

I had trouble using this solution simply because of the size of the file generated by Pencil (~15MB of XML!). Using gVim, I was able to access the files, but then found that large portions of the file had been lost at the point of failure (Windows XP blue screen of death).\n\nThis is a particularly annoying error / bug given that I saved constantly throughout the build process. At the point of failure, large portions of the file were corrupted and entire pages within the file lost.\n\nOverall, I've unfortunately found Pencil to be full of bugs and I am constantly having to allow for it's unusual behaviour and instability.\n. _From [david.j....@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/108616800967017702882/) on April 29, 2013 05:00:45_\n\nI also had a similar problem when the program crashed in windows. I managed to change the file extension to xml, check the problem with XML copy editor ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/xml-copy-editor/?source=dlp ) and delete the corrupted parts and add the missing tags. Then changed the filename back to .ep and it was fine. Lost only one image.

I was having problems getting tables with more than a couple of rows to display correctly.  The table grid was not drawn the same as the text, so it would be out of alignment.  It also was not shading the header correctly and the X-position of the columns was slightly off.  I think I was able to fix most of the display problems with the table.\n\nThe increase of column count maximum from 12 to 20 is unrelated to the display problems above, was just due to my need to be able to show more columns.\n. _From [bpursley...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/110050579682813027108/) on June 08, 2012 08:59:02_\n\nI just noticed that a similar fix for table layout issues has already been done in the 2.0 branch of the code.

At the time it happened to me I was so frustrated I didn't think of this. Files aren't completly deleted from the hard disk even when you remove them from recycle bin; they are labeled as deleted so that the system is free to overwrite them when it needs it.\n\nThere are different softwares out there that scans your hard drives for deleted files\n(I used Recuva - http://www.piriform.com/recuva ). I don't know if there are other best software out there, this one was recommended by a friend too and it worked for me... eccept from a collection of large \"*.mpg\" practically the copy of one year of of recordings from my video-camera's memory. Precious moments, all gone...forever.\n\nBut is highly recommended that you use a recover software right after the deletion was made in order to increase your chances of success (or as soon as possible and trying not to make to many operations or reboot the system).\n\nThe irony is that by just searching and downloading the desired file recovery software you may overwrite important data.\n\nI wish you all the best.\nHope you recover all the files you need.\n. _From [rartdesi...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/112391468365054508736/) on October 17, 2012 03:30:59_\n\nPS: try not to download the software in the location your files were lost.\n(not that this will ensure you that they wont be rewrited but it can increase your chances).\n.

Problem appears to be specific to what is being dragged. Some objects refuse to drag at all. Some will work on a new page but then fail as soon as something else is added. There doesn't appear to be any clear reason why.\n\nSteps to reproduce running within firefox on Ubuntu 12.04.  \n1. Create new page.\n2. Drag Rectangle on to page.\n3. Drag oval onto page.\n\nStep 3 fails. It cannot be dragged onto the page. Attempting to add a new rectangle also fails until a new page is open.\n\nEffectively the problem makes Pencil unusable both under Windows 7 (64-bit) as standalone and within Firefox under Ubutnu 12.04. \n\nI would suggest that the priority is increased from medium to a higher level as currently the tool is unusable in the environments I have tested.\n. _From [james.g....@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/106277629041379334470/) on September 14, 2012 16:46:44_\n\nWhile doing further testing have determined that under the Ubuntu 12.04/Firefox environment that the drag failure is related to the speed of the drag operation. \n\nIf the drag is slow enough then the drag to add a shape to the page works 100% of the time.\n\nIf the drag action is above a certain speed then the drag fails.\n\nThis appears to be the reason why it's hard to recreate as speed of the drag operation is what affects the failure of the page to become a target. It appears that what happens is the page is made a target of the drag operation briefly, but then the page is removed as a drag target, thus stopping the drag operation to work. \n\nThe work around is to drag slowly. It is possible that this is a problem for people who have enabled fast acceleration of their mouse (which I have, on both environments). The reason for enabling fast acceleration is because on environment makes use of a 30 inch monitor and the other uses two large monitors.\n.

One day I may get to this, but there is a lot to wade through - any help would be appeciated. Evolus still has their stencil development guide up:\nhttp://pencil.evolus.vn/wiki/devguide/Introduction.html\n. That'd be awesome! \n\nMuch of my time has been spent reading, comprehending, fixing & cleaning all this code. So it'll probably be a while before I get ready to learn about & tackle issues for stencils - any help is appreciated :)\n\nDon't feel obligated to wait for #676 to update the docs - anything changed in the repo will get updated when I convert everything. But don't feel obligated to do it now either... Just don't feel obligated in general :P\n\nIf you like, we could merge your Android stencils so they're included in every Pencil install. Although I've wondered why the original authors decided to [distribute zips of contributed stencils](https://code.google.com/p/evoluspencil/downloads/list?q=label:Stencil) instead of just merging them into the repo. Maybe there is a good reason for it, maybe not...\n. Yeah, I figured it might be easier for stencil maintainers if they were in a different repository. I was first thinking I could simply add the submodules under the appropriate directory in the `app` folder, but that wouldn't work for collections like your Material Icons - which need to be built. Maybe I'll modify the build script to download, include(and build, if necessary) any 3rd party stencils when building the application.\n\nDo you know if it's possible for users to override a collection if the collection already exists within Pencil's code?\n. I've split those out into #677 and #678 \n. Closing, nathielw's stencil collection solves this :)\n. _From [davidiwi...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/116658443317468468448/) on July 04, 2013 21:04:26_\n\nSame problem... can't find help anywhere on the internet\n. _From [lzh...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/100610675404619429232/) on December 04, 2014 19:17:53_\n\nGot the same error and found the solution in a comment in another issue. \n\nChanged in Evolus\\Pencil\\app\\defaults\\preferences\\pencil.js the line :\n\npref(\"intl.locale.matchOS\", true);\n\nto\n\npref(\"intl.locale.matchOS\", false);\n\nthat resolves the error in the error console for me.

Although now I'm thinking maybe this wasn't necessary...\n\nIt seems like pencil-animation turned into pencil2d & started storing stuff in /opt/ instead of /usr/.\n\nDoes anyone still need this?\n. Well my now main concern is that this fork has nothing to do with Evolus, so I think it would be best to change it to pencil or pencil-prototyping or something along those lines. \n\nI did some more digging & the original pencil animation project the OP was submitting died & was forked into this: http://www.pencil2d.org/\n\nI downloaded the package for the 0.5.4 release & it looks like the executable & the folder is named `pencil2d` now, so I think it is safe to switch back to using just `pencil` for the data - unless there is another linux app with the name `pencil`(I didn't find one on Arch or Nix).\n. _From [mario.fa...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/100780531785855758638/) on October 27, 2012 07:20:38_\n\nI notice the same problem:\n- Version 2.0.2 Firefox plugin is not able to draw straight line\n- Version 1.3.4 Firefox plugin is able to draw straight line\n\nVery limiting issue since apply on all the Sketchy Stencils\n. _From [manuel.r...@googlemail.com](https://code.google.com/u/101650981603591826220/) on October 01, 2013 21:38:11_\n\nI have fixed this error.

In the original exported SVG, the problem is a <rect> object:\n\n<g inkscape:label=\"Untitled Page\" xmlns:inkscape=\" http://www.inkscape.org/namespaces/inkscape \" inkscape:groupmode=\"layer\" id=\"layer_untitled_page\"><g><rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"1624\" height=\"1624\" fill=\"none\"/>\n\nSo, please ignore the XML I pasted earlier.

Click any control within designer area (windows form, group box, text control)\n2. Press CTRL + A (select all)\n3. Right click and Go to properties\n4. You will get Multiple objects properties window\n5. Select check box colour above check box Advance mode is colour picker is disabled\n6. Select black colour and set opacity 100% (slider control is there)\n\nAll the texts will be visible\n(y)\n. Going through previous issues, it looks like this only affects the Native UI Stencil Collection & is fixed by reverting to 2.0.3. Maybe diffing HEAD against v2.0.3 will show the issue.\n. Backgrounds, shapes & labels are messed up in exports until the Page's tab is selected as well.\n. Many hours have been sunk into this - no resolution yet. \n\nI've been looking at how Pencil loads the initial document - but it might be a problem with the stencils themselves instead.\n. Poked at this some more... doesn't seem like a notable difference between the Stencil Definitions of the working Sketchy Labels & the broken Native Labels.\n\nI poked around at the Shape prototype for a little & will probably pick up my investigation there.\n\nOn the plus side, I'm learning tons about the codebase as I slowly comb through everything to figure this out...\n. @amarach78 You can grab the old source from the google code project page:\nhttps://code.google.com/p/evoluspencil/downloads/list\n\nThe fact that I didn't find anything in the diff might mean that some change in the xulrunner/firefox framework caused this issue instead of some code in this repo. Or maybe I just missed something.\n. That's great, thanks. The next step is to figure out the version of xulrunner that broke the native stencils so we can look at the release notes for that version & figure out what changed and broke the stencils.\n\nI might be able to get to that in the next few days(unless you're interested in taking it on). \n. Thanks, I'll checkout the update notes for xul 17 and try poking around again.\n. Sorry all, been trying really hard to fix this... \n\nI can't find anything about using native GUI widgets in XUL. Can't even seem to find the release notes for XRE v17 to see what changed :( I think the last resort may have to be diffing the whole codebase from v16.0.2 -> v17 and pick through to see what might've broken this...\n. @mvdw It's a XUL button, not an HTML button:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XUL/button\n\nHTML button would be marked up like `<html:button>...</html:button>`\n. I was able to get button text to load by removing the `font-size:0px;` from the surrounding `html:div` element in the stencil:\n\n``` xml\n<html:div xmlns:html=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"div\" style=\"-moz-box-sizing: border-box; overflow: hidden; position: relative; line-height: 1px !important; font-size: 0px;\" xmlns=\"http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul\">\n    <button id=\"xulControl\"\n            style=\"margin: 0px !important; min-height: 0px !important; min-width: 0px !important; -moz-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box;\" />\n    <html:div style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%;\"/>\n</html:div>\n```\n\nHowever, the loaded button's styling is different and changes when you edit it's text...\nMore digging to go...\n. _From [manuel.b...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/106089385688690789630/) on November 12, 2013 03:15:34_\n\nmaybe the log helps\n\n**Attachment:** [LOG_crash_pencil-2.06_on-open-document.txt](http://code.google.com/p/evoluspencil/issues/detail?id=603#hc1)\n. _From [manuel.b...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/106089385688690789630/) on November 12, 2013 03:26:22_\n\ni can reproduce the problem both in the standalone and firefox version, it seems to be a problem with mavericks, cause of with Pencil 2.05 we could reproduce the problem before i update Pencil to 2.06 expecting it was a problem \"fixable\" with the update.\n\nSumarizing, the problem is a crash in Pencil when the user select a folder opening or saving a document.\nWith Pencil 2.05 not always occur (i'm not sure, i update early), in mavericks always occur.\n. _From [MEL_Lang...@yahoo.co.uk](https://code.google.com/u/114240283049982532068/) on November 12, 2013 03:49:57_\n\nThanks.\n\nI did try to use the FireFox plugin and also discovered that the only way I could re-load the document I had created was to use the \u201crecent\u201d documents list.\n\nUnfortunately there is a bigger problem with the Fire Fox plugin in that after creating a wireframe design, when I attempt to reload it all I get is a single vertical line, about 3\u201d long, in the middle of the layout area where my design should be.\n\nThe only workaround that I am left with is to spin up a VM on my mac and run evoluspencil from that.\n. _From [manuel.b...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/106089385688690789630/) on November 12, 2013 07:14:38_\n\ni am updating the error i see when i try to \"save as\" an select a folder...\n\n**Attachment:** [Captura de pantalla 2013-11-12 a la(s) 16.12.02.png](http://code.google.com/p/evoluspencil/issues/detail?id=603#hc4)\n. _From [manuel.b...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/106089385688690789630/) on November 25, 2013 03:48:43_\n\nHello, i've found the problem. \nIt's not Pencil at all, as we supposed.\n\nIt's a problem with mavericks.\n\nThe point is you can't be able of open or \"save as\" or even save a file with the \"Cover Flow\" view active.\n\nIf you choose Column View, List View or Icon View, the problem disappear, and you can work as you expect with files.

I made a thread to see if I could take over the existing extension instead of re-releasing:\nhttps://forums.mozilla.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=24109\n. Hooray! I appreciate any time spent on this :)\n\nFor setting up the initial structure, see: http://sphinx-doc.org/tutorial.html\nMost of the docs will most likely be just plain RST: http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html\nAlthough additional Sphinx constructs may be useful: http://sphinx-doc.org/markup/index.html\n\nYou can ignore all the autodoc, cross-referencing & javascript domain stuff for now(although if `sphinx-quickstart` asks please switch the default domain to javascript).\n\nThanks & let me know if you run into any problems!\n. Awesome!\n\nFor links to sections, I'd recommend adding a label before the section header & linking to that using `ref`, instead of using rst links.\n\nFrom: http://sphinx-doc.org/markup/inline.html#ref-role\n\n```\nUsing ref is advised over standard reStructuredText links to sections (like\n`Section title`_) because it works across files, when section headings are\nchanged, and for all builders that support cross-references.\n```\n. Live at http://pencil-prototyping.rtfd.org\nGonna do a little cross-referencing & re-organization before closing this.\n. Welp that last commit makes it show tutorial pages in the sidebar when you build them locally - for some reason RTDs doesn't pick up the template override. I will investigate...\n. @nathanielw The online docs now have the sidebar nesting you requested: https://pencil-prototyping.readthedocs.org/en/latest/devguide/tutorial/index.html\n\nI've also reviewed & added cross-references to the Reference guide.\n\nI think that pretty much wraps up this ticket, but I haven't developed a Stencil yet so I don't know what would be super useful to include. Additional feedback welcome, otherwise I'll close this off in a couple of days.\n. At some point I'll move the less useful docs out of the readme & into sphinx(like maintainer-only info), but I'm going to go ahead & close this now.\n. If we were to use JSON I think it'd be best to have something like this:\n\n``` json\n[\n  { \"name\": \"Material Icons\",\n    \"repo\": \"http://github.com/nathanielw/Material-Icons-for-Pencil.git\",\n    \"buildCommand\": \"\",\n  },\n]\n```\n\nThat way:\n- we can use `name` to determine the folder to create in the `content/pencil/stencil/` folder(stripping spaces or replacing them with underscores)\n- the `repo` isn't tied to github\n- a `buildCommand` can be specified, or left blank to indicate no building is required\n\nWe would have to pick some cli utility to parse the JSON file for use in `build.sh` (`jq` or `jshon` come to mind - not sure which is more popular).\n\nAs an aside: I'd really love to use `YAML` instead of `JSON` for human-edited things like this, but the dearth of YAML CLI utilities makes this seem improbable.\n\nIf we go with submodules, we'd probably stick them somewhere like `build/Stencils/` & copy the folders directly(so we wouldn't need a `name`).  We could check for a `Definition.xml` file to figure out whether the collection needs to be built or not. I think the build commands would have to be hardcoded into `build.sh` - unless we asked stencil devs to have a standardized build file for us to hook up to. Updating the submodules would have to become part of the release process(`git submodule foreach git pull origin master`).\n\nSo it seems like JSON would be more maintainable & expandable, although it would add a little more knowledge overhead for comprehending the build system(knowing JSON & whatever utility we use to parse it).\n. Sorry I didn't mean to make it seem like I was against using JSON, I just wanted to list out the pros & cons, so I could think on it. I think it's an OK trade off, but I imagined it would only be knowledge required for Pencil's developers/maintainers & stencil developers. So this little bit confuses me:\n\n> users wouldn't need the overhead of knowing a new markup language really\n\nAre you saying we should let end-users install collections by adding a username & repo in a config file, similar to [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) or [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug/)?\n\nI'm thinking of something like getting stencil devs to supply a `manifest.json` with their collection that contains a bunch of metadata, including the following attributes:\n- `name`\n- `version` \n- `downloadUrl`\n- `requiresBuild`\n- `buildCommands`\n- `manifestUrl`\n\nFor including collections with Pencil, we just add the repo to a file in `build/`. The build script can clone/update all repos listed in the file & check the `manifest.json` to see if a build is required.\n- If `requiresBuild` is true & `buildCommands` doesn't exist, the script will download the pre-built zip from `downloadUrl`(into some location dependent on the `version` in order to prevent redundant downloads). If `buildCommands` exists, the script will instead run them inside the cloned folder.\n- If `requiresBuild` is false, it'll just copy the files into `Outputs/Pencil/.../stencil/${name}` where `${name}` comes from `manifest.json`.\n\nWe can also eventually expand this into something that allows users to easily install & auto-upgrade collections. Users could enter a file path or url to a `manifest.json` or the collection's `.zip`. Pencil would download & compare `manifestUrl` to see if a newer version is available & download that using the `downloadUrl` instead. Then it could be handled like regular `zip` imports. For automatic updates, Pencil could compare the manfiest at `manifestUrl` to the installed `manifest.json`, if the version differs, it would automatically download & replace the collection from `downloadUrl`.\n\nThen, way in the future, we can use the `manifest.json` to create a `Pencil Stencil Repository` or something similar, where stencil devs can upload their `manifest.json`, screenshots, the collection's `.zip`, etc to some server. We could add a window to Pencil that talks to the server and fetches the `manifest.json`s and allows the user to browse, search & install all collections listed in the repository.\n\nThis heavily rips off of how firefox does addons, here's an example of what firefox stores(in your profile's `addons.json`): https://gist.github.com/prikhi/795a025c829b45769aa7\n\nComments? Suggestions? Feedback?\n\nI'd also love to hear from @nathanielw about all this, as he's the only active stencil developer I know of :P\n. I'm fine with ditching building collections, I only imagined building collections when building Pencil - not when users update or install a collection. The only benefit I saw(which seems small) was that whenever I build/release a new version of Pencil it would include the latest versions of the bundled collections instead of the last released ones.\n.

But now that I think about it, the latter isn't as big a deal - I'm failing to come up with reasonable circumstances where someone might want to replace a built-in collection instead of just upgrading(maybe an incompatible version of FF/XR?).\n\n> it wouldn't be too difficult to build a dependency management solution\n\nBy dependency management, do you mean version management? As far as I know there aren't dependencies between stencil collections(where one collection requires that another is installed).\n\nI was thinking stencil collections could have a `version`/`last-updated`/`modified` attribute or something similar, and Pencil could ensure you only replace a collection with a collection that has a higher version number. I don't see versioning as a _necessary_ requirement for this ticket, we could just let users replace a collection with any version of that collection.\n. Sorry I misspoke as well, I meant to say this ticket was meant for _all_ collections - built-in collections, bundled collections, **and** user-created/installed collections.\n\n> If we base it on github repositories it can easily check if there is an update to the repository and grab it automatically.\n> ...\n> Then it would be as simple as running a git pull on each collection to update when the application is launching.\n\nWhile I'm not opposed to automatically updating stencil collections, I meant for this issue to be more about allowing end-users to manually replace them on their individual installation/profile instead of requiring the stencil to be uninstalled first. So it seems to me to be a bit out of scope for this issue(correct me if I'm misunderstanding), but feel free to create a new issue for it if you'd like(or I can when I have some more free time).\n. Actually you can scroll to switch pages, but if you scroll past all pages that are currently displayed, the tab bar does not scroll to follow you.\n. Beautiful, thanks :)\n\nI built it on rtfd.org, check it out: https://evolus-pencil.readthedocs.org/en/sphinx-docs/\n\nStay tuned for comments.\n. Yup, `pencil` is taken so I changed it to `pencil-prototyping`, rtd is just taking its time with it.\n\nSeems like the only other comments I have are small knitpicks that I can just edit as I go through the diff. Could you rebase all this into a single commit? You should be able to do:\n\n``` bash\ngit remote add upstream git@github.com:prikhi/pencil.git\ngit fetch upstream develop\ngit rebase -i upstream/develop\n```\n\nThen mark as commits except your first one as `squash` & edit the commit message. Lemme know if you need more info.\n. Thanks :)\n. Thanks\n. Whew, thank you both for your doc improving efforts :)\n\nI will start my pass through them soon\n. Thanks :)\n. I checked out the [release docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/37) and it doesn't look like there's any breaking changes(breaking changes aren't separated out, usually have to search the page for `breaking` or `incompatible`).\n\nSo I've bumped it & will put out a new release & upload new builds for `2.0.9`.\n\nAs for PRs, I'd like to keep `MaxVersion` on a major version that has been tested(instead of just doing `MaxVersion=*`). The bare minimum tests I do are:\n- Can I load a file?\n- Can I save, quit then load without losing data?\n- Can I export to PNG?\n\nIf you attest to testing these things, I'll take a PR that bumps `MaxVersion`.\n. Tada: https://github.com/prikhi/pencil/releases/tag/v2.0.9\n. Beautiful thanks :)\n. Merged, thanks. Do you need a new release out for this?\n\nIf this makes Pencil install-able for all Gentoo users, feel free to add the relevant info to the readme\n. Thanks - I'm at the very end of my awake cycle, so I'll put a new release out once I've gotten some sleep.\n. I put out [v2.0.10](https://github.com/prikhi/pencil/releases/tag/v2.0.10)\n. Thanks again :)\n. Can you try [v2.0.10](https://github.com/prikhi/pencil/releases/tag/v2.0.10)\n. @donniezazen Related commit fixes this, caused by `#!/bin/sh` instead of `#!/bin/bash` in the `pencil` executable.\n. This is released as v2.0.11, let me know if everything is alright.\n. Fixed by #692 \n. There should be default templates. Pencil is looking in the wrong place when installed as an extension. Fix incoming.\n. Heya, I've been away for a while so I've got a backlog of stuff in all my projects, just quickly checking in so you know you're not being ignored. I will review & merge this soon-ish.\n. How should I package the folder for downloading? Is a zip OK? Or rar, tar?\n\nI'd like to add install directions to the readme. How does one go about installing the downloaded file(maybe this is obvious for Mac users)?\n\nOtherwise, looks good thanks :)\n. I merged this but rebased it so github doesn't want to acknowledge it :/\n. > I just realised this is already addressed in #667, sorry for the duplicate.\n\nIt's OK, the majority of the 500 or so issues on here were imported from Evolus' old bug tracker, so any confirmation that those issues are still occurring is helpful.\n\nThat said, I'm closing this as a duplicate, marking #667 as confirmed & assigning it to milestone v2.1.0, please subscribe to #667 if you want updates.\n. Not sure what you mean by `painter`. Do you mean the color selection tool? If not, can you please clarify or give instructions on how to reproduce this behavior.\n\nIf you mean the color selection tool, that can be exited by pressing your `Escape` key.\n. The escape key is commonly used throughout the app to \"escape\" from things like nav menus, text boxes, dropdowns, popups, etc. \n\nI'm gonna say this isn't really worth it right now because it'd be a button just to deselect the \"Copy Shape Format\" tool. It would be useful if we add more tools where the click action is replaced.\n. There are 2 ways to do this:\n1. In the `line` section to the right of the `color` toolbar section, set the number input to `0`(this controls the border width).\n2. Right click the shape & choose `Actions -> Remove Border`.\n\nDoes this seem OK?\n. If you're on Linux, you could try removing your `~/.cache/pencil` folder. There's profiles in `~/.pencil` as well.\n. Thanks!\n. The latest release(v2.0.11) fixes this.\n. Thanks!\n. I was thinking of something simple: a short description, download links for the current version, doc & github links and a list of features with screenshots. This could all fit on a single page so I was thinking either just HTML & CSS or using some Javascript library as well.\n\nI actually already did this as a way to test out [mercury.js](https://github.com/Raynos/mercury) but I thought my design was a little off. Maybe mercury.js  is too obscure of a library as well... I'll push it to the gh-pages branch soon so you can see what it actually looks like.\n\n![pencil-web](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1304102/8018019/2077ea1e-0bd6-11e5-9f1e-19d2b7c2b649.png)\n. I pushed it to the `gh-pages` branch, let me know what you think:\nhttps://github.com/prikhi/pencil/tree/gh-pages\nhttp://prikhi.github.io/pencil/\n. I've got the majority of it rewritten in plain HTML & bootstrap, I've just been too busy w/ other work to finish it up...\n\nI was thinking a simple page would be a little more \"user-friendly\" than using the docs, although that'd keep everything in one place...\n. And yeah, I didn't think we'd use mercury - that was just me playing around & I wanted to share the design.\n\nStatic site generators seem a little overkill to me(that's essentially what I wrote w/ mercury). Maybe I'm missing something though?\n. ^ Referenced wrong issue\n. Descriptive names and small functions are great, I would accept PRs that made those kinds of changes(and pretty much anything else from Code Complete or Clean Code). \n\nBut I'm sure there are people that are way more comfortable with just commenting than actually changing any code and I'd probably accept those PRs as well(& probably just clean it up myself).\n\nPlus, any class/function comments will be parsed into API Docs:\nhttps://pencil-prototyping.readthedocs.org/en/latest/developers/api.html\n\nSo this is _ideal_(but not expected):\n\n``` javascript\n/*\"\"\"\n.. function:: size_of_last_box(size_of_box)\n    Calculate the number of eggs in the last box, assuming all\n    of the boxes have a maximum size of ``size_of_box``.\n\n   :param size_of_box: The maximum size of a box.\n   :type size_of_box: Number\n   :returns: The number of eggs in the last box.\n   :rtype: Number\n*/\nfunction size_of_last_box(size_of_box) {\n  number_of_eggs = add_numbers(b,c) \n  return get_remainder(number_of_eggs, size_of_box) \n}\n```\n. Thanks!\n. I fixed it before checking for PRs >.< \nBut thanks :)\n. Thanks. In the future it'd be nice if links were added to the bottom(but not a big deal).\n. #713 Added the gitter badge. Should I add anything else?\n. Death to trailing whitespace!\n\nThanks :)\n. Merci beaucoup!\n. Thanks\n. If you're interested you could write it using Sphinx markup:\nhttp://pencil-prototyping.readthedocs.org/en/latest/developers/index.html#writing-documentation\nlike this:\nhttps://github.com/prikhi/pencil/blob/develop/app/content/pencil/common/pencil.js#L53-L67\nand it'll show up in the api docs:\nhttp://pencil-prototyping.readthedocs.org/en/latest/developers/api.html\n\nIf not, let me know & I'll merge it.\n. So this actually brings up a good question: what should the section nesting in the docs look like?\n\nIf you check out the current Pencil namespace API: https://pencil-prototyping.readthedocs.org/en/latest/developers/api.html#pencil\n\nit kinda looks like this:\n\n```\n* Class or Namespace\n      * attributes \n  * functions\n```\n\nWith your current indention it'll look like this:\n\n```\n* Class or Namespace\n      * attributes \n  * other functions\n* Pencil.setPainterCommandChecked\n```\n\nwhere the new function is below the Namespace instead of nested within it. I think a flat structure(where we un-nest the `attributes` & `other functions` like you did) might be better since everything is nested under a section header of the class or namespace already & you won't have to worry about the proper indentation when writing docs, you can just align it with the `/*\"\"\"`\n\nComments? Otherwise I'll probably merge this & fix the others\n. Heyo, I had actually meant that I would probably migrate the other indentations to match yours - sorry for the confusion.\n. Sorry for the delay, I thought github would email me when PRs were opened...\n. Thanks :)\n. I've kept the maxVersion to a version someone's tested Pencil on because I'm kinda paranoid of a backwards incompatible change destroying saved data... Maybe that's too paranoid?\n\nDo PNG exports work in v17? I believe this change in FF36 broke them:\n\n> The nsIWebBrowserPersist.saveURI() method now requires 8 arguments, in an order incompatible with previous releases.\n\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/36\n. FF36 made us make a change that breaks the app for every previous version of FF. If you try exporting a document as a PNG with a version before FF36 it will just hang. I think all export methods might've been broken by this. I think it's a good idea to keep it at 36.\n\nI'm running FF's dev release now so I'll at least keep the maxversion at that version number(currently 41), maybe bump it up to 200 or something.\n\nWindows builds have xulrunner packaged with them already.\n\nIf openSUSE's xulrunner is that old, I'd run a `sed` command when packaging that removes `xulrunner` from the `BINARIES` array in `/bin/pencil`(assuming opensuse's packaging system allows this) & then make the package depend on Firefox instead of xulrunner. That'll make sure it uses FF to launch instead of xulrunner.\n. Thanks :)\n. I changed it because the pencil2d animation software was installing under `/usr/share/pencil` on debian. I think they now use `pencil2d` instead so it should be OK to switch it back. See #499 instead.\n. Should be fine to fix it. Need to make sure to update the Arch Linux PKGBUILD if the folder name in `-linux-pkg.tar.gz` is modified. Will this require switching to `/usr/share/pencil`?\n. Thanks for packaging this :)\n. Thanks a lot! I'm about to go out of town for 2 weeks & I might not have time to review this before then.\n. Thanks, will release a new version with a .deb soon.\n\nThe `sudo chown -R root ...` line isn't necessary is it? It causes an error for me & everything seems fine with it removed.\n.

Thanks!\n. Can you just add a line like this to your package's build step:\n\n``` bash\nsed -i 's|BINARIES=\"xulrunner |BINARIES=\"|' ./Linux/pencil\n./build.sh linux\n```\n\nLaunching w/ firefox means that when firefox crashes, pencil crashes. So I'd prefer to keep the default to xulrunner.\n. Last time I tested I wasn't able to get this working. I will retest soon - I think I forgot to clear the cache or my profile.\n. This is in the readme already, under Builds -> Windows:\n\n```\nYou'll need curl installed so you can pull the Windows XULRunner runtime and nsis to compile the installer.\n```\n\nBut I went ahead & made `nsis` a link to the site.\n. Hey, this is in the Documentation section of the readme:\n\n```\ncd docs/\nsudo pip install -r requirements.txt\nmake html\n```\n. Thanks! New version soon.\n. Thanks!\n. Bout to release a new version, will try to get this in.\n. This exists & should be supported in the github & mozilla XPI files in the next version.\n\nShould I add anything in the Readme with respect to Palemoon before closing this?\n. OK did more reading, looks like exporting won't work because of breaking changes mozilla make to FFv38. People have asked for me to support a lower version of FF/XRE before, I will investigate.\n. Exporting now works in Palemoon as of v2.0.21. You should also be able to install it from the firefox addons page: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pencil-prototyping/\n. Also issue #802 does not occur when using with Palemoon.\n. Thanks, been holding out hoping the old author would get back to me about taking over the extension already on the AMO but I'll probably cave now.\n. Awaiting validation:\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pencil-prototyping/\n\nIf mozilla truly deprecates XUL, pencil will die unless it is re-written using the WebExtensions API - provided the API can actually provide equivalent functionality of XUL...\n. Thanks for bumping this and reminding me :)\n. Reopening this because at the rate that mozilla is approving plugins, it will take a year and a half for Pencil to be reviewed & signed... We are number 144 in the queue and haven't moved since I uploaded 3 days ago...\n\nI think the solution will be to keep that in the review queue and also upload an unlisted XPI that can be distributed via the github releases page. Unlisted addons get signed immediately so that would allow installation once FF hits v44(where I believe the ability to install unsigned plugins will be removed).\n. Unlisted XPIs are uploaded to AMO, just not shown in their addons directory, and thus are immediately signed instead of having to wait for approval.\n\nBut thanks to Noitidart, the listed Pencil addon has been approved early and can be installed without disabled the signature requirements:\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pencil-prototyping/\n. Thanks :)\n. Can you try installing this package and let me know if it works OK:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/jypxqi5hzv1alq5/pencil-2.0.14-ubuntu-all-debian-fix.deb?dl=0\n. Awesome, I'll go ahead an merge it.\n\nUnfortunately, using a version lower than 36 breaks all export methods:(\n. Looks better, thanks :)\n. Thanks, are the rightmost numbers `expected/actual`?\n. Only lintian error now is our lack of a manpage.\n. Thanks for this, I'm away from my home base at the moment, but I'll try to get this in soon.\n. I've been holding off on this - been thinking we should ask the mailing list or more users about which they prefer...\n\nIf one of you would like to make a post to the pencil-users google group, go ahead - otherwise I will at some point.\n\nAlso, feedback from contributers would be appreciated:\n@nathanielw @jdittrich @mvdw @just-paja @horacimacias @joemirizio @Zyzle @ovruni\n. These are great. \n\nMaybe it's a pen because we are manipulating stencils, and pen + stencil = pencil ??\n. Thanks :)\n. @bmarkovic Are you always behind a proxy? If not, does OpenClipart not work for you all the time?\n. Moving is easy, coming up with fair decision-making, & membership processes are the hard parts.\n. Thanks for catching that @igpremuo \n. Oops, actually that only applies for debian builds. I'll move all linux builds to either `pencil` or `pencil-prototyping` before the next release...\n. #499 \n. Fixed in `develop`, new version soon.\n. Awesome, thanks for contributing :)\n. Did you have any previous versions of Pencil installed?\n\nIf so, could you try running off of my `develop` branch with the `-purgecaches` option just to make sure this wasn't caused by an older version?\n\nLike this:\n\n``` bash\n./build.sh mac\nOutputs/Mac/XUL.framework/Versions/Current/xulrunner Outputs/Mac/Pencil.app/Contents/Resources/application.ini -purgecaches\n```\n\nIf you've tried the `develop` branch with no caches already let me know and I'll merge this.\n. Tested on linux as well, works great - thanks!\n. Hi, changing the max version should be fine. It's been done on the `develop` branch already.\n\nI'm not at home and my laptop's distro(NixOS) doesn't have everything to make a new release on the `master` branch - so it'll have to wait til the 29th or so, or I'll have to write a package for `nsis`.\n. AMO will automatically reject the plugin if the MaxVersion is too high. Went ahead & tested on FF Developer so should be good til v46 now.\n. (new release on the way)\n. for now you can disable extension signing by toggling `xpinstall.signatures.required` in `about:config`\n\nfirst priority for installs will be getting the unlisted XPI signed while we wait for the listed one to be reviewed. then I'll poke around debian installs. Might be a little while, on the road so I can't spin up a ubuntu VM to play around w/ it.\n. Awesome, I've been wanting this feature.\n\nI'll be traveling home all day tomorrow, then I gotta rebuild my desktop, I'll review it when I get everything all setup again.\n. Does the other pencil application store stuff in `/usr/share/pencil`? Is the binary named `pencil`? If so those will have to change as well, I will update the debian/ubuntu build script to deal with that in a couple of days and make a new release.\n. Haven't heard of anyone working on them. You might want to ask on the mailing list as well:\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pencil-user\n\nIf you find or start this project, feel free to submit a PR adding the collection to the Readme.\n. Should be possible by just changing `architecture` in `builds/Ubuntu/control` to `any` or `all`. The initial PR had it set to `amd64` & I didn't catch it, sorry about that.\n\nGrabbing Ubuntu i386 right now so I can test it out first.\n. Maybe try removing the `~/.pencil` folder XULRunner sets up? You could also see if `firefox --app /path/to/pencil/application.ini` works.\n. You could also try `xulrunner /path/to/application.ini --purgecaches`.\n. XPI is the application as a firefox addon, EXE is the application as a native Windows program. I don't use Firefox Cloud or know how it works so I can't comment on that, but both versions should let you save to the current computer.\n\nI merged the PR by @mikedlr and added a link to Mozilla's Addon Repository as well.\n\nAlso,  there is Google Group from the old Evolus Pencil that you can use:\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pencil-user\n. Should be fixed now.\n. Interesting, thanks for the report. Were no breaking changes in FF45 according to mozilla... Will investigate.\n. I'm pretty sure it's a bug in Firefox. There's nothing relevant in the release notes for FFv45.\n\nI made a bug: https://bugzil.la/1259385\n. https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1259385#c13\n\nGonna have to go through the nightlies & figure out which one breaks Pencil.\n. I don't really have the time to figure this out, sorry guys. If you're getting this bug, I suggest moving on to http://github.com/evolus/pencil.\n\nI'll keep bumping maxVersion hoping it'll be fixed in the future but if you want to continue using v2 either use an older firefox, or use xulrunner/palemoon. I'm using this repo, mostly with xulrunner but also with palemoon.\n. Wow, this is great, thanks a lot :)\n. Thanks!\n. Accidentally left a debug flag on when building the latest versions, 2.0.18 incoming soon.\n. Can you test 2.0.18? \nhttps://github.com/prikhi/pencil/releases/tag/v2.0.18\n. Sorry, internet died in the middle of my upload & I didn't notice. Should be up there now.\n. That looks like Norton 360 Total Security, not a Windows pop-up. The files under the `xulrunner` directory are distributed by Mozilla. If you trust Mozilla, you should allow the installer to create those target files.\n\nAnother option is to install firefox then create a `.bat` file that runs `firefox.exe -app C:/path/to/pencil/folder/application.ini`.  Installing somewhere other than `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\` might also prevent this.\n. Wow, didn't even know about Pencil v3. That's great because I have nowhere near the amount of free time it would take to get Pencil from XUL to Webextensions. My last ditch \"keep Pencil alive\" plan was going to be switching to supporting [Pale Moon](https://www.palemoon.org).\n\nI did try to contact them via Twitter & Email when I forked Pencil, & never got a response. Then I got an email from them saying they were going to bring it back & incorporate some of my changes - but I never heard back from them after that.\n. Got an email about this as well. I was able to open my `.ep` files from Pencil v2 but couldn't add new stencils to my document :/\n\nI'm going to see if D\u01b0\u01a1ng is willing to put up a project roadmap along with some issues so we can have some easy ways to hook into the new development.\n\nI think the future of this repo will be patching it to work with Pale Moon(even if they re-fork they said it will still support XUL) & releasing a linux version with a bundled xulrunner(like the windows & os x versions), just to make it last for people who can't switch to v3 for whatever reason.\n. There's a link to the new project in the readme, I will be keeping this project minimally-maintained for use w/ xulrunner/palemoon.. Thanks, might take me a couple days before I can look over it & test it out.\n. Thanks!\n. Merged, thanks!\n. Thanks again :)\n. Should be fixed.\n. Bumped this to 52 in the lastest release. . See #802\n. See #802\n. See #802\n. Awesome, thanks. I added a link to the icons in this repo's README.\r\n\r\nYou may want to let Evolus know as well, if they are compatible w/ v3(I don't know of any stencil differences between v2 & v3).. I added a link to v3 in the readme. I'll keep maintaining this but probably won't do much more development. I get the \"can't drag & drop\" bug in v3, so I'm still using this with xulrunner/palemoon.\n. Fixed\n. Should be fixed. I tried to keep it to versions I've tested but haven't had time to work on pencil for a while, especially since v3 exists now. If I have trouble keeping the maxVersion up to date, I'll just bump it up to 999 or something.\n. Should be fixed. You might want to check out the http://github.com/evolus/pencil repo as well.\n. Thanks.\n. For version 3, please open an issue with Evolus' repository: http://github.com/evolus/pencil. See #802\n. Yup, 3.0 issues should be reported to https://github.com/evolus/pencil. For version 3, please open an issue with Evolus' repository: http://github.com/evolus/pencil. Yeah this is a bug in newer FF versions & neither me nor mozilla have the time to figure out whats going on. I'll keep bumping maxVersion hoping it'll be fixed in the future but either use an older firefox, or use xulrunner/palemoon.\n. Did v49 fix the drag-and-drop issue?\n. Does 2.0.21 not work?. @giancarloandroid First release of this repository was v2.0.6. You should checkout the standalone version on this repo's Releases page, or http://github.com/evolus/pencil for v3.. See #802 \r\nFor ubuntu standalone, you can try installing xulrunner\r\nLet me know if you are experiencing a different issue & I'll re-open. Either use Pale Moon, Xulrunner, an older version of Firefox, or Pencil v3.\r\nSee #802. That is Evolus' home page, not this projects. Our downloads are on this github projects \"Releases\" page. Alternatively, checkout the Pencil v3 project: http://github.com/evolus/pencil. I think this is fixed by modifying our deb to include xulrunner instead of depending on firefox. This hasn't been fixed. Don't know when I will have the time to fix it.\r\n\r\nSomeone else could start by taking a look at the `ubuntu` function in `builds/build.sh`. The fix would include xulrunner in the package and modify the `pencil` script to call that xulrunner instead of firefox/iceweasel, then remove firefox/iceweasel from the ubuntu dependencies.. Pencil v3 is released, will only be doing minimal maintenance to this repo, I'd make an issue in the v3 repo: http://github.com/evolus/pencil . See #856 #802 and http://github.com/evolus/pencil.

I wasn't sure if `scrollbar` referred to an wireframe element or to the Pencil window's actual scrollbar, so I tested this with both.\n\nWith a vertical scrollbar for the window(caused by having a page height setting that is less than the window's working area height), I couldn't get the scrollbar to disappear by increasing(or decreasing) the Page's height. Same when putting a vertical scrollbar element on a Page.\n. _From [dgthanhan](https://code.google.com/u/dgthanhan/) on July 09, 2008 08:41:23_\n\nThe hyperlink function in richtext component is to make a portion of text to be\nrendered as a hyperlink. And that is all what it do, at least for now.\n\nI think that we should implement the functionalities you described here as some thing\ncalled 'Interaction behaviour' which defines an action to be invoked when a specific\nevent occurs on an element. This will be applicable on all elements like buttons...\n\nThe results of this should be that the exported HTML set is navigatible by users by\ninteraction with the elements.\n\n**Status:** Accepted  \n  **Owner:** dgthanhan  \n  **Labels:** -Type-Defect Type-Enhancement  \n. _From [weedfl...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/112810357085890613402/) on August 22, 2008 08:47:00_\n\nI concur.

I'm not sure if this work-around will work with the plug-in but why not try it?\n. _From [maxime.tennaxia@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/maxime.tennaxia@gmail.com/) on December 12, 2008 13:40:49_\n\n**Labels:** Type-Enhancement  \n. _From [maxime.tennaxia@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/maxime.tennaxia@gmail.com/) on December 15, 2008 11:40:49_\n\n**Labels:** Type-Shapes-Enhancement  \n. _From [maxime.tennaxia@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/maxime.tennaxia@gmail.com/) on December 12, 2008 13:40:49_\n\n**Labels:** Type-Enhancement  \n. _From [maxime.tennaxia@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/maxime.tennaxia@gmail.com/) on December 15, 2008 11:40:49_\n\n**Labels:** Type-Shapes-Enhancement  \n. _From [maxime.tennaxia@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/maxime.tennaxia@gmail.com/) on June 29, 2010 04:43:02_\n\ndone in v1.2\n\n**Status:** Fixed  \n. _From [brownsp...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/100468905672215389538/) on August 22, 2008 03:30:54_\n\nYou have a couple of options:\n- Select all elements in a page, create a new page, then paste them there.\n- Create a new page, using the page you want to clone as a background.\n. _From [jose.je...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/112754923660849174582/) on August 22, 2008 03:46:48_\n\nAbout the suggestions:\n- You can't select a background page as well, so you would only get the elements.\n- Using a page as a background is not the same as cloning, since you will not be able\n  to select the elements.\n. _From [maxime.tennaxia@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/maxime.tennaxia@gmail.com/) on December 10, 2008 13:03:34_\n\ndone in svn, \"duplicate tab\" feature\n\n**Status:** Fixed  \n. _From [brownsp...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/100468905672215389538/) on August 22, 2008 03:28:37_\n\nThis feature took a little getting used to, though I would vote to have it removed,\nas well.\n. _From [regis.ca...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/112086572837194561458/) on September 10, 2008 14:01:21_\n\nHere's a patch correcting the icon\n\n**Attachment:** [patch.diff](http://code.google.com/p/evoluspencil/issues/detail?id=30#hc1)\n. _From [dgthanhan](https://code.google.com/u/dgthanhan/) on October 07, 2008 11:03:21_\n\n**Status:** Fixed  \n. _From [camille....@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/108298495663202701145/) on January 01, 2010 12:19:25_\n\nThis is fixed in Pencil 1.1rc2\n. _From [maxime.tennaxia@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/maxime.tennaxia@gmail.com/) on December 10, 2008 13:23:20_\n\nuse my tab widgets in ExtJs shapes see download section\nor look at how it's done\n. _From [maxime.tennaxia@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/maxime.tennaxia@gmail.com/) on December 12, 2008 13:40:49_\n\n**Labels:** Type-Enhancement  \n. _From [maxime.tennaxia@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/maxime.tennaxia@gmail.com/) on December 15, 2008 11:40:49_\n\n**Labels:** Type-Shapes-Enhancement  \n. _From [ralflehm...@googlemail.com](https://code.google.com/u/115671393915063348259/) on February 25, 2010 00:56:41_\n\nI just faced the same problem.

Since it all happens very fast, the user won't notice.\n\nAnother problem is when opening a document from command line when a Pencil window is\nalready open. It seems Xulrunner now also passes \"-app\", \"application.ini\" and\n\"-console\" (no clue why), and this ends up in the file path being loaded.

Download one stencil, the Dojo one is fine.\n2. Try to install it in Pencil 2.05\n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\nThe stencil is not installed. It gives \"Error installing collection\". \n\nA similar error message is known if I try to install an already-installed Template by \"Tools / Manage Export Template\u2026\", button \"Install New Template\u2026\", where it is right. \n\nHere such error message is not right, as there is no name conflict, if a Stencil is not yet installed, or installed manually.\n\nWhat version of the product are you using? On what operating system?\nI'm using the standalone version of Pencil 2.05 on Win7 ( I got Firefox 22 installed, with which the Firefox plugin does no work )\n\nA workaround is to install the stencils manually:\n1. Extract the archives in \u201d<PencilProfile>/Pencil/Stencils\u201d directory.\n2. For the standolone (xulrunner) version:\nBy example, on win7 by default: \u201d%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Pencil\\Profiles{your-profile-name}\\Pencil\\Stencils\u201d\n3. For the Firefox extension version:\nBy example, on win7 by default: \u201d%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles{your-profile-name}\\Pencil\\Stencils\u201d\n4. Each Stencil has its own a directory in this directory, with a \u201cDefinition.xml\u201d file (and some other optional files).\nBy example:\n\u201d[\u2026]\\Pencil\\Stencils\\ExtJs.GUI_v11\\Definition.xml\u201d.\n\u201d[\u2026]\\Pencil\\Stencils\\ExtJs.GUI_v11\\Icons[\u2026]\u201d.\n. _From [gregory....@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/103343291109575242106/) on November 19, 2013 09:26:13_\n\nHi,\nI'm in the same situation as Rolf.\nI have exported a collection form Pencil (Firefox add-on) and tried to import it in Pencil stand alone, and I have got this message \"Error installing collection\" without any details.\nBut I have successfully import \"iOS Wireframe\" for exemple\u2026\n. _From [ralflehm...@googlemail.com](https://code.google.com/u/115671393915063348259/) on February 25, 2010 01:11:12_\n\nseems to be a duplicate of `#32` I think!?\nBut type \"Defect\" of this issue seems to be correct for me instead of \"Shape\nEnhancement\" in `#32`...\n\nPlease look at my comment on `#32` as well.\n. _From [mar...@heidt-tech.com](https://code.google.com/u/100416503401256105382/) on August 05, 2010 05:57:35_\n\nThis doesn't seem to the same as `#32`, because it is possible to create more tabs on a Tab Box.\nBut this issue should have a higher priority.\nThe bug doesn't show up only when copying and pasting but even when you export the pages to png. \nTherefore it's not possible to use this tool in a real work environment without using a screenshot-tool.\n\nversion 1.2\n. _From [gernot.s...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/102264719838988707770/) on August 19, 2010 05:43:08_\n\nExactly the same happens here...\n\nFF 3.6.8\nPencil 1.2 build 0\n. _From [maffyew...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/115137739123252137569/) on September 28, 2010 07:03:53_\n\nI'm getting exactly the same thing on win 7, latest build.\n\nI agree with comment 2.

Holding down SPACE activate free canvas scrolling when dragging w/ mouse\n2.\n3.\n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\n\nWhat version of the product are you using? On what operating system?\nVersion 1.2 on Windows 7\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nI propose introducing a flexible scrolling mode across canvas, like seen in most Adobe products (and in wireframing tools like Balsamiq Mockups, Cacoo, etc.).\n\nIn Cacoo, you can hold down the SPACE bar on the keyboard, enabling the user to drag (scrolling) the canvas by dragging w/ mouse. This is a very convenient way of quickly navigating a large canvas, instead of having to drag the scrollbars.\n. _From [podgor...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/118126680857920021085/) on June 20, 2010 09:43:49_\n\nSame for me, but my Win XP is on a virtual machine with Sun Virtual box.

I think they got this one right (delete forward is less frequently used ;). Anyway, ideological arguments it would be great if the keyboard mappings were either configurable or mapped to platform-specific idioms.

The resulting file should work fine in Firefox (where the foreignObject tag of SVG is well supported), but libraries like batik (used in apache fop for example) will have trouble with the XHTML, XUL or XLink in it.

However, the main thing is that you can continue writing mockups on Firefox 4.\n. _From [ngtdungnt@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/ngtdungnt@gmail.com/) on October 19, 2011 01:08:16_\n\n**Status:** Fixed  \n. _From [jeanluc....@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/106726802250387182133/) on October 19, 2011 04:45:19_\n\nGot the latest release: same issue with FF7! :-( Is this only related to FF version number?\n. _From [kvitorou...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/109642362688779776723/) on July 05, 2011 05:41:14_\n\nsame for me on Vista\n. _From [paco_cas...@yahoo.es](https://code.google.com/u/107160567240417038975/) on August 03, 2011 04:05:26_\n\nI'm using XUbuntu and I have the same problem so it does not seem to be related to the underlying O.S.\n.

Simply changing the supported version will cause some backgrounds to be missing from context menus (right click) and exporting images or using pages as background won't work if the stencil contains any XUL. Also sandbox evaluation has become more strict which breaks some stencil definitions. \n\nSee http://pencil-ff4.googlecode.com where some of these issues have been addressed.

I had trouble using this solution simply because of the size of the file generated by Pencil (~15MB of XML!). Using gVim, I was able to access the files, but then found that large portions of the file had been lost at the point of failure (Windows XP blue screen of death).\n\nThis is a particularly annoying error / bug given that I saved constantly throughout the build process. At the point of failure, large portions of the file were corrupted and entire pages within the file lost.\n\nOverall, I've unfortunately found Pencil to be full of bugs and I am constantly having to allow for it's unusual behaviour and instability.\n. _From [david.j....@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/108616800967017702882/) on April 29, 2013 05:00:45_\n\nI also had a similar problem when the program crashed in windows. I managed to change the file extension to xml, check the problem with XML copy editor ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/xml-copy-editor/?source=dlp ) and delete the corrupted parts and add the missing tags. Then changed the filename back to .ep and it was fine. Lost only one image.

I was having problems getting tables with more than a couple of rows to display correctly.  The table grid was not drawn the same as the text, so it would be out of alignment.  It also was not shading the header correctly and the X-position of the columns was slightly off.  I think I was able to fix most of the display problems with the table.\n\nThe increase of column count maximum from 12 to 20 is unrelated to the display problems above, was just due to my need to be able to show more columns.\n. _From [bpursley...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/110050579682813027108/) on June 08, 2012 08:59:02_\n\nI just noticed that a similar fix for table layout issues has already been done in the 2.0 branch of the code.

At the time it happened to me I was so frustrated I didn't think of this. Files aren't completly deleted from the hard disk even when you remove them from recycle bin; they are labeled as deleted so that the system is free to overwrite them when it needs it.\n\nThere are different softwares out there that scans your hard drives for deleted files\n(I used Recuva - http://www.piriform.com/recuva ). I don't know if there are other best software out there, this one was recommended by a friend too and it worked for me... eccept from a collection of large \"*.mpg\" practically the copy of one year of of recordings from my video-camera's memory. Precious moments, all gone...forever.\n\nBut is highly recommended that you use a recover software right after the deletion was made in order to increase your chances of success (or as soon as possible and trying not to make to many operations or reboot the system).\n\nThe irony is that by just searching and downloading the desired file recovery software you may overwrite important data.\n\nI wish you all the best.\nHope you recover all the files you need.\n. _From [rartdesi...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/112391468365054508736/) on October 17, 2012 03:30:59_\n\nPS: try not to download the software in the location your files were lost.\n(not that this will ensure you that they wont be rewrited but it can increase your chances).\n.

Problem appears to be specific to what is being dragged. Some objects refuse to drag at all. Some will work on a new page but then fail as soon as something else is added. There doesn't appear to be any clear reason why.\n\nSteps to reproduce running within firefox on Ubuntu 12.04.  \n1. Create new page.\n2. Drag Rectangle on to page.\n3. Drag oval onto page.\n\nStep 3 fails. It cannot be dragged onto the page. Attempting to add a new rectangle also fails until a new page is open.\n\nEffectively the problem makes Pencil unusable both under Windows 7 (64-bit) as standalone and within Firefox under Ubutnu 12.04. \n\nI would suggest that the priority is increased from medium to a higher level as currently the tool is unusable in the environments I have tested.\n. _From [james.g....@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/106277629041379334470/) on September 14, 2012 16:46:44_\n\nWhile doing further testing have determined that under the Ubuntu 12.04/Firefox environment that the drag failure is related to the speed of the drag operation. \n\nIf the drag is slow enough then the drag to add a shape to the page works 100% of the time.\n\nIf the drag action is above a certain speed then the drag fails.\n\nThis appears to be the reason why it's hard to recreate as speed of the drag operation is what affects the failure of the page to become a target. It appears that what happens is the page is made a target of the drag operation briefly, but then the page is removed as a drag target, thus stopping the drag operation to work. \n\nThe work around is to drag slowly. It is possible that this is a problem for people who have enabled fast acceleration of their mouse (which I have, on both environments). The reason for enabling fast acceleration is because on environment makes use of a 30 inch monitor and the other uses two large monitors.\n.

One day I may get to this, but there is a lot to wade through - any help would be appeciated. Evolus still has their stencil development guide up:\nhttp://pencil.evolus.vn/wiki/devguide/Introduction.html\n. That'd be awesome! \n\nMuch of my time has been spent reading, comprehending, fixing & cleaning all this code. So it'll probably be a while before I get ready to learn about & tackle issues for stencils - any help is appreciated :)\n\nDon't feel obligated to wait for #676 to update the docs - anything changed in the repo will get updated when I convert everything. But don't feel obligated to do it now either... Just don't feel obligated in general :P\n\nIf you like, we could merge your Android stencils so they're included in every Pencil install. Although I've wondered why the original authors decided to [distribute zips of contributed stencils](https://code.google.com/p/evoluspencil/downloads/list?q=label:Stencil) instead of just merging them into the repo. Maybe there is a good reason for it, maybe not...\n. Yeah, I figured it might be easier for stencil maintainers if they were in a different repository. I was first thinking I could simply add the submodules under the appropriate directory in the `app` folder, but that wouldn't work for collections like your Material Icons - which need to be built. Maybe I'll modify the build script to download, include(and build, if necessary) any 3rd party stencils when building the application.\n\nDo you know if it's possible for users to override a collection if the collection already exists within Pencil's code?\n. I've split those out into #677 and #678 \n. Closing, nathielw's stencil collection solves this :)\n. _From [davidiwi...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/116658443317468468448/) on July 04, 2013 21:04:26_\n\nSame problem... can't find help anywhere on the internet\n. _From [lzh...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/100610675404619429232/) on December 04, 2014 19:17:53_\n\nGot the same error and found the solution in a comment in another issue. \n\nChanged in Evolus\\Pencil\\app\\defaults\\preferences\\pencil.js the line :\n\npref(\"intl.locale.matchOS\", true);\n\nto\n\npref(\"intl.locale.matchOS\", false);\n\nthat resolves the error in the error console for me.

Although now I'm thinking maybe this wasn't necessary...\n\nIt seems like pencil-animation turned into pencil2d & started storing stuff in /opt/ instead of /usr/.\n\nDoes anyone still need this?\n. Well my now main concern is that this fork has nothing to do with Evolus, so I think it would be best to change it to pencil or pencil-prototyping or something along those lines. \n\nI did some more digging & the original pencil animation project the OP was submitting died & was forked into this: http://www.pencil2d.org/\n\nI downloaded the package for the 0.5.4 release & it looks like the executable & the folder is named `pencil2d` now, so I think it is safe to switch back to using just `pencil` for the data - unless there is another linux app with the name `pencil`(I didn't find one on Arch or Nix).\n. _From [mario.fa...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/100780531785855758638/) on October 27, 2012 07:20:38_\n\nI notice the same problem:\n- Version 2.0.2 Firefox plugin is not able to draw straight line\n- Version 1.3.4 Firefox plugin is able to draw straight line\n\nVery limiting issue since apply on all the Sketchy Stencils\n. _From [manuel.r...@googlemail.com](https://code.google.com/u/101650981603591826220/) on October 01, 2013 21:38:11_\n\nI have fixed this error.

In the original exported SVG, the problem is a <rect> object:\n\n<g inkscape:label=\"Untitled Page\" xmlns:inkscape=\" http://www.inkscape.org/namespaces/inkscape \" inkscape:groupmode=\"layer\" id=\"layer_untitled_page\"><g><rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"1624\" height=\"1624\" fill=\"none\"/>\n\nSo, please ignore the XML I pasted earlier.

Click any control within designer area (windows form, group box, text control)\n2. Press CTRL + A (select all)\n3. Right click and Go to properties\n4. You will get Multiple objects properties window\n5. Select check box colour above check box Advance mode is colour picker is disabled\n6. Select black colour and set opacity 100% (slider control is there)\n\nAll the texts will be visible\n(y)\n. Going through previous issues, it looks like this only affects the Native UI Stencil Collection & is fixed by reverting to 2.0.3. Maybe diffing HEAD against v2.0.3 will show the issue.\n. Backgrounds, shapes & labels are messed up in exports until the Page's tab is selected as well.\n. Many hours have been sunk into this - no resolution yet. \n\nI've been looking at how Pencil loads the initial document - but it might be a problem with the stencils themselves instead.\n. Poked at this some more... doesn't seem like a notable difference between the Stencil Definitions of the working Sketchy Labels & the broken Native Labels.\n\nI poked around at the Shape prototype for a little & will probably pick up my investigation there.\n\nOn the plus side, I'm learning tons about the codebase as I slowly comb through everything to figure this out...\n. @amarach78 You can grab the old source from the google code project page:\nhttps://code.google.com/p/evoluspencil/downloads/list\n\nThe fact that I didn't find anything in the diff might mean that some change in the xulrunner/firefox framework caused this issue instead of some code in this repo. Or maybe I just missed something.\n. That's great, thanks. The next step is to figure out the version of xulrunner that broke the native stencils so we can look at the release notes for that version & figure out what changed and broke the stencils.\n\nI might be able to get to that in the next few days(unless you're interested in taking it on). \n. Thanks, I'll checkout the update notes for xul 17 and try poking around again.\n. Sorry all, been trying really hard to fix this... \n\nI can't find anything about using native GUI widgets in XUL. Can't even seem to find the release notes for XRE v17 to see what changed :( I think the last resort may have to be diffing the whole codebase from v16.0.2 -> v17 and pick through to see what might've broken this...\n. @mvdw It's a XUL button, not an HTML button:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XUL/button\n\nHTML button would be marked up like `<html:button>...</html:button>`\n. I was able to get button text to load by removing the `font-size:0px;` from the surrounding `html:div` element in the stencil:\n\n``` xml\n<html:div xmlns:html=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"div\" style=\"-moz-box-sizing: border-box; overflow: hidden; position: relative; line-height: 1px !important; font-size: 0px;\" xmlns=\"http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul\">\n    <button id=\"xulControl\"\n            style=\"margin: 0px !important; min-height: 0px !important; min-width: 0px !important; -moz-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box;\" />\n    <html:div style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%;\"/>\n</html:div>\n```\n\nHowever, the loaded button's styling is different and changes when you edit it's text...\nMore digging to go...\n. _From [manuel.b...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/106089385688690789630/) on November 12, 2013 03:15:34_\n\nmaybe the log helps\n\n**Attachment:** [LOG_crash_pencil-2.06_on-open-document.txt](http://code.google.com/p/evoluspencil/issues/detail?id=603#hc1)\n. _From [manuel.b...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/106089385688690789630/) on November 12, 2013 03:26:22_\n\ni can reproduce the problem both in the standalone and firefox version, it seems to be a problem with mavericks, cause of with Pencil 2.05 we could reproduce the problem before i update Pencil to 2.06 expecting it was a problem \"fixable\" with the update.\n\nSumarizing, the problem is a crash in Pencil when the user select a folder opening or saving a document.\nWith Pencil 2.05 not always occur (i'm not sure, i update early), in mavericks always occur.\n. _From [MEL_Lang...@yahoo.co.uk](https://code.google.com/u/114240283049982532068/) on November 12, 2013 03:49:57_\n\nThanks.\n\nI did try to use the FireFox plugin and also discovered that the only way I could re-load the document I had created was to use the \u201crecent\u201d documents list.\n\nUnfortunately there is a bigger problem with the Fire Fox plugin in that after creating a wireframe design, when I attempt to reload it all I get is a single vertical line, about 3\u201d long, in the middle of the layout area where my design should be.\n\nThe only workaround that I am left with is to spin up a VM on my mac and run evoluspencil from that.\n. _From [manuel.b...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/106089385688690789630/) on November 12, 2013 07:14:38_\n\ni am updating the error i see when i try to \"save as\" an select a folder...\n\n**Attachment:** [Captura de pantalla 2013-11-12 a la(s) 16.12.02.png](http://code.google.com/p/evoluspencil/issues/detail?id=603#hc4)\n. _From [manuel.b...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/106089385688690789630/) on November 25, 2013 03:48:43_\n\nHello, i've found the problem. \nIt's not Pencil at all, as we supposed.\n\nIt's a problem with mavericks.\n\nThe point is you can't be able of open or \"save as\" or even save a file with the \"Cover Flow\" view active.\n\nIf you choose Column View, List View or Icon View, the problem disappear, and you can work as you expect with files.

I made a thread to see if I could take over the existing extension instead of re-releasing:\nhttps://forums.mozilla.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=24109\n. Hooray! I appreciate any time spent on this :)\n\nFor setting up the initial structure, see: http://sphinx-doc.org/tutorial.html\nMost of the docs will most likely be just plain RST: http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html\nAlthough additional Sphinx constructs may be useful: http://sphinx-doc.org/markup/index.html\n\nYou can ignore all the autodoc, cross-referencing & javascript domain stuff for now(although if `sphinx-quickstart` asks please switch the default domain to javascript).\n\nThanks & let me know if you run into any problems!\n. Awesome!\n\nFor links to sections, I'd recommend adding a label before the section header & linking to that using `ref`, instead of using rst links.\n\nFrom: http://sphinx-doc.org/markup/inline.html#ref-role\n\n```\nUsing ref is advised over standard reStructuredText links to sections (like\n`Section title`_) because it works across files, when section headings are\nchanged, and for all builders that support cross-references.\n```\n. Live at http://pencil-prototyping.rtfd.org\nGonna do a little cross-referencing & re-organization before closing this.\n. Welp that last commit makes it show tutorial pages in the sidebar when you build them locally - for some reason RTDs doesn't pick up the template override. I will investigate...\n. @nathanielw The online docs now have the sidebar nesting you requested: https://pencil-prototyping.readthedocs.org/en/latest/devguide/tutorial/index.html\n\nI've also reviewed & added cross-references to the Reference guide.\n\nI think that pretty much wraps up this ticket, but I haven't developed a Stencil yet so I don't know what would be super useful to include. Additional feedback welcome, otherwise I'll close this off in a couple of days.\n. At some point I'll move the less useful docs out of the readme & into sphinx(like maintainer-only info), but I'm going to go ahead & close this now.\n. If we were to use JSON I think it'd be best to have something like this:\n\n``` json\n[\n  { \"name\": \"Material Icons\",\n    \"repo\": \"http://github.com/nathanielw/Material-Icons-for-Pencil.git\",\n    \"buildCommand\": \"\",\n  },\n]\n```\n\nThat way:\n- we can use `name` to determine the folder to create in the `content/pencil/stencil/` folder(stripping spaces or replacing them with underscores)\n- the `repo` isn't tied to github\n- a `buildCommand` can be specified, or left blank to indicate no building is required\n\nWe would have to pick some cli utility to parse the JSON file for use in `build.sh` (`jq` or `jshon` come to mind - not sure which is more popular).\n\nAs an aside: I'd really love to use `YAML` instead of `JSON` for human-edited things like this, but the dearth of YAML CLI utilities makes this seem improbable.\n\nIf we go with submodules, we'd probably stick them somewhere like `build/Stencils/` & copy the folders directly(so we wouldn't need a `name`).  We could check for a `Definition.xml` file to figure out whether the collection needs to be built or not. I think the build commands would have to be hardcoded into `build.sh` - unless we asked stencil devs to have a standardized build file for us to hook up to. Updating the submodules would have to become part of the release process(`git submodule foreach git pull origin master`).\n\nSo it seems like JSON would be more maintainable & expandable, although it would add a little more knowledge overhead for comprehending the build system(knowing JSON & whatever utility we use to parse it).\n. Sorry I didn't mean to make it seem like I was against using JSON, I just wanted to list out the pros & cons, so I could think on it. I think it's an OK trade off, but I imagined it would only be knowledge required for Pencil's developers/maintainers & stencil developers. So this little bit confuses me:\n\n> users wouldn't need the overhead of knowing a new markup language really\n\nAre you saying we should let end-users install collections by adding a username & repo in a config file, similar to [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) or [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug/)?\n\nI'm thinking of something like getting stencil devs to supply a `manifest.json` with their collection that contains a bunch of metadata, including the following attributes:\n- `name`\n- `version` \n- `downloadUrl`\n- `requiresBuild`\n- `buildCommands`\n- `manifestUrl`\n\nFor including collections with Pencil, we just add the repo to a file in `build/`. The build script can clone/update all repos listed in the file & check the `manifest.json` to see if a build is required.\n- If `requiresBuild` is true & `buildCommands` doesn't exist, the script will download the pre-built zip from `downloadUrl`(into some location dependent on the `version` in order to prevent redundant downloads). If `buildCommands` exists, the script will instead run them inside the cloned folder.\n- If `requiresBuild` is false, it'll just copy the files into `Outputs/Pencil/.../stencil/${name}` where `${name}` comes from `manifest.json`.\n\nWe can also eventually expand this into something that allows users to easily install & auto-upgrade collections. Users could enter a file path or url to a `manifest.json` or the collection's `.zip`. Pencil would download & compare `manifestUrl` to see if a newer version is available & download that using the `downloadUrl` instead. Then it could be handled like regular `zip` imports. For automatic updates, Pencil could compare the manfiest at `manifestUrl` to the installed `manifest.json`, if the version differs, it would automatically download & replace the collection from `downloadUrl`.\n\nThen, way in the future, we can use the `manifest.json` to create a `Pencil Stencil Repository` or something similar, where stencil devs can upload their `manifest.json`, screenshots, the collection's `.zip`, etc to some server. We could add a window to Pencil that talks to the server and fetches the `manifest.json`s and allows the user to browse, search & install all collections listed in the repository.\n\nThis heavily rips off of how firefox does addons, here's an example of what firefox stores(in your profile's `addons.json`): https://gist.github.com/prikhi/795a025c829b45769aa7\n\nComments? Suggestions? Feedback?\n\nI'd also love to hear from @nathanielw about all this, as he's the only active stencil developer I know of :P\n. I'm fine with ditching building collections, I only imagined building collections when building Pencil - not when users update or install a collection. The only benefit I saw(which seems small) was that whenever I build/release a new version of Pencil it would include the latest versions of the bundled collections instead of the last released ones.\n.

But now that I think about it, the latter isn't as big a deal - I'm failing to come up with reasonable circumstances where someone might want to replace a built-in collection instead of just upgrading(maybe an incompatible version of FF/XR?).\n\n> it wouldn't be too difficult to build a dependency management solution\n\nBy dependency management, do you mean version management? As far as I know there aren't dependencies between stencil collections(where one collection requires that another is installed).\n\nI was thinking stencil collections could have a `version`/`last-updated`/`modified` attribute or something similar, and Pencil could ensure you only replace a collection with a collection that has a higher version number. I don't see versioning as a _necessary_ requirement for this ticket, we could just let users replace a collection with any version of that collection.\n. Sorry I misspoke as well, I meant to say this ticket was meant for _all_ collections - built-in collections, bundled collections, **and** user-created/installed collections.\n\n> If we base it on github repositories it can easily check if there is an update to the repository and grab it automatically.\n> ...\n> Then it would be as simple as running a git pull on each collection to update when the application is launching.\n\nWhile I'm not opposed to automatically updating stencil collections, I meant for this issue to be more about allowing end-users to manually replace them on their individual installation/profile instead of requiring the stencil to be uninstalled first. So it seems to me to be a bit out of scope for this issue(correct me if I'm misunderstanding), but feel free to create a new issue for it if you'd like(or I can when I have some more free time).\n. Actually you can scroll to switch pages, but if you scroll past all pages that are currently displayed, the tab bar does not scroll to follow you.\n. Beautiful, thanks :)\n\nI built it on rtfd.org, check it out: https://evolus-pencil.readthedocs.org/en/sphinx-docs/\n\nStay tuned for comments.\n. Yup, `pencil` is taken so I changed it to `pencil-prototyping`, rtd is just taking its time with it.\n\nSeems like the only other comments I have are small knitpicks that I can just edit as I go through the diff. Could you rebase all this into a single commit? You should be able to do:\n\n``` bash\ngit remote add upstream git@github.com:prikhi/pencil.git\ngit fetch upstream develop\ngit rebase -i upstream/develop\n```\n\nThen mark as commits except your first one as `squash` & edit the commit message. Lemme know if you need more info.\n. Thanks :)\n. Thanks\n. Whew, thank you both for your doc improving efforts :)\n\nI will start my pass through them soon\n. Thanks :)\n. I checked out the [release docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/37) and it doesn't look like there's any breaking changes(breaking changes aren't separated out, usually have to search the page for `breaking` or `incompatible`).\n\nSo I've bumped it & will put out a new release & upload new builds for `2.0.9`.\n\nAs for PRs, I'd like to keep `MaxVersion` on a major version that has been tested(instead of just doing `MaxVersion=*`). The bare minimum tests I do are:\n- Can I load a file?\n- Can I save, quit then load without losing data?\n- Can I export to PNG?\n\nIf you attest to testing these things, I'll take a PR that bumps `MaxVersion`.\n. Tada: https://github.com/prikhi/pencil/releases/tag/v2.0.9\n. Beautiful thanks :)\n. Merged, thanks. Do you need a new release out for this?\n\nIf this makes Pencil install-able for all Gentoo users, feel free to add the relevant info to the readme\n. Thanks - I'm at the very end of my awake cycle, so I'll put a new release out once I've gotten some sleep.\n. I put out [v2.0.10](https://github.com/prikhi/pencil/releases/tag/v2.0.10)\n. Thanks again :)\n. Can you try [v2.0.10](https://github.com/prikhi/pencil/releases/tag/v2.0.10)\n. @donniezazen Related commit fixes this, caused by `#!/bin/sh` instead of `#!/bin/bash` in the `pencil` executable.\n. This is released as v2.0.11, let me know if everything is alright.\n. Fixed by #692 \n. There should be default templates. Pencil is looking in the wrong place when installed as an extension. Fix incoming.\n. Heya, I've been away for a while so I've got a backlog of stuff in all my projects, just quickly checking in so you know you're not being ignored. I will review & merge this soon-ish.\n. How should I package the folder for downloading? Is a zip OK? Or rar, tar?\n\nI'd like to add install directions to the readme. How does one go about installing the downloaded file(maybe this is obvious for Mac users)?\n\nOtherwise, looks good thanks :)\n. I merged this but rebased it so github doesn't want to acknowledge it :/\n. > I just realised this is already addressed in #667, sorry for the duplicate.\n\nIt's OK, the majority of the 500 or so issues on here were imported from Evolus' old bug tracker, so any confirmation that those issues are still occurring is helpful.\n\nThat said, I'm closing this as a duplicate, marking #667 as confirmed & assigning it to milestone v2.1.0, please subscribe to #667 if you want updates.\n. Not sure what you mean by `painter`. Do you mean the color selection tool? If not, can you please clarify or give instructions on how to reproduce this behavior.\n\nIf you mean the color selection tool, that can be exited by pressing your `Escape` key.\n. The escape key is commonly used throughout the app to \"escape\" from things like nav menus, text boxes, dropdowns, popups, etc. \n\nI'm gonna say this isn't really worth it right now because it'd be a button just to deselect the \"Copy Shape Format\" tool. It would be useful if we add more tools where the click action is replaced.\n. There are 2 ways to do this:\n1. In the `line` section to the right of the `color` toolbar section, set the number input to `0`(this controls the border width).\n2. Right click the shape & choose `Actions -> Remove Border`.\n\nDoes this seem OK?\n. If you're on Linux, you could try removing your `~/.cache/pencil` folder. There's profiles in `~/.pencil` as well.\n. Thanks!\n. The latest release(v2.0.11) fixes this.\n. Thanks!\n. I was thinking of something simple: a short description, download links for the current version, doc & github links and a list of features with screenshots. This could all fit on a single page so I was thinking either just HTML & CSS or using some Javascript library as well.\n\nI actually already did this as a way to test out [mercury.js](https://github.com/Raynos/mercury) but I thought my design was a little off. Maybe mercury.js  is too obscure of a library as well... I'll push it to the gh-pages branch soon so you can see what it actually looks like.\n\n![pencil-web](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1304102/8018019/2077ea1e-0bd6-11e5-9f1e-19d2b7c2b649.png)\n. I pushed it to the `gh-pages` branch, let me know what you think:\nhttps://github.com/prikhi/pencil/tree/gh-pages\nhttp://prikhi.github.io/pencil/\n. I've got the majority of it rewritten in plain HTML & bootstrap, I've just been too busy w/ other work to finish it up...\n\nI was thinking a simple page would be a little more \"user-friendly\" than using the docs, although that'd keep everything in one place...\n. And yeah, I didn't think we'd use mercury - that was just me playing around & I wanted to share the design.\n\nStatic site generators seem a little overkill to me(that's essentially what I wrote w/ mercury). Maybe I'm missing something though?\n. ^ Referenced wrong issue\n. Descriptive names and small functions are great, I would accept PRs that made those kinds of changes(and pretty much anything else from Code Complete or Clean Code). \n\nBut I'm sure there are people that are way more comfortable with just commenting than actually changing any code and I'd probably accept those PRs as well(& probably just clean it up myself).\n\nPlus, any class/function comments will be parsed into API Docs:\nhttps://pencil-prototyping.readthedocs.org/en/latest/developers/api.html\n\nSo this is _ideal_(but not expected):\n\n``` javascript\n/*\"\"\"\n.. function:: size_of_last_box(size_of_box)\n    Calculate the number of eggs in the last box, assuming all\n    of the boxes have a maximum size of ``size_of_box``.\n\n   :param size_of_box: The maximum size of a box.\n   :type size_of_box: Number\n   :returns: The number of eggs in the last box.\n   :rtype: Number\n*/\nfunction size_of_last_box(size_of_box) {\n  number_of_eggs = add_numbers(b,c) \n  return get_remainder(number_of_eggs, size_of_box) \n}\n```\n. Thanks!\n. I fixed it before checking for PRs >.< \nBut thanks :)\n. Thanks. In the future it'd be nice if links were added to the bottom(but not a big deal).\n. #713 Added the gitter badge. Should I add anything else?\n. Death to trailing whitespace!\n\nThanks :)\n. Merci beaucoup!\n. Thanks\n. If you're interested you could write it using Sphinx markup:\nhttp://pencil-prototyping.readthedocs.org/en/latest/developers/index.html#writing-documentation\nlike this:\nhttps://github.com/prikhi/pencil/blob/develop/app/content/pencil/common/pencil.js#L53-L67\nand it'll show up in the api docs:\nhttp://pencil-prototyping.readthedocs.org/en/latest/developers/api.html\n\nIf not, let me know & I'll merge it.\n. So this actually brings up a good question: what should the section nesting in the docs look like?\n\nIf you check out the current Pencil namespace API: https://pencil-prototyping.readthedocs.org/en/latest/developers/api.html#pencil\n\nit kinda looks like this:\n\n```\n* Class or Namespace\n      * attributes \n  * functions\n```\n\nWith your current indention it'll look like this:\n\n```\n* Class or Namespace\n      * attributes \n  * other functions\n* Pencil.setPainterCommandChecked\n```\n\nwhere the new function is below the Namespace instead of nested within it. I think a flat structure(where we un-nest the `attributes` & `other functions` like you did) might be better since everything is nested under a section header of the class or namespace already & you won't have to worry about the proper indentation when writing docs, you can just align it with the `/*\"\"\"`\n\nComments? Otherwise I'll probably merge this & fix the others\n. Heyo, I had actually meant that I would probably migrate the other indentations to match yours - sorry for the confusion.\n. Sorry for the delay, I thought github would email me when PRs were opened...\n. Thanks :)\n. I've kept the maxVersion to a version someone's tested Pencil on because I'm kinda paranoid of a backwards incompatible change destroying saved data... Maybe that's too paranoid?\n\nDo PNG exports work in v17? I believe this change in FF36 broke them:\n\n> The nsIWebBrowserPersist.saveURI() method now requires 8 arguments, in an order incompatible with previous releases.\n\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/36\n. FF36 made us make a change that breaks the app for every previous version of FF. If you try exporting a document as a PNG with a version before FF36 it will just hang. I think all export methods might've been broken by this. I think it's a good idea to keep it at 36.\n\nI'm running FF's dev release now so I'll at least keep the maxversion at that version number(currently 41), maybe bump it up to 200 or something.\n\nWindows builds have xulrunner packaged with them already.\n\nIf openSUSE's xulrunner is that old, I'd run a `sed` command when packaging that removes `xulrunner` from the `BINARIES` array in `/bin/pencil`(assuming opensuse's packaging system allows this) & then make the package depend on Firefox instead of xulrunner. That'll make sure it uses FF to launch instead of xulrunner.\n. Thanks :)\n. I changed it because the pencil2d animation software was installing under `/usr/share/pencil` on debian. I think they now use `pencil2d` instead so it should be OK to switch it back. See #499 instead.\n. Should be fine to fix it. Need to make sure to update the Arch Linux PKGBUILD if the folder name in `-linux-pkg.tar.gz` is modified. Will this require switching to `/usr/share/pencil`?\n. Thanks for packaging this :)\n. Thanks a lot! I'm about to go out of town for 2 weeks & I might not have time to review this before then.\n. Thanks, will release a new version with a .deb soon.\n\nThe `sudo chown -R root ...` line isn't necessary is it? It causes an error for me & everything seems fine with it removed.\n.

Thanks!\n. Can you just add a line like this to your package's build step:\n\n``` bash\nsed -i 's|BINARIES=\"xulrunner |BINARIES=\"|' ./Linux/pencil\n./build.sh linux\n```\n\nLaunching w/ firefox means that when firefox crashes, pencil crashes. So I'd prefer to keep the default to xulrunner.\n. Last time I tested I wasn't able to get this working. I will retest soon - I think I forgot to clear the cache or my profile.\n. This is in the readme already, under Builds -> Windows:\n\n```\nYou'll need curl installed so you can pull the Windows XULRunner runtime and nsis to compile the installer.\n```\n\nBut I went ahead & made `nsis` a link to the site.\n. Hey, this is in the Documentation section of the readme:\n\n```\ncd docs/\nsudo pip install -r requirements.txt\nmake html\n```\n. Thanks! New version soon.\n. Thanks!\n. Bout to release a new version, will try to get this in.\n. This exists & should be supported in the github & mozilla XPI files in the next version.\n\nShould I add anything in the Readme with respect to Palemoon before closing this?\n. OK did more reading, looks like exporting won't work because of breaking changes mozilla make to FFv38. People have asked for me to support a lower version of FF/XRE before, I will investigate.\n. Exporting now works in Palemoon as of v2.0.21. You should also be able to install it from the firefox addons page: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pencil-prototyping/\n. Also issue #802 does not occur when using with Palemoon.\n. Thanks, been holding out hoping the old author would get back to me about taking over the extension already on the AMO but I'll probably cave now.\n. Awaiting validation:\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pencil-prototyping/\n\nIf mozilla truly deprecates XUL, pencil will die unless it is re-written using the WebExtensions API - provided the API can actually provide equivalent functionality of XUL...\n. Thanks for bumping this and reminding me :)\n. Reopening this because at the rate that mozilla is approving plugins, it will take a year and a half for Pencil to be reviewed & signed... We are number 144 in the queue and haven't moved since I uploaded 3 days ago...\n\nI think the solution will be to keep that in the review queue and also upload an unlisted XPI that can be distributed via the github releases page. Unlisted addons get signed immediately so that would allow installation once FF hits v44(where I believe the ability to install unsigned plugins will be removed).\n. Unlisted XPIs are uploaded to AMO, just not shown in their addons directory, and thus are immediately signed instead of having to wait for approval.\n\nBut thanks to Noitidart, the listed Pencil addon has been approved early and can be installed without disabled the signature requirements:\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pencil-prototyping/\n. Thanks :)\n. Can you try installing this package and let me know if it works OK:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/jypxqi5hzv1alq5/pencil-2.0.14-ubuntu-all-debian-fix.deb?dl=0\n. Awesome, I'll go ahead an merge it.\n\nUnfortunately, using a version lower than 36 breaks all export methods:(\n. Looks better, thanks :)\n. Thanks, are the rightmost numbers `expected/actual`?\n. Only lintian error now is our lack of a manpage.\n. Thanks for this, I'm away from my home base at the moment, but I'll try to get this in soon.\n. I've been holding off on this - been thinking we should ask the mailing list or more users about which they prefer...\n\nIf one of you would like to make a post to the pencil-users google group, go ahead - otherwise I will at some point.\n\nAlso, feedback from contributers would be appreciated:\n@nathanielw @jdittrich @mvdw @just-paja @horacimacias @joemirizio @Zyzle @ovruni\n. These are great. \n\nMaybe it's a pen because we are manipulating stencils, and pen + stencil = pencil ??\n. Thanks :)\n. @bmarkovic Are you always behind a proxy? If not, does OpenClipart not work for you all the time?\n. Moving is easy, coming up with fair decision-making, & membership processes are the hard parts.\n. Thanks for catching that @igpremuo \n. Oops, actually that only applies for debian builds. I'll move all linux builds to either `pencil` or `pencil-prototyping` before the next release...\n. #499 \n. Fixed in `develop`, new version soon.\n. Awesome, thanks for contributing :)\n. Did you have any previous versions of Pencil installed?\n\nIf so, could you try running off of my `develop` branch with the `-purgecaches` option just to make sure this wasn't caused by an older version?\n\nLike this:\n\n``` bash\n./build.sh mac\nOutputs/Mac/XUL.framework/Versions/Current/xulrunner Outputs/Mac/Pencil.app/Contents/Resources/application.ini -purgecaches\n```\n\nIf you've tried the `develop` branch with no caches already let me know and I'll merge this.\n. Tested on linux as well, works great - thanks!\n. Hi, changing the max version should be fine. It's been done on the `develop` branch already.\n\nI'm not at home and my laptop's distro(NixOS) doesn't have everything to make a new release on the `master` branch - so it'll have to wait til the 29th or so, or I'll have to write a package for `nsis`.\n. AMO will automatically reject the plugin if the MaxVersion is too high. Went ahead & tested on FF Developer so should be good til v46 now.\n. (new release on the way)\n. for now you can disable extension signing by toggling `xpinstall.signatures.required` in `about:config`\n\nfirst priority for installs will be getting the unlisted XPI signed while we wait for the listed one to be reviewed. then I'll poke around debian installs. Might be a little while, on the road so I can't spin up a ubuntu VM to play around w/ it.\n. Awesome, I've been wanting this feature.\n\nI'll be traveling home all day tomorrow, then I gotta rebuild my desktop, I'll review it when I get everything all setup again.\n. Does the other pencil application store stuff in `/usr/share/pencil`? Is the binary named `pencil`? If so those will have to change as well, I will update the debian/ubuntu build script to deal with that in a couple of days and make a new release.\n. Haven't heard of anyone working on them. You might want to ask on the mailing list as well:\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pencil-user\n\nIf you find or start this project, feel free to submit a PR adding the collection to the Readme.\n. Should be possible by just changing `architecture` in `builds/Ubuntu/control` to `any` or `all`. The initial PR had it set to `amd64` & I didn't catch it, sorry about that.\n\nGrabbing Ubuntu i386 right now so I can test it out first.\n. Maybe try removing the `~/.pencil` folder XULRunner sets up? You could also see if `firefox --app /path/to/pencil/application.ini` works.\n. You could also try `xulrunner /path/to/application.ini --purgecaches`.\n. XPI is the application as a firefox addon, EXE is the application as a native Windows program. I don't use Firefox Cloud or know how it works so I can't comment on that, but both versions should let you save to the current computer.\n\nI merged the PR by @mikedlr and added a link to Mozilla's Addon Repository as well.\n\nAlso,  there is Google Group from the old Evolus Pencil that you can use:\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pencil-user\n. Should be fixed now.\n. Interesting, thanks for the report. Were no breaking changes in FF45 according to mozilla... Will investigate.\n. I'm pretty sure it's a bug in Firefox. There's nothing relevant in the release notes for FFv45.\n\nI made a bug: https://bugzil.la/1259385\n. https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1259385#c13\n\nGonna have to go through the nightlies & figure out which one breaks Pencil.\n. I don't really have the time to figure this out, sorry guys. If you're getting this bug, I suggest moving on to http://github.com/evolus/pencil.\n\nI'll keep bumping maxVersion hoping it'll be fixed in the future but if you want to continue using v2 either use an older firefox, or use xulrunner/palemoon. I'm using this repo, mostly with xulrunner but also with palemoon.\n. Wow, this is great, thanks a lot :)\n. Thanks!\n. Accidentally left a debug flag on when building the latest versions, 2.0.18 incoming soon.\n. Can you test 2.0.18? \nhttps://github.com/prikhi/pencil/releases/tag/v2.0.18\n. Sorry, internet died in the middle of my upload & I didn't notice. Should be up there now.\n. That looks like Norton 360 Total Security, not a Windows pop-up. The files under the `xulrunner` directory are distributed by Mozilla. If you trust Mozilla, you should allow the installer to create those target files.\n\nAnother option is to install firefox then create a `.bat` file that runs `firefox.exe -app C:/path/to/pencil/folder/application.ini`.  Installing somewhere other than `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\` might also prevent this.\n. Wow, didn't even know about Pencil v3. That's great because I have nowhere near the amount of free time it would take to get Pencil from XUL to Webextensions. My last ditch \"keep Pencil alive\" plan was going to be switching to supporting [Pale Moon](https://www.palemoon.org).\n\nI did try to contact them via Twitter & Email when I forked Pencil, & never got a response. Then I got an email from them saying they were going to bring it back & incorporate some of my changes - but I never heard back from them after that.\n. Got an email about this as well. I was able to open my `.ep` files from Pencil v2 but couldn't add new stencils to my document :/\n\nI'm going to see if D\u01b0\u01a1ng is willing to put up a project roadmap along with some issues so we can have some easy ways to hook into the new development.\n\nI think the future of this repo will be patching it to work with Pale Moon(even if they re-fork they said it will still support XUL) & releasing a linux version with a bundled xulrunner(like the windows & os x versions), just to make it last for people who can't switch to v3 for whatever reason.\n. There's a link to the new project in the readme, I will be keeping this project minimally-maintained for use w/ xulrunner/palemoon.. Thanks, might take me a couple days before I can look over it & test it out.\n. Thanks!\n. Merged, thanks!\n. Thanks again :)\n. Should be fixed.\n. Bumped this to 52 in the lastest release. . See #802\n. See #802\n. See #802\n. Awesome, thanks. I added a link to the icons in this repo's README.\r\n\r\nYou may want to let Evolus know as well, if they are compatible w/ v3(I don't know of any stencil differences between v2 & v3).. I added a link to v3 in the readme. I'll keep maintaining this but probably won't do much more development. I get the \"can't drag & drop\" bug in v3, so I'm still using this with xulrunner/palemoon.\n. Fixed\n. Should be fixed. I tried to keep it to versions I've tested but haven't had time to work on pencil for a while, especially since v3 exists now. If I have trouble keeping the maxVersion up to date, I'll just bump it up to 999 or something.\n. Should be fixed. You might want to check out the http://github.com/evolus/pencil repo as well.\n. Thanks.\n. For version 3, please open an issue with Evolus' repository: http://github.com/evolus/pencil. See #802\n. Yup, 3.0 issues should be reported to https://github.com/evolus/pencil. For version 3, please open an issue with Evolus' repository: http://github.com/evolus/pencil. Yeah this is a bug in newer FF versions & neither me nor mozilla have the time to figure out whats going on. I'll keep bumping maxVersion hoping it'll be fixed in the future but either use an older firefox, or use xulrunner/palemoon.\n. Did v49 fix the drag-and-drop issue?\n. Does 2.0.21 not work?. @giancarloandroid First release of this repository was v2.0.6. You should checkout the standalone version on this repo's Releases page, or http://github.com/evolus/pencil for v3.. See #802 \r\nFor ubuntu standalone, you can try installing xulrunner\r\nLet me know if you are experiencing a different issue & I'll re-open. Either use Pale Moon, Xulrunner, an older version of Firefox, or Pencil v3.\r\nSee #802. That is Evolus' home page, not this projects. Our downloads are on this github projects \"Releases\" page. Alternatively, checkout the Pencil v3 project: http://github.com/evolus/pencil. I think this is fixed by modifying our deb to include xulrunner instead of depending on firefox. This hasn't been fixed. Don't know when I will have the time to fix it.\r\n\r\nSomeone else could start by taking a look at the `ubuntu` function in `builds/build.sh`. The fix would include xulrunner in the package and modify the `pencil` script to call that xulrunner instead of firefox/iceweasel, then remove firefox/iceweasel from the ubuntu dependencies.. Pencil v3 is released, will only be doing minimal maintenance to this repo, I'd make an issue in the v3 repo: http://github.com/evolus/pencil . See #856 #802 and http://github.com/evolus/pencil. See #856 . Wrong repo, see http://github.com/evolus/pencil for v3.. Wrong repo, see http://github.com/evolus/pencil for v3.. ",

See this pull request:\n solve bug fixed size in svg export #718 \n. Hmm, I was thinking that initially, too. But then I read at\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Introduction :\n\u00ab \"Full\" SVG 1.2 was meant to be the next major release of SVG. It was dropped for the upcoming SVG 2.0, which is under heavy development right now and follows a similar approach to CSS 3 in that it splits components in several loosely coupled specifications.\u00bb\nSo, I guess we better don't.\n\nIMHO we should export multiple pages as separate SVG files, and not combined in one file. Even using the inkscape layers is a bad solution, since they are not meant to be layers probably - the semantics differs.\n. The result of git grep Base64:\n\n```\napp/content/pencil/bindings/clipartBrowserPane.xbl:                                //img._png = Base64.encode(png, true);\napp/content/pencil/bindings/clipartBrowserPane.xbl:                                //debug(\"getMetadata - d: \" + Base64.encode(img._png, true));\napp/content/pencil/bindings/pCanvas.xbl:                            var base64 = Base64.encode(bytes, true);\napp/content/pencil/bindings/privateCollectionPane.xbl:                            var base64 = Base64.encode(bytes, true);\napp/content/pencil/common/base64.js:*  Base64 encode / decode\napp/content/pencil/common/base64.js:var Base64 = {\napp/content/pencil/common/base64.js:                    input = Base64._utf8_encode(input);\napp/content/pencil/common/base64.js:                    output = Base64._utf8_decode(output);\napp/content/pencil/stencilGenerator.js:                        var data = Base64.encode(fileData, true);\n```\n\nOnly the encode function is ever used. \nSo it should indeed be easy to replace this.\n. This solves the problem:\n\n```\ndiff --git a/app/content/pencil/stencil/SketchyGUI/Definition.xml b/app/content/pencil/stencil/SketchyGUI/Definition.xml\nindex 873fa89..b2749bc 100644\n--- a/app/content/pencil/stencil/SketchyGUI/Definition.xml\n+++ b/app/content/pencil/stencil/SketchyGUI/Definition.xml\n@@ -1551,9 +1551,7 @@ MenuItem]]></Property>\n             <path  id=\"body\" style=\"fill:white;stroke:black\"/>\n             <path  id=\"menu\" style=\"fill:white;stroke:black\"/>\n             <path  id=\"button\" style=\"fill:white;stroke:black\"/>\n-            <foreignObject x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"200\" height=\"100\" id=\"text\">\n-                <div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"></div>\n-            </foreignObject>\n+            <text id=\"text\"/>\n         </p:Content>\n     </Shape>\n```\n\n... but is this a good solution?\nI think it is an improvement NOT to use the ForeignObject construction in the SVG result, since these ForeignObject things are only supported by Firefox, and not by any other SVG tool.\n\nTo be tested: does this change break backward compatibility when saving?\nAny other problems?\n. I tested the compatibility: no problem.\nRests the question:\nIs this a good solution?\n. I have been investigating, since I can reproduce this problem.\nUsing the button from the native GUI widgets with a text: \"my button\", Pencil creates an .ep file with:\n\n```\n    <foreignObject ...>\n            <html:div ...>\n              <button style=\"...\" p:name=\"xulControl\" id=\"...\" label=\"my button\" .../>\n              ...\n            </html:div>\n    </foreignObject>\n```\n\nbut I would expect something like this:\n\n```\n    <foreignObject ...>\n            <html:div ...>\n              <button style=\"...\" p:name=\"xulControl\" id=\"...\"  ...>my button</button>\n              ...\n            </html:div>\n    </foreignObject>\n```\n\nThe HTML tag <button> does not support a label attribute according http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_button.asp.\n\nChanging the ep file to the latter, causes the text to appear on load (but editing it does not work good), which proves my point.\n\nSo, IMHO there is something wrong with the stencil, or the way it is interpreted.\n. Maybe we should disable the Native UI Stencil Collection until this problem is fixed?\n. Indeed, LibreOffice 4.3 gives an error: \n\n> The file 'testPencil.odt' is corrupt and therefore cannot be opened. LibreOffice can try to repair the file.\n\nWhen clicking the \"Yes\" button, the document opens correctly.\n\nI tried fixing the problem by adding a Configuration2 folder in the ODT template folder, but that alone does not solve the problem.\n\nHow can we see an error report from LibreOffice for the import? Nothing appears on the commandline...\n. BTW, why is the minVersion increased to 36.0? \nIn the original evolus version is was much lower...\nI have a system here with version 17.0.10 and it works perfectly with Pencil (after adapting the minVersion). So, I propose to lower the minVersion to something like 17.0.\n. I believe the version 17.0.10 was the xulrunner version.\nOn my laptop I have (openSuse 13.2 and) now updated xulrunner to the latest version: 31.8.0.\n\nThat means, that when I install the latest Pencil 2.0.12, I get the error:\nPlatform version 31.8.0 is not compatible with:\nminVersion >= 36.0\nmaxVersion <= 39.*\n\nThe simplest solution IMHO would be to lower the minVersion (to 31 or 17, at your wish).\n. Hmm, on second thought: There are multiple problems here:\n- if xulrunner is installed, then the max/minVersions apply to the xulrunner versions, if xulrunner is not installed, then the versions apply to firefox.\n- the moment that firefox chooses to update my system to firefox 40, my pencil install will cease to start at all. Then I have to wait until the package creator updates the pencil package, and then I have to install that. This is an impossible situation - we can not do this to our users. \n- if firefox 36 was the only version that broke Pencil, then we should have only that version be excluded. Maybe just show a warning to the user - but I would not advise to attempt that - to complicated.\n- I am working on updating the openSuse package from 2.05 to 2.012. It already works, but this version problem makes Pencil unusable when also xulrunner is installed. That is unacceptable.\n\nConclusion: quick and dirty fix please: reduce the minVersion. Ofcourse, I can include a patch in the rpm build...\n. I have been reading the XUL Application Packaging instructions at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/XUL_Application_Packaging. It says: \n\n```\nThe [Gecko] section\nThe Gecko section specifies what version of XULRunner is required by the application.\nMinVersion\n    Specifies the minimum XULRunner version needed by this application. If there are binary components, MinVersion must equal the version of the libxul SDK which is used to build the application.\n    REQUIRED\n    Example: MinVersion=1.8\nMaxVersion\n    Specify the maximum XULRunner version needed by this application.\n    OPTIONAL - default value is any XULRunner less than XULRunner 2\n    Example: MaxVersion=1.8.0.* \n```\n\nMy conclusion: This system is broken.\nApparently, when running an application, the given values are compared to the firefox or xulrunner versions, NOT the Gecko version.\n\nThe following link is a book:\nhttps://books.google.be/books?isbn=1304608700\nThis book advises on page 11 to set the max version on 200.*, or package the right xulrunner with the app.\nI advise to do the former for Linux, and the latter for Windows.\n. I did use the sed command as described above. There is no problem any more on OpenSUSE.\nThis request may be closed now.\n. For now, you can use the xslt at pencil/app/content/pencil/exporter/Pencil2SVG.xslt to convert the *.ep file to a *.svg file.\nI do this on Linux with xsltproc.\nHowever, this only works well if the .ep file contains only one page - since all pages are mixed in one SVG file.\n. I need to add more file changes - sorry I made a mess of this ... hang on.\n. OK - now it is complete.\nI have to learn to use git better...\n. ok. Done.\nClose.\n. To clarify my point:\nBefore the change:\n![arrow-patch-before1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/326279/10477042/67cd8106-7253-11e5-91b4-63846a093703.png)\nAfter the change:\n![arrow-patch-after](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/326279/10477049/6bda067a-7253-11e5-9a8a-9b659d5b7ed8.png)\n\nThere is already an other issue  (#177) for adding more different arrow types, and a choice between them, but that is a far more complicated matter.\n. If you look at the code of the table under\nhttps://github.com/prikhi/pencil/blob/develop/app/content/pencil/stencil/SketchyGUI/Definition.xml\nand then everything under\n`<Shape id=\"table\" displayName=\"Table\" icon=\"Icons/table.png\">`\nup to the next\n`</Shape>`\nthen you will indeed see this limit: \nThere is a Property name=\"h0\" to \"h11\" defined.\n\nIMHO, increasing this to a few more properties should be simple.\nHow many do we need?\n. I agree with dropping the shadows and light.\nSwitching to a pencil instead of a pen is a good idea, but showing the full length of a pencil is an over-used icon.\nCan we stick to showing just the head of the pencil, pointing up like the old logo - so that it still resembles the old logo?\n\n(Search on Google images for \"pencil head close up\" to get an idea.)\n. @nathanielw: Great! That is what I had in mind. I like this one very much, but the geometry is not yet correct: the blank wood part should be a cone (round), not a pyramid. And no shadow please.\n\nIMHO it is enough to just show the pencil or pen as a tool, while not trying to express the action of writing or drawing. Hence, the tip of the pen should not be pointing down on paper, and may point up - which is the way you inspect a pen/pencil.\n. I think the OpenClipart issue is fixed. See #189 and #265.\n.

The result of git grep Base64:\n\n```\napp/content/pencil/bindings/clipartBrowserPane.xbl:                                //img._png = Base64.encode(png, true);\napp/content/pencil/bindings/clipartBrowserPane.xbl:                                //debug(\"getMetadata - d: \" + Base64.encode(img._png, true));\napp/content/pencil/bindings/pCanvas.xbl:                            var base64 = Base64.encode(bytes, true);\napp/content/pencil/bindings/privateCollectionPane.xbl:                            var base64 = Base64.encode(bytes, true);\napp/content/pencil/common/base64.js:*  Base64 encode / decode\napp/content/pencil/common/base64.js:var Base64 = {\napp/content/pencil/common/base64.js:                    input = Base64._utf8_encode(input);\napp/content/pencil/common/base64.js:                    output = Base64._utf8_decode(output);\napp/content/pencil/stencilGenerator.js:                        var data = Base64.encode(fileData, true);\n```\n\nOnly the encode function is ever used. \nSo it should indeed be easy to replace this.\n. This solves the problem:\n\n```\ndiff --git a/app/content/pencil/stencil/SketchyGUI/Definition.xml b/app/content/pencil/stencil/SketchyGUI/Definition.xml\nindex 873fa89..b2749bc 100644\n--- a/app/content/pencil/stencil/SketchyGUI/Definition.xml\n+++ b/app/content/pencil/stencil/SketchyGUI/Definition.xml\n@@ -1551,9 +1551,7 @@ MenuItem]]></Property>\n             <path  id=\"body\" style=\"fill:white;stroke:black\"/>\n             <path  id=\"menu\" style=\"fill:white;stroke:black\"/>\n             <path  id=\"button\" style=\"fill:white;stroke:black\"/>\n-            <foreignObject x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"200\" height=\"100\" id=\"text\">\n-                <div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"></div>\n-            </foreignObject>\n+            <text id=\"text\"/>\n         </p:Content>\n     </Shape>\n```\n\n... but is this a good solution?\nI think it is an improvement NOT to use the ForeignObject construction in the SVG result, since these ForeignObject things are only supported by Firefox, and not by any other SVG tool.\n\nTo be tested: does this change break backward compatibility when saving?\nAny other problems?\n. I tested the compatibility: no problem.\nRests the question:\nIs this a good solution?\n. I have been investigating, since I can reproduce this problem.\nUsing the button from the native GUI widgets with a text: \"my button\", Pencil creates an .ep file with:\n\n```\n    <foreignObject ...>\n            <html:div ...>\n              <button style=\"...\" p:name=\"xulControl\" id=\"...\" label=\"my button\" .../>\n              ...\n            </html:div>\n    </foreignObject>\n```\n\nbut I would expect something like this:\n\n```\n    <foreignObject ...>\n            <html:div ...>\n              <button style=\"...\" p:name=\"xulControl\" id=\"...\"  ...>my button</button>\n              ...\n            </html:div>\n    </foreignObject>\n```\n\nThe HTML tag <button> does not support a label attribute according http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_button.asp.\n\nChanging the ep file to the latter, causes the text to appear on load (but editing it does not work good), which proves my point.\n\nSo, IMHO there is something wrong with the stencil, or the way it is interpreted.\n. Maybe we should disable the Native UI Stencil Collection until this problem is fixed?\n. Indeed, LibreOffice 4.3 gives an error: \n\n> The file 'testPencil.odt' is corrupt and therefore cannot be opened. LibreOffice can try to repair the file.\n\nWhen clicking the \"Yes\" button, the document opens correctly.\n\nI tried fixing the problem by adding a Configuration2 folder in the ODT template folder, but that alone does not solve the problem.\n\nHow can we see an error report from LibreOffice for the import? Nothing appears on the commandline...\n. BTW, why is the minVersion increased to 36.0? \nIn the original evolus version is was much lower...\nI have a system here with version 17.0.10 and it works perfectly with Pencil (after adapting the minVersion). So, I propose to lower the minVersion to something like 17.0.\n. I believe the version 17.0.10 was the xulrunner version.\nOn my laptop I have (openSuse 13.2 and) now updated xulrunner to the latest version: 31.8.0.\n\nThat means, that when I install the latest Pencil 2.0.12, I get the error:\nPlatform version 31.8.0 is not compatible with:\nminVersion >= 36.0\nmaxVersion <= 39.*\n\nThe simplest solution IMHO would be to lower the minVersion (to 31 or 17, at your wish).\n. Hmm, on second thought: There are multiple problems here:\n- if xulrunner is installed, then the max/minVersions apply to the xulrunner versions, if xulrunner is not installed, then the versions apply to firefox.\n- the moment that firefox chooses to update my system to firefox 40, my pencil install will cease to start at all. Then I have to wait until the package creator updates the pencil package, and then I have to install that. This is an impossible situation - we can not do this to our users. \n- if firefox 36 was the only version that broke Pencil, then we should have only that version be excluded. Maybe just show a warning to the user - but I would not advise to attempt that - to complicated.\n- I am working on updating the openSuse package from 2.05 to 2.012. It already works, but this version problem makes Pencil unusable when also xulrunner is installed. That is unacceptable.\n\nConclusion: quick and dirty fix please: reduce the minVersion. Ofcourse, I can include a patch in the rpm build...\n. I have been reading the XUL Application Packaging instructions at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/XUL_Application_Packaging. It says: \n\n```\nThe [Gecko] section\nThe Gecko section specifies what version of XULRunner is required by the application.\nMinVersion\n    Specifies the minimum XULRunner version needed by this application. If there are binary components, MinVersion must equal the version of the libxul SDK which is used to build the application.\n    REQUIRED\n    Example: MinVersion=1.8\nMaxVersion\n    Specify the maximum XULRunner version needed by this application.\n    OPTIONAL - default value is any XULRunner less than XULRunner 2\n    Example: MaxVersion=1.8.0.* \n```\n\nMy conclusion: This system is broken.\nApparently, when running an application, the given values are compared to the firefox or xulrunner versions, NOT the Gecko version.\n\nThe following link is a book:\nhttps://books.google.be/books?isbn=1304608700\nThis book advises on page 11 to set the max version on 200.*, or package the right xulrunner with the app.\nI advise to do the former for Linux, and the latter for Windows.\n. I did use the sed command as described above. There is no problem any more on OpenSUSE.\nThis request may be closed now.\n. For now, you can use the xslt at pencil/app/content/pencil/exporter/Pencil2SVG.xslt to convert the *.ep file to a *.svg file.\nI do this on Linux with xsltproc.\nHowever, this only works well if the .ep file contains only one page - since all pages are mixed in one SVG file.\n. I need to add more file changes - sorry I made a mess of this ... hang on.\n. OK - now it is complete.\nI have to learn to use git better...\n. ok. Done.\nClose.\n. To clarify my point:\nBefore the change:\n![arrow-patch-before1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/326279/10477042/67cd8106-7253-11e5-91b4-63846a093703.png)\nAfter the change:\n![arrow-patch-after](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/326279/10477049/6bda067a-7253-11e5-9a8a-9b659d5b7ed8.png)\n\nThere is already an other issue  (#177) for adding more different arrow types, and a choice between them, but that is a far more complicated matter.\n. If you look at the code of the table under\nhttps://github.com/prikhi/pencil/blob/develop/app/content/pencil/stencil/SketchyGUI/Definition.xml\nand then everything under\n`<Shape id=\"table\" displayName=\"Table\" icon=\"Icons/table.png\">`\nup to the next\n`</Shape>`\nthen you will indeed see this limit: \nThere is a Property name=\"h0\" to \"h11\" defined.\n\nIMHO, increasing this to a few more properties should be simple.\nHow many do we need?\n. I agree with dropping the shadows and light.\nSwitching to a pencil instead of a pen is a good idea, but showing the full length of a pencil is an over-used icon.\nCan we stick to showing just the head of the pencil, pointing up like the old logo - so that it still resembles the old logo?\n\n(Search on Google images for \"pencil head close up\" to get an idea.)\n. @nathanielw: Great! That is what I had in mind. I like this one very much, but the geometry is not yet correct: the blank wood part should be a cone (round), not a pyramid. And no shadow please.\n\nIMHO it is enough to just show the pencil or pen as a tool, while not trying to express the action of writing or drawing. Hence, the tip of the pen should not be pointing down on paper, and may point up - which is the way you inspect a pen/pencil.\n. I think the OpenClipart issue is fixed. See #189 and #265.\n. The web page at http://pencil.evolus.vn/Features.html contains the following message:\nCopyright \u00a9 2008-2012 Evolus. All rights reserved.\nSo, I do not think we are allowed to copy this, isn't it?\n. The correct name is not evoluspencil...\nEvolus is the company that abandoned this project.\nThe name \"pencil-prototyping\" was chosen for the firefox plugin, so I guess that is applicable here too.\n. I presume this issue is a duplicate of #742.\n. ",

I know it's supposed to be a hi-res icon, but scaling it down works for me to see if I made all the important stuff big enough. \n\nThe blue background does not really make sense to me, because even with pen, you usually write to white paper.\n\nPen is for writing, pencil is for sketching.\n\nPerhaps leaving the old icon might be a good idea after all.\n\nThis is just an idea, my intention is to provoke and inspire somebody that could make something more decent.\n![pencil-drawing](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1508022/13775669/29b75a92-eaa6-11e5-951a-6d24320670a7.png)\n. @mvdw, thanks for feedback.\n@BafS, very nice, but I think the blue is not best choice. For example, if you look closely, you can see a lightning rod being hit by lightning in the first pen :) The line behind the pen gives me even bigger impression that this is going to be a tool for writing more than UI prototyping\n@nathanielw, I really like your super quick attempt. Makes me wonder how a usual quick attempt would look like :)\n. ",

Just installed it in parallel to 2.0.3 an 2.0.18 on my VM and there were quirks when opening a page with native elements (similar to #638), but after touching each element (F2 + ENTER) everything looked fine again.\nAfter that PNG export of a test page went fine on 2.0.5.\n. The issue exists in 2.0.8. So something between 2.0.5 and 2.0.8 causes the problem.\n. ",
