    "nicklockwood": "Any particular reason? (other than avoiding noise in the change logs)\n. OK, I'll make a mental note to remove them for the next update. Glad you like iRate!\n. Yes, it's designed to clear out all the settings if it detects that the version number has changed.\n. Hi dlinsin,\n\nI actually made a conscious decision not to include NSLocalizedString() within the library itself, the reason being that if I ever changed the default text strings in a future version, your localised string names would be wrong.\n\nThe recommended approach is to use the setters for the strings from within your app, and localise those, so for example, in your config you could say:\n\n```\n- (void)initialize\n{\n    [iRate sharedInstance].messageTitle = NSLocalizedString(@\"Rate MyApp\", @\"iRate title\");\n    [iRate sharedInstance].message = NSLocalizedString(@\"If you enjoy using MyApp, please rate it\", @\"iRate message\");\n    [iRate sharedInstance].cancelButtonLabel = NSLocalizedString(@\"No, Thanks\", @\"iRate cancel button\");\n    ... etc\n}\n```\n\nThis is slightly more work, but more flexible.\n. Hi Rutger,\n\nTo localize the strings in iRate, first set the message strings in your application initialize method, like this:\n\n<code>\n- (void)initialize\n  {\n      [iRate sharedInstance].appStoreID = 355313284;\n  [iRate sharedInstance].messageTitle = NSLocalizedString(@\"Rate MyApp\", @\"iRate message title\");\n      [iRate sharedInstance].message = NSLocalizedString(@\"If you like MyApp, please take the time, etc\", @\"iRate message\");\n      [iRate sharedInstance].cancelButtonLabel = NSLocalizedString(@\"No, Thanks\", @\"iRate decline button\");\n      [iRate sharedInstance].remindButtonLabel = NSLocalizedString(@\"Remind Me Later\", @\"iRate remind button\");\n      [iRate sharedInstance].rateButtonLabel = NSLocalizedString(@\"Rate It Now\", @\"iRate accept button\");\n  }\n  </code>\n\nYou can now use the standard Apple localization mechanism, which is to run the genstrings command line tool to extract the localizable strings above into a separate .strings file, which you can then translate into the different supported languages.\n\nDoes that answer you question?\n. Apparently the CFBundleDisplayName isn't always defined and doesn't always work, and oddly there's no constant for it, which seems a bit odd.\n\nAny idea where I can find a definitive Apple document stating which I should use under which circumstances?\n. I guess using BundleDisplayName and then falling back to BundleName if it's nil should be safe enough. I'll look at incorporating that in the next build.\n. Fixed in version 1.2.3\n. The problem I have with this approach is that in principle any method that does UI work could crash if called from the background thread. There are several other methods in the library that would crash if you called them from the background, so I'm not sure why this one should be singled out.\n\nI think it's generally good practice to assume that no method is thread safe unless it specifies otherwise. Nothing in the iRate documentation says that it's a good idea to call promptForRating from the background.\n\nIf you need to call it from a background thread, just use performSelectorOnMainThread from your own code.\n. That's actually already possible. Check the advanced example for details, but basically set enabled to NO in initialize and then call the following when you're ready to prompt the user.\n\n```\nif ([[iRate sharedInstance] shouldPromptForRating])\n{\n    [[iRate sharedInstance] promptIfNetworkAvailable];\n}\n```\n. I'm not seeing this warning, I think you must have some non-standard project settings.\n. Yes, you are correct of course. Seems to just be wrong in the header file though.\n. Fixed.\n. That's a good idea. In the meantime you can achieve this by using the existing delegate methods to intercept the rating alert and substitute your own. It's simple enough to create the alert (it's just a UIAlertView) and you can then insert your own logging. You can replicate the effect of the standard alert's buttons by calling the equivalent methods yourself (look under the \"advanced methods\" section in the documentation.\n\nNick\n\nOn 1 Dec 2011, at 10:06, Duane Fields wrote:\n\n> Thanks, great tool.

I've added three new delegate methods that fire when the user selects an option in the rating prompt. Let me know if that's sufficient for your requirements.\n. Hi Mic,\n\nIt shouldn't impact it, but maybe a better idea would be to use the significant event count feature instead. You could log a significant event each time the app launches, and use that to trigger the rating dialog instead.\n\nAs I said, it shouldn't be a problem to disable the notification, but you're better off not modifying the library unless you have to because that way you won't have to re-apply your change every time I do a new release.\n\nNick\n\n(Sent from my iPhone)\n\nOn 14 Dec 2011, at 10:51, Mic Pringle reply@reply.github.com wrote:\n\n> Hey Nick,\n> \n> Would it cause iRate any issues if I remove the support for the above notification ?\n> \n> My iOS app is a music player which will naturally spend most of its time running in the background, only being brought to the foreground by the user when they wish to change the track or album etc. Therefore I don't think that using this notification to increment the use count really suits this scenario, and as such I would only like this to happen on app launch.\n> \n> As far as I can I only need to remove the observer and the subsequent selector but before I do this I just wanted to make sure nothing else, that Iv'e missed, relies on this particular notification.\n> \n> Mic\n> \n> ---\n> \n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\n> https://github.com/nicklockwood/iRate/issues/10\n. Hi Mic,\n\nHere's how I see it:\n\nMy aim with the library is to make it as useful as possible to a wide audience, but avoid adding features that only apply to one user, or where it will improve the library for a few users at the cost of the majority.\n\nYour aim should be to use the main fork if possible, or persuade me to make changes to the library to support your needs if it doesn't already do so, and only as a last resort should you fork it because even with github's excellent merging, that's still making more work for yourself, risking introducing bugs, and losing the benefits of me supporting issues you have in future.\n\nIt doesn't sound like your problem is particularly unique, but the solution of disabling the foreground event is obviously not something I could ever merge into the trunk. A better solution might be to do as you suggest and add a flag to ignore foreground events, which could then be a feature I could merge back in, but before doing that, let's just analyse your problem at bit more:\n\nThere are three way to trigger a prompt at the moment: 1) number of launches/foreground events, 2) number of days, 3) number of user-defined events.\n\nCriteria 1 and 2 must both be met to trigger a prompt. Criterion 3 is independent (it will trigger a prompt even if 1 and 2 have not been met).\n\nThe aim of these options is to defer the prompt until the user has used your app for a long enough time to have developed an informed an opinion about it (preferably a positive one). For a typical app like a game, this period is about 10 days assuming they use it at least once a day, which is why the uses and days both default to 10.\n\nThe reason why I treat foreground events as a use is because app launches are a very poor metric for interaction on modern iPhones because an app may stay running for days at a time but be opened and closed multiple times during that period. This is equally true for your app - cold launches tell you nothing about how much users are interacting with your app.\n\nOn the other hand, foreground events are quite a good metric for how much people are using your app. A user who installs the app, runs it a few times but then never really interacts with it won't generate any foreground events. A user who does use it properly will presumably frequently change tracks and so generate a lot of foreground events - more than most users of most apps.\n\nSo it seems to me that the best option is to do exactly what you said in option 2; Leave the days parameter at the default of 10, and set the uses parameter to something much higher than normal, say 100. That way users will only be prompted if they have had the app installed for at least 10 days and have used it a reasonable amount during that time.\n\nAlternatively you could ignore the days and uses completely (by setting them both to a very high number) and log an event whenever the user plays a track, or whatever other metric makes sense for your app, and then prompt the user after they've played 100 tracks (or whatever).\n\nNick\n. Yes, exactly.\n\nNote however that this must be called on the main thread.\n. The logic above is to check if the shouldPromptForRating function should return _NO_, in other words:\n\n\"if too few uses _AND_ too few events then _DO NOT_ prompt\"\n\nThis is consistent with the documentation, because the implication here is that if either the uses or the events thresholds are met then then above condition will fail and it _will_ prompt.\n. Yes, so (using your example) the documentation says that the prompt will show if 3 < 3 _or_ 3 < 16, and that's what's happening. What you are now saying is that you only want it to show if 3 < 3 _and_ 3 < 16, contrary to the documentation.\n\nArguably I guess that may be more useful, so I might consider changing this behaviour, but it's technically correct as documented.\n\nTo override the prompt logic, without modifying the library (which is a bad idea for future compatibility), you can implement the iRateDelegate and supply your own logic in the iRate:shouldPromptForRating: delegate method.\n. I looked into changing the way it works, but it would be too likely to introduce bugs in existing projects due to the defaults. Since both useCount and eventCount default to 10, and both are optional, if I made them mandatory, users would have to remember to set eventCount to zero if they weren't using it, otherwise the rating would never appear. I think it's best just to leave it as it is.\n. Good catch. I'll fix it.\n. Fixed.\n. iRate 1.4 now has English, French, German, Spanish, Italian and Japanese. I did it in a different way using bundles, which is a bit more complex but simpler to integrate into projects.\n. You don't have to use ARC, but you do need to be using Apple LLVM compiler 3 or higher, otherwise it won't compile.\n. Try doing a clean from the Product menu. If that doesn't work, send your project to support at charcoaldesign dot co dot uk and I'll figure out what's going on.\n. I normally just set the remind button to nil for landscape-only games.\n\nYou can implement the above logic using the iRateDelegate to implement your own dialog. That involves duplicating quite a lot of logic though.\n\nI'll have a think about how easy it would be to implement something like this as part of the core library.\n. Thanks for the suggestion.\n\nI've modified the code so that it doesn't rely on hard-coded sizes, and added some logic to handle rotation so that it will be reapplied if the phone is rotated from portrait to landscape.\n\nI've included this in version 1.4.1.\n. Thanks!\n. I don't really understand the purpose of either of these changes. Neither of these lines generate warnings in the example project.\n. Yeah, that's intentional, and is covered in the documentation.\n\nXcode normally converts .strings files to binary plists at build time, but for some reason it didn't seem to work when I used strings files in a standalone bundle, so I pre-converted them\n\nYou can edit the files by right-clicking in Xcode and selecting open as property list.\n. Good point, and this does need a fix of some kind. I might think a little more though about the name for the setting though before I merge this (once I add something to the public API, it's hard to change).\n. Okay, I can't think of anything better - I'll merge it!\n. Are you sure?\n\nBy default, if debug is disabled iRate will only prompt if the following are all true:\n\n1) The version of the app you are running matches the latest version on iTunes\n2) 10 days have passed since the current version was installed\n3) The app has been opened 10 times or more since it was installed\n\nThose are quite hard criteria to recreate during testing, but if you set your configuration to:\n\n```\n[iRate sharedInstance].onlyPromptIfLatestVersion = NO;\n[iRate sharedInstance].daysUntilPrompt = 0;\n[iRate sharedInstance].usesUntilPrompt = 0;\n```\n\nThen you should see the alert. if you don't, maybe your bundle ID is wrong, or there's some other issue?\n\nIf you are trying to test with a brand new, never released before app then don't worry as iRate only works with apps that are on the store already. You can try setting the appStoreID or applicationBundleID to an app you know is on the store if you'd like to double check.\n. Can you tell me your app's bundle ID and paste the code you are usingo to configure iRate, and I'll try to reproduce this at my end.\n. Okay, I understand the issue. I use the device locale for the app store country by default because the vast majority of users use the app in the same country they bought it, and there's no way to find out the actual app store country programmatically.\n\nYour app is not available to buy in Australia, so it's reasonable to assume that the number of users with your app in Australia is essentially zero (other than yourself, obviously, but you're the developer).\n\nI don't really see this as a problem because when the app is released it won't cause a significant number of missed ratings, however if it bothers you, you can set the following code:\n\n[iRate sharedInstance].appStoreCountry = @\"PK\";\n\nWhich will force the app to always check the Pakistan app store.\n\nNick\n. The English, Italian, French, Spanish, Chinese, Turkish and (now) German have been checked or contributed by humans. Not sure about the others.\n. When you say the alert looks \"off\" if the text is too long, can you clarify? For example, are you referring to the German text? And do you mean in portrait or landscape? Which OS version did you test on? Can you provide a link to a screenshot of the problem?\n. French, Italian and Spanish have all been verified by native speakers. Chinese and Turkish were donated by github users, so I don't know if they are accurate but I'm assuming they are. The rest are machine translations.\n\nI don't have the list of names to hand although you can deduce them by studying the pull history for the project if you wish. I fail to see what difference the names would make. I'm not pretending they are human-translated when they are machine translations - why would I? \n\nIf you are unhappy with that, you are free to source your own replacement translations from a professional translation service (I recommend icanlocalize.com), or use the ones from Appirater instead. If you would like to contribute better translations back to the project then they would be gratefully received.\n\nI am however curious about the layout issue you reported. If you can give me reproduction steps, I will fix it.\n. I'm not seeing what you're seeing. Here's a screenshot from iOS 5.1:\n\nhttp://charcoaldesign.co.uk/images/screenshots.irate.2.png\n\nCan you send me a shot of what you are seeing?\n. Update to the latest iRate version and see if you're still seeing the issue. Was your screenshot taken on the simulator or the device?\n. I believe I fixed it. Unfortunately I had to use some \"magic numbers\" for the layout because I couldn't identify the logic that iOS uses to position the labels, so you may find it doesn't work for every possible text combination.\n. I just got the German text professionally retranslated. The text they've produced is:\n\nWenn Sie %@ m\u00f6gen, w\u00fcrden Sie es bitte bewerten? Dies wird nicht l\u00e4nger als eine Minute dauern. Danke f\u00fcr Ihre Unterst\u00fctzung!\n\nDo you have any opinion about this? How does it compare to the text you provided? It seems shorter, so I'll probably use it unless you say it's bad.\n. Please do.\n. Thanks, will do. Wish you'd mentioned it a couple of hours earlier - I just had Polish professionally retranslated! I'll use your version though.\n. It turns out that I was setting the lastReminded property _after_ calling the delegate method, so your setting it to nil had no effect. I've fixed this bug, however in this particular case it probably makes more sense just to set the reminder period to zero.\n\nYou bug is fixed in version 1.4.7, and I've also added an \"Events Demo\" example, which shows how best to implement this behaviour.\n. NSInteger has a maximum value of 2147483647, which is a pretty big number. If your app generated an event every second it would take 68 years to reach that number.\n\nIn the unlikely event it did get to that point, it wouldn't crash, it would just wrap around to -2147483648 and keep counting, so in another 68 years it might pop up the rating dialog again.\n\nSo in conclusion, it's probably not worth worrying about ;-)\n. I just checked and I'm actually using NSUInteger for the event count, so the maximum value is actually 4294967295 and it would take 136 years to wrap around. Apart from that, everything else I said still stands.\n. It's probably a good idea in retrospect, but it's not backward compatible with apps that are already using iRate, so I can't really add it or I'd annoy a lot of users\n. Sorry ;-)\n. Darn. Probably the best bet is to use a more generic app store URL on iOS 6 for now and just open the app page until someone figures out the new direct path.\n. Yeah, the app store in iOS6 seems to be a completely new app. The old one was a web-app and this one appears to be native code, and quite buggy as you point out. I'm seeing all the prices in $ in the UK for example.\n\nHopefully there will still be a URL-based deep-linking mechanism in the final release, but we'll have to wait and see what happens over the course of the beta development.\n. I see they've fixed the currency issue in beta 2. Deep links are still broken though.\n. No fix yet. There's a few months left for Apple to decide to support the old URL scheme, but ultimately if we get to GM and there's still no deep linking to the ratings page in iOS6, I'll just have to make it point at the app page instead.\n. I've fixed this in version 1.5. It may require another update if I do find a way to link directly to the ratings page on iOS6, or if they restore this feature before it's released, but at least for now it will take users to the correct page instead of an error.\n\nI've used itms-apps://ax.itunes.apple.com/app/id123456789 because it launches the app store directly instead of first opening Safari.\n. Great news! I'll restore the original links.\n\nI think we were right to be cautious though. I would have hated to get 1000 support requests today from people whose apps had stopped working ;-)\n. Yes, Apple decided to change the link sometime in the last few days (independently of the iOS6 release).\n\nI released an update to iRate yesterday that fixes them again.\n. It might be worth me giving a clearer error message in this situation - a more specific error like \"Bundle ID not found on app store\" would probably cause less confusion.\n. I've seen the same issue with apps containing some of my other libraries on iOS 4.x. I believe that Apple has changed something in Xcode 4.4 that is breaking ARC code that previously worked.\n\nI don't have a Snow Leopard machine to test on any more. Can you do a couple of experiments for me?\n\n1) Try building your app with Xcode 4.3.3 or earlier, and see if it works correctly on 10.6.8\n\n2) Try building the app using progressively earlier versions of iRate until you find one that works. You can get all the previous releases of iRate from the tags page.\n\nHopefully from the results of those tests I'll be able to work out what's causing the issue and fix it.\n. I've fixed the problem for iOS 4.3, which I'm assuming will also fix it for Mac OS 10.6 as they both use ARCLite.\n\nThe issue was that the + (void)load method was apparently firing before the ARCLite library had fully loaded.\n\nI've deferred the class setup until the main runloop has started, and that seems to have solved the problem. The fix is included in iRate version 1.5.1.\n. I'm sorry you lost many hours to debugging this, but I'm not sure what I could have done beyond fixing the issue when I found it, which I did, a week ago.\n. @pilot34 Sorry for the snappy answer. I do appreciate bug reports, and I do try to fix issues when they arise. If you check the release notes you will see that this issue was fixed a while ago, but I appreciate it's easy to miss that. For what it's worth, this bug was introduced by Apple in Xcode 4.4 and did not happen under Xcode 4.3, so I fixed it as soon as I could have - it wasn't a case of the previous release of the library not working with ARC under iOS 4 and me simply not bothering to test it or mention it in the docs. Unfortunately I have no way to notify users of bugs or updates.\n\n@Tibbs Thanks for the support, I appreciate it.\n. The issue is that the +(void)load method fires before the main thread has started, and whilst this wasn't a problem previously, as of Xcode 4.4 it seems that ARCLite (the library that implements ARC support on iOS4) isn't properly initialised until then. performSelectorOnMainThread delays the code from executing until the main thread has started, by which point ARC is working properly.\n. I see that you've closed the issue - did you figure out what the problem was?\n. Yes, that's correct. It will work once the app is live, but not prior to submission.\n\nIf you set [iRate sharedInstance].debug = YES; then you can test what the behaviour will be once live (remember to remove that again before you submit).\n. It's an interesting idea, but the only purpose I can think of would be for me to test that the library works correctly (which I can do by running it using a live app ID, as I do in the example projects). I don't see that an end user would get much benefit from it versus the existing debug mode option.\n\nThe valueForKey:inJSON method is purely to support iOS 4. I will eventually replace it with NSJSONSerialisation when I drop support for iOS 4, but there's no reason to do that now. I'm aware that it's a horrible hack, but I don't want to force people to use an arbitrary JSON library, and supporting all known JSON libraries (like AFNetworking does) requires a lot more, much nastier code.\n\nIf you do want to add a simulation mode for some reason, why not just use sample JSON data for simulation instead of a dictionary? Seems like it would make life easier.\n. Option one is a good idea, I'll look at adding it.\n\nOption two is already implemented. Just set promptAtLaunch to NO.\n. I understand that you'd like iRate to save this preference automatically (so if you set the disabled option, it would remain disabled even after you relaunch the app, until you set it to false again). I'll think about it, but my first instinct is that this is outside the scope of iRate itself.\n\nThis is very easy to implement yourself however. The simplest way is probably to add something like this to your AppDelegate:\n\n```\n- (BOOL)iRateShouldPromptForRating\n{\n    return [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] boolForKey:@\"RatingPromptEnabled\"];\n}\n```\n. I've added the option to stop prompting the user after they've rated the app, even if a new version is installed.\n. What is the benefit of this as opposed to putting either of the following in the AppDegelate:\n\n```\n+(void)initialize\n{\n    [iRate sharedInstance].promptAtLaunch = IRATE_AUTOLOAD_ENABLED;\n}\n```\n\nOr\n\n```\n- (BOOL)iRateShouldPromptForRating\n{\n    return IRATE_AUTOLOAD_ENABLED;\n}\n```\n\n?\n. Thanks. Now fixed.\n. OK, I figured out which bits I needed and I've included them in version 1.5.4. Thanks.\n. Nice idea. I'll include it in the next release. Thanks.\n. I've renamed the property to something a little clearer, but this feature is now included in version 1.5.4\n. Yep, well spotted.\n\nIt only happens if your deployment target is set to iOS6. It's harmless, but I'll fix it in the next release anyway.\n. This is now fixed in version 1.6\n. Yes, that should work. It should be sufficient to set [iRate sharedInstance].applicationBundleID to the bundle ID of your live app.\n\nUnfortunately by removing the actual IDs from your bug report it's a bit hard for me to follow exactly what the issue is. I take it that in the console when iRate reports that \"iRate found that the application bundle ID (com.domain.appID)\" the ID is the ID of your ad-hoc app, and not the ID you set?\n\nWhere in your code are you setting the [iRate sharedInstance].applicationBundleID? Is it possible that it's being set after iRate has already made the app store request?\n. Is your app actually live already?\n. Can you post the exact setup code that you're using, including the correct bundle/appIDs so I can try it and see if I can work out why it's not working?\n\nI can understand if you don't want to post them here (although it is public information anyway) so email it to support at charcoaldesign dot co dot uk if you prefer.\n. This works for me if I paste it into the iPhone Demo app included with iRate:\n\n```\n+ (void)initialize\n{\n\n#define TARGET_NAME_Doddle 1 //also works if I use TARGET_NAME_DoddlePro\n\n    [iRate sharedInstance].previewMode = YES; // also works if set to NO - make sure it's NO for release\n    //[iRate sharedInstance].promptAtLaunch = NO; // demo app doesn't work if this is NO\n    [iRate sharedInstance].onlyPromptIfLatestVersion = NO; // you should set this to YES for release\n    //[iRate sharedInstance].promptAgainForEachNewVersion = YES; // this is the default anyway\n    //[iRate sharedInstance].verboseLogging = NO; // this is the default for non-debug builds\n    [iRate sharedInstance].daysUntilPrompt = 1;\n    [iRate sharedInstance].usesUntilPrompt = 3;\n    [iRate sharedInstance].eventsUntilPrompt = 4;\n    [iRate sharedInstance].remindPeriod = 5.0;\n\n    NSString *bundleID = nil;\n    NSString *appTitle = nil;\n\n#if defined TARGET_NAME_Doddle\n\n    bundleID = @\"com.doddleme.Doddle\";\n    appTitle = @\"Doddle\";\n\n#elif defined TARGET_NAME_DoddlePro\n\n    appTitle = @\"DoddlePro\";\n    bundleID = @\"com.doddleme.DoddlePro\";\n\n#endif\n\n    [iRate sharedInstance].applicationName = appTitle; // used in default message\n    [iRate sharedInstance].applicationBundleID = bundleID; // if you set this you don't need to set appID\n    [iRate sharedInstance].message = nil; //this doesn't work - if you want to clear the message use @\"\"\n    [iRate sharedInstance].messageTitle = [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"Please Rate %@\", appTitle];\n    [iRate sharedInstance].cancelButtonLabel = @\"No, thanks\"; //this is the default anyway\n    [iRate sharedInstance].rateButtonLabel = @\"Yes\";\n    [iRate sharedInstance].remindButtonLabel = @\"Remind Me Later\"; //this is the default anyway\n\n}\n```\n\nI don't think I've made any significant changes from what you posted, except to remove redundant code (I've also put in some comments for code that you should look at more closely).\n\nDoes the code above work for you?\n. iRate normally gets the bundle ID from the plist. You only need to set it if you want something different from the plist (e.g. for an ad hoc build that uses a different bundle ID).\n. This is behaving as expected. From the documentation for the eventsUntilPrompt property:\n\n\"once the day threshold is reached, the prompt will appear if either the event threshold OR uses threshold is reached. This defaults to 10 events.\"\n\nSo if you are not using the usesUntilPrompt value, you should set it to INT_MAX instead of setting it to 1, then it won't factor into the equation.\n. Sorry, I didn't see your update. I've moved it to the bottom of your post so it's clearer for anyone else who is reading.\n. Thanks! It was actually professionally translated, but I guess you never know what you're getting.\n. Have you added a Localizable.strings file to your project and made sure that Portuguese is selected as a supported language in Project > Info?\n\nIf so, try doing a clean build from the Product menu - it may just be that you have a previously cached strings file from the old version.\n. It used to be the case that iRate would be localised to all supported languages even if your project was not, but this is not what most people would want. Is it really the case that you have no text in your app that needs to be localised apart from iRate?\n\nHere is a tutorial that includes screenshots of how to add new languages: http://www.aboveground.com/blog/xcode-4-4-and-localizable-strings-no-way-to-add-language\n\nNote that this is the Info tab under Project, not under Targets.\n. The reasoning was that it's a bit odd to have mixed content in an app. If the rest of the app is in English, one particular modal should not be displayed in Russian, or whatever.\n. It is true that iTunes will display all the languages you've added, but the idea is that you should only add support for the languages that you intend to localise your whole app for, and ignore the other ones that iRate supports.\n. I may be able to add it back as an option. I'll think about it.\n\nThe previous solution was a pretty nasty hack, requiring me to basically bypass the standard localisation mechanism, pre-compile strings into binary plists, etc. The new solution is much cleaner and more compatible with how Apple intends it to work.\n. OK, I have a solution that should work. Give me a little while.\n. OK, check out version 1.5.5. I think I've found a solution that should suit everyone.\n. FYI, I've renamed 1.5.5 to 1.6, but it's the same code, in case you were wondering.\n. Why would you want to build on Xcode < 4.5?\n. I suggest you revert to iRate 1.6 until you've upgraded your CI server. You can get iRate 1.6 from the tags page in github.\n. Sorry, I meant 1.5.3.\n. The App Store under iOS6 can be a little bit flakey. Can you paste the URL that iRate is attempting to open and I'll see if it looks correct (it would help if you don't obfuscate your app ID - it's public information anyway).\n. It seems Apple changed the format of the URL slightly. That was nice of them.\n\nI've fixed it in 1.6.2.\n. Sorry for not responding earlier - I now have so many projects it's hard to keep track of them all!\n\nThis seems like a good feature suggestion, although if it can't take you directly to the ratings page then it should probably be optional. I'll investigate.\n. That's a clever solution, but it would mean localising that extra text, which at this point would be a nightmare. I think it's fine as it is, if people can't find the review tab when it's right in front of them then you probably don't want them writing a review :-)\n\nAnyway, this feature is now included in version 1.7.\n. Yes, remind period can only be set in terms of days.\n\nYou can implement this easily enough using the delegate by setting usesCount back to zero after they ask to be reminded.\n. The error is because iRate now requires the StoreKit framework to be included in your project.\n. The deprecation warning is fixed in 1.7.1\n. I've incorporated @nonamelive's fix into 1.7.2\n. So you're saying that [SKStoreProductViewController class] returns a non-nil object on iOS5 if you build an app using XCode 4.6 DP3?\n\nThat's very strange. It sounds like a bug in XCode, but it's worrying nonetheless. Can you log the value of [SKStoreProductViewController class] and see what it says?\n. I haven't changed anything. If it's not happening now then it's presumably because Apple fixed something.\n. When I say zero config, I mean zero :-)\n. It sounds like your iRate.m file hasn't been added to your app target for some reason. In the right hand sidebar, check the correct target is checked for that file.\n. You need to add the StoreKit framework (it's mentioned in the 1.5 README under installation instructions).\n. Thanks for the tip. I'll take it under advisement.\n. Upon further reflection, you were right. But you're still a ... challenging individual.\n. Comments are closed for this post.\n. It's not really a good idea to subclass iRate. This might work, but only by coincidence. iRate loads itself by calling the sharedInstance method automatically. If you call sharedInstance on your subclass before iRate has loaded it will override the static variable and so the instance that gets created will be your class, but if iRate loads before you call sharedInstance on your subclass then your subclass's sharedInstance method will return the iRate instance that's already been created.\n\nBasically, subclassing singletons is a bad idea.\n\nWhat is it you are trying to do with your subclass? Can it be done using the iRate delegate instead?\n. Yeah, I guessed that's why it was working, but it's not something you want rely on. I might change the way loading works in a future release and end up swapping the order.\n\nThe shouldPromptForRating method is exposed so that you can _call_ it from your own code.\n. Heh. If you look at the codebase for 1.6.2 and earlier, I already had this exact feature.\n\nI made a policy decision in 1.7 to remove support for manual memory management, for the following reasons:\n\n1) It's very easy to selectively enable ARC for a single file in a non-ARC project (see README).\n2) I don't want to encourage or endorse the use of manual memory management - I think it's crazy.\n. Hi Alberto,\n\nAs per my first point, you can use iRate in a project that does not use ARC by setting the -fobjc-arc flag on the iRate.m file without needing to upgrade your project to ARC.\n\nIf you are including iRate inside a library then if you apply the -fobject-arc flag the iRate.m within the library project, end users need not be aware of it at all.\n. Sorry, it's not possible as far as I know. I haven't personally found that it's an issue, even though my game is played by kids quite a bit. Out of hundreds of reviews I've only had a handful of 1 or 2 star reviews, and only one or two where the text was incongruous (i.e. they said they loved it but rated it 1 star).\n. I'm not sure I fully understand the question.\n\nIf you want to show iRate after a specific number of custom-defined events then you can do that by calling the logEvent method, but iRate doesn't let you specify multiple types of event.\n\nIf you need to do that you can do it by keeping track of the events yourself and then returning YES or NO in the iRate shouldPromptForRating delegate method if your custom event threshold has been reached, or by just bypassing iRate's logic entirely and calling promptForRating when you determine that you need to.\n. iRate doesn't have any text input code, it just calls the StoreKit API to show the rating panel. If the keyboard isn't appearing in the in-app rating view then that's an Apple bug and you should file a radar with them.\n\nThat said, as a workaround you can disable in-app-ratings by setting disaplyAppUsingStorekitifAvailable = NO, then it will take people to the app store instead.\n. @stuffmc - thanks, this has been fixed.\n\n@fredericcormier sorry, are you saying it _should_ have the \"le\", or that that is wrong? (apologies but the copy has been updated since and I'm not sure which version you commented on).\n. Thanks. This is fixed in latest beta.\n. That's weird. Is it happening on the device or only the simulator?\n\nI don't really have any control over the display of the StoreKit modal, so if it's not working correctly there's not much you can do except disable the StoreKit feature.\n. 1) Can you be more specific about the display issue?\n2) What iOS version are you running?\n3) What happens when you run the iPhone example included with the iRate library in your iPad?\n. I think someone else reported a similar issue, but they said it was ok on the device. Must've just been an xcode bug. \n. Sorry, I've not decided if I want to add this feature or not. I can see that it's potentially useful, but it would open the flood gate to basically duplicating all of iRate's fir notification scheduling functionality for reminders as well, and that doesn't seem reasonable. I'm therefore considering whether a different approach would be better, but as yet can't think of one.\n. I use a global gitignore file to avoid adding noise to my individual libraries, so no need for this.\n. I would encourage them to also use global .gitignore files.\n. By enabling preview mode you are telling iRate to pop up every time the app opens. Preview mode is only supposed to be used for debugging purposes.\n\nAlso, you shouldn't perform configuration in your button action because it's misleading. iRate is a singleton, so any configuration you perform has a global effect. Do all your configuration in the initialize method.\n. Unfortunately SKStoreKit doesn't have a method to go directly to the reviews page. If you want to use the direct link you can disable storeKit and iRate will launch the App Store instead.\n. Yes, I'll do that \u2013 it was an oversight.\n. Thanks, I'll merge it now.\n. This makes sense logically, but I don't love the increasing clutter in the public interface caused by these customisation methods. I'll think about this for a while. Perhaps there's an alternative approach.\n. The former, unfortunately. You can disable StoreKit if you prefer and it will open the correct tab in the App Store app instead.\n. Are you using the latest version? Can you post a stack trace, and if possible use breakpoints to identify the line where it happens?\n. Those are delegate methods - you don't override them, you define them in your app delegate.\n\nBut you don't need to do that to disable StoreKit - you just set \n\n```\n[iRate sharedInstance].displayAppUsingStorekitIfAvailable = NO;\n```\n\nIn your app delegate.\n. Can you give an example of a scenario where this would be necessary?\n. This is no longer relevant since Apple now no longer allows apps to be rated using the in-app store page\n. iRate already passes -Wall - what settings are you using? \n. You're preaching to the choir with respect to warnings, but if you turn on an arbitrary set of warnings then any code will fail at least some of them. I test against -Wall, which represents the complete set of recommended clang warnings (recommended because they don't generate a lot of false positives, as opposed to, say -Wextra, or -Weverything).\n\nUnless you have an argument and/or supporting evidence for why the specific warning settings you have chosen to enable  in your project are important, I'm not sure why I should worry about them.\n\nIt's not that I don't consider warnings important in general, it's just that I prefer to follow a consistent set of coding standards across all of my projects, based on well-defined criteria, and currently I code against -Wall.\n. Some context for why I use -Wall:\n\nhttp://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/122608/clang-warning-flags-for-objective-c-development\n. I would use -Wextra, but it flags up stuff like unused arguments in delegate methods, which makes it palpably useless. It also doesn't catch loss-of-precision afaik.\n\nI don't have an opinion on loss of precision particularly. Which flag enables it? Maybe I'll give it a try as an addition to -Wall.\n\nAs to your immediate problem, I suggest maybe building iRate as a static lib, or using CocoaPods. That way you can use it in your project without incurring warnings or having to maintain a fork with your fixes\n. As of version 1.8 beta, iRate is now fully -Wextra compliant. That will probably still have warnings for the settings yo use however.\n. Hi Mark,\n\nYou've set promptAtLaunch to NO, meaning that iRate won't display a prompt unless you specifically tell it to somewhere in your code.\n\nJust remove that setting and it should work fine.\n\nNick\n\nOn 9 May 2013, at 21:08, Mark Paul Keefe notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Hi Nick,\n> \n> I have no idea what I'm doing wrong, but for the life of me, I have never had iRate work except in preview mode.

Hi Mark,\n\nIf you do that it will always prompt, regardless of the settings you've specified, or whether there is a network connection.\n\nYou probably want to use:\n\nif ([[iRate sharedInstance] shouldPromptForRating])\n{\n    [[iRate sharedInstance] promptIfNetworkAvailable];\n}\n\nNick\n. Yes. If the prompt is already visible on screen then it won't display another prompt, and if the user dismisses the prompt then shouldPromptForRating should return NO until the rules are re-satisfied.\n. Which OS version is this on? In-app reviews are only supported on iOS6+\n. Curious. I don't control the experience inside the StoreKit window though. Is this happening on a live app in the store, or just in testing mode? It may be because you haven't bought the app, etc.\n. Does this happen for you in the sample app included with iRate? If not, what happens if you change the bundle ID to match your app?\n. I think this may be a change in iOS 6.1.3. It's not something that I can control.\n. Yes. I may remove the option since it seems that it's no longer useful.\n. As of iOS 7 it does not seem to be possible to go direct to review page anymore. StoreKit is now disabled by default, but you can re-enabled it if you want.\n. Yes, this is a feature not a bug. It's actually documented in the README file in the openRatingsPageImAppStore method description.\n. See the documentation for that method.\n. That's a good idea actually. I can do that.\n. Just an update - I've partially implemented this, in that the bundleID is saved in settings. I've not implemented prefetching of the bundle ID on first launch though.\n. This is now fully implemented in 1.8.1\n. This may be a silly question, but is your app live yet?\n. OK, @andy380743909, your app worked with iRate when I tried it (the bundle ID is com.livestation.lualuaar, correct?) - if it's not working for you, can you check the console log (you may need to enable verbose logging) and paste it here?\n\n@therauli iRate will work fine with your app once it is in the store, but it won't work until it's live. You can fix that by setting the app ID explicitly, but that isn't necessary. Enable preview mode if you'd like to see what it will look like before you submit.\n. Make sure you are using the latest version of iRate by the way - Apple changed the URLs for iOS 6.1, so if you have a version that's a few months old, that may be why it doesn't work.\n. You don't need to set the appstore ID manually - iRate gets your bundle ID from the info.plist automatically. To test it, set previewMode = YES.\n. To actually verify that the event-based logic you've implemented works, the simplest way is to set the bundle ID in your plist to another app that's already on the store (you can use the rainbowblocks bundle I included in the example) and then change the date on the device or simulator to however many days in the future your logic is set to trigger.\n. iRate checks the iTunes JSON feed, so it won't work until the app is actually live. If it gets as far as showing that error though, everything is working fine.\n. You should not build apps using SDK version 5 - apple won't accept them. If you wish to support iOS 5, build using SDK 6 but set the minimum deployment target to iOS 5.\n. Detection of the iOS version has to be done at runtime, it an't be done at compile time. iRate will correctly detect that it is running on iOS 5 and disable the StoreKit functionality, but it has to be built using SDK 6 or the compiler won't recognise the StoreKit symbols.\n. Thanks. I've incorporate these fixes into the latest beta.\n. Yeah, I'll keep an eye on it, but as @ddaddy says, it makes sense to wait for GM before changing anything.\n. Are you seeing anything in the logs?\n. That sounds like it's unrelated to iOS 7. Did it work for you on iOS 6?\n. Yeah, I've made the same change in the later beta. It's not ideal because it doesn't take you to the actual ratings page, but it's better than nothing.\n. Yes. Still doesn't work.\n\nI've pushed a new beta that just points to the app page on iOS7 for now.\n\nHopefully they'll either fix it by the final release, or an alternative link will present itself.\n\nNick\n. Fixed in 1.8 beta 2\n. You drag and drop the iRate class (iRate.h + iRate.m).  that comes with the library into your project. You do not need to create any classes or write any code. You do need to add the StoreKit framework as well though (google how to add built in frameworks in Xcode, if you're not sure).\n. CocoaPods is a useful tool, but it doesn't relate directly to your problem. From the sounds of it, you've probably just made a simple error when importing the iRate files or the framework.\n\nTrying to use pods at this point will probably cause more confusion. Trying to run before you can walk, so to speak.\n. What were the compile errors you were getting? Can you paste the console output into your question?\n. Can you add the files back in, then zip up your project (with errors) and email it to support at charcoal design dot co dot uk. I'll take a look.\n. I'm really sorry to hear that - it must be a new rule. StoreKit isn't critical to iRate's functionality. I'll release a patch ASAP.\n. I've pushed version 1.8 beta that disabled StoreKit by default, and no longer requires that you link against the framework.\n. Fixed in 1.8 beta 4\n. Don't worry, it's not a private API. It's just that to get the root view controller, iRate tries various checks including looking to see if your AppDelegate has a property called viewController. If it doesn't, you get this warning. I'll update iRate with a fix tonight, but if you can't wait then it's safe to either remove that code or ignore the warning.\n. This is fixed in beta 3\n. Yep - this is fixed in the latest beta.\n. Soon, I expect. Once I'm confident that it's doesn't have any issues.\n\nIf you need to launch now I'd advise just linking it straight into your app.\n. The property was removed because it existed only in case of possible conflicts with future iOS versions - I was under the impression it worked fine for all cases on iOS 6. I'll see if I can tweak its behaviour to work correctly in your case. \n. OK, this is fixed in beta 6\n. I actually quite like this idea, but it is regarded as a sleazy trick, apparently:\n\nhttp://www.zumsteg.net/2013/12/13/how-skimming-reviews-makes-apps-twice-as-slimy/\n. I've already added support for the new format in the 1.8 beta. Are you having problems with the latest version?\n. I don't think it's explicitly documented, but it will continue to be called every time the app is opened until the user explicitly declines it.\n\nYou can also trigger it manually whenever you want by saying if(shouldPromptForRating) promptForRating.\n. Yep.\n. I normally use a common base class for all my controllers. Makes it easy to do something like that.\n. No, there's no way to tell if the user rated the app.\n. I'm actually not sure what the correct solution is here. I've tried to replicate the iOS lookup behaviour in iRate, and I assumed that iOS would use the next item in your language list if it didn't find the first, but maybe it should just default straight to US english instead?\n. To be clear though - this definitely doesn't affect all (or even most users) as I'm pretty sure that anyone who hasn't been swapping languages for testing purposes will have US english as the second item in their languages list, not French (I do).\n. Adding an en-GB localisation is clearly the simplest fix. Just not sure if it's the correct one.\n. This is fixed in 1.8.1\n. That is true, but it was unnecessary in this case because iRate is a singleton.\n\nCan you give an example of how this causes a problem in other language bindings? (I assume you mean something like RubyMotion or Xamarin, but I'm not very familiar with these tools).\n. You don't need to define appStoreIS to test an app that isn't on the store. Preview mode will let you test and it will pick up the ID automatically when the app is released.\n. Very true. I'll investigate what's going on there.\n. Fixed in 1.8.1\n. Yes, Apple seem to have disabled the button on iOS 7. I suggest you don't use that feature (I'll probably remove it in the next version unless Apple decide to reinstate support for it).\n. I've removed Storekit support in 1.8.1 as I don't think Apple are going to put this feature back :-(\n. I'm not sure. It didn't work for me when I tried it previously, but maybe they changed their minds again.\n. Is the bundle ID of the version you are testing the same as the bundle ID of the live version?\n. Actually, what method are you using to open the App Store from your button? iRate looks up the app ID automatically when it's running in the default mode (rating after a specific number of uses), but if you implement your own button you need to trigger that lookup manually, or set the app ID explicitly.\n. The method you should use for a \"rate this app\" button is:\n\n```\n- (void)promptIfNetworkAvailable;\n```\n\nIf you call\n\n```\n- (void)promptForRating;\n```\n\nInstead, it will only work if you've set the appStoreID explicitly (which normally isn't necessary).\n. I see the problem. It's not your fault, maybe I need to be clearer in the documentation.\n\nCurrently though, to use this method, you need to set the [iRate sharedInstance].appStoreID explicitly. You can get your appStoreID from your iTunes connect page (or it's just the numeric part of the iTunes URL for your app).\n\nI'll see if I can make this work more intuitively in the next release.\n. The better way is to do this, but it's bit more complex:\n\n```\n@implementation MyViewController\n\n- (IBAction)promptForRating:(id)sender;\n{\n    //perform manual check\n    [iRate sharedInstance].delegate = (id<iRateDelegate>)self;\n    [[iRate sharedInstance] promptIfNetworkAvailable];\n\n    //you might want to disable the button and show a spinner here\n}\n\n- (void)iRateCouldNotConnectToAppStore:(NSError *)error\n{\n    //restore delegate\n    [iRate sharedInstance].delegate = (id<iRateDelegate>)[UIApplication sharedApplication].delegate;\n\n    //hide spinner and display error\n}\n\n- (BOOL)iRateShouldPromptForRating\n{\n    //don't show prompt, just open app store\n    [[iRate sharedInstance] openRatingsPageInAppStore];\n\n    //restore delegate\n    [iRate sharedInstance].delegate = (id<iRateDelegate>)[UIApplication sharedApplication].delegate;\n\n    //hide spinner\n\n    return NO;\n}\n\n@end\n```\n. That's fine. The rating button should still work OK.\n\nThis approach disables the automatic rating popup though - it will only let you rate by pressing the button.\n. To be clear, it's an either/or thing. Either set the numeric appStoreID, or use the code I specified. You don't need to do both.\n. OK, I've updated the code sample above so it won't stop the normal notification from working.\n\nThe rating won't work in the simulator because there's no App Store app for it to open. It should work fine if you run it on a device.\n. It shouldn't be, unless your app isn't live. Are you sure you're using the latest version? What error did you get?\n. Sorry about that, but in version 1.8, the documentation did state that the openRatingsPageInAppStore method required the ID - it was only the automatic rating prompt that did not.\n\nAs of the latest version, that method does not require it either.\n. Oops. Well spotted. Thanks!\n. I've enabled -Weverything in the warning settings and I'm still not seeing the issues you mention. Any idea what compiler settings you might be using to generate these?\n. I've fixed these in 1.8.3.\n. iRate runs automatically, you don't need to add any code to your app to make it run.\n\nTo disable iRate, either add [iRate sharedInstance].promptAtLaunch = NO; to your app delegate initialize method, or just remove the iRate pod from your project.\n. +(void)load;\n. This method has been removed in the latest version of iRate anyway because iOS7 no longer allows you to rate apps via the StoreKit modal.\n. Way ahead of you.\n\nhttps://github.com/nicklockwood/iRate/blob/master/RELEASE%20NOTES.md\n. I understand this point of view, but I honestly can't imagine that the amount of users who write multiple reviews for the same app is worth the negative PR of having this feature.\n\nIn retrospect I wish that I had implemented a (less radical) reduction in this functionality earlier so that things didn't come to the extreme that they did, but ultimately it's not worth the damage to my reputation to put this back in, so I won't.\n\nIt's possible (though not especially easy) to implement this yourself using iRate's delegate system, or you could fork the library and put it back, but I'd urge you to reconsider doing so, at least until you've shipped a few updates and verified that the lack of this feature is actually having a negative impact on the reviews you are receiving.\n. I'll think about it.\n. This is implemented in version 1.10.\n. This seems more like an issue with how the iOS localisation system works than something that should be fixed in iRate. \n\nYou can use the Slovenian strings when the device is in English by copying the Slovenian iRate strings into your apps en localisable.strings file. Then they'll override the en strings in the iRate bundle.\n. Fixed in 1.9.1.\n. Wow, that's a lot of locales. Thanks!\n. Can you check which version of iRate you are using? (it's in the header file)\n. OK, well I can't reproduce this. If you have more info or steps to reproduce, please reopen.\n. I haven't forgotten about it, but since it's not fixing any bugs or adding any critical new features, and I don't want to risk introducing bugs by merging it without testing it properly, I'd prefer to wait and include it in the next planned release, which may be a little while away.\n. Done. But can you clarify what you mean by a dev ID that's not public?\n. No, you would have to implement a completely custom alert, which you can do using the delegate.\n. Sorry, closed by accident!\n. If you have verbose logging enabled, you should be able to see exactly why it isn't showing from the logs. You can extract these from the settings on the device in a production build.\n\nthe promptIfNetworkAvailable method should only work after app has launched, so that's normal.\n. Makes sure [iRate sharedInstance].verboseLogging = YES, then have a look at what iRate logs to the console - it should give detailed feedback about why it has or hasn't prompted for feedback.\n. Actually sorry, I take that back. This makes testing certain custom functionality more difficult. E.g. the advanced Mac example project included with the library.\n. I've added a comment to this effect in the previewMode documentation.\n. Cool, I'll check it out. Thanks!\n. This is implemented in version 1.10\n. That's because it's a calculated property. If you set\n\ndeclinedThisVersion = NO;\n\nIt will have the effect of resetting declinedAnyVersion to NO as well (which in retrospect is a bit weird, but never mind).\n. Which version did you ship in production? I found a bug in 1.10 that would account for this, but it was only released a couple of days ago.\n. No problem. Sorry about that!\n. I've added this fix to 1.10.1\n. This is fixed in 1.10.1\n. If firstUsed was nil (due to the user having installed an app running version iRate 1.10, and not previously having used an earlier version) then there is no possible way to know when the app was actually first used, so assuming that the first use date is now is the best we can do.\n. You're right that this is a bug, but wrong about the effect. The iRateLastVersionUsedKey isn't used in the onlyPromptIfLatestVersion check.\n\nThe effect of the bug is that if you update the app, every time it opens it will move the self.firstUsed date forward by one day, with the effect that it will never display the rating prompt, regardless of the settings.\n. OK, I think this is fixed in 1.10.2. Let me know if you see any other issues.\n. Hi, you're partly right. Th problem with your patch was that you never reset the logic once the app is updated, which meant that the promptForNewVersionIfUserRated would always prompt the day after they install the new version, which isn't what I wanted.\n\nMy fix didn't work correctly, but that's what it was trying to achieve.\n\nI believe I've now implemented this correctly. To be honest I need some unit tests around this because it's way too complex to test manually, but it's not really structured in a way that makes it easy to automate.\n\nAnyway, to address a couple of your points:\n\n3) Why do you use +1 in the if condition? I don't quite understand. The if should be the same like the one checking whether it's time to rate now. If it's not time to rate now, no problem.\n\nIf the user had installed the app daysUntilPrompt -  1 second ago, then your logic wouldn't reset the time, so potentially they might still be notified the same day (e.g. if the closed and reopened the app and the time was now daysUntilPrompt + a few seconds). By subtracting an extra day, I avoid that issue.\n\n5) Just one minor thing I have noticed is that since you update defaults in any case now, [defaults synchronize] should be moved out of the else block behind it. But this really isn't a big problem - you could actually skip the synchronize calls completely as iOS calls synchronize for you automatically (it's useful just in the case the app crashes before).\n\nThe firstUsed setter method calls synchronise automatically, so this is not actually a bug.\n. Ha ha, whoops. I thought I'd fixed that.\n. Er, yes, you're right about the ratedVersion:lastUsedVersion thing too. Man, I am not on my game today.\n. Yeah. Let's not do this again :-)\n. Does your app only support portrait? Have you implemented any code for - (BOOL)shouldAutorotate, etc?\n. This isn't actually a bug, but a design decision. Arguably it was a bad decision, but applying this fix as it stands actually breaks the default functionality, since usesUntilPrompt defaults to 10, so any app that doesn't log any events will never present the notification.\n\nIf you want to prevent notifications unless both use count AND event count have been reached, you can add this additional check using the iRate delegate.\n. I'll leave this open for now - I may consider changing this behaviour at some point but it will need some other changes to be made as well.\n. I have no objection in principle, but it seems a little redundant since you can just broadcasts a notification yourself from the app delegate if needed.\n. No problem. Sorry for the oversight.\n. The best option is to disable iRate in the `+initialize` method using\n\n```\n[Shades sharedInstance].promptAtLaunch = NO;\n```\n\nThen, once you have downloaded your configuration file and configured shades, call\n\n```\nif ([Shades sharedInstance].shouldPromptForRating)\n{\n    [[Shades sharedInstance] promptIfNetworkAvailable];\n}\n```\n\n(Or just wait until the next time the app launches, and don't disable Shades if the config file has already been downloaded).\n. Well spotted - I totally agree.\n. Thanks!\n. This is included in 1.11.\n. Goog to know - thanks!\n. Looks good. I've merged it into 1.11\n. That isn't a bug, that's telling you that iRate is working correctly but that it can't open the ratings page on the simulator because it doesn't exist (you have to test on a device).\n. DEBUG is a standard macro set by Apple for debug builds. You may have removed it or not set it in your project, but that shouldn't cause any problems.\n. Which is...?\n. I don't understand the question.\n. Oh, I see. Will you be putting your app in the store eventually?\n. Just put the library in your program and it will work automatically when you submit to the app store.\n. These two issues are unrelated.\n\nThe Cocoa.h not found bug was due to the `#import <TargetConditionals.h>` being missing from iRate.h - I've fixed that for the next release.\n\nThe country detection is working correctly for me, but it is based on the locale of your system. If your device (or the simulator) is set to US locale then it will use that - I expect that's why it wasn't working correctly for you.\n\nIf you want to hard-code the locale however, you can do so by putting the following in your App Delegate - there's no need to modify the iRate library:\n\n```\n+ (void)initialize\n{\n    [iRate sharedInstance].appStoreCountry = @\"gb\";\n}\n```\n. Have you looked at the iPhone Custom UI Demo included with the example projects?\n. Hmm. This is problematic, but UIAlertView is deprecated, so not supporting UIAlertController isn't really a long-term solution. I guess I can add an option to not use UIAlertController for now, but at some point it will probably become mandatory.\n. OK, I've added a property \"useUIAlertControllerIfAvailable\", and set it to NO by default.\n. I can imagine this will cause some pain in future, but it should solve the problem for now.\n. Sorry about that. It was a bug in 1.11 that was fixed in 1.11.2. The only solution is to upgrade to latest and re-release the app.\n. It should work AFAIK, but you can test it yourself by setting previewMode = YES (remember to set it back to NO before release)\n. The code is correct. It used to be the current version but the behaviour has since changed and the documentation is now incorrect.\n. Hmm, I thought that I was registering \"No, Thanks\" as the cancel button, so it's curious that it would behave differently from other apps. I'll take a look.\n. In stacked layout, the cancel button always appears at the bottom, regardless of whether you add it first. Seems odd that side-by-side layout works differently.\n\n(Not doubting you, just confused by the inconsistency)\n. If your [UIApplication sharedApplication].delegate doesn't have a window property, that means it doesn'f conform to UIApplicationDelegat protocol, which sounds like a pretty serious bug in your app. I'm not too familiar with what consitutes normal for a cocos2D app though.\n. Yes, it's possible by using the delegate. But have you looked at my iPrompt and iNotify libraries? They might be better suited for what you're trying to do.\n. If you add this to your app delegate, iRate will never prompt automatically:\n\n```\n+ (void)initialize\n{\n    [iRate sharedInstance].promptAtLaunch = NO;\n}\n```\n. Well, you know what they say: naming things is the hardest problem in computer science \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af \n. Based on the stack trace, the crash is related to some GPU/OpenGL library, not part of iRate. Some Googling suggests that it's part of Apple's MapView implementation?\n\nI suspect what it happening is that iRate is appearing in front of your MapView or OpenGL-based view, and that view is crashing due to a bug. Perhaps it doesn't like being paused or put into the background?\n\nThe best way to replicate it is probably to try showing an alert at random times after startup in your app and seeing what happens and/or to report this bug to Apple and see what they say (although they'll probably need a simple project that reproduces the issue to be able to do anything - as would I)\n. If you can't find or reproduce the problem, your best option is probably to disable the automatic display of iRate on launch by adding this to AppDelegate\n\n```\n- (void)initialize {\n    [iRate sharedInstance].promptAtLaunch  = NO;\n}\n```\n\nThen, when you get to a safe point in the app, call\n\n```\n[[iRate sharedInstance] promptIfAllCriteriaMet];\n```\n\nWhich will show the rating dialog, but only if all the criteria you've set have been met (number of days installed, etc).\n. Just set [iRate sharedInstance].promptAtLaunch = NO; in AppDelegate +initialize method, then add a button which calls [iRate sharedInstance] promptIfNetworkAvailable];\n. AFAIK that isn't possible with a standard alert. You can build your own alert and tell irate to use it though, by using the delegate functions.\n. Gah, more despicable app review bullshit. Try appealing it, since it's clearly not in violation - that check is only there so developers using iRate aren't confused when they try to run in on a simulator.\n\nMeanwhile, I'll add a fix to remove that code and replace it with `#if TARGET_IPHONE_SIMULATOR` which will do the same job.\n. OK, thanks!\n. There's no way to know, unfortunately.\n. They are used by the macOS target. That code is compiled out on iOS using #ifdef statements.. I have another library called iVersion that does exactly what you're asking for. You can use it together with iRate in the same project.\n. I use `+load` to support zero config (no need to reference iRate in code - it just works).\r\n\r\nIf you want to disable iRate with a feature flag, you can do so by setting `[iRate sharedInstance].promptAtLaunch = NO;` in your app delegate.. I'd guess this is fixed now? I don't use Carthage though, so please confirm.\n. Thanks for bringing this to my attention. Fixed in 1.11.6\n. Hi Seb,\n\nMake sure that the iRate.bundle has been included in your project, and that it is included in your app target.\n\nIf it is, try looking inside the app bundle of your built app and verify that the iRate.bundle is in there.\n. @iLandes SwiftyiRate appears to be an uncredited copy of iRate. I have nothing to do with that project, and I'd encourage you to use this one instead, as I cannot vouch for the other one.. As far as I know, there are no issues.. Should be fixed in 1.11.7. Thanks!. iRate sets the bundle ID automatically using\r\n\r\n    [[NSBundle mainBundle] bundleIdentifier]\r\n\r\nWhich is equivalent to the code you pasted. You only need to set it manually yourself if you want to override it for some reason.. If you ask for a rating after the 3 requests, nothing will happen. If you want to have \"request review\" button in the app, you should not use SKStoreReviewController (and iRate doesn't, if you call the promptForRating method manually).. Fixed in 1.12. Implemented in 1.12. Well, iRate now uses the official API on iOS 10.3 and above, so it should be OK.. Yes, this is a bug. It sounds like *not* using SKStoreReviewControllerIfAvailable may be prohibited on iOS 11 anyway, so I may just remove the option.. AFAIK, Apple is now rejecting apps that don't use SKStoreReviewControllerIfAvailable, so this seems like a low priority to fix.. You shouldn't need to call ` [[iRate sharedInstance] promptForRating];` at all. It will automatically display the prompt once all criteria are met. The `promptForRating` method is only needed if you want to have a \"rate now\" button in your settings or something.. If you use `-[[iRate sharedInstance] logEvent: YES]` the prompt will show immediately after you've called it`eventsUntilPrompt` times, provided that the other criteria have also been met.. It's intentional. Apple says that you should never show SKStoreReviewController using a user-facing button because it's not guaranteed to appear.. Yes, it's because initialize is only called the first time you reference the class, and I want it to be executed even if you don't have any references to iRate in your code (zero-config mode).. I have no control over that dialog, but it makes sense that Apple would disable the button in debug builds, or in cases where you aren't permitted to submit a review (e.g. Because you haven't bought the app, or it's not been released yet). Is this using the latest version of iRate? The URL changed recently.. @zapjonny you can override the URL without forking iRate by adding this to your setup code:\r\n\r\n     [iRate sharedInstance].ratingsURL = ...\r\n\r\n. That's not really related functionality. I already have another lib called iVersion for that purpose.. Did you look in the console logs in Xcode? iRate should tell you why it didn't appear.\r\n\r\nYou might need to set `iRate.sharedInstance().verboseLogging = true` though.. SKStoreReviewController implements its own throttling, so it won't keep prompting aftet the user rates the app.. I'm not sure how that's measured. I'm assuming that a) it won't prompt the user to rate a version they've already rated, and b) a request to rate that doesn't display anything won't count against the 3 prompt limit.\r\n\r\nAFAIK, there's no way to detect whether the user actually rated the app, which is why I don't set the ratedThisVersion flag.. Any particular reason? (other than avoiding noise in the change logs)\n. OK, I'll make a mental note to remove them for the next update. Glad you like iRate!\n. Yes, it's designed to clear out all the settings if it detects that the version number has changed.\n. Hi dlinsin,\n\nI actually made a conscious decision not to include NSLocalizedString() within the library itself, the reason being that if I ever changed the default text strings in a future version, your localised string names would be wrong.\n\nThe recommended approach is to use the setters for the strings from within your app, and localise those, so for example, in your config you could say:\n\n```\n- (void)initialize\n{\n    [iRate sharedInstance].messageTitle = NSLocalizedString(@\"Rate MyApp\", @\"iRate title\");\n    [iRate sharedInstance].message = NSLocalizedString(@\"If you enjoy using MyApp, please rate it\", @\"iRate message\");\n    [iRate sharedInstance].cancelButtonLabel = NSLocalizedString(@\"No, Thanks\", @\"iRate cancel button\");\n    ... etc\n}\n```\n\nThis is slightly more work, but more flexible.\n. Hi Rutger,\n\nTo localize the strings in iRate, first set the message strings in your application initialize method, like this:\n\n<code>\n- (void)initialize\n  {\n      [iRate sharedInstance].appStoreID = 355313284;\n  [iRate sharedInstance].messageTitle = NSLocalizedString(@\"Rate MyApp\", @\"iRate message title\");\n      [iRate sharedInstance].message = NSLocalizedString(@\"If you like MyApp, please take the time, etc\", @\"iRate message\");\n      [iRate sharedInstance].cancelButtonLabel = NSLocalizedString(@\"No, Thanks\", @\"iRate decline button\");\n      [iRate sharedInstance].remindButtonLabel = NSLocalizedString(@\"Remind Me Later\", @\"iRate remind button\");\n      [iRate sharedInstance].rateButtonLabel = NSLocalizedString(@\"Rate It Now\", @\"iRate accept button\");\n  }\n  </code>\n\nYou can now use the standard Apple localization mechanism, which is to run the genstrings command line tool to extract the localizable strings above into a separate .strings file, which you can then translate into the different supported languages.\n\nDoes that answer you question?\n. Apparently the CFBundleDisplayName isn't always defined and doesn't always work, and oddly there's no constant for it, which seems a bit odd.\n\nAny idea where I can find a definitive Apple document stating which I should use under which circumstances?\n. I guess using BundleDisplayName and then falling back to BundleName if it's nil should be safe enough. I'll look at incorporating that in the next build.\n. Fixed in version 1.2.3\n. The problem I have with this approach is that in principle any method that does UI work could crash if called from the background thread. There are several other methods in the library that would crash if you called them from the background, so I'm not sure why this one should be singled out.\n\nI think it's generally good practice to assume that no method is thread safe unless it specifies otherwise. Nothing in the iRate documentation says that it's a good idea to call promptForRating from the background.\n\nIf you need to call it from a background thread, just use performSelectorOnMainThread from your own code.\n. That's actually already possible. Check the advanced example for details, but basically set enabled to NO in initialize and then call the following when you're ready to prompt the user.\n\n```\nif ([[iRate sharedInstance] shouldPromptForRating])\n{\n    [[iRate sharedInstance] promptIfNetworkAvailable];\n}\n```\n. I'm not seeing this warning, I think you must have some non-standard project settings.\n. Yes, you are correct of course. Seems to just be wrong in the header file though.\n. Fixed.\n. That's a good idea. In the meantime you can achieve this by using the existing delegate methods to intercept the rating alert and substitute your own. It's simple enough to create the alert (it's just a UIAlertView) and you can then insert your own logging. You can replicate the effect of the standard alert's buttons by calling the equivalent methods yourself (look under the \"advanced methods\" section in the documentation.\n\nNick\n\nOn 1 Dec 2011, at 10:06, Duane Fields wrote:\n\n> Thanks, great tool.

I've added three new delegate methods that fire when the user selects an option in the rating prompt. Let me know if that's sufficient for your requirements.\n. Hi Mic,\n\nIt shouldn't impact it, but maybe a better idea would be to use the significant event count feature instead. You could log a significant event each time the app launches, and use that to trigger the rating dialog instead.\n\nAs I said, it shouldn't be a problem to disable the notification, but you're better off not modifying the library unless you have to because that way you won't have to re-apply your change every time I do a new release.\n\nNick\n\n(Sent from my iPhone)\n\nOn 14 Dec 2011, at 10:51, Mic Pringle reply@reply.github.com wrote:\n\n> Hey Nick,\n> \n> Would it cause iRate any issues if I remove the support for the above notification ?\n> \n> My iOS app is a music player which will naturally spend most of its time running in the background, only being brought to the foreground by the user when they wish to change the track or album etc. Therefore I don't think that using this notification to increment the use count really suits this scenario, and as such I would only like this to happen on app launch.\n> \n> As far as I can I only need to remove the observer and the subsequent selector but before I do this I just wanted to make sure nothing else, that Iv'e missed, relies on this particular notification.\n> \n> Mic\n> \n> ---\n> \n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\n> https://github.com/nicklockwood/iRate/issues/10\n. Hi Mic,\n\nHere's how I see it:\n\nMy aim with the library is to make it as useful as possible to a wide audience, but avoid adding features that only apply to one user, or where it will improve the library for a few users at the cost of the majority.\n\nYour aim should be to use the main fork if possible, or persuade me to make changes to the library to support your needs if it doesn't already do so, and only as a last resort should you fork it because even with github's excellent merging, that's still making more work for yourself, risking introducing bugs, and losing the benefits of me supporting issues you have in future.\n\nIt doesn't sound like your problem is particularly unique, but the solution of disabling the foreground event is obviously not something I could ever merge into the trunk. A better solution might be to do as you suggest and add a flag to ignore foreground events, which could then be a feature I could merge back in, but before doing that, let's just analyse your problem at bit more:\n\nThere are three way to trigger a prompt at the moment: 1) number of launches/foreground events, 2) number of days, 3) number of user-defined events.\n\nCriteria 1 and 2 must both be met to trigger a prompt. Criterion 3 is independent (it will trigger a prompt even if 1 and 2 have not been met).\n\nThe aim of these options is to defer the prompt until the user has used your app for a long enough time to have developed an informed an opinion about it (preferably a positive one). For a typical app like a game, this period is about 10 days assuming they use it at least once a day, which is why the uses and days both default to 10.\n\nThe reason why I treat foreground events as a use is because app launches are a very poor metric for interaction on modern iPhones because an app may stay running for days at a time but be opened and closed multiple times during that period. This is equally true for your app - cold launches tell you nothing about how much users are interacting with your app.\n\nOn the other hand, foreground events are quite a good metric for how much people are using your app. A user who installs the app, runs it a few times but then never really interacts with it won't generate any foreground events. A user who does use it properly will presumably frequently change tracks and so generate a lot of foreground events - more than most users of most apps.\n\nSo it seems to me that the best option is to do exactly what you said in option 2; Leave the days parameter at the default of 10, and set the uses parameter to something much higher than normal, say 100. That way users will only be prompted if they have had the app installed for at least 10 days and have used it a reasonable amount during that time.\n\nAlternatively you could ignore the days and uses completely (by setting them both to a very high number) and log an event whenever the user plays a track, or whatever other metric makes sense for your app, and then prompt the user after they've played 100 tracks (or whatever).\n\nNick\n. Yes, exactly.\n\nNote however that this must be called on the main thread.\n. The logic above is to check if the shouldPromptForRating function should return _NO_, in other words:\n\n\"if too few uses _AND_ too few events then _DO NOT_ prompt\"\n\nThis is consistent with the documentation, because the implication here is that if either the uses or the events thresholds are met then then above condition will fail and it _will_ prompt.\n. Yes, so (using your example) the documentation says that the prompt will show if 3 < 3 _or_ 3 < 16, and that's what's happening. What you are now saying is that you only want it to show if 3 < 3 _and_ 3 < 16, contrary to the documentation.\n\nArguably I guess that may be more useful, so I might consider changing this behaviour, but it's technically correct as documented.\n\nTo override the prompt logic, without modifying the library (which is a bad idea for future compatibility), you can implement the iRateDelegate and supply your own logic in the iRate:shouldPromptForRating: delegate method.\n. I looked into changing the way it works, but it would be too likely to introduce bugs in existing projects due to the defaults. Since both useCount and eventCount default to 10, and both are optional, if I made them mandatory, users would have to remember to set eventCount to zero if they weren't using it, otherwise the rating would never appear. I think it's best just to leave it as it is.\n. Good catch. I'll fix it.\n. Fixed.\n. iRate 1.4 now has English, French, German, Spanish, Italian and Japanese. I did it in a different way using bundles, which is a bit more complex but simpler to integrate into projects.\n. You don't have to use ARC, but you do need to be using Apple LLVM compiler 3 or higher, otherwise it won't compile.\n. Try doing a clean from the Product menu. If that doesn't work, send your project to support at charcoaldesign dot co dot uk and I'll figure out what's going on.\n. I normally just set the remind button to nil for landscape-only games.\n\nYou can implement the above logic using the iRateDelegate to implement your own dialog. That involves duplicating quite a lot of logic though.\n\nI'll have a think about how easy it would be to implement something like this as part of the core library.\n. Thanks for the suggestion.\n\nI've modified the code so that it doesn't rely on hard-coded sizes, and added some logic to handle rotation so that it will be reapplied if the phone is rotated from portrait to landscape.\n\nI've included this in version 1.4.1.\n. Thanks!\n. I don't really understand the purpose of either of these changes. Neither of these lines generate warnings in the example project.\n. Yeah, that's intentional, and is covered in the documentation.\n\nXcode normally converts .strings files to binary plists at build time, but for some reason it didn't seem to work when I used strings files in a standalone bundle, so I pre-converted them\n\nYou can edit the files by right-clicking in Xcode and selecting open as property list.\n. Good point, and this does need a fix of some kind. I might think a little more though about the name for the setting though before I merge this (once I add something to the public API, it's hard to change).\n. Okay, I can't think of anything better - I'll merge it!\n. Are you sure?\n\nBy default, if debug is disabled iRate will only prompt if the following are all true:\n\n1) The version of the app you are running matches the latest version on iTunes\n2) 10 days have passed since the current version was installed\n3) The app has been opened 10 times or more since it was installed\n\nThose are quite hard criteria to recreate during testing, but if you set your configuration to:\n\n```\n[iRate sharedInstance].onlyPromptIfLatestVersion = NO;\n[iRate sharedInstance].daysUntilPrompt = 0;\n[iRate sharedInstance].usesUntilPrompt = 0;\n```\n\nThen you should see the alert. if you don't, maybe your bundle ID is wrong, or there's some other issue?\n\nIf you are trying to test with a brand new, never released before app then don't worry as iRate only works with apps that are on the store already. You can try setting the appStoreID or applicationBundleID to an app you know is on the store if you'd like to double check.\n. Can you tell me your app's bundle ID and paste the code you are usingo to configure iRate, and I'll try to reproduce this at my end.\n. Okay, I understand the issue. I use the device locale for the app store country by default because the vast majority of users use the app in the same country they bought it, and there's no way to find out the actual app store country programmatically.\n\nYour app is not available to buy in Australia, so it's reasonable to assume that the number of users with your app in Australia is essentially zero (other than yourself, obviously, but you're the developer).\n\nI don't really see this as a problem because when the app is released it won't cause a significant number of missed ratings, however if it bothers you, you can set the following code:\n\n[iRate sharedInstance].appStoreCountry = @\"PK\";\n\nWhich will force the app to always check the Pakistan app store.\n\nNick\n. The English, Italian, French, Spanish, Chinese, Turkish and (now) German have been checked or contributed by humans. Not sure about the others.\n. When you say the alert looks \"off\" if the text is too long, can you clarify? For example, are you referring to the German text? And do you mean in portrait or landscape? Which OS version did you test on? Can you provide a link to a screenshot of the problem?\n. French, Italian and Spanish have all been verified by native speakers. Chinese and Turkish were donated by github users, so I don't know if they are accurate but I'm assuming they are. The rest are machine translations.\n\nI don't have the list of names to hand although you can deduce them by studying the pull history for the project if you wish. I fail to see what difference the names would make. I'm not pretending they are human-translated when they are machine translations - why would I? \n\nIf you are unhappy with that, you are free to source your own replacement translations from a professional translation service (I recommend icanlocalize.com), or use the ones from Appirater instead. If you would like to contribute better translations back to the project then they would be gratefully received.\n\nI am however curious about the layout issue you reported. If you can give me reproduction steps, I will fix it.\n. I'm not seeing what you're seeing. Here's a screenshot from iOS 5.1:\n\nhttp://charcoaldesign.co.uk/images/screenshots.irate.2.png\n\nCan you send me a shot of what you are seeing?\n. Update to the latest iRate version and see if you're still seeing the issue. Was your screenshot taken on the simulator or the device?\n. I believe I fixed it. Unfortunately I had to use some \"magic numbers\" for the layout because I couldn't identify the logic that iOS uses to position the labels, so you may find it doesn't work for every possible text combination.\n. I just got the German text professionally retranslated. The text they've produced is:\n\nWenn Sie %@ m\u00f6gen, w\u00fcrden Sie es bitte bewerten? Dies wird nicht l\u00e4nger als eine Minute dauern. Danke f\u00fcr Ihre Unterst\u00fctzung!\n\nDo you have any opinion about this? How does it compare to the text you provided? It seems shorter, so I'll probably use it unless you say it's bad.\n. Please do.\n. Thanks, will do. Wish you'd mentioned it a couple of hours earlier - I just had Polish professionally retranslated! I'll use your version though.\n. It turns out that I was setting the lastReminded property _after_ calling the delegate method, so your setting it to nil had no effect. I've fixed this bug, however in this particular case it probably makes more sense just to set the reminder period to zero.\n\nYou bug is fixed in version 1.4.7, and I've also added an \"Events Demo\" example, which shows how best to implement this behaviour.\n. NSInteger has a maximum value of 2147483647, which is a pretty big number. If your app generated an event every second it would take 68 years to reach that number.\n\nIn the unlikely event it did get to that point, it wouldn't crash, it would just wrap around to -2147483648 and keep counting, so in another 68 years it might pop up the rating dialog again.\n\nSo in conclusion, it's probably not worth worrying about ;-)\n. I just checked and I'm actually using NSUInteger for the event count, so the maximum value is actually 4294967295 and it would take 136 years to wrap around. Apart from that, everything else I said still stands.\n. It's probably a good idea in retrospect, but it's not backward compatible with apps that are already using iRate, so I can't really add it or I'd annoy a lot of users\n. Sorry ;-)\n. Darn. Probably the best bet is to use a more generic app store URL on iOS 6 for now and just open the app page until someone figures out the new direct path.\n. Yeah, the app store in iOS6 seems to be a completely new app. The old one was a web-app and this one appears to be native code, and quite buggy as you point out. I'm seeing all the prices in $ in the UK for example.\n\nHopefully there will still be a URL-based deep-linking mechanism in the final release, but we'll have to wait and see what happens over the course of the beta development.\n. I see they've fixed the currency issue in beta 2. Deep links are still broken though.\n. No fix yet. There's a few months left for Apple to decide to support the old URL scheme, but ultimately if we get to GM and there's still no deep linking to the ratings page in iOS6, I'll just have to make it point at the app page instead.\n. I've fixed this in version 1.5. It may require another update if I do find a way to link directly to the ratings page on iOS6, or if they restore this feature before it's released, but at least for now it will take users to the correct page instead of an error.\n\nI've used itms-apps://ax.itunes.apple.com/app/id123456789 because it launches the app store directly instead of first opening Safari.\n. Great news! I'll restore the original links.\n\nI think we were right to be cautious though. I would have hated to get 1000 support requests today from people whose apps had stopped working ;-)\n. Yes, Apple decided to change the link sometime in the last few days (independently of the iOS6 release).\n\nI released an update to iRate yesterday that fixes them again.\n. It might be worth me giving a clearer error message in this situation - a more specific error like \"Bundle ID not found on app store\" would probably cause less confusion.\n. I've seen the same issue with apps containing some of my other libraries on iOS 4.x. I believe that Apple has changed something in Xcode 4.4 that is breaking ARC code that previously worked.\n\nI don't have a Snow Leopard machine to test on any more. Can you do a couple of experiments for me?\n\n1) Try building your app with Xcode 4.3.3 or earlier, and see if it works correctly on 10.6.8\n\n2) Try building the app using progressively earlier versions of iRate until you find one that works. You can get all the previous releases of iRate from the tags page.\n\nHopefully from the results of those tests I'll be able to work out what's causing the issue and fix it.\n. I've fixed the problem for iOS 4.3, which I'm assuming will also fix it for Mac OS 10.6 as they both use ARCLite.\n\nThe issue was that the + (void)load method was apparently firing before the ARCLite library had fully loaded.\n\nI've deferred the class setup until the main runloop has started, and that seems to have solved the problem. The fix is included in iRate version 1.5.1.\n. I'm sorry you lost many hours to debugging this, but I'm not sure what I could have done beyond fixing the issue when I found it, which I did, a week ago.\n. @pilot34 Sorry for the snappy answer. I do appreciate bug reports, and I do try to fix issues when they arise. If you check the release notes you will see that this issue was fixed a while ago, but I appreciate it's easy to miss that. For what it's worth, this bug was introduced by Apple in Xcode 4.4 and did not happen under Xcode 4.3, so I fixed it as soon as I could have - it wasn't a case of the previous release of the library not working with ARC under iOS 4 and me simply not bothering to test it or mention it in the docs. Unfortunately I have no way to notify users of bugs or updates.\n\n@Tibbs Thanks for the support, I appreciate it.\n. The issue is that the +(void)load method fires before the main thread has started, and whilst this wasn't a problem previously, as of Xcode 4.4 it seems that ARCLite (the library that implements ARC support on iOS4) isn't properly initialised until then. performSelectorOnMainThread delays the code from executing until the main thread has started, by which point ARC is working properly.\n. I see that you've closed the issue - did you figure out what the problem was?\n. Yes, that's correct. It will work once the app is live, but not prior to submission.\n\nIf you set [iRate sharedInstance].debug = YES; then you can test what the behaviour will be once live (remember to remove that again before you submit).\n. It's an interesting idea, but the only purpose I can think of would be for me to test that the library works correctly (which I can do by running it using a live app ID, as I do in the example projects). I don't see that an end user would get much benefit from it versus the existing debug mode option.\n\nThe valueForKey:inJSON method is purely to support iOS 4. I will eventually replace it with NSJSONSerialisation when I drop support for iOS 4, but there's no reason to do that now. I'm aware that it's a horrible hack, but I don't want to force people to use an arbitrary JSON library, and supporting all known JSON libraries (like AFNetworking does) requires a lot more, much nastier code.\n\nIf you do want to add a simulation mode for some reason, why not just use sample JSON data for simulation instead of a dictionary? Seems like it would make life easier.\n. Option one is a good idea, I'll look at adding it.\n\nOption two is already implemented. Just set promptAtLaunch to NO.\n. I understand that you'd like iRate to save this preference automatically (so if you set the disabled option, it would remain disabled even after you relaunch the app, until you set it to false again). I'll think about it, but my first instinct is that this is outside the scope of iRate itself.\n\nThis is very easy to implement yourself however. The simplest way is probably to add something like this to your AppDelegate:\n\n```\n- (BOOL)iRateShouldPromptForRating\n{\n    return [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] boolForKey:@\"RatingPromptEnabled\"];\n}\n```\n. I've added the option to stop prompting the user after they've rated the app, even if a new version is installed.\n. What is the benefit of this as opposed to putting either of the following in the AppDegelate:\n\n```\n+(void)initialize\n{\n    [iRate sharedInstance].promptAtLaunch = IRATE_AUTOLOAD_ENABLED;\n}\n```\n\nOr\n\n```\n- (BOOL)iRateShouldPromptForRating\n{\n    return IRATE_AUTOLOAD_ENABLED;\n}\n```\n\n?\n. Thanks. Now fixed.\n. OK, I figured out which bits I needed and I've included them in version 1.5.4. Thanks.\n. Nice idea. I'll include it in the next release. Thanks.\n. I've renamed the property to something a little clearer, but this feature is now included in version 1.5.4\n. Yep, well spotted.\n\nIt only happens if your deployment target is set to iOS6. It's harmless, but I'll fix it in the next release anyway.\n. This is now fixed in version 1.6\n. Yes, that should work. It should be sufficient to set [iRate sharedInstance].applicationBundleID to the bundle ID of your live app.\n\nUnfortunately by removing the actual IDs from your bug report it's a bit hard for me to follow exactly what the issue is. I take it that in the console when iRate reports that \"iRate found that the application bundle ID (com.domain.appID)\" the ID is the ID of your ad-hoc app, and not the ID you set?\n\nWhere in your code are you setting the [iRate sharedInstance].applicationBundleID? Is it possible that it's being set after iRate has already made the app store request?\n. Is your app actually live already?\n. Can you post the exact setup code that you're using, including the correct bundle/appIDs so I can try it and see if I can work out why it's not working?\n\nI can understand if you don't want to post them here (although it is public information anyway) so email it to support at charcoaldesign dot co dot uk if you prefer.\n. This works for me if I paste it into the iPhone Demo app included with iRate:\n\n```\n+ (void)initialize\n{\n\n#define TARGET_NAME_Doddle 1 //also works if I use TARGET_NAME_DoddlePro\n\n    [iRate sharedInstance].previewMode = YES; // also works if set to NO - make sure it's NO for release\n    //[iRate sharedInstance].promptAtLaunch = NO; // demo app doesn't work if this is NO\n    [iRate sharedInstance].onlyPromptIfLatestVersion = NO; // you should set this to YES for release\n    //[iRate sharedInstance].promptAgainForEachNewVersion = YES; // this is the default anyway\n    //[iRate sharedInstance].verboseLogging = NO; // this is the default for non-debug builds\n    [iRate sharedInstance].daysUntilPrompt = 1;\n    [iRate sharedInstance].usesUntilPrompt = 3;\n    [iRate sharedInstance].eventsUntilPrompt = 4;\n    [iRate sharedInstance].remindPeriod = 5.0;\n\n    NSString *bundleID = nil;\n    NSString *appTitle = nil;\n\n#if defined TARGET_NAME_Doddle\n\n    bundleID = @\"com.doddleme.Doddle\";\n    appTitle = @\"Doddle\";\n\n#elif defined TARGET_NAME_DoddlePro\n\n    appTitle = @\"DoddlePro\";\n    bundleID = @\"com.doddleme.DoddlePro\";\n\n#endif\n\n    [iRate sharedInstance].applicationName = appTitle; // used in default message\n    [iRate sharedInstance].applicationBundleID = bundleID; // if you set this you don't need to set appID\n    [iRate sharedInstance].message = nil; //this doesn't work - if you want to clear the message use @\"\"\n    [iRate sharedInstance].messageTitle = [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"Please Rate %@\", appTitle];\n    [iRate sharedInstance].cancelButtonLabel = @\"No, thanks\"; //this is the default anyway\n    [iRate sharedInstance].rateButtonLabel = @\"Yes\";\n    [iRate sharedInstance].remindButtonLabel = @\"Remind Me Later\"; //this is the default anyway\n\n}\n```\n\nI don't think I've made any significant changes from what you posted, except to remove redundant code (I've also put in some comments for code that you should look at more closely).\n\nDoes the code above work for you?\n. iRate normally gets the bundle ID from the plist. You only need to set it if you want something different from the plist (e.g. for an ad hoc build that uses a different bundle ID).\n. This is behaving as expected. From the documentation for the eventsUntilPrompt property:\n\n\"once the day threshold is reached, the prompt will appear if either the event threshold OR uses threshold is reached. This defaults to 10 events.\"\n\nSo if you are not using the usesUntilPrompt value, you should set it to INT_MAX instead of setting it to 1, then it won't factor into the equation.\n. Sorry, I didn't see your update. I've moved it to the bottom of your post so it's clearer for anyone else who is reading.\n. Thanks! It was actually professionally translated, but I guess you never know what you're getting.\n. Have you added a Localizable.strings file to your project and made sure that Portuguese is selected as a supported language in Project > Info?\n\nIf so, try doing a clean build from the Product menu - it may just be that you have a previously cached strings file from the old version.\n. It used to be the case that iRate would be localised to all supported languages even if your project was not, but this is not what most people would want. Is it really the case that you have no text in your app that needs to be localised apart from iRate?\n\nHere is a tutorial that includes screenshots of how to add new languages: http://www.aboveground.com/blog/xcode-4-4-and-localizable-strings-no-way-to-add-language\n\nNote that this is the Info tab under Project, not under Targets.\n. The reasoning was that it's a bit odd to have mixed content in an app. If the rest of the app is in English, one particular modal should not be displayed in Russian, or whatever.\n. It is true that iTunes will display all the languages you've added, but the idea is that you should only add support for the languages that you intend to localise your whole app for, and ignore the other ones that iRate supports.\n. I may be able to add it back as an option. I'll think about it.\n\nThe previous solution was a pretty nasty hack, requiring me to basically bypass the standard localisation mechanism, pre-compile strings into binary plists, etc. The new solution is much cleaner and more compatible with how Apple intends it to work.\n. OK, I have a solution that should work. Give me a little while.\n. OK, check out version 1.5.5. I think I've found a solution that should suit everyone.\n. FYI, I've renamed 1.5.5 to 1.6, but it's the same code, in case you were wondering.\n. Why would you want to build on Xcode < 4.5?\n. I suggest you revert to iRate 1.6 until you've upgraded your CI server. You can get iRate 1.6 from the tags page in github.\n. Sorry, I meant 1.5.3.\n. The App Store under iOS6 can be a little bit flakey. Can you paste the URL that iRate is attempting to open and I'll see if it looks correct (it would help if you don't obfuscate your app ID - it's public information anyway).\n. It seems Apple changed the format of the URL slightly. That was nice of them.\n\nI've fixed it in 1.6.2.\n. Sorry for not responding earlier - I now have so many projects it's hard to keep track of them all!\n\nThis seems like a good feature suggestion, although if it can't take you directly to the ratings page then it should probably be optional. I'll investigate.\n. That's a clever solution, but it would mean localising that extra text, which at this point would be a nightmare. I think it's fine as it is, if people can't find the review tab when it's right in front of them then you probably don't want them writing a review :-)\n\nAnyway, this feature is now included in version 1.7.\n. Yes, remind period can only be set in terms of days.\n\nYou can implement this easily enough using the delegate by setting usesCount back to zero after they ask to be reminded.\n. The error is because iRate now requires the StoreKit framework to be included in your project.\n. The deprecation warning is fixed in 1.7.1\n. I've incorporated @nonamelive's fix into 1.7.2\n. So you're saying that [SKStoreProductViewController class] returns a non-nil object on iOS5 if you build an app using XCode 4.6 DP3?\n\nThat's very strange. It sounds like a bug in XCode, but it's worrying nonetheless. Can you log the value of [SKStoreProductViewController class] and see what it says?\n. I haven't changed anything. If it's not happening now then it's presumably because Apple fixed something.\n. When I say zero config, I mean zero :-)\n. It sounds like your iRate.m file hasn't been added to your app target for some reason. In the right hand sidebar, check the correct target is checked for that file.\n. You need to add the StoreKit framework (it's mentioned in the 1.5 README under installation instructions).\n. Thanks for the tip. I'll take it under advisement.\n. Upon further reflection, you were right. But you're still a ... challenging individual.\n. Comments are closed for this post.\n. It's not really a good idea to subclass iRate. This might work, but only by coincidence. iRate loads itself by calling the sharedInstance method automatically. If you call sharedInstance on your subclass before iRate has loaded it will override the static variable and so the instance that gets created will be your class, but if iRate loads before you call sharedInstance on your subclass then your subclass's sharedInstance method will return the iRate instance that's already been created.\n\nBasically, subclassing singletons is a bad idea.\n\nWhat is it you are trying to do with your subclass? Can it be done using the iRate delegate instead?\n. Yeah, I guessed that's why it was working, but it's not something you want rely on. I might change the way loading works in a future release and end up swapping the order.\n\nThe shouldPromptForRating method is exposed so that you can _call_ it from your own code.\n. Heh. If you look at the codebase for 1.6.2 and earlier, I already had this exact feature.\n\nI made a policy decision in 1.7 to remove support for manual memory management, for the following reasons:\n\n1) It's very easy to selectively enable ARC for a single file in a non-ARC project (see README).\n2) I don't want to encourage or endorse the use of manual memory management - I think it's crazy.\n. Hi Alberto,\n\nAs per my first point, you can use iRate in a project that does not use ARC by setting the -fobjc-arc flag on the iRate.m file without needing to upgrade your project to ARC.\n\nIf you are including iRate inside a library then if you apply the -fobject-arc flag the iRate.m within the library project, end users need not be aware of it at all.\n. Sorry, it's not possible as far as I know. I haven't personally found that it's an issue, even though my game is played by kids quite a bit. Out of hundreds of reviews I've only had a handful of 1 or 2 star reviews, and only one or two where the text was incongruous (i.e. they said they loved it but rated it 1 star).\n. I'm not sure I fully understand the question.\n\nIf you want to show iRate after a specific number of custom-defined events then you can do that by calling the logEvent method, but iRate doesn't let you specify multiple types of event.\n\nIf you need to do that you can do it by keeping track of the events yourself and then returning YES or NO in the iRate shouldPromptForRating delegate method if your custom event threshold has been reached, or by just bypassing iRate's logic entirely and calling promptForRating when you determine that you need to.\n. iRate doesn't have any text input code, it just calls the StoreKit API to show the rating panel. If the keyboard isn't appearing in the in-app rating view then that's an Apple bug and you should file a radar with them.\n\nThat said, as a workaround you can disable in-app-ratings by setting disaplyAppUsingStorekitifAvailable = NO, then it will take people to the app store instead.\n. @stuffmc - thanks, this has been fixed.\n\n@fredericcormier sorry, are you saying it _should_ have the \"le\", or that that is wrong? (apologies but the copy has been updated since and I'm not sure which version you commented on).\n. Thanks. This is fixed in latest beta.\n. That's weird. Is it happening on the device or only the simulator?\n\nI don't really have any control over the display of the StoreKit modal, so if it's not working correctly there's not much you can do except disable the StoreKit feature.\n. 1) Can you be more specific about the display issue?\n2) What iOS version are you running?\n3) What happens when you run the iPhone example included with the iRate library in your iPad?\n. I think someone else reported a similar issue, but they said it was ok on the device. Must've just been an xcode bug. \n. Sorry, I've not decided if I want to add this feature or not. I can see that it's potentially useful, but it would open the flood gate to basically duplicating all of iRate's fir notification scheduling functionality for reminders as well, and that doesn't seem reasonable. I'm therefore considering whether a different approach would be better, but as yet can't think of one.\n. I use a global gitignore file to avoid adding noise to my individual libraries, so no need for this.\n. I would encourage them to also use global .gitignore files.\n. By enabling preview mode you are telling iRate to pop up every time the app opens. Preview mode is only supposed to be used for debugging purposes.\n\nAlso, you shouldn't perform configuration in your button action because it's misleading. iRate is a singleton, so any configuration you perform has a global effect. Do all your configuration in the initialize method.\n. Unfortunately SKStoreKit doesn't have a method to go directly to the reviews page. If you want to use the direct link you can disable storeKit and iRate will launch the App Store instead.\n. Yes, I'll do that \u2013 it was an oversight.\n. Thanks, I'll merge it now.\n. This makes sense logically, but I don't love the increasing clutter in the public interface caused by these customisation methods. I'll think about this for a while. Perhaps there's an alternative approach.\n. The former, unfortunately. You can disable StoreKit if you prefer and it will open the correct tab in the App Store app instead.\n. Are you using the latest version? Can you post a stack trace, and if possible use breakpoints to identify the line where it happens?\n. Those are delegate methods - you don't override them, you define them in your app delegate.\n\nBut you don't need to do that to disable StoreKit - you just set \n\n```\n[iRate sharedInstance].displayAppUsingStorekitIfAvailable = NO;\n```\n\nIn your app delegate.\n. Can you give an example of a scenario where this would be necessary?\n. This is no longer relevant since Apple now no longer allows apps to be rated using the in-app store page\n. iRate already passes -Wall - what settings are you using? \n. You're preaching to the choir with respect to warnings, but if you turn on an arbitrary set of warnings then any code will fail at least some of them. I test against -Wall, which represents the complete set of recommended clang warnings (recommended because they don't generate a lot of false positives, as opposed to, say -Wextra, or -Weverything).\n\nUnless you have an argument and/or supporting evidence for why the specific warning settings you have chosen to enable  in your project are important, I'm not sure why I should worry about them.\n\nIt's not that I don't consider warnings important in general, it's just that I prefer to follow a consistent set of coding standards across all of my projects, based on well-defined criteria, and currently I code against -Wall.\n. Some context for why I use -Wall:\n\nhttp://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/122608/clang-warning-flags-for-objective-c-development\n. I would use -Wextra, but it flags up stuff like unused arguments in delegate methods, which makes it palpably useless. It also doesn't catch loss-of-precision afaik.\n\nI don't have an opinion on loss of precision particularly. Which flag enables it? Maybe I'll give it a try as an addition to -Wall.\n\nAs to your immediate problem, I suggest maybe building iRate as a static lib, or using CocoaPods. That way you can use it in your project without incurring warnings or having to maintain a fork with your fixes\n. As of version 1.8 beta, iRate is now fully -Wextra compliant. That will probably still have warnings for the settings yo use however.\n. Hi Mark,\n\nYou've set promptAtLaunch to NO, meaning that iRate won't display a prompt unless you specifically tell it to somewhere in your code.\n\nJust remove that setting and it should work fine.\n\nNick\n\nOn 9 May 2013, at 21:08, Mark Paul Keefe notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Hi Nick,\n> \n> I have no idea what I'm doing wrong, but for the life of me, I have never had iRate work except in preview mode.

Hi Mark,\n\nIf you do that it will always prompt, regardless of the settings you've specified, or whether there is a network connection.\n\nYou probably want to use:\n\nif ([[iRate sharedInstance] shouldPromptForRating])\n{\n    [[iRate sharedInstance] promptIfNetworkAvailable];\n}\n\nNick\n. Yes. If the prompt is already visible on screen then it won't display another prompt, and if the user dismisses the prompt then shouldPromptForRating should return NO until the rules are re-satisfied.\n. Which OS version is this on? In-app reviews are only supported on iOS6+\n. Curious. I don't control the experience inside the StoreKit window though. Is this happening on a live app in the store, or just in testing mode? It may be because you haven't bought the app, etc.\n. Does this happen for you in the sample app included with iRate? If not, what happens if you change the bundle ID to match your app?\n. I think this may be a change in iOS 6.1.3. It's not something that I can control.\n. Yes. I may remove the option since it seems that it's no longer useful.\n. As of iOS 7 it does not seem to be possible to go direct to review page anymore. StoreKit is now disabled by default, but you can re-enabled it if you want.\n. Yes, this is a feature not a bug. It's actually documented in the README file in the openRatingsPageImAppStore method description.\n. See the documentation for that method.\n. That's a good idea actually. I can do that.\n. Just an update - I've partially implemented this, in that the bundleID is saved in settings. I've not implemented prefetching of the bundle ID on first launch though.\n. This is now fully implemented in 1.8.1\n. This may be a silly question, but is your app live yet?\n. OK, @andy380743909, your app worked with iRate when I tried it (the bundle ID is com.livestation.lualuaar, correct?) - if it's not working for you, can you check the console log (you may need to enable verbose logging) and paste it here?\n\n@therauli iRate will work fine with your app once it is in the store, but it won't work until it's live. You can fix that by setting the app ID explicitly, but that isn't necessary. Enable preview mode if you'd like to see what it will look like before you submit.\n. Make sure you are using the latest version of iRate by the way - Apple changed the URLs for iOS 6.1, so if you have a version that's a few months old, that may be why it doesn't work.\n. You don't need to set the appstore ID manually - iRate gets your bundle ID from the info.plist automatically. To test it, set previewMode = YES.\n. To actually verify that the event-based logic you've implemented works, the simplest way is to set the bundle ID in your plist to another app that's already on the store (you can use the rainbowblocks bundle I included in the example) and then change the date on the device or simulator to however many days in the future your logic is set to trigger.\n. iRate checks the iTunes JSON feed, so it won't work until the app is actually live. If it gets as far as showing that error though, everything is working fine.\n. You should not build apps using SDK version 5 - apple won't accept them. If you wish to support iOS 5, build using SDK 6 but set the minimum deployment target to iOS 5.\n. Detection of the iOS version has to be done at runtime, it an't be done at compile time. iRate will correctly detect that it is running on iOS 5 and disable the StoreKit functionality, but it has to be built using SDK 6 or the compiler won't recognise the StoreKit symbols.\n. Thanks. I've incorporate these fixes into the latest beta.\n. Yeah, I'll keep an eye on it, but as @ddaddy says, it makes sense to wait for GM before changing anything.\n. Are you seeing anything in the logs?\n. That sounds like it's unrelated to iOS 7. Did it work for you on iOS 6?\n. Yeah, I've made the same change in the later beta. It's not ideal because it doesn't take you to the actual ratings page, but it's better than nothing.\n. Yes. Still doesn't work.\n\nI've pushed a new beta that just points to the app page on iOS7 for now.\n\nHopefully they'll either fix it by the final release, or an alternative link will present itself.\n\nNick\n. Fixed in 1.8 beta 2\n. You drag and drop the iRate class (iRate.h + iRate.m).  that comes with the library into your project. You do not need to create any classes or write any code. You do need to add the StoreKit framework as well though (google how to add built in frameworks in Xcode, if you're not sure).\n. CocoaPods is a useful tool, but it doesn't relate directly to your problem. From the sounds of it, you've probably just made a simple error when importing the iRate files or the framework.\n\nTrying to use pods at this point will probably cause more confusion. Trying to run before you can walk, so to speak.\n. What were the compile errors you were getting? Can you paste the console output into your question?\n. Can you add the files back in, then zip up your project (with errors) and email it to support at charcoal design dot co dot uk. I'll take a look.\n. I'm really sorry to hear that - it must be a new rule. StoreKit isn't critical to iRate's functionality. I'll release a patch ASAP.\n. I've pushed version 1.8 beta that disabled StoreKit by default, and no longer requires that you link against the framework.\n. Fixed in 1.8 beta 4\n. Don't worry, it's not a private API. It's just that to get the root view controller, iRate tries various checks including looking to see if your AppDelegate has a property called viewController. If it doesn't, you get this warning. I'll update iRate with a fix tonight, but if you can't wait then it's safe to either remove that code or ignore the warning.\n. This is fixed in beta 3\n. Yep - this is fixed in the latest beta.\n. Soon, I expect. Once I'm confident that it's doesn't have any issues.\n\nIf you need to launch now I'd advise just linking it straight into your app.\n. The property was removed because it existed only in case of possible conflicts with future iOS versions - I was under the impression it worked fine for all cases on iOS 6. I'll see if I can tweak its behaviour to work correctly in your case. \n. OK, this is fixed in beta 6\n. I actually quite like this idea, but it is regarded as a sleazy trick, apparently:\n\nhttp://www.zumsteg.net/2013/12/13/how-skimming-reviews-makes-apps-twice-as-slimy/\n. I've already added support for the new format in the 1.8 beta. Are you having problems with the latest version?\n. I don't think it's explicitly documented, but it will continue to be called every time the app is opened until the user explicitly declines it.\n\nYou can also trigger it manually whenever you want by saying if(shouldPromptForRating) promptForRating.\n. Yep.\n. I normally use a common base class for all my controllers. Makes it easy to do something like that.\n. No, there's no way to tell if the user rated the app.\n. I'm actually not sure what the correct solution is here. I've tried to replicate the iOS lookup behaviour in iRate, and I assumed that iOS would use the next item in your language list if it didn't find the first, but maybe it should just default straight to US english instead?\n. To be clear though - this definitely doesn't affect all (or even most users) as I'm pretty sure that anyone who hasn't been swapping languages for testing purposes will have US english as the second item in their languages list, not French (I do).\n. Adding an en-GB localisation is clearly the simplest fix. Just not sure if it's the correct one.\n. This is fixed in 1.8.1\n. That is true, but it was unnecessary in this case because iRate is a singleton.\n\nCan you give an example of how this causes a problem in other language bindings? (I assume you mean something like RubyMotion or Xamarin, but I'm not very familiar with these tools).\n. You don't need to define appStoreIS to test an app that isn't on the store. Preview mode will let you test and it will pick up the ID automatically when the app is released.\n. Very true. I'll investigate what's going on there.\n. Fixed in 1.8.1\n. Yes, Apple seem to have disabled the button on iOS 7. I suggest you don't use that feature (I'll probably remove it in the next version unless Apple decide to reinstate support for it).\n. I've removed Storekit support in 1.8.1 as I don't think Apple are going to put this feature back :-(\n. I'm not sure. It didn't work for me when I tried it previously, but maybe they changed their minds again.\n. Is the bundle ID of the version you are testing the same as the bundle ID of the live version?\n. Actually, what method are you using to open the App Store from your button? iRate looks up the app ID automatically when it's running in the default mode (rating after a specific number of uses), but if you implement your own button you need to trigger that lookup manually, or set the app ID explicitly.\n. The method you should use for a \"rate this app\" button is:\n\n```\n- (void)promptIfNetworkAvailable;\n```\n\nIf you call\n\n```\n- (void)promptForRating;\n```\n\nInstead, it will only work if you've set the appStoreID explicitly (which normally isn't necessary).\n. I see the problem. It's not your fault, maybe I need to be clearer in the documentation.\n\nCurrently though, to use this method, you need to set the [iRate sharedInstance].appStoreID explicitly. You can get your appStoreID from your iTunes connect page (or it's just the numeric part of the iTunes URL for your app).\n\nI'll see if I can make this work more intuitively in the next release.\n. The better way is to do this, but it's bit more complex:\n\n```\n@implementation MyViewController\n\n- (IBAction)promptForRating:(id)sender;\n{\n    //perform manual check\n    [iRate sharedInstance].delegate = (id<iRateDelegate>)self;\n    [[iRate sharedInstance] promptIfNetworkAvailable];\n\n    //you might want to disable the button and show a spinner here\n}\n\n- (void)iRateCouldNotConnectToAppStore:(NSError *)error\n{\n    //restore delegate\n    [iRate sharedInstance].delegate = (id<iRateDelegate>)[UIApplication sharedApplication].delegate;\n\n    //hide spinner and display error\n}\n\n- (BOOL)iRateShouldPromptForRating\n{\n    //don't show prompt, just open app store\n    [[iRate sharedInstance] openRatingsPageInAppStore];\n\n    //restore delegate\n    [iRate sharedInstance].delegate = (id<iRateDelegate>)[UIApplication sharedApplication].delegate;\n\n    //hide spinner\n\n    return NO;\n}\n\n@end\n```\n. That's fine. The rating button should still work OK.\n\nThis approach disables the automatic rating popup though - it will only let you rate by pressing the button.\n. To be clear, it's an either/or thing. Either set the numeric appStoreID, or use the code I specified. You don't need to do both.\n. OK, I've updated the code sample above so it won't stop the normal notification from working.\n\nThe rating won't work in the simulator because there's no App Store app for it to open. It should work fine if you run it on a device.\n. It shouldn't be, unless your app isn't live. Are you sure you're using the latest version? What error did you get?\n. Sorry about that, but in version 1.8, the documentation did state that the openRatingsPageInAppStore method required the ID - it was only the automatic rating prompt that did not.\n\nAs of the latest version, that method does not require it either.\n. Oops. Well spotted. Thanks!\n. I've enabled -Weverything in the warning settings and I'm still not seeing the issues you mention. Any idea what compiler settings you might be using to generate these?\n. I've fixed these in 1.8.3.\n. iRate runs automatically, you don't need to add any code to your app to make it run.\n\nTo disable iRate, either add [iRate sharedInstance].promptAtLaunch = NO; to your app delegate initialize method, or just remove the iRate pod from your project.\n. +(void)load;\n. This method has been removed in the latest version of iRate anyway because iOS7 no longer allows you to rate apps via the StoreKit modal.\n. Way ahead of you.\n\nhttps://github.com/nicklockwood/iRate/blob/master/RELEASE%20NOTES.md\n. I understand this point of view, but I honestly can't imagine that the amount of users who write multiple reviews for the same app is worth the negative PR of having this feature.\n\nIn retrospect I wish that I had implemented a (less radical) reduction in this functionality earlier so that things didn't come to the extreme that they did, but ultimately it's not worth the damage to my reputation to put this back in, so I won't.\n\nIt's possible (though not especially easy) to implement this yourself using iRate's delegate system, or you could fork the library and put it back, but I'd urge you to reconsider doing so, at least until you've shipped a few updates and verified that the lack of this feature is actually having a negative impact on the reviews you are receiving.\n. I'll think about it.\n. This is implemented in version 1.10.\n. This seems more like an issue with how the iOS localisation system works than something that should be fixed in iRate. \n\nYou can use the Slovenian strings when the device is in English by copying the Slovenian iRate strings into your apps en localisable.strings file. Then they'll override the en strings in the iRate bundle.\n. Fixed in 1.9.1.\n. Wow, that's a lot of locales. Thanks!\n. Can you check which version of iRate you are using? (it's in the header file)\n. OK, well I can't reproduce this. If you have more info or steps to reproduce, please reopen.\n. I haven't forgotten about it, but since it's not fixing any bugs or adding any critical new features, and I don't want to risk introducing bugs by merging it without testing it properly, I'd prefer to wait and include it in the next planned release, which may be a little while away.\n. Done. But can you clarify what you mean by a dev ID that's not public?\n. No, you would have to implement a completely custom alert, which you can do using the delegate.\n. Sorry, closed by accident!\n. If you have verbose logging enabled, you should be able to see exactly why it isn't showing from the logs. You can extract these from the settings on the device in a production build.\n\nthe promptIfNetworkAvailable method should only work after app has launched, so that's normal.\n. Makes sure [iRate sharedInstance].verboseLogging = YES, then have a look at what iRate logs to the console - it should give detailed feedback about why it has or hasn't prompted for feedback.\n. Actually sorry, I take that back. This makes testing certain custom functionality more difficult. E.g. the advanced Mac example project included with the library.\n. I've added a comment to this effect in the previewMode documentation.\n. Cool, I'll check it out. Thanks!\n. This is implemented in version 1.10\n. That's because it's a calculated property. If you set\n\ndeclinedThisVersion = NO;\n\nIt will have the effect of resetting declinedAnyVersion to NO as well (which in retrospect is a bit weird, but never mind).\n. Which version did you ship in production? I found a bug in 1.10 that would account for this, but it was only released a couple of days ago.\n. No problem. Sorry about that!\n. I've added this fix to 1.10.1\n. This is fixed in 1.10.1\n. If firstUsed was nil (due to the user having installed an app running version iRate 1.10, and not previously having used an earlier version) then there is no possible way to know when the app was actually first used, so assuming that the first use date is now is the best we can do.\n. You're right that this is a bug, but wrong about the effect. The iRateLastVersionUsedKey isn't used in the onlyPromptIfLatestVersion check.\n\nThe effect of the bug is that if you update the app, every time it opens it will move the self.firstUsed date forward by one day, with the effect that it will never display the rating prompt, regardless of the settings.\n. OK, I think this is fixed in 1.10.2. Let me know if you see any other issues.\n. Hi, you're partly right. Th problem with your patch was that you never reset the logic once the app is updated, which meant that the promptForNewVersionIfUserRated would always prompt the day after they install the new version, which isn't what I wanted.\n\nMy fix didn't work correctly, but that's what it was trying to achieve.\n\nI believe I've now implemented this correctly. To be honest I need some unit tests around this because it's way too complex to test manually, but it's not really structured in a way that makes it easy to automate.\n\nAnyway, to address a couple of your points:\n\n3) Why do you use +1 in the if condition? I don't quite understand. The if should be the same like the one checking whether it's time to rate now. If it's not time to rate now, no problem.\n\nIf the user had installed the app daysUntilPrompt -  1 second ago, then your logic wouldn't reset the time, so potentially they might still be notified the same day (e.g. if the closed and reopened the app and the time was now daysUntilPrompt + a few seconds). By subtracting an extra day, I avoid that issue.\n\n5) Just one minor thing I have noticed is that since you update defaults in any case now, [defaults synchronize] should be moved out of the else block behind it. But this really isn't a big problem - you could actually skip the synchronize calls completely as iOS calls synchronize for you automatically (it's useful just in the case the app crashes before).\n\nThe firstUsed setter method calls synchronise automatically, so this is not actually a bug.\n. Ha ha, whoops. I thought I'd fixed that.\n. Er, yes, you're right about the ratedVersion:lastUsedVersion thing too. Man, I am not on my game today.\n. Yeah. Let's not do this again :-)\n. Does your app only support portrait? Have you implemented any code for - (BOOL)shouldAutorotate, etc?\n. This isn't actually a bug, but a design decision. Arguably it was a bad decision, but applying this fix as it stands actually breaks the default functionality, since usesUntilPrompt defaults to 10, so any app that doesn't log any events will never present the notification.\n\nIf you want to prevent notifications unless both use count AND event count have been reached, you can add this additional check using the iRate delegate.\n. I'll leave this open for now - I may consider changing this behaviour at some point but it will need some other changes to be made as well.\n. I have no objection in principle, but it seems a little redundant since you can just broadcasts a notification yourself from the app delegate if needed.\n. No problem. Sorry for the oversight.\n. The best option is to disable iRate in the `+initialize` method using\n\n```\n[Shades sharedInstance].promptAtLaunch = NO;\n```\n\nThen, once you have downloaded your configuration file and configured shades, call\n\n```\nif ([Shades sharedInstance].shouldPromptForRating)\n{\n    [[Shades sharedInstance] promptIfNetworkAvailable];\n}\n```\n\n(Or just wait until the next time the app launches, and don't disable Shades if the config file has already been downloaded).\n. Well spotted - I totally agree.\n. Thanks!\n. This is included in 1.11.\n. Goog to know - thanks!\n. Looks good. I've merged it into 1.11\n. That isn't a bug, that's telling you that iRate is working correctly but that it can't open the ratings page on the simulator because it doesn't exist (you have to test on a device).\n. DEBUG is a standard macro set by Apple for debug builds. You may have removed it or not set it in your project, but that shouldn't cause any problems.\n. Which is...?\n. I don't understand the question.\n. Oh, I see. Will you be putting your app in the store eventually?\n. Just put the library in your program and it will work automatically when you submit to the app store.\n. These two issues are unrelated.\n\nThe Cocoa.h not found bug was due to the `#import <TargetConditionals.h>` being missing from iRate.h - I've fixed that for the next release.\n\nThe country detection is working correctly for me, but it is based on the locale of your system. If your device (or the simulator) is set to US locale then it will use that - I expect that's why it wasn't working correctly for you.\n\nIf you want to hard-code the locale however, you can do so by putting the following in your App Delegate - there's no need to modify the iRate library:\n\n```\n+ (void)initialize\n{\n    [iRate sharedInstance].appStoreCountry = @\"gb\";\n}\n```\n. Have you looked at the iPhone Custom UI Demo included with the example projects?\n. Hmm. This is problematic, but UIAlertView is deprecated, so not supporting UIAlertController isn't really a long-term solution. I guess I can add an option to not use UIAlertController for now, but at some point it will probably become mandatory.\n. OK, I've added a property \"useUIAlertControllerIfAvailable\", and set it to NO by default.\n. I can imagine this will cause some pain in future, but it should solve the problem for now.\n. Sorry about that. It was a bug in 1.11 that was fixed in 1.11.2. The only solution is to upgrade to latest and re-release the app.\n. It should work AFAIK, but you can test it yourself by setting previewMode = YES (remember to set it back to NO before release)\n. The code is correct. It used to be the current version but the behaviour has since changed and the documentation is now incorrect.\n. Hmm, I thought that I was registering \"No, Thanks\" as the cancel button, so it's curious that it would behave differently from other apps. I'll take a look.\n. In stacked layout, the cancel button always appears at the bottom, regardless of whether you add it first. Seems odd that side-by-side layout works differently.\n\n(Not doubting you, just confused by the inconsistency)\n. If your [UIApplication sharedApplication].delegate doesn't have a window property, that means it doesn'f conform to UIApplicationDelegat protocol, which sounds like a pretty serious bug in your app. I'm not too familiar with what consitutes normal for a cocos2D app though.\n. Yes, it's possible by using the delegate. But have you looked at my iPrompt and iNotify libraries? They might be better suited for what you're trying to do.\n. If you add this to your app delegate, iRate will never prompt automatically:\n\n```\n+ (void)initialize\n{\n    [iRate sharedInstance].promptAtLaunch = NO;\n}\n```\n. Well, you know what they say: naming things is the hardest problem in computer science \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af \n. Based on the stack trace, the crash is related to some GPU/OpenGL library, not part of iRate. Some Googling suggests that it's part of Apple's MapView implementation?\n\nI suspect what it happening is that iRate is appearing in front of your MapView or OpenGL-based view, and that view is crashing due to a bug. Perhaps it doesn't like being paused or put into the background?\n\nThe best way to replicate it is probably to try showing an alert at random times after startup in your app and seeing what happens and/or to report this bug to Apple and see what they say (although they'll probably need a simple project that reproduces the issue to be able to do anything - as would I)\n. If you can't find or reproduce the problem, your best option is probably to disable the automatic display of iRate on launch by adding this to AppDelegate\n\n```\n- (void)initialize {\n    [iRate sharedInstance].promptAtLaunch  = NO;\n}\n```\n\nThen, when you get to a safe point in the app, call\n\n```\n[[iRate sharedInstance] promptIfAllCriteriaMet];\n```\n\nWhich will show the rating dialog, but only if all the criteria you've set have been met (number of days installed, etc).\n. Just set [iRate sharedInstance].promptAtLaunch = NO; in AppDelegate +initialize method, then add a button which calls [iRate sharedInstance] promptIfNetworkAvailable];\n. AFAIK that isn't possible with a standard alert. You can build your own alert and tell irate to use it though, by using the delegate functions.\n. Gah, more despicable app review bullshit. Try appealing it, since it's clearly not in violation - that check is only there so developers using iRate aren't confused when they try to run in on a simulator.\n\nMeanwhile, I'll add a fix to remove that code and replace it with `#if TARGET_IPHONE_SIMULATOR` which will do the same job.\n. OK, thanks!\n. There's no way to know, unfortunately.\n. They are used by the macOS target. That code is compiled out on iOS using #ifdef statements.. I have another library called iVersion that does exactly what you're asking for. You can use it together with iRate in the same project.\n. I use `+load` to support zero config (no need to reference iRate in code - it just works).\r\n\r\nIf you want to disable iRate with a feature flag, you can do so by setting `[iRate sharedInstance].promptAtLaunch = NO;` in your app delegate.. I'd guess this is fixed now? I don't use Carthage though, so please confirm.\n. Thanks for bringing this to my attention. Fixed in 1.11.6\n. Hi Seb,\n\nMake sure that the iRate.bundle has been included in your project, and that it is included in your app target.\n\nIf it is, try looking inside the app bundle of your built app and verify that the iRate.bundle is in there.\n. @iLandes SwiftyiRate appears to be an uncredited copy of iRate. I have nothing to do with that project, and I'd encourage you to use this one instead, as I cannot vouch for the other one.. As far as I know, there are no issues.. Should be fixed in 1.11.7. Thanks!. iRate sets the bundle ID automatically using\r\n\r\n    [[NSBundle mainBundle] bundleIdentifier]\r\n\r\nWhich is equivalent to the code you pasted. You only need to set it manually yourself if you want to override it for some reason.. If you ask for a rating after the 3 requests, nothing will happen. If you want to have \"request review\" button in the app, you should not use SKStoreReviewController (and iRate doesn't, if you call the promptForRating method manually).. Fixed in 1.12. Implemented in 1.12. Well, iRate now uses the official API on iOS 10.3 and above, so it should be OK.. Yes, this is a bug. It sounds like *not* using SKStoreReviewControllerIfAvailable may be prohibited on iOS 11 anyway, so I may just remove the option.. AFAIK, Apple is now rejecting apps that don't use SKStoreReviewControllerIfAvailable, so this seems like a low priority to fix.. You shouldn't need to call ` [[iRate sharedInstance] promptForRating];` at all. It will automatically display the prompt once all criteria are met. The `promptForRating` method is only needed if you want to have a \"rate now\" button in your settings or something.. If you use `-[[iRate sharedInstance] logEvent: YES]` the prompt will show immediately after you've called it`eventsUntilPrompt` times, provided that the other criteria have also been met.. It's intentional. Apple says that you should never show SKStoreReviewController using a user-facing button because it's not guaranteed to appear.. Yes, it's because initialize is only called the first time you reference the class, and I want it to be executed even if you don't have any references to iRate in your code (zero-config mode).. I have no control over that dialog, but it makes sense that Apple would disable the button in debug builds, or in cases where you aren't permitted to submit a review (e.g. Because you haven't bought the app, or it's not been released yet). Is this using the latest version of iRate? The URL changed recently.. @zapjonny you can override the URL without forking iRate by adding this to your setup code:\r\n\r\n     [iRate sharedInstance].ratingsURL = ...\r\n\r\n. That's not really related functionality. I already have another lib called iVersion for that purpose.. Did you look in the console logs in Xcode? iRate should tell you why it didn't appear.\r\n\r\nYou might need to set `iRate.sharedInstance().verboseLogging = true` though.. SKStoreReviewController implements its own throttling, so it won't keep prompting aftet the user rates the app.. I'm not sure how that's measured. I'm assuming that a) it won't prompt the user to rate a version they've already rated, and b) a request to rate that doesn't display anything won't count against the 3 prompt limit.\r\n\r\nAFAIK, there's no way to detect whether the user actually rated the app, which is why I don't set the ratedThisVersion flag..

Hi Nick,\n\nThanks for looking into this but you're correct to leave it as it is, and the documentation is correct. I was confused by the double negative, sorry about that! I do think that i will hack my copy tho to be OR instead of AND because for my purposes it makes more sense.\n\nThanks again,\nC\n. That logic is failing for me because the use count is being met but the events count isn't and it is _NOT_ returning no . The implication it seems to me is that both conditions must be met, and if one is met, but the other isn't, then it will not return NO (sorry about that double negative. My situation:\n\n```\nirate.usesUntilPrompt = 3;\nirate.eventsUntilPrompt = 16;\n```\n\nI'll get 3 uses, and 3 events:\n\nif (3 < 3 /\\* false _/ && 3 < 16 /_true*))\n{\n// False and true do not equal true, so this will not occur, but I want it to. I do not want to show the prompt just yet.\n}\n\nI'm rushing out the door to get my wisdom teeth removed, so I hope I got this right.

It might just be worth putting it in the readme that it won't work with non-live app id's.\nI'm sure I do this with every app I make. I test with debug mode, then before submitting I want to test in real time, but it obviously doesn't work because it must check that the app ID actually exists.\n. Wow, so your saying it doesn't even need instantiating?\nI always make sure I but at least 1 config line just to make sure it loaded.\n.

Thanks for the update.\nI've added this for now:\nif ([[[UIDevice currentDevice] systemVersion] floatValue] >= 6.0) {\n        [iRate sharedInstance].ratingsURL = [NSURL URLWithString:@\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/APPNAME/idAPPID?mt=8\"];\n    }\n. Thanks. I did log the URL calls on my router and got the URL called when clicking the App Store review page, however it didn't work as a direct link.\n. Someone today on Twitter mentioned that the review links are now working again on iOS6. I shall test this shortly and let you know.\n. Yes. The original links now work in iOS 6 :-)\n. It seems iRateCouldNotConnectToAppStore is being fired.\nWhat other reasons would trigger that to fire?\n\nI have changed the app ID with an app that is live on the app store.\nDoes it detect that it is a different app id?\n. Never mind. I'm having a bad day.\nThe error is that Bundle ID doesn't match App ID. Obviously because the app isn't live yet it won't be able to match them.\n. It might just be worth putting it in the readme that it won't work with non-live app id's.\nI'm sure I do this with every app I make. I test with debug mode, then before submitting I want to test in real time, but it obviously doesn't work because it must check that the app ID actually exists.\n. Wow, so your saying it doesn't even need instantiating?\nI always make sure I but at least 1 config line just to make sure it loaded.\n. Thanks, thats a new one for me.\nI'll have a play with that when I get time.\n. Looks like you dont have all the necessary files linked properly.\nThe easiest way is delete it from your project, then re-add it but make sure you tick the box in \"Add to target\"\n. Sorry, false alarm. It seems it's just in the simulator.\nIt works fine on device.\n. I remember this happening with iOS 6 beta's and turned out fine in GM. So i'd suggest maybe waiting until iOS 7 final is released before removing or changing anything.\n. Did anyone test with yesterdays new GM build?\n. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc would like this too, to automatically default to the new behaviour when using 10.3. ",

I'm doing all iRate customization in the app delegates' initialize method, as advised. I'm thinking I probably won't need to do any of this in the production build; I'm just trying to determine whether that's true or not. \n\nI didn't try using just the applicationID or the applicationBundleID; perhaps that would make a difference? Like I said, right now, using just the url works as expected. I'll try more permutations and get back to you with results. \n\nAlso, does the previewMode flag impact any of this? If so, how?

Hi Nick,\n\nThe debug output was showing me the correct bundle and app id's, and the url it reports in the first debug line works if I run it in safari; I get the expected json back, etc. Confusing as to why it would then fail. \n\nYes, apps are in the app store.\n\nI did some more testing, and was eventually able to get it working by deriving the url, and setting that on the shared instance, and then NOT setting either the appID or the applicationBundleID. I'm doing all iRate customization in the app delegates' initialize method, as advised. I'm thinking I probably won't need to do any of this in the production build; I'm just trying to determine whether that's true or not. \n\nI didn't try using just the applicationID or the applicationBundleID; perhaps that would make a difference? Like I said, right now, using just the url works as expected. I'll try more permutations and get back to you with results. \n\nAlso, does the previewMode flag impact any of this? If so, how? It doesn't seem to using just the url; the only thing it does seem to affect is the count tracking; it'll present the prompt always, etc. \n\nThanks for getting back so quick.

Thank you for your help.\n\nYes i would like to localize my project, but not now, and i certainly wouldn't be able to localize it now to the many languages iRate supports. I think it's a bit of a hassle that iRate depends on that, but that's just my opinion.\n. And i think, but i'm not sure, that iTunes will show to users that my project is localized to all those languages even though it's not, it's just iRate. But i'm not sure.\n\nI don't know, i'm thinking about keeping locally the old implementation.\n. Really? I don't think it's odd at all. But maybe i'm wrong, i'll think about it for while.\n\nFor me it's like: there's the app, and there's iRate. As if iRate was a separate thing, almost like a native iOS dialog. The app can be english-only, but iOS is localized, and that's how iRate presents itself. It even looks like a native dialog.\n\nAnd between connecting with the users in their own native language -- despite the app's english-only --, and being consistent about the language used, i think connecting with the users is more important.\n. I agree the old solution is more hack-ish. But what you get in the end is much better. I thought about it a little and i definitely think it was better before.\n\nThere are many examples of mixed languages in interfaces: if the app uses twitter/facebook sharing from iOS, it's going to appear localized. If it uses iOS stock buttons, they're going to appear localized. No matter what language the app is showing.\n\nSo basically, iRate should use whatever iOS is using. But i guess there's no API for that, and in that case, the old implementation at least gave the same results as if there was one API.\n. Sure. I must say the project, as it is, is really great.\nJust thought i'd give my 2 cents about this new localization thing.\n. That worked great.

Run app with en localization - app will use correct localization as it's supported.\n2. Switch iPhone language to fr - app will use correct localization as it's supported..\n3.Switch iPhone to any not supported language - app will use the **last** (in our example fr) used supported language.\n\nSo to get worked en localization for en-GB you should switch iPhone to en localization first and then switch to en-GB and you'll get english text.\n\nTry to check this scenario. If it's reproducible for your then it's not iRate bug, it's Apple's feature :smile: \n. I had to use @nonamelive's fix which works fine for me in modal view.

Since some of them haven't been ported to ARC yet (and some of them probably never will), enabling ARC for iRate.m in all of them would be a lot of work, because you have to do that manually for every target in every project. By adding support for building without ARC we can continue updating our internal library automatically without requiring manual changes to every project which uses it.\n\nI'm also sure that there are still lots of iRate users which haven't had the opportunity or the interest (porting a \"finished\" app which is only on maintenance mode to ARC requires significant work in exchange for, literally, zero benefits) to port their code to ARC, but would like to use newer versions of iRate. By removing support for non-ARC you're preventing those users from upgrading. In the case of complex code bases - where keeping the source code both ARC and non-ARC compatible requires lots of work -, I would understand dropping support for non-ARC, but iRate only requires 3 calls to release. It's not like the code is going to be \"less pure\" or \"dirty\" by doing manual memory management.

    "techee": "Hello Nick, thanks. Your patch looks definitely cleaner, there's just one problem that the firstUsed variable isn't defined for existing users using older iRate version so on the next app update it will behave as if it was used for the first time, counters will be reset and there will be the same problem as I reported before.\n\nBut this will be just a one-time event so I guess it's alright...\n. And the above will happen only for new users who used the 1.10 release so it's actually not such a big problem because the variable will be defined for any previous release. So it's even less a problem.\n. Yeah, when I wrote the first comment, I was in some strange state of the mind thinking that firstUsed is a completely new variable not used before. Your patch is completely alright. \n\nThanks for your work and the library (I'm using XMLDictionary too)!\n. Argh. There is a serious problem in your patch:\n\n[defaults setObject:self.applicationVersion forKey:iRateLastVersionUsedKey];\n\nmust be set every time, not just the very first time (I had this one right in my second patch). This prevents ratings when onlyPromptIfLatestVersion is set. Looks like a new release will be needed.\n\nIn addition, \n\nself.firstUsed = [self.firstUsed dateByAddingTimeInterval:SECONDS_IN_A_DAY];\n\nisn't quite right - this adds one day to the first used day but when the user didn't use the app in the last say 20 days, this won't prevent the rating popup to appear. It's better to count the number of days from the current date as I did:\n\nNSDate *oneDayDelay = [NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSinceNow:(self.daysUntilPrompt-1) \\* (-SECONDS_IN_A_DAY)];\n. Well, it doesn't look good to me, sorry. I believe the code should look this way:\n\n```\n        if (self.firstUsed)\n        {\n            if ([[NSDate date] timeIntervalSinceDate:self.firstUsed] >= self.daysUntilPrompt * SECONDS_IN_A_DAY))\n            {\n                //if was previously installed, but we haven't yet prompted for a rating\n                //don't reset, but make sure it won't rate for a day at least\n                self.firstUsed = [[NSDate date] dateByAddingTimeInterval:(self.daysUntilPrompt - 1) * -SECONDS_IN_A_DAY];\n            }\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            //reset defaults\n            [defaults setObject:[NSDate date] forKey:iRateFirstUsedKey];\n            [defaults setInteger:0 forKey:iRateUseCountKey];\n            [defaults setInteger:0 forKey:iRateEventCountKey];\n            [defaults setObject:nil forKey:iRateLastRemindedKey];\n        }\n        [defaults synchronize];\n```\n1. The else is now executed even when the time check isn't satisfied, which is wrong. It should only be executed when first used (sorry, I haven't noticed this one before).\n2. You use < in the date check in the if but I believe it should be >. Are you sure about this? (It's 2AM here, I may be wrong, but this is also the way it was in my original patch.)\n3. Why do you use +1 in the if condition? I don't quite understand. The if should be the same like the one checking whether it's time to rate now. If it's not time to rate now, no problem.\n4. There should be -1 in the following, not +1 (you move back from now by one less day than daysUntilPrompt so the next day it will be daysUntilPrompt and the alert will pop up):\n   \n   ```\n   self.firstUsed = [[NSDate date] dateByAddingTimeInterval:(self.daysUntilPrompt - 1) * -SECONDS_IN_A_DAY];\n   ```\n5. Just one minor thing I have noticed is that since you update defaults in any case now, [defaults synchronize] should be moved out of the else block behind it. But this really isn't a big problem - you could actually skip the synchronize calls completely as iOS calls synchronize for you automatically (it's useful just in the case the app crashes before).\n. Hello Nick, thanks for the explanation, I wasn't aware of the promptForNewVersionIfUserRated knob (there are really lots of settings which can conflict with the code). Wouldn't it be safer to use [self ratedAnyVersion] for the reset check instead of [self ratedVersion:lastUsedVersion]?\n\nI understand what you mean why you added the +1, but there should be -1 I'm afraid. Have a look at the current code:\n\n```\n        else if ([[NSDate date] timeIntervalSinceDate:self.firstUsed] > (self.daysUntilPrompt + 1) * SECONDS_IN_A_DAY)\n        {\n            //if was previously installed, but we haven't yet prompted for a rating\n            //don't reset, but make sure it won't rate for a day at least\n            self.firstUsed = [[NSDate date] dateByAddingTimeInterval:(self.daysUntilPrompt + 1) * -SECONDS_IN_A_DAY];\n        }\n```\n\nThe else condition will be true one day after self.daysUntilPrompt and it won't prevent the rating window from appearing. Also if you set self.firstUsed with the +1 value, it will make the rating popup appear immediately because it's set to more than self.daysUntilPrompt days to the past.\n. I've seen it fixed in the previous commits but then you probably copy/pasted it from some older version.\n\nDon't worry, this is the kind of \"trivial\" patches that tend to break everything :-).\n. Just had a long look at master and it _looks_ good to me now. But after the previous experience with this issue, don't trust me - the previous releases looked good to me before as well ;-).\n. Back to the [defaults synchronize] - I was actually referring to the \n\n[defaults setObject:self.applicationVersion forKey:iRateLastVersionUsedKey];\n\nset at the beginning and because it's possible that neither if or else are executed, then there's no synchronize.\n\nHopefully the last problem I've noticed, just going through the code before preparing my apps for release.\n.

Then if we access `[iRateSubclass shared].myNewProperty` we will get a crash.\r\n\r\nI feel that `load` is a bit dangerous in that it's not a very common pattern.\r\n\r\nThanks!. The URL seems not to work anymore with the `action=write-review` parameter (I can reproduce the issue in Safari). Eg the App Store doesn't support opening (scrolling) to the new \"Ratings & Reviews\" section.. Maybe you can fork, and offer a pull request \ud83d\ude09 . We've seen a similar issue. While implementing the the `+ load` in iRate make it \"magic\", it causes undefined behavior because there is no control as to when  `+load ` is called. The proof of this undefined behavior is this bug affecting iOS 11. \r\n\r\nWe think that `load` should be removed as it causes these problems.. ",
