If you want to hide something then you better \ndon't do it (but that's my opinion) what you can do is bundle the .pyc instead \nof the .py if you don't want readable source code.\n\nres/raw is not so easy to find, and will still be visible otherwise python will \nnot be able to pick it up.

With python sl4a, if the 'same' webview \nis opened (ie: samefile.html), it will display the previous cached page, which \nis not good if you change the page code, such as viewing an image jpg, then \nviewing a new image jpg.  With apps built on sl4a, webviews are the only real \nuseable user interface.  I tried having the script name a new page (ie: \nnewfile1.html; newfile2.html; ...) but still the old cached jpg image was used. \n in my app, i display a number of images to the user ina webview, updating the \njpg image in the html code each view.  I solved this by ALSO changing the jpg \nnames (ie: jpg1.jpg; jpg2.jpg; ...)\n\nTo do this:\nimport random\nrandomPageName=random.randrange(0,100)\nrandomJpgName=random.randrange(0,100)\nhtmlPage=open('//file'+str(randomPageName)+'.html','wb')\nhtmlPage.write('<html><body><img \nsrc=\"jpg'+str(randomJpgName)+'.jpg\"/></body></html>')\nhtmlPage.close()\ndroid.webViewShow('//file'+str(randomPageName)+'.html')\n\n..get the idea?\nfurther to this, i delete the folder i use for the app upon exiting the script:\nimport shutil\nshutil.rmtree('/sdcard/MyAppFolder')\nmypath=('/sdcard/MyAppFolder')\n\n...then to make your folder again:\nimport os.path\nif not os.path.isdir(mypath):\n   os.makedirs(mypath)\n\nCheers:)\nand please have a look at my apps:\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=FineLineLabs\n\n```\n\nOriginal comment by `MichaelD...@gmail.com` on 24 Oct 2012 at 2:51\n. _From @GoogleCodeExporter on May 31, 2015 11:29_\n\n```\nOk.

I've attached my patch, and here are the steps I had \nto take to get it to build and compile.\n\n0) I built this on OSX Darwin, using the pre-built NDK r4, and I used \nandroid-8/arch-arm.\n\n1) I'm still not sure how to get a new version of the Python tree on a \nnon-emulator phone (I am new to this!) so I have not done so. However, it works \nfine on my emulator.  I'll try building an APK shortly and will update the \nissue with this info.\n\n2) The attached patch modifies the NumPy sources (1.4.1) to allow LONG_DOUBLE \nto be undefined, to remove the usage of unittest, to remove the \"newdoc\" and to \nremove some of the changes to the build system to force linkages against \naccelerated LAPACK on OSX.  One could imagine \n\n3) I had to modify agcc a bit to get it to work with the pre-built Darwin \ntoolchain in the NDK, but I assume this is par for the course. \n\n4) The NumPy compilation had to be modified substantially. \n   - CFLAGS had to pre-empt the linkage against the host Python's \npyport.h, which meant adding in a -I/path/to/device/python2.6 \n   - CC had to be set to be agcc. \n   - The build had to be done as \"hostpython setup.py build --fcompiler=fake install --prefix=/path/to/host\".  This should get piped into a log file. \n   - But, because it manually runs ranlib and links shared libraries, I had to additionally grep out the calls to gcc and to ranlib.  I re-did all the ranlib calls with arm-eabi-ranlib (this was for libnpymath.a), and then I re-ran the linkage with the same agcc arguments used for shared library linking in the Python Makefile: \"-Xlinker -export-dynamic -shared\" instead of (in my case on OSX) \"-bundle -undefined dynamic_lookup\". \n   - (This procedure is reminiscent of the full-static linkage done on Cray machines, where the solution is to usually just overwrite the build step in distutils.  I'm not sure if changing the toolchain for distutils is in the works for SL4A, but it might be neat.  For more info: http://yt.enzotools.org/wiki/CrayXT5Installation#Python ) \n   - the installation command didn't work, and would overwrite my libraries, so I manually copied them to the appropriate location in the python tree. \n\n5) I had to \"adb push\" the directory structure into the Python directory on the \nemulator, in \n/data/data/com.googlecode.pythonforandroid/files/python/lib/python2.6/site- \npackages/ \n\nOne thing I noticed was that without the \"compiler\" module installed .npz and \n.npy files, which are NumPy's mechanism for serializing arrays, were \nunavailable for use.  I'd personally really like to be able to pass data back \nand forth in this manner, so I re-enabled them.  But, perhaps flat binary is \nokay.\n```\n\nOriginal comment by `matthewt...@gmail.com` on 13 Aug 2010 at 3:00\n\nAttachments:\n- [sl4a_numpy.patch](https://storage.googleapis.com/google-code-attachments/android-scripting/issue-260/comment-4/sl4a_numpy.patch)\n. _From @GoogleCodeExporter on May 31, 2015 11:25_\n\n```\nAmazing work!

If you want to hide something then you better \ndon't do it (but that's my opinion) what you can do is bundle the .pyc instead \nof the .py if you don't want readable source code.\n\nres/raw is not so easy to find, and will still be visible otherwise python will \nnot be able to pick it up.

With python sl4a, if the 'same' webview \nis opened (ie: samefile.html), it will display the previous cached page, which \nis not good if you change the page code, such as viewing an image jpg, then \nviewing a new image jpg.  With apps built on sl4a, webviews are the only real \nuseable user interface.  I tried having the script name a new page (ie: \nnewfile1.html; newfile2.html; ...) but still the old cached jpg image was used. \n in my app, i display a number of images to the user ina webview, updating the \njpg image in the html code each view.  I solved this by ALSO changing the jpg \nnames (ie: jpg1.jpg; jpg2.jpg; ...)\n\nTo do this:\nimport random\nrandomPageName=random.randrange(0,100)\nrandomJpgName=random.randrange(0,100)\nhtmlPage=open('//file'+str(randomPageName)+'.html','wb')\nhtmlPage.write('<html><body><img \nsrc=\"jpg'+str(randomJpgName)+'.jpg\"/></body></html>')\nhtmlPage.close()\ndroid.webViewShow('//file'+str(randomPageName)+'.html')\n\n..get the idea?\nfurther to this, i delete the folder i use for the app upon exiting the script:\nimport shutil\nshutil.rmtree('/sdcard/MyAppFolder')\nmypath=('/sdcard/MyAppFolder')\n\n...then to make your folder again:\nimport os.path\nif not os.path.isdir(mypath):\n   os.makedirs(mypath)\n\nCheers:)\nand please have a look at my apps:\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=FineLineLabs\n\n```\n\nOriginal comment by `MichaelD...@gmail.com` on 24 Oct 2012 at 2:51\n. _From @GoogleCodeExporter on May 31, 2015 11:29_\n\n```\nOk.

I've attached my patch, and here are the steps I had \nto take to get it to build and compile.\n\n0) I built this on OSX Darwin, using the pre-built NDK r4, and I used \nandroid-8/arch-arm.\n\n1) I'm still not sure how to get a new version of the Python tree on a \nnon-emulator phone (I am new to this!) so I have not done so. However, it works \nfine on my emulator.  I'll try building an APK shortly and will update the \nissue with this info.\n\n2) The attached patch modifies the NumPy sources (1.4.1) to allow LONG_DOUBLE \nto be undefined, to remove the usage of unittest, to remove the \"newdoc\" and to \nremove some of the changes to the build system to force linkages against \naccelerated LAPACK on OSX.  One could imagine \n\n3) I had to modify agcc a bit to get it to work with the pre-built Darwin \ntoolchain in the NDK, but I assume this is par for the course. \n\n4) The NumPy compilation had to be modified substantially. \n   - CFLAGS had to pre-empt the linkage against the host Python's \npyport.h, which meant adding in a -I/path/to/device/python2.6 \n   - CC had to be set to be agcc. \n   - The build had to be done as \"hostpython setup.py build --fcompiler=fake install --prefix=/path/to/host\".  This should get piped into a log file. \n   - But, because it manually runs ranlib and links shared libraries, I had to additionally grep out the calls to gcc and to ranlib.  I re-did all the ranlib calls with arm-eabi-ranlib (this was for libnpymath.a), and then I re-ran the linkage with the same agcc arguments used for shared library linking in the Python Makefile: \"-Xlinker -export-dynamic -shared\" instead of (in my case on OSX) \"-bundle -undefined dynamic_lookup\". \n   - (This procedure is reminiscent of the full-static linkage done on Cray machines, where the solution is to usually just overwrite the build step in distutils.  I'm not sure if changing the toolchain for distutils is in the works for SL4A, but it might be neat.  For more info: http://yt.enzotools.org/wiki/CrayXT5Installation#Python ) \n   - the installation command didn't work, and would overwrite my libraries, so I manually copied them to the appropriate location in the python tree. \n\n5) I had to \"adb push\" the directory structure into the Python directory on the \nemulator, in \n/data/data/com.googlecode.pythonforandroid/files/python/lib/python2.6/site- \npackages/ \n\nOne thing I noticed was that without the \"compiler\" module installed .npz and \n.npy files, which are NumPy's mechanism for serializing arrays, were \nunavailable for use.  I'd personally really like to be able to pass data back \nand forth in this manner, so I re-enabled them.  But, perhaps flat binary is \nokay.\n```\n\nOriginal comment by `matthewt...@gmail.com` on 13 Aug 2010 at 3:00\n\nAttachments:\n- [sl4a_numpy.patch](https://storage.googleapis.com/google-code-attachments/android-scripting/issue-260/comment-4/sl4a_numpy.patch)\n. _From @GoogleCodeExporter on May 31, 2015 11:25_\n\n```\nAmazing work!
