Reasons why this was declined for community: \n\n### Travis.yml file\n\nWe are moving in different direction than Travis. We have difference in architecture that we find simpler.  \n\nRunner: clone repo, run tests & send output to coordinator\nCoordinator: get output from runners and show it to user.\n\nThats why all build scripts should be configured via UI. Its more user friendly and matches current architecture when coordinator does not know anything about repository. \n\n### Runners changes\n\nWe should not change runner code until we have a really good reason. No need to add any complexity in runner code. It should be simple lib that run process and submit output via API.\n. Thank you\n. @williamherry can you please update CHANGELOG too?\n. Sorry but we dont support sqlite: \n\n> SQLite shouldn't be used in production (because of mulit-user/multi-process access to DB)\n> Strange race conditions with SQL\n> Problems with locking\n\nSee discussion for GitLab - https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/pull/2093\n. Old one is expected behaviour. So this looks like a feature/improvement. It makes sense for me if your project requires super-specific ENV so you cant allow other runners to serve your build. So feature looks reasonable. \nBut If we want to change behaviour in this way we need next: \n- CHANGELOG entry\n- Place in UI where I can see that my project wont be served by shared runners\n- Runner UI should say that specific runners lock project from shared runners\n- tests for your change\n. We introduced specific runners so people can add own laptop/server/vps as runner for own projects only. Ex. I used this to extend build capacity for my fork in one instance. But advantages of `specific runners are there to limit where projects can be run` are bigger. Still this can be a breaking change for someone. So it should be properly described in UI and has CHANGELOG item\n. @ayufan I left some feedback. Also fix houndci comment please\n. @ayufan thank you\n. @vsizov can you review this please?\n. Already made it - 622aca85c4e5a36da66e3a25da7c7f0a67967736\n. @ayufan I though you will create issue first on gitlab.com to discuss what staff can be interesting to include.

So it cant be `Build duration` because single build can take 20-30% of total all builds in one commit\n. I have feeling `Cumulative build duration` will be even more confusing. Maybe something like `Summary builds duration` or `Builds duration`?\n. @nejctrdin we removed Jobs in `7.12.0.pre` :)  Maybe `Builds duration` will be a good choice so far\n. thank you\n.
