It's something I plan to do.\n\nMost of the apps are copied and modified from https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-app-samples, but some of it are from https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/samples, which has no licence. I will add a license in each example app directory. \n. @BigTundra  No. The capturer API doesn't capture the audio.\n. The flash packaging issue is more likely to a issue of `electron-packager` repo, an is already tracked in maxogden/electron-packager#114. So I'm closing this issue.\n. @sapioit Thanks for your contributions!\nCould you merge the commit in #12 into this PR since they are relevant to the same thing?\n. @sapioit That's ok. I have merged the two PRs. Thanks.\n. :+1 Thanks for your contributions!\n. Thanks.\n. Could you open the dev-tools console and see the output message?\n. Closing it as fixed in #27.\n. Thanks for finding it.\nI'm not willing to update the new APIs because it is not compatible, which will break the sample running on early versions of electron.\n. Closing it in favour of #17 .\n. @ChongTang \nThanks for the contributions! Rather than adding the fake options, I prefer to remove the `crashReporter` in FileExplorer. The `crashReporter` seems useless in this sample.\n. @ChongTang Are you willing to work on this? Otherwise, I can do it for you. \n. Thanks!\n. Thanks! The `sharedObj` isn't mentioned in Electron's document yet. After atom/electron#4392 gets merged, I will merge it.\n. Thanks!\n. Good catch, thanks!\n. Thanks for the contribution!  Looks good to me. \n\nBTW, Do you test it on Windows?\n. Thanks!\n. What do you mean by saving the recording?\n. I'd suggest you to seek help in electron [community](https://github.com/electron/electron#community).\n. @styfle \nAwesome! Thanks for your contribution.\n. The samples use deprecated APIs, which are removed in v1.0.0. Currently, you can use v0.37.8 to run the sample.\nClosing this in favour of #28 .\n. Yes, the version of Pepper Flash Plugin should be aligned with the one being used in the Electron's Chromium version.. Great, thanks!\n. I'd suggest you to use https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager.\n. Hello @mannycolon, the `readme` has already mentioned how to run the sample code.\n\nFor tutorials building electron apps step-by-step, I recommend you to read https://github.com/feross/electron-workshop. \n. PepperFlashPlayer v23.0.0.205 is used in Chrome 54, but the latest Electron v1.4.4 is still based on Chrome 53, so you need to use the version of PepperFlashPlayer which is corresponding to Chrome 53.0.2785.113 (I don't the exact version for it because my chrome is 54 already). \n\nMaybe I should clarify the readme document of the pepper sample. The current words `Copy from Chrome Browser` are a bit of misleading.\n. Yeah, exactly. I found that chrome 53 is using 23.0.0.162.\n. Thanks!\n. There should be an electron API for it. I think you could find more details in the discussion of https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/1956.\r\n\r\nThe `readme` of `client-certificate` sample might not keep with the latest status of electron, pull requests are always welcome \ud83d\ude04 \r\n\r\nI'm closing it as this is not an issue related to this repository.. Thanks @herrmannplatz \ud83d\udc4d . Issues of `electron-sample-apps` are for feature requests and bug reports. I'd suggest you asking questions about using Electron [community](https://github.com/electron/electron#community) or the [Slack Channel](http://atom-slack.herokuapp.com/).. The `Notification` used in `window.js` is a HTML5 API, it is a build-in API in browser. In other words, you need to call it in renderer process.\r\n\r\nFor using `Notification` API in main process, please use the `notification` module provided by electron (since v1.7.3 beta).\r\n\r\nThe document of `Notification` in the sample is kind of out-of-dated, patch are always welcome. :). @cervenyprofiq \ud83d\udc4d Thanks!. visit \"chrome://gpu\" probably gives you some clues.. Thanks!. @cg-cnu, sorry, currently I don't have bandwidth to look into it. But if you think it is an electron bug, just create an issue in electron's github repo (with a minimal reproducible application).. I'm closing it out, free free to reopen it. . @cg-cnu no problem. Contributions are always welcome :). Thanks for the contribution. I'm closing this PR as it is actually not working. Feel free to reopen it again when it is ready.. I haven't tried it on Windows 10, it seems a bug of electron,  I'd suggest you filing/redirecting the bug there.. Closing it now unless more information provided.. @anshumanv Thanks for pointing it out! PRs are always welcome.. \ud83d\udc4d Thanks!. @jkeam Thanks!.
