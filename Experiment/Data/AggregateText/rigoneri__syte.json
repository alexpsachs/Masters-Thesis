I'll pull this in once you got Syte on your website... I don't want the link pointing to a site that doesn't use Syte, sam did the same thing :)\n. Hey http://defaude.info is not using Syte, could you let me know when it's out there so I can pull this one in. Thanks!\n. Thanks! I had fixed this on old branch but forgot to merge it in... \n. Hey just make sure to pull the Github fixes to your Syte... Thanks!\n. Hey, just fyi github shutdown their v2 api so make sure you pull the latest changes so you can integrate with v3. Thanks\n. Hmm that's strange... Make sure you copy and pasted the client_id, and client_secret correctly. Also make sure that GITHUB_OAUTH_ENABLED is set to True, If you got the access token back double check the access token was copy and pasted correctly. This message usually shows when the access token is wrong. Thanks!\n. Cool... Ok. Are you running this locally (127.0.0.1:8000)? Or are you running this in heroku? If it's heroku the callback url in github should be http://eveiga.herokuapp.com/github/auth,\n\nIf it's locally make sure that the DEPLOYMENT_MODE is pointing to 'dev' so the SITE_ROOT_URI is set to the local url and so the redirect_uri paramater is the same as the one saved in github (127.0.0.1:8000)\n\nThanks!\n. Did you redeploy statics? Probably bump up to 1.1\n. Cool, np! Btw just a suggestion you should always bump up the COMRESS_REVISION_NUMBER so it creates statics files with new names... That way it doesn't uses the browser cached ones and people don't have to force reload to see the difference. Thanks!\n.

Also you should not have committed your secrets to github, other people can see it use it. I recommend you changing them. Thanks!!\n. What's the url the your Syte is deployed?\n. Cool thanks!! \n. Thanks! But I'm not sure how you pull request is any different from what I already got. Btw!

I've added support for local posts via Markdown files instead of a database.  You can just write markdown files, place them in the 'articles' directory and your ready to go.  No other real configuration on the server-side necessary.\n\nYou can check it out here, https://github.com/durden/syte/tree/logr_integration.\n. Looks good! I'll update my branch soon with improvements.\n. @eventh You are right.  Thanks for the correction.  Hopefully nothing is missing now.\n. Good call again @eventh.  The process to add a new service is pretty lengthy.  Maybe there could be a hook into manage.py that adds a command like 'add_new_service' that stubs out most of this?\n. ",
