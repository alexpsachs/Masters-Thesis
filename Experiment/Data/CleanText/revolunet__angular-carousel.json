    "revolunet": "fixed in 4c9c2761103636db41c2ef3c98bf8e0a53ad9904\n. strange, dont have this here.\ndo you encounter the same on the demo : http://blog.revolunet.com/angular-carousel/ ?\nwhich browser ? its webkit only at the moment\n. can you please update to the last version too\ncheers & thanks for reporting\n. you're right i should change that quickly. what about \n- rn-carousel\n- revo-carousel\n- revolunet-carousel\n- touch-carousel \n  ?\n. thanks :)\n. you're right, at the moment, the container size is determined at sartup byt the first li size.\nwe should rely on css.\n. Here's how it works at the moment, maybe you can have some ideas to help resolve this :\n 1) We add a wrapper div around your UL so we only display one slide at a time.\n 2) That wrapper size is then determined from the size of the first LI detected and set as an inline style.\n(the UL/LI blocks are transformed in a very long single line)\nSolutions :\n- listen to orientationchange event and update the container size from the first LI\n- add autosize=true|false attribute to the directive so that we dont do size detection based on the LI but rather let you control that using your own CSS. (there is already a .rn-carousel-container CSS class.)\nAny comments ?\n. should be fixed now, we update the carousel size when we detect orientationchange\n. weird... i'll remove that. depending on the viewport meta tag i had some pixels so tried that but this is stupid.\n. added in 8ef09e5cedcaa15d21d77fdd34988f7089857941\n. strange, working fine here with your syntax, provided you have enough \"pages\".\nadding some tests today.\nand thanks for reporting\n. can this be closed ?\n. woot :) that's awesome thank you.\nthis will make testing a lot easier\n. merged from the command line, thanks a ton !\n. its still in the angular source : https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/src/ngMobile/swipe.js but can't find it in the distribution on code.angularjs.org !\n. its not even in the snapshot distribution :/\n. faire une version build avec images en local\n. http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=luxury%20appartement\n. fixed in 2666db82486c1a0e0e8b5948f7607c04fc84910a\n. any online version we can test ?\ndo you use the DOM buffer feature ?\n. Thanks fot he plnkr.\nFYI i think fastclick is not needed when using angular-mobile. ngClick is overidden to handle tap events here.\nNever had a chance to play with FireBase yet but did you try the same with a 'static' dataset ?\nDoes swiping 'fast' makes a difference ?\n. You're right the deep watch has a perf cost and is useless in your case (big static data). just added an issue and pushed a fix : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/issues/18\nplnkr is mega slow here tonight so i'll experiment with my devices tomorrow\n. i dont see any issue on the nexus4 nor ipad\n. ho yeah nice :) and don't you want to sync the two carousels ? original and traduction ?\n. can you please test with the last version ?\n. tried with motorola xoom 1 : after resuming the app, using another coming back... everything is ok.\nclosed the device, returned one day later, app still working fine\nis it text to speech ? works nicely !\nthe only issue is that when you swipe quickly, it never stops and plays all slides and we cant stop/reset it :)\n. thanks for reporting; the component.json is indeed outdated. i have to see how to \"bowerise\" the ngMobile module which is included in angular 1.1.4 and up.\nI updated the README though.\n. fixed. the real bower package name at the moment is \"angular-rn-carousel\".\n. Yes. this is a good question. should the getNext/getPrev modify the original collection, or not....\n. The models (real ngrepeat and carousel content) are now synchronized. \nthere's still an issue if you prepend items to the original collection, which offsets the carousel.\n. the prev/next callbacks have been removed in the new version.you can manipulate the original collection directly.\n. fixed in https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/commit/4900e8964cd4dcfdc657d9c848a5338b24c97114\n. duplicate of #5 \n. you can easily create your own indicator :\nhtml\n<ul rn-carousel rn-carousel-index=\"index\"><li ng-repeat=\"item in items\">...</li></ul>\n<div>{{ index }} / {{ items.length }}</div>\nany other idea ?\n. @ManuelColombo you mean when you click an indicator to switch to given slide ?\n. i should implement directive controller pattern\n. Hi guys, FYI, a new refactored version has been pushed, and support clickable indicators.\nThere's a demo with custom controls and thumbnail navigation...\nSo basically, for a custom indicator you just need to bind the rn-carousel-index :)\n. you're right, never tried with objects (but i will)\n. if you have short deadlines, convert your structure to array :)\ni'll try to give a shot this week anyway...\n. i added a rn-carousel-watch attribute, please test and tell me if it helps.\n(not compatible with rn-carousel-cycle)\n. Yes, tried various strategies with no luck yet.\nThe ng-click is independant from the swipe that dont deals with clicks but mouseup/mousedown instead, so we cannot cancel any click here...\n. angular 1.2 forward the $event in $swipe service so we should be able to cancel it : https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/507d8021b1c91cc0cefc0418e61b04597ad1030b\n. see #53\n. this works with the rn-carousel-index binding\n. which error, details, traceback ?\n. you need to use the angular-mobile included in my dist folder, the official angular version does not include the swipe service for some reason....\n. which example are you testing ? looks fine here\n. yes, sorry this is WIP and theres a pending commit here, should land soon, thank you for your help\n. this has been merged manually along with another fix. thanks @Dolmio \n. thanks for reporting. should this be included in the default CSS ?\n. thanks !\n. should be fixed in b7d15aace22cac8946708cbef2914a672de5d4fd\n. I don't think so, this one is focused for mobile :)\nBTW Opera should run WebKit so it should work too\n. see #42 \n. Do you use the last version (from 12/07) ? there's been a flickering introduced in a version just before but it should have been fixed since\n. I think it comes from this line : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/blob/master/dist/angular-carousel.js#L136\ntry replacing it with :\ncarousel.css(translateSlideProperty(getTransformCoordinates(carousel[0]), true));\n. does this happens only on the infinite carousel ?\n. this should be fixed now, can you confirm please ?\n. I just pushed a fix and removed the 2D support for the moment. It was to prevent the blurry effect on some devices but can't reproduce it yet. tell me if its better for you. tested on Ipad and Nexus4 + desktop\n. thanks\n. good idea :)\nif the code doesnt find the ngRepeat, but find some  childs, then it should add the rn-carousel-slides css class to them directly. this could work directly.\n. you can try the puredom branch and tell me if it works nice for you\n. bump\n. merged !\n. i guess the first thing would be to change the transform/translate3D CSS. For example you could use absolute left positionning instead of translate.\n. First check that the swipe events are correctly handled.\nThen update the CSS code\nYou know bootstrap-ui has a nice carousel right ?\n. i guess the first thing would be to change the transform/translate3D CSS. For example you could use absolute left positionning instead of translate.\n. use rn-carousel-index binding; you could use localStorage or cookies to store/reload the position.\n. Hi @vergnes ; thanks for noticing this and the detailed report.\nI had some flickering on iPad and i remember this fixed it, but not 100% sure. i'll find it out later today and tell you\n. just checked on iPad and yes, without that trick there is some flickering.\nYou can try that on the demo page with a standard safari browser and remove the CSS property from the inspector.\nI don't know why but it happens when you touch the slide to swipe it, you get a little flickering at the start of the movement (on the first movement transform:translate3d). then the movement makes no more flickering. any idea ?\n. thanks\n. Thanks Kevin, that's great. \nCan you just please fix my 2 comments and push --force on your branch ?\n. I've just merged another pending request so please rebase your branch before with \"git fetch upstream && g\u00eet rebase upstream/master\"\nThanks\n. replaced in favor of https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/pull/54\n. aren't $routeParams readonly ?\n. Thanks !\nCan you please explain which flickr you had and on which devices ?\n. what do you mean?\n. done, tell me if its ok, im not bower expert\n. thanks for reporting\n. the new version dropped carouselCollection so this should not be an issue anymore\n. Absolutely right, Thank you\n. sorry for the huge delay; just pushed a new refactored verson that works on angular 1.2.7\n. Hi, thanks\nYou mean scroll vertically inside one of the carousel items ?\nNever tried but it should definitely do it :)\nIt doesnt work ?\n. good news, so you can close this issue :)\n. should work in the version\n. which device ? works fine here\n. does the demo page work on your S4 ? http://blog.revolunet.com/angular-carousel\n. angular mobile provides the swipe service which you can use to listen start/move/end events\n. on the carousel itself, you can watch the \"index\", just use rn-carousel-index=\"indexValue\" and init it at 0 for the first slide\n. @sirair was using an older version. see #92 for a propable solution\n. i guess this is a CSS issue; \nThe official demo works fine.\nBTW carousel not ready yet for angular 1.2 :/ (there are some pending pull requests)\n. Thanks for reporting; I dont have this behaviour here. Device ? angular version ?\nSame behaviour on demo page : http://blog.revolunet.com/angular-carousel ?\n. yep. also looks like $swipe service doesnt send the touchend event in some cases\n. workin on it\n. just pushed a fix, can you please check ?\nit may have some perf impacts though.\n. ok. i guess you mean \"the problem still exists\" :)\nDo you have the same problem on carousel without indicators ? (this may be the cause)\n. You can check this maybe : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/issues/42#issuecomment-26045426\nI wish someone could make a PR with a clean IE<10 support, without needing jQuery\n. not yet implemented, sorry :/ This should be a setting for the \"carouselCollection\" service.\nthis service is just a helper to handle the buffer, cycling of cards... but it needs improvements.\n. you can do it using rn-carousel-index databinding\n. Hi. In the new refactored version , the default buffer is now 5 items.\n. Hi Andy :) Wow that sounds awesome thank you !\nI'll check that in the next few days, good timing for the refactoring in progress :)\n. nope i just didnt need it with the last refactor\n. from my POV yes but maybe our buddy @ajoslin have another idea...\n. the scroll implementation is quite naive :\n1) detect the support prefix if any \nhttps://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/blob/master/src/directives/rn-carousel.js#L366-L374\n2) apply it when needed https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/blob/master/src/directives/rn-carousel.js#L184\ni dont see how we can make this simpler/lighter\n. little guy ?\n. thanks guys ! \n@ajoslin : so when do you join Tobias ? :p\n. :+1: \n. i just pushed a complete refactored version. could you check if this is fixed please ? thanks\n. works for me\n. Not much time to work on it yet sorry :/ Im not sure what samsung did on their last series about the 3d transitions.\nAlso i should implement requestAnimationFrame here to limit the animations.\n@bondaestudi : you have slow perf on iPhone 5 ?\n. I just pushed a new version with different animations that should play better with various devices thanks to requestAnimationFrame. its smooth here. would be nice if you could check again and tell me if its better. thanks guys.\n. will check that thanks\n. @kconragan ive invesitgated on my nexus4+chrome. For some reason, the slower you move the slide, the slower are the FPS, which i really don't understand yet. do you feel the slowness or is it only the FPS that bugs you ? I experience the same behaviour on chrome desktop too. i'd appreciate  an explanation of this phenomen :)\n. thanks @NathanWalker ! very appreciated. I'll make a full review+tests this week and try to merge it manually. stay tuned :)\n. @8enmann I will have some time next week to integrate various PRs and work on some refactor, thanks for your patience.\n. ok now that 1.2 is released, i'll merge this to master soon. thanks guys\n. Hi guys, sorry for the delay, had some timing warp issues lately :/\nI've just pushed a refactored version of the carousel, which is lighter and easier to read and maintain. so this PR won't fit in, sorry for this.\nThe indicators are not yet available in the new version but this will be easy to implement. BTW the indicators/carousel implem should work using the directives 'require' and 'controller' pattern.\n. just pushed optional clickable carousel indicators. thanks guys\n. Setting font-size:0 to the container should prevent this behaviour\n. thanks @abaran and sorry for the late update. this have been implemented in https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/pull/67\n. Thanks @munro :) By curiosity, in which browsers do you see this behaviour ?\n. Ok thanks i'll check it. Chrome is known to handle subpixel rendering correctly though...\n. thanks. i finally removed this complexity from the carousel in the new version. it was a big overhead for not much.\n. sorry for the delay. just pushed a big refactor so this issue should not be revelant anymore. please check and reopen the issue if still a problem. thanks guys\n. there's been a big refactor so i'll close this issue for now. can you please try again with the new version and reopen if you still have the same problem ? a test case could help :)\nThanks\n. @pico7 : \"From Angular Site (after clicking on the link in the console)\" can you give me an url that demonstrates the problem ?\n. you must have a fixed size container and you can put any image inside. maybe use a css background-size:cover to cove the whole space with your image\n. the new version should have this fixed. can you confirm please ?\n. i've just pushed a refactored version, sorry for the delay. i advise you to set the size of the slides in CSS so it can compute it before. thanks\n. thanks. updated in the new version\n. you can add a binding to rn-carousel-index and use a $watch in your controller to detect when it changes\n. oops, thank you :)\n. at the moment there's no enabled mode :/\n. mmm. not sure. a dirty workaround would be to use ng-switch to alternate between static content and the carousel\n. I think this has been implemented in this change : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/commit/9d53957f4b1cb95d755c55e76aec5c370af58684 with the rn-carousel-swipe attribute\n. Hi Nathan,\nThe demo works well with the cases mentionned so i'm not sure about your issue.\nhttp://blog.revolunet.com/angular-carousel/\nDo you use jQuery ?\nYou include ngTouch ?\nAny error in the console ?\nIs there a live non-working example somewhere ?\n. thanks. if you have something interesting, please shar e:)\n. i'll look at it; thanks for your help\n. Hi, thanks for reporting. At the moment we compute the width from the first child on init (or when collection changes) We need this to apply the correct transformation and this implies that all the slides have the same width, which is obvious i guess. If you have some suggestions...\n. yes, this was the case before, i'll add onresize\n. thank you, appreciated !\n. the window resizing has been fixed\nfor @gsklee issue... i don't have any idea at the moment\n. there's been a PR on this subject : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/pull/137\nwhat do you think about it guys ? can you test if it fixes your issues ?\n. if anyone here can make a little plnkr to demonstrate the issue it could help fix it on my open source day\n. hey there, been really busy here... but i would be very happy to have others maintainers here.\n. mmmm. ng-if creates a sub-scope so assigning a value without a dot inside the carousel does not propagate upwards. classic.\nif you use ng-if or anything that add scope nesting, you need to use dotted notation for your ngModel if you want it propagated.\neg: rn-carousel-index=\"demo.carouselIndex\". i'll add a demo with that tonight\n. mmm check the last example it uses an ngif\n. Thanks. for some reason, on tablet, resize AND orientationchange are fired. any idea how to prevent this ?\n. thanks\n. thanks buddy\n. i don't have this behaviour... possible to make a plnkr demo please ?\n. you mean with a binding ?\n. Ok thanks @gaku, appreciated :) so you had this behaviour using multiple template based carousels ?\n. Argh. The new verison use requestAnimationFrame and this isn't supported on older Androids :/\nIt would be very nice if you could try with this polyfill included in your page and tell me how it goes. Just include it before the angular code : https://github.com/darius/requestAnimationFrame/blob/master/requestAnimationFrame.js\nthanks for reporting\n. Ok thank you, nice to know. maybe i should include the polyfill.\nIs it \"smooth\" enough ?\n. thanks for the report :)\n. i don't even understand what that really means. thanks for being so explicit\n. this has been fixed in af99eaf92c7285c2c689bac7556ad33a70b448c1\n. @PascalPrecht we need to remove the preventDefault https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/blob/master/src/directives/rn-carousel.js#L301-L302\n. this have been removed in the last version (merge 2 days ago), can you please check its now ok ?\n. thanks for your feedback\n. Hi @JumpLink and thank you. \nDon't you think this should be a binded property so we can dynamically activate/deactivate the swipe ?\n. awesome, thank you @JumpLink i've just rebased and merged manually :)\n. Hey @fastfrwrd thanks for the changes, looks good to me.\nThe pseudo-elements for the indicators and controls are a good idea.\nCould you please remove the vendor-prefix from the sass and just use standard SCSS ? grunt-autoprefixer takes care of adding necessary vendors which make the scss source more readable and allows vendors customisation at build time.\nThanks for your help.\n@JumpLink : any suggestion ?\n. also thanks for the tests which were dying since my last refactor :/\nonce this little changes made i'll merge manually \n. yep that's cool, we'll add some info about how to override this in the README\n. thanks @fastfrwrd i merged it with some little changes, hope its ok for you ;\n- in the scss, removed the padding-bottom from the carousel-container and used relative positionning for the indicators\n- in the controls, renamed \"back\" to \"prev\" to stay with the prev/next naming\nworks great thanks !\n. here's a way to do it before someone implement it right inside the directive :\n- add a rn-carousel-index binding ot the carousel\n- from your controller, increment this model using $interval\n. bump?\n. thanks man\n. thanks this is great; so i just need to grunt changelog to update the changelog ?\n. ok thanks man !\n. looks like i MUST use the \"v\" prefix in my releases tag names, right ?\n. thanks @PascalPrecht will do it now :)\n. duplicate of #94 \n. should be a dedicated directive role\n. thanks, updated the README in 18834b740b3dbea6e337fe26679cde4a613e822c\n. ngTouch is the new name of the module\nyour issue is quite unreadable (please read https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) , or, could you please provide a correct diff ?\n. thanks dude. FYI you can add \"diff\", \"javascript\" or any syntax after the three backticks for better coloring\n. ngMobile has been rename to ngTouch about 6 months ago : https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/94ec84e7b9c89358dc00e4039009af9e287bbd05\n. you're right my bad; will fix now\n. If you read the README, you can see that you need to include the requestAnimationFrame polyfill.\n. thanks buddy, welcome :+1: \n. i thinks thi has been implemented here : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/commit/9d53957f4b1cb95d755c55e76aec5c370af58684\n. thanks for your help dude, could you just please : \n- rebase and squash your commits and use a standard commit message\n- let the dist files, gitignore and CSS as is\n- add a note about this new attribute in the README ?\nthen you'll be the perfect contributor :)\nThank you\n. Hi the indicators are clickable on the demo page so quite strange...\nAny live example ?\n. bump ?\n. @bradparker : any news on this ?\n. should have been fixed in af99eaf92c7285c2c689bac7556ad33a70b448c1 can you please confirm ?\n. the new attribute name is rn-carousel-locked \n. @jeevanpalakurty : do you have the problem with the last example in the demo : http://blog.revolunet.com/angular-carousel/ ?\n. thanks for reporting. this may be something with touchcancel; will try to get a test device.\n. you can watch the rn-carousel-index property\n. no hook for this at the moment sorry\n. which iOS du you use ? \nfrom the readme :\n\nNOTE : if you use iOS<7 or Android<4 please include the requestAnimationFrame polyfill in your application.\n. ok sorry 7, didnt notice the title. lol\n. OK thanks, looks good to me. Could you please issue a PR with that fix and a conventionnal commit message : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/edit#\n\nthanks\n. awesome thanks man !\n. Thanks for reporting this issue and have made the plunker.\nLooks like there is a problem with the width detection. We need to get the carousel width at initiatlisation so we can apply the correct translation. Maybe this could be achieved using % in the future.\nAnyone could try this please ?\njs\nif (containerWidth===0 && carousel[0].parentNode) {\n    containerWidth = carousel[0].parentNode.getBoundingClientRect().width;\n}\nthis should be added at the end of the getCarouselWidth() function, just before the return\n. thanks; I've changed a bit the code and more important, applies the changes to the source, not the distribution version :) Also squashed and reworded your commit message an merges manually.\n. thanks. squashed and renamed your commmit and merges manually\n. maybe the new version could help you here. the animation part is separated in a service so you can fully control how single slides are rendered based on number of slides and current offset;\n. you mean a scrollable div ? with -webkit-overflow-scroll:touch ?\n. yep, removed because it as too messy\n. Hi, i think you should take the time to read the 5th line of the readme :)\n. another merged PR have implemented this feature recently\n. Thanks for reporting this in details. We add the preventDefault before but removed it to allow vertical page scrolling while also swiping the carousel horizontally.\n. Sorry for the delay.\nTesting has been disabled in the last refactor and this should be fixed...\nAbout your change, can't this be done in pure css ? :first-child :last-child pseudo-selectors ?\nAlso, FYI angular expose $first and $last in the ng-repeat scope\n. Thanks for your answers;\nAbout the ngRepeat variables i just meant you could use :\njs\nfirst: $first,\nlast: $last\nYes if CSS can make the same work i imagine is a bit less expensive, bust this is a blind assumption\nHave a good day :)\n. thanks for your feedback Emanuel !\n. thanks a lot @othermore . i'll look at this closely.\nany reason why you re-imported the \"preventDefault\" and \"stopPropagation\" ?\n. thanks guys for these great improvements.\nMy comments :\n- the has3d function should definitely called only once and not on each move. So please make the detection at initialization time and only once. around here : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/blob/master/src/directives/rn-carousel.js#L378-L387\nThen for the PR, could you please :\n- remove raf.js from the bower dependencies; as it should only affect IE users, they will add it manually. right ? if so this need to be more explicit in the README \n- squash your changes in a single commit using the angular commit messages convention (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/edit#)\nthanks for this great improvements !\n. @onesime : about the polyfill, the README actually advise this one : https://github.com/darius/requestAnimationFrame/blob/master/requestAnimationFrame.js\nis it the good one ? (looks like more recent the paul one)\n. thanks for your changes this is a really useful feature.\ndon't you think we can simply skip the \"iAttributes.rnCarouselIe9support\" and just use the correct translate property based on the has3d detection ?\n. i've removed it in 0.2.1 so any non-css3d browser will use css2d. does this sounds good to you ?\n. thanks a lot for the fix !\n. has been merged manually\n. i've just pushed a new tag on bower (0.2.1). can you confirm its now ok ?\nthanks\n. i merged a commit 2 days ago that may be related (or not) and its not in bower yet.\nany way for you to test with that change : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/commit/f1c98fef52f1ea540e5ed55eb2219176e0f98f3d ?\n. closing old issues\n. thanks for reporting this. when this fix applied do we still need the requestAnimationFrame polyfill for iOS 6  ?\n. just added it manually thank you !\n. this round has been added here : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/issues/70\nand yes this cause issue with non-integer containers...so let's merge this thank you\n. Hi Remy, thanks for this interesting change.\nDon't you think we should only start a setTimeout after any resize event, then cancel it when the size is considered stable ?\n. in the next version, the slides will fit to the container size using % instead of pixels to hopefully prevent the size detection and associated \"complexity\"\n. cool change, thank you\n. merged the fix, thanks\n. great thank you !\n. not working vertically at the moment, but good idea for a PR :)\n. Hi, do you have any demo plunker so i can see the problem ?\n. thanks @lucwastiaux please close if issue solved\n. Hi\nYes you can its just a question of template.\nThere is an example demo here : blog.revolunet.com/angular-carousel/demo/flickr-full/index.html\nMaybe i should add an example in the main page.\n. hi. Mmmm ok flickr link is broken. Any way in the HTML you have the source for multi-items. it's just a trick in the template, you display n items at once in a single \"li\" block\n. Yep makes sense but not implemented\n. thanks Ben !\n. thanks\n. Hi, depending on your Android version (see README) you should add the requestAnimationFrame polyfill. did you try this ?\n. bump ?\n. thanks for feedbach @halyburton \n. should be easy with the new version, you have full control on the indicators\n. strange :/ do you have any error reported ? do you use the last version ?\n. should be fixed in last version\n. thanks !\n. in your controller you could add a watch to the index given in rn-carousel-index which is updated when slide is changed\n. Hi, not yet but this would be very cool... have to work on it :)\n. Hi.\nThis should be an effect of some CSS (margin/padding/border).\nDo you have a live example ?\n. thanks for the feedback\n. ?\n. carousel only works with same size slides at the moment :/\nyou should make sure all the slides have the same size and maybe use background-size: cover to make the background fit\n. in the next version, the slides will be constrained to the container size\n. No ETA yet, sorry\n. thank you but the polyfill ias described in the README\n. No worry thanks for helping :)\n. thanks for reporting, will add this\n. included in last release\n. in the next version the slides height will be at maximum the container height (overflow hidden)\n. thanks man \n. thanks this has been merged manually\n. did you try using the Polyfill noted in the README ?\nIt should already handle the fallback, doesn't it ?\n. Hey @milica thanks for the feedback.\nAs said in the project README, requestAnimationFrame polyfill is not included by default and you should add it manually if needed.\n. thanks\n. hi thanks for reporting\ncurrently we're using builtin angular ngTouch module and this may cause the issue.\none workaround you can try : manually remove the ngClick directive from ngTouch module. I guess this can be the cause.\nplease confirm\n. is 3000x5000 the device resolution ? its huge !\nresizing images in the browser have a big impact on perfs\n. Yep carousel works with any kind of content but i dont get why canvas perf could be better; Its already GPU accelerated with the CSS3d transformations.\nNot using \"cover\" should help increase perfo.\nMaybe try in a empty page outside of the ionic context too\n. could be interesting to have an isolated example with these giant images to benchmark/analyse\n. btw, this document could be useful if you report other issues somewhere : https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/\n. Thanks for reporting and sorry for the delay.\nDo you see any real world use case for the auto-hide attribute to be observed ? i guess it could be a simple boolean that conditionally adds (or not) the indicator when initializing the carousel ?\n. thanks for reporting.\nI planned a way to have a dynamic load of additional slides on prev/next but didnt found a correct solution to this yet.\nFeel free to propose solutions if you have some :)\n. Thanks\nOn $destroy, you should also make sure to remove any listener you've set manually.\nBTW, we should find a way to not be dependant on the carousel-indicators\n. @rodrigoreis22 : true\n. mmm the doc does not clearly says it removes the event. it says you're responsible of the cleanup, right ?\nLooks like there's some kind of events removal on the element itself on $destroy here though: https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/c61626f10dc0b7913d7af59dcb0612f168327e60/src/jqLite.js#L259\nnice to know you don't like what has been achieved here :)\n. Thanks for your work @CosticaPuntaru, this is a great addition !\nI agree that the carousel definitely needs another rewrite :)\n. thanks for reporting, just pushed an update\n. you mean {{ slideIndex }} ?\n. try this:\n- remove your custom li\n- add a fake item at the end of your items \n- add an ng-if=\"$index==$last\" in your li template that display the alternative content\n. Hi !\nRTL is not supported yet but i'd be pleased to assist you implement it.\nI'm not aware of CSS RTL capabilities.\n. Ok i have to play a bit with this tonight because RTL is a new thing for me :)\n. looks like it won't be easy as-is.\nthis feature should be part of an upcoming rewrite.\none workaround :\n- order your items in the ng-repeat in reverse order\n- set \"rn-carousel-index\" attribute to the slides length on start :)\n. say your slides are defined in the json node array slides. just get the length with slides.length.\nto reverse a javascript array you just have to do slides.reverse()\n. if you use rn-carousel-bufferef, only 5 slides are loaded at once\n. /cc @CosticaPuntaru\n. this has been fixed in the last version\n. just some time to review, rebase and merge, sorry :/ will dive into these days\n. hi\ni pushed an updated version that should make this easier\n. Sorry i don't get your problem guys.. any plunker ?\n. thanks. in you plunker, you should put rn-carousel-index=\"slideIndex\" on the UL not the LI\n. @gabberr you should not set rn-carousel-container yourself, the carousel adds it itself\n. the new version has simpler css so this shouldnt be an issue anymore\n. Hi. Yes this is not easy with the current implementation but someone made it : http://blog.revolunet.com/blog/2013/05/02/angular-carousel-making-of/#comment-1417657730\n. Thanks, great fix, looks good to me :)\n. in fact this is based on a quite old version so i merged it manually, thanks\n. thanks, i implemented this on the new version : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/commit/6ff425daa389a7b9ba5138a740f14fa1dd0e05fe\nthis is a bit more complicated because the $watchCollection simply don't work correctly https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/2621 i didnt find a better way\n. should be fixed in last version\n. should be really easy to implement in the new version, see the demo example\n. yes the new version should fix this. can yo confirm?\n. in the new version, use \"rn-carousel-transition='none'\" should fix this. \n. as said in the README you have to include the rAF polyfill with IE<=9\n. Yes, you just need to adjust your template. here's an example : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/blob/master/demo/flickr-full/index.html#L85-L95\n. the transition duration is computed here : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/blob/master/src/directives/rn-carousel.js#L216\nthere is an hardcoded timeConstant variable\n. can you please check i new version fixes this ?\n. strange, this looks like a css issue. in the current version, the carousel detects the container width on initialisation. looks like the detected width is not the real one. can you try to log something here : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/blob/master/src/directives/rn-carousel.js#L178 and inspect in your browser to see if there's a difference ? If so you have to find which css rule it comes from.\n. could be cool if you can try if you get the same behaviour with the new version\n. bump.\nif you have a plunker with the reproduced problem i can look at it\n. just add rn-carousel-auto-slide to your ul\n. Hi, what about a little pull request ?\n. should be fixed in the last version\n. in the new version you can create your own indicators easily\n. can you please try with the new version ?\n. ho bad. can you please check in your angular-carousel.js if you have the 'angular-carousel.shifty' module defined ? not sure if its a bower issue or not\n. i'm not a requirejs user so i'm not sure how to resolve this :/ any idea ?\n. about requirejs, some contributor fixed the problem in the 0.3.4 version. can you confirm please ?\n. this is really easy to do with the new version and custom indicators (see demo). just add a ng-if\n. thanks\n. i pushed a refactored version that should work with iOS8 too. \n. yes sorry, the last version (today) hasn't this feature. will add it soon\n. wht do you think about the attribute name rn-carousel-locked  instead of rn-carousel-swipe ?\n. Thanks for reporting and sorry for the breaking changes.\na) yes you just need to give indicators@slides an array with the same number of slides\nb) yes we're limited to ul/li at the moment.\nFor Tweenable this is very annoying. which browser/os ? i dont have this kind of problems using the dist version.\nthe ios issue should be solvd\n. if you can reproduce online i can look deeper\n. a contributor fixed the problem in the 0.3.4 version. can you confirm please ?\n. Yes. can someone help me at this please ? i dont know requirejs :/ ping @jakeauyeung\n. mmm i'm not sure to understand.\nyou mean an horizontal div like this : http://jsbin.com/zosoh/5/ ?\n. I guess you can create a second carousel with a different template that display items 3 by 3 ?\nCould be a could addition to our examples too.\n. it works thanks\n. thanks\n. yes the last release has many breaking changes, sorry for this.\nusing $.css() has a negative perf impact. i think we should find a lighter approach.\nwhat about wrapping the content in in inner div ?\n. just published a release that sets style.cssText instead of style and this should preserve existing styles\n. awesome thanks\n. sorry for this.\nwill try to get relative position working for li's.\n. i don't really get the problem, could be cool to have a sample plunker\n. thanks :heart: \n. yes this has been fixed in a PR 10 minutes ago, thanks for reporting\n. Ho so this was a mistake\n. Hi,\nwhich version do you use ?\n. ok. i pushed a new version a few days ago, it should have better perfo\n. for your index problem, when you say \"sometimes not\" you mean sometimes it stays on the first slide instead of moving to another one ?\nabout the variable height, cant this be done in CSS ? \n. thanks; have you noticed the \"edit\" button on the top-right of any file on github ?\nIt lets you live-edit a file and submit a pull request immediately, which is greatly appreciated :)\n. awesome portfolio you have by the way\n. Here's the process to do the PR :\n- click on README.md\n- click on edit on top right\n- make the changes then save\n- on your own angular-carousel repo, click \u201cpull request\" and submit it\nplease use a conventional name for your commit title, like 'docs(readme): rename slideAndFade to fadeAndSlide\"\nThanks :)\n. nevermind, i fixed it\n. how did you fix it please ?\nim not a requirejs user so any help appreciated\n. didnt saw the PR, thank you\n. @nuong : which carousel version do you use please ?\nthis drives me mad. @jakeauyeung : Tweenable team issued a new version recently so i replaced it... can you please issue a new PR ? thanks\n. thanks a lot\n. Thanks for the detailed report. Will look this after ngEurope :)\n. fixed in 0578ae4c2e4484a81043f3cb64917176fa9f3bd3\n. awesome, thank you\n. have you tried this : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/blob/master/index.html#L53 ?\n. the starts are just an example of a custom indicator.it's quite easy to create your own\n. thanks for the great feature.\nAbout the implementation, what do you think about simply swapping the collection when the index change and let angular update the view ?\nBuffering is based on this principle;\n. Hi, there's no legimate reason to not merge this except i can't maintain this repo anymore.\nIs there anyone willing to become collaborator here, rebase this feature and test that it doesnt break anything?\nThanks\n. Ok this is quite simple; The bare minimum is to merge the most important pull requests, after have checked that it doesnt make any breaking changes. (ex: from the demo page)\nDepending on your time, you can also triage the issues/PR\nOnce merged, you should publish a new version by respecting semantic versionning.\nI'll then publish to bower and npm.\nAvailable for any questions !\n. can you please rebase your code on the last master branch ?\n. example rebase from your fork folder :\nsh\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel.git\ngit fetch\ngit rebase upstream/master\n. Hey Julien, can you contact me on julien@revolunet.com so we can have a real frenchy chat ? thanks\n. Hi, i've remerged all the work done in this fork : https://github.com/dcjohnston/angular-carousel\nIts currently in this branch : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/commits/merge-loop\nWould be great if some of you could test before any release\nthanks to @dcjohnston and @jup31and so sorry for the long delay on this PR but i dont use this project anymore so if some of you want to maintain the project, you're very welcome.\n. Is it possible for you te create a plunker that reproduces the problem ?\n. do you use a dotted name for your model ? eg : ng-model=\"carousel.index\" ?\nthis is mandatory as the ng-repeat creates new scopes and thus store index locally.\ncf http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17606936/angularjs-dot-in-ng-model\n. Strange, i don't have this case in the demo page : http://blog.revolunet.com/angular-carousel/\n. can you provide a sample plunker demonstrating the issue please ?\n. I'm not sure about clientWidth compatibility, look like its not in any W3C specs.\n. did you use rn-carousel-index=\"dot.model\" with the \"dot\" syntax ?\n. You're welcome for reporting issues :)\nI guess we should restore the position to 0 when the collection changes\n. Hi man,\nThe css slightly changed in carousel 0.3+ (much lighter)\ndid you get the last css from the repo ? \nhttps://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/blob/master/dist/angular-carousel.css\n. any plunker around ?\n. yep you need to set your ul height in css \n. looks like its due to the position:relative on the ul. i'll try to find a solution but if you have some time, PR appreciated :)\n. nope we need to find a proper solution\n. having multiple items on a single is really easy, its just a matter of template. group your images in pages :\nsomething like\nhtml\n<ul rn-carousel>\n  <li ng-repeat=\"page in pages\">\n     <img ng-repeat=\"image in page.images\" ng-src=\"image.url\"/>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n. i think i misunderstood sorry.\nsomeone has to implement a new transitionType for this\nthis is done in the computeCarouselSlideStyle function\n. thanks a lot man !\n. yes at the moment this is a static attribute but you could make a PR that uses $observe\n. looks like you're using an old version of the carousel.\nthe new release has it builtin (but there are breaking changes)\n. which carousel version du you use please ?  theres been a recent change on this\n. thanks for a good bug report. will fix\n. not implemented sorry.\nif you want issue a PR :\nwe could add rn-carousel-disable-touch attribute that bypass this line : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/blob/master/src/directives/rn-carousel.js#L226\n. You should filter the data before using it in the carousel, it will make it simpler and more performant\n. Thanks!\n. Sorry, tried without luck !\nTried to run event.stopPropagation() but maybe ngTouch + carousel + jquery draggable doesnt play well together.\nThis may not fix it but maybe try somehting lighter : https://github.com/fatlinesofcode/ngDraggable\n. mmm works well in the demo page : http://blog.revolunet.com/angular-carousel/ . do you have any example ?\n. did you try ? it should work :)\n. yep you need to share an index with the indicators :\nadd this to rn-carousel-indicators\nslides=\"slides\" rn-carousel-index=\"carouselIndex\"\nslides can be [0, 0, 0] i guess (just an array to know how many slides you have)\n. also add rn-carousel-index=\"carouselIndex\" to the carousel and expose that index in the scope\n. maybe its not implemented, not sure. will try to add a demo.\n. Thanks. for some reason i missed that cool PR.\nLooks there's a debugger statement left. can you please remove it and rebase on master ?\nThanks\n. duplicate of #254 would love a PR on this, i'm not a requirejs user\n. great, thanks\n. thanks\n. thanks\nnever tried this yet. what happens if we use bindonce at the moment ?\n. good catch thanks !\nmaybe we can find a way to keep it in the ngRepeat expression and not use it for the array.\n. thanks !\n. Really cool Thank you\n. did you try to use the \"dot notation\" for your model, eg data.carouselndex.\nthis is considered best practice when using angular.\nwhy ? because of this : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17606936/angularjs-dot-in-ng-model\n. hey, very cool addition, thank you !\nis it possible to keep the current demo style ? there is now a white background and some indicators are white too (so invisible) this is a bit confusing\nthanks !\n. Hey,\nI think #257 is not a good way to do, he should prepare the data before and not use ng-if inside the carousel itself\nThe most annoying bug is the shifty requirejs integration : #270 #265 #254 #218\n. Thanks for the report;\nCan you please issue a pull request ?\n. the tests have been disabled in the last rewrite :/\n. i dont have much time to add the tests but PR are very welcome :)\n. merged manually, thank you\n. Will do\n. ready : https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-carousel\ntell me if it fits your needs\n. done, thanks\n. Hi\nDid you try with including the rn-carousel.css ?\nhttps://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/blob/master/dist/angular-carousel.css\n. the basic positionning/layout is defined in this css and should be namespaced and overridable\n. yeah ! thanks a lot !\n. hi, does the demo page works on your chrome ? http://blog.revolunet.com/angular-carousel/\n. Hey, nice addition thanks, but looks like you didnt work on the last master version ?\ncan you rebase please ?\n. looks like some code is missing. \nfrom your branch you should :\nsh\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel.git\ngit fetch upstream\ngit rebase upstream/master\ngit push\n. looks like there is additional code, apart from the templateCache stuff ?\n. As stated on the readme, this repo is not maintained anymore, sorry. Feel free to fork !. thx\n. thanks man !\n. Hi, sorry this only works with strings at the moment... do you really need this to be dynamic ?\n. @EAndreyF : did you try this PR ?\n. sorry all for the delay. btw, this project is looking for maintainers if you're interested, just ping me\n. sorry just repushed 0.3.12 with the fix\n. Thanks.\nCant you use scope[iAttributes.rnCarouselOnInfiniteScrollRight]() instead of eval(\"scope.\" + iAttributes.rnCarouselOnInfiniteScrollRight) ?\nOr even better, use $parse(iAttributes.rnCarouselOnInfiniteScrollRight)(scope) ?\n. also please remove the console.log\n. thanks and sorry for the delay\n. i won't be able to work on this but i hope some contributors will :)\n. and yes, slick is awesome\n. sorry, done, thanks\n. well this is just a matter of template. if you organize your data it should be easy.\nhere's a non-working exampe but gives you the idea : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/blob/master/demo/flickr-full/index.html#L85-L95\n. :+1: thanks\n. thanks Scott, can you please also add the information in the README ?\n. agree\n. merged, thank you\n. +1\n. thanks but not needed at the moment\n. nice except there's a little flickering due to the watch i guess\n. thanks !\n. done\n. nice, thanks, can you please add to the info to the README too ?\n. Ok. i'll do the README update.\nI think the naming \"can loop\" is confusing because it applies only to the prev/next controls, not the swipe itself.\nCould you please rename to \"rnCarouselControlsAllowLoop\" ?\n. looks good to me thanks :)\nthe final step would be to rebase your 5 commits in a single one\n-  make a backup : git branch backup\n-  git rebase HEAD~6 \"fixup\" the commits until the first one\n-  write the single commit message\n  if all is ok then you can push --force\nthanks !\n. that's great, thanks man !\n. still using bower on this projet. not sure if its a good idea to duplicate dependencies to package.json ?\n. i don't, its just historical :) you're welcome to submit a PR to remove it if you will\nThanks\n. Hey. No much time to work on this currently, sorry about that :/\nMy first guess is to check when happens here : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/blob/master/src/directives/rn-carousel.js#L161-L167\nis the ng-repeat expression correctly parsed and valid ?\nPR much appreciated (this repo is looking for contributors :))\n. I'm just a developer too :)\nWhat are the step to reproduce ? simply bower update?\n. Thanks @cedricblondeau \n. mmm i dont see any reference to carousel here.\nBTW this error may come from the shifty.js require.js integration\n. what happened ?\n. if you arrange your images by \"page\" you can do it. in this example i was displaying multiples items at once : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/blob/master/demo/flickr-full/index.html#L85-L95\n. did you add angular-touch.js as mentioned in the README ?\n. ok, please provide a plunker with reproduction possible\n. thank you\n. Hi, there is a tentative here : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/pull/237\ni recently merged that work into the \"merge-loop\" branch i'd appreciate if some of you could test that branch and give feedback, thanks\n. oops, sorry and thanks for reporting... just fixed it :)\n. Nice addition thank you :) can you please also add the doc to the README ?\n. Cool move thank you\n. i think the repeatCollection should be the final, filtered expression souldn't it ? so you get the order you asked in the carousel\ncan you please test with this change ? https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/commit/0f2b303b37b631461881cab3ddfab1a7dc46a356\n. Thanks. i dont really have time to maintain this project anymore so if you want to become contributor you're welcome :)\n. well if you wanna improve the project i think there's a few issues and PR that need review/comments :)\n. thank you, appreciated\n. Good news !\nAbout the current loop implementation proposed here : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/pull/237/files\nI'm not a big fan of it; i think we can have a simpler approach by slicing directly the input ngRepeat, what do you think ?\n. Thank you, a small but important fix\n. works here, which npm version/os do you have ?\n```\n$ npm install angular-carousel\ncarousel@1.0.0 /Users/juju/Desktop/tmp/carousel\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 angular-carousel@1.0.1  extraneous\nnpm WARN EPACKAGEJSON carousel@1.0.0 No description\nnpm WARN EPACKAGEJSON carousel@1.0.0 No repository field.\n```\n. all good :+1: \n. Thanks for your suggestion and feedback :) If you have an example code to share, this may be helpful to others... thanks :)\n. Thanks for sharing the workaround\nIn the current code : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/blob/master/src/directives/rn-carousel.js#L389 the rn-carousel-auto-slide attribute expects an integer value at initialisation and cannot be changed later because it use an infinite interval function. Making it tweakable at each interval implies to change that $interval to a recurring $timeout that could evaluate the rn-carousel-auto-slide attribute at each timeout using the $parse function (to be able to read the attribute value in the current scope).\n. Hey, thanks for the contribution !\nIsn't wrap the same as allow-loop ?\n. hey guys, yes, unless someone with good expertise can take the relay, because i'm not much into angular anymore, and lack time for maintenance... good luck\n. thanks\n. Well i dont have time to maintain this project anymore but if you find a way to pass that duration as an extra attribute, this can be merged\n. Hi ! Thanks for reporting !\nsorry i can't maintain this lib anymore but if someone is motivated, i can give contributors access after a first PR :)\n. Thank you!\nCan you please confirm all the demo examples are still working ?\n. Thanks\n. I'd be happy to review and merge this improvement ;)\n. not builtin sorry but you could have something like carouselIndex=images.length initialy ?\n. transitions are defined by JS, a few examples here : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/blob/master/src/directives/rn-carousel.js#L75\n. nice thanks !. \ud83d\udc4d . il me semble que cela peut aussi s'\u00e9crire comme ceci : \niElement[0].childNodes.filter(function(x) { return x.tagName === \"LI\"  }). argh ok bien vu :). pour info, il faut \u00e9diter dans le dossier \"src\", le dossier \"dist\" est un fichier \"compil\u00e9\"\n. nb: je cherche des mainteneurs sur ce projet, il y a pas mal de PRs en attente de review et je ne peux pas m'en occuper... . looks good !. Hi, sorry i cannot maintain the projet anymore :/ 800+ items means thousands of watchers which is not very angular-friendly\ndo you use the \"buffered\" option ?. fixed in 4c9c2761103636db41c2ef3c98bf8e0a53ad9904\n. strange, dont have this here.\ndo you encounter the same on the demo : http://blog.revolunet.com/angular-carousel/ ?\nwhich browser ? its webkit only at the moment\n. can you please update to the last version too\ncheers & thanks for reporting\n. you're right i should change that quickly. what about \n- rn-carousel\n- revo-carousel\n- revolunet-carousel\n- touch-carousel \n  ?\n. thanks :)\n. you're right, at the moment, the container size is determined at sartup byt the first li size.\nwe should rely on css.\n. Here's how it works at the moment, maybe you can have some ideas to help resolve this :\n 1) We add a wrapper div around your UL so we only display one slide at a time.\n 2) That wrapper size is then determined from the size of the first LI detected and set as an inline style.\n(the UL/LI blocks are transformed in a very long single line)\nSolutions :\n- listen to orientationchange event and update the container size from the first LI\n- add autosize=true|false attribute to the directive so that we dont do size detection based on the LI but rather let you control that using your own CSS. (there is already a .rn-carousel-container CSS class.)\nAny comments ?\n. should be fixed now, we update the carousel size when we detect orientationchange\n. weird... i'll remove that. depending on the viewport meta tag i had some pixels so tried that but this is stupid.\n. added in 8ef09e5cedcaa15d21d77fdd34988f7089857941\n. strange, working fine here with your syntax, provided you have enough \"pages\".\nadding some tests today.\nand thanks for reporting\n. can this be closed ?\n. woot :) that's awesome thank you.\nthis will make testing a lot easier\n. merged from the command line, thanks a ton !\n. its still in the angular source : https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/src/ngMobile/swipe.js but can't find it in the distribution on code.angularjs.org !\n. its not even in the snapshot distribution :/\n. faire une version build avec images en local\n. http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=luxury%20appartement\n. fixed in 2666db82486c1a0e0e8b5948f7607c04fc84910a\n. any online version we can test ?\ndo you use the DOM buffer feature ?\n. Thanks fot he plnkr.\nFYI i think fastclick is not needed when using angular-mobile. ngClick is overidden to handle tap events here.\nNever had a chance to play with FireBase yet but did you try the same with a 'static' dataset ?\nDoes swiping 'fast' makes a difference ?\n. You're right the deep watch has a perf cost and is useless in your case (big static data). just added an issue and pushed a fix : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/issues/18\nplnkr is mega slow here tonight so i'll experiment with my devices tomorrow\n. i dont see any issue on the nexus4 nor ipad\n. ho yeah nice :) and don't you want to sync the two carousels ? original and traduction ?\n. can you please test with the last version ?\n. tried with motorola xoom 1 : after resuming the app, using another coming back... everything is ok.\nclosed the device, returned one day later, app still working fine\nis it text to speech ? works nicely !\nthe only issue is that when you swipe quickly, it never stops and plays all slides and we cant stop/reset it :)\n. thanks for reporting; the component.json is indeed outdated. i have to see how to \"bowerise\" the ngMobile module which is included in angular 1.1.4 and up.\nI updated the README though.\n. fixed. the real bower package name at the moment is \"angular-rn-carousel\".\n. Yes. this is a good question. should the getNext/getPrev modify the original collection, or not....\n. The models (real ngrepeat and carousel content) are now synchronized. \nthere's still an issue if you prepend items to the original collection, which offsets the carousel.\n. the prev/next callbacks have been removed in the new version.you can manipulate the original collection directly.\n. fixed in https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/commit/4900e8964cd4dcfdc657d9c848a5338b24c97114\n. duplicate of #5 \n. you can easily create your own indicator :\nhtml\n<ul rn-carousel rn-carousel-index=\"index\"><li ng-repeat=\"item in items\">...</li></ul>\n<div>{{ index }} / {{ items.length }}</div>\nany other idea ?\n. @ManuelColombo you mean when you click an indicator to switch to given slide ?\n. i should implement directive controller pattern\n. Hi guys, FYI, a new refactored version has been pushed, and support clickable indicators.\nThere's a demo with custom controls and thumbnail navigation...\nSo basically, for a custom indicator you just need to bind the rn-carousel-index :)\n. you're right, never tried with objects (but i will)\n. if you have short deadlines, convert your structure to array :)\ni'll try to give a shot this week anyway...\n. i added a rn-carousel-watch attribute, please test and tell me if it helps.\n(not compatible with rn-carousel-cycle)\n. Yes, tried various strategies with no luck yet.\nThe ng-click is independant from the swipe that dont deals with clicks but mouseup/mousedown instead, so we cannot cancel any click here...\n. angular 1.2 forward the $event in $swipe service so we should be able to cancel it : https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/507d8021b1c91cc0cefc0418e61b04597ad1030b\n. see #53\n. this works with the rn-carousel-index binding\n. which error, details, traceback ?\n. you need to use the angular-mobile included in my dist folder, the official angular version does not include the swipe service for some reason....\n. which example are you testing ? looks fine here\n. yes, sorry this is WIP and theres a pending commit here, should land soon, thank you for your help\n. this has been merged manually along with another fix. thanks @Dolmio \n. thanks for reporting. should this be included in the default CSS ?\n. thanks !\n. should be fixed in b7d15aace22cac8946708cbef2914a672de5d4fd\n. I don't think so, this one is focused for mobile :)\nBTW Opera should run WebKit so it should work too\n. see #42 \n. Do you use the last version (from 12/07) ? there's been a flickering introduced in a version just before but it should have been fixed since\n. I think it comes from this line : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/blob/master/dist/angular-carousel.js#L136\ntry replacing it with :\ncarousel.css(translateSlideProperty(getTransformCoordinates(carousel[0]), true));\n. does this happens only on the infinite carousel ?\n. this should be fixed now, can you confirm please ?\n. I just pushed a fix and removed the 2D support for the moment. It was to prevent the blurry effect on some devices but can't reproduce it yet. tell me if its better for you. tested on Ipad and Nexus4 + desktop\n. thanks\n. good idea :)\nif the code doesnt find the ngRepeat, but find some  childs, then it should add the rn-carousel-slides css class to them directly. this could work directly.\n. you can try the puredom branch and tell me if it works nice for you\n. bump\n. merged !\n. i guess the first thing would be to change the transform/translate3D CSS. For example you could use absolute left positionning instead of translate.\n. First check that the swipe events are correctly handled.\nThen update the CSS code\nYou know bootstrap-ui has a nice carousel right ?\n. i guess the first thing would be to change the transform/translate3D CSS. For example you could use absolute left positionning instead of translate.\n. use rn-carousel-index binding; you could use localStorage or cookies to store/reload the position.\n. Hi @vergnes ; thanks for noticing this and the detailed report.\nI had some flickering on iPad and i remember this fixed it, but not 100% sure. i'll find it out later today and tell you\n. just checked on iPad and yes, without that trick there is some flickering.\nYou can try that on the demo page with a standard safari browser and remove the CSS property from the inspector.\nI don't know why but it happens when you touch the slide to swipe it, you get a little flickering at the start of the movement (on the first movement transform:translate3d). then the movement makes no more flickering. any idea ?\n. thanks\n. Thanks Kevin, that's great. \nCan you just please fix my 2 comments and push --force on your branch ?\n. I've just merged another pending request so please rebase your branch before with \"git fetch upstream && g\u00eet rebase upstream/master\"\nThanks\n. replaced in favor of https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/pull/54\n. aren't $routeParams readonly ?\n. Thanks !\nCan you please explain which flickr you had and on which devices ?\n. what do you mean?\n. done, tell me if its ok, im not bower expert\n. thanks for reporting\n. the new version dropped carouselCollection so this should not be an issue anymore\n. Absolutely right, Thank you\n. sorry for the huge delay; just pushed a new refactored verson that works on angular 1.2.7\n. Hi, thanks\nYou mean scroll vertically inside one of the carousel items ?\nNever tried but it should definitely do it :)\nIt doesnt work ?\n. good news, so you can close this issue :)\n. should work in the version\n. which device ? works fine here\n. does the demo page work on your S4 ? http://blog.revolunet.com/angular-carousel\n. angular mobile provides the swipe service which you can use to listen start/move/end events\n. on the carousel itself, you can watch the \"index\", just use rn-carousel-index=\"indexValue\" and init it at 0 for the first slide\n. @sirair was using an older version. see #92 for a propable solution\n. i guess this is a CSS issue; \nThe official demo works fine.\nBTW carousel not ready yet for angular 1.2 :/ (there are some pending pull requests)\n. Thanks for reporting; I dont have this behaviour here. Device ? angular version ?\nSame behaviour on demo page : http://blog.revolunet.com/angular-carousel ?\n. yep. also looks like $swipe service doesnt send the touchend event in some cases\n. workin on it\n. just pushed a fix, can you please check ?\nit may have some perf impacts though.\n. ok. i guess you mean \"the problem still exists\" :)\nDo you have the same problem on carousel without indicators ? (this may be the cause)\n. You can check this maybe : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/issues/42#issuecomment-26045426\nI wish someone could make a PR with a clean IE<10 support, without needing jQuery\n. not yet implemented, sorry :/ This should be a setting for the \"carouselCollection\" service.\nthis service is just a helper to handle the buffer, cycling of cards... but it needs improvements.\n. you can do it using rn-carousel-index databinding\n. Hi. In the new refactored version , the default buffer is now 5 items.\n. Hi Andy :) Wow that sounds awesome thank you !\nI'll check that in the next few days, good timing for the refactoring in progress :)\n. nope i just didnt need it with the last refactor\n. from my POV yes but maybe our buddy @ajoslin have another idea...\n. the scroll implementation is quite naive :\n1) detect the support prefix if any \nhttps://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/blob/master/src/directives/rn-carousel.js#L366-L374\n2) apply it when needed https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/blob/master/src/directives/rn-carousel.js#L184\ni dont see how we can make this simpler/lighter\n. little guy ?\n. thanks guys ! \n@ajoslin : so when do you join Tobias ? :p\n. :+1: \n. i just pushed a complete refactored version. could you check if this is fixed please ? thanks\n. works for me\n. Not much time to work on it yet sorry :/ Im not sure what samsung did on their last series about the 3d transitions.\nAlso i should implement requestAnimationFrame here to limit the animations.\n@bondaestudi : you have slow perf on iPhone 5 ?\n. I just pushed a new version with different animations that should play better with various devices thanks to requestAnimationFrame. its smooth here. would be nice if you could check again and tell me if its better. thanks guys.\n. will check that thanks\n. @kconragan ive invesitgated on my nexus4+chrome. For some reason, the slower you move the slide, the slower are the FPS, which i really don't understand yet. do you feel the slowness or is it only the FPS that bugs you ? I experience the same behaviour on chrome desktop too. i'd appreciate  an explanation of this phenomen :)\n. thanks @NathanWalker ! very appreciated. I'll make a full review+tests this week and try to merge it manually. stay tuned :)\n. @8enmann I will have some time next week to integrate various PRs and work on some refactor, thanks for your patience.\n. ok now that 1.2 is released, i'll merge this to master soon. thanks guys\n. Hi guys, sorry for the delay, had some timing warp issues lately :/\nI've just pushed a refactored version of the carousel, which is lighter and easier to read and maintain. so this PR won't fit in, sorry for this.\nThe indicators are not yet available in the new version but this will be easy to implement. BTW the indicators/carousel implem should work using the directives 'require' and 'controller' pattern.\n. just pushed optional clickable carousel indicators. thanks guys\n. Setting font-size:0 to the container should prevent this behaviour\n. thanks @abaran and sorry for the late update. this have been implemented in https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/pull/67\n. Thanks @munro :) By curiosity, in which browsers do you see this behaviour ?\n. Ok thanks i'll check it. Chrome is known to handle subpixel rendering correctly though...\n. thanks. i finally removed this complexity from the carousel in the new version. it was a big overhead for not much.\n. sorry for the delay. just pushed a big refactor so this issue should not be revelant anymore. please check and reopen the issue if still a problem. thanks guys\n. there's been a big refactor so i'll close this issue for now. can you please try again with the new version and reopen if you still have the same problem ? a test case could help :)\nThanks\n. @pico7 : \"From Angular Site (after clicking on the link in the console)\" can you give me an url that demonstrates the problem ?\n. you must have a fixed size container and you can put any image inside. maybe use a css background-size:cover to cove the whole space with your image\n. the new version should have this fixed. can you confirm please ?\n. i've just pushed a refactored version, sorry for the delay. i advise you to set the size of the slides in CSS so it can compute it before. thanks\n. thanks. updated in the new version\n. you can add a binding to rn-carousel-index and use a $watch in your controller to detect when it changes\n. oops, thank you :)\n. at the moment there's no enabled mode :/\n. mmm. not sure. a dirty workaround would be to use ng-switch to alternate between static content and the carousel\n. I think this has been implemented in this change : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/commit/9d53957f4b1cb95d755c55e76aec5c370af58684 with the rn-carousel-swipe attribute\n. Hi Nathan,\nThe demo works well with the cases mentionned so i'm not sure about your issue.\nhttp://blog.revolunet.com/angular-carousel/\nDo you use jQuery ?\nYou include ngTouch ?\nAny error in the console ?\nIs there a live non-working example somewhere ?\n. thanks. if you have something interesting, please shar e:)\n. i'll look at it; thanks for your help\n. Hi, thanks for reporting. At the moment we compute the width from the first child on init (or when collection changes) We need this to apply the correct transformation and this implies that all the slides have the same width, which is obvious i guess. If you have some suggestions...\n. yes, this was the case before, i'll add onresize\n. thank you, appreciated !\n. the window resizing has been fixed\nfor @gsklee issue... i don't have any idea at the moment\n. there's been a PR on this subject : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/pull/137\nwhat do you think about it guys ? can you test if it fixes your issues ?\n. if anyone here can make a little plnkr to demonstrate the issue it could help fix it on my open source day\n. hey there, been really busy here... but i would be very happy to have others maintainers here.\n. mmmm. ng-if creates a sub-scope so assigning a value without a dot inside the carousel does not propagate upwards. classic.\nif you use ng-if or anything that add scope nesting, you need to use dotted notation for your ngModel if you want it propagated.\neg: rn-carousel-index=\"demo.carouselIndex\". i'll add a demo with that tonight\n. mmm check the last example it uses an ngif\n. Thanks. for some reason, on tablet, resize AND orientationchange are fired. any idea how to prevent this ?\n. thanks\n. thanks buddy\n. i don't have this behaviour... possible to make a plnkr demo please ?\n. you mean with a binding ?\n. Ok thanks @gaku, appreciated :) so you had this behaviour using multiple template based carousels ?\n. Argh. The new verison use requestAnimationFrame and this isn't supported on older Androids :/\nIt would be very nice if you could try with this polyfill included in your page and tell me how it goes. Just include it before the angular code : https://github.com/darius/requestAnimationFrame/blob/master/requestAnimationFrame.js\nthanks for reporting\n. Ok thank you, nice to know. maybe i should include the polyfill.\nIs it \"smooth\" enough ?\n. thanks for the report :)\n. i don't even understand what that really means. thanks for being so explicit\n. this has been fixed in af99eaf92c7285c2c689bac7556ad33a70b448c1\n. @PascalPrecht we need to remove the preventDefault https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/blob/master/src/directives/rn-carousel.js#L301-L302\n. this have been removed in the last version (merge 2 days ago), can you please check its now ok ?\n. thanks for your feedback\n. Hi @JumpLink and thank you. \nDon't you think this should be a binded property so we can dynamically activate/deactivate the swipe ?\n. awesome, thank you @JumpLink i've just rebased and merged manually :)\n. Hey @fastfrwrd thanks for the changes, looks good to me.\nThe pseudo-elements for the indicators and controls are a good idea.\nCould you please remove the vendor-prefix from the sass and just use standard SCSS ? grunt-autoprefixer takes care of adding necessary vendors which make the scss source more readable and allows vendors customisation at build time.\nThanks for your help.\n@JumpLink : any suggestion ?\n. also thanks for the tests which were dying since my last refactor :/\nonce this little changes made i'll merge manually \n. yep that's cool, we'll add some info about how to override this in the README\n. thanks @fastfrwrd i merged it with some little changes, hope its ok for you ;\n- in the scss, removed the padding-bottom from the carousel-container and used relative positionning for the indicators\n- in the controls, renamed \"back\" to \"prev\" to stay with the prev/next naming\nworks great thanks !\n. here's a way to do it before someone implement it right inside the directive :\n- add a rn-carousel-index binding ot the carousel\n- from your controller, increment this model using $interval\n. bump?\n. thanks man\n. thanks this is great; so i just need to grunt changelog to update the changelog ?\n. ok thanks man !\n. looks like i MUST use the \"v\" prefix in my releases tag names, right ?\n. thanks @PascalPrecht will do it now :)\n. duplicate of #94 \n. should be a dedicated directive role\n. thanks, updated the README in 18834b740b3dbea6e337fe26679cde4a613e822c\n. ngTouch is the new name of the module\nyour issue is quite unreadable (please read https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) , or, could you please provide a correct diff ?\n. thanks dude. FYI you can add \"diff\", \"javascript\" or any syntax after the three backticks for better coloring\n. ngMobile has been rename to ngTouch about 6 months ago : https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/94ec84e7b9c89358dc00e4039009af9e287bbd05\n. you're right my bad; will fix now\n. If you read the README, you can see that you need to include the requestAnimationFrame polyfill.\n. thanks buddy, welcome :+1: \n. i thinks thi has been implemented here : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/commit/9d53957f4b1cb95d755c55e76aec5c370af58684\n. thanks for your help dude, could you just please : \n- rebase and squash your commits and use a standard commit message\n- let the dist files, gitignore and CSS as is\n- add a note about this new attribute in the README ?\nthen you'll be the perfect contributor :)\nThank you\n. Hi the indicators are clickable on the demo page so quite strange...\nAny live example ?\n. bump ?\n. @bradparker : any news on this ?\n. should have been fixed in af99eaf92c7285c2c689bac7556ad33a70b448c1 can you please confirm ?\n. the new attribute name is rn-carousel-locked \n. @jeevanpalakurty : do you have the problem with the last example in the demo : http://blog.revolunet.com/angular-carousel/ ?\n. thanks for reporting. this may be something with touchcancel; will try to get a test device.\n. you can watch the rn-carousel-index property\n. no hook for this at the moment sorry\n. which iOS du you use ? \nfrom the readme :\n\nNOTE : if you use iOS<7 or Android<4 please include the requestAnimationFrame polyfill in your application.\n. ok sorry 7, didnt notice the title. lol\n. OK thanks, looks good to me. Could you please issue a PR with that fix and a conventionnal commit message : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/edit#\n\nthanks\n. awesome thanks man !\n. Thanks for reporting this issue and have made the plunker.\nLooks like there is a problem with the width detection. We need to get the carousel width at initiatlisation so we can apply the correct translation. Maybe this could be achieved using % in the future.\nAnyone could try this please ?\njs\nif (containerWidth===0 && carousel[0].parentNode) {\n    containerWidth = carousel[0].parentNode.getBoundingClientRect().width;\n}\nthis should be added at the end of the getCarouselWidth() function, just before the return\n. thanks; I've changed a bit the code and more important, applies the changes to the source, not the distribution version :) Also squashed and reworded your commit message an merges manually.\n. thanks. squashed and renamed your commmit and merges manually\n. maybe the new version could help you here. the animation part is separated in a service so you can fully control how single slides are rendered based on number of slides and current offset;\n. you mean a scrollable div ? with -webkit-overflow-scroll:touch ?\n. yep, removed because it as too messy\n. Hi, i think you should take the time to read the 5th line of the readme :)\n. another merged PR have implemented this feature recently\n. Thanks for reporting this in details. We add the preventDefault before but removed it to allow vertical page scrolling while also swiping the carousel horizontally.\n. Sorry for the delay.\nTesting has been disabled in the last refactor and this should be fixed...\nAbout your change, can't this be done in pure css ? :first-child :last-child pseudo-selectors ?\nAlso, FYI angular expose $first and $last in the ng-repeat scope\n. Thanks for your answers;\nAbout the ngRepeat variables i just meant you could use :\njs\nfirst: $first,\nlast: $last\nYes if CSS can make the same work i imagine is a bit less expensive, bust this is a blind assumption\nHave a good day :)\n. thanks for your feedback Emanuel !\n. thanks a lot @othermore . i'll look at this closely.\nany reason why you re-imported the \"preventDefault\" and \"stopPropagation\" ?\n. thanks guys for these great improvements.\nMy comments :\n- the has3d function should definitely called only once and not on each move. So please make the detection at initialization time and only once. around here : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/blob/master/src/directives/rn-carousel.js#L378-L387\nThen for the PR, could you please :\n- remove raf.js from the bower dependencies; as it should only affect IE users, they will add it manually. right ? if so this need to be more explicit in the README \n- squash your changes in a single commit using the angular commit messages convention (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/edit#)\nthanks for this great improvements !\n. @onesime : about the polyfill, the README actually advise this one : https://github.com/darius/requestAnimationFrame/blob/master/requestAnimationFrame.js\nis it the good one ? (looks like more recent the paul one)\n. thanks for your changes this is a really useful feature.\ndon't you think we can simply skip the \"iAttributes.rnCarouselIe9support\" and just use the correct translate property based on the has3d detection ?\n. i've removed it in 0.2.1 so any non-css3d browser will use css2d. does this sounds good to you ?\n. thanks a lot for the fix !\n. has been merged manually\n. i've just pushed a new tag on bower (0.2.1). can you confirm its now ok ?\nthanks\n. i merged a commit 2 days ago that may be related (or not) and its not in bower yet.\nany way for you to test with that change : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/commit/f1c98fef52f1ea540e5ed55eb2219176e0f98f3d ?\n. closing old issues\n. thanks for reporting this. when this fix applied do we still need the requestAnimationFrame polyfill for iOS 6  ?\n. just added it manually thank you !\n. this round has been added here : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/issues/70\nand yes this cause issue with non-integer containers...so let's merge this thank you\n. Hi Remy, thanks for this interesting change.\nDon't you think we should only start a setTimeout after any resize event, then cancel it when the size is considered stable ?\n. in the next version, the slides will fit to the container size using % instead of pixels to hopefully prevent the size detection and associated \"complexity\"\n. cool change, thank you\n. merged the fix, thanks\n. great thank you !\n. not working vertically at the moment, but good idea for a PR :)\n. Hi, do you have any demo plunker so i can see the problem ?\n. thanks @lucwastiaux please close if issue solved\n. Hi\nYes you can its just a question of template.\nThere is an example demo here : blog.revolunet.com/angular-carousel/demo/flickr-full/index.html\nMaybe i should add an example in the main page.\n. hi. Mmmm ok flickr link is broken. Any way in the HTML you have the source for multi-items. it's just a trick in the template, you display n items at once in a single \"li\" block\n. Yep makes sense but not implemented\n. thanks Ben !\n. thanks\n. Hi, depending on your Android version (see README) you should add the requestAnimationFrame polyfill. did you try this ?\n. bump ?\n. thanks for feedbach @halyburton \n. should be easy with the new version, you have full control on the indicators\n. strange :/ do you have any error reported ? do you use the last version ?\n. should be fixed in last version\n. thanks !\n. in your controller you could add a watch to the index given in rn-carousel-index which is updated when slide is changed\n. Hi, not yet but this would be very cool... have to work on it :)\n. Hi.\nThis should be an effect of some CSS (margin/padding/border).\nDo you have a live example ?\n. thanks for the feedback\n. ?\n. carousel only works with same size slides at the moment :/\nyou should make sure all the slides have the same size and maybe use background-size: cover to make the background fit\n. in the next version, the slides will be constrained to the container size\n. No ETA yet, sorry\n. thank you but the polyfill ias described in the README\n. No worry thanks for helping :)\n. thanks for reporting, will add this\n. included in last release\n. in the next version the slides height will be at maximum the container height (overflow hidden)\n. thanks man \n. thanks this has been merged manually\n. did you try using the Polyfill noted in the README ?\nIt should already handle the fallback, doesn't it ?\n. Hey @milica thanks for the feedback.\nAs said in the project README, requestAnimationFrame polyfill is not included by default and you should add it manually if needed.\n. thanks\n. hi thanks for reporting\ncurrently we're using builtin angular ngTouch module and this may cause the issue.\none workaround you can try : manually remove the ngClick directive from ngTouch module. I guess this can be the cause.\nplease confirm\n. is 3000x5000 the device resolution ? its huge !\nresizing images in the browser have a big impact on perfs\n. Yep carousel works with any kind of content but i dont get why canvas perf could be better; Its already GPU accelerated with the CSS3d transformations.\nNot using \"cover\" should help increase perfo.\nMaybe try in a empty page outside of the ionic context too\n. could be interesting to have an isolated example with these giant images to benchmark/analyse\n. btw, this document could be useful if you report other issues somewhere : https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/\n. Thanks for reporting and sorry for the delay.\nDo you see any real world use case for the auto-hide attribute to be observed ? i guess it could be a simple boolean that conditionally adds (or not) the indicator when initializing the carousel ?\n. thanks for reporting.\nI planned a way to have a dynamic load of additional slides on prev/next but didnt found a correct solution to this yet.\nFeel free to propose solutions if you have some :)\n. Thanks\nOn $destroy, you should also make sure to remove any listener you've set manually.\nBTW, we should find a way to not be dependant on the carousel-indicators\n. @rodrigoreis22 : true\n. mmm the doc does not clearly says it removes the event. it says you're responsible of the cleanup, right ?\nLooks like there's some kind of events removal on the element itself on $destroy here though: https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/c61626f10dc0b7913d7af59dcb0612f168327e60/src/jqLite.js#L259\nnice to know you don't like what has been achieved here :)\n. Thanks for your work @CosticaPuntaru, this is a great addition !\nI agree that the carousel definitely needs another rewrite :)\n. thanks for reporting, just pushed an update\n. you mean {{ slideIndex }} ?\n. try this:\n- remove your custom li\n- add a fake item at the end of your items \n- add an ng-if=\"$index==$last\" in your li template that display the alternative content\n. Hi !\nRTL is not supported yet but i'd be pleased to assist you implement it.\nI'm not aware of CSS RTL capabilities.\n. Ok i have to play a bit with this tonight because RTL is a new thing for me :)\n. looks like it won't be easy as-is.\nthis feature should be part of an upcoming rewrite.\none workaround :\n- order your items in the ng-repeat in reverse order\n- set \"rn-carousel-index\" attribute to the slides length on start :)\n. say your slides are defined in the json node array slides. just get the length with slides.length.\nto reverse a javascript array you just have to do slides.reverse()\n. if you use rn-carousel-bufferef, only 5 slides are loaded at once\n. /cc @CosticaPuntaru\n. this has been fixed in the last version\n. just some time to review, rebase and merge, sorry :/ will dive into these days\n. hi\ni pushed an updated version that should make this easier\n. Sorry i don't get your problem guys.. any plunker ?\n. thanks. in you plunker, you should put rn-carousel-index=\"slideIndex\" on the UL not the LI\n. @gabberr you should not set rn-carousel-container yourself, the carousel adds it itself\n. the new version has simpler css so this shouldnt be an issue anymore\n. Hi. Yes this is not easy with the current implementation but someone made it : http://blog.revolunet.com/blog/2013/05/02/angular-carousel-making-of/#comment-1417657730\n. Thanks, great fix, looks good to me :)\n. in fact this is based on a quite old version so i merged it manually, thanks\n. thanks, i implemented this on the new version : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/commit/6ff425daa389a7b9ba5138a740f14fa1dd0e05fe\nthis is a bit more complicated because the $watchCollection simply don't work correctly https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/2621 i didnt find a better way\n. should be fixed in last version\n. should be really easy to implement in the new version, see the demo example\n. yes the new version should fix this. can yo confirm?\n. in the new version, use \"rn-carousel-transition='none'\" should fix this. \n. as said in the README you have to include the rAF polyfill with IE<=9\n. Yes, you just need to adjust your template. here's an example : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/blob/master/demo/flickr-full/index.html#L85-L95\n. the transition duration is computed here : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/blob/master/src/directives/rn-carousel.js#L216\nthere is an hardcoded timeConstant variable\n. can you please check i new version fixes this ?\n. strange, this looks like a css issue. in the current version, the carousel detects the container width on initialisation. looks like the detected width is not the real one. can you try to log something here : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/blob/master/src/directives/rn-carousel.js#L178 and inspect in your browser to see if there's a difference ? If so you have to find which css rule it comes from.\n. could be cool if you can try if you get the same behaviour with the new version\n. bump.\nif you have a plunker with the reproduced problem i can look at it\n. just add rn-carousel-auto-slide to your ul\n. Hi, what about a little pull request ?\n. should be fixed in the last version\n. in the new version you can create your own indicators easily\n. can you please try with the new version ?\n. ho bad. can you please check in your angular-carousel.js if you have the 'angular-carousel.shifty' module defined ? not sure if its a bower issue or not\n. i'm not a requirejs user so i'm not sure how to resolve this :/ any idea ?\n. about requirejs, some contributor fixed the problem in the 0.3.4 version. can you confirm please ?\n. this is really easy to do with the new version and custom indicators (see demo). just add a ng-if\n. thanks\n. i pushed a refactored version that should work with iOS8 too. \n. yes sorry, the last version (today) hasn't this feature. will add it soon\n. wht do you think about the attribute name rn-carousel-locked  instead of rn-carousel-swipe ?\n. Thanks for reporting and sorry for the breaking changes.\na) yes you just need to give indicators@slides an array with the same number of slides\nb) yes we're limited to ul/li at the moment.\nFor Tweenable this is very annoying. which browser/os ? i dont have this kind of problems using the dist version.\nthe ios issue should be solvd\n. if you can reproduce online i can look deeper\n. a contributor fixed the problem in the 0.3.4 version. can you confirm please ?\n. Yes. can someone help me at this please ? i dont know requirejs :/ ping @jakeauyeung\n. mmm i'm not sure to understand.\nyou mean an horizontal div like this : http://jsbin.com/zosoh/5/ ?\n. I guess you can create a second carousel with a different template that display items 3 by 3 ?\nCould be a could addition to our examples too.\n. it works thanks\n. thanks\n. yes the last release has many breaking changes, sorry for this.\nusing $.css() has a negative perf impact. i think we should find a lighter approach.\nwhat about wrapping the content in in inner div ?\n. just published a release that sets style.cssText instead of style and this should preserve existing styles\n. awesome thanks\n. sorry for this.\nwill try to get relative position working for li's.\n. i don't really get the problem, could be cool to have a sample plunker\n. thanks :heart: \n. yes this has been fixed in a PR 10 minutes ago, thanks for reporting\n. Ho so this was a mistake\n. Hi,\nwhich version do you use ?\n. ok. i pushed a new version a few days ago, it should have better perfo\n. for your index problem, when you say \"sometimes not\" you mean sometimes it stays on the first slide instead of moving to another one ?\nabout the variable height, cant this be done in CSS ? \n. thanks; have you noticed the \"edit\" button on the top-right of any file on github ?\nIt lets you live-edit a file and submit a pull request immediately, which is greatly appreciated :)\n. awesome portfolio you have by the way\n. Here's the process to do the PR :\n- click on README.md\n- click on edit on top right\n- make the changes then save\n- on your own angular-carousel repo, click \u201cpull request\" and submit it\nplease use a conventional name for your commit title, like 'docs(readme): rename slideAndFade to fadeAndSlide\"\nThanks :)\n. nevermind, i fixed it\n. how did you fix it please ?\nim not a requirejs user so any help appreciated\n. didnt saw the PR, thank you\n. @nuong : which carousel version do you use please ?\nthis drives me mad. @jakeauyeung : Tweenable team issued a new version recently so i replaced it... can you please issue a new PR ? thanks\n. thanks a lot\n. Thanks for the detailed report. Will look this after ngEurope :)\n. fixed in 0578ae4c2e4484a81043f3cb64917176fa9f3bd3\n. awesome, thank you\n. have you tried this : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/blob/master/index.html#L53 ?\n. the starts are just an example of a custom indicator.it's quite easy to create your own\n. thanks for the great feature.\nAbout the implementation, what do you think about simply swapping the collection when the index change and let angular update the view ?\nBuffering is based on this principle;\n. Hi, there's no legimate reason to not merge this except i can't maintain this repo anymore.\nIs there anyone willing to become collaborator here, rebase this feature and test that it doesnt break anything?\nThanks\n. Ok this is quite simple; The bare minimum is to merge the most important pull requests, after have checked that it doesnt make any breaking changes. (ex: from the demo page)\nDepending on your time, you can also triage the issues/PR\nOnce merged, you should publish a new version by respecting semantic versionning.\nI'll then publish to bower and npm.\nAvailable for any questions !\n. can you please rebase your code on the last master branch ?\n. example rebase from your fork folder :\nsh\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel.git\ngit fetch\ngit rebase upstream/master\n. Hey Julien, can you contact me on julien@revolunet.com so we can have a real frenchy chat ? thanks\n. Hi, i've remerged all the work done in this fork : https://github.com/dcjohnston/angular-carousel\nIts currently in this branch : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/commits/merge-loop\nWould be great if some of you could test before any release\nthanks to @dcjohnston and @jup31and so sorry for the long delay on this PR but i dont use this project anymore so if some of you want to maintain the project, you're very welcome.\n. Is it possible for you te create a plunker that reproduces the problem ?\n. do you use a dotted name for your model ? eg : ng-model=\"carousel.index\" ?\nthis is mandatory as the ng-repeat creates new scopes and thus store index locally.\ncf http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17606936/angularjs-dot-in-ng-model\n. Strange, i don't have this case in the demo page : http://blog.revolunet.com/angular-carousel/\n. can you provide a sample plunker demonstrating the issue please ?\n. I'm not sure about clientWidth compatibility, look like its not in any W3C specs.\n. did you use rn-carousel-index=\"dot.model\" with the \"dot\" syntax ?\n. You're welcome for reporting issues :)\nI guess we should restore the position to 0 when the collection changes\n. Hi man,\nThe css slightly changed in carousel 0.3+ (much lighter)\ndid you get the last css from the repo ? \nhttps://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/blob/master/dist/angular-carousel.css\n. any plunker around ?\n. yep you need to set your ul height in css \n. looks like its due to the position:relative on the ul. i'll try to find a solution but if you have some time, PR appreciated :)\n. nope we need to find a proper solution\n. having multiple items on a single is really easy, its just a matter of template. group your images in pages :\nsomething like\nhtml\n<ul rn-carousel>\n  <li ng-repeat=\"page in pages\">\n     <img ng-repeat=\"image in page.images\" ng-src=\"image.url\"/>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n. i think i misunderstood sorry.\nsomeone has to implement a new transitionType for this\nthis is done in the computeCarouselSlideStyle function\n. thanks a lot man !\n. yes at the moment this is a static attribute but you could make a PR that uses $observe\n. looks like you're using an old version of the carousel.\nthe new release has it builtin (but there are breaking changes)\n. which carousel version du you use please ?  theres been a recent change on this\n. thanks for a good bug report. will fix\n. not implemented sorry.\nif you want issue a PR :\nwe could add rn-carousel-disable-touch attribute that bypass this line : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/blob/master/src/directives/rn-carousel.js#L226\n. You should filter the data before using it in the carousel, it will make it simpler and more performant\n. Thanks!\n. Sorry, tried without luck !\nTried to run event.stopPropagation() but maybe ngTouch + carousel + jquery draggable doesnt play well together.\nThis may not fix it but maybe try somehting lighter : https://github.com/fatlinesofcode/ngDraggable\n. mmm works well in the demo page : http://blog.revolunet.com/angular-carousel/ . do you have any example ?\n. did you try ? it should work :)\n. yep you need to share an index with the indicators :\nadd this to rn-carousel-indicators\nslides=\"slides\" rn-carousel-index=\"carouselIndex\"\nslides can be [0, 0, 0] i guess (just an array to know how many slides you have)\n. also add rn-carousel-index=\"carouselIndex\" to the carousel and expose that index in the scope\n. maybe its not implemented, not sure. will try to add a demo.\n. Thanks. for some reason i missed that cool PR.\nLooks there's a debugger statement left. can you please remove it and rebase on master ?\nThanks\n. duplicate of #254 would love a PR on this, i'm not a requirejs user\n. great, thanks\n. thanks\n. thanks\nnever tried this yet. what happens if we use bindonce at the moment ?\n. good catch thanks !\nmaybe we can find a way to keep it in the ngRepeat expression and not use it for the array.\n. thanks !\n. Really cool Thank you\n. did you try to use the \"dot notation\" for your model, eg data.carouselndex.\nthis is considered best practice when using angular.\nwhy ? because of this : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17606936/angularjs-dot-in-ng-model\n. hey, very cool addition, thank you !\nis it possible to keep the current demo style ? there is now a white background and some indicators are white too (so invisible) this is a bit confusing\nthanks !\n. Hey,\nI think #257 is not a good way to do, he should prepare the data before and not use ng-if inside the carousel itself\nThe most annoying bug is the shifty requirejs integration : #270 #265 #254 #218\n. Thanks for the report;\nCan you please issue a pull request ?\n. the tests have been disabled in the last rewrite :/\n. i dont have much time to add the tests but PR are very welcome :)\n. merged manually, thank you\n. Will do\n. ready : https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-carousel\ntell me if it fits your needs\n. done, thanks\n. Hi\nDid you try with including the rn-carousel.css ?\nhttps://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/blob/master/dist/angular-carousel.css\n. the basic positionning/layout is defined in this css and should be namespaced and overridable\n. yeah ! thanks a lot !\n. hi, does the demo page works on your chrome ? http://blog.revolunet.com/angular-carousel/\n. Hey, nice addition thanks, but looks like you didnt work on the last master version ?\ncan you rebase please ?\n. looks like some code is missing. \nfrom your branch you should :\nsh\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel.git\ngit fetch upstream\ngit rebase upstream/master\ngit push\n. looks like there is additional code, apart from the templateCache stuff ?\n. As stated on the readme, this repo is not maintained anymore, sorry. Feel free to fork !. thx\n. thanks man !\n. Hi, sorry this only works with strings at the moment... do you really need this to be dynamic ?\n. @EAndreyF : did you try this PR ?\n. sorry all for the delay. btw, this project is looking for maintainers if you're interested, just ping me\n. sorry just repushed 0.3.12 with the fix\n. Thanks.\nCant you use scope[iAttributes.rnCarouselOnInfiniteScrollRight]() instead of eval(\"scope.\" + iAttributes.rnCarouselOnInfiniteScrollRight) ?\nOr even better, use $parse(iAttributes.rnCarouselOnInfiniteScrollRight)(scope) ?\n. also please remove the console.log\n. thanks and sorry for the delay\n. i won't be able to work on this but i hope some contributors will :)\n. and yes, slick is awesome\n. sorry, done, thanks\n. well this is just a matter of template. if you organize your data it should be easy.\nhere's a non-working exampe but gives you the idea : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/blob/master/demo/flickr-full/index.html#L85-L95\n. :+1: thanks\n. thanks Scott, can you please also add the information in the README ?\n. agree\n. merged, thank you\n. +1\n. thanks but not needed at the moment\n. nice except there's a little flickering due to the watch i guess\n. thanks !\n. done\n. nice, thanks, can you please add to the info to the README too ?\n. Ok. i'll do the README update.\nI think the naming \"can loop\" is confusing because it applies only to the prev/next controls, not the swipe itself.\nCould you please rename to \"rnCarouselControlsAllowLoop\" ?\n. looks good to me thanks :)\nthe final step would be to rebase your 5 commits in a single one\n-  make a backup : git branch backup\n-  git rebase HEAD~6 \"fixup\" the commits until the first one\n-  write the single commit message\n  if all is ok then you can push --force\nthanks !\n. that's great, thanks man !\n. still using bower on this projet. not sure if its a good idea to duplicate dependencies to package.json ?\n. i don't, its just historical :) you're welcome to submit a PR to remove it if you will\nThanks\n. Hey. No much time to work on this currently, sorry about that :/\nMy first guess is to check when happens here : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/blob/master/src/directives/rn-carousel.js#L161-L167\nis the ng-repeat expression correctly parsed and valid ?\nPR much appreciated (this repo is looking for contributors :))\n. I'm just a developer too :)\nWhat are the step to reproduce ? simply bower update?\n. Thanks @cedricblondeau \n. mmm i dont see any reference to carousel here.\nBTW this error may come from the shifty.js require.js integration\n. what happened ?\n. if you arrange your images by \"page\" you can do it. in this example i was displaying multiples items at once : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/blob/master/demo/flickr-full/index.html#L85-L95\n. did you add angular-touch.js as mentioned in the README ?\n. ok, please provide a plunker with reproduction possible\n. thank you\n. Hi, there is a tentative here : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/pull/237\ni recently merged that work into the \"merge-loop\" branch i'd appreciate if some of you could test that branch and give feedback, thanks\n. oops, sorry and thanks for reporting... just fixed it :)\n. Nice addition thank you :) can you please also add the doc to the README ?\n. Cool move thank you\n. i think the repeatCollection should be the final, filtered expression souldn't it ? so you get the order you asked in the carousel\ncan you please test with this change ? https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/commit/0f2b303b37b631461881cab3ddfab1a7dc46a356\n. Thanks. i dont really have time to maintain this project anymore so if you want to become contributor you're welcome :)\n. well if you wanna improve the project i think there's a few issues and PR that need review/comments :)\n. thank you, appreciated\n. Good news !\nAbout the current loop implementation proposed here : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/pull/237/files\nI'm not a big fan of it; i think we can have a simpler approach by slicing directly the input ngRepeat, what do you think ?\n. Thank you, a small but important fix\n. works here, which npm version/os do you have ?\n```\n$ npm install angular-carousel\ncarousel@1.0.0 /Users/juju/Desktop/tmp/carousel\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 angular-carousel@1.0.1  extraneous\nnpm WARN EPACKAGEJSON carousel@1.0.0 No description\nnpm WARN EPACKAGEJSON carousel@1.0.0 No repository field.\n```\n. all good :+1: \n. Thanks for your suggestion and feedback :) If you have an example code to share, this may be helpful to others... thanks :)\n. Thanks for sharing the workaround\nIn the current code : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/blob/master/src/directives/rn-carousel.js#L389 the rn-carousel-auto-slide attribute expects an integer value at initialisation and cannot be changed later because it use an infinite interval function. Making it tweakable at each interval implies to change that $interval to a recurring $timeout that could evaluate the rn-carousel-auto-slide attribute at each timeout using the $parse function (to be able to read the attribute value in the current scope).\n. Hey, thanks for the contribution !\nIsn't wrap the same as allow-loop ?\n. hey guys, yes, unless someone with good expertise can take the relay, because i'm not much into angular anymore, and lack time for maintenance... good luck\n. thanks\n. Well i dont have time to maintain this project anymore but if you find a way to pass that duration as an extra attribute, this can be merged\n. Hi ! Thanks for reporting !\nsorry i can't maintain this lib anymore but if someone is motivated, i can give contributors access after a first PR :)\n. Thank you!\nCan you please confirm all the demo examples are still working ?\n. Thanks\n. I'd be happy to review and merge this improvement ;)\n. not builtin sorry but you could have something like carouselIndex=images.length initialy ?\n. transitions are defined by JS, a few examples here : https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/blob/master/src/directives/rn-carousel.js#L75\n. nice thanks !. \ud83d\udc4d . il me semble que cela peut aussi s'\u00e9crire comme ceci : \niElement[0].childNodes.filter(function(x) { return x.tagName === \"LI\"  }). argh ok bien vu :). pour info, il faut \u00e9diter dans le dossier \"src\", le dossier \"dist\" est un fichier \"compil\u00e9\"\n. nb: je cherche des mainteneurs sur ce projet, il y a pas mal de PRs en attente de review et je ne peux pas m'en occuper... . looks good !. Hi, sorry i cannot maintain the projet anymore :/ 800+ items means thousands of watchers which is not very angular-friendly\ndo you use the \"buffered\" option ?. ",

    "univie": "I made a plunkr, but the issue does not occur in Chrome for android. Css transitions don't look as smooth as in Phonegap, but the carousel is much more stable overall. You can still check out the plunkr if you want at http://plnkr.co/p2q6fBdunlJIhE28AGva. I will keep you posted on further tests.\n. I only included fastclick to see if it was the one causing the issue (I use it in other places in the app). \nDataset is loaded only once in its entirety at startup, so it can be considered static (no fancy buffering going on from firebase). \nI guess the dataset is just too heavy (1000+ items) to associate it directly with the carousel. The deep $watch on collection content (in your code) also causes perf. issues on my galaxy tab 2. Do you notice any lag during transitions on your mobile device?\n. Good to know, thanks. Btw if you open the plunkr on 2 devices and swipe the carousel on one device, it will swipe in the other  - thanks to the magic of firebase ))\n. This is a human translation, so there's no reliable way of syncing the two (punctuation doesn't always match; order of phrases is changed sometimes). I do have a script that remembers the order in which you siwped, so they will be synced on second reading (this is a language learning app :)\n. I have sent you a link to an apk of an app with the latest version of carousel.

Returning items directly (no deferred) doesn't seem to work quite right. The slide is appended, but it makes an extra transition - perhaps a skipAnimation issue?\n. I made a plunkr, but the issue does not occur in Chrome for android. Css transitions don't look as smooth as in Phonegap, but the carousel is much more stable overall. You can still check out the plunkr if you want at http://plnkr.co/p2q6fBdunlJIhE28AGva. I will keep you posted on further tests.\n. I only included fastclick to see if it was the one causing the issue (I use it in other places in the app). \nDataset is loaded only once in its entirety at startup, so it can be considered static (no fancy buffering going on from firebase). \nI guess the dataset is just too heavy (1000+ items) to associate it directly with the carousel. The deep $watch on collection content (in your code) also causes perf. issues on my galaxy tab 2. Do you notice any lag during transitions on your mobile device?\n. Good to know, thanks. Btw if you open the plunkr on 2 devices and swipe the carousel on one device, it will swipe in the other  - thanks to the magic of firebase ))\n. This is a human translation, so there's no reliable way of syncing the two (punctuation doesn't always match; order of phrases is changed sometimes). I do have a script that remembers the order in which you siwped, so they will be synced on second reading (this is a language learning app :)\n.

Note:  I implemented an image scaling directive in Angular, but I'm having some problems.

HMTL markup that I'm using:\nul rn-carousel rn-carousel-buffered rn-carousel-index=\"currentSlide\" class=\"my-slider ng-cloak\">\n    li ng-repeat=\"selectedPhoto in selectedPhotos track by $index\">\n        div on-hold=\"openPhotoModal($index)\" >\n            img ng-src=\"{{selectedPhoto.path}}\" image-resize image-percent=\"10\" />\n        /div>\n    /li>\n/ul>\n.

Either way, none of the above helped.  Not sure I got fully\noutside the Ionic context, as it is still within the app but not within\nion-content tags.  Anyway... Still pretty unmanageable performance.\nOn Tue, Jun 24, 2014 at 6:05 PM, Julien Bouquillon <notifications@github.com\n\nwrote:\nYep carousel works with any kind of content but i dont get why canvas perf\ncould be better; Its already GPU accelerated with the CSS3d transformations.\nNot using \"cover\" should help increase perfo.\nMaybe try in a empty page outside of the ionic context too\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/issues/175#issuecomment-47049699\n.\n\n\nMarc Syp, Application Engineer\nSan Francisco, CA\nWARNING: The information contained in this message is legally\nprivileged and proprietary information intended only for the use of\nthe individual or entity named above.

I will try to create an isolated example for these purposes when I have a\nchance.  In the meantime, the idea behind using html canvas was that\nperformance is supposedly better than div background rendering, and also I\nwas thinking I could use canvas to resize with JS:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/18922880/html5-canvas-resize-downscale-image-high-quality\nHowever, I'm not sure whether the scaling would result in any performance\nincrease, or how to integrate these techniques with the angular-carousel so\nthat only the relevant images get scaled as part of the lazy loading\nprocess.  I was thinking that I could use a $scope.watch() to get the\ncurrent index and trigger scaling of the current set of slides iteratively.\n Seems like a big commitment for an amateur such as myself to take on just\non a hunch, which is why I brought the question to this forum.  Either way,\nI'm kind of blocked on my app development until I can resolve this issue...\nAnother note re: html canvas.  Due to the Galaxy S5's lack of rotation of\nthe actual file, there is a good chance that I will have to rotate images\nbased on EXIF data, and my first thought was to use canvas to do this...\nOn Wed, Jun 25, 2014 at 12:25 AM, Julien Bouquillon \nnotifications@github.com wrote:\n\ncould be interesting to have an isolated example with these giant images\nto benchmark/analyse\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/issues/175#issuecomment-47068407\n.\n\n\nMarc Syp, Application Engineer\nSan Francisco, CA\nWARNING: The information contained in this message is legally\nprivileged and proprietary information intended only for the use of\nthe individual or entity named above.

Note:  I implemented an image scaling directive in Angular, but I'm having some problems.  Here is the directive:\napp.directive(\"imageResize\", [\n  \"$parse\", function($parse) {\n    return {\n      link: function(scope, elm, attrs) {\n        var imagePercent;\n        imagePercent = $parse(attrs.imagePercent)(scope);\n        elm.bind(\"load\", function(e) {\n          elm.unbind(\"load\"); //Hack to ensure load is called only once\n          var canvas, ctx, neededHeight, neededWidth;\n          neededHeight = elm[0].naturalHeight * imagePercent / 100;\n          neededWidth = elm[0].naturalWidth * imagePercent / 100;\n          canvas = document.createElement(\"canvas\");\n          canvas.width = neededWidth;\n          canvas.height = neededHeight;\n          ctx = canvas.getContext(\"2d\");\n          ctx.drawImage(elm[0], 0, 0, neededWidth, neededHeight);\n          elm.attr('src', canvas.toDataURL(\"image/jpeg\"));\n        });\n      }\n    };\n  }\n]); \nThe directive works on the first set of slides in the carousel, but as soon as the first swipe is performed, the images revert to their full, non-scaled versions.  \nAlso, the performance gain for the swiping carousel is good but load time is not any better, in fact it's probably a bit worse.\nAny thoughts?\n. HMTL markup that I'm using:\nul rn-carousel rn-carousel-buffered rn-carousel-index=\"currentSlide\" class=\"my-slider ng-cloak\">\n    li ng-repeat=\"selectedPhoto in selectedPhotos track by $index\">\n        div on-hold=\"openPhotoModal($index)\" >\n            img ng-src=\"{{selectedPhoto.path}}\" image-resize image-percent=\"10\" />\n        /div>\n    /li>\n/ul>\n. Can someone post the specific code fix required here?  I am using Ionic Framework (which uses a custom gesture library built on Hammer) but I'm not sure where to start.\nThanks.\n. ",

However this approach resulted in slides being overlapped, so maybe there is some css style in angular-carousel that is conflicting with the desired display mode. \nIf I could get this working, then we should have everything required to style the slides so they fill the view appropriately with either \n.slide:{  width:100% }  or .slide:{ height:100% }  to achieve the required fill mode.\nI would have had a play with the source to try (1)  as it looks like a simple change, but the tests are commented out and as I don't yet have a great deal of test experience with angular it made me a little uneasy.\nI am currently using a jQuery slideshow, but would like an all Angular solution. \n.

I cannot scroll down using touch or mouse.\nI'm using this version of angular-carousel and angular-touch:\nhttps://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/angular-carousel/0.3.9/angular-carousel.min.js\nhttps://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/angular.js/1.3.11/angular-touch.min.js\nIs this the correct version that contains the builtin fix?\nPS - I have tried adding the suggested class override in my local CSS file and still not working:\n.rn-carousel-container {\n    -ms-touch-action: pan-y;\n    touch-action: pan-y; \n}\nPlease help. Thank you!\nI'm using Chrome Version 40.0.2214.93 in a touch screen laptop.\n. ",

    "ragamufin": "I had the same problem and @prinz-z 's solution did not work for me. I got it working by reading the code and then working around it. Until this is fixed here's what you can do:\n1. Set rn-carousel-index to your model's position. Make sure you use dot notation and no curly brackets, for e.g. \njavascript\nrn-carousel-index=\"data.position\"\n1. Before your view loads with the carousel, keep track of your desired starting position but set the model position to null. This will cause the carousel to change it to 0. \n2. Set a watch on the position changing so that when it changes from null to 0 you can set it to your original intended starting position and then remove the watch. e.g.\n``` javascript\n// only need to run this if we have an initial position other than 0\nif($scope.model.position){\n    var pos_initial = $scope.model.position;\n    // console.info('Initial position:', pos_initial);\n    $scope.model.position = null;\n    // if position is set then jump to that position as soon as the carousel loads\n    var promise_watch = $scope.$watch('model.position', function(pos){\n        if(pos !== 0) return; // will be fired for null value which we don't care about\n    console.info('Setting initial position:', pos_initial);\n    $scope.model.position = pos_initial;\n    promise_watch(); // remove watch after setting the position\n});\n\n}\n```\nSo basically I'm suggesting waiting until the carousel runs its initial logic and the binding to your index is complete then set it to your desired position. So far for me this happens fast enough that it's as if the position was set to begin with and there is no flicker or anything of the sort.\n. Actually I think the problem rather is here. If we pass in rnCarouselIndex then it creates the indexModel which it will use in order to assign the position of the carousel whenever it changes. However at startup, line 361 set the position to 0 therefore this watch will overwrite whatever model we pass in as our starting position.\n.

The other note is that the '.full-details-container' div is offscreen below the viewport and slides up when the user clicks anywhere on the comment or score.\nWould appreciate any thoughts why the comment text and score are flickering as they user swipes.\nI noticed that it doesn't do any flickering until the carousel slides are dynamically re-writing (after it gets to  carouselindex of greater than 2).\n. I'm using this version of angular:\n* @license AngularJS v1.2.28\nThe blinking of the comments text was happening before I introduced the $watch() function. It looks like it might be calling some sort of 'render' function twice on the set of 5 slides that are being buffered.\nAny ideas as to what I might explore?\n. Hi @Lemolas, can you supply a code sample of the $scope.$watch function for the rn-carousel-index?\nBest regards,\nTony\n. That's fantastic! I implemented it for my wine site here: http://app.winetracker.co/#!/wines/all/gallery\nI am now able to run the formatting functions on the child elements (eg truncate text to make it fit on each individual carousel slide.\u00a0\nThanks for the code sample. Totally cleared it up for me!\u00a0\nSincerely,\nTony\n\u2014\nSent from Mailbox\nOn Mon, Jun 29, 2015 at 3:52 AM, Lemolas notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHi @tonejac, this is what i did\nhtml: \n\njs:\n$scope.$watch('carouselIndex', function(newValue) {\n    console.log(jQuery('#home_featured_slider ul > li:nth-child(' + (+newValue + 1) + ')').html());\n});\nLittle explanation:\ni'm assuming that 'carouselIndex' is the index list of my object/array. So i built an object with n elements and the 'carouselIndex' variable contains the actual element active. Assuming that the number of element inside the ng-repeat is the same of the index count, i'm able to take the current carousel position. Doing this, you can even access directly to the object to take other information. \n$scope.featuredSliderActual = []; //  this will contain the ACTIVE carousel item\n $scope.$watch('carouselIndex', function(newValue) {\n    $scope.featuredSliderActual = $scope.data[newValue]; // data is my complete object\n    console.log(jQuery('#home_featured_slider ul > li:nth-child(' + (+newValue + 1) + ')').html());\n});\nso you can manipulate all the element inside (in my case, i'm able to take the right price and calculate the currencies)\n$scope.featuredSliderActual = []; //  this will contain the ACTIVE carousel item\n $scope.$watch('carouselIndex', function(newValue) {\n    $scope.featuredSliderActual = $scope.data[newValue]; // data is my complete object\n    console.log(jQuery('#home_featured_slider ul > li:nth-child(' + (+newValue + 1) + ')').html());\n    $scope.priceList = {\n                price_aud : $scope.featuredSliderActual.price_aud,\n                price_eur : $scope.featuredSliderActual.price_eur,\n                price_gbp : $scope.featuredSliderActual.price_gbp,\n                price_usd : $scope.featuredSliderActual.price_usd\n            };\n});\nso the $scope variable 'priceList' will contain always the right price to show.\nlet me know if you need something more.\nBest regards,\nGuglielmo\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/issues/331#issuecomment-116604502\n. Yes you're right the text trembling was happening before. I'm not sure why the carousel does that.

Hi @revolunet - my code changes are so horrid you'd probably get shocked looking at it :-)\nI added this factory to angular-carousel.js\n```\n.factory ('carouselControl', function() {\n        var stoporplay = false;\n        var duration = 0;\n        return {\n            setDuration: function (val)\n            {\n                    duration = val;\n            },\n\n            getDuration: function ()\n            {\n                    return duration;\n            },\n\n            setStopOrPlay: function(val)\n            {\n                    stoporplay = val;\n            },\n            getStopOrPlay: function()\n            {\n                    return stoporplay;\n            },\n            isStopped: function()\n            {\n                    return stoporplay;\n            },\n\n    }\n})\n\n```\nAnd then  every time you move to the next slide, you use the duration value from the template. Instead, I changed it to \nscope.autoSlider = $interval(function() {\n       if (!locked && !pressed ) {\n                       scope.nextSlide();\n        }\n    }, carouselControl.getDuration());\nAnd I've added other functions to this factory - which I call from my app to control whatever I need.\nI guess there are better ways like 2 way binding etc - I don't know much of angular to achieve that\n. It seems changing parseInt to parseFloat here does the trick\nhttps://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel/blob/d643bb3201cf3cf736d400a76ad41595cfa4b3a8/dist/angular-carousel.js#L466\n. sorry, the problem is fixed - I did not need to stop auto-slide.
