    "M66B": "Thank you very much for this contribution!\nMerge manually, because the commit didn't fit anymore.\n. This exception is catched and logged in XPrivacy, so it is not really a problem. I have already a solution for it, which will be included in the next version. Nevertheless thanks for reporting.\n. Fixed in version 0.8\n. Fixed by making the app icon clickable\n. The next version will be able to restrict access to the media storage.\nIt is too complicated to realize complete isolation.\n. Maybe it can be implemented after all using the IoBridge hook.\n. I have tried several approaches to implement this, but there seems not to be a fail safe way to do so.\n. https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/commit/caecee876f33ab817b78bf8a7949e20cbb47c05b\n. This maybe eventually an option, but a complication is that not all information access requires permissions.\n. If I look at myself, I look for information types that have been actually used (bold/italic and yellow icon).\nThe problem with looking from that perspective is that information may not be used yet.\n. Yes, when an application actually (tries) to use information it will be marked.\nI have added a help icon and pressing it pops up a little help dialog.\nPlease let me know if anything should be added to the dialog.\n. Solve by better icons, icon placement and help\n. https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/commit/a0cf8b40d452c7224ac2f18c0e754b46a1f4917d\n. Will be in version 0.20\n. IMHO alphabetic sorting is the most useful.\nSystem apps can be enabled in expert mode.\n. What do you suggest to put into the options menu?\n. Both views will have options menu's from version 0.27.\n. Action bar up will be in version 0.27\n. Will be realized in version 0.27\n. I am unsure which properties to restrict, since these vary a lot.\n. ro.serialno\n. Realized in version 0.24.\n. Version 0.17\n. SMS/MMS/calling: realized: to be tested\n. Default settings are only meaning full per application.\nBatch settings restriction can easily lead to mistakes.\n. The next release will have a menu to set a template for new applications and the all menu.\n. This feature will be in the pro version\n. @famewolf: send me a PM and I will give you the Pro version\n. Fetching the permissions is slow, that is why the permissions aren't shown in the app lists.\n. See also http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=42569597&postcount=63\n. Since popups will not be possible in all situations, resulting in confusing, I set this issue to wont fix.\nXPrivacy acts on a too deep level to realize this.\n. Before I am going to look into it: XPrivacy doesn't block GPS locations, but replaces them by random locations.\nSo for the Facebook app the GPS should appear to work, only where you are might vary.\nPlease let me know if Facebook 'sees' your actual location or not.\n. I have just tried restricting the location for Facebook and I was nearby Easter Island ;-)\n. Please send me a logcat starting from your device startup until starting Facebook and I will check if it is working for your ROM.\n. Everything should seem normal, so the notifications bar will say location set by GPS.\nOnly the Facebook app will be fed with random locations instead of real locations\nRestrict the location for the Facebook application and try to check in and see where Facebook thinks where you are.\n. Version 0.21 allows to set a location\n. Duplicate of:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/issues/21\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/issues/27\n. Blocking opening links have been moved to the category 'Actions' (category is renamed from 'Calling')\n. The framework for XPrivacy is prepared to realize this, so eventually this will be made possible.\n. I am hesitating to realize this feature, since it would add complexity to XPrivacy and thus could cause potential bug.\nAlso checking sub-categories would be a sacrifice concerning speed.\nMy preference would be to split up the existing main categories where needed.\nIn version 0.22 I added the category 'View' and moved restricting opening browser links into it.\nIs there any other category that should be split?\n. More granular checking of restrictions will have an effect on speed and memory usage (because of caching).\nThe speed of the user interface is not the issue.\nMedia means: recording audio, taking photos, recording video, not accessing media files. For that you can restrict access to the external storage.\nSystem is just installed apps for now, maybe things like logging will be added later.\nI will add a description of the categories to the documentation.\n. Realized in version 0.24.\n. Android does not have a file chooser dialog.\nPutting the license file into the root folder is the most user friendly solution.\n. I have seen these all, but I don't want a custom file chooser.\n. I will check for the license file in both the root folder and the .xprivacy folder.\nExport/import file also go to / come from the .xprivacy folder.\n. A hidden folder seems a good solution in this case to me.\n. Will be fixed in the next release.\n. But does each and every device have a file manager?\n. Realized in version 0.21\n. Will be fixed in 0.20, available in about an hour.\nThanks for reporting\n. Strange, since this works for me.\nCould you please post a screenshot?\n. This seems like a bug in SwiftKey.\nWhat happens if you press '123 Sym' or the tools icon?\nCan you switch to another keyboard type using the Android settings?\nXPrivacy specifies the correct characters:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/res/layout/xsettings.xml#L36\n. Does the minus sign appear on any of the other keyboards?\n. This will be in the next version, hopefully it will solve this problem.\n. Thanks for reporting back!\n. The granular restriction management displays which functions, actions and values were used or were tried to be used. Is that sufficient?\n. Would it be sufficient to display the last usage time in the functions editor? Individual functions are already shown bold when used.\n. Version 0.27 will display the day and time of last usage.\n. This will be in the next release\n. The version number, package name and uid  are visible in the app details of version 0.24.\n(tap the app icon in the restrictions browser)\n. Should be fixed in version 0.24.\nThanks for reporting!\n. Seems no be fixed yet\n. Seems to be an app problem.\n. Mac address can be configured in version 0.30\n. Next versions will have settings for various things, but there will be no randomization for now.\n. Yes, have patience.\n. The next release will have settings for IMEI and phone number.\n. What do you mean by device ID?\n(serial number, build ID, phone ID, IMEI, etc)\n. What you mean is ANDROID_ID, I will add a setting for that too.\n. For now I will close this issue, if something else needs to be set, please open the issue again.\n. 1 it is indeed an advanced feature, maybe I will make it only available in expert mode.\n2 and 3: the child check boxes are exceptions to the main check box.\nThe initial is that all child check boxes are check when you first check the main check box.\nSo only if you have checked the main check box the child check boxes are functional.\n. Batch setting seems not reasonable for individual functions. IMHO this is always app finetuning.\n. It is intended to work like this.\nThe child boxes are exceptions to the main check box, except when the main check box is not checked.\nI see no other way to realize this.\nShaded check boxes don't exist in Android as far as I know.\nPlease let me know if you have a better solution.\n. It is too complicated to realize this.\nIt would mean per app settings and runtime evaluation of contacts.\nAlmost everything is possible, but this will impact performance and possibly stability.\n. There is no easy way to link account (types) and/or contact to applications. It would require additional Android permissions for XPrivacy to select account/contacts, which I think would be unacceptable to a lot of users.\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/accounts/AccountManager.html\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/ContactsContract.html\n. Will be part of the next release.\n. Will be fixed in version 0.25.\n. http://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/LocationManager.html\nIt may be possible to fake if the GPS provider is disabled by returning false for isProviderEnabled, but that won't prevent _requestLocationUpdate_s from working. The location manager reports the best location it has. Theoretically it would be possible to hook private functions within LocationManager and associated servies, but that would be at the price of compatibility with different ROM versions/flavors.\n. Realized in version 0.26.\n. XPrivacy is not meant as firewall app and moreover this cannot be realized used XPrivacy, since this can only be done at Linux level and XPrivacy operates at Android level.\n. Not possible: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=42773652&postcount=220\n. Would splitting up 'Media' into 'Audio' and 'Camera' (for picture and video) be okay?\n. I tried to realize this, but unfortunately it is not possible to distinguish audio and video when the MediaRecorder class is used (this is do to the fact that the methods setAudio/VideoSource are native methods (not Java).\n. Already tried, that doesn't work :-(\n. Maybe we can fix this after all :-)\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=42828957&postcount=1821\n. I have tried another time, but it seems not to be possible to hook the native functions in MediaRecorder (setAudioSource/setVideoSource). Hooking succeeds, but the functions are never called. This means there is no reliable way to distinguish between audio and video.\n. Duplicate: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/issues/21\n. This is too much work, for little gain.\nMoreover this won't fit on small screens.\n(I know I have one)\n. I cannot reproduce this problem, so please provide a logcat.\nWhich ROM/device are you using?\n. Long logcat's are normal.\nXPrivacy adds logging too and it will not slow down your device.\nThis may be caused by a bug in Xposed.\nCould you please try this test version of XPrivacy and let me know if the problem still occurs?\nhttp://www.faircode.eu/xprivacy/XPrivacy_0.29.1.apk\n. Thanks, vipere.\nIf you like to chat, please send me a PM.\nIn any case we now know the cause.\nI will look into this tomorrow further.\nMy best guess is that something that is done here causes this, although I have no idea yet what and why:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XRestriction.java#L302\n. @Tassos-i could your please try this test version:\nhttp://www.faircode.eu/xprivacy/XPrivacy_0.29.2.apk\nYou can keep the test versions and upgrade later to 0.30+\n. See the latest commit a little bit up.\n(second \"Attempt to fix 50\")\n. @rovo89 could you please take a look at this.\nSimply hooking Runtime.load or Runtime.loadLibrary leads to this problem.\n(even without any code in the hook itself)\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/Runtime.html\n. Solved by hooking the private methods and skipping checks when uid=0.\n. Thanks for reporting, this will be fixed in the next release.\n. See the FAQ, question 19 for why this is not possible.\n. The filter gets the focus, so you can start typing to filter applications and normally the keyboard should popup when you tap the input field. It is not possible to change this behavior from an application, so this is caused by either a setting or a bug in your ROM. Which ROM/device are you using?\n. See the FAQ for how to clear all settings.\n. Check/uncheck all (issue #67) and default restrictions (issue #17) should cover this.\nEnhance one of these issue, when needed.\n. Thanks for the suggestion, but sorry, I don't like whistles and bell.\n. Android doesn't allow this.\nMoreover this should not be changed, since it would be inconsistent with other parts of Android.\n. There is not enough room for this on devices with a small screen (I have one).\nMoreover I want to keep the user interface as clean as possible.\nFor most users this isn't relevant.\n. Could you let me know if version 0.30 fixes this problem?\nThis version will be released today (soon probably).\n. Could you please try if this version fixes the lag?\nhttp://www.faircode.eu/xprivacy/XPrivacy_0.30.1.apk\n. Can you please try this version too:\nhttp://www.faircode.eu/xprivacy/XPrivacy_0.30.2.apk\n(I am trying to pinpoint the problem)\n. Could you please capture a logcat from the moment you turn your device on?\nOn the command line, assuming adb (part of the Android SDK) is installed:\nadb logcat | grep XPrivacy\nPlease post it on pastebin or similar and link it from this issue.\n. Maybe a complete logcat is better.\n. http://forum.samdroid.net/f38/tutorial-how-get-logcat-example-check-battery-drain-2543/\nBut replace the command by\nadb logcat\nAnd enter that before you turn on your device\n. It would be a little stupid to say 'no' ;-)\nSend me a PM through GitHub or XDA and I will reply with my e-mail address.\n. Try this:\nadb logcat >path/to/some_file.txt\nYou want see output, it will go into the file\n. Yes, I will look into it, thanks.\n. I have been staring to the logcat for a while, but I see nothing strange related to XPrivacy.\nSuper user is repeatably denied, so maybe that is the cause.\nTo be sure, make a backup of XPrivacy (or export the settings if you can) and reset the settings of XPrivacy as described in the FAQ and reboot to see if this problem is still there. If you are concerned about your privacy, disable all networks before resetting the setting of XPrivacy. If the delay is still there, then disable XPrivacy using the Xposed installer and reboot again.\nI could be that some restriction is causing this.\n. Thanks for reporting back!\nI am glad this problem is solved.\n. I will make the text box smaller (100 dip instead of 150 dip).\nIs there anything that can be done to the translation?\n. I would like to keep as much as space available for the app list.\nCan you send me a PM, it may be easier if we discuss this using chat (I use GTalk).\n. That is not possible in a reliable way, since not all restrictions are covered by Android permissions.\nFor example access to the android ID doesn't require permissions.\n. Because LBE works only with permissions, which is a big disadvantage.\nMaybe read the usage instructions again, they were updated short ago.\n. Should be fixed in version 0.32\n. You can switch your system language temporarily to English in that case.\nI do that myself too.\n. For now I have added a link to the restriction documentation on GitHub from the help dialog.\nI will improve this later.\n. I am thinking of creating a public wiki, with ? buttons linking to entries in it.\n. Will be part of the next release.\nPreview: http://wiki.faircode.eu/index.php?title=XPrivacy\n. Please read the FAQ, question 20, it is not so simple as you think.\n. Did you read this: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#restrictions\n. @can0brains look into the menu in the app view: 'All' will do what you want\n. In the next release you can quickly go to the application settings using the menu in the application view.\nThere you can stop the application in the Android way. The menu will also have a new entry 'Launch' to start an application and alternatively you can start the application by tapping the application icon in the XPrivacy application view.\n. Don't worry, this is one of my high priority issues.\n. Will be fixed in version 0.35\n. The external IP cannot be blocked, since this address is outside of you device. It is assigned by your provider and always visible. It will be not visible by apps, but it will be visible to external servers (site).\n. Duplicate of #39\n. Since the internet permission is revoked, unexpected things can happen. See also the usage instructions.\n. You are right, it should be move to 'before'.\nThanks for your other pull request!\nI will look at it Thursday.\n. Will be fixed in version 0.35\n. Duplicate of #65\n. This is most probably caused by a corrupt download, so try to download again.\n. Will be added in the next release.\n. Ticking the check box filters app with the restriction set.\nThere will be no filter on permissions, see the FAQ, question 20 why.\nIMHO the text edit box is large enough, because entering a few characters is mostly enough to find the app you are searching for.\n. I will reopen the issue for the 'exclamation mark' filter.\n. Well be realized in version 0.41, send me a XDA PM if you want to test.\n. I agree with you and your remark is for me a reason to close this issue. The number of contributions to this project has been limited so far, so I don't see anybody soon write a complete new UI. Furthermore there are a few technical difficulties (security related) to solve to realize this and I have no idea yet how to do that.\n. Although I appreciate the suggestion, this wont happen, mainly because it is not open source and secondary because it is simply too much work to change the current stable solution to a new framework (any idea how much work XPrivacy was?)\n. Try to capture the message text somehow and paste it here, please.\nMaybe install some e-mail app and not configure it.\n. I like to look into this issue, but I didn't had a support e-mail yet, is that correct?\nIf you hesitate to send an e-mail, pasting the contents of the e-mail into this issue is even easier for me.\n. android.telephony.MultiSimTelephonyManager \npublic android.telephony.MultiSimTelephonyManager() \npublic android.telephony.MultiSimTelephonyManager(android.content.Context) \npublic android.telephony.MultiSimTelephonyManager(android.content.Context,int) \nprotected com.android.internal.telephony.ITelephony android.telephony.MultiSimTelephonyManager.getITelephony() \npublic java.lang.String android.telephony.MultiSimTelephonyManager.getNetworkCountryIso() \npublic java.lang.String android.telephony.MultiSimTelephonyManager.getNetworkOperator() \npublic java.lang.String android.telephony.MultiSimTelephonyManager.getNetworkOperatorName() \nprotected int android.telephony.MultiSimTelephonyManager.getPhoneTypeFromProperty() \npublic java.lang.String android.telephony.MultiSimTelephonyManager.getSimCountryIso() \npublic java.lang.String android.telephony.MultiSimTelephonyManager.getSimOperator() \npublic java.lang.String android.telephony.MultiSimTelephonyManager.getSimOperatorName() \npublic int android.telephony.MultiSimTelephonyManager.getSimState() \nprotected com.android.internal.telephony.IPhoneSubInfo android.telephony.MultiSimTelephonyManager.getSubscriberInfo() \npublic boolean android.telephony.MultiSimTelephonyManager.isNetworkRoaming() \npublic boolean android.telephony.MultiSimTelephonyManager.isSmsCapable() \npublic boolean android.telephony.MultiSimTelephonyManager.isVoiceCapable() \npublic void android.telephony.MultiSimTelephonyManager.listen(android.telephony.PhoneStateListener,int) \npublic static android.telephony.MultiSimTelephonyManager android.telephony.MultiSimTelephonyManager.getDefault() \npublic static android.telephony.MultiSimTelephonyManager android.telephony.MultiSimTelephonyManager.getDefault(int) \nprivate static final java.lang.String android.telephony.MultiSimTelephonyManager.TAG \nprivate static int android.telephony.MultiSimTelephonyManager.cnt \nprivate static android.telephony.MultiSimTelephonyManager[] android.telephony.MultiSimTelephonyManager.sInstance \nprivate android.content.Context android.telephony.MultiSimTelephonyManager.mContext \nprivate com.android.internal.telephony.ITelephonyRegistry android.telephony.MultiSimTelephonyManager.mRegistry \nprivate int android.telephony.MultiSimTelephonyManager.mSimSlot\n.

This will be fixed in the next release.\n. This is because XPrivacy doesn't restrict providers yet.\n. This will probably be fixed in the next release.\nIf not, please open the issue again and describe which steps to follow to reproduce.\n. I just saw that Google Now is started in another way (not during boot, but by another app).\nXPrivacy is not a startup manager, so I will not fix this.\n. Duplicate of #41\n. Hiding possible root access is not the goal of XPrivacy, which is about restricting access to privacy sensitive data.\n. Duplicate of #39\n. Nothing to do with privacy:\n- modify phone state\n- change network state\n- change wi-fi state\n- write user dictionary\n- read/write settings\n- write call log\n- write media storage\n- write APN settings\n- read privileged phone state\n- vibrate\n- write profile\nAlready realized:\n- read media storage\n- read secure settings (serial number)\n- get tasks\n- access all downloads (needs to be checked)\n- access location extra commands\n- read profile (contacts)\n- call privileged (calling)\n- read user dictionary\nWhy should be blocked:\n- send sticky broadcasts\nTo be realized:\n- sync\n- nfc\n. LocationManager.sendExtraCommand will be restricted in the next release\n. Can you give a link to the original texts?\n. XPrivacy is not about permissions, but about privacy.\nSee also the FAQ, question 20.\n. User dictionary can be restricted in the next release.\n. Media storage is protected by Linux file permissions. No application can see the data of another application.\nRead profile is restricted by the category contacts.\nCall privileged is restricted by the category phone.\nI don't see how the sync stats can be privacy sensitive.\nRead call log is restricted by the category phone.\n. Access to the media storage can be restricted in the next release.\n. http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/SyncStats.html\n. Sync of contacts can be restricted by restricting contacts, etc.\n. NFC can be restricted in version 0.40\n. Duplicate of #67\n. Network location should also be restricted, but rest assured, I will look into it.\n. This might be the leak: http://developer.android.com/training/location/retrieve-current.html\n. Google Maps appears to determine the location also by looking at the neighboring Wi-Fi access points.\nThis can be prevented by restricting network.\nThis should go into the help as described in issue #65.\n. http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=43074480&postcount=546\n. Same as this https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/issues/59#issuecomment-19858443 ?\n. Did you check super user?\n. Then please paste a link here to a captured logcat.\n. Please attach a link to a logcat to this issue.\n. @portamento there is a lot of text in the logcat and I don't see apparent problems, except maybe that your device seems to have limited memory available.\n. @28Black: most probably this is caused by restrictions set in expert mode.\nMake a backup of XPrivacy, clear all settings of XPrivacy as described in the FAQ and reboot to see if any restriction is causing this. If your paranoid level is high, disable internet beforehand.\nIf a restriction is causing this, try to figure out which one and if you found out which one, please document it in the wiki. http://wiki.faircode.eu/index.php?title=XPrivacy\n. All contributors can get the pro version without donating.\n. Can you please tell for the benefit of others what was the problem?\nMaybe document what not to do in the wiki:\nhttp://wiki.faircode.eu/index.php?title=XPrivacy\n. Are you using the latest version?\n. Then it must be specific apps being restricted, since I don't have this problem.\n. I already did, but it is very simple:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XActivityThread.java#L53\n. My best guess is that your device has not enough memory for what you are doing and that XPrivacy uses a little memory more, resulting in this problem.\n. All versions write in the logcat, try the command:\nlogcat | grep XPrivacy\n. Looking into it again\n. I have added some cleanup code, could you please try if it helps:\nhttp://www.faircode.eu/xprivacy/XPrivacy_0.40.1.apk\n. Better use the today released version 0.41, it has the same cleanup code.\n. https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XActivityThread.java#L121\n. That is why shell is only available in expert mode.\n. Will be added in the next release.\nThere will be a notification, but the restrictions will be left alone (no default deny all).\n. Cannot reproduce and nothing structural has been changed.\n. Just tested, I get 'No update available'.\n. Will be part of version 0.41\n. I don't want to move the xml file to a sub folder, so could you please split the commit?\n. Okay, I will merge it and undo the first part.\nThanks for helping!\n. This will be parts of the next release, thanks!\n. Done\n. getInstalledThemePackages: CM specific\nSystemProperties.getLongString: CM specific, calls getInt\ngetAllCellInfo: API level 17\n. https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XPrivacy.java#L112\n.

XPrivacy does not revoke permissions, but feed applications with fake data, so no delays or crashes.\n.

Thanks for your logcat, but as you can see it are not problems in the description, but bugs.\n. The two issues in the logcat will be fixed in the next release.\nPlease report any other issue you find and I will try to fix it ASAP.\n. Android permissions and privacy are no friends of each other, see the FAQ question 20.\n. @wbedard see the FAQ question 20.\nI have decide not to realize this feature request.\nI don't think it is much too trouble to dismiss the notifications.\nYou'll have to dismiss the update notification of Play store too.\n. 1. Yes\n2. Yes\n. The orange triangle displays if data has been used / tried to use by an application.\nSee also the FAQ, question 20.\n. Reason: at the time of installation of the app you hadn't enabled expert mode, but now you look at the restriction of the app you have.\n. The internet icon is there to indicate which applications have a higher risk of leaking privacy sensitive data.\n. See the FAQ, question 20.\n. Several people wanted it this way and I cannot make everybody happy, sorry.\n. Internet (and storage) restriction will be fixed in the next release.\n. For the boot restriction I need a logcat from device startup.\nPlease note that the boot restriction only prevents the boot completed broadcast to applications.\nStarting content providers is not restricted (I didn't manage to do this yet).\nSo, please describe the exact steps to reproduce.\n. Boot restrictions will be removed in the next release: use a startup manager instead.\n. See here for the reasons: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/issues/130\nI think the few dollars for XPrivacy is more than value for the money.\nDo you have any idea how many hours I already have spent developing XPrivacy?\n. This is a problem of your ROM.\nI don't have this.\n. I will see what I can do.\nIn any case it will be an expert option.\n. For testing: http://www.faircode.eu/xprivacy/XPrivacy_0.42.2.apk\n. It should work. Did you reboot after enabling XPrivacy in Xposed?\n. 'XPrivacy is not enabled in the Xposed installer' means that either the XPrivacy module is not enabled in Xposed (I don't see that in your screenshot, because it is on the other tab page) or that Xposed is not working correct or maybe that you didn't reboot after enabling XPrivacy in Xposed.\n. Sorry, this will be removed.\n. 1. It is not a core feature of XPrivacy, since it has nothing to do with privacy sensitive data\n2. Is will not prevent all parts of the application from starting, resulting in confusion and support questions\n. I have changed the title of the issue, since I feel this is what you are really searching for.\n. The API is not the problem, because I only try to use publicly documented API's.\n(there are a few necessary exceptions however)\nFacebook starts also content providers, which wasn't restricted by the existing boot category.\nBut you are right that I want to focus on privacy sensitive data only, that is already work enough.\nThe Google Framework Service ID leak will be fixed in the next release.\n. This option would result in less performance, since there needs to be done an extra check.\n. I will see what I can do.\n. This will be realized in the next release.\nBonus: fake unmounted state for sdcard\n. XPrivacy already reports internet as offline, but some applications ignore this.\n. Maybe, I will look into it.\n. @sorgelig if you want to chat (so I can help you), send me a XDA PM to exchange addresses.\n@Tungstwenty thanks for helping here.\n. Thanks for your code contribution.\nRest assured I will look into it, but I cannot do everything at the same time.\n. Why do you replace localhost by loopback?\n(it requires getting a private field, which might not always be available)\nWhy do you hook getByInetAddress, getByName and getNetworkInterfaces?\n. If this is going to work okay, inet can be marked dangerous and exclude by default, like this:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/PrivacyManager.java#L348\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/PrivacyManager.java#L560\n. InetAddress has no loopback and loopback is the same as localhost:\npublic static final InetAddress LOOPBACK =\n            new Inet4Address(new byte[] { 127, 0, 0, 1 }, \"localhost\");\npublic static final InetAddress LOOPBACK =\n            new Inet6Address(new byte[] {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 },\n                    \"localhost\", 0);\n. Internet restricting will probably not work if an application uses IP addresses instead of domain names.\nI will add DNS blocking as a separate method 'dns' in the category internet, since it can be useful in some situations.\n. DNS restriction will be part of the next release, thanks @sorgelig\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XInetAddress.java\n. Loopback address: I covered this in another way.\nXPrivacy doesn't revoke permissions, this is the way it is done:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XPackageManagerService.java#L83\n. Thanks for your insights!\nI guess you are right about getting InetAddress, although there are no public ways to create one that is not restricted.\ngetLocalHost is not hooked in my code.\n(should it be hooked and why?)\n. I will added getByInetAddress, getByName and getNetworkInterfaces to the internet category for the next release to better hide that there is a connection.\n. Can you make a pull request for this?\n(it is not that I am lazy, but it is a little bit stupid to do this again if you have already done it ;-) )\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests\nTake a look how I have integrated both internet and network in the same class:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XNetworkInterface.java#L43\n. Intent receives can be restricted by just a few lines of code:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XPrivacy.java#L217\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XActivityThread.java#L79\n. It is very simple:\n- install git on your PC\n- create a GitHub account if you don't have one (it is free)\n- fork XPrivacy (there is a button on GitHub for that)\n- clone the forked XPrivacy local: git clone  (it is right/middle on the forked page)\n- change some code ;-)\n- git commit\n- git push\n- on the forked page there is a button to do a pull request\nIf you use Eclipse:\n- clone the fork in another place than the current workspace project\n- close Eclipse\n- remove the project from the workspace (delete all files)\n- move the cloned project to the workspace\n. The permissions are used by the user interface.\nAlthough not all of these functions do no need internet permission, it is specified here to make the UI consistent.\nBasically the category requires internet permission. These new functions are used aid to hide connectivity.\nNot specifying a permission will mean the category cannot be filtered on permission anymore.\n. \"As of ICE_CREAM_SANDWICH, availability of background data depends on several combined factors, and this method will always return true.\"\n. I see no need to restrict requestRouteToHost to hide internet connectivity or do I miss something?\ngetLocalHost is not hooked in my code.\n(should it be hooked and why?)\n. I want to have as little as possible categories, so these new functions are part of the category internet.\n. Please commit all small changes you make separately to make it easier to cherry pick when needed.\n. Duplicate of #128 \n'XPrivacy is not enabled in the Xposed installer' means that either the XPrivacy module is not enabled in Xposed (I don't see that in your screenshot, because it is on the other tab page) or that Xposed is not working correct.\nIt seems that Xposed i not working correct. Ask for support in this thread: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1574401\n. Device ID can already be restricted.\n. I will certainly look into it.\nIt should be restricted if you use the category identification and/or phone.\nYou can help me by providing a logcat from device startup.\nSee the FAQ, question 22 of you don't know how.\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#frequently-asked-questions\n. I test myself with the Android Id Info app and for me everything is restricted.\nWhat version of Android are you using?\nWhich ROM are you using?\nStart 'adb logcat' before you power up your device, because I need to see if all method hooking succeeds.\n. Thanks for the logcat.\nThe hooking seems to be okay, but I don't see the device ID app starting, is that correct?\n. Is this the only XPrivacy logging for the app?\nI/XPrivacy/XAccountManager( 2781): get com.redphx.deviceid/getAccountsByType accounts=true *\n. Could you please try if this issue also exist in version 0.41 of XPrivacy?\n. Could you please provide me with the XPrivacy logging for 'Android Id info', since for me everything shown in this app is restricted. I did some testing with the device ID app: the accounts are restricted, but the device ID isn't. Despite all the different ID's I have restricted, there seems to be one more, but I have no idea yet which number the device ID app shows. Rest assured, I will figure it out somehow.\n. If you can figure out which number is show, please let me know.\nYou can look here which ID's already restricted (a lot!):\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#restrictions\n(categories identification and phone)\n. Is ##8255## showing the same device ID as the app for you?\n. Thanks for figuring this out!\nNow we have to find the package/class name of the content provider to hook it.\n. Good work here guys!\n. Class name is probably com.google.android.gsf.gservices.GservicesProvider\nThanks @vipere \n. The device model isn't restricted, so this is to be expected.\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.html\nI don't really consider this as privacy sensitive data, like names, phone numbers, etc.\n. https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#changelog ;-)\n. XPrivacy provides default for all these and you can override the default value by typing your own.\nThis needs to be done only one, so it is not a big job.\nThe problem is that random generated values can be wrong values.\n. Will be part of the next release (not as pro feature)\n. Actually there is already some time a feature stop (and still the features come), but if you really like to have this, you can contribute it. IMHO the geocoding is a good workable compromise.\n. Although this is not in a release version, thanks for reporting, I will look into it right away.\n. Will be fixed in the next release.\n. Thank you for the Turkish translation.\nContact me if you are interested in a free pro version :-)\nhttp://blog.bokhorst.biz/contact/\n. Fixed.\nIf you want to developed for XPrivacy, please contact me, maybe we can chat to discuss things.\nXDA PM or http://forum.faircode.eu/contact/\n. Any help is appreciated, this is not a small project.\n. I cannot make this, because I cannot test it.\nI have no devices that can show expandable notifications.\n. Yes and I tried to make this, but it doesn't work.\n. Provide me with another icon and I will replace the X icon with the new icon.\n. XPrivacy adds a clear action to each notification. Each notification and each action has a unique ID, so I don't know how to fix this, since Android is displaying it like this.\n. Will be added to the next release.\nThanks @vipere\n. The reason it is there is to remind people XPrivacy is restricting a feature.\nI had several times myself that I was wondering why I couldn't take a picture.\n. https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XHook.java#L68\n. The notification exists to warn you that some app tries to make a photo, record audio or video, which IMHO is useful.\n. Good work, thanks!\n. http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=43173021&postcount=683\n. Reading the system log requires super user permissions, so this is not an option for XPrivacy.\nActually there is already a kind of logging: the usage data.\nElse I see no other useful logs, except the system log.\n. I am sure there will be a lot of questions/complains if the XPrivacy app itself requests root permissions, so this is a no go. There are already enough apps to read system logs.\n. This is already there, look for the orange triangles:\nAppName request Account(getAccounts) Icon(green, mean pass)\nAppName request Identification(getString) Icon(red, mean fail)\nIf you mean popups: this is not possible, because XPrivacy works on a too deep level for that.\n. XPrivacy is not developed for advanced users, but I cannot help it that Android has not been developed with privacy in mind.\nKilling a an app: menu, settings, stop\n. Enable expert mode and drill down the category and you will have time stamps.\n. I don't want to add new UI elements and I don't see how this can be realized within the existing view.\nIf you have a suggestion, please let me know.\n. I like to see this feature, but Android doesn't have 'shaded' checkboxes and I see no other simple way to realize this.\n. Actually I am busy realizing this.\nThe third check box state (some checked) will be realized with disabling the check box.\n. Will be part of the next release.\n. Do you have an example?\nAre you sure the app list is not cached? (a lot of apps do this)\nDid you account for the 15 second settings cache?\n. I have installed side bars and it looks like a list of recent apps. Is that the same for the other apps?\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/ActivityManager.html#getRecentTasks%28int,%20int%29\nI will try to fix it.\n. Should be fixed now.\nhttp://www.faircode.eu/xprivacy/XPrivacy_1.0.1.apk\nPlease let me know if it isn't.\nI tested with Side bars only.\n. \"I mean, not recently running apps but apps that I can choose and insert from within sidebar to customize it\"\nHow can I do this? Side bars is confusing me.\n. Maybe you mean widgets?\n. http://developer.android.com/reference/android/appwidget/AppWidgetManager.html\n. Got it, now find out how this is possible.\n. Found and fixed the leak.\nTry it if you like:\nhttp://www.faircode.eu/xprivacy/XPrivacy_1.1.1.apk\n. Is there any reason why you closed the pull request?\n. I will do it manually\n. Please write English\n. Sorry, but restriction system apps is only for expert mode.\nThe point is that applying non expert restrictions to system apps can cripple your system.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks for the translation!\n. Send me an XDA PM with your full name and e-mail address if you are interested in a Pro license.\n. XPrivacy doesn't generate random values, but is using fixed values:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#restrictions\nThere is a bug in 1.0 which causes empty values to be used instead of the fixed values.\n. That would require a lot of translations\n. That is not the point, it is a lot of work for all languages.\n. Account are more than e-mail addresses, so it is not simple to solve.\nMoreover this is a bug in the Whatsapp app.\n. Will be part of the next release.\n. Subscriber ID will be in the next release.\nCreate issues for other values when relevant.\n. What is the use case for this?\n. Will be possible in next release.\n. If you like you can test:\nhttp://www.faircode.eu/xprivacy/XPrivacy_1.1.1.apk\n. Drill down the category identification and restrict GservicesProvider.\nI have tested with this app and I am sure it works.\n. I have no idea what is wrong:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/ActivityMain.java#L1084\n. I have found the cause, it should be fixed in the next release.\n. Thanks for the update\n. I guess I misunderstood you on XDA.\nI will not realize templates, but I will realize an 'All' menu in the main list.\n. IMHO it is to risky to have an 'All' in the main list.\n. XPrivacy doesn't deny permissions, so it is outside of the scope of XPrivacy.\n. Did you restart the application?\n. Please note: the back menu often doesn't stop the application.\n. Which Android version are you using?\nhttp://www.androidcentral.com/jelly-bean-brings-new-permission-along-read-external-storage\n. @cobaltdr: this issue is about something else, so create a new issue.\n. I cannot reproduce this.\nDo you mean read or write access?\n. 1. Internal storage will never be restricted (external storage and media storage are different storages)\n2. getExternalStorageState (please be concise) fakes the external storage to be offline, but an app can ignore that.\n\"I blocked the three storage related perms, and I can't access neither the external storage nor some of the internal storage, but I still can access all the /system folder.\" Correct, see first remark.\n\"I blocked get external storage and media but kept sdcard unchecked, I can access both external and internal storage.\" Correct, sdcard unchecked: external storage not restricted, internal storage: see first remark.\n\"I blocked get external storage and sd card but kept media unchecked, I can't access neither external not internal storage, except the/system folder.\" Correct, see first remark: internal storage is not the same as media storage.\nI cannot change this, since this is how Android works.\n. Could you please try if this version fixes your problem?\nhttp://www.faircode.eu/xprivacy/XPrivacy_1.2.1.apk\nIf not, please repeat your tests and make a logcat like this:\nadb logcat | grep XPackageManagerService\nand tell me which output you get when.\n. Please make the logcat as described earlier.\nRun each of your tests and make sure you kill the application before running each test.\nUse this command to extract the relevant log and tell me which test resulted in which log lines.\nadb logcat | grep XPackageManagerService\n. You are probably on Windows.\nSolution:\nadb shell\nlogcat | grep XPackageManagerService\n. Can you post the output of this:\nadb shell\nmount\n(delete the application specific lines for privacy)\n. Looking at the log and mounts it seems to me that XPrivacy works as should.\nFor you and me and probably others too it is confusing what is 'media storage'.\nRead this to get more insight:\nhttp://www.chainfire.eu/articles/113/Is_Google_blocking_apps_writing_to_SD_cards_/\n. Renaming would result in problems for existing users.\nI have referenced the article from here:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#restrictions\n. XPrivacy doesn't have random values.\nThe solution is here: http://wiki.faircode.eu/index.php?title=Google_Maps#Tips\n. Google Maps through the Google services is a special case.\nGoogle services determines the location through the Wi-Fi scan results.\nYou will see Google Maps jump back and forth between the set location and the real location if you don't restrict location or network for Google services.\n. If you found a leak: tell me which app and how to reproduce and I will look into it.\n. I have tried a lot of things, but I cannot reproduce this.\nPlease describe the exact steps to reproduce this.\n. This seems to be a problem in your ROM, since there is no IntentReceiver in ActivityMain.\nDo you happen to use a Samsung phone with a multi window feature?\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/a/14987170/1794097\n. Then complain @Samsung ...\n. Will be fixed in the next release\n. Thanks for the update.\n. Duplicate of #178\n. Thanks for the update!\n.

I see what you mean and will ask @Looki75 to look into this.\n. \"After clearing and importing XPrivacy's data, the problem hasn't happened again.\"\nThere must have been some data dangling.\n. Could you please try with only YouTube>system>getRunningAppProcess?\n. I will close this issue for now, please comment if you encounter this problem again and don't forget the provide a logcat (see the FAQ for how to).\n. Thanks for reporting back!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Found the problem, will be fixed in the next release.\n. Works for me in 1.4.\nWhat name did you try?\n. Will be added in the next release.\n. Holo theme is just like this.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the update\n. An empty MAC-address lets some application crash.\n. The description lists a number of defaults, but you can see them all here:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/PrivacyManager.java#L714\n. Thanks again for the update.\n. Please create one issue for one problem.\n. 3) Already asked before: it is not so hard to swipe it away\n3a) That would be at the price of valuable screen space\n. 3) Everything is checked by default for new applications to prevent leaking privacy sensitive data from the beginning.\n3a) I guess you mean in the notification: I cannot make this, since I don't have a device that supports this.\n. \"There's a bug that happens let's say if you install 2 new apps from the Market, you will get the notification from xPrivacy and you click on the first one and then if you go to the second app, xPrivacy will actually still show the first app, so you need to close the app and open it again and search for the (second) app manually.\nThere's another bug that happenens quite a lot, sometimes when i want to run xPrivacy, the app will actually show the last opened app that was opened in xPrivacy and then you need to click the \"xPrivacy\" on the top left corner of the screen, which should mean \"Back\", but the app closes itself and then you need to run it again to get to the app list.\"\nShould be fixed in the next release.\n. See the changed issue title.\n. IMHO it is not bad to have some color (not too bright) for core functions.\nThis includes at least data used.\n. My preference is a not too bright orange as color, since it is a warning/attention and not an error that an app uses data.\nI don't think # is a good symbol, because it can be associated with super user.\nElse, I am open to suggestions.\n. @NaabKing what do you mean?\n. Looks nice, what are the puppet and star icons for?\n. I don't like the idea to have a lot of icons, just what is really needed.\nIt is not possible to have an icon for each category, so browser and account are not an option for me (consistency).\nJust discuss the ideas here and we will see where we get.\n. Next version will bring back colors.\n. https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/tree/master/res/drawable\n. Discussion on the UI will go on forever anyway.\n1.5 has just been releases ...\n. XPrivacy fetches the installed application list from Android and doesn't have a copy of its own, so this cannot be fixed.\n. This can be expected, the internet permission is revoked from the application, a firewall works differently.\nIt is also in the description.\n. Some apps ignore this.\n. This is helpful, thanks.\nI will fix it in the next release.\n. Thanks for the update\n. XPrivacy will only use standard Android API's.\n. http://www.modaco.com/page/news/_/android/developers-add-support-for-samsung-multi-window-to-your-apps-r823\nI will think about it, but I am a little bit hesitant to add this, since it is not Android generic.\n. So, this is a workable solution?\n. Thanks\n. I agree with caching, else I have no idea where Google+ gets the e-mail from.\nA solution is to allow Google+ access to the accounts it needs.\n. Interesting, why does PicasaSync want to know which applications are installed?\n. The first exception is because one application references another application, which cannot be found because the application list is empty because it is restricted. I see no obvious way to solve this, except by allowing the application to see the list of installed applications.\nAs a side note, the application seems to be using an outdated mechanism:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/12649048/what-is-action-androidname-com-android-vending-install-referrer\n. Since the installed application list is not 'hot' privacy sensitive data I am moving the category system to expert mode to prevent novice users from running into this problem.\n. I don't like to have a lot of options, so I won't fix this, sorry.\n. Thanks for your suggestions.\nSystem apps, like Play store do change however.\n. The next release will have a setting to filter system applications.\n. What recovery do you use?\n. Please remove the strings marked with translatable=\"false\"\n. Thanks for the update\n. I do test with Network info II and I have:\nMAC: DE:FA:CE:DE:FA:CE\nIMEI: DEFACE\nIMSI: Not available\nOperator: DEFACE\nCountry: 001 (=Test network)\nMCC+MNC: 00101 (=Test network)\nSo nothing of the original data is visible.\nDid you restrict everything?\n. MCC and MNC are maximum three digits, see wikipedia.\nCountry is a two letter code (ISO standard).\nI don't see any logging related to the network category.\n. The MCC and MNC are in the phone category.\n. Try restricting everything for Network Info II, wait 15 seconds and try again.\n. I like to see a logcat of the start of your device.\n- power off your device\n- enter\nlogcat | grep XPrivacy\n- start your device\nThe first 500 lines is enough.\n. I really need to see the logcat from device startup.\nadb logcat should wait for the device to become available.\n. Unfortunately there is still not there what I like to see :-(\nI am looking for a list if lines of XPrivacy with '... hooked ...'\n. I see your problem, you are trying to run the logcat command on the device.\nThat will always be to late.\nSee the FAQ for how to logcat from your computer.\n. \"I had opened another issue about the search button and the field next to it being greyed in xprivacy's settings, maybe it's related?\"\nThis is because the Google geocoder is not available.\n. MCC: hooked android.telephony.TelephonyManager.getNetworkCountryIso/phone\nMCC+MNC: hooked android.telephony.TelephonyManager.getNetworkOperator/phone\nName: hooked android.telephony.TelephonyManager.getNetworkOperatorName/phone\nISO country: hooked android.telephony.TelephonyManager.getSimCountryIso/phone\nI am quite sure it should work.\nNobody else complained about this and it works for me.\n. \n. Unfortunately this is not possible, since this can only be done at kernel level (not in Android).\n. I see what you mean, but the internet symbol indicates if an application has Android internet permission or not.\nRestricting internet doesn't change that.\n. I will not realize this.\nIf your language translation is incomplete, send an update and I will include it in the next release.\nIf you want to temporarily switch to another language, you can do so in the system settings.\n. Thanks again for the update\n. \"... the number is up to 19 digits long, including a single check digit ...\"\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/res/layout/settings.xml#L162\nI don't see 20 digits.\n. Ah, I see: \"However, the GSM Phase 1[4] defined the ICCID length as 10 octets (20 digits) ...\"\nI will increase it to 20 digits.\n. Will be solved in the next release.\n. Thanks again for the translation update!\n. Thanks for the update\n. Do you mean in the application list of when viewing a single application?\n. Will be in the next release.\n. Will be implemented in next release\n. ./libcore/luni/src/main/java/libcore/io/IoBridge.java\npublic static FileDescriptor open(String path, int flags) throws FileNotFoundException\n. Will be fixed in the next release\n. Maybe if the category ID for Android itself was restricted, but my best guess is that there is also an open method without parameters, but I have to look into this. Else calling isRestricted may have side effects in some environments.\n. @unclefab version 1.6.1 should solve the problem.\nCan you please contact me through XDA PM for some tests, so I can pinpoint the problem?\n. Will be fixed and work in the next release.\n. Contacts do not have a type.\nThey can have a group (optional) and/or a user set label (optional).\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Can you please post a link to the app, so I can look into it?\n. I have just tested and for me the location is 'Christmass Island'.\nCould you please post a logcat like this:\n- Power off your device\n- run 'adb logcat | grep XPrivacy' on the command line\n- Power on your device\nI like to see at least all messages with '... hooked ...'\n. Yes, please send me a log file.\n. Do you get an alert saying 'Incompatible ...' when you start XPrivacy?\n. Did you flash the Xposed fix?\nWas there a ROM update after you have flashed the Xposed fix?\n. Could somebody try with this version? http://d-h.st/nST\nAt least leaking the SSID should be fixed and maybe the location leak too.\n. Also try to flash the Xposed fix again, it is the most logical explanation for the location leak.\n. @vipere decompiled Network Info II, thanks!\ngetLastKnownLocation and requestLocationUpdates are used to get the location, which are both hooked by XPrivacy. In the one log I got I see requestLocationUpdates, but no getLastKnownLocation.\n. If the previous test version still doesn't restrict the location, then please try this version: http://d-h.st/Noc\n. Could you please send me your exported XPrivacy settings?\n. Did anybody try the second test version from above?\n. @GhostlyCrowd thanks for your exported settings.\nThe strange thing there is no trace of Network Info II in the export file.\nIt is unlikely that there is something wrong with the settings, else there would have been massive other problems.\nI have no idea how this is caused.\nDid you update Network Info II recently?\nCould everybody report which Android version / ROM / device is being used, to see if there is a system in it.\n. \"CM nightly updated daily\": do you also flash the Xposed fix daily?\n(sorry if this is a stupid question for you, but it is one of the possible causes)\n. Given the one log I got, I can tell getLastKnownLocation is hooked by XPrivacy, but calls to it are not intercepted.\n(there is enough logging to cover 99% of the problems)\nYou could try to grep on getLastKnownLocation to get more insight.\nThis could be a bug in the Xposed framework.\nNetwork Info II does call both getLastKnownLocation and requestLocationUpdates, but seems to get the location from the first one. The second one is also covered by XPrivacy.\n. This probably means wechat is caching the location itself.\nThis is not something XPrivacy can prevent.\n. Just thinking: wechat caching locations is consistent with not calling getLastKnowLocation.\n. @GhostlyCrowd what is \"the weird location issue\" ?\n@28Black isn't the Whatsapp location not a location acquired based on external IP?\n. @treare no it is at most accurate to a city\n. Please check if all the functions in the location category for the application are restricted.\nGo to the XPrivacy application settings and drill down the location category and make sure there is a check everywhere.\n. We are getting somewhere.\nWhatsApp is using Google Play services to get a location.\nIf I fully restrict Google Play services (the category + all functions), clear data, force stop, WhatsApp will find me on Christmass Island.\nPlease report for the other apps (not WhatsApp) if this helps too.\n. Yes, I will make this easier in the next release, so this can be done per app.\n. About the \"weird issue\", it depends on the method the application gets a location if a spoofed location can be returned.\n. Here 1.7+ ;-)\n. @GhostlyCrowd this cannot be prevented, it is not possible to spoof the location in all cases, so it depends on the method(s) the application is using for spoofing to work. Some applications use multiple methods and grab the location that comes first.\n. @treare Already working on that ;-)\n. XPrivacy doesn't block the GPS, it only spoof the location or returns an empty location.\nSo the GPS icon will appear as normal.\n. Test version 1.7.1: http://d-h.st/0of\nInstall, wait until XPrivacy notifies 'Reboot required'\nDrill down category location and check 'connect'\nThis will prevent the application from connecting to Google Play services.\n. Reboot is still required to make it work ...\n. Whatsapp caches the location itself. Clearing data helps.\n. Flightradar is using Google maps, see the wiki for how to restrict Google Maps.\nSpeaking about the wiki, could you please document in the wiki what we have found out here?\nAm I correct we have an explanation/fix for all leaks now?\n. Flight radar comes with the Google Maps library, meaning that it should be restricted as Google Maps (GS).\nDid you also kill WhatsApp after clearing data?\nTo be clear: if connect is ticked it should not be necessary to restrict GS.\n. \"Did you also kill WhatsApp after clearing data?\": yes\n. I am closing this issue now, since the discussion is getting to long and the problem for most cases seemed to be explained/fixed. Create a new issue for the apps where there is still a location leak.\n. Yes, I will add it to the changelog, I just forgot.\n. Thanks again for the update!\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Can you please provide a logcat?\n- power off your device\n- run 'adb logcat'\n- power on your device\n- post the log on pastebin or similar and a link to it here\n. You can try to flash the Xposed fix.\nI don't see a change in 1.6 that could cause this, but you'll never know.\n. If you can access the device with adb shell and you have enabled super user for shell you can try to delete the folder on your device:\n/data/xposed\n. Sorry for this inconvenience.\nI have just released version 1.6.1 with one of the changes reverted, which is hopefully the right one.\n. The problem seems to be solved in 1.6.1:\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=43598147&postcount=1202\nI will try to brew a flashable zip to disable the Xposed modules.\n. Try to flash this: http://d-h.st/gMI\nThis should disable XPrivacy in Xposed, so you can update.\nAfter that you need to install Xposed from the Xposed installer again.\n. Just too late I see.\n. Thanks for the translation.\nPlease contact me through an XDA PM if you are interested in the pro version.\n. Thanks for the update.\n. Thanks for the update.\n. It means that internet, storage and system will not be applied for new applications / the all menu.\nYes, it was in your test version, but there was a tiny bug, that is now fixed.\n. Working on it, patience :-)\n. Thanks for the update\n. Thanks again for the update\n. Thanks for the update\n. 1) using restrictions marked dangerous can let applications crash. It is also used to highlight system apps.\n2) It is already translated into too much languages to change it now\n. Yes, the meaning is right.\n. I can read German and it seems good and clear to me.\n. No need to excuse!\n. Thanks for the update\n. Thanks for the update\n. Thanks for the update\n. Thanks for reporting, I will fix it ASAP.\n. This should be fixed now.\n. Thanks for the update\n. This might be cause of a template. Also, category internet, storage and system are not part of 'all' anymore (see also changelog). These needs to be set manually on or off.\n. All toggles only the main categories, not the exceptions. Some function restrictions get an exception if the main category is restricted. See the usage instructions for details.\n. The side effect of this will be that accidentally unchecking in the main view in the category all will result in losing function exceptions. I will think about a clear button.\n. This is by design.\n/proc is a method that is marked as dangerous.\n. Look at the labels of the issue: wontfix.\n. Duplicate of #250\n. The XPrivacy remover is for emergencies only and not part of the normal procedure.\n. Please make a backup of wechat and clear its data, then setup wechat again to make sure it is not storing the location itself.\n. Thanks for trying.\nAnother suggestion: try restricting the location for the Google framework services.\nSee the wiki under Google Maps for more info.\n. Thanks for trying!\nOkay, another try (since I cannot believe there are any more methods to get a location than already restricted).\nDisable internet for wechat and see if it can still get a location (possibly clearing data again).\nIf so, it uses the external IP to get a location.\nIn that case it shouldn't be very precise.\n. XPrivacy will not block the GPS icon. Everything should appear as normal as possible to the app.\nNo, I don't forget about it. I don't like half finished apps. Do it good or don't do it.\n. Do you get an alert saying 'Incompatible ...' when you start XPrivacy?\n. I meant after starting XPrivacy.\n. Can you try to capture a logcat, so I can look into this problem?\n. Duplicate of #233 \nI am merging all location leaking issues into one, since it is probably the same problem.\n. Post it on pastebin or similar and post the link here.\n. Please document this in the wiki.\nhttp://wiki.faircode.eu/index.php?title=XPrivacy\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Will be covered in the next release.\n. @Cerberus-tm I am not going to describe the individual methods, because that would be a repetition of the Android documentation. The methods are only for really advanced users.\nThe restriction categories are described here:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#restrictions\nIf something will be available offline, it will be exactly this.\nIf something is not clear in this description, please let me know here, so it can be improved.\n. Patience, I have made preparations for this in 1.7.20.\n. I have updated the wiki with a description of each category and added hyperlinks for information about the functions.\nThis will not be integrated into the application.\n. Thank you, but before I merge I need to know if these icons are licensed compatible with GNU GPLv3.\n. Please document this in the wiki.\nCreate a new heading when needed.\nhttp://wiki.faircode.eu/index.php?title=XPrivacy\n. @XS666: better create a new page for this in the application list\nhttp://wiki.faircode.eu/index.php?title=XPrivacy#Applications\n(copy an existing one for the layout)\n. Please add this to the wiki too to help others.\n. You did very well!\nI hope it was fun to do.\nI have reference your page from the top of the main page.\nhttp://wiki.faircode.eu/index.php?title=XPrivacy\nMaybe you should look into the markdown, so you can make headings etc.\nhttp://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\nYou can also look at the other pages (just press edit at the top), to see how things work.\n. Looks great, thanks!\n. I guess the application is caching data, even when it was replaced by XPrivacy.\nThe logging contains only warnings, nothing to worry about.\n. Looking at the log above, you should get 'Incompatible android.net.wifi.WifiInfo', when you start XPrivacy, right?\nIf so, press ok and send the info to me.\n. Duplicate of #233 \nI am merging all location leaking issues into one, since it is probably the same problem.\n. Thanks for adding these icons!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Android doesn't have tri-state check boxes.\n. If you know a better solution, please let me know.\nBut tri-state check boxes is not an option.\nNow it is like this in the main view for the 'all' category:\n1. The upper filter check box selects apps with some or all restrictions\n2. Apps with no restrictions appear as unchecked\n3. Apps with some restrictions appear as disabled (grayed)\n4. Apps with all restrictions appear as checked\nDangerous restrictions are not taken into account for the above.\n. How do you propose this should work, with the requirement the user interface / screen layout should not be changed to much.\n. Thanks again for the update.\n. Thanks again for the update.\n. Faking disabled state does not necessarily prevent application from asking locations.\nMost applications I have seen do not check if a location provider is enabled at all, but simple ask location updates for all providers (GPS, network, etc).\nThe location leak through Google Play services has been resolved already (issue #233).\n. This will be part of the next release, but will be disable by default.\n. This feature is not enabled by default.\n. It returns the original value when the function is ticked.\n. Ah, okay, you are right, I will fix it in the next release.\n. On second thought; it is right as it is, false means the provider is not enabled.\n. Which matches fake offline\n. Thanks for the update\n. This is not within the scope of XPrivacy, sorry.\n. My best guess is that the application is using the external IP to resolve the location.\nIf I am right the location should not be very precise.\n. Cell towers should be blocked too.\nDo you get an alert saying 'Incompatible ...' when you start XPrivacy?\n. Duplicate of #233 \nI am merging all location leaking issues into one, since it is probably the same problem.\n. The Xposed log shows that you have restricted shell.\nThe Xposed log is not useful for this, a logcat might be.\n. Do you get an alert saying 'Incompatible ...' when you start XPrivacy?\n. For me nothing, except the signal strength, is visible in Network info II.\nPlease provide me with a complete logcat from device startup to using the restricted Network info II.\nYou should start 'adb logat' on your computer before turning on your device, or at least before the Android boot animation starts.\n. Duplicate of #233 \nI am merging all location leaking issues into one, since it is probably the same problem.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. I see no XPrivacy in the exception, so I think it is not related to XPrivacy.\n. I have locked the issue, because it was already explained on XDA that XPrivacy is not for what you are trying to accomplish.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Diplicate of #275 \n. Duplicate of #257\n. IMHO the title 'Check to restrict' check be clear enough.\nAnd does green mean 'restricted' or not 'restricted'?\n. I don't think there is a loop.\nTry checking with BetterBatteryStats if you can find out more.\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1179809\n. I am testing a lot with XPrivacy and I cannot reproduce this.\n. Duplicate of #233 \n. I think the current icons are okay or do you have something specific in mind?\n. Don't worry, I appreciate any thought.\nIt is good to have these icons as reference here.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. /proc is a folder and cannot be spoofed\n/proc contains information like the kernel command line (serial number) and CPU info.\n. XmlUtils/FastXmlSerializer: these are taken from official Android source and I don't want to change them to make updating easier.\n.gitignore: don't use Windows ;-)\n. Not tested yet:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/commit/92ddd3ba03b05f284d12b38737f8e7017f24eb40\n. I consider this as a bug.\n. Will be fixed in the next release.\n. This bug reappeared due to restructuring.\nIt should be fixed in this version: http://d-h.st/5RJ\nPlease let me know if it is or isn't.\n. Yes, it would be very handy, but it is not possible, because low level it is not possible to translate a uid to a package name and even if it was possible it would slow down things.\n. Export translates to packages names and imports back to uid's already\n. Thanks for the update!\n. This is for emergencies only.\n. There will probably be another solution for this later on.\nThanks for trying to help.\n. I have though about this, but auto backup is something a backup manager should do.\nI try to keep the code base as small as possible, because everything that is added has to be maintained too.\n. Sorry, I will no make this.\nAccounts and contacts can be useful, but I see no need for applications.\n. Okay, then there is a good reason, but I will solve it the simple way: select one app to be visible.\n. Popup windows are not possible, because XPrivacy works low level.\nThe idea is to implement this like selecting accounts or contacts, but with the different that only one application can be selected.\n. Unfortunately it is not possible to implement this.\n. I have recently remove the code to delete the configured restictions and usage data, because I planned to re-use it when the application is installed again (it will get the same uid in most cases).\n. I have never seen a case it was incorrect.\nAndroid stores information about uninstalled applications.\nIt is even possible to request a list of uninstalled applications (which can be restricted ;-) )\n. Will be implemented in next release.\n. After installing an app there will be a notification to review the settings, either previous or fully restricted.\nYou can always check/uncheck what you like at that moment.\nIMHO that is enough.\n. Export settings, clear data, import settings if you really care about this, but for the functioning of XPrivacy it is not important. We cannot have both saving for reinstall and delete on uninstall.\n. Flightradar didn't work for me too, until I realized I forgot to flash the Xposed fix after using the Xposed installer.\nFlightradar does not use the connect method and also not GS.\n. Whatsapp does use the Google Play services connect method and cannot get a location after clearing data and restarting.\n. Restricting connect is useful to restrict locations for apps that obtain the location through Google Play services.\nThis allows to restrict on per app basis instead for all apps using Google Play services locations.\n. Correct\n. Flightradar can be spoofed using the normal location restrictions.\n. Sorry, I really did my best to fix it.\n. Please post a more complete logcat\n.

Will be fixed in the next release.\nThanks for reporting.\n. No, I could reproduce this problem myself.\n. Released ...\n. It is very unlikely that the two lines of code I changed in version 1.7.3 will cause a boot loop.\n. I am quite certain this has nothing to do with XPrivacy.\nThe download may be corrupt (virus scanner, etc) or there is simple not enough storage on your device (remove apps).\n. Alternatively install/update from the Play store.\n. Nobody else reported about this problem.\nMaybe a logcat can help pinpoint the problem.\n. I am not going to change how Android works.\nIt is just a standard CheckTextView:\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/CheckedTextView.html\n. Most methods are hooked only once: when Android starts, so this is not an option.\nMoreover I don't think hooking of methods in itself is a big overhead.\nWhat could be optimized is checking if something should be restricted or not (isRestricted), but this isn't easy due to the nature of Android: all applications run in their own VM and cannot share data, except through a few mechanisms.\nCurrently the main sharing mechanism is the privacy content provider and if it can not be reached, reading of the configuration file. There is a cache in place for both mechanisms and settings files are cached until they are changed, but the XPrivacy cache timeout is quite fast (else new settings take too much time to apply).\nThere is a possible faster mechanism for accessing restriction settings: Unix domain sockets, but this is a lot of work to realize and would probably come with its own difficulties (permissions, server availability, stability, etc):\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/LocalServerSocket.html\nSo, no easy solution here, unfortunately.\nInstead of creating a lite version, you could set the cache timeout to 24 hours and reboot to apply new settings.\nI don't see how XPrivacy can let the battery usage jump from 0,25% to 1% per hour. This is not a difference between almost nothing happening and a tiny little bit more happening (checking for settings). So, please double check if XPrivacy is really causing this.\nI have made a custom ROM to prolong the battery life of my phone to the maximum and I don't see any change with XPrivacy installed.\n. Thanks again for the update.\n. Thanks for the update\n. This is most probably caused by restricting getScanResult.\nExport your settings or make a backup of XPrivacy and clear data as described in the FAQ.\nThen reboot and check if the problem is gone.\n. This cannot be done from Android and if it is done it will be device specific and thus outside the scope of XPrivacy.\n. They can all be restricted, but read\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#limitations\nIf you found a leak, create an issue describing the leak with a link to the app (one per leak) and include a logcat.\nBe sure the restrict the app fully and reboot before creating an issue.\n. Probably not, this is how Android works.\n. Untick getActiveNetworkInfo, getAllNetworkInfo and getNetworkInfo in the category internet for the application.\n. Next version will have these functions marked as dangerous.\n. Thank for the translation!\n. Thanks for the translation\n.

Could you please test if this is okay for you: http://d-h.st/Eyb\nI tested with OI File Manager: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openintents.filemanager\nNot all file manager let XPrivacy specify the folder and file type.\n. Try OI File Manager\n. In the next release seconds will be added to the file name, so there will be no more overwrites.\nIf there is no suitable file manager, the file name will be /sdcard/.xprivacy/XPrivacy.xml\nIf there is a suitable file manager, the file name will be /sdcard/.xprivacy/XPrivacy_yyyyMMdd_HHmmss.xml\nOI File manager is a suitable file manager.\n. Support for (OI) File managers was explicitly request, so this will not be removed, sorry.\n. The idea is that if there is no suitable file manager installed the file name for importing/exporting is the same (without time component in the file name). If the exported file name is XPrivacy_yyyyMMdd_HHmmss.xml when there is no suitable file manager installed, importing would be hard.\nWhat is exactly your problem?\nDo you have a suitable file manager installed?\nIs is correctly detected by XPrivacy?\nDoes the file manager pop up when importing/exporting?\n. \"Clearly those file managers also allow you to choose file for importing. But isIntentAvailable() returns false somehow.\" So, this is the real problem.\n\"Also it is safe to assume that person who installs Xposed framework / Xprivacy definitely has good file manager installed.\" No, we cannot assume that, there are also a lot of novice users that care about privacy.\nCan you try to figure out why isIntentAvailable returns false?\nIs the function erroneous or is being checked for the wrong intent?\n. Can you check if the above commit fixes your problem?\n. Test version 1.9.10: http://d-h.st/bqy\n. This is a version with the original code restored, but using PackageManager.GET_ACTIVITIES: http://d-h.st/I6u\n. Test version: http://d-h.st/w5l\n. Thanks for testing!\n. Unfortunately you have now translated English in Norwegian.\nYou should update the strings in values-nb-rNO, values-nn-rNO, values-no-rNO\n. The simplest is to just delete the forked repo and fork again.\n. Out of memory errors cannot be fixes, they are what they are.\n. I guess you have set more restrictions since then.\n. I will see how I can improve this.\nHopefully I don't have to write my own XML parser and can the built-in parser be tweaked.\n. I will switch to the SAX parser to save memory.\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/javax/xml/parsers/SAXParser.html\n. Could you please test if this version works okay for you: http://d-h.st/Eyb\n(if you have a file manager installed, there is a bonus ;-)\n. See also #327 \n. There is little more I can do than I already did, sorry.\n. That would not be compatible across devices.\n. There are different versions of SQLite database, depending on Android version.\n. Too much work that I rather spent on something else (for example restricting Android 4.3)\n. @GhostlyCrowd \nAn SQLite database doesn't necessarily use less memory.\nThe situation with the new XML parser has greatly been improved.\nThe memory footprint of the new parser is magnitudes lower that the old one.\n@pogovault which device are you using and how much free memory do you have?\n. This doesn't say anything about memory usage when reading/writing XML files (XPrivacy doesn't manipulate the XML files in any other way). XML is the standard to export/import data. Some people edit the exported file manually.\nFiltering/sorting has nothing to do with this.\nAgain: I don't expect problems with the new XML parser, even with a lot of apps, unless the device is already low on memory. The XML parse process as it is now uses hardly any memory.\n\"... the minimum memory required for a SAX parser is proportional to the maximum depth of the XML file ... and the maximum data involved in a single XML event ...\"\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_API_for_XML\nThe depth of XML of the XPrivacy XML is the minimum you can get: one and the data involved is almost nothing.\n. 'All' does nothing with the XML file.\n. It uses shared preferences.\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/SharedPreferences.html\n. SharedPreferences are highly optimized by Google.\n. This is not import/export related, but another problem.\nCan you try if this version fixes your problem: http://d-h.st/bOW\n. Thanks for reporting back.\nI am glad this problem is fixed now too.\n. @cobaltdr what where you doing? Can you provide a logcat?\n. @cobaltdr which device are you using? How much free (not available) memory is there?\n. Thanks, but can you give a more complete logging? (more lines, I need to see the stack trace)\n. The out of memory exception in the log above is caused while building the application list, not while importing.\n. You need to install an app to see the free memory.\nAvailable memory shown by Android is just the amount of memory your device has (used or not).\n. Apparently the import succeeds (I don't see any error message about it in the provide log) and after that there is too little memory to build the application list (to be exact: it fails when rendering the application icons).\n. Yes, please do and include the files from /data/data/biz.bokhorst.xprivacy/* if you trust me.\n. I don't want to post it here, you can either use this contact form: http://forum.faircode.eu/contact/\nor send me an XDA PM and I will reply with my address.\n. @cobaltdr \nI have thoroughly studied the log file you have sent me.\nThe import starts with 93% of the available memory in use.\n07-26 07:59:39.365 D/dalvikvm(25231): GC_CONCURRENT freed 1971K, 7% free 48471K/51911K, paused 4ms+7ms, total 44ms\nThe import itself succeeds and the used memory reaches 97% during the import, meaning that the import itself does use only a little bit of memory (4% of the total memory).\nAfter that you get an out of memory exception while XPrivacy builds the application list again.\nWith 93-97% of memory in use it is probably not possible to avoid this.\nYou will have to make some more memory available by uninstalling other memory hungry applications.\nI will try to reduce the memory footprint of XPrivacy in the next release, but don't expect wonders.\n. @cobaltdr you are the first one to get this: XPrivacy that should use less resources (and memory)\nhttp://d-h.st/L88\nRead the changelog first:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#changelog\n. @cobaltdr could you please try version 1.7.15 and then 1.7.16 (last one is newer than I previously linked) and provide a log if you still get an out of memory error?\n. Version 1.7.18 might solve your problem.\n. I see no change which can cause boot loops.\nCan you give me a logcat of the boot loop?\n. There is already a 1.7.19\n. @cobaltdr as @GhostlyCrowd  suggest you should really look into your configuration.\nThere is little I can do anymore seen from the perspective of XPrivacy.\nAnything that could be improved is improved now.\nAs soon as Dev-Host allows me, I will upload version 1.7.23, which runs the privacy provider in a separate process.\nThis version will be available as beta version in the Play store in a few hours.\n. Version 1.7.23: http://d-h.st/f0D\n. @cobaltdr maybe you should try another ROM\n. With a bit of luck this version will solve the out of memory problem:\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=44078895&postcount=1956\n. Accounts and contacts were not exported until so far.\nThe just released version export accounts and contacts, but only imports them when it is the same device.\n. You should know by now that I pay attention to every litlle detail ... ;-)\n. Yes, just restrict GSF the way you want. Disable the system apps filter in the settings to get GSF in the apps list.\n. That is to be expected. Try figuring out which category/function is responsible for this. If you figured it out, then please document it for the benefit of others.\n. http://wiki.faircode.eu/index.php?title=Google_Play_services\n. Thanks again for the update.\n. Nothing has recently been changed to restricting locations.\n. Maybe you need to kill and start the application again.\n. Thank you for the translation update!\n. Thanks again for the translation update!\n. Will be in next release, thanks for the update!\n. Thanks again for the update!\n. I will see what I can do, but I won't make anything app (Dropbox, etc) specific.\n. Can you please try if the solution in this beta version is satisfying: http://d-h.st/oQD\n. Thanks again for the update!\n. Thanks again for the update.\n. Thanks guys for doing this!\n. Yes, I forgot, I seem to be the only one actually reading things ;-)\nCan you help me shorten the text? (while I continue to develop new features ...)\n. Yes, please.\n. @28Black I don't think it is a good idea to mention exceptions in the description, moreover these categories are marked as dangerous anyway (meaning that they will not be checked from the all view).\n. I have just read the English translation, but please avoid the usage of the word 'permission', als in the translation.\nXPrivacy doesn't do anything with Android permissions, except for filtering in the user interface.\nThe correct terminology is: data category/usage/restriction\n\"prevent apps access to all or to selected contacts and accounts\"\nPeople could think this is the only thing XPrivacy does.\n\"wrong data\" -> the data is not wrong, but fake\nI am not sure if required Android permissions should be part of the application description.\n. Please let me know when it is finished, so I can update the Play store description.\n. I have put the German translation in the Play store, it should be available in a few hours.\nCan you please also translate: 'The ultimate, yet easy to use, privacy manager'\nAnd one question: \"Rechtemanagement\": does this mean 'Permission management'?\nI am asking because that is not what XPrivacy does.\nRevoking permissions (permission management) lets applications crash.\n. Thanks for the explanation!\n@28Black @SebRut @craiq if anyone of you don't have the pro version and like to have it, please contact me through XDA PM.\n. Thank you!\n. I guess this is a French translation of the current English translation?\nIs it finished?\n. So, it is finished now?\n. I have added the French translation to the Play store, maybe you want to check it.\nThanks for the work done here!\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=biz.bokhorst.xprivacy\n. I have updated the French translation of the Play store description.\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=biz.bokhorst.xprivacy\nIt can take a few hours before it is visible.\nThanks again!\n. How do you know Chive sees Facebook?\nAn app can request Android to start and app without seeing it.\n. That still doesn't mean the app can see Facebook.\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html#startActivity(android.content.Intent)\n. I see not how starting another application can leak privacy sensitive data.\n. When Facebook is installed it always run in the background, whether you have started it or not.\nYou can see that in the new usage data view and/or in the logcat.\n. The usage data is meant to hunt for problems, even if you don't know which app is causing it.\n. Thanks again\n. Thanks again\n. I use a device with a small screen myself and I am worried about the space it takes.\nNot everybody has or likes big screens.\nMoreover I think it is easier to see at a glance with checkboxes what is restricted than with toggles.\n. Already documented: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#similar-solutions\n. Thanks for the update\n. This message only appears if the view category was restricted, so double check your restrictions.\nChanged restrictions may take up to 15 seconds to be active.\n. I am quite sure 'view' is restricted for the ebay.\nIf this was a bug, there would have been massive complaints.\nDisable all filters in the settings and check the restrictions for ebay again.\n. eBay = uid 10076\nThe last screenshot doesn't show anything in the view category, but there must be something, else you will not get the restricted message.\nSo, reproduce the problem, go to the usage view, look for 10076 and else look for anything in the view category.\n. Next version will show the uid.\nUsage data is queue and can be delayed.\nDo I understand correctly selecting allowed contacts works now without crash?\n. Maybe WhatsApp caches contacts.\n. Please create a new issue for this and I will see what I can figure out.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. I don't see your point, the main view allows you to edit the restrictions for each category for all applications and if you tap on an application icon you can edit all restrictions for an application.\n. Try clicking on the pencil and you will get an message about it.\nThere are also screenshots showing this.\n. If the translation is not okay, it should be improved.\nSwitching languages is not an application function.\nYou can switch languages using the Android settings or with the Per App Settings module.\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2072081\n. Duplicate of #354\n. See the FAQ about multi-user support.\n. I am fully aware of this, since I have already updated XPrivacy for Android 4.3.\n. Multi-user support will work the exact same way as multi-user support works for Android.\n. @johnwmail could you please provide some screenshots?\n. The reason I asked for screenshots is that I don't have devices that support multiple users.\nYou can help me by providing a logcat with XPrivacy debugging enabled for the last case:\n\nI config AndFTP with primary user(uid 10108) WITH network permission,\nand config AndFTP with restriction user(uid 1110108) WITHOUT network permission,\nbut AndFTP still can connect the network with restriction user(uid 1110108).\n. BTW, if you want to prevent internet access, you will have to restrict the internet category, not the network category and restart the application (or reboot your device).\n\nAlso, make sure you have 'inet' in the internet category restricted.\n. @johnwmail thanks for the logcat! I was able to pinpoint the problem. Could you please try if this version restricts internet (inet) and storage (media and sdcard) correctly on your device? http://d-h.st/pJg\n.

Don't forget to restart the app (kill) or reboot your device.\n. @johnwmail it isn't that I trust you ;-)\nIt is just what the log file says.\nCan you please post a listing of /data/data/biz.bokhorst.xprivacy/shared_prefs\nAnd the contents of:\n- biz.bokhorst.xprivacy.provider.10108.xml\n- biz.bokhorst.xprivacy.provider.1110108.xml\n  (if existing)\n.

I/XPrivacy/XProcess(  639): Queue usage data=1110108/storage/sdcard=false size=227\nThe queue size is quite big, so did you really kill and restart the app?\nEnable the experimental functions in the main XPrivacy settings and you will be able to kill the app from the application details view by pressing on the application icon.\n. The settings file for 1110108 confirms that internet should be restricted.\n<boolean name=\"Method.internet.getActiveNetworkInfo\" value=\"false\" />\n    <boolean name=\"Method.internet.inet\" value=\"false\" />\n    <boolean name=\"Method.internet.getNetworkInfo\" value=\"false\" />\n    <boolean name=\"Restricted.internet\" value=\"true\" />\nHowever, the logcat says something else.\nSo, I am wondering if the same settings file is read.\nCan you please execute:\nsu\ncd /\nfind | grep 10108\nand post the output?\n. I also like to see the file permissions of the found files.\n. It took quite some research, but this version should provide working multi-user support: http://d-h.st/33y\nPlease clear XPrivacy data as described in the FAQ before testing.\nIf it doesn't work, I like to see the output of the following commands:\nsu\ncd /\nfind | grep 10108\nand again the file permissions.\nAt least three minutes after boot:\nps | grep xpri\nThanks for your patience!\n. That is too bad.\nCould you please provide a logcat of the FC?\n. I managed to enabled multi-user on my phone using these instructions:\nhttp://www.pocketables.com/2013/03/how-to-enable-multiple-user-mode-on-cyanogenmod-10-1-and-some-other-android-4-2-2-roms.html\nThanks @jpeg729 !\n. Switching users (normally done on the lock screen, but this doesn't work on phones):\nadb shell am switch-user <user-number>\n. Since I got multi-user support enabled on my device the chance is a lot bigger this test version will work for you: http://d-h.st/elS\n. The logcat seems to be removed ...\n. I should work now, really ;-)\nhttp://d-h.st/Tib\n. Thanks for reporting back!\nI am glad it works now.\nA nice side effect is that I have multi-user support on my phone now.\nBTW, I discovered that rotating the screen 90 degrees allows me to switch users on the lock screen.\n. This issue has already been discussed: this is a function your launcher app should provide.\n. http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/text/copy-paste.html\n. Will be implemented in the next release.\n. From Android's point of view there is no difference between manually copy/paste or programmatically copy/paste.\n. There will be a new clipboard category in the next release.\n. http://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/notification/NotificationListenerService.html\n. Can be restricted in the next release (category System).\n. Did you also restart after allowing some contacts?\n. Your problem should be fixed in this version: http://d-h.st/LRk\nIf you have selected contacts for an application, you will have to unselect and select again to get it working.\nPlease note that WhatsApp caches contacts. During my tests, killing WhatsApp was not always sufficient to clear the cache. I solved this by clearing all data and setting up WhatsApp again.\n. See the wiki for information about what Android expects.\n. I will not allow this kind of information in the wiki, because i may be illegal.\nMost things are easily found on the internet, for example IMEI:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mobile_Station_Equipment_Identity\n. Follow the link to the Android TelephonyManager from here and you will find detailed information about all the telephony stuff:\nhttp://wiki.faircode.eu/index.php?title=Phone\n.

Should be fixed in this version: http://d-h.st/ysb\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#changelog\n. You can use logcat for this:\n- install the Android SDK\n- adb shell logcat | grep XPrivacy\n. It is a toggle, so IMHO it is okay as it is.\n. Checked for Facebook and Xabber and for me it is okay.\n. I appreciate the effort you have put into this.\nNevertheless I will not merge things that do not work 100%, so please finish this work and create a new pull request.\nPlease note that I have re-factored a lot recently, so you might want to revise some things.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. I don't see anything obvious that is wrong.\n.

FileNotFoundException and NoSuchFieldError for TelephonyManager shouldn't be the problem.\n. Since you have already tried five different versions, I guess you don't mind to try two more:\n1.7.23 alpha without IoBridge hook: http://d-h.st/WBJ\n1.7.23 alpha without ActivityThread hook: http://d-h.st/mYO\nI have no clear idea of the problem, but if one of these versions work, it will be easier to search further.\n. The null pointer is here:\nhttps://github.com/android/platform_frameworks_base/blob/jb-mr2-release/core/java/android/app/ActivityThread.java#L4970\n. The only way I see to debug this, is to disable hooks until we have found the guilty one.\nIf you can compile XPrivacy yourself, just comments things out here:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XPrivacy.java#L45\nToday I have rewritten this code extensively, which makes it now easier to disable groups of hooks :-)\n. Maybe Xposed is not compatible with 4.3, yet\n. I have already fixed the incompatible TelephonyManager message.\nAnd also the FileNotFoundException and NoSuchField exceptions, which are totally harmless.\nContact me by PM if you want to chat with me, so I may help you get things up and running.\n. @paavo74 privacy wise this is a good solution ;-)\n. @rndhro Good! Thanks for looking into this. If you have questions, send me a PM.\n. @rndhro try binary searching: enable one half, if it works, enable half of the rest, if it does not work: disable half of the half, etc.\n. Thanks for finding out the faulty restriction!\nCan you try again with the commit I have just done?\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/commit/4a859565b10eccb0ecb5156c4297e71d2b5a2419\n. This is already a fix :-)\n. Consequence is that you cannot restrict system properties for Android anymore, but that is not a good idea anyway.\n. It is likely that the Play store is using a non standard, non documented way to retrieve the installed applications (perhaps through GSF). Unfortunately the Play store is not open source, so it will be difficult to figure out how it works.\n. Thanks for figuring this out!\nI will add restrictions for these intents soon.\n. I will look into the accounts changed intent too.\nPlease let me know if you find more.\n. Next version will restrict addittional in the system category:\n- android.intent.action.PACKAGE_CHANGED\n- android.intent.action.PACKAGE_DATA_CLEARED\n- android.intent.action.PACKAGE_FIRST_LAUNCH\n- android.intent.action.PACKAGE_FULLY_REMOVED\n- android.intent.action.PACKAGE_NEEDS_VERIFICATION\n- android.intent.action.PACKAGE_VERIFIED\n- android.intent.action.EXTERNAL_APPLICATIONS_AVAILABLE\n- android.intent.action.EXTERNAL_APPLICATIONS_UNAVAILABLE\n. android.accounts.LOGIN_ACCOUNTS_CHANGED does not need to be restricted, since it carries no data.\n. Will be in next release.\n. Thanks for continuing to update the translation!\n. Thanks for the update\n. I cannot merge this, since the changes do not match the latest version.\n. I finally found the time to manually merge your translation update :-)\n. All GitHub actions are instant.\nYou are working on your own fork. You have two options:\n1. Add my repo as remote and merge changes into your fork\n2. Just delete your fork and fork/clone again\nYou can you all changes in the commits, but there are a lot.\nIf you use method 1, you can see what is being merged.\nAbout integration the wiki: it is a lot of work, also to maintain it (think also of translations).\nThis has been asked for a lot of times, but there are limits to my free time.\n.

This is not possible, because then there will be a problem when there are two applications installed.\nTapping on the first notification will open the correct settings.\nTapping on the second notification will open the previous settings.\nThis has been fixed by closing the first settings, result in the behavior you describe here.\nIt is the one or the other.\n. No, there is no other way, sorry.\n. It is probably because of this restriction:\n07-29 12:24:55.369 I/XPrivacy/XWifiManager(7756): get 10066/getWifiApConfiguration network=true\n. I have checked: getWifiApConfiguration is allowed to return null, so this is a bug in your ROM.\nYou can workaround it by not restricting getWifiApConfiguration in the network category.\n. Please do either a pull request or send a complete set of updated strings (everything between < resources> and < /resources>).\n. Okay, I will update the two strings.\nI cannot figure out for each translation update what should be done, because there are many of them.\n. Done :-)\n. Don't worry :-)\n. Already done manually.\n. But thanks for creating the pull request.\n. This will be fixed in the next release.\nThanks for reporting.\n. This will be fixed in the next release.\nThanks for reporting!\n. Duplicate of #397\n. Believe me if I say I exercise upgrading a lot of times and I have never ever lost my settings.\nDo you follow the upgrade instructions?\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#upgrading\nImport cannot be made faster, the Android package manager is not very fast and it is just a lot of detailed info.\nProblems with import:\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=43892381&postcount=1703\n. I see no way how restriction settings can get lost.\nThese are stored as shared preferences.\nIf you upgrade the application as documented, then you will not lose the settings, like with any other application.\n. Thanks for perfection ;-)\n. With pleasure merged!\n. Please provide me with a logcat.\n. Probably this:\nE/AndroidRuntime( 7169): java.lang.RuntimeException: An error occured while executing doInBackground()\nE/AndroidRuntime( 7169):    at android.os.AsyncTask$3.done(AsyncTask.java:299)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 7169):    at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask$Sync.innerSetException(FutureTask.java:273)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 7169):    at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.setException(FutureTask.java:124)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 7169):    at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask$Sync.innerRun(FutureTask.java:307)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 7169):    at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:137)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 7169):    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1076)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 7169):    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:569)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 7169):    at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:856)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 7169): Caused by: java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: Invalid index 1, size is 0\nE/AndroidRuntime( 7169):    at java.util.ArrayList.throwIndexOutOfBoundsException(ArrayList.java:251)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 7169):    at java.util.ArrayList.get(ArrayList.java:304)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 7169):    at android.widget.ArrayAdapter.getItem(ArrayAdapter.java:337)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 7169):    at biz.bokhorst.xprivacy.ActivityMain$AppListAdapter$HolderTask.doInBackground(ActivityMain.java:1723)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 7169):    at android.os.AsyncTask$2.call(AsyncTask.java:287)\nE/AndroidRuntime( 7169):    at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask$Sync.innerRun(FutureTask.java:305)\n. This version has a more structural fix, also for potentially the same problem in the app details view:\nhttp://d-h.st/K5w\n. Nothing at all, just the fix for the crash.\n. \"Here's a little extra on the lost app checkmarks. In your \"hotfix\" build, the new Notifications category seems to have been added but, of course, unrestricted by default. However, that category seems to be required for an app to show the blue checkmark now.\": I guess you mean in the application list. Android doesn't have tri-state check boxes, so the third state is displayed as disabled.\n\"Moreover, it appears that selecting the All function from the menu filters all available functions, whether used by the app or not (though this may be by design, I have not been following that closely...).\". This is by design. An updated app can have the permission.\n\"An upshot though, is that the menu now shows the selection items for filtering by Account and by Contact, even if the app doesn't use those permissions. Does this sound correct?\". These menu's are enabled as soon as the corresponding restriction is enabled.\n. Try disabling the two filters in the settings.\n. They are set by default, since most users want that.\n. Thanks again for the update!\n. Thanks for the update.\nJust too late for the release, but it will be in the next release.\n. Please use English\n. I guess you mean the category 'Boot' in English.\nThis category has been removed, because XPrivacy is not a startup manager and it is not needed to prevent application startups to protect your privacy.\n. Thanks for the translation.\nCan you please translate this into English:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/pull/407\n(in the issue please)\n. Yes, I meant #406.\nThe question has already been translated and I have already answered.\nThanks for your support!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. I have just made this ;-)\nIt will be in the next release.\n. I have already looked at the documentation you references, but there is nothing useful in it.\n. Not really.\nListView and ExpandableListView do not seems to have support for keyboard input, other than up/down navigation.\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ListView.html\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ExpandableListView.html\nIf Android has provisions for keyboard, I will use them, but I am not willing to make custom code for this.\n. My previous comment is still valid.\n. Thanks again for the update!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. This option will be available in pro enabler version 1.10 (just uploaded).\n. There is no expert mode anymore in the recent version, so I am not sure what you mean.\n. The template is meant for a batch of applications (all menu) or for newly installed applications.\nI see no use for a template for the function exceptions. This is customization that should be done for individual applications.\n. Internet and storage usage cannot be monitored, see the description\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#description\n. XPrivacy can identify that an app is requesting internet permission and revoke that permission on the fly, but XPrivacy cannot monitor if the internet is actually being used. Only the Linux kernel could do that, but this is not the level XPrivacy is working.\n. XPrivacy revokes internet access when restricted when an application starts.\nIt cannot monitor internet access thereafter (monitor = usage data).\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Start with installing the latest beta version, since a lot of things have been improved. It is a release candidate for the next stable version.\n. @LazyZhu can you give me a reference to serial# being 12 digits?\n. MAC: that is the format of a MAC address, but not every combination is a valid one.\n. IMEI: not every combination of digits (even with the right check digit) is a valid one.\n. Yes, to prevent problems with applications that check the data.\nFrom experience I know that the Facebook app does check the data it gets from Android.\n. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMEI#Structure_of_the_IMEI_and_IMEISV_.28IMEI_Software_Version.29\n. Did you see that there are two standards for IMEI.\nMaybe your devices uses different standards.\n. Android ID:\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.Secure.html#ANDROID_ID\n. ICC ID:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICCID#ICCID\n. Subscriber ID:\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/TelephonyManager.html#getSubscriberId()\nIMSI:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_mobile_subscriber_identity\n. So far implemented:\n- Android ID\n- GSF ID\n- Location\n- Mac address\n- Serial#\nMore complicated are:\n- IMEI\n- Phone number\n- MCC\n- MNC\n- ICCID\n- Subscriber ID (IMSI for GSM phones)\n. There is no need to randomize the ICCID and subscriber ID (IMSI), since the default is to return an empty value.\n. I am not sure if randomization of the phone number, MCC and MNC is useful.\n. Next release will allow randomization of all values, except for MCC, MNC, ICCID and subscriber ID.\nMCC and MNC are difficult to randomize, there are over 1100 valid MCC+MNC, but there is not a system in it that can used to randomize.\nIt is not important to randomize the ICCID and subscriber ID, since the default is to return an empty value.\nPhone number is randomized as a 10 digit number with a leading zero.\n. As said in the XDA thread I have first to find a way to do this without delaying checking for restrictions.\nIn any case I see no obvious solution for this.\nNote that querying restrictions happens a lot and that an extra check can have a serious effect on performance.\n. I am closing this issue now, but if I think of a way to implement this without impacting performance I will implement it.\n. I have looked into this, but the CheckedTextView cannot be styled.\nI have tried with a separate TextView before the CheckedTextView, but then we lose precious screen space, because the space below the uid will not be used.\nSo, we have to make choices here and I will leave it like it is.\n. This will be part of the next release.\n- biz.bokhorst.xprivacy.action.IMPORT\n- biz.bokhorst.xprivacy.action.EXPORT\nBoth export/import can send the file name in an extra string with the name \"FileName\".\nThe default will be used if this extra is missing.\nThe result intent always contains the file name as extra with the name \"FileName\".\n. Done by adding hints to the input fields.\nWill be in next release.\n. Thanks for the update.\nMaybe it is an idea to create an issue for discussion about the translation.\n. http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=44173517&postcount=2136\n. http://pastebin.com/6CfnGmDR\n.

I can reproduce the problem, but until so far I have no clue what is causing it.\n. Finally found it, it will be fixed in the next release (soon).\n. I am not going to change the theme/icons again.\nIt will make somebody happy and somebody else unhappy.\n. @daibaron dangerous apps are already highlighted by a background color.\n. @daibaron I am not having the idea I was rude and I didn't intent any rudeness. I have to take into account the opinion of many people and my own limitations (time, motivation), that is all.\n. Did you go back to a previous version of XPrivacy without rebooting?\n. I have found the cause, it will be fixed in the next release (soon).\n. 1.7.30 should solve this problem.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the update, again.\n. Thanks for the update, again.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. I am sorry this happened to you. I always keep previous version in mind and there is code the upgrade things.\nI would like to solve this problem to prevent other users run into the same problem, but unfortunately there is too little information I can work with. Maybe you can help with this:\n- Which XPrivacy version did you have installed before?\n- Did you subscribe as beta user?\n- Are you willing to try to install the latest XPrivacy version? (with no previous settings)\n. Please reopen, when providing a log file.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Which version XPrivacy did you use?\n. I guess you are not using the beta version from the Play store, which fixes this problem.\nSee here how to get the beta version:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#changelog\n. Thanks again!\n. Thanks for the update.\n. In the latest beta's and the just released new stable version both accounts and contacts are exported, but can only be imported on the same device. There is no safe way to export accounts and contacts in such a way that they can be imported on another device.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. This is not where import/export is meant for.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. I don't see why this is privacy sensitive data.\n. Okay, I will add these as dangerous functions:\ngetNetworkType: NETWORK_TYPE_UNKNOWN\ngetPhoneType: PHONE_TYPE_GSM\n(unless you have a better idea)\n. Yes, it will be dangerous functions (so default off).\n. You can test it: http://d-h.st/HoU\nWhich app is shown in the screen shot above?\n. Thanks for the link to the app.\nYes, I didn't mark it as dangerous.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Thanks for the update\n. Please provide a log file and reopen the ticket.\n. http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=43892381&postcount=1703\n. The log is short, so it is hard to judge if getDeviceId is hooked correctly.\nThe simplest way to check this is by looking if there is any usage data for it.\nI am also wondering if the device has telephony functions at all.\nTo be sure you can do this:\n- power down the device\n- start capturing the logcat from your computer by issuing 'adb logcat' on your computer (you need to have the Android SDK installed for this)\n- power on your device\n- not long after the boot animation starts XPrivacy log which functions are hooked\n- paste the log on pastebin or a similar service and add the link to it in this ticket and I will check it\n. Sorry, I cannot read Chinese and I get all kind of popups on the site.\nPlease paste the log om pastebin.\n.

Thanks for the update\n. I see no reason to add more filters. I think it will only confuse people.\n. Did you check the usage view?\nFor me this works okay.\n. Did you flash the Xposed fix?\n. Checking means restric (see also the title).\nThe wiki is the best place to check settings for an application.\nYou can go there directly by pressing the info icon in the app details view.\n. Thanks for the update\n. This means Android 4.3 is slower or maybe that there is less memory available now.\nSeen from the perspective of XPrivacy little can be done to improve this.\n. Sorry, but there is a feature stop.\n. This issue was closed 10 days ago.\nThere is no separate fixed status on GitHub.\n. Thanks for the work done, but:\n- I cannot see uid's anymore when the application name is long (not everybody has a big screen)\n- I don't want to change standard Android behavior, the CheckedTextView is commonly used, and there is a good reason for that: not everybody has small fingers\nNevertheless I appreciate you have tried to improve XPrivacy.\nMost people are only 'demanding', you are doing.\n. I hope you understand why I closed the pull request.\nI hope this doesn't discourage you from doing other pull requests.\nIf you don't have a pro license yet, contact me by (XDA) PM and I will make sure you get one.\n. You can always contact me before you are going to change something.\n. I am sorry I have disappointed you, I know the feeling, since quite some contributions I did to other project were rejected too. It takes some time to learn about all the decisions that have been made in the past.\nI see a trend coming towards smaller screens for phones, so I think it is a good idea to keep supporting these (it is not all about my small screen).\n. Oh, and no need to say sorry.\n. I cannot reply to your XDA PM, since you have disabled XDA PM.\n. It is not only SIM but also network operator name.\n. Thanks for the update.\n. Double thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the update\n. Although you gave little information, no application name, no logcat, I have found a bug in handling the method addNmeaListener. It is fixed in the just released version.\n. \"Edit 2: if i kill marine traffic and set a new location in xprivacy marine traffic will goto the spoofed location for a few seconds. After that it goes to the real location.\"\nThis is typically caused if the app either uses GSF or the Wi-Fi scan results to determine the location.\nBoth can be blocked:\n- GSF: connect\n- Wi-Fi: getScanResults\nLook in the usage view what the app(s) are trying to access.\n. Facebook reports me at Christmas Island, just with location restricted and without any of the dangerous methods restricted.\n. No, I didn't restrict GSF.\nIf you cannot get a position that is probably because you have restricted the 'dangerous' methods below the location restriction.\n. Are you sure one of the providers, network, GPS, etc, are giving locations?\nXPrivacy only replaces real locations obtained.\n. @Frost58 did you flash the Xposed fix?\nGSF/Google Play is a system app, disable the filters in the settings and you can see it.\nFor restricting Google maps: see the wiki\nhttp://wiki.faircode.eu/index.php?title=XPrivacy\n. Menu -> Settings -> Clear the two filter checkbox - > Ok\n. Wi-Fi: restrict getScanResults\n. Thanks for the update\n. So I was right in the first place about the spelling of 'Licensed' in German ;-)\nOr are there local differences?\nAnyway, thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the update.\nI had three years of Arabic lessons, so I can read some words, but Arabic appeared to be quite difficult to learn.\nI came to the conclusion you have to go live in an Arabic speaking country to really learn it, so I gave up :-(\n. I don't see a benefit for the majority users for this.\n. Point me to a reliable cell info database and I will think about it.\n. Yes, I know, but as far as I know there is no reliable database to translate the CID and LAC into a location.\n. Lets put it in another way: I live in Dordrecht, the Netherlands.\nIf you can tell me the CIDs around me, I will consider to add a settings for it.\nMy best guess is that you cannot tell this, making it a useless option.\n. IMHO there is no reliable database and this feature will not benefit the majority of the users, so I will not add it.\n. You are forgetting I have to make and maintain everything. I have spent somewhere between 500-1000 hours on this project. Convincing me seems like a lot less work. And it is not a game, I intent to maintain XPrivacy as long as relevant for the benefit of everybody (and almost for free), which means I have to keep the number of features to a minimum. There is also another reason: I want to keep XPrivacy as simple as possible, so that users are not scared to use it (it is already complicated enough). It is not that I not appreciate your suggestions, on the contrary.\n. Thanks for the update as always\n. Could you please try version 1.8.6? And if that doesn't work too also version 1.8.4?\nCopy the XPrivacy remover to your SD card first\nhttp://goo.im/devs/M66B/xprivacy\n. Thanks for your detailed report!\nI would like all reports are like this.\nThere are no restriction changes between 1.8.3 and 1.8.7.\nMaybe this is the problem:\n\"Enable Android usage data 60 seconds after boot\"\nYou can try this version, where I have changed 60 seconds in 120 seconds.\nhttp://d-h.st/fDm\n. A logcat right from startup could also help.\nYou need to start adb logcat on your computer before you power up your device for this.\n. I have look into this several times and there is no easy solution.\nXPrivacy integrates very deep into Android and operates already at early boot, so the things that can be done are mostly limited.\nIdeally XPrivacy gets to know 'System ready', but this cannot be done through intents.\n. I have found a way to check if system is ready and even then there must be a delay.\nThis issue should be fixed in the just released version.\n. Interesting a null pointer exception for which I don't have an explanation:\nW/System.err( 1656):    at biz.bokhorst.xprivacy.XTelephonyManager.isRestricted(XTelephonyManager.java:181)\nW/System.err( 1656):    at biz.bokhorst.xprivacy.XTelephonyManager.isRestricted(XTelephonyManager.java:192)\nW/System.err( 1656):    at biz.bokhorst.xprivacy.XTelephonyManager.isRestricted(XTelephonyManager.java:203)\nW/System.err( 1656):    at android.telephony.TelephonyManager.getPhoneType(Native Method)\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XTelephonyManager.java#L181\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XTelephonyManager.java#L192\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XTelephonyManager.java#L203\nparam.thisObject.getClass()\nparam will not be null, thisObject is also likely not null.\nIt doesn't harm, but it isn't ideal too.\n.

Will be fixed in the next release: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/commit/a1258d7411b5c1410324bd50f338dbf79226f469\n. This is intended behavior, dangerous methods are always unchecked when checking a restriction category.\n. Thanks for the continuous updates!\n. This is by design: some apps have multiple packages, but that could change in the future, so the export file contains all of them to make the chance it can be imported in the future as big as possible (packages could be added/changed/removed).\n. Although I have now closed this issue, I appreciate your suggestions.\n. Thanks for this nice idea!\n. Thanks for the update.\n. This is by design:\n- Sending usage data is expensive\n- You can discuss about NULL being a value\nNevertheless I appreciate you are reviewing the code!\n. Thanks for the update as always.\n. Thanks for the update as always.\n. Fixed by showing question marks.\nThanks for reporting.\n. Thanks for the update as usual.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks again for the update!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Submit restrictions does upload the restrictions for an application here:\nhttp://updates.faircode.eu/xprivacy\n. I cannot judge if something is right or wrong, so please settle this with each other.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the update, unfortunately just to late for the release of today.\n. Thanks for the correction.\n. This will be corrected in the next release.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. It is correct that getConnectionInfo is referenced from two places.\nIn one place to fake offline state (internet) and in another place to hide network details (network).\n1. If you restrict one of the two (or both) getConnectionInfo will be restricted\n2. Yes\n3. No, functions are marked dangerous per category and may not be dangerous in another category, because of other restrictions in the category\n4. No, this is has nothing to do with the Xposed fix.\n. This message is a warning.\nXPrivacy does not work if XPrivacy is not enabled in Xposed.\nThe question is why XPrivacy is not staying enabled in Xposed.\nYou can best ask this question in the Xposed thread.\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1574401\n. Thanks for the update!\n. This is not a problem. It is caused because there are different Google services frameworks. It is just a warning you can ignore.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the translation!\nT\u00e9l\u00e9charger sounds nice!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. I will make this, but first has everything to be proven stable.\n. I see the problem, but I have to think about a solution (not trivial).\n. This problem will be fixed in the next version, which I will release in a few moments.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks!\n. What is the reasoning behind this?\n. Ok, but then template should be move near settings too, since it is also a setting.\n. All does apply the template to all applications.\n. The text 'All' is also used in the application details view and in the usage view menu.\n. That is okay with me.\n. Thanks for this improvement!\n. I don't see the use case for this. Either you use your own restrictions or you fetch the crowd sourced restrictions from the central server, but I don't see why you want to mix both. You can fetch the crowd sourced restrictions and submit them again after adjusting if you are not satisfied with them.\nThere is always the possibility to look what the crowd sources restrictions are by tapping the info icon.\n. Should be fixed in the just released version.\n. It is not that an Android ID is a user name or password. It is a random sequence of characters that says nothing in itself. And when it is MD5 hashed it does even say less. So, even it is possible to reverse the MD5 hash (which can be done, but is a lot of trouble), then it is most probably not useful. XPrivacy sends the Android ID to distinguish submissions. XPrivacy doesn't send any other privacy sensitive data.\n. XPrivacy never sends anything out of its own.\nOnly when you use the menu 'Submit restrictions' in the app details view.\n. Thanks @28Black that is a simple and nice solution.\n. \"As with OpenPDroid: app-level options to limit WiFi info, WiFi switching, network info, network switching, forcing online state, startup (is that what shell> start is), etc.\"\nXPrivacy can restrict all, but switching, which is not privacy related.\n\"Ability to swipe from one apps settings to another including within permissions-filtered list.\"\nPlease, create a separate issue for this.\n\"Alternative to exporting backups to cloud/email apps. IDK why, but I can't seem to simply save to local storage. Am I missing something?\"\nThe pro version can export/import settings. http://www.faircode.eu/xprivacy/\n\"A grace period to allow restoration/import of backup data before having to go online (unprotected) after flashing different ROMs.\"\nThe FAQ describes the right procedure for upgrading ROM's.\nThis is more an Xposed matter.\nA grace period for system application will be a disaster.\n\"Ability to specify unique misinformation on per app basis (such as location, IDs, etc - as with OpenPDroid).\"\nI see no use case for this. Global settings for fake data is fine. It would increase the complexity and resource usage (memory, processor) of XPrivacy.\n\"More layman's terms aka clarity about settings. For instance, when setting up false global settings for location does are apps that I check location box on denied info, or fed fake info? Is there a way for me to choose?\"\nThe main goal is to feed application fake data, there will be no choice to keep XPrivacy usage as simple as possible (it is already complicated enough).\n\"What does '%' indicate?\"\nThe percent sign is a wild card, it means any sequence of characters.\nYou are the first ever to ask this ...\n\"Can you break down things like 'Network location, Google account manager, Google Play, Google Bookmarks sync, Google Services Framework, Google Contacts sync'?\"\nWith the pro license you can fetch cloud sourced settings.\nhttp://updates.faircode.eu/xprivacy\n\"Most helpful, perhaps: a finer global template to include all the subcategories available when administering apps individually.\"\nIt is not the first time this is being asked, but a template for the function is not useful, given that this is only for tuning individual applications.\n\"A way to easily, globally switch settings off for when troubleshooting issues (such as connectivity).\"\nThis has also been asked a few times, but any new settings to be checked will delay your device.\n\"How about more accessible filter option for deciding weather to list either user or system apps or both? Sometimes I'd like to apply settings purely to the system apps. There isn't yet a convenient way to duo this.\"\nIMHO the setting is okay for most users.\n\"A way to apply the global/system (aka template) profile to apps installed prior to xprivacy.\"\nIn the near feature there will be a batch fetch for the cloud sourced restrictions.\nIf you want to discuss about any of the above requests/suggestion, please create an issue per request to keep it manageable. Please do not continue the discussion in this issue.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Why do you want to restrict the camera flashlight?\nI am also wondering how compatible this is across different ROM's.\n. Parameters appears to be documented well, so compatibility might be no problem:\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Camera.Parameters.html\n. This seems like a solid work to me.\nDid you test the result on Android 4.0+ too?\nWhy the change from ALL to ANY for Inet4Address?\nWhy no copy for ContentProvider?\nDoes everything else work?\n. \"solid work\" means \"good work\".\nI agree ANY is better than ALL and I will change it for the next release.\nI am tempted to merge your pull request, but I cannot support Gingerbread, because I have no devices anymore that run Gingerbread. It is too much trouble to switch ROM's each time to test with Gingerbread, given that the number of Gingerbread users is getting lower each day.\nXPrivacy is GPL 3 licensed, see here:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#license\nThis means that you are allowed to distribute your own version of XPrivacy, but not to sell it (especially the pro features).\n. Unfortunately unit testing is not possible. I test each change with a set of applications, some are listed in the wiki under contributing. Once a restriction is working, no further testing is needed, except for new Android versions.\nThe GPL 3 license is not the only thing there is. I am also the only copyright holder.\n. Since I cannot test with Gingerbread in a reasonable way and because the number of Gingerbread users is rapidly decreasing anyway (and I guess most XPrivacy users are not Gingerbread users), I am not going to merge this.\n. Thanks for reporting this.\nI have no devices with NFC, but since the app is open source it was easy to find out how it read NFC tags :-)\nCould you please try if this version prevents the app from reading NFC's?\nhttp://d-h.st/xRq\n. Thanks for testing and reporting back.\nI have no idea how the Automagic reads tags.\nCan you post a logcat? Maybe this helps to figure it out.\n. Did you also check if another (system) app reported usage data for NFC?\nIt could be that the app reads tags through another (system) app.\n. Did you also check if another (system) app reported usage data for NFC?\n. It should be fixed in this test release: http://d-h.st/RO7\nIf not, please reopen this issue.\n. Done\n. I will do that later.\n. Done ;-)\nBut fetches are only registered a few day now, so the number is still quite low.\n. Thanks, Mike!\n. Thanks again, Tony!\n. I don't see an obvious cause in the log file.\nAFWall+ is not responding:\nANR in dev.ukanth.ufirewall\nThe only strange thing is this:\nAttempt to read preferences file /data/data/biz.bokhorst.xprivacy/shared_prefs/biz.bokhorst.xprivacy.provider.10051.xml without permission\nIt looks like the file permissions of XPrivacy were changed somehow.\n. I think \"After fixing permissions in recovery\" is the problem.\nThere is apparently a bug in that procedure that sets the XPrivacy file permissions wrong.\nTry this as a quick fix:\nadb shell\nsu\ncd /data/data/biz.bokhorst.xprivacy\nchmod -R 644 *\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Browser user agent can maybe be done with XPrivacy, but it will be browser/version dependent and therefore appear to be unmaintainable.\nI don't see why device/manufacturer is privacy sensitive information.\nUser (account) can already be restricted.\n. I will see what I can find out about the browser user agent.\n. An application that uses a WebView can set the browser user agent like this:\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebSettings.html#setUserAgentString(java.lang.String)\n. Next release will allow to restrict the browser user agent string using the View category.\nNote that it doesn't work for the stock browser.\n. There were some problems with plurals in some languages, therefore the structure of some strings has been changed.\nCould you please revise this update?\n. Thanks for the update!\n. The problem with this is it will make your device slower, because of the extra checks for settings that has to be done. Restrictions/settings are queried already a lot of times, since XPrivacy hooks into a lot of critical Android parts.\n. I will see what I can do, but this doesn't have high priority.\n. The XPrivacy core (version 1.9.11) already has app specific settings and true randomization (not on boot).\nTony is working on the app specific settings UI, so have patience.\n. Thanks.\nIt took some time because I am not at home and because both the GitHub app and Octodroid don't have a function to merge requests (which is a kind of stupid).\n. There were some problems with plurals in some languages, therefore the structure of some strings has been changed.\nCould you please revise this update?\n. Thanks, Tony!\n. I cannot merge this pull request because it conflicts with other changes.\nCould you please look into it again?\n. There could be a little delay updating the restrictions settings (check boxes), but Android (uid=1000) is handled exactly the same as any other application, so you should see the same behavior for any other app too. I don't know if you reported this same issue before, but I already looked into it, but I cannot reproduce this.\n. Thanks for the update.\n. Thanks for the loyal updates!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the trouble!\n. Thanks again for the update!\n. Thanks for the update.\n. The next release will have an option to set the IP address.\n. Thanks for the update!\nYou can see here how the plurals work:\nhttp://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/string-resource.html#Plurals\n. You are very welcome!\n. Device administration should be added too to prevent unauthorized uninstalling of XPrivacy.\nhttp://developer.android.com/guide/topics/admin/device-admin.html\n. There is no way to use the Android PIN:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/10106837/use-system-pin-dialog-in-android-application\nI don't want to write a custom PIN protection for XPrivacy, so unfortunately I will set this issue to 'won't fix'.\n. I still don't see why the date is privacy sensitive (or how often you use an application).\nI guess if we go this way, we end up restricting Android completely.\n. Because I don't want to restrict the date, since IMHO it is not personal identifiable data.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Could you please change the pull request to without the flashlight restriction?\n. For some reason the pull request cannot be merged.\nCould you please figure out why?\nMaybe it is easier to create a new branch/fork to fix this.\n. Thanks for the update!\nYou will have to discuss with the other translators who does what.\n. \"Mixed\" categories are shown by a disabled check box.\nI agree this isn't a great solution, but it has the advantage that there is no risk somebody accidentally disables/enables everything a loses the exceptions.\n. Custom stuff is mostly resulting in problems in future release, so I rather don't want to add custom stuff.\nI don't want to change the app details view, because I am sure it will make at least some people unhappy.\nMoreover, the situation in the details view is different, because the categories can be drilled down and the drilled down check boxes are exceptions to the category check box.\n. @tonymanou lets talk about a solution on GTalk\n. Try beta version 1.9.8\n. @danielmmmm the color is not ideal, since the check box mark/square is blue now for my green theme. Not a big deal, but just not perfect.\nThe application details view works differently, the child check boxes are exceptions to the main check box.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. I have just removed most statistics and simplified the display of the application list to reduce server load: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/commit/1bf6d09eb31381f9171b1142f4dae6595fb1e8b0\nThe number of records has grown to about 1,5 million, which impact the performance of the server if not carefully managed. For me response times for fetching restrictions is more important than statistics. With the new server, adding a database index and removing the statistics display, the response time for fetching restrictions has decreased from seconds to tenths of seconds. Fetching restrictions for 100 application does now take 10's of seconds and not anymore minutes.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks a lot Tony!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the updated translation!\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Restricting individual files is possible but I rather prefer not to, since it has proven to give compatibility and performance problems. Is there something specific you have in mind? If I remember correct, then reading build.prop requires root and is safe by design.\n. Restricting all files on /system will in effect disable Android altogether.\nFiles need to be restricted on a case by case basis.\nThe next release allows you to restrict /system/build.prop (category identification).\n. Switching languages is a system activity not an app activity.\nIf the translation is wrong, you can improve it.\nSee contributing about how.\n. If many apps have this, it is a clear indication it is actually a system activity.\nWhat is 'normal' is not always 'right'.\n. Duplicate of \uef01#562\n. Although the idea to good, I am afraid this will only result in confusion, so I will leave it like it is now.\n. Thanks again for the update!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks again for the update!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Try disabling XPrivacy to see if XPrivacy is causing this.\n. Also make sure that there is no restriction in the way (check the usage view).\n. It is a comprimise between small and large screens, so I will not change this, sorry.\n. The font size should already be relative to the screen size.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Merged manually, due to conflicts.\nThanks for all the work, Tony!\n. @LazyZhu create an issue for new feature request to prevent they get lost here\n. @LazyZhu dangerous does not matter for the check boxes. I cannot reproduce your issue. Can you describe the exact steps to reproduce?\n. Please post a screen shot with internet drilled down for Autostarts, so we can see the function exceptions.\n. Please create an issue for this.\n. Thanks for the continuous translation updates!\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Thanks for the continuous translation updates!\n. Try to get a log file and a last kernel messages.\nhttps://github.com/M66B/cm-xtended/wiki/How-to-get-logs\n. As described in the link in my previous post.\n. Yes, but that is why you need to start logging from your computer, so we can see the last lines.\n. Android restarts because of too many errors, errors like this:\n08-27 18:55:04.663 W/dalvikvm( 4070): threadid=10: thread exiting with uncaught exception (group=0x4202c438)\n08-27 18:55:04.683 E/AndroidRuntime( 4070): FATAL EXCEPTION: Timer-0\n08-27 18:55:04.683 E/AndroidRuntime( 4070): android.view.InflateException: Binary XML file line #21: Error inflating class android.widget.LinearLayout\nwhich could be caused by out of memory.\nI doubt this has to do with XPrivacy (unless the little memory XPrivacy uses is the threshold to make this happen). Could you please try without XPrivacy?\n. I have looked into all three log files another time. I cannot find a real reason for the restart.\nI noticed another thing and that is that some providers are not restricted correctly:\njava.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.android.providers.contacts.ContactsProvider2\njava.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.android.providers.contacts.CallLogProvider\njava.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.android.providers.contacts.VoicemailContentProvider\nI will look into these, but it is not related to this issue.\nWhich ROM/version are you using?\n. I like to see another log file, but please include the timestamp of the restart this time.\nIt is hard to search for a problem in large log files if you don't know what to search for and don't know where it went wrong.\n. That explains some error messages in the logcat.\nI still think this is not directly related to XPrivacy, because there would have been a lot more complaints else.\n. Why do you think that?\nDo you have a log file?\n. https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/PrivacyProvider.java#L465\nIf there is an error here a lot of users would have complained.\n\"I like to see another log file, but please include the timestamp of the restart this time. It is hard to search for a problem in large log files if you don't know what to search for and don't know where it went wrong.\"\n. Should be fixed in the next release, thanks @tonymanou\n. Thanks for the continuous updates!\n. Thanks, Tony, you are faster than me!\n. Thanks again for the update!\n. Thanks for your support, Tony!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. \"At the moment, to set the children, you have to 'enable' the parent checkbox, and then uncheck the children\"\nThis is by design, since the child check boxes are exceptions to the parent check box.\nBefore changing anything here, we have to think this carefully through, since this is how the XPrivacy core works. The reason for this behavior is performance. If the category is not restricted (the main check box is not checked), then the function restrictions are not evaluated (child check boxes). This is also the reason the child check boxes get grayed if you disable the main check box. So, the main check box actually determines if the child check boxes have a meaning or not, not the other way around. You cannot simply say that if all child check boxes are enabled or disabled, the parent check box should be enabled or disabled (although disabling all child check boxes could disabled the parent check box and even that can lead to problems, when a method restriction is added in a later version).\n\"The tristate checkbox is not shaded to reflect this\"\nThis is also for design. The reddish restrictions are for expert users only.\n. Thanks for your support, Tony.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Will be fixed in the next release.\n. Thanks, Tony!\n. Thanks, Tony!\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Thanks again!\n. There is already a notification XPrivacy is not enabled.\n. IMHO it is not a good idea to send an intent, for the reason you have already given.\n. Maybe sending an intent that XPrivacy is running, so you can disable air plane mode is a better idea.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Will be part of next release.\n. Thanks again for the update!\n. Please provide more logging.\n. I need to see at least a dozen lines around the exception and the complete exception.\n. I have seen this message also, but I have not been able to reproduce it and to capture a log.\n. I have not been able to reproduce this, so I guess this was a Gapps problem.\n. This cannot be fixed, because enable/disable logging is a setting itself.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for reporting, I will fix it.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. This is probably a problem of Titanium Backup not keeping all the file permissions. There is nothing that can be done seen from the perspective of XPrivacy.\n. The next XPrivacy version will require 2.2, so I will remove the question altogether.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Good try, but you translated the English text into your language (which language?), which will not be appreciated by English speakers ;-)\nYou need to add a new strings.xml with the correct locale, like these:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/tree/master/res\n(folder values-[your language locale])\n. Why is this change needed?\n. Thanks for bringing this to my attention!\n. I see no reason why this is needed for XPrivacy, but maybe I am missing something.\n. Did you test this?\n. Tony is right, the total number of packages is higher than the total number of applications, because some applications are composed by multiple packages. This is not a bug.\n. XPrivacy logs in the logcat, like most other applications.\nDid you check if this problem also exists when XPrivacy is disabled?\nDid you check if this problem also exists when Xposed is disabled?\nYou can use the XPrivacy remover if needed: http://d-h.st/l9p\nWithout log it is difficult / impossible to find the problem.\n. For the logcat, see the FAQ, question #22\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#frequently-asked-questions\n. Try using Dropbox or a similar service.\n. Did you 'fix' permissions with your recovery?\n09-06 11:11:33.209 W/XPrivacy( 2227): Attempt to read preferences file ...\nThis is a sign of out of memory:\n09-06 11:13:30.809 W/XPrivacy/XTelephonyManager(  706): cursor is null\nI don't think this is caused by a bug in XPrivacy.\nTry clearing the data of XPrivacy and watch your memory usage.\n. Yes 'fixing' the permissions is most probably the problem.\nTry to clear XPrivacy data.\n. I will add some code to the next release to auto fix this permissions (I have changed the title of this issue accordingly).\n. Yes.\n. You can also try to change the permissions manually.\n. Export/import will not work, since XPrivacy cannot read the restrictions.\nTry:\nadb shell\nsu\nchmod 664 /data/data/biz.bokhorst.xprivacy/shared_prefs/*\n. Try to create a log from the boot loop from your PC, post a link here with the exact time of reboot and I will take another look.\n. Try to create a log from the boot loop from your PC, post a link here with the exact time of reboot and I will take another look.\n. This seems to be the problem:\nE/XPrivacy/XIoBridge(  550): java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Attempt to launch content provider before system ready\nBut this should not occur with recent version of XPrivacy.\nWhich XPrivacy version are you using?\n. Can you try if this version fixes the problem: http://d-h.st/ABU\n. This version assumes system ready after 5 minutes: http://d-h.st/tIY\nPlease let me know if your device is still running after 10 minutes.\n. Okay, another try: http://d-h.st/yFw\n. Then we are on the wrong way.\nPlease make another log and post the last 200 lines before the reboot.\n. The problem seems to be this:\n09-09 17:26:39.629 W/XPrivacy/XTelephonyManager(  796): cursor is null\n09-09 17:26:39.629 E/ActivityThread(  796): Failed to find provider info for biz.bokhorst.xprivacy.provider\nThe problem occurs a few times, which probably resulted in the reboot.\nThe XPrivacy provider is used to share XPrivacy settings and to register usage data.\nFor some reason Android cannot find it (anymore). No idea why. This could be a bug in your ROM.\n. There is no Android API for that.\n. Please let me know if the custom ROM solves the problem.\n. @smiledexter please provide a log\n. @smiledexter I see no critical errors in the log you have provided. XPrivacy is not 100% compatible with your ROM, but that is not a critical problem:\n9-14 00:35:58.967 E/XPrivacy(7403): de.robv.android.xposed.XposedHelpers$ClassNotFoundError: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.android.providers.contacts.ContactsProvider2\nAlso, some serious bugs have been fixed in version 1.9.21, so please try again with this version. Export your settings first and clear data after installing version 1.9.21. Then reboot and see if everything is okay and after that import the exported settings. Contact me through XDA PM if you don't have the pro version yet.\n. @smiledexter try to uninstall XPrivacy, reboot, install version 1.9.21, do not apply restrictions yet, reboot.\n. It could be that a fix for something else has caused the problem. I already compared source code, but couldn't find the cause. Also the provide logcats didn't show a cause. I would like to solve the problem, but I first need to know what the problem is. This seems to be the only remaining problem in the latest versions. For almost everbody else XPrivacy seems to work okay.\n. @smiledexter try to uninstall XPrivacy, reboot, install version 1.9.21, do not apply restrictions yet, reboot.\n. All the errors seems not related to XPrivacy.\nThe log files are large, so it is difficult to search for something.\nThere are no critical XPrivacy errors reported.\nThe log file with time is nice, but it would be better to know the time where it went wrong.\n. I don't know.\n. Not every fatal error is fatal.\nYou can check if the error is there too when XPrivacy is not enabed.\n. Also make sure not one of the restrictions is causing this.\n. That is pretty fatal, but that is more an Android then an XPrivacy problem.\nMy best guess your ROM is buggy.\nMaybe it is time to try another ROM, like CyanogenMod.\n. I am not angry, I like to find this issue too.\nWhat you are doing is good: try each XPrivacy version and find which version caused the problem.\nTry each version without any restrictions, to make sure the restrictions are not the cause.\nSo, uninstall XPrivacy, reboot, install next higher version, reboot.\n. My best guess: your device has not enough resources to process loading of XPrivacy (memory, CPU) or maybe there is a bug in Xposed or in your ROM. In any case, seen from XPrivacy there is little I can do if the XPrivacy software (class) is not loaded correctly.\nMaybe there is some more info the the log file of Xposed.\nIt should be in the folder /data/xposed\n. XPrivacy will log any warning and error, even if logging is disabled, so that won't bring any news.\n. Thanks for the new translation!\nSend me a XDA PM with your full  name and e-mail address if you are interested in a Pro license.\n. Thanks for the translation update!\nCould you please create an issue for the E-mail text, so that I don't forget it?\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. I have restored the popup for the pro enabler, since the pro features may not be enabled instantly (depends on Play store / internet connection). https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/commit/a9b089aa9ee6e3723a8fd5e9450c7e3ce9e97bc8\n. Why closed?\nMy intention was to implement this.\n. To be clear, I will look at #637 too.\n(I know it is not completely duplicate).\nBut this will be after my travelling.\n. Filter on changed permissions is not reliable possible, since quite some restrictions do not require permissions.\nNotifying updates / reviewing XPrivacy settings is a core feature of XPrivacy, so I will not add an option to disable this.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Duplicate of #635\n. You can submit your restrictions to the central server, isn't that good enough?\nhttp://updates.faircode.eu/xprivacy\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Using the shared preferences for the Xposed library has proven to give problems, because the class cannot be loaded sometimes. This is why XPrivacy has its own class to load shared preferences. It is the Xposed class, patched with all the changes from Android 4.3.\nIn the latest version I added coded to fix permissions from Zygote, but that is giving problems on some devices/ROM's (wrong permissions). I don't know why yet.\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/PrivacyProvider.java#L547\n. Xposed uses the same method to set permissions:\nhttps://github.com/rovo89/XposedBridge/blob/master/src/de/robv/android/xposed/XSharedPreferences.java#L46\n. This may have to do with SELinux.\n. Thanks for the continuous updates!\n. Thanks, Tony!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the continuous updates!\n. Thanks for your suggestions.\n1. The layout will be very ugly with the change. Can't the text be changed to something shorter?\n2. You can see if you have a pro license in the about dialog. The pro enabler results in 'Pro version enabled' popups.\n. I you are looking for root on your phone, take a look on the XDA forums.\nIt is impossible for me to know how to root each and every phone model.\n. XPrivacy doesn't have superuser permissions, only Xposed does have super user permissions.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. IMHO it is a little but rude just to merge a pull request and say nothing.\nI really appreciate the translation updates.\nIt represents an effort too.\n.

That is a choice:\n- randomize on boot does what it says: one time randomize when starting your device\n- checking the box before some of the settings: randomize on use, meaning randomize each time the value is requested\n. Sorry, I will not change the way it works.\n. \"XPrivacy is not made to fix faulty hardware.\"\n\"XPrivacy tries to let the data appear as real as possible to applications.\"\n\"Because the variations in the real data are applied to the fake data.\"\n\"XPrivacy is not made to fix faulty hardware and/or to save battery.\"\n. \"how does that work when I enter a location manually?\"\nThe set position is slightly varied (randomized) using the reported accuracy of the real position.\nThis is how it is done exactly:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/PrivacyManager.java#L844\n. Sorry for my bad mood, but at times people ask so much of XPrivacy I get a little bit tired of it, especially when I have a bad day. It is easy to ask for something, but mostly more difficult to implement something, especially if there is already a significant user base. The slightest change can cause instability for user/applications.\n. If you like we can chat now and then.\nPlease contact me through this form if you are interested: http://forum.faircode.eu/contact/\n. @Cerberus-tm thanks for your opinion!\nActually that is what I do mostly now, look at the open issues: most are labelled 'lowprio', but maybe I should be more explicit about this. Nevertheless some people simply doesn't want to here 'no' and keep asking for the same thing over and over again. Also I have to make some decisions on my own in my role as developer. For example at least some people didn't like I changed the way applications were filtered by type, but the code and the UI got a lot simpler after the change, which is important for support in the long run. This is difficult to explain to non-developers.\nAgain, thanks for your 'input' ;-)\n. Check your template in the main menu,\n. All applies the template.\n. That is not the idea of the template and it wouldn't be consistent.\nI will change the title to clarify things,\n. This will be improved in the next release.\n. Do you have this issue in the latest version too?\nI cannot reproduce it.\n. Does this answer your questions?\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=45459088&postcount=3367\n. Could somebody please test if this version fixes the problem: http://d-h.st/knD\nYou might need to randomization again.\nIf it doesn't fix the issue, please describe in detail how I can reproduce this problem.\n. Thanks for testing and reporting back!\n. Clear the template (main menu) and you will have this feature.\n. I don't think it is useful to translate each and every possible (network) exception into another message.\nThere is also the issue of translation in other languages.\n. // 1 m ~ 0,000009 degrees = 9e-6\n            location.setLatitude(Float.parseFloat(sLat) + (Math.random() * 2.0 - 1.0) * location.getAccuracy() * 9e-6);\n            location.setLongitude(Float.parseFloat(sLon) + (Math.random() * 2.0 - 1.0) * location.getAccuracy() * 9e-6);\nThe location is randomized for the accuracy in meters of the original location.\nI guess you didn't see the end of the line on GitHub.\n. Thanks for the big update!\n. Thanks for the update\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Very hot ;-)\nThanks for the update!\n. Thanks, Tony!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Duplicate of #669\n. Although it seems like that, XPrivacy is not based on Android permissions.\n1) Which data do you exactly want to restrict?\n2+3+4+5) This is not within the scope of XPrivacy (restrict privacy sensitive data)\nIn general, tell me which privacy sensitive data cannot be restricted by XPrivacy and I will add a new restriction.\n. https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ25\n. This is probably a side effect of another restriction, but FAQ25 still applies.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for this addition!\n. Yes, this is better.\n. Nice idea, thanks!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the translation update!\nIt will be part of the next stable release.\n. I didn't want to add a new dialog, but there will be a popup showing the exported file name in the next release.\n. I have no idea why this isn't working. Up navigation is present as documented here:\nhttp://developer.android.com/training/implementing-navigation/ancestral.html\n. The back button should close the activity.\nThe up navigation works for me, maybe your ROM doesn't support this.\n. Which version of XPrivacy?\n. Please let me know if it works now and if there are no side effect as a result of the changes.\n. Correct, read here why:\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=45707497&postcount=3685\nThis is the commit: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/commit/76c6113a74ece064f3406a0de2385a98caeeeca7\n. Test version: http://d-h.st/i4j\n. I didn't want to add a new filter, so I have changed the behavior of the existing restrictions filter.\nThere is however a disadvantage: XPrivacy will always execute an extra filter if 'Filter on restrictions' is not selected.\n. Thanks for the update!\nIt will be part of the next stable release.\n. Merging with #616\n. Please note that due to limitations in Android it is not possible to allow applications in a few cases.\nHowever, in general this should work okay.\n. Thanks for the update\n. Thanks for the (small) update, it will be part of the next (stable) release.\n. Merging into #616 \n. More information about valid IMSI's:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_mobile_subscriber_identity\n. I will add randomization as \"001xxxxxxxxxxxx\" (15 digits).\n001 = Test Network, see here:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_country_code\n. Thanks for the update, it will be part of the next (stable) release.\n. Thanks for the update, it will be part of the next (stable) release.\n. This will take valuable screen space\n. Resizing the application icon to the line height of the usage view will make it unrecognizable.\nDid you know you can go to the usage view from the application details view and see the usage for only that application?\n. @sioban: filter by app is possible if you display the usage data from the app details view.\n. Isn't this the same as investigated in detail in #627 ?\nMy conclusion: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/issues/627#issuecomment-24523712\n. No errors in Xposed log.\n. ANR is also an indication of low resources.\n. The logcat has no mention of XPrivacy at all.\nMy conclusion stays the same: this is not an XPrivacy problem.\nMy best guess your device has not enough resources to run everything including XPrivacy.\n. Also, please note @28Black solved this problem by installing another ROM.\nSo try that.\n. https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#compatibility\n. Could you please try if this version fixed the problem: http://d-h.st/Ts8\n. You're welcome.\nTry this version, which also seems to fix the Note 3 uninstall freeze: http://d-h.st/QGy\n. Did you already test?\nThe next beta release waits on feedback on this issue.\n. There is a small performance impact when filtering on permissions and drilling down categories.\nI have minimized the impact by caching the filtered functions.\n. I will not implement this, since it will be too much dependent on the ROM version/variant, sorry.\n. Applications register to C2DM/GCM to get messages. If the token is randomized each time you'll miss or get wrong messages. You'll have to make the choice to use C2DM/GCM or not (you can restrict C2DM/GCM with XPrivacy).\n. See the FAQ, question 28\n. If I understand you correctly: yes.\n. It looks like this is not an XPrivacy problem:\nE/AndroidRuntime( 8202): *** FATAL EXCEPTION IN SYSTEM PROCESS: main\nE/AndroidRuntime( 8202): java.lang.SecurityException: 8202 does not have permission:android.permission.CLEAR_APP_USER_DATA to clear datafor process:com.zst.xposed.halo.floatingwindow\nHowever, it could be cause by restricting Google Services Framework (Google Play Services) or maybe because of Greenify, which you seem to have running too.\nXPrivacy doesn't revoke permissions, so it cannot be the direct cause of the problem.\n. Did you try to boot without any restriction?\n(enable flight mode; clear XPrivacy data and reboot)\nXPrivacy writes into the logcat.\nI like to see a logcat of the exception.\n. I guess you mean randomize at boot.\nIt will probably take some time to process all settings for all applications.\nI will change this issue to do this in a background task.\n. Could you please try if the ANR is fixed with this version: http://d-h.st/Ts8\n. Please create a new issue for this, but be sure to provide a logcat (don't forget to enable XPrivacy logging in the options).\nThere is really no reason why you cannot import an export file. The format and process hasn't changed for some time. The only thing I can image is that the import contains restrictions that causes this.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Which filename do you mean and why does it lead to corruption?\n. This is 'normal' file system corruption and is not caused by non unique filenames of XPrivacy (all files have by definition unique names). This is likely caused by a crash or unplanned shutdown of your device.\n. Test version: http://d-h.st/i4j\n. Storing the license file in data would mean it would get wiped when uninstalling XPrivacy or when wiping data, so IMHO this is not a good idea.\nSee also issue #703\n. This is outside the scope of XPrivacy.\nWakelocks have nothing to do with privacy sensitive data.\n. Test version: http://d-h.st/i4j\n. I see no added value in clearing the usage log. It could even be a disadvantage, since you may erase usage data for methods that are hardly used by an application. The usage log is sorted descending on time, so it is easy to see which usages were the latest.\n. XPrivacy doesn't keep track of what you have submitted or changed, so this is not possible.\nIt is no problem to submit restrictions multiple times, they will count as one vote.\n. Fetching means replacing the restrictions (if any) by the restrictions voted for by others.\nI don't see how this can be interpreted another way.\n. I think a lot of users would be unhappy if the interface was disabled, so I have chosen not to.\n. I see no way to implement this without sacrificing performance.\n. The activity log shows the last usage, so this is normal.\nSome things are used a lot (sometimes dozens of times a second), so it is not possible to show individual usages.\n. Thanks for the update!\n(Yes, I am back ...)\n. I will see if I can add a setting to restrict the command(s) you enter, else I am afraid there will be endless requests to restrict specific commands.\n. I didn't look at the log files, but reading the log above I don't think this is directly caused by XPrivacy, but by lack of memory. XPrivacy doesn't use much memory, but it could be the threshold causing this.\n. Please provide a logcat with XPrivacy logging enabled.\n. Please provide a logcat with XPrivacy logging enabled.\n. Please reopen this issue when providing a logcat.\n. See the FAQ, question 14.\n. Unfortunately XPrivacy debug logging was not enabled ...\n. I will look into this next weekend.\n. I have scanned to the pretty verbose logcat and only found that the camera is low on a special memory type (which XPrivacy doesn't use) and runs out of buffers once. Everything else seems pretty normal. There are a lot of calls to XPrivacy, which could accumulate to some lag, but there is nothing that can be done to improve that. XPrivacy already has caching a client and server side and needs to read settings to do its work.\n. @adrianocel can you please try if this version fixes the lag: http://d-h.st/57v\n. It was worth a try.\n. You can read here how to disable restrictions to pinpoint the restriction that is causing this:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/issues/1751#issuecomment-47424444\n. The next version will allow dangerous categories in templates\n. Which Android version are you using?\n. This is actually an important feature, else applications can get your privacy sensitive data on first run. There is a notification after installing each application to remind you about this. From the notification you can directly clear all restrictions. Actually the template set from the main menu is applied, so you can clear (part of) the template to disable this feature.\n. This is already possible, restrict contacts for the apllication and use the menu in the application details view to allow the contacts you want to be available to the application.\n. Could you please provide logcats and tell me what the author of the toggle and @rovo89 exactly said about this?\n. I cannot determine using the logcat you have sent me what the cause is.\nThe only real problem I see is that cLock is broadcasting before the system is ready.\n. I am closing this issue, because the toggle is not officially supported.\n. This is not possible, see the FAQ why.\n. I guess this is caused by too strict restrictions.\nClear XPrivacy data as explained in the FAQ and try again please.\n. I will try to help you when I am back home, but I need a more complete logcat. Enable XPrivacy logging and capture a log from your PC until the phone reboots (see the FAQ for how to).\nNobody else of 1000's of users has reported this problem, so this has not a very high priority for me (but more than feature requests).\n. Removed lowprio label\n. Does the Note 3 has SELinux enabled?\n. Could someone please capture a complete logcat from device startup until the problem occurs. This needs to be done from a PC using adb. Run the command 'adb logcat' before starting up the device.\nI am asking this, because I want to make sure there are no other hidden problems.\n. Please enable XPrivacy logging too.\n. Thanks, JP.\nI cannot download the zip file, so could you please link it from the issue?\nKind regards, Marcel\nyank555-lu notifications@github.com schreef:\n\nOK, here you go.\nI've made 2 runs, because during the boot process at some point the adb\nlogcat stops, and I may have taken me a few seconds to see that.\n2nd run id complete, and I let it go ahead until after the device came\nback up after the hot reboot.\nHope this helps you.

Could someone please post the output of\n\n\uef01ls -Ral /data/data/biz.bbokhorst.xprivacy\n. Could someone please try if this version still crashes the device: http://d-h.st/gXT\nNote that this is not a real solution.\nI like to see a logcat with XPrivacy logging enabled at the moment an application is uninstalled.\nPlease keep the logcat as small as possible.\n. I have looked to the provided logcats extensively, but I cannot relate the problem to XPrivacy.\nFor example this seems to have nothing to do with XPrivacy.\nE/DatabaseUtils( 852): java.lang.SecurityException: Permission Denial: get/set setting for user asks to run as user -2 but is calling from user 0; this requires android.permission.INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS_FULL\nThis could be caused by using an outdated root method.\nAlso the reports are not consistent, some say the phone stops working and some say the phone reboots.\nI found a reboot in one of the provided logcats, but the cause was the watchdog killing the system process.\nPlease provide an accurate as possible problem description.\nPlease provide a short as possible logcat while the problem occurs (don't forget to enable XPrivacy logging)\nPlease make sure you are using a recent root version (the latest SuperSU seems to be okay for the Note III).\n. Please try again: http://d-h.st/Ts8\n. @klau1 thanks for the clarification.\nDid you also try the test version above?\n. You should be able to install the test version over the latest stable version, unless you already installed a test version today. In that case export the settings, uninstall the new test version and import the settings.\n. @klau1 please provide a logcat from the moment you uninstall an application with the latest test version (but do not include the loglines of the restart).\n. Just start the log just before you are going to remove an application and stop the log when your device restarts.\n. Since I have no idea what is causing this issue, include as much as possible detail in the logcat,\n. Please capture the log again, but enable XPrivacy logging in the settings first.\n. Interesting, but it is not likely that enabling logging solves this problem.\n. @klau1 thanks for the logcat with XPrivacy logging enabled.\nIs this with the latest test version?\nI am asking, because I don't see the logging I have added appearing in the logcat.\nThis could be because you didn't install the latest test version or because package removed within XPrivacy wasn't executed (if so, then I have been searching in the wrong place).\n. I am not sure, because I do not always increase version numbers for test releases.\nThe latest test version is linked above.\n. @klau1 could you please install this version: http://d-h.st/578\nand capture a new logcat?\nI want to be sure I am looking at the right things.\n. These are the changes so far: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\n. This is a new test version: http://d-h.st/QGy\nPlease let me know if it fixes this problem or not.\n. @klau1  If it works, then I don't need a logcat anymore. Thanks for all the tests and logcats!\n. Several people confirmed this issue has been solved in the test release.\nI will close this issue.\nThere will be a beta release soon with the required changes,\n. @MAL0W are you running the latest XPrivacy version (beta 1.10.4) ?\n. http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/SensorManager.html\n. Test version: http://d-h.st/kil\n. Isn't there already an open feature request for this?\n. The next version will allow dangerous categories in templates\n. This is not possible, see the FAQ why.\n. Duplicate of \uef01#723\n. There are no right restrictions.\nThe most restrictive restrictions are not necessarily right too.\nI don't see how adding commenting would solve this issue.\nMore than one person could say his/her restrictions are right.\nSo IMHO it is not worth to add commenting (it is a lot of work).\nI know the voting system isn't perfect, but I don't know anything better.\nThe place to document application specific things is the wiki.\n. Still, that is what the wiki is for.\n. This cannot be changed unfortunately, since XPrivacy is based on uids.\n. This probably means Xposed is not working properly for some reason.\nCheck if Xposed is installed correctly and that you have the latest version.\nI am closing this issue, since this is not a problem of XPrivacy.\nIf you cannot fix it, please ask for help in either the XPrivacy or the Xposed XDA thread. I am sure somebody will try to help you.\n@Cerberus-tm thanks for helping with the issues.\n. Duplicate of #722 \nPlease check existing issues first next time.\n.

The filters are not really corrupt, but work different, see here for details: #682\nI am working on a solution to have the old behavior back and to have the option to filter on not restricted, without sacrificing screen estate.\n. 11-13 04:01:12.378 E/XPrivacy( 5922): java.lang.NumberFormatException: Invalid float: \"\"\n11-13 04:01:12.378 W/System.err( 5922): java.lang.NumberFormatException: Invalid float: \"\"\n11-13 04:01:12.378 W/System.err( 5922):     at java.lang.StringToReal.invalidReal(StringToReal.java:63)\n11-13 04:01:12.378 W/System.err( 5922):     at java.lang.StringToReal.parseFloat(StringToReal.java:289)\n11-13 04:01:12.378 W/System.err( 5922):     at java.lang.Float.parseFloat(Float.java:300)\n11-13 04:01:12.378 W/System.err( 5922):     at biz.bokhorst.xprivacy.PrivacyManager.getDefacedLocation(PrivacyManager.java:874)\n11-13 04:01:12.378 W/System.err( 5922):     at biz.bokhorst.xprivacy.XLocationManager.after(XLocationManager.java:112)\n11-13 04:01:12.378 W/System.err( 5922):     at biz.bokhorst.xprivacy.XPrivacy$1.afterHookedMethod(XPrivacy.java:220)\n11-13 04:01:12.378 W/System.err( 5922):     at de.robv.android.xposed.XposedBridge.handleHookedMethod(XposedBridge.java:494)\n11-13 04:01:12.378 W/System.err( 5922):     at android.location.LocationManager.getLastKnownLocation(Native Method)\n11-13 04:01:12.378 W/System.err( 5922):     at com.ebay.mobile.util.LocationUtil.getLastKnownLocation(LocationUtil.java:50)\n11-13 04:01:12.378 W/System.err( 5922):     at com.ebay.mobile.util.LocationUtil.sendForegroundOrBackgroundEvent(LocationUtil.java:209)\n11-13 04:01:12.378 W/System.err( 5922):     at com.ebay.mobile.service.AppForegroundService.onBind(AppForegroundService.java:71)\n11-13 04:01:12.378 W/System.err( 5922):     at android.app.ActivityThread.handleBindService(ActivityThread.java:2711)\n11-13 04:01:12.378 W/System.err( 5922):     at android.app.ActivityThread.access$1800(ActivityThread.java:159)\n11-13 04:01:12.378 W/System.err( 5922):     at android.app.ActivityThread$H.handleMessage(ActivityThread.java:1409)\n11-13 04:01:12.378 W/System.err( 5922):     at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:99)\n11-13 04:01:12.378 W/System.err( 5922):     at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:137)\n11-13 04:01:12.378 W/System.err( 5922):     at android.app.ActivityThread.main(ActivityThread.java:5414)\n11-13 04:01:12.378 W/System.err( 5922):     at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNative(Native Method)\n11-13 04:01:12.378 W/System.err( 5922):     at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:525)\n11-13 04:01:12.378 W/System.err( 5922):     at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit$MethodAndArgsCaller.run(ZygoteInit.java:1187)\n11-13 04:01:12.378 W/System.err( 5922):     at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.main(ZygoteInit.java:1003)\n11-13 04:01:12.378 W/System.err( 5922):     at de.robv.android.xposed.XposedBridge.main(XposedBridge.java:115)\n11-13 04:01:12.378 W/System.err( 5922):     at dalvik.system.NativeStart.main(Native Method)\n. Too bad that XPrivacy logging was not enabled.\nPlease enable XPrivacy logging and capture a new logcat next time this occurs, so we can see the offending value.\nIn any case the latitude or longitude is the problem.\nPlease also install the latest beta version of XPrivacy, so that the line numbers match with the version I am working on.\n. Did you use manual randomization (by pressing on the button) ? If so, take next time a look at the values generated for the latitude and longitude.\n. Looking again, I guess the problem is with an initial empty latitude/longitude and the problem is solved by pressing the randomize button, right?\n. Create an issue if you encounter a problem again with version 1.10.13+ (just released).\n. To use the original data, you'll have to remove the restrictions.\n. I don't want to add yet another setting. If you are concerned that the same MAC addresses are detected, you can use the randomize on access option (the checkbox before the MAC setting).\n. Thanks for the update!\n. \"Randomize on app start\" is incorrect, better is \"Randomize on access\", but this text will not fit on small screens (I know, because I have only a 3'' screen ...).\n\"Randomize all\": I tried to keep the number of strings to a minimum, because there are a lot of translations that needs to be updated. IMHO it is clear what happens if your press the button and no harm is done until you press OK.\n\"App settings\" could also be interpreted as XPrivacy application settings.\n. \"Does pressing the back button discard everything?\" Yes and I know this is somewhat unusual on Android and I was about to change this, but it is the only way to implement clearing app specific settings when all values are cleared.\n. Back key = cancel\n. Please be specific and include a logcat.\n. There is a distinct difference between a literal values of zeroes and a null values.\nThis is not something an application can confuse.\n. Please provide a logcat with XPrivacy logging enabled and I will look into it.\n. I cannot reproduce this issue.\nMy test: press randomize button, press ok and enter settings again: all randomized values are stored.\n. Then I don't understand what you mean.\nIf I enable randomize on access for for example the serial number, using the checkbox, the edit box after it will be disabled.\nRandomize on access means the value will be randomized each time an application requests the value.\nIt is no use to display a changing value in the settings dialog.\n. Thanks for the translation update, Tony!\n. Thanks for the update.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. For some reason this pull request has merge conflicts.\nProbably because some of the changes conflict with the existing translation.\nCould you please look into this?\nI don't speak any Chinese, so it will be very hard for me to do this.\n. Yes, I am planning to lift the Lucky Patcher limitation, please have some\npatience.\nYou don't need to buy the XPrivacy Pro enabler from the market, since the\npro license allows you to do the same, plus using the crowd sourced\nrestrictions. Moreover, contact me through this contact\nform http://forum.faircode.eu/contact/ and tell my your e-mail address\nand I will refund you the PayPal donation.\nAnyone who contributes significantly to XPrivacy (and you did by providing\na new translation and maintaining it) will get the Pro version for free.\nYou don't need to start over with the translation, just delete the local\nchanges from your local Git repo and get the latest changes like this:\ngit reset --hard\ngit pull\nClose the exiting pull request and create a new one for the new changes.\n. Thanks for the update and for fixing the pull request!\n. Input device has no useful ID's that can be used.\n. I don't know yet how to fake ID's.\n. \"An input device descriptor uniquely identifies an input device. Its value is intended to be persistent across system restarts, and should not change even if the input device is disconnected, reconnected or reconfigured at any time.\"\nI am afraid that restricting this will lead to trouble.\n. On the other hand:\n\"The input device descriptor returned by getDescriptor() should only be used when an application needs to remember settings associated with a particular input device.\"\n. I think a few dollars for the pro license is acceptable given the many,  many hours I have put into XPrivacy. It is almost for free. Moreover, this function is not absolutely required to protect your privacy.\n. I will keep the promise I made some time ago: anything that is needed to protect your privacy will be in the free version.\n. For reference: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=47519820&postcount=4356\n. Again thanks for the update!\n. Restrict shell and the leak is gone.\n. Thanks for the update!\nUnfortunately just too late for the release, but I guess there will probably soon another one with KitKat support.\n. Thanks for the translation!\n. The new string should have been added to all the translations too.\n. With all those translation that is a lot of boring work, but the strings need to be there, else I cannot export an APK without lint checking the translations (for example for missing strings). Translators will also appreciate this, since they can simply replace the English text by the text in there own language and don't have to compare the English translation to their own translation.\n. Already done: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/commit/cb2de444b961d0d2b107bbae0fcef3371e63dfda\nIf you have more of these kind of improvements: they are really appreciated.\nEnglish is not my native language, so if you see something that can be improved, please let me know.\n. Another fix: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/commit/d7ec6bb9bbc5cf37a74df96c31370d9d76d15440\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. I can reproduce it, but I don't know yet how to fix it.\nAll fixes in this area resulted in breaking something else (like up navigation) so far.\n. I will fix this somehow.\n. Could you please check if this version solves the problem and if there are no side effects: http://d-h.st/WMN\n. Thanks for reporting back.\n. @jokies are the dual instances for the same activity?\n. @jokies \nThis is normal Android behavior and should not be changed.\nYou can jump directly to the main application list and the application details view this way.\n. That can be improved by adding the application name to the title in the application details view.\n. @jokies I don't think we should exclude from recent.\n. Why android:noHistory=\"true\" ?\n. Thanks for solving #777 !\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. What about \"is dangerous, may cause problems\", although it is still long for small screens (but it will wrap around).\n. I have always used 'dangerous' in the communication, so it is better not to change that.\n. \"Applications ask me to enable wifi or gps in settings\": check the usage view what the applications are trying to do.\n. XPrivacy is not truncating or rounding the latitude or longitude, so Android is doing this somehow.\n5 decimals is more accurate then the GPS is, so I am not going to find out how this is happening.\n1 m ~ 0,000009 degrees\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Did you try to clear XPrivacy data? (see the FAQ)\n. I don't see any problem in the provided logcats, except maybe this:\nE/SELinux (  126): avc:  denied  { specifyids } for  scontext=u:r:system:s0 tcontext=u:r:system:s0 tclass=zygote\nE/SELinux (  126): avc:  denied  { specifyseinfo } for  scontext=u:r:system:s0 tcontext=u:r:system:s0 tclass=zygote\nI don't think these messages are related to XPrivacy, but to be sure I like to see a logcat with XPrivacy disabled.\n. \"I successfully used TB to return to 1.10.12 but that didn't fix the issue.\": this lets me wonder if XPrivacy is really the cause.\n. May be related to #785 \n. Could you please try the test versions provided in issue #785 ?\n.

The content provider of XPrivacy is not started according to the log, but a test version revealed that disabling the content provider solves the problem.\n. I see a lot of messages like:\nE/ActivityThread(  504): Failed to find provider info for ...\nand no providers started (like for contacts, dictionary, etc).\n. Just before the end there is also:\nI/ActivityManager( 1082): Launching preboot mode app: ProcessRecord{41d3eb08 1331:com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox:search/u0a10036}\n. googlequicksearchbox touches just one restriction:\nW/XPrivacy/XApplicationPackageManager( 1331): getRestricted system/getInstalledPackages/10036\nI will build a version with the restrictions for XApplicationPackageManager disabled.\n. @lklun I like to see a logcat with nothing installed (also not XPrivacy) (but flash Google apps).\n. No, just Google apps, so I can compare logs.\n. This is a version with XApplicationPackageManager disabled: http://d-h.st/Gcu\nTomorrow (UTC+1) I will build a version that allows you to disable restriction groups yourself.\n(I don't know how yet, but I will figure something out)\n. I have good hope this version will fix the problem: http://d-h.st/syp\nFor now there is an ugly workaround in place, I have to think about a structural solution.\n. Thanks for reporting back!\nThe cause is clear now: PA starts com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox:search before the system is finished starting.\n. @JensDoe thanks for reporting back!\n. May be related to #783 and #785 \n. @thechinaman1 could you please try if this version improves the boot time and reduces the lag: http://d-h.st/Zsa\nPlease make sure you have disabled the setting 'Android usage data'.\nThere is a new setting \"Extra usage data\", if you enable it then the problem should be there again.\n. Thanks for reporting back!\n. \"The program going crazy. Pops one, then another, then one\"\nCould you please explain in more details what happens?\n. Looking at the image, I seems you do not mean the back navigation of XPrivacy, but of Google Maps (or a related product). If this is the case, this is probably not related to XPrivacy. You could check if a restrictions is causing this, but there are no restrictions directly related to back navigation. To be sure, check the usage view and/or clear XPrivacy data (see FAQ).\n. The flickering is caused by fixing flickering with the black theme.\n. If you can restrict something with XPrivacy, it is very unlikely you cannot undo it.\nI understand you cannot undo the internet restriction.\nChanging the internet restriction  requires a full restart of the application and sometimes of the device.\nOther restrictions can take 15 seconds to apply (or to undo) due to caching.\nSee the description of XPrivacy for details.\nIf you still experience this problem, please tell me the uid of the application and which restriction is the problem, so I can check the provide logcat.\n. unbanning is not an XPrivacy function, so this issue doesn't apply to XPrivacy.\nYou'll have to find support somewhere else.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. \"Now when I select an item from the \"usage data\" screen, nothing happens. I must back out of the usage data screen, then go find the permission and grant/deny it. It's just a small thing, but very convenient.\"\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=47619586&postcount=4458\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Isn't this already possible?\n<Hook restriction=\"clipboard\" method=\"addPrimaryClipChangedListener\" permissions=\"\" sdk=\"14\" />\n    <Hook restriction=\"clipboard\" method=\"getPrimaryClip\" permissions=\"\" sdk=\"14\" />\n    <Hook restriction=\"clipboard\" method=\"getPrimaryClipDescription\" permissions=\"\" sdk=\"14\" />\n    <Hook restriction=\"clipboard\" method=\"getText\" permissions=\"\" sdk=\"14\" />\n    <Hook restriction=\"clipboard\" method=\"hasPrimaryClip\" permissions=\"\" sdk=\"14\" />\n    <Hook restriction=\"clipboard\" method=\"hasText\" permissions=\"\" sdk=\"14\" />\nYou can make an exception for the functions mentioned above if you drill down the Clipboard category.\n. I don't want to have this in the main view of XPrivacy. The main view of XPrivacy should be as simple as possible.\nMoreover, making exceptions for functions should be done on per application basis and not for a list of applications. It are exceptions after all.\nAlso, not restriction all functions in the clipboard category will allow applications to fetch data from the clipboard.\n. Again thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the continuous translation updates!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Please describe the problem.\n. Two windows is fine, but you should return to the app settings.\n. Yes, this is as it should work.\n. I cannot reproduce this problem, but I am not running Android 4.3.\nCould you please:\n- Enable XPrivacy logging using the main menu (don't forget to press OK)\n- Power off your device\n- Start capturing a log from you PC using this command:\nadb logcat >xprivacy.log\n(you need to install the Android SDK for this if you haven't already)\nhttp://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html\n- Reproduce the problem\n- Wait 60 seconds\n- Stop logging by pressing Ctrl-C\n- Put the contents of the log file on pastebin or a similar service\n  http://pastebin.com/\n- Post the link to the log in this issue\n. Which ROM do you have running? (stock, CM, PAC, etc)\nWhich GSF version are you running?\nIt shouldn't be necessary to restart Google services.\n. Without a logcat there is little I can do.\nIt works for me and others.\n. Maybe clues:\n- Android version (reported so far: PAC 4.3)\n- GSF version\n. Please reopen this issue when providing a logcat.\n. Without logcat there is nothing I can do, since it works for most users, including myself.\n. @thelimper could you please try this:\n- Enable expert mode using the main menu\n- Go to the application details view for the application you want to have this work\n- Drill down the identification category and make sure GservicesProvider is checked\n- Check after 15 seconds if the GSF ID is restricted\n. This cannot be fixed, since it will break the fix to go to the correct application from the notification.\n. Look again at #804 :-)\n. You can try the just uploaded beta version 1.10.21\n. Same as #803\n. I have tried to fix this several times, but for now we have to choose between working notification and this inconvenience.\n. Can you also update the changelog?\n. Only data that applications get can be restricted.\nIt is not possible to change the IMEI, IP etc. of the device itself.\n. This looks like a bug in OI File Manager to me.\nE/InputDispatcher( 4010): channel '429a2640 biz.bokhorst.xprivacy/biz.bokhorst.xprivacy.ActivityMain (server)' ~ Channel is unrecoverably broken and will be disposed!\n. There is not much that can go wrong in XPrivacy.\nSending the intent to select a file:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/ActivityMain.java#L641\nReceiving the result with the selected file:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/ActivityMain.java#L363\nThis could also be a bug in Android.\n. I didn't try it yet, but this is a nice improvement!\nThanks for doing this.\n. Thanks for your effort!\n. As I have said before, only do it for fun and when you have time for it, so don't worry.\n. Manually merged: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/commit/b1bc6d8e98b11187d4e9b8b159b49c0ccea8a36b\n. This will result in a lot of complaints.\nIt should be possible to wipe a new/update notifications away.\nI do this quite often myself.\nThis change will disable that feature.\nMaybe there is a bug in your ROM, because this works for me.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Please provide a logcat as described here: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/issues/802#issuecomment-28962766\n. Can you please post a screenshot of the dial action?\n. Are you placing the phone call with the audio recorder itself?\n. android.intent.action.NEW_OUTGOING_CALL is probably restricted correctly, the phone number in this message will be replaced by a fake value. The message itself is not restricted.\nSee here for details:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XActivityThread.java#L142\nMy guess is that you expected that the message would be discard.\nThis is not the case, it is only altered.\n. See also here under Phone: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#restrictions\n'return a fake own/in/outgoing/voicemail number'\n. The concept of XPrivacy is that everything should be as normal as possible.\nThis means that intents (messages) are only discarded when there are no other options.\nIn all other cases a fake or empty value will be returned.\nDiscarding NEW_OUTGOING_CALL could result in problems when applications do not stop what they are doing when there is a phone call placed. I know you want to have that happen in this case, but that is not what XPrivacy is for.\n. The choice is to send the intent with a fake value or not to send the intent at all.\nBoth have advantages and disadvantages.\nThe intent could be discarded per restricted application.\n. Another concept is that XPrivacy should have as little as possible settings.\nI will think about this.\n. There is also a phone state listener:\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/PhoneStateListener.html\nThe phone state listener is another way to check for outgoing calls, however the phone state listener processes more things (that can be restricted) than only outgoing calls. To keep things consistent the phone state listener should be disabled too, which is not an option, because of the other things being processed.\nAnother thought: restricting locations now results in sending fake locations.\nHere it is also not an option to disable the location updates altogether.\n. No restrictions (all) will be applied when installing the pro enabler.\nThis is to allow manual restriction of the pro enabler.\n. You don't have to do anything, just enjoy using XPrivacy ;-)\n. Thanks again!\n. Thanks again for the update.\n. Although I consider this a valid feature request, I don't want any filtering (or anything else) in the main view that directly involves functions. Function restrictions are exceptions and are application specific.\n. Given that I don't want filtering in the main view that directly involves functions, you can do this:\n- Enable expert mode (this disables dangerous functions)\n- Select the category you want to check\n- Select Filter on restricted and Negate\n. What can be done is to use the tri-state checkbox for any category except for all to indicate that not all functions are restricted.\n. Test version: http://d-h.st/6Sq\nThis version shows the third checkbox state if not everything (including dangerous functions) is restricted.\nPlease test thoroughly, test is a big change.\nTest cases:\n- Enabling/disabling restrictions\n- Toggling restrictions\n- Applying template\n- New installed application (template applied)\n. @puchu thanks. The latest test release contains this feature, so don't download from the above link.\n. Official Samsung documentation:\nhttp://developer.samsung.com/s-pen-sdk/technical-docs-09\n. Test version: http://d-h.st/SNZ\nPlease let me know if it works and if it does a few screenshots are appreciated.\n. Reported to work.\n. Every translation update is welcome!\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the update, yaa Waleed!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Don't let my remarks fool you, I am glad you are helping out!\n. Manually merged, because of conflicts and some minor changes.\n. @BlueMax can you please confirm if this version can restrict the user agent on KitKat: http://d-h.st/vHJ\n. About the restrictions: that is correct, getSettings has replace the previous present functions.\nDid you reboot your device after installing the test version of XPrivacy?\nCan you enable XPrivacy logging (settings menu) and capture a logcat like this:\nadb shell \"logcat | grep XWeb\"\n. The screenshot shows getSettings was actually called.\n. @BlueMax can you please try if this version works: http://d-h.st/EvR\n. Could you capture a log like this:\nadb shell \"logcat | grep XPrivacy\"\nstart just before you run the browser, but reboot first, so I can see the initial hooking too.\n. Can you provide me with a logcat for the switch?\n. Another test version: http://d-h.st/rES\n(sorry, I cannot test myself, since I don't have a device that can run KitKat yet)\nIf it not works, please make a new logcat:\nadb shell \"logcat | grep XWeb\"\n. Another test version: http://d-h.st/Pll\n. :-(\n. Unfortunately I am out of ideas how to fix this at the moment.\nI will think about it, maybe I will get a good idea.\n. @gdmzyejian :\nI am using CM10 = Android 4.1.2 and it works perfectly for me.\nPlease provide a logcat.\n. @BlueMax good work!\nMaybe getUserAgent(String) needs to be hooked to fix this.\nDid you find useful class/method names to look into?\nChromium is open source, so we can look things up.\n. @BlueMax  could you please try if this version fixes your problem: http://d-h.st/4Wc\nPlease capture a log (whether it works or not).\n. Please try this newer version: http://d-h.st/IIe\n. :-(\n. @BlueMax again thanks for looking into this!\nI guess the old Android browser is present next to Chromium, explaining two user agent strings.\n. Test version with loadUrl hooked: http://d-h.st/j4E\n. Thanks for testing.\nWith your persistence I believe we can fix this problem!\n. @BlueMax thanks for your research!\nI guess we have to wait until this Chromium bug is fixed.\n. Thanks again for your research!\n- I only want to hook native/private methods as a last resort, because these hooks can break easily in a future releases\n- For now I think it is good to keep both hooks (setUserAgentString and loadUrl)\n. My proposal is to import/fetch the applications as shown (filtered).\n. @kaizokan yes, that is true, I will see what I can do.\n. @jpeg729 I was thinking about a similar approach as selecting accounts, applications and contacts, with added 'check/uncheck all'.\n. Merging into #1031\n. This file is not needed anymore.\nTry cleaning/refreshing the project.\n. Thanks again for the update!\n. http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowManager.LayoutParams.html#TYPE_SYSTEM_ALERT\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html#SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW\n. I had a compile error: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/commit/42f016c6ce0bc8340aecf3bd7190e6d02102f3e3\nI can confirm this works!\n. Don't worry, you will find errors in my code too!\nSoftware development is not a simple process.\nI am just glad you did this!\nGives me the opportunity to look into a restrictions problem #825 \n. Thanks!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Shukran!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. @jpeg729 could you please take a look at this?\n. This will eventually come, but it is a lot of work.\n. Want to help?\n. Version 1.99.40 has documentation for accounts, browser, calendar, calling, clipboard, contacts, dictionary and email.\n. It was a lot of work, but the documentation is complete now.\nThanks @jpeg729 for documenting a few categories.\n. Thanks!\n. Do you have the setting Extra usage data enabled?\nIf not, try enabling this setting using the main menu.\n. Please provide a logcat from application start.\nMake sure the application is not running before and that XPrivacy logging is enabled.\n. logRestriction is only used to write to the logcat.\n. Some more explanation.\nThe data goes into the queue here:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/PrivacyManager.java#L330\nAnd out of the queue here:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/PrivacyManager.java#L386\nsendUsageData is called from two places:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/PrivacyManager.java#L311\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XContextWrapper.java#L63\nFirst call depends on: isUsageDataEnabled\nSecond call depends on: isExtraUsageDataEnabled\n. @jbtwentytwo @wbedard could you please test if this version solves your problem: http://d-h.st/OvJ\n. @jbtwentytwo \nPlease use pastebin or a similar service and post a link to the paste here to keep the issue readable.\nDid you try to enable the settings Extra usage data ?\n. @jbtwentytwo that is correct, usage data will not update the first three minutes (but will be collected). This is to prevent instability during the startup process.\n. @jpeg729 so, my code was correct ;-)\nI guess it was a placebo effect.\nMaybe there should be a toast after 3 minutes that says something like 'Usage data started'.\nPlease undo the change to keep the code clean.\nJust add a commit to the open pull request.\n. @vanowm the amount of usage data has never been decreasaed, only increased with newer versions. The first three minutes after boot no new usage data will be displayed (but it is recorded and will be displayed later).\nDid you try to enable the new setting Extra usage data ?\n. Next version will have a bug fixed and a new feature to send usage data on application (force) close.\n. Thanks!\n. Nice issue report.\nThis was fixed in version 1.10.30.\n. PrivacyManager.setSettings would only update mRestrictionCache within the XPrivacy virtual machine (VM), not in the VM of other applications, where the settings almost always are needed.\n. Thanks for finding this!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. That is already possible, just disable the filter on permissions.\n. You can do that yourself by ticking the NFC category for the application.\nI don't want to XPrivacy automatically restrict things, cause it can break the application when there is an update that adds a new permission, like NFC is added to Google Wallet.\n. Try this: select the category NFC, then menu Toggle restrictions.\nThis will switch the NFC category on or off for the applications visible.\nI will think about your feature request.\n. @kosique the only use case I see here is restrict everything without permission, except everything with permission. I guess that is what you want?\n. Merging with #1031\n. Please provide a complete logcat.\n. I don't see the exception of the screen shot in the logcat.\nAre you sure this is caused by XPrivacy, because I don't see XPrivacy in the exception shown in the screenshot.\n. A probable cause is that you restricted Shell/load(Library) for this application (SoundManager).\nTry clearing XPrivacy data (see the FAQ) and rebooting.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. This is how ACRA hooks into Android to handle FC's, ANR's etc:\nhttps://github.com/ACRA/acra/blob/master/src/main/java/org/acra/ACRA.java#L124\nThis is the handler:\nhttps://github.com/ACRA/acra/blob/master/src/main/java/org/acra/ErrorReporter.java#L81\nBasically a wrapped UncaughtExceptionHandler:\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler.html\n. Okay, this is not difficult:\n- create a class implementing Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler for example XUncaughtExceptionHandler\n- the class constructor should accept Application as argument\n- store the application in a private class member as context (Application is a context!)\n- the implementation of uncaughtException should call sendUsageData\n- hook Application.onCreate (mandatory super call, like onPause)\n- in after: create a new instance of XUncaughtExceptionHandler\n. Function display checked if the function will be restricted, but are stored as an exception to the category to reduce the number of settings and to have a faster check.\n. Which function did you expected to be restricted?\n. Did you check in the log if the functions were restricted?\nFor Build.SERIAL there is no usage data.\n. There is no usage data for SERIAL, since this is a static variable.\nThere is no way to see if the variable is used.\nThis is documented here:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#limitations\n. About /proc usage data, we have introduced a bug here recently:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/PrivacyManager.java#L317\nUsage data is queued before calling getRestrictedFallback.\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. If I am not wrong, this change will make the user wait for filtering after application startup.\nMy proposal is not to do this and use the new export/import/fetch progress bar to show filtering progress.\n. That is odd, maybe there is a bug in that specific filter.\n.

For some reason Samsung uses a custom clipboard manager:\ngetSystemService clipboardEx=android.sec.clipboard.ClipboardExManager\n. Don't worry, I will fix this :-)\n. @kaizokan could you please try if this version fixes your problem: http://d-h.st/4Wc\nPlease capture a log (whether it works or not).\n. Please try this newer version: http://d-h.st/IIe\n. Samsung even invented an own service name: clipboardEx.\nBut now we know ... ;-)\n. Can you please try this version: http://d-h.st/cDk\n. So it does work now?\nI like to see a logcat to see if there are no side effects.\n. :-(\nI like to see the lines after the first ever '... getSystemService clipboardEx= ...'.\nXPrivacy tries to hook the clipboard manager only one time, maybe it fials.\n. You can try with an application you didn't start after the last boot yet.\n. Yes, that part.\nI see hooking the custom clipboard manager failed ...\nI am out of idea about how to solve this.\n. @jokies point me to a module that has this working and I will take a look.\n. Smali: http://searchcode.com/codesearch/view/42622580\n. More sources: http://d-h.st/4lk\nThanks @Tungstwenty !\n. The issue was closed because it can't be fixed. Moreover it is less relevant, because the clipboard restrictions will work in AOSP mode.\n. Fake WiFi to 3G: see the FAQ, question 35.\nWhy do you want to have random cell ID's?\n. @Cerberus-tm the cell info can already be restricted, which will result in an empty cell info list, effectively hiding your network location.\n. @gdmzyejian as said: cell info can be restricted and IMHO an empty cell info list is better than fake cell ID's.\n. @gdmzyejian about the advertisements/downloads: IMHO that should be prevented at the root of the problem, not by faking a connection type.\n. @Cerberus-tm there are limits to the things I want to build into XPrivacy. The ultimate privacy protection is restricting device boot ... ;-)\n. \"cell info can be restricted and IMHO an empty cell info list is better than fake cell ID's.\"\nFurthermore I am afraid that random cell ID's could cause trouble, because they are not consistent with other information, for example the country of the network.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. @laoasl English please.\n. I don't see the point of export/backup of one application if you can select which application(s) to import.\nA backup has no value if it is not complete.\nDuplicate of #826\n. See #826\n. Thanks for the update!\n. I don't want to duplicate something that already exists.\nWith the new application icon tap accessing this information has become easier.\n. Thanks for the translation!\nCan you please remove all strings with translatable=\"false\".\nAre you sure ie is the right locale?\n. Thanks for the update!\n. The Media category is to restrict access to the camera, microphone, etc. If you want to restrict access to your photos, probably stored on your sdcard, you'll have to use the Storage category. Read the description on GitHub on this category before using it.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. IMHO this is to much code for something that should be already clear to the user.\n. Manually merged, because of merge conflicts.\n. It is not necessary to restrict the search manager since Android provides a user interface.\n. Long press a function name to toggle dangerous or not.\n. Thanks!\n. All in all good work again!\n. I guess you want to review/improve my quick and dirty solution: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/commit/87a3db86fd3ff1da428c7d9c91b5cb5699ab8fe4 https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/commit/73d58c008c45c93a37d907bf034b69a15f9a51f3 https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/commit/cbc80644d3198ab089d7908acab2891376761d44\n. @Cerberus-tm thanks for answering!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. This is a very good idea!\n. I like to have it open with a simple click and to be removed from the existing menu.\n. All functions marked 'restart' have no usage data.\n. Good idea!\n. The usage data delay of three minutes after boot is a workaround, which will eventually be removed.\n. Maybe we can do this too in the newly planned activity share dialog, like a check mark indicating the app needs restarting and maybe even a button to do it.\nToggle task could be moved to activity share for this.\n. This should be added to activity share.\n. Thanks for the updates!\n. Don't worry about the update frequency.\nIt is nothing compare to the total number of commits (2804 at this moment).\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/commits/master\n. Where is the logat?\nDid you try clearing XPrivacy data?\n(see the FAQ for how to)\n. Apparently there is a new restriction causing your problem, but unfortunately I don't know which one.\nYou can run XPrivacy with either the enabler or the license, but both is not required.\nIf you have the pro license, then you can uninstall the enabler.\n. Could you please review these commits if I didn't miss anything?\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/commit/4c2bd0e9adf4d038cb5ff68dca5cae35251b9e28\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/commit/d964f9853138b37c2f9857ba192ab8036a088111\nAlso check if the progress still works as should.\n. Thanks for finding and fixing this!\n. I am thinking of marking applications that have been submitted for the crowd sourced restrictions and nothing else.\n. New installed or default template applied?\n. One addition: red means danger, so orange is better IMHO.\n. +1 for the bar\n. My proposal:\n- Bright orange = new\n- Bright green = submitted\n- Gray: non of the above\nYes, green is only for submitted application settings. Reasoning: it can be assumed the settings are correct and combined with grey/orange it is an invitation to submit settings\n. There is no \"force\", it is just an invitation, for the benefit of everybody!\nThe workflow would be: new application (after default template): bright orange, set any restriction: gray, submitted: joyful green. This means you can stop at the gray, which isn't an annoying color that draws attention.\n. Test version: http://d-h.st/KRa\nFeedback is appreciated.\n. This feature is in the just released version 1.10.39\n. Thanks again for the update!\n. Thanks again for the update!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks, Tony!\n. Thanks, Tony!\n. Shukran, yaa Waleed Hassan!\n. Every update is welcome!\n. Fixed on the crowd sourced restrictions server\n. I haven't found any app with shared labels so far, so this seems to be not a good solution.\n. Duplicate of #899 \nBut you probably didn't realize that ;-)\nBTW, working on this now ...\n. This is to be expected. Instead of loading all info at start (remember the progress bar that took so long), the info is now loaded on demand. It is either the one or the other, but IMHO this is better.\n. I think we should use ShowcaseView to make our life easier.\n. I already checked the license and it is okay, so I don't mind adding it as a dependency. I don't think we will find a better way to add a tutorial that is as nice and as simple this.\njpeg729 notifications@github.com schreef:\n\nI knew it existed, but I just couldn't find it yesterday.\nIf we just stick to backing out part of the screen then I'm pretty sure\nmy\ncode is correct.

Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for translating the new texts!\n. Duplicate of #906 \n. Thanks for the update!\n. What about the colors in the dark theme? Are they okay?\n. Thanks for the translation update and colors!\n. Please reopen when it is still a problem in the next version.\n. Basically this is a duplicate of #869 \n(I know it is not exactly the same)\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. \"How can I translate detail tutorial?\"\n\nNot yet, I am waiting for feedback on XDA.\nAs soon as the texts are okay, I will add them to all translations.\n. It is to save the translators, including you, work.\nHow do you like the tutorial?\nAnything that should be improved?\nMore texts?\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Thanks again!\n. IMHO this will be too complicated to for most users.\n. You are the first translating this, thanks!\n. Merging into #1031\n. Thanks for translating the tutorials!\n. Sorry, it is not a simple task to support Gingerbread and not worthwhile, since the number of GB users is decreasing fast now.\n. Thanks for the translation update and don't worry about the typo in the commit message!\n. Thanks, John, I am glad I don't have to do everything alone anymore!\n. Are the intents still available from outside XPrivacy?\n(for example for integration into tasker)\n. The disadvantage of a service it should have (can't have) a UI, which might be needed later.\n. I don't think the service is available form outside, since the intent filters in the manifest are removed.\n. What I want to do is the give ActivityShare a user interface. In this way we can show more detailed progress information, for example failed/empty fetches when doing a batch fetch, and add a button to cancel a bath operation.\n. Thanks for translating the tutorial!\nI am sure it will help somebody at least a little.\n. Thanks for your translation work!\n. I don't see the screenshot on GitHub, can you please contact me here:\nhttp://forum.faircode.eu/contact/\n. Thanks for the corrections!\n. Thanks again!\n. Additions to #931 \n. I like to have a little as possible settings to keep the usage of XPrivacy simple.\n. Merging into #1031\n. This is something the OS (Android) should support.\nActually some ROMs like OmniROM do.\n. What should be searched for?\n. Already part of XPrivacy.\n. Maybe this app checks for XPrivacy.\nProvide a logcat, see the FAQ for how to, else there is little I can do.\n. This is why you can restrict shell and superuser access with XPrivacy.\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Please provide a new log with XPrivacy logging enabled (menu > settings).\n. Scratch that, I already found the cause.\n. Can you please try if this version fixes your problem: http://d-h.st/7xB\n. The follow up exception in XPrivacy is gone now in any case.\nThe real problem is within the ROM itself:\n12-14 22:13:39.369 E/AndroidRuntime(2441): FATAL EXCEPTION: main\n12-14 22:13:39.369 E/AndroidRuntime(2441): Process: com.android.systemui, PID: 2441\n12-14 22:13:39.369 E/AndroidRuntime(2441): android.content.res.Resources$NotFoundException: Array resource ID #0x0\nThis has nothing to do with XPrivacy (but maybe it has to do with Xposed).\n. <string name=\"Used.10167.WebView.constructor\">1386148417405:true</string>\n<string name=\"Used.10167.WebView\">1387015842310:false</string>\nThis is nothing to worry about, because it is caused by moving around things in different test versions.\nIf it bothers you, you can delete all usage data:\nrm /data/data/biz.bokhorst.xprivacy/shared_prefs/biz.bokhorst.xprivacy.provider.usage.*.xml\n. Thanks for this big translation update!\n. This behavior is intentional.\nIt has not specifically to do with dangerous function exceptions.\nEnabling or disabling a restriction category never changes function exceptions to prevent losing functions exceptions by accident.\nThere is only one function that alters function exceptions: clear.\n. See the FAQ.\n. Because it is not related to your privacy = identify you and collect data about you.\n. I think it is clear what @KOLANICH means \"I think you should make it possible to revoke some other permissions, not necesary connected with privacy\". As the FAQ says, I am happy to add new restrictions, as long as they are privacy related.\n. 1. Because my time is not unlimited\n2. I don't know\n. No, because I am probably the one who has to maintain it.\n. See issue #960 \n. This message has been removed, because it caused trouble on some ROMs (crashes and reboots)\n. I cannot test for all ROMs.\nThe goal is to have a little as possible options, so that inexperienced people also understand everything.\n. Sorry, I will not support this.\n. See also here: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ18\n. Frozen applications are an exception, so I don't want to add more features for this than displaying that an application is frozen.\nAt a given point of time a vote was submitted, so it is reasonable to assume it was correct.\nElse a vote can always be submitted again.\nOther votes will vote the wrong vote away in the end.\nIMHO uninstalling an application is not a reason for undoing a vote.\nMoreover, allowing undoing votes is difficult to secure.\n. GserviceProvider restricts the GSF ID (Google Service Framework Android ID), which is a 64-bit number (as a 16 digit hex string) that is generated randomly on the device's first GSF login and will remain constant for the lifetime of the device (the value will change with a factory reset). So, the length is not the problem.\nFailed connection could be caused by another restriction. Check the usage log or the logcat.\n. There is little I can do about this, you can try to enter values in the settings to see if it is related to the fake random values being used, but I don't think this is the cause of the problem. I am quite sure the GSF ID is correctly restricted (the code is actually quite simple and reviewed by another developer).\nThe GSF ID is different from the device ID and actually there are some more ID's to make it even more confusing.\n. https://panopticlick.eff.org/ uses this information:\n- User Agent: can already be restricted, although it doesn't work correctly with Chrome #825\n- HTTP_ACCEPT Headers: no web setting available\n- Browser Plugin Details: Chrome does not support plugins (anymore)\n- Time Zone: no web settings available\n- Screen Size and Color Depth: no web settings available\n- System Fonts: set...Font.. could be used\n- Are Cookies Enabled? can be disabled, but most website will not work correctly anymore\n- Limited supercookie test: same\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebSettings.html\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/CookieManager.html\nSo, only fonts could be manipulated, everything else is browser internal.\nFont are however the same for most Android devices.\nSo, not much can be done unfortunately :-(\n. Another thought: your external IP will always be known anyway.\n. My best guess is that you have something else restricted, which is causing this. Try to make exceptions for the functions in the account category.\n. I have just tested this by only restricting accounts and allowing the Google account and for me this is working.\n. Duplicate of #838\n. The browser should function as normal ;-) The browser user agent should be restricted, although there is a known problem with Chrome. Did you expect something else? Did I miss something ?\n. I have just tested if the user agent is correctly restricted for Dolphin browser and it is.\n. Thanks for the translation update!\nHow is XPrivacy received on PTT.cc ?\n. Thanks for your response!\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Thanks for the translation update!\nI can image it was not easy to translate \"Maximum fetch confidence interval\".\n. Good question :-)\nI will add this to the FAQ.\nXPrivacy cannot hook into native libraries, but can prevent native libraries from loading. This will break most applications, like Facebook, but can prevent malware from doing its work. loadLibrary is in the shell restriction category.\nXPrivacy can also restrict access to the Linux shell (including superuser), to prevent native binaries from running.\nTechnically it is almost impossible to hook into native libraries or native binaries, due to the variety in kernel and binary versions and platform types (like ARM and Intel).\n. In general, due to the architecture of Android, any call to native libraries and binaries is through Java and can thus be hooked and prevented by XPrivacy.\n. Another addition: as far as I know any route to a native library or binary is covered by the current XPrivacy version.\n. XPrivacy runs before anything a Java application can do and can thus hook into everything an application could misuse. I am not saying that XPrivacy is perfect, nothing is, but conceptually it is safe. Android is huge, so maybe not everything is hooked yet.\nThere is however nothing that can be done to applications having superuser powers (including other Xposed mods, which is easily overlooked).\n. About your alternative simpler way: this is what XPrivacy does, but on Android level and where needed within the service itself.\n. Maybe it is an idea to chat (GTalk).\nIf you want you can contact me using this contact form:\nhttp://forum.faircode.eu/contact/\n. \"You must have 20 reputation on Stack Overflow to talk here.\"\n(I didn't even know there was a chat option ...)\nAlthough you are not an Android expert, I like to exchange thoughts especially from the perspective of Linux.\nI like to have XPrivacy as secure as possible and maybe you can contribute to that.\nIt would be interesting in any case I guess ;-)\nI can chat over GTalk or MSN or maybe IRC (but then I have to figure out how).\n. As an extra security layer revoke permissions for restricted functions.\n. @jpeg729 didn't you recently figured out how to do this? Can you point me to the code to save me time?\n. This will be implemented in another way.\n. A usage log is already a feature of XPrivacy,\n. To have an interactive mode an Android context object is needed, which is quite often not available, since XPrivacy hooks deep into Android, like for example NetworkInfo.\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ18\n. Pull to the stable branch is not needed, but solving the merge conflicts would be nice.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Android permissions do not cover all restrictions.\n. IMHO disabling all update notifications in one go for a privacy application is not a good idea.\n955 will make it easier to disable updates notifications per application when they occur.\n. This notification is to important to disable and does not appear as often as update notifications.\n. Thanks again!\n. Can you please try if this version fixes this problem: http://d-h.st/cGp\nWhich application has this problem?\n. Thanks for testing and reporting back!\n. @jpeg729 better not work on this, since I have an idea that makes timed reloading of the cache completely obsolete. Look at XPackacgeManagerService and you might figure out what I have in mind ;-)\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. IMHO this is too much work, given the number of people that will use this.\n. Didn't I prepare this nicely by making getting the checkboxes a common method? ;-)\n. Thanks, John!\n. Merging with #944\n. I will work on this this weekend.\nSubmit and fetch will be extended with a flag indicating accounts, applications or contact were selected.\n. The next version of XPrivacy will submit if there were accounts, applications and/or contacts allowed. The crowd sourced restriction server has already been adapted to store and use this info, so even older versions of XPrivacy will get the correct restrictions. If anything is allowed the corresponding category will not be restricted to prevent problems. The function exceptions are fetched, so it is easy to allow an account and restrict the category with the correct exceptions.\nThe crowd sourced restrictions web site has also been adapted to show the new information (column exceptions)\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks again!\n. Thanks again for the update.\nYou are in time for the next stable release.\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. http://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/WifiConfiguration.html\nhttp://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/ext/com.google.android/android/4.3_r2.1/android/net/wifi/WifiConfiguration.java/\n. @tonymanou this file is ROM, supplicant version and driver dependent.\n/data is normally not accessible to application, so I don't think it is a good idea to restrict these files.\n. You can already restrict access to Wi-Fi passwords by restricting network/getConfiguredNetworks and to be sure also network/getWifiApConfiguration.\n. Thanks for the corrections!\n. I like the way the Xposed module download sorter work.\nJust one icon that takes screenspace.\n. I will look into this pull request after releasing the stable version.\n. Could you please try if this version fixes the problem: http://d-h.st/RSS\n. This problem should be fixed in version 1.10.51 (available in the Xposed repo).\n. I am just glad you report back!\n. The \"about\" dialog shows where to put the license file and if everything is okay at the same place your name is shown. If you still have troubles with activation the Pro features, please contact me by replying to the activation instructions and I will try to help you.\n. Awesomeness, I like that word, so this will come ;-)\n. I am making this duplicate of #945, because I think both feature requests should be looked at together, which doesn't mean they are the same.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Probably this: #816 \n. BTW, you won the prize: the 1000th issue.\nPrize = eternal fame ;-)\n. XPrivacy reminds you to restart an application, not reboot your device.\nSome permissions are enforced by Linux, for example internet and storage.\nThe application process needs to be restarted to change the gids (group IDs).\nIf your translation is not accurate:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#contributing\n. Thanks for this big update!\n. Will be solved by #826\nExports are backups and need to be complete.\n. See my remark in the other issue.\n. The reason for this behavior is that the export is meant to be a complete backup.\nThat is why you need to explicitly 'override' this behavior.\n. Thanks, John!\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Could you please try clearing the XPrivacy data? (see the FAQ for how to). My best guess some restriction is causing this.\n. Relevant documentation:\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/location/LocationClient.html\n. This test version of XPrivacy should allow you to restricted GSF locations as requested: http://d-h.st/33y\nThere is a new set of function restrictions for this, whose names start with GMS.\n. Confirmed to be working.\n. Yes\n. Duplicate of #825\n. Please upgrade to the latest version.\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Thanks for implementing this!\n. I don't think this is necessary anymore with my implementation of multiple select.\n. For the translation of confidence interval you can read this wikipedia item:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval\n. Thanks for the translation update\n. Sorry, Gingerbread will not be supported.\nSupporting the current version is already enough work and the number of Gingerbread devices is decreasing rapidly anyway.\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Thanks John!\nQuite an elegant solution.\n. I have implemented this in a different way now.\n. IMHO most of this should go into the application description on GitHub.\nThe expert options are for expert and should not need explanation. What would be nice is to hide the (sub) expert options altogether and have a notice that these option normally shouldn't be used and that questions about these will not be answered.\n. http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=48891238&postcount=5371\n. My proposal is to have an option to export the license file again.\n. This is not a safe location, other would be able to read your e-mail address and name from the license file.\n. I am not going to add an export option for the license file.\nThe license file is stored in the XPrivacy application data folder.\nXPrivacy will never erase this file.\nIf it gets lost, XPrivacy data has been reset somehow.\nOf course it is best to prevent resetting XPrivacy data.\nElse, you can either let XPrivacy import the license file again or restore a backup of XPrivacy.\n. Actually this is a bug introduced rewriting the import to make it faster.\n. Merging into #1029\n. My proposal is to implement this by allowing multiple imports with the option to not delete existing restrictions.\n. I guess you can do what you want now with the new multiple select option, so I close this issue.\n. Thanks for the new translation!\nIf you want a free pro license, please contact me through this contact form:\nhttp://forum.faircode.eu/contact/\n. @jpeg729: I have solved multiple select in a simpler way, see the referenced commits.\nThe colors and the selection area is not perfect yet, but it works with just a few lines of code.\n. @amynbe  you can do this with the batch operations, for which a pro license is needed.\n. IMHO the free version is perfectly usable, only you have to do some more work. That is why the pro features are called convenience features. Your support to the project, just a few dollars/euros is appreciated. I have spent about 2500 hours developing and supporting XPrivacy and believe me the few donations I get are by far a compensation for that. fortunately the project is not about the money, but I like to see some support, so I know I am not doing things for nothing. Note that you can get a free pro license if you contribute to the project.\n. By default on demand restricting is disabled for already installed applications, so I am wondering why you got so many on demand popups.\n. Then you can deactivate it too, or am I wrong?\n. Please note that I merged this translation manually, because you have changed the English translation.\nChanges should be requested against this file:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/res/values-tl-rPH/strings.xml\n. @jpeg729: this is probably caused by caching the category names. My proposal is to remove the cache.\n. This is how Google designed it to work.\nThere is a difference in back and up navigation.\n. Maybe it is worth trying this solution:\nhttp://developer.android.com/training/implementing-navigation/ancestral.html#BuildBackStack\n. I have added this to the top of the changelog.\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Without logging of the force close there is little I can do.\n. Some functions in the storage category do not have usage data.\nIn the latest version of XPrivacy this is indicated with a grayed data usage symbol.\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. This will translate the English texts.\nIs this a new translation? For which language?\n. Don't worry, I appreciate your intention.\nYou should make a pull request against this file:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/res/values-tl-rPH/strings.xml\nMaybe it is best to start over with creating the pull request:\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests\n. Even an update for one string is welcome!\n. Duplicate of #1031\nRestrictions are only cleared for applications found on the server. Restrictions for system applications can only be fetch individually.\n. System applications are not batch fetched, I have checked:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/ActivityShare.java#L528\n. It should be an OR: not system application OR individual fetch.\nNevertheless I will test this later again.\n. Could you please try if this version solves the problem: http://d-h.st/h8L\n. The scroll itself should be smooth, although that depends on your device speed and the available memory.\nNot delaying the display of the application icons will result in more lag.\nThis has been changed in the recent versions and will not be changed back.\nThe list scroll has been optimized as per Google specification:\nhttp://developer.android.com/training/improving-layouts/smooth-scrolling.html\nI will not customized this, since all previous attempts resulted in side effects.\n. I see no way to fix this. \nThe package manager is needed to provide information about an application. When you start XPrivacy, while an application is unrestricted, XPrivacy will always be to late to apply the template, because the package manager is not available during the early stage of the boot.\n. The case of the serial number is unspecified.\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.html#SERIAL\nIt might be lower, upper or mixed case, depending on the device.\n. See the FAQ: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ45\n. You will have to ask elsewhere, sorry.\n. This is available now: http://forum.faircode.eu/forums/forum/android/xprivacy/\n. Small translation updates are also very welcome!\n. @jpeg729 maybe it is an idea to calculate the brightness for the activated highlight color and compare this to the brightness of the background color and invert the color if the difference is to small.\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/Util.java#L406\nNot very good researched, maybe there are a built-in Java functions:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/596216/formula-to-determine-brightness-of-rgb-color\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/1165107/how-do-i-invert-a-colour-color-c-net\nAlthough inverting colors near gray will not make much difference.\n. Do I smell here some nice baking? ;-)\n. Could you please try if this version solves the problem: http://d-h.st/h8L\n. I am assuming the test version worked.\nIf not, please leave a comment.\n. The usage data is shown for all applications or per application using the main menu or application menu 'Usage data'.\nAlso, usage data is shown in the form of orange triangles.\nEnabling the option 'Android usage data' will enabled usage data for Android itself (generally uid 1000).\nNote that this may cause instability on some ROMs.\n. I have never seen this behavior.\nHow can I reproduce this?\n. Isn't this the same issues as #1049 ?\n. I have tried several times and I cannot reproduce this, which will make it difficult to fix.\n. Yes, I like to see it, please upload it somewhere and post a link here.\n. Could you please try if this version solves the problem: http://d-h.st/h8L\n. Looking at the videos, which are difficult to watch, since they are rotated 90 degrees and have low resolution, I see nothing special. I guess you mean that the icons and check marks display later. This is completely normal. As this was not done the scroll would be lag. The list views are optimized as per Google's specification:\nhttp://developer.android.com/training/improving-layouts/smooth-scrolling.html\n. Thanks for the translation.\nAs you see the text need to be there for the other languages too.\nThere is a script to add new strings, else it is a tedious work to do this for all languages.\n. Yes, I know, but this will it make difficult for translators to locate new strings.\n. First of all thanks for your contribution!\nI will add this, but there needs to be a check if the class is available, else there will be messages in the logcat for ROMs that do not have this content provider (and the other way around for the standard content provider).\nYou can probably check with Class.forName(), but this needs to be tested.\nDo you have any idea why Motorola made a custom content provider?\n. I think it is a good idea to chat now and then (I know you maintain XPrivacyGB).\nIf you think the same, please contact me through this contact form to exchange (GTalk) addresses:\nhttp://forum.faircode.eu/contact/\n. The new test is if the package name is either com.android.providers.contacts or com.motorola.blur.providers.contacts. After that there will be a hook attempt for both CallLogProvider and BlurCallLogProvider of which one will most probably fail.\n. Thanks for the pull request and updating it.\n. Thanks for the translation update!\nTo other translators: if something should be change, you can always do a pull request.\n. Thanks for the translation update again!\n. Can you please try again with this version and provide a new logcat if it is still crashing: http://d-h.st/Eti\n. Thank you for reporting this issue and reporting back!\n. I am sorry, but the pull request conflicts with a previously merged pull request.\nCan you please fix this?\n. Thanks for the translation update, Tony!\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Merging is mostly also fast ;-)\n. Which scroll issue will be fixed and why?\n(I like to understand what I merge)\n. Thanks for the explanation.\n. Reading the referenced article and some other articles this change will actually reduce scroll performance.\nThe cacheColorHint is to speed up scrolling performance by avoiding alpha blending for the background.\nSo, I don't think it is a good idea to disable it.\n. Thanks for the updated/fixed translation!\n. Thanks for this big translation update!\n. Reading the issue and some other resources, this change can have side effects.\nMy proposal: use Build.VERSION.SDK_INT to make it conditional.\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION.html#SDK_INT\nYou can do pull requests for other changes for GB too, but one change per pull request, so we can discuss each change separately if needed.\n. Duplicate of #1031\n. Which application did you uninstall and how?\n. I have added extra logging to XPrivacy to find out what is happening.\nCould you please enable XPrivacy debug logging (main XPrivacy settings), start capturing a logcat and reproduce this issue?\n. The exceptions in the logcat are not the problem.\nNewer XPrivacy versions list the package list (when you enable debugging), which I want to see to check if the package is not listed by the Android package manager or if there is a bug in XPrivcay.\n. I mean lines like:\npackage=... uid=...\nThese will be there when starting XPrivacy (written while \"loading\").\n. I don't see these lines in the pastebin, but maybe I am stupid.\nAnyway, these are the lines we are searching for.\nOn each \"loading\" XPrivacy logs these lines, especially for this issue.\nSo record the lines (maybe only for the uid of the package to be removed) before and after removing the package.\n. Can you add a link to the XDA post please?\nDid you check if this isn't caused by a restriction by\n- looking at the usage data (main menu)\n- clearing XPrivacy data (see the FAQ for how to)\n. Did you check if this isn't caused by a restriction by\n- looking at the usage data (main menu)\n- clearing XPrivacy data (see the FAQ for how to)\n. See the XDA forum for a solution.\n. @jpeg729 look into XIoBridge ;-)\nWhich doesn't mean it is feasible to do considering for example performance.\n. This is exactly what was initially asked for ...\n. I am going to close this issue, since the recent versions of XPrivacy will allow you to deny/allow on per file basis, also on demand. Later there will probably be a white list, see #1375\n. That is what the IPC category is for ...\n. Which application does request for this permission?\n. That library doesn't require the mentioned permission and simply uses SMTP to send a message.\n. It appears GMail has a provider:\nhttps://developers.google.com/gmail/android/\n. See here: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ35\n. There was one complaint, but I guess we cannot fix this for everybody.\n. Thanks for your work here!\nIt seems the logic of getNfcAdapter / getDefaultNfcAdapter has been changes over Android versions.\nI will hook getDefaultNfcAdapter too.\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n.

XPrivacy is not involved in the exception / fatal error / die.\nMaybe you can compare Play store versions.\nGoogle has the habit of releasing different versions to different devices / Android versions.\n. Maybe you can try without XPrivacy/Xposed to be sure neither is causing this problem.\n. I am aware of that and this will be fixed in a next release.\nThis applies to all batch operations.\n. This will be fixed in the next version.\n. This is the way I want to go!\nThis enables us to implement #1029 and #881 and maybe other feature request in a nice way!\n. Will also fix #1091 since start for result is not needed anymore.\n. I didn't research this, but it should be possible to use Android localized exception messages.\n. This translation conflicts with an earlier merged pull request.\nCan this be fixed?\n. Can you please try if this version fixes the error and if location restriction still works: http://d-h.st/9ib\nThis version should also be able to restrict locations acquired through the Google Play services again.\n. Thanks for testing and reporting back!\nI have no explanation for the other error.\nCan you please post some more log lines (before and after the message) ?\n. Thanks for the log file.\nI will look into it tomorrow.\n. Did you clear data and then reboot?\n. Do you still have these errors on subsequent reboots?\n. No, don't clear data.\nIt is good that this can be reproduced.\nIt is a more serious problem than it looks like, so I like to solve it.\nCan you please post the output of:\nls -al /data/data/biz.bokhorst.xprivacy/shared_prefs/biz.bokhorst.xprivacy.provider.settings.xml\nAnd a more complete logcat, with more than only the XPrivacy logging?\nDoes your Android version have SELinux (Fort Knox) enabled?\n. You can use this contact form: http://forum.faircode.eu/contact/\n. It looks like this problem is caused by restricting /proc.\nI have not figured out how yet, but could you try without this restriction?\n. Can you please try again with this version and make a new logcat: http://d-h.st/EUE\n. I didn't receive the log file ...\n. @an0n981 Thanks to your help I have figured out what is going on. The latest test version I have sent has almost fixed this problem. I will release a new version today that will have this problem fixed.\nYour device seems not to be very fast (or the exact opposite of that), which device are you using?\n. No need for excuses, just thanks for the translation update!\n. You can clear all restrictions before importing, or with the new multiple select selected applications.\nThe export file would be quite large when doing this, with little added value.\n. If the UI needs to be changed for longer strings, if possible, you can do a pull request for that too.\n. I cannot automatically merge this pull request, because it adds all text again. You have probably not merged the latest changes in XPrivacy into your local repository before making the changes I will merge this later manually.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Please tap seven times on the text \"Check to restrict\" to send me the support info.\n. Does restricting locations work in other applications?\n. No, I didn't receive the support info.\n. The report is not app based.\nCC yourself so you can see if it arrives.\n. http://dl.xda-developers.com/attachdl/75fa0a1cc4c7251d31d7fcf340f5b40e/52d56941/2/5/1/5/2/4/9/XP_log.txt\n. Can you please provide a new logcat with this version: http://d-h.st/64k\n. Will be fixed in the next release.\n. You should not Greenify either, greenifying the provider will certainly give problems and greenifying the UI has no benefits.\n. \"Before submitting any issue please make sure you are running the latest version of XPrivacy\"\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support\nSo, please test again in 1.11.11\n. It is worth trying if the experimental version 1.11.13 fixes this problem: http://d-h.st/XqW\nNote: this version is not available in the Xposed repo.\n. Logcat from XDA: https://www.dropbox.com/s/gkwkb9qwvb8x2r3/xprivacy1.txt\n. @mbdw which XPrivacy version(s) did you use?\n@an0n981 is this the .bak problem?\n. @an0n981 this will probably be fixed after the settings are moved to a database\n@mbdw please try version 1.11.13\n. @mbdw also disable Android usage data in the settings, if enabled\n. @mbdw use the Xposed disabler flashable to disable Xposed, then check the settings and if Android usage data is enabled, then disable it, installed Xposed again using the Xposed installer and reboot to see the result.\n. I guess @an0n981 suggestion will fix your problem.\n. I am working on a solution for this problem, but it involves quite some work, so please have patience and use the workaround when needed.\n. This should be fixed in version 1.99.1\n. Version 1.99.1: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=49550922\n. What should be searched for?\n. I don't want to put time into this, you can select the correct letter and use your Browser to search (Ctrl+F).\n. Thanks for the update!\n. This is a bug in Android, more applications suffer from this. I found a creative solution, but it breaks other things. So, indeed this will be a 'cantfix', unless somebody comes up with a solution.\n. @liudongmiao see start post\n. @PonsAsinorem the default in HoloIRC is the light theme:\nhttps://github.com/tilal6991/HoloIRC/blob/master/HoloIRC/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml#L13\nSo, I guess there will be flicker when using the dark theme.\n. The HoloIRC logic is exactly the same as for XPrivacy:\nhttps://github.com/tilal6991/HoloIRC/blob/master/HoloIRC/src/main/java/com/fusionx/lightirc/ui/ServerListActivity.java#L89\n. I am closing this issue, please comment if you find a solution (or better do a pull request).\n. Thanks for the updated translation!\n. Thanks for the updated translation!\n. Android only reports the uid in an package change intent, so it is impossible to show the correct application name.\nMoreover XPrivacy restricts based on uid, so all applications with the same uid are affected.\nAs a nice workaround XPrivacy will use inbox style notifications on JellyBean or better to show the first four applications names and an addition \"...\" if there are more applications.\n. Yes, that would be possible, but XPrivacy works with uids, so listing as much as possible app names is IMHO better.\n. Can you make a pull request for this?\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Restricting shell should hide your hostname.\n. Can you please post the output of:\ngetprop | grep host\n. Did you try restricting shell already?\n. Is not possible restrict access to build.prop without shell or exec?\nNo, unfortunately this isn't possible.\n/system/build.prop will restrict all build props, including the % cases.\nIf usage data for one works, usage data should work for all.\n. Shukran!\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. The crowd sourced restriction server will report No restrictions available\" now, if none of the restrictions is reliable.\nIs this a good enough solution for this issue?\n. For reference: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/commit/610e829f691bf1087a55f25026557e4fb32eb5ac\n. Duplicate or extension to #1319 \n. Does this solve your problem?\nhttp://forum.faircode.eu/forums/topic/android-android-system/\n. Take a look at the usage data to maybe find which restriction is causing this.\n. Xposed logs are of no use to me.\nPlease enable XPrivacy debug logging in the XPrivacy settings and capture a logcat.\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support\nBefore doing any of this, install XPrivacy version 1.11, clear all settings, reboot and look again.\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ5\nI am pretty convinced this problem is caused by an XPrivacy restriction you enabled.\nMake sure the network category is not restricted for any vital service.\n. I have looked into the Xposed logs.\nThe errors are caused by another Xposed module.\nThis also means the problem might be caused by another Xposed module.\n. Disable the option Restrict dangerous functions to not check the red ones.\n. What is \"whitelist failure\" ?\n. Please send me your settings file and I will check.\n/data/data/biz.bokhorst.xprivacy/shared_prefs/biz.bokhorst.xprivacy.provider.settings.xml\n. Because I was not sure if they would stay yet.\nAbout the format tags: did you try if this works?\nI tried in the past and I had trouble with it, but maybe it is solved now.\nA general remark: changing English almost always requires changing all other translations as well. The format tags should be changed in all translations and setting a string to translatable means adding the string to the other translations as well. There is a script in the tools folder to add strings to all translations (this is boring work otherwise).\nAnyway, thanks for trying to help with this!\nCould you please update this pull request (it can't be merge at this moment) and add the three new untranslatable strings? msg_register, msg_registered and msg_migrated\n. But did you actually test this with XPrivacy?\n. We need a smart script to replace this in all translations\n. The format should not be changed from string (s) to number (d).\nSo,\n\"This text %s with this number %d\"\nshould be changed into\n\"This text %1$s with this number %2$d\"\n. This is not a bug, but a feature.\nSome people are unsure where to put the license file and this shows where it should go.\nAnyway, thanks for reporting.\n. Thanks!\n. Can someone of you send me a zip file of the folder\n/data/data/biz.bokhorst.xprivacy/shared_prefs\nYou can use this contact form:\nhttp://forum.faircode.eu/contact/\n. Never mind, I guess I have already found it.\nCan you please try if the migration in this version is correct: http://d-h.st/oNh\nSee what you get here, but I might add more later:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\n. Then please provide your settings file.\n/data/data/biz.bokhorst.xprivacy/shared_prefs/biz.bokhorst.xprivacy.provider.settings.xml\n. I think I have been looking in the wrong place.\nCan you please try this version: http://d-h.st/SYl\nHow did the migrate go with the last try?\nDid you had a nice progress notification?\n. Thanks for testing!\nEnjoy!\n. Thanks for the fix!\n. Duplicate of #1106\n. Just click on the number ...\n. I don't see the added value from privacy perspective.\nDoing this will still more or less tell where you are.\n. You can already set the IP for each application.\nLook into the settings menu of the application details view.\nIf you mean external IP: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ45\n. The whitelist has nothing to do with XPrivacy.\nThis is an Xposed message.\n. Please read again what is written here:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support\nDo not create issues without describing the exact steps to reproduce, without running the latest version of XPrivacy, without a logcat.\nIf something crashes and you don't provide a logcat, I cannot do anything.\n. This is not the place to report this.\nYou should use the forum for this:\nhttp://forum.faircode.eu/forums/forum/android/xprivacy/\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Shukran!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Usage data cannot be retrieved by any other application than XPrivacy itself.\nHowever, any application can call getRetriction on the privacy service and thus pollute the usage data.\nThere is no real security risk, but an application can hide what it is really using (by making all categories and functions appear as used in XPrivacy).\n. \"This worked fine until Android downloaded (automatically) an os update.\nThe update was restricted by the template.\"\nI don't understand this, XPrivacy only restrict applications not an \"os update\".\nWhat was exactly restricted that shouldn't be restricted?\n. Google Play Services is a system application and should not get the template applied.\n. Yes, there are submissions for system apps.\nSystem apps are never batch fetched, but can only be fetched manually one by one from the application details view.\n. Yes, restricting system application (all marked red for a reason) can lead to bootloops.\n. Provide a logcat of the bootloop and I might figure out the cause.\n. Please try again with the just released version 1.99.7.\n. I like to keep it as it is now, but thanks for trying to help!\n. Thanks for the update as usual!\n. First a question: did the migrate run and completed?\nYou can restore the restrictions by renaming the files with the suffix '.migrated' in the folder\n/data/data/biz.bokhorst.xprivacy/shared_prefs\nand by downgrading to a version before 1.99\n. Still I like to know what went wrong, else I cannot fix it.\nHow did you discover the restrictions were gone?\nDid you reboot?\n. The number of applications displayed is only affected by the filters, so are you sure filtering was not the problem?\nCould you please retry and capture a logcat of the migration process?\n. Then also wait longer for the icons to appear.\n. Scrolling performance is confirmed to be fixed in 1.99.9, so please give it another try.\n. Fixed in 1.99.9\n. Thanks for the translation update!\nI have manually merged it, because of a merge conflict.\n. I cannot reproduce it and I have no idea why this is happening :-(\n. Steps to reproduce would help.\n. Can you check again without using myphoneexplorer?\n. Can you please try if this version fixes the problem:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/releases/tag/1.99.37-3\nMake sure you restrict contacts/IccProvider (this is new)\n. Can you please try another time with this version:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/releases/\n. You may need to allow contacts/profile\n. Can you give it another go with 1.99.37-6+\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/releases\nI rewrote most of the contact allowing now.\n. You can also update to 1.99.38 from the Xposed repo and have some more functions ;-)\n. Yes, try the latest version, please.\n. \"checked all checkboxes under Contacts for Whatsapp\"\nTry without restricting the dangerous functions.\n. There is little more I can do here, because these are limitations of the contact provider.\nIt is not possible to get a (raw) contact ID in all circumstances.\nI will leave this issue open, but marked as lowprio.\n. If you provide a logcat of the FC, I will look into it.\n. Reported to have been fixed.\n. @JayjohnX maybe it is an idea to document this here for easy reference:\nhttp://forum.faircode.eu/forums/forum/android/xprivacy/applications/\n. @Ano11 \nI have no idea about how to fix this.\nContact handling on Android is quite complex and there seems to be some interaction between Android, Whatsapp and XPrivacy. Whatsapp is probably maintaining its own contact group, which Android probably is merging with the main contact list.\nRestricting contacts is done using the contact IDs and it seems that these are in your case changing after reboot.\n. So, it looks like this was an Android problem after all.\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. That's fast!\n. The subscriber ID is now randomized as 001 + 12 random digits.\nWhat is your proposal for a better randomization scheme?\nMCC = 001, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_country_code\nMNC, see http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCC/MNC\n. Also, another feature that would be interesting (but may already exist) is the ability to randomize location around a point. That way I could have a fixed location that slightly changes which I would do on boot.\nThis is not necessary, since the set or randomized location is used as base point.\nThe actually location is a randomized offset from the base point, using the accuracy of the real position.\nI think this is better than what you want ;-)\n. The second randomization is independent of how the base location was set in the first place, manual or randomized.\nThe base location differs from the location fed to an application.\n. It is clear to me what you want and since you have created an issue here I won't forget it :-)\n. The new feature, does not completely resolve your issue, so I reopen this issue.\n. I am closing this issue, since I believe what you want can be done now.\n. Same as reported on the XDA forum:\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=49772070#post49772070\n@JKPO can you please capture a logcat?\n. Logcat provided on XDA: http://pastebin.com/TA7XiQri\nIf possible I like to see more logcats of this issue.\n. I guess this is solved in 1.99.13 or .14\n. Actually this was on my to do list, I wish I had done it earlier now :-(\n. @wbedard I intent to have this only in experimental/test/beta version, not stable versions.\nIs that okay with you?\n. My own try (not working): http://pastebin.com/g6DJtidu\nInspiration from here: https://github.com/LegacyXperia/android_device_semc_msm7x30-common/blob/cm-10.2/combinedroot/init.sh#L59\nThis is how Xposed will do it: https://github.com/rovo89/Xposed/blob/safemode/xposed_safemode.cpp\nI am not persuading this further, since a future version of Xposed will offer this option.\n. Thanks for the Slovak translation update!\n. This problem should be fixed in version 1.99.12+\n. This is a good find!\nThe problem was caused be recent code refactoring.\n. @an0n981 can you please try if this version does fix the problem: http://d-h.st/rKf\nThanks for all your bug reports!\nIs the issue with the database inconsistencies solved now?\nIsn't the new database fun? ;-)\n. There is one other thing to fix/improve:\n\"saving an empty fake value will result in using the empty value, instead of the global value\"\n. @an0n981 could you please test this version: http://d-h.st/yMy\nNULL settings values are not stored into the database anymore and existing NULL values will be deleted from the database on reboot after installing this version.\nEmpty application settings in the dialog are deleted from the database, so the global setting will be used (if any).\nThis allows for a mix between specific (setting value set in the application settings dialog) and global settings (value not set in the application settings dialog).\n. Thanks for testing!\nThis saves some data, which is good for performance.\n. Indeed, defining the version number from for the functions is not enough, the upgrade process should be run after the migrate to set it right.\nThis should be fixed in this version: http://d-h.st/nGX\nI would be grateful if you test it and let me know if it is really fixed now.\n. Thank your very much for testing and reporting back!\n. Which app did you try to restrict?\nPlease note that you need to explicitly enable restriction of system components in the latest versions.\n. Can you please enable XPrivacy debugging and provide a logcat?\nPlease note that I need to see a logcat from device start, so run 'adb logcat >log.txt' on your PC before powering up your device.\n. What is the UID of the application?\n(you can see this in the application details view of XPrivacy, it is mostly a 5 digits number)\n. I have already found out in the logcat: 10098\n01-26 21:58:42.747 I/XPrivacy( 4886): get 10198/%cid identification=!restricted 35 ms\n01-26 21:58:42.777 I/XPrivacy( 4886): get 10198/%hostname identification=!restricted 38 ms\n01-26 21:58:42.787 I/XPrivacy( 4886): get 10198/%imei identification=!restricted 4 ms\n01-26 21:58:42.787 I/XPrivacy( 4886): get 10198/%macaddr identification=!restricted 4 ms\n01-26 21:58:42.817 I/XPrivacy( 4886): get 10198/%serialno identification=!restricted 30 ms\n01-26 21:58:43.098 I/XPrivacy( 4886): get 10198//proc identification=!restricted 277 ms\n01-26 21:58:43.128 I/XPrivacy( 4886): get 10198//sys/block/.../cid identification=!restricted 30 ms\n01-26 21:58:43.168 I/XPrivacy( 4886): get 10198//sys/class/.../cid identification=!restricted 41 ms\n01-26 21:58:43.178 I/XPrivacy( 4886): get 10198//system/build.prop identification=!restricted 4 ms\n01-26 21:58:43.178 I/XPrivacy( 4886): get 10198/AdvertisingId identification=!restricted 6 ms\n01-26 21:58:43.188 I/XPrivacy( 4886): get 10198/GservicesProvider identification=!restricted 4 ms\n01-26 21:58:43.188 I/XPrivacy( 4886): get 10198/SERIAL identification=!restricted 4 ms\n01-26 21:58:43.198 I/XPrivacy( 4886): get 10198/getDescriptor identification=!restricted 4 ms\n01-26 21:58:43.198 I/XPrivacy( 4886): get 10198/getString identification=!restricted 4 ms\n01-26 21:58:49.814 I/XPrivacy( 4886): get 10198/null identification=restricted 20 ms\n01-26 21:58:50.245 I/XPrivacy( 4886): get 10198/null identification=restricted\n01-26 21:58:50.475 I/XPrivacy( 4886): get 10198/null identification=restricted\n01-26 21:58:50.695 I/XPrivacy( 4886): get 10198/null identification=restricted 2 ms\nBasically it works, but not everything is restricted yet.\nRestrict all categories and drill down all categories in the application details view (tap the icon in the main list) and restrict all dangerous functions.\n.

Restriction settings are cached for 15 seconds, so that might be the problem.\n. Possibly the same as #1164 and #1168 \nI will release a new version very soon, could you please try if this issue is solved?\n. A new version is available now:\nhttp://repo.xposed.info/module/biz.bokhorst.xprivacy\n. Thanks for reporting back!\n. Although I don't support the combo XPrivacy with LBE, I like to know what the cause of this problem is.\nThis is why I have labelled this issue as question.\nAs @jpeg729 says, without logcat there is little that can be done.\n. Is there still a problem with version 1.99.14 ?\nIf LBE has an option to \"fix\" permissions, try to disable it.\nSee also here: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#compatibility\n. Where can I download the LBE version you are using, so I can try myself?\n. I cannot operate the Chinese version of LBE security you linked.\nIs there an English version available (of the same version).\n. I have looked into this briefly:\n- It seems LBE tries to load /data/data/com.lbe.security/app_hips/libclient.so into each application, including Android\n- With XPrivacy enabled this native library crashes and takes down all system components and applications in the process\n- The crash is on an access violation (SEGV_ACCERR), but I have no idea why\nI/DEBUG   (  180): pid: 909, tid: 2013, name: ndroid.systemui  >>> com.android.systemui <<<\nI/DEBUG   (  180): signal 11 (SIGSEGV), code 2 (SEGV_ACCERR), fault addr 73125498\nD/dalvikvm( 1532): Trying to load lib /data/data/com.lbe.security/app_hips/libclient.so 0x428de568\nD/dalvikvm( 1552): Trying to load lib /data/data/com.lbe.security/app_hips/libclient.so 0x4291ef60\nD/dalvikvm( 1611): Trying to load lib /data/data/com.lbe.security/app_hips/libclient.so 0x4290dba0\nD/dalvikvm( 1582): Trying to load lib /data/data/com.lbe.security/app_hips/libclient.so 0x428fedf0\nD/dalvikvm( 1582): Added shared lib /data/data/com.lbe.security/app_hips/libclient.so 0x428fedf0\nD/dalvikvm( 1552): Added shared lib /data/data/com.lbe.security/app_hips/libclient.so 0x4291ef60\nD/dalvikvm( 1611): Added shared lib /data/data/com.lbe.security/app_hips/libclient.so 0x4290dba0\nD/dalvikvm( 1532): Added shared lib /data/data/com.lbe.security/app_hips/libclient.so 0x428de568\nD/dalvikvm( 1710): Trying to load lib /data/data/com.lbe.security/app_hips/libclient.so 0x42968210\nD/dalvikvm( 1710): Added shared lib /data/data/com.lbe.security/app_hips/libclient.so 0x42968210\nI/ActivityManager(  824): Start proc com.google.android.talk for broadcast com.google.android.talk/com.google.android.apps.babel.service.BootReceiver: pid=2035 uid=10052 gids={50052, 3003, 1028, 1015, 3002}\nI/ActivityManager(  824): Killing 1532:com.android.providers.calendar/u0a1 (adj 15): empty #17\nF/libc    ( 1223): Fatal signal 11 (SIGSEGV) at 0x73125498 (code=2), thread 2019 (e.process.gapps)\n. Same fix as #1164 \nNext release will have this fix.\n. The database can be backed up again in the latest version.\nRead here about the details: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=49799507&postcount=6251\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. No, as long as the database structure stays the same, you can do this.\nThe XPrivacy UI does nothing more than updating the database too.\n. If something should be a feature of XPrivacy, please create an issue.\nBut if it is a custom feature for you, enjoy your scripting!\n. You should translate the German texts, not the linked English texts.\nI will update the contributing section with this, since this is an often made mistake.\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. You cannot restrict /proc for Android, because it will result in bootloops.\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#limitations\n. There should be no entry in the usage table at all.\n. I don't have this entry.\nIs this a recent entry?\nThere is an explicit test here for Zygote and Android:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XIoBridge.java#L42\nSo, I see no obvious reason why this can happen.\n. Delete the entry from the database and see if it comes back later is my suggestion.\n. You can even ask more questions ;-)\nMaybe it is an idea to chat now and then.\nSend me a PM if you want this and I will send you my GTalk address.\nThe state field determines the color of the small bar on the left side of the application list (needs attention, etc).\nI will close this issue now, okay?\n. I have installed Elixir2, but can't find what you mean.\nWhich menu's (in English) should I use to get this screen?\n. Perfection is good!\n. The most common problem is that the XPrivacy file permissions have been changed by a file permissions \"fixing\" script or app. See \"compatibility\" for more information.\nDoes this affect the global settings only?\n. Thanks!\n. How would you propose to handle the height, given that it should be as realistic as possible to an application?\nThe satellite information can be withhold by restricting addNmeaListener.\n. I will look into the satellite info.\nThe average height of all land mass seems to be 686 meters. My proposal is to use this for the set height and use the accuracy to randomize it a bit.\n. I want to have as little as possible settings, that is why.\n. There are two reasons:\n- UI components require more maintenance\n- I like to keep XPrivacy simple to use\nI am not only developing XPrivacy, but I will also maintain XPrivacy and I am trying to prevent to add an endless number of features, which will make maintenance more difficult.\nThe users in the XDA forum, like yourself, are not the average user. There are thousands of novice users who are easily overwhelmed with fearures that are not highly relevant to their privacy.\n. This will be added to the next version.\n. Yes, of course, sometimes I forget that: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/commit/4749749a7c758abbef8cac1ab54bb483c5d91ad9\nNote that my philosophy is the opposite: only display problems and don't bother the user with things that are okay. XPrivacy has a series of internal checks and the user will be notified when something is wrong.\nIf you like we can chat now and than, sometimes that is easier than writing into issues.\nIf you like that, please send me a PM and I will reply with my GTalk address.\n. XPrivacy will warn if it is disabled and if an incompatible app is detected.\nIs that good enough?\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. I agree with this, so I have updated it.\nThanks for this suggestion!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Fast scroll was removed, beause a lot of people complained about accidentally checking restrictions.\n. I like to keep to number of option to a minimum.\n. Thanks again!\n. Thanks for the update as always!\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. I need a logcat to find the cause of this issue.\nVery few people complain about bootloops anymore fortunately.\n. @SecUpwN \n\"I don't get why Xprivacy can cripple my ROM that hard..\"\nXPrivacy hooks very deep into Android, even before Android runs.\nI have had a lot of bootloops while developing XPrivacy, but I can almost always find out why it occurs using the logcat. A notable exception to this is LBE, because it uses non open sourced native code.\nSo, your goal should be to get a logcat somehow.\n. The IPC functions where before dangerous, but not anymore.\nI have to chose here between losing your maybe carefully set functions exception by toggle the restriction category or clearing/setting the function exceptions by toggling the restriction category. Both have advantages and disadvantages. For now I have chosen to do the first.\n. Another more transparent solution than a long click would be a choice, like the template, which pops up when selecting 'Clear' in the application details view menu. This can replace the current 'Are you sure' dialog.\n@jpeg729 also for this a pull request would be very welcome, but take your time.\n. That is perfectly fine with me.\n. I have just requested access to the log file on dropbox ...\n. As @Cerberus-tm said, you need to restrict getScanResults for most Google applications to restrict location access.\n. The logcat has just one line with XPrivacy.\nWhich version of XPrivacy are you using?\nDid you check this forum?\nhttp://forum.faircode.eu/forums/topic/com-google-android-apps-maps-how-to-restrict-locations/\n. I do not really understand why you can get the mcc/mnc this way, but I will restrict it:\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/res/Configuration.html\n. getConfiguration:\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/res/Resources.html#getConfiguration()\nonConfigurationChanged:\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ComponentCallbacks.html\n. Unfortunately this cannot be fixed due the architecture of Android (and XPrivacy).\nGrouped applications share properties.\n. I see your point and I will look into it.\n. This will be fixed in the next release\n. Thanks again for the translation update!\n. I will make easy Tasker integration possible.\nThe database can be backed up safely, if you turn off usage data.\n. @SecUpwN \nI think it is a little bit silly to write a custom backup solution, while there exist tools for this.\nI rather spent my time adding new restrictions, which is the core function of XPrivacy.\n. Version 1.99.25 has support for automated backups fixed.\nSee the changelog for details.\n. Ask the authors of LBE to open their sources and I might fix this.\n. Duplicate of #1167 \nI have looked into it again, because I had an idea and next version will be compatible with LBE again, except that you will not be able to restrict Android itself.\n. Please enable debug logging in the XPrivacy settings and capture a logcat.\n. Thanks for the update as usual!\n. The question for me is if this is a bug or a feature.\n. Please enable debug logging in the XPrivacy settings and capture a logcat.\n. I don't see anything unusual in the logcat you have sent me.\nThis problem is mostly caused by restricting the View category, especially android.intent.action.VIEW.\n. Did you try clearing XPrivacy data?\nThis will tell if there is a restriction or a bug in XPrivacy is causing this.\nMy best guess it is a restriction.\nYou might look into the usage data to find out which one.\n. You can make a backup and restore, but see the FAQ first for how too.\nTo be safe, also export XPrivacy settings.\n. Maybe it is a firewall or add blocker app which prevents the document from opening.\n. Please enable debug logging in the XPrivacy settings and capture a logcat.\n. Maybe this works instead of NoDisplay: Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar\n. Else maybe a custom theme like this:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/11824199/nodisplay-activity-sometimes-shows-as-empty-activity\n. I agree that the only structural solution is to make an intent service for this.\n. Merging with #1218 \n. For what reason do you need this?\n. I am not so worried about the export.\nXPrivacy is not \"security by obscurity\".\nThe settings page is another story, since there values can be changed.\n. Thinking about it again, opening app settings can already be done with an intent:\nbiz.bokhorst.xprivacy.ActivityApp\nwith as extras:\n- Uid = ...\n- Action = 2 (=settings)\n  (case sensitive)\nWhen sending no action extra, the restrictions will be show.\nAction = 1 will ask for clearing restrictions.\nI do not guarantee the intent won't be renamed in the future, but currently there are no plans for that.\n. It is:\n<activity\n            android:name=\".ActivityApp\"\nElse it couldn't be launched from a notification.\n. It seems @jpeg729 was right, activities are not exported by default.\nI have added an intent filter and tested it and it will work in the next version.\nThis is the intent you want to send:\nadb shell am start -a biz.bokhorst.xprivacy.action.APPLICATION --ei Uid 10123 --ei Action 2\n. Please read this:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support\n10123 is just an example and will be a different app on each device.\n. As explained in the earlier referenced link, GitHub is not meant for questions.\n. This is a good change, not only because it fixes a problem, but also because it separates two different kind of logics (restriction management and restart state management).\nThanks.\n. Could to please rebase this change onto the latest changes?\n. The problem is that there is no quick check, since the service can only be reached by a relative expensive inter process call.\nI also like to avoid too much logic in the service, only what really needs to be done. Where possible the client side should do the processing.\n. I think it is a good idea to have an issue for discussion on on demand restricting, else I am afraid idea's on XDA might get lost, so I have changed the title of this issue.\n. From Mekanikz @ XDA:\n\"Just installed 1.99.23 and while I like the idea of the new pop up option, selecting allow enables everything under the category. Can you please make it to be more specific and list the specific info the app is trying to access and allow us to allow or deny just that one option under the category?\"\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=49940547&postcount=6485\n. From banderos101 @ XDA:\n\"how about a reboot, instead of restricting a whole category, or even all restrictions, what do you think about, starting with a limited number of restrictions \"on demand\" will listen for, say 20 of the communities most wanted individual restrictions, or the ones that can be implemented, programing wise, start off small, focus on user apps first, to limit any conflicts with system, until you get to know the on demand feature better, code and implementation wise, hopefully bugs for on demand will be better to manage with only 20 monitored restrictions, narrows down the possible issues maybe, the idea being, is to get a stable version a base version of on demand, that you can then step back and see where you could expand, without issue or performance, your special sauce\n(i restrict many \"ENTIRE\" categories, the old fashioned xprivacy way(check/blank), for a very large majority of my user/system apps, so in essence, i reduce considerably the amount of restrictions that need to be monitored, and there are quite a few categories that i can restrict in many apps and have no major issues i.e. bookmarks, calendar, calling, contacts, email, media etc etc)\nmaybe the community can help you here on xda, by listing the ones they most want, ones that can actually be implemeted offcourse, and if we end up getting certain restrictions being mentioned over and over, then it makes the list of restrictions, on demand will monitor and ask for.....assuming xprivacy is setup to do this without headache, which i fear we are giving you marcel\nso for example, my top nominations would be, as an example, i know some of these probably cant be \"on demanded\"\n1.su\n2.location \n(temporary allow true location, when using navigation app)\n3.internet/network (this can actually be the entire category i think)\n(temporary allow when you want to use an apps built in update feature, but deny when you just want check an apps offline feature, or those times when you might download a game, that requires internet the first time you open it, in order to download the rest of the game, you allow temporary, let the game download the files, and the next time you open it, if it asks for internet, assuming you have all the files, you can then go ahead and permanetly deny)\n4.getinstalledapplications and getIntalledPackages\n(these get used often, i believe this is the one that allows apps to view which apps you have intalled, when you try to open a txt file, music file, movie, photo, you then get the option of which app to choose to open that file, if its denied, you get a blank list)\n5.query.intent.activities\n(cant rember what this one was for, i might be mixing it with the above)\n6.getrunningAppProcess and getRunningServices\n(this is more a selfish choice, as i can see, it looks like greenify relies on these restrictions, and i have a feeling that many future apps, the ones im interested in, will have the same need for these)\n7.mic\n(temporariry allow recorder app or music recognition app, doubling as a \"warning system\" for when these apps might be trying to access without the app being user initiated, plus your not blankly allowing access always, literary, \"on demand\".......shoot, i just got it \n8.camera\n(temporary allow camera app, or social app, also \"warning system\")\n9.Storage\n(i think this is one of those you cant, but i put it here, in hopes to better get my meaning accross......temp allow storage when you want to use an import/export feature of an app, but in general dont want the app to have storage access unless you have started that app specifically for that use), not implying anything, just the one that came to mind, in order to try and explain my thinking\n10.a mention for shell restriction\n(limited knowledge on these, not enough to give example, but i get the feeling these are very powerfull control restrictions)\n11.copy and paste access\n(instead of automatic allow if unchecked as with older versions of xprivacy, how about only when needed by temp allow using on\ndemand)\n12.contact/data\n(this one because i would like to be informed if an app i just downloaded that i didnt expect to be asking for this, a warning system)\nive just realised, that we all probably have different needs, it probably would be better if you just gave folks the opportunity to pick themselves which 20 apps, an ask option next to all restrictions that you deem safe and and feasable, having a counter limit of 20, or another number, higher/lower, although i suspect that will negate the whole idea of limiting the amount of restrictions to 20 to narrow down bugs, as you now would have potentially a multitude of different users restricting 20 different things.......maybe writing code in xprivacy to \"submit list of on demand restrictions\" might help here\nanyway, sorry marcel, i cant help but feel i write to much, no expectations here, if i can help with suggestions, cool, if i am writing nonsense, then i \"on demand\" you to ignore \nHell, you might have already fixed/streamlined things, or have your own ideas, if so, then they should take precedent\nedit\nim not sure if the \"15 sec\" deny restriction was from what i said, or if im just being egotistical, if i am not, then i probably should clarify, \nThe idea was to put a timer, like the one \"superSu\" uses, that when a \"on demand\" pop appears, so does a 15 second timer with it, and if no user input is made by that time, the \"on demand\" will automatically deny, but the \"on demand\" monitor will reset itself when app is forced closed and ask again upon restart of app\nAnyway, i should probably shut it now, i really gotta bleeming update already, this thread is preventing me from doing a nand backup, cant tear myself away\"\n\"I chose a random app \"streamables\" on the playstore to quickly test \"on demand\", but when i open streamables, it ends up force closing, and there is no popup, i double checked to see, what some one here mentioned, that on demand was enabled for new installed apps, and confirmed there is a tick. I have sneaky suspicion i might be restricting something, ill have to look at somepoint.\nOne other thing about streamables, normally, when i install a new app, i have xprivacy settings restrict everything, and then start that app, in order to straightaway populate that apps data usage, see what i can see, but thats beside the point, .......normally, in previous versions of xprivacy, when this happens, when the app force crashes, thats it, it doesnt start, now, i dont know if this is a bug, or whether xprivacy doesnt have this restriction capability, but when i start streamables, it force crashes within 5-9 seconds, heres the thing, a couple of seconds after that, i get a notification on the, well, notification, even though notification category for streamables is restricted, but thats not my main concern, is the fact that streamables gives a notification \"streamables in service\", my question would be does xprivacy have the capability to deny services an app might initiatr, and if not, is it technically possible\"\n. It also came to my mind that when on demand is enabled, the template shouldn't be applied.\n. Actually there will be an on demand dialog in these cases, I have tested it.\n. \"The choice between the function & the category\"\nTo restrict a function, the category needs to be restricted.\nActually there are no function restrictions, but function exceptions.\nThe logic could be:\n- category restricted: enable function exception\n- category not restricted: restrict category, make exceptions for all other functions (taking dangerous functions into account)\n. There is one other thing that should be taken into account, which is quite important: checking for on demand or not should be limited as far as possible, because it will affect performance. That is why I let on demand only kick in when there wasn't a restriction.\n. Did you try to restrict Google Play Services like this:\n- getAllCellInfo\n- getNeighboringCellInfo\n- getCellLocation\n- getScanResults\nI have just tried and this works fine.\n. @banderos101 it is on demand restricting, so at the moment an application uses a function that is not yet restricted, there will be a popup (if enabled).\n. You are not the only one, we are still exploring this new feature.\n. What is left of the wishes after the today releases?\n. @jpeg729 this seems pretty okay to me.\n. Instead of \"(dangerous)\" I propose the reddish background color.\n. Without doubt the background color, you'll see.\n. I am closing this issue now, since IMHO the on demand restricting is working as most expect now.\n. Thanks for the update as always!\n. Please read this: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ45\n. The FAQ was renumbered some time ago.\n. XPrivacy really looks at these locations only:\n/data/data/biz.bokhorst.xprivacy/xprivacy.db(-journal) the old location to move files from\n/data/xprivact/xprivacy.db(-journal) to new location to move files to / use files\nSo, I don't see a relation to the folder/files you described.\nSomething else should have caused this.\n. Which version of XPrivacy are you running?\n. Can you please try this version: http://d-h.st/2ON\nIf it still doesn't work, please delete these files:\n/data/data/biz.bokhorst.xprivacy/xprivacy.db\n/data/xprivacy/xprivacy.db\nand reboot try again.\nIf it still doesn't work, please try this version: http://d-h.st/W2W\nbut be aware you will be unprotected until the migration is done.\n. If the second version worked, there was most probaly an existing restriction causing this.\n. Can you try to press ok and either send me the support info or post the contents of the e-mail here?\n. Normally it would create a concept message in your favorite e-mail program or anything else that can handle an e-mail.\n. Can you please try to capture a logcat as an alternative?\nYou should start capturing from your PC with\nadb logcat >log.txt\nbefore you turn on your device.\nYou need the Android SDK for this.\n. If the message is gone, then the problem is solved.\nThe message was probably from the moment before changing the file permissions, correct?\n. Then it is safe to assume this is not a big problem.\n. Yes, I hope the database is in the right place now!\nUnfortunately at boot moment it is not possible to get the uid of XPrivacy, which is needed to set the groupid.\n. The permission can only be set at one point of time, because it requires root privileges and that is during early boot. At this stage the package manager is not running, so it is not possible to get the uid of XPrivacy. The ownerid/groupid is technically the same as the uid. The system uid is a \"well known\" uid (mostly 1000) and can be set during early boot.\nI also see this as a remainder of the beta versions.\nSince the database is hopefully in its definitive place, the app folder permissions won't be modified anymore (and thus don't need to be modified back again).\nMoreover, this permission is a safe permission, because other apps are never member of the system group and can thus not access the XPrivacy files (currently only the license file, the rest is obsolete after migration).\n. Is XPrivacy working for you, except for submitting restrictions?\n. Can you please forward the e-mails with the activation links?\nYou can send it to marcel+xprivacy ... faircode.eu\nI guess you know how to make a valid e-mail address of this ;-)\n. I go your e-mail and I checked and your device was not activated.\nAfter following the link, the device was activated.\nCan you please try to submit again and lit me know if it works now?\n. There is a special view for that: usage data.\nYou can access it both from the main and application settings.\n. You are not the first one to ask, but this is standard Android behavior.\nIt is designed for usability of left handed persons and tablets.\n. I don't see how XPrivacy could cause this.\nWhich version of XPrivacy are you using?\n. I have tested with 1.99.24 and it works for me.\n. I have just tested with 1.99.25 too and it works for me.\nPlease provide a logcat.\n. Are you sure LBE is causing the problem?\nTry to clear all data (there is a new menu option for that in 1.99.25).\n. You can help me with a logcat captured from your PC. You need to start capturing before turning your phone on.\nWhat does that mean \"Beijing 4:12\" ?\n. Can you please try again with this version: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=49979466&postcount=6550\n. I have requested access to the document ...\n. LBE is crashing, maybe you can ask for support to the LBE authors.\n. Can you try if it is better with version 1.99.28?\n. @xzhlksh English please.\n. @nanhir English please\n. @nanhir English please\n. Any news from the LBE developers?\n. No idea why it works now, but if it works it works.\nThe browser provider issue will be solved in the next release.\n. @nanhir do you mean you still have a boot problem, or that you have the support info popup?\n. - I don't see what ART support has to do with this\n- I want to help, but the initiative has to come from LBE, since there is no way to know what is going on, because LBE is closed source. Also LBE seems to have admitted now that the problem is caused by LBE.\n. http://forum.faircode.eu/contact/\n. I have never heard anything back about this.\n. Looking at the code I see this was a lot of work, so a big thanks!\n. Isn't this caused by:\nif (!result.asked)\n        result.asked = ((state & 2) != 0);\n. I have no idea yet.\nI have fixed the 'usage' flag, maybe that helps.\n. Probably because the usage flag was not right.\n. @Jimmy34742 to answer your question on XDA: XPrivacy fakes things for applications, but Pry-Fi also fakes things for the outside. I have either to research how to do this or get this information from @Chainfire (I will ask him). I don't know if it is possible to do this from Java, but maybe hooking into the supplicant can make this happen.\n.

Assuming you are running the latest version of XPrivacy, version 1.99.28, this is probably the same issue as #1238 \n. Else leave another comment here.\n. My proposal is to move the filters to a popup that appears when tapping a new filter icon on the action bar (just like sort). The category selector could be visible at the top of the window all the time, with below it the search field for the application name.\n@jpeg729 a pull request would be very welcome ...\n. The action bar symbols should be added to the help page.\nWhich apply to any long press too (currently only for selecting).\n. This will be improved in the next version.\n. Please let me know if this issue is fixed in version 1.99.30\n. @an0n981  Thanks for reporting back!\n. This should be fixed in the next release.\n. The next version will have rewritten on demand logic, so try again.\n. Yes, you can, and if you have restrict dangerous enabled it will be unchecked by default in the next release.\n. I think this is more confusing, especially for new users, so I am not a fan of the proposal.\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. The next version will have rewritten on demand logic, so try again.\n. The application list view will be significantly slimmed down in the next release.\n. Slimming down the application is not possible, since the version/package name is a scroll-able.\n. There restrictions are in the accounts category.\n. I see what you want, but I don't know if this is possible/workable.\n. The solution for this is to add a fake account and allow only this account.\n. Thanks for this big translation update!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. I have added a few more parameters to the next release, all that seemed useful to me.\n. Can you please explain in more detail what is going wrong?\n. I have just tested export and import and nothing is wrong with it.\nMaybe you did import earlier than Android notified XPrivacy of the new application.\n. No problem\n. Thanks again!\n. You can send it to marcel+xprivacy ... faircode.eu\nI guess you know how to make a valid e-mail address from this ;-)\nPlease post here the Android version you are using.\n. Just replace ... by @ and stitch everything together ...\n. Received, I will look at it tomorrow.\n. Did you ever see an on demand dialog?\n. Try the latest test release instead: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=50098246&postcount=6784\n. Maybe I miss something, but I don't see the need for this exception:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/PrivacyService.java#L986\n. I guess we have come to more or less the same conclusion!\nMaybe you can review the solution I committed early this morning: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/commit/ab77227971ef7313dc731357c363c2eb4d6e3062\n. Toggle restrictions will reset on demand ...\n. Install 1.99.33 and select category all and (set and) clear a check box will enable on demand restricting (if global on demand restricting is enabled in the main settings).\n. This function applies the template ...\n. I was wrong about applying the template, this will be changed in the next release.\nNot taking into account dangerous functions was a bug and will be fixed too in the next release.\n. Thanks, as usual!\n. You can check it out in this version: http://d-h.st/g8Z\nDo you have any advice on the text color for the number of filters?\n. Feel free to suggest improvement, you can use this issue if you like.\n. The filter icon size if okay IMHO.\n. Another test version with bold font (same size): http://d-h.st/4Kb\nYou can also see a new feature coming ;-)\n- Go to the application details view\n- Open the category account\n- Tap the \"i\"-icon for addOnAccountsUpdatedListener\n. Reported to be fixed in version 1.99.34\n. There could also be a performance problem, because it will probably called a lot of times.\nThe locale seems to be a property of the VM, maybe we can change it like SERIAL:\nhttp://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/root/jdk/openjdk/6-b27/java/util/Locale.java#Locale.getDefault%28%29\nI didn't look into this very detailed, but I guess it is just a system property (which already has a hook class).\n. The idea is good, but unhandled exceptions do not need to have been caused by XPrivacy.\nMaybe we can check the stack trace if XPrivacy is in the list, but this doesn't mean XPrivacy is the cause of the exception either.\n. Is my commit good enough to fix this problem?\n. https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/commit/4e4209c9864c5db1287330cedbbffb1f8ad951f3\n. Thank you very much @Jimmy34742  !\n@jpeg729 since you are native English speaker, could you please proof read this and merge it?\n. Thanks for the translation update as usual!\n. Thanks for the update as usual!\n. Muchas gracias!\n. This is a big mistake of me, despite I double checked this :-(\nThank for contributing!\nDo you already have a pro license?\n. Please send your full name to marcel+xprivacy ... faircode.eu and I will send you one.\nReplace ... by the at sign to make it an e-mail address.\n. @Jimmy34742 thank you very much for these contributions!\n. This is not possible, since the cell information only carries cell ID's, not a location.\nGoogle has mapped the ID's to a location, but this information is not publicly available.\nYou can hide the cell information to applications by restricting functions in the location category.\n. There will be no filtering and templating on functions.\nThe function exception are to tune individual applications.\n. Performance wise it is unfeasible to filter on allowed accounts, applications and contacts.\nFiltering on fake data has as problem which data to evaluate.\nThis could lead to wrongly interpreted results.\nSo, I see nothing useful to implement for this issue.\n. I have trouble understanding what you exactly want.\nI guess you are speaking about on demand restricting. This is enabled by default for newly installed applications and disabled by default for already installed applications, to prevent an \"explosion\" of allow/deny questions, which could in the end lead to a reboot.\nYou can globally enable/disable on demand restricting in the main settings and do the same for each application individually.\n. @banderos101 although the idea is nice, I am afraid this will confuse/scare novice users.\nYou have to enabled both the global and application specific 'Ask on demand' option.\n. Three states is not enough: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/issues/1296\n. If you want to modify the restrictions manually maybe.\n. Turning off can simply be done by answering the dialog.\nUnless there are good reasons to change this, I like to keep it as simple as it is.\n. The current implementation is indeed designed as an alternative to manually restricting.\nAn implementation for both approaches would probably make the code more complex.\nKnow that it wasn't easy to get everything right in the current implementation.\n(which doesn't mean it won't change in the near future)\n. You can use the Xposed module appSettings to switch the language.\nYou can make a remark about the translation on the XDA forum.\nThere are several German translators.\n. Thanks, as always!\n. This is intended behavior. If you deny a function in an allowed category, all the functions in the category functions are denied, but still being asked for. Functions are exceptions to a category in the current implementation (this might change in the future), so there is no other correct way to do this.\n. Since quite some devices have internal storage limitations, it is not a good idea to store this information in the database, which is needed to display it later.\n. If it is not stored it cannot be polled either.\n. I have implemented a framework to persist and show the original values in test version 3.2.3. There is a proof of concept for Build.SERIAL. This feature needs to be turned on using the main settings and requires a pro license.\nI will not implement persisting and showing fake values, since this requires an additional call to the privacy service and would thus impact performance. Displaying the current fake value is not possible, since it might be randomized.\n. @nylimited fake values will not be shown\n. The option menu is not created when the privacy client is null, so I don't a reason for this check.\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. You can now update meta only ;-)\nIf you do, please look up the real minimum required SDK version in the official documentation.\n. This is not a good idea for device with a small screen.\n. Maybe we can add horizontal dividers.\n. Horizontal separator lines\n. If you like to make a mockup, please do so.\n. I theory yes, but it requires more work and we have already enough ...\n. Sometimes we need simple work too ;-)\nSo, check this out: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/releases/tag/1.99.37-2\n. Thanks for the translation update and writing about XPrivacy!\nI have added a link in the new section:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#news\n. See here why: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ20\n. I don't know exactly, but XPrivacy checks for presence of the geocoder using this function:\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Geocoder.html#isPresent()\nAlso this might be interesting:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/9075446/geocoders-ispresent-method-always-returns-false\n. Thanks for the corrections!\n. Do you mean the restart notification or restart window?\n. Do you have LBE installed?\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. @jpeg729 can you take care if this pull request?\n@Phylon 4.0.3 is the correct version, but it is not very important, since there are very few 4.0 users.\n. Thanks for the translation update as usual!\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. The early versions of XPrivacy had no application list, but a button in the Android application settings page. This has been removed and one of the reasons is that the application settings page is often customized by the manufacturer. Adding a button to an unknown layout will inevitable break things. So, this cannot be done.\n. The translation is okay, thanks!\n. What do you mean exactly with \"inspecting\"?\n. Long press on a selected app currently exits multi select mode.\n. It appears there is always something more to wish for, but indeed this would be a nice improvement. Also the category name needs to be displayed, since the \"toggle\" can work on an individual category. I interpret \"on-demand all\" as toggling asking for on-demand or not. Maybe the best way to implement this, is with a radio button group at the top of the batch view.\nAnother improvement in the same spirit would be clear restriction on fetch or not and modification of the confidence interval in a few steps.\n. https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/commit/6384d7ec70b47552d4654a0b8779969ab8057f6c\n. Can you give examples of applications?\n. I have white listed /proc/cpuinfo and /proc/meminfo, since these files do not contain privacy sensitive information.\nPlease let me know if anything else in /proc should be white listed.\n. You can white or black list any /proc file using on demand restricting now.\n. No, that is not possible. I have no solution for that and even I had it would be a headache to support the different flavors of the file.\n. Works for me, just tested.\nHow can I reproduce this problem?\n. It is unclear to me what you mean:\n\"I allowed three contacts (phone,sim,email one for each)\"\nwhat is that and what has that to do with the usage data?\n. This is probably caused by all the rewriting I did to get it working in all circumstances without creating thousands of aliases. Try the next version (coming soon) and comment again here if you still have the same problem.\n. functions, accounts, contacts, I am a little confused about what your problem is.\nI have checked the all code for allowing contacts and I don't see a problem.\n. XPrivacy does not touch allowed accounts and contacts on itself, So, I don't have an explanation for this at this moment.\n. I will keep all versions on GitHub from now on, except for pre-releases.\nThe old backup location let me down quite often and this looks much nicer.\nI won't add anything before 1.99.x, because I don't want to support older versions.\n(supporting the latest versions is already enough work)\n. Same as #1321 \nWorking on it.\n. I have added the function parameter to the usage data in the recent test version.\nI won't add original and faked data, because I am afraid the database will get to large.\n. I appreciate what you are trying to do, but I cannot merge any of the commits.\nI have added comments to all commits about why.\n. Eclipse is a little easier to use.\nIf you mean the margins of the action bar icons: I don't think this can be changed, but there seems to be an obscure function for everything in Android, so I am not quite sure of it.\nClear all data covers better what is being done, since it also clears settings and usage data (and maybe more in the future). Maybe 'Clear all XPrivacy data' ?\nPull requests are always welcome.\nIf you like we can chat now and then: send me an e-mail at marcel+xprivacy ... faircode.eu and I will send you my GTalk address. Replace the dots by an 'at' sign to make it a valid e-mail address.\n. It is already changed ;-)\n. 1. There is nothing that can be changed to that, the serial number is restricted before the VM starts. This function is marked as having no usage data for the same reason.\n2. You should check if the sensor is available and report to the user when it isn't.\n. Can you be a little more specific about the problem?\nMostly this means Xposed is not enabled or XPrivacy is not enabled in Xposed.\nOf course there can be other things wrong, but these are the common reasons.\n. Try turning XPrivacy off and on in the Xposed installer.\nI have to do this sometimes myself too.\nThen of course reboot to see effect.\nThe message is nothing to worry about.\n. I have never wiped dalvik/cache, but okay, if it is working, it is working.\n. This happens on every boot to fix permissions that permission \"fixing\" scripts and applications set wrong.\n. Thanks, this worked and it is a nice improvement!\n. I didn't even know this was possible.\nFor me it works okay, since I don't get 'XPrivacy' in the title.\nDo you have the same problem with all action bar icons?\n. Duplicate of or similar to #1119 \n. The folder name only appears if the license file was not found as a reminder where to put the license file. Often people are in doubt about the correct location and in this way I can easily point them to the correct location (which is device dependent).\n. Perfectionist? I like that ;-)\n. I have put them on different sides for two reasons:\n- The effect is different, one opens a browser window, one shows an information popup\n- The highlight the difference between categories and functions\n. Even though I set some issues to 'wontfix', it doesn't mean I don't appreciate the suggestions!\n. What I like is a more subtle \"i\"-icon to have less distraction.\n. A second \"i\" icon would be nice and was actually I was after.\nAn open book icon would be great.\n. No hurry, but a nice icon is very welcome.\n. Please send the icons to me through this contact form:\nhttp://forum.faircode.eu/contact/\n. Can you please provide a logcat?\n. https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ14\n. The (short) logcat does not contain useful information.\nI have check all the code for accidentally restricting this, without settings it, but I am quite sure this is not the case. So, either:\n- there must be some restriction visible in the XPrivacy usage data causing this\n- Poweramp checks for XPrivacy and refuses to work if it finds XPrivacy\n- There is a bug in the Poweramp licensing\nI am downgrading this issue from bug to question.\n. \"Is there a way to be sure Xprivacy reports the actual device info and not\nrandom to poweramp specifically?\"\nI have already checked XPrivacy for \"rogue\" restrictions and for bugs in the recent changes.\nMy best guess is that this is a problem in Poweramp or some restriction, maybe of a system or Google component that is causing this issue.\n. Can you post a link to the logcat?\n. Please post a new logcat with XPrivacy debugging enabled (main settings).\n. So, issue resolved?\n. Then please provide another logcat with XPrivacy debug logging enabled.\n. This could be the reason:\n02-14 09:01:43.195    8369-8369/com.maxmpz.audioplayer E/ActivityThread\ufe55 Activity com.maxmpz.audioplayer.dialogs.ExpiredActivity has leaked IntentReceiver pl.com.android.scalpel.inject.MainXposed$SettingsReceiver@429c4fc8 that was originally registered here.

Are you missing a call to unregisterReceiver()?\nBut this is not caused by XPrivacy.\n. Could you please try again with this version: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/releases/tag/1.99.43-2\nI like to see a new logcat, whether it works or not.\n. I thought we were talking about totally unrestricted:\nI/XPrivacy( 4113): Load package=com.maxmpz.audioplayer.unlock uid=10124\nI/XPrivacy( 4113): get 10124/SERIAL identification=restricted\nAs the reply of the Poweramp author pointed out the IDs should always be the same.\nSo, please try again without restricting the unlocker.\n. Maybe the template got applied while installing the unlocker (again) ?\n.

In an earlier provide log I found this message:\nW/PackageManager\ufe55 Couldn't delete native library directory /data/app-lib/com.maxmpz.audioplayer.unlock\nMaybe it is worth trying this:\n- Uninstall the unlocker\n- Uninstall Winamp\n- su\n- cd /\n- find | grep com.maxmpz.audioplayer\n- Delete any apk, lib files found\n- Reboot (just to be sure)\n- Install Winamp\n- Install unlocker\n. Just the install part of the unlocker, but with XPrivacy debug logging enabled.\n. Two more versions to try (thanks for your patience!):\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/releases/tag/1.99.43-3\nHas extra logging and I like to see a logcat of the unlock process again.\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/releases/tag/1.99.43-4\nHas content provider restrictions disabled, to see if this is the problem or not.\n. Does the -4 version work?\n. Thanks, that will reduce the scope to search within.\nTo be sure: -3 didn't work?\n. If I want to try this myself, what do I need?\nBoth these or just one of the two? Or maybe something else?\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maxmpz.audioplayer\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maxmpz.audioplayer.unlock\n. Hopefully I don't need to wait 15 days for the trial to expire ...\n. I have bought the Poweramp unlocker and with a few tests I determined that as soon as I hook this function:\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ContentProviderClient.html#query(android.net.Uri, java.lang.String[], java.lang.String, java.lang.String[], java.lang.String)\nand even with doing nothing in the hook (an empty function), the unlocker doesn't work anymore.\nThis means that Poweramp has some method to detect that this function has been hooked.\nSeen from the perfective of XPrivacy I cannot do much.\nThis hook is needed for a lot of restrictions.\nIt worked until version 1.99.39, because I hooked into another place.\nI don't want to change this back, because this method of hooking is better.\n. You are welcome.\nI did what I could, but I cannot fix this without giving up important features of XPrivacy.\n. The hook doesn't fail, else a whole lot of restrictions wouldn't work.\nMaybe it is similar to the LBE Security Master incompatibility, the Poweramp unlocker seems to use a native library to do or to aid the license verification process. The reason is probably that a native library is more difficult to reverse engineer. Maybe the native library interferes with Xposed, like LBE seems to do (although for LBE the problem is worse, because it takes down the whole system). This is just another theory, maybe the Poweramp developer found a way to check for hooks or something.\n. Normally I wouldn't and certainly not for a pro version of an app, but I suspected a problem in the rewritten content provider restrictions, which fortunately doesn't appear to be the case. This is good to know, so I can sleep again ;-)\n. There is no real need to hook native code, although that could bring some new features, but probably at the price of significant incompatibility issues (there is a lot of variation in library versions, Android versions and nowadays also in processor architectures).\nCydia is not an option for a privacy tool, since it is not open source. In theory Xposed is easy to replace by another framework, like Cydia. XPrivacy is prepared for such a change as far as that can be prepared (it would require rewriting a small portion of the XPrivacy code, but it would require a lot of test work).\n. The minimum code to reproduce this issue is:\n```\n            Class<?> cpc = findClass(\"android.content.ContentProviderClient\", null);\n            for (Method method : cpc.getDeclaredMethods())\n                if (method.getName().equals(\"query\")) {\n                    XposedBridge.hookMethod(method, new XC_MethodHook() {\n                        @Override\n                        protected void beforeHookedMethod(MethodHookParam param) throws Throwable {\n                        }\n                    @Override\n                    protected void afterHookedMethod(MethodHookParam param) throws Throwable {\n                    }\n                });\n            }\n\n```\n. Thanks for reporting, I will look into it.\n. Thanks for the simplified Chinese translation update!\n. Actually XPrivacy is on Crowdin, I created a project 8 months ago:\nhttps://crowdin.net/project/xprivacy\nI will look into Crowdin/GitHub intergration (how to easily pull translations).\n. Although I see the added value of Crowdin from the users perspective, I don't want another workflow. Pull requests or PMs are good enough to add/update new translations.\n. Thanks for updating, @Phylon !\nI will apply this after the stable version.\nDid you test this change?\n. @Phylon building is pretty easy.\nJust install Eclipse and import the project as described here:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#contributing\nIf you need help, it is just one question away.\n. ADT does check for the correct Java JDK version, so no worries.\nJust downloading the Android 4.2.2 SDK + API is enough.\n. Sorry, I see I made a typo: of course it should be the latest version.\nSo, 4.4.2 is good to go.\nIf you have the correct drivers installed, you should be able to directly run XPrivacy on your device from Eclipse now.\n. In principle each text with a format should be tested.\n. You could install 1.11 stable, set some restriction and then migrate this restriction by installing 1.99.x\n. Just once is enough ;-)\nYes, this is okay.\nIf you have GTalk (or hangouts): marcel ... faircode.eu\nReplace the dots by the at sign to get a valid address.\n. There is no tag for 1.11, so that is right. I have only recently started using tags.\nLeave it like it is, if you have done what you could, I will just release a test release after the next stable to get feedback. It isn't simply possible to test anything anyway.\n. I have decided not to merge this for all languages. Everything works okay and this change has the risk of breaking things.\nNevertheless this is a good change, so my proposal is to make a merge request for the default English texts only and to provide a script in the tools folder, so that each translator can run this when updating a translation (or I will do this after an update has been provided).\n. Yes, please\n. Thanks for the update, as usual.\n. I see your concern, but it seems like I am less worried about this than you.\nIt is not feasible to reverse the MD5 of the Android ID, let alone a lot of them, you will need a lot of computing power, and even if you could, it would be quite difficult to find the owner of the device.\nIt is also hard to change now, since this MD5 is the index to the submitted restrictions (to prevent multiple submit/votes).\n. They are salted, even device specific.\n. It seems you a right:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/Util.java#L436\nOnly sha1 is salted (the function above the md5 function).\n. Maybe we should add the device specific salt to improve this and accept that submission are possibly duplicated once.\n. Or maybe this is a chance to give loyal submittors a second vote ;-)\n. Duplicate or extension to #1319\n. There is now a check box in the application details view to easily turn on and off on demand restricting.\nAnything else should be done using batch operations, since I like to have as few as possible options.\nRefs #1319\n. I am not sure where the shortcut should be: launcher? notification? elsewhere?\n. In the next release there will be, see commit for the intent name.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. I don't understand what you want ...\n. AD=?\n. I was thinking of Active Directory and some more abbreviations, but not this.\nAll restrictions should be documented in the latest version, including the new ones.\nIf you miss something, please let me know.\n. Yes, you can.\n'asked' is stored as bit in the restrictions:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/PrivacyService.java#L328\n. Remember that the function restrictions are exceptions and work a little bit different, but I guess you know that.\n. Thanks!\n. There will be no second column of check boxes.\nThe goal is to keep the usage of XPrivacy simple.\nThere are quite some novice users, who would potentially confused with more options.\n. In the next version you will be able to freeze the Poweramp unlocker to prevent the popup from appearing.\n. Yes, but not the pro features.\n. Check the FAQ, question 49.\nIf none of the suggestions help, please capture a logcat as explained in question 14.\nPost a link to the logcat in this issue (use any service you like, pastebin, Google Drive, etc).\n. Although this is not a logcat, it tells me that XPrivacy was loaded:\nLoading class biz.bokhorst.xprivacy.XPrivacy\n. If you tell me the package name, I will tell you.\n. No, XPrivacy doesn't check for this module, but it tells me that it is likely that @Something2 has LBE Security Master installed. In which case this issue is completely explainable.\n. It is already documented in the compatibility section, which is being referred to from the installation instructions. The compatibility sections refers to the issue with all details. Is this okay?\n. @Something2 it is time to provide a logcat ...\n. Didn't you get a popup saying LBE is incompatible?\n. Could you please give me the download link of the LBE version you used? Or better the package name (visible in XPrivacy).\n. According to the log the restriction works:\n02-16 13:17:49.449 I/XPrivacy/XClipboardManager( 1902): get 10068/hasPrimaryClip clipboard=restricted 3 ms\nIsn't this the same issues as #857 ?\n. Which application is 10068 ?\n. I have just tested this and restricting paste works as expected. This is consistent with the logging provided. Note that copy and cut or not restricted.\n. It could easily be done, but I see no reason and it would only give confusion.\n. hasPrimaryClip is a crucial step in restricting pastes.\nI have checked and it is working for me and also for you, else there wasn't get 10068/hasPrimaryClip clipboard=restricted in the logcat.\n. As you describe it, it is supposed to work ...\n. Just run dsploit and look to the usage data. XPrivacy is to protect your privacy, so if some data leaks, please let me know what and I will try to fix it. XPrivacy is not there to prevent hacking, cracking, cloaking root, game cheating, etc.\n. I run XPrivacy mostly only for testing/debugging and Facebook, nothing else.\n. I think Android is quite secure already and it is getting better with SELinux in restrictive mode.\n. I don't see what this would add to all other restrictions. It should suffice to restrict personally identifiable information, do you think otherwise, and so yes, why?\n. Adding this feature is simple, but the  problem I have with this feature, is that it can be misused and that privacy is just served a little. \n. The reasoning is not that I don't want to add it just because it can be used in a malicious way, but that the minimal added privacy does not outweights that problem.\n. I am not convinced that the advantages outweighs the disadvantages, so I am closing this request.\n. What is the uid I have to look for?\n. And a link to the application would be easy for me ...\n. Before I go looking into this, could you please try to allow the contacts again? So first deny, then allow again.\n. I have installed Viber and allowing contacts worked for me. What I noticed however is that Viber gets Viber contacts that have you in their contact list from their server (did we agree to this?). You cannot block/allow Viber contacts.\n. For me it worked flawlessly, but I restricted and allowed some contacts before starting Viber.\nMaybe you were too late and the contacts are already stored in the local Viber database?\n. Whatsapp has a 'refresh' menu for this, but I don't know if Viber has something alike (I already uninstalled Viber, because I like to keep my device clean).\n. Thanks for reporting back on this.\n. I have tried long press for this, but it isn't transparent to use and since I see no other solution, except for toggling through different states of one checkbox, this is the next best solution. I have also been thinking about a swipe, but there is a risk somebody will enable/disable a restriction by accident.\n. There is little to find about the multi SIM feature in the source code.\nCan you please post the output of\nservice list\n. I also like to see a full logcat while using the SIM card app.\n. At least some things were restricted:\nI/XPrivacy/XTelephonyManager( 2958): get 10096/getPhoneType phone=restricted\nI/XPrivacy/XTelephonyManager( 2958): get 10096/getSimCountryIso phone=restricted 3 ms\nI/XPrivacy/XTelephonyManager( 2958): get 10096/getSimCountryIso phone=restricted (cached)\nI/XPrivacy/XTelephonyManager( 2958): get 10096/getSimOperator phone=restricted 4 ms\nI/XPrivacy/XTelephonyManager( 2958): get 10096/getSimOperator phone=restricted (cached)\nI/XPrivacy/XTelephonyManager( 2958): get 10096/getSimOperatorName phone=restricted 10 ms\nI/XPrivacy/XTelephonyManager( 2958): get 10096/getSimOperatorName phone=restricted (cached)\nI/XPrivacy/XTelephonyManager( 2958): get 10096/getNetworkCountryIso phone=restricted\nI/XPrivacy/XTelephonyManager( 2958): get 10096/getNetworkCountryIso phone=restricted (cached)\nI/XPrivacy/XTelephonyManager( 2958): get 10096/getNetworkOperator phone=restricted 3 ms\nI/XPrivacy/XTelephonyManager( 2958): get 10096/getNetworkOperator phone=restricted (cached)\nI/XPrivacy/XTelephonyManager( 2958): get 10096/getNetworkOperator phone=restricted (cached)\nI/XPrivacy/XTelephonyManager( 2958): get 10096/getNetworkOperator phone=restricted (cached)\nI/XPrivacy/XTelephonyManager( 2958): get 10096/getPhoneType phone=restricted (cached)\nI/XPrivacy/XTelephonyManager( 2958): get 10096/getNetworkOperatorName phone=restricted 2 ms\nI/XPrivacy/XTelephonyManager( 2958): get 10096/getNetworkOperatorName phone=restricted (cached)\nbut I don't understand why not all things.\n. The next version of XPrivacy will have some additional logging for this issue.\nIn the mean time I like to see the first 1000 lines of a logcat capture, started before you turn on your device, so I can check if all hooks were successful.\n. Version 1.99.47 has the extra logging.\n. With the help of @Tungstwenty we are a little bit closer to the source of the problem, but not yet to the solution of it. The problem seems to be hooking native functions, before the associated native library has been loaded, like this one:\npublic native java.lang.String android.telephony.MSimTelephonyManager.getSimSerialNumber(int)\n. Could you please check if this version solves the problem: http://d-h.st/9fk\n. You can instead better download this version:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/releases/tag/1.99.48\n. Is there anything changed compared to the previous version?\n. Too bad nothing changed :-(\n==>I/XPrivacy( 2816): get setting uid=10096 Application.de.hafas.android.db=false 63 ms\n==>I/XPrivacy( 2816): get setting uid=10096 Application.de.schildbach.oeffi=false 149 ms\nThe app tries to access application info, XPrivacy is checking here if the packages are on the allow list, which they aren't.\n. I have good hope this version will fix your problem: http://d-h.st/1gp\n. Thanks for reporting back!\n. Can you post a link to the app?\n. This application read the call log, which can be restricted, but for some reason it doesn't read my contacts at all.\n. Can you post a screenshot?\nStrike though whatever you like ;-)\n. I have the same, but it doesn't show contacts at the top, only call log (if I allow that).\nMaybe you need to restrict IPC for the contacts.\n. Can you capture a logcat with this test version:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/releases/tag/1.99.45-2\n. I have already found the problem, this is calling for a new restriction.\nRemark: reboot after installing the test version (I didn't increase version numbers, but the privacy service interface has been changed and the database will get a new column after rebooting, you will like that ;-) )\n. I have updated the 1.99.45-2 apk, you should be able to restrict \"people\" now.\n. Thanks for testing!\nFor me \"people\" is empty for some reason.\n. Too late ;-)\n. https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/commit/844e359f401704bab120f71624ac5d41709f026c\n. You know there is a hardcoded exception for restricting me, did you? ;-)\n. This is by design\n. Explanation: this could make your system instable\n. All system apps\n. You are right, is doesn't work for system components, but it does for system applications, when you change a setting.\n. System components have uid < 10000\n. This is by design.\nI guess you wan to enable 'restrict dangerous' in the main settings.\n. This is not a problem and actually a good thing, since it saves database space.\n. I don't see how this can improved, without sacrificing screen estate.\nMaybe we have an idea later how to improve this, for now I close this issue.\n. This is by design.\nSee here for the on demand logic:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ34\nIn short: you cannot restrict a function, while the category is not restricted.\n. This should be done using a batch operation.\nRefs #1319\n. Thanks for the continuing updates!\n. Please make a remark about this here:\nhttp://forum.faircode.eu/forums/forum/android/xprivacy/applications/\n. Duplicate of #1340 \n. Thanks for the translation update, it will be part of the next release, as always.\n. https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ25\n. Thanks, as usual!\n. I guess this concerns a function with parameters?\n. Unfortunately Android has no standard way to reboot your device. It is easy to reboot the device through Linux (when having root permissions), but what is often forgotten, is that you might lose data this way and even your storage devices (internal, SD card, etc) might get corrupt using this reboot method. For this reason I don't include such an option.\n. To illustrate: I reboot my device often this way and once in a while I have to do a clean install, because the internal storage was corrupted. This will happen to others too, often not thinking this is the problem, or resulting in complaints.\n. Actually I think I have found a clean way to reboot through the power manager.\nFormerly this was not possible, because only system applications can do that.\nSince the new privacy service runs within Android itself, this is not an obstacle anymore.\nWith a little bit of trickery I have already a working proof of concept :-)\nThe on demand stuff doesn't know the app was update ...\n. The usage data is based on restricted or not, which is asked only once to the privacy service for performance reasons. The allowed accounts, applications and contacts are applied if the answer was to restrict. It would require an extra call to the privacy service to say there were allowed contacts, etc. Another things is that caching, both on the client and server side, will be in the way of this feature. I think this feature is not important enough to justify rewriting good working code, so I will set this request to won't fix, sorry.\n. This is not possible, what is shown now is the maximum.\n. You don't have all the latest changes, do a 'git pull'\n. That is correct, since it isn't used anymore.\n. I hope you are going to contribute something ;-)\n. Fortunately :-)\n. Thanks for the translation update\n. Duplicate or extension of #1319\n. I cannot reproduce this and it seems quite impossible to me.\n. The link color is determined by your theme, so this might indeed causing readability issues.\nThe correct solution is to get the background color from the theme also, else other people will have the same problem.\n. Sorry for all the changes ...\n. You can already do that, there is an import in the app view.\nIt only restores also the global settings.\nYou can also multiple select to import for two or more apps.\n. Most of what the browser does is difficult to restrict, since there are no public API's to hook into.\nSee also: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ25\n. Duplicate of #1377\n. See #1340 for a solution.\n. The is probably because if restricting 'connect' and a process that cannot handle the exception that is thrown. An IOException is a normal possible response from 'connect', so this is a combination of a restriction and a bug.\nE/AndroidRuntime( 8624): *** FATAL EXCEPTION IN SYSTEM PROCESS: CaptivePortalTracker\nE/AndroidRuntime( 8624): java.lang.ClassCastException: java.io.IOException cannot be cast to boolean\nE/AndroidRuntime( 8624):        at libcore.io.IoBridge.connect(Native Method)\nI have no idea what 'CaptivePortalTracker' is.\n. Wait, maybe there is a connect variant that expects a boolean.\nI will make a test version.\n. Can you please try this version: http://d-h.st/KzQ\n. Then you have to find the offending restriction. We know it is 'connect' and probably a system component.\nIt is not unusual that XPrivacy triggers bugs in other packages, but fortunately it does not occur frequently.\n. It appears to be a bug after all ...\n. Thanks for this big translation update!\n. This can only be done from the UI.\nLow level application information isn't available.\nI had to search for a way to find the external storage location while implementing this feature.\nAn additional problem is that getExternalStorageDirectory requires a user context in newer Android versions.\n. I am merging this into #1375 \nMy proposal is to make it possible to white list folder, solving this issue and adding more flexibility.\n. This should be fixed in the next release, please leave a comment here if it isn't.\n. This is already part of the last release.\n. I am sorry, this was indeed changed and I will not change it back, since it appeared nginx served the crowd sourced restrictions on ssl for all my sites. Google even indexed it :-( I have put a rule in my nginx configuration to report a 410 on anything else than crowd.xprivacy.eu to let Google remote the stuff from the index (hopefully).\n. Can't you use a VPN or a https or whatever tunnel for this?\n. Are you sure about this?\nCan this process be restricted?\n. There should be no exceptions for restricting anything (except for the documented stuff).\nWhat does com.android.shell anyway?\n. It seems to be the Android bug reporter.\n. Actually it is just a specialized content provider (to be precise a file provider).\nhttp://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/ext/com.google.android/android/4.3_r1/com/android/shell/BugreportReceiver.java\nIf restrictions work in one package, they work for all packages (most of them anyway).\nI am considering to add a restriction for this provider, since not everybody want to report stuff to Google.\n. Me too ;-)\nCan you please create an issue for this potential new restriction.\nI will take some research to implement it, which I don't want to do now.\n. For reference:\nhttp://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/ext/com.google.android/android/4.3_r1/com/android/shell/BugreportReceiver.java\n. I don't think we need to restrict this:\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.slvn.trashreport\n. You are fast, as always ;-)\n. Thanks again!\nIsn't the white/black listing a nice feature?\n. Look in privacy service and you will see the setting will be removed when passing a null as value. The PSetting class takes care of properly serializing a null value.\n. Look a few lines higher ;-)\n. Not always, but this time yes ;-)\n. It is a little hidden, but you can define your own dangerous function by long pressing the function name in the application details view.\n. Yes, you can toggle dangerous for any of the functions.\n. Maybe this works a little bit different than you expected, but the functions are exceptions to the category. So, you need to restrict the category first to make exceptions for the functions in the category.\n. You can already control from the application details view for which categories and functions the on demand dialog appears. Is this what you are looking for?\n. If you enable on demand restricting for the application, you can control for each category and functions with a second column of check boxes whether there is a popup or not.\n. If you mean the on demand restricting dialog, the default is 20 seconds, so more than you want. Keep in mind that the on demand restricting dialog might put critical system processes on hold. This means there is a risk it will results in a reboot, although I haven't seen that problem and it wasn't reported so far too. This means that there are limits to the time the dialog can be shown.\n. Unfortunately this is not possibly. The connect hook is at the lowest level of Android. Doing a DNS lookup here would slow down your device, could result in instability and will result in recursion, since a DNS lookup also needs a connect.\n. I will check the source code to be sure.\n. I think we are good to go here:\npublic String getHostName() {\n        if (hostName == null) {\n            try {\n                hostName = getHostByAddrImpl(this).hostName;\n            } catch (UnknownHostException ex) {\n                hostName = getHostAddress();\n            }\n        }\n        return hostName;\n    }\nprivate static InetAddress getHostByAddrImpl(InetAddress address) throws UnknownHostException {\n        BlockGuard.getThreadPolicy().onNetwork();\n        try {\n            String hostname = Libcore.os.getnameinfo(address, NI_NAMEREQD);\n            return makeInetAddress(address.ipaddress.clone(), hostname);\n        } catch (GaiException gaiException) {\n            throw gaiException.rethrowAsUnknownHostException();\n        }\n    }\nMeaning that resolving the hostname is handled by Linux and won't result in recursion.\n. This might delay making internet connection, however.\nI don't think that is a problem, because that is an expensive operation anyway.\n. You can try with this version: http://d-h.st/YuI\n. Tapatalk works for me without problems.\nI don't see the point in showing the IP if there is a host name available, you are connecting to the same service.\n. That is correct, these categories cannot be restricted for XPrivacy. See the limitations section in the read me for more details.\n. Could you please check if this version fixes this problem: http://d-h.st/x7b\n. Please try this version instead: http://d-h.st/YuI\n. I had just added whitelisting for folders, so this was not difficult anymore.\nPlease let me know if everything works okay: http://d-h.st/oCX\n. Can you please check it out: http://d-h.st/F5w\nAnd this is what I meant by small improvements on XDA ;-)\n. Thanks for testing.\n. You want full control, you got it ;-)\nLet me know if this is better: http://d-h.st/Gz3\n. What do you exactly mean?\n. That is by design ;-)\n. Just out of curiosity, what would be a fair donation for the pro license in your opinion?\n. Thanks for your opinion!\n. Also thanks for your feedback @Cerberus-tm \n. Yes, the pro enabler is still in the Play store, because removing it would result in a lot of complaints from people that have bought it and still using it and want it to install again for some reason.\nSee also here: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ29\n. Not that I know of, it is either in the Play store or not.\n. Yes, but that would not be a solution, because it will still result in complaints for people who didn't subscribe for the beta program (which will be about zero, because there was never such a program for the pro enabler).\n. I have to be careful what I say in the Play store description or Google might remove the enabler from the store, which wouldn't serve existing users either. Any reference to another payment method could be a problem for Google. Nevertheless your suggestion brought me to an idea, I have changed the first sentence to:\n\"This application enables _only the following XPrivacy Pro features:_\"\nI have added the word only, so it is right from the first sentence clear what you will get.\n. That is not a bad idea, but although the idea of F-Droid is okay, it doesn't allow you to sign the apk's yourself. Nevertheless I will think about this, since the installer is only a tool and not XPrivacy itself.\n. Unfortunately I think the XPrivacy installer doesn't comply to the inclusion policy of F-Droid:\n\"the software should not download additional executable binary files\"\nhttps://f-droid.org/wiki/page/Inclusion_Policy\n. I hope you are trying this with the latest version of XPrivacy. Even if XPrivacy is influencing performance there is little there can be done.\n. Please provide a logcat while starting Titanium backup with usage data and debug logging enabled and mention your device model.\n. Which device was this on?\nIt seems to me that the CPU is not very strong:\nI/Choreographer( 4643): Skipped 30 frames!  The application may be doing too much work on its main thread.\nThe garbage collector is also holding things up:\nD/dalvikvm( 4643): GC_CONCURRENT freed 1555K, 27% free 10728K/14696K, paused 2ms+3ms, total 50ms\nAlso cached restrictions and settings take frequently more than a few milliseconds to get, which is really a fast operation (hash table lookup).\nAnd indeed, fetching settings and restrictions from the service takes often quite some time, sometimes over one second, which will inevitably accumulate to longer wait times. Fetching from the service is a direct RPC via the Linux kernel and restrictions are cached at the service side too (without timeout). A possible explanation would be slow access to the SQLite database, for example because of a slow internal storage.\nIt is interesting to see, but I don't think this can be improved.\n. It could be a good explanation, but I like to make sure XPrivacy is not to blame. Could you please tell me how much the difference with usage data disabled is. And also with on demand restricting disabled in the main settings. Reboot after changing the settings for a fair compare. Also please try a few older 1.99.x versions to check we didn't introduce a bug somewhere might help.\n. Could you please try if the just released version 1.99.53 improves the situation?\n. Thanks for your research!\nI am glad the cause is clear now and that XPrivacy is not the cause of the problem.\n. catlog works for me, so this is definitively caused by a restriction.\n. Usage data is perfectly aligned (centered).\nUpgrade to the latest version to how shorter parameters.\n. I don't understand what you want, so please explain in more detail.\nFor my the usage log is perfectly aligned.\n. I guess you are not using the latest version?\n. Whitelisting will only be available when using on demand restricting.\nIt is not worth to build a complete user interface for this.\nIt will also result in all kind of support questions, for wrongly entered data.\nSee also here: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=50535073&postcount=7547\n. I will make it possible to copy the parameter.\n. Could you let me know if you like this: http://d-h.st/jOG\n. OS Monitor has been added to the list in the FAQ.\nOpen source software is always preferred in this context.\n. It took some trickery to make the click working again, but it stays a compromise, since less area is clickable now. Version to try: http://d-h.st/TbO\n. It seems to be a bug in Viber, maybe caused by receiving invalid data.\n. There is no developer documentation for the connect function, since it is an internal Android functions.\nI have checked if URLConnection can be restricted and as expected it is going through connect.\nThis is only one of the many possible ways to make an internet connection, but all go through connect.\n. Does it use 'socket' ?\n. I have installed the app and my best guess it is using the native library 'mega' to connect to the internet.\n. Yes, except for IPC, inet, sdcard and media.\n. Yes, since this represents a Linux permission for internet usage.\n. When there is no usage data for a function, that will be shown with a grayed usage data icon, see also the ? help. When a restriction requires an application restart, you'll be notified of that. There are no restrictions that require a reboot.\n. System applications are marked as dangerous for a reason. Remove the restrictions and maybe clear the application data in an attempt to fix this.\n. Clearing application data is an Android function, mostly available through the application settings.\n. I cannot reproduce this issue. Maybe it is an interaction with Greenify. Can you try again with Greenify disabled?\n. The on demand dialog is generic code, so all categories and functions are treated equally.\n. I still can't reproduce it.\nAllowing/denying once it the simplest case, since it only updates a cache and return the selected result to the client:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/PrivacyService.java#L1502\nI don't think XPrivacy is causing this.\n. Good!\n. Duplicate of #1340\n. I have to think @rovo89 for pointing this out, because this is a major bug and indeed an unintended side effect if the referenced commit.\n. This is perfectly normal, they share the same uid and so the same restriction.\nThis cannot be changed, because the uid is the only information that is always available.\n. This is not a bug in XPrivacy, but a choice of the author of Poweramp.\nThere is a bug in XPrivacy that requires a reboot to apply some restrictions.\nThis will be fixed in the next release.\n. I had to do already some trickery to make item clickable in combination with making copy work, so I am not going to invest time into this, sorry.\n. There is little I can do here.\nI already changed the type of the on demand dialog to prevent interaction with notifications.\nThere are not many other useful types for this rather specific purpose:\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowManager.LayoutParams.html\nCurrently TYPE_PHONE is being used and previously it was TYPE_SYSTEM_DIALOG.\nIt has been reported that TYPE_PHONE fixes the interaction with notifications.\nThis could also be a bug in your ROM.\n. I cannot reproduce this.\nAre you using the latest version of XPrivacy?\n. Yes, there is a good reason for this.\nIt is for the column exceptions, see for example here:\nhttps://crowd.xprivacy.eu/?package_name=com.facebook.katana\nNo accounts, applications or contacts are sent to the server:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/ActivityShare.java#L1316\n. Is this with the latest XPrivacy version?\n. I/Xposed  (  156): -----------------\nI/Xposed  (  156): 23 f\u00e9vr. 2014 16:33:39 UTC\nI/Xposed  (  156): Loading Xposed v42 (for Zygote)...\nI/Xposed  (  156): Loading modules from /data/app/biz.bokhorst.xprivacy-1.apk\nI/Xposed  (  156):   Loading class biz.bokhorst.xprivacy.XPrivacy\nI/XPrivacy(  156): Load /data/app/biz.bokhorst.xprivacy-1.apk\nW/XPrivacy(  156): Changed permission path=/data/xprivacy mode=770 uid=1000 gid=1000\nW/FileUtils(  156): Failed to chmod(/data/xprivacy): libcore.io.ErrnoException: chmod failed: ENOENT (No such file or directory)\nFor some reason the folder /data/xprivacy could not be created.\nIn any case delete any existing file/folder and retry with the latest XPrivacy version:\nrm -R /data/xprivacy\n. Maybe the permissions of the top folder are the problem, so please post the output of:\nls -al | grep data\nMine is like this:\ndrwxrwx--x system   system            2014-02-23 20:16 data\nMaybe some weird SELinux rule is causing this, so you might want to try with SELinux in permissive mode (there is an app in the Play store that can change this).\n. Thanks for the outputs!\nThe database (folder) is created by Zygote, so the security context of Zygote is what counts.\nFor me the security context is:\nu:r:init:s0                    root      182   1     zygote\nCould you please try this version, where I have moved the database to /data/system, which seems to be a better location anyway then a private folder: http://d-h.st/F12\n. Thanks for reporting back!\nThe next version will have the database in a sub folder of /data/system, so you need to move the databases manually when upgrading.\nThe Geocoder message most probably means that there are parts of Google components are not installed / not running.\n. Since I think it is not very clean to put the database files in /data/system between the other system files, I like to put the database files in the folder /data/system/xprivacy. Since you had problems with creating folders, I like you to try this version: http://d-h.st/3KF, which will attempt to make the sub folder in /data/system. Please note that the old databases will not be moved, so you might want to move them after the test. Could you please test if this works?\n. Could you please try if this version can create the folder:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/releases/tag/1.99.55\nIt is unfortunate that I cannot reproduce this issue myself.\nWhat has been changed is that no longer Zygote will create the folder, but the system server.\n. Thanks for reporting back!\nThese warnings are nothing to worry about.\n. Whitelisted stuff is not submitted and I don't think it is a good idea to submit it, since it could contain privacy sensitive stuff.\n. Maybe we should handle this like the accounts, applications and contacts and just submit there are exceptions.\n. It is not handled yet.\n. This will be changed in the next release, these functions will be submitted as deny with having an exception. While fetching the server will take into account the exceptions (and basically allow the restriction). Later we can improve this, by checking the number of submitted exceptions versus the number of submitted restrictions.\n. We cannot be sure if the function wasn't used so far, it will never be used.\nBetter safe than sorry here.\n. Should be solved now, isn't it?\n. What I want to do is add a type parameter to settings, both as parameter and as a column in the database. This will make whiteList management easier and more transparent.\n. GPS status works for me as expected, so this must be a restriction or another problem.\nCheck the main usage data list for restrictions.\n. If there were problems with the GPS restrictions, there would have been massive complaints.\nIPC has nothing to do with this, see my comment in the other issue.\nMy best guess is that this has nothing to do with XPrivacy.\n. If you are still using an Xperia device: the GPS is not the most stable part of it.\n. The behavior of denying once for timed out on demand restricting has been changed in version 1.99.54 ...\n. Yes, I have read it, but this isn't an explanation.\nMy best guess is that there was somewhere a restriction hanging/cached for Android.\nOn demand restricting only works for applications (double checked) and restricting system components (main settings) should also work (default disabled).\nThis doesn't change anything for IPC. Given the provided logging it is not working.\nMake sure you upgrade to the latest version.\n. The question mark in the main list does nothing, I will remove it in the next release.\nOn demand restricting is visible in the log file, but really, don't worry, there is no on demand restricting for Android.\n. You can check the usage data for uid 1000 to see if something was restricted what shouldn't be restricted.\nIPC restrictions are not working for you, no need to look into the log file, I already did.\n. XPrivacy does not prevent the GPS icon from appearing, see also the FAQ.\nAgain:IPC restrictions (or not) are not causing this and are only there for a very specific case I haven't seen an example for yet.\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Thanks for the translation update as always!\n. Please provide a logcat, else there is little I can do.\n. I see nothing related to XPrivacy in the log file or anything else that could explain the warm reboot.\nMostly a warm reboot is caused by repeated system exceptions, often caused by insufficient resources (mostly memory).\n. I like to have the translators do this, since you and I cannot check if everything is correct, especially not for non latin scripts. Maybe you can make a script for this too, so that a translator can run this on the next update.\n. I am not going to merge this, because I am still afraid things will break.\nThis is up to the translators to fix.\n. I am going to trust you did this well.\nIf you update the pull request, so I can merge it without conflicts, I will merge it.\n. Thanks for your patience with stubborn me ;-)\n. This should be fixed in the next release.\nIf it isn't, please leave a comment again here.\n. ???\n. Maybe the FAQ can help you: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ49\n. My best guess is that the Xposed framework is not installed anymore.\nCheck the Xposed installer.\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Please tell me a uid to look for (which should be in the logcat).\n. And tell me the XPrivacy version you are using.\n. Facebook seems to be uid 10087.\nAnd Facebook locations are restricted as should:\nI/XPrivacy/XLocationManager( 1895): get 10087/requestLocationUpdates location=restricted 2 ms\nI/XPrivacy/XLocationManager( 1895): Added count=1 uid=10087\nWhy do you think locations are not restricted?\n. See also here about Facebook location restricting:\nhttp://forum.faircode.eu/forums/topic/com-facebook-katana-location-restriction/\n. Google maps is a bit special, see here:\nhttp://forum.faircode.eu/forums/topic/com-google-android-apps-maps-how-to-restrict-locations/\nCheck your usage data for Facebook and Twitter, these should at least be restricted:\n- GMS.getLastLocation\n- GMS.requestLocationUpdates\n- getLastKnownLocation\n- requestLocationUpdates\n. I am running stock ROM on a Nexus 5 too and everything works for me.\n. Also, please note that Facebook determines/caches your rough location using your IP address.\n. You can try GPS status with just requestLocationUpdates restricted.\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eclipsim.gpsstatus2\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Thanks for the translation update\n. Whitelists are part of on demand restricting and available to everybody.\nWhitelist management (changing whitelists) is only for pro license owners.\nIf you don't have a pro license, please contact me using this contact form, mentioning your full name and an e-mail address and I will send you one:\nhttp://forum.faircode.eu/contact/\n. Thanks for you support.\nI hope I understood what you meant:\n1. Use the filter (action bar) to select applications without restricts, select all (action bar), fetch should do the job\n2. Turn on on demand restricting and you will be asked to allow or deny each access\n. This message is misleading, it should say \"will restrict\", so don't worry no restrictions are applied.\nNevertheless there should be very little of these message, so please provide a logcat, so I can check if this is okay or not.\n.

I have the idea that one of the hooks is not working, but to be sure I need to see a logcat from boot (started before your device has been turned on).\n. I need a logcat captured from your PC, starting before turning on your device.\n. I have already an explanation for this, so you don't need to capture a logcat from your PC (unless of course you like to learn how to do this ;-) ). The IPCs are handled by a native library, which is apparently not loaded in your case when the hooking is done. I will not fix this, since this is a rare situation, so I have documented this in the limitation section.\n. No, it won't work in your case.\nThis is caused by a limitation of Xposed in combination with the specific ROM you are using.\nI have no workaround for this currently, that is why I have documented this as a limitation.\n. Please provide a logcat.\n. Did you check the usage data?\nDo you have Google play services restrictions?\nDid you try to clear all XPrivacy restrictions?\nAre you using the latest version of XPrivacy?\n. Without logcat there is little I can do, so I am closing this issue.\nSee here about how to capture a logcat:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ14\n. I have just installed TextSecure, allowed everything in XPrivacy (latest version) and registration was no problem. So, either there is a restriction causing this (check the main usage data) or this problem is not related to XPrivacy at all.\n. This is not possible, because a lot of system components are already running before there is any user interaction possible. Furthermore it would compromise system stability.\nIf you really want, you can compile XPrivacy yourself and modify this line: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/PrivacyService.java#L553\n. How do you propose to fix this?\n. Given that on demand should not be batch turned on, I actually think this is the best that can happen.\n. https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/commit/46482e0d24e5a10e5bf4980cbb1b8eedcabd46de\n. I have put the deny choice deliberately in the OK position. It is a privacy application after all, so that seemed to me the reasonable \"default\" for when somebody is not paying attention.\n. I am also a perfectionist, although I have learned to choose when to be one and when to be not one ;-)\n. Yes, the is a little history.\nI don't like to change existing strings, because of the about 35 translations.\n. Have slept a night about it, I think \"toggle restrictions\" is still a good title that covers all possibilities.\nIf you want you can extend the existing pull requests to rename string ID's.\n. Done\n. Thanks for the update!\n. This issue was reported before, but I cannot find the issue. This is not caused by XPrivacy, but by a slow internal storage. Google for fstrim and you will understand.\n. I will into the on denand dialog issue again later today or tomorrow. Maybe reading some Android source code can help.\n. Please let me know if this issue is solved in 1.99.60 or not.\n. I guess you mean to the file name?\n. No more problems were reported, so I guess this problem is fixed now.\n. There is no difference for dangerous or not dangerous functions. I have just tested this and it works as supposed to. Note that the category needs to be restricted to be able to toggle a function this way.\n. Thanks, as usual!\n. The next version will have clearer titles and a new option to batch disable on demand restricting.\nWhat you want should be done using the template, since the on demand options only change the on demand settings op the application (the same as on the setting page).\n. I like to have this consistent to prevent endless questions, so no, sorry.\n. Can you give an example and tell what is exactly wrong?\n. How do you propose to solve this in a for everybody transparent way?\n. Please not that there would be a significant performance impact for checking multiple levels, so that is not an option.\n. I see no feasible solution to fix this, so I am setting this issue to won't fix.\n. I will see what I can do again.\n. Test version:\nhttps://crowd.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_2.1.12-6.apk\n. This version should shown one level of folders more:\nhttps://crowd.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_2.1.13-4.apk\n. The on demand dialog is scrollable.\nYou can try it by rotating your device 90 degrees.\n. Duplicate of #1474\n. First of all, this use case scenario is not officially supported, only the official build is supported.\nThat said, there is no difference between the official build and an own build, so this should work.\nIf it doesn't work, the Android package manager is to blame.\nTry debugging the package change intent, this is how the notification is handled.\nIf there is something wrong, which I doubt, please create a pull request.\nIt could be that the official XPrivacy was not completely uninstalled, for example because there is a secondary user still having XPrivacy installed.\nAlso, the package manager keeps information about uninstalled applications, so you may need to find a way to purge that information.\n. Maybe we were looking at the wrong place:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/PackageChange.java#L129\nAnd should we look here:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/BootReceiver.java#L22\nTry to add some debug messages at both places to pinpoint the problem.\n. Also check this to prevent wasting time on known common problems:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ49\n. This is your problem:\nUtil.isXposedEnabled() = false\nHow does this work: this function is hooked here to return true:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XUtilHook.java\nThis probably means something deeper is wrong.\n. Looking at the logcat, it seems either Xposed is not working or XPrivacy is not enabled in Xposed.\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. I am not sure what you mean, so please explain in more detail.\n. This is by design, long press on an already selected app ends multiple select mode.\n. This is not the idea of the template, but you can do this by first selecting a category in the main list and then toggle restrictions.\n. Enable/disable on demand restricting changes only the application setting.\nYou want to select 'apply template'.\n. For each application there is a master switch in the settings that switch on or off the restrictions for the application. You can batch enable/disable this settings with the last two options of toggle restrictions. If on demand restricting is enabled for the application, you can enable on demand restricting for each category by (batch) applying the template.\n. You should first enable on demand restricting for the application (this can be done in a number of ways, in the application settings, toggling the check box next to the on/off switch and using a toggle restrictions option).\nAfter that you can apply the template to set on demand restricting for all categories or one category.\nI have just test this and it works as expected.\n. Yes, it is supposed to work like this. The default is to ask on demand everything and you can either change that manually or by (batch) applying the template.\n. Select the clipboard category before toggling restrictions will only apply the template to the selected category.\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Thanks, but you are too late ;-)\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/commit/beae884bc12220910e5f5cbfc60a5525efe0ef45\nI almost always update the changelog directly after making changes to save work and to prevent forgetting things, but I am glad you are following the commits.\n. I don't believe this app is much used.\nAlso a short description should be added to compare it to XPrivacy.\nThis app seems to revoke permissions.\n. Thanks, IMHO opinion documentation is as important as high quality code.\n. It was designed like that ;-)\nBut I want to wait a little until everything is stabilized.\n. From which version were you upgrading?\n. It is relevant, because the privacy service does the reboot and the previous version should be compatible with the current version. Anyway, I have checked the code and everything should be okay. If it doesn't work, either the privacy service is incompatible or not running or your ROM is not incompatible. None of these is something I can fix.\n. This doesn't look like an XPrivacy problem, although there could be a restriction causing this. Check the main usage data to find a restriction that could cause this.\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. That is by design, the on demand setting needs to be enabled to set on demand for categories.\n. You can batch enable on demand restricting first in the latest version before applying the template in the latest versions.\n. Everything is possible, but there are limits to the things I want to add.\n. I will leave this for after the next stable release.\n. The batch operation application list has now an information icon for each application and since my goal is to keep things as simple as possible, I will not merge this pull request. Nevertheless thanks for your efforts!\n. XPrivacy applies the template on receiving package changed messages from Android. If XPrivacy doesn't receive these messages for whatever reason, nothing will happen. There is no way not receiving messages can be fixed seen from XPricacy.\n. XPrivacy reports \"Package change\" in the log file as soon as it receives this message from Android:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/PackageChange.java#L26\nso, my initial assesment was right: this message is missing and thus XPrivacy does nothing.\nThere is nothing I can do to fix this, seen from the perspective of XPrivacy.\nMaybe there is not enough memory to send this message or there is simply a bug in your ROM.\n. I install and uninstall frequently applications to test XPrivacy and I have never seen any glitch. You seem to be the only one having this problem, which makes me think it might be a restriction. So, check the usage data.\n. Thanks, this will probably make some people happy!\n. Thanks for your ideas!\nI think I have a simpler solution for this: remove the options altogether and when applying a template with om demand somewhere enabled, also enable the on demand setting.\n. Maybe leave the option to disable on demand for when something went wrong (somebody actually had the problem I anticipated, an on demand 'hell').\n. They can, by first selecting the category and then apply the template.\n. Good find!\n. The title will show what will happen.\n. For now I will leave the batch enable/disable on demand restricting as it is.\nAll other improvements are already committed.\nThanks again!\n. @banderos101 I don't what you are trying to say, but I have recently made it possible to enable/disable a restriction and/or on demand restricting for one category. Just select a category and apply the template.\n. I have just tested this for another time and it works as supposed too.\n- Select a category in the application list\n- Select one or more applications\n- Apply the template\nResult: template only applied for the selected category for the selected application(s).\n. This is by design, applying the template will not enable the application on demand setting.\nIt will only change the on demand for categories (and functions in the latest release).\nYou can batch enable the on demand restricting setting.\n. I respond bad to all capitals ...\nThis does not happen for me.\nTry installing the latest version.\n. Why should @jpeg729 back you up?\nInstall the latest version and if it still not works, describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem (again) and I will look into it (again).\n. \"Can you batch enable on-demand for single category without enabling it for other categories?\"\nI have just tried yet another time and I can batch enable on demand restricting for a single category without enabling it for any other category.\nAre you sure you did select the targeted category before selecting the menu Toggle restrictions to apply the template?\n. The template is and will not be a Swiss army knife, so please stop asking about enhancing it. I have been adding new features for nine months now and enough is enough.\n. As said on the XDA forum a few times, requests for small improvements are okay. Furthermore I will support this project until the end, meaning that bugs will be fixed and XPrivacy will adapted for new Android versions. However, there will be no more big changes anymore.\n. You should be able to swipe away the notification.\n. See here: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ38\n. Thanks again!\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. What do you mean by 'state' ?\n. These are old entries from a version before where files and /proc where combined.\n. You can safely delete these entries.\n. I had noticed too, but was #1000 not a better candidate for a prize? There were quite some things added to XPrivacy on your request in the course of time, is that a good enough prize? ;-)\n. Absolutely, no doubt about that.\n. Can you please name an application I can test this with.\nI tried almost all my applications, but all use domain names.\n. They use domain names in my case.\n. Sent by e-mail, because Dev-Host is not working currently.\nNote that the user defined functions are moved (you might want to test this too).\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\n. Are you sure it is an IP address in the form xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx ?\nThe IP address matcher does not match IPv6 addresses and anything alphabetical. Some Google's addresses looks like an IP address, but aren't.\n. The IP address is not recognized because the pattern doesn't recognize port numbers. I will fix that later tonight or tomorrow.\n. I have sent another test version by e-mail.\n. Good!\nIt is a nice addition.\n. I have tested the code another way, so I am quite sure it is okay.\n. This is incorrect, the range for the cell ID is 0..0xFFFF (0..65535)\nSee here:\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/gsm/GsmCellLocation.html#getCid()\n. Please note that only GSM Lac and Cid are supported.\nThe phone type is also faked to be a GSM.\n. There are just about 5 restrictions of about 250 that have no usage data, but this one is not one of them. Please note that Cid and Lac are fields of cell location and thus not individually visible. Look for enableLocationUpdates and/or getCellLocation.\n. And please ask your next question on the XDA forum.\nThe issues are for bugs and feature requests.\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support\n. I am afraid this would lead to too many problems. For example GSF ID can be randomized safely for most applications, but not the Google services, where it can be quite disastrous. This is just an example to illustrate the possible problems. I will think about your request and see if I can come up with a safe implementation.\n. The settings are just one tap away from the notification that a new application was installed, so I am not going to change this, given the potential disadvantages.\n. This is indeed a bug. I am surprised nobody noticed before. It will be fixed in the next release (probably tomorrow).\n. It is Dutch and believe me, it is not translatable ;-)\n. Although this is an interesting discussion, I was working on #1485 and #1513 (test version available in last issue)\n. Exporting and importing data will clean things up.\n. There was also a similar request in the past about applying the template for applications installed using recovery, but this is also a rare use case.\n. Package names are managed by the Android package manager and are only available when the package manager is available. The package manager is mostly not available for low level functions, for example when restricting an IP address and besides that it is not very fast. The uid on the other hand is always available (through the Linux binder to be exact) and getting it has almost no performance impact.\n. I have sent you a test version by e-mail.\n. I have fixed and tested it, but I like to have you to check it too.\nAs a result of the fix the export files will be somewhat larger, since all the categories will be always exported.\n. Size does not matter ;-)\nThanks for testing!\n. I don't see the point in doing this, since you will be asked for the same entry again, unless you allowed or denied the restriction altogether, but you can undo this in the user interface.\n. Managing whitelists in the user interface requires a pro license.\nYou can clear all restrictions for the application to clear all whitelists.\n. Both white (allowed) and black (denied) listed addresses should be shown.\nIf you allowed or denied not using a white/blacklist, nothing will be shown.\n. For 2) I am missing:\nLoading modules from /data/app/biz.bokhorst.xprivacy-1.apk\nThis is not an XPrivacy problem, if the module is not loaded XPrivacy will not do anything.\nAre you sure you enabled XPrivacy in step #2?\n. My best guess is this: you didn't wait for the migration to complete before starting th UI. In log 3 XPrivacy is starting without problems, but is creating a new database, probably because you were upgrading from a pre 1.99 version.\n. Even then you will have to wait until the migration is done, although nothing is migrated. In my experience it can even on a fast device take a minute before the migration is started by Android.\n. Let me first repeat that log 2 is with XPrivacy module not enabled, so this log is useless in this context.\nLog 3 contains these lines:\n03-06 10:20:05.401 W/XPrivacy(  511): Creating database\n03-06 10:20:05.521 W/XPrivacy(  511): Upgrading from version=1\n03-06 10:20:05.561 W/XPrivacy(  511): Upgrading from version=2\n03-06 10:20:05.591 W/XPrivacy(  511): Upgrading from version=3\n03-06 10:20:05.621 W/XPrivacy(  511): Upgrading from version=4\n03-06 10:20:05.651 W/XPrivacy(  511): Upgrading from version=5\n03-06 10:20:05.691 W/XPrivacy(  511): Upgrading from version=6\n03-06 10:20:05.721 W/XPrivacy(  511): Upgrading from version=7\n03-06 10:20:05.821 W/XPrivacy(  511): Upgrading from version=8\n03-06 10:20:05.872 W/XPrivacy(  511): Upgrading from version=9\n03-06 10:20:05.922 W/XPrivacy(  511): Upgrading from version=10\n03-06 10:20:05.952 W/XPrivacy(  511): Running VACUUM\n03-06 10:20:06.062 W/XPrivacy(  511): Database version=11\nNeither in log 3 an 4 is a trace of the migration process.\n. Please read this:\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=51083941&postcount=8366\n. I am glad this is resolved now. There were quite some people affected by this and in any case we know the cause now. I cannot really solve it with XPrivacy, but I have added an extra step to the installation and upgrading instructions.\n. I don't think there are many modules with a migration process as XPrivacy.\nNevertheless you can inform him, so he knows this problem has been demystified.\n. Thanks for this!\n. Typo fixed in another commit.\n. I completely missed your comments, sorry for this.\n206: The Android recording framework is generic, so a microphone (or two) might not be the only possible input.\n308: Anyone can submit restrictions after registration. The Android ID cannot be restricted for this to prevent multiple submissions when somebody is randomizing the Android ID.\n339: To flash the Xposed disabler in emergency cases\n427: Corrected\n693: The statement is true and I don't see how this contradict things\n709: This is still true, only function with white/black lists are exceptions and this has been added now\n. I am afraid line 307 isn't like 307 anymore, what does this line say?\n. hardware MAC address and external IP address\n. Some people want to change the externally visible MAC and IP address, this is not possible and in some countries illegal. XPrivacy can and will not do this, but can and will present a fake MAC and IP address to applications (which doesn't change the actual hardware address).\n. Thanks for the translation update and welcome back!\n. Test version: http://d-h.st/gRQ\n. Thanks for testing!\nFor an upside down questions mark, you can rotate your device 180 degrees ;-)\n. Test version: http://d-h.st/8Ii\n. Thanks and good thinking!\nCould you make one other pull request to change the parameters to positional formats, see here for details: #1514\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Could you also migrate to positional parameters next time? See here #1514\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks again!\n. Sub menu items are less convenient IMHO. If somebody has a suggestion how to improve things, please leave a comment.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. I don't know if this would be so transparent for everyone. Also the import/export is meant as backup, possibly transferred to another device. Lately it has been made possible to select the application(s) to import/export and I am not sure if it is a good idea to further extend things.\n. I have given this a second thought and I think it is not a good idea, because nothing selected means all visible selected. Novice users often do not know how to multiple select, so this change would take the obvious way to export all visible applications away. Moreover, this feature would be mainly for expert users from who I expect to know how to edit to XML export file.\n. Can you be specific about which information?\n. https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ25\n. This has nothing to do with privacy.\n. https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ25\n. A time zone is quite large and therefore not a location.\n. Wherever possible and feasible I will add restrictions to prevent fingerprinting, but it is difficult to prevent. For example the browser can be fingerprinted easily and there is little that can be done to prevent that, since most of the information used for fingerprinting has no public API. So, this is a partially lost cause.\nEach added hook will result in worse performance. In other words it is not a good idea to hook each and every function. The general rule is that things which are personally identifiable will be restricted.\nSometimes I think there should be a new mobile OS developed from the ground up, with not only security, but also privacy in mind.\n. For reference, this issue is a near duplicate of #1362\n. Lets make it 'If I make it, you will test it', okay?\nNevertheless donations are always welcome and not near any compensation for the time I have spent on this project. For reference: http://www.ohloh.net/p/xprivacy/estimated_cost\nI am currently looking into this and thinking about this, but no promises.\n. http://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/TimeZone.html\n. Test version: http://d-h.st/TXA\n- The restriction is in the system category\n- The restricted time zone is UTC\n- Don't ask me to add a setting for this\n. Thanks for testing.\nThis is IMHO protected enough by the setting 'restrict system components'.\n. Both ;-)\n. To be honest, I faked my time size to appear so fast ;-)\n. https://github.com/blog/1793-timezone-aware-contribution-graphs\nBTW, this new GitHub feature is not good for privacy ...\n. That is one of the reasons there will be no setting.\n. Nevertheless, the timezone reveals more or less where you are and can be used for fingerprinting. But the way it is now implemented is acceptable to me, unlike #1362\n. This change has been reverted, because it caused boot problems for some.\n. This anyway doubtful feature won't come back, else I had chosen another approach.\n. I cannot do much without a logcat, so please capture a logcat of the crash.\nSee here about how to: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ14\n. If you start the user interface of XPrivacy again (not your device), there should be a popup to send support info. Please send this to me, because that is a good as a logcat.\n. This is a known problem that cannot be fixed, please read here:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#limitations\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Bedankt!\n. Belgen blijven beter in de Nederlands taal dan Hollanders ;-)\n. Ja, ik denk dat 'zend' beter is.\nIk zal het veranderen.\n. https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/commit/f66651773a0c7a005c40fc049b6d7cf13bfe3893\n. https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/commit/dceeaf2844eee4359b6143ae328becab6b4668cf\n. White/black lists are application specific.\nIf you want to see them all, then you can export your settings and check the XML file.\n. Out of memory is not something I can fix.\nTry to find out which applications are using a lot of memory and consider to uninstall some of them.\n. I guess you are not using the latest version ...\n. Test version: http://d-h.st/f0a\n. The last 'category' or 'once' stated is saved when selected, all other choices are not saved, so the last 'category' or 'once' selection will be the default.\n. Another version to try: http://d-h.st/jmH\n. Thanks for the update, as usual!\n. Yes, I will accept position format pulls.\n. What do you mean by 'custom actions' ?\n. Aren't there already whitelists for URLs?\n. The shown setting seems to be one of them. In any case I don't want to make custom things for this, so I am closing this issue.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks!\n. I cannot reproduce this.\n. I can reproduce this, with global on demand disabled. Looking into it ...\n. Please test this version thoroughly: http://d-h.st/uaj\n. This version is not very different from the last release and will certainly not cause new boot problems, so please try again and provide a logcat if it fails another time.\n. Can you please try to boot without restrictions?\nWhich XPrivacy version are you currently using?\n. Looking deeper into the logcat I found this:\nandroid.database.sqlite.SQLiteDiskIOException: disk I/O error (code 3850)\nThis means there is something wrong with device /data/system is mounted on.\nMaybe the data partition is full or corrupted.\n. Be aware that your problem might have been different.\n. Apparently the newly added time zone restriction was doing more bad than good.\n. What you are asking is in theory possible. Fetching this information requires accessing the package manager, which I am afraid could unexpectedly break things (there are quite some different ROM variations). Since Android permissions should IMHO not be the deciding factor for allowing or denying things, I won't try to make this.\n. Apart from being a costly operation, this file is not available on all ROMs.\n. This version should fix the problem: http://d-h.st/cOK\nCould you please test if the batch operation view displays things correct in all circumstances?\nTh entries in the list will be larger too now, when the application name is long.\n. Yes\n. Yes, the spinner has been fixed too.\n. The selection colors are taken from the theme and that will not change, since it will result in other people having problems. So, the theme is to blame here.\n. Sorry, there is no way to override the colors, that is what the theme is for.\nThe XPrivacy colors are wherever possible taken from the selected theme.\nThere are just a few exceptions to this, but these are logical, like the dangerous background color.\n. XPrivacy is using the theme background color and all other theme colors wherever possible.\nTry another theme and you will see.\n. Thanks for the update.\nJust too late for the just released stable version, however.\n. Please try the just released version 2.0.1\nI have reverted the only change that could cause this.\n. @mkocustos thanks for reporting back!\n. Duplicate of #1543 \nVersion 2.0.1 is reported to solve the problem.\n. This question has been asked before. XPrivacy is a privacy application, so the best default is deny and that is why the deny button is placed where normally the ok button is. This will not change. For the next time: questions should be asked in the XDA forum, so that others can benefit from the answers too.\n. This way you can see the randomization was done and completed successfully.\n. You cannot combine randomize on access and randomize on boot. I will see if I can make this clearer.\n. Randomize on boot should randomize on access alone now.\nCould you please test this version: http://d-h.st/oqc\n. Please upgrade to version 2.0.2 for the enabler problem. Check the usage data of the app for a restriction that is causing this problem.\n. I have tested the pro enabler yesterday and it worked. Do you have Play store installed, a Google account configured and a working internet connection? Also check the usage data for restrictions of Google services. Else post a logcat.\n. I have tried several times, but I cannot reproduce this. Are you using the latest version of XPrivacy?\n. It was quite a search, but this version should fix the problem: http://d-h.st/8c0\nCould you please test it thoroughly and let me know if it does fix the problem?\nPlease also check if there are no double on demand questions now.\n. I have improved matching of the sh and su commands and updated the description. Could you be so kind to test this version and let me know of the su and sh are always matched okay?\nhttp://d-h.st/ChR\n. Simply by checking if shell/sh, shell/su and shell/exec are triggered with the correct commands.\nFor example AdAway should show su now instead of exec.\nWith on demand this is most easily checked, since it shows the command.\n. What is the command for com.jrummy.liberty.toolboxpro?\n. Yes, the su detection is not perfect.\nTo be sure, check the exact parameter in the usage data.\n. Then it is as good as it can be ;-)\n. Make sure you don't have randomize on boot/access enabled and that the settings in the application is blank. Please note that you cannot see the randomize value in the application settings anymore, but that doesn't mean it doesn't work. The new behavior is that each settings is taken individually from the global settings when it is blank.\n. Yes, they do apply to each application.\nIf an application specific setting is blank, it is taken from the global settings.\n. I don't have this problem, so it is probably a bug in your ROM. The progress bar is the standard Android progress bar without customizations, so I see no way to fix this \n. XPrivacy fetches this information from Android.\nThe local package manager of Android might be caching the old permission information.\nRestarting XPrivacy or rebooting your device will probably solve this problem.\nThis cannot be fixed with changes in XPrivacy.\n. This problem should be fixed in the just released version 2.0.4\n. This will be fixed in the next release and was caused by changes in one of the previous versions.\n. Before using XPrivacy, I can't think of anything else I would like to use ;-)\n. :+1:\nhttp://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/\n. Less :family: should :zzz: and :thought_balloon: about privacy :exclamation: \n. Thanks for the update\n. Android seperates the users on a device completely. It is almost if there is a virtual device for each user. The application data is not shared between users in any way. XPrivacy is bound to follow this model, so the restrictions for all users are completely separated.\n. What the primary user can do is still very limited. The secondary user may use the application in another way or have different ideas about privacy. As I have said before, the applications are completely separated, they have even a different uid. What the secondary users see is completely different from what the primary users sees and I think this is good and I see no reason to change this.\n. Even Android itself had a different uid, so the secondary user can even restrict the main system component in another way. This is what I meant, it is as having a different device.\n. I don't understand what you mean by this, so please explain in more detail. Do you want to hide XPrivacy for secondary users? You can already do this with restricted profiles as referenced by yourself.\n. XPrivacy will work for multiple users in all situations, so for secondary users and restricted profiles. There is nothing special needed in XPrivacy (besides what is already implemented) for this. As @jpeg729 pointed out, even when XPrivacy is not part of the restricted applications profile, it will still work.\n. There is only one thing you will have to be aware of: on demand restricting is global, so the popups will appear always, whichever user is using the device.\n. Check if the uid is the same, it probably is, so it will have the same restrictions as it had before.\n. It is impossible that the restriction and the application info do not match, since the uid of the restriction is used to fetch the application info.\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/PrivacyService.java#L1238\n. I have double checked the sources and the uid cannot be wrong.\nCan you post a screenshot of the main usage data?\n. Doesn't matter\n. Which uid and which restriction do I have to look at?\n. I don't see any restriction for that uid, maybe it is further in the list.\n. I was able to reproduce this issue.\nIn fact this can be considered an inconsistency in Android.\nI have done a simple workaround to fix this problem.\n. The dialog is built here:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/PrivacyService.java#L1363\nIt is just a standard dialog with a standard layout.\nNo theme is applied, so the system default seems to be wrong.\n. This is a known problem, but a problem I cannot reproduce, so if you can come up with a solution, I guess you will make some people happy. The solution should be generic, however, to prevent breaking this on devices/ROMs where it is working correctly now (which seems to be almost all).\n. Maybe the best solution is to hard code the colors in the layout.\n. If you don't want other users to change XPrivacy settings, you should not allow access to XPrivacy.\n. All Android users will have separated settings, but only the primary user can enable/disable debug logging and define dangerous functions. This means that secondary users can have another theme, template, etc.\n. Only the primary user can clear all data.\n. See also this updated FAQ:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ19\nAnd the changelog:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\n. Test version: http://d-h.st/Y0K\n. Thanks for reporting back!\nThis change is in the just released test version.\n. Applications added to a restricted profile get the template applied, I have this seen happen when testing for one of the other issues. Secondary users have their own responsibility to apply restrictions, just like the primary user. If you install XPrivacy for the first time as primary user, there will be no restrictions too. The same is for secondary users.\n. Then you need to setup the restrictions yourself for the secondary user before you hand over your device.\n. A blank profile has no password.\n. Have a little patience and I will make global settings per user. You can create an issue for this, so I can provide a test version for it. \n. Each Android user will get a separate set of settings, so there is no interaction between the users anymore.\nNone of your multi user issues cover this enhancement, so please create a new one.\n. It is likely that one of the new restrictions is causing this, so compare/check the usage data.\n. So, it seems XPrivacy has nothing to do with this.\nMaybe Profile scheduler+ checks for XPrivacy as does nothing when it is installed.\n. Although the Poweramp never revealed what they changes, Poweramp was most probably doing something in an unusual, incompatible way. They didn't ask me to change anything, but changed their code. The same could be necessary with Profile scheduler+, but lets not jump to conclusions and provide a logcat as described in the FAQ.\n. It is very short and XPrivacy logging is not enabled.\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ14\n. There is nothing unusual in the provided log.\nWhat is the uid of the application?\nDid you also check the global usage data?\n(the problem may be caused by restricting a system component or service)\n. Start by removing all restrictions for the application.\n. Then I don't know, sorry.\n. Just tested as you described, works for me.\nSo, there must be some restriction causing this.\nCheck your main usage data again.\n. This is insufficient: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ52\n- Which view? Application list or application details?\n- Which category?\n- Which steps should I follow to reproduce this?\nI test a lot with XPrivacy and have never seen this problem.\n. I have tried several times what you have described, but I cannot reproduce this.\n. The video shows the bug clearly, thanks.\nHowever, I like to know more, since I am not able to reproduce this bug.\nWhat did you do before the video?\nWas this a blank, new install of XPrivacy?\nDid you import settings?\nWhatever else can be relevant.\nI cannot fix this bug, if I cannot reproduce it.\n. A logcat capture during reproduction of this bug with XPrivacy debugging enabled (main settings) may also help.\n. I like to know if you collapse and expand the category if still everything isn't checked.\nI see nothing obviously wrong in the code and since this is just reported twice and I cannot reproduce it, it might very well a bug in your ROM.\n. I also like to know if you close the application details view and return back if the settings are still wrong.\n. Can you please try if the issue is fixed in this version: http://d-h.st/o7B\n. I have no idea what is causing this, for me and as it seems for many others it just works.\nIt is difficult to fix something that cannot be reproduced.\nI tried with some wild guesses, but I am out of ideas.\nHopefully somebody having this same issue with programming skills can pinpoint the problem.\n. This is not a bug.\nYou have on demand restricting enabled and probably the default template.\nThis means that all categories and functions will be set to not restricted when installing a new application (including through Titanium backup).\nRestricting a category in this case will leave all functions of an category not restricted.\nWhen unrestricting the category, all settings will be cleared, including all function exceptions.\nSo the next time you restrict the category, there are no function exception.\nI have no clear idea about how to improve this.\n. Version 2.0.16 beta should fix this problem.\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/releases/tag/2.0.16\n. Did you enable on demand restricting for the application(s) first?\n. Please describe the exact steps to reproduce this and provide a logcat as described in the FAQ.\n. I have tried with \"Bookmarks Light\" and the restriction works for me.\n. The restriction never prevented registration of bookmarks and history. The restriction is meant to prevent third party (not browser) from accessing the bookmarks and history. The browser should always be able to access this information. If you don't want your history being recorded, you should use the incognito mode of your browser.\n. Please provide a logcat, without a logcat there is very little I can do, but I guess @wbedard is right about the lack of resources.\n. Understandable: http://forum.faircode.eu/contact/\n. The problem seems to be that your memory is low, there are a lot of messages similar too:\nGC_CONCURRENT freed <1K, 16% free 64273K/75776K, paused 34ms+6ms, total 135ms\nEventually that will lead to ANRs because the total time will build up.\nThis is not really an XPrivacy problem, but indeed a resource problem.\n. This depends on Android version:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/Meta.java#L193\n. Can you please make a separate pull request to switch things over to https and for the changes you have made?\n. That line needs to be there.\n. It is not really an address, but part of the Android development environment.\nIt should not be changed.\n. Because it is html formatted.\nTry <br /> instead.\n. I have merged the pull request to switch to https.\nCould you please create a new pull request for the other changes, so we can discuss them more easily?\n. There is a good reason for this: the default action is on the right side. In case of XPrivacy that is deny, since that will serve your privacy the best.\n. Maybe I should have written \"standard\" instead of \"default\".\n. This is a know problem, see here:https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#limitations\n. You should use the template for this.\n. I cannot make XPrivacy perfect for everybody, since the opinions about what is perfect differ.\n. XPrivacy is already always resident.\n. The database or its contents cannot be safely loaded into memory.\nThe database contents are already cached in memory.\nIf there was something to improve here, I already had done it.\nXPrivacy relies on the Android package manager for the application list and doesn't rebuild it itself.\nThe local package manager does some caching, so there is no point to duplicate this in XPrivacy.\nIf there was something to improve here, I already had done it.\n. Some want to set restrictions of frozen applications, so this won't change.\nAlso, I don't want to answer questions about why applications are not shown.\n. I didn't say anything about time.\nThe issue section needs to stay open for bug reports.\nThe goal is to have a little as possible options.\nThis simplifies usage, prevents questions and reduces maintenance.\nAs I have said in another issue, I cannot make everybody happy.\n. As explained, I want a little as possible options.\nThe UI has been redesigned and improved a lot of times already, based on the feedback given on XDA and in quite some issues. So, explain why its needs an overhaul and why all feedback was mistaken.\nI don't know of any duplicates, but if you make a serious proposal about how the menu can be reorganized, I will look into it. There is one thing I won't do: sub menus, because IMHO scrolling is simpler than tapping multiple times.\n. @Cerberus-tm I don't think you can disable this, other than uninstalling these services.\n. API documentation:\nhttp://developer.android.com/google/play-services/index.html\n(not updated yet)\n. The new address API doesn't work without user intervention and doesn't need to be restricted.\nrequestUserAddress\n. Could you please put this information on the applications forum?\n. There is no way for XPrivacy to know which account type belong to which application, so this cannot be implemented. Moreover, it would break compatibility with previous versions of XPrivacy.\n. This cannot be done within the hook.\n. Reading an XML file is an expensive operation and the system XML files are not available on all ROMs.\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Duplicate of #1231\n. Thanks!\n. If one apllication has usage data, the restriction works. If another application has no usage data, it doesn't use the function. If you fake the external storage state to be offline, it is logical the function is not used. This \"issue\", should have been a question on XDA.\n. I guess adobe is using a native library.\n. Thanks!\n. Which messaging app do you mean? Please mention the package name. I also like to see a logcat.\n. I will see what I can do, but it may not be possible to fix this.\nThe logcat would be useful to see which restriction causes the images not to show.\n. I am quite sure allowing for this restriction works, but to be sure I need to see a logcat. Are there any other restrictions in the contacts category touched?\n. I don't have the default Android messaging app com.android.mms, so I need to see a logcat to see what is going on.\n. For Hangouts, the new default Android contacts application, this works okay, the icons for allowed contacts are shown.\n. Which XPrivacy version are you using?\n. I don't have that package either.\n. It should be fixed in this test version: http://d-h.st/Qmi\nPlease let me know if it is and if there are no side effects (also not in other applications).\n. I see only two options, given that this will be difficult to fix during migration:\n- clear all app specific settings fields\n- enable randomize on boot for all applications\nYour use case seems rather unique, given that nobody has complained about this in 85 test and beta cases. For this reason it is IMHO not worth to put effort into this.\nA more advanced solution is to manipulate the sqlite database.\n. There is no specific color for global data, only default values are shown as light gray \"hints\".\n. Yes and yes.\n. You did well, master is always okay.\nThe tags are just marks to be able to reconstruct a released version.\nThanks for updating the translation!\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. This looks like a problem with SyncMate or with the XPrivacy restrictions for SyncMate and not a problem with XPrivacy itself, which does not play a role in these notifications.\n. My best guess for the restriction that could cause this are the dangerous package restrictions in the system category.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ52\n. https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ25\n. I cannot reproduce it, so please describe in detail how this happened.\nBy default on demand restricting for existing applications is disabled to prevent an on demand \"hell\", which could easily bring down your device. If you enable \"restrict dangerous\" in the main settings, you can batch enable on demand restricting.\n. This problem should be fixed in this test version: http://d-h.st/EkQ\n. This fix is also in the just released version 2.0.11\n. This kind of problem is almost always caused by some restriction, so check the main usage data for suspect restrictions.\n. What you describe is the intended behavior. Batch enabling on demand restricting could lead to an on demand \"hell\" and easily bring down your device. On demand restricting is enabled by default for new applications, but not for existing applications. The template enables on demand restricting only if the application on demand master switch is enabled. You can batch enable the master switch by enabling \"restrict dangerous\" in the main settings.\n. I like to keep the amount of text in the embedded documentation to a minimum and rely as much as possible on online documentation.\n. Maintenance and translation are easier this way.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ52\n. The problem is this:\nCould not find class 'android.os.UserHandle', referenced from method biz.bokhorst.xprivacy.fz.a\nYour SDK version is 16, but this class is added in API level 17. XPrivacy checks for this version number, but apparently this is not enough. I will change the code to fix this.\n. Can you please try if this version fixes the problem: http://d-h.st/xfi\n. Try disabling all other Xposed modules to see if any of them is causing this problem. If that doesn't help please provide a new logcat.\n. XPrivacy is loaded without error messages now, but there is no trace of XPrivacy execution in the logcat. I have no idea why. This happens when LBE is installed, so make sure it isn't installed or bundled with your ROM.\nIf you were upgrading, it might be worth to try removing XPrivacy, reboot, install the new version, execute it once and reboot.\n. This version won't fix the problem, but has extra logging, so we can see whether XPrivacy is started by Xposed or not: http://d-h.st/hdU\nCan you please capture a new logcat with this version?\n. It would be simple to implement, but I am quite sure a lot of people will end up in the on demand \"hell\" if I do this.\n. getAccountsByType returns an empty array of accounts:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XAccountManager.java#L181\n This is a valid response according to the documentation. So, this is a bug in the Play store, not in XPrivacy.\n. Thanks!\n. This is definitively a problem with AppSettings.\nI don't support language switching, because I see this as an OS task.\n. XPrivacy uses the standard Android function DateUtils.getRelativeTimeSpanString to display relative times.\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/ActivityApp.java#L1353\n. Please capture a new logcat with XPrivacy enabled and XPrivacy debug logging enabled (main settings).\n. Unfortunately the logcat is very difficult to read, given that all line breaks are missing.\n. I cannot find anything in the logcat that could explain the problem. Maybe it is a timing problem that XPrivacy introduces. My suggestion is to ask support from the author of the application.\n. The reason is still unknown:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#compatibility\n. The technical architecture of 1.x and 2.x is quite different, so this does unfortunately not help to solve the issue. Please note that only the latest version is supported.\n. You can read here how to disable restrictions to pinpoint the restriction that is causing this:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/issues/1751#issuecomment-47424444\n. Can somebody try if this problem can be solved by using the quirk \"noresolve\" as described here:\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/modules/test-xprivacy-2-0-37-ultimate-privacy-t2320783/post54076739\n. I don't think restricting locations is enough, since I suspect that the accelerometer is also being used.\n. http://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/location/ActivityRecognitionClient.html\n. Shukran!\n. Yes, but it is always good to document all issues.\n. Thanks!\n. - Unstable donation flow, which requires manually attention too often, resulting in complaints and compromising anonymity\n- Very few donations using Bitcoin\n- Uncertain future for Bitcoin\n. Lets make a deal, if you can find three people that donate in Bitcoin this week, I keep accepting Bitcoin for the time being. I bet you can't find three people.\n. Reason for instability: http://blockchain.info confirms donations very slow, since the technical difficulties they had. When asked about it, the response was \"have patience\". I had a week patience and the problem was still not solved.\n. I am using this simple to use API:\nhttps://blockchain.info/api/api_receive\nThe flow on my side is 100% okay, it is an adapted version of the PayPal donation flow which I have been using for quite some time without a single issue, but as said blockchain.info had failed me too often recently. Before the problems they had, it worked almost flawlesly.\n. So, did you find three people?\n. @Linkz57 thanks for your donation. I will keep accepting Bitcoin donations for the time being. Your donation was handled automatically without any problem now.\n. @Amadeus17 please provide a logcat.\n. @ibrickphones there is a cascade of problems, but I have no idea what the core cause is. In any case pmem is low, which means the kernel should be change to allow for more pmem. Maybe you can try another kernel. If you can enable XPrivacy debug logging that would be helpful, but I don't think the boot comes far enough to do that. There could be a conflicting application, so may it is worth trying to freeze or uninstall all user applications. Another option is to use a Jelly Bean ROM.\n. Please let me know what you find.\n. @Amadeus17 this means that most probably a restriction was causing your problem. There is a menu to clear the all data, which will clear (empty) the XPrivacy databases (not delete them).\n. @ibrickphones I don't think that the logcats are going to reveal anything new. My advice is to try another ROM.\n. An application which is being uninstalled doesn't receive an uninstall event from Android, so this is not possible.\n. If you delete the files and they are visible later again, there are two options:\n- The files were in reality not deleted\n- XPrivacy is still running\nYou can distinguish between these by looking at the file dates before and after.\nTo be very clear: XPrivacy cannot delete these file when being uninstalled, this is mainly a limitation of Android.\n. Lets be clear: this issue is not about filtering.\n. This is how I understood it :-)\n. I will add a column of check boxes, depending on a new setting. This will be the only visible changes. \nThe check boxes will toggle on demand for the selected category and will toggle on demand on/off when the all category is selected.\n. In the All view you can enable/disable the on demand restricting switch for applications.\nIn a category view you can enable/disable on demand restricting for the selected category.\nTo enable/disable on demand restricting for a category, you need to enable the switch first.\nThe half state should display correctly in all cases.\nGlobally disabling on demand restricting will hide the new check boxes column.\n. No, because in the All view the check box should reflect the on demand switch state. The half state is just an extra. What I will change is that the half state will be shown if on demand restricting for all categories is turned off.\n. New test version: http://d-h.st/6QI\nPlease test this new feature thoroughly and report your findings in this issue.\n. What still is missing is a setting to enable this feature, maybe I will tie it to 'restrict dangerous'.\n. This feature is in beta version 2.0.15.\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/releases/tag/2.0.15\nYou need to enable 'restrict dangerous' to use this feature.\n. Sorry, but this is IMHO to far from the core function.\n. The activation instructions for the pro version already contain a lengthy description about how to activate the pro version, including the 'about' stuff. Some people seem to be not very good readers, however ...\n. It is a wild guess, but could you please try if this version improves things: http://d-h.st/57v\n. Since it is just a wild guess, yes.\n. The logcat you have sent doesn't reveal any problem.\nMost restriction settings are fetched very fast and there are no warning or error messages.\n. Since nobody has reported this problem before, are you sure XPrivacy is causing this?\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks, but the fast scroll was removed, because too many people complained about accidentally restricting things.\n. Indeed, else it would be a useful feature.\nI am using the incremental search myself mostly, which is even faster and much more reliable.\n. Test version: http://d-h.st/v7x\n. I don't see why you cannot restrict inet on demand anymore. If a function requires a restart, the allow/deny once option is just disabled, but all other choices are still available.\n. I have reverted the change, but I am not going to adapt the text.\n. It was there, but it didn't work always and was therefore removed.\n. Did you know that most reboot methods being used are not safe and can actually lead to data loss and even a corrupt file system? I had implemented a clean reboot method, only it didn't work for everybody in all cases.\n. All reboot methods that do not properly shutdown Android in the same way as you can do manually are unsafe.\n. I cannot reproduce this issue and I don't see how this can be a problem, since the notification explicitly starts the correct activity. What could have possibly happened is that the application for which you left the submit view was updated. Android keeps an activity stack, so the notification will open the child of the application view. This is standard Android behavior.\n. This change is in beta version 2.0.16\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/releases/tag/2.0.16\n. This addition is in beta version 2.0.16\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/releases/tag/2.0.16\n. I see no reason why, since there is no difference in function between the built-in and user defined dangerous functions, so IMHO it is only relevant when defining the dangerous functions in the template.\n. No, there isn't.\n. Do you have all Google services installed?\nDid you try to reboot?\nDid you restrict internet for XPrivacy or system components?\nDid you apply firewall rules for XPrivacy or system components?\n. Then I don't know. In any case this is not an XPrivacy problem, since the Google services are being use to lookup locations, so I will close this issue.\n. Try to remove the folder /data/system/xprivacy and reboot. Please provide a logcat if this doesn't help.\n. It was an educated guess that the bootloop was caused by a restriction. The logcat is not needed anymore.\nXPrivacy works on KitKat and will probably work on the S5,\n. This can probably not be solved, in any case not without logcat.\n. Maybe you need to promote this feature request to get ten +1's.\n. Securing the intent is indeed a non trivial problem. We don't want a random application to be able to randomize the fake values. I am not sure about how to solve this in a straightforward way.\n. @Cerberus-tm it is quite easy to detect XPrivacy, but it is impossible for non-root applications to circumvent XPrivacy. Hiding XPrivacy is not a goal of XPrivacy; hiding your privacy sensitive data is.\n. It seems there is not much interest in this addition and since there is also a security concern, I am closing this issue.\n. Randomization takes place here:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/UpdateService.java#L175\nI guess this will not be very helpful to what you want to do (I have an idea about that, given the comment in the other Tasker issue), but thinking about it (I was about to write down the logic in words to help you with this), it would be quite difficult to do this with SQL statements. The checks being done are quite complex (check for random on boot, check for random on access on both global and application level) and generating a random value from SQL will be quite hard if at all possible.\n. I guess this will answer your question:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ33\n. You can disable the restrictions for an application with the on/off switch. Disabling XPrivacy completely requires a reboot.\n. A global disable switch would require an extra check for each and every restriction and would significantly impact overall performance.\n. Please provide a logcat captured during the slowness with XPrivacy debug logging enabled (main settings). \n. The logcat you have sent me almost contains no logging.\n. I have looked through the second provided logcat. XPrivacy is quite fast on your device (mostly fetching restriction settings within a millisecond), but it looks like the application is doing quite some things unnecessary repetitive, as sign of a badly designed application. It seems to be frequently polling things, while a properly designed application would use events. In this way the little overhead XPrivacy introduces, becomes more apparent. Seen from the perspective of XPrivacy there is little that can be done.\n. That would be quite unsafe and is therefore not possible.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Why is that adding to your privacy?\n. This merge request seems to be empty ...\n. @hollal: please only give a +1 if you really need something. The system of +1's was introduced to prevent implementing things that most people don't need.\nThe total now is +2, since I count @an0n981 vote as -1.\n. No problem.\nIf I count right there are now five +1's\n. I am sorry, but there were not enough +1's for this feature request.\n. There is a fairly simple workaround to get this feature:\n- Disable 'restrict dangerous' in the main settings\n- Set the dangerous functions in the template to not restricted\nThis will not change existing restrictions, but even if I had implemented this feature, existing restrictions wouldn't have changed to not cause trouble for existing installations (which there certainly would have been).\n. I am reopening this issue, because I have added a new label 'pullwelcome', which means that despite that there were not ten +1's, a pull request for thoroughly tested code from another developer is welcome. Although I have done almost all the work for this project, I still see XPrivacy as a community project and I don't want to prevent other developers from contributing code. I do reserve the right to deny a pull requests if the quality of the code is insufficient.\n. Recent changes and #1704 makes this feature request obsolete\n. I am not sure what you mean. You have to apply the restrictions yourself with XPrivacy. Please explain in more detail what you mean or what you think went wrong.\n. http://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/ext/com.google.android/android/4.4.2_r1/android/app/ApplicationPackageManager.java/\n. https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ52\n. +1\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=52767556&postcount=9333\n. A note about this request: since there needs to be done an extra check, there will be a performance impact.\n. Test version: http://www.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_2.0.24-2.apk\nPlease report if the port wildcard works for both IP-address and domain names.\nAlso please report if there is a difference in performance.\n. @an0n981 I don't see anything obvious wrong in the code. Basically there is no difference in handling the different types of white/blacklist entries. However, I can imaging conflicting white/blacklist entries for the same restriction. In this case XPrivacy will pick the first one (in the same order as you see them in the on demand restricting dialog). Could you please take a look which white/blacklist entries you have for this application/restriction?\n. I like to see reports about performance for lower end devices too.\n. Another test version: http://www.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_2.0.24-3.apk\nThis version should fix the bug reported by @an0n981 and fixes the defaults for dangerous functions with a whitelist, which means that on demand restricting should by default always be enabled for dangerous functions with a whitelist.\nI think I am going to add a new rule to the +1 system: people that voted +1 on an issue and didn't give feedback on the issue will be excluded from future votes. It is disappointing to see that only @an0n981 is giving feedback here (and contributes other things to this project, like a complete documentation page about the database).\n. Thanks for the feedback.\nYou can review all commits if you like:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/commits/master\nIf you meant if somebody is reviewing my commits: not that I know of at the moment.\nIf you meant the commits were not contributed to this issue: my fault ;-)\n. I forgot to push them, but they are available now.\n. @Magissia one core 700 MHz would be an excellent test case. Please note that Gingerbread is not supported, the minimum Android version is 4.0.3 (ICS).\nIt is not that everybody has to give feedback, but just one person out of eleven giving feedback is quite meager, especially given that there was a call for feedback with a good reason.\n. This feature is part of the today released beta version 2.0.25\n. This has nothing to do with privacy.\n. There is little that can be done from XPrivacy, because the Xposed framework is not running.\nWithout Xposed, XPrivacy is just a regular application.\n. Unfortunately the logcat doesn't reveal the nature of the problem:\n05-10 16:17:51.218 W/PackageManager(  725): Package couldn't be installed in /data/app/biz.bokhorst.xprivacy-1.apk\n05-10 16:17:51.358 D/InstallAppProgress(17211): Installation error code: -24\nIs there enough internal memory to install XPrivacy?\nMaybe one of the hints in this FAQ can help:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ49\n. XPrivacy cannot be installed on the SD card, but needs to be installed in internal memory, which is mostly part of the RAM.\n. So there were some left overs from another try.\nNice, fixed.\n. It is low priority because it is not a fatal bug and because this bug, or more a missing feature, is not caused by a recent change. It is there for quite some time and you are the only one that complained about it.\nPlease note that XPrivacy is free software which I have made, maintain and support in my free time. I try to fix critical bugs ASAP. This isn't a critical bug, which I will fix, but at the time of my own choosing.\n. I consider this as a bug, so no +1's needed.\n. I cannot reproduce this issue, but it could be very well that #1653 also fixed this issue.\n. Please let me know if this issues still exists in version 2.0.23\n. Please tell me exactly how I can reproduce this.\n. Okay, then I misunderstood the issue.\nThis behavior is to be expected.\nThe IP is still whitelisted/blacklisted.\nYou can use whitelist management to delete whitelist entries.\n(non pro users need to clear all restrictions for the application).\n. The white/blacklist is not dependent on on demand restricting being enabled or not.\n. If this is a missing feature or not is debatable. That on demand restricting needs to be enabled to create whitelist entries doesn't necessarily imply that on demand restricting needs to be enabled to apply whitelist entries. Adding this condition will not only make the code more complex (which is at that point already complex enough), but could also affect performance, which are the main reasons I don't want to change this.\n. Maybe it is an idea to show an icon that there are whitelist entries active instead. Any suggestion for an icon is welcome.\n. I was thinking to display a small icon before the check boxes.\nClicking it would open whitelist management for pro version users.\n. Does somebody have a proposal of a free to use icon or can somebody create an icon for this purpose?\n. You mean you want to create an icon during idle time while working I guess ;-)\nMake it the same size as the book icon and it will be okay.\n. The code is finished, so waiting for a holo light and dark icon ...\n. Yes, that is a copy of the info icon I used for testing and needs to be replaced by another icon.\nThere is a light and dark one for the light and dark theme.\n. Yes, that is why I copied the info icon.\nSame size, type and colors to keep it consistent.\nI am curious what symbol you are coming up with ;-)\n. BTW, I have edited your comment, since it contained your e-mail address.\n. That seems to happen if you reply to a GitHub notification (which I never do).\nMaybe it can be changed with a GitHub setting.\n. I have chosen for number six, test version: http://www.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_2.0.26-2.apk\n. Yes, I have made that as well for the convenience of everybody.\nThanks for the icons.\n. Wasn't that the whole point? ;-)\n. I don't like half work ...\n. Sometimes I think it is easier to chat, if you feel the same: GTalk: marcel ... faircode.eu\nReplace ... by an at sign.\n. This problem is reported to be caused by WSM TOOLS.\nI will add this to the compatibility section later.\n. Thanks for your offer, but I don't like Cloudfare is being used.\n. Thanks!\n. I have tested this and it works for me.\n. I can only test on KitKat.\n. Can you please try if this version fixes the problem: http://www.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_2.0.20-2.apk\nThe change might have an impact on the performance, although this will not be dramatically.\n. Better do this right now than getting all kinds of unnecessary complaints and discussions.\nNow every discussion can be closed by pointing to the new version, which saves everybody time.\n. We were surfing on curved waves ;-)\nThanks for bringing this to my attention before the wave broke. It took two commits to fix compatibility with Xposed 2.6. This was caused by a change in Xposed, or better said the revoke of a function that should not have been in Xposed in in the first place.\n. XPrivacy displays a - if a contact has no display name. I can change that to skip contacts without display name. If you scroll diwn, do you eventually find your contacts?\n. This test version should suppress empty contacts: http://www.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_2.0.22-2.apk\n. Please let me know if it does work for you.\n. Thanks for reporting back!\n. /data/system is very secure, basically only Android can access this folder, although this also depends on the file permissions. The file permissions of the database are quite strict:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/PrivacyService.java#L1778\nThe private application data folder is a less secure place to store this information.\nOnly root applications should be your concern regarding this information.\nIt must be included in the export file to make some settings in the export file readable/usable.\n. Except for taking an md5 of the android_id for use with the crowd sourced restrictions, the salt is being used to take an sha1 of the account information (e-mail!) before storing/using the account information, so that your e-mail address is not visible when storing settings about accounts.\n. Image this scenario (others are thinkable): export settings, wipe system, restore Android ID, accounts, etc (for example using Titanium backup), import settings. Importing account settings will not work without salt ...\n. The salt is just a random value, which XPrivacy only generates once, that is concatenated to the strings which are md5 or sha1 hashed (android_id and account info) to make it more difficult to reverse the hash. So, it is not something personally identifying, but it is personal in the sense that you only have that value. It is never exposed, also not while submitting restrictions, which is the whole point: even if the crowd sourced restrictions database gets hacked, it is virtually impossible to reverse the hashed android_id's.\n. Looking it up, it seems you are right, Build.SERIAL is being used as salt. I just remember it differently.\nMaybe it should be changed to a random string, but I have to think about the consequences and it would only be for new users.\n. Did you restart after changing the setting? Did you get the device activation prompt?\n. I will remove the setting from the database in a next version.\n. Thanks!\n. Could you please test if this version works before and after deleting the salt from the database:\nhttp://www.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_2.0.25-4.apk\nTo be tested:\n- Allowed accounts\n- Export/import allowed accounts on the same device\n- Submit/fetch restrictions\n. Yes, if you want.\n. Which is appreciated :+1: \n. Thanks for testing.\nIf it doesn't work after deleting the salt from the database, the stored salt may be different from Build.SERIAL. Could you check this please?\n. ro.serialno may be different from Build.SERIAL, although this would be unusual.\nro.boot.serialno is delivered by the kernel, mostly as start parameter from the bootloader, which mostly reads it from protected read-only memory somewhere in your device (mostly only the manufacturer knows where and how, because the bootloader is often closed source and more and more inaccessible at all, even from kernel space and as a side note, in the past a lot of devices where unlocked by modifying/hacking/bypassing the boot loader in some way, but this is getting increasingly difficult, but fortunately more and more manufacturers provide a way to unlock your device, voiding your warranty, which is stupid and in some countries forbidden by law; personally I would never buy a device where this is not possible).\nAndroid init copies ro.boot.serialno over to ro.serialno.\nFor me it works if I delete the salt from the database (and use the new flush cache button): selected accounts are still selected, also still after boot.\n. Selected accounts management and restrictions using selected accounts use the same sha1 hash function, with the same salt.\nDid you take into account the 15 seconds client side cache? (applied to the salt as well)\n. Then the salt stored in the database is probably different from Build.SERIAL, but this wouldn't explain the account is still selected, unless there are multiple allowed accounts in the database, hashed with a different salt.\nAllowing the GitHub account works for me.\nMaybe delete the allowed accounts from the database and allow them again is a solution.\n. Not directly, but you can try this:\ngetprop | grep serial\nBTW, you can use markdown in comments too.\n. Are you sure you installed the test version and reboot thereafter?\n. I really don't see why it doesn't work for you :-(\nIf the salt in the database is the same as the listed values, it is safe to assume it is Build.SERIAL.\nThe code change is minimal: writing the salt = Build.SERIAL to the database has been replaced by defaulting to Build.SERIAL when reading from the database (so that everything is 100% backward compatible). If you remove the salt from the database, it should be replaced by the default, which should be exactly the same. Check the commit: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/commit/518939b72562dc4a0cf007b8c5ec7cd4a080a745\nMoreover, I tested this with the GitHub application on my device and it works for me.\nOne thought: are you restricting identifications for XPrivacy itself?\n. Maybe a logcat can help.\n. Just opening the app.\nI will check which setting is read for the allowed account.\n. This version prevents restricting the serial number for XPrivacy:\nhttp://www.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_2.0.25-5.apk\nPlease try it before capturing a logcat.\n. I guess I know what the problem is: please try without restricting SERIAL for GitHub.\n. Serial is randomized for 10143:\n05-28 22:04:28.058 I/XPrivacy(2694): get service 10143/SERIAL(null) identification=!restricted? (cached) 0 ms\n05-28 22:04:28.063 I/XPrivacy(5885): get client 10143/SERIAL(null) identification=restricted 1 ms\n05-28 22:04:28.063 I/XPrivacy(5885): get setting uid=10143 /Serial=#Random# 2 ms\n. Of course this is not a fix, but knowing the problem is half the solution.\nActually this has been a privacy leak from the beginning, since any application can read the salt setting and thus get the serial number.\nThe challenge now is to find a way to get a salted hash without lifting the serial restriction, which is more difficult that it appears. I will sleep over this one night like Sherlock smokes his cigars ;-)\n. I have not tested it yet, but this version should work without lifting the serial restriction:\nhttp://www.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_2.0.25-6.apk\nThe privacy leak has been solved by letting the privacy service do the hashing (a one cigar problem ;-) and the salt will automatically be deleted from the database for everybody.\n. Indeed my dear Watson, but this version is tested to be working:\nhttp://www.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_2.0.25-7.apk\n. The application seems not to work with SELinux anymore, which have more and more devices.\nI am happy to add this application to the list when this has been fixed.\n. Formatting using markdown is not difficult, but it needs a little exercise.\nMaybe this guide can help: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\n. Looking at the result, formatting needs some attention IMHO.\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/DATABASE.md\n. This could be related to manipulating the salt in the database or to #1661 \n. Can you please try if this version fixes the problem: http://www.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_2.0.23-2.apk\n. It was not really fixed, I reverted the changes of #1661 \nI will look into that issue later again.\nI wanted to remove the buggy version as soon as I could.\n. If clearing all XPrivacy data solved the problem, then most probably a restriction was the problem.\n. Should be fixed now.\n. I installed a security certificate for another project and I confused IP addresses :-(\n. You can find all my open source Android projects here: https://github.com/M66B?tab=repositories\nI use BackPackTrack myself when I travel, but recent versions are not released to the public. If you want to use it, you'll have to built it yourself. I do not support this project, since it is for my personal use only. Nevertheless it works flawlessly in its current state.\nActivityTracker is a proof of concept of using activity recognition and registering data alongside recognized activities (mainly still, on foot, on bicycle, in vehicle). I have implemented location and hardware step counting, but the framework is suitable for all kind of data, like temperature, pressure, and even stuff like received e-mail or installed applications. It works, but it is a very rough concept, unsuitable for daily usage ATM. I am not sure if and when I will work on this project. I have also used this application to test the corresponding XPrivacy restrictions (even a few times unwillingly). It might replace BackPackTrack one day.\nelement53 might interest you, read the description on my blog and the description in the Play store to know what it does.\nThe new security certificate was for a work related project.\n. Thanks for type for the styling.\nMaybe the warning should be a little smaller (just bold?)\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/DATABASE.md\n. The ADB shell needs root too.\nadb shell\nsu\nsqlite3 /data/system/xprivacy/xprivacy.db\n. Maybe you want to promote this page on XDA now.\n. Any correction is welcome\n. Thanks for your work!\n. You should be able to swipe away the notification. If you can't, it is likely a bug in your ROM.\nYou are the first to complain about this, so this must be a rare bug.\n. No, it can't be disabled. It is there to be able to check if the randomization was done. Normally it can be swiped away after being read.\n. @an0n981 good thinking, but the 100% notification is only shown if randomization has been completed. Moreover, randomization is done after upgrading.\n100% means auto cancel is enabled and ongoing is disabled. Disabling ongoing means the notification can be swiped away. My best guess is that this is a bug in the ROM and can't be fixed by changing XPrivacy.\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/UpdateService.java#L291\n. Notifications before 100% are \"ongoing\", but the 100% notification is just a notification.\nOngoing notification cannot be swiped away, but \"normal\" notifications can.\nI don't know what NotifyClean does, nor will I use it, since it is not open source.\n. \"XPrivacy helpdesk\", I like that ;-)\nI hereby grant you the right to do +2's :-)\nI guess NotifyClean suppresses normal notification, but not ongoing notifications, so the last ongoing notification will be stuck (XPrivacy normally converts the last ongoing notification [<=99%] into a normal notification [100%]).\n. You deserve +2's, given your ongoing support and contributions.\nThen there is a bug in NotifyClean (or missing feature).\n. Thanks again!\n. Nice!\n. It is per license per day.\nAnd there are always people that want to fetch all their 1000 applicaties several times per day ...\n. You can always close your own issues if an issue was solved.\n. The problem with this request is security, see also #1630 \nWe haven't found a workable solution for this.\n. After some thinking, I am going to veto this. I simply don't want external control over XPrivacy restrictions. The potential security disadvantages do not out-weight the advantages, which are probably only for just a few people. I also do not want to support this feature, because it will inevitable result in all kinds of questions.\nI recognize that more advanced users have a use for this. Those users can manipulate the privacy database and for that purpose I will provide a way to clear the XPrivacy service cache. This goes with the note that the database structure might change in the future. I will try to keep the database backward compatibly, but this will not be the highest priority. At this moment I don't see a reason to change the database, but that could change in the future.\n. That is my idea too and since there is now decent documentation, this is within reach of more advanced users without putting a lot of (research) time into it.\n. I am counting six +1's (only @an0n981 is currenly allowed to vote +2 for his contributions to the project).\nPlease note that there is still no good solution for security (except for using an Android permission for the intent). There is no way to identify the sender of an intent, see here for more information about this: http://www.unwesen.de/2011/04/10/android-intent-sender-verification/\n. I am not sure, but maybe a plugin can request additional permissions.\nI will only work on this after the security issue has been resolved.\nWhat we could do is write a small helper app that carries the permission and sends the intent.\n. I have added flushing to the privacy service, added a permission protected intent for it and a button in the main settings menu to fire the intent. This makes it possible to manually flush the cache. I will leave external interfacing by a tasker plugin or a helper application to the community.\nTest version: http://www.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_2.0.25-3.apk\n. Yes, the test version is based on the latest commits and includes the wakelock.\nI think it is good news you didn't found a way around the permission ;-)\n. It should be:\nam startservice -a biz.bokhorst.xprivacy.action.FLUSH\n. Running this as root should work (just tested).\n. If you don't have the permission, you'll need root.\nYou will need this in the manifest file:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/AndroidManifest.xml#L34\nThis is how you can send the intent:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/SettingsDialog.java#L440\nIf you put the source code of the helper app on GitHub I will take a look.\n. You can check the logcat for potential errors.\n. Allow the browser action and you will see: this is a pro feature and you are being redirected to this page: http://www.xprivacy.eu/\n. You'll never have to donate again.\nJust install the same license file again.\n. Thanks for your donation.\nDid you got the license file by e-mail?\n. @Cerberus-tm \nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ18\n. The GPS can easily be faked to be offline, but that is not the purpose of XPrivacy.\n. There is no difference in battery usage with or without XPrivacy, with or without fake locations.\n. @Vankog please note that any feature request needs ten +1's to be considered for implementation.\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support\n. Although I see the advantages of using a coarse location instead of a fine location privacy wise, XPrivacy is not there to solve bugs in other applications.\n. Not to be unfriendly, but XPrivacy is also not there to improve your performance, battery life, etc.\nIf I implement this, everything will work exactly as it did before, only the accuracy of the location will be more coarse. The GPS will still turn on and you will still need a fix to have a fake location.\n. After some more thinking I have decided that I will not implement this. XPrivacy can already do everything to protect your real location. Adding an option to set an alternate accuracy wouldn't add much value and only lead to questions. One of the goals of XPrivacy is to be as simple as possible and that also means as little as possible options. XPrivacy uses the accuracy of the real location to randomize the fake location, which is simple and correct.\nAs said I will not implement things to solve bugs and shortcomings in other applications. The reason for that is, that it would be endless. In general I do not implement application specific things. If there is a bug or shortcoming in an application, you should contact the application developer.\n. The defaults of the restriction engine are not stored into the database to save storage space.\nHowever, it wouldn't harm to add them, if this is more convenient for your custom scripts.\n. On demand popups are global and although I have put quite some effort into this in the past, this cannot be changed.\n. Yes, why not: http://www.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_2.0.25-2.apk\nPlease let me know if it speed things up.\n. Wakelocks should work fine on KitKat.\nOnly reading battery stats by for example wakelock detector requires root.\n. Stock browser = Chrome?\nDoes the browser share its uid with other system components?\nI am afraid Google is connecting to the internet in a non-standard way, by doing direct sysyem call. This will probably end up in the limitations section.\n. 05-25 20:46:35.034 W/XPrivacy(2694): On demand 10071/loadUrl(http://www.xprivacy.eu/) view=!restricted?\n05-25 20:46:35.034 W/XPrivacy(2694): On demanding 10071/loadUrl(http://www.xprivacy.eu/) view=!restricted?\n05-25 20:46:37.404 W/XPrivacy(2694): Blacklisting 10071/loadUrl(http://www.xprivacy.eu/) view=!restricted? xextra=null\n05-25 20:46:37.434 W/XPrivacy(2694): Clearing cache for 10071/android.intent.action.VIEW(null) view=!restricted?\n05-25 20:46:37.439 W/XPrivacy(2694): Clearing cache for 10071/loadUrl(null) view=!restricted?\n05-25 20:46:37.444 W/XPrivacy(2694): Removing 10071:view/loadUrl(http://www.xprivacy.eu/)=true/false\n05-25 20:46:37.444 I/XPrivacy(2694): get service 10071/loadUrl(http://www.xprivacy.eu/) view=!restricted? 2421 ms\n05-25 20:46:37.449 I/XPrivacy/XWebView(7310): get client 10071/loadUrl(http://www.xprivacy.eu/) view=restricted 2424 ms\n05-25 20:46:37.449 I/XPrivacy/XWebSettings(7310): get client 10071/setUserAgentString(null) view=!restricted (cached) 0 ms\nloadUrl is successfully restricted on the client side (browser). No other restrictions are hit soon thereafter, so the stock browser is probably using some (hidden) system service or another system component to load the page.\n. There is another limitation:\n\"You can't set the user-agent string used for XMLHttpRequests made from JavaScript. Those requests always use the default user-agent string.\"\nhttps://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/webview/overview\n. Timeout = deny or allow once (15 seconds)\nDeny or allow depends on your restriction settings.\nThe default is allow.\n. It is longer than 15 seconds, but it will not be changed. The on demand dialog is holding up critical system processes, which can result in reboot problems if this is done too long.\n. An application always needs the system to escape its sandbox. For example contacts and locations are provide by the Android system. No application has access to these on its own for (obvious) security reasons.\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Please read this: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ52\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks again!\n. Good work!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks!\n. Can you please explain in more detail what you mean by this:\n- regulate access to enterprise info, such as exchange accounts\nIt is already possible to restrict accounts and with a pro license to allow selected accounts.\n- better isolation for private management of personal data (private instances of \"cloud\", e.g. owncloud, zarafa, ....)\nI don't see what you exactly want with this.\nI don't want to add a kind of a contact manager to XPrivacy, although that has been asked a few more times, since it is too far from the core function of XPrivacy IMHO. If somebody does a pull request with thoroughly tested code, I will consider to merge it.\n. In theory it is possible to restrict the calendar by account. By default this seems not be enforced by Android for the same user. All calendars stored by the user, regardsless the account, seem to be accessible.\nhttp://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/calendar-provider.html\nFor me this is also to far from the core function of XPrivacy. The number of feature requests have been appeared to be endless and somewhere a line has to be drawn.\n. The same seems to be apply to contacts: no special permissions are required to access contacts stored by another account.\nhttp://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/contacts-provider.html\n. I think @Cerberus-tm suggestion is a pretty good one: setup multiple users on your device to separate private and business. Android isolates users safely and completely (I have researched this extensively to add multi-user support to XPrivacy). There will probably more things then only contacts and calendars you want to seggregate anyway.\nGoogle to enable multi-user support on a phone (can be done simple; I have done this too to test multi-user support) \n. I will add this, but please note the usage data is not accurate in the sense it is not known if the permission or data is really used. For trouble shooting it is however an improvement, so we can at least see if these restrictions were allowed or denied:\n- identification/SERIAL\n- internet/inet (Linux permission)\n- phone/Configuration.MCC\n- phone/Configuration.MNC\n- storage/media (Linux permission)\n- storage/sdcard (Linux permission)\nAny application uses SERIAL and most probably MCC/MNC too.\n. Test version: http://www.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_2.0.27-2.apk\n. Thanks for the update!\n. You need to enable 'restrict dangerous' in the main settings for this. Please be careful not to get in a on demand \"hell\".\n. What you want to do is dangerous and intented only for expert users, hence my comment to be careful.\n. To apply a template with on demand settings, on demand restricting needs to be enabled for the application(s) first. For safety reasons on demand restricting is by default off for existing applications. This is for the best interest of everybody.\nI don't see what importing settings has to do with this.\n. Next version will show these batch operations by default.\nThere are too many questions about this IMHO.\nHopefully everybody understands the red background color.\n. Try to enabled on demand restricting for all applications and you'll see why this is dangerous.\nI could easily bring your device down.\nImport settings will work, I don't see how this is related to this.\n. Test version: https://crowd.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_2.0.27-3.apk\n. Yes, I know.\nI am not sure what to do here.\nI could remove the reddish background color or I could hide the checkbox again.\nOr maybe everybody has to get used to this.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Please provide a logcat with XPrivacy debug logging enabled (main settings).\nThe logcat should contain allowing an account and using the account.\n. The logcat does not contain the information I need.\nDid you reboot after enabling debug logging?\nI have just again tested allowing accounts with the GitHub application and it works as expected.\n. This problem should be solved in version 2.0.28\n. There will be no functions for functions. What you can do is select the clipboard category and then toggle restrictions. The toggle will work on the category only.\n. I will see if I can add 'merge' to toggle restrictions, because it would be useful for cases like this.\n. Test version: https://crowd.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_2.0.27-4.apk\n. New test version to solve problem @an0n981 reported.\nhttps://crowd.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_2.0.27-5.apk\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Remaining logic for system applications:\n- Display reddish background\n- Filter on system applications\nRemaining logic for dangerous methods:\n- Display reddish background\n- Set dangerous function not restricted when restricting category (also when restricting category using on demand restricting, but only if category restriction changes to deny)\n- Migration of legacy XML settings files\n- Dangerous functions will not be selected when selecting the category in the template (unless the function was (un)selected before)\n- Default to unrestricted for dangerous function restrictions which were never set (compatibility)\n- Set newly added dangerous functions as not restricted (update service)\n- Always export dangerous function restrictions (compatibility)\n. There is a problem reported in the test version: if you had enabled 'restrict dangerous' before, all functions were restricted by default. If you never have change the dangerous function restrictions, all dangerous functions will be not restricted in the test version.\n. Existing dangerous restriction will be migrated, so please check if everything is alright after the update service has done its work.\n. You can easily check the logcat yourself.\nBasically dangerous function restrictions which are unset (and formerly defaulted to restricted when 'restrict dangerous' was enabled) and have the category restricted are set to restricted by the upgrade process. Each change is written to the logcat, so you can easily check with the uid of the application if the migration was done.\nBefore the upgrade process the old 'restrict dangerous' setting is used to provide the old default. After the upgrade process the 'restrict dangerous' setting is erased.\n. Actually the template wasn't applied at all, which should be fixed in the just released 2.0.29 test version (I have no time to test, since I have to go).\n. The UI has the same problem. Unfortunately I cannot fix this right away.\n. I believe that the original version is correct.\n. This is native Android behavior.\nThe workaround will probably annoy a lot of people.\nThe export file will be there, so a better workaround is to use a file explorer to open/move the file.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks for this!\n. The usage data is mainly intended for troubleshooting. Since I am afraid that adding filtering beyond filtering on restricted will only raise the number of support questions, I will not merge this, sorry. Most of the harder to find problems seem to be related to system applications/components.\nNevertheless thanks for making the pull request!\n. There were a lot of scroll problems in the past on several devices/ROM, that is why I have reverted all my own improvements, which worked great on my devices, to how Google recommends to handle/optimize scrolling.\n. Why do you want to change this?\nIMHO it is clearer as it is now.\n. This is a good change, but I like the code to be the same as in the XPrivacy Installer: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacyInstaller/commit/45abb3aa523303b8c088fe629c5b7183a450a419\nDon't put it into Util, but just in the sources itself.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Please provide a logcat from boot as explained in the FAQ, question 14, else there is little I can do.\nDon't forget to enable XPrivacy debug logging in the main menu.\n. I need to see a logcat from boot with XPrivacy debugging enabled.\n. Looking at the provided logcat the system server crashes, but unfortunately it is not clear why.\nIt could be a problem in Xposed, but also in XPrivacy.\n. The problem is the same: system server crashes.\nSince the crash also occurs with other modules, my best guess is that this problem is Xposed related.\n.

I don't see any advantages in this: you can disable on demand restricting with a single tap and batch disable on demand restricting for selected applications.\n. Moreover, fetching applications leaves the on demand setting untouched.\n. I will not implement this, since it is a too special case IMHO.\nThis path will implement it, if you want to build a custom version:\n```\ndiff --git a/res/layout/sharelist.xml b/res/layout/sharelist.xml\nindex eebb21c..1d2c212 100644\n--- a/res/layout/sharelist.xml\n+++ b/res/layout/sharelist.xml\n@@ -45,6 +45,14 @@\n                 android:text=\"@string/menu_clear\"\n                 android:visibility=\"gone\" />\n\n<CheckBox\nandroid:id=\"@+id/cbDisableOndemand\"\nandroid:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\nandroid:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\nandroid:checked=\"false\"\nandroid:text=\"@string/title_disable_ondemand\"\nandroid:visibility=\"gone\" />\n+\n             <RadioGroup\n                 android:id=\"@+id/rgToggle\"\n                 android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\ndiff --git a/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/ActivityShare.java b/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/ActivityShare.java\nindex 084369e..4e4b8a8 100644\n--- a/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/ActivityShare.java\n+++ b/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/ActivityShare.java\n@@ -191,6 +191,7 @@ public class ActivityShare extends ActivityBase {\n        RadioButton rbODDisable = (RadioButton) findViewById(R.id.rbDisableOndemand);\n        final Spinner spTemplate = (Spinner) findViewById(R.id.spTemplate);\n        final CheckBox cbClear = (CheckBox) findViewById(R.id.cbClear);\nfinal CheckBox cbDisableOndemand = (CheckBox) findViewById(R.id.cbDisableOndemand);\n        final Button btnOk = (Button) findViewById(R.id.btnOk);\n        final Button btnCancel = (Button) findViewById(R.id.btnCancel);\n\n@@ -279,6 +280,7 @@ public class ActivityShare extends ActivityBase {\n        } else if (action.equals(ACTION_FETCH)) {\n            tvDescription.setText(getBaseURL(ActivityShare.this));\n            cbClear.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);\n+           cbDisableOndemand.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);\n    } else if (action.equals(ACTION_TOGGLE)) {\n        tvDescription.setText(R.string.menu_toggle);\n\n@@ -349,7 +351,9 @@ public class ActivityShare extends ActivityBase {\n                        if (uids.length > 0) {\n                            mRunning = true;\n                            cbClear.setEnabled(false);\n-                           new FetchTask().executeOnExecutor(mExecutor, cbClear.isChecked());\n+                           cbDisableOndemand.setEnabled(false);\n+                           new FetchTask().executeOnExecutor(mExecutor, cbClear.isChecked(),\n+                                   cbDisableOndemand.isChecked());\n                        }\n                    }\n@@ -1251,6 +1255,7 @@ public class ActivityShare extends ActivityBase {\n            try {\n                // Get data\n                boolean clear = params[0];\n+               boolean disableOndemand = params[1];\n                List lstApp = mAppAdapter.getListAppInfo();\n            int userId = Util.getUserId(Process.myUid());\n\n@@ -1356,6 +1361,11 @@ public class ActivityShare extends ActivityBase {\n                                PrivacyManager.setSetting(appInfo.getUid(), PrivacyManager.cSettingModifyTime,\n                                        Long.toString(System.currentTimeMillis()));\n\n// Disable on demand restricting if requested\nif (disableOndemand)\nPrivacyManager.setSetting(appInfo.getUid(), PrivacyManager.cSettingOnDemand,\nBoolean.toString(false));\n+\n                                setState(appInfo.getUid(), STATE_SUCCESS,\n                                        !newState.equals(oldState) ? getString(R.string.msg_restart) : null);\n                            } else {\n```\n. Thanks for the update!\n. What is wrong with the default location?\n\nI want as little as possible options.\nAnother thing is that Android doesn't have a folder select dialog and I rather don't want to use custom components to not run into problems in the future.\nI am the only one who can assign labels.\n. IMHO this change is not needed for most users, furthermore I like to keep things as simple as possible and Android has no standard provision to select folders.\n. I will set the current version after import to fix this problem.\n. The disadvantage of setting the latest version after import is that no upgrade will be done when it is needed. Maybe a check box \"upgrade\" will do, so that it is optional.\n. The question is can LBE be made compatible with XPrivacy and are the authors of LBE (closed source) willing to help with this. See also the limitations section.\n. XPrivacy does never automatically download crowd sourced restrictions.\nInstalling a new application will result in applying the first template.\nUpdating an installed application will enable on demand restricting to cope with the now more hidden permission changes, see also the changelog.\n. The installation instructions say to start XPrivacy once after installation and then reboot, so try that.\n. https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#installation\n. This problem has puzzled me quite some time, but the explanation is quite simple. Android puts new applications into a special dormant state where they do nothing at all, until the user starts the application. XPrivacy needs an event from the system to set things right, but won't get it until the dormant state is lifted. That is the reason you have to start XPrivacy once before rebooting.\n. For the benefit of all, questions should be asked in the forum.\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/modules/test-xprivacy-2-0-37-ultimate-privacy-t2320783\n. Whitelists are category/function based (there are more types of whitelists), so displaying whitelists in the main application list is not very useful IMHO. Moreover, it would make the main application list slower, because a lot more settings needs to be evaluated.\n. FAQs are referenced by number and should therefore not be renumbered.\n. Thanks!\n. Great!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. The on demand restricting settings are not modified, on demand restricting is solely enabled for the application on application update.\n. Which restriction(s)?\n. So, you didn't try 2.1.26?\n. It is unlikely that XPrivacy is causing this issue, unless you restricted the applications with XPrivacy.\nCheck if you restricted internet and/or shell/load...\n. Else provide a logcat with XPrivacy debugging enabled.\n. I am not seeing any XPrivacy problems or restrictions.\nTry with XPrivacy disabled in Xposed.\n. Check the usage data for restrictions imposed (main menu), especially in system applications/components.\nElse clear the privacy database from the menu (this will erase all settings!)\n. My best guess this is a timing issue and if so, this cannot be fixed.\n. Logcat are read through the shell, so no special restriction is needed for this.\nExample:\nhttps://github.com/nolanlawson/Catlog\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Try again with the latest stable, but wait until the update service has completed before drawing conclusions.\nEven if this doesn't work (it should), then you can use the new template merge option, perhaps using one of the alternate templates, to restrict all dangerous functions.\n. Do you have the setting 'restrict dangerous' enabled?\n. I really don't understand why the update for you isn't working.\nI will think about it.\n. Can you please try if this version fixes your problem:\nhttps://crowd.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_2.1.5-3.apk\n. Can you please try this version instead:\nhttps://crowd.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_2.1.5-4.apk\n. The default is to restrict on demand for all categories.\nEnabling on demand restricting does not change the on demand settings for the categories.\nVersion 2.1.5 should fix the on demand restricting problems that were reported.\n. This is how Android in general works. There is no OK or Cancel, things are applied right away. That is why the button says Done instead. XPrivacy follows this pattern everywhere.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. You can track the application state using the color left in the application list.\nFetched restrictions will be shown as orange.\nThe next version will display gray when clearing all restrictions.\n(from the application list in category all mode or using the menu toggle restrictions)\n. You can already do that with for example Tasker:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ5\n. I cannot test with GoPro, so please provide a logcat.\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ14\n. The command line of your PC is meant.\n. I have checked the provide logcat.\nThere are no XPrivacy warnings or errors or anything unusual.\nMaybe it is a timing problem.\nMy advice is to ask the author to look into this, since it can be a latent problem that manifests itself when using XPrivacy.\nI am happy to cooperate, but at this moment there is little I can do, sorry.\n. If you want you can try to disable restrictions at boot with this test version:\nhttps://crowd.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_2.1.12-6.apk\nYou will need to create this file on your device:\n/data/system/xprivacy/disabled\nEach line should contain a category name or a category name and a function name.\nYou can do this like this from your PC:\nadb shell\nsu\ncd /data/system/xprivacy\necho \"ipc\" >disabled\necho \"system.getInstalledProviders\" >>disabled\nYou can find all categories and function names in this file:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/Meta.java\n. disabled needs to be a file.\nEach line should contain a restriction category to disable.\n. This version has been superseded by the latest test version. I don't know which category to try either. There won't be a simple on/of switch for this, because it is only for testing purposes.\n. You just need to put the category name into the file, not the command.\n. Make absolutely sure the file is in the folder /data/system/xprivacy and that there is exactly one category name on each line, without any leading and/or trailing spaces. The category names are case sensitive and can be taken from here: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/PrivacyManager.java#L37\nYou need a recent version of XPrivacy to be able to use this new feature.\nThe latest beta version is a safe bet: http://repo.xposed.info/module/biz.bokhorst.xprivacy\n. Try this in the terminal app:\nsu\nls -al /data/system/xprivacy\nand post the output here\n. Any Android terminal app from the Pay store will do.\n. Sorry, I missed your message.\nI don't see the file disabled in the directory listing, so I guess you have put this file into the wrong folder.\n. /data/system/xprivacy/disabled\nis not the same as\n/storage/sdcard0/data/system/xprivacy/disabled\n...\n. Good, now we know the category of functions causing the problem.\nYou can now try to narrow down the problem to the function, by disabling individual functions.\nPut for example this in the disabled file:\ninternet.getAllByName\nSee here for a list of all internet methods:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/Meta.java#L119 \n. Are you sure you didn't restrict internet.connect for the application?\nThe code to restrict this function is quite transparent and I see nothing obviously wrong and if there was something wrong, there would be a lot of trouble:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XIoBridge.java#L67\n. You can also check the logcat while this problem occurs.\n. Thanks for your patience so far.\nUnfortunately I am unable to test this.\nYou can try this test version, where resolving the host name has been disabled:\nhttps://crowd.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_2.1.22-7.apk\nPlease note that this is my development version, which needs more testing, since the location restrictions were completely rewritten.\n. We are not there yet, because I have disabled a feature, which would be missed by a lot of people.\nCould you please try this version too:\nhttps://crowd.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_2.1.22-8.apk\n. If 2.1.22-8 does not work for you (but please test it to exactly diagnose the problem), you can install this test version:\nhttps://crowd.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_2.1.22-9.apk\nTo have it work for you from this version, you'll need to insert a setting into the privacy database:\ninsert into setting (uid, type, name, value) values (0, '', 'NameResolve', 'false');\nSee here for more information about how to access the privacy database:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/DATABASE.md\n. Can you please try the just released test version 2.1.14 and let me know if it works with/without noresolve quirk?\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/releases/tag/2.1.24\nSee also the release announcement:\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/modules/test-xprivacy-2-0-37-ultimate-privacy-t2320783/post54076739\n. Can you please try with the quirk \"noresolve\" (main settings) and let me know if this fixes the problem?\n. Can you please try with 2.1.26 too, since that will probably the next stable release.\nI would like to know if it works with and without the quirk (reboot after changing the quirk to be sure).\n. The quirk noresolve is reported to fix the problem, so make sure you entered this quirk correctly (if you visit the settings again it should 'stick'). Wait at least 30 seconds before trying again or better reboot.\n. @ngvincent which XPrivacy version are you using? With the most recent versions of XPrivacy this should work out-of-the-box.\n. On demand restricting is turned on on update in recent versions. This feature will be removed from version 2.1.8\n. Thanks!\n. Maybe you want to translate these too: whitelist_method, title_toggle_dangerous, title_usage_xxx, title_default and title_alternate.\n. Thanks again!\n. @vibes340 there is no old behavior, only the style of the on demand dialog was changed in an attempt to solve the dialog from freezing (which unfortunately failed).\n. I am not going to change it back, why do you want that? What is the advantage of the previous version? Did you try the latest XPrivacy version?\n. Can you please try if this version fixes the problem?\nhttps://crowd.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_2.1.13-3.apk\n. Do you see any on demand restricting dialog with a red background?\n. I like to stress that there is no old behavior, this was broken on versions before too, see also the limitations section: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#limitations\n. I really don't know how to fix this and to be honest I don't believe it does work in previous versions. It is just the freeze problem I have spent really many hours trying to fix. The current implementation is better than the previous implementation, because all window attributes can be manipulated. It was quite some work to convert and unless there are very good reasons I am not going to change it back.\nMaybe you can find a fix. The relevant code starts here:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/PrivacyService.java#L1455\nThe window layout parameters are documented here:\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowManager.LayoutParams.html\n. @vibes340 can you please try if this version improves things?\nhttps://crowd.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_2.1.16-3.apk\n. http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2014/06/android-l-developer-preview-and-android.html\n. Unfortunately no details available yet:\nhttp://developer.android.com/preview/api-overview.html\nAt a first glance the following need attention:\n- Camera API (CaptureListener): restricted\n- ~~Multiple network connections (NetworkCallbackListener)~~\n- ~~Possibly Bluetooth broadcasting~~\n- ~~NFC enhancements~~\nCheck:\n- getExternalMediaDirs()\n. Will XPrivacy work with ART?\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ75\n. To do:\n- Test new camera restrictions\n- Check android.content.Context.getExternalMediaDirs()\n- Check http://developer.android.com/preview/api-overview.html\n- Check new APIs\n. API changes: http://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-5.0.html\n. I have researched all of the about 5000 new Android 5.0 (Lollipop) APIs!\nList new Android Lollipop APIs\ncd ./adt/sdk/docs/reference/android && grep -Rls \"<div class=\\\"jd-details api apilevel-21\\\"\" . | sed \"s*\\./*https://developer.android.com/reference/android/*g\"\nAPIs to look further into\nhttps://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html (use ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE for export?)\nhttps://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/TelephonyManager.html (restrict ICC commands?)\nhttps://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/CameraManager.html (restrict openCamera?)\n. Check AOSP mode Android 5.0\nDone!\n. Except for testing, this is done!\n. This won't happen anymore in the latest version.\n. Without a logcat there is nothing I can do.\n. You can use gist to paste the logcat too and reference it from here.\nBe sure to enable XPrivacy debug logging before capturing a log and please keep the logcat as short as possible. Finding a problem in megabytes of log lines is hard ...\n. There is nothing about XPrivacy in the logcat.\nDid you enable XPrivacy debugging in the XPrivacy main settings?\n. Unfortunately I cannot find anything wrong in the logcat.\nNo warning, no errors, no crashes, nothing unusual.\nPlease try again with the version I will release today, maybe some of the changes I did will fix this.\n. What exactly is the error message shown?\n.

Unfortunately Play services classes are obfuscated now, so it may not be possible to restrict this.\n. @Cerberus-tm yes, it will probably be all at once :-(\n. XPrivacy is not there to put/keep an application (component) in disabled state.\nXPrivacy should be able to protect your privacy while the application is running.\nIf there are shortcoming in this, I am happy to investigate.\n. Yes, good, this question is being asked often.\n. Unfortunately Play services classes are obfuscated now, so it may not be possible to restrict this.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for this big update!\n. If you don't have a pro license yet, please contact me using this contact form to get one free for your contribution.\n. I don't think this deviates from the general logic of XPrivacy.\nYou first have to restrict contacts and then you can white list one or more contacts.\n(the same applies to accounts and applications).\nNote that most applications asks for a list of all contacts and since people mostly have a lot of contacts stored it is not possible to use on demand to allow/deny each contact individually.\n. That may be true, but it can't be done, see my earlier comment for why.\n. Your flow is almost correct, but all packages are queried in one go, see here.\nSo, unless XPrivacy is going to ask to allow or deny each application in the resulting list, this cannot work.\n. If I am really bored I might implement this, but it has a low priority.\nThe basic concept of XPrivacy is to deny everything and make exceptions, not the other way around.\n. Test version:\nhttps://crowd.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_2.1.20-4.apk\nPlease note that I didn't test this yet, so please test for accounts, application and contacts in whitelist mode and blacklist mode. You can check the mode using the application specific settings.\nIn am still thinking if I am going to include this feature or not.\n. I don't want this feature be generally available, since there are privacy risks.\nThis means you will need to enable this feature by creating this file:\n/sdcard/.xprivacy/blacklist\n(contents do not matter)\n. @BlueMax \nThe next version will always show the whitelist icon in blacklist mode.\nAutomatically whitelist, that would be good for privacy ...\n. New test version:\nhttps://crowd.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_2.1.20-6.apk\n. The whitelist icon should not vanish in blacklist mode.\nDid you create this file?\n/sdcard/.xprivacy/blacklist\nand changed the application setting to enable blacklisting?\n. It isn't complex, on the contrary, but I am glad you understand my concerns now.\nI will leave it like it is, unavailable for the casual user, unless you create a specific file.\n. This has already been explained several times on the XDA forum.\nJust send the support info and the popup will be gone in the next release.\nDon't worry to much about this, most of these internal errors are harmless.\n. There is already a warning for that: restricting system applications is dangerous and marked with a reddish background for this reason.\n. If you want to maintain a list of those restrictions you are welcome, but IMHO this is not doable. There are simply to many applications for Android available. This is one of the reason there is and will be nothing application specific in XPrivacy.\ninet is dangerous for a very good reason. A lot of applications crash if you use this restriction and the connect restriction is mostly a better alternative.\nYou can define your own dangerous functions by long pressing the function name in the template.\n. Internet/connect is excepted for on demand restricting, so you can choose which address to allow or deny. On demand restricting is enabled by default for newly installed applications.\nActually there is a list of application specific settings, called the crowd sourced restrictions.\nIf you want to help others, please submit your restrictions.\n. I don't want to maintain an application specific restriction list, it will be a moving target anyway. I already spend enough time developing, maintaining and supporting XPrivacy.\nRestricting system applications, and all those mentioned here are system applications, is for more expert users only. By default system applications are filtered out of the application list.\n. Test version:\nhttps://crowd.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_2.1.20-1.apk\nSend intent:\nadb shell am start -a biz.bokhorst.xprivacy.action.EXPORT -e FileName /sdcard/test.xml\nSpeficying a file name will work for import and export.\n. Just specify an extra with the name FileName and a value with the desired file name.\nYou can run am from the terminal too, just omit adb shell from the command.\n. Try as superuser.\n. I have tested it and it works for me.\nDid you install 2.1.20-1 ?\n. The intent works for me without root.\n. It doesn't matter where the intent comes from.\nIt is even no possible to see in an application where an intent is coming from.\n(an annoyance to some developers, but this is how Android was designed)\n. You should not use a shell command, see FAQ5 for how to setup the Tasker intent (only the extra is not documented yet, since I don't know how this needs to be done in Tasker, which I don't use myself).\nPlease note that in the next release the file name extra for the IMPORT intent will be removed, since it is a security risk. An application could send an intent with to disable its restriction without user intervention else.\n. Please let me know how to specify the file name extra in Tasker, so I can document it.\n. If that needs to be specified: the extra type is string.\n. The IMPORT intent stays, but you cannot use the file name extra.\nIf you can enable/disable internet for the application with an intent, the application can do too.\n. That is not what I meant.\nIf you can send an intent (with Tasker or otherwise), the application itself could send the intent as well.\nThis would enable any application to simply disabled XPrivacy restrictions, which is what we absolutely not want.\n. How about:\nFileName:/sdcard/test.xml\n. You can manually select a file for the IMPORT intent.\n. @OyyoDams this is not what XPrivacy is designed for.\n. As soon as F-Droid allows me to sign XPrivacy with my own private key I will do this.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks!\n. There is in-app help available for each function.\nTap on the book icon before the function name to see it.\nOften it links to the mostly excellent Google documentation about the function.\nIf you have questions about functions, I am happy to explain things in on the XDA forum, so others can read it too.\n. There is a test version here:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/releases/tag/2.1.21\n(you need to download 2.1.21-4 to have the committed change)\n. Thanks for the fix/addition!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Regular users can mostly easily figure out how XPrivacy works, so you as developer should certainly be able to do this. Hint: look into the usage data of the application for things that are being restricted and check the restrictions in the phone category of XPrivacy.\nQuestions should be asked in the XDA forum:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support\n. This is not possible, since the uid is not always the same when an application is installed again.\nXPrivacy works with uids and not with package names, because package names are not known deep within Android and will cause problems with multi-users (the package name is the same, but the uid is different).\n. People expect the settings to be gone after removing an application.\nNote that updating an application does not erase the existing settings. Your development environment should not delete and install, but update.\n. You were too fast, most of the updated texts were not complete yet.\nI have just checked in the completed category help texts.\nCan you please make a new pull request?\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ52\n. Questions should be asked in the XDA forum:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support\n. \"Restart required\" can be displayed for a lot of applications when using a batch operation.\nToo much to display all the application/package names.\nKilling an application might result in data lose.\n. I don't know why, but only the default English missed 'Application'. \n. I will do a replace on all translations.\n. do not what?\n. Please try this version:\nhttps://crowd.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_2.1.22-9.apk\n. Please let me know if you still have this issue with the just released version 2.1.24.\n. Fixed, thanks.\n. Blacklist it is.\n. If you try the latest development version (referenced from one of your other issues), you will see there is decent category help now.\nThe on demand restricting dialog is designed to display on top of everything, so the browser window being below it is by design.\nThe function restrictions are for expert users and as an aid I have referenced the relevant documentation. I am not going to add detailed documentation for each of the almost 250 restricted functions, because it is simply too much work and expert users are supposed to known what they are doing.\nSince XPrivacy is a community project, you are free to write the function documentation and to do a pull request. The function help is here:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/res/values/functions.xml\nThere are a lot of /proc entries, that is why I have referenced the /proc main documentation.\n. Questions should be asked in the XDA forum.\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support\n. It is not a bug.\n. Disable all your filters and check the in-app help.\n. It is not that I want to be unfriendly, but answers to questions can be beneficial for more people.\n. Moreover, in the XDA forum more people can answer your questions.\nAs you can imagine I put a lot of effort in developing and supporting XPrivacy and I get a lot of requests/inquiries/questions. In the interest of everybody it is best if I concentrate on development.\n. Thanks!\nDocumentation is as important as source code to me, so this kind of updates are appreciated.\n. Google Maps API v1 is quite ancient, so I am not sure if I will add restrictions for it.\n. Thanks for the translation update and helping others with it!\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. I will need more details then only log lines.\nLike XPrivacy version, application to test with, what were you doing, ROM version, etc, anything that can help diagnose this. I don't have this problem and to fix it I need to reproduce it.\n. The log lines above provide don't reveal any problem, so provide more logging.\nSearch for the uid of Whatsapp in the logcat.\n. Are you aware that some of the phone/calling restrictions were moved? (see changelog)\n. I have just tested Whatsapp and everything works for me.\nI get on demand restricting for everything and can block calling.\n. I don't see how this is related to XPrivacy.\nDid you try if this problem is solved when XPrivacy is disabled?\n. How much trouble is it to toggle the check box once after reboot?\nThe expert mode check box in the settings has a specific function.\n. Why am I hopeless?\n. Why am I hopeless?\n. Good explanation, please take my last message on XDA not personally.\nIt is just that these little annoyances accumulated and I have learned it is better to express what I feel.\n. No promises, but I will see what I can do.\n. You can check if it works with version 2.1.26 -2 from here:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/releases/tag/2.1.26\n. This is a common problem: wait until Xposed says \"new module\" before rebooting.\n. I will take a more detailed look at this pull request later.\nAndroid activities are managed by an activity stack.\nLeaving an activity will show the previous activity from the stack.\nWhen starting the usage activity directly, there will be no parent (although that is not exactly true, but in any case the XPrivacy main activity will not be the parent; despite what the XPrivacy manifest says).\nThis is just how Android works, and it even differs slightly over different Android versions.\nAlthough it is possible to have an influence on the activity stack from within XPrivacy, I don't want to change a thing to the current customizations, since it took quite some effort to get everything right (do you remember that tapping a notification sometimes showed the wrong application settings?).\n. I have revised, simplified, extended your documentation:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ66\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Thanks for the update and in time for the stable release!\n. I don't see the added value, but maybe I am wrong.\nIMHO it is common knowledge what a check mark means.\nThe description 'is restricted' or 'is fully restricted' would be confusing, since check boxes are used for other things too.\nThe next step would be to add an unchecked check box, the collapse/fold symbol, the back key, etc. I don't think this is a good idea.\n. I am open to arguments here in this issue.\nRestricting is all what XPrivacy is about, so I don't see where the \"extra cognitive load\" is coming from.\n. I have another argument against this.\nThere is a title that clear describes what a check mark does: Check to restrict\nNevertheless, you can always try to convince me with other arguments.\n. Thanks, but this should not be needed.\nI never had a problem if I waited for the Xposed update notification.\nMaybe some edge cases will remain, but I don't think we should bother people with this.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. This is probably not caused by XPrivacy, but will delay/freeze the UI:\nI/Choreographer(18369): Skipped 381 frames!

I think I should go work for Tapatalk, ... ow wait .., I like developing software more than festivals ;-)\n. There is nothing changed that could make the lag longer, so I guess this is coincidence/perception.\n. Anyway, I will think about this and sleep a night over it, since I have no idea what could be causing this.\nIt should be noted thatTapatalk is the only application which seems to be affected and with currently almost 7500 downloads of the new stable release it is not very probable this is caused by XPrivacy, although I am also not very sure about it.\n. 07-18 20:09:14.822 D/dalvikvm(16567): GC_FOR_ALLOC freed 329K, 5% free 61886K/64564K, paused 104ms, total 105ms\nThis means memory is low (after garbage collection 5% remaining), which could also be a cause for this issue.\nWhich device are you using and how much internal memory does it have?\nFormerly XPrivacy did not cache restrictions/settings for low end devices, but this has been changed: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/commit/7f3181f2ee6c596f5e8d11678c1de5beb7b87cb7.\nThis benefits performance, but will use more memory.\n. Another theory to the garbage bin ...\n. Garbage bin it is.\n. There have been a lot of changes since version 2.1.6 in about 20 intermediate releases. It would help a lot to know which version introduced the problem.\nAll intermediate versions are available here:\nhttp://repo.xposed.info/module/biz.bokhorst.xprivacy\nIf you are smart you only need to install and test with 5 versions to know which one contain the change that causes the problem ...\n. Looking through the many changes from version 2.1.6 to 2.1.8 I have identified two suspicion changes:\n- Restriction IPC.Reflection\n- The new Java IPC checks\nSince the IPC.Reflection is not reallly necessary anymore, I have removed it.\nFurthermore I have added a new quirk \"nojavaipc\".\nSo, please try this test version, first without the new quirk and then with the new quirk:\nhttps://crowd.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_2.2-4.apk\nTo be sure, check if the quirk sticked after enter it by returning to the settings dialog once more and reboot after entering or removing it.\n. Thanks for the testing!\n. Test version:\nhttps://crowd.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_2.2.1-1.apk\n. Restricting locations for Elixir 2 and Network Info 2 works for me. Google Maps can be restricted by restricting get...Provider functions.\nXPrivacy already hooks the public Play services functions, so there is little more I can do. Nothing is broken, there are just limits to what can be done.\nThis could all be fixed in XPrivacy 3, but I am still not willing to work on a mega new project. There are simple not enough XPrivacy users to justify this.\n. This is the Play services location API documentation:\nhttps://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/location/package-summary.html\nThe classes ActivityRecognitionClient and LocationClient are hooked by XPrivacy.\nThese classes are deprecated, because they are being replaced by Play services 5.0 classes.\nI will restrict the Play services location classes of Play services 5.0 as soon as Google releases the Play services 5.0 SDK, see also #1774 \nA little bit more detail: this is what happens:\nApplication process ->uses-> Play services library ->calls-> Play services process ->calls-> Android location service\nThe Play services process is a separate process with its own uid, different from the uid from the application.\nThe problem is that the Play services library and Play services process source code is not open source.\nThis means that XPrivacy can only restrict access to the Play services by restricting the Play services public API. XPrivacy can however restrict the Play services process from getting locations from the Android location services, because it uses the public location manager API (so far).\nXPrivacy 3 could with a lot of effort restrict the location service process itself from delivering locations. This would not solve your problem, because there is no way to tell to which application the Play services process will delivery the locations to, so it would still be an all or nothing.\nXPrivacy 3 is a lot of effort, because the location service is different with each ROM version and could be modified by custom ROM developers too. There are even obfuscated ROMs, for which XPrivacy 3 would not be able to do anything.\nThe above applies to other system services, like the account service, too.\n. One addition: Play services 5.0 is not being used by any application yet, except maybe for applications provided by Google, since no third party developer has access to the new SDK yet.\n. I will not be working on XPrivacy 3, sorry.\nI will however continue to support XPrivacy 2.\n. If I get funded $1,5M, like Yo, but else I wouldn't hold your horses.\n. I cannot reproduce this problem.\nI have recently tested with this app.\nXPrivacy introduces some overhead, which will be more apparent on lower end devices.\nNothing can be changed to address this.\nOne thing: are you using version 2.2.1?\nThere were some delays/freezes in version 2.2.\n. Check if some of the restrictions you have applied is causing this, else I have no idea how to help you, since for me this works okay.\n. @dustylinds1 As I said before, I cannot reproduce this issue. I have a position fix in mere seconds and the compass is moving fast and without hick ups. Maybe a logcat will help.\n. I agree with @an0n981 \n. Nevertheless thanks for trying to help improve XPrivacy.\n. The current architecture allows passing one extra to the service only.\nAdding the numeric transaction code to existing extra would mean redoing all white/black lists.\nAs a compromise I have added an extra log line with the transaction code.\n. Waze crashes in native code, so it is not the restriction / fake value in itself which causes the crash.\nMy best guess is that Waze checks the Android ID and potentially other things in native code and does an hard exit (=crash) if it detects something wrong.\nI/XPrivacy/XSettingsSecure( 5486): get client 10094/getString(null) identification=restricted 2 ms\nI/XPrivacy( 5486): get setting uid=10094 /ID=#Random# 1 ms\nW/dalvikvm( 5486): Invalid indirect reference 0x43597b10 in decodeIndirectRef\nI/dalvikvm( 5486): \"Native Thread\" prio=5 tid=12 RUNNABLE\nI/dalvikvm( 5486):   | group=\"main\" sCount=0 dsCount=0 obj=0x42bc1d10 self=0x41c86848\nI/dalvikvm( 5486):   | sysTid=5505 nice=-8 sched=0/0 cgrp=apps handle=1496636984\nI/dalvikvm( 5486):   | state=R schedstat=( 382803677 53018659 585 ) utm=26 stm=12 core=2\nI/dalvikvm( 5486):   at com.waze.NativeManager.AppStartNTV(Native Method)\nI/dalvikvm( 5486):   at com.waze.NativeManager.access$3(NativeManager.java:3783)\nI/dalvikvm( 5486):   at com.waze.NativeManager$1.run(NativeManager.java:2655)\nI/dalvikvm( 5486):   at com.waze.NativeManager$NativeThread.onLooperPrepared(NativeManager.java:2579)\nI/dalvikvm( 5486):   at android.os.HandlerThread.run(HandlerThread.java:60)\nI/dalvikvm( 5486): \nE/dalvikvm( 5486): VM aborting\nF/libc    ( 5486): Fatal signal 11 (SIGSEGV) at 0xdeadd00d (code=1), thread 5505 (Native Thread)\nI/XPrivacy( 2924): get service uid=1000 IPAddress/server-54-230-77-58.cdg50.r.cloudfront.net:80=null 1 ms\nI/XPrivacy( 2924): get service 1000/connect(server-54-230-77-58.cdg50.r.cloudfront.net:80) internet=!restricted?

Thanks for the translation update!\n. Thanks for the update!\n. I am afraid this will impact performance too much. It means that all white list entries needs to be checked both globally and application specific. That is a lot of extra tests, since these test always take place (regardless if there is a white/black list entry) for all applications.\n. The fake values of an application always override the global fake values.\nYou can easily see which application specific values were entered in the application specific settings.\n. Thinking about this, I don't think this is going to work. All application specific settings needs to be checked while building the main list. The main list isn't very fast already and this would slow down things even more.\n. With a little trick I could increase performance enough to make this feasible.\nIt takes a little of the space from the application name though, but I guess that out weights the usefulness.\n. This feature is in version 2.99.34\n. Thanks\n. Which XPrivacy version are you using?\nDid you enter any quirk into the main settings?\n. If you don't understand the question, I know the answer, so don't worry about it.\nUnfortunately this problem can't be fixed, see here for more details:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#limitations\n. Yes, there is no other way.\n. getPackageInfo cannot be used to enumerate applications, since it returns information about one package only. Moreover, to prevent getting information about a single package would mean restricting a lot more PackageManager functions.\n. Please note that there are many more methods to check if a package is installed.\nIt would be a performance hit if they were all hooked.\nNevertheless I guess the two hooked functions will probably cover most cases.\nNote that these two new restrictions only work in AOSP mode (not in compatibility mode) and only for version 2.99.30 or later)\n. The new hooks are in version 2.99.30, can you please check if it works for Play store?\n. You can setup a global fake data and make exceptions for individual applications.\nThis is how it works, and this will not be changed, sorry.\n. I have just updated the text to make it clearer for novice users: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/commit/604918e7d616bd0dce0ca8a4564d73fd095afcbe\n. Thanks!\n. Do you get a sub-menu when you select 'Select contacts to allow?'\n. Did you restrict something in the contact category for XPrivacy itself?\n. What do you mean by 'Internet link' ?\nWhat happens if you select 'Alle Einstellungen' ?\n. You need a pro license for that feature.\n. The XPrivacy Pro license available through a PayPal or Bitcoin donation below allows you to:\n- Import and export XPrivacy settings across devices *\n- Access the crowd sourced restrictions\n- Allow selected applications and contacts\n- View function parameters in the usage data list (IP addresses, file names, etc)\n- Manage white/black listed files, (IP) addresses, domain names, commands, libraries and URLs\n- Execute batch operations (toggle restrictions for multiple applications: clear/restrict, apply template, etc)\n- Use the pro features without internet connection\n- Use the pro features without Google accounts/applications\n- Use all future pro features\n- Use an unofficial XPrivacy version, for example the Gingerbread version\n. I think it is clear enough this way, but I will see what I can do. You can acquire a pro license on the website you are being redirected to.\n. Is the license recognized correctly? (check in 'about')\n. What happens if you select 'Alle einstellungen' now ?\n. I mean 'Select contacts to allow' and then 'all' to be clear.\n. Please read this:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support\n. 1. This is by design, dangerous functions needs to be restricted manually on a case by case basis\n2. If you use on demand restriction, all restrictions are allowed by default, this is also by design\n3. Function restrictions are exceptions to category exceptions, so this is not possible\n4. Defining dangerous restrictions should be done on a case by case basis\n5. This will be fixed in the next release, see changelog\n6. See the description, in short: 'all' shows if all categories are selected, not if all functions in all categories are selected, this would be very slow\n. I guess that can be done, but that is not what XPrivacy is for.\n. InetAddress.getByAddress has two variants, one with a binary address and one with a hostname and a binary address as parameter. The hostname is on a whitelist.\nWhitelists are grouped by application and whitelist type and there are are other functions with a hostname as parameter.\nYou can lookup the whitelist types here:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/Meta.java\n. It is not possible to convert one cell location type from one into the other, which means the phone type should not be restricted, which means there need to be different types of device numbers, depending on the phone type. So, different settings needs to be added/used.\nThis has no high priority for me, because the existing logic existed for about a year without complaints and will affect only specific applications. A tested pull request is however welcome.\n. I have allowed entering a MEID and removed getNetworkType and getPhoneType, since these restrictions were only there to force a GSM to fake an IMEI.\nThis is also in the spirit of FAQ25.\n. Thanks!\n. Please read this to know where to ask questions:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support\n. I don't see a MAC address in the URL bar at all.\nHow can I reproduce this?\nWhich MAC address is shown?\n(there are several on your device)\n. You cannot restrict the external MAC address, see also this FAQ: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ33\n. The Wi-Fi provider probably sees the MAC address in the radio packets and feeds it back in the URL.\nThe external MAC address cannot be faked (at least not by XPrivacy, maybe it can be changed system wide with WPA supplicant low level commands or by changing values in the firmware). Please not that changing the external MAC address may be a crime. XPrivacy can fake values to application only and is perfectly able to present an application with a fake MAC address.\n. Not all countries are a \"normal country\" ...\n. Which XPrivacy and Android version are you using?\n. Looking at the log provided, my best guess is that this is a bug in your ROM.\n. Looking a little deeper into this, I suspect you are not using the latest version of XPrivacy (which is not the cause of the problem, nor will the latest version solve it, but it doesn't hurt to try).\nXPrivacy references an Android dark grey color, which should be present in at least the dozen last Android versions.\nandroid:background=\"@android:color/darker_gray\"\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Please read here about where to ask questions:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support\n. Are you sure this isn't caused by a restriction?\nYou can check the main usage data from the main menu to see which restrictions were recently enforced.\nIn any case, without logcat I can do little, since I don't have this problem.\n. As you can see here there were 170 changes in 82 files from version 2.2.1 to 2.2.2: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/compare/2.2.1...2.2.2\nThis means I really need a logcat to see what the problem is.\nSee this FAQ for how to acquire a logcat: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ14\nYou can try to capture the crash log with CatLog.\nPlease don't send me megabytes of log lines, try to find the crash and post a dozen lines above and below it. With CatLog you can see in real time what is happening.\n. With the log lines I will probably be able to see quickly what is going on.\n. This test version should fix the problem: https://crowd.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_2.2.3-1.apk\nPlease let me know if it does or doesn't.\n. Check the main usage data (main menu) for a restrictions that could cause this.\nElse post a logcat of the FC and a few lines around it, but don't forget to enable XPrivacy debug logging (settings).\n. I can only help you if you post a logcat, there are simply too much variables.\n. I need to see more logging and you should turn on XPrivacy debug logging (XPrivacy main settings).\n. Please use the new issue now.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. I have installed Zello, blocked all location functions, tried to enable 'local', then left Zello and got to GPS status and I had a position within 20 seconds. I don't think this is caused by XPrivacy.\nThe logcat you provided doesn't show location restrictions, so you might want to try to capture another logcat.\n. Although I reviewed most restrictions while developing XPrivacy 3, I have reviewed the location restrictions again. In didn't find anything that could cause this problem in XPrivacy 2.x. Actually the location restrictions have not been changed for months and if there was a problem with the restrictions then at least some of the thousands of XPrivacy users would have complained. My best guess this is a driver problem. I have done ROM development myself for about a year and I know that hardware drivers are often closed source, so it is likely that all ROMs you have tried share the same GPS driver and thus share the same problem.\n. Thanks for keeping the translation up to date!\n. On demand settings/restrictions still need to be enabled in the UI.\n. For the record: the quirk is odsystem\n. Always the first one updating the translations, thanks!\n. Thanks for this big translation update!\n. I don't think entering any other level than XPrivacy proposes manually will work.\n. I don't consider this as a bug, since this is not a supported feature.\nNevertheless, I didn't close the issue for a reason.\n. Looking again into the code there is nothing I want to change.\nThere needs to be a balance between features and performance.\nI have already added several extra levels, which should be sufficient in most cases.\n. The update service already acquires a partial wakelock, so there should be not much difference between running with screen on or screen off, although this might depend on the CPU scheduler in use.\n. Note that there will be no automatic install, so there will be only a notification 'Tap to install' in case there was an updated downloaded.\n. XPrivacyTester is a rough application for developers only.\nIn other words, I don't want to support it as it is (and I don't want to put time into making it nice either).\n. Restrict internet/inet, fully restart the application and you will see that the application doesn't have internet access.\n. getPackagesForUid is marked dangerous, so it is to be expected things like this can happen.\nNevertheless I will allow an application to see its own uid.\n. The reason for the crash in the logcat is:\nE/JavaBinder( 3954): !!! FAILED BINDER TRANSACTION !!!\nThere is no indication this is caused by XPrivacy, but I can't rule it out either.\nYou can try beta version 2.99.x, because the binder restrictions have been removed, since they are not needed anymore. See the changelog for getting 2.99.x versions.\n. The own uid is allowed for getPackagesForUid and queryContentProviders in the just released beta version 2.99.15\n. This problem should be fixed in version 2.2.8\n. @Aeroman this problem will be fixed in the next release.\n. Can you please try if the new restriction MediaRecorder.setOutputFile prevents voice recording?\nUse the menu 'Check for updates' to get a new beta version 2.99.20 with this restriction.\n. Thanks for the update as always!\n. Thanks for the update as always!\n. Thanks for the update as always!\n. For reference:\nhttp://gizmodo.com/the-gyroscope-in-your-smartphone-can-be-easily-used-to-1622053612\n. Thanks for the update as always!\n. The privacy databases does not store the package name, so this is not possible. The privacy database is in a location where storage space might be tight, so I don't want to store things that are not necessary. There is also no 1-to-1 correspondence to uid and package name. For example the user ID is part of the uid.\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. I am missing important information, like the XPrivacy version or if XPrivacy is running in compatibility mode or not.\nDid you check the usage data?\nDid you try to restrict Play services?\n. How accurate is the location?\n. Restricting locations for GPS status works for me, but I can confirm location restrictions for Facebook do not work. I am wondering where the Facebook app is gettings the locations from. I am running in AOSP mode, so there is no way to circumvent restrictions, so my best guess is that we need a new restrictions. Unfortunately I have no idea which one(s).\n. Restricting Play services, including getScanResults, clearing cache for Play services and Facebook, reboot prevents Facebook from finding a location.\nI will investigate how Facebook fetches a location from Play services.\nAs far as I know I have restricted all Play services location functions for both Play services 4.x and 5.x\n. I have checked if Facebook uses the Play services library 4.x and 5.x and it looks like it does not. This probably means the Facebook application is using a custom Play services connection/implementation, which would indeed circumvent the unsafe Play services restrictions. I have no other choice than to document this :-(\n. I have documented it here:\nhttp://forum.faircode.eu/forums/topic/com-facebook-katana-open-more-links/\n. As far as I know only the Facebook application has this problem.\n. Indeed, and that is why restrictions are marked unsafe in version 3 (2.99).\nHowever, the Play services library is not open source, so I don't think a lot of applications will do this.\nI guess Facebook has a deal with Google about this or maybe they reversed engineered the library.\nIt could also be that there need to be restricted more functions, but I have triple check the existing restrictions and checked the documentation, but I cannot find them.\n. Thanks!\n. Seems to be fixed.\n. Thanks, Tony!\n. The update service is able to recover. A message that the update service is running is not easy to implement. The services runs independent of the UI and it would require communication to see if it is running.\n. I found a simple way to check if the update service is running :-)\n. Thanks, Tony!\n. The XPrivacy pro license has no limits in features or time. Why do you think it doesn't work anymore?\n. With a pro license you can download XPrivacy 3 (currently as test/beta version, but little problems were reported over the course if 30 test releases). See the changelog for how to.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Please ask your questions and discuss the UI here:\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/modules/test-xprivacy-2-0-37-ultimate-privacy-t2320783\nShort answer:\n- first check box: restricted or not\n- second check box: on demand restricting or not\nThe first check box is used as default for unanswered on demand restricting (time-out), so a tri-state check box is not enough and/or would be very confusing.\nThe first check box is explained when you first start XPrivacy or when you go to 'About'.\nThe symbol of the second check box is explained in the help.\nIf you have suggestions for improvements, please use the XDA forum to discuss about them first.\n.

I am sure this will be helpful to somebody else in the future.\nWhich app manager / ROM are you using?\n. There is already 'Select applications to allow', which actually uses package names, since that is the way to identify applications on Android.\nMost hooked functions return a list of packages (directly or indirectly) for which it is not feasible to ask on demand for each individual package. There are two (new) functions that take a package name as parameter for which the package name could be restricted/white/black listed on demand. However, this would be inconsistent with the other package related functions and cause confusing / raise question.\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n.

Thanks!\n. Unfortunately this cannot be fixed due too limitations of Android.\nSee also the limitations section:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#limitations\n. I think something did not go as you wanted, since only the last two commit I very recently did are in this pull request.\n. Thanks for the translation update as always!\n. I will look into this after the new stable has been released.\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/PrivacyManager.java#L566\n. Shukran!\n. Thanks again!\n.

This is most probably not caused by XPrivacy.\nDid you reboot after updating XPrivacy?\nI cannot reproduce this problem.\n. I have no idea.\n. I have just updated the texts, so there is a merge conflict.\nCan you please do a new pull request?\n. I have just updated the texts, so there is a merge conflict.\nCan you please do a new pull request?\n. Perfect, thanks!\n. Updates are always welcome, both minor and major, so thanks again!\n. Thanks for fixing the pull request!\n. Thanks for the translation update, as always!\n. @Phylon: if you don't agree, please first discuss here.\n. @Phylon no problem at all. I cannot really judge if something is right or not, so I depend on you guys for the translations.\n. I need to see more logging, with XPrivacy debug logging enabled (XPrivacy main settings).\n. I am still waiting for more logging ...\nMy best guess this problem is caused by a dangerous restriction.\n. This is still too litte logging and the logging doesn't include XPrivacy logging (and also not the FC).\n. I am still missing XPrivacy debug logging.\nPlease read this FAQ about how to capture a logcat:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ14\nMy best guess your problem is caused by a dangerous restriction.\nIf you don't mind losing all your restrictions, you can clear all XPrivacy data using the main menu (or settings if you have the latest stable installed).\n. Good find!\nThis is possible since the recent UI changes.\nFormerly the linear layout handled a tap / was used for showing a highlight.\n. I am not sure what the fix is needed for and I didn't wanted to take risks for the upcoming stable version.\nXPrivacy uses a grid of a multiple of 3 or 6 dip.\n. I will look later into the padding and margin fixes.\n. Can you please post screenshots of before and after the fix?\n. I cannot test this, so I trust it is okay.\n. I should thank you ...\nI have accepted your invitation on GTalk ...\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. I have only a phone with me, so it is difficult to read sources for me at this moment, but I am wondering if you took care of updating the main and details view too, like the on demand check box of the details view.\nI will wait with merging this until after releasing a new stable version in any case.\nI am glad you are contributing again!\n. What I mean is that some settings changes have effect in the main and details view, for example enabling or disabling on demand restricting.\n. Everything looks okay, also the refresh of the application list and application details view:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/pull/1938/files#diff-79934cfdf441be9ed6da5678e57d3ee2R759\n. This is all good work, Tony!\n. Yes, this is better than it was before, thanks!\n. If you have LBE installed, see the limitation section, else pleaae provide a logcat, but please no megabytes of log, just of the problem and a few hundred lines around it.\n. LBE is incompatible, see the limitations section.\n. Can you try to find out the package name of the LBE APK?\n. \"You can just turn it off in Security -> Permission -> Permission Manager\"\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=55120904&postcount=11713\n. Thanks for the update as usual!\n. Thanks for the update, as usual!\n. This is already fixed in version 3.0.1\n. You can already do this with on demand restricting. Also, your root control application should ask you to allow root to an application.\n. This is most probably caused by a restriction.\nCheck the usage data which restrictions are being applied and lift the restriction that is causing this.\nPlease read this too:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support\n. Duplicate of #1950\n. My best guess is that the game checks for XPrivacy. XPrivacy does nothing when no restrictions are enabled.\n. If you have the same problem with Greenify, the game probably checks for enabled Xposed modules.\n. To look into this, I need more details, like which restrictions you exactly applied and a logcat with XPrivacy debug logging enabled.\n. Isn't the contact application used to select a contact here?\nhttps://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8429674/3894587/e8dbf818-2245-11e4-88ce-f5759b9feef1.jpg\nIf so, you need to restrict the contacts application to restrict contacts (which is not advised).\nOne application can call another application to do things.\n. Yes, in theory it is possible that an application can call another application to get privacy sensitive data, so you might need to restrict the other application too. However, mostly this doesn't occur on the background without your knowledge. The contacts application is a good example of this: as long as you don't select a contact, the calling application doesn't 'see' any contact, meaning that only the called application has direct access to the contacts.\n. Please see the recent comments on XDA for this.\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. You can select accounts, applications and contacts to allow using a pro license.\n. Thanks, Tony!\n. Thanks for keeping the translation up to date!\n. Thanks for keeping the translation up to date!\n. XPrivacy does not alter settings / restrictions on its own, with one exception: applying the default template to newly installed applications.\nCan you be more specific about which settings / restrictions are cleared and when that happens?\n. Probably the same as this:\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=55296599&postcount=11949\n. Thanks for keeping the translations up to date!\n. Try the filter icon in the action bar.\nNote that questions should be asked in the XDA forum.\n. Thanks for the translation update as always!\n. Thanks for keeping the translation up to date!\n. Would it be okay to make an exception for iwall white/black listing too?\n. This problem does not exists in master.\n. This has been asked before several times. The problem is that F-Droid doesn't allow me to use my own signature for the APK.\nBoth current download locations, the Xposed repo and GitHub, are independent from Google.\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\n. The Xposed installer has update notifications, like F-Droid has.\n. Thanks for the translation update, Tony!\n. The application settings take precedence over the global settings, which means that checking a box or entering a fake value will make XPrivacy use that value. Unchecked boxes or empty values do nothing. It is not possible to uncheck a global check.\nThis system cannot be changed, because of existing installations. Maybe there should be a short explanatory title. Suggesting for this are welcome.\nA check box 'use application specific values' has proven to be confusing and was for this reason removed.\n. @danielmmmm you cannot disable randomization per application. You should disable randomization globally and enable it per application.\n. The on demand dialog already requests the soft keyboard to hide. If it doesn't work, this is either a bug in your ROM or a limitation of Android. In any case there is nothing that can be changed in XPrivacy to solve this.\n. XPrivacy does nothing if no restriction is being applied. There are no changes in GPS restrictions in the latest versions, so this is most probably caused by something else.\n. If I understand this correctly it would mean application specific restrictions. This is something that would be unmaintainable, so this is not going to happen, sorry.\n. Function restrictions should not depend on each other values, since this will cause trouble.\nYou can manually control individual restrictions per application however..\n. Thanks for the update, as always!\n. Allowing WA contacts is not enough, you should allow the corresponding Android contacts too. I am sure allowing contact for WA works, since I have tested this several times.\n. You can try to allow contacts in the 'All' group.\nAs said before, I have tested this several times (because there were several questions and some bugs) and found this to be working.\nThere are no other questions about this, which is another indication this just works.\n. I double checked the source code, but a contacts group is just a named group, meaning that the contents of the WA and All group must differ (so different lists of contacts, the entries, contacts, are the same). This is something which cannot solved by XPrivacy.\n. In the on demand popup you will find extra entries to allow/deny restriction with specific data (filename, etc). You can manage whitelist entries created this way from the application details view. There is a special icon indication a restriction has a whitelist.\n. See here: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ34\n. There are no on demand popup for contact whitelisting.\nYou can manage allowed contacts using a menu in the application details view.\n. All the contact groups Android provides to XPrivacy are shown. If not everything is there, there is little what can be done.\nYour inquiries do not concern a bug, so please continue on the XDA XPrivacy forum, which is for questions and general help.\n. Thanks for the translation update\n. I appreciate your work, but I want to wait until we can use material design for the UI.\nFor example the card interface is part of material design (and will be included in the compatibility library).\nAnother thing is that I want to avoid hard coding of colors as far as possible, so that XPrivacy will be compatible with different themes (often customized in custom ROMs).\n. Don't worry about your response time, it is just a hobby.\nXPrivacy is using system resources with a few exceptions, for example for the reddish dangerous color. For example I have put considerable effort in using the system color for the (half) check box.\nI believe the compatibility library is already. So, you might try to get it working.\nI would start trying out the new card layout/interface, but you can do what you like.\n. I guess these links will be helpful:\nhttps://developer.android.com/preview/material/compatibility.html\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/297xli/howto_use_the_v21_support_libs_on_older_versions/\n. Thanks for the update, Tony!\n. I have reverted the change, since it is now possible to unselect disabled applications.\nIMHO it is more important to export all applications, than to toggle enabled applications.\nSee also issue #1986\n. You can do this with intents, see this FAQ:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ66\n. Please read this:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support\n. This is most probably caused by a restriction and not by a bug.\nPlease continue this discussion on XDA.\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. There is a free pro license for new translations.\nThere are still some free pro licenses available for testing the new Pro license fetcher application:\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=55410154&postcount=11999\n. Please contact me here for a free pro license:\nhttp://forum.faircode.eu/contact/\n. The changelog is shown once after installing a new version, so I don't see the problem.\n. Moreover, the changelog can contain important, so I like people to read it.\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Thanks for keeping the translation up to date!\n. This is probably caused by a dangerous restriction. Your best bet is to ask for help in the XDA XPrivacy forum.\n. This has recently been discussed on XDA, please use the search.\n. Thanks for the translation update, Tony!\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. The changelog is a WebView of this page. This means the background color cannot be changed without changing the background color of the page, which is not possible, because GitHub uses pre-formatted pages. I don't want to move or duplicate the changelog. It is also not that you are looking long times at the changelog. \n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Restricted by XPrivacy is only shown when something was restricted:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/PrivacyService.java#L618\nMy best guess is that the Restricted by XPrivacy message is caused by the same restriction for another application (another uid).\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Please see here:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#limitations\n. Thanks for keeping the translation up-to-date!\n. Please use English.\n. Thanks for these corrections!\n. Thanks, Tony.\nIt was on my to do list to look into this.\n. Merci.\n. Good.\n. First of all, this cannot be done in a safe way, since the hook needs to be done in application space and can thus be unhooked by the application.\nI also like to know how this will serve your privacy. See also this FAQ:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ25\n. Thanks, as always!\n. Thanks for the update, as always!\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Menu Operations, Select all will toggle select all.\n. Multiple select works like in any other Android application.\n. I don't understand what you mean and the image link doesn't work.\nYou can select all visible applications and then perform a batch operation, for example to remove restrictions.\n. Try menu Operations, Toggle restrictions, Clear.\n. Tap the filter icon and remove all filters, then menu Operations, Select all, then menu Operations, Toggle restrictions, Clear.\n. Please note that this is a question, so please read this:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. @DeKaN thanks. Just look out for 'Updated Dutch translation' in the changelog to know if there were texts changed or added. There will always be a beta release before a stable release when there are text changes.\n. If you enter the quirk resolve IP addresses will be resolved to names where possible.\nThis is not the default behavior, because it is known to cause problems for a few applications (see the limitations section if you are curious which ones).\n. Please contact me using this contact form:\nhttp://forum.faircode.eu/contact/\n. I have sent the license file again, maybe it solves the problem.\n. I have just tested and the wildcards are in the right place, which was your initial issue.\n. This fix is available in the just released beta version 3.3.4\n. Android doesn't support Cebuano.\n. See here about uninstalling, especially the last sentence:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#installation\n. Your XPrivacy version is really old.\nCheck if XPrivacy is device admin (Android settings), which is the only reason why this XPrivacy version could not be uninstalled I can think of. You should uninstall XPrivacy as any other application.\n. Your problem is quite unique, therefore I will try to help you here.\nNevertheless, please read this:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support\n. You could try to upgrade to XPrivacy 3.3 to solve this problem.\n. You can disable device admin somewhere in the Android settings (the place varies by Android version).\n. Please use the other issue.\nThis logcat doesn't add new information.\n. Thanks for keeping the translation up-to-date!\n. I am sorry, but XPrivacy is not a wake up / wakelock manager. IMHO privacy is not something that is optional either, so something is either restricted or not restricted, but not only at night. See also this FAQ: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ25\nMy suggestion: use Greenify\n. @kcschan I am not sure what change you are proposing.\nThere is a clear reason why I reject some feature requests. XPrivacy needs to be maintainable in the end and have just one sole purpose, which is an important way to reduce maintenance and support and also to enhance stability. XPrivacy is not meant as a Swiss Army Knife, but meant to protect your privacy. This means I only accept feature requests which are directly related to protecting your privacy.\n. @kcschan disabling components is like revoking permissions, which will cause instability (crashes) in a lot of cases. The XPrivacy's way is to provide fake or empty data, which is perfectly possible for the case you described. Just restrict the data for the application providing the service or restrict the data for the application calling the service.\n. IMHO privacy is not something optional. This means if data has been leaked, for example when the data is allowed to leak during the day, there is no way back.\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Thanks for improving the French translation!\n. Please read this:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ52\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support\n. If YouTube didn't work with XPrivacy there would have been a lot of complaints, so this is probably caused by a restriction.\n. Your best bet is to ask for help in the XDA thread:\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/modules/xprivacy-ultimate-android-privacy-app-t2320783\n. Although I know how XPrivacy works, it doesn't mean I know all about all existing applications (many!).\nI don't use the YouTube application. In fact, I don't use YouTube at all.\n. My best guess this problem is caused by a restriction, which is not necessarily a YouTube restriction. Your best bet to find which restriction is causing the  problem is by checking the usage data from the main menu. Your best bet for help is the XPrivacy XDA forum from someone who experienced the same problem.\n. If I restrict one category I see a half check box in the 'All' category as expected, so I don't see what the problem is.\n. Please provide more information about this issue.\n. Thanks for keeping the translation up-to-date!\n. Thanks for keeping the translation up-to-date!\n. android.os.NetworkOnMainThreadException is a bug in the application.\nI get the same result with XPrivacy enabled and disabled.\n. Thanks for updating the translation!\n. Although I see the reason for this feature request and although it is basically easy to implement, I have to think about a workable way. Simply allowing restriction of /data/data will have a significant performance impact and will result in probably a lot of support questions.\nNote that this will not be a safe restriction, meaning that the application in theory can undo the Xposed hook.\n. If you want to try yourself, the paths to restrict are limited here:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XIoBridge.java#L105\n. Indeed, just adding /data/data as path to restrict would be quite simple, but it wouldn't be a 'production-quality' solution.\nThe performance impact will be globally for all applications and even affect Android itself, since each file open on /data/data will result in checking if the open is permitted or not (which is not a very cheap operation, since the privacy service has to be inquired, which involves an inter process call, as done by isRestrictedExtra).\n. There is one other thing I like to say: I don't want a solution specific for FlurryAnalytics. The reason is that using specific solutions will result in only adding more and more specific solutions, which could make maintenance and support in the end difficult. See also here: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#contributing\n. I have been thinking in the same direction.\nAndroid doesn't support shared memory, so the only feasible solution would be a global configuration file. The disadvantage would be that this would be not very user friendly, since not everybody is skilled enough to create the right file in the right place with the right permissions.\n. I have tried this change, but even on my Nexus 5 the performance impact is noticeable:\n```\ndiff --git a/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XIoBridge.java b/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XIoBridge.java\nindex ab20c16..5b0ef81 100644\n--- a/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XIoBridge.java\n+++ b/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XIoBridge.java\n@@ -1,6 +1,10 @@\n package biz.bokhorst.xprivacy;\n+import java.io.BufferedReader;\n+import java.io.File;\n+import java.io.FileInputStream;\n import java.io.FileNotFoundException;\n+import java.io.InputStreamReader;\n import java.net.InetAddress;\n import java.net.SocketException;\n import java.util.ArrayList;\n@@ -21,6 +25,29 @@ public class XIoBridge extends XHook {\n    private static String mEmulatedTarget = null;\n    private static String mMediaStorage = null;\n\nprivate static List mListOpen = new ArrayList();\n+\nstatic {\nif (mListOpen.size() == 0) {\nFile folders = new File(\"/data/system/xprivacy/open\");\nif (folders.exists() && folders.canRead())\ntry {\nLog.w(\"XPrivacy\", \"Reading \" + folders.getAbsolutePath());\nFileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(folders);\nInputStreamReader ir = new InputStreamReader(fis);\nBufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(ir);\nString line;\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null)\nmListOpen.add(line);\nbr.close();\nir.close();\nfis.close();\n} catch (Throwable ex) {\nLog.w(\"XPrivacy\", ex.toString());\n}\n}\n}\n+\n    private XIoBridge(Methods method, String restrictionName) {\n        super(restrictionName, method.name(), null);\n        mMethod = method;\n@@ -105,9 +132,17 @@ public class XIoBridge extends XHook {\n                    if (fileName.startsWith(\"/sdcard\") || (mMediaStorage != null && fileName.startsWith(mMediaStorage))\n                            || (mExternalStorage != null && fileName.startsWith(mExternalStorage))\n                            || (mEmulatedSource != null && fileName.startsWith(mEmulatedSource))\n|| (mEmulatedTarget != null && fileName.startsWith(mEmulatedTarget)))\n|| (mEmulatedTarget != null && fileName.startsWith(mEmulatedTarget))) {\n                        if (isRestrictedExtra(param, fileName))\n                            param.setThrowable(new FileNotFoundException(\"XPrivacy\"));\n} else if (fileName.startsWith(\"/data/\"))\nfor (String line : mListOpen)\nif (fileName.contains(line)) {\nUtil.log(this, Log.WARN, \"Checking \" + fileName + \" uid=\" + Binder.getCallingUid());\nif (isRestrictedExtra(param, fileName))\nparam.setThrowable(new FileNotFoundException(\"XPrivacy\"));\nbreak;\n}        } else if (fileName.startsWith(mFileName) || mFileName.contains(\"...\")) {\n            // Zygote, Android\n\n```\n. contains is probably a tiny little more expensive than startsWith, but also more flexible.\n\n\nThe for xxx : yyy Java construct is pretty efficient, so checking if the list is empty (or has entries) will probably only introduce overhead.\nThe real problem is that there are just many files opened on /data/data.\n.

Srv_getApplicationInfo and Srv_getPackageInfo are handled like this:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XPackageManager.java#L178\nThis means it is checked if the function is restricted (isRestrictedExtra) and if it is, the Select to allow list is checked if there is an exception (isPackageAllowed).\nNote that there is an exception for the own package name(s).\n. The functions isRestrictedExtra and isPackageAllowed are thoroughly tested functions, so this should really work.\n. I have added extra logging to the just released version 3.4.1, so you can check yourself.\n. I have tested this thoroughly again and it really works as expected.\nIf you allow the function, it is allowed and if you deny the function, you can allow specific packages using the menu Select applications to allow.\nNote that these functions do not have a 'regular' white or black list, but only the Select applications to allow white list and that this list will only be used if you deny the function.\n. Also please not that on demand restricting is independent of Select applications to allow, which will only be used when you deny the request to see if there is an exception.\n. Checking the provided logcat reveals that the functions were never denied.\n.

Because you can simply turn on demand restricting manually off too.\n. I have been considering to turn off on demand restricting for these two functions, but this is IMHO not a good idea, because on demand restricting is useful without the Select applications to allow white list too.\n. IMHO I have already explained this.\n. You can use on demand restricting for system components on your own risk using the quirk odsystem.\n. System components means Android itself.\nSystem components is not the same as system applications.\n. This next question will be if this can be done for similar functions too and this is not possible, because XPrivacy would need to ask for all applications, because there functions return a list and do not operate on a single package name. To keep things consistent all functions related to Select applications to allow work in the same way.\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Thanks for keeping the translation up-to-date!\n. This is likely caused by a restriction.\nTry clearing all XPrivacy data using the main settings.\nYou could try to find out which restriction is causing the problem by checking the main usage data of XPrivacy available from the main menu.\n. Without restrictions, XPrivacy does nothing, so there is likely something else going on.\n. I don't think this is caused by a bug in XPrivacy. I never had this problem with the calendar and nobody else reported a similar problem.\nI am closing this issue, but feel free to report new findings and/or to provide new information in the contents.\n. You can disable XPrivacy per application by using the on/off switch in the application details view or you can disable XPrivacy for all applications in the Xposed installer.

I don't think this is caused by a bug in XPrivacy, but either by not rebooting after installing a new XPrivacy version or by a bug in the ROM. Typical this occurs when setSmallIcon is not called, but as you can see here, XPrivacy calls this method:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/PackageChange.java#L105\n. Also, XPrivacy is used by quite some people and nobody ever reported this problem.\n. As said, this is probably a ROM problem.\n. The black theme was never away.\n. I guess you have to get used to material design.\n. As already said on XDA: no, sorry.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Thanks for the translation update, as always.\n. The sharing options are provided by other applications. If your export file is on Google drive, you should install the Google drive application.\n. If you want to have a selection for files (on the SD card) you need to install a file explorer.\n. This one is known to work correctly and is open source:\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openintents.filemanager\n. Yes, you need to install the 'sharing services' you want to use.\nI answer each and every issue in the same way: to my best knowledge and I always try to be helpful. I did present the most likely solution to your problem in the first answer.\nIf I think an issue is not an issue, I close it, else the list with issues would be very long, which serves nobody.\n. Both import and export show the sharing list of Android. XPrivacy cannot change this, since this is how Android works.\n. There is not much different between import and export either:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/ActivityShare.java#L270\n. Then Dropbox is the only choice or maybe you have selected to always use this action before.\nAgain, this is how Android works and XPrivacy cannot change this.\nTry to install OI File explorer to see if you get this application as an additional choice.\nMaybe this can help:\nhttp://www.talkandroid.com/guides/beginner/how-to-change-or-clear-default-app-settings-in-android/\n(Google for additional guides if needed)\n. I have no more information to help you.\nI can select files to import on my device.\n. Do you mean the logcat or the usage data?\n. I have looked into this and it would be a lot of work to implement this (changing all 278 calls to Util.log). Since debug logging is used only to pinpoint problems, which often are not one to one related to an application, since restrictions in one application can have effect on another application, it is IMHO not worth to put effort in this. There would also be an impact on performance, even when debug logging is turned off, since the setting needs to be evaluated for each and every application individually.\n. Thank you very much for the Korean translation!\nI needed to fix a few things in the translation, so could you please check if it is still okay:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/res/values-ko/strings.xml\nCould you please translate the texts of the installer too (less work than XPrivacy itself):\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacyInstaller/blob/master/res/values/strings.xml\nThank you!\n. Thanks for the Korean translation update!\n. Shukran!\n. Does restricting locations work correctly?\n. This change is in beta version 3.5.1\n. I am sorry, but this feature is too far from the core function of XPrivacy. Moreover, restricting contact data is quite complicated and I doubt this can be done in a reliable, compatible way.\n. Maybe you can do what you want with a contact manager application.\n. I will look into it.\nYou could try to rename the template in the XML export file.\n. http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=56535557\n. This change is in beta version 3.5.1\n. XPrivacy does nothing without enabling restrictions.\nSee this FAQ for help to find the cause:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ63\n. This might help:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ63\nI am pretty sure this is caused by a restrictions.\n. You can try to remove the folder /data/system/xprivacy and its contents.\nThis will erase all your XPrivacy settings and restrictions.\n. Out of memory is not something which XPrivacy can fix. This is probably caused by low memory or maybe by a bug in the application.\n. This has been discussed before, but there are no good ideas to simplify XPrivacy without sacrificing privacy. Note that the views on what privacy is differ, so there is no one solution for this problem. Maintaining XPrivacy is already enough work, so I am not very motivated to maintain different versions. For example making XPrivacy suitable for Android Lollipop will probably take several hundred hours.\nXPrivacy basically does nothing if you don't restrict things. There is a little overhead, which will be noticeable on slower devices. Also the speed of the device storage does matter and some devices suffer because the storage is not properly trimmed (see the FAQ, question 1). There is little that can been done in XPrivacy to fix this and reducing the number of restrictions will only help a little.\n. Although this would be a nice extra feature, it would be quite some work to implement. There needs to be added a new database table, several new management functions in the privacy service and new GUI elements. If somebody want to contribute this function, I will merge the pull request, but I am not going to implement this myself, sorry.\n. This is most probably caused by a restriction.\nSee this FAQ for help on finding the restriction:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ63\nYou can also try to ask for help on the XDA forum, maybe someone had a similar problem.\n. This problem is probably caused by a restriction.\nThis FAQ might help find the restriction:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ63\n. I have checked the SMS restrictions and I don't see any potential problems:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XSmsManager.java\n. I have also checked the logcats provided in the TextSecure issue and I don't see any obvious problems. There are some TextSecure warnings in the logcat, but I have no idea if this could be the problem.\nUnfortunately XPrivacy debug logging was not enabled while capturing these logs.\n. Seems more like an APN problem to me, which could be caused by a restriction (operator info for example).\n. This?\nGet client 10043/Srv_getPackageInfo(org.thoughtcrime.securesms;null) system=restricted\nGet client 10008/Configuration.MNC(null;null) phone=restricted\nWhich app is 10008?\nI guess 10043 is TextSecure.\n. @skibbipl I see no problems in your logcat, although I have seen this in some of the logcat in the TextSecure issue too:\nW/Binder  (10888): Caught a RuntimeException from the binder stub implementation.\nW/Binder  (10888): java.lang.NullPointerException\nW/Binder  (10888):  at android.view.textservice.SpellCheckerSession$SpellCheckerSessionListenerImpl.onServiceConnected(SpellCheckerSession.java:330)\nW/Binder  (10888):  at android.view.textservice.SpellCheckerSession$InternalListener.onServiceConnected(SpellCheckerSession.java:469)\nW/Binder  (10888):  at com.android.internal.textservice.ITextServicesSessionListener$Stub.onTransact(ITextServicesSessionListener.java:54)\nW/Binder  (10888):  at android.os.Binder.execTransact(Binder.java:404)\nW/Binder  (10888):  at dalvik.system.NativeStart.run(Native Method)\nI am wondering if this all is not caused by a bug in TextSecure.\n. @moxie0 I like to help, but I have no clue to where to look. XPrivacy does basically nothing without restrictions enabled. I have checked the source code of the job manager, but I don't see how XPrivacy can prevent jobs from running, given that nothing special is happening. The network requirement could be a problem when the network is restricted by XPrivacy, but as you say, you see this problem without job requirements too. Maybe you can debug TextSecure with XPrivacy enabled and see what is (not) happening. If you need my help, just give a yell here.\n. I have installed TextSecure now, please tell me how I can send you a message.\nYou can use this contact form when you don't want to share privacy sensitive information:\nhttp://forum.faircode.eu/contact/\n. I have just sent you a TextSecure message to the number you have sent to me using the contact form.\n. It looks like the message is sent:\nI/XPrivacy/XIoBridge( 2087): Get client 10087/connect(textsecure-service.whispersystems.org/54.84.166.29:443;null) internet=!restricted (cached) 0 ms\n. @moxie0 as suggested by @an0n981 I have also sent an insecure text message, which seems to work for me too:\nI/XPrivacy(  834): Get service 10087/Srv_sendText(+<removed>;null) calling=!restricted? 3 ms\n. I have checked the SMS manager restrictions again and I really don't see what could be wrong.\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XSmsManager.java\nThe code is quite straightforward here.\n. @moxie0 did you receive both my secure and insecure message?\n. @grrrrr and @skibbipl although I don't have received a confirmation from @moxie0 that my test messages were received, TextSecure seems to work okay for me, which makes me believe my initial analysis, which was that a restriction was causing this, was right. Note that this need not necessarily be a TextSecure restriction, but can also be a restriction of another application or of a system component. You could try to clear all XPrivacy data using the similar named XPrivacy menu to see if this solves the problem.\n. Both messages are sent according to TextSecure.\n. @skibbipl what do you mean by \"remove all restrictions\", all XPrivacy restrictions for all applications or only the TextSecure retrictions? And what do you mean by \"disable the textsecure ruleset in xprivacy\", the TextSecure XPrivacy restrictions or something else?\n. @grrrrr this means that still a non TextSecure restriction can cause this.\n. This might help:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ63\n. @grrrrr\nThis was recently answered on XDA:\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=57136062&postcount=12862\n. To add to that: to prevent discussion about it, I do not touch the crowd sourced restrictions manually, even not in this case.\n. First of all you should preferable quite an application in a normal way to prevent data from getting lost. That said, you can force quite (kill) applications using XPrivacy by tapping on the application icon in the application details view and selecting the appropriate menu. There is also an Android way of doing this, by long pressing the back key in an application, but you have to enable it somewhere.\n. As said, to prevent discussions, I don't manually change the crowd sourced restrictions.\nJust submit your corrected restrictions (this should be done by everyone reading here).\n. I guess I said that somewhere else ;-)\n. For reference: https://crowd.xprivacy.eu/?package_name=org.thoughtcrime.securesms\n. Duplicate of #2060, please continue the discussion in the other issue, I will reopen it if it appears to be an XPrivacy problem (which I don't expect, also because @an0n981 reports it is working for him).\nAlso try to clear all XPrivacy data using the corresponding menu to determine if it is an XPrivacy or restriction problem (enable flight mode to prevent leaking privacy sensitive data).\nThis problem is not necessary caused by a restriction of the application itself, but could also be caused by restricting other applications / system components.\n. Restricting dangerous functions needs always to be done manually. However, you can change if a restriction is dangerous in the template by long pressing it.\n. Thanks!\n. This would take a lot of time to make, which I rather spent on updating XPrivacy for Lollipop (if/when Xposed for ART will be released). This would take a few hundred hours of research, development and testing, which I have to do in my free time.\nFiltering on usage in a category is already possible by selecting the category in the main view and filtering on data usage. The function restrictions are for fine tuning only and there will be no features specific to functions (with a few exceptions).\nI don't see how filtering on frozen applications would be useful in relation to what XPrivacy does. \n. The security certificate of the crowd sourced restrictions server was recently refreshed to use SHA2 for more security. The security certificate is okay, so my best guess is that the CA certificates on your device are outdated. Try disabling secure connections in the main settings to work around this problem.\n. This is just how it works using the compatibility library and in Lollipop, so you will have to get used to it.\n. Already implemented in https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/commit/0dc1fba4bd8ed51df657ac41c1e65829093e2f24\n. Already implemented in https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/commit/b263e9ed51795732deceed6024e2eaf8e43a9f8a ;-)\n. The freezing of the on demand restricting dialog is caused by a lock in Android. Unfortunately this cannot be fixed. See also here: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#limitations\n. I am pretty sure import of account settings does work, but you cannot import accounts of another device, which is identified by the Android ID.\n. Since the \"W\"-icon is shown something was most probably imported.\nAre you sure the accounts on the device you imported on are exactly the same as on the origin device?\nSo, the same account name (for Google accounts this is an e-mail address) and the account type.\nRelevant code:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/ActivityShare.java#L1106\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/ActivityApp.java#L774\n. You can test it by enabling it and check if everything works. XPrivacy has internal checks, so if something goes wrong XPrivacy will report about it the next time you start the GUI.\n. I am afraid that the variation in parameters is too diverse to tackle this problem. I can add a wildcard option for the case in the screenshot, but there will be a next and a next and a next case. I try to prevent to implement half solutions, so I am not going to do this, also because this is not really a feature of XPrivacy. Sorry.\n. XPrivacy does nothing if there are no restrictions are being applied, so I am quite sure this is caused by a restriction. There is a FAQ about finding \"bad\" restrictions, which might be helpful.\n. Its this information already in the usage data?\n. Any restriction result will be shown in the usage data. It doesn't matter if it is a regular, on demand or white/black list result. What is not shown, is how this result was obtained. Maybe I will implement this some day.\n. Please read here:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ67\n. The challenge is to prevent other TOR users from misusing things, like spamming.\nThis is obviously something I cannot fix.\n. The crowd sourced restrictions are writable.\nThe TOR IP range isn't fixed.\n. This is not as easy as you might think. The TOR exit node list needs to be refreshed regularly (using a cronjob/script) and there needs to be special rules for read only access when using one of the IPs. The server is protected by firewall rules and it is not straightforward and maybe not even possible to create firewall rules which depends on the kind of access. Moving the rules to the application layer is not an option, since valuable server capacity will be wasted when requests are denied, since these will have to go through the web server first. I am not willing to spent a lot of time on this and in the process taking the risk that valid requests will be denied.\nThe IP-addresses are on the blocklists for a reason and I cannot help it TOR is also being misused.\n. @grrrrr the main goal is to prevent people from submitting bad restrictions, not to withstand a (D)DoS.\n. There are also other measures in place to prevent misuse.\nAs said before, I can't help it that TOR is also being misused for less moral purposes.\nIt is also not that only TOR is being blocked.\nI guess the biggest design flaw is in the humans itself.\n. First make sure your license file has its original name and content (suggestion: download it again and if you lost it, use this contact form to request a new one: http://forum.faircode.eu/contact/). Since you seem to be a power user, you can copy the license file direct to this folder /data/data/biz.bokhorst.xprivacy/, but make sure the file permissions are set right (same as the parent folder should be okay). \n. Each and every Android device has /data/data on the internal storage.\nThis is where all applications store their data.\nNote that you need root and a suitable file manager to navigate here.\nMy advice: put the original license file with the original file name into the root folder of the SD card and start XPrivacy. XPrivacy will import the license this way (it will be removed from the SD card for security reasons).\n. You can check the menu Help, About for the exact location where the license file should be put.\nI am wondering if you are using the latest version of XPrivacy from here:\nhttp://repo.xposed.info/module/biz.bokhorst.xprivacy\nThe check boxes and icons are explained in the menu Help, Legend.\n. @lekabeta did you try to put the license file in thefolder as shown in the XPrivacy about dialog?\n. @lekabeta if you don't have a folder starting with biz in /data/data XPrivacy is not installed.\n. @psycros putting the license file directly into the XPrivacy folder is a hacky workaround and in fact it was mentioned you need root for that.\nThe normal procedure, which almost always work, is to put the license file into the folder as shown in the menu Help, About and to restart XPrivacy.\nThe about dialog will show if the license is installed correctly.\n. @lekabeta please tell me what you exactly did.\nYou should do this:\n- Download the license file from the e-mail with the activation instructions which were sent to you after you donated using PayPal or Bitcoin\n- Make sure the license file has the name as sent in the e-mail and make sure the license file was not altered, for example by a virus scanner\n- Put the license file in the root folder of the SD card. If you are in doubt about the exact location, the correct location is shown in the menu Help, About. Note that if you don't have an SD card, for example if you are using one of the Nexus devices, you need to put the license file in the root folder of the internal storage (unfortunately this is quite confusing and IMHO Google still needs to fix this). Another note: the root folder of the SD card or internal storage is not the same as the root folder of your device.\n- Now restart XPrivacy and if you want to be sure restart your device\n- XPrivacy will import the license file and remove it from the root folder of the SD card (or internal storage)\n- You can check if the license file was imported correctly in the menu Help, About (instead of the folder name you will see a message the license is activated)\n. @lekabeta no I didn't get the screenshots. GitHub will not display them if you reply to GitHub notification e-mails.\nSuggestion: reply to the XPrivacy pro instructions to send me the screenshots.\n. Adding Google maps to an application which is trying to protect your privacy will not be welcomed by other users. IMHO the address search is almost as useful and it doesn't need software from Google built into XPrivacy itself.\n. XPrivacy is an open source project which is not meant to make money. The donations for the pro version are to power the crowd sourced restrictions server and meant as a motivation to keep developing and supporting XPrivacy.\n. Your request is on the right place, no worries.\nAn application already has always access to information about itself in most cases:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XPackageManager.java#L172\nI will see if I can do this for more functions.\n. queryIntentActivities is marked dangerous for a reason.\nIt is not possible to detect an own activity of the application is being queried in a generic way.\n. Unfortunately I don't see thins to recognize the ROM in a generic way :-(\n. @wbedard using only this intent is not sufficient. You should also handle the 'active' intent.\n. @wbedard this was / should be discussed on XDA.\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. Unfortunately I don't see a logcat.\n. There is little I can do here:\n12-08 12:16:58.873 W/XPrivacy(27741): java.lang.OutOfMemoryError uid=10245\n12-08 12:16:58.873 W/XPrivacy(27741): java.lang.OutOfMemoryError\n. I guess this will help you:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ54\n. There is only one filter icon and the action bar is a the top of the screen, below the status bar.\n. I have looked into this, but I see no way to get the uid for XPrivacy from within the package manager without risking instability. Moreover, usage data about not enforced functions were added sometime ago, because there were complaints XPrivacy was not transparent about this, so I guess I cannot make everybody happy again :-(\n. Thanks for the translation update.\nIt will be part of the next release.\n. There are instructions in the FAQ:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ14\n. Please note that I cannot do anything without logcat.\nXPrivacy is tested by me and several other people and nobody has this problem.\n. I am closing this issue for now, but if you provide a logcat I will look into it.\n. I don't think that debug logging is needed to find the cause of this.\n.

I don't want to support Cydia Substrate, since Cydia Substrate isn't supported itself too, so I have removed Cydia Substrate support altogether for the next release.\nTest version: https://crowd.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_3.5.7c.apk\nPlease let me know if it works.\n. This is probably because you rebooted before Xposed detected the update.\n. You need to set dangerous restrictions always manually, but you can change which functions are dangerous in the template.\n. I cannot reproduce this.\nIf I apply a template with all on demand restrictions disabled, I get no half check box.\n. I cannot reproduce it by installing a new application either.\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. In time for the test release I am prepering :-)\n. Thanks for the translation updates!\n. There are other Xposed modules for this, for example appsettings.\n. Long press uid to manage white/black lists.\n. @Cyclu  Could you please try this version:\nhttps://crowd.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_3.6.5-1.apk\n. Now that I have looked at the code, there is little that can be done, because loadIcon will load the bitmap in memory and I see no obvious way to prevent this.\n. I closed it after commenting on XDA I don't see things which can be improved.\n. What you can try is this in the manifest:\nandroid:largeHeap=\"true\"\n. Also read this and you will see this problem will at least not have a straightforward solution:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/16958879/getting-a-lot-of-app-icons-make-out-of-memory\n. Another thing to try is to call System.gc() in HolderTask.doInBackground (ActivityMain.java)\n. Since there is a way to directly access an application icon, I have tried scaling down, but this is too slow to be useful.\nWhat might help is disabling the icon cache. Could you please try this version to see if it solves your problem: https://crowd.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_3.5.7icon.apk\n. How are you, an0n981?\n\u200bSolving one out of memory results into a new out of memory.\nCan you please check how much memory you have free?\u200b\n. I am fine, thanks!\nI guess you didn't have this problem with 3.5.7 ?\nThere are not much changes, so you can easily downgrade if you like.\n. Yes, please, but check first if the cause was an out of memory exception,\nin that case that is all I need to know.\n. All first crashes in the four log files have as\ncause java.lang.OutOfMemoryError.\n. Might be a consequence of the changes for #2094\n. Test version:\nhttps://crowd.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_3.5.8-1.apk\n. Probably this: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/commit/52d70b0ea825f6d0c6358aed231bf37b0c7a7e1c\nI will later build a version without this change.\nHow is the speed?\n. Ah, interesting, 'Andy the Android' actually means no icon.\nI was thinking about another problem, but I guess it is simpler.\n. Please try again with this version:\nhttps://crowd.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_3.5.8andy.apk\n. And thanks for testing on this Christmas evening!\n. I feel the same about Home alone, etc ;-)\nJust boring.\n. I guess this version will solve that:\nhttps://crowd.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_3.5.8angry.apk\n. LOL\nSee, my commit ;-)\n. So, the problem is not fixed?\n. Which applications?\n. I have one angry Andy too.\nBut is the scrolling issue fixed?\n. This version should even be faster and display all icons:\nhttps://crowd.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_3.5.8happy.apk\n. All changes are available in beta version 3.5.9\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/releases/tag/3.5.9\n. This is because there is a privacy service in between.\nThe code is here:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/PrivacyManager.java#L583\n. Executing an SQL command would be insecure. We don't want other applications be able to change restrictions. This is one of the reasons the privacy service exists (which is started even before Android, to allow restricting Android itself).\nSee here for more information on manipulating the privacy database:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/DATABASE.md\n. What do you want to let XPrivacy do before boot?\nNote that the XPrivacy GUI needs to go through the privacy service to change any setting for security reasons. The privacy services manages the privacy database.\n. Ow, and this particular piece of documentation was mostly contributed by @an0n981 \n. This is outside the score of XPrivacy.\n.  XPrivacy is meant to protect your privacy by proving no or fake data, but not to replace services.\n. GSF or the Play store are services/applications which you can restrict with  XPrivacy, so I don't understand what you want.\n. That is what I understood too, but this is outside the scope of XPrivacy. Disabling and simulating GSF would be a huge project.\n. With a pro license you can export and import all restrictions and settings, including the templates.\n. There is a FAQ about this.\n. Thanks for the translation update.\nI see a lot of existing texts were updated, why is that?\n. @MikeBravoE what do you mean?\n. I have merge another translation update which conflicts with this one.\n. Then you have probably restricted another application which causes this.\nCheck the usage data for which application.\nAlso, this FAQ might help you: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ63\nIf you have additional questions, please use the forum: http://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/modules/xprivacy-ultimate-android-privacy-app-t2320783\nXPrivacy does never restrict things on its own.\n. There are already enough options in the on demand restricting dialog, which cannot be shown for too long, else Android will crash, and I don't want to add anymore, sorry.\n. I don't want an edit function in the white/black list view, because it will result in mistakes and therefore in too many support questions.\n. I will leave this issue open and see if I can come up with an idea how to handle this, since it is often asked for.\n. Duplicate of #2056\n. Thanks for the translation update, as always!\n. Please post a screenshot of the XPrivacy about too.\n. Could you please install this version of XPrivacy:\nhttps://crowd.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_3.5.9proxy.apk\nand capture two new logcats using this command:\nadb logcat | grep proxy.*uid=10070\nAlso, please post a link to the application you are testing with.\nExample output:\nadb logcat | grep proxy.*uid=10070\nI/XPrivacy/XLocationManager(  832): proxyLocationListener uid=10070\nI/XPrivacy/XLocationManager(  832): proxyLocationListener uid=10070\nI/XPrivacy/XLocationManager(  832): proxyLocationListener uid=10070\nI/XPrivacy/XLocationManager(  832): unproxyLocationListener uid=10070\nI like to know if unproxyLocationListener is missing in different scenarios.\nAlso try to close the application (both in a normal way or forced, for example using the XPrivacy kill menu)\n. After unproxyLocationListener the GPS should go off, isn't that the case?\n. I could reproduce this issue in compatibility mode (only).\nAfter several hours of debugging I found a solution.\nCould you please check if this version solves the problem and if fake locations are still working?\nhttps://crowd.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_3.5.9altproxy.apk\n. Thanks for reporting back.\nI will release this version as a new beta release to make sure there are no side effects.\nYou can always show your appreciation by donating something:\nhttp://www.xprivacy.eu/\n. This has already been discussed frequently.\nThe loading of the application list is not what takes time, but fetching about 400 restrictions and settings for each application from the privacy service is what takes time and this cannot be changed.\nPlease read this:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support\n. Already there.\n. What is the privacy issue with this?\nThree is no information leaking to a third party this way, or am I wrong?\n. Find me the API description and I will look into it.\n. I cannot reproduce this issue in the latest beta.\nWhat do you exactly tap?\nThe application name? or its icon?\n. This should be fixed in the latest beta version, see this commit: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/commit/a683a48f7b289c7a5f01721eb2506d05bbb6e1fd\n. This will be fixed in the next release.\n. Clicks won't do anything, since else the wrong application details will be opened.\n. I was able to allow opening the correct application details while the list is still being populated.\nThis will be in the next beta release.\n. My new project is quite nice, thanks. Nevertheless I will keep my promise to maintain XPrivacy, meaning I will fix bugs and add new restrictions when requested.\nDid you test 3.5.11 already? It should fix this issue.\n. Please read the support section here on GitHub to see how you can ask your questions.. This is explained in the FAQ.\n. This can also be caused by restrictions of another application. Check the usage data, follow the procedure in the FAQ or ask for help on XDA. This is most probably not a bug.\n. A MAC address is six pairs of hexadecimal digits:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address\nRelevant code:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/PrivacyManager.java#L973\n. If I enter six pairs of digits (separated by a colon) it works for me, no zeroes.\n. As said, a MAC address is six pairs of hexadecimal digits:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address\n. I understand you perfectly, but despite this application is showing eight pairs of hex digits of a MAC address, a MAC address consists of six pairs of hex digits: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address\n. As said, it works for me and a MAC-address is 6 pairs of hexadecimal digits. I have tested with Network info II and for fake values it doesn't matter if XPrivacy is running in compatibility mode or not.\nIf you enable debug logging in the XPrivacy settings, you can see in the catlog which fake values XPrivacy provides.\n. The HE application also shows 8 pairs of digits to me, but this is incorrect, since a MAC address has only six pairs of digits. This is not an XPrivacy problem.\n. The code is here:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XWifiManager.java#L142\nThe Android source code is here:\nhttp://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/ext/com.google.android/android/5.0.0_r1/android/net/wifi/WifiInfo.java#387\nThe fake value is here:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/PrivacyManager.java#L974\nThere is nothing wrong with the code IMHO.\nThe logging confirms this (6 pairs of digits)\n. Delaying is not a good idea IMHO and sending the intent another time raises the question when.\nIsn't it a better solution to have a fail-safe in Tasker?\n. I don't see a good solution here, so I am closing this issue for now.\n. I am sorry, but the VIEW intent parameters are to diverse to allow wildcard whitelisting. I have also to keep performance in mind.\n. Moreover, you can always restrict the file access itself.\n. Please read here:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#limitations\n. It is a known and documented problem, which can unfortunately not be fixed.\n. Maybe you can contribute such a function?\n. There is nothing I can do to fix this.\n. Which version of XPrivacy are you using?\n. I am currently on a slow mobile connection, so I cannot download the log files. Maybe you can find the crash by looking for FATAL and only post the crash and a few dozen lines around it.\n. The other term to search for is exception, but there are potentially more of them, but unrelated, so check if at least the first stack trace frame is of XPrivacy.\nA better method is to reproduce the crash while watching the catlog and stopping the log right after the crash.\n. I would like to look into this, but there is no crash or exception in the provided log files.\n. Questions like this should be asked here:\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/modules/xprivacy-ultimate-android-privacy-app-t2320783\nSee also here:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support\n. Please provide a logcat as short as possible.\nAlso read the limitations: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#limitations\nSee also issue #1685\n. I don't think this can be fixed, but if I have some more time I will look into this restriction again.\n. The restriction loadUrl is to fake the user agent and not to prevent loading URLs. Maybe this is confusing, but XPrivacy is not there to block things, but to hide privacy sensitive data.\n. You could create an issue for a new restriction for loading URLs ...\n. Refs #2122 \n. I couldn't find a problem in the logcat you have sent me by e-mail. I did see you are using AppOps. Not to be unfriendly, but I don't support XPrivacy in conjunction with other similar product, it is just too difficult to do so.\nPlease try to capture another logcat with XPrivacy logging enabled (main settings) and AppOps disabled and try to capture only the crash and a few dozen lines around it. It is no fun to look through long logcats not knowing what to search for.\n. > Although if I may add, I don't see the point of \"Allow when using\" which seems like a security risk. Because when you click \"allow when using\" and set that option. What if another third party app or app chooses to launch it without your permission. So then it's allowed when you are using it.\n\nIt's better to have it select \"allow\" Then it will have an option to say remember your choice. And if you click no to remember, then it will ask you again, next time you use it. That way, when you close it. And then reopen it again, and it will ask you if you want to allow it again.\nUnless it's too irritating for someone to click allow every time you use it.\n\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=58473863&postcount=13565\nI was thinking to allow/deny as long as the application is in the foreground/visible.\n. I have attempted to implement this, but it appears this will not be very useful, because a lot of restrictions are evaluated before an application becomes visible (and even before an application is started). IMHO this would be a quite confusing and an unreliable feature, so I will not further pursue this.\n. First of all thanks for your intention to help others.\nThis has been discussed on the XDA XPrivacy forum before, but I understand you were not able to read all messages of the forum, because it is so large.\nThis limitation exists to prevent people from submitting rubbish, like unset or unfinished restrictions.\n. This has been discussed sometime ago, but uploading whitelists could expose privacy sensitive data.\n. I have already spent time on this, but this is not possible.\n. There is no API for it.\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/SearchView.html\n. Possibly and since the support library represents what is coming on Lollipop, this will be standard behavior in the future (material design requires using the support library).\n. Please provide a logcat.\nI will not look at very long logcats, so please capture only the part where the restriction is being used.\nDon't forget to enable XPrivacy debug logging (main settings).\nAlso please mention your device/ROM/Android version.\n. Version 3.5/3.6 differences: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/compare/3.5...3.6\n. Please capture a logcat with this special version:\nhttps://crowd.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_3.6-1.apk\nI have inspected the code and I don't see anything which can explain this.\n10,000s of people are using version 3.6 and nobody complained about this, so it is not very likely there is a bug, but you'll never know.\n. Indeed, that is the problem.\nCould you please try if this version fixes the problem?\nhttps://crowd.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_3.6-2.apk\n. Could you please give it another try with this version:\nhttps://crowd.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_3.6-3.apk\nI have partly reverted the changes for #2105 now.\n. Please provide a logcat of this with XPrivacy debugging enabled.\n. Does XPrivacy run in AOSP or compatibility mode?\n. I have changed the code to block the intents instead of changing the phone number to fix this problem. There is no other way of doing this, but the result is the same, an application cannot see your phone numbers.\nCould you please check if this version solves the problem:\nhttps://crowd.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_3.6.1-1.apk\nThe contact restriction is handled in another way, so I don't think this problem applies to contact restrictions (unless you restrict contacts for the contacts application/service itself).\n. @Tragen: this will happen in any version 3.x\n. Not for these two restrictions.\n. Please read this:https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ52\n. I don't think any of these are caused by XPrivacy.\nPlease read the support section I pointed you to earlier again.\n. Yes, and that is correct, see the changelog.\n. Showing the usage data is fast.\nShowing the application list is not, but that can really not be improved \n. @wbedard which doesn't mean this will not eventually be implemented by me or someone else.\nActually, I am just looking into implementing a new feature right at this moment :-)\n(not this one, though)\nFurthermore I don't recommend using closed source Xposed modules.\n. Sorry, this is too much work to implement.\n. It would also be difficult to map XPrivacy restrictions to AppsOps, difficult to maintain (changes in AppsOps will require changes in XPrivacy) and I suspect the number of people interested in this would be very limited.\n. It is too much work, it will take space and it will be difficult to maintain, so this will not be done, sorry.\n. It would be difficult to extract the right pieces of text, but the idea is not bad. Nevertheless, I am still not going to do this.\n. Please provide a logcat with XPrivacy debug log enabled. You can also try the quirk 'freeze'.\n. @licaon-kter XPrivacy has no background service and XPrivacy needs to be started before Android runs, else it wont work.\n. There is already a notification about that.\n. This pull request conflicts with another pull request, so maybe it is obsolete.\n. Can you please be more specific about which restrictions do not seem to work?\nAt least a few restrictions in the same category seem to work:\n02-16 17:32:29.051 I/XPrivacy(753): Get service 1000/getSimOperator(null;null) phone=!restricted? (mcached) 5 ms\n02-16 17:33:39.959 I/XPrivacy(753): Get service 10076/Srv_getCellLocation(null;null) location=!restricted? (ccached) 4 ms\n02-16 17:33:39.980 I/XPrivacy(753): Get service 10076/Srv_getNeighboringCellInfo(null;null) location=!restricted? (ccached) 1 ms\nSo, it would be strange if the others do not work.\nDid you check the usage data?\nDid you got support info popups?\nNote that this problem could be caused by Xposed too.\nAlso note that the next three weeks I cannot work on XPrivacy.\n. Another note: I will not work on fixing things for Lollipop until this issue has been solved: #2143\nAs long as this issue is not solved, the project goal, providing a decent privacy solution for many users, cannot be reached.\n. @gruez can you please post a logcat with XPrivacy debug logging enabled?\n. Which restriction caused the phone number to be faked/hidden before?\n. Will be fixed in the next release, but will result in bootloops in many cases, because of a bug in Xposed.\n. @indiandragon this is too complicated for most people and moreover I will not support permissive mode, because it is less secure.\n. I don't think this is directly caused by XPrivacy, so I will close this issue for now.\nF/libc ( 5441): Fatal signal 13 (SIGPIPE), code 0 in tid 5441 (tmp-mksh) \n. This is a known problem, which cannot be solved, see the limitations section.\n. This can already be done with on demand restricting.\n. For me this works and without logcat there is little I can do.\n. Even with a bootloop it is almost always possible to capture a logcat from a PC. There is a FAQ about how to capture a logcat.\n. Question: did you modify the kernel image as described in the installation instructions?\n. http://pastebin.com/UpVezYzx\n. XPrivacy always needs Xposed. The steps are numbered for a reason. For Lollipop there is just an additional step.\nNote that both Xposed and XPrivacy for Lollipop are early test versions and things might not work. Use the XDA XPrivacy forum to ask if things work for your device/ROM/kernel (I only have one device/ROM myself).\n. Please provide a link to the application.\n. Refs #1822\n. Play services locating:\nhttps://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/location/package-summary.html\nOld Play services location restriction in XPrivacy:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XLocationClient.java\nNew Play services location restriction in XPrivacy\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XGoogleApiClient.java\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XConnectionCallbacks.java\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XFusedLocationApi.java\nTheory: dynamic hooking might not work (anymore), which would result in an XPrivacy warning ClassNotFoundException or NoSuchFieldException.\nI will look into this as soon as there is a stable Xposed for Android 5.1.\n. \"but Apps get the Location via Play Services\": the application is definitely not getting a location from Play services and unfortunately I have no idea where the location is coming from.\n. Note that the above commit does not fix this issue, but allows you to see that an application connects to Play services, which mehr-tanken does not.\n. mehr-tanken is also not using the standard Android location manager, so I am puzzled about how the application gets the current location.\nI have checked all location restrictions and they work.\n. @UweRammelt: how do you know the application is using the Play services to obtain a location?\n. Restricting Play services location and rebooting will restrict location for mehr-tanken, so the application is using the Play services to get the last location.\nXPrivacy restricts all documented location requests for the Play services, both the old way (LocationClient) and the new way (FusedLocationApi). So, my conclusion the application is connecting to the Play services in a non-standard way.\n. The application is using the Play services (most probably only), but in a non standard way.\n. Play services location services interface:\nhttps://github.com/microg/android_external_GmsApi/blob/master/play-services-api/src/main/aidl/com/google/android/gms/location/internal/IGoogleLocationManagerService.aidl\n. It will probably be a new quirk.\n. Duplicate of #2148\n. Please provide a logcat.\nThis may be caused by a known Xposed problem.\nPossibly duplicate of #2148\n. Small methods are sometimes optimized and cannot be hooked by Xposed. Typical methods which are hooked to return true to let the UI part of a module query if the module part is active.\n. This type of problem is almost always caused by restrictions, especially of system applications and system components. Please try to clear all XPrivacy data using the main settings, reboot and see if the problems have gone away. XPrivacy in itself does basically nothing without restrictions.\n. I am currently traveling in a third world country, so I have little means. Please post the log lines of the crash and a few dozen lines around here I may be able to tell the cause.\n. One note: having LBE running will cause this problem, see also the compatibility section for more information and other possible causes.\n. It looks like Xposed is causing this problem.\nDmitry notifications@github.com schreef op 2 maart 2015 12:38:25 WET:\n\nNo problem, there is no rush, have a safe trip. \nLBE is not running and never was.

If there is usage data for the function, then the restriction works and I don't see any reason to look into this, considering that the restriction for the corresponding new Lollipop function also seems to work. Things are simply different on Lollipop.\n. Another remark: it is not the goal of XPrivacy to prevent DNS resolving. Restricting access to IP addresses is a feature because IP addresses can be used as identification.\n\nWhat I like to see is an application which has access to your IP address despite restricting it with XPrivacy.\n. Isn't this the problem documented in the limitations section? If you mean your choice is not set, which is unlikely, please provide a small as possible logcat with XPrivacy debug logging enabled.\n. Also, please describe the exact steps to reproduce.\n. XPrivacy does nothing directly with sound, but maybe this is caused by a restriction, so check your usage data.\n. Will be fixed in the next release, but will result in bootloops in many cases, because of a bug in Xposed.\n.  The answer is in the release announcement of the latest alpha version.\nQuestions are better asked on the XDA forum.\n. On demand timeout is always allow/deny once. Allow/deny is taken from the current restriction setting, which is by default allow, but can be set to default deny by applying a template, possible when installing an application.\n. The result of unattended on demand popups is never stored permanently, but are always once for 15 second, regardless any setting.\n. Since I cannot test this release myself, please report if it works for you or not, stating your device/ROM type/version.\nVersion 3.6.7 UNSUPPORTED\nhttps://crowd.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_3.6.7.apk\nPlease read also this:\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=59352424&postcount=14092\n. @wbedard I think the problem is clear and known. We just have to wait until Xposed is fixed.\n. Version 3.6.8 UNSUPPORTED\nhttps://crowd.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_3.6.8.apk\nThis version will not solve any bootloops/black screens (please provide a logcat), but might fix the phone number restriction (#2141) and/or the device ID (IMEI) restriction (#2159), because XPrivacy will run in compatibility mode. I figured AOSP mode might not be needed anymore, since unhooking with Xposed for ART will probably be not possible anymore.\n. Changelog: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\n. Interesting, it seems that compatibility mode, which means different restrictions, is triggering a bug in Xposed, likely this one: https://github.com/rovo89/Xposed/issues/29\n. @amakuramio please provide a logcat\n. @amakuramio this is caused by the same bug in Xposed as referenced earlier and the same reason I cannot run/test XPrivacy myself.\n. As said on XDA I am not very satisfied with the situation at all.\n. To all: I would like to see feedback on 3.6.8 too, since it is an attempt to fix the not working restrictions.\n. @alvareo https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/issues/2162#issuecomment-78920368\n. To be clear just another time: all boot problems I have investigated are caused by the same Xposed bug, which will not be fixed anytime soon and is the same reason why I cannot work on XPrivacy for Lollipop.\n. Another thing: I am running stock Lollipop 5.1 on my device (a Nexus 5), which works quite good, in contrary to Lollipop 5.0.x (I have disabled most Google services). Unfortunately there will be no Xposed for Android 5.1 anytime soon too, which is another reason I have suspended XPrivacy development for now.\n. @amakuramio did you check the IMEI? (one of the restrictions complained about #2159)\n. It is no surprise 3.6.7 restrictions are not all working.\nI am more curious about the same for 3.6.8.\n. It is no surprise 3.6.7 restrictions are not all working.\nI am more curious about the same for 3.6.8.\n. I don't know.\n. I don't know.\n. @aOryx same as all other bootloops, caused by a bug in Xposed.\n. @amakuramio I am not sure if this problem occurs on all ROMs and people tend to report problems only.\n. @amakuramio \nThe question on stack overflow you are referencing is, besides being very old (at least in the ICT world; in this case two major Android releases ago), not about the same issue.\nSIGSEGV is a general crash in native code and you need to inspect the details of this type of crash to know what it is about (which can be very hard to do).\n. Understand Xposed, but with all respect, I guess this is far beyond your skill set.\nAlso, I don't see the point in putting energy into this, since rovo89 knows exactly what the cause of the issue is.\n. There is no Xposed for ART for versions before (and after) version 5.0.x\n. Nevertheless the problem is exactly the same.\nWe just have to wait until this bug in Xposed has been fixed.\n. @CHEF-KOCH the title of this issue says UNSUPPORTED for a reason.\n. Your best bet is to ask in the XDA XPrivacy forum about device support. I don't see Xposed fixed anytime soon.\n. More about XPrivacy for Lollipop:\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=59754086&postcount=14298\n. As soon as there is a more stable version of Xposed I will look into this. The (super) alpha versions of Xposed are not really usable for XPrivacy.\n. @amakuramio it is the same crash as all other ones, only the crash part is missing. Recognized by:\nE/art     ( 2428): Tried to mark 0xffffffff not contained by any spaces\nE/art     ( 2428): Attempting see if it's a bad root\nThere is an additional thing which needs to be fixed on Android 5.1: the activity manager service has been changed.\n. No version of XPrivacy is supported on Android Lollipop, until Xposed is more stable. Most or all versions of XPrivacy will cause Xposed to crash and to bootloop your device. Read the comments in this issue for more details.\n. For XPrivacy nothing has been changed.\n. You can find the Xposed changes here:\nhttps://github.com/rovo89/Xposed/commits/master\nhttps://github.com/rovo89/android_art/commits/xposed-lollipop\n. Here is a new (unsupported) version to try, but be prepared for bootloops:\nhttps://crowd.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_3.6.9-2.apk\n. This version will likely resolve the bootloop problems on Lollipop:\nhttps://crowd.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_3.6.9-3.apk\nThanks @dk-zero-cool for the workaround https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/pull/2193 !\n. I am closing this issue, since version 3.6.10 should solve the most important problems :-)\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/releases/tag/3.6.10\n. @twentythree- Logcat?\n. @Furchendackel Why not use 3.6.12 ?\n. @burkele57 if there is any difference in battery use between KitKat/Lollipop with XPrivacy it is probably due to Xposed.\n. I am not using Android Studio, so I cannot do this.\nIn the tools directory there are instructions and an outdated build.gradle for Android Studio.\nMaybe they are useful to you and maybe you can update these files.\n. There is a FAQ about applications not shown, including solution.\n. Subscription info is handled by the SubscriptionController:\nhttp://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/ext/com.google.android/android/5.1.0_r1/com/android/internal/telephony/SubscriptionController.java\n. Can be restricted with the TelephonyProvider restrictions, since all subscription info is stored in the content provider content://telephony/siminfo.\n. Which Android version?\nHow did you test this?\nI am quite sure it works on Android versions before Lollipop.\n. Are you sure you are not seeing a fake value?\nThe restriction is straightforward and has been tested to be working:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XAdvertisingIdClientInfo.java\nThere is just one way to get the advertising Id:\nhttps://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/ads/identifier/AdvertisingIdClient.Info.html\nNote that I cannot check things, since Xposed doesn't work on my device.\n. I have only one device, a Nexus 5 (I gave all my old devices away), which should suffice for XPrivacy development. The main problem is Xposed itself. Xposed is not yet available for Android 5.1 and quite unstable, at least in combination with XPrivacy. The reason for the instability is a know Xposed bug. The developer of Xposed has said that both Android 5.1 support and the bug do not have priority.\nA second device for Xposed development would be handy, since I use the same device both for private and business purposes, but that doesn't take away the Xposed problems.\n. This XDA comment has more information about the current project status:\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=59352424&postcount=14092\n. This is more probably caused by using XPrivacy alongside LBE Security Master of the security center of MIUI. See here for details: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#compatibility\n. Since there are a lot of changes, I like to see this reviewed by someone else.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Please reply to the pro license activation instructions for support.\n. Fetching restrictions doesn't enable/disable asking, so the previous setting will be used.\nDon't know applies a reasonable default, like timeout.\nPlease ask your next question on the XPrivacy XDA forum.\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support\n. Ask you question / describe your problem on XDA and I will answer / give a solution, which might be useful for more people.\n. No need to restrict this, since it calls the function Runtime.exec:\nhttp://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/ext/com.google.android/android/5.1.0_r1/android/app/UiAutomationConnection.java#242\n. No, all existing restrictions will remain.\n. I guess I misunderstood your question: URLConnection is an alternate way to connect to the internet (for example to fetch crowd sourced restrictions), which is supported from API level 1.\n. Sorry, but this is far fetched and most probably not usable in reality.\n. I have read some articles about this and comments about it and it is just \"another\" security research without any value. Show me an application which can show my position within 1 km, which cannot be restricted by XPrivacy and I will look into it. Note that information which can be restricted is needed to make it work anyway.\n. \"To locate the phone, we assume the attacker has prior knowledge of the area or routes through which the victim is traveling.\"\nRestricting location will render this method useless, since it needs a base location to start.\n. \"Contact the article authors for that.\"\nXPrivacy is a community project, so I expect effort from the community as well, which is not only requesting features and asking questions.\n. Please reply to the pro license activation instructions for support.\n. This can only be prevented by hooking in the service that provides the advertising ID. Unfortunately this is not possible, because this service is closed source. I could hook into the Binder, which I did before, but the big disadvantage is a system wide degraded performance.\n. I don't think a random application can change the advertising ID.\n. For Google Play services, XPrivacy is just a random application. The problem here it is closed source, so honking is not an option.\n. Yes, I know this will work, but check how many calls are done to transact to see what the performance impact is.\nSee also this source: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XBinder.java\n. Nevertheless, make this work and do a pull request and I might merge it.\n. Hook into android.os.Binder.execTransact (this is safer, because it is at the service side, which cannot be unhooked).\nThen in \"before\" create a new parcel with the right layout and values, see here for how to create a new parcel: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XBinder.java#L311 and see here for how to write to the parcel: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Parcel.html\nOne little concern: the parcel layout may be version dependent, but lets ignore that for now.\nNice challenge for a Sunday morning ;-)\nIf you use Hangouts/XMPP and want to chat, please contact me here to exchange addresses if you like: http://forum.faircode.eu/contact/\n. This is the layout of the Parcel (taken from StackOverflow):\nreply.readException();\nid = reply.readString();\nSo, create the fake Parcel with:\nwriteNoException();\nwriteString(fakeValue);\n. One other thing: you should test for the transaction code:\nbinder.transact(1, data, reply, 0);\nSo, like this:\nint code = (Integer) param.args[0];\nif (code == 1)\n  ...\n. Change to:\nMethod methodObtain = Parcel.class.getDeclaredMethod(\"obtain\", int.class);\nNote that this has been changed on Lollipop:\nhttp://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/ext/com.google.android/android/5.0.2_r1/android/os/Parcel.java#Parcel.obtain%28int%29\nAlso, you need this to rewrite the Parcel:\nreply.setDataPosition(0);\n. Which Android version are you using?\nAndroid 5.x:\nhttp://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/ext/com.google.android/android/5.0.2_r1/android/os/Binder.java#435\nEarlier versions:\nhttp://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/ext/com.google.android/android/4.4.4_r1/android/os/Binder.java#393\n. I have corrected the links in my previous comment\n. param.setResult(true);\nShould be for code 1 only.\n. Then change to:\nXposedHelpers.findAndHookMethod(\"android.os.Binder\", loadPackageParam.classLoader, \"execTransact\", int.class, int.class, int.class, int.class, new XC_MethodHook() {\n. You will first have to integrate this code into XPrivacy. Take a look at the XBinder class (or any other X-class) about how to do this and write a similar class, which you should reference from XPrivacy. You'll see it is simple.\nXPrivacy uses an abstraction layer around Xposed, so it can easily be replaced by another framework.\n. I can do this easily, but I think it is good if others learn how to do this as well.\n. Me = M66B\nWhy are you asking?\n. The argument (integer or long) depends on the Android version.\n. I don't see why the existing contact restrictions cannot be used for what you want.\n. Same question on XDA, so I am closing this issue.\n. You are welcome to contribute code, if you are willing to maintain it as well, but this can be done by restricting contacts and allowing individual contacts as well.\n. A few more remarks:\n- There is no Google contact provider, but only an Android contact provider\n- Building a replacement for the Android contact provider is a huge project\n- Even if this succeeded, uninstalling XPrivacy would make the contacts go away, in effect making applications dependent of XPrivacy. This is undesirable\n. XPrivacy should not have group management for contacts, since it is not a contact manager. XPrivacy is as it is already complex enough.\nAutomatically allow new contacts is privacy wise not a solution. The user should allow things, since he/she is the only one who can judge if it is allowed to allow ;-)\n. Questions should be ask in the XDA forum, so that others can benefit from the answers as well.\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support\nThis problem is caused by a dangerous restriction without usage data.\n. See here #2162\n. Please let me know if this version improves things:\nhttps://crowd.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_3.6.9-1.apk\nI have upgraded the Android support library to version 22.1.0\n. Not really a surprise, but nice anyway!\n. There is absolutely no difference in restricting user and system applications, so there is something else going on.\nPlease be more specific about which restrictions you apply to which application. With the information provided I cannot help.\n. Which restriction(s) should I look into?\nTo be sure: restricting system components was enabled?\n. I have checked, but only the identification category cannot be restricted for system components:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/PrivacyManager.java#L465\nMaybe this is an issue of recent Xposed version.\n. Maybe it is, I will check for the next release.\n. @an0n981 this will be fixed in the next release.\nPlease note that the fix is for another problem as this issue was originally about.\nAndroid system components are not the same as system applications.\n. @an0n981 see this issue for a new version: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/issues/2162\n. This is better discussed on the XDA forum:\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/modules/xprivacy-ultimate-android-privacy-app-t2320783\n. Probably a duplicate of #2182 \n. See here:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ74\nAnd please read this:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support\n. If it works for GetID, it works for any application.\nYou'll need to find the right appliction to restrict.\nYour best bet is to ask for help on the XDA forum.\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/modules/xprivacy-ultimate-android-privacy-app-t2320783\n. Actually community support is better in the XDA forum than here ...\n. Another reason is that I cannot give you an answer to this question (it is not a bug), because I don't use ActiveSync.\n. Function restrictions are exceptions to category restrictions, so the category restriction sometimes needs to be changed when answering on demand function restrictions. In other words: this cannot be changed.\n. I am sorry, but I have no time to help you to learn how to develop software.\n. Can you post a link to the application?\n. I never play games, but thanks for the offer.\nMaybe you can find a free application with the same problem.\n. I have received the gift, but I have problems sharing my Google+ information (quite intrusive in this case).\nCould you please check the usage data for sensor access (not only for the game itself) ?\nThe sensor restrictions are marked unsafe, since the hooks are applied in user space and can thus be unhooked.\n. In theory native libraries could be used to access the sensor directly, but it is not likely this will be done, because it would be difficult to support all devices.\nI will close this issue, since I have no means to look into this.\nIf you find a free application with this same problem, please feel free to comment again.\n. Yes, I claimed Humble Bundle, but installing the game was the problem.\n. Questions should be asked on the XDA forum, so others can benefit from the answers as well:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support\n. The serial number can be set using the settings.\n. Thanks for figuring this out!\nI have been searching for this for ages, but somehow I missed it.\nI didn't merge your pull request, because XPrivacy needs to support pre-lollipop devices too.\n. True, but I have made this more explicit.\n. What is your XDA user name (for credits) ?\n. http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=60870471&postcount=14967\n. A test version is available here: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/issues/2162\n. I am really glad you found this problem and probably a lot of other people too!\n. And, yes, things like this are quite time consuming. Even testing your fix did cost time and waiting for a complete OAT each time a boot fails is no fun at all too.\n. I was aware of the limitation of hooking native methods, but some of the super alpha versions do support hooking of native methods (and it actually works). I will add a note about this, because I can imagine not everybody knows/remembers.\n. This is all very good work, thanks!\n. java.io.FileNotFoundException: XPrivacy is caused by a (dangerous) restriction and is not a bug.\n. @dk-zero-cool I have already checked if XTelephonyManager hooks are placed and they are, but maybe it should be done at another place, for example if the telephony manager doesn't run with Android anymore, but in a separate process.\nXWifiManager/server hooks are not placed and I couldn't figure out yet where that should be done (it doesn't work when restricting Android: class not found).\n. Will be fixed in the next release (soon).\n. How did you check this?\nAs said on XDA I don't believe this is an issue.\n. Please test again with 3.6.10 and comment again if you still have this problem.\n. This is caused by an earlier problem not in the log.\n. Please read this:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support\n. Everybody having this issue, please state if XPrivacy is running in compatibility mode or not (compatibility move is shown in the XPrivacy about dialog, if it doesn't say compatibility mode, then it is not compatibility mode). Please no questions here about the compatibility mode, it is documented in the FAQ.\n. This seems to be the cause:\nMethod not found hook=phone/Srv_getDeviceId (com.android.phone.PhoneInterfaceManager)\n( I got this reported as support info several times)\nThis function does not exists in Android 5.0.x (but does exist in Android 5.1.x)\n. Solution for both Android 5.0.x and 5.1.x: restrict PhoneSubInfoController:\nhttp://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/ext/com.google.android/android/5.1.0_r1/com/android/internal/telephony/PhoneSubInfoController.java\nAdded advantage: should work for multi-SIM as well.\nSee also issue #2165 \n. @liberatorqjw: why use a half year old unrelated issue for questions? Issue is locked now to prevent other commentators from receiving information unrelated to this issue.\nPlease read this too: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/#support\nAlso: if you cannot solve this issue yourself, I see no reason why you should compile XPrivacy yourself.\n. http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=60928841&postcount=15108\n. http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=60932610&postcount=15131\n. Step-by-step for Android 5.0.2:\nhttp://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/ext/com.google.android/android/5.0.2_r1/android/telephony/TelephonyManager.java#TelephonyManager.getDeviceId%28%29\nCalls internally getDeviceId(int slotId), which calls:\nhttp://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/ext/com.google.android/android/5.0.2_r1/com/android/internal/telephony/PhoneSubInfoController.java#50\nWhich can be restricted:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XTelephonyManager.java#L209\nSo, please check the usage data for this application and make sure you have Srv_getDeviceIdForSubscriber5 restricted.\n. Then the restriction should work.\nWhich application do you use to test?\n. I can fix it in XPrivacy too: run in compatibility mode, but that is not what we want.\n. Given that it works for me (stock Android 5.1) and for @dk-zero-cool (CM12) my best guess is that CM12S is not close enough to stock Android anymore. This might affect more ROMs, so I have disable AOSP mode for all ROMs other than stock ROM.\n. Maybe related to #2201\n. I did test this on my girlfriend's KitKat device :-)\n. You are right, but I have solved it a little different, since I don't like conditions in while statements.\n(not that your code was bad, it is just a personal preference)\n. XPrivacy does not need root.\nXposed does require root, however.\nWithout root it is not possible to modify the behavior of Android.\n. The first XPrivacy log line is:\nW/XPrivacy( 3575): Hooking package=com.android.calendar\nWhich means Xposed seems to be running and that XPrivacy is enabled in Xposed.\nWhat is missing is the call to initZygote (which takes care of starting the privacy service).\nThis could be an Xposed/XPrivacy problem or the logcat is not complete.\nDid you capture the logcat from your PC starting before turning on your device?\n. Try turning your device off and on to make sure it is a full reboot.\n. Given your remark about optimizing each time, I really think this is an Xposed problem.\n. This is caused by running an older Xposed version:\nI/Xposed  (  543): java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: de/robv/android/xposed/SELinuxHelper\nI/Xposed  (  543):      at biz.bokhorst.xprivacy.XPrivacy.initZygote(SourceFile:46)\nI/Xposed  (  543):      at de.robv.android.xposed.XposedBridge.loadModule(XposedBridge.java:437)\nI/Xposed  (  543):      at de.robv.android.xposed.XposedBridge.loadModules(XposedBridge.java:386)\nI/Xposed  (  543):      at de.robv.android.xposed.XposedBridge.main(XposedBridge.java:120)\nI/Xposed  (  543):      at dalvik.system.NativeStart.main(Native Method)\nI am going to workaround this.\n. @kripz there is a FAQ about this.\n. Could you please try this version:\nhttps://crowd.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_3.6.16-1.apk\n. Since @an0n981 didn't have the reported problem (as far as I know), I like to know from @OrpheeGT if this version is working now:\nhttps://crowd.xprivacy.eu/XPrivacy_3.6.16-2.apk\n. @OrpheeGT you can ignore this message, it will be gone in the next release.\n. @an0n981 is your problem solved?\nVersion mismatch means that the Xposed part is a different version than the application part.\nTry to disable and enable XPrivacy in Xposed and reboot after this.\n. I am preparing a new release right now, so better try that.\n. Xposed/XPrivacy have very little overhead and will not noticeable slow down things.\nWhat could slow down things is a slow data storage partition. See the FAQ #1 for a potential solution.\nNote that there is nothing I can do to fix this by changing XPrivacy, because it will not speed up your device or fix hardware problems (which some Samsung devices, notably the S4 and S5, are known to have).\n. Nothing has been changed to these restrictions since 3.6.9:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/commits/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XActivityManager.java\ngetRecentTasks/getRunningTasks/getRunningAppProcesses never returned the own package:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XActivityManager.java#L145\nSo, I will make this a feature request.\n. I have tested this on Android 5.1.1 before and it worked, but I will look into it again.\n. I have on stock Android 5.1.1: \"SIM Subscriber ID: Not Found\", so it works for me.\nTo be sure I have also tried this in XPrivacy compatibility mode with the same result.\nWhat I cannot reproduce, I cannot fix, sorry.\n. Why not read the changelog?\n. I don't have this problem.\nProvide a logcat from boot and maybe we can tell what is going on.\nI will close this issue for now, because without logcat I can do nothing.\n. Restricting a sensor currently hides the sensor from an application.\nThis does not consume any battery, on the contrary.\nFaking sensor data could be useful, but will be low on my to to list.\n. I don't think this is an XPrivacy problem, but there is too little log to tell for sure.\nThis is more likely a resource (memory shortage) problem or a problem with your ROM.\nI will close this issue now, but feel free to post more log lines here.\n. If this happened after an update without rebooting, then this seems to be a bug in Android:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/25317659/how-to-fix-android-app-remoteserviceexception-bad-notification-posted-from-pac\n. Sorry, but this log is not readable this way.\n. Did you reboot after updating XPrivacy?\nDo you have any other Xposed modules active?\n. I have no idea why this happens.\nIn any case this is not a common problem, else at least someone had complained.\nAre you sure the XPrivacy APK file is not modified in any way? \n. An automatic restore has two problems: your privacy is not automatically restored and the real problem is not solved.\n. I am not ignoring anything. There is not enough information about the real problem. XPrivacy will never reset/change restrictions on its own.\n. Restrictions are never automatically removed, so I don't see how a crash/reboot will affect your privacy in a negative way.\n. A corruption of the privacy database does happen, but very rarely. I have had less than a handful reports (using the debug info). Unfortunately Android has no tools installed to fix this and I see no ways to fix this. Creating a second database is not a real solution, because there is no way to know what is the right data. There is also a storage space and performance issue.\n. Both options have as disadvantage you will go back in time, but I see no way to solve this. Importing/exporting is more selective than restoring a complete backup.\nData loss is always a problem and can only be prevented on hardware level. Android devices are not equipped to handle this and we have to learn to live with this.\n. Which Android version?\nCompatibility or AOSP mode?\n. I have looked into this and it appears that requesting location updates by means of intents (this is what BP2 does, which is not very common) cannot be restricted in AOSP mode. I couldn't find the direct reason, but I am afraid the local location manager is handling the updates, which means this can only be solved by switching to compatibility mode.\nI will investigate this further next week.\n. The location manager is not handling this locally:\nhttp://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/ext/com.google.android/android/5.1.0_r1/android/location/LocationManager.java#LocationManager.requestLocationUpdates%28android.location.LocationRequest%2Candroid.location.LocationListener%2Candroid.os.Looper%2Candroid.app.PendingIntent%29\nInvestigating further ...\n. None of the location restrictions seem to work at all ...\n. Apparently IntentFirewall is implemented differently in Android 5.1.1 causing this new problem. I have chosen to not support this (dangerous) feature, so you will have to workaround this problem yourself, sorry.\n. Works for me:\nUpdate application:\nW/XPrivacy( 7760): Package change action=android.intent.action.PACKAGE_REPLACED replacing=true uid=10312\nUpdate service:\nI/ActivityManager(  794): Start proc 3639:biz.bokhorst.xprivacy/u0a312 for broadcast biz.bokhorst.xprivacy/.BootReceiver\nW/XPrivacy( 3639): Hooking package=biz.bokhorst.xprivacy\nI/ActivityManager(  794): Start proc 3657:biz.bokhorst.xprivacy:update/u0a312 for service biz.bokhorst.xprivacy/.UpdateService\nSo, why do you think it doesn't work for you?\nNote that the update service does nothing when there is nothing to update.\n. This has recently been discussed on the XDA forum in relation to WhatsApp, so please use the XDA search to find what I wrote about it.\n. I understand your wish, but technically this is not possible. It will result in system instability.\n. Although I didn't try this (I did try network I/O from the on demand dialog), this would probably result in system instability as well. Also, the clipboard itself is intercepted by XPrivacy itself, which would be another complication.\n. I have written the answer to this question a few times on XDA. In my opinion it is a little bit silly to open an issue to ask a question, so please don't do this again.\nHigh priority are bugs and features which are useful to the majority of the users.\n. These message are just warning, which I have added for Xposed for Lollipop, because in the beginning native methods couldn't be hooked.\n. The green key means an application has permission to use the function or needs no permission to use the function. The green keys are correct, else there would have been massive complaints.\n. If you have questions about the green keys, please use the XDA forum.\n. In any case you have clearly described the problem you have, which is unfortunately not always the case. I have however one question: \"manually apply\" does this mean allow or deny?\nOn demand restricting can be enabled/disable both on category and function level. If you answer an on demand dialog with allow/deny for the category on demand restricting will be disabled for the whole category and the whole category will be allowed/denied.\n. \"Make sure \"expert mode\" is unckecked, deny permission\": the category will be denied.\n\"but the app will have access to all other function you previously restricted - their permanent restrictions will be cleared\": are you sure about this and how did you determine this?\nAs you can see here:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/PrivacyService.java#L2151 \nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/PrivacyService.java#L361\ncategory restrictions are being set when you selected this. There is no other flow (condition) applicable. This means there is going something terribly wrong or that you are doing/seeing something wrong. \n. Okay, now is clear what your problem is.\nThis is however by design. Setting category restrictions never sets dangerous restrictions (actually resets). This is because this has proven to result in a lot of problems for novice users else.\nThere are two use cases\n1. You are novice user: use the category restrictions\n2. You are expert user: use the function restrictions\nExpert users can change dangerous restrictions into normal restrictions (long press in the template view) to work around this limitation.\n. \"Go to Xprivacy and see that only sh has a permanent restriction intact, others are ALLOWED\": they were allowed and to be asked in the first place, so there wasn't anything changed.\nIf the default would be deny when on demand restricting is enabled, a lot of (novice) users would have troubles (and actually did have a lot of troubles when this was in some beta releases) when the on demand restricting dialog times out and default denies (resulting in crashing application and sometimes even in data lost).\n\"So I think in the above post, you are implying that the ones who restrict dangerous functions should never use non-expert mode anyway?\": yes. Basically dangerous restrictions have to be set manually by default for this very same reason.\n\"Another problem is the way the subset of dangerous functions is managed - namely globally and for all templates.\": if a restriction is dangerous or not has to be defined somewhere and doing this per application would be more complicated (and not understood by a lot of user) and be at the cost of performance (since this would result in evaluating this real-time per application).\n. To be practical: set your template to deny and ask always, make all restrictions non dangerous and you will have what you want. This is what most expert users do (maybe with the exception of some functions, but this will come with experience).\n. The category check box state is remembered, so you can set it as you like.\nChanging the behavior of the on demand restricting dialog is not really an option anymore, considering the many existing users.\n. Thanks!\n. For the mention functions are no Android permissions required ...\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/Meta.java#L448\nOr maybe I do not understand what is being meant?\n. The appearance of the green key (=has Android permission) is independent of function usage (yellow triangle). The category green key is based on the function green keys or said differently, the green keys are configured per function in Meta.java. So, I still don't understand the problem I guess.\n. \"Is this correct?\": yes\nThere are really no exceptions for old and new functions in Meta.java.\nAnd also not while evaluating permissions:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/PrivacyManager.java#L1387\n. Thinking again, this behavior is the intended behavior. Not requiring a permission is not a real permission, which is taken into account when filtering. Remember that XPrivacy does not use Android permissions other than for displaying things. In the beginning I even refused to do something with Android permissions.\n. Novice users should stick to category restrictions and expert user and in general more privacy minded users should look into function restrictions. Green key means has Android permissions, which is always correctly reflected on category level, but has the issue as described here. Making everybody happy is difficult ...\n. Please add a screenshot showing the problem you have.\n. You are asking me to fix something. I am asking you to document the problem, so I don't have to guess what needs to be fixed. I am asking for a screenshot, because I don't understand your problem.\n. I am afraid this is an Android problem, but I will see if I can reproduce this and workaround it.\n. Thanks!\n. All IPC restrictions are handled by a security exception, so this is completely normal.\n. Thanks for your contribution!\n. This is most likely caused by a restriction and should be discussed in the XPrivacy XDA forum.\n. The first moment I can look at this is Sunday. I have a bad mobile internet connection at this moment only. If you post a few error lines into this issue, I will take a look earlier.\n. 'I believe the E/XPrivacy errors are not a good sign': they are not a good sign, but also not the cause of your problem. DeadObjectException means a client detects a service died. You will have to find the cause for the services to die, which is also the cause/consequence of the reboots you are experiencing. Search for \"FATAL\" in the logcat. My best guess: Xposed is unstable.\n. This is more a question than a feature request, so this is better discussed in the XDA XPrivacy forum.\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support\n. This is too little information to work with.\nDid you check the data usage of the application and of all application?\nDid you restrict all location functions or only the location category?\nDid you try to restrict the location for Play services? (be aware of any location caching).\n. Please read this:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support\n. The system server is crashing. This is probably not caused by XPrivacy, but more likely caused by an unstable Xposed version.\n. Please provide a logcat. Search for \"FATAL\" in the logcat.\nWithout logcat there is little that can be done.\n. This issue is missing important information.\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support\n. I am missing steps to reproduce, a link to the application used to test and a logcat with XPrivacy logging enabled.\n. I will add a (dangerous) restriction for queryIntentActivities, but you'll have to wait at least a week until I have returned home again.\n. This is too complicated (too slow and will give maintenance headaches). It is better to allow only the own package and filter the rest.\n. Even then I don't want to maintain such a feature.\n. That is why I have marked this issue as an enhancement (=feature request).\n. Can you please find the part with 'FATAL' and post a few lines above it and some more below it? Most bootloops are caused by an unstable Xposed version.\n. The ART runtime is crashing, so this is most likely caused by a buggy Xposed version and therefore not an XPrivacy problem.\n. Please provide steps to reproduce and a logcat with XPrivacy debug logging enabled.\n. I am sorry, but the logcat is too long to look through on my mobile phone (I am currently on the road).\nDid you check the usage data for (dangerous) restrictions which are not yet restricted?\n. @an0n981: good work! With the name of the intent, I can add a new restriction. Do you know the intent (action) name?\n. Yes, this intent can be restricted in the messages category. Please try again by restricting all functions in the messages category and please check the usage data again.\n. Dangerous restrictions are treated like all other restrictions by the XPrivacy core, so the logcat will list them as any other restriction.\nLooking at:\n10033/android.provider.Telephony.SMS_RECEIVED(null;null) messages=!restricted?\nreceiving SMS was simply not restricted and since this issue contains all information now how to solve this, I will close this issue.\n. It would be helpful to know which application this uid belongs to, since there might be a helper application doing the SMS stuff or the intent may be attributed to the wrong uid (although this is not very likely).\n. This says not restricted:\n10033/SmsProvider(content://sms/inbox;null) messages=!restricted\nNote that I am currently traveling and cannot do much and even if I could, there is little I can do if I cannot reproduce this. So, maybe find another application with the same problem.\n. So, we have to figure out how these applications receive an SMS.\n. I am sorry for this, but as an excuse: there are so many Android APIs (for Lollipop alone more than 5000 new ones), which I did research as good as I could, but it is inevitable I missed something and in this respect it is a pity nobody is helping.\nI have no idea yet how the SMS is being read.\n. Please send me the code charges and the errors you get by PM and I will take a look.\n. @define this intent can be restricted already\n. @define: can you please provide the complete manifest (preferable through a gist link ?\n. Given that the standard SMS application can be restricted (intent SMS_RECEIVED):\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XActivityThread.java#L44\nThe SMS is likely being received in another way, but unfortunately I have no idea how.\n. @define unfortunately there is nothing in the manifest regarding automatically receiving and processing of SMS messages (except for the corresponding permission).\n. Only if I really need to, I will decompile an application. I would not be surprised when WhatsApp is obfuscated.\n. @bonanza123 what I need to know is how these applications receive/read an SMS. They are not using the standard method of listening to the intent android.provider.Telephony.SMS_RECEIVED.\n. Xposed for Android 5.x needs to be installed in another way. See the Xposed XDA forum threads for details.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks again!\n. If you want something fixed, you need to describe steps to reproduce and details about what is wrong. Just saying it doesn't work, is insufficient.\n. Please read this carefully:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support\n. Most of this information will not be restricted. There is a FAQ about this. Fingerprinting is something which cannot be prevented anyway under Android, since Android exposes really a lot of stuff (this is just a tiny part of it).\nLet me know if you find real unique identifiers though, which can identify you.\n. A little more explanation: fighting fingerprinting is a lost battle, because Android and the underlying Linux kernel are just too open. Restricting the Linux kernel cannot really be done by an Xposed module (only indirectly by restricting the file system, but this can be circumvented by native code). There is also another problem: too many restrictions will slow down the system too much. It doesn't matter if a restriction is active or not, since checking if a restriction needs to be applied takes most of the time in most cases. There is also the problem that certain restrictions can lead to problems with developers with deep pockets, like game developers. This is one of the reasons I don't want the device model be changed by a restriction for example. Last but not least, too many restrictions will not be maintainable. There are already too many, more than 400. There is still just one developer, who has other things to do and other interested as well.\n. It simply means that I don't want unnecessary trouble, in the interest of everybody, with other developers. Restrictions can be used for game cheating for example.\n. Maybe, but this is far outside the scope of XPrivacy.\n. Cheating and faking the device model are just examples.\n. I don't think this is caused by a bug, but is caused by a restriction.\nPlease read this:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support\n. Maybe this FAQ can help:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ63\n. I will never buy a Samsung device ;-)\n. The problem I have with Samsung is that they seem to have difficulties with open sourcing things each time, which hinders custom ROM development and also due to Samsung customizations Xposed development. For this reason I prefer to buy Nexus devices. These devices are supported for a long time (18 months and now even longer) and the software is almost always open source. I hope the stagefright security problem will help to get a better update policy in the Android world. It proves undeniable that this is a necessity.\n. This problem has been reported before and is most likely caused by a bug in you ROM.\nXPrivacy creates notification through the Android APIs in a standard way, so there is little that can be done to workaround this problem.\n. This is most likely an Xposed problem.\n. Crashing native code is almost always caused by Xposed, especially if libart is involved.\n. Unfortunately I have no idea how the microphone is being accessed.\n. The media restrictions are defined here:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/Meta.java#L269\nAudio.startRecording, MediaRecorder.start or MediaRecorder.setOutputFile should prevent recording of audio, video, etc.\nRecord.Audio.permission should prevent audio recording by revoking the permissions (full application restart needed).\nWhat I am missing in this issue is the steps to reproduce.\nHow is the microphone being used?\n. Note that applications can circumvent these restrictions by using a native library (that is why they are marked unsafe). Using Record.Audio.permission will prevent recording of audio even for native libraries, however.\n. @thomaswhite-cz how do you imagine \"looking deeper in system\"? Can you contribute something?\n. I am quite sure this is not caused by a bug but by a restriction.\nI don't know which one, however.\nYour best bet is to ask for help in the XDA XPrivacy forum.\nPlease read this too:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support\n. I am quite sure if the on demand dialog is shown, the function will be marked as used.\nSo, please check again and check if you are looking atthe right application (uid).\nNote that all restrictions are handled the same way, so if it works for one restriction it will work for all restrictions.\n. If there is an on demand popup, there is usage data, I am quite sure about this.\nCheck the exact uid and permission mentioned in the on demand dialog.\n. The condition for the on demand dialog being displayed is that on demand restricting is enabled and that usage data is enabled:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/PrivacyService.java#L640\nThe condition for usage data being registered is that usage data is enabled:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/PrivacyService.java#L662\nMeaning that I am quite sure the one implies the other.\nThere could be going something wrong with registering usage data, but investigating such problems requires a logcat. Please keep the logcat as short as possible, I do not look at logcats containing thousands of log lines.\n. I see Invalid secret.\nDid you restart your device after updating XPrivacy?\nThis could also be an Xposed problem.\nAre you using Cydia Substrate?\n. There is a check in the privacy service, to see if the sender of the usage data is legitimate and this check triggers in your case, see here:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/PrivacyService.java#L700\nI have no idea what is causing this.\n. The security check is there for a reason and I will not release a version without this check.\nYou can always build a version with this check disabled yourself.\n. All code is on GitHub, even the server software\n. This known problem cannot be fixed, because of Android limitations.\n. This has been discussed in the XDA XPrivacy forum not so long ago, so please check the discussion about this and what I said about it. The discussion was about WhatsApp, but it is the same question.\n. There are no bugs in contact white/black listing, but it may not function as you expect/want to. This cannot be fixed without putting a lot of time into this. I have put already really a lot of time in contact white/black listing and I am not willing to put more time into it, also because I expect it can only be improved marginally. The Android contact provider is complex and not designed with XPrivacy in mind.\n. Thanks!\n. Thank you very much for this!\n. Thank you very much again!\n. The color of FAQ 69 refers to the colored vertical bar in front of the applications.\ngrey is basically the default state, which turns into orange after most changes of the restrictions and which turns into green after submitting the restrictions to the crowd sourced restrictions server. This is to encourage sharing of restrictions settings.\n. Indeed there are some exceptions (which all have a history of discussions).\nBasically it is what FAQ 69 says: Orange: fetch, new/updated application, delete restrictions\nSo, fetching from the crowd sourced restrictions, installing a new application, updating an existing application or deleting all restrictions for an application (which happens also when disabling restrictions in the main application list) will set the color to orange.\n. See this FAQ:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#FAQ74\nPlease read also this:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support\n. Thanks again for your contributions!\n. Sorry, but XPrivacy is not meant to fix bugs in other applications and/or system components.\n. I missed this. Could you please make a pull request to add the old anchor as well. Post #1 is not the only thing pointing to the GitHub documentation ...\nGitoffthelawn notifications@github.com schreef op 25 september 2015 23:05:23 CEST:\n\nWhen we updated README.md, the anchor for the FAQ changed (I added\n\"FAQ\" to the text to improve search accessibility).\nSo, in post number 1 in the XDA thread, the anchor to the FAQ needs to\nbe updated as well. Furthermore, there is now an HTML anchor available\nfor the screenshot section, so that can be added to XDA post number 1.\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/issues/2265\n. This is a deliberate choice, so that accidentally disabling the category restriction doesn't erase the maybe carefully chosen function restrictions (which are in fact exceptions to the category restriction). Moreover, changing this behavior now, will affect a lot of existing users.\n\nGitoffthelawn notifications@github.com schreef op 26 september 2015 00:10:59 CEST:\n\nI discovered the issue below while teaching someone how to use\nXPrivacy.  It's possible the behavior is by design, but it is not what\nI (or the student) expected.\nTo reproduce:\n1. Go to Options > Template\n1. Scroll down to Sensors and expand the category\n1. Ensure the Sensors category is selected, as well as every item\nwithin the category.\n1. Uncheck both checkboxes for acceleration\n1. Collapse the Sensors category\n1. Uncheck both checkboxes for the Sensors category\n1. Check both checkboxes for the Sensors category\nAt this point, if you expand the Sensors category, you will notice\nthat despite checking both checkboxes for the category, the\nacceleration item will remain unchecked.  I think this is different\nthan what most users would expect (in the UI world, we call this\n\"violating the users expectations\").\nAlthough this behavior does make sense for the task of\nenabling/disabling a category, it can result in common mistakes, and\nthus data accidentally being exposed.\nWith the current behavior, the only way to ensure that all\n'non-dangerous' items with a category are really being restricted by a\ntemplate is to open up each category and scroll through all the items. \nCategories without 'dangerous' functions are not affected, since the\npresence/absence of a checkmark alleviates this issue.\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/issues/2266\n. I don't like options, unless necessary.\n\nTo be consistent with the check box in the application list, I envision a question weather to erase the restrictions or not when removing the category check mark.\nCerberus-tm notifications@github.com schreef op 26 september 2015 05:02:19 CEST:\n\n@Gitoffthelawn That is not such a bad idea! I often forget that I had\nunchecked some permissions when I re\u00ebnable a category. It does require\nan extra tap, though, so perhaps this should be options (an option in\nsettings). Or perhaps it would be too much work to be a high priority\nin development of the application, I don't know.\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/issues/2266#issuecomment-143393537\n. Also, there is already an implicit option: using the function restrictions requires agreeing to be an expert user. For this reason I will set this feature request to low priority.\n. I guess you mean the expert mode you can toggle using a check box in the main settings. What I mean is the implicit expert mode which will be enabled after answering yes to the question when drilling down a category for the first time.\n\nIf you have the opportunity: clear all data using the (expert) button in the main settings and drill down a category restriction to see what I mean.\n. IMHO the question is pretty clear and new users should not answer to be an expert.\nWhile developing XPrivacy I have cleared all data so many times that XPrivacy is probably not very useful to me anymore.\n. Thanks for the quick fix!\n. I will update post 1 later, when I can use a desktop computer.\n. Yes, this is better!\n. Thanks again!\n. I am glad somebody finally improves my English!\n(I am not a native speaker)\n. This is what the crowd sourced restrictions are for:\nhttp://crowd.xprivacy.eu/\n. If a restriction works for one application, it works for all applications, so there is no bug. The application might be caching the value or even have stored it. Ask on the XDA XPrivacy forum if somebody knows more.\n. Please ask your questions in the XDA XPrivacy forum.\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support\n. Thanks!\n. Import cannot be automated for security reasons.\nFor your next question, please read here:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support\n. In my idea this is no intended behavior, which can confuse people, so I have marked this issue as a bug. Since this bug has been existing for a long time and nobody complained, I have marked it as low priority.\n. White/black listing is being processed here:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/PrivacyService.java#L595\n. I am wondering now what black listed should mean, especially what is being black listed.\nA possible interpretation could be that the category is restricted, but the function isn't and the black list reverses this, but this could be confusing as well.\nThe only other option I see, besides removing black listing, is that a black list reverses a not restricted function.\n. @Gitoffthelawn on demand restricting is only a means to select restrictions run time, so I would like to leave this outside this discussion for now.\n. @Gitoffthelawn Square: Only restricted by blacklist: there is already a white list icon that will be shown for a black list as well (although I haven't checked this, but it probably will).\n. What I understood and what I also see as a problem is that black listing stays in effect, even after disabling the function restrictions.\n. Disabling restricting should disable restricting, else people will be confused. Explaining the reverse in a FAQ doesn't take away it is unexpected behavior.\n. Yes, IMHO it is.\n. What has this to do with privacy?\nI don't think this is possible, because WebRTC is likely implemented in native code.\n. Fingerprinting is a lot battle on the Android platform, since it is simply to open for that. For this reason I am gong to close this issue. This has also to do with the decreasing interest in XPrivacy and the limited time I have available nowadays to work on XPrivacy.\n. I am leaving this issue open for developers wanting to contribute code.\n. The problem with the on demand dialog is being described in the limitations section. The crash is probably caused by the restrictions, but only a logcat can reveal the real cause.\n. If you capture the logcat in real-time from a connected PC, you will able to catch the details of the crash.\n. Note that I estimate the chance that this is caused by a bug in XPrivacy to be a low chance.\nTherefore I will close this issue, but I will look into a logcat when provided (you can still comment, even if the issue is closed).\n. This is how it is supposed to work (according to Google).\nThe search field is implemented by using the compatibility library of Google.\n. Before you ask: this cannot be changed, I have looked into it in the past.\n. https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/SearchView.html\n. Please ask questions in the XDA XPrivacy forum.\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/modules/xprivacy-ultimate-android-privacy-app-t2320783\nPlease read this as well:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/#support\n. I don't think this is a bug: to use function restrictions, you need to restrict the category first, since the function restrictions are exceptions to the category restriction.\n. Every application has these permissions (actually there is no Android permissions at all for this).\n. I would be grateful if you looked through the texts here:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/NetGuard\n. The Android permissions for all restrictions are defined here:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/Meta.java\n. Yes, please and testing NetGuard would be welcome as well.\n. I like to keep the UI as consistent as possible, so I don't like to have a special indication for this.\nThe application has in fact access is what matters.\n. Yes, please\n. It is neither intentional, not a bug.\nWhen the slider is turned off, the hooks will do nothing.\n. First of all most hooks (about 400) are done at system startup. These books are shared for all applications and this cannot be changed.\nThere are a few hooks which are done just before application startup, mostly needed to dynamically hook Google stuff. These could in theory be avoided when the slider is off, but it is just a handful hooks for methods not often used, so it is not worthwhile to write code for this.\n. XPrivacy is open source, so you can always take a look yourself.. XPrivacy is a hobby project and not a commercial project, so this cannot be fixed for money.. @ChromeModz tell that to the Xposed developer.\nLet me repeat here once more what I have written already too many times in the XPrivacy XDA forum: Xposed is not a suitable basis to put a lot of work into XPrivacy anymore. Basically Xposed is dead. Furthermore, rooting has/is becoming increasingly difficult, so fewer people can run Xposed/XPrivacy. So, the correct 'incentive' is to do nothing anymore.\nEdit: I have just learned that there was an official Xposed version released for Android Nougat. However, that doesn't change the situation for me. See also here: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=74083373&postcount=18161. @Namnodorel that was called PDroid and that didn't go well.. PDroid was a real integration into the OS. The real problem was which version/variant/flavor of Android, which resulted in a working solution only for a few devices and a maintenance nightmare.. @ChromeModz I still call Xposed dead, at least as basis for XPrivacy, because history has proven we cannot rely on timely updates. Building something serious like XPrivacy on Xposed is risking wasting a lot of time that I can use better.. Some texts are use in multiple places for slightly different functions. Did you check if this text is used in one place only?\n. I don't think there is a code search on GitHub, never heard of it in any case.\n. Root cloaking is not supported, sorry.\n. Also, these functions are marked as dangerous for a reason, so crashes can occur.\n. I don't know.\n. I don't know.\n. XPrivacy is open source, so you can easily check yourself. GitHub has even a compare view. The point is your use case is not supported, XPrivacy is meant to protect your privacy, not to hide root.\n. XPrivacy is a free and open source project, so you are free to contribute this feature if you like.\n. Donations are completely voluntary, like my work for this project.\n. What is the bug?\n. Please provide a logcat capture from your PC, with capturing started before powering on the device.\n. Like in the previous logcat, I don't see Xposed initializing XPrivacy, so this is most likely an Xposed problem.\nTo be exact, thus method is not being called, which sets up most hooks:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XPrivacy.java#L32\n. I need to see the logging from 'Init path=...'\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XPrivacy.java#L33\nDo you have LBE installed? If so, that is the reason:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XPrivacy.java#L35\n. Somewhere in the logcat.\n. Nothing wrong here.\nI am wondering which problem you have with XPrivacy.\n\"I'm encountering bug on XPrivacy startup.\"\nWhat does this mean?\n. You can ignore the popup.\nFor the on demand popups not appearing: make sure this is enabled globally and for the application.\nIf it still doesn't work, try to enter the quirk freeze.\nIf it still doesn't work, I need to see a logcat where an on demand is attempted.\n(log lines starting with \"On demand\")\n. On demand restricting is handled here:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/PrivacyService.java#L1467\nIf there is no on demand restricting logging, then on demand restricting is most likely disabled, either globally (main settings) or in the application specific settings (per restriction). Note that on demand restricting for system application can only be enabled by using a quirk. Another note: the upgrade process need to have been executed, so you might need to reboot once after installing XPrivacy. As a last possibility, but I have never received a report about this, your ROM is incompatible with on demand restricting.\n. Restricting locations is not something simple with Google Play services around.\nTry something simpler, like your device ID.\n. Please enabled XPrivacy debug logging in the main settings and capture another logcat from device boot.\n. I am coming to the same conclusion as before: Xposed doesn't initialize XPrivacy, so it can't work.\nI am missing this logging:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XPrivacy.java#L33\nThis is an Xposed problem, because if initZygote isn't called, XPrivacy will not hook.\n. I don't know, but XPrivacy needs to be initialized by Xposed for it to work.\n. If other people have the same problem, they should report here to increase the chance to find the cause.\n. My best guess is still that this is caused by Xposed, since initZygote isn't being called.\nWithout this initialization call XPrivacy cannot work.\n. So we have had some confusing here.\nPlease collect all 'E/XPrivacy' from a logcat, so we can see what is going wrong.\n. This is just a warning.\n. ZygoteInit is where Android is being initialized. All call stacks in Android are part of ZygotInit.\ninitZygote is called by Xposed before Android is being initialized.\n. Looking again I seem to have missed the cause of this problem:\nMethod not found hook=null/systemReady (com.android.server.am.ActivityManagerService)\nThis will result in XPrivacy not being initialized properly.\nThis ROM has a non standard activity manager service, which I haven't seen before.\nIs this ROM open source?\n. I need the layout (fields and methods) of com.android.server.am.ActivityManagerService.\n. @ukanth still there is this message\nMethod not found hook=null/systemReady (com.android.server.am.ActivityManagerService)\nWhich means the class is found, but the method is not.\nI cannot really debug this issue, since I don't have a device running OxygenOS.\n. @Phoost thanks for the offer, but it is too complicated.\n. @ukanth \nDebugging Xposed modules is not easy.\nFirst check: is this being executed:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XPrivacy.java#L124\nSecond check: is this being executed:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XPrivacy.java#L360\n. This is not a real exception, but a warning.\nThe privacy service is in in any case registered and system hooked.\nNext step: concentrate on one of the hooks for which a restriction is not working. Check it out if it is being hooked and being executed.\nSince the privacy service is running, you should be able to turn on XPrivacy debug logging using the main settings, so you can see a lot more on the next reboot.\n. Thanks for the translation update!\n. You can reach me at marcel(plus)xprivacy(at)faircode(dot)eu\n. I don't see a bug.\n. This is not a bug, because AOSP mode has not been tested with SDK 22\n. There is a FAQ about this and it has been discussed many, many times on XDA.\n. XPrivacy is meant to prevent reading privacy sensitive information only.\n. Any restriction is done by yourself, so unrestrict what you restricted.\nPlease use the XDA XPrivacy forum for question.\nGitHub is for feature requests and bugs only.\n. Only reading files can expose privacy sensitive data, not writing files. Making it possible to block writing files will only result in questions, without any benefit to your privacy.\n. Applications cannot read and write files of other applications without root permissions.\n. An application cannot see files in system folders, but can see files in shared storage if it has appropriate permissions. \n. Don't know will deny non dangerous restrictions and allow dangerous restrictions for 15 seconds.\n. It does what I have described.\n. I think a bug of unlikely after so much time and so much users, but you'll never know.\nEnabling debug logging, which will allow down your device a bit, and inspecting the logcat might tell.\n. https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/PrivacyService.java#L1968\n. Contacts in the whitelist will always be allowed, regardless which of the three buttons you use.\n. Don't worry too much, we are not machines.\n. I don't think this is a bug.\nContact groups are not always real contacts.\nThis feature should be removed, because it raises more questions than it is worth.\n. Contact restrictions are complex, I spent already a huge amount of them on them. What there is now is the best I can do. If groups do not work properly, they will removed, because I don't won't to spend a lot of time again. I have written something similar on XDA too a while ago.\n. XPrivacy will by design not get slower when there are a lot of accounts, contacts and/or applications selected.\n. The progress bar reflects mainly how much time the contacts provider takes to deliver the contacts.\nXPrivacy will not slow down when there are many contact restrictions in place.\n. I think we had a misunderstanding, I was referring to the contacts whitelist loading.\nAnd no, the loading you mean cannot be made faster. This has been asked often on XDA and explained accordingly. Basically there are just a lot of restrictions/settings to check for each application (about 500) multiplied by the number of applications it will just take significant time.\n. Contacts are whitelisted\n. Thanks\n. Thanks again!\n. Maybe you can take a look again at the NetGuard documentation with your eagle eyes ;-)\nhttps://github.com/M66B/NetGuard\n. Wasn't there an Ukrainian translation already?\n. As far as I can see it is an addition, not an update.\nCan you please fix this?\n. There is a FAQ about license problems, did you check the suggestions already?\nRamin Quluzade notifications@github.com schreef op 24 december 2015 13:33:04 CET:\n\nIve got rooted Xperia Z Got license by donating, put license in root sd\ncard, restarted phone, app still redirects me to buy mr license when i\nwant to import restrictions\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/issues/2313\n. With a million users it is quite unlikely that there is a bug in the on demand restricting.\n\nI miss details and a logcat, so there is nothing I can look into.\nDid you allow a function with specific parameters?\nDid you take into account the caching time?\n. Whitelisted parameters are exceptions to normal restrictions.\n. I like to see this approved by someone else.\n. Unless you suppress notifications, for example using an Xposed module, XPrivacy will notify you when it is disabled.\n. This is most certainly caused by an XPrivacy restriction.\nNote that XPrivacy does not have a log file itself.\nProvide a logcat and I might tell you which restriction.\nSee the FAQ for how to acquire a logcat.\n. There has recently been questions answered about restriction locations to an application in the XDA XPrivacy, please read these answers.\nInternet access can be restriction by the (dangerous) function restriction inet in the internet category. Note that this restriction requires a full application restart to be applied.\nXPrivacy is not there to prevent detection of your phone, but to protect your privacy.

There is a FAQ about this with suggestions.\nIf this doesn't help I need a logcat.\n. https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#frequently-asked-questions-faq\n. Then I need a logcat captured from your PC, starting before turning on your device.\nThere is a FAQ about capturing logcats.\n. It was made available by the Xposed developer.\n. I trust the Xposed developer, so it was downloaded.\n. Accounts are exported and can be imported, but only onto the same device.\nI still support XPrivacy and I will fix critical bugs. I have written on this on XDA.\n. Updating your ROM version is probably the cause, since it might the device ID to change.\n. You'll need to define a template to be applied to new applications. For follow up questions, please use the XDA XPrivacy forum.\n. If you are trying to build yourself, it is assumed you know how to and you are able to solve any build problems yourself, else you should use the published builds.\n. This is a cause of restricting contacts. Some applications add the contacts again from their external server. This cannot be fixed \n\"Thomas K\u00e4rgel\" notifications@github.com schreef op 17 februari 2016 10:53:21 CET:\n\nI restricted access to my contact list for specific apps.

You are welcome to contribute this change if you like.\n. https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/issues/2324#issuecomment-180474810\n. Thanks\n. This check box means clear existing restrictions before applying fetched restrictions.\n. XPrivacy is an open source community project, so you could contribute this to the project.\n. XPrivacy Pro with community rules referenced in this issue also is a payable app. Definitely not the cheapest I might add. Informative documentation is expected at this point and don't get me even started on the whole community rules implementation. A measily template is everything that the software is capable of automatically applying upon the installation of the app - where is the auto community rule download? Auto community rules update? Block app execution if community rule is not found?\n\nEverybody wanting to get the pro features visits this page, where you can see that contributing to the project is completely voluntarily. I think it is fair that \"voluntary\" applies to myself as well. I am paying for the crowd sourced restrictions servers and have contributed more than 2500 hours to the XPrivacy project. What did you contribute?\n. Global settings just work and can be overridden by application specific settings.\nRestricting locations is tricky, since many applications acquire a location through Play services.\nYou can restrict locations for Play services, but you will restrict for all applications using this route.\nAlso take into account caching.\nThis is more a question, so please use the XDA XPrivacy forum for follow up questions.\nSee also here: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support\n. Thanks\n. See the FAQ about this.\nWhile you are there, please read the support section as well.\n. What is needed is the Geocoder, but I don't know which Google component offers this service.\n.

The pro version of XPrivacy is mainly there to pay for the server for the crowd sourced restrictions, which  is still used a lot and the main reason for people to donate (not pay) for the pro features.\n. Also, XPrivacy is still supported.\nIf critical bugs are found they will be fixed.\n. As a final note: donations are for the work done, not for the work to be done.\n. Please read this: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/#support\n. Please see here about support:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/#support\n. There is a already an issue for this: #2300\n. Please read also this:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support\n. The real solution is to check for the Android version in getInstances and to provide an alternative hook for newer Android versions. This requires some research in newer Android versions.\n.

I need to see a complete logcat with XPrivacy debugging enabled until the crash occurs.\nI have checked the code and have a question: does this crash happen without restricting overlay as well?\n. Possible workaround: disable this restriction:\noverlay/addView\nor simply\noverlay\nSee the FAQ, question 79 about how to.\nPlease let me know if this helps.\n. Did you try the provided workaround?\n. I am surprised that the workaround does not work, since it would effectively disable the restriction. So, please double check if you created the right file with the right content.\nUnfortunately I have no idea what exactly is causing this bug iand I also have no device with MIUI 8, so it will be difficult to fix. In addition my only development device recently died, see the XDA XPrivacy forum for more information.\n. @2FunDevices so, you (and nobody else) did try the provided workaround yet\n@dablado I am not sure what the crash is causing, but adding the system alert window permission to each and every application is not a good idea.\nThis is the XPrivacy addView hook:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XWindowManager.java#L56\n. The crash report indicates that there is no alert dialog shown by XPrivacy.\n. @Pral5 likely a bad download\n. XPrivacy works on Android 6. Make sure your are using a compatible Xposed version.\nBefore commenting again, please read this: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support\n. XPrivacy will report if the Xposed version is out of date.\nThe problem is people using the wrong Xposed version or a buggy Xposed version hacked together by someone. This fragmented Xposed development is one of the reasons why there will be only updates if there are critical bugs found, because basically the foundation of XPrivacy is broken.\n. Thanks!\n. Please do a pull request to fix that.\n. Thanks again.\n. Thanks!\n. When there is a critical bug found, there will be a new release.\n. I am not sure if this is a bug, since there is not enough information to determine it is.\n\"WhatsApp is allowed to use: open, openAssetFile, openAssetDescriptor, openFile, openFileDescriptor, openInputStream, openOutputStream and openTypesAssetFileDescriptor\" are these functions restricted?

In short: first ask on XDA before reporting a bug.. Did you also restrict the dangerous restrictions, especially 'sdcard' and restarted the applications?. Which device? Which Android version? Which Xposed version?. To diagnose this problem I need to see a logcat captured from your PC using ADB, started before you turn the device on.. I am traveling the next four weeks, after that I will take a look. Remind me if I forget it.. @T-vK please provided another logcat with XPrivacy debugging enabled.. My best guess is that is that these three gids needs to be revoked as well too:\nhttps://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/master/include/private/android_filesystem_config.h#126\nIf somebody want to try this, here is the relevant code:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XProcess.java#L91\n. @c33s this has already been discussed on XDA, so please check the XDA XPrivacy thread.. XDA has a search function. Search for crowd funding. It are recent discussions, so reading back some pages is an option as well.. @Fury22 you are welcome to fix this problem, else please read what I have written already several times about updates in the XDA forum.. XPrivacy is a community project and therefore my comment is not saucy in any way.\nThis issue stays open for this reason too, because maybe someday somebody is going to work on it. It won't be me though.\n. @8alucard8 if \"This program is too powerful to die\", then do an effort to find a \"motivated open source team to pass it to\" yourself and don't leave this to others.\nI have done more than my share, but it seems that nobody else is willing to do anything..

Thanks. Once there was such a forum, but everybody kept using the XDA XPrivacy forum, so that didn't work.. It was given enough time and it still didn't work.\nYou can always start your own forum about XPrivacy if you like, but you will see there is no point in doing so.. Hosting doesn't come free to me either.\nNote that XPrivacy is basically free to use.. I am sorry, but I am not going to put effort into this, since the last forum was a failure and it will likely be again.. Setting up and maintaining a forum is not a zero effort.\nAs said the previous forum failed, mostly due to little activity. So, I don't think someone is going to fight spam and abuse day in day out.\nWhy not just start a new XDA thread? If it is useful to others, I will link it from the start post.\n. For security reasons I am not giving any third party access to my servers.\n. As explained, the previous forum wasn't a success either, so I am simply not going to put effort into this.. Since XPrivacy is a community project: sure, no problem, but there are two conditions:\n\nIt should be made clear on all pages of the forum (for when somebody directly accesses a page through a search engine) that a third party (you) maintains the forum and not me.\nThe forum software and contents should be maintained\n\nI will remove the DNS-record if there is spam or outdated information on the forum for an extended period or when the forum is offline for an extended period. In that case there is no way to get the DNS-record back. The same will happen if people ask me personally too many times about the forum.\nIf you like, I will make a link in the start post of the XDA XPrivacy forum to your forum and you are allowed to post about the forum in the XDA XPrivacy thread a few times as well,but don't bother people too much.\n. You blocked loading of the native library with XPrivacy, which will result in an exception.\nCompletely normal behavior.\nEither handle the exception or learn to live with a crash.\nOr do not restrict loading of native libraries with XPrivacy of course.. Please contact me by using the support button in the XPrivacy pro license fetcher or by replying to the e-mail with activation instructions.. Please read the other issue and the support section on GitHub.. Please read the support section before creating new issues.. Possible causes:\n- XPrivacy not enabled in Xposed\n- Incompatible Xposed version\n- Incompatible Android version\nIf you want me to look into the cause, then I need a logcat of the first 30 seconds captured from your PC using adb.\nFor other support, please use the XDA XPrivacy forum..

That doesn't say it isn't an Xposed bug.. Please see the FAQ why this issue was closed.\nThis is clearly caused by a restriction and not by a bug, but I don't know exactly which one. Try to use the usage data to figure it out. Else ask for help in the XDA forum, maybe someone else knows or had this problem before.. For more granular internet control you should use a firewall app, like my NetGuard, see also the FAQ.. Please ask your questions in the XDA forum.\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support\n. In any case the pro license has nothing to do with restricting apps by default.. XPrivacy has 100,000s of users, so this is quite unlikely.. For managing internet connections you can better use a firewall app, like my NetGuard.. This is not what XPrivacy is for. The subject of updates had been discussed in the XDA XPrivacy forum several times.. About questions: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support. Did you enable XPrivacy debug logging?\n. This has been discussed several times in the XDA XPrivacy thread.\nPlease read this too: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support. A similar issue already exists.. @Unpublished I have checked your changes. Maybe it is too early to say this, but simply disabling things is not a real solution. Also, changing things in such a way that it is only compatible with Android N is not a good solution either.\nTo others: this still applies: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=74200941&postcount=18269. @Unpublished I am not working on XPrivacy anymore, so I am not taking \"another approach\". Also, a real developer can find his/her own solutions. Be aware that if you are going to publish your work, which you more or less did by referencing it in this issue, that you are also taking responsibility for the privacy of others.. This question doesn't belong here, please read: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support\nYou are most likely using a buggy Xposed version.. XPrivacyLua is a lot easier to use than XPrivacy and has more features, including blocking analytics, see here: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacyLua/blob/master/FAQ.md#FAQ7. As far as I can see it was just made to build with Android Studio with some minor changes. It won't fix the problems on recent Android versions, so I see no reason to merge this yet.. It doesn't fix problems on older Android versions either, so I see no reason to merge this yet.\nThere is also the question about who is going to support an updated XPrivacy version.. @CircuitSerialKiller why not contribute to the XPrivacyLua project which was designed for and supported for Android 6 Marshmallow and later?. I don't see which privacy holes XPrivacyLua has, especially considering that you can extend XPrivacyLua with custom hook definitions to do what XPrivacy did (and more): https://lua.xprivacy.eu/repo/\nIf you want to compare XPrivacy with XPrivacyLua:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacyLua/blob/master/FAQ.md#FAQ7\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacyLua/blob/master/XPRIVACY.md\nLearning to develop custom hook definitions is much easier than learning to develop an Xposed module: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacyLua/blob/master/DEFINE.md\nActually, my advice is to start with defining custom XPrivacyLua hooks to get an idea about how Android works. If will save you endlessly rebooting your device as well. Developing custom hook definitions can be discussed here: https://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/modules/xposed-developing-module-t3741692. I think it is better to concentrate on XPrivacyLua only, so I am closing this pull request and archiving the XPrivacy project again. Pull requests to add things to XPrivacyLua are welcome, but better contact me first before starting to work on something.. This should be a themed color\n. This should be a themed color\nFor example: I have a green theme and not the standard CM blue (cyan) theme.\n. The filter progress indicator may not be needed on fast devices, but for example on my Xperia mini pro it takes some time, depending on the filter chosen.\n. Why is there a runnable needed here?\nAre you sure this will work on all devices?\n(the runnable does UI work)\n. Didn't know a LocalBoradcastManager existed ...\n. This string should be a resource, so I can be translated\n. Ideally: yes\n. To draw a border around the applications icons I use colorActivatedHighlight.\nIdeally the selected categories and filter  tab should have this color too.\n(I my case the selected tabs have a blue bottom, but my system theme is green, but this could be a mistake in the theme).\n. I am still worried about timing problems.\nAnd it is an ugly hack.\n(which mostly have side effects in the end)\n. expert = dangerous || usage || extra;\nHow can one of these option be enabled if none were enabled before?\n. cSettingExpert should be renamed to cSettingDangerousIgnore\n. My choice would be to have these options always enabled\n. Okay, I see.\nI assumed the expert check box was removed/replaced, but this isn't the case and this is also better.\nThe user now has to confirm he/she is an expert before he/she can use the other options.\n. applyFilter is called by selectRestriction\n. Wouldn't it be better to do this in performFiltering ?\n. Still wondering what the exception handler is for ...\n. I like to keep this simple with just one string: Application restart required to apply\n. setRestricted could return a boolean to indicate a restart is required.\n. Just a detail, I would move this after notifyDataSetChanged\n. I would move this after notifyDataSetChanged (2)\n. Why not do this in the MetaHandler ?\n. getMethod(restrictionName, methodName).isRestartRequired() is a more flexible option.\n. Is getRunningAppProcesses also returning services?\n. It is less complicated to let setRestricted return requires restart.\nwillRequireRestart contains part of the logic in setRestricted, this is easily forgotten when changing the logic in setRestricted.\n.

Yes, it should.\n. Only in the application details view\n. Is it possible to use the asked parameter in stead?\nThis would allow for more flexibility.\n. Maybe the default should come from the restriction parameter.\n. Are there not references to this that should be renamed too?\n. This text is not only for applications, but also for XPrivacy itself (notification)\n. Why not use null as default value to simplify the check for empty settings?\n. I feel safer with a prefix here, like Whitelist..\n. You have done your homework, good!\n. Then we should later the column to be not nullable.\nI will see if this is possible and take care of it.\n. hook should be checked for null\n. I think this should be done even before checking restricted or not.\nThis will also make the result go into the cache.\n. I like to keep this simple, something is white listed or not.\n. extra shouldn't be an empty string, did that happen somewhere?\n. Can't we replace this string by disabling the menu?\nWill save translators work.\n. I don't understand this, I still have to get a feel for this new function, but isn't a white listed entry not always the result of a previous on demand, so implying being asked?\n. I see your point.\n. I think I would go for showing an empty dialog or is there something against that?\nWhen does this happen, isn't there always a white list?\n. Restricted or not should be cached including extra, so this shouldn't be a problem, or do I miss the point of your remark?\n. This needs a synchronized\n. typo here\n. su is also needed here.\n. In fact sqlite3 on Android can give problems for any NULL value.\n. Isn't this a better link?\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication\nOther wikipedia references use no dot after the sentence and parenthesis around the link.\n. 106 dip is Android default, why needs this to be changed?\n. I like to keep the Android default.\nThis can never be a big deal om large screens.\nThe other margin fixes are applied now (unless I missed something) and it looks indeed nicer and makes a little bit more room for the application / restriction names.\nThanks for bringing this to my attention!\n. I had left this, because I don't like to use privacy variable for compatibility reasons, but since this is now been done for Lollipop, you are right this can go away.\n. I try to prevent negated condition for readability, but it really doesn't matter much here.\n. Maybe 'services' should read 'server' for consistence with the rest, but it is an unimportant detail.\n. Why is this needed now?\n. If you were wondering: I disabled this to prevent tripping SELinux (which could result in a bootloop) when reading the 'disabled' file on Lollipop (initZygote may not have access to /data/system on all devices).\n. In general I try to avoid using XposedBridge methods when that is not necessary, so that Xposed can easily be replaced by something else when there is a need, but since this class bridges XPrivacy and Xposed, it is not too bad here.\n. People want to restrict Android too (only available after enabling an option with a big warning), so I am curious why you have added the last part of the condition.\n. Are you very sure about /data/system be accessible by initZygote?\nNot every ROM is AOSP and some manufacturers have very tight SELinux policies.\nAs said before, this can result in bootloops.\n. I guess this have to be removed before building a new release.\n. This link looks strange, is this okay?\nElse this pull request is much appreciated!\n. Are 64 bit devices also officially supported?\n. LOL\n. ",
    "nemchik": "This level of \"sandboxing \" (for lack of better term) seems more like something android itself would need to take on as part of its core system. And I doubt we would get many configurable options like allowing groups to access things together. And at that point the sdcard becomes the only common storage. Root apps would likely be able to circumvent this \n. For the Mac settings in 0.30+ can you add a \"random\" and a\"default/reset\" option or button?\nI suppose the same would be desired for things like IP address, location, and post phone info\n. Neat idea, but may I ask why there would be a need for multiple developers to be putting effort into separate GUIs? Why not those extra devs contribute code and influence the main GUI?\nOnly logical thing I can think of for this would be integration into a ROMs settings similar to superuser in CyanogenMod 10.1 but that requires integration of xposed framework as well, which the dev of xposed has discouraged.\n. My bad, I see it now. I also wasn't updated to 0.39.1 lol\n.

I'm not sure of the specifics of the app, but that's usually why payment apps do not allow rooted devices to run. It's worth considering this before you go patching it up :)\n. Unless I'm missing something, I don't see any loss of \"functionality\" within an app, when the whole system category is blocked. I blocked my \"Authenticator token\" generator app, then copied a code, and pasted it into another app with system blocked. \nThe only time I think you should experience any change in functionality is when you have an app which SILENTLY interacts with the clipboard. Unless I'm missing how this function currently works?\nedit: As I understand it, the \"copy paste\" which we know and love is actually a feature of the Android OS. The ability for an app to silently interact is more of an API feature, which apps can be blocked from doing.

This is closed as a duplicate of itself?\n. Edit: Great! I can't wait.\n[Old: I, too, would really like to see this. For each application, we would be able to set a couple of values to \"new random at boot\", \"saved/fixed random\", or \"custom\". That would be really useful.]\n. I, too, would really like this feature. If a developer or Google or someone else can see when I use an application, it will know when I am doing what. It could link my sleeping hours to my location and/or e-mail account, for example. I don't want some advertising corporation somewhere have my sleeping hours saved in a database! Or, a pattern collated over a long period of time could itself be personally identifiable: different people have different patterns.\nPerhaps this should not have a high priority, but I would certainly appreciate it very much.\n. You can use the Xposed module \"App Settings\" (Google around, it's on XDA somewhere) to set the language for individual applications. I set it to Dutch for Maps/Navigation, because the English pronunciation of Dutch streets is often unrecognisable (I use headphones to navigate while biking). It works perfectly for me. I also use it to set a higher DPI for the Play Store, so that I may see more application in one screen.\n. Hey Marcel and Mnjm, I totally understand where both of you are coming from.\nMarcel, I think \"nice idea, but it seems like x would take too much effort/time to implement and test\", or \"I'm sorry, there are too many others things I need to implement that have a higher priority now\" are perfectly fine reasons. Everybody will understand. I think most people prefer hearing something like that rather than \"I don't want to implement x because it is not what I intended the application to be\".\nIf, instead, you say, \"nice idea, but it will have to have low priority for now\", people will get the impression that they and their idea are valued and appreciated. At least that's how it works for me. Maybe you think this is wishy-washy, but....we humans are only human!\n. Cool! Sure, you can't always make everyone happy. but it's often the way you say it that makes all the difference. Although of course I don't mean to encourage empty Balkendende-speak...\n. Aren't those spoofed codes in Xprivacy only readable by other applications? I presume you can't spoof what the SIM sends to the cell towers. So it's probably no problem. \n. I, too, would love to have this as an option. An automatically shrunk (and ugly) application icon would be tremendously helpful when you're trying to troubleshoot things. Of course I understand if this is a lot of work an not a high priority.\n. Ah, very interesting. I obviously support this, although I have no idea how difficult it would be to implement this. What sensors should be restrictable? All? Frankly I was very surprised that the browser in Android lets websites use the sensors without any use action! \n. \"Can Mobile Accelerometers Spy on Your Desktop Keystrokes? \u2014 The answer to the question above, as security researcher Philip Marquardt demonstrated, is \u201cyes.\u201d However, it\u2019s not all that likely in practice, and there are several simple ways to protect yourself.\"\n\u2014 http://www.xda-developers.com/android/can-mobile-accelerometers-spy-on-your-desktop-keystrokes/\nSo allowing us to block programs from reading the various sensors would be a great addition to Xprivacy, to make it really future proof.\n. Yay! Welcome back.\n. I have no idea whether this will work, but you could try using Titanium Backup to mess with the Huawei Radio application. You could change it from a system app into a normal app, or the other way around, or cut it loose from the Play Store, back it up, delete it, then restore it, etc. Perhaps some of those operations might change its UID. It's free and worth a try, even though it probably won't work.\n. Have you tried rebooting?\n. I have to agree with Siyah here: functional regression in order to make more money is a really big no-no, even if it was not intended that way. I have bought the Pro version in the Play Store long ago, and I have also bought the donation version, so this does not affect me personally, but come on! Think really long and hard about this. Has the regression already been implemented? Marcel, think about your reputation! Many people will feel duped, they will think it was a cheap trick to make them addicted to a function, then take it away in order to force them to pay money (even though I know you didn't mean it like that). People will leave bad reviews all over the Internet, be careful!\n. For comparison, I have no problems at all:\nGalaxy Nexus\nCyanogen 10.1.3\nGoogle Search 3.1.8.914827.arm\nGoogle Play Services 4.0.33.\nXposed 42/36 (latest official)\nXprivacy 1.10\n. I don't entirely understand this. We all agree call statistics are a privacy issue, right? As in a teenager who does not want the nanny application that her mother has installed on her phone to keep track of how many calls she makes. Etc. Marcel says dropping an intent is a problem, but it is only dropped when it is sent to the restricted application, isn't it? Other applications will still receive it? So what would be the problem with that? Or perhaps I don't understand the problem?\n. Do you mean on a new install of Xprivacy itself (not the enabler), as opposed to an update?\nAnd do you mean, do not restrict any permission for the enabler? Or not the relevant ones?\n. I'm afraid I don't understand...but I'm sure things will be all right if I just go about using Xprivacy as I'm used to? No restrictions will be applied by what/whom, what does that mean? Do I need to do something special, or not?\n. Yay! That happens to be exactly what I'm doing.\n. Wow, that is fast! I am amazed.\n. Wow, this sounds great! I recently read about an application that drew a smiling unicorn or whatever on top of the \"allow root\" button in the superuser application, so it could in that way make users unwittingly give it root access. I suppose this new permission (yay!) will also prevent that? \n. I'd really like to see this too! That would make it a lot more accessible for people.\n. At least this one is \"low priority\", not \"closed\". I just guess what those things mean, most of the time, or enable/restrict them at random, as I'm experimenting with an application.\n. Cool, that's good to know. It does sound like a lot of work...\n. I wish I could, but I don't understand what most of the functions mean at all. I still don't even entirely understand the difference between the \"Internet\" and \"Network\" categories (to me, as a layman, the Internet is a network)...I'm too dumb! I once tried Googling one or two functions, but what definitions I found contained lots of other technical terms and expressions that I didn't know either...\n. Wow!! Thank you, Marcel! This could also make Xprivacy even easier to use for new/non-technical users.\n. Wow! This is really cool. Thank you and Jpeg729 a lot.\n. @jpeg729 Oh, that would make sense! So if an application has a new permission it wants after an update, and if this permission is restricted in my template, it will be automatically restricted after the update?\n. Ah OK, very interesting, thank you. Is this in the readme somewhere?\n. @jpeg729 Yes, I have noticed Apply Template often erases my permissions seemingly at random. I have learned to double check whether or not they are applied correctly and reaply if not. I can live with that and take it into account, now that I know it. It probably confuses new users, but, oh, well.\n. I agree.\n. If he means the cell towers, perhaps because your location can be determined based on what towers are nearby?\n. @M66B Oh, you're right, I kind of knew that.\nHiding whether or not you are on Wifi or 3G does actually sounds rather nice. I'm not sure there is any root that users can grip this problem at? If an applications can log when I am on Wifi and when on 3G, that means it can tell when I am at work and when I am home. For example, my (imaginary) boss could tell if I'm away for lunch for too long using the company's application that I had to install on my phone. I know, this is a bit far fetched, and it may not be worth the effort, but it would be kind of nice to hide that from applications.\n. @M66B  If by that you mean it has low priority and it wouldn't be simple to implement, then I totally understand. We can't have everything, time is limited.\n. I'm not entirely sure what you would to see, exactly. A list of only the green-keyed permissions, without having to fold out all categories? Or the same, but with descriptions of what the permissions actually do, instead of the inscrutable names that most of them have now?\n (I would really appreciate more readable descriptions of what the permissions actually mean right inside the application (so not online, which takes a lot longer to open).)\n. You can disable Xposed (as below), then boot, disable/uninstall Xprivacy, reinstall Xposed, and then reinstall Xprivacy. Or I think you can also change settings in Xprivacy while the module and/or framework is disabled. So then you would do disable Xposed, boot, open Xprivacy, change permissions, open the Xposed application, reinstall Xposed from there, and reboot.\n\"In case you get into a boot loop: You can flash the attached Xposed-Disabler-Recovery.zip by Tungstwenty. It will be copied to your (external) SD card when you install Xposed as well. The only thing it does is copying /system/bin/app_process.orig back to /system/bin/app_process, which you can also do yourself (e.g. with adb shell in recovery mode).\nYou could also create a file /data/data/de.robv.android.xposed.installer/conf/disabled, which causes Xposed to be bypassed as well.\"\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1574401\nGood luck!\n. Great idea, and great work! I would prefer the right one, the bar. The borders in the left one look like they might be part of the icon. They seem more likely to clash with icon designs. The advantage of the bar is that there is only one, fixed location for the marker, which is to the left of the icon. Visually, the border and the icon look less like two separate pieces of information than the bar and the icon: the border is not in one location with respect to the icon, but in four.\nI can see the bar lines up with the icon, not with the entire item; but that is a very minor nuisance that is not misleading or distracting in any way.\nAs to the colours, the orange and the green seem to be the exact same shades are those of the key and warning icons to the right; this suggests a relationship between two items of the same colour, which seems undesirable.\n. Hmm but this does not entirely address the issue Kolanich put forward, \"it is not good to have 2 different permissions managers in a system : one supports returning fake data, another can revoke permissions fist don't know about.\" What happens if I use a different permission manager alongside Xprivacy? If the only disadvantage is inconvenience, perhaps that is not a real problem; or is it incompatible with permission managers such as \"Per App Settings\"?\n. But I think the question is, why must Xprivacy be only about privacy, if having a single application for all kinds of permissions would be so convenient?\nAnd do you happen to know whether restricting other permissions (as in the Xposed module \"Per App Settings\") is compatible with Xprivacy? I used the two applications together a while ago, but I didn't mess with permissions in Per App Settings.\n. Okay, that's clear enough, and it should answer Kolanich's question.\n. @jpeg729 Thank you! That is good to know. Then those who need other permissions restricted can use the two together.\n. Your IP is the easiest thing to hide: you can simply use a (free) VPN, like Tunnelbear, and voil\u00e0.\nAnd you can use AFWall+ to only allow an application to access the Internet through VPN.\n. @M66B I've posted a question that you can no doubt answer on Android.stackexchange.com. If you post a short answer of just a few lines, and Vi and I vote your answer up, you will have 20 points and be able to use chat there (Stack Overflow is part of Stack Exchange).\nhttp://android.stackexchange.com/questions/59093/hoe-does-the-application-xprivacy-give-fake-private-data-to-applications\n. I always forget about it too. If you can reduce the wate, grate.\nEither way, it would be cool if we could get a toast \"3 permissions changed for Pink Unicorn Creator\" once the permissions have been fully applied.\n. @amakuramio It is a bit inconvenient to have to use a dozen applications to restrict the access to information and permissions on your device, but it can usually be done; in this case, Root Cloak can hide root from applications in various ways. \nhttp://www.xda-developers.com/android/xposed-module-to-cloak-root-access-from-apps/\nOne issue is that it is hard for us to tell whether such applications are compatible with Xprivacy. If using them together messes things up, we may not even notice. @M66B I understand this may be low priority, but most of the information you mention in the FAQ can also be used to fingerprint us. But I suppose it wouldn't be feasible to integrate code from Root Cloak into Xprivacy.\n. @Jimmy34742  By the way, I have Google Play Services Greenified, and it works fine. I believe I still get application updates and I have no other issues. It says Play Services still occasionaly wake up the phone (as they should). Greenify can hibernate applications without causing them to lose push functionality if they use Google's push service. Of course it may not perform as well on a different device (Galaxy Nexus 4.2.2 Cyanogen here).\n. What would make more sense to me would be if only those check boxes are changed for which there is a clear consensus, and the other boxes are left the way the user had them before fetching the restrictions, with a warning toast. Or is this impracticable? \n. @jpeg729 Exactly!\nP.S. Some kind of notification about which boxes had valid values in the database would be nice, but may not be worth the effort. Or at least a toast message \"some tick boxes have been changed\" or \"no tick boxes have been changed\".\n. Update: I tried restricting access for Google Maps. I have done this in the past, and I remember it worked. But this time, I also had to restrict Network for it to work (specifically, the value getScanResults, but you can just restrict the entire category). Apparently, Google Maps has a way around the ordinary spoofing of the Google location. I don't have Skout. The below is in case you are new to Xprivacy and missed a basic step.\n\nWhen you block location access for an app, what Xprivacy does is send it a fake location. You have been fiddling with the specific ways to potentially send it a fake location; but this will not do anything if Xprivacy is not instructed to block the app from accessing your real location and sending a fake one. To do the latter, you:\n1. Go to the list of applications;\n2. Tap on the icon of the application you want to block/spoof your location for;\n3. Then you see the name of your app at the top, and a scrollable list of categories below it, like Accounts, Browser, etc., and Location. You need to scroll down and check the box next to \"Location\" in order to restrict the app from accessing your real location.\n4. While in the same menu, tap on the icon of your app, press kill. Maybe wait 15 seconds just to be sure, then launch the app again. Step 4 is not needed for all apps.\nPerhaps you already know this, but it is an easy thing to overlook when you're new, I guess. If this isn't the problem, then Xprivacy is not working properly, which could have many reasons:\n- Somehow your phone/ROM is not compatible\n- Xposed has not been properly installed (check in Xposed app)\n- Xprivacy has not been activated in Xposed\n- You have not rebooted yet after activating Xprivacy\n- Some bug in Xprivacy\n- Other unknown cause\n. The check mark next to \"Network\" should mean that you have all non-dangerous values checked under Network, but, just to be sure, are you sure you have getScanResults checked under Network (not Location)? You probably have, and my comment is redundant, but I wanted to make sure people knew there were two values getScanResults, one under Location and one under Network. And the one under Network needs to be restricted in order to spoof locations for Google Maps on my phone.\n. @megamorphg This shell script thingy gets the UID from the app that is currently in focus, based on another shell script I found on the Internet and modified by a friend. There is an issue with dumpsys for the current Windows in Android, so the script gets both mCurrentFocus and mFocusedApp; if the first one is \"null\", it uses the second one; otherwise, it uses the first one. You can store the output in a variable in Tasker.\nawk '/Uid:/ {print $2}' /proc/$(pidof $(dumpsys window windows | awk '{if(/mCurrentFocus|mFocusedApp/){for(i=1;i<=NF;i++){if(sub(/\\/.*/,\"\",$i)){print $i; exit}} } }'))/status\nThis one appends the UID to a text file (change path as you prefer):\nawk '/Uid:/ {print $2}' /proc/$(pidof $(dumpsys window windows | tee -a /sdcard/Download/uid.txt | awk '{if(/mCurrentFocus|mFocusedApp/){for(i=1;i<=NF;i++){if(sub(/\\/.*/,\"\",$i)){print $i; exit}} } }'))/status\nThis gets the package name:\ndumpsys window windows | awk '/mCurrentFocus|mFocusedApp/{for(i=1;i<=NF;i++){if(sub(/\\/.*/,\"\",$i)){print $i; exit}} }'\n. @banderos101  Hear, hear! I second that. I love how Xprivacy is getting better and better all the time, and I especially love this new development of on-demand restrictions!\n. This is all very interesting. I read somewhere in the Pry-Wi thread that some people had it working together with Xprivacy, but I can't find the post at the moment (very busy thread). I haven't tried it myself yet.\nOne thing to consider is that Pry-Fi really wants you to use SuperSU, also made by Chain Fire: what superuser application are people here using? (I use the one that came with CM, which is not SuperSU.)\n. @jpeg729 So what you did was, in Xprivacy, restrict \"Storage\" for Pry-Wi (rather than set it to \"on demand\"), and then Xprivacy worked with Pry-Fi? Good to know.\n. As a user, I would certainly prefer clear categories over fewer categories, and I don't see any category that it could conceivably belong to, so perhaps a separate category is the best option. \nAs to dangerous, I don't think it should be marked as such. Applications won't normally crash if they are set to English by default? And, if they are set to e.g. Thai, you can set it to another language in Xprivacy, so there is no risk of having to navigate incomprehensible menus.\nBy the way, the Xposed module App Settings can also change the locale of an application. I don't know, but perhaps it could serve inspire the way Xprivacy will do this.\nhttps://github.com/rovo89/XposedAppSettings\n. But we could presumably feed a fake cell ID to an application? The user would have to find an ID near his desired location himself, but perhaps some ID's for some locations can be found on the Internet by the user? I suppose it would be nice to have the option to try that, although of course I would understand if this had low priority for you (I probably would not use this myself).\n. Wow! You even manage to implement the low-prio stuff, very impressive! People in China will appreciate this. And perhaps so will we, one day, when Google changes its tactics.\n. The developer/modeator fixed it really quickly, kudos to him!\nMaxmp had this to say on the Poweramp forum:\n\"Posted Yesterday, 06:27 PM\n\"We installed Xprivacy, tested with Poweramp and added workaround. This is a build which works for us. Poweramp-build-549-arm-uni\n\"The issue was with extra arguments checking by either Xposed or Xprivacy for that query() method. This is incompatibility with existing Androids, and it hits apps which do such calls from JNI.\"\nWhat do you think @M66B , has Maxmp found a way to circumvent Xprivacy? Or has he tamed his own app and made it behave \"normally\"? \n. I think Hawaii Kasper has a good point: if you need for an application to know your identity, and the application doesn't have to connect to the Internet all the time, the time data could give it lots of behavioural information. Perhaps this should not be top priority, but it would be useful for our privacy if we could some day spoof time.\n. @jpeg729  So what potentially negative effects do you foresee for spoofing time? If an application thinks it's 13.34 instead of 6.02, what would happen?\n. @jpeg729 I thought the way Google knew your location based on Wifi was because they have a database connecting each Wifi access point with GPS data directly (collected automatically all the time on millions of devices and possibly Street View cars in order to populate the database), not because they link you to your IP address? Mozilla's new alternative location service will work the same way; you can help them collect data by downloading Moz Stumbler on your phone and setting it to \"scan\" once in a while.\n\"If an app doesn't use internet, the importance of restricting is mitigated,\"\n\u2014 The most common scenario where this would be useful is for an application that occasionally connects to the Internet, but not all the time. This could be, for example, only when I'm on on Wifi. A theoretical example would be Swype. If it stores the time stamp when I type certain words 24/7, and sends this time to its servers once a day via Wifi, it will give them a lot of data about me.\nI happen to be thankful enough to Swype to give them those data, but we can't be sure they properly anonymise them, so I can understand why some users might not want to let this happen, while they do want to receive Swype's dictionary updates once in a while.\n@M66B Our of curiosity, how could spoofing the time be \"misused\"?\n. @jpeg729  I know this is possible, but I did not think Google was using this method in Android. The reason I assumed to be threefold:\n- It only works when you are connected to Wifi Internet, which is often not when you need your approximate location;\n- You will probably have a somewhat more accurate location already through cell towers at the same time (your link is about 3 km from me, whereas cell towers get within 750 m);\n- Wifi-GPS coupling the way Google does it already provides a far more accurate location anyway when you're near a Wifi acces point, so there is no real point in additionally getting your IP address (except if Google is trying to circumvent Xprivacy...).\nEither way, I don't think spoofing time should be high priority: I'm just defending the merits of the idea in general.\n. I agree that this would be of lesser usefulness. And I can understand if this is not worth the effort. But, by \"disadvantages\", do you mean the effort it would take to create this category, or something else?\n. Wow, so much great work! I think I paid something like \u20ac 6 for the pro version? And I had already paid the price for the \"Pro enabler\" in the Play store, but I didn't care about paying twice. So I personally don't care about a price increase for myself, but I have to say I would definitely not have paid anything over \u20ac 10, being poor at the moment. And \u20ac 25 sounds like the old days of small Windows applications that nobody would buy. If you price Xprivacy competitively, I'm sure you will sell many more licenses than for \u20ac 10+, and your total profit will be higher.\nAs to the word \"donation\"...you pay money for a pro license, so it's not really a donation, just the price of the pro version. Maybe remove that weasel word. That said, I have absolutely nothing against having paid for the pro license, it was absolutely worth it, I love it!! And Xprivacy is still improving every day! Great work.\nOne more thing, is the Pro Enabler thing still in the Play Store, along with the separate payment for the Pro version? I found that very confusing, I accidentally paid twice even though I only wanted one thing. So I would consolidate all that into a single price for just one pro version, no multiple licenses.\n. @M66B Ah OK, I can see why you want to keep it in the Play Store. And I already see that the description contains this:\n\"...\n\u2022 See here for how to get other XPrivacy Pro features: http://www.xprivacy.eu/\nThe import/export enabler will not allow you the fetch crowd sourced restrictions!\"\nThis should already be enough to make most new people not install it if they want the full features. But it could perhaps be made even less confusing if you began the description like this instead:\n\"If you want only the ability to export/import settings, you can install this Enabler. If you want the full pro features (also including export/import), you can buy the full pro version at http://www.xprivacy.eu for \u20ac5/$7.\"\nThen maybe name two or three features of the full pro version.\n. @M66B Ahh yes, I hadn't considered that. Stupid Google. Then it makes sense not to mention the full paid version directly. Your new first line is indeed an improvement, I think this should be clear enough for new users. They will find their way to xprivacy.eu.\n. The next time, if you want to find out which application has sent a certain toast message, you can install the Xposed module Xtoast, which can show you the name and icon of the application with every toast message.\n. Oh OK, that is good to know: perhaps Xtoast didn't work because it was not a standard Android toast?\n. So it is basically submitted as \"deny\"? Or is it not submitted at all because it's different?\n. In theory, you could allow a user to switch between two whitelist/blacklist modes:\n1. Static but recursive: the list of whitelisted files is only updated when you tap a button in Xprivacy. So when a new file is created in a subfolder, the whitelist will not know about it, until you go to the whitelist settings again to update the list.\n2. Live but superficial: only the upper folder is checked for files to be whitelisted, but it happens every time the application tries to access files.\nOr perhaps a combination of these modes. But I'm not sure this should have priority... I don't think it would matter to me, for now.\n. I completely agree and understand.\n. Waah not the word \"proactive\"! That is just too much.\n. Wow! You're so quick! Many other developers kunnen hier een puntje aan zuigen.\n. Right, both leaf and page can be used in that expression: I didn't actually know one was British and the other American. Oh, and British is the real English, always has been! RP kicks ass! Wait, that was an American expression...\n. Hmm I have to say I have never heard \"rubber\" for eraser. The dictionary gives it without any regional connotation, though. It also has this:\n11. British . a dishcloth. \n. So just to be clear, if I wanted to install an application through recovery, say, flash Google Apps on a new ROM, how do I proceed? Can I just flash Google Apps, then clear and import my old settings from Xprivacy, and everything will be OK?\nOr if I wanted to flash an application onto my existing system, should I first export Xprivacy settings, then flash the application, then clear all Xprivacy data, then import Xprivacy settings?\nOr is the clearing unnecessary in both cases? (Clearing would leave the system unprotected by Xprivacy for a short time.)\n. @an0n981  Ah OK. But what if the application I'm flashing has never been installed on my phone before, so I don't have any settings for it in old Xprivacy files?\n. @an0n981 Hah, I was not sarcastic at all, just ignorant. I just didn't understand what was going in this thread and was worried about what could go wrong if I flashed applications, to what extent I needed to do something different. From what I understood, the part of Android that does the installation of apps does not get triggered when you flash an app, and for a moment I was wondering whether this might mess up Xprivacy's registration of this app or something. But apparently not: I can simply open Xprivacy and adjust its restrictions. I presume the template is not applied automatically upon a flash?\nThe removal of apps through flashing is apparently different. If I understand all of the above correctly, one needs to first export the settings of Xprivacy, then remove the app through flashing, then import the settings again. Or can the exporting/importing also be done after having removed the app?\nAll of this is probably pretty basic to anyone who understands Android or databases. But not to me, alas.\n. OK clear!\nI wonder why Xprivacy and other components of Android work with UIDs anyway, instead of package names? Is there a risk of duplicate package names? What happens when that occurs?\n. Ahh OK, I understand! \n. Hmm I don't know, but wouldn't a special check box \"global settings\" make the most sense, at the top of the list op applications? That would be clear and easy to use.\n. I'm sorry to butt in here, but Baybal says \"Weixin 5.2 checks for timezone and GP market zone to confirm location.\" That means these features are necessary for him to spoof his location. Spoofing location is certainly related to privacy. If you have other reasons not to implement this, like too complicated with too little benefit, then I'm sure he'd prefer to hear that.\n. I suppose he could spoof his location as long as he stays within the same time zone and country?\nIt can still be used to fingerprint people. Then again, so can any bit of information about you or your phone. How do you feel about Xprivacy and fingerprinting in general? Should it help to prevent that, or is it a lost cause? From the ability to spoof user agents, I figured it was a concern and worth the trouble.\n. Right, those are all good arguments.\nI'd love to see a fork of Android designed more around privacy, if such a thing is at all possible with Android. I hate to admit that I couldn't do without Android applications, though...\n. Wow, you did it!! Amazingly fast.\nP.S. Can we have a setting to change UTC to the pre-1800 time zone used in Tietjerksteradeel? I think it was exactly 27 minuted ahead of Amsterdam Time. Ktxbai.\n. By the way, you can also install Notify Clean, an Xposed module that lets you block specific notifications from appearing. Another solution would be to make the notification an option in Xprivacy, but this is perhaps easier.\n. It sounds as though there were something wrong with your phone or your ROM, to be honest.\n. Ah, good find. I'm looking to migrate to 2.x soon as well.\n. @Magissia I imagine this must be a lot of work or even impossible to implement via Xprivacy. Have you tried something like AppLock? There are many applications like that, which can lock access to specific applications through a password. You could lock access to the Xprivacy application on your limited user that way. Or does it not block the notification upon a new installation correctly?\n. @Magissia  This Xposed module seems to be able to lock applications, have you seen it?\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nitishkasturia.lockdown\n. Ey, Daniel! Nobody ever always agrees with everybody, that's part of the game. That said, I do appreciate the time and effort you yourself have also invested in Xprivacy (although anything pales in comparison to all that Marcel, and to a lesser degree Jpeg, have done...).\n. Yay!\nBy the way, this is off topic, but do you happen to know of a way to block Google services and Play Stores from updating automatically in Android? Is there a service that can be disabled?\n. @M66B  Ah OK, thanks. If you don't know of a way, then there probably isn't any hehe. Too bad, because I really hate when programs on my phone run new code without any intervention. New versions may break things.\n. I wonder why? I much prefer embedded, because online is far, far slower. It often takes several seconds, maybe even 5 or more, to open a page in my browser. It is almost a reason for me not to tap it...\n. Yeah I'm one of those users, woof! \n. Oh, you mean because they accidentally tapped where the button was, I see.\n. What is incremental search? I just use the filter: I type the first letters of the name of the application\u2014or is what what you mean?\n. @M66B Oh! Do you know which methods are unsafe under which circumstances? Is this only unsafe when you're installing a new application, or always?\n. OK noted, I didn't know that either.\n. +1!\nI may use this in the future if it becomes available.\n. @banderos101 I especially like your idea of faking your location to all Google apps except when Google Maps is active (or a few other apps that need location). That would be the perfect way to ensure your privacy even while being able to use Google Maps when needed!\n. @M66B  Hmm I see two possible ways to approach the issue, but neither may be practicable.\n1. Only make this possible when Tasker has superuser rights. After all, if an application has superuser, it can circumvent Xprivacy in other ways anyway, so there is no additional security risk. If people want to use Tasker with Xprivacy, it would be reasonable to require of them that they give Tasker superuser access.\n2. Use a password as a parameter. This is probably difficult to implement. Tasker has to pass on a special password to Xprivacy along with an intent, and only with the right password will Xprivacy do anything with the intent. The user would need to set the same password in both Xprivacy and Tasker.\n. @an0n981 If we let any application tell Xprivacy to randomise your location, then an application could test whether you were using a real/fixed location or a fake/randomised location by looking at what location it sees, then randomising it, then checking whether it's still the same or not. That would break the spoofing. Right?\n. This sounds like a good idea, I would like this. +1\n. Why don't you try Greenify? I agree that a universal permission manager would be the most convenient option (like the one Google is making for stock Android, except more comprehensive and able to block Google's own spyware). However, Marcel has said several times that it is better to accomplish this by using other applications in conjunction with Xprivacy, because it would be too complicated to integrate everything into one control panel like Xprivacy. Greenify works well for me, it blocks applications from starting in the background if needed.\n. +1 for Rom Toolkox (I use it too), although it is not as user friendly. Android Tunder I have heard of but not used yet.\n. You could use the Xposed module Notify Clean to block this specific notification.\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.defim.apk.notifyclean\n. Hmm if you have to swipe away a notification upon every reboot, that is annoying, especially if you reboot a lot (I sometimes have to, because RAM tends to clog up on my old phone). Could be enough reason to disable randomise on boot, if Notify Clean does not work for this notification. Or I could just disable all notifications from Xprivacy, which would not be an ideal solution either. I wish something like an open-sourced Notify Clean could be built into Android so that we could always have full control of our devices...\n. Yes!! These are exactly the scenarios I had in mind. Especially hiding one's location from Google except when Maps is active, so that they can't build a file on your whereabouts 24/7 but you can still use Maps, Google's best application.\nI think something like this was mentioned earlier, and it would not be easy to implement because of security, but this would definitely be my number 1 feature request for Xprivacy!! I would donate extra for this!\n. Aww let my +1 be recorded for posterity!\nI am not an advanced user and I have no idea how SQL and databases work, but I would really, really love to have functionality like this. If it can be done outside of Xprivacy with this flushing thing, that would be great; so do you expect someone to make an application or plugin that can do it? If anyone would be willing to write an app or think of an easy way for non-technical people to implement this, I would be willing to donate (a small amount)! And I'm sure there will be many others who would also donate!\n. @an0n981 Thanks for the tip! I looked at the examples you put in the documentation, and they look interesting. I am not a computer programmer in any way, and I did see various terms that were over my head. I once tried to get Tasker to do something related to SQL; I basically copy-pasted stuff off the Internet hoping that I could modify it and get it to work, but I failed. Maybe I could some day try looking into this when I find the courage to risk messing up my Xprivacy hehe, maybe I could figure it out.\nAs to those infinite possibilities, the scenarios in the OP would really be 90 % of what I think most people would use Tasker for if this were possible. Perhaps someone with the same needs will make an application that can do only those things.\nOr basically a Tasker plugin that would let you allow and deny any permission for any installed app by creating the appropriate SQL command, that would take care of everything, if I understand how this works correctly. As in, you tap the plugin in Tasker as an action; then, inside the plugin, you have an app picker and a permission picker, and deny/allow. Then the plugin converts your picks into the appropriate SQL commands. The pickers could even be very basic textual drop-down lists. Or maybe that is totally not how it could ever work, just thinking out loud.\nEither way, thanks for putting things examples in the documentation, good work!\n. @an0n981 Hi! Did you ever finish your Xprivacy Tasker plug-in, or what did you make in the end? I'm trying to do a similar thing with Tasker and shell commands to the Xprivacy database, but I'd love to know more about what you did.\n(I'm trying to make Tasker modify the Xprivacy database when a certain app is in the foreground, like Google Maps, then modify again when it is no longer in the foreground. I think I have all the building blocks working, but for far the problem I'm running into is that Tasker's detection of which app is in the foreground seems to be unreliable...or it may be Android that is unreliable in registering which app is in the foreground...\nI could use work-arounds, like Tasker shortcuts or timers or repeated checking rather than Tasker's standard app contexts, but those all have disadvantages.)\n. Okay, I have found the cause of the unreliable triggers: Tasker by default only checks for foreground applications ever 1.5 seconds. You can set it to a lower value in Tasker's preferences, which may cause slightly higher battery usage. I tried that, and it really helped.\nAnother, probably even more reliable trigger I found in Tasker is \"UI \u2013 New Window\". This can trigger a task whenever a new window is opened, so it triggers whenever you switch to an application. It seemed to be completely reliable, so far. The disadvantage is that the task is triggered every time you switch to a different window, not only when you switch to certain apps, as with the \"Application\" trigger. As to battery usage and general phone performance, I haven't noticed any significant effect yet with \"UI \u2013 New Window\" on all the time; but that is difficult to measure, and I have a reasonably fast phone (LG G2).\n. It has always surprised me, too, that Xprivacy has to use the actual GPS every time to create a fake location. However, as to the wasted energy from GPS use, I suspect that it is still very little? So it would not be a serious concern for me.\n(When you say \"So it only uses fine location and no coarse.\", don't you mean the other way around, only coarse and no fine?)\n. @M66B I know that it does that, but I always wondered why it was necessary. Is it that we cannot hide the fact that the GPS is off from an application or something?\n. Oh, well, I suspect that the (short) activation of the GPS uses very little energy anyway, right? So it probably doesn't matter.\n. @M66B  Yes, of course, but I meant between having Xprivacy use the actual GPS to seed data on the one hand, and just using a random seed without activating the GPS on the other. I think the extra energy consumed by using the actual GPS will not be significant in real-life use, because it is only on for a very short time. Right?\n. I think what Hackeronte wants is to be able to allow an application to access calendar entries from one account, but not from another account. Presumably, simply restricting one account does not do this (I have never tried this myself).\nBut wouldn't it be a better idea to use multiple profiles in Android for proper separation of business and private stuff?\n. You could do it by making your template empty except for the function you want to change, then apply the template to several applications at once, right? Or is there no option in the template \"leave this restriction as it is\" (not sure)?\n. +1\nOther examples: \"Keyboard\", \"Navigation\", \"Browser\", \"Game\"...\nApplications with a similar function I often grant a similar set of permissions as a start.\n. Cool! That was quick. Thank you, Marcel!\n. Hmm so what does that mean? We have to block our location for all Play Services at once if we don't want the location service to get it? Or...\n. Hmm OK. That is unfortunate, but then again, if Google knows our location through one way, it knows it anyway, so perhaps it doesn't matter if we have to let it see our location through all its other services too. So perhaps it makes little difference.\n. I think I agree with Marcel here.\nRubo, what happens when you are \"locked out\"? What does that mean?\n. Ahh yes, I see what you mean now. I could have sworn you could start an application from Settings>Apps, but no. You can still flash the file to disable Xposed from Recovery, though.\n. Wow, that's quick! Xprivacy is getting perfecter and perfecter every day still, I know of few programmes that are developed so actively and so well.\n. I do not believe changing your MAC address could possibly be a crime!! No criminal law in a normal country would have this.\nPry-Fi can spoof your external MAC address, but it is under development and it doesn't always work well on all phones. You can find it on XDA developers.\n. +1\n. Wow! That looks like a lot of work, and you did it so fast! Thanks.\n. Okay, so if I understand this issue correctly, Facebook is getting location data from Play Services in some way that we cannot detect and hence cannot block, which means that we can only prevent Facebook from knowing our location by blocking location for Play Services?\nThe OP said:\n\nJust checked other apps. All of them could get correct location data while restricted. (uninstall, reinstall executed, so it was not cache problem )\"\n\nSo \"all\" of his other applications can also access his location by using some unknown connection with Play Services? Or is the OP mistaken and does this only happen with evil apps like Facebook?\n. Hmm Google is being annoying! The only thing that could sort of mitigate the effects of this is if we block access to location for Play Services except when Google Maps is active (or other apps that legitimately need location access) and hibernate the Facebook app while those map apps are active.\n. The Pro version of Xprivacy already has a whitelist for contacts! I'm not sure whether it works on demand, but that seems less urgent anyway.\n. Perhaps the restrictions from the web are no longer up to date for those applications. What happens when you go to e.g. Greenify and Greenify Donation Package within Xprivacy and check out their Usage Data? For me, the Greenify Donation Package uses no permissions at all, but Greenify uses a few permissions. Make sure all of those are unrestricted. You can also just unrestrict all permissions for both applications: you have presumably granted then root access anyway, so they can do anything they desire to your phone...\n. Are you sure you have lifted all restrictions on both Greenify and its Donation Package? What do you see when you look at their usage statistics in Xprivacy?\nFor me, both Greenify's Donation Package and Titanium Pro work fine. So it must be something about your system. Could it be related to your SELinux-Status? I do not have SELinux at all, I have no idea, but maybe that impacts Xprivacy in some way. Can you test it with SELinux disabled, or do you consider that unsafe?\n. I think you can do exactly this this with the paid version?\nI'm still using an older version of Xprivacy (too lazy to update everything) so I can't test it myself.\n. Hmmm you may be right, then, and it is only possible for external storage. It would be cool to have this for internal too.\n. You can go into the Xposed Installer and disable the module Xprivacy there? It does require a reboot.\n. So you are talking about ticking at first, but then you mention uninstalling.\n- Does the problem occur when Xprivacy is installed but disabled in Xposed? \n- Does the problem occur when you have Xprivacy activated but reset all permissions to default / allowed all permissions for all applications?\n. Congratulations!\n. I think he wants applications to think the GSF is available while in fact access to the GSF has been restricted by Xprivacy. If you tell Xprivacy to give the application permission to access the GSF, you will leak data; if you block access to the GSF, the application will presumably crash or fail to work. So it would be nice if we could spoof that. But perhaps it is too complicated to implement or even impossible.\n. I understand. And no doubt he will, too.\n. As a work-around, you could create a Tasker profile with the condition \"Event \u2192 On boot\". Then you could have Xprivacy provide a fake value to Tasker, so that Tasker might check whether Xprivacy is active based on that value. If you set ICC ID to \"999\" for Tasker in Xprivacy and restrict \"Phone \u2192 GetSIMSerialNumber\", then Tasker will get \"999\" if it checks for the variable %SIMNUM. So you could add \"Variable %SIMNUM = 999\" as a second condition for the Tasker profile above. Only if both conditions are matched (boot & variable=999) shall Tasker enable the radios.\nBy the way, it would be great if, in the future, there were a way for Xprivacy to communicate with Tasker directly. But I seem to remember this turned out to be too much work to implement. (Someone else said we could have Tasker manipulate the Xprivacy database directly to get some stuff done, which seemed rather intimidating to me...)\n. Heh thanks, but it's still kind of not the way things were intended to work. Oh, well, I guess Xprivacy and Tasker are not the way Google wants Android to work anyway!\n. Hmm what alarm, and what service? The Xprivacy service?\n. Ah, I didn't know that. I just picked a random value to be honest, but %DEVTID sounds better, then.\n. This would be my #1 feature requestion, it is perhaps the most important thing that is still missing from Xprivacy. It would greatly enhance my privacy to block location for all Google applications in the background. I am very glad to hear that Marcel is perhaps even considering this.\nWhat Magissia says it is true, and we shouldn't get a false sense of security from this. However, in many cases the choice is not between \"allow on demand\" or \"allow when running\": in that situation, \"allow when in the foreground\" is indeed slightly less safe; but in many cases the real choice is between \"allow always\" and \"allow when in the foreground\", because we find \"on demand\" too cumbersome for things you need to do often, such as location in Google Maps. Then we gain a lot of privacy, when we switch from \"allow always\" to \"allow when in the foreground\". As Kaizokan says, it is up to the user not to use this function if she doesn't trust it, like Magissia. It would be Apple-like to forbid other people from using it because it might be \"confusing\"!\nThe risk of self-activating applications with a transparent overlay can be mitigated in other ways. For one thing, we can use the existing function in Xprivacy to restrict overlays for an application. Secondly, we can use Greenify to ensure that applications cannot become active when we have not opened them.\nLastly, this might be a lot of work to implement, and perhaps a Tasker plugin would be more effective anyway. My main reason for saying this is that I would want to allow location etc. for Google services while some other application is active, like my train application: the Google location services, which use Wifi and Google's database to determine your location when GPS is not available, are highly useful for all other applications that use your location. It would be more complicated to implement this through Xprivacy. Unless perhaps there would be a special built-in thingy for Google's location services, just as there already is a special function for Google location that you can restrict under the category Location.\n. So it is using both the Play Services and another way? I wonder what that way could be: do they have their own database of cell towers? \n. Ahh OK, I get it. \n. @J316 Marcel said: \"On demand timeout is always allow/deny once.\"\nYou seem to be saying this this is not true, that on-demand time-out may apply an allow or deny permanently. Are you positively sure?\n. Marcel says the restriction will not be permanent if the pop-up times out, regardless of the check mark. So a time-out is different from pressing Deny or Allow, it is an exception. Are you saying that is not true? I haven't really tested it myself.\n. I don't understand. Are you saying what I said was not true, or are you saying something else?\n. You still haven't told me whether you think my paraphrase of Marcel is not correct (which means there is a bug) or not. So I don't know what to test.\n. Still no yes or no...\n. I give up, but I wish you good luck.\n. It would still be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to get your location from this in practice. They would have to map all possible routes around the city, which soon becomes an almost-infinite number. If you have applications running on your phone that use the battery, it all falls apart. Then there are different phones, different ROMs, OS updates, different settings, etc. And, if you don't move at a continuous speed but have to drive slowly or stop to examine a gable, the whole pattern falls apart too.\nWhile it would be nice to still be able to block this potential method, I can completely understand why this has a low priority for Marcel. And giving him orders(!) is in my opinion inappropriate. Why don't we start by thanking him for the tremendous effort he has put into the great application that Xprivacy is now! I remember the dark days of LBE...\n. Hmm is there perhaps a way to change the Advertising ID itself, since this can be done by hand as well? There is no real use for it anyway, so I'm sure all users would be fine with Xprivacy's changing the ID every time a new application starts, or something like that.\n. Not a random application, but Xprivacy? We can now reset it through some menu in the Google application. If Xprivacy were to change/reset the ID on a regular basis, that would protect users from being tracked that way fairly well?\n. Oh, in that way, I see. Too bad there isn't an intent to do that or something. \n. You could do the following as a work-around, which will, I think, not require a lot more work than if this feature were implemented in Xprivacy. You probably need one of the paid versions of Xprivacy (I always forget which one), in order to be able to pick contacts to allow.\nYou copy all the contacts that you want Whatsapp to access. You could prefix them with \"A_\" to have them appear all together at the top of your contact picker in Xprivacy.\nFrom those contacts, you remove all information except the phone numbers.\nIn Xprivacy, you restrict \"Contacts\" for Whatsapp, but you pick allowed contacts (Menu \u2192 Select Contacts to allow). You pick only the \"A_\" ones. Done!\nNote that Whatsapp stores lots of information on its servers, so it is possible that they already have your contacts on their servers, and they may be restored automatically if you do this, so it will be hard to check whether it works properly. In other words, if a contact is still visible to Whatsapp even though it's supposed to be restricted, that may be because it came from the server. Perhaps it is possible to delete your account at Whatsapp and start a new one, with the same phone number.\n. @Eun  That is true, Xprivacy has no group management for contacts. Perhaps someone could build a group feature for Xprivacy, but then somehow Xprivacy would have to be notified when a new contact presents himself through Whatsapp...it sounds like a huge project.\nOne possibility, though, would perhaps be to have an option in Xprivacy to \"automatically allow new contacts\" for an application. That way, you would have to change things by hand in Xprivacy if you wanted to add, say, an address to a contact that you wanted to block for Whatsapp, but any new (automatic) contacts through Whatsapp would be allowed automatically. Not sure whether this would be feasible, though.\nIn the end, it would be best if Xprivacy could send us a pop-whenever a new contact was created, to ask whether we wanted application x to have access to it (and another pop-up for application y, when that application starts), but that is probably hugely complicated.\n. I understand. And a pop up from Xprivacy \"allow this contact for the following applications: [list of apps with tick marks]\" whenever a new contact is created sounds complicated to implement, right?\n. However, GPS does turn on when an application is to receive fake GPS data, if I'm not mistaken? Allowing us to feed an application fake data without using the actual GPS would conceivably save some energy. For some applications, it may be useful to use the GPS to generate a fake location that appears natural, but for most it adds no benefit, right?\n. Hi Marcel, thank you for that explanation, very enlightening. It is incredible and amazing how you have made the world's best privacy application on your own! There was one thing I didn't understand: \n\nThere is also the problem that certain restrictions can lead to problems with developers with deep pockets, like game developers.\n\nWhat is that about?\n. Okay, so it is about cheating. How could one cheat by faking one's device?\n. Hmm what has Samsung done this time? Are they trying to sneak around Android permissions or...?\n. I looked at the commit, but it seemed to be about the installation of Xposed?\n. I couldn't agree more. Although luckily custom ROMs are usually available for the most popular phones. Wasn't there some Google project or initiative where manufacturers are only allowed to theme Android, not change the OS? I forgot the name, and I can't find it now.\n. @Gitoffthelawn That is not such a bad idea! I often forget that I had unchecked some permissions when I re\u00ebnable a category. It does require an extra tap, though, so perhaps this should be options (an option in settings). Or perhaps it would be too much work to be a high priority in development of the application, I don't know.\n. I know how this aspect of Xprivacy works, but I just keep forgetting it; I forget to check the individual permissions after tuning a category restriction back on.\nWhat is this talk of Xprivacy's not being useful any more? I, too, have experimented a lot, but if you just restore a back-up of your permissions, what's the problem?\n. Ah okay, yes, I have done the same thing. But who hasn't? Even users who never experiment will have used a smartphone before installing Xprivacy, so everyone's data have passed through... as you say, it is still very useful. I have made a fresh start on my new phone and been fairly consistent. The only applications that I should have restricted more is Google Play Services. (Recently, I have restricted libraries for them on demand, but the phone sometimes reboots when they are disallowed.)\n. @Efreak Sounds like a very good idea! This bothers me too.\n. Hmm this could be intended behaviour. After all, it might make sense to have an app access all Internet addresses except a certain specific site. On the other hand, that use-case scenario is probably rare; I guess it is better to have blacklists deactivate (temporarily) while the restriction is allowed, as the OP suggests.\n. @kaizokan I agree with your reasoning. And I also use it that way, either restrict and whitelist with on-demand, or restrict and whitelist without on-demand, or allow. I only use blacklist for restrictions that I also use whitelist for, so I would never use blacklist without a whitelist, so using a blacklist while allowing a restriction is never something I use.\nFor blacklisting specific domains, I would want to blacklist that domain throughout Android, so I would use Adaway or something (which happens to be built into my ROM/kernel, so I can't change the lists at the moment).\n. @an0n981 That is a realistic scenario. In that situation, the current system (blacklist blocks things even when its permission is allowed).\nBut there is also another scenario where blacklisting is useful. Suppose I were using Chrome with libraries restricted on demand. When I first started Chrome, it needed to load some library to function at all, so I whitelisted that library. Then browsing worked without further prompts. Then later I went to a certain strange web page and Chrome suddenly asked to load some library. It seemed potentially unwanted, so I blacklisted that library for Chrome. The nest time a page wants Chrome to load that library, it is automatically forbidden, so it won't bother my any more. If, in the future, Chrome wants to do something else that requires a new library and that I actually want to do, then I will be prompted and I can whitelist that new library. So it makes sense to work with on-demand and blacklists together. I actually never use blacklisting unless combined with on-demand.\nIn short, to accommodate both my scenario and that of Anon above, perhaps every should stay the way it is, after all. Maybe with an extra warning somewhere, because I can see how this could confuse people.\n. @Gitoffthelawn  Good point. So as you imagine it, only the main check box for the app, the one at the top above all categories, toggles between those three states? That actually sounds like a nice idea.\n- One thing to consider is that users will probably  not understand what the square means. \n- A question: when the box is set to \"restricted\" or \"unrestricted except by blacklist\", will the whitelist still be active in both cases? (I presume yes.)\n- Another question: is the blacklist erased when you toggle between the options? (I presume no.)\n- A remark: isn't it true that whitelist and blacklist are processed as one big set of rules? If so, maybe it would be difficult to split them into two separate \"actions\" for the deeper processing? If so, then maybe the three states of the box should be:\n   everything allowed, no white/blacklists applied (this would be new)\n   everything allowed, except that white/blacklists are applied (currently indicated by a square)\n   nothing allowed, except that white/blacklists are applied (we definitely want keep this option)\nThis still sounds like quite a bit of work; for me, it wouldn't be of a high priority.\n. @Gitoffthelawn OK that sounds good, if it is simple to implement.\n. I have used the Xposed module Enhanced Toast to determine that the toast message saying \"Xprivacy has blocked the clipboard\" came from System, not the app Xprivacy. Of course it may be that Xprivacy instructs the system to give this message.\nAt any rate, with the free version of Enhanced Toast, you can block any specific toast message. So, as a work-around, it is perfect and does all that I need in practice.\nI, too, was annoyed with the Xprivacy clipboard message blocking the keyboard every time I opened Telegram. First I moved the toast message to the centre of the screen, instead of near the bottom, with the xposed module Xblast (Visual Tweaks \u2192 Toast Notification). That mostly solved the problem already.\nSo, while I agree that there should be an option in Xprivacy, if indeed the toast originates with Xprivacy, in practice that may be a lot of work and unnecessary, because there is a free app that can deal with the issue. As to long-clicking, many users may never find out that that is possible.\n. @Gitoffthelawn  I understand your reasoning (although I've always happily run various Xposed modules alongside each other). If it isn't too much work, I support the idea of a new option in the per-app settings menu where you can toggle Xprivacy toasts on or off per app (I think per function is not as necessary: most of us would be fine with turning all toasts for a certain app on or off, and you'd have to create a far more complex menu if you wanted it for each function). Perhaps the code could be copied from Enchanced Toast, if its code is free.\n. @Gitoffthelawn  OK noted. I hope this will be implemented some day, but for now I'm good. By the way, do you know why I only get toast messages for the clipboard? Because that is the one function that may confuse users the most? I remember being confused by this myself, when there were no toasts yet, in the past.\n. The part where you control future pop-ups and set a time interval is already possible. You may need to enable an expert option somewhere.\n. I'm thinking you might not have seen the pop-up messages for \"on demand\" permissions at all yet? See here, question 34: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/README.md#frequently-asked-questions-faq\nCustom data you can only enter in the Settings menu in the Xprivacy app. Open Xprivacy, tap on an application to edit its permissions, then pick Settings in the menu. There you can set a custom SSID or location, etc., for that specific app only.\nWhen you're in the general menu in Xprivacy, you can enter custom default settings (\"global\") for all apps, by going to Settings in the menu; those \"global\" settings are used when an app doesn't have any custom settings for itself.\n. Can apps also overwrite files, even when they can't read them? Doesn't result in many unforeseen potential data leakages? If they can e.g. overwrite the URL whitelist of Xprivacy or of some other app...\nI can't really think of a scenario where an app should be allowed to write to a file but not read it. Wouldn't it make more sense to always conjoin the two abilities? That is actually how I thought it worked...\n. Reading files is the most obvious and common way to expose sensitive data. But suppose you had a firewall app installed that was using a whitelist, and I, the evil app, overwrite your whitelist with something of my choosing. Then I can cause any app I choose to bypass the firewall unnoticed. So e.g. apps that contain ads with tracking cookies/pixels/scripts could use this method to delete the whitelists from common firewall applications and leak all sorts of data.\nIn other words, allowing apps to write to files when this isn't necessary, and when it isn't expected by users that they are allowed to do so, creates a whole extra, unnecessary attack vector that can be used to sabotage other apps in order to leak data. I'm sure there are other, unknown ways in which you could use the overwriting of files to cause data leaks, ways I haven't thought of yet...\nAdmittedly, this will be much less common than leaks resulting from the reading of files, but still. As to confusion, you could make it an expert function, or give users a pop-up when they restrict the permission. Of course, if you think it's too complicated, I understand you might not want to implement this. \n. Oh! That is good, I guess, and it makes sense. My apologies.\nHmm I tried to Google which files normal apps can read/write, but I couldn't find it. I presume normal apps can't see any files in system folders. But an app can presumably see some other files outside the app's own folder? \n. Hmm if new contacts aren't automatically blacklisted, that seems like an important issue. I support this suggestion.\n. Wow, that is a quick answer! Thanks, I am glad editing the export is possible: I will do that, then, for now.\nDo you think editing the whitelist entries directly is possible as a future feature, or is it too complicated / low priority?\n. @stud007 In Xprivacy, click on an app so that you see the app's permissions. Then click on the menu button (three dots in the upper-right corner). Pick \"select applications to allow\". This only works if you have access to running/installed applications restricted for that app.\n. VPNs work for me with Xprivacy installed.\nHave you checked the Xprivacy usage log for the VPN app?\nHave you disabled all restrictions for the VPN app? Does it work then?\nAre you sure it isn't another Xposed module? I remember all VPN apps refused to work for me when Onehand Mode was enabled. I think I had to whitelist some stuff in Onehand Mode in order to get VPN apps to work, because Onehand Mode would disable the pop-up screen for VPN access.\n. @Unpublished Wow, it's great that you're fixing things! Although I am currently unable to test it myself.. Wow, it's great that you're working on Xprivacy! I don't know if this is appropriate, but would it be an idea to explain here what kinds of things you changed besides this notification-update function?. If it fixes problems on older versions of Android, why not merge it? Many people are still on Android 4.4. I wonder what the biggest problems are on Android 7 or 8, though, but I'll try to look that up myself.. ",
    "cobaltdr": "Reasonable tradeoff.\n. Have a notification maybe, with something like 'Do you want app X to access property Y?' and buttons in the notification for yes or no?\n. 'Settings' is expanding, but could have something for #21 and #27 or other global settings.\n. Did you install the patch? I had a similar issue until I installed it.\n. Appreciated, but that was just the easiest example I could think of. Another one could be heading of actions, with subheadings calls, messages, open links. Default behaviour allows you to set all three quickly, but you'd also optionally be able to set each.\n. I look forward to this.\n. When you say speed, does that mean speed of the Xprivacy user interface, or speed of the Xprivacy framework/module which does the checking and denial of permissions?\nCorrect me if I'm mistaken,\n1. Would be an acceptable trade off if not major hit in speed, but I understand the risk of introducing bugs. Still, you have to admit, it would offer some interesting ability to fine tune things. I wonder if there's a way to get other people's opinion on this. Won't be worth implementing if no one else wants it.\n1. Should really not be a problem, as the backed already limits those permissions individually and you're only introducing the ability to toggle them more finely.\nSplitting headings. I think that's mostly okay now. Media is a little ambiguous, so maybe that deserves splitting. Camera versus voice recording, versus accessing photos/videos/sound files. Also, does this also mean that it restricts those file types, or the system folders where they're stored, or is is that done by denying the methods the apps access it?\nI'm not sure about 'System'. If it's just installed apps, then no splitting.\nMaybe add a section to the documentation to explain what heading blocks what, and a brief description of how it does that?\n. Browser on silly iPad crashed when I made that last post, there was a number 2 in there somewhere, but the thing truncated it rather oddly, and I can't remember what I wrote. :S Bit of a shame about the performance hit, it would be a nice feature. Don't really want a slower phone, at least without the option of opting out if you implement this.\nEdit - as a matter of fact GitHub is truncating the post... Weird.\n. Clicking on the checkboxes in the app list under categories eg. contacts will stay checked irrespective of whether the permission is set or not inside the apps menu. Latter reflects settings correctly. App list defaults back to unchecked. 0.19.\n. Apologies, checked again and it is working as expected. \n. \n. Stock Samsung Galaxy S3 4.1.2 keyboard based on SwiftKey, for numerical input. Settings and symbols are both grayed out.\n. Nothing at all, they're grayed out. At the moment, the only two other keyboards I have are null keyboard and Google voice typing, but I can switch to them from the persistent notification.\n. That would be good, thanks. The voice typing I think is speech to text, and the other one is literally a null keyboard. If the fix does not work, I'll try another keyboard.\n. Resolved in 0.23. I now have a key with .- to the right of 9. A tap gives me a decimal, a double tap a negative sign. I hesitate to close this, as I don't know whether other people are affected and how they fared.\n. Make optional, in case of performance hits?\n. Maybe obfuscate part of the IMEI number?\n. Admittedly, this is an advanced feature...\n. 2&3: I beg to differ, nowhere else in the use of checkboxes have I seen the behaviour you describe. It is anomalous and misleading.\n. Thought I read this somewhere, but could not find it again when I was creating #85. Apologies.\n. You might, if you had a whitelist within Xprivacy. And instead of feeding an empty list to the app, feed the whitelist to the app instead? Might involve creating a parallel contacts list which probably would be beyond the scope of Xprivacy.\n. Make part of granular settings?\n. Exit kills the process, sign in ends with the same screen. \n. Stock rooted Galaxy S3 4.1.2 GT-I9300 baseband i9300xxemc2.\nLogcat is gonna be a problem... I left it on for the 15s that I needed to reproduce the issue. It's 1.8Mb. I need to figure out what's spamming my logs. And maybe get you some relevant information. Won't likely be able to do that before I get back, I'll keep looking and update. In the meantime, I wonder if anyone else can logcat this.\n.

I wonder why you could not reproduce it.\n. What changed between 0.29.1 and 0.29.2?\n. I can confirm. Problem recurs with 0.29.2. However, as stated above, 0.29.1 works fine.\n. If anything, make it optional. And the ability to customise sound and vibration pattern. I personally don't require this functionality, but I can see where it would be useful.\n. Whilst this is normal Android behaviour, there is a case for an exception here, as clicking inadvertently a line toggling a checkbox can have potentially disastrous consequences. I personally get around it by scrolling on the app icons.\n. You'd want access for this in the app itself, save you the hassle of having to get out of the app. Or at the very least, supply slightly more descriptive terms.\n. Allowing loadLibrary under shell prevents force close. Shouldn't a force close not be happening because of how xprivacy works?\n. Same thing happens with Facebook's Pages manager.\n. What guarantee do you have that when you re-enable those permissions when you want the app to have access to them (auto enable all?) that it's not going to go beyond what you want it to access? FB for example wants access to your accounts, contacts, call logs etc.\n. Something to do with the way Xprivacy displays the notification maybe, I've noticed it will list the current application it is backing data for.\n. Well, rather than, say, deny it outright, to prevent it from drawing onto apps other than itself, as this could be a quite serious problem for privacy, still.\n. QR Droid is a case in point. Prevented all access, but the app happily accesses the camera.\n. You could swipe it away, but didn't have the option to clear as with a normal notification. \n. Coloured, but flat still. Does not have to be monochrome.\n. I think the Holo HIG asks you to use flat icons, I don't know if it restricts colours. A colour for the triangle will make it stand out as it should.\n.

How do you go about finding the free memory as opposed to the available memory? I've been using the system's RAM tab after a long press of the home button. \n. I forgot to mention the XML file is 224KB.\n. That's weird. The out of memory error occurs after the app list is loaded, only when I try to import. When I close my notification tab after the error has occurred, I find XPrivacy updating the app list again. I never have any problem with the app list refreshing, but I've never been able to import a whole XML file without running out of memory. The notification in the notification tab which normally lists the app that is being read from the XML file changes to say out of memory error.\n. Can I zip and pm you the complete log file?\n. I just realised XDA won't let me attach files. What is your email address again?\n. I wonder if some of the apps I have have got leaks. I thought the Linux kernel took care of the memory management issue along with the Java VM. Do you have any recommendations regarding an app that would allow me to find out what's hogging my memory? I used to use top on Linux, but the busybox version on Android is not this intuitive. \n. Wow. Thanks!\n. Now Xprivacy GUI just closes in the background, while the 'ongoing notification' is frozen on one app. The only way to get rid of it is to kill the process. I am not able to give you a logcat just now as I am about to head off to work. Earlier versions of Xprivacy used to exhibit the same behaviour, around version 0.4x, I think - when you introduced 'all'.\nSecond and subsequent attempts gives me the out of memory error like previous crashes. I really need to find the equivalent of top for Android. The console busybox version is not very useful.\n. My comments were actually for 1.7.16. I'm trying 1.7.15 now. What app can I use to check memory use by apps? First import on 1.7.15 completely froze my phone part of the way through the procedure.\n. Uh oh. No.\nNever had this happen with Xprivacy before.\nImport causes reboot then bootloops, had to flash remover.\n. I had 1.7.17 before that happened. 1.7.17 only gives out of memory. 1.7.18 bootloops. Had to flash remover. Reinstalling 1.7.17 still bootlooped. Had to flash remover again. 1.7.16 now allows phone to boot.\n. That will require adb, I have no setup where I can run adb unfortunately. Reinstalling 1.7.17 after the bootloops have stopped now re allows the phone to boot with 1.7.17. I will see if I can get a logcat of 1.7.18 causing the initial crash.\n. After 1.7.18 bootloops, flashing the remover recovers the system. However, every subsequent install of Xprivacy of any version down to 1.7.15 carries on causing the bootloop, until after installation of the apk you attempt to run Xprivacy. It complains that it is not enabled in Xposed, and when you close that dialog, it is refreshing its app list. Usage data and settings appear preserved. Rebooting after that gives a working phone and Xprivacy.\nI am not on my laptop at the moment, so I cannot give you a logcat, but I will mail you them as soon as I get a chance. 1.7.18 is a no-no for me. Had never had any bootloops before.\n. Haha. I'm almost scared to upgrade now. I really appreciate the effort you're putting into this app, and hope more people realise this and contribute.\n. 1.7.19 causes a crash and reboot when importing, but no bootloop. Phone appears to take a bit longer to boot. However, 1.7.19 is really, really slick. Nice interface. Usage data is very well integrated. I will try to get a catalog of this when I get a chance. By tomorrow hopefully. Oh and the app list loads faster, did you do something to that?\n. 1.7.20 just fails, notification freezes. Most of the apps I have taking up memory are system apps.\n. 1.7.22 still has the out of memory issue, but only after trying to export. Doesn't the dalvik vm deal with memory management? Before import I have at least 100MB free.\n. Galaxy S3 GT-I9300 with 1GB RAM. \ndalvik.vm.heapstartsize=8m\ndalvik.vm.heapgrowthlimit=64m\ndalvik.vm.heapsize=128m\n. Set it to heapsize to 128m to decrease the frequency at which the Touchwiz UI was being killed off by the system.\nHave adopted your values, but still crashes. I wonder why I'm the only one getting this.\n. @M66B: thanks, I appreciate what you say. I'm not entirely sure how to modify my setup. I only have about 5-6 processes taking up memory other than stock Samsung bloat. Hehe. Killing stuff to free memory doesn't appear to help. I might try to split the XML file to see if that does anything.\n. @M66B yeah, I've thought of that. I've been putting it off. It's a real shame Samsung have bloat. With their backing they could have produced more efficient solutions.\n. Dammit. 1.7.23 bootloops again when importing. I will try to get logcats to post, but I need some sleep, been working all night.\n. Took about 5 minutes, but 1.7.27 is the first version that has allowed me to import settings without problems.\n. People need to be aware that Xprivacy is exporting account and contact details to a text file. Is the data encrypted? They might otherwise inadvertently be distributing private data themselves.\n. I assume you have stock recovery and could not flash the remover .zip? I specifically installed A custom recovery for situations like that after reading about some people's experiences.\n. It's all good as long as this is all consistent. I'll go with performance anytime. \n. ",

    "famewolf": "Another example is I might want to give an app access to phone number and calls but not phone id....the idea of fine tuning the blocks has potential.\n. Also consider allowing the user to specify both where to import and export the file.  This would allow them to specify their own subdir which for example might be one that auto sync's with dropbox or other fileshare hosts.\n. When user is choosing where to save the file please allow them to choose what to name the file as well...this will allow multiple backups and also saving a file for each device since some devices may have apps specific to them even if the user has multiple devices.\n. What about these answers?\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/15785506/android-file-choose-dialog-again <-- enhanced version of next one\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/3592717/choose-file-dialog#  <- lists several such as:\nhttp://code.google.com/p/android-file-dialog/\nAndroid Library:  https://github.com/vaal12/AndroidFileBrowser\nTest Application: https://github.com/vaal12/FileBrowserTestApplication\n. The main one I presented just overrides the onCreateDialog to handle the filepath and options to cancel etc   If you don't like their solutions you could always code your own using that.  \nIn any case you could still move the pro key AND the backups into a .XPrivacy subfolder which is what the original request was instead of cancelling the whole thing.\n. Just clarifying under linux filename rules (I'm not sure if android follows them) directories beginning with a period are hidden by default when browsing from a file manager....so if you want it visable just lose the . and use /sdcard/XPrivacy/\n. Is that the code for oi file manager?  It has a freely available api but then xprivacy would have to require oi file manager be installed....not a good idea.   I can tell you several factory rom's I had did not have any kind of file manager....because they don't want you sideloading apps.\n. If I have an app that is working incorrectly and want to figure out if I've blocked something I should not have, I would need to be able to look at both what calls were made and when they were last called (timestamp) so I could see for example that the \"share\" menu in an app is empty because I blocked the system call. \n. I think that would be a usable solution.\n. This reflects the issue I mentioned in the xda thread regarding the system calls not being named in a self explanatory manner and if for example I want to allow camera access to a pic to pdf app but block audio and video I still don't know which calls to deny without googling each call.\n. Is a checkbox the only icon that can be placed there?  It would seem to me if you have some of the submenu's checked but not the main one then a different symbol could be displayed...an X...or perhaps the text of the main takes on a different color when some of the submenu's are checked to alert you to expand the view.\n. Along with this, as per our conversation, would be ensuring an app only has access to the accounts it needs vs all accounts.   Apps that use gmail login would not be able to see facebook and vice versa.\n. Previously if a user had a problem with an app...if they had blocked something they should not have they could uninstall the app and reinstall it to just lose the settings for that app...as opposed to clearing data and losing ALL app info.  If the information is going to be retained (which I think is a nice feature) then there needs to be a way for the user to \"uncheck\" all rules including restricted for an app...basically a start over button for that app.   Are you planning to do this with system apps?\n. On close examination it does appear to be a duplicate and his article also mentioned tracking via the microphone (which luckily xprivacy can already restrict) however I think \"REQ: Randomize accelerometer data to prevent tracking fingerprint.\" is alot clearer than \"restricting the SensorManager\".\n.

Some notes:\n- param.getResult() != null doesn't make sense on a before hook, as the result hasn't been set yet\n- for the addOnAccountsUpdatedListener semantics to be preserved, the listener should be triggered with an empty list of accounts if updateImmediately is true\n- also, removeOnAccountsUpdatedListener should be made to work properly - silently remove the previous hook if it was registered, failing with IllegalStateException if it was not, etc.\n- in the future, it might be needed to keep the listener around and filter the results that are passed to it when accounts are actually changed, for instance if the feature to filter account types for a certain app is implemented. This would allow e.g. Skype to be notified when an account of type Skype is configured (which might even be a requirement for its setup wizard to work properly)\nAs for moving everything else to \"before\" instead of \"after\", theoretically that would be good. For synchronous calls (excluding the listener scenarios) that are to be blocked/faked, I'm not sure if calling the original method and spoofing the results afterwards is safer (semantics-wise) than faking the values upfront and not even bother calling the original method.\nThere were issues reported about triggering the GPS sensor even when faking the location - that would be one situation where immediately returning on the before hook would prevent the original code to run, but side effects need to be evaluated.\n. When linking to changed code, I would suggest using an URL bound to a specific commit instead of the master, as the link would be pointing to the wrong place in the future.\nSomething like: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/8504ad05b5ac0cf100760aabb973904c0b89aa8e/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XActivityThread.java#L121\n. That's the way fastscroll works.\nWhen you scroll more than a certain threshold, it will start displaying the fastscroll bar which you can then use to grab the thumb and quickly go through the list. You see it in action here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcPIvGRwrxA (altough with an older look)\nThe catch is that when the thumb is visible, clicking anywhere on the bar will instantly scroll you there. You need to wait about 1 second for it to fade away and then you can interact with the list freely, including the checkbox.\nIf it wasn't for this delay, you wouldn't be able to grab the thumb to do the fastscroll.\nIMO it's working as intended.\n. I wonder if given the different tastes, would it make sense to have this as a configurable option like some other items:\n- show selected items on top\n- display internet icon or not\n- auto-restrict new apps or not, and reapply full restrictions on update or not (to stay on the safe side)\n  etc.\n. I completely agree with Marcel.\nThe fact that there's a permission involved in something, doesn't mean it's related with privacy. It's exactly the same as with WAKE_LOCK or DEVICE_POWER; you could argue that it would be convenient to have XPrivacy handle those as well, but the truth is that it has nothing to do with privacy.\n. http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=43655000&postcount=2101 :)\n.

There is the possibility to simply flash a zip file which disables Xposed. This file is written to the SD card automatically when a user installs Xposed and it is also available from http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1574401.\nI think finding good (and reliable!) heuristics to detect wrong system behavior is hard. On the one hand, there are many different situations which can prevent you from reverting to safe settings (not only for XPrivacy, but also for other modules). On the other hand, you don't want the kill-switch to trigger just because you rebooted too fast.\nThere are plans and even some code to create the file /data/data/de.robv.android.xposed.installer/conf/disabled on certain key presses or touches. This disables most of Xposed (including all modules), so unless something is really messed up (but that will usually detected before the installation), you should get back into the system and can then correct your settings. This isn't finished yet, but again, you can simply flash the zip to disable Xposed completely.\n. Note that it doesn't really matter where the file is coming from as it isn't included in the final APK. It's just referenced, i.e. made available in the CLASSPATH of the compiler to compile the module's classes against.\n. ",

Thanks for the comment.\nSure it will use screen space if the icons will not be properly resized (some tries should be done with variable sizes) and if always enabled.\nI forgot to mention that this could be an option that a user can enable/disable.\nThis is just in order to \"debug\" the applied rules or to have a quick check for a new installation. It will be disabled by the user when not useful to refine the rules, in a \"stable\" environment for example.\nJust to say, even the uid and event log could be enabled/disabled from the view (in Usage Page settings) so the user can choose the level of details to be seen for every usage line. But this could be useful only if it gives some screen space.\nIt could also be an option for the donate version of the app.\nThank you very much.\n. Sure, the resize of the icon is the main point for the feasibility of the proposed change.\nThis is why I would also propose to make it enabled/disabled by the user.\nWith the icons enabled the user will have less lines on screen and have to do many scrolls, but it will be a choice and only for a limited time if he wants to disable it later.\nI know that I can see the usage based on every application (very useful) but I have found that looking at the Usage Page while jumping to the app details usage and also tring to remember the related uid is not so simple, especially for the first days after the installation when you try the refine the rules.\nAs an example: this morning I woke up and I wanted to check if some changes at the rules I made yesterday were properly working. I spent some minutes scrolling some hours log and cross checking the uid and the related apps.\nIf I could enable the icons the check would be a matter of seconds, I think (just look at the time, the icon and the permit/denied action).\nSorry for the long reply, but it is possible that I am missing some point in using the GUI of the app.\n.

XPrivacy peut restreindre les cat\u00e9gories de donn\u00e9es auxquelles une application veut acc\u00e9der. Pour cela, Il suffit de ne rien transmettre \u00e0 une application ou simplement de remplacer les informations sensibles par d\u2019autres.\nIl existe plusieurs cat\u00e9gories de donn\u00e9es qui peuvent \u00eatre restreintes, comme, \u00ab contacts \u00bb ou \u00ab localisation \u00bb... Par exemple, si vous limitez l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux contacts pour une application, cela se traduira par l\u2019envoi d\u2019une liste de contacts vide. De m\u00eame, en limitant l\u2019acc\u00e8s d\u2019une application \u00e0 votre position cela aura pour effet d\u2019envoyer une fausse position \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re.\nXPrivacy ne r\u00e9voque pas les permissions d\u2019une application, ce qui signifie que la plupart des applications continueront de fonctionner comme auparavant sans fermeture inopin\u00e9e. Il demeure deux exceptions \u00e0 cette r\u00e8gle : l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 Internet et \u00e0 l\u2019unit\u00e9 de stockage externe (carte m\u00e9moire SD) sont restreints par l\u2019interdiction formelle d\u2019y acc\u00e9der. Il est impossible de proc\u00e9der autrement car ces autorisations sont g\u00e9r\u00e9es par Android d\u2019une mani\u00e8re un peu sp\u00e9ciale. Android subordonne la gestion des permissions du r\u00e9seau et syst\u00e8me de fichier \u00e0 Linux. XPrivacy simulera le mode hors-ligne (internet) et/ou une unit\u00e9 de stockage non mont\u00e9e, mais malgr\u00e9 cela quelques applications tenteront d\u2019y acc\u00e9der tout de m\u00eame et cela pourrait se traduire par une fermeture inopin\u00e9e de l\u2019application.\nSi la restriction d'une cat\u00e9gorie de donn\u00e9es pour une application entra\u00eene des probl\u00e8mes pour l'application, il est possible de permettre \u00e0 nouveau l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la cat\u00e9gorie de donn\u00e9es pour r\u00e9soudre le probl\u00e8me.\nPar d\u00e9faut, toutes les applications nouvellement install\u00e9es n'auront aucun acc\u00e8s aux cat\u00e9gories de donn\u00e9es, cela afin d\u2019\u00e9viter qu\u2019une nouvelle application ne laisse \u00e9chapper des donn\u00e9es sensibles. Juste apr\u00e8s l\u2019installation d\u2019une nouvelle application, XPrivacy vous demandera \u00e0 quelles cat\u00e9gories de donn\u00e9es vous souhaitez que l\u2019application puisse acc\u00e9der. \nXPrivacy est pourvu d\u2019un navigateur qui permet de rapidement activer ou d\u00e9sactiver l\u2019acc\u00e8s d\u2019une application \u00e0 certaines cat\u00e9gories de donn\u00e9es, par exemple, pour voir votre agenda.

    "28Black": "Hi, I got the same problem here! (Galaxy S3, StockROM)\nI just installed v0.30, but nothing has changed.\nAfter reboot, apps which will start by default, such as avast!, Green Power Premium etc. need an extremely long time to be loaded! All widgets as well.\nUsually, the entire boot process was completed after 5 to 10 seconds.\nNow it takes more than 2 minutes! :/\nI'll now test your v0.30.1 and then give a feedback!\n. I'm sorry to say this, but the problem persists! :(\n. Of course! One moment please;)\n. I am not familiar with \"logcat\". Can you tell me the detail how I need to use it?\n. The problem still persists! \n. I'm going to make a logcat. I am concerned about my privacy, can I send you the results by e-mail? (Maybe a trash-mail;))\n. I send you a PM through XDA ;)\n. I have a little problem. Not the entire log is displayed in my cmd! How can extract the complete log?\n. It's working, I'll let you know when I send the mail (~ 5 min ;) )\n. Send! Let me know when it's arrived! :) \n. Got it?\n. Okay, :)\n. Super user is repeatably denied, so maybe that is the cause\n--> It was intended that way ;) The App \"Triangle Away Pro\" from the godfather Chainfire disables root for several min after reboot, so the system status remains \"original\". That allows me to use OTA Updates and several \"special\" apps ;)\nThe problem now seems to be curbed.\nI backed up Xprivacy (app + data). Then I uninstalled it (for testing) and rebooted. Et voil\u00e0, my S3 booted\nlargely \"normal\". \nThe whole boot procedure now takes only about 10 to 15 seconds longer than previously (without Xposed Framework & Privacy). \nI have reinstalled and reconfigured Xprivacy and it has remained at the aforementioned time.\n. But I wonder how for example LBE can sum it up in this way ...;) \n. Ok, i'll read it again, thanks for the hint.\n. Okay, I understand it. However, I am of the opinion that an \"Easy Mode / Pure Permission Mode\" or sth would be very useful, in which unexperienced users can (explicitly) only manage the permissions which are directly requested by the apps, sorted groups.\nMaybe you'll think about it again. :+1: \nI wish you a nice, sunny weekend :)\n. :+1: \n. Yes :( \n. Yes, theres no problem, its granted till my smartphone starts ;)\n. Today I had to reboot my phone twice... holy cow its so damn annoying to wait ...and wait....and wait... \nSorry, atm I did not get the chance to record a logcat at a PC.\nBut I am seriously considering to uninstall after XPrivacy again :( That would be really, really Too bad!\n. Sorry, atm I did not get the chance to record a logcat at a PC.\nI hope portamento can do this :/ but have my old logcat... ;)\n. Yes same here, disabling XPrivacy solves the problem immediately.\nSo it must be a problem caused by XPrivacy!!!\nMaybe it's caused by the restriction of booting apps?...\n. \"If a restriction is causing this, try to figure out which one\"\n- Hi Marcel, and how did you imagine that?\n  Should I switch every single permission manually to figure it out from more than 130 apps? :D :D \n  Sorry, that would take many many days of intensive work.\n. btw: Expert Mode was not enabled ;)\n. Do I get the Pro Version when I find the bug? :D \nThen I'll spend my time in investigating :dancer: \n. Hooah! So I'm working! (Anyway I'm considering a donation for your awesome work :+1: )\n. You have misunderstood me!\nI wanted to say that I'm working on it, to be a contributor. :D\nHowever, I have finally found the error at 3 o'clock in the last night.\nThe cause is, as I suspected, the boot restriction. If one sets the hook, for an app that automatically starts (indicated by the warning triangle) then the next system boot-up takes extremely long time!\nIf you remove the checkmarks for these apps, the next boot process is fast like it should be! :)\n. Yes\n. It occurs in every version so far;)\n. I can tell you which apps are affected....\n. Each app I've tested individually. Each is causing the slow boot-up.\n- Adaway\n- AppAware\n- AppSales\n- Dolphin Jetpack\n- Facebook\n- Folder Organizer\n- LagFix (fstrim) Premium\n- Tapatalk\n- Viber\n- Whatsapp 2 date\n- Whatshaddow\nDeselect any of these apps or freeze Xprivacy solves the problem immediately;)\n. So maybe you can check your code for the \"boot\" restriction ;) \n. I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S3 , so I dont think I'm running out of memory ;)\nAn idea from me: Can you send me a \"special\" version, which logs exactly what and when your boat restriction is doing sth? Then I'll boot normally and send you the result. After that I'll restrict one of the apps above and reboot again. I'll also send you this result. Then you can see exactly where the error lies, right?\n. Sorry, atm I did not get the chance to record a logcat at a PC\n. Tested it with half of the listed Apps now,... it seems to be fixed now!!! :] \nGreat work :) Can you maybe explain me how you're cleanup code does its magic? :)\nThanks again for your great help! :)\n. And why?\n. This is understandable, but it is still really very sad!\nMaybe it will be someday an experimental feature of the Pro version....\n. Thanks for the clarification!\n. I would do it for german :dancers: \n. Yes exactly, just for better recognition!\n. Now that's what I would call user friendly! \nNice work daibaron, this shows if the most important user data were used, in a clear and informative way :)\nThe color looks great btw, obvious, but not too intrusive.\n. ok :(\n. But why doesnt \"return fake disconnected state\" work then?\n. Okay, thx anyway :)\n. Thanks! I'll give it as try :) \n. I agree with NeuerUser, normally we don't have to restrict the system apps, or have to change these restrictions that often! \nI'm very glad to hear that it will be part of 1.5 :) \nThanks to both of you! \n. I guess he/she tried to install it with the stock recovery! \n;) \nYou need to install it with a custom recovery like clockwork mod :)\n. v 1.7 now prevents leaking the location in MyBestBrands and Facebook.\nBut Whatsapp still gets my real location (network based), and can even use all sensors :/\nXposed fix is properly installed ;) And I don't get any \"Incompatible...\" warning... \n. in Network Info II my location is perfectly veiled ;) \n@M66B I'm not pretty sure about that :/ but maybe you're right. That would be a shame because I do not see how you could prevent it properly.\n. @treare @M66B For me it is the same. It's scary accurate! Despite the fact that only the network-based positioning is enabled. \n. @M66B Of course I have set the hooks everywhere! The location is completely restricted. I have also deleted the cache and restarted.\n. @GhostlyCrowd If I block it, the location is no longer that exactly! :)\nBut it is still my real location!\n;) :(\n. @M66B did you mean whatsapps data or cache?\nI dont wanna lose all my histories etc..\n. Btw: I have Version 1.7.1 installed. Whatsapp can no longer access on my real location:)\n. Last question: There's anything about the fix in the newest changelog. Is this fix here still included? \n. :)\n. 1) alright, thanks!\n2) This is understandable and acceptable ;) But is the meaning of my adjustment right? Then I would use this for German. Otherwise it would be misleading in my language! ;)\n. Allright :+1: \nI translated \"is dangerous\" into \"Beschr\u00e4nkung bedenklich (App-Absturz)\".\nHopefully it is not too long, but otherwise the meaning would be puzzling\nThe best english translation would be \"Risky* restriction (app crash)\"\n*[doubtful / questionable]\nWhat dou you think about it?\n. That's great! :)\nExcuse me all my questions. I just like to help to make XPrivacy as perfect as possible! :)) \n. You're welcome! :)\n. I agree that would be a great way to gain more privacy. \n. Okay I think I figured out what's the problem.. \nWhen I clear the apps data and start it without Internet connection, the location can't be determined. \nSo I think it's using the ip or the cell towers position. \nAny chance to get this fixed? \n. @XS666 If you have any acute security concerns, then try the following:\nUncheck everything and use runtastic unrestricted. Then watch your battery consumption. Does the strong consumption still occurs?\nI am assuming that it was not due to XPrivacy, but to poor GPS signal!\n. @XS Great to hear! I wish your as great holidays! Alright :)\n. Well, I think that it's our private matter which apps we have installed and which not. That's why you probably implemented this restriction;)\nHowever some apps need to see some other apps!\nA photo editing app for example. It must be able to see the gallery app, or the file explorer app!\n. Thank you!\nDo you mean that this visible App then is also visible for all other restricted Apps? \nPersonally, I find my solution more intuitive for other users (with the pop-up menu). It would also make XPrivacy more clearer.\nBut you are the master! :)\n. Ok I understood that issue with the pop-ups.\nMh, but I don't see why there should be only one visible app. Maybe 3 or 5 would be better! \n(To allow a picture editor for example to see the gallery app, Dropbox and the file explorer ;) )\nThat would be nice! \n. Hi Jaibar,\ngood idea, but I think M66B won't implement this since it can be easily realized by yourself.\nThe exported settings can be found in the root directory of your SD card, named \"XPrivacy.xml\".\nWith apps like SuperBeam (free, link on the bottom) you can send it from one phone to another! \nI hope this was helpful for you!\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.majedev.superbeam&hl=en\n. Thank you, so far, I've done nearly 50%.\nI suggest that I'll share my results here and we'll revise it together! Ok?\n. You're welcome M66B, thank YOU for your awesome work & great support! :)\nWe're glad to help you out!\n. Here is my first translation. \n@M66B I think it's maybe too much text... I mean the whole layout.\nMaybe you should take into consideration, to present it more lightweight...\nLike e.g. Titanium Backup \u2605 root does : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keramidas.TitaniumBackup&hl=de\n:))\n\nDer ultimative, aber dennoch einfach zu verwendende, Privatsph\u00e4re  Manager.\nF\u00fcr die Verwendung dieser App muss das Xposed Framework installiert sein\nBeachten Sie die Installationsanleitung (englisch): https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#installation\nXPrivacy kann verhindern, dass Apps Ihre sensiblen Privatsph\u00e4re relevanten Daten preisgeben. XPrivacy kann die Kategorien von Daten beschr\u00e4nken, auf die eine App zugreifen kann. Dies geschieht dadurch, dass die Apps mit keinen oder falschen Daten gef\u00fcttert werden. Es gibt verschiedene Kategorien von Daten, welche eingeschr\u00e4nkt werden k\u00f6nnen, z. B. \"Kontakte\" oder \"Lokalisierung\". Ein Beispiel:  Wenn Sie den Zugriff auf Ihre Kontakte f\u00fcr eine App beschr\u00e4nken, f\u00fchrt dies dazu, dass diese App auf ihre Anfrage nur eine leere Kontaktliste \u00fcbergeben bekommt. Ebenso bewirkt eine Beschr\u00e4nkung einer App auf die  Ortung (GPS etc.), dass lediglich ein vordefinierter \u201eFake-\u201c Ort an die App \u00fcbergeben wird.\nXPrivacy entzieht (d. h. blockiert) den Apps keine Berechtigungen, was bedeutet, dass die meisten Apps ganz normal weiterarbeiten und nicht zwanghaft beendet werden (force closed). Es gibt zwei Ausnahmen zu dieser Regel, den Zugang zum Internet und zum externen Speicher (in der Regel eine SD-Karte).  Diese werden durch die Verweigerung des Zugriffs (Entziehung der Berechtigungen) eingeschr\u00e4nkt. Es gibt keine andere M\u00f6glichkeit dies umzusetzen, da diese Berechtigungen von Android auf eine besondere Weise gehandhabt werden.  Android \u00fcbertr\u00e4gt die Handhabung dieser Berechtigungen an das zugrunde liegende Linux Netzwerk-/Dateisystem.\nXPrivacy kann zwar vort\u00e4uschen, dass der Internetstatus \u201eoffline\u201c ist und der SD Karten Status \u201enicht eingelegt\u201c (unmounted) ist, aber einige Anwendungen versuchen dennoch auf das Internet/ den Speicher zuzugreifen, was m\u00f6glicherweise zu einem Absturz der App f\u00fchrt.\nWenn die Beschr\u00e4nkung einer Datenkategorie f\u00fcr eine App zu Problemen f\u00fchrt, ist es m\u00f6glich den Zugriff auf die Daten dieser Kategorie einfach wieder zu erlauben, um das Problem zu l\u00f6sen.\nStandardm\u00e4\u00dfig haben alle neu installierten Apps keinen Zugriff auf irgendwelche Daten, um zu verhindern, dass eine neue App sicherheitsrelevanter Daten direkt nach seiner Installation auslie\u00dft und preisgibt.  Kurz nach der Installation einer neuen App wird XPrivacy Sie fragen, auf welche Kategorien von Daten die neue App Zugriff haben soll.\nXPrivacy bringt einen App-Browser mit, der es ihnen erm\u00f6glicht, den Zugriff auf eine bestimmte Datenkategorie einer App schnell zu aktivieren oder zu deaktivieren  (z. B. den Zugriff auf den Kalender).  Es ist auch m\u00f6glich s\u00e4mtliche Datenkategorien f\u00fcr eine Anwendung auf einmal zu bearbeiten.\nUm Ihnen zu helfen m\u00f6gliche Datenlecks zu identifizieren, \u00fcberwacht XPrivacy jeden Zugriffsversuch auf sensible Daten von Ihren Apps. XPrivacy wird dann in seinem App-Browser ein Warndreieck Symbol anzeigen, sobald Daten einer bestimmten Kategorie verwendet / abgerufen wurden. Wenn eine App Android-Berechtigungen f\u00fcr den Zugriff auf eine  Datenkategorie hat, wird diese mit einem Schl\u00fcsselsymbol gekennzeichnet angezeigt. XPrivacy wird auch anzeigen, wenn eine Anwendung Internetzugriff hat, was darauf hinweist, dass die Anwendung ein Risiko darstellt,  indem sie die ausgelesenen/verwendeten Daten auf mit einen externen Server hochladen kann.\nDie gesamte Dokumentation, einschlie\u00dflich der Anweisungen f\u00fcr den Gebrauch, k\u00f6nnen Sie hier finden (englisch): https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#xprivacy\nWenn Sie Unterst\u00fctzung ben\u00f6tigen, k\u00f6nnen Sie diesen XDA Thread benutzen:  http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2320783\n. @M66B No you're not ;) But unfortunately, most users only want to know in a nutshell what the app is and what it can.\nOf course, I'm glad to help you ;)\n@SebRut  This categorization looks good. I would add a category \"limitations\" for the two exceptions (access to the internet and to external storage) with it's potential force closes! :)\n. @M66B Yes Sir, you are right! \n. @craiq nice work, looks good so far -  Excuse me for my absence, but I have a bereavement in the Family.\n. sry wrong! \n. Wrong file again.. sry for that!\n. Well, you're right. But anyway I mean the detailed restriction (with submenus like when you're editing the restrictions of a specific app) of the template! ;)\n. I would prefer the gearwheel, because It symbolizes \"a part of a system\"!\nHow about a abbreviation \"sys\" on the top right of the symbol? Not too big, but maybe in yellow or black letters!\n. I do not understand why you do not want to say the name of the app. Is it a banned app (Black Market, etc.)? If so, I hardly think that you can expect any help here!\nBut this information would help;)\nAnyway, try to restrict the location of the system app 10019 (google-play-services)! In most cases this should work.\nIf it fails to, your app maybe uses you ip / network address for the approximate location ;)\n. Ok. I can not confirm that Facebook does not work.\nFor me facebook is unable to get any location ;) You might be right that it doesnt show up your \"fake\" location :P \nI think that is a bug which @M66B should take a look at... ;)\n. @M66B And your GSF, is it also restricted?\nNow I also restricted everything without any of the dangerous methods - no success. Facebook says that it couldnt determine my location\n. Now they aren't restricted anymore, but I still doesn't get a location...\n. ;) It doesnt worked for me... but then I remembered what my dad told me: If your Computer is running for hours and starts to do strange things, simply reboot it. \n:D After the reboot it works like a charm - thanks @M66B !\n. You can write both in german ;) but it's ok :) Thx for helping me out!\n. You're right! :) Thx\n. And with your new translation it's wrong!!!\n@M66B please change it back to the right meaning ;)\n. No Problem dude...\n. You're welcome sir! :) :+1: \n. Therefore you can use the template feature! Just remove all the hooks from the template, so newly installed apps won't be restricted by default!\nI hope I could help you out.\nCheers,\n28Black\n. Why dont you use apps like this?!\nSmart App Protector(App Lock)\n(free)\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sp.protector.free&hl=de\n. Be careful. One might suspect that you want to bypass a time limit of trial versions from paid apps...\nI think such a restriction would not help protect your privacy, but rather some black sheep of product piracy! ;)\n. XPrivacy logs in the logcat, like most other applications.\n-> Ok, where is it stored?\nDid you check if this problem also exists when XPrivacy is disabled?\n-> As i said before, the problem is only present if XPrivacy is enabled. Disabling it solves it (right after the reboot).\nSo it must be a problem caused by XPrivacy. \nInfo: No system app is restricted!\n///Did you check if this problem also exists when Xposed is disabled?\n///You can use the XPrivacy remover if needed: http://d-h.st/l9p\n///Without log it is difficult / impossible to find the problem.\n. I know how to make it, I just thought that XPrivacy would store it on the SD card if I select this option! \nIll try to record a logcat with an app ;)\n.

Any news according this issue?\n. Yes I fixed the permissions ;) Is it a problem? \nOut of memory? That wouldn't be so good. I'll try clearing XPrivacys data now ;)\n. Would clearing the data fix the problem if its caused by \"fixing permissions\"?\n. Well I dont know how to do it manually.\nI'll try to export the settings, delete the data, import the settings! Ok?\n. To late ;) but its not a problem my mom doesnt have that much apps installed ;) \nI'll set up the restrictions now and keep you uptodate!\n. Update1: Importing my settings and restrictions (!) worked finde! ;) (I connected the phone with usb debugging and c&p the exported settings from .xprivacy to the root of my sd card. Then i imported it successfully\n. Update2: Freezed and rebooted again... \nThe memory isnt the problem, there were 80+ mb.\n. Update3:\nNow I did exactly what you told me I cleared all its data (no restriction was there), but the problem still occurs.\nDisabling XPrivacy in the Xposed Installer solves the issue, but this cant be a solution! ;) \n. Ok @M66B , the phone is running now for ~40 min without problems (XPrivacy disabled in the XPosed Installer)\nWith XPrivacy enabled, it doesn't live for more than 5 minutes! :-1: \n. Hi @M66B ,\nI'm going crazy! It seems just as if the problem does not occur when the phone is connected via USB debugging.\nI have made an observation. If the phone is not connected via USB debugging, the problem occurs shortly after the \"media scan\" has finished.\nMaybe that will help you further ...\n. Hooray! \nFinally the error occurred while connected via USB debugging!\nThe log could be a little bit longer, because I had to wait a bit.\nThe error occurred at approximately >11:38 (local time).\nHere is the logcat: --> PM on XDA\n. On my moms phone is the version 1.9.12 installed!\nNice that you could figure out the problem! :)\n. With XPosed Framework 2.2. Maybe I need to install your patch for android 4.1.2 anyway?\n. First of all: The error still occurs.\nBut: It now takes longer until it comes to freeze and reboot! So I think we are on the right track!\n. Concerning \" Assume system ready after 150 seconds \", I've recorded the time it takes for the phone to boot:\nFrom pressing \"Power on\" -> 1:14 min until I can enter the pin code. From there -> 1:10 until the boot seems to be completet.\nSo overall, it takes about 2:30 minutes until the phone is operable.\n(I thank God for the fact that my Galaxy S3 is much(!!!) faster! :D)\n. Now it gets interesting. Almost exactly after 10 minutes my phone is frozen and restarted!\n. I'm recording another logcat atm. You'll see it right after the phone crashes ;)\n. Its in your XDA inbox. The problem occured at ~ 17:15.\n. Sry this also doesnt work :(\n. Ok, I'll record another one. But sadly I aint a programmer so I when I open the log, its like a chinese book :(\n. I made another log, this time with timestamps. (check XDA)\nThe error occured right after I unlocked the screen! \nSo you have to take a look at 09-09 17:25:16.769 and what follows next  !! \n. Now, these are really bad news.\nPerhaps it is a stupid question, but can't you avoid such an error by re-registering the XPrivacy provider again?\n. That is why I like LG... NOT... Exactly because of such problems.\nI think I'll be installing a custom rom for my mother (based on AOSP).  Hopefully it will work then!\n. After thorough research, I have to say, unfortunately, that there is no stable custom rom.\nFor me personally, that would be no problem. But my mother just needs a rom that works.\nThe error also occurs in the previous version of the official rom.\nSo I have to hope for a fix from your side.\n. I'm running now a more or less stable custom rom (4.3), as expected the error is gone ;)\nPlease keep in mind that other users of the stock rom on LG Optimus L7 (P700) may have this bug too!\n;)\n. If it is the same problem like I had, the problem always appears when XPrivacy is activated. \nIt is either a problem of XPrivacy, or of the ROM from LG!\nSince the rom runs very stable, I think that it is unfortunately XPrivacy which causes the issue...\nFor now, the only solution is to use a custom rom!!!\nPlease note: \n- the rom must be compatible with XPosed Framework (Use CM based or AOSP... not MIUI !!!)\n- I strongly recommend not to use a 4.3 rom, since it does not run stable & is laggs ...\n- Pay attention to the baseband! (v10 / v20)\nI can personally recommend this rom:\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2282245\n\nDISCLAIMER\nI take no responsibility for any fault or damage caused by any procedures within this response. No warranties of any kind are given.\n--> It might kill your kitten, destroy your house and start the Mayan apocalypse. Use it at your own risk!\n. Please have understanding that it has been done a lot (!!!) since these versions.\nA detailed logcat is the only way to solve the problem.\nDo not forget that the developer (Marcel) is also just a human being. With a right to leisure time...;)\nSince there is no evidence that XPrivacy is the problem, please try to use the workaround with a custom rom! :)\n. Here is a download link for the version 1.8.13\nhttp://d-h.st/4S0\nKeep in mind - its outdated! :+1: \n. @M66B Can you please add a string for \"E-mail\" since its \"E-Mail\" in germany! ;) Would be nice :)\n. Of cause :) Thx!\n. I agree with point 1 & 2\nOnce we have configured / restricted an app, we do not need to be asked at each update for re-restriction! \n. Thank you for your feedback.\n1. I'll try to find an appropriate translation with Napzter (from XDA)!\n2. I know that I can see it there, I just thought that the Pro-addition would be really cool! :+1: \n. Sry, #669 was already closed so I didnt saw it! :) Thx for the fast update btw!\n. Your welcome, sir! :)\n. Thank you, I hope you'll make it! :)\n. Hi lolmensch, can you please try the app \"Seeder\" (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lcis.seeder&hl=de).\nI know it's a paid app, but you can get a refund within 15 min which should be enough time to test it.\nMaybe it can fix your issue ;)\n. @danielmmmm We're looking forward to get a more detailed template. As soon as @M66B applies this, it would be easy to restrict these unsafe categories by default when you install a new app.\nI agree with you, I'm restricting almost always manually  \"/proc\" and \"GservicesProvider\". \n. Sorry for the frequency of the updates... But its hard to keep the translation consistent while others  are messing it up royally  ;)\n. You're welcome!, sir.\nAlright 28k+ is really much ^.^\n. Nope it's fixed now :)\n. Allright I didn't saw it ;)\nSo will you add this please? :+1: \n. Excuse my absence. \n. Yes, it tells me that the migration was successfully.\nThanks for the solutions, Titanium Backup saved me ;) \n. Yes, I upgraded XPrivacy, did normally reboot and then simply opened XPrivacy after the \"Migration completed\" Message.\nBut just 1 - 4 app icons were loaded and all restrictions are gone.\n. You have misunderstood me. All apps were displayed, but the icons were not loaded. Only the first ~ 4.\n I'll do it afterwards, I'm in the University and can not record a logcat at this moment.\n. I did. Every time I've scrolled, they are gone and have been shown extremely slow and sporadic.\n. Oh yeah you're right ;)\n. Mhh, how about automatically open the Xposed Installer on the \"Framework\" Tab to have a easy restart button?\n. @M66B Didn't know that. Thanks that you have clarified this. I will take the conventional way for restarting my device in the future.\n. ",

    "NaabKing": "I would like to have the descriptions in the app itself, for example let's for permission \"PHONE CALLS\", i image, there would be a \"?\" icon next to that and when i would click on it, the description would pop up saying:\n\"[B]READ PHONE STATUS AND IDENTITY[B]\nAllows the app to access the phone features of the device. This permission allows the app to determine the phone number and device IDs, whether a call is active, and the remote number connected by a call.\"\nThis way, i would understand EVERY permission what it does and i would kinda know if the app really needs it or not.\nPS: [B] as \"bold\" :D\n. Well, this is not exatly what i typed/wanted, its more like 30%, i still don't understand all the permissions and most are not explained on the wiki eather, if they were in app as a popup, they could be translated, so everyone would know what each permission do, and it's not even that hard, since in \"my idea\" all someone would need to do is copy/paste the text from Google Play Store (where each permission is displayed so that EVERYONE can understand what it does).\nI'll give you one example, the permission \"Contacts\" is not described, but a simple look on Google Play (where i would copy/paste all the permission descriptions) says:\n\"Allows the app to read data about your contacts stored on your device, including the frequency with which you've called, emailed, or communicated in other ways with specific individuals. This permission allows apps to save your contact data, and malicious apps may share contact data without your knowledge.\"\nThis should be inside the app as a popup for every permission, this way EVERYONE would understand permissions :)\nPS: Even google has done it, just go to your \"App Manager\", open an app, scroll down where permissions are and click on a permission, a pop-up will show up explaining the permission in details so that each and everyone can understand it, i don't know what each permission does in your app (cuz they are not even closely understandable to what Google has done, so i can't check it in app manager for details eather), but you do and i don't think this would be very hard to do for you.\nGreetings\n. It's just weird to me, cuz i've been using 2 apps for app permissions untill now, yours is third and i never had problems understanding permissions and i knew exactly what to do, in your app i'm so confused i don't know what to restrict or not.\n1st app i was using was \"LBE Privacy Guard\", this was probably best app i've used for this, but sadly it doesn't work on Android 4.0, here's how it looked there:\nhttps://lh6.ggpht.com/Ga2wybvUyzGAixpm2qsGMcJl0CeT_QXLFkeGTpeR8jPzxms52YTZhLFZfVsQXBjmbhE\n2nd app i was using was \"SRT AppGuard\", which still works on Android 4.2, but i decided to go to your app, cuz it uses xposed framework (i readed only good things about it) and \"SRT AppGuard\" is not opensource, but here's how the app looked:\nhttp://cdn1.aptoide.com/imgs/3/1/8/318b1893ad3e959a406c3e194907c46f.png\nI can understand permissions in both app-s i listed, but yours is giving me problems, hope you can do something about it still =/\n. Yes, this is exactly the opposite of what i'm asking and what i think should be as text INSIDE the app :D I still think the pop-up is the best way to do it.\nOn the link you gave it says (this is pure guessing) for \"Contacts\":\n\"return an empty contact list\", it should say \"Read/Modify Contacts\" (or whatever)\nBUT, even if you can put the \"Restrictions\" (and not Permission) text inside the app i would be happy, but i think it needs to be inside the app, cuz it takes too much time to click on \"(i)\" and it opens in mobile browser, still a pop-up is the best way (=\nSo for example, i click on the \"( i )\" button next to \"Contacts\", a pop-up displays saying \"return an empty contact list\" or \"Read/Modify Contacts\" is enough for me to understand what something does :) Finally we're on the same page ^^\n. About \"3\", it's not hard to swipe it away, you are right, BUT by DEFAULT every permission is checked, meaning, if i just swipe the notification away, it's 90% likely the app wont start, so i can't just swipe it away, i need to go to the app, click \"Menu\", click \"All\" and then the bug happens which i described above in \"2)\", so at least give us an option that nothing is checked by default and then it won't be a problem to just swipe the notification away.\nHow can you say that about \"3a\", at the moment NOTHING is there, it's blank (and that part of the screen isn't \"moving\" eather), i'm pretty sure noone would mind a checkbox there, i haven't seen any other app that would do this the way you did it.\n\nDo you still want me to do Issue for every problem? And what do you think about \"1)\", is it true what unclefab said? I should for example check \"Location\" permission in every app even if they don't have Android permission for it?\n. and what about \"1)\"? Is it really like unclefab said?\n. ok, i'll wait for the new version then and see what's diffrent (=\nThanks\n. I agree with OP\n. That's really nice (=\n. The picture above that @daibaron posted\n. Please make this availible offline ^^ It would be MUCH better then it is now\n. I support that too, even only 1 option like \"Force English layout\" would be ok (=\n. you are right, here's the link, i will for sure try this one out:\nhttp://mohammadag.xceleo.org/public/Android/Xposed/\nLink taken from here:\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2327541\n. > I was thinking to allow/deny as long as the application is in the foreground/visible.\nThist is what i was asking for actually :D Allow a program to use a permission as long as it is in the \"foreground/visible\" (=\n.

    "unclefab": "I'm not sure this is what I talk about in #90.\nWhat I meant is like a view where one sees all the perms, and where one can choose to disable this or that perm for all the apps at once.\n. So you see, it's not what I had meant...\n. Ok, I see...\nSo I will have to use Tor for this purpose.\nThanks a lot for your answer:-)!\n. Some apps don't like to be prevented from accessing the net with xprivacy.\nFor such apps just use af+wall, it will block them but they won't crash (that's what I do and I don't know if it will work with your game, but for my apps it has always worked so far)...\n. Maybe, or maybe not.\nBut as far as I know it's not open source...\n. Maybe this telephony incompatibility comes from the fact that my phone is dual SIM?\nBut for now something really strange happened.\nYesterday after getting the incompatibility message I thought that something might have gone wrong during the installation so I uninstalled everything including xposer.\nI reinstalled the whole bunch, and after flashing the 4.1 xprivacy patch I got a bootloop.\nI removed the patch app process and put back the original app process, it rebooted.\nI expected xprivacy not to work, or at least to ask for the patch since it was not there anymore, but it didn't. It doesn't ask for the patch and everything works fine, except that I still have the incompatibility message which means that maybe perms are not spoofed/blocked for the phone app (I didn't have time to check the phone app, but for other apps it works, my location is spoofed, and so are my android id and my mac id).\nDoes anyone have a clue about what's going on?\nStrange, isn't it?:-)\n. Today I made more testing.\nIt still works without the patch, it still tells me that the telephony is incompatible, but apart from that everything I tested behaved the way it was supposed to.\nEven the phone app, if I restrict it too much it crashes, if I unselect the right perm it works again, which means that xprivacy does its job. The same with all my apps, the only thing is that I can't check for each and every of them whether all the perms are spoofed or not...\n. I've installed version 0.36 but unfortunately I can't report the incompatibility from within the app cuz I don't have any email app like gmail.\nAnyway, now it says \"incompatible android.telephony.MultiSimTelephonyManager\", so now we know for sure that it comes from the dual SIM.\n. Ok, I'll download an email app and send you the file.\n. Sorry, I've been busy today...\nI've just sent you a mail from a specially for that purpose downloaded yahoo app.\nIt may be in your spam folder though.\nDid you get it?\n. Ok, thank you very much!\n. I just downloaded version 0.37 and the incompatibility is gone.\nYou rock !\n. Thanks!\nI knew that some of the perms I mentioned had not much to do with xprivacy (you talked about it in the faq), but I mentioned them anyway, one never knows:-)\nRead media storage is not restricted. SD card access is, but media storage is different, it's for the system and data files. I've noticed that some apps could access it, even with external storage disabled.\nGet tasks and access downloads, I didn't see them in xprivacy.\nSend sticky broadcasts should be restricted to my opinion cuz it uses memory and can make the phone slow, the same for sync related perms (not to mention battery, and privacy issues because if it's ok for apps like let's say yahoo or gmail to read and write sync settings, read sync stats etc., it's not for some other apps that ask for these perms eventhough they don't need it).\nNFC, because I don't want my phone to be hackable from outside (the same with bluetooth).\nGet/write data I dunno what it is, but it seems suspicious to me. They are system apps related perms, and so far I've blocked them with permission denied, just in case:-) The way I understand it is that it's more or less similar with read/write profile, see below.\nCall privileged, it says: \"allows the app to call any phone number, including emergency numbers, without your intervention\". It's a different perm than call phones (this one allows to call regular phones but not emergency numbers).\nGet/write profile enables the app to read and write personal profile information stored on the phone, such as your name and contact information. And it adds: \"this means that the app can identify you and send your profile information to others\".\n. I read about these perms directly from my phone.\nI made a quick search and I found this:\nhttp://techblogon.com/android-permissions-list-example/\nand here there are more, there are two pdf that may help you:\nhttp://www.google.com/m?q=list+of+android+permissions&client=ms-opera-mini-android&channel=new\n. Yes, I know, that's why I previously said that some perms are not xprivacy's job.\nBut perms like media storage, get/write profile, call privileged, read sync stats, read/write call log are.\nIt's up to you of course:-)\n.

Yep, I just downloaded version 0.40...\nThanks a lot!\n. Ok, so I'll have to live with it:-)\nOr well, I will dig a bit inside the app and see if I find the cause...\n. Good idea!\nSometimes when I open xprivacy it says that it's not activated in xposer and I have to reboot, but if I hadn't open xprivacy then I wouldn't have known that it wasn't active.\nI wanted to create an issue about it but since you created this one I stick with it.\n. Nope, expert mode was enabled.\nAnyway, it's not a big deal, I just pointed at it like this people can review their newly installed apps.\n. I have it on my two devices (a tab and a phone), but if others don't have this issue then I understand that you can't look at it.\nNo worries, it's not a big deal:-)\n. I don't understand why you remove a feature that works.\nOk, it's not 100% privacy related (although the above example about facebook is), so what? It's a plus for xprivacy.\nSome people cant use it properly? Ok, so then let it be an expert mode feature.\nWell, it's up to you...\n. It happened to me with other apps as well, it's because xprivacy blocks the internet access.\nIf it could lure the app into believing there's no internet access eventhough there is then the app would work.\n. No cache, and of course I waited.\nApps like side bars (home flip, side bar etc.). For those apps it's not a big deal since they need to know which apps are installed in order to do their work, but if they can do it even if they have been restricted some others can as well.\n. So I've installed version 1.0.1, and I've seen that you had added many options in the installed apps section.\nI selected all, and I wiped side bar to make sure that there isn't any cache.\nBut it still can access my apps. I mean, not recently running apps but apps that I can choose and insert from within sidebar to customize it, and that I can open afterwards which means that sidebar has full access to them.\nStrange, because at the same time my stock task manager can't display the recently and currently running apps if I restricted their access from xprivacy...\n. Sorry, my last message was not very clear...\nI freshly installed sidebar (so no  cache, no data) and xprivacy blocked automatically the permissions, so in theory sidebar shouldn't be able to see which apps are installed on my device.\nBut when I opened sidebar and clicked on the cross to add apps the usual sidebar apps list popped out and showed all my installed apps. I chose a few apps, and once they were on sidebar  I tried to open them from sidebar to see if it worked and it did.\nThis means that, eventhough apps access is restricted in xprivacy, sidebar finds a way to access the apps.\n. Waow, it works, I'm impressed...\nYou are great mate, thanks a lot!\n. Of course I killed the apps:-)\n. I'm on jb 4.1.2, and I know about this new perm, I've blocked it from day one with permissions denied.\nBack to xprivacy, it's read and write.\nYou say that you can't reproduce it, which means that if you block let's say sd card and not media you can access media but not sd?\nStrange, on my phone I still can access both.\nJust now I made some tests with Dr web anti virus.\nI blocked the three storage related perms, and I can't access neither the external storage nor some of the internal storage, but I still can access all the /system folder.\nI blocked get external storage and media but kept sdcard unchecked, I can access both external and internal storage.\nI blocked get external storage and sd card but kept media unchecked, I can't access neither external not internal storage, except the/system folder.\nIf you want I can describe what happens with other apps, but it's more or less the same story, they can access storage they are not supposed to.\n. Ok, I will try to be more concise:-)\nMy understanding, and correct me if I'm wrong, is that:\nwe have external storage (ext sd card, it can be restricted),\nmedia (music, pics, videos etc, located in the /data/media folder. It's sometimes called internal sd and although it's actually part of the internal storage it can be restricted), \ninternal storage (/data, /dev, /efs, /system and so on folders, it can't be restricted).\nNow I test with ghost commander (a file manager).\nI block getExternalStorageState, media and sdcard, I can access my internal storage only, correct.\nI block getExternalStorageState and sdcard but keep media unrestricted, I can't access external sd but I can access media, correct.\nI block getExternalStorageState and media but keep sdcard unrestricted, I can access both my media and my external sd card (actually I can access everything on the phone, as if nothing had been restricted), not correct.\nI block media and sdcard but keep getExternalStorageState unrestricted, I can access everything on the phone including media (same as above), not correct.\nHave I been concise enough?:-)\n. It still doesn't work. For now I'm busy and I can't get a logcat from my phone's terminal emulator but I will send one later when I connect to my laptop.\n. Ok, here it is, hopefully it's what you need (actually the whole version is much longer, I put here what seemed relevant to me, in case you want the full logcat just ask and I'll put it here):\n\n[deleted]\n. I made a full logcat, but the command to extract doesn't work, I tried many times and everytime I get a message \"grep is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file\".\n. Allright, so:\n1- getExternalStorageState and sdcard are restricted, media is not.

Thanks for this article, everything became clear.\nRestricting sdcard will block internal and external media storage (both considered as sdcard, namely primary-internal and secondary-external), but not internal system (/efs, /dev, /system and stuff) files since as you said they can't be restricted.\nAllright, but what about restricting media?\nI made further tests and I found out that restricting it will make the external sdcard read only.\nSo maybe it should be renamed something like \"write ext sd\"?\n. You mean in 1.5? Cuz in 1.4 it still doesn't work...\n.

I've just checked, android id, imei and bssid show deface as well, but in previous versions they showed nothing...\n. If some apps crash with an empty mac why people with such apps don't put manually a mac address? As for me nothing ever crashed with an empty mac. Don't you think it would be nice to be able to choose not to have deface?\nAnd what about android id, imei, bssid? Do they have to show deface as well because of some people using nicely engineered spying apps that crash when there's an empty value?\n. Answer to 1:\nsome apps don't need to have any android permission to leak private data, for example they can leak which cell tower you are on without using any permissions. And that's just one example, apps can do much more than that...\n. I don't understand what you mean.\nI have multi windows on both my galaxy grand and my galaxy tab, and I don't have any compatibility problem...\n. If one wants to have all one's apps in multi windows mode it's easy, just use xposed multi windows apps manager. No need to mod any app, the module will do it for you:-)\n. Definitively, I use it on both my tab and my phone and all my apps show in multi windows mode.\nInstallation with xposer, select, reboot, done:-)\n. Google apps will give you a hard time, since Google doesn't like privacy and tries its best to prevent it.\nIf privacy is really a concern for you you'd better uninstall the Google apps, and access whatever Google service you like from your browser.\nA bit less convenient, but at least your data is safe...\n. Yes, I restricted everything. \nOne thing is that in my settings I can't put more than 3 digits for MCC and MNC, and in country I can't put digits at all (only 2 letters). So I guess the problem comes fro there. Here's a logcat for network info:\nI/XPrivacy/XPackageManagerService( 5720): get 10075/sdcard storage=true # 351 ms\nI/XPrivacy/XPackageManagerService( 5720): gid=3003 restriction=storage action=sd\ncard uid=10075\nI/XPrivacy/XPackageManagerService( 5720): gid=3002 restriction=storage action=sd\ncard uid=10075\nI/XPrivacy/XPackageManagerService( 5720): gid=1015 restriction=storage action=sd\ncard uid=10075\nI/XPrivacy/XPackageManagerService( 5720): Deny sdcard_r/sdcard_rw uid=10075\nI/XPrivacy/XPackageManagerService( 5720): gid=1023 restriction=storage action=sd\ncard uid=10075\nI/XPrivacy/XPackageManagerService( 5720): gid=1028 restriction=storage action=sd\ncard uid=10075\nI/XPrivacy/XPackageManagerService( 5720): Deny sdcard_r/sdcard_rw uid=10075\nI/XPrivacy/XPackageManagerService( 5720): get 10075/media storage=true # 268 ms\nI/XPrivacy/XPackageManagerService( 5720): gid=3003 restriction=storage action=me\ndia uid=10075\nI/XPrivacy/XPackageManagerService( 5720): gid=3002 restriction=storage action=me\ndia uid=10075\nI/XPrivacy/XPackageManagerService( 5720): gid=1023 restriction=storage action=me\ndia uid=10075\nI/XPrivacy/XPackageManagerService( 5720): Deny media_rw uid=10075\nI/XPrivacy/XPackageManagerService( 5720): get 10075/inet internet=true # 261 ms\nI/XPrivacy/XPackageManagerService( 5720): gid=3003 restriction=internet action=i\nnet uid=10075\nI/XPrivacy/XPackageManagerService( 5720): Deny inet/inet_raw uid=10075\nI/XPrivacy/XPackageManagerService( 5720): gid=3002 restriction=internet action=i\nnet uid=10075\n. Yes, I've seen it as well, no network related log. But 10075 is Network Info II's uid, I don't understand why it doesn't show anything about network category. I've made more logcats, but still the same, no luck.\nI had a look at Network Info II in xprivacy, and it shows that everytime I use it it tries to access \"getCellLocation\" and \"getNeighboringCellInfo\" that are restricted, at least in theory. And everytime it manages to access country, MMC and MNC.\nI had opened another issue about the search button and the field next to it being greyed in xprivacy's settings, maybe it's related?\n. Ok, so in the phone category I see that it tries to access getDeviceId, getLine1Number and getSuscriberId, that are all restricted. \n. That's what I've done from the very beginning, everything is fully restricted.\n. Here you are, but I couldn't enter the command before the boot logo came cuz before the device was off and unrecognizable:\nI/XPrivacy/XPackageManagerService(  460): gid=1023 restriction=storage

Yes, I know, it doesn't make any sense...\nI will keep on searching, and if I find the cause fir this leak I'll post it here.\nAnyway, thanks a lot for taking time to read the long logcats and for replying, you are very committed and dedicated and it's very much appreciated, respect!:-)\n. I installed it this night and got a bootloop, so I had to downgrade back to 1.5...\n. Sure!! But I'm back to V 1.5 (see my comment in the bootloop issue). \n. For such problems one very easy solution, use Armona FM (look for it in xda). It enables you to access your system files from recovery, making it easy to add or remove files, apps etc. (easier than adb since one doesn't need any computer). I had this bootloop as well so I went to recovery, opened Aroma, went to the /data/app folder and deleted xprivacy 1.6, and to play safe I deleted as well the xprivacy file in the dalvik cache. Then I went to my sdcard folder, copied xprivacy 1.5 and pasted it in /data/app, rebooted and everything was fine, I didn't even loose my xprivacy settings, cool:-)))\n. http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1646108\n. Version 1.65 works like a charm for me, the most stable version I had so far, even my problem of the android section to open very slowly and its navigation to be freaking slow is solved.\nBut now I see that in V 1.66 you reverted \"Restrict access to /proc\" again.\nI'm a bit confused, what does it mean?\nCan't one restrict proc anymore?\n. Ok, so I stay with 1.65 for now, cuz it works fine on my device...\n. I have the same, it comes from some restrictions in the android system section (in network I think). But if you know the name of this wifi you want to connect to then just add it manually (with the password) and then it will connect.\nI still have to find which restriction causes it but so far I didn't have time for it, and anyway it's not a big deal since if you follow the method described above it works.\nWhen I find I will let you know...\n. On my device I allways had getScanResults and getConfiguredNetworks enabled and it doesn't work so I guess it must come from another restriction. Maybe getConnectionInfo and/or getDhcpInfo ?\n. Allright, I found where it came from for me.\nIt's because in the location section I had restricted getScanResults. I unrestricted it and my phones sees again new wifi networks:-)\n. Ok, I will make a small tutorial about settings for Xprivacy one of these days when I have time...\n. I just wrote this:\nhttp://wiki.faircode.eu/index.php?title=Generic_Settings\nLet me know if it's fine and if you want me to write more. If it's not feel free to tell me, I won't feel offended since it's my first wiki article:-))\n. I made some headings, put some text in bold and re arrange 2-3 things, and now I think it looks the way you want. I have to admit that it's much neater and nicer this way:-))\nGood night, tomorrow I think I will be able to finish the article...\n. Oh yes, true, it's a folder!\nSo of course it can't be spoofed.\nSorry for the stupid question, if I had thought a bit more I wouldn't have asked it...\n. Sorry, the bootloop didn't come from Xprivacy, I should have waited a bit before to post:-(\n. Ok, I see...\nWhat about some apps like Android system, Settings, Settings storage and Wlan Test (one package)? Cuz I just found out that I was wrong, they still leak even with Xprivacy, but much less than before...\n. Actually I made some tests, and Android System, Settings, Settings Storage and Wlan Test all access the internet. The thing is that they are part of the same shared package, and I can't restrict isConnected from Xprivacy cuz if I do so I can't connect at all anymore. I guess it's because of Wlan Test, but since it's a shared package it means that if I allow it for one app I allow it for the others.\nSo the question is, is there a way to restrict them anyway?\n. Ok, but I didn't have this problem with previous versions, actually until 1.75...\n. Mmmmh, I see... So I will investigate, thanks for the info!!!\n. Nope, it's not this, cuz I've removed all the multi windows reated stuff from values/dimens and android manifest since it interferes with my floating multi windows mod. Believe it or not but before you made xprivacy multi windows compatible I never had a problem, and after you did the window opens huge in floating mode because of the min and max values (I had the same problem with some other multi windows enabled apps).\nI didn't report about it here since not many people use floating multi windows and since I know that for people who use regular multi widows everything goes ok.\nSo the multi instance compatibility must come from somewhere else. Actally there's another app that is as good as Xprivacy, it's Appsettings, so I'll go to its xda thread and ask there. I start to wonder if it hasn't something to do with the Xposed bridge...\nCool for the 1000 th issue, it wasn't intentional but still, thanks for the fame:-)\n. I allways wait for the update to complete...\nAnyway, I have tried with all possible template/import combinations without any results, it still erases my restrictions on the dangerous functions and then refuses to import them back.\nUsing a template, be it default or alternate, merging or not merging, is of not much help since obviously all apps don't have the same restrictions.\nThe conclusion is that if I want to use the latest Xprivacy versions I have to tick/untick manually and test extensively (cuz I don't remember what can and what can't be restricted for all my apps), a long, boring and tedious process.\nI don't understand why you've implemented this, really, but for now I have no other choice but to be back again to 2.0.25:-(\n. Of course:-)\n. Thanks mate, I appreciate!\nBut no rush, take your time:-)\n. Version 2.1.5-4 works well, thank you Marcel, you're The Guy!!!\nRespect...\n. ",
    "jj14x": "Thanks unclefab :)\nI guess I didn't quite understand why the app reacted that way to internet access block by xprivacy. \nI may have to install af+wall, but thought I'd report it here, in case XPrivacy could be enhanced to work in a similar manner.\n. Instead of revoking the internet permission, is there a way to make the apps believe that there is no internet access instead? (that would prevent this crash)\n. ",

    "fcerebel": "Xprivacy does not create delay, but it make app misbehave(which is not the same as forced crash by permission revocation) due to what I've said above, even though fake data in right form are provided.\nThe misbehave leads to the delay.\n\nIf the statement \"same API-blocking tricks\" is not right, should I describe it as API hijacking? Then everyone is using this. The apps using binary injection has literally no less than 100 million users.The number is large even if only 1% of these devices are rooted, While you can hardly find a legally sold android phone with google apps in China.\nSo I cannot quite agree with it, in fact these \"make some applications unusable\" apps are the most compatible ones: no rely on roms/android versions/system file modification/deoxed requirement, effectively same low chance to cause crashes as with PDroid/XPrivacy.\n.

    "wbedard": "While I certainly wouldn't want to disable all notifications, I do support an option to only notify upon a change in permissions (added or removed).  I think the Play Store approach is a fine example.\n. Thanks for at least considering it.  A couple of parting questions, though (after having read FAQ #20...):\n1.  Does XPrivacy create a notification whenever any app is updated?  I have not used XPrivacy and was simply drawing from the context of the feature request and it's comments.\n2.  Reflecting on FAQ #20, am I correct in understanding that an app update could add an underlying \"control\" that XPrivacy does handle but that would not be reflected in a change of the Android permission scheme?\nThanks again and I will continue to follow XPrivacy with great interest!\n.

I cut it from just after loading the app list to right after the crash.\n====begin logcat====\n07-30 17:31:52.007 I/XPrivacy/XNetworkInfo(8709): get 1000/isConnected internet=false \n07-30 17:31:52.007 I/XPrivacy/XNetworkInfo(8709): get 1000/isConnected internet=false \n07-30 17:31:52.007 I/XPrivacy/XNetworkInfo(8709): get 1000/isConnected internet=false \n07-30 17:31:52.007 W/ContextImpl(8709): Calling a method in the system process without a qualified user: android.app.ContextImpl.sendBroadcast:1082 android.privacy.PrivacySettingsManagerService.notification:129 android.privacy.PrivacySettingsManager.notification:119 android.privacy.PrivacySettingsManager.notification:108 android.privacy.surrogate.PrivacyConnectivityManager.getActiveNetworkInfoForUid:134 \n07-30 17:31:52.007 W/ContextImpl(8709): Calling a method in the system process without a qualified user: android.app.ContextImpl.sendBroadcast:1082 android.privacy.PrivacySettingsManagerService.notification:129 android.privacy.PrivacySettingsManager.notification:119 android.privacy.PrivacySettingsManager.notification:108 android.privacy.surrogate.PrivacyConnectivityManager.getActiveNetworkInfoForUid:134 \n07-30 17:31:52.017 I/XPrivacy/XNetworkInfo(8709): get 1000/isConnected internet=false \n07-30 17:31:52.017 W/ContextImpl(8709): Calling a method in the system process without a qualified user: android.app.ContextImpl.sendBroadcast:1082 android.privacy.PrivacySettingsManagerService.notification:129 android.privacy.PrivacySettingsManager.notification:119 android.privacy.PrivacySettingsManager.notification:108 android.privacy.surrogate.PrivacyConnectivityManager.getActiveNetworkInfoForUid:134 \n07-30 17:31:52.037 I/XPrivacy(26659): used 10294/null null=false\n07-30 17:31:52.077 I/XPrivacy(26659): used 10438/null null=false\n07-30 17:31:52.157 I/XPrivacy(26659): used 10439/null null=false\n07-30 17:31:52.177 I/XPrivacy(26659): used 10069/null null=false\n07-30 17:31:52.217 I/XPrivacy(26659): used 10278/null null=false\n07-30 17:31:52.307 I/XPrivacy(26659): used 10331/null null=true\n07-30 17:31:52.307 I/XPrivacy(26659): used 10238/null null=false\n07-30 17:31:52.347 I/XPrivacy(26659): used 10296/null null=true\n07-30 17:31:52.417 I/XPrivacy(26659): used 10065/null null=false\n07-30 17:31:52.457 I/XPrivacy(26659): used 10056/null null=false\n07-30 17:31:52.517 I/XPrivacy(26659): used 10182/null null=false\n07-30 17:31:52.527 I/XPrivacy(26659): used 10182/null null=false\n07-30 17:31:52.567 I/XPrivacy(26659): used 10182/null null=false\n07-30 17:31:52.867 I/XPrivacy/XIoBridge(24944): get setting Version=1.7.26 \n07-30 17:31:52.867 I/XPrivacy/XIoBridge(24944): get 10051//proc identification=false \n07-30 17:31:52.867 I/XPrivacy/XIoBridge(24944): get setting Version=1.7.26 \n07-30 17:31:52.867 I/XPrivacy/XIoBridge(24944): get 10051//proc identification=false \n07-30 17:31:52.867 I/XPrivacy/XEnvironment(24944): get 10051/getExternalStorageState storage=false \n07-30 17:31:52.887 W/ContextImpl(9138): PDroid:ContextImpl: ContextImpl being created but already has sOuterContext\n07-30 17:31:53.937 W/ContextImpl(9757): PDroid:ContextImpl: ContextImpl being created but already has sOuterContext\n07-30 17:31:53.937 W/ContextImpl(9757): PDroid:ContextImpl: ContextImpl being created but already has sOuterContext\n07-30 17:31:54.117 W/GAV2    (27257): Thread[Service Reconnect,5,main]: Service unavailable (code=1), using local store.\n07-30 17:31:54.117 W/ActivityManager(8709): Unable to start service Intent { act=com.google.android.gms.analytics.service.START (has extras) } U=0: not found\n07-30 17:31:54.127 I/XPrivacy/XConnectivityManager(27257): get 10244/getActiveNetworkInfo internet=false \n07-30 17:31:54.127 W/ContextImpl(8709): Calling a method in the system process without a qualified user: android.app.ContextImpl.sendBroadcast:1082 android.privacy.PrivacySettingsManagerService.notification:129 android.privacy.IPrivacySettingsManager$Stub.onTransact:98 android.os.Binder.execTransact:351 dalvik.system.NativeStart.run:-2 \n07-30 17:31:54.137 I/XPrivacy/XNetworkInfo(27257): get 10244/isConnected internet=false \n07-30 17:31:54.597 W/SettingsValues(9314): Cannot load auto correction threshold setting. currentAutoCorrectionSetting: 0, autoCorrectionThresholdValues: [, 0.185, 0.067, 0]\n07-30 17:31:54.867 I/Choreographer(9314): Skipped 36 frames!

That looks like it fixed that problem!\n(as an aside, all my blue checkmarks went away again, and after I had restored most of them by adding in the Clipboard category.  What did you add in this interim release that would cause that?)\n. Here's a little extra on the lost app checkmarks.  In your \"hotfix\" build, the new Notifications category seems to have been added but, of course, unrestricted by default.  However, that category seems to be required for an app to show the blue checkmark now.  This includes apps that have no C2D functionality.  Moreover, it appears that selecting the All function from the menu filters all available functions, whether used by the app or not (though this may be by design, I have not been following that closely...).  An upshot though, is that the menu now shows the selection items for filtering by Account and by Contact, even if the app doesn't use those permissions.  Does this sound correct?\n. Confirmed.  In the hotfix build you supplied, all non-dangerous permissions are required in order to get a checkmark beside an app.  Turning off permission filtering and deselecting even a permission the app doesn't use will remove the checkmark from the app.  Now that can't be right, can it?!\n. (http://www.opencellids.org/en/download/)\nUnless you work for the cellular industry in Dordrecht, I'm not sure how you will be able to determine if this is \"reliable\" enough.  However, the complete database is free to download, there's an open API to pragmatically interact with it and, if you just want to visualize it, someone's already knocked together something on sourceforge:\n(http://sourceforge.net/projects/ociviz/).\nBTW, I did download the database and look through it.  I was originally just going to post an extract with your cell towers but it appears that Dordrecht has quite a few of them...:>)  Enjoy!\n. OK, I have made some progress in better characterizing this issue.  It appears that the upgrade process doesn't result in a \"proper\" boot loop but, instead, the tablet simply takes 2-3 times as long to boot.  The short version of what I did is as follows:\n1. I attempted the same upgrade (1.8.3 -> 1.8.7) after a fresh boot and got the same result (I force rebooted after being stuck on the boot screen \"too long\").\n2. I performed the same reset procedure outlined above except that I didn't import my settings.  I then repeated the upgrade process and got a successful boot in the normal timeframe for this device.\n3. Just to further nail things down, I then imported my settings and rebooted.  After it looked like the same \"hung boot\" results, I started to write this post.  It took long enough that, when I glanced back at my device, I noticed that it did in fact eventually boot to the home/lock screen (I then had to re-compose this post...:>).  It did take significantly longer than normal, though.\n4.  From there, I performed a standard upgrade to 1.8.10.  Interestingly, the reboot time for that upgrade seemed pretty normal.\nSince this is an easily reproducible issue (on my device), I am more than happy to go a few more rounds if you would like me to gather some specific data for you.  Otherwise, the underlying issue seems far less serious than I originally outlined and I am content to just move on.  Let me know your thoughts!\nI think the squarely point to a problem in my settings (and/or possibly some room for improved error-checking imported settings within XPrivacy).  Regardless, based on the changes made in XPrivacy btwn 1.8.3 and 1.8.7, can you suggest some settings (i.e. apps and/or hooks...) I could look into to determine what is causing the problem?  Thanks in advance!\n. No problem, I'll getting that logcat for you (probably post to pastebin...).\nIn the meantime, is there a more \"device independent\" way of delaying the activation of Android usage logging?  I was thinking maybe listening for a BOOT_COMPLETED signal would be not only \"appropriate\" but also inherently tailored to each device based on it's hardware specs and bootup workload.  Would something along those lines work for XPrivacy?\n. (http://pastebin.com/1LQu9vry)\nHere's the logcat you requested, albeit with a caveat.  Since I normally run ADBSecure on my devices, which presents several obstacles to capturing a logcat during bootup, I disabled it to capture this one for you.  However, booting after the upgrade and without ADBSecure seems like it took less time than I expected, although I admittedly wasn't paying very close attention to it.  I did review the logcat and there are several XPrivacy errors early on relating to the system not yet being ready that may have a bearing on my issue.  Let me know if you see anything interesting enough to warrant further testing on my part.\n. (http://pastebin.com/gcaT8BKs)\nI just finished a test involving upgrading from 1.8.3->1.8.12test you referenced above.  I had my full set of XPrivacy settings installed prior to the upgrade and I left ADBSecure on during the boot, just to keep things as \"normal\" as possible.  What I can say is that you definitely fixed the startup delay with this version!  In reviewing the logcat though, I did notice three (3) errors thrown by XPrivacy early on which I have included in the referenced logcat extract.  The rest of the logcat (it's large...) looks very uneventful with an occasional Warning thrown by XPrivacy much later in the boot cycle but it didn't look like anything serious.\nLet me know what you think and if you would like any add'l testing in support of this issue.  Otherwise, I note that it has been \"closed\"...:>)\n. I've started noticing this, also.  What would be most useful to help debug (i.e. list of apps, logcats, etc.)?\n. I just did a fresh boot with your test release and tested it with several apps.  I couldn't find an app that didn't get logged.  This is over a time span of just a few seconds btwn launching the app and switching over to XPrivacy to check.  I mention this because, previously, it didn't seem like XP was missing data as much as it was taking sometimes minutes for it to show up.  Great job at investigating and finding a solution to this issue!\n. Well, further testing shows some apps not getting logged.  Let me do a proper test tomorrow afternoon complete with a logcat for you.\n. All right, just finished up a round of testing, as follows:\nDevice: Galaxy Nexus (maguro)\nOS: Android 4.3 (JWR66Y)\nXposed Framework: 2.4beta2\nXPrivacy: 1.10.33\nProcedures\n\nFreshly booted after updating XPrivacy but before having enabled \"extra usage data\"\nOpened XPrivacy, allowed it to initialize and then switched over to the Android Home screen\nOpened up App drawer, and started launching apps, allowing each to initialize and then switching back to the Android Home screen using the Back button.\nAfter launching around 1 \"page\" of apps (around 10-12), pulled up Android multi-tasking stack, removed all recently opened apps and finished by switching to XPrivacy using its remaining entry in the stack.\nI then noted which apps had orange triangles indicating data access.  I viewed a few of them to confirm the time of the most recent accesses corresponded to my testing.\nUsing this process, after about 10 minutes (approx 20 apps), I started noting the most recent apps were not getting logged.  This matches my previous \"informal\" testing using XP build 1.10.32 (test).\n\nAt this point, I enabled \"extra usage data\" in Xprivacy, set up to capture a new logcat and then rebooted my device.  Once the device settled down from booting, I again launched XPrivacy and noted that the usage data from the previous testing session was still indicated by orange triangles beside the related apps. So, picking up with the next available app, I continued with the procedures outlined above.  In this session however, which lasted almost 30 minutes and involved almost 100 apps, I could not find a single one that did not get logged by XPrivacy.  While this is certainly a favorable result, I have to imagine that it somehow results from enabling the \"extra usage data\" rather than specific apps not getting logged, as has been inferred in this issue so far.\nAs I mentioned, I have collected logcats from both of these sessions and they are, as you would expect, each quite large.  While I am more than happy to provide them to you \"wholesale,\" I am also certainly willing to extract pertinent clips from any of them if you can describe what you would find useful.  Please let me know!\n. Still more documentation changes!  Looking forward to a stable release...:>)\n. Confirmed on my device, too.  Nice find!\n. I actually included that behavior in the documentation.  Looks like I'll have to change that now!\n. Hmmm, I probably would have done the same.  Thanks for the heads-up...I will include a warning.\n. +1 to displaying a summary of what permissions will be applied.  This display would have an option to cancel the operation.\n. Let me ask this question as someone who does not develop in Java and is not familiar with the really deep bowels of the Android security model.\nUnder XP's current architecture, is usage data recording an app asking permission to do something (i.e. Mom, can I go outside?), just testing their boundaries  (i.e. checking if the door is unlocked) or actually attempting to do something (i.e. trying to open the door)?\nIn my opinion, the first is just bordering on annoying, the second is cause for concern and the third is very serious, indeed.\n. I see...and I take it that either XPosed and/or XPrivacy don't allow you to monitor an app more closely (i.e. what it actually does rather than what it asks permission to do)?\n. Hmmm, let me ask this then?  Under the current model, if XPrivacy tells an app \"No\" or, perhaps more commonly, tells an app all about the Tooth Fairy, Easter Bunny, etc, that app isn't able to sneak around us or \"Google\" the real info, is it?\nIf it's not, then I not sure there's a strong enough need to ensure the usage data is more \"accurate.\". If apps are able to go around XP, that's certainly more serious.\n. Aha, now that is a very good \"threat\" to understand.  However, at some point, there's only so much XP can do to protect a user from themselves.\nWith each app, a user needs to make the decision about what info they are willing to make available.  If the app is coded to not function in the absence of that info, the prudent choice might be to contact the developer of the app.\nHowever, we all know people who run anti-virus software (because they know they're supposed to...) but click allow at every prompt of whether some program should be allowed to run.  Quite frankly, such a user would be better off not running XPrivacy and probably shouldn't even be rooting their phone.\nIn the case of a \"poorly behaved app\" such as you describe, the correct choice would almost certainly be to uninstall the app...:>)\n. I completely agree!\n. I'm almost certain that he is referring to the Google Play Services update recently pushed out by Google.\nHowever, provided it was already recognized by XP, the template shouldn't have modified it's restrictions during the update.\n. Oh, yes...an even better point!  I wonder if it got restricted anyhow...such as by pulling the crowd-sourced restrictions.  Are system apps even in there?\n. I disagree.  Having a published \"backdoor\" to disable any security-related feature/tool will always invite abuse.  When installing software that is clearly billed as \"test/experimental\", the time honored practice of making a backup is just common sense.  People shouldn't be installing such releases while shopping, at the beach, etc.\nI, for one, will not be installing any releases of XPrivacy that have published (and that includes in the source code...) method of disabling it.\n. I'm still not a fan of it, in principle, but that is a better compromise.  I need not remind you that people will inevitably have bootloops even with stable releases of XP.  It might not be caused by XP but people will still find something to blame it on.\n. I haven't tried an import since the migration to the new database.  Since the export/import would still involve writing/parsing XML files, do you anticipate either operation taking a significant amount of time?\nFor the export, the concern would be if the \"silent\" export was interrupted by a shutdown/restart, which was triggered shortly after the user made a TiBkp and expecting to be able to restore from it, if needed.\nFor the import, and I'll admit this was back in the XP 1.11.x days, I've had imports take over 30 minutes to complete on slower devices.  This could be a concern if a user did a restore expecting certain XP settings but it took a significant amount of time for XP to \"catch up.\"\nJust the initial thoughts off the top of my head!\n. Agreed...breaking the currently monolithic database into function-specific ones could greatly aid backing them up.\n. While I haven't reviewed how Marcel has implemented his caching architecture, I wonder if breaking the database up would provide an opportunity to better optimize it.\nI imagine the usage data is mostly writing and the settings/restrictions are mostly reads. Any thoughts?\n. Sorry, nevermind.  I just read through the changelog and figured out how it works.  I'll add this to the docs.\n. Any reason to hard code the value at all?  If you can allow the user to specify the randomization range/value, why not allow them to specify the base.  The default base value can be 686m.  No matter what you choose it's going to be sub-optimal/inappropriate for some user(s).\n. While it's more a philosophical question at this point, might I ask why?  I understand that coding in user-settable preferences takes extra time but that most \"enthusiast\" users enjoy the extra flexibility.\nIs this simply one of the ways you limit your \"up-front\" investment in implementing a new feature or more an insistence on \"clean\" GUI appearance (including the settings screen)?\n. Would you please indicate the commit that implements this request, as you usually do for many/most issues?\n. Doesn't this commit just inform the user of an incompatible app?  Regardless of the logical flow that begins with detecting an incompatible app and ends with disabling XPrivacy, I was looking for something a bit more \"general purpose\".  The basic idea was that, if XPrivacy were shut down somehow (regardless of whether you currently understand what the cause would be...), that the XPrivacy app and perhaps more preferably the service, would warn the user so that they could take appropriate action.\nIf you feel that such a request needs a separate issue, I can do that.\n. If that is how it works then that is good enough. I didn't see that very clearly in the commit you referenced but I'm not very fluent in Java, either.\n. While principle is sound, if the goal is to capture more than one boot, make sure that you use the append operator \">>\" instead of just the redirect operator \">\".\n. As usual, I completely agree!\n. Well, you certainly don't need me to confirm how \"onboard\" I am with this idea...:>). Thank you for giving the idea your consideration.\n. Perhaps I'm behind a few too many versions of XP but it isn't vividly clear what the implementation would look like to the user based on the descriptions presented.  Jpeg's were the clearest in terms of presentation but perhaps we both are unclear where/how such a choice would be triggered.\nAny effort to \"hand-hold\" the slow-witted would be greatly appreciated!\n. That sounds perfect to me!\n. Hmmm, thanks for looking into this.  Fortunately, I have two more devices that I perform a similar update on. While it won't be the exact same data involved in each case, I will at least perform these updates while capturing logcats on my pc.  If the problem is repeatable, hopefully I can give you some better info to work with.\n. I assume you're referring to the need to handle migrations and such?  For normal operation though, does the \"system\" group require access to the XP app data folder? \nSince migrations are obviously a very important function, I do realize that the question is quite \"academic\" at this point.\n. Per your request, I just completed some rushed testing before heading out this morning.  I can follow-up later today.\nUsing TiBkup, I set XP to not display usage data then rebooted and allowed the device to settle.  Upon starting TiBkup, it took ~5 seconds to indicate \"760 elements\" and then ~30 more seconds until displaying \"all elements loaded.\"\nSetting XP to \"display usage data\" and using the same procedure, it took ~70 seconds to display \"760 elements\" and an add'l 230 seconds until displaying \"all elements loaded\"\nWhile this a significant impact, it may just be on initial load of an app.  While additional testing is needed, indications are that after this data has been loaded/cached by XP, subsequent fresh starts of TiBkup take drastically less time than what is referenced above.\n. Sorry, I forgot to mention that I updated to 1.99.52 prior to the testing.\n. As requested, please see the linked logcats.  \nhttp://pastebin.com/M0dKNBBM (Part 1 of 2)\nhttp://pastebin.com/e6bNm6M0 (Part 2 of 2)\nI cut the logcat right right about at the start of TiBkup.  In reviewing them, it appears that the most interesting parts are in the second half (sorry for the length...) where the XP logs of access to storage are taking ~1000ms each, give or take.  BTW, I thought it also odd the countless accesses to MCC/MNC, most of which were cached but I wonder if it might be affecting TiBkup, since they are restricted.  Also, the other very noisy app you will see in the logcat is Watchdog and it's constantly accessing /proc, as mentioned in my original XDA post.\nNo rush on this from my point of view...just trying to make people aware of the issue (if any).  Like you, I have a Nexus 5 that probably won't even be phased by this sort of thing!  That reminds me, these logcats were captured on a Nexus 7 (grouper) running stock Android 4.4.2 with v33 of Franco's kernel.\n. I mentioned what device was used in the previous post.  As to it having a weak CPU, that it's entirely possible in the context of running the current build of Android with XPrivacy.\nPerhaps info like this could be used to provide more detailed guidance in the Minimum System Requirements section of the FAQ.\n. In the interest of posterity, I did a bit of research on this issue based on the logcats provided.  The following thread provides a very nice background and analysis of the problem with references to specific devices and specific versions of Android and it's kernel:\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2540108\nThe short version is that the device I tested uses device encryption. FSTRIM is not supported for encrypted partitions on that specific device in the current version of Android.  Basically, the IO performance is slowing down over time and the extra burden placed on it by per-call logging pushes the issue \"over the edge\" to where it's very noticeable.\n. I will be able to test the new build in about 5 hrs.  I'm looking fwd to seeing how splitting the database up by function (something jpeg725 and I hypothesized about a while ago...) will affect my specific issue.  I might update an additional device (Galaxy Nexus, maguro) to the current build to see what it looks like there.\n. OK, I have the results from some testing conducted this evening.  I updated both my Galaxy Nexus (maguro, stock Android 4.3, stock kernel) and my Nexus7 (grouper, stock Android 4.4.2, franco r33 kernel) to XPrivacy 1.99.53.  In both cases, the upgrade was uneventful and a review of both the actual database files on the filesystem and the associated restrictions and usage data all appeared normal.\nAs far as performance was concerned, the Galaxy Nexus is still a very capable performer and runs very smoothly with XP set up in a normal configuration with per-call usage data recorded.  On the other hand, the Nexus7 still shows numerous signs of lagging in various operations, although it is somewhat inconsistent.  Without a serious effort to monitor the device in order to better understand what is going on \"under the hood\", any given operation may perform either entirely fine or may lag for a matter of 10s of seconds.\nPrevious logcats on the Nexus7 have shown ANRs for various applications, including XPrivacy, with a \"contribution breakout\" showing IOwait as high as 85%.  To better understand this, I downloaded Androbench (an Android storage-specific benchmark app) and ran several tests.  For the SQLite tests, the Nexus7 showed performance of only 0.5 TPS (transactions per second) whether XPrivacy was enabled or not.  Obviously, such an underlying performance penalty would have obvious consequences for the performance of XPrivacy and therefor of the overall system, especially when per-call logging is enabled in XPrivacy.\nBy comparison, the Galaxy Nexus and Nexus5 devices have SQLite performance metrics that more than an order of magnitude larger.  The Galaxy Nexus, which also has an encrypted data partition and no FSTRIM support (dm-crypt v1.08), nevertheless scored 18-22 TPS, depending on the SQLite metric being tested.  The Nexus5, also encrypted but having full FSTRIM support, scored from 40-65 TPS, again, depending on the SQLite metric.\nI believe all this testing points to the underlying reason this issue was initially posted as a degradation of the flash memory storage subsystem, which is entirely understandable given the research referenced above and the fact that this device is a primary \"testing\" device, having performed near-countless operations on it's storage subsystem since being encrypted.  The obvious solution to this problem is to perform a full backup and factory reset the device, which will wipe the /data partition and remove the encryption.  The next decision would be whether to proceed with re-enabling the encryption prior to restoring the backup data.  Ideally, an Android kernel could be located/built that includes the more modern version of dm-crypt referenced above that provides FSTRIM support for an encrypted Nexus7 (2012, grouper) device.\n. I have the same issue but, while it happens every boot, it only affects one of my devices (Nexus7 grouper).  I am assuming that the cause is simply a lack of resources (esp memory) during the boot process and that very little can be done from XPrivacy, even though I believe that it's running within the System process.  The ANR is happening on the System process itself and, while XPrivacy might be contributing to the problem, there's simply a lot to do during the boot process and XPrivacy needs to be initialized in order to be able to effectively restrict all the processes and apps that get started at that time.\nRecently, I have been working with the App Settings, Boot Manager and ReceiverStop modules  for XPosed to reduce the system load during boot but I have not yet found a solution that prevents your issue from occurring.  Again though, it only happens on one (admittedly older) device.\n. +1\nWhile I'm pretty open to some of the implementation details, a feature along these lines would greatly assist those finally getting into Restrict-On-Demand.\n. +1\n. Feedback: It works fine.  (Tested on 2012 Nexus 7 and Galaxy Nexus)\n. While apparently not a bug, I think that an0n981 is trying to say that is an \"error in implementation\", which I tend to agree with.\n. [Edited]Retracted post since it wasn't very accurate/good.  Will think about the issue a bit more before posting...\n. Thanks for adding this, Marcel!  While the ACTIVE intent is nice to have available, I think that an0n981's comments highlight that this new one will be more generally useful.  That said, I haven't been using the ACTIVE intent so my workflows aren't well established.  I know exactly how I will be using this new intent once it's available!\n. @M66B If you have a moment, could you please outline a basic (i.e. example) workflow that uses (both?) of these intents as you designed?  Thanks in advance!\n. Ah, very true...I'll check out the discussion there\n. Just to briefly chime in on this issue...\nWhile I have been able to confirm the behavior described in both apps mentioned in this thread (Network Info II and HE's Network Tools), I have also confirmed that XPrivacy is logging a correctly formatted MAC address to those apps (i.e. 6 pairs of hex chars).  However, since both apps do display correctly formatted MAC addresses when \"getHardwareAddress\" isn't restricted, it seems \"non-intuitive\" (I'm being deliberately kind here...) to say that the problem isn't caused by XPrivacy.\nSince you are more familiar with the code than I am, would you confirm that the data being passed through the actual interface to the application (as opposed to what is displayed in the logcat info...) is correctly formatted according to the Android API specification?  To say that both of these highly regarded apps share a similar bug (that is core to their basic functionality) really make you come across as \"unreasonable\" and I doubt you what that.\n. Although I like this idea and see how it's a natural extension to XPrivacy, there are a number of ways you can accomplish this already.  Since you already have XPosed installed, let me suggest that you look into defim's UnbelovedHosts module.  While XPrivacy already works very well on a per-application basis, Marcel doesn't have as much time as he used to to devlope or extend the XPrivacy feature-set.\n. I installed your test build on my GNex testing device running a custom ROM that holds as close to possible to AOSP (5.0.2).  When booting with SELinux in permissive, XPosed crashes during boot throwing the same error you posted on XDA and I posted on Github. Interesting that it seems to fail under AOSP LP but \"work\" under CM 12.  I have a CM 12 build available for my device that I will try next. Stay tuned. \n. Interesting!  Xposed (w/ XPrivacy installed and active..) does \"boot\" under CM12 on my device, at least under SELinux permissive.  I am able to launch the XPrivacy app with no errors being displayed.  Marcel, if you can tell me what you would like in terms of diagnostics, I'd be more than happy to provide them to you.  I'm assuming a full logcat with XPrivacy in debug mode, etc but please let me know so I don't miss something important or provide more than you need/want.  I'm going to look around and see if I can boot it under enforcing to see if there are any issues there.\n. Oh...well then nevermind!  We'll just wait on rovo then.\n. There is an easier way to recover from bootloops caused by either Xposed or one if it's modules. During boot, hold down one of the volume buttons until your phone vibrates. At that time, press that same button 4 more times quickly (you only have a few seconds window...). After the last button press,  you will feel a longer vibration, which indicates that XPosed has been disabled. While I am not a fan of this from a security standpoint, it is much easier than renaming the XPosed files, which I have also done in the past. \n. For the benefit of others, could you please describe a specific \"use-case\" (i.e. specific app and functionality...) where the current version of XPrivacy does not meet your needs.  You clearly described what you want but, given the significant amount of time/effort required to add this capability, it would help to understand how much value the XPrivacy user community would gain from it.  If nothing else, it might help the more creative XPrivacy users help you find a successful \"workaround\" in case your desired functionality cannot be added.  Thanks in advance!\n. Aha, I see...thanks for the very clear explanation!  Until Marcel chimes in with his thoughts, I would not hesitate to post a summary of this issue (linking back here for specifics) in the XDA forum thread.  There are a few very clever users who might suggest some missing elements that could help you accomplish your goal without requiring add'l development.\n. Hmmm, thanks for the feedback and clarification on how sensor data is handled. I will do add'l testing to better understand any negative affects on battery life that XPrivacy might be causing. \n. I'm not familiar with the details of the OP's issue but isn't it true that a crash/freeze of a device that results in corruption of XPrivacy;s database would, upon eventually restarting the device, result in all restrictions being automatically removed?  I seem to recall that this was the policy in the past but I am not aware if that has changed since then.\n. Fortunately, I agree that it is a very rare occurrence (I've only experienced it once, myself).  If a user wanted to periodically backup their XPrivacy settings, to protect against any such a corruption, I can think of a couple of options currently available to them:\n1. For XPrivacy Pro users, you could periodically \"export\" your XPrivacy settings and import them again upon learning of an XPrivacy database reset.  This has worked well for me in the past and it's a part of my current backup strategy for my Android devices.\n2. For a less convenient option, a user could manually backup / restore the XPrivacy database from a custom recovery environment, which would include a stable copy of said database, assuming the the system performed a normal shutdown.\nAny thoughts on either of these options?\n. From what I can see, if an app doesn't register the \"sdcard\" storage function, then the Storage category for that app will not have a green permissions key beside it.  This will be the case even if all other functions within the Storage category are registered by the app and have green keys displayed besides them.\n. Given that XPrivacy is intended for all users expert and novice alike, could you provide some guidance (either here or in the FAQ) as to what a user should understand when they see a green key beside a function Category in XPrivacy.  Understanding that the \"filter by permission\" is functioning correctly, should they simply ignore how the categories themselves are displayed (with or without a key...) and always expand to the individual functions to understand what an app is needing?\n. Given the recent discussions on category restrictions vs regular/dangerous function restrictions and what novice vs expert users should focus on, this guidance makes sense... thanks! \n. I just confirmed the issue on my device.  It's true that a screenshot won't highlight the issue (the screen stutter) the OP refers to.  If the usage data fills the full screen or more on the device, when an item is long-pressed, the text-selection bar that appears at the top of the display (containing the Copy and Select All items) appears and disappears almost instantly, which causes the display to stutter as it shifts down and up.  If the usage data for an app fills less than the display height, the text selection bar appears at the top of the display normally.\n. To assist in determining as issue in Android, this behavior is confirmed in both 5.1.1 and 4.4.4.\n. ",
    "GhostlyCrowd": "I can confirm that Facebook does not respect the boot restriction on a Samsung Galaxy S3 touchwiz rom. Facebook Messenger is also still firing up GPS even with location restrictions. \n. Is this because it cannot be done or because you do not have time to fix this? I would be willing to help any way possible to keep this feature. it seems to work on apps like WhatsApp but fails on others like Facebook. It would be a valuable feature.  Not infuriated, but i did donate $6 bux because i was encouraged by the features of Xprivacy. I understand this was a donation and i am entitled to nothing, but the Market users may see it differently since the setting of purchases in the market give users a sense of entitlement. Just throwing that out there. \n. I never said it wasn't, And I'm sure it has been many hours. You still did not answer my question however. Aside from the fact that it does not necessarily have something to do with privacy, although it really does. Why is it being removed. Is it impossible to fix or do you not have the time to do so?\nHere is an example. I have Facebook booting with my device, i don't mind it using my location, my call logs accessing my contacts or my other personal data, but i want it to do it on MY terms, there fore i decide to stop it from auto running on boot so it can only have access to my data when i say it can, upon manually activating the application.  This is a valid scenario for some apps and some users, and would be considered a setting for privacy. \nThere fore I believe this feature should stay if its feasible to fix the issues. If other start up managing apps can do it, open sourced ones. It may be possible for you to take a look at how they do it.\nJust my opinion.\n. never mind i lost the expert mode check box i had set previously. SORRY!\n. Does the xposed framework report as installed properly? and have you enabled it in the xposed framework as per the installation instructions.\n. Aside from the fact that it does not necessarily have something to do with privacy, although it really does. Why is it being removed. Is it impossible to fix or do you not have the time to do so?\nHere is an example. I have Facebook booting with my device, i don't mind it using my location, my call logs accessing my contacts or my other personal data, but i want it to do it on MY terms, there fore i decide to stop it from auto running on boot so it can only have access to my data when i say it can, upon manually activating the application.

If other start up managing apps can do it, open sourced ones. It may be possible for you to take a look at how they do it.\nJust my opinion.\n. This is an acceptable alternative. Thank you!\n. ill take what i can get on this, the fast toggle all perms is acceptable, not and nice as having the app not boot and not even be in memory but at least the fast toggle lets me achieve what i'd like to do with some apps. only letting use legitimate private data when i want them to. \n. These apps come with no guarantee. Either keeping the boot blocking or changing it to a fast toggle, wither one cannot be guaranteed.  Especially since the android api changes and it breaks things. For example, Facebook currently fails to respect the boot blocking xprivacy deploys, whatsapp does not ignore xprivacys blocking. \nAll in all i can understand the dev removing it and focusing on more important issues, like the gapps service leaking private data still.\n. fair enough.  just as long as xprivacys provided default is different per user. otherwise i have concerns that some apps that track phone number or something of the source could cause cross contamination across devices. \nFor example, a app that uses the users phone number to restore previous downloads on install may start restoring a massive pool of downloads since 50+ devices have been tracked on the same \"spoofed\" number.\n. I see you have reworked how the location works. Are we still aiming for an interactive Gmap so the user can choose locations based on the map. I still would like this. \n. lol if i could code i would contribute it for sure.  The features you have included thus far are usable and nice, but using the Gmap would be a more flexible option for users who have a specific location in mind. Especially if you dont know street addresses or the specific name off hand. The purpose of the map in my mind was to enable the user to choose a location with out having to search for it via a web browser, or know the specifics off hand. and not to have to type them in either.  Again, what you have implemented works great. The step further would be the Gmaps availability. \n. i can try and help im not to handy with programming but i know my way around compiling and testing lol\n. ok i shot you a email via your website, i purchased a pro key via your donation link a few days ago and i just went to the market and purchased your pro enabler as well so i can test both ways for you. \n. Missing the screen shot, please upload it.\n. you could do a logcat, which will provide the exact same info any log xprivacy could include.\nIMO this feature would be using dev time that is better used elsewhere.  \nit is easy to grep a logcat to find info you need.\n. To be fair, with the 50 or so free logcat apps on the app store. There is bound to be one that is simple enough for even the most novice user. \n. Just to add tto the above. Any user who can follow the process to root their own device, install xposed framework and then install xprivacy, should be fully capable to take the extra 5 minutes to learn a logging app of their choice with relative ease. Further more xprivacy logging wouldn't offer any new information a logcat wouldn't. And lastly just trouble shooting an app that you have limited the perms on by checking and changing what you have limited would be faster in most cases then referencing a log. \n. Interestingly enough Google services doesn't have to have location disables for me to spoof its GPS. However thas about the only app it spoofs on that I have tested. Other apps that use location like GPS status and network info2 either don't spoof or in network info 2's case some times spoofs by when it does it says its gathering its location from the network not  the true GPS.\n. I understand your explanation. But I don't understand why I absolutely had anything that touched GPS showing the spoofed location I set back on version .43 and now its hit or miss. I'm currently downloading more apps to test and will be doing a hard reset. \n. I've reflashed the xposed framework and fix and I'll retest. It looks like weather bug is now spoofing since I have. Chalk this up to my stock ROM being a moneys ass. I need to install cm or something.\n. Yes i have a Stock Samsung phone with the multi-window feature. \n. Alright, Didn't know if it was something in xprivacy, since it explicitly blamed it on it. \n. I can confirm this, although when i spoke to M66B, he stated that it may be a rom issue, as it was not ongoing for him. \n. well some apps require some form of mac address id imagine, and de:fa:.... would be valid mac address characters\n. i believe this was changed because it was causing fc's with some apps with empty values. M66B will have to chime in. \n. I have flashed the xposed fix, i know for a fact its working because spoofing gps on gmaps does not work with out it. \n. ok ill grab it\n. SSID leak is fixed. The issue with location in network info II is still there, its not grabbing my spoofed location like it used to.  Still did not fix the issue of network info saying location was unavailable. \nSO then i decided to give network info all perms back. everything in it got proper info BUT location info. so then i uninstalled network info II. reinstalled. STILL could not get the spoofed location to work. then i exported my xprivacy data, wiped xprivacys cache and data. rebooted re-imported xprivacy's settings checked that network info II  worked and it did and now location was proper. so then i went into xprivacy limited the perms on network info II the exact same way i had before when location was not working. and BAM its picking up my spoofed location now. \nI have no idea what going on. i tried to grep for xprivacy touching network info when it was all buggered up but i gave it all perms back, and didn't see a single thing. \n. sure ill email them\n. email has been sent\n. I tested it as well that's what my above report was based on that you asked for my settings XML from\n. Device: Samsung SGH-I747M\nROM:  CM nightly updated daily. \nAndroid Version: 4.2.2\nxposed Version: 2.1.4\nxposed Fix Version: 4.2\n. Yep, here is my update process \nI download the nightly, back up my apps with titanium just in case.\nInstall the Rom and reboot.\nInstall xposed with the installer and reboot to recovery.\nInstall the xposed fix V4.2 and reboot\nBoot into CM fully, then reboot one last time to make sure exposed has a chance to load all modules with the new fix.\nUse CM\n. Are you able to enable debugging on a special build for us who are having issues with apps after we give permissions back and either have to reinstall the app and/or clear xprivacys data?\nAnother user who reported the ingress issues is having the exact same issues where when he gives perms back something is still not right and he had ot uninstall and reinstall. Which is the same scenario we/i has with all in one tool box and network info II something must be happening that is not logging. \n. So even though xprivacy is hooking to getLastKnownLocation  its not intercepting them. Can you fix this some how?\n. In regards to issue #278 that has been categorized as a dupe of this issue \nI dont actually have country code mcc and mnc leaking in Network Info II on my device. it is defaced or spoofed properly. I just still have the weird location issue with it. \n\nsomething funny is afoot \n. @ M66B The weird location issue is the fact that xprivacy will spoof the location data in Network Info II only once, after that it always shows as \"Not Available\"\nIt used to actually work. \nit used to report\nfor example\nprovider: network\nlocation: spoofed location\nFix time: however long it took to gather the spoofed location\nAH i have figured it out, If i  have google services location spoofed. Network info II is unable to use spoofed location. If i dont spoof google services and just spoof network info II it does get the spoofed location, instead of \"Not available\"\nWhats happening here? even if i  have GS spoofed and network info uses it for location. it should report the spoofed location since google services should be seeing the spoofed location.  \nEdit: just went back and rechecked all of GS's location check boxes to block location again, and network info II still works what the hell is going on here?????\nEdit2: and then i reboot and Network Info II reports \"not available\" for all location stuff again.\nI think it must be using Google services., since i  have google services spoofed it SHOULD be reporting the spoofed location, but instead its malfunctioning? \n. Try blocking Google play services location see what happens. \nI just verified that with google play services location \"spoofed\" with xprivacy Network info II gets \"Not avalable\" as my location instead of reporting the spoofed location like i want it to. With google services not location spoofed, Network Info II gets my spoofed location properly.\nThe reason why i was loosing it on reboot was because the spoofing of location on google play services became active on reboot, since i didnt force close it before.\n. ok so can we block apps/hook on to them so they dont prod google play services for location? and instead use our preferred spoofed/blocked data in xprivacy\n. or at the very least have google play services report our spoofed data to the app. right now it doesnt seem to be respecting its restriction by xprivacy and is returning correct data or no data at all in my case for network info II\n. @treare, yes my exact same issue if i block GS, then apps that use it for location return nothing. GS is not respecting the blocking/spoofing of location.\n. @m66b, the weird thing about it now is, if i spoof location in network info II and not GS, then the location in network info II shows the correct spoofed location, \"i spoofed it to a town 30 minutes away\"\nIf i spoof location on network info II and GS's then network info II returns \"not available\" \nweird eh\n. we're all testing on version 1.7 correct? letsm ake sure we're on the same version \n. @M66B I've noticed that if you block location on GS, then reboot. do a full reboot thats when i get the location \"weirdness\"  where it reports as not available in network info II thats how i reproduce it every time. \nI just tried clearing the data and force closing GS with the location blocked and same result. \"Not available\" in network info II\nJust as a fyi.\nThe real weird part is, if i dont spoof location on GS network info II shows my spoofed location.\n. @M66B \nAh, well why isnt GS returing the spoofed location since thats what its fed ?\n. If the gps icon is not shown then it means wechat must be probing something else besides the actual gps hardware for location. maybe GS or something.  that icon only shows up when something probes the actual hardware so ive been told.\n. @M66B Alright, installed 1.7.1, drilled down \"Connect\" and now when i launch Network Info II it sees my spoofed location even with GS location spoofed.looks like you have solved the leak in this aspect. I will test whats app now with the others. As well as Flight Radar.\n. @treare Whatsapp is in fact seeing my gps location as spoofed, it just doesn't auto move the map to that location instead it is sitting on the default map area that whats app has in San Fransisco but if i zoom out i can see my blue gps marker and when i zoom in its indeed my spoofed location. Flight radar is also showing my proper spoofed location. i have Connect drilled down on both these apps as well as the rest of the location stuff\ngood stuff! @M66B\n. Been happening since 1.5 for me as well.\n. alright thanks for looking into it.\n. No i dont get any incompatible warnings. \n. I dont have the shell restricted though, thats the thing. I started by restricting everything with the all button, then tested. then i removed the shell restriction because Network info II showed nothing at all with it restricted.\nSo i FC'd network info II, cleared its data, modified the blocked settings xprivacy so shell and internet are not blocked. (nothing red/dangerous blocked) rebooted and that log was from a fresh reboot and loading network info 2. there is something wrong with xprivacy letting go its clocked perms if   you're saying the log reports that the shell is blocked. \nThis is the second app in 2 days i have been able to have xprivacy some how hang on to blocking permissions that i chose to unlock. The other was \"All in one toolbox\" and the only thing i can find in the log is warnings. So i'm kinda stumped. \nhere is a paste of the log grepping xprivacy, \nthis is what the log shows while the location is still malfunctioning and now showing anything in network info II it is not shwoing my spoofed location at all\nhttp://pastebin.com/1FiKMnpL\nhere is a screen shot clearly showing my setting in xprivacy. i have force closed network info II, cleaned all its data and rebooted and this malfunction still happens almost all the time. \n\n. The first time i ever used your app the first thing i did was spoof my location to Easter Island, and use network info ii to check it. it worked well. so im not sure whats happened between about version .40 to now. \nI will get you those logs shortly.\nNetwork info shows my defaced ip's and mac addresses as well fine. \n. Sent you a log via email, i also forgot to answer your question, i dont get any \"incompatible\" warnings. \n. i play ingress every day, it works fine.  Ingress would crash if i did anything but walk in the map on my stock Telus S3 rom. so id blame the rom first. \n. I am having the exact same issues with some apps malfunctioning when giving perms back. the dev is looking into it. i just send a bunch of logs and my settings today.\n. I dont actually have country code mcc and mnc leaking in Network Info II on my device. it is defaced or spoofed properly. I just still have the weird location issue with it. \n\nsomething funny is afoot \n. Try clearing your cache partition\n. Maybe change xprivacy to use a sql database. and export the data base as such.\nMay solve the memory errors and if you locate the database in /data like pdroid it will keep nosy and malicious apps out of it. \n. Doesnt just about every messaging app use SQL for its database?  android includes sql as well as default. and 2.3+ allow the use of the WAL sql database system. It would probably improve the performance alot if this can be done. \nCan you explain more why it would not be corss-device compatible? I dont understand why it wouldn't considering my above statements. As for putting it in /data your app will need rood access. but every one who uses exposed framework has to have root anyways. so no issues there. \n. well, you can address it the same way other devs do could you not? You could even include your own version of sql binary. alot of backup apps and tweaking apps do this already.\n. Fair enough. But If this goes un solved, the inability to import ones settings is going to detour some users and pro users. \nI don't have the issue \"yet\" \nBut keep in the back of your mind that this issue is fixable with my suggestion of moving to a sql database, and eventually people will expect it to be.  I would make this \"low prio\", not \"will not fix\" in my opinion.\nAnd again just to mention it would probably improve performance, which i know you have been aiming for.\n. Also the answer to this stack overflow question hits the nail on the head for the issues your having\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/5213550/raw-resources-versus-sqlite-database/5213569#5213569\neasier and faster to retrieve sort and filter data and it has none of the limitations you are getting with SAX or the previous xml parser. \nAs xprivacy grows so will the things its filtering, sorting and what not. I still suggest you consider this. \nAs devices become more powerful it will not be uncommon for a user to have 300-600 apps. So what then?\nif users are having issues importing settings for 200-300 apps now. thi9nk about the future. \n. Here is something i have been able to replicate with xprivacy as well. \nI wanted to filter all my apps, including system. I know this breaks android and you boot loop but the purpose to check \"All\" was so i could then sort and unchecked what i needed to unblock. much faster this way.\nSo check \"All\" xprivacy will get an out of memory error and fail to check anything. Check \"All\" again it will check everything and then xprivacy starts to freeze and lock up. Android asks if you wish to wait for xprivacy and you can, or some times it just blatantly crashes. \nI am running cm with about 213 apps including system.\nUsing the all option just kills xprivacy performance.  even with SAX\n. then how is the database kept of what you have checked i thought it was all xml?  The app keeps a list of your settings i assumed if it wasn't sql it was xml since thats what import and xport use\n. thanks for the clarification, i assumed the fc and freezing was all related to the xml issue. which is why i have not bothered to report it.\n. I see that in shared_prefs all the apps settings are still xml, they are not affected then by the import xport xml memory issue?\nI dunno then, i was hoping switching to sql would increase the performance as well as fix the import export for the users. \n. Understood.\n. You've probably said before but whats your devices specs for ram and storage. also \nadb shell \"cat /system/build.prop | grep heap\"\nsee what your heaps are.\nMay help give M66B a better idea of your memory circumstances.\n. do this\nadb shell \"setprop dalvik.vm.heapsize 256m\" \ndont reboot and try seeing if you can make xprivacy run out of memory.\nmy heap is 512mb but i have 2gb of ram. 128 seems low. \n. i edited it so make sure u refresh my commands were incorrect\n. also adb shell \"setprop dalvik.vm.heapgrowthlimit 128m\" \n. I ended up uninstalling version 1.7.8 after wiping its data.  And its working again. I really didn't want to start over with my settings but Privacy actually locked up my device when it was acting funny.  I had to pull the battery since it was frozen while scanning apps. Not sure what happened I was not at a PC to log it. I'm going to try and make it lock up today. All my issues seemed to start after installing greenify.\n. Greenify tells you what app has launched or woken Facebook from sleep if you have the pro version> its dead on accurate as well. I can force close Facebook, verify it is not running. Open the chive, and Greenify tells me that the chive has opened Facebook in the Greenify hibernation manager. \n. here is a log of the chive and of facebook when the chive is loaded.\nhttp://pastebin.com/ndViQkHV\nEven if the app cant see it its still being launched and that's a possible leak of private data. is their any way to block the intent. \n. Again back to the users who dont mind Facebook using their data but on their own terms. Then its launched in the background and running for however long, checking in possibly reporting location when they do not wish it it. Or the possibility of the app that launched the sleeping or non-running app doing something in the background with with Facebook for example. \nWhy would the Chive launch Facebook if its doing nothing with it at all... In this case its to share a picture, but my point still stands. if the ability to block intents from apps to launch others is possible it could/would be useful for privacy in some circumstances. \n. I dont think you're understanding my point. People deploy methods to STOP Facebook from running in the background, like Greenify, or a startup manager. So for me it never runs unless i  click on it in the app try, opr when an app launches it.\nNow blocking intents to start an app from with in another app is out of the scope of the boot managers or greenify (hibernation app), since its more of a privacy thing. Which is why I brought it to your attention.  Also, Xprivacy is probably the only app out there that is capably of intercepting an intent to launch anyways. \n. Ifi t can be done, im sure users will appreciate it a lot. Throw me a bone here. I have to have Facebook installed because my girlfriend is obsessed with messaging me on it.  But id rather not have it start when apps call it because I think facebook is a privacy risk in general. All the news articles about then leaking information and tracking your position for GPS targeted advertisement. Left a sour taste in my mouth. \n. More info. This only seems to happen on apps you have restrictions set on already then use the fetch function. But the get function returns no new check boxed (probably none submitted) then if you touch any check box all boxes become unchecked.\n. Awesome, thanks.\n. thank you\n. Just wanted to chime in that i am also getting this message. I have had it twice now on boot. and then cannot reproduce it consistently. \n. Well i dont use gtalk, or hideouts.  I do however use that module to make sure my apps still update if i mod them. \n. My mistake i dont use gapps crash fix. I was mistaken. So this probably doesn't have anything to do with the issue. \n. I can try to reproduce this on my cm 10.2 I have not tried per app settings.\nAm i to assume that in the per app settings checking the box means that app is using custom settings you input in the field you checked off? I skimmed the wiki the day .16 came out but didn't see anything explaining how it works. Maybe i'm kinda slow but i'm not 100% on how its supposed to work.  Do the check boxes just mean that app uses the global settings or do they mean its toggled ot per app mode and you can set something that differs from the global setting and the app will use it. or do the boxes mean if checked they use the global settings. \n. It sure does, thanks sir.\n. Seems to have fixed it. It is working for me. check boxes remain.\n. For what its worth, i am on PAC rom on my Galaxy S3 running 4.0.33 Google framework and everything seems to be fine. \n. Google search version 3.1.8.914827.arm\n. firstly what version of xprivacy are you using. also have you checked the usage on the app to see what xprivacy is blocking and what is not being blocked. \n. use the xprivacy installer located here to update to the latest xprivacy first of all https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=biz.bokhorst.xprivacy.installer if you have the latest version of the xposed installer you can use that as well. the latest stable is 1.10. the latest test is 1.10.18 do this first and review the usage to be sure it is in fact blocking everything you ask it to. if not come back and post.\nalso in the usage log what is it asking for that does not have a blocked icon by it?\n. I cannot get it to spoof the advertising id either. i'm on PAC 4.3\n. I'll see what i can do about a log tomorrow. got busy today.\nOn Thu, Nov 21, 2013 at 11:45 PM, Marcel Bokhorst\nnotifications@github.comwrote:\n\nWithout a logcat there is little I can do.\nIt works for me and others.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/issues/802#issuecomment-29048671\n.\n.

Sorry, to spam the topic. Just as an idea: Probably if you intercept DNS queries and return error while resolving address then most applications should give up to connect.\n. I'm ready to experiment by myself. I've download source code and it compiles fine. The only problem - i don't know how to trow exception to original application. InetAddress functions trigger exception if host name cannot be resolved. So, i need simulate this exception to original application. \nI cannot find info about it in XProsed forums/google.. :(\n. Ok, it looks like working :)\n1) I've added hooks to 2 classes (see below). NetworkInterface is not used by these apps, but i think it should be hooked in case of usage by other applications. Probably, there are other functions exist for checking connections. Need to use and see. Actually, need to block functions for socket/port opening for completeness.\n2) I've removed \"inet\" permission from \"Internet\" group. I think, it should be moved to other group, because many applications with INTERNET permission will crash with this option marked. So, to simplify group marking it's better to not include \"inet\" into \"Internet\" group. \nNow both RR3 and Youtube start fine and cannot see any connections! :)\nWith RR3 while starting i see some short activity of connection, but i think it's called from native code and cannot be blocked.\n@M66B, thanks for help offering.

If there is connection, then it may have some real IP address:\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/java/net/InetAddress.html#getLocalHost%28%29\nThus, some applications can use it for connection detection.\n\"Why do you hook getByInetAddress, getByName and getNetworkInterfaces?\"\nBecause applications not always detect connection by \"isConnected\", but trying to blindly connect first. \n. about revoking permissions:\n```\n.method public isFeintServerReachable()Z\n    .locals 5\n.prologue\nconst/4 v2, 0x1\n\n.line 1173\nconst-string v3, \"android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\"\n\ninvoke-virtual {p0}, Lcom/openfeint/internal/OpenFeintInternal;->getContext()Landroid/content/Context;\n\nmove-result-object v4\n\ninvoke-static {v3, v4}, Lcom/openfeint/internal/Util;->noPermission(Ljava/lang/String;Landroid/content/Context;)Z\n\nmove-result v3\n\nif-eqz v3, :cond_1\n\n.line 1178\n:cond_0\n:goto_0\nreturn v2\n\n.line 1176\n:cond_1\ninvoke-virtual {p0}, Lcom/openfeint/internal/OpenFeintInternal;->getContext()Landroid/content/Context;\n\nmove-result-object v3\n\nconst-string v4, \"connectivity\"\n\ninvoke-virtual {v3, v4}, Landroid/content/Context;->getSystemService(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/Object;\n\nmove-result-object v1\n\ncheck-cast v1, Landroid/net/ConnectivityManager;\n\n.line 1177\n.local v1, conMan:Landroid/net/ConnectivityManager;\ninvoke-virtual {v1}, Landroid/net/ConnectivityManager;->getActiveNetworkInfo()Landroid/net/NetworkInfo;\n\nmove-result-object v0\n\n.line 1178\n.local v0, activeNetwork:Landroid/net/NetworkInfo;\nif-eqz v0, :cond_2\n\ninvoke-virtual {v0}, Landroid/net/NetworkInfo;->isConnected()Z\n\nmove-result v3\n\nif-nez v3, :cond_0\n\n:cond_2\nconst/4 v2, 0x0\n\ngoto :goto_0\n\n.end method\n```\nAs you see, if you revoke this permission, then application automatically assume there is network connection (but hidden)..\nSo, it's not a good idea to revoke any NETWORK/INTERNET permissions.\n. \"Internet restricting will probably not work if an application uses IP addresses instead of domain names.\"\nI've checked java socket functions - they require InetAddress as address. So, either by name or by IP address, application has to go through acquiring InetAddress through already blocked functions.\nIn your code, if there is connection then getLocalHost will return exception (because it won't equal to loopback address) - i think it's unexpected (although valid) return of this function. SDK states, it should return loopback address in case of no connection. not exception.\nAlthough, SDK said that typically android device will return loopback even if connected.. Well..

It's good to block reception of ConnectivityManager.CONNECTIVITY_ACTION as well, but i don't know how.\n. I didn't setup my repository online yet. Actually, i'm not very familiar with git.. So, forgive me ;) I will setup my repository later.\n. i didn't understand this:\njava\nhook(new XNetworkInterface(net, PrivacyManager.cNetwork, new String[] { \"ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\" }),\n                    \"java.net.NetworkInterface\");\nI don't understand the role of specifying permission. Some functions of this interface marked as required permission (in SDK), some - not. So, will this hook work for all specified functions or not? Is it mandatory to specify the permission?\n. Well, i know how to use git locally. I just never pushed back :)\nby the way, please don't split internet access functions to different categories (like DNS and others). From regular user view, it will be to complicated. I, personally, would like to tick one mark to block all internet functions than 2 separate for DNS, Internet.\nI know, about background data, but it won't be bad to explicitly tell to application about it ;)\n. No need to hook getLocalHost. Let it go alone.\nOk, please stop to update internet blocking code.. I will fork your project, will modify and ask for pull request. Then you can review it and go further. Ok?\n. Ok. i will try my best\n. FastXmlSerializer and .gitignore - that's up to you :)\n. Ok. Then may be implement import/export? \nLet's say this scenario:\n- when setting is written, then it being saved with UID and package name at the same time. \n- while reading in low level, read only UID\n- in setting dialog add button \"Restore UIDs\". So, after restore backup user will just need to click this button to restore all UIDs according to package name. Actually, XPrivacy can autoupdate UID while it scans the apps. It shouldn't be longer than scan itself.\n. ah.. i didn't notice because my version isn't pro.\nStill saving with both UID and package name would be handy in case when you made batch backup somewhere in Go Backup and forgot to export XPrivacy settings manually\n. May be simple dialog settings of categories will be used in XPrivacy should be fine (if dynamic hook/unhook not possible). Other categories will be hidden from XPrivacy interface and won't be hooked.\nBut ultimate solution would be to not hook categories not selected for application. So, if nothing selected for application, XPosed won't touch it at all.\n. ",

Thanks for @vipere, \nI tested @M66B , the Device ID is generated by GoogleServicesFramework.apk: By removing GoogleServicesFramework.apk then Device ID gone, when reinstall GoogleServicesFramework.apk then new Device ID generated.\n. @GhostlyCrowd \n\nyou could do a logcat, which will provide the exact same info any log xprivacy could include.\nit is easy to grep a logcat to find info you need.\n\nUsing logcat is the way for devs, not easy for everyone :)\n\nIMO this feature would be using dev time that is better used elsewhere. \n\nOf course, log is off by default, and this feature better designed for per-app, looks like the SuperSU's log.\n. @GhostlyCrowd :)\n\nTo be fair, with the 50 or so free logcat apps on the app store. There is bound to be one that is simple enough for even the most novice user. \n\nYou can find only a few people using logcat apps from app store, and other android users even don't know what\u2018s logcat, not to mention how to read logs generated by logcat. Just as i said above: Using logcat is the way for devs, not easy for everyone.\n. @M66B \n\nReading the system log requires super user permissions, so this is not an option for XPrivacy.\n\nXPrivacy is based on Xposed Framework which requires root access to install, which mean XPrivacy can only run on root devices, XPrivacy should not be limit to no-root.\n\nActually there is already a kind of logging: the usage data.\nElse I see no other useful logs, except the system log.\n\nFor now the usage data shows after it used, and there\u2018re no detailed descriptions about the usage data in expert mode.\n. > Just to add tto the above. Any user who can follow the process to root their own device, install xposed framework and then install xprivacy, should be fully capable to take the extra 5 minutes to learn a logging app of their choice with relative ease. Further more xprivacy logging wouldn't offer any new information a logcat wouldn't.\nEasy installing app, but hard using. XPrivacy is only used easily by few people who has experience with logcat. Android system and apps are complex enough for common users, please do not add more! XPrivacy could be a great app if improved the user experience.\n\nAnd lastly just trouble shooting an app that you have limited the perms on by checking and changing what you have limited would be faster in most cases then referencing a log. \n\nDid you even try this? Changing XPrivacy settings needs time to take effect and needs restart(completely kill app's progress) the app. Generally one app at least has used 5 different types of the usage data, you need try 5 times when out of luck. And every app's trouble shooting need to do that. \n\nIf XPrivacy is developed for advanced users, the features XPrivacy has are enough. But If want XPrivacy more esay to use and more popular, then app's log system will be badly in need of.\nIn my opinion, when enable app log system, simply logs like this:\nAppName request Account(getAccounts) Icon(green, mean pass)\nAppName request Identification(getString) Icon(red, mean fail)\n...\nMore features:\nXPrivacy has ability to restart app (root)\nLog system base on per-app\nClick the log will jump to the app\u2018s setting menu\nAnd more ...\n. > This is already there, look for the orange triangles:\n\n...\nIf you mean popups: this is not possible, because XPrivacy works on a too deep level for that.\n\nBecause the orange triangles have no timestamp, so it's hard to debug which restriction affect app\u2018s function.\nFor example, sometime a newly installed app by everything restricted will result FC or some function not working, so i have to turn off the restriction which affect app\u2018s function. \nBut which ones? By the simplest way, you can just turn off all restrictions of the orange triangles, but there is also no privacy any more. By the hardest way, you need try to turn off the restrictions one by one till find out the one affect app\u2018s function.\n. @M66B \n\nEnable expert mode and drill down the category and you will have time stamps.\n\nThat's time stamp? I don't know it until you told me. \nOK, I found this:\n\nVersion 0.27\n...\nDisplay time of last usage (application restriction details)\n...\n\nThanks for your patience, and @GhostlyCrowd \n. @fenghn888 \n\n\u201c\u52fe\u9009\u4ee5\u9650\u5236\u201d\u672c\u6765\u5bf9\u7684\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u6539\u9519\u4e86\u3002\n\n\u6211\u672c\u6765\u4e5f\u8fd9\u4e48\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u754c\u9762\u65b9\u6846\u6253\u52fe\u540e\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u662f\u663e\u793a\u5df2\u9650\u5236\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5c31\u6539\u6210\u8fd9\u6837\u4e86\u3002\n\n\u53e6\u5916\uff0ctranslatable=\"false\" \u7684\u90a3\u51e0\u884c\u662f\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u7684\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u6545\u610f\u5220\u6389\u7684\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u4e0e res / values / strings.xml \u4fdd\u6301\u5de5\u6574\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u5e76\u65b9\u4fbf\u4ee5\u540e\u7ef4\u62a4 :)\n. @M66B \nJust explained the questions from @fenghn888 :)\n. Same as  Issue #178\n. I found the reson why got an empty list.\n. It happened when you restricted the app\u2018s System (installed apps) in XPrivacy\u2019s menu. The more app button belongs to system app, so try to remove the restriction in expert mode.\n. It's very hard to find out unchecked boxes during hundreds of apps.\n. Is there any way to develop a custom filter with checked, unchecked and all (checked+unchecked) to replace the CheckBox. The Titanium Backup has very useful filters.\n. > The usage data is meant to hunt for problems, even if you don't know which app is causing it.\nI know.\nBut in many cases, we are hunting the known app's problems like FC, loss of function, etc.\nYou can add a menu to switch between all usage and some app's usage if want to see all usage.\n. @M66B \nI don't understand what you mean. I need reinstall 1.7.17?\n. > You mean the refresh menu is not working?\nYes. \n. > Looking into it ...\nSorry for my poor english.\n. This can be misleading. I think here should be better if like this:\nOnly showing restricted(blocked) usage by default, and if with \"all\" will show all usage.\nAnother suggestion is moving menu \"all\" to UI button for better experience.\n. @M66B \nI know It\u2018s a toggle.\nBut the menu \"all\" only show restricted(blocked) usage, this can be misleading.\n. It might have something to do with Google Play's market links, because you can use Titanium Backup remove/restore them.\n. Sorry.\nI test my two phones at hand, huawei and lg.

OpenCellID is one of largest worldwide cellid databases, but it only covers few of celltower information in my country, because it needs people installing their app to collect data. It may reliable to some people, but certainly not to me. OpenCellID is open source database, but many others are not, like the most popular chat app in my country:\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tencent.mm\nMM uses cellid to locate people and collect cellid data.\nI also find a website to locate using LAC/CID:\nhttp://www.cellid.cn/\nIt reliable to people like me, but certainly not to others.\n. > IMHO there is no reliable database and this feature will not benefit the majority of the users, so I will not add it.\nI don't know why you insist that need \"reliable\" database. IMHO it's nothing to do with this feature. It's your app and you can do what you want.\nBTW:\nEverytime i request a new feature, i have to do my best to convince you, like \"log system\". I'm tired of this game.\n. Great works for the three-states checkbox, :+1: \nI\u2018m looking forward to test it.\nPlease look into the issue https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/issues/263 (list unchecked boxes)\n. @tonymanou \nHow about changing Filter on restricted to Filter by restrict state (three-states) just like Filter by application type?\n. @tonymanou @M66B \nI'm testing with 1.9.8 now.\nBug or not?\nApplications with only dangerous restricted are not be counted as 3th-state.\n. @M66B \nFor example, I only restricted Autostarts's Internet, and on the app list shows Autostarts unchecked.\n\n\n. All internet restricted.\n. @M66B \nThis bug occurs randomly, how to get the log?\n. Does Android log lost after reboot?\n. Finally, i got the log, but it included reboot log (adb connecting all the time):\nhttp://pastebin.com/0YA4qKy3\n. Another log:\nhttp://pastebin.com/7xZmY0E9\nIt looks like device crashed and got soft-reboot.\n. 3th log:\nhttp://pastebin.com/wCRm24D1\n. My device has 2G ram and 1.2G free, why out of memory?\nI'll try without XPrivacy.\n. @M66B \nAfter testing couple hours without XPrivacy, no freeze or reboot occured, i\u2018m pretty sure it\u2019s XPrivacy\u2018s bug.\n. I'll get more log file as soon as possible. The log file include timestamps.\nDevice is running with stock rom and android version is 4.1.2.\n. I found possible cause of the issue, maybe related to cpu usage, i used SetCPU to set my cpu on low level.\n. Maybe some setting in SetCPU causes conflictions with XPrivacy,  I'm still testing all kinds of cases.\n. @M66B \nAnTuTu CPU Master causes conflictions with XPrivacy in my device too.\n. XPrivacy v1.8.5 and earlier version works well,  after that all cause conflictions.\nThe changelog \"Always lock fallback restriction loading\" from 1.8.6 maybe the reason\uff1f\n. @tonymanou \nThanks for the fix.\nCould you look into this https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/pull/586#issuecomment-23316042 ?\n. @tonymanou \nI mean another improvment :)\n\nHow about changing 'Filter on restricted' to 'Filter by restrict state' (three-states) just like 'Filter by application type'?\n. @tonymanou \nWhat\u2018s difference between full-ticked and all ticked?\n. @tonymanou \nI see, looking forward to that :)\n. \n",
    "miraxi": "Hello M66B,\nThank you very much for the quick reply and above all for the awesome XPrivacy.\nAnother observation I made is that Google play identifies a device using the GSF ID (as opposed to Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID, cf. http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1860405). If I am right, XPrivacy does not offer a possibility to restrict the GSF ID (I am not sure whether this is related to https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/issues/134).\nDo you have any plans to restrict the GSF ID as well?\nRegards,\nmiraxi\n.

    "vanowm": "Can you create a new branch or something for us to test it for you?\nCurrently that huge \"X\" button kind of out of place..in fact it's confusing, at first I thought it was to dismiss the message, not clear settings for this app.\nThank you.\n. I just noticed that in v1.9.27 the two finger swipe down opens up the X icon = awesome\nHowever the clear icon is hidden by default only on \"old\" XPrivacy notifications. The latest XPrivacy notification have clear icon shown by default.\n\nNot a big deal at all just thought it should be hidden by default.\n. This issue affects many apps that open different section of itself from outside. It's not directly a bug in XPrivacy I think. However I believe there must be a way create a work around. Kaiten mail for example when opened shows messages, and back hardware button switches to account list. Although it's actually undesired, because I'd expect it be closed when I hit back hardware button, and if I want go to account list I'd use the left arrow on top.\nAnyhow, perhaps instead of relay on these history \"stacks\" or whatever they called when using arrow on top left corner it should open directly \"activity\" aka list of apps obviously clearing up the history stack so back hardware button would close the XPrivacy when list of apps is opened instead of going back to app's settings.\nBut back hardware button should not be changed and work as it works now: regardless how XPrivacy was opened if user didn't navigate into different section it should close the app, not go back to list screen.\n. The issue remains unchanged...Opening XPrivacy from notification (after app installed/updated) will close it by pressing hardware back button or left arrow on top.\n. I'm using stock rom on Samsung Galaxy Note 2\n. Updated to the latest 1.9.25 (164). Rebooted the phone after update.\nAlso using built-in quick task switch (holding home button), switched to XPrivacy (it previously was opened from notification bar), tapped on up navigation (left arrow on top-left corner) and it closed XPrivacy.\nP.S.\nIt's JB 4.1.2\n. After couple of test it seems to work great.\n@tonymanou it works fine for me, make sure you tap on app icon and not it's name.\nOne side effect though:\nback navigation is forcing reloading the app list, with over 300 apps installed it takes about 3-5 sec to load.\nCaching and/or background reload would be nice.\n. 1.9.27 broke it...now \"up navigation\" doesn't have arrow left (only XPrivacy icon shows) and tapping on that icon instead of going back to main list it closes XPrivacy.\n. The issue is not completely fixed:\n1) assuming 2 or more XP notifications shown for updated/new apps\n2) open XP from notification for app1\n3) it opens settings for app1. Good\n4) launch the app from XP\n5) open XP from notification for app2\n6) it opens settings for app1 again\n. 4.3 on Galaxy Note 3 (N900T)\nIt seems the step 4 messes things up.\nAlso it affects #681\nI don't know how the history stack (or whatever it called) works on Android, but perhaps it could be done that back button would open parent screen. And regardless of how XP was opened and what screen/menu is current, hitting back button would open parent screen and never exit XP unless apps list is the current screen. So when XP was opened from notification hitting back button would not close it, but open apps list, hitting it second time would close XP.\nHopefully it doable.\nThank you.\n. Not getting a single data for 500 Firepaper using default settings. In fact with each update XPrivacy become less and less usable due to this issue...\nAny good reason why we have to change something in settings in order to make it work? aka, why shouldn't these settings be activated by default?\n[EDIT] guess #786 is the reason[/EDIT]\nPerhaps there is a way to troubleshoot this kind of issues by activating some kind of debug mode that would show toast when something was blocked? like it used to show when android.intent.actiona.VIEW is blocked.\n. > Exports are backups and need to be complete.\nAny chances for reconsideration? Would be nice be able export only specific apps, especially if you want to share it with someone.\n. Strange, I set filter and it shows 1 app, then do export and it exports every app, including system.\nMaybe I do something wrong?\n\n. Oh, see. Thanks.\nNot very straight-forward (especially when import doesn't require anything like this), but it's better then nothing.\n. I guess I'm just spoiled with Titanium Backup, where every actions are only applied to apps visible in the list (or at least there is a button to select only visible apps before the action)...\nMy point is (slightly off topic), when you hit export menu item, it shows list of apps that will be exported (which is not the same as what one most probably would expect to see) and you have to hit OK button to start export, unless there was some kind additional control for that list, such as ability select apps, that extra step is pretty much redundant, why not just start exporting automatically?\nDuring import there is this extra step because of \"clear\" checkmark, export has nothing that would require this extra step.\n. What about storing it on SD card instead of Internal storage on phones with dual storage?\n. Well then it's a bug and not a feature request with a low priority, because system apps got their permissions changed when I did fetch for non-system apps (or so I thought...)\n. I cleared all permissions, made sure both user and system apps are cleared, switched to user apps view and selected fetch permissions from menu. The result:\n\nEither I'm doing something wrong or it's a bug?\n. Then I looked at the line you showed and it's clearly a bug because the statement is true if app not system OR data not empty. It should be \"AND\"\n. Is there a way to change (spoof) path for SD card for each app? If so, perhaps mounting /storage/sdcard_blah/ that points to /storage/sdcard/myfolder/ would be doable?\n. Ops...but the question wasn't actually answered, I think...\njpeg729 explained how XP currently denies access to SD card, but not if android allows changing what each app see. There are so many different possible locations of SD cards on different phones, and apps work fine regardless. This suggests that apps \"ask\" system for the location, in which case in theory it can be spoofed with sacrifice of lots of virtual folders in /mount/ ...\n. I'm using the latest version (checking daily).\nPerhaps altering permissions somehow affects it?\nMy only reasoning thinking this cased by XPrivacy is because it's the only app that affects in anyway other apps. I could be wrong of course.\n. I see.\nDo you kill all processes before the reboot?\nPerhaps there is a way invoke a power menu, like by simulating power button press?\nThis is offtopic, but perhaps to fix the mess as per screenshot, XP should disable ondemand after update and block by default until rebooted?\n. I usually check for updates in xposed every day, so it's pretty much from latest version. But it doesn't seem to be relevant. As long as XP opened right after update and then reboot attempted from notification.\n. Sorry, but what does \"restrict dangerous\" has anything to do with on-demand settings?\n. I think we are not understanding each other.\nSee, I set in the template to enable on-demand, regardless how dangerous this is or not, it should be applied when I use that template, at least this is how I expect it as a user, right?. Otherwise what's the point having a template which is being ignored when used? Perhaps a friendly warning would suffice instead of simply ignoring user's settings.\nIf you believe the on-demand is dangerous (for whatever reason) then perhaps it should not be in the template settings until \"restrict dangerous\" is enabled, or perhaps the \"on-demand\" global settings should not exist at all or be at least under \"expert\" instead and not enabled by default?\nAnd finally, whats the point of ability exporting settings when you can't fully import them?\n. Ok, the default automatic \"all allowed\" for already installed apps is understandable, makes sense, it's fine. It should avoid any issues after user installed xprivacy, cool.\nNow, what do a user do to enable on-demand for all/some existing apps? - open each app individually and set it manually there?\nWhat about import settings that they exported before installing this rom? should it work? - yes, but it doesn't either for on-demand settings.\nMy understanding of \"dangerous\" permissions is they should not be restrict by default, fine, but I fail to see any kind of connection between \"dangerous\" and on-demain for non-\"dangerous\"-only permissions...\n. Ok, I see your point now. Batch on-demand could be a bad thing.\nMaybe template settings should have a little note about this, aka on-demain will only be applied to apps that already have on-demand activated? As a user I see a setting and expecting it's being used when applying template ;)\nAnd I just learned that the backup file I was importing doesn't import the on-demand per app settings at all, however the backup file from my other phone imports on-demand settings just fine. I'm not sure what XP version I had when did export settings on this phone, so perhaps it wasn't up-to date.\n. A share button next to close button would annoy people?\n. Thank you.\nI thought that XP needs to be started after installation so it would auto start after reboot. Evidently there is more to it then that :)\n. Can this be \"fixed\" by not showing the on demand popup when volume keys are pressed?\n. I do have gdrive installed. I even tried to export to it again and import, but dropbox opens over top of the services list (I can see a glimps of that window after dropbox closes)\nBesides, even if nothing other then dropbox installed, there still should be a selection to chose sd card or such, but there no such selection accessible.\n. Ok, so the services selection shown during export are not supposed to be shown at all because none of these services are installed? Is this what you are saying?\nWell that's how I read your reply after saying that I get a freaking services selection during export but not during import, instead it opens dropbox...\nI'm sorry for the attitude, but it seems every single topic I ever started here so far gets closed right the way (as in \"not an issue\"), then, sometimes, reopened after insisting on the issue. Are you a lawyer by any chance?\n. Would the list of sharing services that shown during export be a good enough evidence that such services exist on the phone? I'm pretty sure that's is a pretty good evidence, unless there is a bug in export that shows list of non-existing services.\nNow, assuming that export feature works fine in this regard, then the fact that import doesn't show ANY sharing services, would you still insist that it's not an issue?\nWould you be so kind to test it, please?\nThank you.\n. The problem is that dropbox gets selected by itself.\n. But nothing you've said so far explains why it shows the list during export!\n. ",

Samsung Galaxy SIII (GT-I9300), Vanilla rootbox nightly 4.2.2, Fix 4.2\nSony Ericsson Xperia Z (C6603 Yuga), Pacman 4.2.2, Fix 4.2\n. i gave whatsapp another try. blocked nothing except for location. for a second it uses the fake location (2 seconds or so) and then goes to my actual location.\nEDIT: i killed whatsapp after this test, didn't touch anything in xprivacy and waited for a minute. strangely enough NO fake location anymore but instantly the actual location\n. Hi,\nFirst of all: let me know if the info i post is not helpfull. i don't wanna spam.\ni played with wechat again. i disabled blockings in location one by one untill the app could find my real location. If i block location functions again it keeps on finding my real location. (i waited long enough for the caching thing)\n. it doesn't need getlastknownlocation it seems\n. whatsapp knows my location to the exact street number (while blocked ofcourse). can this be done by external IP?\n. tried another app. flight radar. i blocked everything except for internet (also the dangerous ones, /proc etc etc etc). also this app is perfectly able to find my location. (even after a reboot, clearing data and clearing cache etc)!\n. EUREKA!\ni was able to spoof location for whatsapp and flightradar! ixcept for blocking location for these apps i also blocked location AND network for google services!!! please try and confirm.\nBUT:\n- wechat was still not working in this way.\n- what is the hardest thing that can happen with spoofing location and network for GS? a banned google account? I once had an error when i was roaming. so i guess being on the other side of the world in 5 minutes wont look ok to them :(\n. wierd thing with wechat:\nbefore i told you:\n-if location not blocked it finds correct location.\n-if location blocked it finds nothing.\nnow... i blocked GS location and network but not in wechat. it again finds nothing. so also here GS is involved i think\n. @GhostlyCrowd: well, what you wrote is what i did, and it did work for me it seems. but not for wechat. flightradar and whatsapp need GS and the location shown was indeed the one i entered in xprivacy settings.\n. 1.7\n. @M66B: do i need to give up on wechat after reading your answer to GhostlyCrowd?\n. if an app uses GS  network/location:\ncan it be that users blocks \"something\" for this app so that it cannot ask GS for the location?\n. Thanks. Still i have doubts about what i wrote earlier. I think wechat has nothing much to do with GS after all. What bothers me most is that wechat is the only app that only triggers the gps icon when its location is not blocked. All other apps ive tried, i think 5 or 6, get the gps icon, blocked or not. Even whatsapp and flightradarOp 21:18, 17 juli 2013, schreef Marcel Bokhorst:@treare Already working on that ;-)\n\u2014Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Well... you told me that before but thats exactly the problem with wechat. If i block location and i enter location feature in wechat the icon is not shown. In other apps if i block location and ask for the location the icon is shown like you say (but location is spoofed ofcourse)Op 21:29, 17 juli 2013, schreef Marcel Bokhorst:XPrivacy doesn't block the GPS, it only spoof the location or returns an empty location.\nSo the GPS icon will appear as normal.\n\u2014Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. @GhostlyCrowd: i tested with GS which makes no difference. But as said before: the icon is there if i dont block location. Its not there if location is blocked. Wechat is the only app that doesnt turn on the icon when location is blocked.Op 21:42, 17 juli 2013, schreef GhostlyCrowd:If the gps icon is not shown then it means wechat must be probing something else besides the actual gps hardware for location. maybe GS or something.  that icon only shows up when something probes the actual hardware so ive been told.\n\u2014Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Installed 1.7.1 like you described and tested it with flightradar. Afterwards with whatsapp. GS has nothing blocked. The 2 apps could find my correct location. I think \"connect\" doesnt work.Op 21:55, 17 juli 2013, schreef Marcel Bokhorst:Reboot is still required to make it work ...\n\u2014Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Ok wiped whatsapp completely. I have set moscow as location. Whatsapp thinks im somewhere in san fransisco now. Flightradar stayed thesame. It finds my coorect location. Everything blocked for flightradar (also connect) except for internet. Some more tests in the morning.Op 22:07, 17 juli 2013, schreef Marcel Bokhorst:Whatsapp caches the location itself. Clearing data helps.\n\u2014Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Hi again,\nHere's what i did. This morning i wiped whatsapp's data. blocked everything in location and in netword adressess for whatsapp. connect ofcourse also. i did NOT block GS as i assume it cannot be reached by whatsapp. instead of using wifi at home i started driving. it finds my correct location. this could not have been cached.\nFlightradar: it uses google maps? i don't have that installed. also here:\n- a phone without sim connected to unknow wifi point\n- location and network address fully blocked including \"connect\", it finds my correct location\n- enable GS network and location blocking and wait for a while\n- FR shows the spoofed location (with connect still blocked for FR!!!)\n- remove blocking for GS and wait for a while\n- FR shows my correct location\nit's clear to me that \"connect\" does something but that it's not fully working or am i missing something?\nwith \"connect\" enabled for an app blocking GS from location/network should not be necessary, right?\nGhost wrote earlier: \"Alright, installed 1.7.1, drilled down \"Connect\" and now when i launch Network Info II it sees my spoofed location even with GS location spoofed.\"\nwhy spoof GS when connect is ticked? as i understand with connect for lets say, flightradar enabled, GS shouldnt be spoofed\n. I killed, wiped data, wipe cache, rebooted etc etc etc. Between all critical steps. Will read about google maps in the wiki again later on but im sure that i do it correct for flightradar as i am able to spoof its location. Only not with using \"connect\".Op 08:15, 18 juli 2013, schreef Marcel Bokhorst:Flight radar comes with the Google Maps library, meaning that it should be restricted as Google Maps (GS).\nDid you also kill WhatsApp after clearing data?\nTo be clear: if connect is ticked it should not be necessary to restrict GS.\n\u2014Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. arg... second time i lose a comment here.\nsorry for the unclear answers.\ni killed whatsapp, cleared data and cache and rebooted to be sure.\nfor flightradar: i know how to spoof it, thats not the problem, but not using \"connect\":\nif i tick \"connect\" for FR and do not spoof GS: FR DOES find my real location.\nif i untick \"connect\" for FR and spoof GS: FR does NOT find my real location.\nGS spoofing: network address and location + reboot after every change\n. made a titanium backup and cleared data. the problem ssems to be thesame. correct or no location\n. I tried that already before. also with giving services a fake location the problem stays thesame\n(checked maps while i did this. location was fake there)\nsorry for not mentioning this before\n. Hi again,\nWell, i cannot clear data as it needs internet to be able to log in. I disabled internet connection without clearing data, gave all location permissions back to the app and it was able to determine my exact location. also... when it has all location permissions the gps icon is shown. with blocked location the icon is not shown. i have 3 other apps with location blocked. the gps icon is always shown in these apps. Is that strange?\nBUT: maybe this is too time consuming and better to forget, not? \n. ok... so it is strange why the gps icon doesn't show up when location is blocked. lemme know if you need more tests\n. Hi,\nNo, i never saw that. I suppose you mean right after installing wechat?\n(btw... a while ago i asked in the thread if anyone could help me blocking location for whatsapp. i don't use it anymore but when i did i wasn't able to give it a fake location either) \n. I never done that. You know of a manual somewhere?\nI never saw a single error \"incompatible\" when opening XPrivacy. Not on GT-I9300, neither on Yuga.\n. i tried making a logcat for you but this is complete chinese for me. i cannot use that adb thing because i cannot install anything on pc (work). i'm sorry. is there anything else i can do to help?\n. thesame counts for whatsapp AFAIK\n. strange that it works different. better to leave out 'connect'?\n. so \"connect\" works but it will give you no location at all (instead of the spoofed location for GSF), correct?\n. ok, one last problem before closing this. the method that FR uses.... can it be blocked and what if more apps use this method?\n. i cannot get it to work using the normal method (everything under network address and location is blocked). But since this is closed i will not post about it anymore.\n. ooooh, np at all! it's only strange that you can spoof FR while i can't get it to work. but this is a developer site so let's concentrate on the other problems\n. one last message: what a hell! you are using the free flightradar right? i am using the pro version. i was able to spoof the free version, but not the pro. :(\nso wierd enough: FR free uses another way of getting it's location.\ndo i need to make a new issue for FR pro or better just forget?\nEDIT: forget it. also the free cannot be spoofed. first it goes to the fake location but after a couple of minutes it goes to the real location.\n. Im sorry. Still not allowed to install logcat and i didnt mention the app on purpose because its something used local and it is a payed app. I guess little info is better than no info.\n. I justed tested the new version. It seens location is still not working. I will try to make a logcat tonight\nEdit: this time i checked with marine traffic which also can be spoofed easily.\nEdit 2: if i kill marine traffic and set a new location in xprivacy marine traffic will goto the spoofed location for a few seconds. After that it goes to the real location.\n. euh.... it's NOT an illegal app. It's just an app of a local company (non-english). It's not the app's problem, as you can see M66B found a bug. I gave the name of another app that has thesame problem. Marine traffic worked fine with it's own location spoofed. It's a bug in xprivacy, nothing more. No settings are changed for the app nor was the app updated.\nEdit: an extra app name that cannot be spoofed anymore regarding location: facebook\n. All steps under location are blocked, so also connect and get scan results. for facebook, for marine traffic and for \"my\" app.\nEdit: not all were blocked. isproviderenabled wasn't blocked. if i block that one i get no location. so it's real location or no location.\n. thanks!\n. hi,\nOuch... ok. This was more important to me as the notification though but nothing to do about\n. Sure.\nMaybe we can vote? Or better not?\nIMHO: the testing of restriction can mean allot of switching between xPrivacy and the app. I never really use the notification.\n. The opposite would be nice too:\nXP draws something small over an app when there's something restricted for this app\n. OK, understood. Calling it backup was wrong by me. I mean it would have been nice to have exported settings for apps that i betatest without copying whole backups between devices.\n. There is nothing restricted for google drive (or any other google and/or system app)\n. Also... with an older version it works perfect and after updating XP the problem was there. Nothing else was changed\n. Already looked at usage data. No restriction. Also not in general usage. Can i make a backup, clear data and restore without losing anything?Op 31 januari 2014 13:17, schreef Marcel Bokhorst:Did you try clearing XPrivacy data?\nThis will tell if there is a restriction or a bug in XPrivacy is causing this.\nMy best guess it is a restriction.\nYou might look into the usage data to find out which one.\n\u2014Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. 99 percent its not the case.

Yeah, perhaps I should upload the screen at the first place...\n. OK, I'll take a look tomorrow.\n. Another pull request submitted.\n. Yeah, I thought so. Probably it's a bug in the game anyway.\n. But I disabled blocking for TextSecure in xprivacy and still wasn't able to send SMS. Disabling whole module solved the issue. Gathering debug logs...\n. Here is my log:\nhttps://gist.github.com/skibbipl/0526fa8801f1b0a88cfa\n. @M66B This is my conclusion too. But again - disabling xprivacy in xposed fixes the issue. So maybe xprivacy leads to null pointer exeptions in TextSecure.\n. I'm having very similar issue as @grrrrr No matter what, with enabled XPrivacy module in Xposed TextSecure is not working at all. No receiving or sending messages works.\nI'm wondering if this issue might be related to some google framework that was recently updated. As I know google moves more and more functionality to some to external apk's that can be updated via Goole Play without upgrading whole system. I'm using fully updated Nexus 5 with lates Kitkat 4.4.4 (ignored lollipop upgrade for now).\nAnd thanks @M66B and @moxie0 for keeping this issue investigated!\n.

I believe I have permanently cleared it by allowing YouTube>storage>getExternalStorageState and YouTube>system>getRunningAppProcess. I posted this information on the wiki.\n. OK, I've set that up. But the problem normally takes hours to develop. That means it will take a few days to be confident that it will not develop again with the new settings.\n. No problems for a couple of days, so apparently YouTube only needed YouTube>system>getRunningAppProcess. I updated this info on the wiki.\n. I preferred the colored icons because it makes their functionality stand out in the UI in a desirable way.\n. I'll test that at the next opportunity. I can't find a relevant app that has getScanResults restricted. Which app needs to have getScanResults unrestricted so that there's no issue with obtaining an ip address?\n. It looks good, thanks. Any chance of adding fetches-per-app to the first row?\n. In my case, Xprivacy reports loading 329 apps and then lists 249.\n. It's only a minor inconvenience. But if the user doesn't pay attention and just assumes XPrivacy is showing the new app, restrictions could get altered unintentionally. I've done that more than once. If the bug can't be fixed, maybe it would be better for XPrivacy's new app notification to take the user to the top of XPrivacy and display the progress percentage that shows all the apps loading so that the user can't be misled as to the context.\nI've also had XPrivacy FC a few times after pressing its new app notification and then switching apps via some non-stock methods. For example, GMD Gesture Control provides its own running tasks list. If I can find a reproducible pattern to the FC's, I'll post here.\n. After a couple of tests, the problem looks fixed. I haven't seen any side effects. I should mention I'm still seeing a second instance of XPrivacy in my popup task manager. I didn't mention it before because it's not the Android stock task manager. I don't know if it's relevant now.\nI did notice the border around the icons in the app list--looks good. Unfortunately, some apps' icons use up all the pixels so that the border isn't visible.\n. In my case, Play Store is crashing even though it's 100% unrestricted. By the way, it's only on my S4; no problem on my Note 2. You're saying there's no specific misbehavior except that Play Store is buggy, or can you suggest some further diagnostic?

OK, thanks for the info, otherwise I'd have no clue how serious the problem is. It only FC's when it's in the background, so my current workaround is to \"crystallize\" it with Android Tuner, which is similar to \"Greenify.\" But that means I have to manually check for app updates. Maybe I'll just wait for a new version of Play Store to roll out. It's nice that XPrivacy will notify when there's a \"secret\" update  to Play Store.\n. I uninstalled Play Store updates, which forced Play Store reinstall. Since then, Play Store hasn't spontaneously FC'ed even though I haven't needed to \"greenify\" it. I should mention, though, that every time XPrivacy is updated, Play Store FC's. This has been going on for months, but it's not really obtrusive since you have to reboot after updating XPrivacy anyway.\n. If I fetch and my fetch request is \"rejected\" due to an unsatisfactory confidence interval, it should default to leaving the restrictions as they were instead of clearing them. Clearing them is the same behavior as a high confidence fetch that fetches all cleared restrictions. So the current method is ambiguous, requiring the user who notices to do some bookkeeping to verify what happened.\n. ",

Well, I know, there is no discussing with you (its your app anyway).\nBut it is a small change and does help. Think about it: System apps do not (normally) change. So, after you have restricted these, there is mostly no need to display them. Just makes the list and the loading time longer.\nIf you do not like to many options, group them into subcatagories. That's what other apps do. Then the settings dialog can still be easy to read. It is indeed very long already, but that is because of the fake data settings. I would put them into a subcatogory (\"Adjust fake data\" or similar).\nSo the settings would then just be:\n- Adjust fake data\n- Filter by permission\n- Expert mode\n- Show system apps\nAnyway, that's my suggestion. :-)\n.

name=\"Method.10068.media.startRecording\" value=\"true\" /\nboolean name=\"Method.10068.system.queryIntentActivities\" value=\"false\" /\nall least single options that were set once should be removed when the \"all\" option is used\n. but an option \nboolean name=\"Method.10068.media.startRecording\" value=\"true\" /\nwill allways stay there until a user sets the option to false.\nimho the value of startRecording and every other user set value should be reset.(the line should be removed from the xml file) if \"all\" is used.  if that is an intended behavoir, a \"clear\" option inside the app details would be nice that sets the program to the default options and clears all user set options from the xml\n. at least values that are implicitly false like startRecording should never be in the xml file when the value is false, as this value is the same when the option is removed from the xml file\n. it is also weired that /proc is set to \"false\" when i restrict it for google play services but \"true\" for every other restricted app - i tried to find the code part that is doing this but i couldn't find it by now\n. why is this bug closed? resetting an app won't be supported?\n. the template is unchanged\n. but isn't most of the time somehow unaccurate?\n. would really be nice to have to possibility to at least remove udis from apps that are not installed anymore. i for example test some versions of an app like audio recording and take the best one in the end. i will never reinstall all this crappy apps i installed to find a good audio recording app. So the xml file messes up and in the end it maybe holds more \"dead\" uids than \"alive\" udis\n. http://pastebin.com/KuKKCAkv\nhere the stop happens:\nD/com.nll.asr.service.RecorderService( 3640): OutgoingCallReceiver

call\n. i didn't see this thanks for the link. but it would still be nice to add the possibility to not even inform the app about a specific event, as it seems this is allready happening with sensors events. because this is somehow still privacy related as the app can create in this case call statistics or even start recording to capture the phone call .... \n. \"The concept of XPrivacy is that everything should be as normal as possible.\"\nWould be nice to extend this to \"configureable as possible\" ;). I really like your app but the user can even with the settings now crash applications or stop them from working. as the user can allways reset everything no harm is done. adding a possibility that allows to select between \"send fake data\" or \"drop the intent\" would extend privacy. imho\n. this could all be hidden under \"export mode\" so it is possible and the average user won't be overwhelmed with the available options. or even like - press once - send fake data - press twice - drop intent - press three times - send originial intent\n. no i ment more like. open up for example \"acrobat reader\" inside the app settings there should be option like \"show all unrestricted\" when the menu button is pressed and then just the options are shown that are unrestricted. instead of opening up every submenu and look into it to see which right is still granted\n. \"Filter on permissions\" is no good idea imho as new options will be added with \"my\" option you can quickly check if the app has them allready blocked.\n. i will test it and report back how it works\n.

Now I block the internet access for this app with XPrivacy.\n4. Since XPrivacy knows about the internet permission (it did before) and the block (cause it is XPrivacy internal data), it could show a different symbol to inform the user that this app currently has no internet access although is has the Android permission for internet.\nRegards,\n  Christian\n.

Tomorrow is my last day then I have 2 weeks holiday... so I will check it then :o\n. okay with v1.7x I have better battery results. Or the screen was on while riding... I can't reproduce it too. :o\n. After about 10 Days I checked my phone... in my contact list were about 3.000 Entries which XPrivacy restricted. Can someone please check if this happens on other roms?\n\n. I will test this week a little bit. \nMaybe someone with a Samsung ROM would test it too?\n. okay...\nI made some Contacts with Outlook just containing minimal Information\ne.g.\nWA (as Prefix) NAME + Mobile Phone Number, Group \"Whatsapp\" and private status.\nWA Marcel  +44 1234565\nWA Stefan +49 123345564\nWA Andre +49 123456789\nNow I synced them with myphoneexplorer to my phone. \nI restrict the complete contacts for Whatsapp. Then I allow some contacts and chose the WA-Ones.\nRefresh Contact list in Whatsapp. Maybe restart app some time or reboot phone 2-3x. That should reproduce the problem. \nI am not sure if this only happens to Samsung ROMS because I only use one phone with Whatsapp...\n. Same issue without sync-tool.\nI also allowed \"Whatsapp-Account\" in this screenshot\nhttps://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4984999/1995254/41d2c7d6-8501-11e3-9269-0b10fa0b677e.jpg\nNow i unchecked it and It seems that whatsapp is still running and no more contacts will be added to the android contact database. Must be a problem in reading/writing contacts??\n. funny that Whatsapp is still working without having any access to the Whatsapp Account \n. http://pastebin.com/LD0ZcUfj\n. I will try, thanks!\nJust to mention... Whatsapp is still working without having rights to its account but got an FC when I try to refresh contacts.\nI will report.\nThanks! :+1: \n. no, still multiple whatsapp aliases. And some unknown contacts with no numbers, only whatsapp aliases in the phone book... :/\nMaybe it is because Whatsapp gets limited information and then write the data to the whatsapp account?\nI can simpyl reproduce it when I refresh my contact list - everytime there is a new alias for whatsapp in the phone book.\n. I installed the release you posted above. \nNow my complete phone book leaked because I see all Contacts in Whatsapp :/\ncontacts/profile was not getting in bold letters.\nI am back to the latest beta now - now I only see the contacts I restricted.\nBTW I am the only (crazy person with paranoia) that restrict the contact Information for Whatsap to a minimum???\n. Hi Marcel, there is also a 1.99.38-2 - should I try this one?\nThis evening I will check it - is there something to check or uncheck? \n. \nSettings okay or should I restrict the red ones too?\nI tried to test with the latest Version but same behaviour.\nThere are also unknown Contacts in my PhoneBook right now  - without any link to a contact:\n\nHere a specific contact:\n\nstrange:\n\n. now I...\n- checked all checkboxes under Contacts for Whatsapp\n- allowed Accounts for Whatsapp (no checks)\n- deleted contacts database, restarted the device\n- synced all my contacts back on the device (in memory Phone)\nSame issues. \nThere are several unknown contacts and for every refresh in the whatsapp contact list there is a new link in the phonebook contact.\n. When Accounts is disabled (or enabled and Whatsapp allowed) there are no new entries in the phonebook. It seems that Whatsapp produces lot of data in the phone and the phone links them together to a bunch of waste :)\n. it also seems that the unknown contacts are the contacts which I allowed for Whatsapp but they don't have an account - yet.\n. Thanks Marcel.\nWorkaround for me:\n- \"fresh Contacts\"\n- restricting contacts for Whatsapp\n- restricting accounts for Whatsapp after first start and refresh\nNow I can use it without having 3000+ Contacts in my Phonebook because whatsapp is not able to write to the phonebook. But... when I refresh the contacts I get a FC and new contacts cannot be found. But I can live with that for now...\n. http://pastebin.com/XAutDrZa  :)\n. who reported? :o\n. Thanks JayjohnX. That might solve the problem for other Whatsapp-User. I canceled my Whatsapp-Account, now I am using Threema. Still some missing contacts but the whole thing is a lot safer than WA.\n. Hi there,\nwhen I opened this issue I had Android 4.2.2 on my S4. I switched to 4.4.2 in April and I also had this issues after upgrading Android. Since I deleted Whatsapp in August I can't help out anymore :/\n. just tested it with Android Settings/Accounts\nI disabled Accounts at \"ANT Service\" in XPrivacy and tried to take a look at the settings....\n. Yes I rebooted. hmm since there are lots of other users I think it might be a problem... I am back to 2.0.25 and imported settings from 2.0.27 and Accounts work great.

On generating a random string that resembles an IMEI:\nIf apps like Facebook are trying to do some IMEI validation, it's probably worth checking that the first two digits are in the set of RBIs actually in use - it's a small list. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reporting_Body_Identifier)\nYou've all seen the IMEI structure, it seems like modern TAC allocations seem pretty random and not worth trying to restrict. Who's to say you don't have some random new phone, or a very niche product? (http://www.mulliner.org/tacdb/feed/)\n\"IMEI and MEID structures are superficially the same except that the first two digits must be decimal for an IMEI, and must be hexadecimal for an MEID ... The TIA also allocates IMEI codes, specifically destined for dual-technology phones, out of the RR=99 range. Other administrators working under GSMA may also allocate any IMEI for use in dual-technology phones. Every IMEI can also be used as an MEID in CDMA2000 devices\" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_equipment_identifier)\nMNC/MCC generation seems pretty ugly... Even a bare list of mobile codes is about 1700 items totalling 12KB. Maybe include short (n=32) list of sample codes to randomly select and let the user override? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mobile_country_codes\n. two more use cases:\n- games that tie your locally saved state to device serial number. change your device, lose the game, and maybe in-app purchases too.\n- ad networks that try track you based on serial number or location. if you have 6 apps all using the same tracking library fetching the same static fake data, then you develop a trackable profile just like using all real data.\n. It's considered bad form to expose raw database errors, which may include host, credentials, or other sensitive configuration parameters. Also, there's no need to expose it to end users who are unable to do anything about it anyway.\n. Thanks. My bad.\n.

Edit: after another reboot the app now receives app specific fake data, the check is set to random at boot, the db shows null=use global fake dataa\n. Now instead of resetting to random at boot, it resets to both random at boot and use global data unchecked. The db still shows random@boot as null.

I would say a bug, if I have not assigned a value to the OnDemand field, then I would understand that the system can make a decision to set the value to true. However if I explicitly tell the system that OnDemand should be set to false, the system should not override my decision with what it thinks is best for me.\n. Yes, all issues fixed\n.

The one linked on line 2 of his xposed log. Sorry copy/paste doesn't work on github app\n. Are not restricted or cannot be restricted? I know something like this makes no sense since the app is only accessing information it already has access to, I am just wondering if it would be possible\n. UID 10163\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.viber.voip&hl=en\nI tried that multiple times before opening the ticket\n. Viber matches your contacts to their list of Viber user, so that it can offer you a list of your contacts who also use Viber, like most messaging apps. I am sure we agreed to this somewhere in the fine print. Which is why it is important to only allow certain contacts to be uploaded to their servers in the first place.\nI understand that the viber contacts can't allowed or blocked, my problem is with group 'all contacts', which is my local contact list. Viber doesn't recognize the contacts I have allowed from that list.\nThe good thing is that data isn't leaking out, so if you can't reproduce the error and nobody else has the same problem, I will live it.\n. You mean not stored, since the Viber database has no contacts.\nI will start with a clean install and post my results. However that would mean if I ever meet new cool people with viber I would have to start with a clean install every time I meet somebody\n. It usually has a pull to refrsh option. Which is something I currently don't see\n. After some further testing I have come to the conclusion that the problem has nothing to do with XPrivacy. Even with it disabled I still cannot access my contacts. Thank you for looking into it though\n. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.ne.neko.freewing.ReadContacts\n. For me it's the other way around. It cannot access my call log\n. the usage data shows a deny for the call logs, but nothing regarding contacts\n.

FYI\nThe documentation for contacts/people to add to the info section\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Contacts.People.html\n. Edit: I just restored a backup with .47 and the issue was already present. I will update again to .48 and report back\n. Issue did not reoccur on update .48 \n. Only weird part is that it didn't happen on the update to .47 either, as my nightly export does not contain the error. Meaning it randomly happened sometime today (maybe during a reboot)\nAt least I don't have to redo 170 restrictions :)\n. Weird. I can easily reproduce. Also longpressing an app unselects all. If I longpress an app then unselect it, followed by 'select all', then it behaves as it should\n. Please try it once directly after a reboot\n. It may take a little while to let you know if it worked, as I don't know exactly how to reproduce the error\n. didn't take that long after all\nhttps://gist.github.com/an0n981/0d58b37e26cdadd259a6\n. ok, thanks for looking into it\n. Just in case anyone stumbles upon this with the same error. I am pretty confident the issue was caused by restricting Internet: connect for either system ui or com.android.keyguard\n. Ok. But I was unable to reproduce it. I was gonna wait til I got to work to edit my post as it was not system ui or keyguard. After unrestricting 1000/internet/connect it was fine all night. Also after reading up on CaptivePortalTracker it makes sense that the issue wasn't visible at first, since I refuse to connect to my work WiFi. But if I can restrict connect for 1000 again I would be much happier\n. Boot loop still active on 1.99.50 with 1000/Internet:connect restricred. Also Internet:connect and ID:/proc still require a reboot\n. Edit: boot loop only active when wifi connected\n. I was just getting ready to write a novel describing from an IT-Administrator point of view about why I am certain this is a bug that was introduced with .49. But it looks as if you found the problem. As I am however not fluent in java (main reason being I have no patience to find one wrong semi-colon in 100000 lines of code) I will just assume that you should not have missed that.\n. that sucks for me, but def makes sense.\n. The answer is actually so easy I feel stupid for not having thought of this previously. Since the blocking takes place during the DNS request, I just added the IP to the local host file. All good now. Huge holes in corporate security make me smile\n. I am sure that it does not provide any usage data, I will test completely restricting it (after a nandroid) and see if my phone still boots.\n. restricting it does absolutely nothing. so that should probably be added as well.\n. do you have a link, I can't find anything on it\n. I am one of those people.\nThanks for the link, learn something new every day.\n. Nice\n. Genius\n. Edit: for some apps I receive the dns name\n. The part I don't understand is that the popups for some apps show the hostname and some don't.\n. The part I don't understand is that the popups for some apps show the hostname and some don't.\n. I know this may be being a bit picky, but would a combination of DNS and IP be possible? The upside of of having only DNS is that the whitelist will not be as long, but on the other hand with a combination we could restrict multinational services to servers in Europe for example\nAlso with this version Tapatalk cannot to XDA although it is not blacklisted. Faircode forum works ;)\n. @M66B sorry I somehow missed your reply, after a reboot XDA was working fine again. Given the fact that backbones in cretain countries are more prone to being monitored, I thought it would be a great security feature to be able to decide with which serves of the same service we connect to. For example I would feel a little more safe connecting to goggle services (bad example, they give me the creeps) if that server were in Europe as compared to the USA\n. Another argument: this could help against DNS hijacking\n. Just to confirm .51-3 'fixes' this issue\n. ## Working great with folders and TLD\nRegards,\nAnonymous\n-------- Original Message --------\nFrom: Marcel Bokhorst notifications@github.com\nSent: February 22, 2014 12:06:41 PM CET\nTo: M66B/XPrivacy XPrivacy@noreply.github.com\nCc: an0n981 an0n981@posteo.de\nSubject: Re: [XPrivacy] [Requst] Add TLD Whie/Blacklisting (#1418)\nI had just added whitelisting for folder, so this was not difficult anymore.\nPlease let me know if everything works okay: http://d-h.st/oCX\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/issues/1418#issuecomment-35800151\n. perfection yet again\n. just one little side effect. had to add android.intent.action.view for my launcher to open the xda tapatalk wodget.

The English phrase is actually 'a page' not 'a leaf'\n. As a native speaker (American (the real English), not British) I will can tell you that books have pages not leafs.\nAnd I love how we have hijacked @M66B GitHub page for our own little language leason.\n. I would actually say 'flip through the pages' but yes 'to turn over a new leaf' means exactly that.\nOr maybe he is just currently unavailable and will yell at us through his keyboard upon his return\n. Even after working with British and Australian people for years, it still amazes me how many subtle differences the same language can have. For example, just yesterday I learned that the American 'eraser' is called a 'rubber' in Britian. Which in America is used to define, well rubber. Also it can be used as a slang word for condom. This is why I was a little shocked yesterday when this chick I work with asked me if had a rubber.\n. Edit: Expoting, clearing and importing would achieve the same thing. And I am assuming not many users remove apps in recovery\n. Since you are adding something, there is no need to clear the settings. Just import your setting for that app from previous export\n. @Cerberus-tm I am trying to figure out whether your question is meant sarcastically or not, I will treat it as not.\nIf you have no previous settings then you have to create new ones once you are able to access XPrivacy, this can be done manually or by fetching from the server (Pro version only: http://xprivacy.eu)\nThis question did give me an idea though, if it were possible to accurately predict the UID that the PackageManager will assign to an app (I'm sure there is some kind of mathematical algorithm for this) then it would be possible to use an 'insert into' statement on the xprvicay db before shutting down to flash the apk. This way the app would already be restricted before it ever has a chance to load for the first time. I'm off to do some research...\n. No the template does not get applied since the XPrivcay service that monitors installs is not active ( @M66B correct me if I am wrong here), Which is why I am interested in finding the logic behind UID assignment. If I can accurately predict the UID that the app will receive after being flashed, then I can create it's settings in the XPrivacy database before I shut down to flash the apk. This would be of particular interest when for example flashing GAPPS. This way Google would have no chance of gathering information about the device. If you wait til after the boot has completed to adjust the settings, the Google apps are already active.\nWhen removing apps through recovery, the export, clear data (the important step), and reimport can be done after the fact. In all honesty this is not that big a issue since the important system components (apps UID < 10000) are already setup, meaning you are not risking a boot loop by not clearing the database. The only thing that could happen, if you install a new apk and it is assigned a UID that was previously assigned to an app that you removed in recovery, XPrivacy will use the settings that you had for the previous app, since these are not purged automatically, potentially resulting in data leaks. \n. Issue still active, give me a second to upload the export file, which is now only about half the size.\n. https://mega.co.nz/#!V4ZU2ahR!NqA2Zb4UAM14TRsOuoFhSzD1fUDVYKUg9Dbl1pwaV6A\n. Of course, please provide a test version.\n. Confirmed fixed\n. Although the export file is even smaller\n. That's not what she said\n. comment\n. Line 307 states \"It is not possible to restrict hardware MAC addresses...\" line 693 now line 696 states \"You can restrict ...

I did not know of any other kind of mac address\n. ok, now it makes sense.\n. No upside down question mark :( confirmed working\n. The 180 trick worked! Thanks for the idea.\nOne small suggestion, to keep things in line with the restrictions check box if a category is marked without any functions, the check mark should stay in the solid box state instead of switching back to the question mark\n. Your efficiency never ceases to amaze me. Works\n. I'm confused, was this actually added or is this a won't fix?

I believe the commit referenced here has the (unwanted?) side effect of removing the onDemand question mark in the app overview.

Restricting Location access for Play Services will already prevent this, correct?\n. I also wondered why Google wants sensor access\n. Wait, you already fixed this?\n. From XDA thread:\n@memethecat :\nSo does this\n\"when a category is filtered toggle onDemand for that category\"\nmean all other on-demand boxes in the given app will be empty?\nI think that's what most people are looking for, empty boxes.\n@an0n981\nMy idea was to have the onDemand ? in the app overview work the same way as the restriction check box \n. if that is how it sounded maybe I should have worded it better. I would like to be able to utilize (1) this area to check or uncheck onDemand, either completely for the app if All is seleceted (2) here, or for the selected category\n\n. :thumbsup: \n. When all onDemand ? have been removed for an app, shouldn't the half state be empty?\n. Tested thoroughly :thumbsup: \n. That does work, but IMHO I don't think that fix is a good idea, it is no longer possible to restrict inet onDeamnd. My suggestion was merely to change the text in the popup to advise that the onDemand restriction will be valid until the app exits.\n. when I open an app I receive a popup for inet, since I have inet restricted with onDemand enabled, before this version, I was able to select Once and allow. When I close and re-open the app, I am asked again if inet should be allowed. With this new version I can only select allow without checking once, meaning the restriction for inet is removed, it now has unrestricted inet access and does not ask me again the next time I open the app\n.  Shouldn't this also apply to the app detail view?\n. IMHO that wasn't even necessary.\nJust out of curiosity, if a user deselects dangerous functions, is there a way to restore the predefined dangerous functions or see which functions were predefined?\n. I though an idea like this would have promoted itself :(\nMaybe there aren't enough Tasker users\n. As long as we are still talking about only building an intent to 'randomize now', and not things like if maps is active use real location etc, I do not see any real security threat in random apps being able to send the intent. All that would happen is the randomization would take place ahead of schedule.\nEither way, I don't think it will matter, as it does not look like we will get another 8 +1 in the next 6 days.\n. @Cerberus-tm IMHO it doesn't matter if an app can figure out that I am lying to it, as long as it doesn't actually get the real information. And if a developer would go to lengths like that, I don't think he/she is to be trusted enough to install the app in the first place.\n. @M66B would you be so kind as to point me to the code where the randomizing takes place, specifically where the possible values are defined?\n. Yes that is exactly what I want to do. Tasker has an option to randomize variables buit-in with a min-max definition. I would only need to know which values are acceptable in XPrivacy. I could then turn off all randomizing options in XPrivacy and update the values from Tasker.\nIt looks like some of the needed info is here:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/PrivacyManager.java#L917\n. I don't think they should be completely separated, since restricting system apps is dangerous, (from what I have seen, this is where most user errors come from). If this can be achieved by building a sub menu under 'restrict dangerous' then +1. \nMy idea: move 'use secure connection' to general. This no longer needs to be an expert option. If I remember correctly it was put there to test if it works properly. I believe by now we can say that it works (and should be enabled by default?). Then rename 'Expert Mode' to 'Expert Mode (Dangerous Functions)'. Then remove 'Restrict Dangerous' and replace it with the individual dangerous settings.\n. as -1 instead of just 0? If you don't count me (which is perfectly fair) and @hollal (also understandable) then it should still be +3. however you are of course judge, jury and executioner. \nEdit: After rereading my comment, I now see where the -1 comes from. It is definitely a vote against the original proposal. (I didn't know it was possible to give a -1)\n. Although I cannot give a +1 (this is not a feature I need) I request that my -1 be changed to a 0\n. As far as performance goes, I can't notice a difference, but my device is really fast.\nWildcards for IPs/domains has a bug:\nIf I allow (insert xprivacy ip here):443 or you.know.urIP. * :443 for the xprivacy app everything is good, but if I allow some.IP.address. * : * it unrestricts the connect method. The same goes for apps that use dns names\n. In order to test this I first cleared the whitelist, otherwise I would not have received the popup for the XPrivacy app while submitting since it only has one entry (two if you never removed the old server IP from the whitelist). Another good example is Orbot (org.torproject.android) which only has one DNS entry (localhost:9051) Please try to submit restrictions once after clearing the whitelist for XPrivacy/IP\n. Also worth mentioning is the fact that in addition to unrestricting the connect method is that no whitelist entry is even created when selecting x.x.x. * : *\n. Confirm that withe/black listing now works as intended :thumbsup: \nAlso is it normal that there are commits to review the code changes for this?\n. TYPO. I bad, I meant there were no commits prior to the new test version. I do review your commits (with my minimal java knowledge), just like I do all other open source xposed mods that I use.\n. Thanks again for this amazing feature!\n. In adition to Greenify to kill apps that are running in the background, maybe also have a look at a start up manager like Android Tuner or Rom ToolBox to prevent apps from autostarting on boot or when an intent is sent.\n. @danielmmmm you can also blacklist items by clicking whitelist and deny\n. Yes issue still exists\n. Install GitHub (only app I actually tested this with). Restrict Connect onDemand. Allow the GitHib IPs. Then remove the onDemand check (Inet/Connect=Deny). GitHub can still access the previously whitelisted IPs\n. IMHO if I remove the onDemand then white/blacklist should no longer be active, Since I have set Inet/Connect to deny\n. I don't know where you could put an icon, but what about a toast when an onDemand is unchecked that has white listed items?\n. Should the icon have the same size as the pngs in res/drawable? I will see if I can create one. But it won't be before Friday. Tomorrow is a holiday here :) and I want to get paid for creating an icon.\n. Is this related? XPrivacy / res / drawable / whitelist_holo_dark.png \n. But this is what we are looking at size wise?\n. appreciate that :thumbsup: \n. Since I couldn't decide on one really cool icon, I created a few different icons. Feel free to chose which one to use. Or maybe someone else has an even better idea\nhttps://mega.co.nz/#!M54wnbaL!UIQrFdtBO-TTVKWH-MPa5CcBbWRdEVHwDHAsfy_l87o\n. Very nice! It even opens directly to the proper list.\n. It even knows when to show and when not :thumbsup:\n. I was expecting an icon that indicates whether or not white lists are possible. I did not envision something so awesome\n. I will ping you\n. Still the same error in the log and support info with this version.\n. :thumbsup: \n. Just thought I'd update. Working great with official 2.6.1 XPosed\n. For example when importing on a different device? That is something I didn't consider.\n. Since accounts can only be imported on the same device, couldn't this instead be queried from the system when needed?\n. Correct me if I wrong, but isn't the salt the SerialNumber (hard coded to the device) and not the AndroidID?\n. That this is a from XPrivacy randomly generated ID doesn't quite add up. I knew I had seen that ID somewhere outside of XPrivacy before, til just I couldn't remember where that was. TWRP uses this same ID as a folder name to store nandroid backups. Which is why I noticed this in the db in the first place.\n. I just manipulated the crowd db twice in with very liitle effort (Not sure if you would be able to tell, but have a look at LightningWall entries). IMHO this should probably continue to use the BUILD.Serial since this can't be restricted for XPrivacy, but I think it should be queried when needed instead of being saved in the db where it can easily be altered.\n. The only thing I did was close the XPrivacy UI while making the switch. I didn't receive any prompts.\n. Just be sure:\nYou want me install, test, manually delete salt, test again?\n. Of course, I am here to help\n. Submit/fetch, export/import worked fine. Allowed accounts worked before deleting, but not after. Here a log of opening GitHub after deleting the salt.  https://mega.co.nz/#!gp4lUTZJ!7rS_vSt63ulZvhooRfywBsRfi1WaS83KsLaIj-CFTc8\n. The salt in my last xml is identical to ro.serialno\n. Could it that there is no ro.build.serial available in the getprop command, but instead only ro.serialno and ro.boot.serialno\n. The selected accounts are also still selected, but when I open the app ( I tested with GitHub and Twitter) it asks me to login, when I unrestrict accounts category, the app knows my login again\n. Of course, even rebooted. Still the same result\n. There was only 1 account in the db. Deleting it, and even recreating a new account in android and allowing it in the selected accounts doesn't work.\nDo you have command to verify BUILD.Serial? getprop doesn't list it\n. That only list the 2 values I listed above. Which are both the same as the salt.\nIf the link you posted (2.0.25-4) is the new test version, then yes I am sure\n. XPrivacy is completely unrestricted\n. From boot or just while opening the app?\n. Didn't work either. Here a log https://mega.co.nz/#!Iw5FnQzL!NOmHl06ocnqhOdEV6CPkwLKIDYGiRl-MWTkFl6J2yW4\nGitHub UID='10143'\nHere something interesting\n05-28 22:04:28.828 I/XPrivacy(5885): get setting uid=0 /Salt=E5CD9F335F7E8FA 2 ms\n05-28 22:05:26.623 I/XPrivacy(5936): get setting uid=0 /Salt=F31131921E8981ED 2 ms\nNeither is correct\n. Already thought of that, didn't help and there is no usage data for github/serial\n. You are correct, sorry I unrestricted %serialno instead of Serial (which of course has no usage data). Now it works. But unrestricting serial serial for apps that have allowed accounts doesn't sound like a good fix\n. You may need to buy some more cigars. With this version even when unrestricting serial it doesn't work.\n. Your genius never ceases to amaze me! Confirmed with Twitter and GitHub\n. OK. No need to keep this open, I will update once they have provided the proper update.\n. I will tackle markdown this weekend and do another pull request\n. It wasn't cause by manipulating, or else I would have noticed already. The test version still has the same result\n. Confirm 2.0.24 fixed this issue\n. Confirmed\n. Another project. Is it Android related and available to the public? If so, please do share a link\n. wow that is kinda big.\n. Could this be the same as issue #1493? Is there maybe a command to check whether the update process has completed? In that issue it took 6 hrs.\n. I don't know if this still the case, but I have previously seen NotifyClean cause the randomize notification to get stuck at 99%\n. It suppresses notifications. For example it could be used to hide the restart required from xprivacy or the permanent tasker notification while a profile is active. But like I said I once had someone show up in my (unofficial xprivacy helpdesk) office with xprivacy randomize stuck 99%. It was a lot of fun finding the issue on that one.\n. That's awsome!\nIt can also suppress ongoing notifications, if the 100% and 99% are both suppressed, then it gets stuck at 98% and so on\n. which only @defim could look into, since he holds the code. Or maybe it has been fixed by now, I don't know. I don't use it. And I told the user where I saw it to quit being lazy and swipe once with his thumb.\n. i guess\n. sorry, didn't mean to close your ticket. pressed the wrong button\n. -1. Sorry. But giving 3rd party apps access to the restrictions db via an intent is a major security concern for me.\nAlso you can already achieve any combination you can come up with using Tasker by running sql updates on the restriction db in a shell command (root required). For more info see here https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/DATABASE.md\n. +2\n. IMHO clearing the cache is really all that is needed anyways, everything else can already be done via shell scripts that can be automated via Tasker\n. @cerberus-tm Given that there are infinite possibilities that can be achieved using SQL statements, I don't think there is a way to create an app where you can just click your way to the result you want. The best thing to do is learn a little SQL. A documentation of the XPrivacy databases has already been created with a few examples to get you started. https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/DATABASE.md\n. If the cache intent is implemented, the documentation could be expanded to include things like those above, they just don't make a lot sense without it since you currently have to reboot after every change. Or (with @M66B blessing) we could even start a new XDA thread for XPrivacy SQL related question.\n. Is the wakelock enhacement still included in this version?\nEDIT: disregard, the answer is yes\n. The good news is, it works as intended, which means the bad news is that I have not yet found a way around the permission :wink:\n. haven't given up yet. one solution would of course be to change the code and build myself, but I am gonna try all other options first\n. Good news, I have given up on circumventing the restriction. One question, a helper app would have to send the following command  'am start -a biz.bokhorst.xprivacy.action.FLUSH' along with having 'biz.bokhorst.xprivacy.MANAGE_XPRIVACY' permission, correct?\n. After playing with this (it's a lot easier with the proper command) I'm trying to figure out where the permission part comes into play. I created a helper app with the permission, but it still needs root to run, or I can just send the command from terminal or tasker (with root) although neither has the permission\n. I wish could post the source, but the app was created with Tasker AppFactory, it creates an apk from a tasker task woth can be run without having tasker installed.\nWhen I run without root the log shows a missing permission\nandroid.permission.INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS_FULL\nWhen I add the permission, the app requires root to run\n. I read the entire conversation 3 times, and the only thing I got out of it was how stupid Facebook is (which I already knew) @Vankog Would you mind explaining one more time what enhancement you are trying to achieve with this request?\n. can't believe I missed that.\n. When editing the restrictions db, you have to reboot or change restrictions in the app, the server side cache is only updated on a change in app. see here for more info: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=52669913&postcount=9277\n. Also note that restriction categories are already present, your INSERT INTO example is not a good idea as you will now have 2 entries in the db. For categories an UPDATE statement will suffice.\n. I can confirm this behavior. The entry is removed from the DB. However the onDemand is still asked. If I then allow/deny one of the methods, this entry is saved to the db, but the category is still missing. If I apply allow/deny to the entire category the category and all methods are added to the db. So technically even with the missing entry, everything is being restricted properly. Whether or not this is a bug or the documentation needs to be updated is a question that @M66B would better be able to answer.\nAs to the meaning column, I see no way to improve this without writing a novel in each box. Looking at the 'meaning' along with 'as seen in xprivacy' makes it very logical as to what is going on. Of course, if you see a better way to do this, feel free.\n. Nice. Currently my nightly backup takes almost 2 hrs. Will there be a test version for this?\n. Worked perfectly.\nWakelocks (requires root / system app on Android 4.4+)\nXPrivacy.Export (biz.bokhorst.xprivacy.XPrivacy): 3 m 7 s  (187 s) Count:1 10.4%\nAfter the export the device went right back into deep sleep\n. Of course. I just pasted the results from Better Battery Stats (which warns that root is needed to read the wake locks) to show that the wake lock worked and was properly released.\n. Not Chrome, the open source stock AOSP browser, the one that used to be standard before Google started pushing Chrome. It is still standard on ROMs that don't have the proprietary GAPPS installed.\nIt does not share its UID.\n. Those are all mine :) Spelling was never my forte.\n. These should probably be separated into multiple tickets\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy#support\n. Confirmed working\n. If you import settings including onDemand onto a new rom from an export where 'restrict dangerous' was checked, all your onDemand settings will also be imported.\nIf you enable onDemand for all your apps at once, have fun with the after the next reboot\n. This change has made my app overview very ugly https://mega.co.nz/#!Z8Ai2LbC!jjVo0sAxVA9KXwB2gajEx8d0jQ7TXUOIJVc_vAv9lyI\n. New test version confirmed working\n. I had the same issue we discussed yesterday. But it didn't look like it affected every app this time. Would a log of the update process be of any help?\n. Found a bug in the template when a new app is installed. For non dangerous the template applies [ ] [?] for dangerous [ ] [ ] regardless of what the template has. If I then manually apply the template everything works\n. It is properly applied now\n. However, now there is a problem when importing, only 'dangerous methods' are applied from the xml, even if I define them as not dangerous in the template. Also when I manually uncheck then check a category none of the methods are restricted (this may have already been present)\n. yes, this is not a better way to describe it, this is incorrect.\n. [?] = ask, [ ] = asked\n. Here how to enable debug log via terminal emulator:\nsu\nsqlite3 /data/system/xprivacy/xprivacy.db\nUPDATE setting SET value='true' WHERE uid='0' AND name='Log';\nReboot\n. When updating from for example 2.0.38 to .39, is the value of 'Version' changed before or after the reboot? Because the only way I could see this being a problem is if I update XPrivacy, then before I reboot install a few apps and import their restrictions.\n. Scrath that, since the app overview is blocked until I reboot, I could only import (if at all possible) from the notification, so 1 app at a time\n. Please try once to kill the app via settings - apps. The launch it again. The apps are most likely auto starting at boot and therefore the onDemand popup is denied before your phone reaches the lock screen\n. Just out of curiosity, which mod was it?\n. @cableghost out of curriosity, what is uid 10286\n. My question was what app that was, if don't mind sharing that info\n. you're the boss\n. They would both effectively do the same thing. I guess that would be a matter of personal preference. For example, my preference is to use filters. I never use sort by\n. it needs su rights\n. however, at least for me,  it still only export default values, ignoring the -e :(\n. Yeah, my bad, my thumbs are to thick. works perfectly\n. I'm still trying to get the extra field to work. I will update once I have it.\n. ## From http://tasker.dinglisch.net/userguide/en/intents.html\nExtras\nAny additional data to send with the intent.\nThe extras must be in the form of a single colon-separated key and value. If the value can be parsed as an integer, long (integer ending in L), floating point number, double (float ending in D) or boolean (true/false) it will be treated as one, otherwise as a string.\nExample: have_flowers:true\nExample: this.is.an.integer.example:34\nLooks like it will not accept \"FileName /sdcard/test.xml\" in the extra field\n. :+1: \n. @OyyoDams This may be a little OT, but you use import/export to temporarily give an app Internet permission?\n. An alternative repo is the XPosed repository which is included in the Xpised Installer app. And since the Xposed Installer is needed for XPrivacy, this is a win-win\n. This may be of interest https://gist.github.com/b91e05675f5d6b2fd024\n. I just realized that as well\n. You could develop an xda app that is not total crap\n. I have over 50% free when lag occurs\n. Allow and deny are reversed\n. The problem is that clearing XPrivacy data is a precaution to prevent bootloops caused by possible UID change of system apps. If the data is not cleared prior to upgrade, there is no benefit in clearing it afterwards, as you obviously did not encounter the bootloop\n. :thumbsup:\n. @Droidphilev Did you enable XPrivacy debug logging and reboot? There is only 1 reference to XPrivacy in the log\n. IMHO an app that is that evil should be uninstalled. There are alternatives for accessing Facebook\n. But the fact is that if Facebook can implement this, then any app can implement it\n. Of course, that is a great idea\n. Expert mode in app settings is not the same as the global settings, it is an option to enable app specifc quirks. If an app has no app specific randomize settings, global values will be used\n. From XDA:\nOn the XP that i want to export there's no way to select apps that are set to \"off\" except manually. I filter on \"user apps\" and press elect all. All apps that are \"on\" become grey but not the ones that are \"off\". Now when i flash a new rom and i import this file those apps are not set to \"off\" but they all have \"on demand\" (which is my default setting). It would be nice that:\n- apps that are \"off\" are in \"select all\"\n- these apps become there imported as \"off\" in a new instance of XP\n. Whitelisting a package in 'Select applications to allow' does not affect Srv_getApplicationInfo and Srv_getPackageInfo, these restrictions must either be only allowed once for x seconds or completely allowed/denied.\n. I have to note that I tested this using Google Camera requesting these permissions for google play services onDemand. After my previous comment, I changed the permissions for these 2 restrictions from [ x ] [ ? ] to [ x ] [  ] and the camera no longer crashed\n. Now I understand, this is related to issue #2031, also see #1894 where I requested this previously and @M66B 's comment on the request\n. This must caused by a bad restriction, I have no problems with TextSecure\n. Yes I am and yes I can, if you provide me with an email address (best through xda pm to protect you personal info) I can send you the xml file\n. I was trying to make it easier for you with the xml so you can just import it...\nhttps://gist.github.com/an0n981/a028f87d81532ac913b9\n. I can reproduce the issue with SMS, TextSecure push messages work. Checking restrictions/usage...\n. I think the problem is is with phone/mnc mcc\n11-27 20:09:21.600 W/MmsCommunication(7358): Getting MMSC params for apn null\nCapturing a debug log...\n. Debug log while semding sms\nhttps://gist.github.com/an0n981/da4ee06d7b8b18217563\n. 10008 SystemUI/Keyguard\n10043 TextSecure\n. Marcel, let me know if you need me to help test\n. The issue only happens with SMS, not TextSecure messages. To send an SMS to registered TextSecure number hold the 'send' button then select 'send insecure sms'\n. @moxie0 is there a way to enable a debug log in TextSecure that might help to troubleshoot the issue?\n. @M66B 2 things, 1. If you press and hold the sent message then press the info icon does it show 'sent' or 'pending'? 2. While sending a SMS with debug log enabled, it does not show any denied restrictions\n. It is being cause by a (or a combination) of restrictions, give me a few minutes and I will have it figured out\n. All, please try unrestricting location/srv_listen and phone/srv_listen for TextSecure followed by reboot. Only killing TextSecure is not enough. If needed I can post all restrictions\n. @grrrr you can test push messages by sending yourself a message, if the 'send' button is blue then push (encrypted message) is the default transport method\n@moxie0 the only question that remains for me is what change in TextSecure caused the issue and if that change is really necessary (from a privacy perspective) or if the app could function properly without accessing these methods?\n. It does not need access to mcc/mnc to work properly, also consider whitelisting the libraries an app can access (not just textsecure) instead of giving it complete access to any shell restriction.\n. @moxie0 https://gist.github.com/an0n981/ced00ef3df027e50f82c\nThese restriction settings will allow all TextSecure funcrions to work properly. Anyone with an XPrivacy pro license can save the contents to an xml file and import into XPrivacy.\n. I am on the latest version (3.5.9) and I can send/receive both secure messages and sms.\n. 'Restrict system component' means core android applications UID less than 10000. The restrictions marked red are 'dangerous restrictions'\n. To find the app clear filter in menu, then open the apps usage data and long press on the functions you need to white/blacklist\n. Importing whitelisted accounts only works when the android ID has not changed. It may work if you restore your previous Android ID, for example with with Titanium Backup, although I have not tried this myself. I assume the 'w' is shown because the database entry is re-imported although it cannot be applied.\nEdit: See FAQ 17 in the readme for more info\n. 'android.intent.action.SOME_ACTION:some.parameter' would also benefit from this\n. Edit: Issue 2072 would also solve this\n. No, only an item was allowed denied, not if it was onDemand popup (or screen off) vs if it already black/ whitelisted\n. I may be be wrong here, but I believe this was implemented after a DDOS attack, which would be possible again under the proposed solution. There is another solution. It includes writing custom IPTable rules for all your apps, and allowing XPrivacy access outside of the TOR Network, this solution also has the advantage that you can really control which apps go through TOR and which don't and you can send their DNS traffic to a provider of your choice, not what your sim cards decides is best. I have posted instructions for this on the AFWall thread on XDA in the past.\n@M66B sorry for the OT.\n. I don't think you understood what I said, but that's ok.\n. I am alright, how about yourself?\nI had around 1.2 GB free at the time of the crash\n. I don't know if it was caused by 3.5.8 or by TW rom, as I have just switched back to TW from AOSP. I previously had UI crashes with prevuozs XPrivacy versions. I can upload the logs if you would like.\n. Logs sent via email, seem to not be related to out of memory error\n. \nNow a lot of the icons don't show in the list view\n. Noticably faster. When scrolling and coming to a stop I used to have to wait a second for the list to finish processing, but now it's always ready as soon it stops scrolling.\nAlso worth noting, only 'Andy the Android' icons don't show up, and not all of them either. All apps with their own icon show up just fine.\n. Andy is back!\nTesting XPrivacy is much more fun than watching 'Home Alone' for the 800th time, a weird Christmas tradition where I live.\n. I have noticed that there are now randomly icons missing while scrolling, when scrolling back through they reappear, there is no logic to which icons don't appear\n. I liked the Andy version better thab the Angry version\n. But now he is angry, we are back to him being missing, not as often as before, but still he does seem angry\n. It is definitely geitting better, only 3 andys are missng. But no, not fixed completely\n. Yes everything is working great, speed is amazing. The apps are com.samsung.indexservice, com.sec.android.app.SPenKeeper and com.sec.abdroid.providers.tasks.\n. All the icons are happy again :)\n. The issue is the following:\nWhen the phone shuts down it triggers airplane mode and a few other items.\nAfter the reboot Tasker waits for the intent from XPrivacy and only then enables radios etc.\nThe issue is that after a Tasker update, it has somehow moved down in the boot order to the point that the intent is sent from XPrivacy before is able to accept it.\n. :(\n. you're a genius ;)\n. Just for the record, using this will cause the alarm to trigger if there is no service available.\n. what I meant by service was telephone network connectivity. If the phone is currently out of service range the value %SIMNUM can't be read which would trigger the 'Alarm', the reason why we are checking for the value in the first place. An alternative is to check for %DEVTID and set a custom IMEI in XPrivacy for Tasker. This value is available even is there is no SIM card installed in the device.\n. a workaround: capture a log during shutdown and then add the entries into the database, if you need hep with the proper commands, let me know.\n. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nolanlawson.logcat\n. Same issue here. UID 1000 is not restricted, no usage data, debug log (https://gist.github.com/an0n981/541f3cdbd6906d091f16) does not contain any entries\n. Nothing is restricted for UID 1000, as well as no usage data. Restrict system components is checked, all other system components are properly restricted. Last known working version for me was 3.6 (haven't updated in a while). Also same issue verified on a Nexus 5 with Omni 4.4.4\n. I have downgraded to 3.6.2 then updated 3.5, 3.6.6.1, 3.9. The only version where UID 1000 is not restricted with no usage data is 3.6.9.\nI am also still using XPosed 2.6.1 from May 2014.\nCould this commit be the reason?\n. I confirm that the issue is resolved\n. Confirm 3.6.16 fixes this\n. Same issue here, privacy version mismatch. Restrictions were working \n. As you previously mentioned, I didn't have the original problem. I only tested the 6-1 update, where the version mismatch happened. If you think it might benefit, I can test the -2 update.\n. @Vankog you have to add this to build.prop: xprivacy.options=ignoreselinux\nVersion 3.6.16 BETA\nFixed crash on clear cache (flush) on Lollipop\nFixed translation of isolated process uids (debug info)\nReading property\u00a0xprivacy.options=ignoreselinux\u00a0from\u00a0/system/build.prop\u00a0to ignore SELinuxSettings this property enables reading of these files again, but might result in a bootloop for some:/data/system/xprivacy/disabled/data/system/xprivacy/aosp\nThis file can be created/deleted by toggling the main setting\u00a0AOSP mode\n. \n. What I mean is that the green key (1) only shows up if one of the original functions (2) (before you added the additional functions) needs access. This becomes an issue when users restrict the entire category based on the (lack of) green key\n\n. I was teaching a new user about XPrivacy today and explained to him that if the category has a green key than at least one of the functions needs access, which is then indicated by a green key when the category is expanded. (Is this correct?) The storage category doesn't always follow this logic. From what I could gather the category key only shows up if one of the 'original' functions needs access.\n. Then I have at least 40 apps on my phone where this is displayed incorrectly. Also if I filter on permission and storage category those apps are not shown in the app overview\n. *Impossible\n.

That's the thing, 10033 is not the UID in question, 10230 is\n. @M66B Do I read this correctly that in compatibility mode this method is only hooked on SDK 19 and above?\nmListHook.add(new Hook(\"messages\", \"getAllMessagesFromIcc\", \"RECEIVE_SMS\", 10, null, null).notAOSP(19));\n. Also, another app that uses such a method is WhatsApp during the registration process. However, from I have read here the way incoming SMS are handled was changed in SDK 19. Meaning this issue can only be properly tested on a 4.3 device.\nFrom what I understand this method\nmListHook.add(new Hook(\"messages\", Telephony.Sms.Intents.SMS_RECEIVED_ACTION, \"RECEIVE_SMS\", 1, null, null));\nis only available starting with SDK 19 and can only be used by the default SMS app, which in this case is 'Conversations' (com.sonyericsson.conversations). This method is not available for API 18 and lower according to the Android Developer website.\n@define: Could you test this with WhatsApp, see if WhatsApp can 'intercept' the registration sms with the entire Messaging category restricted. (If you already use WhatsApp be sure to backup your messages using the in app backup option so that you can restore these later, then delete WhatsApp data in the Android settings app)\n. I will try to find a 4.3 based rom for my device and try to reproduce the issue\n. The good news is I can reproduce the issue on Slim 4.3 with the latest version of WhatsApp. The bad news is this issue has been around for quite some time, I tested all stable version back to 2.0, none were able to prevent the registration.\n. I have an idea that I wanted to test but I am getting compile errors :(\n. Copied via context menu on XDA. It redirects to http://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/unofficial-xposed-samsung-lollipop-t3113463. Give me a minute. I'll update\n. Tracking based purely on power supply monitoring:\nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/technology-31587621\n. Look at the commit, it actually has nothing to do with Samsung\n. Grey is also when changing any restriction, not just onDemand\n. Yes\n. http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=58828974&postcount=1\n. I am confused. The original issue as discribed by @kaizokan is that with a function set as [ ] [ x ] and adding an onDemand popup to blacklist does not prevent opening. I have just tested on an AOSP rom using the Gallary app and cannot confirm his/her findings. The Storage/Open onDemand works just fine no matter how the restrictions are set and whether I allow/deny once or add white/blacklist entry....\nAnd then you guys kind of lost me with the rest.\nI honestly don't see a bug or anything that should be changed.\nFAQ 34 describes beautifully how function restrictions work.\n. I cannot find your original post regarding this. The discussion was quite some time ago. But IMHO and the way you described it back then is that black/white lists should remain intact, even if the restriction is unchecked. For example I may have an app set to [ ] [x] because it is a dangerous system app and in case of an onDemand while Sleeping=true. Since it is dangerous I want onDemand to be allowed in this case. However I have already blacklisted items that should not be allowed.\n. that is a much better link.\n. ",

I did and then it worked - no bootloop. My only modules are XPrivacy and rovo89's smiley replacer and since I've had this problems for a few weeks and I started using the smiley replaces three days ago, I assume it is related to XPrivacy.\nAfter being able to boot when the modules were off, rovo89 told me to contact you.\n. @kosique In my opinion, one should never play around with things like this without nandroid backups. I never flash a nightly and I never update the framework or XPrivacy without first making a backup. In this case, the worst that seems to happen is a bootloop. Since it is related to /system, one could just format /system and re-flash the rom, resulting in no data loss since user data is stored on /data. In case one happens to restrict a system app, one could either flash the Xposed disabler @rovo89 mentions, format /system and re-flash the rom ( = removes the Xposed framework) or, in the worst case, remove the Xprivacy folder in /data using adb in recovery. Please note that I haven't tried the latter solution, though. As always: make a backup before trying anything like that.\nNonetheless, inexperienced users might find your suggestion useful and, according to me, the easier things are, the better :)\nIn summary, to me, this bug is not serious since it is not dangerous, although inexperienced users could find get problems. It is just annoying because it takes so much longer to update a rom.\n. I think I was using PAC at the time. Now I'm using Paranoid Android again, which doesn't include cLock. If you want, I could wipe my phone (resulting in a less messy logcat?), update once more and send you a new logcat?\n. According to your conversation in the end, it seems it could be related to Play Services + Google Now. I can confirm that 1.0.18 does not solve the bootloop issue for Paranoid Android that was mentioned yesterday on xda. Play Services version: 4.0.33\n. I completely uninstalled Xprivacy 1.0.18 rebooted, installed 1.10 stable, rebooted, updated Google Search and ended up in a bootloop\n. Android restrictions disabled also bootloops.\n@GhostlyCrowd What version of Google Search?\n. Content provider disabled boots normally with the latest Google Search\n. Usage data disabled also bootloops.\nI have tested these four versions on my Galaxy Nexus running Paranoid Android (Android 4.3) with Google Search 3.1.8.914827.arm and Google Play Services 4.0.33. In summary:\n1.10 stable - bootloop\nAndroid restrictions disabled: http://d-h.st/SmH - bootloop\nContent provider disabled: http://d-h.st/eKv - boots normally\nUsage data disabled: http://d-h.st/OnO - bootloop\n. According to me, it seems to affect Paranoid Android according to my own experiences and the thread on xda. And some PAC users seem too have this problemlem too. \n. I sent the logcat to you via e-mail, @M66B However, the log was just about 200 kb, so I don't know if I did anything wrong. I just ran \"adb logcat > log.txt\". If I should use some specific parameters, please tell me.\nProcedure:\n1. Uninstall \"real\" Xprivacy and reboot.\n2. Install the logging version of Xprivacy, enable it in Xposed and reboot.\n3. Update Google Search and open Xprivacy afterwards in order to make sure it's running (no settings were changed in Xprivacy). Also checked under Settings - Apps that Google Search was successfully updated.\n4. Reboot and decrypted the device\n5. Run \"adb logcat > log.txt\"\nIf I should have done it in another way, please let me know.\nEdit: I let the logcat run for about 5 minutes, and considering the time, the size feels a little small.\n. What interpretation do you make? If that is somehow related to the settings on my phone, that should no longer be a problem because restoring my nandroid didn't work :P Currently, my phone wiped (/data). So if you want me trying something else before restoring all apps with Titanium, please tell me.\n. @M66B I suppose that means no special framework either? I.e. I should not install Xposed?\n. It should be on your e-mail.\nProcedure:\n1. Format /system (in order to completely get rid of Xposed, Cerberus etc and reflashed Paranoid Android + Gapps.\n2. Wipe /data (except /data/media)\n3. Boot and add Google-account\n4. Update Google Search (3.1.8.914827.arm) and Play Services (4.0.33 (910055-36)) only through Play Store\n6. Set up Google Search\n7. Make sure usb debugging was enabled. Other than that, no system settings were changed.\n7. Reboot and grab a logcat\nI ended the logcat once the phone had booted.\n. My phone boots with the latest Google Search now! \nThank you so much, @M66B! \n. Ok, sorry! The first window shows the list with all apps. Pressing that one takes me to the list with all apps. The other window shows the setting list of the specific app whose permissions I'm changing. Pressing that one takes me to the permission settings page. So I suppose everything is the way they're supposed to? :)\n. What I was trying to say is that I would like to see the list of permissions, which is shown in the Play Store right before installing an app, in XPrivacy as well as the green keys that are already there. I.e, the list of permissions that can be found under Settings - Apps -  which looks like this: \nCertain apps can access certain functions that are located in, for instance, the Location category without having declared location permissions in the Android manifest. Then I could have a look at the list of permissions to see if the app really has access to location permissions or not and if it hasn't (and doesn't need them), restrict them.\nI would find it useful to see the list of permissions directly in the XPrivacy instead of having to go to Settings - Apps or open the Play Store. I would find it useful if this list was placed on a page of app specific settings. Say, that I want to change restrictions for app A. Then I open XPrivacy, find app A in the list and tap on it. A new page opens with the app's icon, package name and under them the app's restrictions. I'd like to see the list of permissions on this page, together with the green keys. Perhaps the list of permissions could be added between the package name and the restriction? Hidden by default and can be shown by pressing a button?\n. Yes, I know, that is what I meant by \"this is a request for lazy people\" :) I just think it would be easier if it was available in XPrivacy and since XPrivacy is much about permissions, it would be natural to have such a list there in my opinion.\n. @M66B in this case it was UCCW (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.vineetsirohi.customwidget). UCCW might need access to it in order to be able to show certain things, but it made me think that other apps that don't need it may use it as well. I've seen certain office apps use them too.\nThis permission doesn't seem to be very common, though.\n. ",

    "amishmm": "I just got PRO version from you.\nBut this feature is not working. I am using latest nightly of LegacyXperia CM10.2 Android 4.3.\nWhen I click export, it directly writes in /sdcard/.xprivacy/XPrivacy.xml\nIt overwrites it everytime without asking for confirmation.(If you accidentally happen to touch \"Export\" the old exported setting is overwritten)\nI installed OI File manager but it seems its not calling OI File manager. (However it shows popup to save to google drive or so)\nIf you import, again it automatically imports without asking for filename/directory. (I hope clicking on  import twice will not cause duplicate entries or something internally)\nAlso a suggestion, filename should not be hour dependent. It should be XPrivacy-YYYYMMDDHHMMss.xml\nThis way I can test things easily making sure I have backup of latest \"stable\" settings. Or I can revert back easily one by one in reverse order.\n. But I have installed OI File Manager. I even rebooted after installing OI File Manager.\nStill its not asking me for file name.\nDo I have to do some settings? I searched in XPrivacy as well as OI File manager but could not find anything.\n. Oh wait sorry. The files are there!!!\nI was under impression that it will ask me for filename. But I didnt realize that it will NOT ask for name but its still storing as per above naming convention.\nSorry for causing confusion. Its working as expected.\n. Ok I was going through code (I have not fully understood it) but I failed to understand why do u need OI File Manager for exporting?\nBut I think you can eliminate requiring OI File Manager.\nIn line 74 of src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/ActivityShare.java\n    exportTask.executeOnExecutor(mExecutor, new File(fileName));\nIf you change it to,\n    exportTask.executeOnExecutor(mExecutor, new File(getFileName(true)));\nIt should eliminate need for OI File Manager for exporting.\nLine 63:\nString fileName = (extras.containsKey(cFileName) ? extras.getString(cFileName) : getFileName(false));\ncan be moved inside //Import if() statement.\nAgain I have not fully understood the code but to me it appears right way which will not require OI File Manager for exporting.\nFor importing, I think android File Manager works.\nIf you want I can create pull request.\n. No no I am not asking you to remove support for OI File manager. OI File manager comes in to picture only for importing.\nWhat I am saying is that, if you dont have OI File Manager, and then u try to export, then File name does not have XPrivacy_yyyyMMdd_HHmmss.xml format.\nIf you change the code as I mentioned above (assuming I understood it right) then filename will be exported in XPrivacy_yyyyMMdd_HHmmss.xml format even if OI FIle Manager is not installed which I think is right way,\n. Ok this is lengthy but let me explain.\nFirst of all forget my above code changes which I suggested. I realized that related code is in ActivityMain.java and not ActivityShare.java\nThis is original request (from 1st post of this ticket).\n1) can you name the created file with a HH-DD/MM/YY name (- you solved this)\n2) can you not overwrite the previously exported files config ? so we can have an exported files history. (1 automatically solves this as well)\n3) can we choose the file we would like to import (this needs file manager, CM File Manager, OI File manager, Google Drive, File Manager by rhmsoft etc. work)\nNowhere he has asked for OI File manager.\nI have Google drive, CM File manager and File manager by rhmsoft. Assume that currently I have not installed OI File manager.\nThe problem is here: line 811 file ActivityMain.java (function optionsExport())\n    boolean multiple = Util.isIntentAvailable(ActivityMain.this, Intent.ACTION_GET_CONTENT);\nNow even if CM File Manager, Google Drive, File Manager by rhmsoft support \"choosing a file\" for import, somehow above line returns false. So your code stores exports in file Xprivacy.xml.\nNow I install OI File manager\nOI File manager turns that line to true and code exports file as XPrivacy_yyyyMMdd_HHmmss.xml\nNow I want to import the file.\nNow lets see line 818 in function optionImport()\nif (Util.isIntentAvailable(ActivityMain.this, Intent.ACTION_GET_CONTENT)) {\n    Intent chooseFile = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_GET_CONTENT);\nSince this function is true due to existence of OI File Manager, you will realize that the \"popup\" shows you not just OI File manager, but also CM file manager, Google drive, and rhmsoft file manager.\nSee images, all three are allowing me to \"pick / choose a file\". (that is when I click Import)\n\n\n\n\n1st pic: XPrivacy first asks me which importer to choose (Drive, CM File manager, etc.)\n2nd pic: CM File manager asking me to pick a file for importing\n3rd pic: Google drive asking me to pick a file for importing\n4th pic: Rhmsoft file manager asking me to pick a file for importing\nClearly those file managers also allow you to choose file for importing. But isIntentAvailable() returns false somehow.\nAlso it is safe to assume that person who installs Xposed framework / Xprivacy definitely has good file manager installed.\nSo I think its safe to assume that File can always be exported safely in XPrivacy_yyyyMMdd_HHmmss.xml without checking for isIntenetAvailable().\nIt will be very rare that person installing Xposed framework and Xprivacy does not have above or equivalent file manager which does not allowing choosing a file.\n. I am sorry to tell you that I have not setup anything on my PC related to android development. So I can not check if it has fixed it because I can not generate APK.\nI read the code on github and try to debug by imagination! :)\nIf you can generate APK and give me link then i would gladly test it.\n. Nope. Not working with 1.9.10 its saving file as XPrivacy.xml i.e. date strings.\nStill needs OI File manager.\n. In your latest FIX you may have to use GET_INTENT_FILTERS instead of flag 0\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/PackageManager.html#GET_INTENT_FILTERS\nOR \nSee this it suggests use of PackageManager.GET_ACTIVITIES whereas in your earlier code you had used PackageManager.MATCH_DEFAULT_ONLY.\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/11679996/pick-a-file-using-intent-action-get-content\n. Nope not working as well.\nYou have not used one line from that example.\nintent.setType(\"file/*\");\nDont know if its really needed.\n. Finally it worked!!\nGreat work. No more dependent only on OI File manager.\nIt appears that setType was the one missing.\nAnd whatever is default for setType (when not used) was defined by OI File manager as available intenet and hence it was working not the rest.\nBut now with file/* all of them work!\nThanks.\n. You dont need to thank everytime! :) What you are doing far outweighs my translation.\n. Suggested solution:\n1. Have import license option in settings\n2. After import it can be stored in say /data/xprivacy/ (optionally delete file from sdcard after import)\n3. Change owner and group of /data/xprivacy to that of XPrivacy app itself.\n4. XPrivacy should look for it in /data/xprivacy/ instead of (or in addition to) /sdcard\n5. (Optional) If valid license exists in /sdcard/ (but not in /data/xprivacy) then it may prompt user to import and then delete it.\nIf user uninstalls XPrivacy or wipes data. He can easily re-import it. (Obviously we assume that he has taken backup)\n. Sorry about not noticing already existing issue. I did check if issue was already there. But possibly overlooked its existence. (Or may be git cache did not show it somehow)\nWell if user uninstalls it, that means he no more wants to use XPrivacy (or temporarily does not want it)\nPlus it would not be tough to re-import it.\n. In that case after clearing data, XPrivacy should be put in \"?\" (ask mode) for each permission. (atleast for user apps). Or atleast for privacy related permissions (Accounts / Contacts / GPS)?\n.

    "danielmmmm": "Yes, I was aware of that. I thought you could move the file into the\nright directories. When I forked your repository, the Norwegian\nfolders did not exist yet, and I don't know how to update my fork to\nmatch your current version.\nOn 7/23/13, Marcel Bokhorst notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nUnfortunately you have now translated English in Norwegian.\nYou should update the strings in values-nb-rNO, values-nn-rNO,\nvalues-no-rNO\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/pull/328#issuecomment-21406466\n. Oh, sorry you had to do this! I actually updated the translation to match your newest beta (1.7.28) just a few minutes ago. How long does it usually take for a merge to show up in your repository? Right now, the strings are not up to date there ...\n\nOn another note, could you integrate the Wiki-links (when clicking on the exclamation mark next to a method) into the strings.xml or a separate wiki.xml? On an \"old\" phone like our Mango, opening the browser can take a while (I use Opera as default). In my mind, this should be an easy task, but I can't do it without help. I tried to figure this out myself, and I think I get how you open internet links, but I do not know how you create pop-ups like the one that appears when you click on the question mark. (I am not a programmer)\nI could gather information on what the methods do, so that people know what they are tinkering around with. Although it would take quite a while, since I am busy at work. Doing this as a group effort with help from the forum would probably be the best solution.\nAnd another question: How do I easily find out which new strings you added for a new XPrivacy version? So far I copy new strings.xml into a text editor and compare it manually against my old version.\nAnd still not finished ;-D Contrarily to my policy (after having had trouble with beta-ROMs), I tried out your latest beta, and I like it so far. After the initial start of XPrivacy, the app list gets populated very quickly and browsing apps is snappy! Thanks a lot for this huge improvement!\n. Oh, and I just realized, that integrating the methods Wiki would be a lot of work, so feel free to just say no to the proposal ;-)\n. Thanks for the explanation, I will try it out soon! :-)\nAnd yes, I realized how much work integrating the Wiki would be after I send my message. Especially since the Wiki links to other sources with explanations that span several pages.\n. Oh, I didn't realize that this has been discussed before.\nAt least for me, it would be much better to open the configuration dialog for the app that was notified, regardless of whatever else XPrivacy was doing before the user clicked on the notification. Otherwise, the notifications are completely useless to me for the reason given in the report ... \nIs there a way to disable the notifications, other than removing them manually from the notification area?\n. Sorry, but I don't see any disabled check boxes, neither in the app list, nor in the settings for a single app. It doesn't matter what filter I have activated. Only when no filter is selected do I see disabled check boxes in the app list. But there are apps where the check box is not disabled, and they have mixed categories, so I don't get why they are displayed differently than other apps. I am also not interested to see which app contains mixed categories (almost all my apps do!), but which categories contain mixed functions.\nAnd maybe I didn't explain good enough what exactly should be fixed (in my opinion). I agree that XPrivacy should remember the mixed functions within a category or the mixed categories within an app, and upon un-checking and re-checking a category, only the previously checked functions should be checked again while the previously un-checked functions should remain un-checked. But, all still want to see which app contains categories and which category contains functions that are a mixture of checked and un-checked. This is all I am asking for, and it is important for security and privacy reasons. There are too many categories and people usually have too many apps installed to manually open every single category in order to check whether all functions are checked or not. Every time a new (\"important\") function is implemented, it will be un-checked and it is impossible to check a single function for all apps. This is only possible with whole categories and then we have the \"problem\" with mixed content again. Arrrggg, the missing tri-state check boxes are killing me.\nCouldn't something like the solutions on the bottom of the following link solve the problem?\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/1263323/tristate-checkboxes-in-java\nLike I said before, I accept when you say that introducing tri-state check boxes is too much work and you won't do it, and I do not request a change in XPrivacy's behavior, but I remain stubborn when it comes to visualizing the current state of a category! Visualization is easy to implement and since it is most important for categories, it can be skipped for apps and therefore should not slow down XPrivacy.\nAnd sorry for such a long monologue ;-)\n. Wow, nice to see this happening :-D\nI agree that some people might not understand what these blue squares mean, but I am sure that many people do. At least in Windows, these check boxes are quite common (in Linux maybe as well, but I don't know).\nSince XPrivacy remembers the state of the functions, cycling through the three states doesn't do harm and I am sure people will understand quickly.\nAnd as stated before, this is most important in the details view of an app, to see which categories have checked and un-checked functions.\n. Wow, looks nice :-)\nMaybe the squares should be gray instead of blue? I noticed that you cannot change the state of these boxes and blue makes them look as one could interact with them.\nIs there any chance that you introduce those squares to the detailed app view as well? To me, it is much more important to see the status of categories (containing functions) within an app, than the status of the app (containing categories) itself.\n. Ah, OK. I just read tony78960's post on XDA and it looks like he will implement this sometime in the future :-)\n(too occupied with work to follow the forum closely ;-)\nThis is really good news, thanks to the two of you!\n. Awesome, I am also looking forward to this :-D\nThanks!\n. Thanks a lot!\n. Will you also allow dangerous methods in the future? This is actually something I'd like to see even more than allowing dangerous categories ;-)\n. I think he is talking about this issue: https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/issues/716\n\"Internet\" is missing, because it is regarded as a critical category and therefore not allowed to be set in the template (the same is true for \"critical\" modules inside categories). It looks like we might get more power over apps in the not so distant future ;-)\n. The point of a comment function was not so say \"I am right and my settings are the only good ones\", that would be childish! But when I can leave a comment like \"Internet can be restricted if cloud functionality is not needed, but the method XYZ has to be unrestricted or the app will show an error message\", people can decide for themselves.\nBut it's OK like it is now. Sheep will get what sheep deserve.\n. As I wrote in the XDA forum, I think the problem is that the default values are composed of zeros. Those zeros are interpreted as NULL by some apps (like Sygic GPS Navigation), and not as a string with a certain number of zero characters.\n. What about other settings than latitude/longitude?\n. Yes, I realized that on my way to work :-)\nThe UI of XPrivacy can be tricky ...\n. \"Randomize on access\" sounds good. Is a 3\" screen really too small? Since it is only displayed once, I would even accept two lines for this.\nThe \"Randomize\" button is a typical Android issue for me. I wasn't aware that the values are not saved when the OK button is not pressed. Does pressing the back button discard everything? I doubt that everyone is aware of that since the back button is handled differently in different apps. There are probably Google guidlines, but they are worthless when there are so many apps that disobey them...\n. Then how about a \"Cancel\" button? (Yes, I am aware that this would cost some real estate again ;-)\n. Yes, in XPrivacy. In other apps, Back key = OK. This is a very bad design choice in Android. But who cares ...\n. How do you know that? Sygic GPS Navigator does not work with an all zero digits IMEI! (see posting on XDA)\n. I meant \"random on access\", not randomize with the randomize button. Still happening on 1.13 for me ...\n. Ah, I thought it was disabled to prevent user input, but it would still display the random data. Well well ...\n. Oh wow, what a shock! This seriously breaks XPrivacy for me :-(\nHow are we supposed to find the most restrictive setting when going back and forth is impossible? Am I the only one who tries to find the maximum restriction?!\nBtw., this is what I call \"difficult\" and what makes me think that opening issues here is frustrating. At least someone else has the same point of view as I do (#804). The notifications are nice, but they are just the start of a longer process and therefore completely irrelevant to me (and probably less important to people who are really concerned about privacy and not just use XPrivacy to salve their conscience). Sincerely hope you (or someone else) will fix this some time in the future...\n. Working very well! From \"wontfix\" to \"lowprio\" to \"fixed\" to \"released apk\" in just a few minutes! Thanks a lot, you managed to make a \"complainy\" user happy!\n. Good question and here are 3 mock-ups: http://i39.tinypic.com/34h83kx.png that hopefully provide an answer.\nThey should not interfere with the colouration of dangerous categories. The one in the middle is my favourite since this is the most visible but least intruding.\nI assume the colour bars would be easy to add (drawing the UI and saving as app preference), while the user interface to add them would require much more work (long-press action and colour picker) ...\nGlad you like the idea :-D\n. Yes, I think some given colours would be good enough. Especially \"green\" is something I miss, since all non-greens would automatically be in the yellow or red category. Three colours would be wonderful indeed.\n. Yes, a different shade of green/orange seems to be a good idea. Maybe something lighter, like the green I used? Blue could also be an alternative to red or orange as it would be more neutral and not an immediate warning signal. \nDo I understand correctly, that one can only mark apps green by submitting ones own settings for an app? Or was it the other way around, that apps get marked green, when settings from the cloud have been applied?\nLike I said, three states would be sufficient, and that can be achieved with two colours and transparent.\n. Sounds reasonable. But forcing us to submit settings also sounds scary. What if I want to mark apps, when I don't have an internet connection or blocked XPrivacy in my firewall? Don't get me wrong, I would contribute (even though I doubt the usefulness of the cloud service), but I would like to decide myself when I submit data and when not.\n. Alright, solid and useful ... another feature I am really looking forward too! :-D\nThank you guys for all the work you put into this great piece of software!\n. Yes they are because they appear much brighter against the dark background and green and gray are clearly distinguishable. (edit: I only checked for visibility and not for aesthetics ;-)\n. @jpeg729:\n1) Yes, everything is fine, as long as one leaves on demand on. But wouldn't it be better to have it the other way around? People who leave on demand on wouldn't see a difference, and paranoid weirdos like me would be happy. The possibility of granting all requests by mistake (be it by me or a bug in XPrivacy) seems very scary to me!\n2) I tried it with an app that force closes when \"load library\" is restricted. When I allow \"load library\" and set the app to \"request on demand\", it FCs nicely when I deny the request for this function. When I wait for the pop-up to disappear on its own, the app does not FC. I don't know what happened internally, but to me this looks a lot like the function was allowed.\n3) banderos101's comment sounds reasonable to me.\nI would also not display the question mark next to blocked functions/categories. When I allow something, and \"request on demand\" is activated, I would expect the question mark to appear again (just a personal preference).\nBut, could you replace the \"Check to restrict:\" check box by a \"restrict on demand:\" check box? I am talking about the check box below an app's icon in the app view, which is superfluous anyway due to \"clear\" in the settings menu.\n. Nice, the test version does exactly what I would expect! I like the way you handled the automatic denial, where the question mark remains for the (automatically) denied function. And allowing manually disabled functions (like from my template) is also working like a charm!\nThanks a lot!\n. Ah, I saw that in \"one of the system apps that actually consists of several apps\".\nI will think about it and see how this could be handled without too much coding. Currently, the landscape view is unusable :-(\nLooking forward to the slimed down release!\n. Wow, always surprising how quick you are :-) \nThe colour is OK, but I would use \"bold\" to make the number more visible (I think my Droid 4 is a hdmi device). If the numbers collide with the filter, then I can make it a little smaller.\nIf you don't mind, then I would like to propose a re-design of the UI in the next few days. Nothing crazy, but I think the UI deserves some thinking with all the new functionality of XPrivacy :-) \n. I like the new pop-up window with information much better than opening the browser immediately.\nThe background colour is a little on the crazy side though :-) How would it look if the background was plain white in the bright theme and maybe a light grey in the dark theme? The same would apply to the tutorial.\nHm, I will try out \"Android Studio\" and see if this can give me a preview of the layout. Then I could fool around with stuff, without bothering you ;-)\n. Well, when an app gets unrestricted/restricted in the main app view, it might not be clear what is supposed to be restarted.\nBut it's not a big deal anyways :-)\n. Doesn't work for me either. In general, I cannot use most of the UI elements (scroll the app name, use the category filter, ...)\n. No problem, I just tried out Android Studio and it turned out to be as complicated as I thought it would :-)\nThe margins around the content and between the \"menu icons\" could still be reduced or eliminated, in my opinion. All clickable elements are far enough away from the screen to be a problem. Also, other apps (like Link2SD and AFWall+) do not use any margins and (to me) this looks much better and it improves the UI a lot to have more space for the content.\nHow about simply renaming \"Clear all data\" to \"Clear all restrictions\"? I actually confused clear all data with usage data for the apps and accidentally deleted my restrictions ... (of course I had a backup from frequent exports of the restrictions).\nHm, it seems to be easy to compile an apk with Android Studio ... I hope you don't mind me messing with XPrivacy, when I am bored ;-)\n(But don't worry, before I make more crazy pull requests, I will try out XPrivacy on my phone first ... and I will most likely lose interest when the excitement wears off :-)\n. Yes, 'Clear all XPrivacy data' would do the trick!\nHm, now I have to get Eclipse ... and GTalk :-)\nIt's so tempting to do stuff yourself, but I am not capable of more than scripting ... and there is so little time to learn something new... well, better stop crying and start doing!\n. Can a restriction of any of the functions in the ipc category cause GPS to malfunction? I opened a new issue (#1455) about this, and GPS status is one of the apps that gets denied access to ipc functions.\nI got GPS to work once in v1.99.54, but then I updated to 1.99.56 and now no app is able to even get the phone to look for satellites. The apps see that GPS is enabled, but the GPS icon in the notification bar is not blinking. Testing is extremely difficult and I cannot spend the whole day restoring nand-backups... and Android itself is doing its best to complicate things even more (you might remember from the Xperia Mini Pro thread how much I dislike Android ;-).\nSometimes, I saw libgps errors in logcat, complaining about a sentence that is not ending with \\r\\n, but I don't know if that was caused by XPrivacy ...\n. OK, I will torture my phone and me with restoring nand-backups today :-)\n. No, my Xperia Mini Pro is slowly rotting away since I bought a Droid 4 :-)\n(I still hate companies for producing Android phones with less than 2 CPU cores and 1 GB RAM!)\nAlso, this issue is not over yet! I will produce logs as quickly as you close issues! ;-D\nBut seriously, I think I narrowed it down to restrictions on demand. After clearing all restrictions (of uid 1000) and having \"restrict on demand\" on and re-booting, all functions are allowed (if allowed in the pop-up). After re-booting again, the non-restricted functions (or some of them) are restricted!\nHere are some more logcats taken during boot and until I could confirm that GPS is working or not: http://uppit.com/tytlvf27ppga/Drive_C.7z\nMost interesting are probably all logcat_c files:\nlogcat_c_boot-with-1.99.53-restrict-on-demand-ON-and-all-system-restrictions-cleared.txt\nBefore the re-boot, I cleared restrictions of system apps and switched restrict on demand on.\nAfter booting, GPS was available (search for \"GPS satellites:\").\nlogcat_c_boot-with-1.99.53-restrict-on-demand-ON-2nd-boot\nBefore the re-boot, I did not change anything!\nAfter booting, GPS was not accessible (you won't find \"GPS satellites:\" in the log).\nlogcat_c_boot-with-1.99.53-restrict-on-demand-ON-3nd-boot-uid1000-reset\nBefore the re-boot, I removed all restrictions for uid1000 and made sure that the restrict on demand question mark is displayed!\nAfter booting, GPS was available again.\nlogcat_c_boot-with-1.99.53-restrict-on-demand-ON-4nd-boot\nBefore the re-boot, I did not change anything!\nAfter booting, GPS was not accessible any more.\nIt might also take some time after booting until GPS gets accessible again. I have to test this and see how long I have to wait until GPS works, after the lock screen appears. In the above tests, I waited at least until the phone connected to a GSM network, which seems to be one of the last things the phone does before the OS is loaded completely.\n. When I cleared restrictions and re-booted, I simply granted access to whole categories (without waiting for the time-out!). Shouldn't this persist when I re-boot?\nAnd why is XPrivacy asking me about ipc restrictions, when it cannot deny them on my ROM? It seems to know when an ipc function is requested. (I am using an official CM10.2 nightly without modifications)\nSorry, but this one is really driving me nuts ...\nEdit: Another thing is that the question mark next to uid 1000 disappears after re-booting, while it remains next to all other apps. It looks like restrict on demand is disabled for uid 1000. I am using 1.99.57 now and these last test versions have been a nightmare for me.\n. I noticed, that uid 1000 does not have restrict on demand in its settings dialog. This might make sense, but the global restrict on demand seems to mess things up. I will try out some other things, but this takes time because I need to re-boot my phone very often :-(\n. Did you read my posting on XDA? Disabling XPrivacy for uid1000 solved my problem. But this indicates that there is something wrong with XPrivacy, because uid1000 was completely unrestricted all the time and it still caused some malfunction.\nAlso, does this change the situation for ipc on my ROM? How do I know if ipc restrictions work or not?!\n. I am using version 1.99.57 and 58 doesn't seem to have anything changed in that respect. Did you see that ipc is also not working in the logs where I had GPS working? How can I see in the logs myself if ipc restrictions are working or not?\nHow would a restriction hang between re-boots? I double checked and when I enable XPrivacy for uid1000, it displays the \"restriction on demand\" question mark immediately next to the uid1000 check box (restriction on demand is enabled globally in the XPrivacy settings). Could there be something wrong with my XPrivacy restriction database? Can I help you in any other way to hunt down the cause for the problem? I don't like the thought of \"some weirdness\" in an important app like XPrivacy ;-)\n. I believe you, but why do I have problems when uid1000 is \"activated\" but no function is restricted? And restricting with subsequent unrestricting all for uid1000 works after a re-boot, but then something breaks after the next re-boot.\nSo many sleepless nights! :-)\nAnd can you tel me how I see if ipc works or not? What do I have to look for in the logcats?\n. The ipc check would be interesting in the future for me because I want to update to CM11 as soon as they implement internal-external-SD-card swap ...\n. This is getting even weirder: My camera has location restricted, but when I open the camera app, I see the GPS symbol flashing before the camera takes over the screen. A floating logcat shows that libgps is reporting an invalid location for some seconds, then it reports that it got a GPS fix. Tomorrow I will try to find out if the real GPS coordinates are written to pictures.\nCan the camera app activate GPS and let the system get a fix, without getting the actuall GPS coordinates of the phone because it will use the fake ones from XPrivacy? Or is this connected to ipc not being restricted on my ROM? (I see location being restricted in XPrivacy)\nThis is slowly but surely worrying me now :-(\n. Here is the link: http://uppit.com/qa0di7jyx0l2/alogrec.2014-02-26-07-41-17.7z\nI was worried, because some system apps also show up in logcat and it is always the ipc category.\n. This logcat was from boot, but I cut away the beginning. I uploaded the complete version (starting some seconds before rebooting and logging until the boot process and loading all apps was finished).\nhttp://uppit.com/heb10ve15p4t/alogrec.7z\nThere is a second log in there after updating from 1.99.56 to 1.99.57.\n(in both logs, I tried to get GPS data at the end)\n. Ah, I'll try to make one ... never did that before, but I think I will figure out how to do it ...\n. In this case, would you be able to disable the ipc category? Or do we have to keep in mind that some settings are completely irrelevant? This would be very awkward, to be honest.\n. Ah, I learned something new again :-)\n. So there is no way to override this? I thought that the XPrivacy theme colours are independent of the ROM theme colours, which would make using the ROM theme selection colours likely to give funny results.\n(And sorry for bringing this up again, I couldn't find the posting on XDA any more)\n. Yes, but this way, instead of XPrivacy adjusting to the user, the users have to adjust to XPrivacy. XPrivacy is already disobeying the ROMs theme by choosing its own background colour. So where is the problem in using an independent selection colour as well?\nI looked at a couple of apps on my phone (Link2SD, Contacts, ES File explorer) and they either use the ROMs theme or they bring their own.\n. Too late for stable? Thanks to the nasty bootloop, the Norwegian language made it just in time :-D\nGreat to see that XPrivacy made it to 2.x!\n. Ah, I didn't know that this was a known problem. Too bad that it can't be fixed because this makes restrict-on-demand for the affected categories completely useless :-(\n. Offa, I should learn to program and make my own fork ...\n. Including the database? Why then does XPrivacy re-build the app list so often (which is the time consuming thing I am complaining about)?\n. Sorry, I meant that to be an option to be set in the settings window, not a change in XPrivacy's UI in general.\nIf you don't have time for these kind of things, how about closing the issue section?\n. This is not about making everyone happy. It would be an option that would have to be set actively by the conscious user.\nApart from that, the UI still needs an overhaul! There are too many items in the menu and duplications in the menu and the settings screen. The menu is so long that I have to scroll on my device with a 960px screen! Seriously?!\n. Like I said, I will try to improve my crappy programming skills and get more involved in the future. But during the next few months I have too many other things to do.\n. Thanks for those good words!\nI am sure that the world will look brighter soon, and I agree that the work of Marcel and Jpeg is priceless :-)\n. What would speak against having the on-demand check boxes always displayed, like the restriction boxes? As far as I can see, this wouldn't even cost us any screen real-estate, because all categories and functions are two-liners anyways.\nTo make things more consistent and easier to understand for n00bs, the black/white question mark from the app list could also be shown to the right of the on-demand checkbox in the app view (with minimal margins to not lose any more space). The on-demand checkbox should then also become a tri-state box with a question mark, filled with a blue square and empty. The setting \"Restrict on demand\" could be removed from the settings dialog.\nThe original proposal by an0n981 sounds a bit complicated to me (no offense an0n981 ;-)\n. I didn't give a 1+ yet because it is still unclear to me how this feature would be implemented. Marcel seems to be reluctant to implement the original proposal. Any comments on my approach?\n. 1+\n. Oh, in that case I misunderstood how the whitelist works.\nDo you mean to say that the whitelist only works when onDemand for connect is active?\nI thought I could allow connections to some IPs by whitelisting them, then disable onDemand for connect, and thereby allow connections to whitelisted IPs, while rejecting all other IPs without getting a pop-up? Otherwise, apps would always ask to connect to unwanted IPs and one would always have to \"deny for 15 seconds\".\n. Oh wow! I must be very ignorant to miss that. Thanks, this is extremely useful :-)\n. In my case, GravityBox is working without causing any problems. With XPrivacy enabled, CM gets stuck while booting and I never get past the CM boot animation. I suspect that a recent change in CM11 (nightlies and M7) causes trouble.\n. Oh my, you are hopeless ... completely hopeless ...\nBtw., the setting \"Apply to whole category\" also reverts to \"checked\" after a reboot.\n. You are hopeless from my point of view ... which could actually mean that you are normal and I am hopeless ;-)\nIt's just that issues sometimes get closed very quickly.\nI don't think I am complaining about a minor inconvenience. People are creatures of habit (I might be one of the worst). The pop-up defaulting to \"expert mode unchecked\" and \"whole category checked\" leads to me restricting or allowing whole categories and also skipping white/black-listing after a reboot, simply because I don't expect the current behaviour (this is not a concious decision!).\nIn my opinion, these options should be remembered, always and regardless of any other circumstances.\n.

I haven't read your comment yet ... now I did ... I think it's good to let people know how things look from your perspective!\nYour comments clearly shows that I failed to communicate the issue well enough!. It's still kind of frustrating to get an issue closed instantly with a response that one might perceive as hostile. I tend to react on these reactions in a peculiar way, as you now know (or remember from past incidents?). That's actually not very different from what you are doing (although more politely). Looks like we have similar reactions, unfortunately misguided by our different points of view or communication failures ;-D\nAnyways, I did not request this out of laziness and I thought it would help other (advanced) users as well, even though no one commented on this yet (someone has to be the first ;-).\nPS: I fully understand that you filter out invalid requests to minimize the time you spend on XPrivacy.\n. Thanks a lot! I appreciate it, and I hope that others do as well!\n. Just tested it and it works well :-D\nThanks again! I see that it is quite an extensive commit ... sorry for causing so much pain!\nApart from that, I had problems upgrading to the new beta. Usually, I install a new version and reboot immediately. This time, XPrivacy complained about not being activated in Xposed. I opened XPrivacy (as stated in the instructions for upgrading) and rebooted. It still didn't work! Only when I deactivated XPrivacy in Xposed, reactivated the module immediately and rebooted, would XPrivacy work again.\nDon't know if this was just a glitch or something more serious.\n. Ah, this time I really didn't wait ... I was too excited :-)\nGood to know that everything is fine!\n. Thanks for the explanation! And yes, I remember the notification problem.\nI found a solution and I will add it to the instructions. Apparently, when an app is launched by Tasker, it ignores (or deletes?) the activity stack. So one simply has to create a task that will launch XPrivacy and create a shortcut on the homescreen. This shortcut can replace the original launcher's shortcut and will always start on the main screen. Only downside is that it will force reloading apps when XPrivacy was left anywhere else than the main screen. But in this case, XPrivacy can be invoked using the task switcher instead of tapping the shortcut. This is all very confusing, but maybe somone else besides me finds it interesting ...\n. Done, it should be OK now :-)\n. It's looking good!\nAnd thanks for the extension with UIDs and all that!\n. Great! I was afraid I would be late as usual :-D\n. Alright, I will take a close look next time XPrivacy needs to update. Thanks for replying so quickly! :-)\n. I think I get that, but does it make sense? It is not obvious that the main settings are active when nothing is changed in the app settings.\nIf I want to disable randomize on access for one item for an app, would I have to check and uncheck the respective check box? What would happen to the other items, would they still use the main settings or would they suddenly use the app setting and disable randomize on access for the app? \nI'm not asking because I want to know, I am just afraid that things might be confusing. At least I cannot see which item is modified specifically for an app and which not. \nAlso, how do I disable randomize on acces for an app when it is enabled in the main settings? Checking and un-checking a check box will just disable app specific settings and go back to what the main settings say... \n. Alright, then I will think about an explanatory title :-)\n. As always, you are too fast :-D\nThank you for the explanation!\n. This would indeed be very helpful!\nThanks for considering it as an enhancement :-)\n. Holy ... I thought XPrivacy would simply execute an sql command. Can I as user do this instead of letting XPrivacy work its code?\n(seriously, I have to merge my template over night when the phone is connected to a power supply!)\n. Thanks for the link. Your documentation is very good!\nEssentially this means that I can fiddle around with SQL in recovery mode. Could XPrivacy do this during (before?) boot, or would this be problematic again due to timing restrictions during the boot process?\n. Alright, I am actually happy with the information the two of you provided!\nI wish you a pleasant and relaxed Christmas-evening!\n. The app name, since the icon has not loaded yet. I tried clicking on the empty space where the icon will appear eventually, but nothing happened.\n. Did you already publish this beta? I have 3.5.10 (460) installed.\nAlso, does this change mean that we won't be able to click the name of an app before all details were loaded? That would be unfortunate because it would slow down user interaction tremendously.\nTo bad that there was a problem with memory with caching switched on ...\n. Meaning greyed out apps will be clickable or meaning that clicks won't do anything? ;-)\n. Thanks a lot!\nI hope you are satisfied with your (not so new any more) project and that XPrivacy doesn't keep you too busy!\n. Good to hear that you like your project!\nAnd of course good to here (again) that you will continue to support us with XPrivacy!\n3.5.11 works perfectly well! Now I (and maybe some other users?) don't have to care about missing caching any more. Thanks!\n. Thanks! I am not that familiar with SQL commands, but I think I could figure out how to add the correct entries with SQLite Database Browser.\n. Alright, I'll try my luck with SQL :-)\n. Unfortunately it is only available as a paid app (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onemanleft.tilttolive2&hl=en).\nIf you think this is something serious, then I can buy you the latest Humble Mobile Bundle as a gift (https://www.humblebundle.com/mobile). Either the cheapest option, which includes the game in question, or the 4 USD option, in case you are interested in the other games (for your own amusement, not to test them against XPrivacy ;-).\n. Well, just buying that game is 1 USD. I would be fine with that.\n. I just sent you a link to redeem the game to your address at faircode.eu.\nHope you manage to reproduce the behaviour that I described. If not, I hope I can help you otherwise ...\n. Oh, I don't remember Humble Bundle being so difficult/privacy intruding.\nAnyways, sensor restrictions are not showing up in the XPrivacy usage data while running the game. Wouldn't sensors still show up if an app used native libraries? And what do native libraries \"look like\"? The app is allowed to load \"main\", but nothing else.\n. Strange ... it is unlikely that I will encounter another app that does this, but I will report it if I do.\n(Did you claim the Humble Bundle? If not, I could claim it and upload the app for you ... but that is just a suggestion...)\n. And it refused to run without Google+? I don't think I even have Google+ on my phone :-)\nWell, I will report when/if I find another app.\n. @kaizokan Thanks for reporting!\nI just tested this with the IntentFirewall and uninstalling an app. The result is the same, the intend PACKAGE_REMOVED was blocked, even though the function IntentFirewall was allowed and on-demand was deactivated.\nSince two white lists behave like this, it is statistically safe to say that all do ... says I, the biologist ;-P\n. @Cerberus-tm I think you have a good point there with your Chrome example.\nInstead of tinkering with the check boxes, could not the white list icon itself indicate that the white list contains data and is active? Maybe an empty white list could be white with a grey \"w\", as it is now, and then turn grey with a white \"w\" (or green or something else) when it is active.\n. ",

Will report here.\n. Yes, http://d-h.st/bOW works!!!! Thanks.\nBy the way, in previous version the biggest file that I was able to import successfully had 259kb (reported by Windows) or 252kb (reported by Android) and had about 2700 lines (entries).\n. I also managed to import settings with 1.7.27 after long, long time. First attempt was disaster - need reboot and restore XPrivacy from backup. For second attempt I kill every app I could and deleted all XPrivacy data before import. So, it is better now, but I'm now afraid to install any new app or change any restrictions.\nAnother thing: after importing, all accounts settings (\"Select accounts to allow\") are gone. I was under impression that export/import also preserve that info. Is this a bug or feature?\n. I understand the reasons to restrict clipboard from the security viewpoint, but except transferring passwords to other apps I don't see any reason to restrict copy & paste by default. In most user apps it is a real time saver, not mention typing errors.\nAny thoughts about moving clipboard restrictions into separate category and maybe enabling by default? Clipboard restrictions are now part of System category that already has many functions and enabling or disabling whole System category just because of clipboard is not viable. If clipboard functions are in separate category people who don't want it enabled by default can easily make change in template.\nNow I need to go thru many harmless apps and enable these 6 functions. This also increases size of my xml file which is already at the limit for my phone.\nCopy & paste is one of the best inventions, right after TV remote. :-)\n. I will unistall AFWall, try again and let you know the result. Do you need any data other than logcat?\n. Same thing after uninstallng AFWall+. \nThe app with ID 10051 is com.htc.HTCMediaCacheService. It has blocked the following:\naccounts\nbrowser\ncalendar\ne-mail\nidentification\nlocation\nNFC\n. I think I can restore backup faster than type adb commands. :-)\nI did it again, but this time I run fix permission and then run above quick fix before restart.\nThanks to quick fix calendar and contacts were preserved, but all other problems persist.\nLoading launcher, widgets etc. required 2.5 min complete and first \"xxxx has been granted superuser permissions\" notifications poped up 4 min after reboot. Next 1-2 minutes all apps that require root run this notification on the screen again and again - probably dozen times each.\nMy normal boot time is at least twice shorter and su granting notification messages appears only once.\nI also try to reboot and clear cache and dalvik cache but no improvement. Fixing permission screwed my system so badly that restore was only option. I'm using it very rarely and certainly will not use it again. If someone ask, my recovery is TWRP v2.6.0.0.\n. ",
    "rmenessec": "Restricting GSF with XPrivacy breaks Google account synchronization at present.\n. This is a great idea!\n. The wiki does not contain any information pertaining to my request. I still need to know what specific information to put into the Settings dialog to return specific information to apps requesting it. For instance, perhaps I want apps to think I'm using a Motorola phone on a fictitious wireless carrier in Iceland. How do I do that?\n. Also, on 1.7.25, something went wrong during import, and settings were not restored at all. Import did work on 1.7.26, but took a very long time.\n. Well, despite what I saw in the changelog for XPrivacy, nothing is asking me if I want to send usage data, and there's nothing under Settings controlling whether or not I'm receiving or sending usage data. I'm a Pro donator (direct donation; not Play Store). How do I NOT send XPrivacy usage data?\n. That's... really not the same thing at all. It's especially not the same thing at all because I don't submit or download restriction data.\n. It doesn't fix the bootloop. Pry-Fi is causing major issues that break most aspects of XPrivacy if the device ever does boot. Uninstalled Pry-Fi for now.\n. I was actually going to post and ask if XPrivacy could ever perform the functions that Pry-Fi does. But now Pry-Fi exists... if we can ever get these two apps working together.\n. 1.99.28 appears to be causing bootloops on its own, without Pry-Fi installed.\n. I actually don't restrict system-level applications like Pry-Fi at all. I ensure that all checkboxes are cleared and the enforcement toggle is off. It was bootlooping anyway. Is this definitely fixed with .29?\n. I'm not sure what your code is doing, but I'm not worried about having multiple on demand dialogs. I'm concerned that they're generated at all while the lockscreen is active.\n. http://cdn.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/nexusae0_Screenshot_2014-03-07-09-38-26.png\nSpecifically, the ro.product.* data, in this case. Might also be a good idea to include some of the ro.build strings and ro.board.platform. These are all identifying.\n. I was asking for this functionality for the reason made clear in this article.

XPrivacy peut restreindre les cat\u00e9gories d\u2019informations auxquelles une application peut acc\u00e9der. Pour cela, Il suffit de ne rien transmettre \u00e0 une application ou simplement de remplacer les informations sensibles par d\u2019autres.\nIl existe plusieurs cat\u00e9gories de donn\u00e9es qui peuvent \u00eatre restreintes, comme, \u00ab contacts \u00bb ou \u00bb localisation \u00bb... Par exemple, si vous limitez l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux contacts pour une application, cela se traduira par l\u2019envoi d\u2019une liste de contacts vide. De m\u00eame, en limitant l\u2019acc\u00e8s d\u2019une application \u00e0 votre position cela aura pour effet d\u2019envoyer une fausse position \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re.\nXPrivacy ne r\u00e9voque pas les permissions d\u2019une application, ce qui signifie que la plupart des applications continueront de fonctionner comme auparavant sans fermeture inopin\u00e9e. Il demeure deux exceptions \u00e0 cette r\u00e8gle : l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 Internet et \u00e0 l\u2019unit\u00e9 de stockage externe (carte m\u00e9moire SD) sont restreints par l\u2019interdiction formelle d\u2019y acc\u00e9der. Il n\u2019y a aucune autre fa\u00e7on de proc\u00e9der car ces autorisations sont g\u00e9r\u00e9es par Android d\u2019une mani\u00e8re un peu sp\u00e9ciale. Android subordonne la gestion des permissions du r\u00e9seau et syst\u00e8me de fichier \u00e0 Linux. XPrivacy simulera le mode hors-ligne (internet) et/ou une unit\u00e9 de stockage non mont\u00e9e, mais malgr\u00e9 cela quelques applications tenteront d\u2019y acc\u00e9der tout de m\u00eame et cela pourrait se traduire par une fermeture inopin\u00e9e de l\u2019application.\nSi la restriction d'une cat\u00e9gorie de donn\u00e9es pour une application entraine des probl\u00e8mes pour l'application, il est possible de permettre \u00e0 nouveau l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la cat\u00e9gorie de donn\u00e9es pour r\u00e9soudre le probl\u00e8me.\nPar d\u00e9faut, toutes les applications nouvellement install\u00e9es n'auront aucun acc\u00e8s aux cat\u00e9gories de donn\u00e9es, cela afin d\u2019\u00e9viter qu\u2019une nouvelle application ne laisse \u00e9chapper des donn\u00e9es. Juste apr\u00e8s l\u2019installation d\u2019une nouvelle application, XPrivacy vous demandera \u00e0 quelles cat\u00e9gories de donn\u00e9es vous souhaitez que l\u2019application puisse acc\u00e9der. XPrivacy est pourvu d\u2019un navigateur qui permet de rapidement activer ou d\u00e9sactiver l\u2019acc\u00e8s d\u2019une application \u00e0 certaines cat\u00e9gories de donn\u00e9es, par exemple, pour voir votre agenda. Il est \u00e9galement possible d\u2019\u00e9diter toutes les cat\u00e9gories de donn\u00e9es pour une application.\nPour vous aider \u00e0 d\u00e9tecter les fuites de donn\u00e9es potentielles, XPrivacy va surveiller toutes les tentatives des applications qui veulent acc\u00e9der \u00e0 vos informations sensibles. Pour chaque application, d\u00e8s l\u2019instant o\u00f9 donn\u00e9e aura \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9e, XPrivacy affichera un triangle d\u2019avertissement pr\u00e8s de la donn\u00e9e correspondante. Si une application a demand\u00e9 les permissions Android afin d\u2019acc\u00e9der aux donn\u00e9es d\u2019une cat\u00e9gorie alors une ic\u00f4ne de cl\u00e9 s\u2019affichera.

Mais il faut attendre la r\u00e9ponse de M66B car il discute avec 28Black et SebRut sur une traduction plus all\u00e9g\u00e9e (en allemand et en anglais)\n. Glad to help you :)\n. \"Can you please translate this into English:\n407\n(in the issue please)\"\nFor sure ! I would be happy to help you ! But this link is self-linked, did you mean #406 ?\nI will post a comment in the related issue with the translation.\n. Ah, it seems that the author has already translated his issue !\n. @M66B Do you know what makes those lines appear many many times ?\nI/XPrivacy/XIoBridge( 2176): get 10074//proc identification=false *\nI/XPrivacy/XIoBridge( 2176): get setting Version=1.7.28 *\n. @daibaron\nEn effet, il y a de l'infinitif partout ailleurs, mais pour des actions dans les menus.

Je vais changer \u00e7a.\nDe m\u00eame, je trouve que \"randomiser\" fait un peu franglais, mais je ne vois pas quoi mettre d'autre.\n. it fixes issues #300 and #420 \n. Ok, thank you\n. Yes I understand, I didn't know that your screen was so small I'm sorry !\nIt was my first try to improve a project so yes I'm a little bit disappointed, but I still want to help you in improving your great app.\nOk, I will first contact you by XDA PM next time ! (for info, my pseudo is different but the avatar is the same : tony78960 )\n. I just checked my settings : emails from other members are disabled, PM are enabled. But in the last 45 minutes I changed the email address for my XDA account, maybe that's why it didn't work...\nCould you please retry ?\nEdit : it worked, thanks !\n. @M66B Maybe you could also change \"menu_app_settings\" in English to something like \"Application infos\" as the purpose of this menu is to open the application details in settings.\n. You are welcome!\n. The 'settings' item is usually put at the bottom of the menu list, but above any help/about item.\nhttp://developer.android.com/design/patterns/settings.html\nIMHO, as the actions 'report bug' and 'check for update' are less used than usage/export/import/etc.. they may be placed below the most commonly used actions.\n. You are right, I forgot it.\n. Moreover, I don't really know what is the function of the item 'All' so I don't know if it's a setting or an action.\n. Mmmh, ok I understand.\nMaybe the text for this item could be changed to 'Apply template to all' or something like this, to avoid confusion.\nDo you agree with these changes ? If yes, do you want me to make a new pull request including the change for the 'template' item or will you do another commit to change it ? \n. Ok, so we can't change it ATM.\nAnd what about the menu items moved ?\n. Update of #520 \n. @M66B I think you can merge the other translations. Then it will be easy to adapt pylerSM's fix by cutting already translated strings.\nEdit : argl, too late\n. I see the disabled checkboxes in the main app list, it's a bit lighter than the activated ones. If we use a custom drawable for the disabled ones it could improve their visibility !\nFor the restriction list of an app we could do the same, but then we also have to disable the checkboxes where all the restrictions are not checked as in main list.\n. ATM I am working on a dirty hack discussed with M66B to have a two-and-a-half-states checkbox :\n\nFor me it's not clean enough, some more little things could be done...\n@fda77 \nYour idea of the [dots] is not so bad as it would resolve my \"dirty\" problem. But it would be also unclear for the new users that we can toggle their state by touching them...\nIf your [dots] looks like checkboxes we need a lot of drawables for all states and all screen sizes if we want a clean result.\n. Ow nooo, manually merged \u00b0J\u00b0.. Due to the translation pulled before I think. It's not good for my stats :p (just kidding)\n@LazyZhu \n~~You are right about Filter by restrict state, it's better. But I can't change it now for all languages without doing 30 commits like pylerSM because I'm at work and I can only use github's web interface.~~\nEdit : My mistake, I though you were talking about changing the string.\n@M66B \n~~What do you think about LazyZhu's idea forFilter by restrict state ?~~\n. I just added a fix for issue #591, in order to show a half-ticked checkbox when an app has only dangerous restrictions set.\n. It fixes issue #591 !\n. @LazyZhu \nYes that's it, this fix should correct the behavior you described in the other issue\n. @LazyZhu \nOh, sorry ^^' I though you only wanted to change the string for the filter.\nThat would be handy too, but we will need a four-state filter for that : no filter, half-ticked, full-ticked, all ticked.\nI will take a look when I have some time\n. @LazyZhu \nfull-ticked is a normal tick\nall ticked would be full-ticked + half-ticked\n. Note : this change is not necessary, but it could avoid the users updating to see an empty list until they switch the app type filter.\n. 1. Yes I planned to add the tristates checkboxes in the app details activity. But as I and M66B said on XDA and in another issue on github (https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/issues/562#issuecomment-23320682), it's difficult and require some work because the lists in the app details activity are handled differently than the ones in the main activity.\n2. It is (almost) solved with #593 (will be part of next release). ~~Edit: One little bug remains : when you tick an app, the checkbox goes to the full-tick whereas the dangerous restrictions are not set (it goes back to a half-tick when you refresh the view). I will fix it in next pull request tomorrow.~~ Edit 2: Fixed with #598 \n3. Thanks :)\n. With #593 it fixes the point 2 of https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/issues/597#issuecomment-23379721\n.

I am not sure about it but it might be the fact that XPrivacy counts the number of activities when loading, then in the list the activities are grouped by package names (or uid ?) so they are less numerous.\n. I confirm that I have the same issue on CM 10.1 (JB 4.2.2) with XPrivacy 1.9.25\n. Up navigation is fixed with 1.9.26 ! ~~But then I can't open app detail activity from the list...\nIf I reduce XPrivacy and reopen it again I can open app detail activity.~~ Edit: My bad, it worked after the 3rd XPrivacy relaunch.\n. It is also possible to get all Wi-Fi passwords by reading the wpa_supplicant.conf file.\nOn CM 10.1 this file is in /data/misc/wifi/, but you need root access to read it. Therefore, I am not sure if restricting access to this file is worth the try...\n. Sorry for the late reply, for the moment I'm a bit too overloaded with my studies to follow the progress of the project...\nSounds good !\nI am going to do a pull request to change one or two words.\n. Also, it may be good to warn that I must not power off my device until the update service stops.\nOr, is the update service able to recover if it is unexpectedly stopped?\n. Great, thanks Marcel!\n. Sure!\n1927\n. I made an ugly \"git rebase\" so now it should be good.\n1926\n. @Phylon #1929 \nI do not agree with putting a space between the last word of a sentence and the ellipsis.\nAt least, in French it is a mistake:\nhttp://romy.tetue.net/points-de-suspension\nhttp://www.la-ponctuation.com/points-suspension.html\nhttp://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_de_suspension\nI am not sure about it, but it seems to be the same in English.\nAlso, there is something weird happening with your commit 4558242c1d6d2b087fe9443298d426c7aea59730.\nIt looks like our changes are in race ~~competition~~ condition: in your commit there are changes from one of my commits that Marcel already merged.\n. @Phylon Ok, no worries! I apologize if I was rude in my reply :confused:\nBTW you are right, I forgot to remove the leading space in the first translation commit, my bad.\n. I also tuned a padding and a margin in the main list.\n. You did not include commits a3b30078d8a51018d0b4719984696692a0c7885d and c73e4f45190d4178158913fe6e2a809b2d24f8a5, aren't you interested by the padding/margin fix?\n. The margin fix only affects small and medium screens (you can see on the right of the list).\nThe padding fix affects all screen sizes (you can see that the gap on the left of app's icon in the list).\nMedium screens (padding and margin fixes)\n\nLarge screens (padding fix)\n\nIt's up to you! The padding fix is not mandatory, but the margin fix is necessary for non-large screens.\n. I forgot to fix the right margin of details view's list for small and medium screens.\nHere it is!\n. Sure!\nMedium screen\n\nLarge screen\n\n. Thanks!\nFYI I used a 10\" emulator (Genymotion particularly) to test XPrivacy's rendering for large screens.\n. These changes are only for the settings dialog (main settings and app settings), I did not touch the detail view (yet :wink:).\n\nbut I am wondering if you took care of updating the main and details view too, like the on demand check box of the details view\n\nI don't understand... Do you think I should update the main and details views too?\nAs you want for the merge, it could have been a nice feature to add to the last XPrivacy 2 release!\n. I just checked and it's alright: enabling/disabling on demand restricting updates the main/details view when you save the settings.\n. Thanks, I'm happy to contribute!\n. I am sorry to react a bit late...\nI understand your choice to wait for the material design to be released before refactoring the UI (even if I am not fond of this ultra-flat design).\nBut how long will it take before it is released? During this time, XPrivacy's UI is not improved and stays a bit heavy...\nRecently I was making a custom theme for CM11's theme engine and I realized that there are two ways to theme an app:\n- either the app uses system's resources, so applying a theme to the system also themes the app,\n- or the app uses custom resources and you can theme just this app without necessary using the system's theme.\nIf the app is using both system and custom resources hard-coded in layouts, it's a nightmare for themers...\nThe best match to allow theming the app by both people theming the whole system and people theming some apps, is not to use directly system's resources in layouts (otherwise, it's impossible to override them without theming the system) but to use custom resources in layouts that point to system's resources within color/drawable/attr/style xml files.\n. Thank you for these links! Definitely helpful.\n. :)\n. You are right, it would be closer to the original text.\nI didn't update XPrivacy since December :no_mouth: does the command reset all XPrivacy's settings ?\n. Reduction of the list's right padding affects all screen sizes, but graphical render for large screens was already good before the fix. Thus we need to counter-balance the right padding reduction for large screens.\n. Well...\n\nactivity_horizontal_margin_list was already a custom implementation (compared with activity_horizontal_margin). Why not tune it up a bit if it fixes a graphical glitch?\n. ",
    "Magissia": "People have isane huge sized screen, not a problem if it takes more space.\n. The window you get when clicking on the app icon is what i was talking about, means it's already done but was not obvious (at least for me).\n. Hello, with android 4.3 android added additional support for multi user with example of a game that is user aware and remove the possibility to buy new levels on the said games when a restricted user runs it. Plus since the owner user have root most of the time, it's possible to use roots rights to look at XPrivacy settings for other users than the current one.\n. Okay so no plan to support this i guess. Could be a nice feature. Thanks for reading.\n. Hello, will it have it's own sub category or will it be linked ot the general system settings ?\n. Seems perfect !\n. http://developer.android.com/training/accessibility/accessible-app.html#focus maybe this can help more ?\n. I don't know if it's help, the app's general setting do fully work with physical keyboard : Open app - physical menu button - physical arrow down to settings - enter - use arrows to naviguate, use numbers/letters to write when you are where you wish, when one of the two checkboxes are highlighted, pressing enter tick/untick it. Bottom page button react to \"enter\" as a click or tap when highlighted. From that point you can maybe compare what's different and see if it will be too much work to do that on the app list.\n. Right, means this would probably take too long to make, maybe requiring custom code if the methods you used doesn't support this, i will open another ticket with a solution to make non touch screen devices less painfull to use with your app involving desktop like use of cursor, but without involving full physical keyboard support.\n. Hello, this is indeed a little problem, I guess XPrivacy doesn't block them because it is not running to catch them when you are on your recovery partition. From an outside view I'm afraid it would require a scan at every boot to find that an may hit performance during boot or some time after boot. \n. Thanks !\n. Hello, I was wondering the same thing while reading logs from my XT320 while helping a comrade porting a module to GingerBread, Motorola use lots of internal calling that XPrivacy cannot block because it doesn't hook them, but I'm wondering if hooking those won't hit on performance for people no having a single trace of blur on their device? \nI also noticed some apps do try to access Gmail app or Android 's stock email app directly using some permissions, from the obvious names, for reading your mails or attachments from it, maybe I (or someone)  should open a ticket to list interesting calls to block? \nRegards\n. No i don't, i was away and forgot to open the issue as it was requested, guess it's already there then, i opened the issue without checking, please accept my apologies.\n. On a side note, secondary users may cause privacy leaks for the device owner if they don't have the proper configuration. \n. Hello, apps can pass information to secondary users, limited user can use paid apps the owner bought, device owner can limit access to functions on some applications to limited users, all this from the Android application share menu, but the application have to be coded to take advantage of this android feature. \nThe export import won't save time as you will have to do this every time you install an application. It will also require removing every secondary user passwords by force to connect on their account to do the import, or  every users to give their password and change it afterward.\n. \"On Android tablets, users can now create restricted profiles based on the primary user. When users create a restricted profile, they can enable restrictions such as which apps are available to the profile. A new set of APIs in Android 4.3 also allow you to build fine-grain restriction settings for the apps you develop. For example, by using the new APIs, you can allow users to control what type of content is available within your app when running in a restricted profile environment\"\nhttps://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-4.3.html#RestrictedProfiles\nIf needed, it can be combined to root usage to write directly to other users data folder (as root you can access it, as i can see every users data folder with any root file manager)\nThe device is anyway already rooted to be able to install XPosed  framework. \nEven with a non root path, it is possible to enforce some rules (like always refuse SERIAL for limited user, even if they did not ticked it, stuff like that) to ensure a minimum privacy.\nThere must be a way to do something, at least for 4.3+ devices.\n. Even an option to hide the icon for limited users but keep Xprivacy active would be enough (It is possible, SuperSU does it when keeping root only for device owner)\nIt would require a Boolean option for the limited user panel in addition to the app's authorization to run itself. It would at least apply default restriction that could be better than nothing, and it will leave it up to the device owner to find a way to apply the rules by itself, removing you the need to support this part.\nPlease keep in mind limited user are limited, they are not secondary users, limited users cannot install any apps by themselves and can only use what the owner allowed to run. Don't expect a user using a limited account to take care of the privacy at all (Biggest use of the limited account is probably for kids that don't cares about privacy, they just want to play their games and tap things around)\n. @M66B Hello, i want to allow Xprivacy to run with current limited users rules without showing XPrivacy's icon on the app drawer to prevent the limited user to open XPrivacy configuration GUI. (It should also hide the new app notification from XPrivacy by the same way)\nSince XPrivacy doesn't support limited user, what's available at the current time is only a on/off of the whole end user part for the restricted users. It means if a new app is given to the users while XPrivacy is set on \"off\", the app will have empty restrictions and won't have default restriction applied.\nBeing able to enable XPrivacy end user part (What we currently are able to allow or not on the restricted app list) without giving a way to the user to open it (not showing the app in app drawer, no showing notification, maybe close the GUI with a \"You are not allowed to open XPrivacy\" if the user find another way to open the GUI, like Play Store does) will allow the device owner to be sure the settings are not modified by kid/guest that doesn't care at all about the device owner's privacy.\nThe hiding should be done for limited users and not secondary users, they are are not the same thing, and it's not possible to control what the secondary users have access to with Android's settings, while it's possible with restricted users.\n@jpeg729 No, disabling XPrivacy on the restricted user panel disable it for real, meaning restricted users apps are not privacy protected at all. Disable app on the restricted user panel is not just about hiding the icon, it disallow the restricted user to run the app. No more no less.\nYou will surely agree that disabling what is supposed to protect you will make it unable to protect you.\nThat's why i want a way to keep it active but hide it (different from disabling)\n. Indeed, don't know what made me think it was not working while i tested it, just retested and got the restriction applied while XPrivacy GUI wasn't allowed.\nBut one problem remains, if i add a new app to the user while XPrivacy GUI isn't enabled for the restricted user, the app won't get restricted at all, it should get the default restrictions applied.\nShould I open a new ticket for this ?\n. Will make further checks and open a dedicated ticket, we are out of the initial subject now ...\n. Hello, it was not a question it was an actual bug report, it is not possible the second user have an app in the 10K range UID and i did get the popup with the app to restrict showing owner's UID and not current user's UID.\nWhile the UID shown on the pop up is in the 10K range, the app restricted from the answer is in the 1010K range.\nLooking at what the XPrivacy GUI gives, the correct UID is shown, this problem happens only on the popup. Can record a video with the problem showing up using calc app if it please you.\n. From wich user view ?\n. http://imgur.com/tF2REkH\nTook from restricted user view. \nCalculator usge from restricted user not visible in the list while it is restricted with \"on demand\" for everything.\n. Any restriction, UID 1010023 (Looking at the usage logs on my side, it seems it didn't even got logged at all ... as i don't see anything logged for the calc while it ask for inet and SERIAL)\n. i checked the whole list and the UID doesn't show anywhere. Will retry with block instead of on demand.\n. http://imgur.com/hBFcdIE\nOkay, app UID 1010074 got something blocked. On the on demand popup, it was shown 10074.\nNote that 10074 is frozen on Owner account, only restricted user have it unfozen.\n. Thanks\n. Downloaded\n. Seems to be working, second user can even now fake Android ID with different value.\nComing from 1.99.71 the performance enhancement present on the changelog is not a joke and the menu render more than twice faster on my device.\n. We're in a loop, device admin should not give access to XPrivacy GUI to prevent users from changing other users' settings, but we need to give the GUI to have working privacy protection. This is strictly multi-user unfriendly.\nPlease don't forget limited users may have no understanding of what is privacy at all. If we give them limited account it's because they don't have a clue of what they are doing.\n. That would require force deleting other users' password to do so since XPrivacy GUI doesn't allow to manage other users restriction, as stated on #1560 \nPlus it won't prevent unrestricted rules for apps secondary user may install, resulting in privacy leak.\n. Of course, but apps installed on a system isn't something fixed that will never change, and once it's given to the end user, there will be a password, because leaving the user account without password is a security issue, that's worse than just a privacy issue.\nEven without adding new apps, one may get updated and require change in permissions in order to work or protect privacy.\n. Hello @Cerberus-tm , this is not impossible to implement this via XPrivacy since all users share the same database file, one user could enforce settings to others if the GUI allowed to, i'm sure it's possible to enforce settings manually by editing the database, but it would be long and risky in case of fail as there would be nothing to check if you are doing something wrong.\nThe problem with app lock is the end user may want to use it by itself, forcing me to install a second app lock software just to lock one thing. It also means i will have to force the installation of the app to secondary users (not restricted) witch may have password set, preventing me from configuring the said app locker. Removing other users' password by force is not a solution on a security side, and it is not possible to impressionate other users on Android to configure the app locker.\nSecondary users could uninstall the applocker themselves, or lead the app locker to crash and still access the XPrivacy GUI. Only app locker that may be fail proof would be one using root or XPosed framework, and there's no plans on giving root to restricted/secondary users, and i didn't seen any app locker using the XPosed framework.\n. @Cerberus-tm It seemed to be a good idea at first, but multi-user isn't officially available on mobile phone, just on tablet, and tablet doesn't have a dialer. The app itself doesn't seem multi-user friendly at all. But it's a good catch.\nEdit : The store also says it's not compatible with my devices, even the phones one.\n@M66B I have patience, but a closed issue is closed.\nBy global, you mean the same restriction for all users, for every application ? Would you give some information on how you plan to implement it (user side, at least) ?\n. Is that really required? We don't already have two check mark? \n. Plus one. But should be a check option and no other way. \n. Really great we get this feature, thanks you M66B, considering donating again, you're awesome <3\n. M66B I will test XPrivacy on Defy mini (one core 700mhz, by head) when it's backported to Gingerbread if you want. I also have a TF101 using a dual core 1ghz, but don't know how far you classify devices as low end.\nI'm sorry for not giving feedbacks sooner, i'm giving feedback when i can on the forum, you know it, i just don't always have the time to test the changes.\n2 days delay to consider there's no feedback is a bit low in my own opinion.\nTell me if you want reports from back ported XPrivacy for gingerbread for very low end perforance, and i can make a test on the TF101 (4.4.2) for performance too if you consider it low end.\n. Hello @M66B , i know Gingerbread is not supported, but it's the only low end device that i have, the bootloader is locked and no flaws was found to replace system. I will still test it but of course the performance will not only depend on your work, but on the work of the backporter too, i suppose that's better than nothing :)\n. I'm okay with this, if we have a clear way to know wich app will or will not be able to use this feature as doing it wrongly may kill the whole purpose of XPrivacy.\n. While you won't fix/cannot fix it, it's not really a question, but thanks for your reply.\nIf it's not on the FAQ already, it should be noted as workaround to avoid on demand if possible when using multiple users on the same device.\nThanks\n. On slow device it will make the launch slower, it consume data.\n. Couldn't it be implemented the way it will cost less performance at cost of user friendliness ? It can be left to power users if required, it would be better than not having it at all.\n. @M66B Yes this is the place i white listed Google services, and it didn't work, as @an0n981  pointed it i'm not alone seeing the problem, even if not everyone see it as a problem. Here's a logcat of where i launch Google plus with everything restricted + on demand on \"system (installed apps)\" but have google services white listed. When asked if allowed, i tapped yes for 30 seconds (but this popup shouldn't even appear since it's whitelisted)\nGoogle plus is UID 10135 on this log file\nhttps://paste.ee/p/bNwQA\nIf it is intended please consider it as a suggestion, else I don't see what it could be but a bug.\n. Why asking if I still want to allow white listed package if i manually white listed them ? Why not behaving the same way loadlibrary does ? I don't get asked again for white listed library, re asking for white listed package makes no sense and only create confusion where it's not required.\n. But why not making it work like loadlibrary? Can you explain what wrong could happen if user could keep the on demand pop-up for non white listed packages and skip it for white listed packages ?\n. While i thank you for the quirk, could you define what is system components for you ? Google+ is installed inside /data/app some of my devices, XPrivacy behave the same way on devices where Google+ is installed in /system/app. \n. I don't understand how this is linked to my suggestion as i'm suggesting to give the same pop-up to quickly white list an app, as we can for white listing libraries on loadlibrary on demand pop-up. I am not trying to restrict UID 1000 or a system app. \n. I agree with the fact it will cause data leaks\n. Privacy is not a game, it's a life style, if you want to drop weapons and let them invade your data that's up to you, but don't force it to others.\n. An application can force itself on top with a one pixel transparent window without you ever noticing it. If you feel an application can access the data, leave it allowed, it's not useful to allow data lakes only when you use the software, if you feel this is a privacy issue, deny, if it's not, allow, that's all, there's no point to sometime allow data leaks... \n. Hello, I am curious to know why this is not possible, could you share some details? \n. Meaning rare applications having this feature had a hard time implementing it ?\n. Can't we just use the list of allowed packages for this app when this call is restricted? \n. I think this may be useful, but how can we be sure a user won't whitelist \nsomething for each application by mistake too easily ?\n. A workaround would be to parse data with another app and modify the \ndatabase, but this unsafe. \n. The default behaviour seems configurable already.\nIf you have block+ ask, it will block when timed out.. Putting a bounty of 50\u20ac on this. Was able to reproduce leak with Fx on ASUS ZenFone 2 Laser running 6.0.1 in compatibility mode.\nUsed Fx to explore user's root media directory and deleted successfully an APK file.\nXPrivacy doesn't report any usage of open for Fx..

Well spotted. 2.2 and 2.1.4 actually.\nMy first comment has been updated.\n. That works too. Thanks.\n. I shall +1 this request. My usual workflow on installing a new app is to restrict everything and when it bugs I look at what its usage and start allowing stuff bit by bit.\n. I must be missing something - it all looks like fake data and its randomisation to me. Can you expand a little?\n. Good point. I'll think of that next time.\n. If it ain't done by this afternoon, I'll do it then.\n. Wow. Fast work! and thanks for the encouragement.\n. I prefer \"critical\" to \"dangerous\" because dangerous is a little ambiguous. Dangerous, so ought to be restricted. Or Restricting can be dangerous.\n\"Critical\" says this function/app is important for the system. Restricting could be problematic.\nWith the explanation, it doesn't really matter which we choose. Which do you prefer?\n. For me it flickers a bit, but it gets to where it should.\n. Do you have an extension installed? In which case, both the browser and the extension appear together as one entry.\n. The browser doesn't need it, the android system does.\nIt whatsmyip didn't know your real ip address you would never get a response from them.\n. In any case, it seems that the workaround can only be done in OI file manager.\nI have tried dismissing the keyboard from a couple of places in XPrivacy, without success.\n. I have noticed a couple of tweaks that could be useful. e.g. after an import the ui is recreated, which means that all trace of the import is lost (except the notification). It would be nice if it still said \"Import: Done\" when I come back with a fresh coffee. Same after a fetch, be it successful or not.\nI'll also bring back that progressbar and set a maxWidth on tvState to prevent it overflowing onto another line during an operation.\n. I'm working on that too.\nI'll make sure that whenever tvStats or pbFilter is shown/changed, that the maxWidth of tvState is adjusted to prevent it overflowing. That way we get the best of all worlds.\n. Unfortunately it will have to wait a day or two.

I have an idea of what might be happening in those cases.\nSometimes usage data cannot be transmitted to XPrivacy immediately (due to\nnot having a context), and so it is stored in a queue.\nWithout extra usage data, if an app has some items in its data usage queue\nbut quits before trying to do something else that could be restricted, then\nthe entire queue is lost. Extra usage data deals with the queue much more\noften.\nI am currently working on emptying the queue when an app quits, FCs, or if\nthe user moves away to another app. This should also result in XPrivacy\nalways showing up to date usage data concerning foreground apps.\nOn 29 November 2013 23:59, wbedard notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nAll right, just finished up a round of testing, as follows:\nDevice: Galaxy Nexus (maguro)\nOS: Android 4.3 (JWR66Y)\nXposed Framework: 2.4beta2\nXPrivacy: 1.10.33\nProcedures\n1. Freshly booted after updating XPrivacy but before having enabled\n   \"extra usage data\"\n2. Opened XPrivacy, allowed it to initialize and then switched over to\n   the Android Home screen\n3.

I then noted which apps had orange triangles indicating data\n   access. I viewed a few of them to confirm the time of the most recent\n   accesses corresponded to my testing.\n6. Using this process, after about 10 minutes (approx 20 apps), I\n   started noting the most recent apps were not getting logged. This matches\n   my previous \"informal\" testing using XP build 1.10.32 (test).\nAt this point, I enabled \"extra usage data\" in Xprivacy, set up to capture\na new logcat and then rebooted my device. Once the device settled down from\nbooting, I again launched XPrivacy and noted that the usage data from the\nprevious testing session was still indicated by orange triangles beside the\nrelated apps. So, picking up with the next available app, I continued with\nthe procedures outlined above. In this session however, which lasted almost\n30 minutes and involved almost 100 apps, I could not find a single one that\ndid not get logged by XPrivacy.

I'll add a couple of log commands and do a quick test to make sure it was a placebo effect.\nAnd if all goes well, I shall revert my change.\n. Here is what I get using my latest modifications to XPrivacy code. It seems to be a pretty conservative app.\n\nA quick look through the log shows that all restrictions for 500 Firepaper where being retreived via the fallback method - which means you need either Extra usage data, or my modifications in order for XPrivacy to receive them. Extra usage data isn't garanteed to work in all cases.\n.

You are right.\n. If a category is in the template - it is restricted whether the app has permissions or not.\n. The template is only applied on app install.

Not in so much detail, but reading between the lines and experimenting a little will get you there.\n\nThe template, available from the main menu is applied to newly installed applications or if you use the menu apply template from the application details view.\nI've also been digging through the source code recently. One detail that might surprise you is the behaviour of the Apply template option in the app specific view - if anything covered by the template is checked it will clear the categories of the template, otherwise it checks them.\n. I'd vote for Apply Template to clear all and restrict everything covered by\nthe template. That seems to be the simplest logic for it.\nOn 2 December 2013 19:15, Cerberus-tm notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n@jpeg729 https://github.com/jpeg729 Yes, I have noticed Apply Template\noften erases my permissions seemingly at random.

The docs say if we subclass Application we are supposed to call super.onCreate, but they don't say it is mandatory, as with Activity.onCreate.\n\nWe could hook Application.attach instead. An Application instance isn't a context until its attach method is called.\n(Application is a subclass of ContextWrapper. ContextWrapper.getContentResolver, for example, uses ContextWrapper.mBase which is set in ContextWrapper.attachBaseContext, which in turn is called by Application.attach)\n. We should hook Activity.onDestroy too, to catch any later accesses, and because if finish() is called from onCreate, then onDestroy is the only other lifecycle method called. cf. here\n. For the dangerous functions it seems to be storing restricted = \"false\" (when it should be storing \"true\"), using \"false\" (correctly), and yet displaying checked.\n. More testing using CPU-Z (which FCs if Identification is totally blocked) suggests that restricting is happening as it ought.\nSo the problem lies either in the logging, or in the usage log reading.\n. I expected absolutely everything to be restricted for Brain Games.\nI just tested CPU-Z too with everything restricted. It FC's pretty quickly, with my usage patches, the usage data is updated nicely. But this is what it shows. I was expected those little red round things everywhere.\n\n. Log for CPU-Z, only lines concerning the identification category\nhttp://pastebin.com/PCyArcGY\n. I think you've cracked it. I was puzzled about the order of these two log lines...\nI/XPrivacy(30940): Queue usage data=10092/identification/SERIAL=false size=1\nI/XPrivacy(30940): get 10092/SERIAL identification=restricted (file) 10 ms\nAnd of course the usage log was recording false, because getRestrictedFallback hadn't yet been called.\n. They are, but you need to be patient.\n. That is actually a rather nice idea - maybe keeping the current pbFilter and avoiding touching the new progress bar if a share op is in progress.\nI hadn't seen the call in selectRestriction. I ought to have given a reproducible error - select Filter on user apps and Filter on restricted and then leave and restart XP. --> for me, there is no filtering in that case.\nAfter quickly testing a few more cases, it seems to happen when Filter on restricted is checked.\n. On the other hand, maybe you are right. Maybe I was just too impatient.\nI must test again.\n. I was just too being impatient. Filter on Restricted just needs a little more time to apply.\n. My latest proposition doesn't work. performFiltering isn't on the UI Thread.\n. I don't quite understand what you are getting at.\nWhat would you do with the location related functions for an app that hasn't requested permission to access your location?\n. In the app view, press the menu key, then choose Application -> App details, then scroll down.\nIt isn't nicely coloured, but there it is.\n. All the same it is the sort of option that I would have tended to avoid, being uncertain of the outcome. Toggle restrictions could mean so many different things, except when either everything is fully checked, or fully unchecked.\n. If we could store the template as restrictions for uid=0, we could use ActivityApp with custom page headers. That would avoid a lot of code duplication. Alternatively, we could just add extra code to make it load/save the template instead of uid=0.\nGoing a bit furthur, if getRestricted(hook, context, uid, restrictionName, methodName, ...) returned either the stored restriction for an app, or the restriction for uid=0, then we wouldn't even need to apply the template to new apps. deleteRestrictions would have to be changed, and we would have to clear restrictions for new system apps.\n. How about showing the application menu as a context menu when you click on the app icon, instead of launching the app straight off?\n. Touching the icon launches the app.\nLong pressing the icon gives you the menu.\n. It could be opened from a simple click if you prefer.\nopenContextMenu(imgIcon);\n. The more I think about this, the less I really like it, because we can't force-flush the usage queues.\nActually, what if we add something like the following to getRestricted?\nif (!isUsageDataEnabled) {\n    if (mFlusher == null && context != null) \n        post a delayed runnable to call sendUsageData.\n. Even if you choose to use a different approach, there are a couple of potentially useful bits in this code.\n1. Finer detection of restart required. You can't assume that those functions are not subject to exceptions.\n2. Detection of whether the app is running or not to avoid prompting for apps that aren't actually running.\n. It is the same icon as used in the usage log\n. I forgot to check that allowed applications be converted properly.\n. I like this idea.\nWe already use the background colour to indicate system apps.\nWhere would you put this colour?\n. My favourites are the one in the middle and the one on the right.\nI would prefer a small number of states rather than a colour picker. \"Needs attention\"(Red) and \"Not yet configured\" (Yellow/orange) would be the minimum. \"Working really well\" seems good too.\n. I was actually thinking of four colours. The fourth being transparent.\nI see your logic. If we had yellow/red for new installs, and green for\nsubmitted apps, then there is no need to code an extra menu.\nOn 6 December 2013 17:39, Marcel Bokhorst notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI am thinking of marking applications that have been submitted for the\ncrowd sourced restrictions and nothing else.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/issues/887#issuecomment-30008536\n.\n. Good question.

That makes the style on the right ugly.\nI guess I shall use the lefthand style, since the middle one could be troublesome with some icons.\nThe colours can be discussed too. For uniformity I took the colours used by the permission and use icons.\n. I don't like those colours, but something flashier wouldn't work as a border round the icons.\nThat said, if I can't remove the extra padding, I will probably go with the border.\n. I spoke too soon.\n\nGood point about the colour relationship. I'm not much of a visual artist, could you suggest something better?\n. Just a mock-up.\n\nIt shouldn't be hard to do measure/calculate the position of the bottom of the first list item and call a transparent activity that overlays the text below that point. The little red numbers would be trickier, but also quite doable (except for 5 & 6).\nOtherwise we would have to include lots more images and increase the apk size.\nI would add a couple of settings cSettingMainTutorial & cSettingAppTutorial to mark them as seen. That way we can show them to existing users who upgrade.\n. Maybe we should remove Application from the options menu\n.

Well, why not indeed. I doubt I'll have much time to look at it today, my new computer has arrived and I shall be shuffling data for a good while.\n. 1. The current logic as far as I understand it is to restrict a lot and then allow just a few functions so that apps don't force close. If you can advance a good argument why this should change, then it might.\n2. You can adjust the template via the menu in the main screen. Currently you can only specify which categories should be restricted. The possibility to exempt individual functions from the template is on the todo list, but it isn't a priority at the moment. If you like you can remove everything from the template and you will still get the notification.\n3. You can already do that. You have to select a category via the Category tab in the main screen, then choose Filter on permissions, and all apps that don't have permission to access that category will disappear.\n.

If you give an app root access, then it can find ways round most restrictions. You just pinpointed one.\n\nFor Accounts, you could probably get away with blocking the category and then using the menu to allow access to your Google account only.\n. A quick look at XposedAppSettings code reveals that it hooks the package manager to revoke permissions.\nThat means that\n1. apps will FC sometimes depending on the permissions revoked.\n2. it is compatible with XPrivacy.\n. About native libraries and native apps, I always thought that in order to\nuse sensors or access data they would (mostly) have to call the java\nfunctions that manage those accesses.\nThe question then is, to what extent is the raw data accessible to native\ncode, so if an app reimplemented large parts of android, to what extent\ncould it bypass hookable functions or even the android permission system in\nits search for data?\nUnfortunately, that is a question that is way over my competence level.\n. https://github.com/rovo89/XposedAppSettings/blob/master/src/de/robv/android/xposed/mods/appsettings/hooks/PackagePermissions.java\n. Another possible use: I read somewhere that Android 4.2+ returns less precise location results if only coarse location permission has been granted.\n. Should I open a pull request to the stable branch too?\n. What if the global setting disabled update notifications except when an update adds more permissions to an app?\nWhat if the app specific setting disabled all update notifications for that app?\nIt would take a bit more code, but it would be a nice compromise.\n. True. And an app could start using the permissions it has differently, but at least there would be occasional reminders.\n. Near duplicate of #869\n. The restrictions file timeout would do the trick too. Maybe ActivityApp.onStart should touch the file to alert the app that modifications might be on the way.\n.

I took a look at the Xposed download list. Nice.\nHowever, I think filtering and sorting should go together - sticking it in the category tab was less than ideal.\nHow about banishing the tabs, leaving the category selection always visible and putting filters & sort in a dialog box accessible from a single button? We gain some space and keep things logical.\n\nYou also suggested putting the installation+update times in the app details, but I can't see a good place to put it without taking up more space.\nHow about hiding the package names in a dialog and putting the app names in their place? That way we gain some space and we can put the dates in the dialog with the package names. We could use the info button situated to the right of the package names to trigger the dialog. I have an idea for fetching that would render the current use of that image obsolete. Something like the following with cancel and apply all buttons at the bottom of the screen.\n\n. Sometimes I like to think aloud, so here goes.\nFor the navigation drawer, I see at most three top level views - the app list, the usage list and the global settings. I suppose that when looking at the details of an app one could add the app name as a title, followed by Usage data and Settings. The other items in the menu are actions which shouldn't go in the navigation drawer.\nI can't see myself swiping from the details of one app to the next very often, but why not. I think there are performance issues to address before it would work really well.\n. Are no system apps are restricted in any way?\n.

There may be an argument for caching more of this stuff.\nEach time the list is redrawn there is a lot of flickering going on.

Whatever happens the restrictions are shared between all those packages. It might be less confusing if the notification listed a few of the package names with an ellipsis.\n.

Correct.\n. If I'm reading the server code correctly, it doesn't communicate the confidence level to the app. It just reports non-restricted for any method whose votes don't meet the confidence interval. So if the app is in the database with only one submission, doing a fetch would result in nothing being restricted.\n\nMaybe an app should only be available for fetching if at least all its categories meet the confidence interval. The app details view's fetch option could work differently, fetching the votes themselves to present the user a preview and let them choose.\nSupposing one could add a comment per category on submission, the app could present for comment only the categories where at least one non-dangerous method was not restricted. So you'd be able to say why you allow the app to access the internet, or use the clipboard, or ... The comments should have a limited length.\nSupposing then that the app details view could fetch the votes and comments and present it all for preview, the user could then read a few comments and choose which option to apply in each case. When the user has finished choosing, his choices could be transmitted back to the server to add weight to the votes.\n. Supposing there are only three sets of votes, that only agree on one\ncategory.\nThe result would be clearing everything except that category.\nMaybe we need a minimum number of categories satisfying the CI. How about\nreporting Nothing found if 5 or more categories don't satisfy the CI.\n. In other words, don't wipe first. That would work, wouldn't it?\n. Actually the migration code looks OK, but something isn't right.\n. I've just tested again and everything seems to be working ok.\n. When there is only one %d or %s or whatever in a string, it can be left alone.\nWhen there are two or more, one should use positional format thingys %1$s, %2$s, etc. because some languages will want to put them in a different order.\nAt least that is what this page says.\n.

I think it probably depends on whether the relevant hook acts before or after the android function.\nIf before then XPrivacy will log each and every try to use that function.\nIf after then XPrivacy won't log uses of functions that apps don't have permission to use. Android permissions management will block the access first and the after hook won't run.\n. I think I am beginning to see what you want to know.\nIf an app tries to access some function the hook intervenes and the hook calls getRestriction to ask XPrivacy whether it should be restricted or not.\nThe problem that has been raised is that an app could deliberately call getRestriction itself, thus causing the usage log to log a use of some function which the app hasn't actually used. This would confuse users, but it wouldn't be a security risk.\n. Some functions can be circumvented by using others. For example, Build.prop stuff can be found via shell.\nThat sort of stuff should be documented.\nMostly though XPrivacy is getting pretty good at blocking the gaps.\n\nThe problem would be if you tried an app, it FCs, and when you check usage you see yellow triangles everywhere, you wouldn't know what to allow. That would be annoying, but relatively harmless, unless you lost patience and unchecked everything.\n. I wouldn't say \"Poorly behaved\", I'd say \"Badly behaved\", and if the developer is willing to go that far, then I'm not sure I'd trust him at all.\n. For import/export showFileName we don't really need a string with it.\nThe filename alone would do, and we could therefore remove two strings.\nAn idea for translating server messages would be to have the php return strings like \"no_restrictions\", and have XP look up R.string.php_no_restrictions. Something like the following would do.\npublic void localizePhpMessage(String string) {\n    String stringName = \"php_\" + string;\n    int id = getResources().getIdentifier(stringName, \"string\", this.getPackageName());\n    if (id != 0)\n        return getString(id);\n    return getString(R.string.msg_technical_error);\n    // Anything not in the string resources can be called a technical error since the goal is\n    // just to have something vaguely intelligible to show the user. Of course, we'd make\n    // sure the original message was written to the logs for debugging purposes.\n}\nWhen fetching, if a package isn't found on the server at all, then the server doesn't return html response code 200. It probably should.\n. I don't restrict any system apps on principle, and I've never had boot\nloops from XPrivacy.\nThe red ones in each category are considered more prone to causing\nproblems, so they aren't restricted by default, even if the category is\nrestricted.\n. Chrome is just a browser, so restrict it all you like.\nMaps can probably be restricted without problems.\nGoogle Play Store is probably more essential to the good workings of your system. So go carefully.\nYou can try looking them up on the website http://crowd.xprivacy.eu/\nI figure that google know all about me anyway, so I don't much bother restricting google apps.\n. Could you provide a logcat? Otherwise it is pretty hard to tell what is happening.\n. It would also involve reading/writing to the database, which will take its time too.\nThe export shouldn't be completely silent - there should be a notification.\nFor the import, there should be a dialog to ask first and the app should then present the new share ui with all installed apps in the list and the file pre-selected.\nAnother idea would be to move the usage data to a separate database. Then the settings db should almost always be in a backup-able state.\n. The English isn't very clear either.\nWell, for each restriction the server counts the votes for and against and calculates a confidence value - lower values mean the data is more trustworthy, higher values mean those votes could more easily have been produced from tossing a coin that many times.\nPutting a lower value in that box results in fewer restrictions being available for fetching, a higher value will result in more restrictions being available, but with a lower degree of consensus between voters, hence lower quality.\n. Maybe I should keep on translating new strings, and you can correct a few words when you get the time.\n. I had never thought of using the search function to find a uid.\nI've had some weird behaviour too, such as checking filter on user apps, it filters, then a moment later the whole list comes back leaving the check still there.\n. You probably have tried already, but I'll ask anyway.\n1. What happens if you wipe xprivacy's data before rebooting?\n2. I suppose you have enabled adb in the device's settings.\nWithout an HTC One I can only guess.\nHere is another idea for trying to catch a logcat. I'm running slimrom 4.4.2 and if I create a file called userinit.sh in /data/local/ it gets run during the boot process.\nYou could try making such a file and putting something like this in it.\nlogcat > /sdcard/boot.log\nThen try bootlooping, the file will get replaced on each boot and it will grow indefinitely if you leave the phone running. Then you interrupt the process in between boots and recover the generated file.\nI don't guarantee that this procedure will work on your rom, if it doesn't you'd better ask advice in your rom's forum. Actually, send me a link to your rom and I'll check the boot scripts to see if anything obvious sticks out.\n. Unrelated in my opinion.\n/data/local/userinit.sh won't get loaded because your rom doesn't look for it. (At first glance anyway.)\nMine has an extra file in /system/etc/init.d called 90userinit.sh containing the following \n```\n!/system/bin/sh\ncall userinit.sh and/or userinit.d/* scripts if present in /data/local\nif [ -e /data/local/userinit.sh ];\nthen\n   log -p i -t userinit \"Executing /data/local/userinit.sh\";\n   logwrapper /system/bin/sh /data/local/userinit.sh;\n   setprop cm.userinit.active 1;\nfi;\nif [ -d /data/local/userinit.d ];\nthen\n   logwrapper busybox run-parts /data/local/userinit.d;\n   setprop cm.userinit.active 1;\nfi;\n```\nThat file executes any init scripts I care to put in the right places. Could you add such a file to your system, or would you like me to add it to the rom zip for you?\n. XPrivacy can report on apps use of different functions, but not on whether they crash because of the results. Even if you knew the last function to be used before the crash, the error could come from the app trying to use data received through an earlier call and not coping with an empty list, a null result, or something similar.\nGoing furthur, even if you could tell which functions were used just before the bootloop and by which apps, you'd still not be able to tell reliably which one caused the bootloop.\nThe best you can do is to guess. Did you restrict any system apps?\n. Personally I would welcome the change because I always found that more of a nuisance than a help.\n. Something like - \nTitle: Clear categoryName\nMsg: Should the exceptions be cleared to?\nButtons: Remember & Clear\n. How about when you click on a category checkbox to clear it seeing the usual Are you sure? with an additional checkbox \"Forget exceptions\" that is unchecked by default?\nThat might be the simplest idea possible.\n. Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar is what we used to have before I started helping out. I think it is one of the first things I changed, because it was blocking input, the main list was still visible during the operation, but not responding to input.\nThe other example seems pretty similar.\n. I'd love my launcher to be able to take me directly to the details page for an app.\n. Come to think of it, the export intent could be misused just as easily by malicious apps. Maybe we need to add an option to define one (or maybe more) apps that are allowed to send intents to XPrivacy - then we'd need to intercept them to check their provenance.\n. True, but I don't know how easy/hard it is to fake input events. Presumably Google have made it pretty darn difficult.\n. I don't think that will work because it isn't declared in the manifest.\n. Rebased and merged as a separate branch\n. Here's my 2c\nI think the prompt should give ...\n- The choice between the function & the category\n- The choice of duration: once, 10 mins, always\n- The choice to Allow or Deny\nThat should cover pretty much all use cases that people could think up & I don't think we can simplify the available choices without getting complaints.\n. I'm just wondering about inet, SERIAL, media & sdcard...\nShould we show a prompt with checkboxes for the relevant ones when an app starts?\n. I was thinking of something like\nif (category == ?)\n    check the function\n    nothing -> ask\n    x -> deny\n    _ -> allow\nelse if (category == x)\n    check for an exception\nelse if (category == _)\n    deny\nThat should cover what I suggested\n. Updated, working and tested.\nFor the moment the checkbox onclick logic goes full/half check -> ? -> empty -> ? -> full/half check.\nThe only exception is when there is no restriction selected in the main list, that is in order to integrate the Are you sure? dialog.\nAn alternative idea for protecting existing settings is to have onclick toggle asked, and only clear the checkbox if you double click. A single click would show a Toast \"Double-click to clear\".\n. Try long-pressing on an apps name, (then another if you like, then another) - then try Submitting.\n. The restriction responsible is not always the last one to be accessed.\nAn app could ask for x, store the data, then ask for y, and only afterwards attempt to use the data received from x and crash.\nI don't think there is a way to know for sure which restriction is responsible.\n. If you tap a line in the usage list it will take you directly to that restriction in the details view of the relevant app.\n. Seems normal to me. Android sets keyboard focus to the first input element\nin the group. Some devices have real arrow keys and maybe also real\nkeyboards. Such devices (and any device connected to a bluetooth keyboard)\nneed to indicate to the user where they are at, and so they need to give\nsome feedback, that is why android does it, or so I believe.\nThere is absolutely nothing in XPrivacy's code to tell it where to flash\nthe cursor. I'm guessing that when the cursor isn't flashing, keyboard\ninput is directed to an input element that doesn't have a caret.\n. That line makes sure that if the category is marked \"please ask\", the asked state of the hook is taken into account. If the category has been asked, I don't look at the hook state.\nThis works for all the other hooks, so why not for those two.\n. It looks to be ok now. Dunno why.\n. I use SuperSU, and I resolved my problem by setting \"storage\" to restricted before rebooting.\n. M66B has also been busy fixing the underlying issues.\n. There isn't enough space on some screens for another action button. I could put it all in the sort dialog (the sort modes could be put into a spinner).\n. @banderos101 the list is in the readme.\n@an0n981 Have you tried exporting, using the clear all option and re-importing?\n. For internet, it will ask first for inet. If you say deny all, it will still ask about the other dangerous functions in that category. You can tell because the prompt is coloured red.\nAm I right?\n. The problem with storage/media and storage/sdcard is that they can only be applied on app startup, and launchers tend to stick around.\nI agree that a temporary allow option could be useful. Another use case.\nYou don't want facebook tracking your location, but when on holiday you like to be able to geotag your posts. So you will often Deny, but sometimes Allow.\n. I can see what you mean, but I can also see myself using XPrivacy in ondemand mode permanently. In which case if I am going to be prompted for a function, I don't care whether it is stored as restricted or not.\nSo, having just one checkbox and filling it with a \"?\" for undetermined categories/functions would be a nice friendly simple option.\n. if \"?\" supercedes the original column, why not just put a \"?\" in the original column? That would be my suggestion.\n. Something like that.\n. Thanks.\nA quick update - the settings are now stored in a database that isn't in the usual app data directory. So clearing app data by the usual methods doesn't work any more.\n. 1. A couple of days ago, I would have agreed. Now, I can see myself leaving on demand on.\n2. The default isn't to allow, it is to deny once.\n3. The feature is in development, so your comments are welcome.\n. That is totally normal. In order to protect your privacy, XPrivacy applies a template of restrictions to newly installed apps - the template is pretty restrictive in order to prevent apps from having access to your private data before you get around to configuring them.\nSo, from now on, if you care about your privacy, you will have to work a little to configure new apps when you install them.\n. Apart from my comment, all this looks good. Thanks Jimmy.\n. It gets stuck during boot.\nhttp://pastebin.com/8mJ6uV2K\n. L39 of XLocale if (isRestricted(param)) ends up trying to log stuff, and the logging code calls Locale.getDefault() and we have Ouroboros.\n. If ever getDatabase doesn't return a valid database you get a similar loop through Util.log\n. Locale.setDefault sets a private static variable in the Locale class\nhttp://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/root/jdk/openjdk/6-b27/java/util/Locale.java#Locale.0defaultLocale\nSo it could be run (almost) anywhere.\nconfig.locale changes the translation used\nLocale.setDefault changes the result of Locale.getDefault and therefore will change the behaviour of String.format - so dates won't necessarily appear as usual.\nAs this fundamentally changes the user experience, it should either be marked \"dangerous\", or put in a category by itself, or both. What do you think?\n. It is far from perfect, but it might stop people submitting Facebook with loadLibrary blocked.\nOther ideas include restricting each package separately rather than grouping them by uid.\n. Which commit do you mean?\n. Sorry. Gotcha. It will help a little.\n. Yet again, thanks and a small change: 0d715456172d19c0618bb46201e564d086de5dbf\nFor Build.SERIAL I prefer \"Due to its static nature\", I'll explain: it is just a bit of data attached to an object given to the app, which the app reads directly rather than getting the value through a function call. That is why it is said to be \"static\".\nI didn't change anything there because I can't think of a way to express it better.\n. A big thanks for you help in this!\nI've made a small change, that I hope clarifies the text on dangerous functions, see 4b1896b4a16.\nDo change it if you see fit.\n. Thanks for the update!\n. @Jimmy34742 I understand some of your difficulties.\nI don't know whether @Pyrohh found the option to comment on individual lines or not, but they all appear in the pull request's main conversation view for me too.\nOnce you have made a pull request, if you add commits to that branch they are automatically included. I can see your last update was made ~3 hours ago, around the same time you posted your rant.\n. Thanks again.\nSome small changes here e4cf4b542ea247c1c54f1b0d2586fdec7b30013e.\nPlease do correct my changes if you see fit.\n. #### I shall try to summarize the issues mentioned here\n- How to tell from the checkbox + ? whether a prompt will be shown for a restriction\nThe ? means that the prompt will be shown.\n\n\nWhat happens when you install XPrivacy when you already have a lot of apps installed.\n\n@M66B has already replied - apps already installed are left alone, you can start restricting them as and when you like.\n\n\nUser definable indication of the function's importance.\n\nMy idea is as follows, we already highlight dangerous apps with red. We could add green and yellow too. So that if you see a popup with a green background you know, (because you chose that colour for that function) that most of the time you are going to allow (or deny) it, which saves thinking about it too much. And a yellow background could mean - \"You had better think about this one a bit\".\n\n\nThe two column idea - two columns would match what gets stored for each app.\n\nMost of the time, if I know I'm going to be asked about a function - I don't care whether it is stored as restrict+ask or as allow+ask. The only case where I might want to know is if I am thinking about turning off prompting for an app. Is that really that common - or would replacing the check with a question mark when a function will be asked about be a good idea?\nI suggest three states for functions. check, blank, and \"?\". And four/five states for categories, keeping the filled square meaning some restricted & some allowed, and maybe adding a question mark on top of a filled square meaning some asked for too.\nThat way it will be obvious when functions are asked for, but the underlying state is a little more hidden.\nIf you want pictures, I can make some.\n. Functionally \"restrict+ask\" is the same as \"allow+ask\". You get asked.\nSo why should I care which of the two it is?\n. I would want to know if I was considering turning off prompting, but maybe that is a corner case that we can ignore. Maybe not\nIf the checkboxes allowed you to switch between the three states, you'd cover most use cases.\n. We could discuss the options till the cows come home, but maybe the simplest option for the moment is for me to code some tri/quad-state checks and we can release a test version to see how we like it. (I've already tried, so it won't be much work.)\n@M66B I think you'd like it if you tried it.\n. Some of the issues mentioned here have been addressed, others have resurfaced in new issues.\nSo I shall close this, rather long, issue. If anything has been forgotten, please create new issues.\n. If there is a \"?\", the check/filled box/empty box is largely irrelevant. You will be asked and the timeout default is not dependant on the check state.\n. Pourquoi l'avoir ferm\u00e9? C'\u00e9tait plut\u00f4t du bon travail.\nJe ne vois qu'une modification \u00e0 y apporter: Veuillez envoyer vos restrictions pour aider les autres\n. Thanks for your help!\n. I dream of writing my own launcher, but I don't think I'll ever get around\nto it. It would have category tabs instead of folders - rather like Smart\nLauncher - only better. And, of course, it would have \"Open app in\nXPrivacy\" and other similar options.\n. The problem with hooking the long-press on icon action is that the long-press is often used to move an app around the screen, or remove it, or ...\nSome launchers do show a context menu at that point, but generally a custom one that would be hard to hook into.\nShort of customizing the available open-source launchers out there, I can't see how it can be done.\n. Does it work reliably on a wide range of roms, including stock roms that often customise that page?\n. Maybe we should add a spinner to the top of the page.\nIf you want to reduce the number of menu options in the app list, you could combine toggle, fetch and submit into a single one called \"Batch operation\".\nImport and export are generally linked to the global app state, so I'd leave them in the app list menu.\nFetch and submit are more closely linked to individual apps, so I'd leave them in the app details menu and hide them from the main list menu.\n. Exactly, I'd hide it under Batch ops in the menu and put it in the spinner, or maybe start by even showing a dialog.\n. I'm guessing that if you mark non-stable releases as being \"pre-releases\" then stable ones will always be easy to find.\n. Some functions are blocked, some are fed fake data, some get an empty list. It depends on the function. I think the usage list is fine as it is, but maybe some way of integrating the fake data settings into the app details view would be a plus.\n. @Dreamdance61 did you edit your post?\nIt sounds more sensible now.\nIf so, github didn't tell me. You ought to have added a comment so that we get notified and the discussion can continue.\n.  'Clear all XPrivacy data' would be so much clearer.\nI've often found myself wondering lately whether I want to \"Toggle\nrestrictions\" or \"Clear all data\".\n. Thanks for the update!\n. Maybe I should leave merging the German update to you Marcel.\n. Good work on the version numbers, thankyou @Phylon.\n(@M66B That commit has been merged, by accident I managed to leave out the second one.)\n. They do offer free plans for open source projects.\nhttps://crowdin.net/page/open-source-project-setup-request\nThough I am not sure that XPrivacy qualifies for point 3.\n3. You do not have Commercial products related to the Open Source\nproject you are requesting a license for.\nOf course, you could try arguing that the pro licences are there simply to\ncover hosting costs.\n. You won't get exactly the same apk file whatever you try. The important\nthing is that it should work as desired on your device.\nNote that you will have to uninstall the version already installed because\nyour build won't be signed by the same certificate, and can't be so because\nyou would need Marcel's private certificate.\nIf it builds ok then you almost certainly have all the required\ndependancies.\n. If someone already has a list of id -> md5 pairs, then they don't need to\ndo a lot of work.\nUsing a salted md5( Android ID + \"xprivacy\" ) would get round that problem.\nThey would then have to do a lot of work.\nMigration would be a problem. Maybe we should keep the idea in case we redo\nthe submissions system later on.\nOn 14 February 2014 21:05, an0n981 notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nWhile reviewing the client and server side code regarding submitting of\nrestrictions, I realized that there is basically an SQL db somewhere on the\nworld wide web identifying our devices with every app we have installed and\nwhich restrictions we have set for each of these apps.

I think we need an option to intelligently turn off prompting making sure that everything that hasn't yet been asked for gets restricted.\n. If a restriction's access isn't detected by the prompt, then it isn't detected at all and we have a problem.\nThe database stores two things:\n- restrict / allow\n- ask / don't ask\nSimply turning off prompting will result in the ask state being ignored. The problem is that where the ui shows a question mark the stored restrict state could be either allow or deny. Mostly we don't care because in either case you'll be asked, providing asking is enabled.\nThat is why we need to write a better \"Turn off prompting\" option.\nRestoring the original settings isn't feasible, but an intelligent selection based on previous replies to the prompt + the template, would be easy enough to implement.\n. Good point, my template restricts everything, so I never miss the ability to apply the template.\nI too, often find myself wiping an apps restrictions and starting again with the prompts.\nHow about the following in the batch ops we've been talking about elsewhere #1319 \n- Restrict all\n- Apply template\n- Turn off prompting\n- Clear all\n- Fetch\n- Submit\nThe turn off prompting option would set the not yet asked-for functions/categories according to the template.\n. Sorry, I was wrong - sometimes the prompt isn't shown, for example if the caller isn't an application - which presumably means that it is part of android - in which case the default is to allow. Other exceptions include system apps if the setting Restrict system apps isn't checked, and a few others to avoid lockups and bootloops. Prompts aren't shown during booting and the default in that case, I think is to deny for user apps.\nI think that for everything a user might care about the prompts are shown.\nThe ones whose usage can't be detected are generally restricted when the info is prepared because we can't intercept the app's attempt to read it. So the prompt shows when the info is prepared, such as on app start for inet, sdcard and media.\n. @banderos101  The turn off prompting option would set the not yet asked-for functions/categories according to the template.\nIn other words, if you have already been asked and said Allow/deny permanently - that will not be overwritten\n. Gotcha. Manual choices and permanent prompt choices are stored the same. There is no way to distinguish them.\n. That sounds pretty sensible.\nObjection: there is no way to turn off prompting for all apps in one go.\nResponse: true. But in the current state, if you do turn prompting off globally, there is no knowing what will be allowed/restricted afterwards.\nWe'd do better by implementing a proper turn off prompting option.\n. Thanks\n. I don't understand properly. Are you saying apps that didn't have prompting are showing prompts?\n. We know there are problems with the checkboxes and on-demand. We are working on it.\n. dSploit needs root. I don't know how much it can do without root.\nPresumably not that much.\nEven on linux programs that want to do tricksy things with network packets\ngenerally need root access, and let's not forget that android runs on linux.\n. There are different sorts of time\ngetSystemTimeMillis reports the number of milliseconds since the device has booted and is often used for delays, animations and so on. Things would get really weird if we restricted that.\nOn the other hand being able to set a time zone and have the other time functions adjust time accordingly would be much more doable.\n. Maybe all we need to do is to call TimeZone.setTimeZone( defaced timezone ) early in the apps startup\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/TimeZone.html#setDefault(java.util.TimeZone)\nOn the other hand, this is something that will have a direct effect on the users experience. Much less than changing the locale and thus the translation used in apps.\nXPrivacy currently doesn't have any notion of optional restrictions - for things like the locale or the timezone that vaguely help identify the user, but that most people will prefer not to use because of the effect on the user experience. So I vote against.\n. It is the user experience I'm worried about, because restriction will be enabled by default, users would have to turn it off for apps that display time annoyingly incorrectly. Of which to be honest there aren't that many. I'll change my vote.\n. If an app doesn't use internet, the importance of restricting is mitigated,\nand if an app does use internet then the device's external ip address or\nthat of the router, is a good source of rough location info. When on a data\nconnection this can be really inaccurate - I've seen ~200kms, it is\nprobably far more accurate on a wifi connection on ISP's that give\nunchanging ip addresses. Ever wondered how google know roughly where you\nare when you are using a pc without gps?\nThe only way to get round that is to use a vpn and I doubt many users will\ntake that step largely negating any benefit for 90% of users.\n. That is the usual way, but not the only way. See this page\nhttp://www.ipligence.com/geolocation for me it is accurate to 1-2km on my\nhome internet connection.\n. As far as I know google don't, but an app that connects to a dedicated server could easily do that.\n. Presumably that means that all the functions are already individually\nstored, each thus overriding the category \"?\".\nTo verify that, could you run as root via adb, or in a terminal\nsqlite3 /data/xprivacy/xprivacy.db\nfollowed by\nselect * from restriction where uid=10094;\nat the sqlite prompt. Then post the result back here.\n. Does open require one too?\nIf so, the hook could check.\n. For the IPC transfer and for toString calls, yes.\nHowever setSettingInternal reads setting.value directly, and that value could be null.\nhttps://github.com/jpeg729/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/PrivacyService.java#L861\n. I've just seen the db.delete line just above that line. You are right.\n. Go into Manage whitelists, and the ones that are checked are whitelisted, the ones that aren't checked are blacklisted.\nAt the prompt, check Whitelist x and then click Deny.\n. Try replacing address.toString() by address.getHostName() on the following line\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/XIoBridge.java#L72\nIt I don't think it does a lookup, it will return a hostname if it has one, and the ip address otherwise.\nI've tried it, it works fairly well. I'm guessing that when an app tries to open a connection to abc.com, that is what goes into the InetAddress object that is used.\n. How about only submitting functions marked used?\nAnd if a function is marked used & on-demand we could take exceptions into account as you propose.\n. Fetching could start by applying the template and then tweaking according to the received data.\nJust an idea, but I've got the feeling that the usage data properly combined with the restriction data could be used to good effect.\n. Done.\n. If you open the template settings and click repeatedly on some of the options, you can get them to show a tick mark meaning Restrict + don't ask. BUT applying the template will wipe previous settings. There is currently no easy way around this.\nThat said, we could improve the toggle restrictions option to enable/disable on-demand for the selected category only.\n. Could it be that the installations that weren't restricted finished just before a system reboot and thus that the package sent the package-has-been-installed message, but that XPrivacy didn't have time to apply the template before the phone rebooted?\n. I can't see anything in the restrictions, nor in the usage data that could cause the problem.\nHave you really frozen all those system apps? That's a long list.\nAgain, I can't see the problem, unless samsung have wired things up differently and that one of those apps is in league with the package manager. Strange that it only fails sometimes.\nI really haven't got the faintest clue.\n. Haven't people been asking for a way to enable on-demand for a single\ncategory like internet to loads of apps at once?\nOn 2 March 2014 09:17, Marcel Bokhorst notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nMaybe leave the option to disable on demand for when something went wrong\n(somebody actually had the problem I anticipated, an on demand 'hell').\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/pull/1492#issuecomment-36448930\n.\n. Which is a little obscure.\n\nDid you see the second commit? It fixes a ui bug.\n. Also, the share ui does nothing to indicate that the first three toggle options can apply to a single category, but that the last two are always applied to each app as a whole.\n. I hadn't seen that. Good point.\n. I've been laid up with the flu for the last week.\n@M66B I can understand not wanting to add lots of not very useful code to the codebase, and I can also understand wanting to make an operation really hard to find for most users, but I'm not sure I do understand why this should be one of those cases.\nSupposing I prefer my template for contacts to be restrict+asked, but then I want to set contacts to ask for a dozen apps. I'd have to modify my template, apply it to that category for those apps, then re-modify my template. Seems like a lot of work, and I'd probably never have thought of applying the template to a single category, for me the name suggests an app-wide application. Even if I had I wouldn't have considered using it to apply on-demand to a category.\n. Good point.\n. 1. You have a point about the primary user being the most clued up. You may be able to export as the primary user and import as the secondary user. That would ease things along.\n2. I don't think apps could access much information concerning the primary user, if any, when running as the secondary user. So the possible leaks should only effect the secondary user's privacy, though the possibility of some people connecting the device's id to both of you is a possible concern.\n. If I am reading it right a restricted profile is not a secondary user, just a sort of guest mode running in the same user. In which case the same restrictions present for that user are used, and it would be quite hard to change that.\nAlso, when you set up the profile you can choose which apps are available - so at that point you should just choose to not allow access to XPrivacy. This may not hide its icon, I don't know, and given that SuperSU is closed source, it might not be easy to find out how to hide it.\nIn that case, we don't need to make any changes to XPrivacy. Except maybe to disable prompting when the restricted profile is active.\n. Disabling XPrivacy app does not disable the XPrivacy service which runs inside the system process as part of android. So you will still be protected.\n. Were you expecting it to restrict all the functions in the category right away?\nBecause individual function settings are only reset when clearing a category.\nSo, what might have happened is that the category was set to allow+ask, and at a prompt you chose to allow a function. That adds a setting for that function without touching the category. Then later you try to restrict the entire category in the ui, and it keeps the function allowed the first time round.\n. On-demand is not enabled for that app, so instead of setting everything to \"allow+ask\" it sets everything to \"deny+don't ask\" (except for the dangerous functions).\nYou need to check the box next to the On-off switch situated on the right just above the list of restrictions. Then try applying the template again.\n. Unless you set \"Restrict dangerous functions\" in the main settings, the functions with a red background will never be restricted, that is why some categories show a square in the checkbox - some of the functions in those categories are set to allow+don't ask. (\"?\" means all functions are set to ask, a square means some are, empty means none are.)\nTry clicking on the down arrow to the left of the category name to see the individual functions. See the FAQ for more info on dangerous functions.\n. Oh, I see. The template, like the restrictions has two levels - categories and individual functions.\nThere are two options to apply the template - one applies only the categories, the second applies it to the functions too. Confusing, I know.\n. http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#post(java.lang.Runnable)\nThe runnable does get run on the ui thread. However the docs don't specify when it will be run.\nThe problem is that code in onCreate or onResume runs before the layout has been layed out, so vProgressEmpty has zero width. This was one suggestion I found to work around that problem. An alternative would be to register a ViewTreeObserver, but that uses a few more lines of code.\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/6939002/if-i-call-getmeasuredwidth-or-getwidth-for-layout-in-onresume-they-return-0\n. How about \"?android:attr/colorFocusedHighlight\"?\n. I see two options:\n1. Use a ViewTreeObserver\n2. set mProgressWidth when one of the share menu options is chosen.\n. That line is just used to calculate the state of the expert mode checkbox, which isn't stored in the settings.\nIf none are enabled, the UI will assume the user isn't in expert mode.\nTo enable any of the three, just check \"Expert mode\" and their checkboxes will be enabled.\n. I agree. I wasn't really thinking clearly when I added that.\n. I thought of that, but I wasn't sure you like it.\n. In that case we should add some logic to deleteRestrictions too. I'll get to work on it.\n. Can I ask why? Is it so that the adapter gets updated faster?\n. Actually, I'm thinking it would be better to keep two strings because when you have just applied something to several apps Application restart required to apply could be taken for meaning a restart of XP is necessary to apply restrictions to the other apps.\nAlternatively, I could put the s in brackets, but that might not be easily translatable.\nApplication(s) must be restarted to apply changes\n. All but one of the calls to methodRequiresRestart use md.getMethodName() to get the method name. A quick recursive grep shows that isDangerousMethod is always called with md.getMethodName() as the second parameter. That seems a little redundant.\nI took a close look at the use of the MethodDescription(String methodName) constructor. It is used...\n- In ActivityApp where the new object is passed to indexOf\n- In PManager.registerMethod where it is passed to contains\n- In PManager.getRestricted where it is passed to indexOf\nIn short, they are short-lived utility objects.\nSo here is my suggestion.\n- define mMethods as a map mapping restriction name --> list of method names\n- define mMethodDetails as a map mapping method name --> methodDescription object\nThen:\n- indexOf(method) and contains(method) will work with strings, and may well be more efficient\n- we can get rid of the bad constructor in MethodDescription and both isDangerousMethod and methodRequiresRestart\nI think that will make the code generally a bit nicer.\n. It picks up BetterBatteryStats, so I'm guessing yes.\n. PrivacyProvider also calls isDangerousMethod, but IMHO with no real benefit.\nIf we are looking at a restricted category, and the function under scrutiny is marked restricted, then put that in the cursor anyway. But PrivacyProvider already contains all the necessary checks for dangerous functions.\nI believe this code is only ever run for an exportation, and that might be exactly the behaviour you want.\n. What about doing a package name check to make sure we are not using up ram on every app load?\n. I suppose that meta.xml gets parsed once for every app that gets hooked, and given that the hooks don't need to know about the restart parameter we could skip that part.\n. I wanted a fancy countdown, but a postDelayed would be fine too.\nI tested the code without the +5000 and the list updated but showed nothing new.\n. You are right. It is completely unnecessary.\nOn 23 December 2013 17:38, Marcel Bokhorst notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nIn src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/ApplicationInfoEx.java:\n\n@@ -187,7 +193,14 @@ public String toString() {\n@Override\npublic int compareTo(ApplicationInfoEx other) {\n-       return TextUtils.join(\", \", getApplicationName()).compareToIgnoreCase(\n-       if (mContext == null)\n\nWhy is this needed?\nStoring a context for later use is not a good idea in general.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/pull/1004/files#r8530875\n.\n. Good point\n. Yes, you're right. But that behaviour seems a little inconsistent to me.\nWhy leave the fetch menu enabled and not the import/export?\nA more consistent alternative would be to add view actions to optionImport and optionExport.\n\nBesides I think that the mBatchOpRunning checks are obsolete - which raises a question for me - what happens if ActivityShare receives another intent when it is already running?\n. Yes, I checked. As for strings the contents are compared.\n. I would suggest \"Effacer toutes les donn\u00e9es\", because it wipes everything.\n. If you want to remove that exception, then you have to add mresult.asked = true here.\n. The paragraph has a newline in the middle of a sentence.\nAlso, the following is more accurate. \"An orange warning triangle icon will be displayed in XPrivacy as soon as an attempt has been made to access data in a category.\"\n. @M66B shouldn't this step be replaced by using the menu option to clear all data?\n. It does clear them now doesn't it?\n. No, in line 48 it was already correctly named.\n. If !dangerous && hook.isDangerous then you never get prompts. The value of asked is irrelevant.\nThe ui ought to reflect that. Always setting it to asked=true, is one way to garantee that.\n. As I said before if !dangerous and hook.isDangerous - the value of asked is irrelevant - so this is for the ui.\n. Because reading a string from an sqlite db where the stored value is null, might or might not work depending on the implementation of sqlite. (That's roughly what the android docs say.)\n. Easily done by adding \"Whitelist.\" to each of the cWhitelistConstants, except for those for Accounts, etc.\n. I'd rather put it just before the cache, so as to keep the !result.asked condition.\n. So until you have decided that you have whitelisted everything useful and you turn of asking for that restriction, you will have to keep hitting deny once for the ones you don't want to whitelist.\nBlacklisting is going to be almost as popular as whitelisting.\nHowever what would simplify things here would be to delete whitelist settings rather than disabling them by setting them to \"\".\n. Dunno, I thought maybe I should be careful.\n. And slow down ActivityApp's start-up.\nSure, we could, but is that a good idea?\n. I'll have to think about that, because of the cache.\n. Actually deleting rather than disabling wouldn't help here, we still need three return values: whitelist, blacklist and neither.\n. No, there is only a white list when you have explicitly asked for some at the prompt. What other possibilities did you have in mind?\nAn empty dialog would be an option.\n. Whitelisting should set mresult.asked for the cache, but won't set it in the database. Setting mresult.asked will make the boolean whitelisted unnecessary. You still want to be asked about other values.\n. One problem is that the whitelist check is currently situated just after the cache update code.\nIf I move it so it gets cached, and set mresult.asked, then the check won't run again (until you reboot) and the prompt won't show either. The boolean whitelisted just made sure the prompt was skipped if the extra was found to be whitelisted.\n. ",

    "liudongmiao": "sorry, i don't know what's \"a solid work\".\ni don't test on Android 4.0+ device, but the xprivacy can be opened on android 4.3 emulator.\nfrom ALL to ANY, there is two reason, ALL means 255.255.255.255, and ANY means 0.0.0.0. if there is no ip, it seems android shows it as 0.0.0.0; second, there is no ALL in gingerbread.\nno copy for contentprovider, it just because there is no cursor.getType in gingerbread. however, i remove these code, and try guess type when there is no cursor.getType. however, it will only work on SQLiteCursor. (I think most of the cursor in android is SQLiteCursor).\nfor other things in java code, i changed to api to 10, then i find all the unresolved fileds/methods, add the corresponding fileds/methods for gingerbread. \nhowever, there is api related. for example, the clipboard defines in asset/meta.xml, the sdk should be 14. however, even we registered them, they are never be called, so i think its safe.\n// i have check all the class and methods, there is only clipboard, and two partial-methods..\n// isConnected()Z  for BluetoothSocket. other networkinfo has it.\n// getAuthToken(Landroid/accounts/Account;Ljava/lang/String;Landroid/os/Bundle;ZLandroid/accounts/AccountManagerCallback;Landroid/os/Handler;)Landroid/accounts/AccountManagerFuture; for AccountManager. \nhowever, as i said, this only registered method, if never be called for such condition.\nfurthermore, the @rovo89 said the backported-xposed* wont be merged into current xposed....so i think, you may wont support gingerbread either. \nwhats the license for XPrivacy?\n. for all, or any...\nall = 255.255.255.255, any = 0.0.0.0.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0.0.0.0\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/255.255.255.255\ni think any, i.e 0.0.0.0 is better.\nA special definition exists for the IP broadcast address 255.255.255.255. It is the broadcast address of the zero network or 0.0.0.0, which in Internet Protocol standards stands for this network, i.e. the local network. Transmission to this address is limited by definition, in that it is never forwarded by the routers connecting the local network to other networks.\n. thanks.\nyes, i agree not to support gb is a good solution. however, im using gb with a physical keyboard android. may someday,i will try to port cm to it.\ndo you have an apk to do something like unit testing?.for ui things, i can click the button; for the restriction, i cannot make sure it would work. i will install the testing tool\ni think gpl can make money, but must be free (free not means money related) to get/modify source...however, no one will make money if its distributed in gpl v3.\nhttp://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#DoesTheGPLAllowMoney\nhttp://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#CompanyGPLCostsMoney\nif you want to other forkers not make money from your work, i think you should change to other license.\n.

To @jokies, as I should back-ported to GB, so I watched this project and several projects. Then I can get the update whenever codes update or push requests are added. If I find there are similar push request, I won't create a new one.\nAfter translation, usually I will build a new version and install my device. I seldom use emulator, I have  Moto xprt and moto droid mini.\n. Thanks @jokies . And please add Simplified Chinese in the push request title if possible. For example, Translated new strings can be Translated new strings for simplified chinese. Normally, if I didn't find it in the push request list https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/pulls, I will create a new one (I think others do this too). It's hard to click and open every push request to check whether the push request actually does.\nFor example, I think https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/pull/1099 is much better, it show clearly in the title of push request.\n. @M66B what's the creative solution?\n. Its for gingerbread. However, you can ignore it directly.\n. Wait for a minutes, i'll take a screenshot.\n. Yes, you're right. current it's clearer.\n. Just move the codes from util.\n. Some can be update, but other can be ignored.\nSo, I don't think the new translation is better than current.\n@shenm233 I think it's better to let the original translator know.\n. ",
    "bitterskittles": "Thanks for the quick response. Installed 1.9.4 and now the app won't start if NFC/getDefaultAdapter is blocked, but works fine when the restriction is lifted.\nThere's one more thing tho. I tried to read a tag with Automagic app with all NFC filters turned on, and it did read the tag. NFC function calls weren't even registered in XPrivacy's usage log :/\n. CatLog saves the log to a txt file, but can't find it when I connect the phone to USB xD\n. restricting NFC/getDefaultAdapter prevents Automagic from writing to NFC tags, but it can still read the tags when all NFC restrictions are in place.\nI have checked the usage but no other app seems to trigger NFC rules when a tag is read :/\n. Awesome, I'll check as soon as possible.\nBy the way, could you close the issues via commit messages please? makes it easier to track the changes related to the issue.\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages\n. I could make use of an app specific settings feature too: Automagic (paid version) breaks if Identification/SERIAL gets changed between uses.\n. > (28) I have restricted locations but my GPS status icon still appears\n\nThat is correct, XPrivacy only replaces the real location by a fake location. It even uses the real location to randomize the fake location. The idea is that everything should appear as normal as possible to an application.\n\nso what you're saying by your definition of \"normal\" is basically it is not \"normal\" if I decided to leave my phone powered on somewhere where it has a constant GPS accuracy and location.\namirite?\n. I understand the privacy concerns about Google Ad ID, however it is app specific (gapps), and the same app has an opt-out mechanism. Not to mention that it is not related to Android OS as gapps are optional.\n. properties of an InputDevice, coupled with other data, can be used to create a unique fingerprint.\nplease consider reopening the issue\n. thanks\n. > @M66B: Because it is not related to your privacy = identify you and collect data about you.\nPlease open https://panopticlick.eff.org/ with a regular browser, and with Tails Live CD or Whonix Workstation, and compare. It's called fingerprinting.\nApp1 = use over normal internet connection\nApp2 = use over Orbot\nFingerprint(App1) == Fingerprint(App2) => insta-denonymization\n. Issue #703 \nI was thinking the same thing, then thought might be better to have a \"reset\" option in the app that deletes everything but the license file.

I respect your right to dismiss this...\nhowever,  it really is a deal breaker... at least for me.\nI have to have custom locations for at least three different  apps.  there is no noticeable slow down with pdroid doing this.\nI hate for this to be the only reason to have to stay with pdroid as I really fell in love with what you have done so far. \n. I have a few apps that I use to check if permissions are being blocked...none of them request root, yet have access to information from build.prop as well as other system files.   maybe it would work to block an app from reading everything? or spoof any file requests to a dummy file.\n. its not really about fixing faulty hardware...\n1. why is it relying on real data to then generate random false data...seems slower. even with good hardware.\n2. if i am not going to use random but instead i enter a set value.  why does it need to still wait for real data.\n. 1. no...if i manually set a specific location. why does the real data even matter.\nand on that note... the bonus to the way pdroid sets it is i don't even need to have gps on.\nso it saves time...battery... and doesn't slow the system down doing needless calculations to achieve a location only to spoof it anyway.\n. my suggestion is not to focus on faulty hardware or battery drain etc...\nI am suggesting to simplify the way you generate the random location data.\nthe benefits I mentioned are only a bonus to optimizing your app.\nI have seen you make claims about not wanting to implement certain features because\nit  will \"slow\" down the phone creating \"lag\" etc...\nso all I am saying is that if you can spoof the location without relying on the actual gps\nthen your app is running this function more efficiently. \nalso I have a few gps apps that because of your way of generating the spoofed location\nI am watching my location bounce all over the world every second or two.\ninstead of just spoofing to just one location.\nto me that is a definite flag that the location is being spoofed...\nI don't think that is what spoofing gps should do. \n. shouldn't it only randomize once at start of an app?\nnot constantly re-randomizing while the app is running.\n. sorry...I think we are getting sidetracked here...\nforget about the jumping location...the faulty hardware...battery...etc...\ncan we have it where I can manually set the gps location for a given app without it requiring to depend on real data from the gps sensor.\nI understand if you programed the random function to rely on the real data then that is how it has to work.\n(even if I don't think that is efficient)\nbut when I am manually setting a fixed location for an app... \ncouldn't it just use that info I entered without all the extra processing of real gps?\n. just curious...\nfor what reason?\n. I have the feeling you think I am arguing with you...\nI am in product development so I enjoy helping devs improve their apps...\nlike I said..

I created several stack traces, forced all Set-/GetUserAgent, parent/child methods and linked lists/hashtables with constants but there's still an alternative runtime path. I couldn't find a proper target.\nThe browser uses an internal counter for custom user agents (overriding system static string from framework-res.apk). If that value is '0' system static settings are in effect. I traced it back and forth into several system parts browser.apk/framework-res.apk/WebviewChromium.jar and also stumbled upon native methods but whatever i touched the original user agent always came through. The shared/static system settings are kinda hard to trace offline. They use exceptions and abstract methods to sync the settings and i don't have a proper debug chain installed.\nMy theory is that the browser omits filling the user agent value on purpose so that the system fills it up with static system values. But i couldn't test it yet...\n. Didn't you already hooked getUserAgentString? It's present in the pastebin log above. \nI haven't found any new methods i haven't had verified already being ineffective as well. I will poke around some more later.\n. Still no go...\nLog:\nStartpage.com (probably faked) -> useragentstring.com (unfaked)\nbrowser restart -> useragentstring.com (faked)\nI/XPrivacy/XWebView( 1928): android: hooked android.webkit.WebView.constructor/view (4)\nI/XPrivacy/XWebView( 1928): android: hooked android.webkit.WebView.getSettings/null (1)\nI/XPrivacy/XWebView( 6541): Queue usage data=10027/view/WebView.constructor=true size=3\nI/XPrivacy/XWebView( 6541): get 10027/WebView.constructor view=restricted (file)\nI/XPrivacy/XWebSettings( 6541): com.android.browser: hooked android.webkit.WebSettings.getDefaultUserAgent/view (1)\nI/XPrivacy/XWebSettings( 6541): com.android.browser: hooked com.android.webview.chromium.ContentSettingsAdapter.getUserAgent/view (1)\nI/XPrivacy/XWebSettings( 6541): com.android.browser: hooked com.android.webview.chromium.ContentSettingsAdapter.getUserAgentString/view (1)\nI/XPrivacy/XWebSettings( 6541): com.android.browser: hooked com.android.webview.chromium.ContentSettingsAdapter.setUserAgent/view (1)\nI/XPrivacy/XWebSettings( 6541): com.android.browser: hooked com.android.webview.chromium.ContentSettingsAdapter.setUserAgentString/view (1)\nI/XPrivacy/XWebSettings( 6541): Queue usage data=10027/view/setUserAgentString=true size=4\nI/XPrivacy/XWebSettings( 6541): get 10027/setUserAgentString view=restricted (file)\nI/XPrivacy/XWebSettings( 6541): get 10027/setUserAgentString view=restricted (cached)\nI/XPrivacy/XWebSettings( 6541): get 10027/setUserAgentString view=restricted (cached)\nI/XPrivacy/XWebView( 6541): Queue usage data=10027/view/WebView.constructor=true size=7\nI/XPrivacy/XWebView( 6541): get 10027/WebView.constructor view=restricted (file)\nI/XPrivacy/XWebSettings( 6541): Queue usage data=10027/view/setUserAgentString=true size=7\nI/XPrivacy/XWebSettings( 6541): get 10027/setUserAgentString view=restricted (file)\nI/XPrivacy/XWebSettings( 6541): get 10027/setUserAgentString view=restricted (cached)\nI/XPrivacy/XWebView( 6541): Queue usage data=10027/view/WebView.constructor=true size=2\nI/XPrivacy/XWebView( 6541): get 10027/WebView.constructor view=restricted (file)\nI/XPrivacy/XWebSettings( 6541): Queue usage data=10027/view/setUserAgentString=true size=3\nI/XPrivacy/XWebSettings( 6541): get 10027/setUserAgentString view=restricted (file)\nI/XPrivacy/XWebSettings( 6541): get 10027/setUserAgentString view=restricted (cached)\nI/XPrivacy/XWebSettings( 6541): Queue usage data=10027/view/setUserAgentString=true size=3\nI/XPrivacy/XWebSettings( 6541): get 10027/setUserAgentString view=restricted (file)\n. I've traced the string some more. The one in framework.res (strings.xml) seems to be obsolete/outdated:\nMozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android %s) AppleWebKit/534.30 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 %sSafari/534.30\nThe real user agent string is:\nMozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 4.4; GT-I9300 Build/KRT16S) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Chrome/30.0.0.0 Mobile Safari/537.36\nNote the 534.30 <> 537.36. Probably legacy string from old engine not needed in new chromium engine anymore.\nI just started analyzing the native chromium libraries (20MB monster). It seems it does contain the real user-agent string mask (Mozilla/5.0 (%s) AppleWebKit/%d.%d (KHTML, like Gecko) %s Safari/%d.%d). I've hooked some native methods already leading to nothing (same partial leak) but there must be another bit/flag/switch/setting/whatever that leads to different runtime path (ignoring all setUserAgentString methods).\nI will cross reference the string mask to see whats involved.\n. They just started implementing chromium. Several things are still buggy like saving passwords, incognito mode and some dialogs/TextViews (like the one that pops up when you want to change the theme on XDA forum). Logcat shows crash due to \"Not implemented yet\". :-)\n. Can you try hooking Landroid.webkit.WebView.loadUrl? Its an 'abstract method' that leads to Chromium for KitKat and into Webkit(?) for others. If this works all other user-agent related hooks for all systems should be obsolete.\nThe class holds two methods. Both are used in Android Browser.\n.method public loadUrl(Ljava/lang/String;)V\n.method public loadUrl(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/util/Map;)V\n1st argument is URL, 2nd is additional http header parameters including user-agent. \nXPrivacy could force-jump 1st method into 2nd one and 2nd method could be hooked with (static) faked 2nd argument holding the user-agent.\nIf that's not possible, unreasonable or doesn't work we can still tackle Chromium directly by enforcing something like the below runtime path as a last resort. Its probably not as \"code evolution resistant\" as the loadUrl method above though.\njava.lang.Throwable: stack dump\njava.lang.Thread.dumpStack(Thread.java:489)\ncom.android.org.chromium.content.browser.LoadUrlParams.setOverrideUserAgent(LoadUrlParams.java:204)\ncom.android.org.chromium.android_webview.AwContents.loadUrl(AwContents.java:879)\ncom.android.webview.chromium.WebViewChromium.loadUrlOnUiThread(WebViewChromium.java:629)\ncom.android.webview.chromium.WebViewChromium.loadUrl(WebViewChromium.java:524)\nandroid.webkit.WebView.loadUrl(WebView.java:785)\ncom.android.browser.Tab.loadUrl(Tab.java:1747)\nsetOverrideUserAgent is integer, held '2' as i logged and is only called when fake was successful. Probably involved in enabling honoring setUserAgentString internally. Somewhere there i expect the target. Haven't looked all too thoroughly into this yet. I hope we don't need it...\n. Still no go...\nThe problematic case is when a webpage opens a new tab/view by itself. If a page will be opened explicitly by 'open in new tab' the tab is stable/faked under every condition. But when it's been opened automatically by pressing a link its unfaked. Going into URL bar just pressing -enter- fakes the page for one shot. Reloading the page falls back to unfaked. Reloading also has none of the hooked methods involved (at least none show up with grep XWeb).\nThese two 'open new tab' scenarios show different runtime paths. The stable one shows 'setUserAgentString' and 'LoadUrl'. The unstable one only has 'setUserAgentString'.\nI've disabled hooking 'LoadUrl' and it doesn't show any difference so its probably not of any use.\nI will inject more stack dumps and watch variables to analyze the two scenarios. There's still enough left i haven't looked into...\nUA_OVERRIDE_FALSE:I\nUA_OVERRIDE_INHERIT:I\nUA_OVERRIDE_TRUE:I\ngetUserAgentLocked\nnativeUpdateUserAgentLocked\nnativeGetDefaultUserAgent\nsetUserAgentOverride\nnativeSetUseDesktopUserAgent\nnativeGetUseDesktopUserAgent\n. Its a bug in the chromium engine (native code). The chromium internal child tabs do not properly inherit parent properties delivered from Android/Java code. The built-in custom user-agents (Android browser) are affected as well. Most user actions (\"open in new tab\") result in a new (parent) WebView instance (thus unaffected) compared to clicked links that create new tabs automatically (as child). Unless we can hook native code i'm out of ideas at the moment.\n. Just for reference:\n- The primary source (method) for the browser getting the system user-agent from the engine is 'nativeGetDefaultUserAgent'. It feeds all UA variables but hooking involves some risks since the browser compares old/new user-agent in some cases and prevents (if both equally) calling methods involved in overriding UA intentionally (thus native code will never be contacted about an intended change/override resulting in untouched/unfaked UA).\n- loadUrl is somewhat more reliable than setUserAgentString on child tabs. Its the only hook that remains stable on child tabs when an URL is entered manually afterwards (startpage.com->search for 'user agent'->pick useragentstring.com (opens in child tab)->Press enter in URL bar on same address->reload page). 'SetUserAgentString' brakes this behavior if hooked as well (child tab URL reload only stable for one load).\n- There is at least one app (\"Codecheck\") that doesn't like loadUrl. It loads the page but immediately blanks it out. If there are more side-effects like this 'loadUrl' might be a 'dangerous' candidate (unless there's something wrong with the hook implementation).\n. Confirmed. Works both ways properly now (adding/removing permissions).\n. I can successfully allow specific apps to playstore so technically it's working properly. My the next step would be to restrict all custom rom related system apps, XPosed, XPrivacy, SuperSU and such. With whitelisting it would need every newly installed app to be re-added to the list manually. On Blacklisting it would be a one-shot.\n. I thought it would go like this (dynamically on access):\nPackageManager/GetPackagesInstalled->XPrivacy->Playstore\nBut if you say it can't be done you probably push an independent/pre-created/static list to the Playstore instead i guess (or something similar).\n. Is it possible that we are talking about different things here? I'm not talking about ondemand popups. I just want the functionality of the list below inverted (optionally). Instead of sending/allowing the 4 ticked apps it should omit/block these but send all the unticked ones. Theoretically, i could invert-tick all entries to get the same result on current implementation (but that wouldn't register newly installed apps).\n\n. Tested and works properly here. Thanks.\n'Select Applications' could need an '[ALL]' button as well.\nThe '(w)\u2019 icon seems to be stuck once triggered. It doesn't go off even if i disable all items on the list. Will test that some more.\n. Alternatively, instead of blacklisting an option to auto-add newly installed apps to whitelist should lead to same results. More unified, maybe less confusing. Not sure if that's any better...\n. Tested. Whitelist icon fixed. Vanishes properly now.\n. Sorry, i meant sticked icon on whitelist mode is fixed (or i did a mistake before, not sure. At least everything is working as expected now).\nWhitelist icon on Blacklist is always on, yes.\n. Hmm, i think i just realized what you meant by 'privacy risks'. Blacklisting is bound to all three filters (accounts, contacts, applications). You can't have one without the other. That's indeed a problem because contacts and accounts probably should never be blacklisted.\nIf this whole thing gets too complex just drop it. It is nice for Apps, but could be critical for contacts and accounts.\n. Not sure if we mean the same here. I'm talking about a global indicator (in main list view) that shows that the app differs from global settings (has been modified). Otherwise one would check alll apps one by one individually to see if it has been changed in the past (or export the settings and check the xml manually).\n. Just depends on the implementation. The Playstore dynamically pushes any relevant entry (package name) through it in realtime and updates the internal database accordingly. That's why getInstalledPackages misses the 'Installed' marker everywhere (including the 'All' apps tab).\n. Yes, works properly. \n. I think we are talking about different things. Maybe its easier with pictures.\nThese are my templates. There are no OnDemand ticks selected on purpose (but ondemand is globally enabled). When i install a new app the OnDemand tickbox (on main screen) is half-enabled though (see 2nd screenshot). I think that's wrong/confusing as there is no OnDemand sub-function enabled thus the indicator (half-enabled) is misleading and should be off (as stated in the template).\n\n\n. Do not apply the template manually. Install a new app (with explorer) so XPrivacy applies the template itself.\nIf i apply a template (categories+functions) manually to an app that is installed already the ondemand checkbox keeps the previous state.\nI've cleared XPrivacy settings and reimported everything. No change. If it still works for you i will ask on XDA for just another experience to confirm the behavior.\n. > If there is usage data for the function, then the restriction works\n'LinkProperties.getLinkAdresses' is more an indicator for apps that do not get caught anymore rather than a successor API. It doesn't look like 'LinkProperties.getLinkAdresses' (despite having usage data) is involved in DNS requests at all. It only gets called once and only once per session/app start (not per dns request). There is also no additional usage data like value/parameter (that usually shows the requested address) that would prove the DNS requests are done by this API now. \nThere is an increased amount of resolved IPs in AFWall/iptables log that is a result of non-blocked DNS requests even though 'LinkProperties.getLinkAdresses' is restricted. Restricting doesn't seem to have any impact on DNS requests. \nI don't call it a bug. It rather looks like DNS requests are done by some API or method XPrivacy doesn't cover yet.\n. Ok, then everything's fine.\nThanks!\n. ",

How about marking an app as trusted, so as no longer to see upgrade notifications for that one app?\n. Minor issue with your speedy fix: unselecting the last selected app should exit multi select.\n.

I also have the PowerAmp issue. Here's what I tried:\n- made sure that neither PowerAmp nor the Play Store were blocked in any way (none of my system apps are)\n- PowerAmp fails to validate the unlocker\n- uninstalled the PowerAmp unlocker\n- tried to reinstall it from the Play Store\n- got an error, see screenshot (BM-PPH-01 error)\n\nI've captured a log of events up to this point\n- checked in usage data that nothing has been blocked by Xprivacy since I performed the uninstall\n- disabled Xprivacy and rebooted\n- tried installing the unlocker from the Play Store, failed; the log indicated the Play Store was trying to delete something from its cache, so\u2026\n- wiped Play Store data and tried to install again, succeeded\n- installed the unlocker from the Play Store and checked that PowerAmp did successfully validate\n- activated Xprivacy and rebooted\n- PowerAmp error again\nWhat does this tell me:\n~~- the issue is primarily between the Play Store and Xprivacy and this merits  attention from @M66B since it is likely just the tip of the iceberg and other less popular apps may be suffering from this~~\n- PowerAmp does revalidate the license on each boot (but it may allow for the Play Store to be offline indefinitely, whereas the default is to allow only 1 month of leeway, based on verification data returned by the Play Store)\n. For some reason I thought GitHub would autolink it, sorry. Here it is: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8997393\n. You'll see a lot of scalpel error logging\u2026 It's a module that implements Jake Wharton's 3d layout view, pretty cool\u2026 I've just tested that with Scalpel disabled the same thing still happens.\n. Argh, this seems to have been another intermittent Play Store glitch (I replicated the problem twice this morning though). I can now download the unlocker from the Play Store even with XPrivacy enabled.\n. No, the unlocker still does not validate. But I had been under the impression that XPrivacy was causing issues in the Play Store (not just with PowerAmp), and that doesn't seem to be the case.\n. https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8997893\nThis new log does not contain Scalpel (it's disabled) and no IntentReceiverLeaked either.\nUnfortunately it seems pretty clear that the PowerAmp failure is indeed due to XPrivacy: it's been reported by multiple users, and one even pinpointed the issue to a change between .39 and .40.\n\nI went back to .39 with latest poweramp all is fine. \nUpdate to .40 poweramp issue showed up. \nUpdated to .43 disabled all system apps and poweramp same issue. \nDisabled XPrivacy from Xposed reboot all is fine with poweramp. \nOn .43 poweramp works without the unlocker, once unlocker installed got the issue. \nWent back to a older poweramp same outcome, don't work with .40 an above.\n. Shouldn't be, the unlocker uses the same process id as the main app. What\ndoes Xprivacy do in these circumstances?\nOn 14 Feb 2014 12:31, \"Marcel Bokhorst\" notifications@github.com wrote:\nMaybe the template got applied while installing the unlocker (again) ?\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/issues/1340#issuecomment-35076039\n.\n. I'm not sure one-star reviews would be effective: they have many existing reviews, so the few negative reviews we can muster won't matter much.\n\nIn addition, from their point of view this is not a issue they created: it is due to a change in Xprivacy. We understand and support Marcel's decision and he has explained the context so PowerAmp can change the way they perform their verification. But their pace of development is pretty\u2026 deliberate, they'll need time. One these one-star reviews are posted, we'll have very little leverage.\nHas someone reported this issue to them since Marcel concluded his investigation?\n. JP, your kernel for i9300 was the first I installed (sadly just before you wound it down) and I am just as furious at having to resort to pirated versions to be able to run software I paid for. I also write software for a living, and to me each 1-star review hurts, and I answer every message within hours.\nBut the bigger players don't think that way. PowerAmp has sold between 1 and 5 million licenses (at $4 a pop, excluding sales). Any change they make to appease our small band of privacy conscious users, they have to weigh against the potential repercussions on the vastly bigger sea of less technically proficient users.\nYep, let's sit and wait :-)\n.

Please reopen this,\nMany of those red underlayed restrictions are still very privacy sensitive and very few of them really affect the apps in a bad way. So you have to set them if you want to be protected and ignore the red color anyway.\nfor example the restriction \nInternet->inet\nis red, but that is the most important restriction you have to set (although it is red) for most apps, if you really want to prevent that app from contacting the INTERNET.\nThere is needed another warning if you are really about locking your self out, which is only caused by very few combinations of restictions of the \"Google Search\" and \"Google Accounts Manager\"\n. But \"Internet\"->\"connect\" is also red.\nI think such a list of crucial combinations is not so difficult to create, I mean only combinations created by \"non-geek-users\", that just installed xPrivacy on a standard rooted google device with the standard homescreen.\nLets start with the scenario I described here.\nwhat other combinations do you think of that are relevant to simple users?\nI think it is not a good advertisement, if every user, that first tries xP and thinks \"Oh, cool, now I will block the google apps at first!\" will be locked out.\nmost of those users will create a big shitstorm in the App-Ratings i guess. \nAnd it could be easily be prevented if there would be a warning at just these few simple fatal combinations with the \"Google Search\" and \"Google Accounts Manager\"\n. I am talking about the free version here, I think those new users don't have access to such functionality, do they?\nThat list doesn't even have to be complete at all, because each single entry in this list will save hundredths of victims a lot of hassle already and tis wonderful app will gain more and more reputation \n. If you forbid all privileges to Google Search,  you cannot click on the \"all apps\" Button at the bottom to start xPrivacy to revert your changes.\nOnly the shortcuts you have on your homescreen already still work.\nI was lucky, cause I had the play store as a shortcut on my homescreen and from the store I could go to the download page of xPrivacy and from there I could start the app to fix this. but I think many others are not so lucky. worst case, you have to factory reset your device or reinstall a custom rom to get it running again.\n.

Okay, seems the ANR issue with randomize at boot option enabled are fixed now. :+1: \nThe only problem seems now that i can't re-import my .xml backup. I used the import option, nothing happens, app freeze, no dialog nothing (system ui works fine), and after 2 minutes the app close automatically and starts again (nothing was imported). \nHmpf, now I must re-create my rules for over 280 apps. :-1: \n. Yup, I can confirm this behavior. \nI upgraded from .25 to .27 and after restart it hangs on the boot animation. I installed Pry-Fi but never started it (is is generally allowed) don't know if it comes from the app.\nSlimKat 4.4.2 (adb hangs with waiting for device msg). \n. :+1: \n. Wouldn't you agree that restore most of all stuff is better as leave it entirely unprotected after the boot? E.g. if any installed AV crash the system or other freezes happens it remember the state/settings on the next boot, I expect such behavior from an app that claims to secure something.\nI not expect that Xprivacy fix possible freezes that are caused by other apps or the system but leaving this untouched or without any chance to get a notice is an security risk you just ignore. \n. The problem isn't the system, there is currently no exception for such stuff implemented in Xprivacy - that's the point. If I code an example app which crash/freeze the system or Xprivacy the whole app would be useless and hacker/apps possible could execute xyz stuff which isn't proper restricted anymore, well it's a maybe case but I see that very critical since there is no warning/promt or anything which shows that all settings are lost after the next restart (you must re-open the app to see that all is default). Of course we could use an backup, but that also needs a app/system restart + the fact that not everybody will save all changes each time (especially like me since I use a lot of apps). \n\nyour privacy is not automatically restored and the real problem is not solved.\n\nThat's not correct. The privacy you're talking about are only system apps or apps which have full access or boot complete permission implemented which are loaded right after or during the boot. By default Xprivacy not restrict any system critical components (and I also see no valid argument to do that) so that only applies to stuff which already was once executed + the boot permission. In fact such cases are rare. It's still better to have something restricted compared to nothing with no feedback that possible all user settings was lost.\nI'll try to debug the stuff now but I think it have to do with the media-scanner and the fact that at the same time Xprivacy try to generate new stuff which may interference sometimes. But I don't think I'll find something since such case wasn't implemented/respected by Xprivacy. \n. ",

    "kosique": "This would be awesome.\nBut: in case of 50 contacts being delivered this would easily tend to get messy. So this would actually require a per-restriction capable setting that would allow to log ie. your IP address, but not all the contacts being delivered. What do you think?\n. I just don't want to give a direction as I'm not the developer of this surely great app. But I feel like many people tend to get stuck in bootloop, unusable device after _de_installation and such. I think one way to get a little closer to a recovery from stuff like this would be to get XPrivacy to know when it's time to get out of the way. One could maybe implement a thing such as a tracker for unsuccessful boot ups. Once a specific count is reached for the non-success case, Xprivacy should either disable its own or just let go through anything to give people a chance to recover from that threat instead of doing a complete wipe and re-install again. Another approach could be a file in a specific place that contains some specific data that no other app could ever guess.\nI myself would take a good 6 hours to do a full install that satifies me when I have no NANDROID handy. I was not buged by an XPrivacy related re-install ever but I know that very uncomfortable situation from playing around with ie. modified Prism APKs or tries to strip down the size of the system to a bare minimum. One time you have made a dump mistake while stripping the system and you're f***ed.

Nice find.\n. I didn't find anything. But I just took a quick look in the open issues, not the closed ones...\n. Isn't this a duplicate of #723? They refer to the same article at least.\n. Hi Marcel,\nI didn't really get that. Filter on permissions just let's me see all restrictions besides the ones the app claims to use. What I wanted to achieve is that: if any app does not state it needs NFC and then uses NFC - XPivacy should restrict it.\n. OK, again ... the thing is the 'green key' is missing. I don't know that it will use NFC at some point. Same goes for many apps that read your calendar although that have no rights claimed for this. It's quite a fulltime job to restrict almost anything for any app, even when it comes to a clean install. That would take hours. So, if XPrivacy would have an option to let the user select that any access to stuff an app does currently not claim to need rights for is restricted, that would be a BIG-PRIVACY-PLUS and, moreover, a veeeery little overhead in administration for the end user. If than would also a notification would appear that app XYZ used functionality ABC although it did say it will not - that would be great.\nI would donate 10 bucks for that. :) Buying user already since one can buy bulk license.\n.

Download link is not working for me...\n. I would suggest rating PowerAmp down to 1 star, if they take our money and break the app we paid for, maybe this would make them 'fix' this issue they created...\n. I did, just a few hours ago, submitted a support request for both my Note 3 and Nexus 7.\nNonetheless, one-star rating is deserved from my point of view, I agree they need a way to protect themselves, but paying customers are entitled to be able to use the software they paid for (even if it's only a few \u20ac). Locking a software I legally bought and have been using is theft, no matter why it stopped working.\nI work in IT and do development (for a living), but I just can't accept paying customers being unable to use the software they are entitled to using, not when the reason is a flawed copy protection system.\nThe same they need a way to protect themselves from being ripped off by cracked versions, we are entitled to protect our privacy, noone should have access to stuff like phone number, messages, emails etc. unless I allow it. And this kind of nonesense will only encourage people to not use legit versions, so it's pretty counterproductive.\nHence I'm rather unhappy right now, to place it mildly. And I don't use PowerAmp on a daily bases, mostly only when I travel or are on vacation,  and I would have been really mad to find out about this once being abroad with no data connection (except expensive roaming) to install an alternative.\nSo just to be on the safe side, I just bought Rocket Player, no problem unlocking its paid features...\nLet's sit and wait what will be of PowerAmp in the coming days/weeks.\nJP.\n. I've also posted my point of view on their forum, I would encourage others to do the same, keep polite, but express you point of view.\nAnd sorry to hijack this 'issue on your github' to 'fight' for the rights of running an app we paid for and which stopped working, while Xprivacy is no cause of the problem. Sorry for that.\nJP.\n@paour : My kernels are still up, but only on my forum.\n. Confirmed working for me !\nThanx for the fix, JP.\n. By following the link he posted.\nJP.\n.

Thanks for any help.\nIt appeared in the last two days, and since I don't do a lot of uninstalls I am not 100% sure what change caused it.\nThe issue is that any time I go to uninstall an application from the playstore, the app DOES uninstall, but as soon as it completes the phone freezes.  I can still turn the screen off and on with the power button but nothing else appears to have any response.  I have to hold the power button to reboot to get it back.\nThe phone has been rooted with root de la vega, xposed framework installed, and xprivacy and wanam.  I ran a logcat while causing a freeze and the error seems to be related to some sort of permission problem from the line below, and under that is a larger snippet of the logcat.  Any suggestions as to how to fix this?  I would rather not factory reset and start setup all over again.\nHere is the specific error line I thing is the root of the problem:\njava.lang.SecurityException: Permission Denial: get/set setting for user asks to run as user -2 but is calling from user 0; this requires android.permission.INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS_FULL\nAnd the larger logcat:\nD/InputReader(  852): Input event: value=0 when=11856945064000\nI/InputReader(  852): Touch event's action is 0x1 (deviceType=0) [pCnt=1, s=] when=11856945065000\nI/InputDispatcher(  852): Delivering touch to: action: 0x1\nE/DatabaseUtils(  852): Writing exception to parcel\nE/DatabaseUtils(  852): java.lang.SecurityException: Permission Denial: get/set setting for user asks to run as user -2 but is calling from user 0; this requires android.permission.INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS_FULL\nE/DatabaseUtils(  852): at com.android.server.am.ActivityManagerService.handleIncomingUser(ActivityManagerService.java:13076)\nE/DatabaseUtils(  852): at android.app.ActivityManager.handleIncomingUser(ActivityManager.java:2021)\nE/DatabaseUtils(  852): at com.android.providers.settings.SettingsProvider.callFromPackage(SettingsProvider.java:577)\nE/DatabaseUtils(  852): at android.content.ContentProvider$Transport.call(ContentProvider.java:279)\nE/DatabaseUtils(  852): at android.content.ContentProviderNative.onTransact(ContentProviderNative.java:273)\nE/DatabaseUtils(  852): at android.os.Binder.execTransact(Binder.java:388)\nE/DatabaseUtils(  852): at dalvik.system.NativeStart.run(Native Method)\nW/ActivityManager(  852): Permission Denial: get/set setting for user asks to run as user -2 but is calling from user 0; this requires android.permission.INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS_FULL\nW/LicenseLogService(  852): log() is called by non admin\nD/ApplicationPolicy(  852): getApplicationUninstallationEnabled\nD/ApplicationPolicy(  852): getApplicationUninstallationEnabled :  enabled true\nI/SpenGestureManager(  852): setFocusWindow21010\nD/PointerIcon(  852): setHoveringSpenIconStyle1 pointerType: 10001iconType:1 flag:0\nD/PointerIcon(  852): setHoveringSpenCustomIcon IconType is same.1\nE/ViewRootImpl(16843): sendUserActionEvent() mView == null\nE/EnterpriseContainerManager(  852): ContainerPolicy Service is not yet ready!!!\nD/EnterpriseDeviceManager(  852): ContainerId: 0\nW/LicenseLogService(  852): log() is called by non admin\nW/PackageManager(  852): Couldn't delete native library directory /data/app-lib/com.mhill.irblasterdemo\nW/InputMethodManagerService(  852): Window already focused, ignoring focus gain of: com.android.internal.view.IInputMethodClient$Stub$Proxy@46a948e8 attribute=null, token = android.os.BinderProxy@4361f080\nE/MP-Decision( 2097): Action to bring core 1 online\nE/MP-Decision( 2097): Action to bring core 2 online\nD/PackageManager(  852): Sending to user 0: act=android.intent.action.PACKAGE_REMOVED dat=package:com.mhill.irblasterdemo flg=0x8000000 Bundle[{android.intent.extra.REMOVED_FOR_ALL_USERS=true, android.intent.extra.DATA_REMOVED=true, android.intent.extra.user_handle=0, android.intent.extra.UID=10384}]\nD/PackageManager(  852): java.lang.RuntimeException: It's not exception, just print call stack\nD/PackageManager(  852): at com.android.server.pm.PackageManagerService.sendPackageBroadcast(PackageManagerService.java:7652)\nD/PackageManager(  852): at com.android.server.pm.PackageManagerService$PackageRemovedInfo.sendBroadcast(PackageManagerService.java:11157)\nD/PackageManager(  852): at com.android.server.pm.PackageManagerService.deletePackageX(PackageManagerService.java:11108)\nD/PackageManager(  852): at com.android.server.pm.PackageManagerService.access$4000(PackageManagerService.java:218)\nD/PackageManager(  852): at com.android.server.pm.PackageManagerService$8.run(PackageManagerService.java:11013)\nD/PackageManager(  852): at android.os.Handler.handleCallback(Handler.java:730)\nD/PackageManager(  852): at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:92)\nD/PackageManager(  852): at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:137)\nD/PackageManager(  852): at android.os.HandlerThread.run(HandlerThread.java:61)\nD/dalvikvm(17949): JIT code cache reset in 0 ms (4096 bytes 2/0)\nD/dalvikvm(17949): GC_EXPLICIT freed 296K, 40% free 15538K/25484K, paused 2ms+5ms, total 41ms\nE/MP-Decision( 2097): Action to bring core 3 online\nI/SurfaceFlinger(  306): id=56 Removed BssetBrowse (4/6)\nI/SurfaceFlinger(  306): id=56 Removed BssetBrowse (-2/6)[/QUOTE]\n.

I've run into this once and not lucky enough to connect adb.\nI now have Play Service 4.0.33 with XPrivacy 1.10.18, find no problem so far.\nThe possible combination that will reproduce the problem might be 1.10.13 with Play Service 4.0.33.\nMy phone is GT-i9500 running official 4.2.2\n. Yes, it is already possible to block Apps from using this function in the drop down menu of each app.\n\n\nBut I would like to have this function in the the filter/search function to easy block more than one app.\n. I think there already is an XPosed module do the trick? Maybe you can take a look?\n. It was called Secure Samsung Clipboard by Tungstwenty, provided within the XPosed installer.\nSource: https://github.com/Tungstwenty/SecureSamsungClipboard\nSamsung simply store clipboard items inside /data/clipboard so restrict access of this folder or fake the path will achieve the goal?\n. Accidently made a mistake.\n. Good idea.\nI'll look into the possible solutions.\n. Not quite sure what you want?\nMaybe you can just remove GAPP suite which result in kissing play service and all Google services goodbye. Or you check the risky check box within the XPrivacy settings and start feeding system apps with fake data. Remember to process with caution, might result in boot loops or data damage.\n. Of course, I'll take a look.\n. @liudongmiao  I changed it from \u8bbe\u7f6e\u6a21\u62df\u4fe1\u606f to \u6a21\u62df\u8bbe\u7f6e in order to prevent string being abbreviated by system.\nBy the way, changing the \"app_description\" will somehow prevent third party markets recogonizing this app and it's history versions, I really don't recommand this.\n. I also check how it was displayed on my Galaxy i9500. Then check whether these strings/words exist in Android 4.2.2 source code and how Google guys translate them.\nThe truth is, I have these git repos maintained on one of my home servers so I can have them automatically compiled daily.\nThat means I probably don't check them as often as you do. And yes, I don't always check branches and pull requests.\nWhen I start to work on this translation, all the strings are translated using robotic translator which made this app hardly usable, and since there isn't any option to force it display English, I decided to translate the strings myself.\nIf you would like to take it from here, it's ok. I'll contact you whenever I notice something need a fix.\nIt would be even better if you can also check all these strings on a modern device(not emulator) with decent resolution, because sometimes Android system(real device) get weird and abbreviate/mess up with how strings are being displayed.\n. Sorry I forget to close the request. The one you merged earlier contained all the translation this one intended to apply.\n. @liudongmiao Nice, then from now on you translate the new strings and I do the fix. I'll attach a picture wherever I think need a fix so we can discuss.\n. Modifying UI can possibly mess up how other languages are being displayed.\n. @Jimmy34742 and @jpeg729, I know this pull is closed but I wanted to apologize as I was using the github android app. I didn't intend for them to show up in the main view but, I suppose the app's behavior differs from the website.\n. Good call, I just noticed it's universal. You can close this I suppose, must be something with OmniROM\n. Usage data: There is no attempt logged during the TextSecure registration process.\nI have no restrictions on Google Play Services.\nI cleared all restrictions for TextSecure app.\nYes I do. ... Now ... No change.\nSorry I'm not mastering the Android and I wasn't able to get any relevant info from logcat. Nothing but messages about davlikVM\n. Ok, thanks for your assistance. I went through again and it works now. Problem was in non systematic testing on my side. I made mistake with clearing restrictions. That app needed some permissions which were restricted.\n. Found it! Google+ identification restriction was the culprit. Thanks! \n. I think that I am suffering from this bug. Thats assuming that I understood the description correctly. \nPlease see this video: https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B7IMZIRnHA0_b1JqVk9aeDVKTFU/edit?pli=1\nThis happens to several apps and categories. I have experienced this bug on multiple devices:\n- Samsung Galaxy Note II, Omnirom, XPrivacy 2.0.xx. Updated from XPrivacy 1.yy.xx. I do not own the device anymore.\n- Google Nexus 10, Cyanogenmod, XPrivacy 2.0.14. Updated from XPrivacy 1.yy.xx. Stopped using XPrivacy because of this bug.\n- Google Nexus 5, Omnirom, XPrivacy 2.0.14. Updated from XPrivacy 2.00.xx. Still using XPrivacy.\n. What did you do before the video?\n- Second video: https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B7IMZIRnHA0_UEZ5M3dSTGE2YVk/edit?pli=1.\nWas this a blank, new install of XPrivacy?\n- The video is from my Nexus 5. Started from a fresh XPrivacy 2.0.xx install and gradually updated to XPrivacy 2.0.14.\nDid you import settings?\n- No.\nA logcat capture during reproduction of this bug with XPrivacy debugging enabled (main settings) may also help.\n- I'll see what I can do. \n. I just send you a logcat through your website. This time I restricted an app called cerberus in the same manner as in earlier videos. Tell me if you require a full logcat without filtering (grep XPrivacy logcat.txt).\n. Whatever else can be relevant.\n- I have never explicitly restricted the apps used as examples (App Settings, Google Authenticator, Cerberus). Or at least I'm pretty sure that I haven't. However, the bug happens to previously restricted apps as well. \n. I like to know if you collapse and expand the category if still everything isn't checked.\n- I tried a different app this time. Everything stays unchecked after collapse and expand.\nI also like to know if you close the application details view and return back if the settings are still wrong.\n- I tried a different app  this time. Everything stays unchecked after pressing back button multiple times. \nI seems that the bug occurs when a category is restricted for the first time. I checked the Identification category for App Settings app and it worked this time. Then I tried to restrict the Shell category and the bug occured again. \n. @an0n981 Do you mean like this: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7IMZIRnHA0_N3RQVkd1RmI0WFE/edit?usp=sharing\nThe bug still occurs.\n. Unfortunately it did not help.\n. I just cleared all XPrivacy data and the bug is gone. However, if I remember correctly, I have tried this before and the bug came back. I will report if it happens again.\n. Something interesting just happened. I had to factory reset my Nexus 5 from unrelated reasons. The first thing I did was to install XPosed, XPrivacy and a few other apps. Everything worked fine until I decided to install Titanium Backup and restored a few of the missing apps. As a result the bug started occuring again. Then I cleared all XPrivacy data and everything was OK again. I thought that this was a bit odd, so I decided to restore all the missing apps I could. And, as you can probably guess, the bug started occuring again. Clearing all XPrivacy data was once again the appropriate fix for the problem.\nA some type of mismatch between Xprivacy and Titanium Backup could explain the problems I have been experiencing. However, I used Titanium Backup only a few times before this factory reset to restore apps. Maybe a single restore operation is enough to to mess up things...\n. Ok. Maybe you could make the category check box more clear. For example:\n[red check mark] = Category fully restricted including all \"dangerous functions\"\n[blue check mark] = Category fully restricted, no \"dangerous functions\" in the category\n[red square] = Category partially restricted including some \"dangerous functions\"\n[blue square] = Category fully restricted excluding \"dangerous functions\" \n[gray? square] = Category partially restricted excluding \"dangerous functions\" \n. In addition, disabling the on demand restriction functionality from the application details window should probably restore the application details window into the normal operation mode. Maybe it should even reset everything so that the user does not get confused as I did.\n. Some texts may be wrong.I try to correct them.\n. Good.The translations can be merged.\n. Hi,\nUpdated my HTC One to 5.0 today, and saw Xposed framwork & Xprivacy not working. Damn. I found your repository and an updated binary, installed it along XPosed 2.7 experimental (without reading the note, ofc >_>)\nAfter my phone's reboot, XPrivacy was still not working. Damn again. I saw the note, extracted the boot_signed.img from HTC RUU (using the AndroidImageKitchen tool), patched the kernel, installed it on my device. Stuck on boot. Took a logcat of the freeze (seems to be a crash, not sure if related but don't know what caused it?)\nI hard rebooted my phone in recovery (i installed TWRP before anything else), deleted everything related to XPrivacy (data and binary), rebooted and my phone started again (with the modded kernel.)\nlogcat of the phone stuck available here: http://pastebin.com/ZvmNzW0W\n.

Stock firmware, just rooted. \nWhen starting it 2013-11-14 (maybe the 15th) I got the symtoms described by paour above. Managed to install a clockworkmod backup dated 2013-10-31. It booted in a normal way and still does after all the updates initiated by this outdated version of all apps. The difference is that I KEPT VERSION 1.10 of Xprivacy. Now running Google Play services version 4.0.33 and SuperSU version 1.69.\nDon't know if it is connected but before installing the backup avast!Mobile Security behaved in an erratic way.

    "VorpalBlade": "Here is the logcat: http://sprunge.us/FjHZ\nIt simply freezes forever after the last line. The screen stays forever on the Pacman boot logo.\n. Here is a new logcat (with debug logging enabled in xprivacy settings): http://sprunge.us/DbUT\nIt doesn't end in the same line any more it seems. But it does get stuck.\nI uninstalled and reinstalled xprivacy since the last time (since I had to get the phone working in beteween and Google Play Services keeps auto-updating itself in the most obnoxious way). Thus the configured restrictions applied at the last log are now gone.\n. What do you mean with \"Did you use the toggler to install XPrivacy?\"?\nHere is the log without Greenify: http://sprunge.us/NLiM\nIt still gets stuck, just as before.\n. Here is a new log with the new version after leaving it for a while: http://sprunge.us/FhMH\n. What then is the next step of debugging? Comparative analysis between working and non-working?\n. The play services versions should be 4.0.33 and 4.0.31 (where the .33 is broken) There is no 3.0.33, that is a typo.\n. By the way, it appears I have to restore \"App+data\" when downgrading Google Play Services to make it work. Restoring app only does not help. Strange.\n. I do not have Android usage data enabled, I don't even know what it does.\nAn interesting note is that when I downgrade Google Play Services and reboot, Google Search keeps crashing every minute or so (even though I haven't opened it, so it is stealth-running in the background). Also I had to go to airplane mode to be able to even reboot after the Play Services downgrade, since otherwise it would auto-upgrade within seconds.\n. After I disabled Google Search due to the crashes after downgrading, it does not seem to want to auto-update to the new Play Services again (even after re-enabling Google Search), and I do not have a backup of the new version of Play Services. As soon as it decides to auto-update again I will try those versions.\n. Not in any of the logs no. I did use it when downgrading Play Services though. Speaking of which, it has still not decided to auto-update again. Really strange. Do you know if there is any way to force upgrade it? As far as I know it is not in the Play Store?\n. I will, but I'm still trying to get Play Services to re-updated. Play Services just updated on my Nexus 10, so clearly the update hasn't been revoked. I could give it a try on the Nexus 10 too, to see if it causes issues there, but it is running stock 4.3.\n. It does not appear to work. At first I thought it did, since during the display of the Pacman logo during boot the screen dims at one point a bit (probably applying the settings?). Previously during the crash it did not do that. Now however it does that. But it still gets stuck. Here is a log: http://sprunge.us/gXGB\n(Ignore the \"Dropped event because input dispatch is disabled.\" at the end, that was me on the touchscreen.)\n. Sure, it will take a while due to having to boot to safe mode and so on.\n. \"No extra usage data (all)\". Does not work. I forgot to turn on xprivacy debugging before rebooting though, so I suspect you have little use of that log file. I'll go ahead and try the other one momentarily (with debug this time). I can try the \"all\" version again with debug if you want me to.\n. Okay this is really strange. The Android version in itself does not help. But thinking about the issue with Google Search previously I went ahead and froze search in TiBackup, just in case. Then I rebooted (still using the \"(android)\" version). No issue. So it seems it is connected to Play Services + Search installed? If it matters I do not have \"Google Now\" activated. I'm a bit too paranoid for that.\n. Tried \"My best guess is that this version will solve the problem\" with Play services .33 and Google Search disabled. Still works.\n. Since I don't really use the Google search app (I tend to search from inside the browser instead) this is a usable workaround for me until we can figure out the issue. Also I probably won't be able to debug more until tomorrow evening (European time).\n. Well I can't test it. The new version isn't even showing up in the download section of the Xposed installer for me currently.\n. Could it not be a bug in Xposed Framework causing this hooking to fail? Surely there is no way for an application for detect that it is being hooked? Or if there is, couldn't you hook that code to prevent it from discovering that?\n. Ah, so you would need to hook native code? I guess that makes sense, speaking of which I seem to remember reading that Cydia for Android could do that. In theory I guess that would allow you to better restrict applications? Now they can just bypass, say, the /proc restrictions if you allowed them to load a native library, right? Have you considered doing anything with Cydia?\nAlso: Any suggestions for music players with similar feature set to PowerAmp?\n. ",

Depending on the app, some if not all internet permission are not reported.\nfor example Whatsapp and TrackID do not report some internet permission as being used/needed/blocked/allowed and thus allowing everything in internet category is needed or selectively trying all combinations. for these permissions a app or phone restart is also needed.\ni like the idea to know which permissions don't show up by adding something or changing color\n. I like the idea! i always did this with imaginary selections in my head trying to remember everything...fail...\n+1 for the bars (with breathing space on top and bottom)\nadditional suggestion: please use color blind friendly color combinations  (in case it is not)\n@ everyone with any kind of colorblindness, let us know about the colors :)\n. How about a personal indication, a small indicator (a small square on the color bar for example) to let the user know if the restrictions are experimental or not. Think about this as a checkbox that has no real function other then reminding the user that some applied app restrictions are experimental. Maybe because you are testing restrictions. Or can we assume all apps to be experimental unless it's submitted and thus green colored. And what about permission/restriction changes after submitting? will they keep the same color or change back to gray?\n. Ok it works :)\nThe bars look nice\nNew apps get orange color\nThe orange color changes to gray after any changes including reapplying template after clearing.\nThe green color changes back to gray after changing restriction after submitting (after restart XPrivacy)\nAbout the colors i can't say much i think after a public release we will hear feedback, for now the green color looks red to me, but thats no problem since i can clearly distinguish between the orange color.\n. I found a glitch which i cannot reproduce.\nAfter opening XPrivacy the filter tab had green color instead of no bar or gay bar. After selecting the filter tab it was gone.\n. I would not go with marking such submitions as if accounts were not restricted. because then all accounts will be unprotected after fetching. i think it's better to have them at default restricted and if necessary manually allowed.\nmaybe adding a popup after fetch for these kind of restrictions in which you tel them to allow specific accounts yourself. to know which sumbits have allowed account a true or false code could be exported inside backup to at least know that one or more accounts are supposed to be allowed. \n. I would expect the psychical back button to at least cancel/discard changes. If Android doesn't do this than i think they are making a mistake ;)\n. Data leaks will also happen when these permissions are allowed permanently when people find it irritating to allow every time and thus allow permanently if needed for functionality. Changing the \"allow once 'x' seconds\" duration changes the default 30 seconds into the desired one, but that is not limited to the app in question, it changes also the default 30 seconds for the next/other popups/apps. Meaning that every time when not using the app in question the new x seconds needs to be changed back to 30 or whatever low value someone might prefer as default. This constantly changing the x seconds might be the cause for some people not making use of this functionality often (like me). \nI don't know how many people actually use or not use this functionality often. Just changing the behaviour of the x seconds on the next popup to the default one might already improve the usage. But if possible and if you, Marcel want to then i don't object for having the allow when visible function which of course is much better ;) \nA few apps (examples) where this will be useful are: \nTrackID (ALSO asking for Audio.startRecording when leaving/closing the app), \nShazam (same as TrackID, might actually record all to also recognise tv programs in background)\n\"automatically identify songs, TV shows, and advertisements without having to reach for their phones\" (2013)\nNavigation apps. RouteRadar or Speed Cameras by Sygic keep listening to location in background.\n. I think you have misunderstood what i said. I agree that it can cause data leaks when allowing apps in the background. I was talking about an options (not forcing) for allowing apps that are 'visible', not in the background but visible on the screen. And before that i was talking about how 'others' might have there data invaded just because they get irritated by the current way it works and decide to allow permissions permanently.\n. There is/was a point in allowing when using, but according to what you said it won't work like intended since apps can force itself to the foreground and thus leak data. Good that you mentioned that. I almost thought you were saying something like \"if you care about your privacy don't use android at all\" ;)\n. yeah i agree on that it might be useful this way but not sure anymore, i can't quickly come up with an example in which black/white listing without restricting first would have an advantage over restricting before black/white listing. It would only give me the impression that the default action would be allow, after the time expires.\nThat could also cause confusion when a user un-checks all functions and on-demand, but things are still restricted. The user should actually know by the icon for white listing though. so not sure if this is a good reason to not allow this behaviour. \nFor me it's not a problem anyway i always restrict and whitelist\n. > But there is also another scenario where blacklisting is useful. Suppose I were using Chrome with libraries restricted on demand. When I first started Chrome, it needed to load some library to function at all, so I whitelisted that library. Then browsing worked without further prompts. Then later I went to a certain strange web page and Chrome suddenly asked to load some library. It seemed potentially unwanted, so I blacklisted that library for Chrome. The nest time a page wants Chrome to load that library, it is automatically forbidden, so it won't bother my any more. If, in the future, Chrome wants to do something else that requires a new library and that I actually want to do, then I will be prompted and I can whitelist that new library. So it makes sense to work with on-demand and blacklists together. I actually never use blacklisting unless combined with on-demand.\n\n\nCerberus-tm\n\n\nThis is exactly how I use it with different apps. \nIt looks like the black/white list option works as an individual function that is not directly connected to the first checkbox. Maybe this is how it should stay, the (w) icon for white listing should be a good indicator already imoh maybe make it glow/highlight for more attention if necessary. Or even a four state check box.\n@an0n981 for me it did prevent opening.\n@Gitoffthelawn The square check mark has already a purpose. Won't using this for another purpose make it worse?\nI might not get certain things mentioned, there where so many reactions. Correct me if i think wrong.\n. +1 \ni definitly like the toasts but not being able to click while they are up (or cover something up) makes it not all ways desired. For some apps it not a big deal. I am happy there are toast, better than not having them i guess from how helpfull they are. Or is it that i'm just used to it but would still know why if there were no toast ;)\nIf ever implemented my suggestion would be settings per app.\n. Thanks good to know! even though i'm not going to use it any time soon\n. @Gitoffthelawn I don't remember getting toasts for get clipboard permissions, but can i ask you a question about the clipboard permissions on XDA? pm me on XDA if you like. I don't know your user name and don't want to go off topic here.\n. This doesn't seem safe to me. This way it is not possible to prevent a newly created contact to be protected before it gets accessed. Or do you mean something else? EDIT: oeps bump\n. For me it does work. I'm on: \nKitKat 4.4.2 - Stock Samsung (cleaned)\nXposed 2.6.1\nXPrivacy 3.6.19 (481)\nSimple Explorer 2.3.1 (xda apk version, used only to test, since I do not use Simple Explorer myself). @T-vK I already did that.\n@Toufukun Yeah maybe. I just wanted to let know that on my software it works, to narrow down the cause of the problem. but if its already sure that its only marshmallow and above then nvm ; ). ",

There won't be anyone be able to get 3.6.8 working, because the Xposed segmentation fault occurs when accessing memory incorrectly, from what I see.\n. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18158694/android-fatal-signal-error-11-sigsegv-on-different-versions-of-jellybean\n. Can you tell me what I should do to find the source of the error? NDK... or something is needed if I remember correctly\n. All I know is the daemon (gcdaemon) from libart (art library) is not allowing the modified system_server (in the android root/system)  to access the memory thus causing segmentation fault, I may be mistaken\nFor this someone needs a lot of experience ...\n. Would 3.6.8 work on 4.4.4 xposed with ART runtime? \nLowering sdkversion to 19 (4.4.2) with eclipse then compiling will make it (xposed) work, right?\n. Thank you for your response.\nI also tried Xprivacy 3.6.8 on Xposed alpha 2, and instead of CM12 where the system cannot complete the boot, this time the system completes the boot but just kills Xposed.\nlogcat\nhttp://tny.cz/132420d8\n. http://bit.ly/1CV5AXG 5.1 bootloop\nonly sigsegv is missing but error looks the same~\n. because it was old... OK, I will do my best to make this project support android studio, and if I may succeed, will do a pull request\n. 3.6.10 causes bootloop on 4.3 \n```\nE/DisplayManager( 7162):

As you can see, I'm not an expert. I made a mistake by saying dash instead of hyphen. I suggested using Filipino words because Taglish is discouraged by experts on Tagalog and English (http://tl.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taglish). I believe you had good intentions using it. However, what I noticed when reading Taglish/loanword is that sometimes I really don't know what the English word means that reading the Taglish/loanword doesn't help understand it. I study in a public college and many people there aren't that well-versed in English.

It didn't appear in the Data Usage log that Waze attempted to access Storage and System as seen here: \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/o8eziltu9j3klw5/Screenshots_2013-12-31-07-07-07.png\nXPrivacy failed to notify me, via the orange icon, that the app accessed System (https://www.dropbox.com/s/tp04hbi1af5z45k/Screenshots_2013-12-31-07-07-26.png), though, for Storage, it looks like this: (https://www.dropbox.com/s/clg43zriggk019x/Screenshots_2013-12-31-07-27-03.png). Other apps in XPrivacy show a usage icon beside the category when an app accesses the storage but now I have to dig it. Am I missing something here?\n. In my opinion, category/function filter will also be helpful. This can determine which apps are missing specific restrictions.\n. Oh yeah. I tried it a while ago to see how \"Prompt\" on demand restriction was designed because I wanna vote for it too (issue 1291). I disabled it thinking it wouldn't interfere. Issue solved.\n. Not only functions with parameter but also those functions alone. Internet:socket, for one, prompts right after allowing the entire Internet category once every 15 seconds.\n. Is it possible to remind the user, when disabling on-demand, that the user has [?] and ask if the user if he would like to review/change it?\n. So it's an Android problem? I rebooted after leaving this message, then, after an hour or so, I installed Shou recorder. Same thing happened.\n. For your reference:\nHere is the logcat before and after installing NZB Unity and Remote Prompter. Both weren't restricted: \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/aios1k1n1dwbm4s/logcat.txt\nXPrivacy screenshot:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/o5yyzikuu7gyt9d/Screenshots_2014-03-02-20-50-50.png\n. SM-N9005 stock. It didn't happen until just recently (at the height of massive features being added). \n. Usage data of Xprivacy:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/sru4ffe2y5m2oas/Screenshots_2014-03-02-22-56-37.png\nSystem restrictions:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/d27j0cf79jynn35/XPrivacy_1.99.63_20140302_225823_hlte.xml\nFrozen system apps:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/ll5k5il9vbqhcgy/FrozenSystemApps.txt\nPerhaps you can find something useful here that might be the root cause - something that mistakenly restricted or froze.\n. My speculation is that some system apps that \"require\" Timezone access were restricted by those users. But hey, I'm not a dev. So I won't know for sure. I am the boot loop queen and didn't encounter any problem with the 2.0 update on stock SM-N9005. Talk about being lucky >:)  Tell me, wouldn't spoofing latitude, longitude, and country be unuseful because my network-provided timezone reveals which specific country I am in? If Timezone is a privacy concern, maybe experimental builds to circumvent the boot issue (if there are other ways to implement it) should be provided, (while checking their current system app restrictions and if they accidentally Greenified anything [that was the answer to my previous Xprivacy problem and the first ever boot loop hell I experienced concerning Google Services and Framework]) to those users willing to risk their phone for another possible boot issue. If it is not, forget what I said ;-)\n. I was suggesting a \"better way\", for me, to view/add/remove whatever that has been added in the blacklist/whitelist. It's just like the usage list. It's better to see them in one window than having to go through each app checking which function has been accessed by a restricted app. Anyway, you know better than I do. I'm just hoping it will be considered someday.\n. ",

We recorded power measurements, while transmitting packets over cellular, using two different smartphone models (Nexus 4 and Nexus 5) during the same ride, and Table 3 indicates that for Nexus 4 \u21161 the combined route estimates were able to identify the \ufb01nal road segment for 80% of scenarios. For Nexus 4 \u21162 which run many applications the \ufb01nal destination estimates are somewhat less accurate (72%). This is attributed to the more noisy measurements of the aggregate power consumption. The accuracy for the two models \u2013 Nexus 5 and HTC Desire \u2013 are lower than the accuracy achieved for Nexus 4. Remember that all our pre-recordings were done using a Nexus 4.we aligned the power samples, according to absolute time.\n\n\n\nShow me an app\n\nContact the article authors for that.\n. > \"To locate the phone, we assume the attacker has prior knowledge of the area or routes through which the victim is traveling.\"\nThis means that the area is known so they can drive it with their equipment (or equipment of users of controlled apps) and measure power consumption on routes of that arrea.\nFor example, there is a gps navigation program. I don't know how it is in your country, but in my the most popular navigator collects a huge bunch of information for purposes of detecting traffic jams (which is the reason why it is so popular). Also they are highly collobarated with the government, because the government gave them exclusive access to their telemetry of public transport and traffic in general. So that company has ability to create such a database. They know the area and they can measure power consumption of a large bunch of phones on that area.\n. > They would have to map all possible routes around the city\nNo. They only need all combinations of 2 sequential pieces of routes.\n\nIf you have applications running on your phone that use the battery, it all falls apart. Etc.\n\nThey state that using machine learning they have managed to solve this problem.\n\nAnd giving him orders(!) is in my opinion inappropriate.\n\nSorry, i didn't mind to give him an order but an advice.\n. Also it can be good not to spoof accuracy, but reduce it adding some value to real location got from gps chip. Also I am a bit surprised that \"rough location\" is acquired in most cases using cells db, but not using gps and artifically reducing its accuracy.\n. Probably list of packages was retrieved in the following way\njava\nprivate List<String> getApps() {\n    PackageManager pm;\n    List<String> apps = new ArrayList<String>();\n    List queryIntentActivities = pm.queryIntentActivities(new Intent(\"android.intent.action.MAIN\", (Uri)null), 0);\n    Iterator<ResolveInfo> it = queryIntentActivities.iterator();\n    while (it.hasNext()) {\n        String packageName = it.next().activityInfo.packageName;//according the docs there is no such a field in ActivityInfo\n        /*\n        invokeinterface java/util/Iterator.next:()Ljava/lang/Object;\n        checkcast       Landroid/content/pm/ResolveInfo;\n        getfield        android/content/pm/ResolveInfo.activityInfo:Landroid/content/pm/ActivityInfo;\n        getfield        android/content/pm/ActivityInfo.packageName:Ljava/lang/String;\n        */\n        if (!apps.contains(packageName)) {\n            apps.add(packageName);\n        }\n    }\n    return apps;\n}\nSorry for the delay, had no time to analyse the app until now.\n. Such restriction already exists, but restricting it can create troubles with app operation. I think that there should be a way to mask identifiers. You can make masking based on crypto, but I think it is overkill here (it won't be an overkill if you have a lot of values to mask, if you decided to to use crypto, use authenticated encryption scheme). So\n1 for each package generate a random id\n2 use associative container mapping generated id and real package id to each others\n3 if app is restricted to get package ids but allowed to call queryIntentActivities, give it masked ids and unmask them in other APIs.\n. > This is too complicated (too slow and will give maintenance headaches).\nWhy? I don't think that mapping masked id to id and back is slower than hooked call itself.\n. When everything is restricted, the following info is stil leaking:\n1 device model\n2 info about platform (both software and hardware)\n3 info about performance profiles including governor name\n4 info about screen and gpu\n5 battery capacity\nAll of theese allows to fingerprint OS carefully to choose the exploits correctly.\n6 info about current language (allows to determine nationality of owner)\n7 access to momental states of cores allows to distinguish between types of activity on the device (at least wheither user is doing something like typing text in primitive editor or using resource-eating app like game, but It can be probably possible using machine learning derive the app the user is using in the moment).\n8 wlan signal strength (allows tracking via sending uniq id of the app installation and signal strength to external server and identifiying the router by ip address and fingerprint of software running on it)\nWhen I allow Camera.Permission, it gets info about camera modules, which also allows to distinguish between devices. I think that the app not allowed to use features of the sensor should know nothing about them.\n. @an0n981, see #2176\n. Thank you for explanations.\n\nRestrictions can be used for game cheating for example.\n\nXposed framework can also be used for this, more it is already used to hide presence of root access from differrent applications of overparanoidal developers like NXP was, and this seems to be ok, I have not heard about any legal action or crime against rootcloak author.\n\nthis can be circumvented by native code\n\nIs it possible to use LXC to fix it?\n.

    "vi": "To sum up: imagine 30% of android users running XPrivacy and [adware/spyware] app developers want to break privacy anyway, analyze XPrivacy in detail, try to find exploits, etc. Will XPrivacy be effective in this case? Or it is effective only as nobody yet specifically targets XPrivacy-enabled devices?\nIt is well known that you cannot do security on the same level as risks are running and need to go deeper (i.e. rest in more secure zone, be the first to be loaded, etc). But XPrivacy have advantage over applications it manages that it can be sole user app with root access. So it can apply various Linux measures like using seccomp, ptrace, or even securely stealing the access to /dev/binder and proxying it to the application.\n. Alternative simpler way: actually revoke Android permissions for XPrivacy-managed app, but use that API injection to provide stubs (like empty contact book) for app to be happy.\n. Actually I'm not a real expert on the subject (Android), I more think in Linux terms (with Android as just a layer on top on Linux). I came around XPrivacy before, read about it a bit, saw that it works by hooking into Java API combined with phrase XPrivacy doesn't revoke (i.e. block) permissions from an application and went away thinking it's a snako oil security. Hovewer recently I saw another android privacy thread and found XPrivacy again, so decieded to actually ask the question.\nAbout your alternative simpler way: this is what XPrivacy does ... -> In this case it should probably be OK (means \"secure\") even if applications does not use Java API as I expect Android to enfore permissions on Binder (or whatever) layer as well. But what about the phrase about XPrivacy doesn't revoke? If it's a usual deny_acess_to_real+give_access_to_managed scheme it should be documented. Such scheme can be secure if done properly.\nNote: we can continue discussion in, for example, StackExchange chat: http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/43283/a-chat-about-xprivacy\n. Yes, it is a problem: http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/211928/how-to-invite-somebody-from-internet-into-my-newly-created-chat-room ... I expect you at least see my messages. StackExchange chat is convenient for long, edited and formatted messages.\nYou can also use Freenode #xprivacy .\n. Even if the upper (simpler) version will not have any buttons like \"allow\" or \"reject\", simply providing a log (audit) of allowed or rejected can be useful as well.\n. After a bit of hacking built XPrivacy v3.6.19 using modified supplied gradle file tools/build.gradle:\n```\nbuildscript {\n    repositories {\n        mavenCentral()\n    }\ndependencies {\n    // classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:0.12+'\n    classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:1.3.0'\n}\n\n}\napply plugin: 'com.android.application'\ndependencies {\n    compile files('libs/android-support-v13.jar')\n    compile files('substrate-api.jar')\n    provided files('XposedBridgeApi-20150213.jar')\n    compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:23.0.0';\n    compile 'com.android.support:cardview-v7:23.0.0';\n}\nandroid {\n    compileSdkVersion 23\n    buildToolsVersion \"23.0.2\"\nuseLibrary  'org.apache.http.legacy'\n\nsourceSets {\n    main {\n        manifest.srcFile 'AndroidManifest.xml'\n        java.srcDirs = ['src']\n        resources.srcDirs = ['src']\n        aidl.srcDirs = ['src']\n        renderscript.srcDirs = ['src']\n        res.srcDirs = ['res']\n        assets.srcDirs = ['assets']\n    }\n}\n\n}\n```\n.

Problem solved, no more force close.\n. I have test this version, still scroll lag and the icon of applications have more lag. \n. I tested this version and Elixir2 see a fake location! but not AndroiTS GPS Test, for him in the logcat iI don't see any error, only this:\n2014-01-14 19:01:51.896 W/XPrivacy/XLocationManagerService: Remove: listener not found\nI will send the logcat and XP log at your contact.\n. As it was fixed, when I utilised return button of the XPrivacy, I had flickering with my home screen.\nSo I prefer it stay like that!\n. I think it maybe confusing, because only one application is updated. It is better and more simple change to the alphabetical order for the package name, like that this fix the problem. This also make not use sort application name respecting locale language, and displays the name of the application for the shared uid uniform for all language    \n. Just for info, when I was Google Play Services in the user list with other shared app's, it was ranked first position and it had correct update notification.\n. Why my screenshots does not appears?\n. Thanks now it works.\n. Here the output:\nnet.hostname]: [android-f4..........\nnet.usb0.isharing.host2]:  [all\nro.build.host]: [abm016\nro.usb_host]: [1\n. Yes I have shell restricted for Logging Test here I have null value for build.prop, and exec restricted for Elixir2 and Cid Getter they have empty screen. Is not possible restrict access to build.prop without shell or exec? because I had force close with Logging Test and other app's when I restrict shell. I don't know how the build.prop restriction work under Identification, when I restrict /system/build.prop other ro. item with % works as exception? Why I don't have the usage data for %hostname, %imei, %macaddr and system/build.prop I found only usage data for  %serialno with two app's Android Id and BetterBatteryStats they don't use shell or exec \n. So what happens ex. with /system/build.prop unrestricted and all or someone the % function restricted?\nI think about that logic, for exemple when I want unrestricted only ro.imei and restrict entire build.prop I check /system/build.prop and the other % function except %imei and contrary I want restrict all or someone % function and not entire build.prop  It is possible to do?\nPS.Thanks for reopen the issue!     \n. What you think? about add a advice toast like for reboot app for that's and other dependencies, when we restrict /system/build.prop we have a toast: sometimes to restrict access to build.prop sh or exec must be checked.\nAnother dependencies it is /proc, I found that it like %cid have the same usage time access in the usage log\nI became interested in this question and it seems an app writing to your SD Card will have the system create a file under /proc I am not sure it's necessary unrestricted /proc for writing to SD!   \nCan you see for the Error in the logcat? Logging Test has a force close when I tape Get Hostname with sh checked.\n. Thanks for the explanation! So no risk to restrict /proc for the app's which writing to SD card.\n. I have the similar problem except for me it's contrary, per applications settings stays deface. I go into app and tape ok button for fix the problem. Can you try first randomize global setting and go into app? \n. Personally I propose randomized as MCC 001 MNC 01 + 10 random digits, I confirm that format on all device.\nhttp://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mobile_Subscriber_Identity\nsee content 3.2 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscriber_Identity_Module\n. Information>tape Telephony>More information>tape the right arrow>Under Extra info you will found the APN.\n. Really I don't know why it see the usage data for the build.prop you have the same result with Elixir?\n. Even if I access directly to this screen in the Elixir2 I has the usage data for build.prop surely it's\na coincidence. Restriction works perfectly we have the fake data! \n. That's explains these change between the versions. It's clear now closed topic! Thanks jpeg729\n. I confirm the same problem.\n. Yes I suspected that, G.Translator doesn't help me :) One for each contacts category.\nBy allowed three contacts I mean: Menu>Select contacts to allow and In the list of the contacts\nI allowed one sim contact, one phone contact, one email contact. \nI did not know if usage data have direct rapport with unchecked allowed contacts, I wanted to show the differences. Sorry for the confusion. \n. This is happened again on upgrade from ver.1.99.40 to 42 I allowed this time six contacts in Select contacts to allow list (two sim contacts, two phone contacts and two email contacts) before upgrade for Easy Contacts Delete on upgrade two allowed sim contacts was unchecked.\nWhat happens! I hope have you to believe my word, so I wanted test contacts restriction with Copilot application as I had no contacts with an address I will go into my stock contacts app to add an address for one contact then I go to XP for allow this contact what I see it's already checked in the Select contacts to allow list!   \n. I wanted to add what happened long time ago on the another device Sony Xperia SP the account in the Select account to allow list was pre-checked for few app and strange only Google account.\nSorry for this a late report but after what is happened now I'm certain at 100%\n. 1)By functions I mean what happened on upgrade from 1.99.29 to 1.99.30 (see the post on xda) I have the same template (category+function) for all my applications except for few app's, ex. for storage I have getExternaleStorageState sdcard checked and media unchecked etc. this is why I'm certain at 100% this is happened with these functions.\n2)By account I mean what happened on the Xperia SP the account allowed (not by me) for few app\nthis is sure because for these app's I didn't wanted allow an account.\n3)About contacts I mean what happened several time on upgrade the allowed sim contact was unchecked and after adding an address (in the stock app) to the one contact these contact was already checked I remarked this when I wanted allow this contact in XP.\nI know to will not be easy to found what the problem I think most likely to see what happened is look at ver. 1.99.29 to 1.99.30 (the biggest problem) and for these ver. 1.99.39, 99.39-2, 99.40, 99.42 I had with these ver. the problem with unchecked allowed sim contacts, it's repetitive issue. And this happens only on upgrade. Maybe you can write a post on xda thread to see if someone had similar cases! \n. But it's true, what I'm supposed to do to help you!\nI know you have write several time in xda forum that XP doesn't touch the functions itself, this maybe on response for someone who had this problem I'v already remarked this behaviour on the debut (I use XP since ver.0.34 but when you was very categorical I do not dare to say otherwise and I was not much of elements. I also remarked another things when I had the Pro Enabler, when I checked its functions these functions was unchecked itself after 15-20 sec. but for this I think it's a anti piracy measure no?  \n. Happened again on upgrade from ver.1.99.42 to 43 this time In the XP I allowed 7 contacts for Easy Contact Delete again 4 sim contacts was unchecked the other are untouched.\nBefore upgrade.\n\nAfter upgrade.\n\n. Happened again from ver. 1.99.43 to 44\n. Just to know it happens also after reboot.\n. I did not know that it's the same issue.\n. I have captured this logcat with Elixir2 it's not the same like Catlog ;) I hope it's not a little too long you can read the logcat but from bottom to top and application crash at line 1862 \nhttp://pastebin.com/Rn6wDWqT   \n. It's difficult to see/found quickly (with many entry in usage log) the name of category/functions when them is not displayed on the same line as the time icon etc. I edited the screenshot. \n. For the item with several lines exemple in the Elixir2 screenshot you can see this in first entries from the bottom:\n10:27:30 Elixir2 10178 elixir.KEEP/iconpack/Default -\nI think about wind/pull up time icon etc like this: \n10:27:30 Elixir2 10178 storage/open etc for the other item. Like for the item with one line they are on the same line by default because one line I would the same for the multiline item.\n. Sorry for the later report but I didn't know this possibility before I discovered only now.\nI think it's just a reminder to reboot the device. Maybe you can change for \"tape to reboot device\"\nLittle difference I update XPrivacy manually so without open it.\nAfter update from version .61 to 63 when opened notification and taped OK in pop-up\nInstead of reboot it shows this screen \"Reboot required\":\n\nSecond update from version .63 to .68 opened notification and taped OK in pop-up\nthe device reboot works but I see in the background the above screen I suppose...\nnext update to be sure I will tape cancel to see the entire screen because pop-up hide one part.   \n. Updated from .68 to .70 I taped this time cancel in pop-up to see the entire screen\n\"Reboot required\"\n\nI doesn't have the logcat I don't know if it's safe to capture the logcat with an app and not with ADB\nUsually I reboot my device as early after update. \n. Thanks! Exactly I have global on demand settings disabled I prefer \"old school\" method ;)\n. @an0n981 I think embrace the future soon It rejuvenates me! What interests me the largest number\nit's white-lists future.\n@M66B Unfortunately bootloop with this version quietly :) I restore my Nandroid backup.\n. Tried again bootloop I will send a logcat at your contact (privacy stuff)\n. Really bad luck now when stable version coming I have this problem never had bootloop since version 0.34, have latest version .72 when open issues.\n-Clear restrictions update from ver.72 to 72-5 or 2.0 bootloop\n-Return to version .71 update to .72 no bootloop\nData partition has 68% free space I checked dmesg not error here because I had long time ago bad block in data partition which going after nandroid restore.\nThis is the error I've had in data partition:\nEXT4-fs error (device mmcblk0p35): ext4_ext_check_inode:350: inode #876: comm installd: bad header/extent: invalid extent entries - magic f30a, entries 1, max 4(4), depth 0(0)\nI rechecked again dmesg not trace of this error or something other.\nWhat I do to found what the problem?\n. Wait I'm wrong? like I said never had the bootloop I think when we stuck on boot screen logo (like in this issue #1543) is a bootloop. Sorry for the confusion I go to install version 2.0.1 which surely fix the issue.\n. Ouf! the ver. 2.0.1 works! Happy end and happy user :) I would like to know regardless what happened?\nKnow you a good method to check the partition like checkdisk on PC? \n. Ah ok I assure you that traverse my mind! so next step I will test the on demand whitelists.\nwhat I like almost with usage data with parameters it makes us understand many things\nand how Android works. Good continuation! \n. @Lasermole I have tested BubbleUPnP License works for me have you allowed your google account in detailed app view Menu>Select account to allow. Check your restriction first like M66B say check also in BubbleUPnP Menu>Settings if Buy license is greyed also try reinstall your licence app or better both app's. Just to know BubbleUPnP and License have the same uid.   \n. Sorry I will add now. \nI precise this happens with disabled on-demand settings and also I recalled that it happened before this future was added.\nView: Applications details\nCategory: Storage\nSteps:\n-1 go into app detailed view\ndrill down arrow for storage category\nrestrict the whole category\nunchecked an function.\n-2 return back to app detail view\nunrestricted the whole category\n-3 return back to app detail view\nrestrict the whole category\nthe function which I have unchecked at point 1 is not checked.\nAlso I precise that I have not touched these settings a certain time between each change and have done many Xprivacy update.\n. it does not matter much it's just a minor inconvenience. I will reinstall soon my rom from scratch\nsince 9 months of continuous XPrivacy update I think it will settle certain behaviour.\n. Let me explain better the function \"getExternalStorageState\" justly worked for Adobe Reader with version 2.0.4 and earlier but I never had faked the external storage (because open pdf) even never had the usage data when I have remarked that function not had usage data I have only checked if the restrictions works. Also Adobe Reader read/open the pdf file from sdcard should have the usage data for open no?\nSystem Panel has similar behaviour its function is only read the state of the external storage not access sdcard also should have the usage data with always unrestricted \"gerExternalStorageState\" no?\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nextapp.systempanel\n. I know it's not a library but maybe it use shell/start>mount it's possible?\nEdit: also it use a library shell/load>libAdobeReader.so \n2.0.7 is the first version for which Adobe Reader has the usage data for \"getExterernalStorage\"\nand it use this function because I can restrict access to pdf from external storage the same happens for this function with System Panel. \n. Another +1 \nIt still lacks four +1 Wake up the guys ;) \n. Yes they works without restricting Play Services precisely com.google.android.location (I can see this with Titanium Backup latest usage data function) (you think about this one but it's standard no? you ROM has it?) which is under shared UID\n Restrict Play Services to have a fake location restrict this two functions: getCellLocation and getNeighboringCellInfo reboot the device all apps Elixir2 (GPS Ok), Network Info II, Soundhound, CoPilot (GPS Ok), RATP don't have network but only GPS location it's strange that work perfect for a fake GPS location also for Maps\nFor Maps or Play Service restricting get...Providers don't provide a fake network or GPS location but Offline status.\nWow XPrivacy 3 It's sound great! I understand you I hope see you working at this project as long as possible. XPrivacy it's already a masterpiece!\n. Thanks for these additional info I understand better now.\n. I think you will still get at least to version 2.99 ;) Good continuation Marcel!\n. Perfect! the problem is solved. Thanks\n. @dec0de I had the same error \"Connection to server lost, touch to retry\"\nFirst I thought it not works because I restricted www.googleadservices.com so I allowed it but the error was still there by cons the ads before the video are income. I have found why it happens simply XPrivacy fails to show all on-demand dialogues (so much different address IP, 8 in the same seconds see the screen-shot) even when I allowed the restrictions for all visible dialogues someone are bypassed which I have discovered in usage log as restricted. For now I must relaunch certain app's (mostly from Google because they have many range of address IP) to add to white-list the restricted address. So now Youtube works perfectly even with ads server blocked.\nHere I think it should be great if Marcel give us the possibility whit-listing with long press in usage data not only the entire parameters but also with wild-cards the same that are in on-demand dialogues in this way when an address is restricted because on-demand dialogue is bypassed we don't have to relaunch the app's for whitelisting others in this case range of the address IP.\nSorry for my English this is not my native language.\n\n. I have done a fresh install and the bug is gone.\n. Yes I confirm all is well. You are always quick as a lighting! I would add like the new user interface with material design it's beautiful :) Thanks\n. Yes perfectly. I have deleted the usage data even if I never used AOSP mode and the entry still there.\n. Just for info I have found an other entry for Framework, Play Service...etc. UID 10024\nthey appear twice at the same time 09.42.48 one with \"Srv_\" and another without.\n\n. Fast as always! I don't have remarked it's already done. Great and helpful future. Thanks!\n. Your thoughts on the ability of disabling usage data log per application maybe with an quirk for example \"nolog\"? It's the most important thing and I think in this way everybody will be happy ;-)  I have the logging always enabled because I like to take a glance at what things are going on but now is impossible to know for example what happened over night because the log is spammed with not about one hundred lines but with in my case 190 lines so as much as I have of applications and and it is at each launch of XPrivacy that the usage log begins with these lines 190 lines.\nThere is a misunderstanding I think about removing the UID parameters for XPrivacy itself for getPackagesForUid/Srv_getPackagesForUid which you have added in version 3.5.1\n\n. I have rechecked and these entry's going to occupy almost half of main usage data log because of this I can only see the last 40-60 minutes in global usage data and we lose a lot of valuable input.\nWe must scroll and scroll to see others entry's, additionally there is sometimes isolated entry between that long sequences of entry's so this becomes very painful to manage. \n.     \n. I know about six pairs of digits for address MAC but like I said I have two pair of zero 00:00\nbefore six pairs of digits of my fake address \"C0\" in the screenshot is the first pair.\n. Install this application: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.he.networktools&hl=en\nAllow Internet/NetworkInterfaces.getNetworkInterfaces and Network/NetworkInterface.getInterfaceAddresses and restrict Network/NetworkInterface.getHardwareAddress for Network Tools\nswitch on WiFi then go to Interface Information as you see in the screenshot\nall interfaces have two pairs of zeroes before fake address MAC\nScreenshot attached:\n\nPS. I have that problem on both device HTC OneM8 4.4.4 and HTC OneS 4.2.2\nI have tried also with application specific settings with the same result.\nMaybe you have different result in AOSP mode because personnaly I'm in compatibility mode?\n. \nI hope you will understand me now with this screenshot is done with specific application settings before I simply hid the last few digits because the fake MAC is which I use actually. I can count anyway :) \n. Here is the proof that XPrivacy precisely the functions Network/NetworkInterface.getHardwareAddress  add two pairs of zero for the network interface and not for WiFI info.\nI have defaced the MAC address completely in the main settings see the result for Network Interface\ntwo pairs of zeroes before DE:FA:CE:DE:FA:CE\n\nWiFi info tab no zeroes before DE:FA:CE:DE:FA:CE here:\n\nHere in the applications specific settings I tried with only four pairs of digits for address MAC (D9:75:2D:D5) like you see in the first screenshot four pairs of zeroes are added for network interface instead two pairs (I didn't know that XPrivacy complete the MAC address with the zeroes) like for WiFi info tab in the second screenshot.\nFirst screenshot:\n\nSecond screenshot:\n\nI have tried with three applications with the same result.

    "jesselai": "Would the exported license file go to the .xprivacy folder like the settings?  Then would the app be able to do the license file check from that folder as well as the SDCard root folder?\n. I don't think #1024 covers my particular use case in mind, but @M66B suggestion to allow multiple imports should work, it will just take some extra work with ensuring the generation of the settings files, but you'd have to do that anyway with the merge operations.\nThe reason that #1024 isn't the same is because I was trying to create a single settings file from multiple ones that contained potentially different sets of apps.  That way a single settings file could be used across devices.  #1024 does allow selecting apps to import, but the trick is getting apps that aren't installed on the current device into the settings file.\n. Hmm, I thought maybe you had thought of that but I hadn't tried yet.  So I just did, but it didn't work as you just described.  In the global settings area, I checked \"Randomize on boot\".  I had a lat/long entered for a fixed value.  After a reboot, the lat/long are somewhere else in the world not randomized around the fixed location.  I am on 1.99.11 for reference.\n. I think we are not talking the same thing.  I believe you are referring to the per app data that is randomized.  I don't use any per app randomization.  I just use the global values.  What I'm trying to achieve is the ability to randomize the global settings on boot, but not the base location setting. I'd like to keep it at a fixed value.  But when I just checked randomize on boot, it randomized the base location which I didn't want.  Does that make sense?\n. Great, thanks for considering it :)\n. Hi Marcel, I tried upgrading again from 1.11.11 to 1.99.14 and 1.99.16, and it still had the problem described in the original report.\nEdit: Also, just checked the commit and noticed that it attempted to add a version check for the Location settings.  Was there a different commit that was for the System ones? \n. I just tested the version that you linked in an upgrade from 1.11.11.  It worked flawlessly.  I noticed that there is now an upgrading dialog which is a nice touch.  Thanks for looking into it again.  I checked several apps to ensure that it was correct.  I also double check some apps that had Internet restricted before the upgrade, and those settings looked correct as well in terms of the new restrictions.\n. ",

But ithen I realized that t changed with newer Xpivacy versions or Xposed and when those were uninstalled the problem disappeared. By turning xprivacy on the problem arose. Also the current changed wifi name of uni wifi service (?) to 0x0000000000000 is a problem that I encountered before.\nMy compliments for your diversity in thinking.\n. hi Rovo,\nSo I did another experiment to prove my case. I went back to the first place and turned Xprivacy off. Still nothing. So I got confused, because last time it wifi disappeared or wifi names got scrambled by turning Xprivacy on; it was not Exposed as I concluded on previous tests(uninstall) and pointed out by your Russian friend.\nBack to the second place I discovered that uni wifi service as name also had disappeared from the list, blank. Yet there was a connection and working login; again it was called 0x0000000000000. These findings are consistent with my previous findings of a un noticed connection, but one mentioned in the usage log.  As attachment you will find a link to the usage log and zipped log files and logcat.\nI will also open a ticket on App settings due to two noticed java script errors in the log files.\nLink of 4 log files Xposed 8-1 till 20-1\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=49601281&highlight=github#post49601281\nTo answer your request to look at usage date, I doubt if that is it for I do have un noticed access. \n. A new omni system became available was installed. Unfortunatly DNS problems so I reinstalled previous one. But it did force me to reinstall Xposed 241 and xprivacy 1.10. No connection problems until installed. After installation name changed to 0x00000000. With previous higher Xprivacy installations no connection; a blank list of wifi connections. From memory no problems with 1.9 pro\n. Hi,\nI already had turned debug log on. By going to a newer version of Xprivacy did the wifi connection disappear; I use 1.10 to make sure I have one! I tried but failed to find a log cat. Same problem with all red branched apps turned off. I will try a black reboot!\nName change due to Xprivacy turned on.\nI am afraid that you will have face my Xposed logs in App settings for they mention java script errors ...\n. Before this I installed them one by one, that is how I ended up with Xprivacy. But you were right; the wifi name is normal with a blank reboot of Xprivacy. I also installed with blank red branched system apks, so it is a white one. Sometimes by ticking su, the red ones are also selected ...\n. I will now reboot with blank Xprivacy 1.11\n. On installing 1.11.11 and downloading 1.10 I got error message of whitelist failure. Great that you ended location problems in 1.11.11\n. First I have to report a lock in boot with 1.11.11; I had to reinstall the system and went back to 1.10.\nA whitelist error is a short time displayed toast message that says something being unable to save to either Xposed or Xprivacy's white list.\n. I will open a new issue for lock in boot. \n. do I have to press the cat for uploading the log cat?\n. Cannot access xda # 1106 connection refused ...\n. Yes that one works but 1.99.1 on xda is refused. On deinstallation of Xprivacy 1.11.11 to install 1.10  I got the whitelist failure toast again; something with an Xposed module whitelist (dir + filename) saving failure and then gone. \n. The cat below is just a cat that you can press.\n. On downloading Xprivacy 1.10 in Xposed do I also get a google play services has stopped ok screen. This one I would restrict first ...\n. hi Marcell,\nWell you know the story, no log due to deinstallation Xprivacy because of lock in boot and therefore usage of old version.\nUnable to open it as issue on Xposed for issues are turned off.\nI looked up old debug file but it was saved 2 hours earlier due to new installation and am still unable to locate logcat.\n. CONGRATULATIONS with your rookie of the year price, its an honour to meet you sir!\nWell I Installed Archidroid 2.3.7 and found after two days that Xprivacy was not installed in Xposed according to the message.

Sorry link links to github homepage not to frequent asked questions nr 49. Archidroid is an update from the previous kitkat system 4.2.2.

Yes.\nTry to look for help on how to create log file in debian and FAQ49, then pastebin\n. True.

So does the dutch version. However, in many other translations I found 4.0+. I don't know if it is very important, but I corrected this in the French and German translations.\n. Understood!\n. I am not sure I do understand completely what you mean by more subtle. A change in size is probably not a good idea, may be the colour could be changed slightly as to make it a little bit more faint. Another idea just came into my mind, and so I come back to my suggestion above: what do you think about having a second \"i\"-icon? For example, you use the icon you have now for the categories, the circle symbolizing the globe, the global internet connection. A second \"i\"-icon could have the shape of an opened book, representing the local information popup, and allow for distinction between category and function as you have pointed out. If then this new icon was moved over to the left, I imagine the layout would look a little bit more elegant and tapping on the checkbox by accident instead of hitting the \"i\" would be much more unlikely.\n. Well then, if you will allow for a little bit of time (since I have to address some other obligations this weekend) I will create icons for you next week.\n. I created 4 icons. I recreated the two \"i\"-icons with a slightly larger gap below the dot of the \"i\" to make the dot more easily distinguishable. In addition I also created 2 new icons which you might call  the iBooks (pun intended, of course). I you wish to receive them by pm let me know how to do that, because I didn't find a way to attach files to xda pm's. Otherwise, I can add them to the repo as well and set up a pull request.\n. Do not pull yet. There seem to be replacement errors in -ar / -he / -ku / -fa files.\nI have to check these files again.\n. @M66B : I have checked the files again. Obviously only right-to-left scripts are affected. Probably the files are correct, but incorrectly displayed only (e.g. \"1% xxxx $d\" instead of \"xxxx %1$d\"). I was puzzled after I followed the link to the translations above and found that the arabic translation did not look as expected. I tried to make the same changes manually using my editor and the same result occurred. I hope Android will interpret the strings as intended. Things also change in the editor when a different character set is selected (ANSI, UTF, ...), so the sequence of characters seems to be as expected.\n. French and German Translation Update\n. Change applied to new Malayan translation.\n. No, sorry, no tests done so far. I only browsed through the files for a short check.\nAt this time, I have no idea how to build xprivacy or any other android app.\nThis may potentially change in the future. I have reviewed the betas though, when previous changes had been integrated. I hope you still find this contribution helpful.\n. I have installed the ADT bundle and made an attempt to build version 1.99.49. I found that the filesize was different when compared to the .apk from the repo, so what do I have to do to verify that I get exactly the same result that you do? There are a few points I am not sure about:\nDo I have to install JDK or is JRE sufficient?\nDo I have to install additional Google APIs down to 4.0.3?\nAny options that must be selected when building the .apk?\nIs a particular version of the SDK/tools / platform tools / build tools required?\n. Thanks to you both, I downloaded adt-bundle-windows-x86-20131030, it contained Android 4.4.2 by default. I used the sdk manager to download Android 4.2.2 SDK Platform and ARM System image. I assume I now have to change Android 4.4.2 to 4.2.2 in the package explorer window (it would be great if you could provide a hint how to do that), right? And after that, I would eventually be ready to export the .apk?\n. Ok, thanks, we will see. I think, the drivers are ok, at least I can see the phone is detected correctly when USB is connected and I click on Run. I am going to unistall the downloaded XP version next, then I will launch XP from eclipse. I hope I won't blow up anything, because I feel I don't know exactly what I am actually doing...\n. @M66B : I have managed to build Xprivacy an let it run on my phone. I used 1.99.48 and included the German translation from this pull request. When I opened the \"About Xprivacy\"-window everything looked fine. Of course, this is far from 100% test coverage, so what tests did you have in mind when you asked about tests in a previous comment? There are strings (like migrating or upgrading), that I cannot easily provoke to be displayed. I have installed the appSettings module you mentionend in another post, yet I cannot select all languages that are supported by XPrivacy. Especially the ones with the editor display problems I mentioned in a previous comment are not present. What else do you want me to do get this issue completed?\n. In principle yes, but what kind of test environment do you propose to overcome the difficulties I have mentioned?\n. Yes, I can do that, but I would do it once. I don't think it makes sense to install 1.11 more than 40 times to do that for all languages (there is, by the way, already one positional format in the current repo-version). So I will check every single string with such a format once. In addition, I will have a look at the languages I mentioned above. I found an easy workaround. By copying the arabic strings into the italian folder and using appSettings to switch the language for XPrivacy to Italian I could have a look at the arabic version of XPrivacy. There are already obvious problems with displaying the arabic strings in the repo-versions (e.g. \"((M66B\" instead of \"(M66B)\" ). I will attempt to fix that. Do you agree on this approach?\n. I don't have hangouts yet (may be subject to change, but it is also a privacy issue).\nI did some research work. Reversed and dislocated brackets in r-2-l languages are a known problem.\nThis can be fixed with special characters (RLM/LRM). I already did some tests with the arabic strings, but my time is up and I will probably be offline for the weekend. I think I can provide tested fixes for the affected strings.xml files next week.\n. Quote:\"You could install 1.11 stable, set some restriction and then migrate this restriction by installing 1.99.x\"\nI don't know how to build 1.11. I cannot find a tag for 1.11 in the repo. Also, I have not been able to get the \"app_notxposed\" message. I both disabled and uninstalled Xposed, but I only got \"Privacy service not found...\", when I  opened XPrivacy. When I installed an older Xposed version, I got the same screen. Xprivacy could not be activated in the older Xposed installer, which is indicating that a newer Xposed bridge version is needed. Do you have some hints for me?\n. If this is the way you wish to go, I can do that. At least, I am now well trained in resolving language file merge conflicts....\nShall I also do a cleanup and remove the one positional format that already somehow found its way into the translations?\n. Cleanup done as a part of issue #1446.\n. I have no objection except that I believe it should read \"Licence trouv\u00e9e\", because licence is female, or am I wrong?\n. The display errors are independent of the format string. Shall I remove the positional formats and provide the fixed files for these \"special\" languages?\n. Unfortunately, a script does not make sense because the changes I made were not the same for the different languages. I made all changes manually and tested the changes on my phone until everything looked allright. I only corrected problems that affected the \"About\" window.\n. Positional format reverted, cleanup done (see comment in issue #1344), everything should be ready for take-off.\n. What do you mean by \"This is not correct, Arabic script is written from right to left.\"??\nThis fix was all about languages which are written right to left!?\n. As a reference and for documentation purposes, I have attached screenshots of the broken arabic language file currently used in XPrivacy and the fixed version I have created.\nI know you don't want to use it, but let me know what exactly is incorrect and how you discovered the error, because I put quite some effort into creating and testing this fix. So I would like to learn what I did wrong and why I missed it.\n\n\n. Latest versions have been checked again with 1.99.71. Merge conflicts have been resolved.\n. You are always welcome! I am sometimes stubborn as well...\n. I have to admit this makes also sense. It's actually prudent.\n. I am also learning to get better at making this choice, but every once a while my ambition gets in the way....     Sometimes I just contemplate the idea that perfection is a matter of perspective, and so holistically (and philosophically speaking) everything is already perfect. That helps sometimes to stop putting too much effort into certain things...\n. I will think about that. This may take some  time, because I do not have Java programming experience, but I would probably have to review the code to some extent in order to see where and how often strings have been used.\n. And another vote from me :-)\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=50658039&postcount=7729\n. When you press and hold one selected app, all selections will be removed.\nWhen you just tap on a selected app, then only this particular app will no longer be selected.\n. Yes, I am sometimes following the commits. I did not notice at first that the changelog was different, but this happened because you added the line to the previous version (1.99.60).\n. wont fix.\n. Short SRT AppGuard description added.\n. I do totally completely utterly agree :-)\nBy the way, what do you think about making the strings in functions.xml translatable (in some distant future)?\n. Great! The marketing department probably would say: Latest proactive design strategies have been used in the development of XPrivacy....\n. Yes, this is actually quite a good match. In German you would say \"von jemandem eine Scheibe abschneiden\", in English you would say \"to take a leaf out of someone's book\", as far as I know. I just asked my brother in law, who happens to be dutch. :-)\n. I am not a native speaker, but as far as I know you can say both. I learned the version with leaf first, that's why I quoted it.\n. Well, I do have to admit that I did not learn the \"real\" English, because my teacher was very fond of British English, so she did everything to make sure that we learned to speak British English. I know that books have pages, but idiomatic phrases are sometimes different. May be we just stumbled upon such a case, just another little difference between American and British English. You inspired me to look it up in my dictionary, and yes, it is actually there. So I even learned some more things I never heard before, like \"to leaf through a book\" (you would probably say \"to run over the pages\") or \"to turn over a leaf\" which means \"to open a new chapter\" or \"to start a new life\".\nI promise I will stop now, although I believe it probably would take us a lot more comments before Marcel would stop us. There is actually something beyond XPrivacy... :-)\n. Or he is just too weak to yell at us because his inbox is flooded with so much more other annoying stuff...\n. I really like to explore those little differences in languages, this is much fun (and can sometimes lead to sudden changes in skin colour...). Or should I write color? ;-)\n. I thought novice users could use the extra select \"all button\" you have provided, so in a sense I was just thinking about how to make this button a little bit less redundant... ;-)\nBut anyhow, thanks for awarding me Xprivacy expert user status, I hope you already prepared a little certificate for me :-)\n. I noticed that the dutch and the slovakian translation have been migrated to positional format strings. I offer to do the same for French and German, if you will accept it.\n. Did you include this change in 2.0.3 already?\n. It looks pretty good now. I do not remember exactly, but I believe the spinner was also displayed within the text previously. I have attached 3 screenshots:\n1.before import\n2. while importing\n3. after import\n\n\n\n. I would like to add that I noticed there are only 2 functions listed in the notifications category, but there are 3 strings in functions.xml.\n. I will make a separate pull request. Shall I leave this line untouched:\nxmlns:tools=\"http://schemas.android.com/tools\" ?\n. Sorry, my question was not precise enough. I just wanted to know if it could or should be changed to https too.\n. It seems that \\n has no effect when used in a help string. Do you know why?\n. Yes.\n. I don't see big maintenance issues here, and if translation is actually taken into consideration, it does not make sense at all without embedded documentation, at least to me as it seems highly unlikely that the Google documentation will be translated into all the languages XPrivacy already offers.\nI have added what I felt was missing and what I thought other XP users with limited Android background would also appreciate (and this is still incomplete). It seems I have misunderstood you because I thought it was your intention to provide a little bit of embedded documentation too, when we were discussing the different info-icons.\nI have included everything from your comments to the degree possible into the latest version (#1584). Yet I am still wondering what you actually had in mind when you said (if I may quote) \"If you improve the documentation, I guess you will help quite some users, so please do so.\" Your comments didn't really help me to figure that out.\n. Do you have a clue what the issue might be? Is there a difference between menus and usage data listing, when displaying translated strings, something to have a look at which could be reported?\n. For documentation: Answer from AppSettings thread:\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=51429982&postcount=794\n. +1\nJust my (one) cent...\n. Checked commits again.\n. Sorry, but this takes a little while...  I was running my own XPrivacy build. I modified some strings to fix a menu display problem. So I had to deinstall XP first (not being aware this also would delete my license file). I am just looking for my backups to get the license back to be able to import my most recent settings...\n. I have tested your version, this issue seems to be fixed. Good! I hope my whole deinstall-reinstall-export-import-procedure did not interfere. I have also taken the chance to check the documentation icons. Tapping on the icon on function level works, on category level it does not. Shall I create an issue for thatl?\n. I don't know how to block toasts. At least, XPrivacy itself is completely unrestricted. And I have seen toasts (\"restricted by XPrivacy\") when I recently had put a restriction too much on my calendar app. Where do I have to look for such blockages?\n. Thanks, your hint pointed me in the correct direction, Yet it took me hours to find the solution . Since I didn't find anything helpful about blocking toasts with google I made a logcat out of desperation. So I found a message from the notification service that a notification from xprivacy was suppressed by user request. This message and google finally led me to the app manager. Notifications were switched off for xprivacy. I was not aware of the existence of this setting at all and I do not remember to have even touched xprivacy in the app manager. So I am still wondering about how and why, since notifications seem to be switched on by default for other apps. The good thing is: I solved a second issue I had for some time. Searching for updates didn't work for me, I got no respose. Now I know why. :-)\n. Then I will also report on XDA. I am still using Samsung stock ROM JB 4.1.2 on my Galaxy Note and stock app manager. However, I have already invested some hours in ROM research. I will lose a few features but since privacy is more important to me it seems I must move to Kitkat now. I am already almost sure I am going to use Omnirom, but I have not made my final decision yet. -- stopping OT talk now :-)\n. Somehow our work seems to have overlapped. Sometimes I do not understand what git is doing. Some of your commits are merged twice into my branches, now I am ahead of you. However, I checked M66B:master, you have pulled all in I did, so everything is fine.\n. @tonymanou: I am sorry I messed things up a little bit, you are right. Thanks for your links. But there actually was a race condition resulting in a merge conflict and Marcel asked me to create a new pull request. So I didn't notice you had removed those spaces, but I saw your commit with those lines:\n-  Aide\n+ Aide \u2026\nThis is why I unfortunately concluded that a space should be there and so I added them (again). I will revert that. English is a different story, there are different (sometimes odd ) standards but having a leading space is considered to be good practice in typesetting unless it will be combined with other punctuation. In German you have the spaces before and behind the ellipsis if whole words or sentences are replaced. There is no space if you cut off a part of a long word and add the dots instead. So please excuse me for being a little bit too quick this time!\n. @M66B: I did unknowingly disagree :-). Therefore there was no discussion. I will fix it.\n[Was already fixed by tonymanou.]\n. ",

    "Ano11": "Hi there Marcel and others,\nI just purchased XPrivacy Pro in order to restrict WhatsApp from getting all of my phonebook contacts. After installing WhatsApp, I restrict the \"Contacts\" group in XPrivacy and start WhatsApp: the contact list in WhatsApp is empty, as it should. Next, I select several contacts in XPrivacy to be allowed for WhatsApp. When I re-open WhatsApp and choose \"Refresh\", the selected contacts are found. So far so good.\nBut after a reboot of the phone, the contact list in WhatsApp is empty again, refreshing the contacts list still leaves the list empty.\nWhen I now go to \"Allow contacts\" in XPrivacy again, each contact I selected earlier to allow is now shown in the list twice! One of them is checked, one is not checked. When I check the second one as well, the contacts appear in the WhatsApp contact list again after a refresh.\nAfter another reboot, the contacts are still are not there in the WhatsApp contact list. When I open XPrivacy and I look at the \"allow\" list in XPrivacy, the double contacts are still there but the second one is unchecked again! Putting a checkmark there again, the contacts are found in WhatsApp.\nConclusion: I can live with the fact that my WhatsApp contacts appear two times in my phonebook, if that is what it takes for XPrivacy to work. However, every time when I reboot I have to manually run XPrivacy and have to re-check all my contacts in the \"allow list\" again in order for WhatsApp to see them. That's very annoying, especially when you have many, many contacts in your phonebook...\nIs this something that can be resolved? I am using a double-sim Nokia X phone.\nThanks!\n. @M66B\nI have a new phone (Samsung GH-130H) with Android 4.4.2.\nNow it works fine, no problems with disappearing contacts anymore ;-)\n. Well, there still seems to be an issue...\nEverything looks fine in WhatsApp itself and in the phone's Contact list, however, the \"Allow contacts\" list in XPrivacy gets longer and longer...\nEverytime I reboot a new entry is added for the selected contacts, for each allowed entry one is ticked and the others are unticked. I guess after 1,000,000 reboots this might result in an over flow error ? ;-)\nOr is there another way to force XPrivacy to use the 'old' settings before the reboot?\n. ",

    "banderos101": "me three\n. \"Here's my 2c\nI think the prompt should give ...\nThe choice between the function & the category\nThe choice of duration: once, 10 mins, always\nThe choice to Allow or Deny\nThat should cover pretty much all use cases that people could think up & I don't think we can simplify the available choices without getting complaints.\"\nYep, this is pretty much my line of thought,  dont want to make it difficult for new users, yet give some flexibility for how on demand behaves, options like the above,  although, if possible and not a pain\n\"The choice of duration: once, 10 mins, always\"\nI'd also add a session option, i.e. force close and restart........this would give us a quick way to reset on demand, for situations where this might be convinient,  one example i can think off, is accidently clicking the wrong option on demand,  and not having to wait 10 minutes to have on demand re-ask me, or having to go into xprivacy,  i have my android back button setup to force close on long press,  so if i accidently choose a wrong selection or am testing things,  i can quickly long press back, which usually takes me back to homescreen and imediatly start again\nSorry if i keep repeating myself about the timer,  but is it technically funtionally possible to put a timer on the on demand set to \"session\" deny, so you'd have to force close/open to reset that restriction call.......one of the features of lbe that really compliments this,  was a log of the restrictions, specifically,  what its popup allowed/denied,  where this comes in handy, say for instance......i start an app,  im suddenly called away,  i come back,  and that app isnt working,  one thing i could quickly check with lbe,  was whether its popup had denied something while i was away,  and generally,  it was nice to have a log specifically for what the popup allowed/denied with what app,  if you maybe decide to attempt this, no rush,  lets get the basics down first\n. \"It also came to my mind that when on demand is enabled, the template shouldn't be applied.\"\nWhat about, using the same method you use to restrict dangerous funtions for user defined restrictions, where template is applied, except these funtions\nYou could add another one for on demand, long press a restriction to add it to on demand,  use a different colour then red highlight,  any restriction you select in whichever app you happen to be in will apply to all apps that ask for this restriction,  this way,  we can apply a template that blocks the most common restrictions a user will always want blocked as before,  AND, have a selection of user defined on demand requests, plus,  if my thinking is right, it might give on demand less to do,  if like me, you happen to always restrict several non conflict categories on all apps by default in my template (deny and forget,  only having to tinker if you come into conflicts,  which is VERY rare withe the restrictions i choose,  either apps dont ask for those persmissions or xprivacy does its job very well\nPlus, the added benefit to this,  is the ability to be informed of any specific restriction a user might want monitored,  a sort of warning feature,  something i kinda consider a whole new feature in and of itself,  the way i see it,  in this situation,  if a popup comes up,  it means its definatly a restriction i specifically chose to be informed about\nedit\ni think some of my suggestions are a bit premature,  the more i read about the on demands behaviour and user interface,  the more i suspect its not doing things in the way i originally thought(based mostly on user comments, and not experience, so far),  thats my bad, basing suggestings on my assumptions,  i need to stop jumping the gun like this,  but on demand is such a brilliant feature i cant help myself\n. Can ask a question out of curiosity\nTypically,  do apps ask for persmission all at once,  or do they ask them in a process,  i.e. if i pick a random app, and want a restriction to ask for permission in the internet, storag and system categories,  knowing that app definatly needs certain permssions fom those catogories, so i know ill be getting three popups,  my question,  do these permissions get asked at the same time when i start the app (not in xprivacy,  i mean in android internals),  or does the first one get called,  and the next persmission only gets asked once the app has recieved a response from the first permission,  if its neither, if its something else entirely,  or just genaraly a little more complicated then that,  that would actually be helpful too,  trial and error,  ruling things out,  a simple no would suffice :) if your to busy\n. yeah some of my ideas were based on assumptions rather then on hand experience of how on demand worked,  it might be a while before i get a proper grasp of the new features , this may take while\n. i cant update, beyond 1.99.25,  so i cant comment on how its been implemented on the latest versions,  but i hope its okay, later on that we could make any suggestions that might present themselves\nAnyway\nThis is how i always imagined it, no expectations, just throwing out ideas\nTwo options, always,  Allow and Deny\nThe effect these two options would have,  lets say were talking about the internet category......the two actions of Deny/allow, would be to either deny/allow that restriction between an app start and an app being closed (temporary allow/deny untill app restart),  when app is closed that selection gets reset, so the next time you start the app, you get asked again,  and you can chose to do the same, and repeat the process,  or if this particular app start you dont or do need internet, then you can just choose the other option and repeat the process when app is restarted,   and if you include a tick box with \"rember selection\"  no more asking of that restriction,  it'll essentially be like opening up xprivacy manually and either putting a tick or leaving it blank dependant on what you choose, allow or deny after ticking remember option\nif this cant be implemented in this way or you feel its better the way it is let me know,  i dont want to keep pestering you with this\nThe idea is to have a method to allow/deny particular restrictions you might need for one session of an app, but might not need for another session of an app,  aswell as having a blanket yes or no,  for instance,  an app with an in built update feature,  but i only want that app to have access to the internet if i know im gonna check for updates,  i could offcourse go into xprivacy and uncheck the required restrictions,  but what i tend to do, which im not fond of doing is just allowing it so i dont have the \"hassle\",  this is where on demand streamlines things,  i just have to open the app in question,  choose what i want when i need it,  and have xprivacy restrict internet by default if there is no response within a certain amount of time\n. \"Instead of \"(dangerous)\" I propose the reddish background color.\"\nred background or dangerous label\nwhich would be more clear for users, maybe both?\n. :)\n. i second that thanks\nWhats better then having one genius dev working on your favorite project????\nHaving two genius devs working on your favorite project :)\n. I am 100% per cent on board with this,  expanding xprivacy in this direction,  but its marcels decision,  and i think he's created xprivacy for a very specific reason, namely privacy, not so much in general security,  which what you bring up id consider an example of it......although i still hold out hope that after marcel has progressed xprivacy to maximum stability and maximum possible feature,  i hope he'll come back and review this decision.........i even though maybe, instead of mixing it in with xprivacy which deals in its namesake, privacy,  he or maybe someone else could create another app for security, dealing in the kind of things as the example you give.....\"xsecurity\" and \"xprivacy\" :)\nIts entirely wishfull thinking,  im not saying this with any reasonable expectations,  as i have no idea what kind of work, effort or knowledge  it would take to do that, let alone the williness.......but i hope,  and at the end of the day, i hoped once, and along came xprivacy :)\n. Thanks for the info, i had a feeling it might be something like that, but always wondered, so again thanks for clearing/confirming that up\n. thanks so much anon for that list of test apps\n. and heres me ready to suggest you put these apps in your faq,  boy did i almost walk into that one......always ahead of the game i see, i gotta stop being surprised by that\nThanks for the list marcel, really helpfull\n. \"This works for my apps that require storage access only one time out of ten instances of me using that app, like my launcher, apex, where i could for example, only use its backup feature one time out of ten uses of the app, so i would temp allow that one time, and when i dont need to backup i temp deny, hence the temp deny option, because i need it to deny, but i also need the prompt back, the NEXT time, when in that one time out of ten, i DO need it (temp allow)\"\nThis is basically a very very quick \"shortcut\", to, going into xprivacy, finding my app, scrolling to restriction, unrestrict, go home, open apex, backup, go back to xprivacy and restrict storage again\nAnd i can apply this to many apps and restrictions,  internet, storage, su, mic, camera etc etc.......like an \"interactive\" permissions........i personally would start off by choosing one or two apps, and then test the limits, i.e. conflicts, performance\n. yeah, exactly,  this wouldnt just be limited to storage,  as you pointed out, can be applied to many......and im not to fussed about the storage restriction i used it as an example\nAnother one being,  using es file explorer to browse a network folder,  i dont want to permanently allow es file explorer internet,  only when i actually want to browse my network folders, hence the temp allow/deny,  deny when i dont need it,  and allow when i do,  and prompt always returns on any temp selection,  unless you permanantly allow by checking \"remember option\"......permanantly allow i can see being used to test which restrictions can or cant be restricted, if app crashes, the next time you start, permanently allow that restriction\nedit\nwhich reminds me,  it was a good idea to include catogory selection on ondemand,  i dont bother with individual restrictions in the internet category,  as many apps need quite a few from there,  so i unrestrict the whole thing(hopefully ill rectify that),  so having the abillity to allow/deny whole catagory was a better idea then i originaly did not think :)\n. yeah, that sounds good,  always create the app to not risk new users restricting something they shouldnt,  quite happy to have to turn this feature on, as long as my current settings for them are remembered\nthanks marcel, your the best\ni was just thinking,  is there anyway to give an indication on the main/app screen, to let the user always know when these things are enabled or not........like a small recognizable icon for \"restrict dangerous\" would be greyed out if off,  and coloured when on......its not an essential feature granted,  but it certainly streamlines things(the less touches you have to make, the more streamlined things become i.e. wanting to know if a setting is on/off).........but i suspect its not possible, not enough space, or android wont allow it,  goes without saying, that if the coding is more then its worth, then dont worry about it\n. damn,  ok,  maybe ill grow into the current implementation,  although its a shame really,  ......i dont suppose adding a \"Ask\" and \"Restrict\" title as headers would intice you to change your mind :)\ncant blame me for trying.......i bow to your choice\n. \"i cant speak for jpeg,  but for me, personally,  it would help to less confuse things,  if the original column would stay the way its always been used for restrictions,  and any question marks (selectable) on any given restriction on the NEW column would basically mean \"prompt this restriction if its called\",  simple,  and you'd have a nice gui indication in xprivacy letting you know what is or isnt being prompted.....at the moment, at least for me,  merging prompt selection with the original restriction column is a little confusing,  .......well,  not so much confusing,  but it doesnt feel like the best approach to me,  but maybe this is one of those things that is easy to say but not easy to code,    maybe its one of those things you gotta get used too\nedit\nso a PERMANENT  allow/deny (remember choice),  would clear the questionmark(ask) column and set the restriction column depending on what you picked allow or deny\"\n. i \"THINK\", this implementation could accomadate both styles no,  if there is an option to select ALL for the \"?\" column,  then this way,  both styles could be accomadated, i still wanna be able to go into xprivacy and restrict the catogories that are hardly used for new apps,  and use the prompt for specific restrictions, like the examples above...............im so used to the original column that it feels weird not having a tick/box/blank in them, i get an irational thought that its not protected,  thats why, the new column, to seperate the ondemand feature from the original restriction feature, and perhaps make clear \"?\" supercedes the original column, if its enabled somehow,    i guess im set in my ways when it comes to xprivacy......it's what, 4, 5....6 months old?.....yep, set in my ways :)\nlll try not to bother you guys so much with this, gonna be difficult :), but ill try,  and ill give the current implementation a better chance\n. yeah, im trying to imagine it, and i guess your right,  one question though, how will you implement the third option \"?\",  do you simply touch the box a third time, so, \nrestrict,\nunrestrict,\n?........\nor if the box is unrestricted first, then \nrestrict,\n? \nunrestrict\nor wont we be able to manually turn on a prompt for anygiven restriction\n. ok thanks\n. \"3) There does not seem to be a way to reset \"request on demand\" for an app. When a function was allowed and \"request on demand\" is switched off and on again, the function that was allowed before will be without a question mark.\"\nif im reading that right,  thats why i sugested a \"temp alow\" option,  for restrictions i might want to only allow once in every 5 intances of using an app,  like for instance internet.......i want to allow that one time,  but i also want the prompt to return because i might not want that app to have internet access the next time,  the way it is now,  if i allow,  i have to go back into xprivacy and turn on prompt for that restriction again,  whereas a temp allow, would allow that one time, AND reset the prompt to return the next time that restriction is called for, where i would temp deny when internet is not needed,  the temp funtioning as a \"hey i want this allowed/denied, but i want you to return the next time this restriction is called for\nTwo options, Allow/Deny,  by default,  both set to temp, with a switch, that flips that to permanent, the \"remember selection\" option,  to me, that seems the most intuiative way,  but maybe that only applies to the way im looking to use ondemand, i dont know\nFor me, its a little confusing having three options,  when what i need can be done with two,  and another benefit to having the two options set to temporarily by default, is that if a new user accidently denies something he shouldnt, and app crashes, the prompt comes back,  samething with temp allow,  if a new user accidently allows something they didnt want to allow, prompt comes back next time restriction is called again,  this basically saves a new user/vets from having to go back into xprivacy finding the app then restriction and re-ondemand\nthis reminds me, ive been meaning to ask,  what right now,   \"resets\" the prompt,\nevery instance a restriction is called?\npredetermined set amount of time?\nor app force close, open?\nor something else?\n. \"I would also not display the question mark next to blocked functions/categories\"\nI actually think its better to have a question mark irregardless of whether a restriction box is ticked or blanked,  making it clear to users, that a ? would supercede the tick or blank,  i.e. ? =a definite prompt iregardless of tick or blank,  the reason why, THIS paranoid person might worry that on demand might not function as expexted one day,  and might not prompt when it should,  and in that situation,  if xprivacy then falls back to following whats been selected for that permission,  at least it'll have the correct information to fall back on,  a tick or blank,  but this i think needs a second column in order for this to work i think,  user interface wise.....things might function in the background correctly,  xprivacy might even already take this worry into account,  but they'll be no easy user interface to communicate this,  not using just one column,  not when the option to turn on a prompt is the requirement,  or non requirement of either a tick or a blank........if that makes sense\nlets wait and see what the next version brings\n. can xprivacy not \"hook\" into that moment,  when the email address gets \"sent\" to the enquiring app, and then modifying the email to a dummy one you've setup in xprivacy,  maybe at the start give the app access to query the (?accounts manager?system) but then intercept the response from the ?system account manger?, change to dummy,  and let the response move on to the app that originally queried the ?system account manager? (i.e. i dont know which system app it is\nOr even if ann app has to first go through a system app for that matter,  maybe any app can query email address directly or something\noffcourse im assuming xposed/xprivacy is even capable of intercepting like this,  and whether this is how the app is behaving, so if this comes across as nonsense which i suspect it does, please ignore\n. @M66B \n4.1.2  touchwiz based rom\nyou know,  you'd think i'd know\ni assume ... = @ \nand does + actually mean +\nno \"com\" in the end no\nwould it be okay to send over xda pm,  i dont feel confident enough to break that 128encryption :),  might end up  going back and fourth just trying to get the email right, let alone getting my issue diagnosed :)\nedit: if thats cool\nedit2:can i even attach using xda\n. ok, one long ass list coming your way\n. @M66B \nsent.........i hope :)\nlet me know if i did the logcat wrong,  happy to do a new one,  first time, be gentle :)\n. @M66B \nthanks marcell\n. @M66B \nhi marcel, im able to test now,  but the link you gave by email says \"file not found\",  any chance for a reupload?\n. @M66B \nyep, thats fixed it for me,  on demand now shows, and no more freezing,  i now can test run on demand\nIll close this now,  as its been fixed, thanks marcell\n. i just wanna chime in here and say, i have this issue too\n. if were talking about extra filter options, then i'd add also add to the list\nAllowed account\nExample use\nFor quickly checking if you've accidently allowed an app to access one of your accounts, or to quickly see if you remembered to allow that particular app, that particular account.....or to quickly check if things migrated correctly across upgrades\nContacts\nexample use\nsame as above\nalhough, the nature of these two things,  might need its own filter section,  maybe,  and perhaps alot of work,  so devs perogative here\nmaybe when things get quiet,  when the amazing work currently is has gotten to a point where its able to \"fly free\" :)\n. @vavavr00m \nI think we already have the category bit down,  but i agree with you, i hope one day we can get as deep as the individual restrictions themselves,  not to replace category but to compliment it\nedit\n\"across the board\",  the template for instance, where the categories can be expanded,  but no rush if something like this is put in the todo list,  its a MAJOR convinience rather then a MAJOR essential\n. @M66B \n\"You can globally enable/disable on demand restricting in the main settings and do the same for each application individually.\"\nI though you had to enable both \"global\" AND user apps, in order to activate prompting,  maybe you should change the title of the global one to something like \"Restrict on demand for new apps\", to clarify this\nAs to the point firefairy makes i think holds merit,  i think that selecting and the indication of what restrictions get prompted should be seperated from the original restriction boxes,  like a seperate column specifically for on demand,  where on demand is a funtion a user must manually choose for their interested restrictions, respectfully\nIf this second column is possible according to android/xprivacy/code design,  then it would be present in ALL apps,  but by default, ALL prompt boxes will be empty,  and the user would need to enable a prompt manually for any restriction they specifically want,  in this scenario,  would there still be a need for an option within apps to \"restrict on demand\",  the selectable global one has its place,  to enable/disable prompts upon new app installs,  but unles \"restrict on demand\" for individual apps is some sort of dependancy for on demand to function,  i think the second prompt column,  no selections by default, would make in app \"restrict on demand\" obsolete no\nadding a small title for the two column to help new users, something like\nPrompt                              Restrictions\n                                                  Select/Unselect all                Select/Unselect all\nAccounts                                                   [   ]                                         [   ]\nBrowser                                                     [   ]                                         [   ]\nThe select/unselect would free up space in the menu no,  maybe use the same code you use for toggle,  for the select unselect\nedit:  this is what the above was suppose to look like\n\nAnyway thats just an idea\nedit2:select/unselect all would only be available in app maybe, to avoid selecting system restriction in the global app list,  or, maybe not,  as we already have the ability to \"toggle\" all restrictions in the global app screen even systems..........i can see myself using the filters/and category list on the global screen to filter,  and then having a nice easy way to select/unselect all apps ive just filtered\nedit\nmaybe adding a template feature for prompts on new installs would be something to add too,  basically,  everything we've gotten used too with the restrictions, duplicated but seperated (UI) from restrictions for the on demand,   maybe even sharing the same code where applicable i.e. template code,  columns code,\na sort of template code for on demand using what you already have implemented with the restriction \"boxes\" code........if that makes sense\n. Thats cool man, Dev knows best,  but i still cant help the nagging feeling that a better implementation could be implemented,  i mean, i still think my suggesting, assuming im considering all the angles here,  would be easier for new users too,  hell,  im a \"vet\" of xprivacy,  in its use, in talking about hours put in,  and even im a little confused by the current implementation\nIll leave it as an idea then,   like ive said in the past, maybe its just something that needs getting used too\nThanks for clarifying the global/individual \"restrict on demand\" option\n. \"or would replacing the check with a question mark when a function will be asked about be a good idea?\"\nThat i think i can live with,  a cycle of three options for a restriction box,  tick/blank/?,  as long as the \"?\" is defaulted to deny restriction upon timer countdown,  with \"restrict dangerous\" enabled,  as i believe it already is,  this \"default\" would have to stay like this through future versions,  because people might end up relying on this behaviour to deny temporarilly\n\"and maybe adding a question mark on top of a filled square meaning some asked for too.\"\nin regard to categories\nYeah, this sounds good too,  but how would you handle a category with just ONE change,  a ? in one of the boxes,  would you put both \"blue box\" and ? super imposed in that box,  or would you just put a ? in the category box minus the \"blue box\" , to indicate that the change within that category is a ? change,  either all restrictions in that category has a ?, or like my example, only one, and the rest is restricted.\nedit: thinking on this method, im not to sure now,  as i would like to be informed of that one ?,  but also be made aware that the rest of the restrictions in that category are all restricted,  what do you do then,  tick + ?.......that might nit look right,  and maybe confuse matters even worse\nIn a situation where you might have one restriction set to ?, one restriction that is unrestricted, and the rest is restricted,  then you can then have the category box, have the \"blue box\" with the ? super imposed over it, to indicate this category has both prompts AND a unristriction\nAnyway,   ill leave it up to you guys, i get the feeling this is soon gonna go above my head,  plus, i dont know what kind of work this will involve so......its your choices to make\n. \"Turning off can simply be done by answering the dialog.\nUnless there are good reasons to change this, I like to keep it as simple as it is.\"\nI think there are two \"camps\" here when it comes to on demand\nUsing on demand to limit using xprivacy's main interface\nVs\nUsing on demand to compliment xprivacy's main interface\nIm the latter,  enabling what i need when i need of on demand,  but more or less use xprivacy the exact same way ive been using it, before on demand\nI think this explains why some folks, like me, are wondering about the current implementation,  not a critizism of it,  as i believe both have their uses,  maybe even both could probably be implemented with clever options/switches and clear descriptions,  but i think thats probably gonna be alot of work,  to implement both,  and probably a few brain melts just trying to think of the best way to approach it..........i hope you guys know that, this is just talk of that \"best approach\",  and not talk with expectation......well ok,  maybe just a little, but the talk of ideas in the \"approach\" is interesting \n. @M66B \n\"The current implementation is indeed designed as an alternative to manually restricting.\"\nI was getting that feeling, unfortunatly for me, i might not be getting much use out of it,  but that doesnt mean ill stop testing it, who knows i could be wrong\n\"An implementation for both approaches would probably make the code more complex\"\nI was worried that might be the case\n\"Know that it wasn't easy to get everything right in the current implementation.\"\nand thats why i should really wait before commenting,  please dont feel that the hard work i sensed you guys have been doing over the last couple of days, is'nt appreaciated\n\"which doesn't mean it won't change in the near future\"\nif and when gentlemen,  if you can, and when you can, no expectations....if i say anything that might contradict that, sorry,  ......likely gonna put my foot in mouth on this, so,  pre-sorry :)\n@jpeg729 \n\"We could discuss the options till the cows come home\"\nAmen brother, amen\nedit: not an endorsement to do so :)\n. @M66B \n\"If you deny a function in an allowed category, all the functions in the category functions are denied, but still being asked for\"\nAssuming im reading that correctly,  and sorry to keep on pestering you with this marcel......but then,  wouldnt that mean,  that if i deny a category with a tick, as above,  i SHOULDNT get a prompt for ANY restriction in that catogory nor that category.........and just to clarify,  does \"?\" mean that a prompt will appear if that restriction is called for?\nheres another screenie,  i didnt change anything within this app,  this is whats presented when i enable \"restrict on demand\" in the app\nedit:sorry that \"no ticks\" should read, \" no.. ?\"\n\nIf im still not getting it, no worries,  but if this is a bug,  and you want me to test things, like clear all prompt selections in app menu, and try again to see if same results, let me know\n. @jpeg729 \nAhhh, ok,  that explains alot,  so some of those categories with a ? in them are there because there were no restrictions within that category,  to call the prompt and thus make a choice that might have gotten rid of that ? depending on the choice you made in the prompt\nSo that basically means that when turning on \"restrict on demand\" for an app,  EVERYTHING gets a ?.........no choice to manually pick them? no wait thats not right, i thought, currently at least, it was based on unrestricted functions......this is confusing man.......sorry jpeg,  maybe i just need time to think about this more\n. ah, ok,  not to worry\n. @M66B \nhorizontal dividers?\n. @M66B \nhorizontal dividers?\noh i get you,  yeah,  that might work\n. do you want me to make a mockup, before doing, just to get an idea to see if its worth it\n. can i quickly ask a question, while its on my mind, but can xprivacy not change its layout dependant on how big the display is,  obviously, my design up there wont work on smaller screens, as i think you'd have to make things smaller, and perhaps harder to \"choose\"..........but could xprivacy not use a seperate set of layouts, if it, lets say, detects a larger screen like a 7inch or higher,  just out of curiousty\n. I dont know marcel,  its your perogative,  or communities?  i personally think it doesnt look to good,  or at least my quick mockup doesnt,  maybe adding a  space between the main 3 filter \"groups\", assuming thats possible, assuming all devices have enough real estate for three extra spaces between the three groups, or whether it will achieve the goal of user friendlier\n\n. @M66B \n\"I theory yes, but it requires more work and we have already enough ...\"\nNot to worry marcel,  its more for my personal curiousty then a request\n. seing as it sounds like your busy,  ill close this,  something tells me your working on something \n. @M66B \n:)\nYep, i like it,  didnt think i would,  but i do :)\nThanks for quickly throwing this together so i could test it,  up to you if you want to implement it into the main app, as  your in the better position to know if it'll work throughout all devices, but personally tastes, yeah, i think it really highlights the different \"groups\".......by the way, good idea on centering the whole thing\nNew\n\nCurrent\n\nedit\njust one minor visual suggestion, maybe align the two \"negate\" options,  if you can, assuming you do put it in main app, and that all screen sizes can support it\nedit 2\nif this works ok in smaller devices, maybe the clear all button can be reduced in size slightly, it looks slightly big,  maybe you could gain another space for another filter option in the future, should one come around......edit: relooking at it,  its such a small concern,  and it really is'nt that bad,  maybe forget this suggesting, unless others start expressing the same thing.......get back to what you feel needs more time on\n. Sorry, if this comes across as critizism of your work marcel,  but something like this.....\nthe negate options aligned, and the clear all button, SAME size, but slightly pushed down\n\nDifference (original)\n\nIm more then happy to discuss these things then for you to apply them,  i enjoy the disscussion of ideas,  offcourse obviously i like to try them out too,  but  in your own time,  what im saying, is,  theres no rush, if you decide to implement any of my suggestions,  quite happy for you to implement others first.\nedit\njust another mockup, messing around with the spacing\n\nedit: same picture as above,  SLIGHTLY better spacing, just improving my \"design\" idea.\n\nedit\nYou know,  apart from aligning the \"negate\" options,  looking at it again,  i think you got it near enough perfect,  ......dont mind my \"revisions\" above,  i think you got it pretty good,  in your first attempt no less.......sorry for nitpicking :)\n. i would LOVE this as a feature, ive thought about this myself, and not just limited to xprivacy......but i have a feeling it might not be possible without third party apps \"cooperation\",  i.e. your launcher\ni could be wrong, i hope im wrong,  who knows maybe a module might come along to make it easy to implement the windows equivalent to \"open with\".......to our launcher apps,  imagine,  easilly accesing an apps \"page\" in any app, such as xprivacy, greenify, app settings.........just by going to that specific app, long press, \"open with\" and go directly to that apps page in the respective app you chose.........would be somethin,  hope one day someone brings this to android, assuming there are no massive negatives to doing so(stability, privacy, security.....)\n. @jpeg729 \nTheoretically, is it possible for an xposed module to intercept any/all launcher long press on apps in homescreens,  is the \"call\" not the same being used across all android versions,  could a module not potentially add an extra long press option.........could this module not act as a go between,  between the app in question,  and the app you want to open it with,  passing along the app package name maybe, to identify, for instance, in xprivacy,  which app page to show.......theoretically of course\n. @M66B \nim not sure were talking about the same thing here......., are we?\nSorry,  perhaps your talking in more advance terms, in that case, yeah, your probably right :)\n. @KOLANICH \nah sorry,  i thought you were talking about something like this\n\nbut adding something like this\n\nwhich would open the app, in this example xprivacy, straight in xprivacies page in xprivacy.......mmmmmm, probably should of used a different app as an example\nlike this\n\n@jpeg729 \nshame there is not some kind of hook or intent \"sniffer\" app,  to accomodate xprivacy\nMaybe these \"custom\" hooks is  something that needs to be implemented in xposed itself instead of xprivacy, in which case,  not much you guys can do in this regard, i understand,  \nthanks as always for the info jpeg\n. i'd also add \nOn demand Clear(reapply previous restriction configuration)\nFor those like me who would then select what they want prompted individually,  at the moment, unless its been changed in recent version,  when i turn on on demand, i'd have to unselect all the prompts that got enabled manually,  unless this is possible through filters, but if so,  i think the current discussion may be a good solution\nNever underestimate the two options to \"set all/clear all\", if i may be so bold\n. @jpeg729 \ni agree, the data usage is extremely helpfull,  and i also agree, that, enhancements like that would be even more extremely helpfull'er :)..........yes, i make words up, sue me,  or dont...........please dont :)\n. @M66B \n\"but it would require a lot of test work).\"\nTo get something like xprivacy up and running with potential new tools at its disposal........would be worth it\nedit\nto clarify,  if you meant user end,  didnt mean it would be worth it if you \"dropped everything in your life\" in order to test this :)\n. @M66B \nFixed,  thankyou marcel\n\n. @jpeg729 \ni'd assumed thats how it was functioning now already.........can the prompt identify all intances of function requests, and if not,  does this mean that an enabled prompt for an app, may be allowing the functions it cant detect, access?\nIm basing this assumption, that not all restriction access may be detected by the prompt, the idea coming from the fact, that,  the data usage cant detect all restriction access by apps....\n. @jpeg729 \nin my mind, the difference between the two, is switching between on demand and manual mode,  being new to prompting,  essentially a new user, i'd want the ability to test the prompt,  with the ability to go back to template, incase ive allowed something permanantly in haste, and didnt quite have time to see which restriction it was,  but i can see your way working,  for me,  would only be used once ive become accustomed to the prompt......i'd put,  and i hate to say it,  yet another option somewhere to ENABLE remembered prompts, something like \"remember prompt selections\",  i'd leave the default state to you guys, even though my preference would initially be to NOT remember,  until ive gotten used to the prompt,  ......\nSorry jpeg dont mean to be so .......annoying......especially when your trying to help no less........especially so if what i speak translates into a headache of massive proportions in the code work, and generally talking of features that are'nt code possible\n. @jpeg729 \n\"If a restriction's access isn't detected by the prompt, then it isn't detected at all and we have a problem.\"\n\"The problem is that where the ui shows a question mark the stored restrict state could be either allow or deny. Mostly we don't care because in either case you'll be asked, providing asking is enabled.\"\nJust to clarify,  do these restrictions that cant be detected get the ? aswell,  and if so,  what happens,  does xprivacy automatically allow or deny in this instance.......if it cant be detected, i assume it should be denied just incase it gets called but nevef actually having any indication of it, because it cant be detected,  so whats the behaviour if such a restriction has a ? in its box,  .......prompt wont show, because the restriction use is undetectable,  and there'll be no tick in the box to deny regardless of use\nAny one example of a restriction the prompt cant detect,  is it all the same ones the data usage cant detect?\n. \"How about the following in the batch ops we've been talking about elsewhere #1319\nRestrict all\nApply template\nTurn off prompting\nClear all\nFetch\nSubmit\"\nthis i'd need to think on,  but for the love of christ, dont hold your breath :).....im just not that smart\n\"The turn off prompting option would set the not yet asked-for functions/categories according to the template.\"\nIdeally,  the remembered changes you made to an app,  but this is a good solution too,  at least xprivacy would be practising its namesake,  privacy, if like me you have a totally restricted template,  the only very minor downside to this is re-going through the app and again unrestricting the restrictions you changed........i can see this being a pain for me with certain system apps,.........when i first started using xprivacy, i had a hell of a time trying to figure out\nwhy playstore wouldnt download\nwhy i couldnt create accounts\nwhy i couldnt see any wifi hotspots\nwhy i couldnt see apps and running apps in android settings.....and a few others\nsome of these im confident enough to remember,  and yet some of them really got me tearing me hair out,  i dont think i'd be able to remember them ALL......hell, who knows,  maybe this dilema would make me better understand i.e. remember my selections,  and help me understand better the cause and effect of certain restrictions................i say this just to let you know why, incase im coming accross overly insistand my mention of remembered changes.........which is all a non issue as im thinking about it now,  due to import/export,  .......i guess im used to the ease of how xprivacy remembers my changes now, when i toggle between states (unselected/remembered configuration)\ni dont envy you your task,  im not coding this thing, and only now am i starting to understand the complexity of this behaviour thing,  you guys should be applauded for getting it just this far alone\n. @jpeg729 \n\"Sorry, I was wrong - sometimes the prompt isn't shown, for example if the caller isn't an application - which presumably means that it is part of android - in which case the default is to allow. Other exceptions include system apps if the setting Restrict system apps isn't checked, and a few others to avoid lockups and bootloops. Prompts aren't shown during booting and the default in that case, I think is to deny for user apps.\nI think that for everything a user might care about the prompts are shown.\nThe ones whose usage can't be detected are generally restricted when the info is prepared because we can't intercept the app's attempt to read it. So the prompt shows when the info is prepared, such as on app start for inet, sdcard and media.\"\nthat was very helpfull that post,  so much so you have me wishing there was a way to \"bookmark\" posts,  thanks man\n. yes,  but im speaking about remembering the state of configuration that i chose through manually,  for those instances that i might have permanantly allowed something in prompt i didnt originally intend to and not realising,  and potentially leaving my setup unbeknownst to me, unprotected, potentially.\nAt least with my remembered manual choices, i know, i have all what i want restricted plus those remembered changes i might have made in order to make something function whether that be the entire app or a certain function of an app..........i dont know,  maybe im just set in my ways of the xprivacy, so used to the manual approach that im having a hard time adjusting........i think once one or two features get implemented for the prompt like, select/unselect all, i might be in a better possition to thourougly test it\n. thats cool man,  at the very least we can fall back on our templates,  its just a convinience that is lost,  and it may only be for me \nedit\nwell actually,  we still have import/export,  that would function in that way, just slightly longer to restore is all\n. i hadn't considered that function to the global setting,  yes indeed, that is something worth keeping,  as i dont relish the thought of anyone having to go into the many individual apps they may have prompted just to unprompt,  for testing or issue puposes.......mmmm\n?\nanother option in global settings, not ideal,  space wise,  or maybe the use of the filter and then an option to toggle between prompt,  and template/manual changes\nMaybe a better solution,  beyond the likes of me\n. after considering it somemore, after the importnt funtion of the global option that jpeg pointed out,  how about,  assuming you havent started to implement something already,  keep the \"dependancy\",  and having a seperate option to enable prompt for new apps,  the original global settings being now used only to enable and disable prompts for all apps\nedit\nsomething like\n\"enable/disable on demand globally\"\n\"enable/disable on demand for newly installed app\"\n. Im quite partial to this approach  personally :),  but the current form is more then sufficient, minus the bugs\n\nedit: UI\n. okie doke\n. maybe at somepoint,  you might want to write a brief explanation, xplaining the reason xprivacy and lbe cant coexist,  explaining the feature that xprivacy would have to give up in order to let them,  i can forsee alot of lbe users at some point going on to test xprivacy,  having something like that, the community could quickly link/paste to might help alliviate lbe questions with new users........maybe adding some code that might help lbe dev to pinpoint and maybe fix on his end,  if lbe users see this,  and enough ask him to look into it,  both sides might benefit\nI personally cant see myself going back to lbe in the forseeable future, being closed source,  with root and modification in the system,  oh, and closed source,  did i not mention that.........not that, that means its doing anything malicious or that open source is a guarantee if you cant understand code,  but its a step in the right direction as far as im concerned\n. @M66B \nSorry marcel, had'nt realised you had already done that\nClassic case of foot in mouth again\n@Something2 \ni THINK,  there was an issue not too long ago, and i THINK it was resolved at the time,  but i THINK it came back again, and i THINK its the same issue your currently discussing i.e. just happened over the last week or so\n. @M66B \nok,  thanks for the quick reply\nSo, we've got the privacy bit down, with xprivacy\nJust gotta wait for the dev that then sorts out the \"prevent hacking, cracking, cloaking root, game cheating, etc\" bit :)\nHope he doesnt take TOO long\nNot that i expect this from you marcel,  but im just curious to know,  personal question, is that something you wouldnt mind coming out too,  do you not worry about these things, would you use the xprivacy equivalent to \"xsecurity\",  assuming it was backed by a good dev, represented in their work, like you.........or is that too .......i dont know......too paranoid for you?\n. @M66B \ni dont discount that,  but does it address such apps like dsploit,  or other apps that might secretly add similar functions,  i think having a user controlled aspect to these kind of functions would be really good,  well,  at least there is 1 demand in that market\nAnyway, thanks for your thoughts on the matter marcel,  no more questions,  ......i promiss :)\n. @jpeg729 \ni didnt think about the root aspect, and as far as ive gathred once you got root, you can pretty much do what you like\ni guess what im looking for is supersu and xprivacies love child,  you never know,  certainly wouldnt surprise me should some dev in future release an app to monitor/inform/control these things in some form,  supersu's genes with xprivacies brains :)....\nOne can hope\n. Ive thought about this,  and i know it might sound out there,  but wouldnt knowing a devices timeZONE be a form of knowing ones location albeit very roughly,  but still,  its a potential location leak no?\nSome apps might need this info,  maybe could give them a seperate timzone,  and those apps you need the correct time and relatively trust, you could unrestrict.\nI dont know how dependant all apps are on having the \"time\",  maybe many dont need nor call,  but it would be nice to have this angle covered none the less\nwell thats just my thoughts on the matter\n. i know what you mean,  but if everyone starts taking that stance,  an understandable stance,  then inevitably,  folks will figure out that is is a consistant way to, for whatever reason,  find a rough estimation of location\nIf you do end up adding it,  maybe dont particularly advertise the feafure, beyond the changelog...if you do end up adding it\nThis probably is a bigger debate,  but personally,  i dont relish the idea that  users might not get certain restrictions that would  protect their privacy,  because of those that might misuse it.....\nI, know, you implemented it for privacy,  others,  know you implemented for privacy,  anyone who says or implies otherwise, is not someone i'd take seriously on the subject, as what their knowingly or unknowingly calling for is LESS protection,  and i cant stand behind that,  even knowing there might be users misusing it,  but thats just my personal view on it,  not just limited to the scope of xprivacy.......whatever you decide though,  its upto you,  but my vote says to add it,  and if you feel you need to remove it later,  fair enough,  this is your baby\n. I'd also add that in respect to ease and UI,  this method would be benificial in those fields too\n. \"restrict \"people\"\n:D luv it\n. i think it depends on what app your using,  like a browser might ask for one ip/url address for every opened or refreshed website\nThis is such a nice feature, it would be a shame to lose it,  what about incorporating a whitelist of some kind, an ability to \"add\",  in the prompt itself,  and a manual way in xprivacy to view/add/and remove  an ip/url address in that whitelist.......just one sugestion\nedit:\nwould that actually help in your situation vibes, i can think of one in my case,   the restriction will still ask my for the internet connection,  but the ip/url would already be whitelisted, so i wouldnt get multiple instances of ip/url address ive reviewed and greenlighted,  while new apps still have to go through the \"review\" process untill you deem it trustworthy,  or as much as one can\n. @jpeg729 \n@M66B \n\"Added template for on demand restricting, thanks @jpeg729 (issue)\"\nThankyou jpeg, thanks marcel, look forward to testing it\n. @M66B \ndamn,  im sorry marcel,  hope i didnt waste your time,  im glad to hear its already in there, my blind eyes must have missed it,  off to try it\nedit\njust tried it,  its a pro feature,  so, for now i cant do this.........im waiting for a decent bitcoin \"wallet\",  with continous support(dev), and open source, which we can easilly add funds,  when that happens,  expect a purchase,  and keep the refund from the playstore.....worth it\nBrilliant idea to incoporate something like bitcoin,  and the CHOICE to use dispossable info like temporary email,   really brilliant,  I HOPE THAT STAYS .....forever and forever :)\nP.S\n\"with continous support(dev),\"\nI think you've spoilt other devs for me, shame on you\n. @an0n981 \nthat would be a nice function to have\n. really nice features these, love the level of control too,  individual or sub domains,  thanks anon for bringing the idea up, thanks marcel for implementing\n. @M66B \n@Cyclu \n@anon\nwhen things quiet down and xprivacy has gotten to a point where your struggling to find features you havent already added, i hope you revisit this,  its always nice to have a manual method where you can take your leisure in choosing what you want,  i can deliberate for a pretty long time, in any given restriction, plus i can research in between my choices......this is where i get to learn,  and the prompt will be used on those things ive learned about in my deliberations,  for us folks who dont know instictively what everything does,  i think its invaluable,  just like the data usage function is invaluble to me,  ......and if i can humbley take the liberty even further, i wouldnt mind seing at some future point,  specific \"manager\" separate screens for those individual paramaters(IP/storage) that might add even more function to xprivacy,  like anon mentioned in another thread,  paraphrasing,  \"we could potentially block sub domain ip's, like the entirety of europe\"................im probably butchering the technical knowledge in that last bit\n. @M66B \nthanks marcel,  that would be fantastic\nThinking about this app, I'd like to nominate\nNetwork Connections\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.antispycell.connmonitor\nfor your list of apps that compliment xprivacy\n. @an0n981 \nthanks anon,  always like to know what else is out there, off to check it out\nedit\n\"the origin of network monitor is rather sketchy\",  how do you mean?\n@M66B \nsure thing, ill just nand and test it out, and, DAMN, that was fast :)\n. @an0n981 \nthey who shall not be named\nThanks for that bit of info,  like marcel im partial to open source when its available,  nice one for bringing this one to my attention\n@M66B \n\nWorks very nicely,  and so damn quick,  xprivacy seems to be progressing leaps and bounds recently,  you guys are doing an amazing job here\nJust a quick note about the copy/paste, dont know if its a bug or intended function,  but im unable to \"click\" on the restrictions that i can copy/paste,  in order to go to the app using that restriction, if that makes sense\n. @M66B \noh, by the way, if ive not said it already,  loving the new layout of the data usage screen ....\"leaps and bounds\"\n. specific feature added super quick, closing,  thanks marcell\nedit\nok.....uhhh..mmmm, .....wheres the close button *scratches head\nedit2\noh, ok,  duh.....its already closed...........you see,  super quick :)\n. I cannot understand how you are so awesome :)\nI dont know what i did to deserve such an execellent service,  but.... ill take it :),  off to test now, will report back\n. @M66B \nyep, i can now seperately pick the restriction or copy the parameter,  although, is the blue highlight when long pressing a restriction with parameters, in the usage screen suppose to be gone,  is that a sacrafice.....it helps because the listings come out quite small, and the blue highlight helps me from accidently picking the wrong restriction,  unless your willing to make the data usage listings bigger(touch area),  i know the 10.1 has room to spare,  but dont know how that will translate to other screen devices\nThere is a bug though,  any restriction that does NOT,  have any parameter information in them can now, NOT be selected...........in your own time marcel, more then happy to wait, if you want to come back to this later, if this is turning out to be a \"big\" feature,  meaning the work of a big feature\nedits\n. @M66B \n\"This is only one of the many possible ways to make an internet connection, but all go through connect.\"\nFeels like there's perfect material somewhere in there for the restriction \"connect's\" documentation........luv the new icons for the documentation by the way,  all these little things really make a big difference, inline with the big features added aswell\n. @M66B \nyeah, sorry, i meant restart,  and yeah, i had completly forgoten about the toast notification, sorry man, my bad.......but i still kinda hope that the documentation can evolve in this kinda direction one day\n. no problemo,  thanks for the feedback\n. while keeping a date stamp too?, if your planning on implementing, please marcel......only if its easy to implement,  and that you were'nt planning to already, offcourse\n. ok,  that originally went over my head, but i think after checking xprivacy i get some of what your saying,  i hadnt realised there was a on demand  template because ive had on denand disabled mostly since its inception,  as i didnt want new apps getting automatically ondemanded,  which ive just now realised after enabling ondemand,  i can technically turn this off with the template,  which is great, it means i can keep on demand enabled from now on,  which means i can finally play around with it.......sorry,  although, as long as its because its too much work,  ill hold up hope that at somepoint in the future the category feature will be accounted for when batch ondemanding,  just a hope,  nothing more\n. @jpeg729 \n\"I also thought it would be good to have an easy way to enable on-demand just for one category.\"\n+1\n\"Which is a little obscure.\"\n+3\n\"Haven't people been asking for a way to enable on-demand for a single category like internet to loads of apps at once?\"\n+12\n. @M66B \n@drsood \nI think what hes saying is, when you enable ondemand \"setting\" it applies the ? to all the categories,  and then when he wants to apply his template ?'s,  all the catagories still have the ?'s, instead of, for example,  the \"connect\" restriction in the internet catagory which has been chosen in this example template........is that righ drsood?\n. im in agreement with jpeg on this,  template i think should be seperate from this,  otherwise you have a template thats constantly being changed then changed back to suit the specific need,  is it still a template after that? i dont know\nIdeally, another option in the -toggle option- menu,  to  put a ? next to a category or individual restriction seperate from the template,  as the two first options behave, ondemand -setting- automatically enabled,   is what \"feels\" natural, what i mean by that, is less noobs like me, scratching heads and making posts like these that will probably annoy you, sorry for that marcel\nIf jpeg has implemented something to this affect above in his commit, id be interested in testing that out for sure\nedit\ni mean,  you could have a warning text to inform the user of the consequence to enabling on demand for too many apps like\nWarning!!! Enabling ondemand for All or too many apps could result in many popups, please filter your required apps in main console first, always backup first, ideally nand backup just incase\nor something like that\n. \"The template is and will not be a Swiss army knife, so please stop asking about enhancing it. I have been adding new features for nine months now and enough is enough.\"\nI think you misunderstanding me, if you're refering to me that is,  ........im not discussing template additions,  the opposite in fact,  i think you guys have the template perfect, just dont know how i feel about using it to apply ondemand on individual catagories, when you could have the code to switch on ondemand without having to use template, like you have the first two option on the toogle options\nAnyway,  thy will be done\n. Im partial to suggest a small list of options to seperate certain backups when choosing the import in the GLOBAL screen\ni.e.\nRestore Xprivacy Settings\nRestore Template Configuration\nRestore Restriction/Ondemand (ideally this would be two seperate options)\nRestore All\nor something like that,  writing it in such a way that is self explanitory to new users\n. @vavavr00m \nIm also hoping that the idea behind these changes happen aswell,  kinda hoping that in the future other devs can implement these ui enhancements, (the way the data is collected, presented and filtered, like your parameter console) so that marcel can focus all his time on the meat and veg of what xprivacy was built for,  hopefully marcel will see the value of these devs when they come calling\n. A restriction for this would be most welcome,  if its possible.\n. Bitcoin may or may not survive, but i hope the idea and reasoning for bitcoin stays on\n. +1 \n. \"I didn't give a 1+ yet because it is still unclear to me how this feature would be implemented. Marcel seems to be reluctant to implement the original proposal. Any comments on my approach?\"\nI think i jumped the shark myself,  ideally,  i would want the ability to toggle the ?  in an apps main screen also, rather then fiddling about with an app, and then having to go go to main screen to toggle ? (Select/unselect),  when i was just in that app,  seems like an unecesary step, in this specific scenario,  dont get me wrong, the original idea ks still usefull,  and maybe its a completely different request then what i had originally thought,  so my bad for imposing another request here if so\n. That is most welcomed,  hopefully in the very distant well rested plenty of time on your hands future,  we might be able to bring it all the way down to the restriction aswell as category level, but that is another discussion for another time,  for now, additional main console control is a most welcomed addition\n. Thats a shame,  i think anon makes a  point, these little touches make a big difference as a whole,  can i ask why?\n. Sounds like  good idea for file explorers and sorting\n+1\n. +1\nI feel like there could be situations this might come in usefull, specifically xprivacy intents that tasker could take adavantage of, for instance, mind you, just a for instance, an intent to allow android gps access when maps is open,  complimenting the ondemand, offloading the amount of prompts to the most usefull while tasker can take care of the rest,  upon a trigger,   or maybe, if were going ambitious,  use tasker to deny all apps, at least user apps, internet access when device goes to sleep.............anyway,  thats a completely different beast,  and probably much, to much work,  more a fanciful thought,  on the subject at hand, yeah, tasker and this intent would give the user more options, and more options is alrite by me :)\nCan i put +9 on my tab, im good for it honest :)\n. @Cerberus-tm \nThe thing is as ive just realised, how do you \"authorise\" these intents, how to avoid malicious devs from writing a program that sends out xprivacy intents to switch of restrictions,  so although like you, i would love that,  maybe from a privacy standpoint its not feasable,  unless theres some sort of extra security level with tasker \"plug-ins\"?\n. @an0n981 \nSorry anon for confusing your request if i did,  i agree,  that an intent to randomize fake data is alot more feasable then my discussion on intents to disable/enable  restrictions, from a privacy/security standpoint, cerberus makes a point, but i think its marginal and would require a clever dev with a bright idea with limited amount to work with (randomize intent).........marcel gets the last say on this obviously, being the guy knowing how much work it is and the time he has to spend on it, and obviously the +1's.........gdluck\n. +1\n. @bensisko103 \nDo you have your list filtered......there is a clear all options in the filter popup.......the filter button, the one on the top right on main screen, the one that looks like a wine glass\n. +1\n. @M66B \n\"I was thinking to display a small icon before the check boxes.\nClicking it would open whitelist management for pro version users.\"\nI think that would be a pretty convinient feature for the whitelist/blacklist feature\n. Perfect examples of the kind of things i envisioned with tasker integration,  with the maps app,all the way too screen off = security fort knox clamp down.......restriction automation based on cofigurable events\nTake my money.....ahem.....i mean, heres my +1\n+2 if plugin is possible but assuming its not\n. Regardless of whether this gets implemented or not,  nice discussion here\nMarcel, if your referencing my +2,  sorry man,  it was just to enphasize how much i would have liked the stated idea,  not an assumption that i have two votes....but if anyone deserves +2 voting, anon sure does,  really nice job on the database.md write up......it like a proffesional did it :)\nhttp://www.unwesen.de/2011/04/10/android-intent-sender-verification/\nGood find marcel, interesting reading, shame its not good news,  but its worth knowing\n. @M66B \nI actually think the filtering of system apps would actually be beneficial to troubleshooting,  if a user is having an issue, it might be safe to assume that its likely a system app.....so an option to hide user apps although not a major, would deffinatly be usefull in troubleshooting, in the area of convinience, my personal opinion mind you.\nHaving the usage data reverting to show ALL apps when opening or coming out of usage data, for users new and old, wondering why theres less data usage, forgetting or not knowing about the filter\nMaybe there is a technical reason, if thats the case your the boss\n. Thankyou marcel,  even if your not able to find a solution thanks for looking into this further, goodluck\nEdit:sorry for no actual usefull contribution to the solution\n. @dk-zero-cool \nYes, very very thankyou much dk-zero-cool for helping out\n.

Yes, I agree with an0n981 suggestion.\n. 10068 is lesser pad, the app I used as an example in the log. \nIssue #857 is Samsung  specific and effects the whole clipboard category.\nYes, the log shows hasPrimaryClip=restricted, but it isn't restricted.\n\"Note that copy and cut are not restricted\"\nOK, so if I understand correctly, your confirming that restricting hasPrimaryClip does nothing? If that's right wouldn't it be better if the option wasn't there?\nWhen I updated to the current version of XP the first quick check I did to make sure it was working was to restrict clipboard then check if it was in fact restricted. Because I was still able to copy I thought the update had failed or aspects of the new version were broken, so I restored a 2 week old backup of my ROM (yes, I should of made a backup before updating, lazy). \nOthers might make the same mistake in the future, causing confusion and ultimately more work for you.\n. Regardless of what the log says, I can copy and cut, I can't paste the the text in the app that's restricted, but I can go to another app without clipboard restrictions and paste the text there.\nI'll take some screenshots, maybe then you'll believe me.\n. OK, I understand, restricting hasPrimaryClip is not intended to stop copy and cut.\n. +1\nOK, count me in.\n. I had a different idea to an0n981 were the existing on-demand toggle would have 3 settings instead of 2.\n1. Disabled\n2. Enabled with boxes ticked\n3. Enabled with boxes empty (new feature)\nBut it doesn't really matter how it's implemented, I'm happy with an0n981 idea too.\n. ",
    "drsood": "Whenever I install a new app, I restrict it completely and gradually unrestrict the permissions on using the app multiple times. But each time, I have to open xprivacy first, then look for the app and access its permissions page from there. If I have an Intent for the same, I could combine GMD gesture control (for creating a gesture) and Tasker (for task shortcut) which would allow me to open the permission page of the current foreground app by drawing a gesture over it.\n. Cant get it to work with Intent Tools as well as Tasker. Can someone post an example?\nPS I am not an expert with android coding. As such, just have a very basic knowledge of the intents\n. thanks :+1: \n. Its still there on 1.99.60\nI have faced it twice since yesterday. Each time there were multiple restrict on demand dialogs one after another when the issue appeared.\n. And what should I select under toggle restrictions? Selecting 'enable on demand restricting' enables it for all the premissions of that app... Not just that particular permission!\n. Sorry to trouble you again and again...But I am really confused!!! :(\nI selected '?' against clipboard in template - > selected clipboard and apps on main screen - > toggle restrictions - >  apply template......... this checks clipboard permission for the selected apps but doesnot enable \"restricting on demand\" for THAT permission\n. \"You can batch enable/disable this settings with the last two options of toggle restrictions\"\nThis switches on 'on demand restriction' for all the permissions of that app. That defeats the purpose. Applying template just toggles the permissions, not the \"restrict on demand\" ? placed next to the permissions.\n. I am posting some screenshots. \n\ncurrent setup for firefox app (applied 'enable restricting on demand' followed by 'apply template'):\n\nBut I want configuration like this for lot of apps:\n\nThe method you pointed out doesnt seem to work\n. \"After that you can apply the template to set on demand restricting for all categories or one category.\"\nFor me, this part doesnt work as expected :-( . I'll post a video later on.\n. I think I finally know whats confusing me here.\nM66B, when you enable on demand restriction for an app, does that put '?' besides all the permissions for that app on your device?\n\n. \nIf I apply this template on all the permissions of the app, it sets clipboard to ondemand restriction BUT i loose the settings for other permissions I have already set and now they show up as unset.\nIf I apply this template on Clipboard permission of the app, it sets clipboard to ondemand restriction BUT all other permissions of that app are still also restricted on demand.\nWhat should be the template for setting clipboard to on demand restriction while preserving other already configured permissions?\n. Kindly reply to my previous post\n. \"That said, we could improve the toggle restrictions option to enable/disable on-demand for the selected category only\"\nTHIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I AM LOOKING FOR. Currently it is not possible and this was the reason I created this post as a 'Feature request'\n'Select the clipboard category before toggling restrictions will only apply the template to the selected category.'\nBut this doesnt remove the on demand restriction '?' from other permissions that also been set by enabling on demand setting!!\n. @M66B \"but I have recently made it possible to enable/disable a restriction and/or on demand restricting for one category. Just select a category and apply the template.\"\nAre you referring to v1.99.63?\nIf yes, then I bet, we still cant 'Batch Enable' on demand restriction on 'single' category \"without loosing permissions/ondemand-restrictions already set for other categories\"\n. \"Apply the template\"\nThis doesnt enable restriction on demand for that category (When restriction on demand is disabled for that app). Even if ? is enabled in the template\nJust try this:\n    Select a category in the application list\n    Select one or more applications (ON DEMAND RESTRICTION SHOULD BE OFF FOR THEM)\n    Apply the template\n. What you are saying is 100% true.\nBatch enable enables on demand for all permissions of the app.\nTry this scenario: Select 10 apps for which you have already configured the permissions as per your liking, and eventually turn OFF on-demand switch for them. BUT then you decide that you want to switch on again on-demand restriction for internet category only for those apps.\nIf I follow what you have already told me to do:\nI would select these apps, choose internet category, apply \"enable restricting on demand\" first followed by \"apply template\"\nYes, this does turn on restrict on demand for internet category BUT IT ALSO TURNS ON RESTRICT ON DEMAND FOR ALL OTHER CATEGORIES TOO, WHICH I DONT WANT. I want xprivacy to prompt me again only for internet category, not of other categories. But because switching on demand 'on' set on-demand for other categories, xprivacy will again show dialogs for other categories too.\n. I dont know how to use bold or italics here. Thats why I ended up using capitals.\nIs latest version 1.99.63? I already have it installed.\nI wanted to make a video to demonstrate this, but wasnt able to due to lack of some codec. Can you make a video for the same?\n. @jpeg729 Back me up here. Can you batch enable on-demand for single category without enabling it for other categories?\n. Because jpeg729 mentioned this thread \"Haven't people been asking for a way to enable on-demand for a single category like internet to loads of apps at once?\"\nI already have the latest version.\n. \"I think what hes saying is, when you enable ondemand \"setting\" it applies the ? to all the categories, and then when he wants to apply his template ?'s, all the catagories still have the ?'s,\"\n@banderos101 Yes, thats correct.\n.

In the last weeks xPrivacy was very slow. Long booting process of my device, long and slow reading after opening xPrivacy and randomizing takes after reboot a long time.\nToday In the morning I have tried a new test.\nI think I was yesterday on the right track with my guess of installation-rests of xPrivacy. When I opened xprivacy if a boot was lucky after uninstall and new install the xPrivacy-theme was black, not white. That's mean possibly my user settings.\nMy last action yesterday was the real (!!) delete of the folder data/system/xprivacy with Total Commander-App. See my last post in issue \"Missed clean uninstall process #1614\".\n\"You are right. The \"tool\"( app \"Diskusage) is a fake. It say delete and it is in reality not deleted! The tool was new for me. Please excuse me, my mistake.\n Now I have used the good old Totalcommander, change the rights and delete it.\n Solved /closed.

Look on the file-names from number one to number six.\nI have enabled the xPrivacy Debug log. When the device will hang or have a boot loop, I will send the CatLog to you.\nNow my device is much faster, xPrivacy will open more quickly and the randomizing is also very fast. But I have in the moment only the xPrivacy default themes enabled, no seperate settings in in every single application. I have cleared out many applications, so xPrivacy must not work so hard.\n. Thanks, Marcel,\nYes my gust was: there must be something wrong inside xPrivacy or inside my own xPrivacy settings.\nBut what can I do, when my device is in a boot loop modus?\nI can't clear all the data in menu, the device is still in boot loop\nMy road map:\na) boot in recovery mode\nb) wipe dalvik cache (maybe not necessary)\nc) wipe cash partition (maybe not necessary)\nd) install remover_XPrivacy.zip\ne) reboot\nf) install(!!) xPrivacy again, but without reboot,\nthe installer says then xPrivacy is already installed!\ng) uninstall xPrivacy\nh) reboot\ni) delete old unused folder data/system/xprivacy,\nuse for examble one of the best android applications \"Total Commander\"\nj) install XPrivacy\nk) eneble XPrivacy in Xposed Module\nl) reboot, my device will work and xPrivacy will protect my privacy\nI'm sure; you will fix this and will find a better solution, if it's possible in look to android restrictions.\nRegards and many Thanks\nAmadus17\n----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Marcel Bokhorst \n  To: M66B/XPrivacy \n  Cc: Amadeus17 \n  Sent: Wednesday, April 02, 2014 11:16 AM\n  Subject: Re: [XPrivacy] Boot loop on upgrade from 1.11 to 2.0.14 (#1613)\n@Amadeus17 this means that most probably a restriction was causing your problem.

Sorry if that logcat was short. Just figured it would narrow down things to\nthe moment poweramp tried and failed to verify the license.\n  I don't have any restrictions set on poweramp when I launch it. Unless\nthere is another app (system) that it's leveraging to obtain the\ninformation it needs to license itself.\n  I just know I didn't have an issue until last 1.99.42. And after a\nreboot. The dev for poweramp said so long as the android id and Google\naccount are detected as the same as the purchase it will verify correctly.\nOddly it seemed every time I launched poweramp it detected my google\naccount as my secondary work email account and not my primary. Again I\ndidn't restrict account access either. I even removed my work account,\nrebooted and tried again. No good.\nIs there a way to be sure Xprivacy reports the actual device info and not\nrandom to poweramp specifically?\nOn Feb 13, 2014 11:38 PM, \"Marcel Bokhorst\" notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nThe (short) logcat does not contain useful information.\nI have check all the code for accidentally restricting this, without\nsettings it, but I am quite sure this is not the case. So, either:\n- there must be some restriction visible in the XPrivacy usage data\n  causing this\n- Poweramp checks for XPrivacy and refuses to work if it finds XPrivacy\n- There is a bug in the Poweramp licensing I am downgrading this issue\n  from bug to question.\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/issues/1340#issuecomment-35055057\n.\n.

Agh,... Damn. Well from my research on poweramp's side many users are\nfurious with the dev's way of license verification. Waste of money now I\nguess since the dev seems to care less about changing things. I guess I'll\nhave to use another music app until things get more reasonable with the\nlicensing.\n\nThank you so much again!\nOn Feb 14, 2014 12:20 PM, \"Marcel Bokhorst\" notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nI have bought the Poweramp unlocker and with a few tests I determined that\nas soon as I hook:\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ContentProviderClient.html#query(android.net.Uri,\njava.lang.String[], java.lang.String, java.lang.String[], java.lang.String)\nand even with doing nothing in the hook (an empty function), the unlocker\ndoesn't work anymore.\nThis means that Poweramp has some method to detect that this function has\nbeen hooke.\nSeen from the perfective of XPrivacy I cannot do anything.\nThis hook is needed for a lot of restrictions.\nIt worked until version 1.99.39, because I hooked into another place.\nI don't want to change this back, because this method of hooking is better.\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/issues/1340#issuecomment-35104351\n.\n. Exactly. I wouldn't compromise Xprivacy for the sake of this one app. I'll\njust have to reinforce my disdain to the dev.\nOn Feb 14, 2014 12:26 PM, \"Marcel Bokhorst\" notifications@github.com\nwrote:\nYou are welcome.\nI did what I could, but I cannot fix this without giving up important\nfeatures of XPrivacy.\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/issues/1340#issuecomment-35105006\n.\n. I updated the Xprivacy to 2.0.2 and it still does not see my pro enabler.\n\nI uninstalled Xprivacy, wiped its settings, uninstalled the pro enabler.\nrebooted, cleared all caches,\nRebooted,\nreinstalled Xprivacy, enabled the module in xposed,\nrebooted,\nopened Xprivacy and no pro enabler functions work, clicking \"Pro version\"\nor Import/Export sends my to a web page informing me on how to buy a key\n...again.\nAny ideas?\nlasermole.\nOn Wed, Mar 12, 2014 at 3:57 PM, Marcel Bokhorst\nnotifications@github.comwrote:\n\nPlease upgrade to version 2.0.2 for the enabler problem.

With the update removed all my root\napps work fine. And Xprivacy did too up until recently.\nNeedless to say this is frustrating and I'm questioning the value of\nXprivacy on my phone in general as its become such a pain to manage and\ncount on for a reliable permissions management system. Whats the point of\ncounting on Xprivacy to keep prying eyes off my info if I have to\nrepeatedly unilstall, disable, enable, clear settings and reboot the phone\nand have those apps start up with no gate check in place? Wouldn't that one\ntime the apps startup without Xpivacy blocking their access be enough to\nhave leaked that sensitive info permanently?\nSorry to complain but I'm wasting a lot of time on this.\nlasermole.\nOn Thu, Mar 13, 2014 at 12:24 PM, Cyclu notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n@Lasermole https://github.com/Lasermole I have tested BubbleUPnP\nLicense works for me have you allowed you google account in detailed app\nview Menu>Select account to allow.

    "NocturneBlock": "Can I un-dangerous a permission in the same way? That would mean this serves the need that prompted the request, although then I would lose the information of which apps have been determined as problematic by the devs. Also, I want to not-block specific perms because in my user situation, they are relatively harmless, so using the dangerous filter to control them is more than a little counter-intuitive. \n. If it is intended, I don't expect it to change, but mentioning this behavior somewhere in the readme/tutorial would be a good thing. It is the opposite of a lot of other security-related apps. That said, it's not like it's hard to figure out the behavior, so not a huge deal. \n. Not really. In the Options for the app overall, you set the app to \"allow\" dangerous items to be blocked, or not. As far as I can tell, this only affects whether or not ticking an entire app or category causes the red items to be ticked, as I can manually set them to be blocked even when this option is not active. Rather than a simple yes/no for every case, I would rather be prompted when I set an app or category to block all as to whether I mean that particular action to include the dangerous permissions or not.\n. Using the second version you posted, the exact use case that caused the original problem now functions; the Prompt action takes precedence. \nGreat work, and so fast! I am very impressed. \n. I think we just differ in opinion about how desirable mass prompt is. I would prefer to be notified/prompted quite a bit when first running apps, so that I can get a feel for what they are doing in real time, rather than trying to anticipate every app's needs ahead of time. Sounds like that isn't an intended use pattern for Xprivacy, though.\nI am curious as to why Prompt is considered an exception setup here. Sounds like there is something I am missing. In many desktop security apps, there are settings for how much you want automated and how much you want to deal with via realtime prompts. I usually set them to lots of prompts. Is there a reason that is undesirable in Android, other than the aggravation of getting a zillion prompts the first time you trigger a new event? \n. My bad. I hadn't realized that it only applies the portion of the template you are filtering by. Clever, but not what I was expecting. \n. Thank you! \n. ",

Oh.

I couldn't manage to enable XPrivacy debugging, since I usually have around 15 sec after a reboot to turn off XPrivacy, otherwise the phone hangs and reboots.\nOkay, let me try once again.\n. Nope, that seems to be a mission impossible: XPrivacy doesn't let me turn the debugging on when it is disabled in XPosed, and when it is enabled there - I get my phone hung too fast to enter XPrivacy and pass the memory scan (can't skip or cancel it and it sometimes starts over and over again [due to some crashes]).\nIs there a version of XPrivacy with debugging already enabled?\n. I've noticed that the issue happens not with every Xposed module: some work fine (like ActivityForceNewTask, Advanced Power Menu, Alternate App Picker, Always Expendable Notifications or Greenify) and some cause the issue (XPrivacy, GravityBox).\nBtw, here's a logcat.log for the same issue, but after I turn GravityBox: https://gist.github.com/Drugoy/7eaa8e4922c5cb8308f0\n(I'm posting this since I don't know what info might be useful for you in solving this issue).\nAlso, it was a typo in the question in my previous message: I was asking about XPrivacy, not Xposed.\nMaybe you could slightly re-configure XPrivacy and release a debug version so I could try to show you it's logs?\n.

    "JoachimR": "Thanks for the response although this use case is not officially supported!\nJust for you own interest, what I tried further:\n1. Comment out all the source where you check whether the app is already enabled in Xposed (including the PackageChange.java). This does not work however because although I get the normal start screen,  the 'device needs to be installed' shows up again as soon as you want to modify some settings of an app. I could go and search where else the msg gets created but it is not really a solution to the problem anyway. \n2. Therefore I wiped everything from the phone using TWRP 2.6.3.1 and installed a stable Cyanogenmod for i9300 named cm-11-20140104-SNAPSHOT-M2-i9300.zip\n   After the first boot I enabled USB debugging and installed via the preinstalled FileManager\n   de.robv.android.xposed.installer_v25_36cbbc.apk and my own built XPrivacy.apk (without any modifications in the code). The issue still remains though.\nI thought you might find it interesting because your suggestion that the app is not completely uninstalled seems wrong because of the whole reinstallation of the OS\n. I have already seen the common problems section. That is why \nI wiped everything including the Dalvik cache (but not the internal sdcard) and reinstalled the OS. \nI don't have LBE Security installed, because I just installed the OS. Cyanogenmod has some own security implementation but it is not enabled by default so also nothing is done by that feature for xposed or xprivacy.\nThe app is not on the sd card, I only have an internal sd card and there I can't find it in the folder Android or find a folder called .android_secure\n. I modified PackageChange.java :\npublic class PackageChange extends BroadcastReceiver {\n@Override\npublic void onReceive(final Context context, Intent intent) {\n    Log.d(\"AAAAA\", \"in PackageChange onReceive\");\n    try {\n        // Check uri\n        Uri inputUri = intent.getData();\n        Log.d(\"AAAAA\", \"inputUri.getScheme() = \"  + inputUri.getScheme());\n        // ...\n            Log.d(\"AAAAA\", \"intent.getAction() = \"+intent.getAction());\n       // Check action\n            if (intent.getAction().equals(Intent.ACTION_PACKAGE_ADDED)) {\nand modified BootReceiver.java : \n```\n@Override\npublic void onReceive(final Context context, Intent bootIntent) {\n    //...\n// Check if Xposed enabled\nLog.d(\"AAAAA\", \"Util.isXposedEnabled() = \" + Util.isXposedEnabled());\nif (Util.isXposedEnabled())\n    context.sendBroadcast(new Intent(\"biz.bokhorst.xprivacy.action.ACTIVE\"));\nelse {\n\n```\n//...\nResult when starting the app before and after reboot:\nDEBUG/AAAAA(3125): Util.isXposedEnabled() = false\nBut I enabled it in Xposed Modules and made a reboot\nNo output in Log from PackageChange\n.

    "Vankog": "@M66B \nYou are right. However, the common sense - as far as I have experienced it so far - is quite the other way around:\n- You normally expect software to work correctly, thats why you use it. So there is no need to point out a successful result with a sticky notification when it starts on every boot. (Of course, this can be something different if you invoke a process manually or semi-manually. Like rendering a video or something.)\n- BUT: You want to get notified if something failed.\nSo my suggestion:\nKeep the notification for an ongoing randomization, dismiss it automatically if everything worked out to be fine, but make it sticky if something went wrong.\nWhat do you think?\n. Thanks! it works like a charm now. :-)\n. @M66B \nHm strange...\nYes I do. 2.0.1\nI was able to reproduce it yesterday and today while writing the issue. With multiple reboots in between.\nStrangely enough, the ticks of other functions do work correctly.\n\nI found another app: \"Android Tuner\" by 3c\nThe same scenario and with the same result.\nMaybe its just a simple UI issue? \n\nMy first idea was: Maybe it's because its the first entry in the category.\nHowever, View-WebView works correctly.\nThe next idea: Maybe its a display error due to the black theme. I switched it with no success.\nThe next idea: Maybe its the category at all.\nAnd here seems to be the problem indeed. I've tried it with Shell-LoadLibrary on another app and it shows the same issue.\nSo the Shell category seems to display incorrectly after choosing on-demand restrictions.\nFurther, I also ruled out possible interferences with the template by trying several combinations.\n\nMy global app settings:\nrestrict on demand - true\nshow usage data - true\nno parameters\nno debug \nexpert mode - true\nrestrict system- true\nrestrict dangerous - nope\nsecure connection - true\nrandomize on boot - true\nno further randomize on access\nCategory Shell is set to restricted in the template.\nSystem: Galaxy Nexus (maguro) on Stock 4.1.1 rooted\n. Wow, thank you for this amount of effort!\nIt really seems to work now.\nAnd you also fixed that the SU request was filed as Exec request.\nI was curious about this too, because the Exec call was actually referencing the SU, but I was not sure if this was really a bug or just a quirk.\nSo, great work!\n. hm, it might have happened that I created this twice by accident.\n. Now that I see the change, I remember: Yes, the template was not migrated, too. :-)\n. EDIT: I am not sure if this is actually a direct v. 1.11 to 2.0 migration problem. It seems this could be a problem that reaches back to an even earlier migration.\nWhile really old apps all seem to have this explicit spoof data now. Some more recent apps don't seem to have it.\n. OK, I have a clue:\nThanks to Titanium I was able to sort my apps by install date.\nThe change somewhen occurred between 25th of December 13 until 2nd of January 14. \nAll apps installed up to the 25th of December have explicit data now.\nThe next apps I have installed on the 2nd of January and since then all the spoof data fields are empty as intended.\nAs I update XPrivacy relatively often (except 1.11.11 till 2.0.3 obviously), somewhen in December (I guess in the second half) there was an update that changed this spoof data filling.\nSo all apps that were restricted with earlier XPrivacy versions have explicit spoof data now.\nAll apps that were restricted with newer XPrivacy versions, have empty fields.\n. I guess it just depends on since when someone uses XPrivacy. ;-)\nAnd it only came to my attention, because I was curious how this whole global/non-global settings principle works. Especially, I only realized today that there is a difference in the coloring of the font color saturation which indicates if it is local or global spoof data. This made it finally clear to me and brought the problem to my mind.\n. Basically that's what I meant, except that I didn't know that they are just \"hints\" with dummy values instead of the actual global data.\nHowever, please correct me if I am wrong: \n- If the field is in this light grey, it is empty and the global data will be used for it, right? (Given that the the two app-level randomize options are disabled.)\n- If - on app-level - randomize on boot or on access is turned on, the randomization becomes app specific.\n. My main reason for this is:\nApps like the FB Messenger only use the fine GPS data. It does not use the coarse data for whatever bogus reason. For this it tries to get a GPS fix in just a few seconds. However, this limit is way too short to get a fix when you are indoors or if it is the initial fix outdoors.\nSo: Even though I want to fake the GPS location, the app does not get any location data, because the real GPS time limit is too slow to get a fix.\nThat's why I'd like to suggest to get the seed for the fake GPS not from real GPS, but from coarse data or last known GPS - and keep the seed for some time so it does not need to gather the real data over and over again.\n. Sure, but we already pointed out that this might have some performance improvements if the GPS doesn't have to be cold booted over and over again even though we want to fake the data anyway. :-)\n. Android ID is the same.\n\n\n. Sure, but the Android ID is the same as stated above.\nCould the issue has to do something with the difference in the android version and ROM?\n. I have made a comparison of the exported xml file.\n1. I exported the settings for the play store on the Galaxy Nexus with whitelisted google account.\n-> exported account:\nxml\n    <Setting Id=\"10021\" Type=\"Account\" Name=\"F337A5BDB9862FD8D5F1391122A89FF5FB0B0C99.fc995df81662207e\" Value=\"true\" />\n1. I clean-imported it to the Shield\n   -> whitelist icon appears, but no account is shown as whitelisted\n2. directly exported from Shield again to check for any intrinsic modifications via diff\n   -> except for the IDs of all entries and the ModifyTime entry nothing changed so far. However, even the non-existing whitelisted account was exported again:\nxml\n    <Setting Id=\"10016\" Type=\"Account\" Name=\"F337A5BDB9862FD8D5F1391122A89FF5FB0B0C99.fc995df81662207e\" Value=\"true\" />\n1. fixed the account whitelist by whitelisting the Google account in XPrivacy.\n2. exported again and made a diff\n   -> now the additional account got obviously an entry, too. \nxml\n    <Setting Id=\"10016\" Type=\"Account\" Name=\"EBBC53607CE2AE8087F71FE8D985197208F3E466.fc995df81662207e\" Value=\"true\" />\n    <Setting Id=\"10016\" Type=\"Account\" Name=\"F337A5BDB9862FD8D5F1391122A89FF5FB0B0C99.fc995df81662207e\" Value=\"true\" />\nHowever, while the AndroidID is the same, the name of the Google account (in contrast of what you said not an email address) has changed, even though the accounts were directly backed-up and restored via Titanium.\n\nI have no idea why Titanium did not restore the accounts with the same name. I'll test this out. Probably has something to do with some settings (migration mode or backup format).\n. Well it was just an educated guess about what might be going wrong here, nothing more. It might be something totally different that's just connected with these functions. \nI think you are the expert for this and you can assess what's going on here better than anyone else could. \nThe problem is that right after updating XPrivacy this issue began. Some of the apps start on boot, so I know for sure. Nothing else changed that moment. So something in the changes seem to have caused these crashes. \n. Just realized something:\nI am not in AOSP mode any more:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/issues/2213\nMaybe that is the reason why the behaviour of these functions changed for me?\n. OK I found the source of the issue. I it is indeed the swap to compatibility mode that I hadn't been realizing since yesterday. \nThe problem is that strangely the templates between the two modes are completely different, even for the same function names:\nIn compatibility mode the mentioned functions are checked. \nhttps://goo.gl/photos/n8FrDGCRaVvsdQAu5\nIn AOSP mode the these functions are disabled. \nhttps://goo.gl/photos/b2zTqHSu7Zgnqt3e6\nAfter updating XPrivacy from version 2 to 3 back then, I probably did not realize that there were these changes made to the template. \nSo when XPrivacy switched to compatibility mode after updating it lately, I also didn't realized these functions hadn't been checked so far and thus suddenly some apps complain. \nIs there a way to synchronize the templates and the app entries between the modes? I guess the manual way is quite tedious. \nHowever, the whole premise still exists and it really would make sense to return the own packages, tasks and services for these functions. \n. @M66B : \nI did, that's why I told you I am on KitKat. The changelog states:\n\nVersion 3.6.8 UNSUPPORTED:\nRunning in compatibility mode on Lollipop\n...\nVersion 3.6.14 BETA\nRunning XPrivacy in compatibility mode on Android 5.x, except for stock ROMs (issue)\n...\nVersion 3.6.16 BETA\n/data/system/xprivacy/aosp\nThis file can be created/deleted by toggling the main setting AOSP mode\n\nSo what exactly do you mean?\nAlso there is this AOSP override in XPrivacy.java:\njava\n    // AOSP mode override\n    if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.KITKAT && !selinux)\n        try {\n            ...\n            boolean aosp = new File(\"/data/system/xprivacy/aosp\").exists();\n            setenv.invoke(os, \"XPrivacy.AOSP\", Boolean.toString(aosp), false);\n            Util.log(null, Log.WARN, \"AOSP mode forced=\" + aosp);\n        } catch (Throwable ex) {\n            Util.bug(null, ex);\n        }\n.

This happens in every app which shows user pictures/avatars which you have set in androids default 'People' app com.android.contacts. \nHow to reproduce:\n1. set an avatar for a contact you have in com.android.contacts\n2. restrict the category 'Contacts' completely for the default messaging app com.android.mms\n3. allow the contact you used in 1. for the messaging app com.android.mms\n4. open the messaging app and press the new message button and now press the '+' sign next to the receiver field to add receivers. Now you can see all your contacts you allowed for the messaging app with small avatars on the left. Although the contacts are allowed one can not see the real avatar in the small version. If you press on an avatar the big version of it will come up, which is now the real avatar you set in 1. (Small avatar is not shown, big one is shown when pressing on the small one)\nThis can alternatively be made with any app that uses those small avatars.\n. I can tell you that. It is contacts/contacts in the category Contacts.\n. No, you can set all other restrictions in the contacts category as long as contacts/contacts is not restricted the avatars are shown.\nAnd also if all others are not restricted and contacts/contacts is, then the avatars are not shown.\n.

Unfortunately, after a few seconds (15-20?) the phone had boot loops again. After that, it was back to boot loops forever (barely getting to the lock screen before it would reboot itself).\nI tried uninstalling XPrivacy, reboot phone, install XPrivacy, reboot phone but it went into boot loops again.\nI have piles and piles of logs (with time stamps of when boot loops happened or when I did installs the second time around). I'm not sure which part would be the most useful to you, if you'd like I can send you the entire log as it is (both attempts generated 12MB of logs, 1.5MB zipped) and give you the time stamps of events as I recorded them (which would help you zoom into the time stamps in the logs).\nI made a Nand backup of my factory reset state so at least I can flip back and forth if I need to.

Yup, that would work for me too.\n. It seems the only way out is to protect the intent with a permission. Together with some very brief documentation about the syntax of the intent I think this could open the door for a third party to create a (probably quite simple) plugin for Tasker (and compatible apps) with that permission in it's manifest. (A bit like secure settings has additional permissions over standard Tasker.)\nOn the one hand this would provide protection to the Intent in XPrivacy, but on the other hand it gets around the issue that the Tasker devs have ruled out adding an XPrivacy specific permission to their own manifest.\n. I just checked and the plugin is a completely separate app from the automation app. In particular the plugin can request it's own permissions.\nMore info at:   http://tasker.dinglisch.net/plugins-intro.html\nThe small helper app idea would be cool too. Maybe more so really as it is actually a more general solution. In particular Tasker can launch any app (or even a particular activity with-in an app) as an actions so we'd end up with the desired capability.\n. One thing that just came to mind: maybe the helper app could also be set up in such a way that it can only be run by root. Of course it's not a complete fix but it should help. After all, given root an attacker can anyway change the DB (not to mention simply uninstall XPrivacy) which would be a much bigger attack then reloading cache. On the other hand Tasker can perform root operations so it would still allow the desired automation functionality.\n. no problem. :-)\nOn a related note I have question you might be able to help me with...\nI'm trying to get SQL control of XPrivacy via command line working but \nam having some difficulties. The changes I make in the xprivacy.db (via \nsqlite3) don't seem to take effect. Do you have a working example for \nsay restricting a category (say internet) for a particular and an \nexample for removing such a restriction?\nI tried:\nsqlite3 /data/system/xprivacy/xprivacy.db \"INSERT INTO restriction VALUE \n('10105', 'internet', '', '3')\nsqlite3 /data/system/xprivacy/xprivacy.db \"DELETE FROM restriction WHERE \nuid='10105' AND restriction='internet' and method=''\nIn the later case the command does remove the entry from the DB as I had \nexpected but somehow the app still doesn't have access to the internet. \nIt DOES get access if I then open the XPrivacy app and say enable then \ndisable some other category...\nWhat am I missing here? Do i maybe have to trigger xprivacy to re-read \nthe DB once I make a change?\nCheers,\n-joel\nOn 05/23/2014 02:46 PM, an0n981 wrote:\n\ncan't believe I missed that.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/pull/1681#issuecomment-44004326.\n. I've noticed what I think is a discrepancy in the DATABASE.md file and what I'm observing from my local XPrivacy installation.\n\nIn a nutshell I think entries for a category restriction (i.e. method='') for which the category and all it's methods are both permitted and have on-demand set are simply removed from the SQL db rather then have an entry for the category with restriction='0'.\nMore specifically I have the following behaviour in my XPrivacy installation (version 2.0.27). Suppose I have an app with uid='10101' installed and it has no restriction but the on-demand flag set for the category internet and for all methods in internet. Then, as root, I run the command \"sqlite3 /data/system/xprivacy.db \"select * from restriction where uid='10101' and method=''\". Now the DATABASE.md document implies the output should now include a line as follows:\n10101|internet||0\nHowever I do not get such output. More generally I am never able to see any entry of the form:\n|||0\nin the DB for any uid or category when it and all it's methods are not restricted but have on-demand set. Note: if a category C is permitted and on-demand but one of it's methods M was say previously permitted but on-demand when C was partially restricted, then even after permitting C the 10101|C||0 entry will be in the DB. However in this case there will also be a 10101|C|M|1 entry in the DB. \nSo to reproduce the behaviour:\n1) Set a category to restricted and on demand. \n2) Set all methods in category to restricted & on-demand.\n3) Un-restrict the category.\n4) Run SQL command to see DB.\nIt seems to me that rather then place 0 in the restricted field of such categories XPrivacy simply omits the corresponding entry from the DB. In particular an UPDATE sql command will fail in this event as an INSERT is needed.\nCan anyone confirm this behaviour? If not what am I missing here? If so maybe DATABASE.md should be changed to reflect this behaviour. Or alternatively is this to be considered a bug in XPrivacy? Either way it seems the Documentation and Code are inconstant.\nAnother less important small comment on the documentation. I find the \"Meaning\" column in the description of the restriction tables both for Category and Method to be pretty unclear. In particular I think it needs to be clearer which rows correspond to \"not ask\" and which are \"ask\". (The Type column does a good job; my comment refers only to the Meaning column.)\n. For my scripts I'm ok with it as is. I plan on doing the following:\nTo allow say uid 10101 unfettered access to location do:\n1) DELETE FROM restriction WHERE uid='10101' AND restriction='location'\n2) INSERT INTO restriction VALUE ('10101','location','','2')\n3) Flush Cache\nTo restrict uid 10101 all access to location do:\n1) DELETE FROM restriction WHERE uid='10101' AND restriction='location'\n2) INSERT INTO restriction VALUE ('10101','location','','3')\n3) Flush Cache\nI think that should work regardless of the initial state of the DB.\n. oops. did i make a mistake? how is it incorrect?\n.

The equivalent for calendar makes no sense, anyway.\nAccount restriction is ok for the generic meaning of account (an account means \"you are allowed to do X\", if you can't see account you can't guess the ability to do X and the way do do X) but android let an app see two account capabilities (calendar and contacts) even if you can't see the account that permits you to do so, because it offers you a view on the \"aggregate\".\nAs Cerberus-tm says it is possible to use multiple profiles (which I must investigate further), but I think it is a really radical choose that is not practical for all peoples, IMHO.\nI hope I had been clear :-)\nPS: sorry for my english: i'm used to read but not to write...\n.

It's making my phone unusable as launching something after an update fills the screen with unnecessary notifications.\nAdditionally, there's a risk of information leakage, as the default setting of \"apply to all in category\" means I now only have to mis-tap to enable a permission which was previously explicitly denied in my template (ie the ability to read my phone number). \nPlease could you add an option to leave on-demand restricting unchanged after an update? I'm fine with it not being the default, but otherwise I'll have to roll back to a version from before this change was added...\nThanks\n. Pretty much anything, it seems. Location, Media, Phone, Storage and Accounts are some of the ones I remember.\nI'm running 2.1.6, BTW \u2014 should have mentioned that.\n. Ah, I had Xposed set to only show stable releases. I'll give that a try (but will now have to wait for more apps to get updated :)\nThanks\n. Yes, 2.1.26 fixes this. Sorry for the spam.\n. ",

I want to create a task that enables or disables internet access for an app which doesn't have built-in feature...\n. No this application doesn't receive any intent, so the only way I found is blocking internet access via xprivacy.\n. Ok so I won't have any workaround...\n. Thanks the FileName:/sdcard/test.xml works. Anyway, sorry to bother you, but what is the goal of the IMPORT intent if we can't specify a file ?\n. @an0n981 I have an app that permanently connects to internet, and drains battery. I'd like to automatically enable or disable its internet permission. I thought it could be possible with Tasker + XPrivacy, but it won't work if I can't specify an import file.\n.

    "dandv": "I'm talking about the pop-up - that's the area that first hits the new user:\n\nTried tapping the book+shield icon there to no avail. You must be talking about the list of permissions as displayed by XPrivacy. There, it's unclear exactly what the mapping is between, say, getSubscriberId, and the properties under Identification (device).\nIMO the most useful help would be available right where the user encounters the permission request, in the popup.\n. Thanks for the quick response and the enhancement. I've been programming since the 90's but I'm new to Android development and some of the permissions are rather cryptic. For instance, the link to /proc would be probably overkill for many users concerned with privacy, but who are not Linux devs.\nAlso, tapping the function help link opens the permission in the browser behind the on demand dialog, so the user cannot effectively make an informed decision by the time the 15-second timeout runs out.\nIs there a mechanism to contribute more targeted explanations for permissions, and have them displayed right in the on demand dialog? Perhaps sourcing them from the XDA forum? (Example: /proc/meminfo - the link to it requires a bunch of scrolling, then comprehending the information. Now way that could be done in 15 seconds even if the browser window opened in front of the on demand dialog).\n. I'm not confused about \"Restart required\". What I'm saying is that XPrivacy should display a clearer message instead of \"Restart required\", such as \"Please restart $appName for settings to take effect\".\n. After using Xprivacy for the past days, I think the friendliest option would be to offer to restart the app, since XPrivacy can already Kill and Launch apps via a context menu.\n. Same for the proc/self/comm permission.\n. Again, sigh.\nThis is not a question, it's a bug. The README is wrong.\n. Thanks for the attitude.\n. My only filter is for user applications, and I still get the same behavior as in the screenshot. I've posted on the forum as you suggested\nIn my opinion, far fewer users running into the issues I'm filing will bother to search that XDA thread of over 1000 pages, let alone read it (plus, XDA's search is worse than GitHub's, and it has to weed through far more irrelevant chatter in that thread alone). My UX background makes me believe they'll first try the in-app help (where the checkmark, for instance, isn't listed along with the other icons), then they might refer to the README on GitHub. Since you appreciate contributions to the documentation, I thought I'd be helpful by pointing out things beyond typos, that I don't quite know how to fix myself.\n. That's a slippery slope argument... I've personally found the icons confusing, as detailed in the XDA forum. Plus the entire list is based on the negative premise of restricting, thus requiring extra cognitive load on the part of the user.\nA usabilityhub test could settle the debate.\n. ",
    "chdft": "I ran into this issue today and would like to suggest the following workaround:\nXPrivacy does monitor app installations and sets restrictions based on a template for newly installed apps (see https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/aa5d9d5c697b4dfe5cb01986d48cf5881a46c200/src/biz/bokhorst/xprivacy/PackageChange.java around line 47). As far as I can tell, it should be possible to compare the package name (which is known and saved in \"packageName\" in line 39) of the newly installed application to a specific package name specified some preference (before applying the template) and disable all restrictions if it matches.\n.

If anything, the lags when editing a post are longer than before. \n. Yes, probably. The issue still persists though. \n. Well, it seems to point to at least a conflict with XPrivacy, being that the issue only occurs when XPrivacy is activated. \nAnyway, thanks for spending time on this. \nHere's another logcat with some warnings from XPrivacy V2.2.3 - https://gist.github.com/ad1ce5b10f74decf3ae3\n.

Maybe someone else having the issue can confirm. \nHope this info helps. It's getting late here, so I'll leave it for tonight now. :-)\n. So, good news. I installed V2.2.4 and the lags in Tapatalk are gone. :-)\nI did not have to use the \"nojavaipc\" quirk.

    "blurmonk": "@M66B\nThe mac addr is not visible normally when you login to some public wifis. Unfortunately I cannot name you (due to privacy), however some commercial free public wifis (ones that you get from cafes, our airports etc) will pull the mac addr and you will be able to see the mac in the url bar as part of the login process to the free wifi. And I always see my real mac addr there. \nI am not sure if I have to set other things to obfuscate it properly. I will try to get you the actual line next time around one of these wireless access points.\nthanks\n. @M66B \nThanks I see. This is a tablet btw it is not a phone.  I just want to make sure that we are on the same page as far as \"external\" goes. The mac address is the device`s mac addr.  \nSo basically the free wifi provider is able to get the mac addr because it is asking android to get the real mac addr(since I am signing into the free wifi through the browser) ?  And limiting system services does not help with masking?\nDoes that mean that the free wifi provider is able to fetch unmasked true mac addr when I sign to their wifi, and then they serve that wifi back to the browser url thjrough some kind of cookie and identifier?\nthanks\n. Well that is what I read, and I still cant see the download. Maybe I am totally stupid to not to see an obvious thing there. \nI also updated xprivacy but even enabled the experimental branches ( i have 2.2.12). I am not seeing there. That is why I was trying to find a download. Maybe because I installed xprivacy with manual apk\nIs there a download or not ? ;)\n. m66B it does not work for me. I used update both from xposed and xprivacy. Neither of them giving me 2.99xx update.\nI will try it later again\nthanks\n. Got it working properly. I had to restart. Thanks for the help\n. Thanks for the heads up. \n. ",

I wasn't able to contact the rom developer so I posted here. thanks for the reply I confirmed that the problem isn't on your side but the rom itself is missing quite a few android components that has been ripped for smaller rom size.

Hi,\nWell, as i wrote on xda: the first time another app wants access there is no problem. I did this on 3 different roms (c-rom, gummy and spirit)\n- block location for zello\n- use location in zello\n- wait for 1-2 minute and use other app > it will probably get tracking\n- close other app and wait for 1-2 minutes\n- open other app and let it access location > no tracking anymore\nYou can use any other app (mine were not blocked in any way by XP. I used 2 navi packages and gps status).\nThe time between tries is important. That went wrong the first time i wanted to mke a log. 20 seconds is too short. It seems it takes a while for location to put completely off.\nSince this topic is closed please let me know if such logcat is still needed. Then i will try later on again. Np for me since location can be disabled in zello. The problem is gone if i do so.\n. Hi,\nWell..... i never thought it was a bug in XP anyway. That's why my post on XDA was also FYI.\n. Unsupported version is reporting data usage on GT-9205 with Temasek CM12. (it worked before with 3.6.6-1). This kernel is permissive.\n.

The \"WA\" group was added by me, that is some exchange contacts were put in a group called \"WA\". These are in fact the ones that I allowed on the whitelist, and the whatsapp list is still empty...\n. Thanks! Using the \"All\" group actually helped and did the job. \nBut it also means that a very convenient way to choose allowed contacts, that is by MS Exchange group (which can be comfortably defined on a PC, not on a small screen), did not work... So the same contacts work if chosen from the \"All\" group, but not if chosen from the MS Exchange group called \"WA\"\n. Thanks! That's too bad.\nAnyway it works if contacts are selected from \"All\"\nJust to make it clear, in case there was a misunderstanding: in Exchange it is possible to define multiple groups and any Exchange contact can be in none, many, or all Exchange groups. I don't know if and how this translates to contact groups in Android. These groups all show up in the selection dialog in xprivacy (when whitelisting) along with the exchange account name. But, in whatsapp, only contacts selected from \"All\" show up in the whatsapp contact list. Those selected from another group (they are by definition the same contacts as in \"All\") do not show up. \n. ",

    "J316": "That's was my idea when I opened the issue. Good job, and thank you. :) \n. I wish I could! \n. AppOps is integrated into the ROM, it can't be disabled, but nothing is restricted, in fact this is the very first time I'm having this problem, but AppOps has always been there. Also I'm sorry but I can't recognize the line of the problem in the logcat, but that logcat started 2 seconds before I killed an app and recorded what happened during the time the UI restarted, after the phone was functional I terminated the logcat, so it should be the minimum.\n. It looks like the problem suddenly disappeared for I don't know what reason. Oh, well, whatever\n. \nThis shows exactly what I described, I called the number 000000 for testing purpose, only one app was restricted, but all the apps processed after that were fed with those defaced data.\n. AOSP\n. It looks like the same applies for contacts, in particular I get empty contact list in Viber app, like I have no contacts saved at all\n. It works, at least for outgoing calls, I didn't try for incoming calls. Now the restricted apps are not fed with fake data but with empty data\n. Will be possible in the future to keep feeding apps with fake data? \n. Doesn't work for system apps either, but only for accounts and apps. IPs are ok\n. Looks like it's gone\n. No, I don't mean that. You can allow/deny for 15 seconds, 1 minute, etc. But if you want to permanently allow/deny you uncheck the timed restriction. But if an on demand pop up shows while screen off or while not watching the display it will automatically allow/deby permanently without knowledge. So it would be useful if the next pop up will be set on 15 seconds anyway, even if the previous was unchecked. Or rather set on a template specified in settings. Not the template for the restrictions, but for the on demand pop up. \n. \nYou see the third checkmark \"once for\"? If I uncheck it then that restriction will be permanent, next time I won't be prompted. But the next pop up will have it unchecked too, so if it runs out of time I end up with a permanent allowed or denied restriction without knowing it. That's why the next pop up should have \"once for\" checked by default. I was thinking about a template for this pop up too. \n. If it's not \"once for\" it's \"once\", meaning the question mark disappears from the app settings and next time it will be allowed/denied.\n. Give it a try by yourself and you will understand clearly.\n. It's not a bug, it's a not so smart working way. It's an enhancement I'm proposing \n. Marcel didn't understand what I said \n. ",

So both 2ed-party and 3rd-party knows some kind of user data.\n2,xxxPUSH is not necessary defined by the user, thus user disable the service component xxxPushService.\n3,xxxPUSH library has the ability to detect \"2\", and then re-enable the xxxPushService service component, in order to keep on tracking.\n4,even though xxxPUSH shares the same fake device ID with the app, however, different apps may use xxxPUSH's service at the same time, then the \"fake device ID\" would make no sense. the xxxPUSH would go on staying at user's device since there is little possibility that all of these apps are uninstalled.\n5,This sharing \"vendor ID\" technique(eg.. by storing UUID to keychain, the values is not changed if app is uninstalled) is used in iOS ecosystem to avoid apple's forbid of using unique Device ID(UDID/MAC/MEID/IMEI...etc), and is available in Android too.   \nIf xxxPushService was not able to revive, then only the 2ed-party would have access to user data, while the 3rd-party would never be able to get anything useful.\n\nI'm not sure whether \"privacy is not something that is optional\" works everywhere, however we do the \"wiping out 3rd-party trackers\"  within browsers, and it is very effective:\nThe well known privacy-concern browser extensions adblock plus/ghostery/HTTP switchboard/DoNotTrackMe eliminate 3rd-party tracking beacons(javascript, 1*1 pixel gif...etc)\nBy using comprehensive tricks(eg. redirect ssl.google-analytics.com to 127.0.0.1 in /etc/hosts in mobile devices) along with the browser extensions, I am somehow immune to Google's ad system.

I presume it has to do about the youtube app wanting to access some server, an account or what have you and it doesn't get a respond fast enough due to a restriction, but here comes the kicker, even when having all restrictions cleared and the slider in the turned off setting it still behaves like this. In other words, it seems some restrictions do not get cleared or disabled.\nI am not sure your advice letting me having go a crash course in debugging apps to figure out how to get the right logs out of an android is the better way to go, compared to you maybe  having another go thinking what in the code might create this restriction, might be the most optimal solution. But I believe it has to do with youtube trying to reach some (add?) server or account/property locally without success.\nAll I did was downloading the latest XPrivacy restrictions for youtube and it went sour from there. Since then I have tried to remove the restrictions by clearing them, and also turn it all of, without success... \n. I belive the best bet would still be to ask you what your code is or is not doing. To give some food for thought, I uninstalled your app, and low and behold, youtube worked again :-) \nBut, that's not really what we want do we? When starting the youtube clip I noticed what I presume is the culprit to it all. Nowadays youtube wants to you show adds before giving you the clip you want to watch, and this your app seems to restrict somehow (which in a sence is a good thing), but as soon as the app notices it cannot reach the add server it will give you the error.\nI presume to get passed this problem one would need to somehow provide the youtube app with some fake add server which delivers like 0 sec long adverticement, or similar...\n. well that makes us two, but I do like your app (thats why I happily payed twice for it) and I know that a lot of other people DO use youtube, hence I believe its benificial for all to figure this one out. As the more who can use this app (pro version) the more you earn, the more you can contribute to the cause.\nNow to my latest findings (sorry no logs..) after reinstalling the app, youtube did work, but after toggling the on of switch in XPrivacy for youtube it stopped working again (or... you will have to bombard it with touching until it plays) Clearly noticable is the app is not able to get to the advertisement server.\nso... what do you think might restrict access to an adserver? :-) \n.

Didn't tried beta, though.\nAnd of course I'm using PRO, couldn't just use such a great tool and give nothing in return\n. Thanks for pointing to the sources, but I suppose it wouldn't be so simple as just adding /data/data check into relevant condition to get production-quality implementation, and I'm not a java/android dev unfortunately.\nsignificant performance impact - do you mean globally, for all apps? Is it due to /data/data being \"system location\" (mean almost all apps using it, and so very frequent access) and isRestrictedExtra() cost?\n. Thanks for detailed explanation. Of course, hardcoding anything specific is definitely a no-go.\nMay be it would be possible to introduce a list of user definable locations-to-restrict, and make it available in that context via something fast, i.e SHM? So any hard work will be done only if fileName.startsWith() one of those locations.\n. Why don't make a UI for that then? On separate view accesible via menu entry, for instance.\nAnyway, having a feature, even if it is not very convinient or easy to use, is always better that not having at all)\n. If so, I think it would be better to forget about this change. Performance is much more important here, especially as it is directly linked to battery burden, and this request is not about privacy leak, just preventing storage cluttering. \nThe initial goal still can be achieved in most cases via setting FS perms manually in console/file manager, so fell free to close this feature request as wontfix.\nBtw, doesn't contains() much more expensive than startsWith(), as it traverses the whole string instead of failing on first mismatching char?\n. As other users may want this too, this feature could be left as optional, but common code paths should be as efficient, as possible.\nIf I understand the code correctly, it reads config file only once, as mListOpen declared static. But if the list is empty, the code\nFile folders = new File(\"/data/system/xprivacy/open\");\nif (folders.exists() && folders.canRead())\nwill be executed each time, and so each time we got at least one stat() syscall. There should be static boolean (or another way) to hold the fact the config was already attempted to read, so code above would be executed only once.\nThen, another static boolean could be introduced to indicate that mListOpen is non-empty, so\nelse if (fileName.startsWith(\"/data/\")) would change to something like else if (fileName.startsWith(\"/data/\") && mListOpenHasEntries). May be not necessary, don't know whether for loop has any overhead in java\nThat way the feature should have almost no impact when not in use, but still be there for those who really want it despite performance hit. A reboot will probably be required for config changes to take effect, but I see no problem here, as such changes should be pretty rare.\n. ",

Disabling the TextSecure rules in Xprivacy got it to work very briefly, one message sent, then breaks for the first received message which gets stuck decrypting.\nIf I disable xprivacy module in xposed installer the messages flow freely.\n. @M66B I still have the same problem if I remove all restrictions but leave the textsecure xprivacy option enabled.  It also only seems to work ones if I disable the textsecure ruleset in xprivacy\nI have also tried importing the community provided restrictions for TextSecure 2.3.2\nThe only way I can get TextSecure to work is disabling the xprivacy module entirely.\n. @M66B I think this is directed at me?\nRemove all restrictions = unchecking everything under TextSecure in XPrivacy.\ndisable the textsecure ruleset in xprivacy = setting the slider  under TextSecure in XPrivacy to off.\n. @M66B ok, so the dumb question is, what is the best way to figure this out?  Sending test messages and looking at the usage data does not throw up anything obvious.\nNot sure if it matters much but the majority of my blocks are now the community supplied ones.\n. @M66B / @an0n981 \n- all restrictions on all aps removed and TexeSecure does work.\n- TextSecure restrictions enabled (from crowd) with out location/srv_listen and phone/srv_listen blocking works\n- TextSecure restrictions enabled (from crowd) withlocation/srv_listen and phone/srv_listen blocking fails.\nNow the frustrating part while I had unrestricted location/srv_listen and phone/srv_listen when this first happened, I think only did the force quit of textsecure to test\n- Import all settings (I know not just half...)  with out location/srv_listen and phone/srv_listen restricted. TextSecure for non encrypted SMS works, have not had chance to test encrypted yet\n. @an0n981 / @M66B \nPush (encrypted sms) however does not work with just those settings. \nI also had to disable blocking of phone/Configuration.MCC, phone/Configuration.MNC and  to receive push messages.   With the first two disabled, TextSecure would get contact updates over push but would crash if you try to send encrypted messages.   With shell/loadLibrary disabled I can receive push messages but not send.  The final piece of the puzzle appears to be internet/NetworkInfo.isConnectedOrConnecting which gets the sending working\nOn a slight aside (is there a better place to ask?).  How does the community rules work if I upload a working rule set does it go to an approval process or will the next person who fetches rules for TextSecure get what I uploaded?\n. @M66B is there a way to \"force\" these changes required for TextSecure, at the moment if I fetch it reverts my changes and breaks TextSecure and you could possible assume anyone else who may rely on the feature\n. @M66B I meant force and update on the crowd sourced rules so location/srv_listen is not enabled thus breaking textsecure for anyone who fetches the rules.\n. @M66B From what I can see there's nothing writable by on http://xprivacy.eu so allowing access to that should be ok. \nFor https://crowd.xprivacy.eu could it be set up so that the Tor range of IP addresses have read access but not write, that way we can fetch crowd sourced lists.\n. @M66B the Tor IP change depending on the exit node but there are a finite amount of exit nodes and are public. https://www.torproject.org/projects/tordnsel.html.en (actively updated list of Tor IP address range - http://torstatus.blutmagie.de/ip_list_exit.php/Tor_ip_list_EXIT.csv for easy import into a read only solution)\nYou set up the web server to just give read only access to anyone connecting with a Tor exit node IP address\nIt'd be similar to how Wikipedia operate, they allow Tor users to access the server and read the contents but not edit.\n. @an0n981 this sounds like what orbot already does.  This thing is some people only want access via Tor so no local data leakage so not an ideal solution :)\n. @an0n981 it sounds like you are saying use IPTables rules on the phone to decide what app routes over tor and which does not, is that not the case?\nAlso as a DDoS measure blocking such attacks that close to the server is going to have little effect, all you have done is move the blocking slightly up the stack instead of further upstream where it is more effective.\n. @M66B I was just basing it off what @an0n981 said\n\nI may be be wrong here, but I believe this was implemented after a DDOS attack,\n\nIf the voting system is so easily abused the problem is not really with Tor it's with the system.  What's to stop me from just spamming the system with hokey rules now?  I assume I can make enough of an impact before my IP address gets blocked (which can be as easily changed with out Tor) and as you've said you don't interfere with the rules so you now have to hope that enough people vote to fix what I did.\nI'll leave it be, I can see it's not going to happen though I can't fathom why a tool that aims to help protect your privacy can't be used with another tool used to protect your privacy, it just seems to be a design flaw.\n.

    "moxie0": "Hey @M66B, I'm a TextSecure developer, and I'd like to help get this issue resolved.  In a recent release, we introduced a JobManager for managing tasks in TextSecure:\nhttps://github.com/WhisperSystems/jobmanager\nThe JobManager works similarly to an Executor, allowing you to queue jobs which are run by a pool of threads.  The jobs can be persistent, though, and also allow you to define \"requirements\" which are treated as prerequisites before a job can run (such as a network connection, etc...).\nWhat we've seen when people have xprivacy installed is that the jobs never run.  At first I thought xprivacy was preventing the jobs from detecting when a requirement like network access was present, but even jobs with no requirements at all never run.  They're enqueued, and then the consumer threads never execute.\nWhen people uninstall xprivacy, it works.  We've not had a single report of someone with this problem who doesn't have xprivacy installed.\nDo you have any insight into why the tasks might not be executed?\n. @M66B Unfortunately I don't have a device capable of running xprivacy.  If you could introspect TextSecure on a device with xprivacy installed, I'm sure a bunch of users would be grateful.\n. Hey @M66B you can just try sending an SMS to any device, but I submitted the number for a TS registered device via that form as well. Thanks!\n. @M66B Sounds like it's not reproducible for you.  Some people said that when they uninstalled xprivacy and xposed and then reinstalled it everything worked fine, so maybe there's something subtle happening.\n. Thanks everyone for looking into this.  I hope something with the default rulesets ends up happening so that TextSecure will work by default for people with xprivacy installed.

So I installed on my new phone and I know that it is he who create bugs me because since I removed the phone working again.\nI use hangouts for receiving SMS and not the core application. When I xprivacy, the core application let me all notifications in the taskbar. I fixed this problem by removing the native application.\nIf I let this application and I remove xprivacy, the problem disappears.\nWhen I drive, I put my phone on charge in developer mode, I checked the box so it does not go to sleep when it loads. It is very useful in the car when I start a streaming radio, the phone is on the radio and do not go to sleep. With Xprivacy, the phone goes into standby anyway. As soon as I remove Xprivacy, it stays on.\nI wanted to test candy crush, xprivacy was installed, this game was singing on the first screen (orange screen if you know well that game) and was closing on. Since I no longer xprivacy, I could play it normally starts.\nI said that I had given all rights to candy crush.\nWhen I got a phone call and as soon as I hang up, if I'm not careful, the phone call any contact. Since I do not have Xprivacy I not what worries\nThe rest of the bugs, I do not remember, but if you have a solution for these problems, I will install again with great pleasure\n. ",

On your FAQ page it states: \"Android 5.0.x: XPrivacy will cause a bootloop on some ROMs due to a bug in Xposed\" and also indicates, \"XPrivacy has been tested with Android version 4.0.3 - 5.0.2 (ICS, JellyBean, KitKat, Lollipop) and is reported to work with most Android variants, including stock ROMs.\" I'm a little gun shy as to whether I should pull the trigger to get the S6 if there are known issues with Lollipop. It's evident that the issues users are experiencing are Xposed related. I know this may be too soon to ask, but have you had any reports from S6 users on whether 3.6.8 or 3.6.7 is working for them on the stock ROM? (I know there's no ROM's for it yet....just curious if xprivacy plays well with xpose on a stock unaltered S6 device.)

I moved that one hook to a new hook() method, this is executed from zygote on all versions, which means that on pre-lollipop it will work as it has always done since both hookAll(null) and hookAll() is executed right after one another. \n. It's the same as here, only with an underscore at the beginning (Github does not support that), so \"dk_zero-cool\". \n. Thanks, but I don't really use this at the moment, I don't need it as I am very strickt about what I install on my devices. I just followed the thread and got tired of the people that does not know how much time these things can take from the people working on it, and you seamed like you did not have that time currently. Since I like a challenge and had the time to spend, I thought that I would lend a hand.\n. Yes it requires a lot of rebooting, recovery shell to disable the module each time and so on. Just a quick note, if you have anything in your module that adds hooks to native methods, those features will not currently work on Lollipop. The Lollipop versions of Xposed does not allow hooks on native methods, not sure why, but Rovo has disabled it until he has time to test it properly. Just a good idea to mention this on the thread if you have such features. \n. Let's just hope this works for everyone. There are many different devices with many different Android code bases. \n. First test with 5.0 was positive. Blocking getDeviceId() did indeed block me from getting the device id in my Debugger app. I will test the mentioned applications, if they do get a valid id, they use a different approach. \nEDIT:\nThe Device ID app uses the following\n1. GservicesProvider\n2. SERIAL  \nXPrivacy does popup requesting permission to access the device id, but even if I press deny, the app get's the correct value. \n. Marcel here is the status of this issue. \n1. I restrict the Device ID app to request permission when reading the device ID from GServiceProvider\n2. I press deny in the popup when launching the Device ID app, but the app still get's the ID\n3. I open XPrivacy again, reset it to request permission\n4. I press deny in the popup when launching the Device ID app, the ID is now hidden. It will continue to work until I reboot the device. It seams more likely that this is a configuration problem\n. what xposed version do you use?\n. Makes no sense, I use the same Xposed version, CM 12 (5.0.2) with latest commits of XPrivacy.\nBut looking at what I experience might fix it for both. I did still have the same problem after each boot.\n. https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/commit/200967dcf16cd3a72645c8668baec9ed83a0a7b7\nThe fix you made for extended classes breaks all ROM's since no version exists where mContext is declared public\n. With the changes I made, the AM instance is now parsed to the service in all Android versions and all of them contains the \"mContext\" property, which is one of the few things that Google keeps consistent across the OS.\n. Yes I was not sure how you wanted this, there are many ways to make it, but a simple argument seamed fine. And later a found a few of your own hooks with a similar argument, so I stuck with it.\n. Yes, I did not see that you had a few hooks with a similar argument to begin with. \n. I got some errors in logcat about trying to count null array on xparam.args. It might be a small error in the Lollipop Xposed version where the Xposed args array is null. It did not harm I think, other than printing errors once awhile. \n. Okay, it did not harm on my device so I left it enabled. But if it causes problems for some, then... Not really sure what it does anyways, I am guessing that it allows the app to pre-disable features from boot?\n. Yes that was my thought as well. I know that you are using custom classes in the hook files. \n. Maybe I read something wrong in the original file? But it looked to me as the only thing you used \"android\" for, was to add a hook in AM for Lollipop? If not, then my bad :)\n. I will not bet my life on it, as I can only test AOSP. I would just have thought so, since Zygote is running as outer root, but then again, you can never know with SELinux. \n. Ups, missed one :s\n. ",

When we set a precise location and altitude, Xprivacy does not abide to the location and jumps around several km, as well as varies the altitude by over 10km in a matter of one second. From what I've read XPrivacy shall only infer the error range from the actual location data, not randomly vary the positioning. \nI understand if you want to reproduce natural movements, but jumping around several km, deep in the earth core and above the clouds in a matter of seconds is not plausibly natural, and shall be defined as bug in my humble opinion. Thank you for reconsidering the tag.\n. ",

I was wondering that no one else has this problem. That's why i was signing to github and writing this \"issue\".\nYes, i'am very sure.

    "7astro": "True, my bad\n. by \"manually\" I mean putting a check/question mark for every single function. I do understand how restriction work on category basis, that's why I said it is to be an ok behaviour. I tested it on Elixir for Shell while accessing logcat\n. the main point is here dangerous/red functions which are NOT \"internally white-listed\" for on-demand restrictions. And by internally white-listed I mean the red ones that get question mark applied, when one applies an on-demand restriction for a whole category\n. Thats right, but I know it. Please look through this example: \n- Use default templates ( no changes made )\n- Apply default template to Elixir\n- Restrict all functions in Elixir in category Shell (permanently and on-demand)\n- Open Elixir (deny Identification category/ allow view category) and go to logs\n- On-demand dialogue for Shell(sh) will pop-up, use non-expert mode and deny, no logs will be shown\n- Go to Xprivacy and see that only sh has a permanent restriction intact, others are ALLOWED\n. So I think in the above post, you are implying that the ones who restrict dangerous functions should never use non-expert mode anyway? This point is not well communicated in the FAQ imo. Another problem is the way the subset of dangerous functions is managed - namely globally and for all templates.\n. \"they were allowed and to be asked in the first place, so there wasn't anything changed.\" \nI don't quite get the point. The only \"mistake\", as I see it, was for me to implicitly check the \"apply to entire category\" option, which triggered the novice protection mechanism and cleared the dangerous restrictions. \nThis brings me to another point -  in the expert mode it would be helpful if the \"apply to entire category\" would be unchecked as default. Actually I doubt it does there much help:\n- Individual non-dangerous functions, which you want to be allowed/denied, get overwritten on category deny/allow\n- Dangerous functions are likely to be allowed despite of your category deny decision\n- I suppose category timer will only work on the non-dangerous subset, subset you cannot adjust individually\n- In the case you proposed (with no dangerous functions) I would unlikely want to deny every function in the category by pressing category deny \nBy the way, I value this novice protection mechanism, it is a necessary thing. The reason, why I will unlikely disable dangerous functions, is the on-demand red window that indicates to me that the particular restriction is generally known to cause problems. \n. Screenshot won't capture a screen stutter or a missing \"Text selection\"  mode in usage data view. \nParameters such as IP addresses are generally (pro version) highlightable in usage data view of an app, but if the usage data fills the whole screen it is not possible any more, for me at least. \n. No problem. Here is what I'm trying to accomplish:\n\nNow, in case the list is full of red/grey entries - I cannot do this highlighting any more \n. ",

Is that by design, a bug, or an incorrect understanding?\n. @an0n981 Thanks.  Based on your great feedback and that from @M66B, I updated FAQ 69.  It looks solid now.\n. You're quite welcome.  Glad to help.\nThank you for XPrivacy!\n. You're quite welcome.  Glad to help.\nThank you for XPrivacy!\n. Yes. I'll get on it right away.\n. OK... ready to merge.  I will be able to test it once merged.\nYou can add the screenshots anchor to XDA post 1 if you like.\n. Provided a refinement that is ready to merge.\n. README.md is all good now.\n. That is a good rationale, and I'm glad to hear it was deliberate (and not a bug).\nThere is a significant tradeoff to that design.  Perhaps something could be implemented to mitigate the negatives of that design while keeping the positives.\nMay I propose, in such cases, that XPrivacy evoke a message box asking the user whether they want to enable all 'non-dangerous' functions, or only ones previously enabled?  I think such a solution will eliminate errors (resulting in possible data exposure), while simultaneously satisfying existing users and honoring your original rationale. I think it's a win-win-win.\n. Just FYI, this issue definitely appears when Expert mode is disabled.  (It may also appear when it is enabled.)\n. Lol... I'll take your word for it.  I don't want to risk an export/import failing and having to start over... I have over 20 hours invested in researching restrictions and setting things up.\nYou are correct... I was referring to the actual expert mode setting.\nThe only time a user will see an implicit mode agreement will be the first time they try XPrivacy, and are so confused they have no idea on what they are clicking.  XPrivacy is fairly easy to understand once you get a hang of it, but it has a steep initial learning curve where nothing makes much sense (even after reading the FAQ).  I've had to teach several people how to use it because they were so confused initially.  I liken XPrivacy to riding a bicycle: very scary initially, but a great tool once you are familiar with how to 'ride' it.\n. While developing XPrivacy I have cleared all data so many times that XPrivacy is probably not very useful to me anymore.\nLOL.  Same here.  While setting it up, I changed restricted/allowed permissions so many times that I question whether or not it's really of any value at this point.  And then there was a surprise ROM update that removed root (and thus XPrivacy functionality), which completely opened the door.\nI figure for new apps it will at least help... I just hope it doesn't slow things down... I didn't run metrics before installing it, so I have no idea how much performance impact it is having.\n. M66B and I were just lamenting that after you clear or experiment with restrictions enough times, so much data has passed through that the full benefit of XPrivacy has been compromised.\nXPrivacy is still very useful, even in this situation.  And of course, if you have not gone through these same procedures, it is even more useful.\n. You're welcome!\n. Sounds great.  I tested post 1 just now with the updated readme, and all changes look good.  So it works now, and will still work once you update the post.\n. Glad you like it and appreciate it.  It's always nice to be appreciated! :-)\n. You're welcome!  :)\n. Glad to help.  :)\n. You're welcome!\n. Although it could be a bit confusing, I think I may like the current functionality (assuming I understand it correctly).  With the current functionality, you can blacklist specific sites while still allowing access to all other sites.\nTo make this even more useful, adding the ability to manually enter whitelist/blacklist items would be an excellent enhancement.\n(OTOH, I do agree that it's currently a bit confusing to have anything restricted when the checkbox is not checked... perhaps something similar to the tri-mode checkbox could be used for these situations.)\n. To help everyone, I just added FAQ 82 to the README.  Please verify that I go it right.  See https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/pull/2284\n. Marcel considers this to be a bug in XPrivacy.  See our discussion in #2284.\n. The more I think about it, there are only two desired states:\nState 1: Restricted (with whitelist)\nState 2: Unrestricted (with blacklist)\nIt gets confusing due to how the \"restricted\" and \"on demand\" functionality interact with each other.\nPerhaps a simple fix would be to use a tri-state checkbox just for the \"restricted\" checkbox:\nChecked: Restricted\n      Square: Only restricted by blacklist\n      Unchecked: Not restricted\nThis way, none of the processing code would need to be changed.  Only the UI code would require adjustment to reflect the actual behavior.\n. @Cerberus-tm and @an0n981 I tend to agree with both of you.  (Although I have not flushed out every case.)  Instead of a warning, I propose using the associated checkbox to reflect what is going on.  That way, a visual cue is provided to the user.  Furthermore, no functionality will have to change, thus nothing will break for existing users.\n. @Cerberus-tm You raise excellent issues.  Unfortunately, I am pressed for time right now and thus cannot carefully think about them and respond thoughtfully.\nVery quickly, I am thinking that the restriction checkbox for each function would have a unique appearance (filled square in it, different color, etc.) iff (if and only if) the restriction is not present but a blacklist is being enforced.\nI'm pretty sure that could be implemented in 1-5 lines of code.\n. @Cerberus-tm Simple for me... I'm not the one who will implement it.  ;-)\n. @kaizokan The use of that specific UI element (square check mark) would need to be evaluated for just the reason you mention.  Off the cuff, the meaning is similar enough that it could work (i.e. \"not completely restricted and not completely unrestricted\").\n. So it's a bug in XPrivacy?\n. After using XPrivacy more and more, and increasing my proficiency with it, I would say this is the one enhancement that I would really like to see.  Looking at the code, I think it wouldn't involve large changes.\nThinking about this more, I see four possible implementations:\n1. A global toggle.  This would be the least flexible, and therefore the least desirable, but still would be a significant improvement.\n2. Another per-app quirk mode.  This would add more flexibility.  It would be clumsy to use, but would not require changing the UI at all.\n3. An option in the per-app settings page.  This would add more flexibility, but would require a minor UI addition.\n4. An option for each function for each app.  This would add the most flexibility and would not require changing the outward appearance of the UI at all.  One possible implementation would be to long-click on a restriction, and then ask the user if they want to block toast messages for that restriction.\nAnyways, those are just my ideas.  Others may have better or different ones.\n. @Cerberus-tm Thanks. I have been thinking about trying Enhanced Toast, but people often find that system stability is inversely proportional to the number of Xposed modules installed.  Also, things tend to slow down and bugs get harder and harder to troubleshoot with more modules installed.  That said, thanks for checking it out and verifying that it works.\nEven just a single toggle within XPrivacy to block all XPrivacy toasts would be useful.  There are so many things that I use XPrivacy to restrict that being notified of just some of them doesn't add any value to me (although I certainly understand and agree with Marcel's reasoning for adding them... novices may be otherwise confused).\nActually, it takes away from value because it is amazing how many apps try to do things like read the clipboard _each and every time_ they start.  That's such a privacy violation, but mainstream apps still do it.  IIRC, even Slacker Radio reads the content of your clipboard every time it starts.  Having an XPrivacy toast message pop up every time I start some apps is a bit annoying... certainly not the end of the world or a dealbreaker... just an annoyance.\n. @Cerberus-tm I agree that per-function would probably be overkill (although still useful in some cases).  However, I don't think it would require more visible complexity, because it could just be accessed via long-press on the function.  It would be transparent except for those that read the README.\nAs far as needing to copy code from Enhanced Toast to do any of this, I think it's much simpler.  A simple flag within XPrivacy can be used prevent toasts from being issues.  I think the additional code would be trivial.  I would do it myself, but I've never programmed commercially in that language, and I wouldn't want to mess up such a well-written application.\n@kaizokan Can do.  Or would XMPP be better?  I've been thinking about giving that a try because Marcel recommended it, but I haven't had a chance to fire it up.\n. Due to the hard crash, what can capture the logcat?  It will need to flush the write cache after each logcat line.\n. Sounds good.  If the crash is most likely caused by the restriction, it may not be worth our time to pursue a logcat.\nWhen XPrivacy restricts NetworkInfo.isConnected, what data is provided to the restricted app?\n. This is how it is supposed to work (according to Google).\nThat's odd.  I would love to read the Google reference if you have it handy,\n. Thanks for the reference. I'll read it.\n. I have noticed this issue as well.  I was not sure if it was a lack of understanding on my part, or a bug in XPrivacy.\n. @IzzySoft What I've seen is that sometimes the checkboxes are non-responsive.  I've experienced it on multiple devices, both with expert mode enabled and with it disabled.  Friends have contacted me regarding the issue as well.\nI remember that on one device I was able to enable On Demand for the entire category, and by doing so, all the checkboxes for that category became responsive.\nBecause I was not sure if it was a bug or just a lack of understanding on my part, I didn't pursue it, nor did I try to correlate it with any sequence of events.  Now that I know it's a bug, I'll be more observant as to what sequence of events may cause it.\n. Perhaps it is a UI design issue.  When a category is expanded, selecting the checkbox next to a single function to restrict it seems like a standard task.  I don't think making it depend on whether or not the category is restricted is in line with user-expectations.\n. I would be grateful if you looked through the texts here:\nhttps://github.com/M66B/NetGuard\nYou got it.  Looking at them now.  Do you want help with them, if needed?\n. Editing now...\n. Editing finished.  Pull requests initiated.\nUnfortunately, I won't be able to test the NetGuard APK at this time, as I am not working with any Lollipop or Marshmallow devices.\nLooks great.\n. Every application has these permissions (actually there is no Android permissions at all for this).\nIn regards to this issue, I'm thinking about what is best, and am interested in your thoughts as well.\nOn one hand, since no permission is required to access that functionality (which is an atrocious decision by Google), it is good that XPrivacy indicates that every app has that permission.\nOn the other hand, by indicating that apps have this permission, it looks like apps are intentionally trying to have permission to use the camera, even though they are not.  This effect gets magnified when you use XPrivacy filters or searches, which causes only certain apps to be displayed.  This has fooled me, resulting in spending time going through source code line-by-line to see why an app is using the camera... only to discover that it is not.\nWhat are your thoughts?\n. Yes, this is a tricky case.  Would you like me to add an item to the FAQ regarding this idiosyncrasy?\n. Will do.  Busy now, but on my near-term list to complete that task.\nI also noticed that XPrivacy indicates every app has permissions for at least one other item (IPC Binder).  I'll include that in the FAQ as well.\n. +1\n. Why hook it at all?  Although not processor-intensive, it adds some overhead to the OS.\n. Thanks.  Perhaps classify this issue as a low priority enhancement request in case someone else wants to code it?\nI see hooks for apps such as SU, Greenify, firewalls, and other sensitive apps (even though XPrivacy is disabled for them).  No problems, but want to keep everything running smoothly.  :-)\n. No.  Does the GitHub web interface have a search/find feature for actual code?  It has a great search feature for finding repos, but I do not see one for searching within code.  I feel like I must be staring right at it, but I don't see anything.\n. It seems to do more than that (or perhaps there is a bug).  When I click it when apps try to access the contacts/data function, it behaves differently than clicking either Allow or Deny.\nClicking Allow always allows access to all contacts (the whitelist is ignored).  Clicking Deny always denies access to all contacts.  Clicking Don't know only allows access to contacts in the whitelist.\n. Then I think there is a bug.  Because what you describe is not what XPrivacy actually does!\n. Was doing it as you were typing. :-)\nAny ideas why this is what I witness?: For the contacts/data function, clicking Allow always allows access to all contacts (the whitelist is ignored). Clicking Deny always denies access to all contacts. Clicking Don't know only allows access to contacts in the whitelist.\n. Since contacts/data is not a dangerous function, Don't know should deny it.  But it is allowing all contacts in the whitelist.  To the contrary, Deny does not allow contacts in the whitelist.\n. Marcel, I owe you an apology.  I'm sorry.  I made an error.  I'm not sure how it happened.  Clicking Deny does allow the whitelist items.  I checked several times and I thought it did not.  Either I was dealing with a caching issue, or I just flat out made a mistake.  I'm so very sorry I wasted your time on that.\nI'll write up one or two new items for the README and submit a pull request.  Again, I'm very sorry for my error.\n. The same issue can be seen when you select individual contacts within a group.  It's not just when selecting All for a group.\nIn theory, allowing contacts for one or more groups would be ideal.  That way people can maintain a group of contacts that they are okay sharing with different apps.\n. No problem... perhaps someone else will be interested in tweaking it to get it to work in all cases.  All the design and UI seems to be there... it's just not working (at least not with offline contacts).\nI totally understand and respect that you don't want to play with it.  No problem at all. The more I learn about Android, the more I understand the complexities involved.\n. When XPrivacy loads, it displays a progress bar.  Displaying the progress bar can take anywhere from 1 second to 80 seconds (or longer, but 80 is the longest I've timed), depending on the speed of the device and how many rules are in place.  When contacts are whitelisted/blacklisted, thousands of additional rules are often created (as seen in an export).  Does this impact the time it takes for XPrivacy to get through that progress bar?\nWhat about memory usage?\nAlso, even when All is selected, when new contacts are created, they will not be added to the whitelist.  The only way to get rid of that whitelist is to delete all XPrivacy settings for the app.\n. Interesting.  So the XPrivacy progress bar is just the time it takes to load contacts?  If so, would it be possible to only load contacts if the user tries to use the contacts whitelist.  Although I love XPrivacy, waiting for that progress bar gets tiresome and interferes with workflow.\n. Okay, yes, that was my understanding.  I've taken a close look at the XPrivacy exports.  Once you study them as I have, the progress bar certainly makes sense.\nSo I think the enhancement request is based on memory usage, export file size, and the ability to add new contacts without them being automatically blacklisted.  Having the ability to delete the whitelist will resolve those 3 issues.\n. :-)\n. You're welcome!\n. It's certainly the first time I've noticed anything unusual like this with XPrivacy.\nI tested it a half-dozen times, and it had the same issue each time.  But I was pressed for time, and I don't think I allowed a full 15 seconds for caching.  That could well be the issue.\nBTW, what do you mean by \"Did you allow a function with specific paramters?\"  Do you mean functions like proc?  If so, yes,  Why does it matter?\n. Right. Except this item was whitelisted, but still restricted.  In hundreds of apps that I've closely analyzed and monitored with the XPrivacy Usage Data logs, I've never seen this happen before.  That's why I kept repeating the test, and it kept doing it again and again.\nNow that I think of it, I don't think the caching requirement is the issue.  If a URL is whitelisted for a function, and the app calls it again right after it is whitelisted, it should still be unrestricted, right?\n. BTW, here is the app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mkisly.corners.mini\nAlthough it's an enjoyable and well-written little game, it's not an essential app (I already deleted it).\nBut I mention it if it can be used to demonstrate an issue with XPrivacy.\nI may not have time to post here for a number of days, so I thought it best to add this info.\n. +1 For improvements to the white/blacklist functionality.\nI think just a couple more default selection would be a huge improvement.\nFor example, when a URL is requested by an app, allow whitelisting/blacklisting that entire URL on any port.\nAs a specific example, if an app requests foo.facebook.com/bar, allow instantly creating a white/blacklist item to restrict/allow .facebook.com on any port with any protocol.\n. +1\n. +1 For the overall issue.\nI'm not sure whether or not individual xml files is the solution to the problem (it may be, though), but the actual issue is worth exploring.\n. @MartinS84 Maybe you can add your info to the FAQ in the README?\n. I agree that having a way to automatically allow certain items that don't have any real privacy issues would improve XPrivacy.\nAs another example, almost every app with internet access will make a query to check for IPv6.  This results in an extra item that has to be approved the first time most apps makes an internet connection; there is currently no way to automatically whitelist these types of items in expert mode.\n. @codecrak I always find it interesting how digital technology can seem to break itself or fix itself.  Since it's digital, that shouldn't happen.  Obviously, something has to change, perhaps a race condition or a hardware timing issue.  Unfortunately, it's rare for people to have the time to perform a full trace to determine exactly what happened.\n. +1\nI don't think there is currently a way to do this, but I would like that functionality as well.\n. +1\n. +1\n. @M66B If you like, I can update the FAQ with the minimum Xposed version required.  Just let me know what it is, and if it differs for each version of Android, and I'll update the FAQ accordingly for you.\n. Yes, hopefully someday there will be a simple repo with the latest stable version of Xposed for each Android release.  For people not familiar with the framework, it must be very confusing.\n. +1\nTo my understanding, your understand is correct. :-)\n. @T-vK I agree with the observations you made in your first post above.\nIn addition to a forum, you can also contribute by adding to the FAQ, Wiki, and README here on GitHub.  I have done it extensively, and Marcel has been helpful with the process.  He also has been appreciative to receive help. :)\nIf you do get the forum up and running, creating a link to it (with a disclaimer that Marcel is not running it) in the Wiki and README will help drive traffic and increase activity.\nBTW, I don't think having a subdomain on xprivacy.eu is essential.  I think it will help, but I don't think it's mandatory.  I think it's great that Marcel is giving you a subdomain, but if you want more control, using your own domain will be fine too.\nI look forward to whatever you decide to do, and I appreciate your enthusiasm and generosity..

I've played a little more with it, so I might provide some additional input:\n- for apps where \"on-demand\" was not enabled before, the issue did not happen when enabling it for them\n- not sure why, but for some apps it was enabled. For those, disabling and re-enabling was required (these might have been apps installed after globally enabling on-demand, but before applying a device-reboot)\n- apps installed after having enabled it globally and rebooting the device seem not to be affected\nWhat I'm not 100% sure about is whether there might have been the \"first reboot after enabling it globally\" only before item number 3 \u2013 so the bug might be \"worked around\" by rebooting right after \"globally enabling on-demand\" and before installing/updating anything new (or, in other words, the bug might be \"this happens when just enabling it globally and then trying to use it directly without a reboot in between\". Can you remember anything towards that, @Gitoffthelawn ?\n. > to use function restrictions, you need to restrict the category first, since the function restrictions are exceptions to the category restriction.\nI'm not 100% sure whether I tried toggling it for a category (but 95% sure I did).

Hi there !\n\nSo I did some tests on my spare time. I did uninstall xposed, wipe dalvik-cache, reboot to let Android rebuild/recompile the cache, use it a little, then reinstall xprivacy (sdk22, v78, arm) and wipe dalvik-cache again, to finally reboot and see the exact same problems... :/\nSince more people start to get the device and play with it, I got some input from XDA and people are also encountering problem with XPrivacy, but not with the other modules (http://forum.xda-developers.com/oneplus-x/general/info-xposed-fine-t3251040/page2)\nI don't really know what could help you investigate at this point?\n. Yep, but from the 3 last line of his logcat, we can see:\ncom.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit$MethodAndArgsCaller.run(ZygoteInit.java:950) [java.lang.BootClassLoader@14a32e1d]\ncom.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.main(ZygoteInit.java:745) [java.lang.BootClassLoader@14a32e1d]\nde.robv.android.xposed.XposedBridge.main(XposedBridge.java:114)\nSo it seems the ZygoteInit (and not InitZygote?) is called no? So the problem should be elsewhere?\n. Ah ok, my bad. That was misleading ;)\n. Your logcat will be more than usefull to @M66B \nThe default ADB driver from the latest Android SDK platform tools is enough for me to recognize the phone.\nBtw, if it's able to show your phone in the devices, it should work.\nIssue \"adb -d logcat > logcat.txt\" in your command prompt, then reboot the phone.\nFew secondes after finished booting to an usable state, you should have your adb file.\nBe sure to \"enter\" few times in the prompt to check if it's done : it seems adb doesn't issue a newline character to give you the prompt back.\n. Aaahh nice, an hint!\nI was thinking that was the AppOps part that was interfering.\nBut something as crucial as the Activity Manager is not standard ?\nStrange/dirty... :o\nLe 24 nov. 2015 1:56 PM, \"Marcel Bokhorst\" notifications@github.com a\n\u00e9crit :\n\nI need the layout (fields and methods) of\ncom.android.server.am.ActivityManagerService.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/issues/2300#issuecomment-159259583.\n. \n",

No, OxygenOS is not opensource unfortunately. If you need anything specific, I'll try to get it.\n. Here is the smali file for ActivityManagerService extracted from oxygenos.

Let me start with the error popup message XPrivacy wants to send:\nPrivacy: 3.6.19\nAndroid: 5.1.1 (SDK 22)\nBrand: OnePlus\nManufacturer: OnePlus\nModel: ONE E1003\nProduct: OnePlus\nDevice: OnePlus\nHost: ubuntu-148\nDisplay: ONE E1003_14_151103\nId: LMY47V\nMethod not found hook=null/inputDispatchingTimedOut (com.android.server.am.ActivityManagerService)\nMethod not found hook=null/systemReady (com.android.server.am.ActivityManagerService)\nMethod not found hook=null/finishBooting (com.android.server.am.ActivityManagerService)\nMethod not found hook=null/shutdown (com.android.server.am.ActivityManagerService)\nMethod not found hook=null/updateSleepIfNeededLocked (com.android.server.am.ActivityManagerService)\n. First, many thanks for XPrivacy. It's for sure the most important App for me. I would be really happy if we could find a solution to make it work. Otherwise this would be a reason to sell this phone. \nI can't provide a boot log. adb didn't detect my device. After start \"adb -d logcat>my.log\" it says \"waiting for device\" but never finds one. If I exit adb and call \"adb devices\" it finds one. I'm sure is this crappy Windows. I must manualy install the driver and it might be the wrong one. I choosed \"Oneplus ADB Interface\"\nAnyway. There is a log under xposed framework app. I checked this one and I found four lines regarding XPrivacy:\n11-22 08:01:16.170 I/Xposed  (  296): Loading modules from /data/app/biz.bokhorst.xprivacy-1/base.apk\n11-22 08:01:16.223 I/Xposed  (  296):   Loading class biz.bokhorst.xprivacy.XPrivacy\n11-22 08:01:16.898 I/Xposed  (  296): Loading modules from /data/app/de.live.gdev.xprivacyappinfo-2/base.apk\n11-22 08:01:16.906 I/Xposed  (  296):   Loading class de.live.gdev.xprivacyappinfo.XPrivacyInAppInfo\nI used a simple App \"DeviceID\" to try restrictions and checked the log found in XPrivacy. Means I opend the App settings in XPrivacy and pressed \"Activity Log\" in Menu. \n\nHope this helps. Let me know if I an do something else. \n. Tried it without success. \nSearched the Internet and found several other reporting this issue. Tried a lot of suggestions I read. No change, still the same. \nSorry can't help. \n.

    "MartinS84": "\nI don't understand this. Why have I to set it separate? Why are globals not enough?\n\nThe global settings don't determine whether the item is restricted or not, but what kind of data is returned.\nRandomize on boot, randomize on access or always return the same value (you can fill it in or generate a random one). This is a bit confusing and took me a while to understand. \nSo if you dont restrict GPS:srv_isProviderenabled it shouldn't be restricted at all.\nIf you restrict it, then the global settings for a random data will be used, unless you have specific settings for the app.\n\nIf I now set the fake data in the settings of this single app, the fake location works.\n\nDid you also restrict GPS:srv_isProviderenabled?\nBecause if you didn't, there shouldn't be a fake location. If you did then the global vs specific settings determine what kind of fake location is returned to the app.\n. I got another idea.\nIn the log files i often see \"original:0123456789\" when a request by an app was restricted. \nSo that means Xprivacy can see the data that would have been returned, had there not been a restriction. \nI think the most sensitive data that users want to protect are probably the IMEI, Serial, android id, etc. these numbers.\nMaybe it would be an option to just scan all of the data that is returned to the app through /proc and /binder for that number, and then intercept the data and replace the number?\nThat way you wouldnt even have to know what is possible with /proc and /binder.\nOf course it could also be that some app crashes because some number returned by chance is identical to your IMEI.

This permission wasn't mandatory in previous versions. However, if you show an alert window in the new MIUI 8 you MUST give the permission.\nIn my case the problem was in a Toast alert. I request this permission and the problem was fixed. I haven't more crashes. It is not a \"give permission to every application\", just request this permission when an alert is shown in MIUI 8.\nIt is just my suggestion. I believe this is the cause. \nAnyway I have installed the MiuiPermissionRemover and the problem is fixed. However it is not a \"clean solution\". I hope you find the solution.\n. ",

    "T-vK": "Holy cow, I just realized something. This feature is already available... sort of. \nEvery time you get a pop up from Xprivacy, you can check the \"Expert Mode\" checkbox. When you enable that, Xprivacy will tell you which folder exactly an app is trying to get access. Then you can simply whitelist/blacklist the folder.\nUsing the Pro version, which I just bought, you can actually view and modify these white/black lists. Very neat.\nBut you can't whitelist/blacklist a folder that the app didn't directly ask for. \nWhatsApp for instance is directly asking for \"/storage/emulated/0\". There is no way to say \"WhatsApp shall only see /storage/emulated/0/WhatsApp and /data/app/com.whatsapp-1\". \n. Personally I deny every permission and see if it works. If it crashes I check in Xprivacy which permissions it  has recently denied for this app. Then I decide if I get rid of the app or if I grant the permission.\nI've found that you always need to allow the IPC permission IPackageManager:getPackageInfo. And you can always deny the Identification permission SERIAL. . I was just taking about IPackageManager:getPackageInfo not IPC in general. I usually deny all IPC prompts. The only exeption is IPackageManager:getPackageInfo. And shell is usually not a big deal. You just have to pay attention which shell command the app wats to access. If it wants to access su for instance and you allow it, then the app could happily bypass Xprivacy. If it's just trying to access a sound library or similar stuff, then you should be fine. \nJust be sure to never allow an app to access a whole category just because it needs one function of that category.. @MarkoIndaco If an app crashes because of Xprivacy, you can just open up Xprivacy, select the app that crashed, open the menu and tap on Usage Data. This will bring up a list of the most recent permissions that an app has been granted or denied. For instance if the Usage Data looks like this, then the app most likely crashed because it was denied permission for phone/getSimOperator. (The red circle icon with the white minus in the middle indicates the permission was denied. Just look for top-most entry with that icon. That should be the problem.)\n. I see the issue was tagged with \"lowprio\". Does this mean that this is potentially never gonna be fixed? \nThe issue seems rather critical to me tbh, especially due to it's misleading nature. \nIn the meantime: Is there a way to manually change the whitelists somehow? Are the settings stored in a readable format somewhere?\n. I edited the issue text to explain in more detail what is happening and how this can be reproduced. \nIf you need more information, screenshots or anything else, tell me please.\n. Thanks for clarifying. \n\nSince there are a lot of existing users, this logic cannot be changed anymore.\n\nI don't agree with that. In fact I would argue that you could maintain backwards compatibility and yet allow the user to set individual whitelists... \nI would probably do it like this:\nAdd a note informing the user of this change when he updates or imports his old settings.\nAlso, in the popups add a note clarifying what functions will be affected by the whitelisting. \nAnd finally, add a checkbox \"only apply for this function\" for the whitelisting in the popup. \nAnother way could be to ask the user when he starts the new version for the first time, which behavior he would prefer.\nThe least that should be done in any case, is clarifying that the whitelist is applied to more than the mentioned function. Because however desired this behavior might be, it is not obvious to the user.\n. Will you reopen this issue?\n. Yes, I read the whole readme at some point. \nIf you want details:  \nMy default template restricts everything [X] [?].\nReproduce with \"Simple Explorer\":  \n\nInstall it, whitelist IPackage:getPackageInfo, deny everything else. It will be able to access the file system.\n\nReproduce with \"QPython\":  \n\nI installed QPython.\nI manually enabled the inet restriction because Xprivacy doesn't create a prompt for that (another bug btw?)\n-When it asked for IPackage:getPackageInfo, I whitelisted that.\n-I denied every other permission.\n-I went into the Editor of QPython\n-I clicked the icon to save the script\n\nI was able to save my script wherever I want and I was also able to delete any files... and everything happened within QPython.  \nNote: QPython does complain there is no SD Card, but you can ignore that message and access it anyway. \nhttps://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.dnielfe.manager\nhttps://github.com/qpython-android/qpython. Yes. As I said my 'default template' automatically restricts everything including the ones with a red background (including sdcard). So the restrictions are applied before newly installed applications start for the first time. But yes I also restarted the applications. The result was always the same.  \nBtw I should mention that I don't have a physical sdcard in my phone. I have the /storage/emulated/0 directory which is the emulated sdcard from what I understand. That's also the directory that all apps can recursively access btw.. Device: OnePlus One\nAndroid version: 6.0.1 (CyanogenMod 13.0-20160819)\nXposed version: 3.0 alpha4\n@Primokorn \n\nAll access from Storage are denied.\n\nDo you mean that the access is actually denied now or do you mean that you denied it with Xprivacy, but MiXplorer can access it anyways?. I've never done this before, but I'll try in about 1-2 hours. \nIs this how I would have to do it?\n\nturn off my phone\nconnect my phone to the computer\nrun adb logcat -f /storage/emulated/0/logcat.log\nstart my phone\ncopy the log. Okay, I think it worked. I'm currently going through the log manually to make sure that I'm not posting private information online. It will take a while until I went through all 20000 lines.. :/. Here's the logcat:\nhttps://github.com/T-vK/temp/blob/master/log.zip?raw=true\n\nI removed some private information and a few ids and marked the lines in which i did so. \nI started the log when the phone was off. Then I started the phone and opened simple explorer and opened a directory. . @kaizokan Can you confirm that it is actually Xprivacy blocking the access? For instance by disabling the restriction temporarily..

just copy pasted it from Termux, not sure why it's displayed in columns here...). Well, I think that doesn't really matter too much. I mean at least people like me will use it. And even if it is just being used to create helpful guides I think it would be well worth it.\nAnd if you just give it enough time, I'm sure it would be used by more people eventually. . Well, besides that it \"didn't work\" is there really any disadvantage to having a dedicated forum?\nI could of course create an unofficial forum, but then I would have to pay for the hosting and the domain. :/. Yes, I know that, but you're already hosting a website on xprivacy.eu, right? So there wouldn't really be any additional costs if we added a subdirectory for the forum to it. And you could always add a \"keep alive donation button\". I don't think that would work too well if the forum was unofficial.. It doesn't really take any effort to set up a phpbb forum or something like that. And if you're talking about deleting spam on the forum etc, you can easily give other people permission to do that.. Well, I would help as much as I can. I mean if you'd temporarily give me ftp access to a subfolder and a mySQL database, I would set it all up.\nAnd spam isn't really a big problem in the first place if you disable guest posting and use a captcha for the registration. But even if, I would still be willing to help getting rid off it. Maybe not every day, but often enough. \nAnd about your last statement: I don't think that would work very well. I mean first of all I would probably be the only who knows that you can get your thread indexed in the xprivacy start post, secondly it would take a lot of effort for you in the long run and most importantly (imo) you're missing out on features of dedicated forums. So for instance you would not be able to subscribe to get email notifications whenever someone created a new guide.. I understand that, but would it really take that much effort from your side to set it up? . If I would rent a cheap server and set up an XPrivacy forum on it, would you be willing to give it a subdomain?. Thanks, that's great. I will get back to you when I found a VPS and have the forum set up.. ",
    "MarkoIndaco": "I also notice that IPC request, sometimes. So, it's suggested to always deny? Sorry for silly question but i notice that every time it happens the background is red, and so denied it could/should result in a crash of the app...?. Thank you for you're explanations @T-vK , for this I select IPC and checked all the apps, just in case. They were few and for what I can say, also blocking IPC they works as well.\nGreetings. Yes @8alucard8 sometimes seems mandatory for run some app as well. Btw I notice that, in sporadic cases, blocking IPC (or others commands) app soon crash, but if you relaunch it in some cases it works.\nFor this case i have an idea, but needs the help of enthusiast users. And i don't know what @M66B might think.\nMy idea is to open a dedicated page where report all that permission that, if blocked, crash the app without solution to restart it, especially those with the red background, which are the most critical. Something like:\n- Android (number or name)\n- name of the app\n- name of the permission\n- screenshot (optional). Thank you for explanation. I take a look at the Usage Data menu and yes, I notice some of that \"denied\" indicator related to the sim-restrictions, by the way they are not so many, and the apps that I block on \"getSimOperator\" they don't need at all of that function. Indeed they works as well also with that restriction.\nWell, already I am here I can say Xprivacy still working good, except for a message that appear every time I run Xprivacy. But closing the message don't affect the app, that indeed start to loading the app-list like always. I tested some app and seems all good.\n@M66B damn you \ud83d\ude1d  you don't really understand what you've done. With Xprivacy you create a mass of addicted people who can't use no more a phone without it (I'm kidding... but it's true) \ud83d\ude01 \nGreetings. Hey, thank you for reply. Of course is not a bug, i know. This means that XPrivacy works as well. The problem is that crap Google. I'm trying to spoke with a real person on G. Nothing... and is so frustrating. They know ALL about ALL people, and no one can spoke with this xxxxxx.\nIt since from yesterday i recive (around) 20 email por minute (i'm not wrong) that ask \"did you change phone number\"?\nYes, i do, f....g G idiots!\nI'm going to try some help in XDA. Hope, because my phone it's really become unusable cause alert email every 5/10 seconds.... ",

Is it somehow saving the state from the previous XP app window? I think it might have happened if I used the toggle switch to turn off the rules for one app and then opening another XP app window from the notification list, for example when updating multiple apps.\nAlso the XP window is not updating if you're just minimize it (pressing the home button or switching app via the recent list). You need to press the back button for it to update when you open it again (via the recent list). This is also when opening XP from the top scroll down menu via the notifications when an app has updated. Perhaps they are related?.

    "Toufukun": "I have this problem too on CM13 (Android 6.0.1) with Xposed v87 and XPrivacy 3.6.19 (481). I've been a XPrivacy user and I found storage restrictions won't work on Marshmallow. When an app accesses the internal storage (sdcard), XPrivacy won't prompt open function like before. In XPrivacy app, the timer near the function name (like 'open (x minutes ago)') won't show or refresh. There's even no orange '!' near the function name.. @kaizokan @T-vK I think it's a Marshmallow-only problem. (Nougat may have this too if Xposed get compatible with Nougat.). I know nothing about lower levels of Android, but I have to say it doesn't only involve media files. In Lollipop, I can restrict apps open their data and log files in the internal storage. And when office app reads my doc documents, XPrivacy will show too. That's nearly all types of file. (I just can't stand those messy folders created by ad SDKs. I know XPrivacy is only for privacy, but these restrictions does work.)\nI think it's not about compatibility mode. XPrivacy runs in compatibility mode on my Lollipop system and it works well.. Did you unrestrict getPackageInfo, getApplicationInfo or something like that in System category? Or you can whitelist your webview (such as \"Android System WebView (com.google.android.webview)\") in \"Select applications to allow\". You can open this dialog in the menu at your app's settings in XPrivacy.\nPlease check your app's permission Usage data.. ",

If no more updates are forthcoming then you should close this issue again \"because... reasons\".\nAs for others who'll end up here in the future, searching for a ROM with a built-in permission manager is now the better and more reliable and the only option - unless you're fine with a false sense of privacy..

Steps (possibly not all needed):\n1) Started with all contacts blocked.\n2) Refreshed contact list in WhatsApp, showed no contacts (as expected).\n3) Switched to XPrivacy, ticked a contact.\n4) Switched to WhatsApp, refreshed contacts, ticked contact listed.\n5) Quickly (before it disappeared) switched back to XPrivacy.\n6) Opened the contacts whitelist, tick had disappeared. Reticked it.\n7) Switched back to WhatsApp, contacts still showed the ticked contact.\n8) Refreshed the list and the contact stayed visible.  It stayed visible after several refreshes and a reboot.\nI don't know if it's relevant, but the 'working' animated circle shows when refreshing the WhatsApp contact list, and stays there until exiting the screen.\nMoto E 2015 (stock bootloader/OS), Android 6.0, xposed-v87-sdk23, xposed installer 3.1.1, xprivacy_v481, WhatsApp 2.17.79\nSuperSU 2.62-3 and xposed framework installed via squid's twrp:\nhttps://forum.xda-developers.com/moto-e-2015/development/twrp-squid-twrp-recovery-moto-e-lte-t3137649\nAs it happens, I only needed to contact one person in WhatsApp, and once one message had been sent then I can still send messages to that person even if the contact list disappears, so it now works well enough for me.

    "Salamimonster": "Thank you for sharing that workaround with us. In the past it worked 2 of 10 times, but it worked somehow.

    "Tentos": "There may be another workaround. I had the same problem on my Android 6.0.1 phone. My solution was to block the access of WhatsApp to its own WhatsApp account (i.e., do not include the WhatsApp account in the accounts whitelist for WhatsApp). Afterwards, the whitelisted contacts stayed whitelisted as expected.\nThere is one downside: you do not see the WhatsApp information in the contacts of your contacts app. Still, this is an issue I have no problem with.\nEdit: I have just experienced a whitelist loss despite the workaround. However, this could be due to the Android update I had some hours ago. I have again whitelisted the desired contacts, and they stay whitelisted for now. Should the problem appear again, I will keep you updated.. @neuoy That may be possible. Unfortunately, I do not have any real knowledge of Android contacts (or Android in general...), so I can only guess. If I remember correctly, @M66B mentioned on the XPrivacy thread that the XPrivacy contacts restriction was quite hard to implement because of the complicated (non-standard?) way the contacts part of Android is programmed (or something similar).\nI think that this is why he did not look into the WhatsApp contact problem when it happened some years ago [1], and I certainly don't blame him for that. (On the contrary, XPrivacy is still awesome on supported platforms.)\n[1] This WhatsApp contacts problem happened on my old Android 4.2 device some years ago with some versions of WhatsApp, and blocking the WhatsApp account was the workaround I found back then. The workaround was no longer necessary after some WhatsApp releases, i.e., the whitelisting problem disappeared.. ",

Hi @M66B I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s sadly going to take me at least 6 months or more to get ramped up on basic Android dev. XPrivacyLua, at least for me personally, leaves open a few big privacy holes at the moment vs. XPrivacy, and would require extensive changes to close them. I recall you saying at one point that XPrivacy was confusing for a lot of users, and closing these privacy/security gaps with XPrivacyLua might potentially take away the simplicity of the app. I work in IT security, so perhaps I\u2019m the only one who either picks these issues off, used and understood XPrivacy in the way that I did, and/or cares about these issue.  \nI love a good debate and discussing about technology security and privacy issues, so I think maybe the XPrivacyLua thread is probably the best spot to carry on a good discussion on this.
