    "say8425": "I have a same problem. How could you fix it?\nCould you explain more deeply?\n. One image batter than Words. \n\n. https://github.com/say8425/Leferi\nHere is my source link. In this source, introView use EAIntroView.\nand I little modified EAIntroView.\n. I have solved this problem programmatically like this.\nObjective-C\nUIButton *skipBtn = [UIButton buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeCustom];\n[skipBtn setAlpha:0.0f];\n[skipBtn setEnabled:NO];\n[skipBtn setBackgroundImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@\"pageSkipBtn.png\"] forState:UIControlStateNormal];\n[skipBtn setFrame:CGRectMake(([[UIScreen mainScreen]bounds].size.width - self.proposeBtn.frame.size.width)/2,\n                                ([[UIScreen mainScreen]bounds].size.height - self.proposeBtn.frame.size.height)/2,\n                                 115, 115)];\n[skipBtn addTarget:self action:@selector(proposeBtn:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside];\n[introView setSkipButton:skipBtn];\nAnd I delete skipButton in IB. It's little uncomfortable but it works well. Thank you.\n. ",
    "ealeksandrov": "@say8425 what problem do you have? You need to resize your background image to fit screen? Check out bgViewContentMode.\n. In #3 I suggested pages reloading using custom property setter approach. This way we can do view init via storyboard or xib.\n. You can test new pages setter now. Please review your issue.\nMaybe we will need some more tweaks, so pages will conform to autolayout.\n. You forgot [self buildUIWithFrame:self.frame]; in your first answer. With it initWithCoder is working well for me (setting pages for EAIntroView from storyboard).\nBut I didn't test AutoLayout. What is odd with it?\n. In 8af17c475ea25916f185a7dd6b5c770869e6a597 I've added autoresizing for backgrounds and scrollView positioning at IntroView's center (it was in corner all previous time).\nIt adds some autorotation and autoresize support, whilst to successfully resize all pages we have to rebuilt their views inside scrollView on rotation. This will add unnecessary complexity, so right now I prefer to avoid it.\n. What about previously displayed content? What about scrollview and its contentOffset?\nMaybe just reloading all content?\nI think about making pages array as public property, so setPages:(NSArray *)pages will cause reloading all content. This is also flexible solution, as we can also reload only one page by altering existing array and passing it to pages property. Then we can scroll to saved contentOffset if we want to preserve page position.\n. Ok, first I will add separate pages initialization and then will test autolayout issues.\n. 1. You can create UIView with your own buttons, attached to actions, and pass it to titleView property of EAIntroView. This way your custom view will float above all scrollable content. If you want separate buttons on each page - pass them inside custom views in pageWithCustomView:.\n2. Switch swipeToExit property to NO. And if you are adding all buttons in your custom view - pass nil to skipButton.\n. Yes, UIView as a container for your custom buttons is the solution. Hope you have reached the desired layout.\n. Seems, that you are calling EAIntroView from viewDidAppear: (as in the example project).\n1. You should add boolean ivar (or even saved to NSUserDefaults property).\n2. Check this ivar on viewDidAppear:\n3. Change it in loginClicked: and SignUpClicked:\n``` obj-c\n- (id)init {\n     ...\n     introShown = NO;\n     ...\n}\n\n(void)viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated {\n    if(!introShown) {\n        [self showIntroWithCrossDissolve];\n    }\n}\n\n-(void)loginClicked:(UIButton *)sender {\n     introShown = NO;\n     ...\n}\n-(void) SignUpClicked:(UIButton *)sender {\n     introShown = NO;\n     ...\n}\n``\n. That's ok.viewDidLoadis called once - on ViewController loading.viewWillAppearalso get called, when you are returning to this ViewController on navigation stack (on back button touch).\n. Can you attach example project? It looks like in #4 @tunidev got these buttons working intitleView` without problems.\n. You gave me just part of your code. I tried recreating it, but encountered several problems with nib loading.\nThis approach is using very much of hard-to-read code, so I don't recommend this.\nIf you want help with your issue - please attach whole example project to see exact problem.\n. 2.0.0 release is out. Closing this issue, as I cannot reproduce it.\nIf you encounter this problem again - please reopen this and attach example project.\n. Hey,\ncan you share example with this bug?\n. Maybe you are talking about #129?\n. Feel free to reopen with example code if you still have this issue.\n. You have title view with height 45.0, but inserting button on Y = 580.0.\nIf you change button origin to (0,0) it will work perfectly:\n\n. Don't move button inside titleview to the bottom, move the whole title view.\n. I will consider improving titleView layout for simpler customization.\n. Thanks! But if (self.alpha < 0.1f) removes view before calling to delegate introDidFinish. Possible solution is to move 2 instances of\nobj-c\nif ([(id)self.delegate respondsToSelector:@selector(introDidFinish)]) {\n    [self.delegate introDidFinish];\n}\nto separate method (sort of callDelegateAndRemoveSelf). And in that method we can also remove IntroView from superview. I think calling this method will be at line 241 and in animation completion block.\nSo I'm waiting for another pull request or comments about solution.\n. Thanks!\n. Awesome, thanks! Merged.\n. It was working for me on iPhone 4 iOS 6 at initial release. You mean scrollview is not scrolling by touch at all? Or it's about \"swipe to exit\" feature?\n. Ok, thanks for report, I will check tomorrow.\n. I've found some crashes in iOS 5 and 6, that will be fixed soon. But I can't reproduce your exact issue.\nPlease attach example project with proper settings and instructions.\n. Thanks!\nBut everyone with '~> 1.3.0' will receive PATCH version 1.3.2, so this is not required now.\n. What do you mean by CurrentPageIndex? Action to scroll to page with number was added in b04f1b98a8e06750557d758a34fcfbfd61e1b72e and will appear in 2.0 release soon.\n. Got it, thanks for feedback. Stay tuned for 2.0 :)\n. It can be simply accessed with intro.pageControl.hidden = YES;\n. EAIntroView is working on iPad for me. Autolayout for rotation is complex problem - changing width of pages currently requires to rebuild scrollView's contentView (possible by sending new pages array to EAIntroView).\nRight now there is workaround implemented - on landscape rotation same width (from portrait) is used, so there are margins on sides. Background is expanding on whole screen, so it's looks good.\nTry to switch demo project to universal, enable all orientations and play with it on device.\n. @Wingle do not use window directly in creation, instead pass a view there:\nEAIntroView *intro = [[EAIntroView alloc] initWithFrame:self.window.rootViewController.view.bounds andPages:@[...]];\n[intro showInView:self.window.rootViewController.view animateDuration:0.3];\n. There are no password protection on archives generated by GitHub.\n. Thanks. Will be deployed as 2.1.0, because can affect existing layouts.\n. I can't see any warnings in the current version (with or without CocoaPods).\nWhat issues do you see on your project?\n. Do you care about 64-bit environments? I've found that official recommendation for NSInteger is to cast the value to long.\nI don't think that this is issue for currentPageIndex. But if you tell project settings when this warnings will appear - I'll check it out.\n. Thanks, I've found out that adding arm64 slice to Archs turns on this warnings.\nYour pull request with some my additions will be deployed to CocoaPods as 2.1.1.\n. I don't think that endless cycle in intro is good user experience.\nBut I will take a look later this week how this can be implemented.\n. You can simply turn this feature off: introView.swipeToExit = NO;\n. With current scrollView implementation endless scrolling can't be implemented correctly. It'll be possible with transition from pre-built static contentView to dynamically loaded pages.\nI'll leave this functionality for future 3.0 release.\n. Thanks!\nCan you refactor property to showSkipButtonOnlyOnLastPage, verify one-page intro case and maybe add fade in effect for button instead of quick appearing?\nYou can add only some of this features, I'll do the rest before merging to master.\n. What Cocoapods version do you have? (pod --version) On 0.29.0 everything is working normally for me.\nTry updating with gem install cocoapods.\n. @semerda set introView.swipeToExit = NO;\n. @jschmid,\nThis addition is just shortcut. Scroll disabling can be still done with direct access to introView.scrollView and introView.pageControl.\nBut you are adding chance of inconsistency in your implementation: if somebody will directly set introView.scrollView.scrollEnabled - value of introView.scrollEnabled would be wrong.\n. I'm closing this for now. Please submit new PR if you'll find clean solution for scrollEnabled property representing actual state of scrollView & pageControl.\nThanks!\n. Thanks, got it.\nWill move first delegate call to showInView:animateDuration:.\n. Thanks! That's great feature, I'll consider adding this soon.\n. Working on it in #119 \n. Please attach (or email me) minimal example project, I can't see any mistake in your code right now.\n. I've re-checked demo project with your code, all is working ok.\n. Demo project works ok for me without any changes:\n\nCheck it and compare to your code.\n. That's really awesome edits, thanks!\n. Yes, it is broken for non-animated transition, thanks.\n. Hi! Thanks for this hint.\nIn ARC weak is safer than assign because it will be set to nil when object gets deallocated.\n. What do you mean by 'fadeout transition'? Cross-dissolve is simultaneous fading in and out:\n```\nfloat backLayerAlpha = alphaValue;\nfloat frontLayerAlpha = (1 - alphaValue);\nif (self.easeOutCrossDisolves) {\n    backLayerAlpha = easeOutValue(backLayerAlpha);\n    frontLayerAlpha = easeOutValue(frontLayerAlpha);\n}\n```\nYou can change this behavior by subclassing EAIntroView and overriding crossDissolveForOffset:\n. Please attach demo project, so we can look into this issue.\nOr do you have this problem with bundled demo?\n. Thanks for hints, I'll check it out and test on iOS 6 and 7.\n. Look like a bug in iOS6 with NSLayoutConstraint and constant value. Switching to relative constraint solved the problem for me on iOS7 device and iOS6 simulator.\nPlease take a look at the commit and tell your opinion, so I can release patch version on CocoaPods asap.\n. Thanks.\nPlease change (nonatomic) to (nonatomic, assign) to match code style.\n. Great, thanks! :)\n. Please check out autolayout implementation of this feature in [EAIntroView.m#L281].\nIf you have any issues with this - please report them.\nI've fixed iOS6 compatibility just now (036dc22 - #38), so it's working for all my cases.\n. I am adding UIViewContentMode bgViewContentMode property on EAIntroView, so you can manage resizing/scaling issues of background images.\nTitle images shouldn't be affected at all, their frame is independent from device viewport.\nIf you still have any issues, please share them.\n. That is awesome, thanks! I've added some small edits and pushed to master.\n. Can you provide a test case? I tried deallocating IntroView on swiping, but haven't seen the issue.\n. Closed until further details or reproduced demo.\n. Can you provide test case in which description still disappears? For me everything working normally on iOS 6.1 simulator with various descriptionLabelMaximumWidth values.\n. Still a lot of strange transformations in iOS6. I will drop autolayout support on descLabel and release as 2.5.0.\n. It's because frame of scrollview keep constant size. You can offset initial Y values, so on rotate they remain visible on screen.\n. @Sun3 thanks for sharing!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks. Will add check for selector.\n. This is usefull only for very specific use case, I'm still considering about exposing this.\n. Thanks for suggestion.\nRight now I will close this, due to limited use cases. This is most useful for some animation handling, but I will think about adding animations between pages in more simple and clear way.\nOne of the solutions to do this with current implementation is KVO:\n``` obj-c\n...\n    [intro.scrollView addObserver:self forKeyPath:@\"contentOffset\" options:NSKeyValueObservingOptionNew context:nil];\n...\n\n(void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString )keyPath\n                      ofObject:(id)object\n                        change:(NSDictionary )change\n                       context:(void )context\n{\n    UIScrollView * scrollView = (UIScrollView ) object;\n    if ([keyPath isEqual:@\"contentOffset\"]) {\n        NSLog(@\"New contentOffset: %f\",scrollView.contentOffset.x);\n    }\n}\n``\n. Thanks, merged!\n. I will make a new release on CocoaPods (2.6.2) very soon.\n. 2.6.2 released.\n. Thanks for sharing!\n. Haven't seen this issue, will check it out. Thanks! :)\n. @adamdehaven crashfixes for iOS8 merged on master and deployed as 2.6.3 on CocoaPods. Please check for your problem and if it is still persisting - reopen issue with screenshot.\n. @adamdehaven thanks for suggestion, will think about this!\n. Issue should be fixed already. Please submit demo project representing your crash.\n. Which version of EAIntroView are you using now?\nTake a look at #59. This crash should be fixed already.\n. Pass your UIButton intosubviews` array of EAIntroPage\n. Can't say much about your current code. Why do you need to store button as a property?\n\n\nHere you are. Based on bundled example - moved custom created skipButton as subview inside first page.\n. You're welcome! Make cool stuff!\n. 1) Hide skip button:\nintro.skipButton = nil;\n2) Show only on last page:\n[intro.skipButton removeFromSuperview];\npage4.subviews = @[intro.skipButton];\n[intro setPages:@[page1,page2,page3,page4]];\n. Which auto layout constraints are you applying to button?\n. Sorry for being late, but I can't reproduce your issue. Is this still actual?\nAre you using EAIntroPage from xib with constraints set in IB?\n. @say8425 , how is it going? I can confirm @RafaelKayumov's words, the issue is accidentally added multiple introviews.\n. Ok, but you still have huge logical error in your code:\n[introView showInView:self.introView animateDuration:0.3];\nYou are creating introView inside another introView.\n. I ran into some compatibility issues implementing auto layout for current version. Maybe it's time to make 3.x version and drop everything under iOS 7.\n. Will wait for iOS8 release to make sure auto layout works well there.\n. @caramdache thanks for the suggestion - I'm working on it.\n. I want to support iOS7 and up, most of the autolayout issues are different between 6 and 7. I am currently working on it.\n. Switch from autoresizing masks to autolayout constraints. Support iOS 7 and up.\n. Thanks to @XBeg9 for https://github.com/XBeg9/EAIntroView/commit/8e7cb8a17f4d799881b73d9ede3b2d70ed97d760 - here is some improvements inspired by it: 11f4d7751bd6576b3f3ac007c5cf4f8d84f7fd53\nCustom skipButton positioning is wrong right now (always remain default), but whole structure is much better. After dealing with it I will make version 2.7 with most fixes and then will drop iOS 6 and remove all related hacks.\nFor 3.0 I am considering simple autolayout by default with unlimited customisation.\n. More work on fixing constraints: 70431dbfde42ce187c023f01bf05fd1a3e5a08ec\nNow custom skipButton fully supported.\n. You already can use autolayout internally in your views. What problems are you experiencing?\n. Yes, if you are using page views from own xibs - try to enable autolayout there.\nI haven't done this personally, but in the discussion above people are using it.\nI can't get further on implementing and testing full autolayout support because I am waiting for feedback on some bugs. Anyway, autolaoyut is top priority task for me and it would be done soon. Demo project will be updated too. \n. Dropped autoresizing masks and fully switched to auto layout in 7b245c11fa3f5159f2a38de0b70f6273ec223ab9.\nWill continue to test rotation and resizing in #79.\nPlease test :head and share how it can be improved.\n. Yes, block scrollEnabled in onPageDidAppear block of page 3 and reenable it in button's action.\n. Thanks, this can be useful, will consider for future release.\n. Had to create specialised UIScrollView subclass - EARestrictedScrollView.\nScrolling in EAIntroView now can be limited in 2 ways:\n1. Setting scrollingEnabled to NO limits scrolling only on current page (can't go previous or next page).\n2. Using limitScrollingToPage: limits scrolling from 1st page to selected page (can go previous pages, but not next).\nExample added to demo project: ViewController.m#L334\n. @allaire what problems are you experiencing? Demo project seems to work fine.\n. @allaire ping\n. @allaire pong :)\n. Appreciate your feedback. Keep in mind that :head is little broken for rotation and resizing, it is WIP.\n. @Amaneo  you are referencing obj-c example. Can you provide exact code that is not working?\n. You don't need to transition anywhere to show intro. It is displaying above current view controller.\n. Thanks for suggestions, I've used them with little differences: e2ffe6721d67d3e08fb8671dcac53bf9ca27eecd\nAlso added showInView: animateDuration: withInitialPageIndex: in 5a4051fb1360591fa62afaf22f938fba6e56dea6\n. Implemented in d5c796e484f2a6109a8d1129dc99d49c18d0a529, please review and comment.\n. That's autolayout issue, will think about workarounds.\n. And for me it is not working.\nProper fix for #72 should change autolayout constraint. I will try to get to this on current week.\nI think we should make pre-iOS7 fix without any autolayout and new >7 version with autolayout.\n. Check out #76, it's looks like universal solution.\n. Thanks!\nBut I think to fix it without didFinish property, because we can trigger the same intro many times.\n\nThe setCurrentPageIndex setter never actually updates _currentPageIndex.\n\nThis helps to ensure that the currentPageIndex value always will show actual page position of scrollView.\n. I think this is confusing. To center it with current version, you can pass height/2 to descPositionY. But if you want to stick it to the bottom, it is much more complicated after your changes. More than that, you are proposing to change descPositionY but left titleIconPositionY and titlePositionY, this is unacceptable.\nBut I will add height centering of elements in demo project to show this ability.\n. Closed until further details or reproduced demo.\n. This bug was fixed in https://github.com/ealeksandrov/EAIntroView/commit/a22523cf512e6f12a2c039fd9d3e0cbd78038c3f, but it is magically disappeared from master branch. Looks like a faulty merge, will investigate ASAP and deploy on Cocoapods when its ready.\n. Fixed in https://github.com/ealeksandrov/EAIntroView/commit/9d4448d10ab4acdb1851b2d9f66474cafbd986bd\n2.6.4 pushed to Cocoapods succesfully.\n. Blocked by #100\n. Thanks a lot for details on your implementation! Looks interesting. I already fixed blocking bug, will do some refactor and move to this issue soon.\n. @funnel20 thanks a lot, that's a great solution. I pushed this to master branch.\nNow I will think more about adding constraints between page items (title, desc, etc), not just offset from top/bottom. Or maybe choice between constraints or coordinate offsets.\n. \n\n. Thanks, but old gitignore is working perfectly for me, I can't see any advantages in proposed version. It is even cluttered with android-related stuff.\n. Thanks for suggestions. Changes in your commits are too coupled, I can't cherry pick only good to me, so I did little cleanup based on your work: 3591765c1e6d63de6de7285b66adb83f2dc6e24f\nConstraints refactoring is huge deal, they should be more atomic and discussed/commented before merge. I am closing this PR, see #64 on autolayout/constraints discussion. I am still looking into https://github.com/XBeg9/EAIntroView/commit/8e7cb8a17f4d799881b73d9ede3b2d70ed97d760 and testing your fork, much thanks for your contribution!\n. Thanks for sharing!\nI looked through your code and made a little change (184f85a36d7f6a4a233f2ff61f5ff433ce3d5417) to EAIntroView + added demo (aca2881fa1d9f08806d9a3b5e867496a8897ca9b) to do the same effect (animated showing of skipButton on any page). Feel free to comment on my implementation.\n. You need to have File's owner to connect actions directly in IB.\nAs a quick solution I suggest you assigning tags on your controls in IB and linking them in code directly.\n\nAdded this example to demo project: e5fd795dc25a009001a8f9eb70801af19ed39bb5\n. Thanks, I am looking into it\n. skipButton.titleLabel.text is readonly, you should be using setTitle: forState:\nAdded a demo in 5a41ef2cc778355d90fa2e7fb3978bf80f70c7cd.\n. In d5c796e484f2a6109a8d1129dc99d49c18d0a529 backgroundColor now is clearColor if any page's alphaValue is different from 1.0. Default is still blackColor to preserve original appearance.\nRemember that it could be changed outside of EAIntroView implementation (intro.backgroundColor).\n. Thanks, I will go through all the bugs in this weekend.\n. Thanks, will look on a demo.\n. @caramdache can't see any attached files.  My mailbox is also empty.\n. Sorry, I can't access it. Please sent it directly to evgeny@aleksandrov.ws or upload to Mega/Sendspace/etc.\nI am working on 3.0 release now, so I will get to this bug immediately on receiving from you.\n. Thanks for sending this to me.\nsplitViewController.view.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = NO;\nthis line conflicts with current implementation, because we are using autoresizingMask inside EAIntroView - this is due to autolayout inconsistency in iOS 6 & 7. In v3.0 I will transition everything to constraints, so this issue should disappear. But lets keep it until then and recheck before 3.0 release.\n. In 81c1f612f3c8c8dbbc434e55b1436d68de60b54b I added showFullscreen set of actions. It will find topmost window and show intro there. Since it is not linked to your customized view - intro will work and resize fine.\nTested in your example project - working ok.\n. Please provide build error description.\nI just tested latest repo version on Xcode6 + Yosemite and demo project is working ok.\n. Try adding #import <UIKit/UIKit.h> to the top of EAIntroPage.h\n. :+1:\nIt's not your mistake, I'll add this import to source.\n. \nThat's working for me when I just enabled landscape mode in demo project. Are you sure that you are handling rotation in parent view controller?\nCurrent support is just a hack, I am working on autolayout and possible solution to handle rotation properly in 3.0 release.\n. Closed in favour of #79.\n. Can you provide some code or example project? I tried this in demo app and it is working normally:\n``` obj-c\n- (void)showIntroWithCustomViewFromNib {\n    EAIntroPage page1 = [EAIntroPage pageWithCustomViewFromNibNamed:@\"IntroPage\"];\n    EAIntroPage page2 = [EAIntroPage pageWithCustomViewFromNibNamed:@\"IntroPage\"];\n    EAIntroPage page3 = [EAIntroPage pageWithCustomViewFromNibNamed:@\"IntroPage\"];\n    EAIntroPage page4 = [EAIntroPage pageWithCustomViewFromNibNamed:@\"IntroPage\"];\n    page1.bgImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@\"bg1\"];\n    page2.bgImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@\"bg2\"];\n    page3.bgImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@\"bg3\"];\n    page4.bgImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@\"bg4\"];\nEAIntroView *intro = [[EAIntroView alloc] initWithFrame:rootView.bounds andPages:@[page1,page2,page3,page4]];\n\n[intro setShowSkipButtonOnlyOnLastPage:YES];\n[intro showInView:rootView animateDuration:0.3];\n\n}\n``\n. I made the same setup, even withCJPAdController`, but I can't see this bug.\nPlease check it out: https://github.com/ealeksandrov/IntroTest. Add there your xibs or anything else to reproduce the bug. Also you can send your example project to me by email privately (you can find address in my GitHub profile).\n. \nEvery page is instance of EAIntroView itself! :smile:\nJust clear this field (use plain UIView there) and it will work normally.\nI will think about more clear way to use EAIntroView in IB.\n. Thanks for suggestions. For 2 question your solution is ok. For 1 it really depends on your application UI and your code structure. In most cases you can present intro on your top root viewcontroller (tab bar controller, for example) or login view controller with animateDuration = 0 in viewDidLoad.\nBut better call it from your \"router\" object. For example, when you're creating root tab bar controller there, check NSUserDefaults and add EAIntroView on top of it if needed. In this case AppDelegate will just do something like\nwindow = UIWindow(frame: UIScreen.mainScreen().bounds)\nwindow?.rootViewController = Router.sharedInstance.rootViewController\nwindow?.makeKeyAndVisible()\nand all intro injecting code will be left in Router class.\n. Really strange. Your code is ok, nothing criminal.\nI will try to reproduce your issue when I have time. Also I am thinking about adding showFullscreen method to encapsulate all the logic about finding topmost viewcontroller. Stay tuned.\n. Yes, I think this is ok :)\nLooks like buggy navigationController and you found a workaround.\n. In 81c1f612f3c8c8dbbc434e55b1436d68de60b54b I added showFullscreen set of actions. It will find topmost window and show intro there.\n. The keyWindow is the window that is currently accepting mouse and keyboard events. It is not guranteed to be topmost displayed window.\nBTW snippet for window selection is taken from SVProgressHUD, which worked perfectly for me for a long time.\n. Current :head is somehow broken without autolayout?\nI will test this case soon, but some time ago scrollview resized well on rotations.\n. Autoresizing masks now dropped. Supporting only iOS7 and up. If this can be a bugfix for previous EAIntroView version - please clarify.\nThanks.\n. EARestrictedScrollView moved to separate repository and linked as a dependency. For manual installation get it here: https://github.com/ealeksandrov/EARestrictedScrollView\n. Thanks, I will thinks about ways to simplify it. How about git submodule support?\n\nI'm using EAIntroView from RM\n\nWhat is RM?\n. > a copy of the file in the EAIntroView directory\nThis needs update of EAIntroView for every bugfix or improvement in EARestrictedScrollView.\nI will think about it, thanks for suggestion.\n. Mentioned dependency explicitly in README: 5abc8793e6f63183e76d0e07822b6b9baa29707c\nMoving this custom class here would be bad style and strong coupling.\n. Thanks for feedback.\nI am still working on rotation and resizing support, it is not tested at all. Will investigate your case today.\n. Can't say much right now, need to test and fix current :head. I will let you now about results.\n. Why don't you use page.titleIconView for your logo? It will be centered automatically.\nI fixed backgrond sizing in :head to work as you describe, but full autolayout support is blocked by #100. Lets continue discussing rotation issue in #79.\n. I found the cause of this issue, now working on bugfix.\n. It related with addSubview: override on ScrollVIew subclass. Working on ways to fix it.\n. \n:tada:\nI finally found a root cause of this issue: EARestrictedScrollView.m#L54-56\nAutolayout somehow uses subview property and overriding it - breaks things. This depends on many other things, as many contributors shared above, but fixing subviews deals it for me in 100% of cases.\nI will merge all changes and push new version of EARestrictedScrollView. After this, EAIntroView will be updated and pushed on Cocoapods as well.\n. Latest version - 2.7.0 should work for you. Only :head contains 81c1f612f3c8c8dbbc434e55b1436d68de60b54b and 7b245c11fa3f5159f2a38de0b70f6273ec223ab9, that added explicit dependency on autolayout.\n. How can only @3x image be affected, but not original and @2x?\nI will use @3x assets in new demo, so will test.\n. Thanks for sharing.\nWe need pageControl's userInteractionEnabled = YES to switch pages by clicking on pageControl. I haven't heard about this issue from other developers, so let's leave it for now.\nYou can set intro.pageControl.userInteractionEnabled = NO for your project without touching library code.\n. Thanks for information and way to fix, will look into it!\n. Can you verify this on latest version of EAIntroView and cocoapods?\nMy pod install output is fine:\n\n. Extremely strange, I'm getting your error now. Probably have to remove Podfile.lock.\n. My mistake, I should run pod update for example project on every podspec update.\nFixed in 8f63ee170bcdb6859879c5eccc2430e69813ddb5\n. Thanks for report, I'll check it out. Right now you can simply switch version back. 2.7 is huge change on way to 3.0, it can have many bugs.\n. Related with #100?\nThanks for sharing, I'll look into it.\n. Closing as duplicate of #100\n. Should be fixed by now, related with #104\n. Verified by pod try EAIntroView, fixed in 2.7.3.\n. There are a number of critical bugs in current code, have to deal with them first.\nGoing to finish it on this week.\n. I fixed a number of issues and pushed 2.7.1 version on Cocoapods.\nThere will be significant bug fixes (related with xibs and autolayout) and more updates soon.\n. 2.7.2 and 2.7.3 was created struggling with #104 & #107 - just Example project maintenance.\n2.7.3 is the best for now :)\n. Good point, thanks!\n. Something wrong with your Cocoapods setup.\nJust tried to create fresh project, added pod 'EAIntroView' and imported in view controller - and it works ok.\n. Please update to latest version. This issue was originally reported in #6, conditionally fixed in 3e850a03f3aa2414c6b69b0b61407b45c3149c21 and even dropped at all in current version: EAIntroView.m#L356\n. Hey,\nHow are you handling presentation of introView? showInView or showFullscreen?\n. I cannot reproduce this issue wit current version of EAIntroView - for showInView:animateDuration: it collapses vertically, for showFullscreen - just stays underneath (because it uses different UIWindow). None of tests shows bottom bar.\n\n\n. @marinotws looks like you are presenting IntroView on inner view of TabBarController. You should use showFullscreen or showInView:tabBarController.view. I can't say much without demo code. Feel free to send it by email.\n. Can't help since my simple implementation is working well. If you can recreate wrong behaviour in small demo project - please share it here or by email.\n. Feel free to reopen with some sample code related to this issue.\n. \u0424\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 - page.bgImage \u0438\u043b\u0438 introView.bgImage?\n. \u0412\u043e\u0437\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0430\u044f\u0441\u044c \u043a \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0435 - \u0442\u0443\u0442 \u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438, \u0430 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043b\u0435\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0445 \u0444\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0441 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u044c\u044e \u043f\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0442\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0442\u0430. \u042d\u0442\u043e\u0442 feature request \u043e\u0431\u0441\u0443\u0436\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432 #118 \u0438 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d \u0432 \u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0445 \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u044f\u0445. \u0421\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043d\u0442 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f blurring \u0438 fading. \u0412 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c fading.\nClosing as duplicate, discussion of background image fading will be continued in #118.\n. Hey,\ngood idea. But I don't really like exposing UI elements, how about just supporting attributed strings in desc and title properties of EAIntroPage?\nWill try this out on next week.\n. This is certainly in plans for future release but I can't guarantee any exact estimates. PRs welcome :)\n. 1. I'm ok with breaking backward compatibility if you provide nice API solution.\n2. Anyway it shouldn't work only with NSAttributedString - this will require more boilerplate code for 90% of use cases.\n. It really more depends on application, as @Omarj described. We can't override status bar in UIView when \"View controller-based status bar appearance\" set to YES.\n. That's very complex issue. It will require duplicating 1st and last pages like:\n4 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 1\nSo if we have changeable state on first or last page (buttons for example) - we have to preserve their cloned state.\n. Not yet, it will require huge library redesign, I'll consider it on Swift rewrite.. How about adding blurring or fading whole background image? I can add options to IntroView instance, so it will fade and/or blur its background. Will it work for you?\n. Great, will add this options on this week. Most likely it will be included in 3.0.0 release.\n. Awesome, thanks for mentioning :)\n. We can't know view hierarchy for any custom page. Maybe I will add tapToNext button beneath of all subviews in custom view, this will work for most of use cases.\n. Closed by #175 \n. Great research, thanks! I will look into this issue on this week.\n. Resolved in #129\n. Closing as we removed notifications completely in #191.\n. Resolved in #129\n. I took a look at KASlideShow - it is a simple UIView subclass.\nYou can init it with desired frame and pass to intro.titleView property. titleView can be any kind of UIView, it also can be container and position different views inside, like buttons - #4, #7.\n. We don't have -layoutSubviews in current version, it was removed on transition to autolayout. Please check out latest version and let me know if you have any issues.\n. Yep, it is already implemented in demo project: \n``` obj-c\n// show skipButton only on 3rd page + animation\nintro.skipButton.alpha = 0.f;\nintro.skipButton.enabled = NO;\npage3.onPageDidAppear = ^{\n    intro.skipButton.enabled = YES;\n    [UIView animateWithDuration:0.3f animations:^{\n        intro.skipButton.alpha = 1.f;\n    }];\n};\npage3.onPageDidDisappear = ^{\n    intro.skipButton.enabled = NO;\n    [UIView animateWithDuration:0.3f animations:^{\n        intro.skipButton.alpha = 0.f;\n    }];\n};\n\n```\nThis will show skip button only on 3rd page and hide on all others. Invert this logic to hide button only on last page.\n. @wdcurry I tried it in viewDidLoad and this fix works for me. So I am accepting this PR, let me know if you still have any issues.\n. Looks good, thanks! And sorry for delay, had to get rid of all bugs before moving to new features :)\n. Transition between pages? You can implement sliding backgrounds in current version just by adding custom views for backgrounds, so they will slide along with pages. More complex animations will come later, you can add your specific requests on this in #94 \n. You can expose it in interface extension in your code\nobj-c\n@interface EAIntroView()\n- (void)buildScrollView;\n@end\n. Thanks for sharing, I will look into your solution.\n. Tried:\n``` obj-c\nEAIntroPage *page1 = [EAIntroPage pageWithCustomViewFromNibNamed:@\"IntroPage\"];\npage2.bgImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@\"bg2\"];\nEAIntroPage *page2 = [EAIntroPage pageWithCustomViewFromNibNamed:@\"IntroPage\"];\npage3.bgImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@\"bg2\"];\nEAIntroPage *page3 = [EAIntroPage pageWithCustomViewFromNibNamed:@\"IntroPage\"];\npage5.bgImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@\"bg2\"];\nEAIntroView *intro = [[EAIntroView alloc] initWithFrame:rootView.bounds];\n[intro setDelegate:self];\n[intro setPages:@[page1,page2,page3]];\n[intro showInView:rootView animateDuration:0.3];\n```\nAnd it works well for me. Please check out latest version and let me know if you still have any issues.\n. Just present EAIntroView over desired VC. After disappearing it will show your VC.\n. No, I can't see any pros in migrating to Swift. But I have planned to add modern obj-c features like nullability and generics to ease up the bridging with Swift projects.\n. Anyone having problems using EAIntroView with Swift - refer to answer in #143\n. Since Swift 3 is out and pretty stable - next EAIntroView major version will be rewritten in Swift.\n. Obj-c lightweight generics added in f440f6b522fc3170231cae45d49feb862fded324.. I can't reproduce a bug. Can you share example code to force a crash?\n. Thanks!\nMerged in 4509af581cabbf469a1ffc485b51929121c31052\n. Maybe you didn't add files to test target.\nAlso take a look at #143 that covers 2 ways of Swift integration.\n. There are 2 ways to use EAIntroView in Swift project: as a module or importing through bridging header.\nHere is importing it in a bridging header:\n\nAnd here is using it as a module, you need to add use_frameworks! to your Podfile:\n\n. Please take a look at linked commit, it should solve your issue. If any of problems still persists - let me know.\n. I was afraid that updating _currentPageIndex directly can result in undesired behaviour during scroll animation. But after looking over the code and testing it, I will agree with your arguments.\nRelated commit: a5ce2c3336f4dfbc3cc1a02ef3ba9f8272fd9be6\n. While testing I have one problem: changing #import <EARestrictedScrollView/EARestrictedScrollView.h> to #import \"EARestrictedScrollView.h\"\nBut I can't see issue with ld: library not found for -lEAIntroView\n. There are 2 ways to use EAIntroView in Swift project: as a module or importing through bridging header.\nHere is importing it in a bridging header:\n\nAnd here is using it as a module, you need to add use_frameworks! to your Podfile:\n\n. Do a clean and delete derived data :) Can't say any more than that.\n. I took these example screenshots after creating new project in Xcode, adding pod file and running pod install. They are not related with bundled example project in any way.\n. Please check out #148 \n. I am using latest Xcode 7.2 and latest CocoaPods 0.39.0\n. Tried on fresh new project with EAIntroView 2.8.0 from Pods - it worked flawlessly:\n\n. Please share your Xcode version (Xcode - about Xcode) and CocoaPods version (pod --version)\n. Already pushed and deployed 3.8.1 yesterday :)\n. Thanks for great demo of bug! I will look into it on a week.\n. Can anyone confirm this bug on device?\nI struggled with debugging on simulator until tested it on my iPad 4. And it worked flawlessly, just as designed.\n. Tested:\niOS 9.3 simulators:\n- iPad 2 - working\n- iPad Retina - working\n- iPad Air - broken\n- iPad Air 2 - broken\n- iPad Pro - broken\nDevices:\n- iPad 4 - working\nSince I can't reproduce this on on my device and there is no possible reason for this behaviour - I consider it as iOS Simulator bug.\n. Thanks for reporting!\nClosing as iOS Simulator bug.\n. O_o\nFile a radar. I really can't see any reason for this behaviour. This is iOS autolayout issue.\nDifferent behaviour on iPad Air and iPad Retina within the same iOS 9.3 simulator - 100% Apple issue.\n. Will look for devices to test it.\nTry to override shouldAutorotate in VC containing EAIntroView.\n. Weird. Thanks for info, lets collect more feedback in this issue.\n. Can anyone update us on this bug with iOS 10? Particularly with projects and devices already experienced this issue on iOS 9.\n. Fixed by #191 \n. Thanks!\n. Can't reproduce on my simulator. And whole issue (ok on device, but not on simulator) sounds like a Simulator bug. File a radar.\n. Can you tell what line is causing crash?\n. You can also downgrade version-by-version to narrow down changeset to debug.\nHave you tried 2.8.0, 2.7.1, 2.7.2, 2.7.3, 2.7.4?\n. Can't reproduce on iOS Simulator 8.1 and latest EAIntroView version.\nAfter multiple test runs I seen crash or simulator launch once, but that was fixed by simple project clean.\n. Thanks for reporting, confirmed, working on a fix.\n. Fix deployed in 2.8.3.\n. Hey!\nWhat do you mean, \"index return to 1\"? Scroll to first page after last, like in #117?\n. This is hard to implement with current scroll architecture, but I will certainly look more into it.\n. I fixed CI issue in master, so this check can be ignored. Thanks for your contribution.\n. Looks good, thanks!\n. Thanks. Podspec pushed to CocoaPods.\n. Good catch. Try looking for custom page controls that are subclasses of UIPageControl.\nI'll update demo when I have time.\n. After looking through this - there is no ability to effectively subclass UIPageControl so we need to ultimately choose some particular custom PageControl that will suit all our customization needs.\nSince there is no good open-source solution (SMPageControl is not maintained) - I will return to choosing/creating dependency when rewriting EAIntroView in Swift.\nFor obj-c SMPageControl hack is ok but I don't recommend it for Swift. I won't add SMPageControl as dependency now as I don't think that it is needed for most of users and others can use current workaround.\n. Sorry, I didn't have enough time. Will get back on this today/this week.\nPRs greatly welcome.\n. Just tested with CocoaPods 1.0.1, Xcode 7 and 8, obj-c and swift, iOS 9 and 10 simulators and iOS 10 device:\n- example obj-c project, even after full Pods rebuild\n- the same project via pod try EAIntroView\n- new Swift 3 project in Xcode 8\nFor me it looks like CocoaPods 1.0.1 solved this issue.\n. CI build is also green: https://travis-ci.org/ealeksandrov/EAIntroView, so I'm closing this, feel free to comment/reopen if someone still experiencing any related issues.\n. Please use stable CocoaPods, I won't make a public release for beta users.\nAfter 1.1.0 is released I'll do a check.\n. Any log? Can you share your Podfile?\n. Looks great, thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. 1. When onPageWillAppear and onPageWillDisappear should be called?\n2. What is actual need for this number of events? I assume any \"init\" code for onPageWillAppear can be safely and effectively done in onPageDidLoad. And any \"deinit\" - in onPageDidDisappear.. It is not supported right now and not a short-term feature. But I am open to discussion and implementing it in future releases.\nHow do you want it to look? Storyboards can only store views inside ViewControllers.\nOne possible idea is to make EAIntroView as some sort of container with pages as child views.\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/a/21946121/840588\n. Hey! In 2.9.0 introDidFinish:wasSkipped: was introduced to provide additional info to delegate: EAIntroView.h#L28\n. No problem. First place to look into in similar cases - CHANGELOG.md :)\nLooks like we have the same issue in example project. I'll keep this issue open until I update it.\n. Good catch, thanks for detailed research on this.\nI agree with your suggestion and will be happy to see PR.\n. Great work \ud83d\udc4d \n. You can use setCurrentPageIndex: to present last page, turn swipeToExit off, add transparent 1st page and use 1st page onPageDidAppear block to close intro.\n. Don't enable swipeToExit in onPageDidAppear. Just dismiss it straight away: [self.intro hideWithFadeOutDuration:0.3].\n. Initial configuration is ok, only make sure that you're setting page1.alpha = 0 before passing pages array to EAIntroView instance.\nIn onPageDidAppear add only one line self.intro.hideWithFadeOutDuration(0.3). Nothing more there.\nThat's should be enough.\nPlease let me know if you still have any questions.\n. Closing as a duplicate of #162 \n. Yeah, we should fix that :)\nClosing as duplicate of #167 \n. Looks great, thanks!\nGive me a couple of days to check this manually and I'll merge this.\n. Sorry for late review and thanks for awesome work!\n. Thanks a lot for your contributions, looks awesome!\n. Simple removal of bgImage properties from pages of example show clear background color:\n\n. Pass you custom button with desired frame:\nhttps://github.com/ealeksandrov/EAIntroView/blob/6c4f11637f0a8a8b5fe14d14d7c032d701eacadb/Example/Source/ViewController.m#L127-L136\n. Sounds legit. I'll check this.\n. Confirmed, will make a note for improving customization in next releases.\n. Thanks for report, I'll check this.\n. Hmm, it is working fine for me:\n\n. I managed only to reproduce something like this when no autoresizing or autolayout is applied:\n\nBut when autolayout is applied, passing pages array on viewDidLoad results in completely correct behaviour:\n\n. What image? There are image backgrounds, title views, custom view...\n. I am not sure what are you trying to achieve, but check bgViewContentMode property.\n. 1) If you want to change background image of whole intro, not 1 page - subscribe to orientation notification in your code and when notification arrives - just change intro.bgImage.\n2) If you want to change background image of specific page - that's not simply supported by library. You can use page with customView, add UIImageView there manually with keeping reference to it and subscribe to orientation notification. When notification arrives - just change image in your custom image view.\n. \ud83d\udc4d\n. FIxed by #190\n. Please check out #162 \nI will get back to this when I have time.\n. Already discussed: https://github.com/ealeksandrov/EAIntroView/issues/186\n. That should work with manual index change, I'll check when I have time.\n. Sure, will push update on this weekend :)\nBut we still need to fix delegate call from setCurrentPageIndex:, so keep this issue open.\n. Cleaning up the issues in preparation for CocoaPods release.\nFor anyone having issues with setCurrentPageIndex:animated: - use scrollToPageForIndex:animated:. Difference between them and reason to split into 2 methods discussed in #144, #174, #177.\nIn future releases this redundancy of similar methods should be removed.\n. EAIntroView 2.10.0 pushed to CocoaPods trunk! :tada:\n. Great, thanks!\n. I still can't reproduce bug in 10.1 simulator, but this is nice solution anyway - thanks!\n. Can you reproduce your setup in demo project? We also have navigation controller there.\n. That's not problem with IntroView frame on your first screenshot.\nintro.pageControlY = 20; is the source of issue.\nYou can see here that property called pageControlY - not pageControlBottomPadding. So 20 will be the length from page control top to intro view bottom.\nIn #190 we fixed autolayout calculations with default frames, so page control Y (20) - default height (36) = -16 padding to bottom. That's why it is displayed below bottom border. Skip button don't have Y setup, so it used the same alignment as page control.\nPrevious version layout calculation was wrong. Please adjust your pageControlY to bigger value to fix.\n. Hey, thanks for proposal!\nBut it adds feature bloat without any advanced customization possible. Now this can be accomplished by page lifecycle blocks on any page, not only last, like:\nobj-c\n    page4.onPageDidAppear = ^{\n        intro.pageControl.hidden = YES;\n    };\n    page4.onPageDidDisappear = ^{\n        intro.pageControl.hidden = NO;\n    };\nAnd implementing #165 will add ability to tweak it further and add any kind of animation.\n. Since this is pure obj-c - yes, you can include it in any Swift project.\nThere is no special setup instructions, but you can check out examples in #143.. Just enable it with intro.useMotionEffects = YES.\nYou can tweak how it looks by changing intro.motionEffectsRelativeValue. Default value is 40.0.. Sounds like a complicated thing. How about using page from custom view and add scrollview in it?\nMore proper solution will be to design font sizes to be correctly visible for all devices/screen sizes.. Then scrollview inside pages should work. Don't know about caveats though, view hierarchy will look pretty strange - scrollviews inside scrollview.. Try to load that Nib in separate variable with \"loadNibNamed\" and check what will be in that array.. Check out example project, it should be pretty simple: https://github.com/ealeksandrov/EAIntroView/blob/master/Example/Source/ViewController.m#L192. Use pageIndicatorTintColor and currentPageIndicatorTintColor properties on UIPageControl - introView.pageControl.\nFor very custom dots check out example project.. Thanks, confirmed bug and your solution works well!\nAdding it to the library.. Actually I found way to prevent it without additional actions in UIScrollView delegate (which will fire on every scroll) - check out 3e623411ac6895bd5dbca00010d76d81b51addc1.\nStill thanks for your suggestion and bringing it to my attention :). Right, that's smaller iOS background parallax.\nThis is interesting feature, but how do you want it to work? To use 1 big background image for all pages at once? And scroll it slower than front pages?. Ok, I'll keep this issue open for reference.. * Carthage compatibility added in e974414a213ff1d2f2b1b481f4cd8ff80293772f;\n Docs updated in 364c393848abd5db41362df07593991a0bca0626;\n Carthage prebuild frameworks support added in ba876f82bb20e94e42e9dc33d4f513e0b5b9ccc2.. From Apple Docs:\n\nImportant\nYou should not embed UIWebView or UITableView objects in UIScrollView objects. If you do so, unexpected behavior can result because touch events for the two objects can be mixed up and wrongly handled.\n\nI tried number of workarounds, but nothing worked for me.\nSo I'll close this for now since it's explicitly unsupported by Apple.. Try \nintroView.transform = CGAffineTransformMakeRotation(M_PI_2);\nBut I'll consider this as feature request.

Make sure that you really added image14, image15 and image16 into project.. I can't help more, because I was already testing on iPhone 7.\nBut you can email your project with your exact images on my github info email for inspection.. Resolved. Old library version (2.8.0), upgrade to 2.10.0 fixed the problem.. I think that's famous \"scrollviews inside scrollviews\" situation that can lead to strange behaviour. Can you share simple setup based on demo project to reproduce it?\nPossible duplicate of #205.. Closing it's explicitly unsupported by Apple.\nMore info in #205.. It's centered by design. What is its width? To start on x=0 it should match IntroView width.. Have you tried using bgImage instead of titleIconView?\nAlso I have no idea what is happening on your attached screen and how do you want it to look.. What happens if you drop your image in example project?\nI don't understand yet where is titleIcon on your screenshot.. Ok, now I see.\nCan you share this image with me, so I can test it?. \nHere is how you can do it now:\n```obj-c\nEAIntroPage *page1 = [EAIntroPage page];\npage1.title = @\"Testing image\";\npage1.desc = sampleDescription1;\npage1.bgImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@\"bg1\"];\nUIImage testImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@\"image\"];\nUIImageView testImageView = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImage:testImage];\nfloat imageRatio = testImage.size.width / testImage.size.height;\nfloat widthToFit = self.view.bounds.size.width;\n[testImageView setFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, widthToFit, widthToFit / imageRatio)];\npage1.titleIconView = testImageView;\n```\nIn EAIntroView we're preserving original image size 1:1. Code above will resize titleIconView to fit screen.\nI will think more about updating page layout to handle this automatically.. I'll look into it on weekend and give you update.. Added autolayout constraints to fit titleIconView inside page frame - https://github.com/ealeksandrov/EAIntroView/commit/a090a152d01e8259391432de867ba5c7b4aec7c7\nWith your image it produces same screenshot as workaround above. Also works in landscape.\nIt lays out titleIconView - title - description vertically. PageControl and SkipButton may overlap - but they can be on any position on a page (for example, on top), so I don't manage them in this equation.\nTo add padding between description and screen bottom and fit pageControl there - you can add empty newlines at the end of page description.\nReleased in 2.11.0.. Thanks for detailed investigation, I'll play with it later on this week.. Hmmm.\nIt was a long dance around one line.\n4f68750b9282c58c674e00d92fdf2ed475ce1b52\nf1fdfd46b06d387e63ed366e169d7cbf8b914fa2\na5ce2c3336f4dfbc3cc1a02ef3ba9f8272fd9be6\nhttps://github.com/ealeksandrov/EAIntroView/issues/67\nhttps://github.com/ealeksandrov/EAIntroView/issues/144\nhttps://github.com/ealeksandrov/EAIntroView/issues/174\nhttps://github.com/ealeksandrov/EAIntroView/pull/177\n\nRemove the following line from setCurrentPageIndex:animated::\n_currentPageIndex = currentPageIndex;\n\nThis is bad for a reason mentioned in https://github.com/ealeksandrov/EAIntroView/issues/144:\n\nThis would be a rather unusual behavior for an UIKit component. Normally the initial state is effected immediately not after the animation has finished (UITabBarController.selectedIndex, UINavigationController.topViewController, ...).\n\nThe main issue is initial exposing of currentPageIndex setter while there are some actions triggered by pages scrolling. So currentPageIndex should be only observed without any intervention from outside.\nTo change pages programmatically - scrollToPageForIndex:animated: should be used.. Decided to go ahead with this suggestions: https://github.com/ealeksandrov/EAIntroView/issues/174#issuecomment-233220893 & https://github.com/ealeksandrov/EAIntroView/pull/177\nFixing scrollToPageForIndex:animated: for animated:NO - fa98a3755d5e31c8f386e97da48521697f447ad8\nRemoving setCurrentPageIndex:animated: - 08dc45c14c7b8d8ac5fabd18053cd9c0045c084f\nWill push 2.12.0 release shortly..

No deadlines ever promised.. Intro view frame laid out with auto layout and it respects its intrinsic size if no additional constraints are added. Setting button's frame is useless.\nAdd width and height constraints:\nobj-c\n[intro addConstraint:[NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItem: btn\n                                                  attribute: NSLayoutAttributeWidth\n                                                  relatedBy: NSLayoutRelationEqual\n                                                     toItem: nil\n                                                  attribute: NSLayoutAttributeNotAnAttribute\n                                                 multiplier: 1.0\n                                                   constant: 295]];\n[intro addConstraint:[NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItem: btn\n                                                  attribute: NSLayoutAttributeHeight\n                                                  relatedBy: NSLayoutRelationEqual\n                                                     toItem: nil\n                                                  attribute: NSLayoutAttributeNotAnAttribute\n                                                 multiplier: 1.0\n                                                   constant: 66]];\n\n.

Mm not sure?  For me this has arise with the orientation of the device so if starting in portrait the correct image is on the page but rotating to landscape it remains with the portrait image so was trying to figure out how to pass the new image into the page on rotation event.\nBut perhaps yes your suggestion is the correct one now I think on it ;-)\n. cool, thank you ;-)\n.

You should pass bounds:\nEAIntroView *intro = [[EAIntroView alloc] initWithFrame:self.view.bounds andPages:pages];\n2. Issue with scrolling.\n   As I see, your project uses automatic layout. Auto layout prevents UIScrollView from scrolling. Setting content size after scrollView is displayed avoids the problem.\n   We are going to deal with it in next patch version. But until we do, you can fix it with setting content size manually after scrollview displayed.\n.  @say8425 , I see that you create new intro view and add it to current view (which is already marked as EAIntroView in storyboard). You also add skip button to newly created intro, but the button is configured for current view. I suppose that constrains are not transferred somehow. You should create intro view in IB and add it as full sized subview to view controller's view. Herewith drag you skip button to intro view and configure the constraints.\n.

Adjust contentSize of ScrollView\n3. Adjust frame of each page\n4. Adjust scrolling to fit resized page\n5. Adjust restricted scroll area\n6. Correctly reposition the page objects: titleIconView, title and desc.\nAs a result I'm able to simply reposition my custom objects on device orientation (see issue #99) by adding the proper autoresizingMask to these objects.\nI have done point 1 in - (EARestrictedScrollView *)scrollView { by correcting autoresizingMask:\n_scrollView.autoresizingMask = UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleHeight | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth;\nPoints 2 till 5 are covered in a new method that is the result of observing UIDeviceOrientationDidChangeNotification:\n```\npragma mark - Notifications\n\n\n(void)deviceOrientationDidChange:(NSNotification *)notification {  \n    // Get amount of pages:\n    NSInteger numberOfPages = _pages.count;\n// Increase with 1 page when feature enabled:\nif (self.swipeToExit) {\n    numberOfPages = numberOfPages + 1;\n}\n// Adjust contentSize of ScrollView:\nself.scrollView.contentSize = CGSizeMake(numberOfPages * self.scrollView.frame.size.width, self.scrollView.frame.size.height);\n// Adjust frame of each page:\nNSUInteger i = 0;\nfor (EAIntroPage *page in _pages) {\n    page.pageView.frame = CGRectMake(i * self.scrollView.bounds.size.width,\n                                     0,\n                                     self.scrollView.bounds.size.width,\n                                     self.scrollView.bounds.size.height);\n    i++;\n}\n// Adjust scrolling to fit resized page:\nCGFloat offset = self.currentPageIndex * self.scrollView.frame.size.width;\nCGRect pageRect = { .origin.x = offset, .origin.y = 0.0, .size.width = self.scrollView.frame.size.width, .size.height = self.scrollView.frame.size.height };\n[self.scrollView scrollRectToVisible:pageRect animated:NO];\n// Adjust restricted scroll area:\nif(!self.scrollingEnabled) {\n    self.scrollView.restrictionArea = CGRectMake(self.visiblePageIndex * self.bounds.size.width, 0, self.scrollView.bounds.size.width, self.scrollView.bounds.size.height);\n}\nelse {\n    self.scrollView.restrictionArea = CGRectZero;\n}\n}\n```\n\n\nTo receive this notification, I added an observer to - (void)applyDefaultsToSelfDuringInitializationWithFrame:(CGRect)frame pages:(NSArray *)pagesArray {:\n// Add observer for device orientation:\n    [[UIDevice currentDevice] beginGeneratingDeviceOrientationNotifications];\n    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self\n                                             selector:@selector(deviceOrientationDidChange:)\n                                                 name:UIDeviceOrientationDidChangeNotification\n                                               object:nil];\nThe observer is removed in - (void)finishIntroductionAndRemoveSelf {:\n// Remove observer for rotation:\n    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] removeObserver:self];\n    [[UIDevice currentDevice] endGeneratingDeviceOrientationNotifications];\nNow point 6 remains. I have a difficulty with this, because the decision that titlePositionY and descPositionY are from the bottom of the screen. To solve it, I added the following autoresizingMask to all 3 objects in - (UIView *)viewForPage:(EAIntroPage *)page atXIndex:(CGFloat)xIndex {:\n```\ntitleImageView.autoresizingMask = UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleLeftMargin | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleRightMargin | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleBottomMargin;\ntitleLabel.autoresizingMask = UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleLeftMargin | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleRightMargin | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleTopMargin;\ndescLabel.autoresizingMask = UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleLeftMargin | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleRightMargin | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleTopMargin;\n```\nHowever, the problem with the title and the description is that in my app (see #99 ) I have positioned these to the top of the screen, by using a large titlePositionY ([UIScreen mainScreen].bounds.size.height - 50.0;). So when using UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleTopMargin, these objects are being pushed above the visible screen when rotating from Portrait to Landscape. In my case I used UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleBottomMargin.\nSo for point 6 I have no generic solution. I hope you can find one, based on the information that I provided.\n. Rotating from Portrait to Landscape will now properly reposition the items, especially my custom button \"Begin\". This was impossible before, since the page's frame was not resized, so the button always stayed at the wrong place, no matter which autoresizingMask or constraint settings I used.\n\nRotation to landscape is now perfect:\n\n. I hope all of this helps you to implement this feature request.\n. You're welcome. I hoped it would have been merged already in the main branch.\n. Great!\n. Hi,\nNo problem, I reverted to the previous version, which works properly for the rotation.\nOnly what I can't get working is to properly reposition my custom views (like the logo) after rotation.\nI tried with autoresizingMask property, but whatever options I provide, it doesn't work.\nWhat I do is:\n// Create logo:\nUIImageView *dutchovateLogo = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImage:[UIImage imageNamed: @\"DutchovateLogo\"]];\n[dutchovateLogo setFrame:CGRectMake(([UIScreen mainScreen].bounds.size.width - 238.0)/2, [UIScreen mainScreen].bounds.size.height - 280.0, 238.0, 68.0)];\n// Add logo:\npage1.subviews = @[dutchovateLogo];\nDo you have any suggestion?\nThanks\nOn 24 Feb 2015, at 13:06 PM, Evgeny Aleksandrov notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nThanks for feedback.\nI am still working on rotation and resizing support, it is not tested at all. Will investigate your case today.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n.

I guess it's related to our project not having the HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS set properly. For some reason since using XCode 8 mine is completely empty so is my Pods' (I don't know if that's normal)\n. Here's my very retarded workaround: I used version 2.6.4 since it wasn't using EARestrictedScrollView at the time. I had to make minor changes to my code but at least it runs! I've been bashing my head on my keyboard for the past weeks to upgrade my apps, damn. Cocoapods is great but can wreak havoc!\n. @nypisces Yes but what about Swift 2.3?! It has to be retrocompatible otherwise all current project that aren't using Swift 3 (a LOT) will get broken. I'll try to upgrade my cocoapods to 1.1.1....\n. Seems to work on non-pre 1.1.1! Neat!\n.

    "JakeSc": "This is because the method setCurrentPageIndex:animated: sets self.currentPageIndex before scrolling:\n_currentPageIndex = currentPageIndex;\nAnd then, in the scrollViewDidEndScrollingAnimation: delegate method, it calls the following code:\n[self notifyDelegateWithPreviousPage:self.currentPageIndex andCurrentPage:newPageIndex];\n    _currentPageIndex = newPageIndex;\nThis notifyDelegate method has a check:\nif(currentPageIndex!=_currentPageIndex && currentPageIndex < _pages.count) {\n        [call delegate]\nBecause the setCurrentPageIndex:animated method already set the _currentPageIndex ivar, this notifyDelegate check fails.\nIn general, I would recommend against custom setters that have side-effects. So we would have a (mostly empty) setter for setCurrentPageIndex:, and a separate method that performs the scrolling (like scrollToPageIndex:).\n. I'm able to reproduce this as well by using tapToNext and tapping on the pages.\n. Okay, I fixed this in https://github.com/ealeksandrov/EAIntroView/pull/177 . You can call scrollToPageForIndex:animated: to switch pages, and it should hit the delegate method.\n. Closing this - I'm going to reopen a new one from a different branch.\n. New one:\nhttps://github.com/ealeksandrov/EAIntroView/pull/178\nI wanted to use a different branch on my repo for this one. This is so that I can have both PRs merged in my repo into master, and just use my repo's master for my app's pod, so I can get both fixes.\n. I exposed the new scrollToPageForIndex: method in the header file. Calling this is essentially the same as calling setCurrentPageIndex:animated:, except for the fact that it doesn't actually set the _currentPageIndex. This happens after the scroll has occurred.\n. I did this so that I can add an NSTimer that automatically advances pages, but still have that pageAppeared delegate method called.\n. ",
