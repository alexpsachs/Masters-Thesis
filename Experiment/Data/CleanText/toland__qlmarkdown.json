Awesome bug report. I'm not sure I can help, but I want to try... If anyone knows what's going on, jump in.\n\nWhat version of qlmarkdown and OSX are you using? You can get the OS info from sw_vers on the command line, or from About This Mac.\n. Awesome! I'm glad you resolved your problem, but we have been fighting these types of issues for a while and I think we need to come up with a good answer. Can I use you for reference if I work on this issue in the near future?\n. Wow... I completely missed that. Sorry this is such a nuisance, but I think we can get it. I did test it and can't reproduce, but I have to wonder if we're having a UTI issue.\n- I uninstalled qlmarkdown\n- Ran qlmanage -r\n- Verified that no markdown files render at all\n\nNote: I do have Mou installed, so they show up with a Mou icon, but no markdown preview.\n- I downloaded Version 1.3.2\n- Installed into ~/Library/QuickLook, then ran qlmanage -r\n- Observed that my test.markdown and test.md files were not re-rendered\n- Highlighted the file and pressed space\n- Everything works\n\nI'm pretty sure that there is nothing wrong with the way you installed it. The error seems to be in our software. I'm going to have to look deeper into this as I know we have some closed issues that might help.\n:bulb: Could you run mdls against your two files?\n|  | Test.markdown | Test.md |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| kMDItemContentType | \"dyn.ah62d4rv4ge8042pwrrwg875s\" | \"dyn.ah62d4rv4ge8043a\" |\n| kMDItemContentTypeTree | ( | ( |\n|  | \"dyn.ah62d4rv4ge8042pwrrwg875s\", | \"dyn.ah62d4rv4ge8043a\" |\n|  | \"public.data\", | \"public.data\" |\n|  | \"public.item\" | \"public.item\" |\n|  | ) | ) |\n| kMDItemDisplayName | \"Test.markdown\" | \"Test.md\" |\n| kMDItemKind | \"Markdown\" | \"Markdown\" |\n. That's super helpful. Your UTI information is all over the place. I looked into some of the issues you're having and while doing so I noticed I completely botched the last release, so could you try the v1.3.3 release and see if it fixes your problems along with cancer :skull: and world hunger :meat_on_bone:?\nIf that doesn't help, could you tell Spotlight to re-index your folder containing the markdown files in question?\n. Woohoo! Progress...\nI think what made the difference are the dyn items, so I'll try to get more of those.\n. Sorry, I haven't been on my Mac in a while, so I don't have the ability to\ntouch the project. Soon, though. So sorry to leave you hanging like this.\n. Superb information, @aviris. I'm really sorry that this is so painful for you.\nI'll see what I can do to update the QuickLook integration to be more modern. It was written before quite a few recent changes to the QL system.\nAlso, if someone is using another system that works well, I don't think it should be considered taboo to mention it here. \n. I really need to get back on this project. Sorry guys. It's been super busy. I think about you all the time -- especially since I edit markdown on my computer and this plugin isn't working for me.\n.

Awesome bug report. I'm not sure I can help, but I want to try... If anyone knows what's going on, jump in.\n\nWhat version of qlmarkdown and OSX are you using? You can get the OS info from sw_vers on the command line, or from About This Mac.\n. Awesome! I'm glad you resolved your problem, but we have been fighting these types of issues for a while and I think we need to come up with a good answer. Can I use you for reference if I work on this issue in the near future?\n. Wow... I completely missed that. Sorry this is such a nuisance, but I think we can get it. I did test it and can't reproduce, but I have to wonder if we're having a UTI issue.\n- I uninstalled qlmarkdown\n- Ran qlmanage -r\n- Verified that no markdown files render at all\n\nNote: I do have Mou installed, so they show up with a Mou icon, but no markdown preview.\n- I downloaded Version 1.3.2\n- Installed into ~/Library/QuickLook, then ran qlmanage -r\n- Observed that my test.markdown and test.md files were not re-rendered\n- Highlighted the file and pressed space\n- Everything works\n\nI'm pretty sure that there is nothing wrong with the way you installed it. The error seems to be in our software. I'm going to have to look deeper into this as I know we have some closed issues that might help.\n:bulb: Could you run mdls against your two files?\n|  | Test.markdown | Test.md |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| kMDItemContentType | \"dyn.ah62d4rv4ge8042pwrrwg875s\" | \"dyn.ah62d4rv4ge8043a\" |\n| kMDItemContentTypeTree | ( | ( |\n|  | \"dyn.ah62d4rv4ge8042pwrrwg875s\", | \"dyn.ah62d4rv4ge8043a\" |\n|  | \"public.data\", | \"public.data\" |\n|  | \"public.item\" | \"public.item\" |\n|  | ) | ) |\n| kMDItemDisplayName | \"Test.markdown\" | \"Test.md\" |\n| kMDItemKind | \"Markdown\" | \"Markdown\" |\n. That's super helpful. Your UTI information is all over the place. I looked into some of the issues you're having and while doing so I noticed I completely botched the last release, so could you try the v1.3.3 release and see if it fixes your problems along with cancer :skull: and world hunger :meat_on_bone:?\nIf that doesn't help, could you tell Spotlight to re-index your folder containing the markdown files in question?\n. Woohoo! Progress...\nI think what made the difference are the dyn items, so I'll try to get more of those.\n. Sorry, I haven't been on my Mac in a while, so I don't have the ability to\ntouch the project. Soon, though. So sorry to leave you hanging like this.\n. Superb information, @aviris. I'm really sorry that this is so painful for you.\nI'll see what I can do to update the QuickLook integration to be more modern. It was written before quite a few recent changes to the QL system.\nAlso, if someone is using another system that works well, I don't think it should be considered taboo to mention it here. \n. I really need to get back on this project. Sorry guys. It's been super busy. I think about you all the time -- especially since I edit markdown on my computer and this plugin isn't working for me.\n. Try going to releases. The latest release should have a download link with what you're looking for. \nOn Fri, Aug 01, 2014 at 9:08 AM, Paul Huygen notifications@github.com wrote:Dear Philip,\nthank you for qlmarkdown. I would like to use it but I seem to be too dumb to install it. The readme.markdown tells me that I should copy directory QLMarkdown.qlgenerator into ~/Library/QuickLook, but  QLMarkdown.qlgenerator does not exist in the repository, It seems that I should compile something but I have no idea how to do that.

I'm planning on rewriting that soon, so it shouldn't be a problem. Problem is my free time is tied up until 10 Oct, so it's going to be hard.\nThis plugin was written for an older version of OSX. The reason that I took the survey (#52) was so that I could know if I could ditch support for old systems and just support the more modern ones. Seems that's the case, which will make it easier.\n.

Any ideas? Thanks.\n. @tarwich Honestly \"does not work\" and \"+1\" are too short to be informative, so I'm not sure about what their problems are. For me it's just the file extension as in #25\u2014only .markdown works (and works fine in this case).\n\nUpdate: I mean, @kevinSuttle and @ibc might have just tried it on .md and decided that it didn't work\u2014.md is much more prevalent than .markdown isn't it. We won't know until they come back with extra information.\n. @BonzaiThePenguin Hmm, interesting... Anyway, for those who can't figure it out, a quick fix is to add com.unknown.md to LSItemContentTypes in Info.plist, as I did in this commit in my fork.\n. ",

    "tweh": "Damn \u2026 I forgot the most important thing :-/ Thanks anyways :-)\nI\u2019m using OS X 10.9.3 and an older version of qlmarkdown. For testing now I made a clean install, i.e. deleting all qlmarkdown files, reinstalled the latest release (v1.3.2), run qlmanage -r and restored the Finder. The plist looks different than before (cause I had an older version obviously) but strangely it says Bundle version = 1.3.1 which is an error an must be 1.3.2 \u2013 I guess. But even this clean install reproduces the above described problem only the .markdown files a parsed correctly. I guess you can\u2019t reproduce this, can you?\nIs it possible that some other apps interfere? Are there other places where QL plug ins can be stored? (I checked ~/Library/QuickLook and /Library/QuickLook as said above) \u2026 \n. While trying to find a solution (without really knowing what to search for or what I\u2019m doing) I found QLStephen and now all the above mentioned file types are shown als plain text except .markdown which is still pares correctly as Markdown.\n. Sorry for being unclear but unfortunately the problem ist not solved yet \u2026 only files ending with .markdown are shown as I expect. All the others only show plain text which is not what I wanted (and which is not the intended behavior I guess) \u2026\n\nCan I use you for reference if I work on this issue in the near

Sounds good \u2026 whatever you mean with that ;-) Let me know if I can help in any way \u2026\n. Hi :-) are there any news on this issue?\n. @a6073758: Thanks but it help only a little. This is my status now:\n| file | QL result | program |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| test.markdown | works | TextWrangler |\n| test.md | works | TextEdit |\n| test.mdml | plain | none |\n| test.mdown | plain | TextWrangler |\n| test.mdwn | plain | none |\n| test.mkd | works | Brackets |\n| test.mmd | works | none |\n| test.text | plain | TextEdit |\nPS: I deleted an older comment of mine accidentally. The previous table had test.md with \u201cplain\u201d entry \u2026\n. With 10.9.5 without any changes in the QL extension (v1.3.3) it works for me for most important file types (changes to previous status in bold face):\n| file | QL result |\n| --- | --- |\n| test.markdown | works |\n| test.md | works |\n| test.mdml | plain |\n| test.mdown | works |\n| test.mdwn | plain |\n| test.mkd | works |\n| test.mmd | works |\n| test.text | plain |\n. Damn \u2026 I forgot the most important thing :-/ Thanks anyways :-)\nI\u2019m using OS X 10.9.3 and an older version of qlmarkdown. For testing now I made a clean install, i.e. deleting all qlmarkdown files, reinstalled the latest release (v1.3.2), run qlmanage -r and restored the Finder. The plist looks different than before (cause I had an older version obviously) but strangely it says Bundle version = 1.3.1 which is an error an must be 1.3.2 \u2013 I guess. But even this clean install reproduces the above described problem only the .markdown files a parsed correctly. I guess you can\u2019t reproduce this, can you?\nIs it possible that some other apps interfere? Are there other places where QL plug ins can be stored? (I checked ~/Library/QuickLook and /Library/QuickLook as said above) \u2026 \n. While trying to find a solution (without really knowing what to search for or what I\u2019m doing) I found QLStephen and now all the above mentioned file types are shown als plain text except .markdown which is still pares correctly as Markdown.\n. Sorry for being unclear but unfortunately the problem ist not solved yet \u2026 only files ending with .markdown are shown as I expect. All the others only show plain text which is not what I wanted (and which is not the intended behavior I guess) \u2026\n\nCan I use you for reference if I work on this issue in the near future?\n\nSure \u2026\n. > Could you run mdls against your two files?\nSure :-) Hope it helps.\n|  | test.markdown | test.md |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| kMDItemContentType |
