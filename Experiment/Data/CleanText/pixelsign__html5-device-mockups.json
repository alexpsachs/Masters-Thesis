    "ben182": "Pull request is already opened.\n. Hey andrew8712,\nI think thats caused by the lazy loading. We do not perload every device when the site loads. We would end up with a lot of traffic. Insted when you change the phone, the browser loads the image. You can test this by switching the same 2 devices. On the first switch, the delay occurs. From the second time on, the devices switch intant.\nBen. That's right - you can not find it until this pull request is merged. Bower needs the config file in the repository. Unfortunately the owner does not maintain his repo that often.. Hi\ncan you explain your problem a bit further and give some code examples?. You can control the height by setting a max-width in the .device-container. For example 300px. This will also make it responsive for small screens.. galaxy_tab4 has no psd file. http://www.pixeden.com/psd-mock-up-templates/iphone-7-psd-mockup-vector. https://www.behance.net/gallery/51510707/-free-iphone-6-6s-mockup-. http://www.designlazy.com/iphone-7-mockup-psd/. Hi @bencmbrook,\nbasically you cannot control the height of the device through the css height property.\nIt is a bit more complicated since we need to respect the device's aspect ratio.\nSo the formula is: Wanted Height = X / Y * 100. X is the Wanted Height, Y is the padding-bottom property of the device DIV. This will calculate the needed width.\nHere is the working example: https://jsbin.com/wacezudezi/1/edit?html,css,output\n. Hi @bencmbrook,\nwill this affect the css image paths? Have you tested this?. Okay thanks for the help!. #49. Actually the device pictures are very small - nevertheless I will accept the pr.. Fixed #53. Sadly not. We need a good mockup. Feel free to commit one as I added the help wanted flag.. Hi SamThilmany,\nI appreciate and checked ur changes. Actually I dont think this is helpful. Preprocessors are to help writing simpler CSS. If we put 2 different in the bucket it gets complicated. Moreover, with two preprocessors we have two device array files. This would make it more difficult to maintain.\nBen. Okay, so I sleeped about it and I guess I accept ur PR. I think I can live with two preprocessors and since we get more developers into the project with scss its a win-win for all. The problem with the doubled maintenance is still present but I dont know a solution to this yet. Actually we have to keep in mind that we have two files to maintain.. U know what? I consider removing the less part. When I look over the new scss files in comparison, I notice the more simple and more beautiful approach. Especially for the loop.. Hi ralphchung,\nwe use the MIT license. I changed the package.json.\nCheers Ben . Hi,\ndisable pointer-events: none; in .device .screen.\nThis should fix it.\nCheers. Hey,\nI can not accept your PR yet. The following needs to be changed:\n\nYou have to include your device in the sass file. Otherwise it can get overwritten in the future. Please use Grund to build your css file afterwords and not write your rule directly in the css file. You will also get the minified version with these steps.\nPlease add your device to the global readme. \n",

    "bencmbrook": "Gotcha. Appreciate the help.. And one thing to note-- the imac and iMac folders were combined in this PR, which moves the .PSD into the folder. I figured this combination was okay, since this is consistent with other devices' folders. The same goes for the .PSDs in surface and ipad.\nIn total, this PR changes\n- rename macbook to Macbook\n- rename iphone5 to iPhone5\n- merge imac into iMac\n- merge surface into Surface\n- merge ipad into iPad. Hey @ben182, the CSS image paths remain as they were. The data-device attributes always used proper capitalization, so the paths always resolved to the correct capitalized case. In other words, there are no API changes and it should not break any existing projects.\nI've tested this, and it's running properly now on my production server (which was failing before due to the mismatched letter casing).\nAnd thanks for this awesome repo!. worked fine for me on bower 1.7.9 and bower 1.8.2.

    "SamThilmany": "Actually, the default value of the $rel-mockup-path variable should point to the actual folder of this project. I will change it to ../../device-mockups and recompile the css.. @ben182 I only partly agree with your opinion. \n\nPreprocessors are to help writing simpler CSS\n\nYes, absolutely, but they also give you the possibility to include the styles into your own project styles and overwrite some basic settings. Think on bootstrap for example. If you are building a serious website, you won't include the basic bootstrap stylesheet, but import those modules you need and alter the variables to your needs.\nOkay, so you might think that what I just said only applies to huge projects such as bootstrap, but the simple fact, that I cannot change the path to the mockup images in your current code shows the opposite. If I want to use html5-device-mockups I have to have the same project structure as the one defined, otherwise, the css code will not find the images. \nIn my opinion, this is a huge shortcoming of the project. Have a look at font-awesome, they define a 'scss' and a 'less' variable for the path to the fonts too, otherwise, you wouldn't be able to use it, if you choose to import it yourself.\n\nMoreover, with two preprocessors we have two device array files.\n\nThat's a big problem, I know. Maybe it is possible to write one array, that can be read from 'scss' and from 'less'. Hopefully, there is a possibility to do so.\n\nI'm including all my css dependencies into my scss files, which is also commonly done in the industry. So why restrict this to less? The popularity of scss is growing and has overtaken less by far, so there is really no reason (besides the two arrays) to not include a scss version for those users that want to use it.\nI really like the way font-awesome deals with this by offering the two most common preprocessors and a compiled version for those users that simply want to add a style tag. \n\nSidenote: This PR came to life because I wanted to use html5-device-mockups in one of my projects and I needed a scss version. That's why I quickly translated your less code into scss.\n\nRegrads, Sam. Great to see that this was accepted.\nJust as a side note: If you add me as Collaborator/Developer I'll happily take care of the scss in the future.. ",
